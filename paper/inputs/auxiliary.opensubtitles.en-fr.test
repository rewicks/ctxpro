We need someone who can move like them, fight like them.<eos> We need someone who can walk into a tornado, and come out the other side like it was a damn gentle breeze.<eos> You know someone like that?<eos> No.<eos> But Gibbons did.
Your partner's being real pig-headed about this.<eos> My partner?<eos> My partner's the smartest guy in the room, and if you don't see that, you two are dumber than you look.<eos> His partner's not even in the room.<eos> I don't even.
Excuse me?<eos> It's just cute that you get up before us and get breakfast. Ooh.<eos> Did she just call me cute, Kingston?<eos> I believe she did, Edgecomb. Mmm-mmm.<eos> Al, Linds doesn't do "cute." No.
Why do you think that I'm a good person?<eos> Do you remember when you were a little girl?<eos> You used to take turns riding all of the horses in the stable so that none of them would feel left out?<eos> Do you remember that?<eos> I do. Mmm-hmm.
Does it smell like pee in here?<eos> Stop.<eos> Norma Bates!<eos> What?<eos> Just don't.
She loves you more than you can possibly know.<eos> Am I dead?<eos> Do you feel dead?<eos> You knew I would come, didn't you?<eos> Course I did.
I didn't know they can't smell molly.<eos> Campbell, you have to train a dog to smell specific drugs, okay?<eos> How do you think this thing works?<eos> I don't know how it works. I thought you guys knew how it worked.<eos> We do.
- Do you want to complete the rituals?<eos> - Yes, sir.<eos> In that case, find out where Raees hides his stuff.<eos> - Do you agree?<eos> - I do.
In that case, find out where Raees hides his stuff.<eos> - Do you agree?<eos> - I do.<eos> - Agree?<eos> - I do, sir.
Debt-ridden workers are killing themselves.<eos> How will they pay for court cases?<eos> Did I tell them to die?<eos> Think it over.<eos> Done.
Perfect opportunity, and look at that one - she's smiling.<eos> Oh, Inspector, this is clearly a waste of time.<eos> - And if there's nothing...<eos> - I know what happened to your son.<eos> You do?
That something in my past would come back to haunt me one day.<eos> Yes, well, he's a very tangible ghost.<eos> God, I just wanted a bit of peace, and I really thought I had it.<eos> No, Mary...<eos> You do.
- Promise me!<eos> - I promise, I promise. Ssh, ssh.<eos> Yes. I... so like you.<eos> Did I ever say?<eos> Yes, yes, you did.
- I got it.<eos> - Come on, climb up. Climb up.<eos> - I did it.<eos> - Billy, you got it.<eos> - I did it!
Let's step into the footprints, please.<eos> Let's try this.<eos> Standing in this circle as a team, you can easily connect to the morphing grid.<eos> - Do you feel it?<eos> - Yeah, they do.
Training is over for today.<eos> Go home. I'm sorry, he just morphed.<eos> He did it.<eos> You saw it, right?<eos> Do it again.
Just...<eos> Yeah, I just thought...<eos> -Nope, nope, no!<eos> -Yeah!<eos> -Oh, you didn't.
Hey.<eos> What are you doing in here?<eos> What do you want in life?<eos> To be happy.<eos> You do?
Start from the beginning.<eos> I woke up.<eos> How did you sleep?<eos> I didn't.<eos> I don't.
No. It's okay.<eos> Let him do what he wants.<eos> He's entitled.<eos> I killed his wife.<eos> Yes, you did.
Though I should mention that it is possible for any given text alert<eos> - to become randomly attached to... - Happy birthday.<eos> Thank you, John, that's very kind of you.<eos> Never knew when your birthday was.<eos> Well, now you do.
Yep. My Dad says, "Those who can, do."<eos> "And those who can't, supervise."<eos> Your father is a hippy.<eos> What happens when you grow up?<eos> We don't.
Believe me... Eugenia won't take her eyes off your children.<eos> Not for one second.<eos> That's very reassuring.<eos> Now you see them.<eos> And now, you don't.
- Do you know where he lives?<eos> - No.<eos> His name?<eos> Gardner, I promise, I don't know anything about him.<eos> Nobody does.
There! Right there!<eos> Back door! Go to the back door!<eos> Back door! Back door!<eos> Stop!<eos> Mija! Don't!
You live in... town, don't you?<eos> Yes.<eos> You live by the school?<eos> How did you know that?<eos> I just do.
Bruce, over here! Okay, shutterbugs. Look alive, here we go.<eos> I'm gonna give you three poses.<eos> You ready? Kissy face.<eos> Oops, I did it again.<eos> And the Bad Boys. What you gonna do?
Danny, we don't know what's causing it.<eos> The EPA cleared us.<eos> Fifteen cases of cancer can't be a coincidence.<eos> Do you think that I don't care about those people?<eos> I do.
Voted them all out.<eos> - Joy, Danny...<eos> - Danny?<eos> Do you know where Ward is?<eos> No, sir, I don't.
Only when a person stops fighting do they lose.<eos> As long as we continue to fight we are not beaten!<eos> You can move now.<eos> No! Stop!<eos> Don't!
What do you mean?<eos> Yesterday.<eos> You seemed all down in the dumps.<eos> I'm amazed you noticed.<eos> We all did.
You don't wanna be here, all right, and you didn't do nothing wrong, you just got unlucky.<eos> You just help me out here, man, you get your shit straight, maybe we can get your ass out of here.<eos> Maybe we both could.<eos> Yeah, you hear me, don't you?<eos> Mm-hm, you do.
Go on, it's over.<eos> I know how difficult it is for you to open up to me and tell me these things.<eos> But it means the world to me.<eos> It means you love me.<eos> Yes, I do.
How do you know that?<eos> I saw you.<eos> I watched you.<eos> I know you love him.<eos> I do, too.
I saw you.<eos> I watched you.<eos> I know you love him.<eos> I do, too.<eos> We all do.
I mean, of course I haven't, obviously, because I live here.<eos> I've never been over there, where you live.<eos> Are you new here?<eos> -How did you know?<eos> -I don't.
Don't be messy.<eos> Done.<eos> Let's see.<eos> Okay. I thought you might finish quickly, so a little something extra.<eos> Done.
She said the world of men do not deserve you.<eos> They don't deserve our help, Steve.<eos> - It's not about deserve!<eos> - They do not deserve our help.<eos> Maybe, Maybe we don't!
Look at her and tell me I'm wrong.<eos> She is the perfect example of these humans... and unworthy of your sympathy in every way.<eos> Destroy her, Diana.<eos> You know that she deserves.<eos> That they all do.
Or you can go back to seeing how that lone bullshit works out for you, money man.<eos> Hey.<eos> - Hi.<eos> Joshua made you a letter... and he's very excited for you to read it.<eos> He did it all by himself, and...
It's over.<eos> Let us help you get back on your feet.<eos> Please.<eos> You wanna help me?<eos> Yeah, I do.
Yes, a good man who killed his wife for convenience.<eos> You know nothing.<eos> Always cow-eyed about your sainted mother.<eos> Or maybe it's about time you know about your mother.<eos> I do.
Do you know who blew up your ship?<eos> I've been thinking a lot about what happened, and... and I think we were right.<eos> There wasn't the time for such...<eos> And we have plenty of time.<eos> No, we don't.
I have the very same mark on me... from when I was taken prisoner in Africa.<eos> What is it?<eos> You tell me.<eos> You don't speak but you do have answers.<eos> You do.
- What?<eos> If I were caught passing company secrets to a Delaney...<eos> You're not going to get caught because I will protect you.<eos> You know, at the seminary, I was in love with you.<eos> Of course you do.
But Charlotte missed the game.<eos> Why are you giving them so much power over you?<eos> I am the power.<eos> Don't you get it?<eos> No. I don't.
Hey, there.<eos> Hey.<eos> You know me, right?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, of course, you do.
- I believe you did.<eos> - I did not say that.<eos> - I believe you did.<eos> - No. No, I didn't. I...<eos> - You did, Dick.
I'm sorry, but he's trying to shut down "Avenue Q." He says it's too controversial.<eos> Well, what's he want to replace it with?<eos> Don't tell me "Cats."<eos> You remember your first day of school?<eos> I do, actually.
I forget the rest.<eos> Okay. That's a wrap, boys.<eos> I'm meeting with Bellingham tomorrow to get him to sign off on Portland.<eos> I thought you already had approval.<eos> I do.
Does it look like I am masterminding the takedown of the Kensington Firm?<eos> Or perhaps if someone would stop standing there like a bloody waxwork.<eos> He really is magnificent, isn't he?<eos> Oh, you have no idea.<eos> No, I do.
This had now become a combat search-and-rescue mission in addition to the ongoing offensive operation.<eos> Spread out.<eos> - I need to get by you.<eos> Do you speak English?<eos> Hey, he does.
That's gotta be them right there.<eos> What is that, some kind of special FBI app?<eos> It's "Find My iPhone." I have Clay's password.<eos> You don't have my password, do you?<eos> Yeah, I do. "The Baker, 1980."
There's even a version of my life without Olly in it.<eos> Do you ever wonder what your life would be like if you could just change one thing?<eos> What if changing one thing made things worse?<eos> What if we hadn't met?<eos> But we did.
I think that and the coffin just killed your savings.<eos> All so you could have that nice open casket, get one last look at her pretty face.<eos> I'm sorry about Robbie, okay?<eos> He was a really good friend, and I know he loved you like crazy.<eos> So did Laura.
It is a treasure and a treat to welcome you all to my home and on my day, my favorite day of the year.<eos> When all is lavender and dew, reborn and restored. When we celebrate the earth...<eos> Hello, Shadow.<eos> Do I know you?<eos> Yes, you do.
Pale-skinned, blue-eyed.<eos> Hair so fair it's almost white.<eos> Wine-colored lips, full round breasts with veins running through them like a good cheese.<eos> Only when you were younger?<eos> You did alright last night.
Honey, our daughter is gone.<eos> Christ, Andy, I know that!<eos> I have to know why.<eos> I need to know why.<eos> And if you don't, I...
Should we move?<eos> Should we go somewhere and start new?<eos> And... give up the store?<eos> I'll give up the store, give up the house, everything... if I have you.<eos> But you do.
Right, right. Yeah.<eos> Uh, do you... Do you want a drink?<eos> I believe you promised me a drink, in fact.<eos> And a ride on your bike.<eos> I did, didn't I?
I was shitting myself.<eos> But she's not telling the truth about the way things happened.<eos> She's telling her truth.<eos> Why do you always act like you know?<eos> Because I do.
Stop it!<eos> I'm sorry. I'm sorry.<eos> No, just stop, okay?<eos> Did I hurt you?<eos> No, just don't.
But tell me what's going on, okay?<eos> Tell me what's wrong.<eos> You don't want to be with me.<eos> But I do.<eos> - I really do.
I'm just real sorry they're gone.<eos> Negan murdered Glenn and Abraham, beat them to death.<eos> Terrorized the Hilltop, set loose walkers just to make a point.<eos> I used to think the deal was something we could live with.<eos> A lot of us did.
I was... looking for something to read the other day.<eos> You can have the bullets.<eos> I didn't know you had a gun.<eos> I didn't.<eos> I do now.
All of my charts are in order.<eos> You need to make arrangements for some kind of medical care here, especially for my ongoing patients.<eos> I will.<eos> - I need to pack.<eos> - You don't.
You are smart, hot as hell, dignified as shit, and you don't suffer one goddamn fool.<eos> No one's gonna wanna watch you die.<eos> I don't wanna see that.<eos> So you don't have to.<eos> But someone does.
If Negan finds out they're planning something, they're gonna need help, even with those Scavengers on their side.<eos> Well, you'd have to decide right now, and it's a very tough decision.<eos> Why are you smiling?<eos> 'Cause I'm glad you're the one making it for us.<eos> How do I?
Is that...<eos> Me.<eos> I used to wear blue pants.<eos> When'd you make the leap to interdimensional travel?<eos> I didn't.
- Oh, my God.<eos> No, it's not you, Barry.<eos> I don't see myself with more family in the future.<eos> I thought you knew this.<eos> I do now.
Is there a place we could talk in private?<eos> That's... I didn't call the police.<eos> No, sir. It's...<eos> I'm investigating an automotive flapper in the driver of a Humvee registered to this Stussy Lots.<eos> Did vehicular damage to... Fine.
Just a few minutes.<eos> Well, it's just a quick call, just to catch up, innit?<eos> Be vague.<eos> I didn't mean to...<eos> No one ever does.
Well, sir, I work here, so that's...<eos> I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.<eos> Sir?<eos> You're gonna have to leave.<eos> I just did.
First proof of extraterrestrial life.<eos> And it's just more death.<eos> You still got a beat on that signal. That you guys intercepted leaving eros?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Of course we do.
And what vast font of battlefield wisdom. Are you drawing from, admiral?<eos> I advise that we deploy our fleet to secure any base. That might become a martian foothold.<eos> Madam.<eos> Do you concur?<eos> I do.
He's just always needed someone. To help him out with the world.<eos> And he picked you.<eos> Congrats.<eos> Do you know that old story, pinocchio?<eos> No, I don't.
We look out for each other.<eos> You sure he's clear on that?<eos> Pretty sure.<eos> You did hear the part about him throwing me off the ship. Without my helmet, right?<eos> I did.
Yep.<eos> National security right down the line.<eos> The informant is off-limits.<eos> So how do we talk to him?<eos> We don't.
"Are you advising the president-elect?"<eos> - She said no.<eos> - And you believe her?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I do.
-No.<eos> Tovah Rivlin, Mossad agent.<eos> I need what you have on her... Movements and contacts for the past two weeks.<eos> So, even if we had such information...<eos> You do.
Okay. I'll go down there and check it out.<eos> If that guy...<eos> If he's involved in the bombing, like those photos suggest, but he wasn't working with Sekou,<eos> I don't even know what we're saying here.<eos> I don't, either.
Carrie?<eos> Madame President-elect.<eos> Is something wrong?<eos> Children's Services has put Franny into foster care.<eos> I don't...
I knew where everything was heading. I-<eos> - I knew.<eos> And I pushed him toward that.<eos> I-I really-- I really don't like this.<eos> No one does.
He wants to discuss it with you on his show this afternoon.<eos> No debate, no prep, just two people talking.<eos> His words.<eos> Which, obviously, you don't want to do.<eos> Of course she doesn't.
Listen, okay?<eos> When Pallis gets here, you need to tell him what you just told me.<eos> I-I know...<eos> I know it won't be easy, but... at least I understand, now, what happened here.<eos> You don't.
I-I know...<eos> I know it won't be easy, but... at least I understand, now, what happened here.<eos> You don't.<eos> - Quinn...<eos> - You don't.
I'll find someone.<eos> She didn't deserve this, okay?<eos> - Any of it.<eos> She's...<eos> - No. No. No one does.
"The fault, Dear Brutus, is not in our stars,"<eos> "but in ourselves."<eos> Think Joel used to say that before he, uh, went into surgery.<eos> Joel loved him some Shakespeare.<eos> Yes, he did.
My words have no tune, but they're sincere.<eos> You have brought me back to life.<eos> - Then you owe me.<eos> - I do.<eos> I do.
The abbot... where is the abbot?<eos> Brother Trew.<eos> - Lady Gisela.<eos> - You appear to have news.<eos> Lady, I do.
You brought your book.<eos> It's not my book. It's Matt's.<eos> But it's about you.<eos> Are you finally gonna read it?<eos> - I already did.
His mate dragged his body into the cave so the dingoes wouldn't eat the corpse, made his way back to civilization.<eos> Burton was sitting at the front of the cave, not a scratch on him.<eos> Said he felt absolutely fine and that he was God.<eos> People don't actually believe this guy's God?<eos> Some do, sure.
Well, it's a lot to... to put on someone, asking for all that help.<eos> I mean, if it were me, I would just keep riding.<eos> Get as far from this as possible.<eos> But Kevin, he'll come back.<eos> He always does.
They have enough resources, just not enough pilots.<eos> So, I found a boat that would take me.<eos> No boats go directly from Australia to New York, so it took me a long time to get there.<eos> A long time.<eos> But I finally did.
He's also very paranoid.<eos> Carter, Grimes has already gotten away from you once.<eos> We can't let that happen again.<eos> Eric, you and I were operating alone because we didn't know who we could trust.<eos> Now we do.
They accessed the file identifying the Rangers who took out Bin-Khalid.<eos> And now most of them are dead.<eos> We ran a trace.<eos> The file was accessed from Nilaa's computer.<eos> I don't...
Bring Kevin in.<eos> Jerome tried to sell me out.<eos> And you're his little brother.<eos> So don't tell me you know nothing 'bout it.<eos> - I-I don't.
The terrorists, the people you did business with.<eos> They've kidnapped my son.<eos> CTU agents are on their way here now.<eos> They're gonna need your contacts, electronic files, anything you have that can help them find John.<eos> Henry, I did...
Y-You need to send an ambulance out to the estate.<eos> Right away.<eos> I need to take this.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> How we doing?
Uh, Mariana?<eos> Yeah, we based your credentials around an agent who's on leave, but we haven't had time to backstop everything.<eos> Will it get me through security or not?<eos> We think so, but I'd feel better if we had a little more time.<eos> Well, we don't, okay?
Just now, that man and several others wondered aloud whether the smartest thing to do wouldn't be killing you and throwing you in the sea rather than giving you another opportunity to fuck us!<eos> For reasons I can't begin to fathom, I argued against it.<eos> Bark at me again about braver, stronger, and smarter men, and I might decide to revisit the issue!<eos> If killing me seems like the smartest thing to do, then it is obvious to me none of you have any idea how to defeat Woodes Rogers.<eos> - And you do? !
Refuse... and he dies... along with the rest of the men who followed him here.<eos> And from what I understand, he is the one who matters most to you.<eos> The one with whom you might lead a life if you can set aside your pride in this moment.<eos> Do not make the same mistake I did.<eos> Do the deal.
The first was a young boy.<eos> Will was his name.<eos> His father was the detective assigned to my daughter's case.<eos> No one believed me.<eos> Not even my dad, but... she did.
- It is incredible.<eos> - Lito, this is a bit awkward.<eos> I thought your lawyer was gonna talk to you.<eos> I know. He said that I needed to talk to you.<eos> Oh, he did, did he?
They are all serving a purpose, Jennifer.<eos> Sebastian titan set the ball in motion when he conjured me to seduce young, lovely Maggie black.<eos> Oh, she tried to trap me.<eos> Didn't you?<eos> Yes, you did!
These are my questions.<eos> I'm not sure if you... if you pee after intercourse, but that can also help in preventing them.<eos> And, plus, you're pregnant.<eos> Do you know that?<eos> I do now.
What are you trying to say?<eos> There are people who think that what we did on my birthday...<eos> I don't know.<eos> You should know.<eos> And I do.
Take him down.<eos> They can't.<eos> Can you?<eos> I'm no use to them dead.<eos> - Do it now!
Ballistic gelatin, forensic-grade resin bones, a dozen or so aluminum alloy canes.<eos> Also chinos, reading glasses, and a cardigan.<eos> I don't want to know what you're building, do I?<eos> No.<eos> No, you do not.
Like I said, the struggle.<eos> That's why I'm here.<eos> If I needed to get to Yemen, that something you could help me with?<eos> I thought he was dead.<eos> So did everyone.
Ezra's still in New York, right?<eos> I-I'm not babysitting this pillow by myself.<eos> Okay, well, our place is loud enough already, Caleb snores.<eos> - No, he doesn't.<eos> - Yes, he does.
Wait, Spencer.<eos> Hanna and I aren't gonna let you down this time.<eos> I promise.<eos> I hope that that still means something.<eos> It does.
It's not manipulation.<eos> Even if it means you have to let him go.<eos> You need to let him go.<eos> I don't need to ask him who he loves, Ali, because I know he loves me.<eos> No, he doesn't.
Aren't we the "No Secrets" club?<eos> We're the "No Secrets Between Us" club.<eos> I think what they're doing here is smart.<eos> I mean, do we really believe there's going to be a "let's talk things out with the zombies" phase once the human population learns we exist?<eos> - I do.
Took a long time, but we finally caught you.<eos> Or maybe I just stopped running.<eos> Do you suffer, Niklaus, as my wife suffered?<eos> As my child suffered?<eos> Yeah, you do.
We always do.<eos> John?<eos> Hey, hey, it's ok.<eos> Clarke, you're not acting like someone who just saved the world.<eos> Because we didn't.
This imposter stole her Flame. No.<eos> Wanheda saved us, all of us...<eos> Grounder and Skaikru.<eos> There would have been nothing to save us from if not for you. Azgeda has no authority here.<eos> We do now.
He always sprays Sunday.<eos> And in most of these area, hog houses and turkey house, it's in a black area or the Hispanic area.<eos> It's either or.<eos> Do you think it's also a civil rights issue?<eos> Yes, yes, I do.
Don't ask me what it means or what my mum was drinking.<eos> May the gods protect her poor drunk soul.<eos> Wait, hey.<eos> You want a little drop?<eos> Yeah, you do.
How about you?<eos> What?<eos> Let me handle this.<eos> Your baron said we were free to go.<eos> What you and your men did to those dolls.
Yes.<eos> Who told you?<eos> Nate.<eos> He just wants to know if Frank knew I was pregnant.<eos> Did he?
No, she told you to be a good little soldier and take the fall for her.<eos> You deaf, bitch?<eos> I asked you a question.<eos> Why'd you kill that boy?<eos> I didn't.
Well, she's my kid, too, Cindy.<eos> I have the weekends and...<eos> Well, no, I have the weekends and I don't want a Wednesday afternoon.<eos> Why would I want that?<eos> Yeah, nobody does.
All those years we built this place together.<eos> And all that time I've supported you... looked up to you, deferred to you.<eos> Because I always thought you had the best interests of the firm in mind.<eos> I have.<eos> You did.
- I'd watch what I say if I were you.<eos> - Who you think you are?<eos> You should be kissing my ass right now.<eos> Me and my family. We built this whole business.<eos> We all did. Together.
They also threatened to kill Tetch if we tried to take him back by force.<eos> Half of these would bankrupt the city.<eos> The alternative being there's no city left to bankrupt.<eos> We don't have any cards to play, partner.<eos> GORDON: Yes, we do.
I thought it should be personal.<eos> You were just trying to make me think I had the upper hand.<eos> (chuckles): It all fell into place.<eos> How did you know that Barbara would show up at the warehouse?<eos> I didn't.
I had the situation under control.<eos> She told me that prometheus<eos> Now whether or not that is true, she was going to give us valuable intel on him. She's playing you, Oliver.<eos> I understand that you're suspicious of her, and I know this Laurel is from another earth, that this is not our Laurel, but we don't know why.<eos> We don't.
I don't know--<eos> I know you've seen this scumbag.<eos> He lives in this neighborhood!<eos> I don't know everybody, dude.<eos> I don't!
The good, the bad, and the ugly I know, and you don't need to punish yourself or isolate yourself, but what you need to do is stop pushing me away because I'm not going anywhere, Oliver!<eos> Do you get that?<eos> What do you want me to do, John?<eos> I've told you what I am, who I am, and even if you don't believe it, I do.<eos> I do.
That's why you'll have to break in.<eos> It shouldn't be too hard for Overwatch and Mr. Terrific, who could pull off a heist at Kord.<eos> You told them about our operation?<eos> I didn't.<eos> - How did you...
He's like a brother. We look out for each other.<eos> You sure he's clear on that?<eos> Pretty sure.<eos> You did hear the part about him throwing me off the ship without my helmet, right?<eos> -I did.
Because when you wanna die, you give away all your things because you're not gonna need them.<eos> After all, look at me. She's already given me away.<eos> Claire... Trust me, your daughter is not suicidal.<eos> You don't know that.<eos> Yes, I do.
Yeah, you're probably right.<eos> But you can't control what he does, and maybe... maybe he really loves her.<eos> He doesn't.<eos> - Well, you don't know that.<eos> - Yeah, I do.
You deserved better.<eos> Both of you.<eos> Mom.<eos> You should really sleep, Sam.<eos> The dead don't.
"All I know is there's more than I know."<eos> Yeah, I think that might sound wiser than it is.<eos> Okay, wiseass.<eos> So you know what happens after you die?<eos> Yes, I do.
I did.<eos> And I'm not.<eos> Shadow made my heart beat again.<eos> Why do men like anal sex?<eos> 'Cause women don't.
Stay as long as you like. You'll be safe here.<eos> No, we really should get goin'. Nonsense.<eos> Nonsense!<eos> You're gonna love it here.<eos> Everyone does.
He's not one to miss out on the fun, so what does he want?<eos> A puppy?<eos> How the hell should I know?<eos> I didn't talk to him.<eos> No, but Lee did.
I could have lived a life with the woman I loved.<eos> I could have been happy.<eos> No, Ed.<eos> You would have killed her.<eos> Just like you did the other one!
What are you doing?<eos> What does it look like I'm doing?<eos> I'm leaving.<eos> Well, actually, I'm resigning, and then I'm leaving.<eos> Don't.
He's obsessed with finding the answer, which is an easy solution for us.<eos> Once he does, we'll get rid of him.<eos> I promise.<eos> And how's him causing a scene at the theater help us?<eos> It doesn't.
Let's go.<eos> Let me get this straight.<eos> So, this limo pulls up literally out of nowhere, and this creepy lady tells you to get in because<eos> "you could be so much more"?<eos> And you did?
Half of these would bankrupt the city.<eos> The alternative being there's no city left to bankrupt.<eos> We don't have any cards to play, partner.<eos> We got no moves.<eos> Yes, we do.
I thought it should be personal.<eos> You were just trying to make me think I had the upper hand.<eos> It all fell into place.<eos> How did you know that Barbara would show up at the warehouse?<eos> I didn't.
Just, uh, hanging out.<eos> What're you... what're you thinking about?<eos> Wally.<eos> He wants me to stay here with him.<eos> Yeah, he does.
You gotta take the good with the bad, no matter what.<eos> - Right.<eos> - And that includes... telling your fathers how you two feel about each other.<eos> All right, you make a convincing argument.<eos> - You do.
On me, let's go.<eos> Thank you.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - I know how hard this must be.<eos> No, you don't.
We're gonna get her back.<eos> That's them.<eos> They're at the old Dressler Factory. Okay, we know where they are.<eos> That's something.<eos> So what do we do?
Wh...<eos> I call Barry Allen to the stand.<eos> Raise your right hand, please.<eos> You swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth?<eos> I do, yes.
I don't care what I have to do.<eos> I swear to you, I will find you a cure.<eos> Caitlin, I love you.<eos> I don't love you, Julian.<eos> I never did.
How can you be so sure?<eos> It's not about being sure.<eos> It's about using what we've got.<eos> Unless you have a plan âDâ.<eos> No, I don't.
You are going to stay alive so you can make all of this right.<eos> Cutting it pretty close.<eos> Story of my life.<eos> How do I know you're gonna keep up your end?<eos> You don't.
I just can't see it.<eos> Ten years from now... 20, 50... we're gonna be living entirely different lives, and we can't just... ignore that.<eos> But... it doesn't mean we have to just... throw all this away because it's not what we wanted or expected.<eos> I just have no idea how to make this right.<eos> I don't either.
He doesn't wear the cape or carry the pitchfork, so maybe that's just his way of being dramatic.<eos> Things have a way of getting bloody with Cade.<eos> We may not have another chance, so... do you want to tell me why you were planning on leaving town?<eos> Nope.<eos> I don't.
So I am extremely grateful that you're even sitting here being my friend right now.<eos> Bonnie, I love you so much.<eos> So much.<eos> Please know that.<eos> I do.
Especially those who are secretly my mother.<eos> Well, I think you'll make an exception when you hear what I have to say.<eos> Well, spit it out.<eos> I don't have an eternity here.<eos> Oh, yes. Actually, I do.
And I mean you, not her.<eos> Nothing happened after you left.<eos> But what I'm saying is things have changed now, since we had our moment.<eos> We didn't have a moment.<eos> Yes we did.
- is your ass beat!<eos> - Mom, please.<eos> - You don't want none of this.<eos> - Please, please. No.<eos> - Yeah. - She don't.
All you've done is lie, Eve.<eos> To me.<eos> To Harry.<eos> Does he know you put this on my wrist?<eos> He doesn't, does he?
It's mercy.<eos> Something you showed none of your victims.<eos> I don't want that mercy.<eos> JOHNNY: No, what I'm saying is, stop shutting me out.<eos> - ANNA: I hardly do that.
I'm screaming inside.<eos> If that makes you feel any better.<eos> - Actually, no.<eos> - You got this, Dana.<eos> No, of course I do.
- Break-in?<eos> - That's right.<eos> Went after your copper wire, from the look of it.<eos> There was a time... remember? When we could leave our doors unlocked.<eos> I certainly do.
Excuse me.<eos> -Sorry.<eos> Please raise your right hand.<eos> Do you swear or affirm to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth?<eos> I do.
And I don't know if... he slipped and fell or had a heart attack or met someone who didn't like the way he looked...<eos> I don't know.<eos> And even after all these years, not knowing how he passed or where he is...<eos> I wish it didn't matter.<eos> But it does.
He is working against it.<eos> It's simple.<eos> Snatch, grab, and go.<eos> It'd be a lot simpler if we had real bullets.<eos> - They do.
I want to know the second you get a hit.<eos> If we find her, what's gonna happen to her?<eos> Justice.<eos> I loved her once.<eos> In some ways, I still do.
I did this on my own.<eos> I personally told the art department to do this for me, all by myself.<eos> So instead of withstanding rubble, the Rumbrella needs to repel...<eos> Did Van Photoshop himself into that?<eos> Yes, he did.
Why would they want to kill you?<eos> My money's on the Iranians.<eos> You don't believe her own agency would be trying to kill her?<eos> You do?<eos> My God, you do.
Weatherbee just asked me if I knew anything about Jason.<eos> And?<eos> What did you say?<eos> Nothing.<eos> That I didn't.
Jason.<eos> He's gone...<eos> I know.<eos> I know he is.<eos> No, you don't.
But Mr. Andrews still doesn't know that Daddy is the buyer?<eos> All of which is to say the timing of this shower is just...<eos> It's not ideal.<eos> Plus, I can't believe Alice even wants to come, from what you've told me.<eos> She doesn't.
Until you're sick of slumming it with me, or until Archie changes his mind and says he wants to be with you?<eos> Valerie, hey... - I'm looking for Melody.<eos> - No, no, no, can we talk?<eos> I just wanted to say what if... What if we made a mistake?<eos> First of all, we didn't do anything.
Coming up to me with your concern.<eos> You don't get to do that anymore.<eos> Come on.<eos> You didn't choose me.<eos> Nobody does.
That I shouldn't marry Charlie?<eos> Because yesterday, it seemed like you...<eos> I'm thinking we have a lot of footage...<eos> Thousands of hours to go through.<eos> No, we don't.
I think you should stop shouting at these kids, Mr. Rankin.<eos> They've done us all a big favor.<eos> Saved your job.<eos> How'd you know that would work?<eos> I didn't.
Oh, I love it!<eos> Signs of indecision appear early in life, Holden.<eos> Mom, Charlie doesn't want to see<eos> - what happened when I was six.<eos> - Yes, I do!
Mom, Charlie doesn't want to see<eos> - what happened when I was six.<eos> - Yes, I do!<eos> - Yes, thank you.<eos> - Yes, I do!
Are you prepared to accept that truth?<eos> Yes, I am.<eos> Will you safeguard the secrets of our movement, even from friends and family?<eos> And do you accept that the punishment for violating your oaths will fall not just upon you, but upon everyone you love?<eos> - I do.
Well, some of your supporters have just beaten the living daylights out of him.<eos> - You're mistaken.<eos> - I saw it, Mrs Pettybon.<eos> But you did ever so well.<eos> - Didn't she, Reverend?
Now, I just need to take a minute and make some calls.<eos> I will get this figured out.<eos> And to answer your question... no, I didn't do it.<eos> I didn't ask you that.<eos> You did.
Let me in.<eos> What do you want, Liz?<eos> What do I want?<eos> I want to help.<eos> No. No, you don't.
- I warned her.<eos> Now I'm on the road four nights a week, and I have to wear these tight, tight uniforms,<eos> - and I can't gain any weight. - And she has to work<eos> - for jerks like me.<eos> - With. We don't technically
Should have been carved by someone who knew his face.<eos> Everyone who knew his face is dead.<eos> We're not.<eos> They say you killed Joffrey.<eos> Did you?
You must know there's no way around that.<eos> Daenerys is not her father.<eos> She's even willing to suspend the hostilities if Cersei agrees to certain terms.<eos> If you want Cersei to bend the knee, you can ask her yourself.<eos> I... I don't.
Should have known to come straight to the Street of Steel.<eos> Aren't you worried about the gold cloaks?<eos> Haven't been here in years.<eos> Why should they recognize me?<eos> Sometimes I hardly do.
Right here, right now, I am the President.<eos> And I'm telling you this isn't a death penalty case anymore.<eos> Do I have to make myself more clear?<eos> Because I certainly can.<eos> Do I?
I love you, Deacon.<eos> I love you, Rayna.<eos> Don't leave me.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Don't!
So you're gonna put her back in the streets?<eos> No... Look.<eos> We know she has parents.<eos> - We know that now.<eos> - No, no, she doesn't.
I can't believe all this is happening.<eos> I was really just trying to stand up for him.<eos> I know that.<eos> He knows it too.<eos> No one else does.
- I know.<eos> Disrespected the cops.<eos> And they think I'm the worst.<eos> And so does Clay.<eos> No, he does not.
Why should he make his own sandwich?<eos> - A guy that's loaned us $75,000?<eos> - What?<eos> Well, I know I'm not supposed to say anything...<eos> Then don't!
But Jake didn't kill her.<eos> Because she's an innocent victim.<eos> Well, that's never been a problem for Jake.<eos> Jake believes my father might have some bigger plan, and that Jennifer could be the key to figuring it out. What?<eos> And you don't?
Some people have it, Red.<eos> A brilliancy, charisma, breeding.<eos> Of course, the strong jaw and glorious hairline don't exactly hurt, either.<eos> Fitz had it.<eos> Frankie does, too.
This is the Oval!<eos> I was born for this!<eos> This is mine!<eos> You don't want to win this way.<eos> Yes, I do!
I was born for this!<eos> This is mine!<eos> You don't want to win this way.<eos> Yes, I do!<eos> You don't!
To genetically improve the human race!<eos> We all contribute and we all benefit.<eos> I-I had some pretty beneficial science stolen from me.<eos> Do you know a Rachel Duncan?<eos> Oh, we do now.
I know, but specifically, she's trapping.<eos> Okay.<eos> This is dire, Donnie.<eos> He needs some ideas of a concrete plan on how to save Kira.<eos> No, no, no. I don't, Donnie.
There are plenty of Chinese restaurants, laundries...<eos> Now who's racist? No.<eos> Because those are places where other Chinese people already work.<eos> They don't speak English, dumb-ass.<eos> I do little bit.
Okay, here's the address.<eos> Sending the location now.<eos> Squad, 1305, copy that.<eos> Who lives there?<eos> GOSS: Who doesn't, more like it.
If I win, she goes.<eos> They all go.<eos> They are bound by ancient law to leave this planet in peace.<eos> - She's not gonna win.<eos> - But what if she does?
- There's too much at stake to wait.<eos> - Mother!<eos> WINN: No!<eos> You said it worked.<eos> Oh, it does.
They may be right.<eos> It was definitely your ex-husband, ma'am.<eos> No question.<eos> How does that make sense?<eos> 'Cause it... it doesn't.
Oh, yes!<eos> And it's going, "Wah wah wah..."<eos> - Oh, God. The pot's kicking in.<eos> - No, no, no, it doesn't affect me.<eos> Yeah, it does, Mom.
That's one way to handle it.<eos> That was a big swing.<eos> What a grand ending to your guys's union.<eos> And also... Super Nintendo. You wanna play when we get home tonight?<eos> No. No, I don't.
Beauty or chips. I like chips.<eos> So did she.<eos> So that's OK.<eos> And how does that in any way explain why you keep coming to my lectures?<eos> Yeah, it doesn't really, does it?
- Hey, you like cinnamon?<eos> We got some cinnamon sticks right over here.<eos> You know where cinnamon comes from?<eos> - Do you?<eos> - Actually, I do.
- No, I mean,<eos> I don't know him personally.<eos> He's the guy from the park.<eos> Monroe, do you know him or not?<eos> Yes! We both do!
It's how Wesen have stayed in secret for so long.<eos> I know it sounds callous, but it's how our community works.<eos> And you know this Gevatter Tod?<eos> Do you know how to make contact?<eos> Yeah, we do.
C-Cover it.<eos> What about this is so funny to you, huh?<eos> Look, you remember when you and Pope duct taped this to that shopping cart when we were kids, with the, uh, Roman candles on the side?<eos> Sent it down Quarry Hill?<eos> - Yeah, I do.
Before she left, I offered her a lifeline, and now I'm gonna offer the same thing to you.<eos> We appreciate your offer, but...<eos> But what?<eos> But we don't need your charity.<eos> Yes, you do.
What does that say about character and fitness?<eos> You make a good point.<eos> And if I were you, I'd be prepared with some others, 'cause I'd say one day soon, you're gonna have to make your case.<eos> And do you think I have a better chance of making my case if I work for my father instead of at Pearson Specter Litt?<eos> Yes, I do.
I've had a rough day.<eos> I'm gonna leave you alone but not before I tell you what I tried to tell your old boss.<eos> You want to do good, be my guest, but do it in another profession, because if I ever even catch wind of you trying to get work at any of these places, you can bet your ass I will do everything I can to stop it.<eos> Did you know what Louis was up to?<eos> I did.
I... I walked in on you!<eos> I saw you having sex with another woman!<eos> My wife! Maybe you didn't, maybe you did.<eos> What?<eos> Maybe you did not.
Do you think it's love?<eos> Yeah... and oral.<eos> That's not exactly a Rachael Ray Show kind of joke, but, look, they love it, they love it.<eos> Oral, Elsa. Elsa, do you think oral, is that a part of a happy marriage?<eos> Everybody ha... Everybody does it. Sex?
I came to check on you.<eos> I'm fine.<eos> I'm f-f-fine.<eos> Uh, are you sure you still want...<eos> Uh, I-I do.
Eliot, there are certain student/teacher boundaries which I'd prefer not to cross.<eos> So what am I supposed to do, Henry?<eos> What did you think was going to happen when you dove headfirst into another world?<eos> I thought I'd die.<eos> But you didn't.
Do not put your foot in the pool, or the career is done.<eos> And I'm not... I'm not messing with you.<eos> - Oh, God. - I don't care what you're saying.<eos> Okay, you did it!<eos> You did it! You did the foot.
You're fab, you're totally gear.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I don't know, man, why don't you just call it Sophia's Joint. Change it when you think of something better.<eos> We all know what happened to Skeleton Key when they re-launched Miss Theo Goes Vintage.<eos> We do?
That jumpsuit is good.<eos> It'll sell.<eos> Kaavi's website is perfect.<eos> You believe me when I say it's gonna be okay. Right?<eos> I do.
I mean, is there even an album?<eos> You're so beautiful.<eos> Stop it.<eos> God, I fucked up.<eos> You did.
Got it.<eos> Who are you?<eos> I am the alpha and the omega...<eos> Could I start one more time, please? That...<eos> I didn't...
Come on ass face, say Mississippi.<eos> Say it.<eos> Stop!<eos> Or what?<eos> Just... don't.
My dog died.<eos> So when are you two coming back to work for me?<eos> We're not.<eos> I didn't know you had a dog.<eos> I don't.
Better than almost anyone else I know.<eos> Not anymore.<eos> People change.<eos> What?<eos> No, they don't.
I thought that maybe, if you have this...<eos> Every little bit helps.<eos> All right.<eos> Hey. Hey... I got to go.<eos> No, you don't.
- The Ark is our ark.<eos> - I get it.<eos> Ok, so freeze-dried meat until we can grow our own food.<eos> We got oxygen scrubbers, but hot do we store enough water for 500 people?<eos> We don't.
What the f...<eos> Guess now we know what your power is.<eos> - He's here.<eos> - We don't know that.<eos> Okay, now we do.
Preparations here are nearly completed.<eos> That is nearly a satisfying report.<eos> If you're done playing with your food, there is still work to be done.<eos> Metaphor.<eos> Well done.
We'll return in a moment.<eos> Say it.<eos> - No.<eos> - Say it.<eos> - I already did.
I know.<eos> It's that way.<eos> Kill me already.<eos> Hey, you ever finish the Saunders report?<eos> Of course you did.
Yes, Father?<eos> Listen to me very carefully, son.<eos> You know I've always loved you.<eos> Only ever wanted what was best for you.<eos> Yeah, of course I do.
How can she stomach it?<eos> The memory of seeing me shoot that woman...<eos> Um, you know, the reason I... wanted to get closer to you in the first place was to try to understand what you two felt for each other...<eos> You and Jemma.<eos> - And I finally do. - Yeah.
What?<eos> What happens when someone dies?<eos> If they're good, they go to Heaven.<eos> Who knows if they're good?<eos> God does.
This is a trifling matter, madam.<eos> Take your scandal sheet and go.<eos> Forgive me.<eos> I do not have the superior force of male reason willing my actions.<eos> As you and your powerful friends do.
Emily Lacey is laughing at your fate.<eos> Mumma, she can't have known what would happen.<eos> She would have killed you stone dead if it had suited her purpose.<eos> Let's forget she was ever here.<eos> You do that, my treasure.
I was born a free Englishman.<eos> Foundling.<eos> I'm sorry for assuming...<eos> This is the trinket my mother left, to know me by when she returned.<eos> Only she never did.
But you don't know that, Moira, okay?<eos> You don't know that.<eos> It could happen.<eos> Okay, all right, um...<eos> If it does...
Harvey, he's the goddamn CEO.<eos> He knew.<eos> He kept it from us, and he kept it from the guys buying his company.<eos> - You don't know that.<eos> - Yes, I do.
And more importantly, why'd you need the sale to go through so quickly?<eos> I told you, I have another opportunity.<eos> And what if I said the real reason was you knew you vodka business was about to be sued for using another brand's recipe?<eos> I would say I did not know that.<eos> - Well, now you do.
I don't have anyone else.<eos> [dramatic music]<eos> [elevator dings]<eos> Harvey, tell me you got some good news.<eos> I do.
No, Harvey.<eos> She wants both of us.<eos> And she's not going to stop until she gets both of us.<eos> - You don't know that.<eos> - Yes, I do.
I was all by myself.<eos> That sounds safe. Flammable material...<eos> It was magical. Yeah.<eos> It was very romantic by myself.<eos> So, uh, in college, did you and Moira ever...
We don't have our powers, and you're optimistic how?<eos> Because they need us to be.<eos> See, this is what I've been telling you.<eos> Kara, you know, if you go looking for trouble, you will always find it.<eos> And you do.
Let's.<eos> Let's talk about when I get out of this pathetic prison and these silly little cuffs.<eos> When I fry Supergirl from the inside out.<eos> You think she'll scream as she cooks?<eos> I do.
We don't know anything, all right?<eos> Hank, are you sure you can't get anything from this guy?<eos> Cadmus must've found a way to shield his thoughts from me.<eos> But we will find something, Winn.<eos> We always do.
A heads up next time would be nice before you arrest my friend.<eos> Come on, you know that's not how this works.<eos> I don't intervene with your job and you don't question mine.<eos> You better have proof.<eos> She doesn't.
Your mother can change.<eos> You just have to talk to her.<eos> People don't really change.<eos> Sure they do.<eos> You did.
Yeah, get in.<eos> Why me?<eos> You warned the aliens about Cadmus.<eos> - You want to help people.<eos> - I do.
But then you made reference to something about two very close friends that's nobody's business, including yours.<eos> And you even said so yourself, Ken, that you have an awfully big mouth.<eos> I lost a dear friend.<eos> I loved Tim.<eos> Everybody did.
My concerns are with my child.<eos> And as for you, I can imagine no better revenge than leaving you to the endless struggle to prove yourself my better.<eos> You're welcome, by the way.<eos> So you knew this Crescent girl?<eos> I did.
I hope it brings you peace.<eos> Good-bye, Marcel.<eos> Do one thing for me.<eos> Tell your daughter she doesn't need to fear me.<eos> She never did.
The main gas line's got to be down here.<eos> At least it'll help torch the place faster, unless you prefer a slow burn.<eos> Thought you wanted to wait it out.<eos> [gas hissing]<eos> Do you?
Don't you like it?<eos> My own tongue is in there.<eos> Don't tell your mistress about us - understand?<eos> The doctor he do seem fond of her.<eos> Er, he do.
My own tongue is in there.<eos> Don't tell your mistress about us - understand?<eos> The doctor he do seem fond of her.<eos> Er, he do.<eos> Everyone, everyone do.
Well, actually, because I felt like it.<eos> - What if I steal it from you?<eos> - On you go, then.<eos> I don't know how it works.<eos> Well, neither did I.
This is a great day out.<eos> I mean, come on, admit it.<eos> You love it.<eos> Did I say I didn't love it?<eos> Yes, I do.
Sleep well.<eos> OK...<eos> Maybe before you do, you should check on your friend, who hasn't been seen for a day and who has strange music coming out of his room.<eos> They said he just does that.<eos> Nobody "just does" anything.
I think it's really dangerous to seek personal fulfillment through romantic relationships.<eos> I do.
Jessica.<eos> What?<eos> I really like you.<eos> Yeah, Boone.<eos> Of course, you do.
What?<eos> I really like you.<eos> Yeah, Boone.<eos> Of course, you do.<eos> Everybody does.
I take it you're not coming, then?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Don't you want a life of excitement?<eos> Adventure, wonder?<eos> Yeah, I really do. Um...
One day, Samuel, you're going to be governor here, master of all Virginia.<eos> I know it and I love you.<eos> Not many people could see the kindness in my brother.<eos> He wouldn't let them.<eos> I did.
There isn't a more true soul...<eos> Mercy...<eos> Forgive me.<eos> Please.<eos> I do, Ma'am.
Mercy...<eos> Forgive me.<eos> Please.<eos> I do, Ma'am.<eos> I surely do.
To raise money for a business venture.<eos> One that hit big, I might add.<eos> I found that deal, by the way.<eos> I almost got rich.<eos> But you didn't.
I hate everyone.<eos> Anyone... laughing or smiling or... being alive is fucking offensive to me and they should all just fucking die.<eos> And eventually, I'm just gonna burn up from rage and then I'll just be dust.<eos> And I don't know how to make it stop.<eos> I do.
- Vamo. - Stop that!<eos> Please!<eos> Help! Help!<eos> No.<eos> Don't.
We have no way to generate water.<eos> The harder number is 400.<eos> Can you really sentence 400 more of our own people to death?<eos> We don't have a choice.<eos> What if you do?
That's not so bad.<eos> - That's the application fee.<eos> - Oh, yeah.<eos> Lisa, do you see the rings of Saturn?<eos> I do.
So there's really no way to just... take it all back?<eos> Your Majesty, one cannot simply take back<eos> - a declaration of war.<eos> - Good.<eos> Because I don't.
They only ask questions post-mortem.<eos> But our ace is you.<eos> Once we nab prints and drop the wards, you travel straight in.<eos> You really don't think a bank vault, of all places, has anti-traveler protection?<eos> Oh, they do.
- Yes. - Listen to high king Bambi.<eos> - You're alive.<eos> - Nice of you to join us, asshole.<eos> - Really does sound like you got it all handled.<eos> - I do.
Yes, we are asking for it, but we are not getting it.<eos> Who is the "bandit"?<eos> -Girls, watch your tongue.<eos> -What do you mean by that, Dilbeste?<eos> You did all kinds of things.
-Okay, pasha.<eos> -What did I just say?<eos> -What did you say, pasha?<eos> Did I not say "don't call me pasha"?<eos> -Yes, you did.
-What did I just say?<eos> -What did you say, pasha?<eos> Did I not say "don't call me pasha"?<eos> -Yes, you did.<eos> -"Yes, you did."
When are we going to marry these lovely women?<eos> What are you doing, bro?<eos> Why are you so upset?<eos> By the command of God, the tradition of the Prophet, the opinion of the imam of our sect, and in front of our pasha and the witnesses, do you accept to marry these ministers?<eos> Yes, we do.
Why are you so upset?<eos> By the command of God, the tradition of the Prophet, the opinion of the imam of our sect, and in front of our pasha and the witnesses, do you accept to marry these ministers?<eos> Yes, we do.<eos> -Do you accept?<eos> -Yes, we do.
Yes, we do.<eos> -Do you accept?<eos> -Yes, we do.<eos> -Do you accept?<eos> -Yes, we do!
-Do you accept?<eos> -Yes, we do!<eos> Ministers, do you accept to marry these women sitting next to you by approving the declared prices and with your free will?<eos> -Do you accept?<eos> -Yes, we do.
Ministers, do you accept to marry these women sitting next to you by approving the declared prices and with your free will?<eos> -Do you accept?<eos> -Yes, we do.<eos> -Do you accept?<eos> -Yes, we do.
-Tumble?<eos> -Yes, tumble.<eos> Do you know the grip on the bridge?<eos> Grip?<eos> I don't.
Do you know the handle on the boiler?<eos> No.<eos> Do you know the wardrobe?<eos> Wardrobe?<eos> I don't.
But you can still give me a bath.<eos> It's important to look beautiful.<eos> Let's do it.<eos> Mister magistrate, do you accept to marry Nurdane?<eos> -Yes, I do.
Let's do it.<eos> Mister magistrate, do you accept to marry Nurdane?<eos> -Yes, I do.<eos> -Do you accept?<eos> -Yes, I do.
-Yes, I do.<eos> -Do you accept?<eos> -Yes, I do.<eos> -Do you accept?<eos> Yes, I do.
Always.<eos> Megan, will you have this man to be your husband, to love and to comfort, to honor and to keep in sickness and in health for as long as you both shall live?<eos> I do.<eos> And do you, Robert?<eos> Yes, I do.
- So I won, right?<eos> We put you through three tests.<eos> You failed.<eos> Wait, what?<eos> No, I didn't.
I cannot bug anyone who could knock me unconscious.<eos> So that leaves you.<eos> - You forgot Five.<eos> - Nope.<eos> I didn't.
You're still flesh and blood.<eos> You can't last forever without oxygen.<eos> I don't need forever.<eos> You don't get to make this call.<eos> Yeah, actually, I do.
Your feelings for her were a weakness.<eos> The people on that ship were your friends, your family even, for a time.<eos> I understand that.<eos> But none of them can possibly grasp what you must do now to save the House of Ishida.<eos> Not like I do.
- or something like that.<eos> - Just stop it.<eos> Did you really think you had a shot with me?<eos> I didn't... I...<eos> Of course you did.
Your feelings for her were a weakness.<eos> The people on that ship were your friends, your family even, for a time.<eos> I understand that.<eos> But none of them can possibly grasp what you must do now to save the House of Ishida.<eos> Not like I do.
I can leave, but you know I'll be back.<eos> Now that we know you're here, we will find you...<eos> Eventually.<eos> I know you.<eos> Yes, you do.
You wanna stay here on our ship?<eos> It's... it's not like we wouldn't pull our weight.<eos> Solara's pretty handy.<eos> And obviously, you know what I bring to the table.<eos> We do?
Yeah.<eos> How'd you know her name?<eos> You told us.<eos> No, I didn't.<eos> Yeah, you did.
Teku.<eos> You know me?<eos> Yes, in a way.<eos> - You have his memories.<eos> - I did.
Killing people's not complicated. It's simple.<eos> Do you see?<eos> You understand this world. You understand me.<eos> That's why I picked you.<eos> But I didn't...
They trust me.<eos> They came here not to get eaten. I wouldn't flatter yourself.<eos> Yeah, but they're staying 'cause I said I'd protect them from you.<eos> And how are you going to do that?<eos> Please don't do this.
Do it and I'll trade places with you.<eos> Why would you do that?<eos> I was on the last ship off Eros I didn't do enough.<eos> I had a brother on Eros.<eos> We all did.
You just said it.<eos> No. No, no, no.<eos> It was Barbara.<eos> Barbara just called you Dadushki.<eos> She did?
Oh, you think so?<eos> You were playing it pretty cool, Maroline.<eos> Ooh, oops. Oh, don't worry, you can ruin everything in here.<eos> I don't care.<eos> I do.
You lying to me now?<eos> Ma...<eos> I was with Caroline last night.<eos> But I didn't see him naked.<eos> I did.
What happened?<eos> The pneumonia was gonna take you out, but we couldn't give you the cure until your combat wounds had healed a bit.<eos> What happened with Blaine?<eos> Did the memory serum work?<eos> It didn't.
At some point, all fathers disappoint their sons.<eos> And then you become a father and you realize that sons disappoint as well.<eos> I haven't seen Ryder since the night he betrayed me.<eos> I raised him to take power.<eos> And he did.
I'm not an idiot.<eos> But these people, they're delusional.<eos> And, quite frankly, they're selfish.<eos> You think people trying to resist this nightmare are selfish?<eos> Yeah, I do, actually.
As you know, in addition to tomorrow's regular schedule, the United States will be introducing an initiative that would reduce NATO's nuclear arsenal.<eos> Now, I want to be absolutely clear that this is a proposed weapons-reduction change, not a change in doctrine.<eos> And it's entirely predicated upon the Russian Federation scaling back its strategic nuclear weapons in proportional response to NATO's actions, something that the Russian president has assured me he is ready to do.<eos> What, you believe him, Cornelius?<eos> Yeah, I do.
How will you react to her when you are reunited?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Reunited.<eos> - You know where she is.<eos> - I do.
Enhanced interrogation.<eos> He knows.<eos> Kurt and I go way back, don't we, buddy?<eos> I thought you said you didn't know anything...<eos> I didn't, Jane.
Well, I mean... you really wanna move to Colorado?<eos> Well, experience in other offices would give me a shot at an executive position someday.<eos> Anyway, you said you wanted me to take a desk job.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yes, I did.
You do?<eos> You know what it's like to find out that the person you've been sleeping with is a terrorist?<eos> To have someone plan these dates and give you these amazing, useless gifts, and then kill a bunch of your co-workers and your friends?<eos> To be so blinded by all of your feelings you just, you miss all the signs?<eos> I do, actually.
When I told her I loved her.<eos> What?<eos> I just told her what she wanted to hear so she wouldn't kill us.<eos> I didn't feel anything.<eos> Maybe I never did.
Thanks for convincing me not to fast today.<eos> All right, so be honest.<eos> How religious are you?<eos> You really go to prayer and stuff?<eos> I do the Friday prayer here and there.
No.<eos> How do I get... I just want to...<eos> Sleep.<eos> And we both know who that angry boy was.<eos> - We do?
I was...<eos> David's doctor. I...<eos> I went to the hospital to look for you.<eos> They said you didn't exist.<eos> I do.
Thank you.<eos> Dr. Cassandra Railly to the ER.<eos> Dr. Railly to the ER.<eos> I thought you didn't want to see me.<eos> I don't.
You went to the semolina lady?<eos> Got some creste Di Gallo.<eos> And the last bottle of that olive oil you like.<eos> The sun-dried tomato crack?<eos> Well done, you.
Someone whose allegiances you can't trust.<eos> I can't be with a person like that.<eos> ♪ vanishing act ♪<eos> I thought Panabaker told Cooper you'd never be reinstated.<eos> She did, why?
You're not.<eos> Never occurred to me, all that time, that he didn't even...<eos> He really didn't even miss me.<eos> - You don't know that.<eos> - Oh, I do now.
I'm so sorry about all of this.<eos> Roman, I understand that you're angry.<eos> But I need your help.<eos> A friend of mine is missing, and you may know where she is.<eos> No, I don't.
No.<eos> I don't think so, uh...<eos> I don't know.<eos> Do you recognize this man?<eos> Yes, I do.
That's why you couldn't kill me before and why you can't do it now.<eos> Stop talking!<eos> Do this... and you will become everything you hate.<eos> I don't have a choice.<eos> Yes... you do.
What happened?<eos> For other people, not so much.<eos> They said that the trial was canceled.<eos> You said you were taking a plea.<eos> I did.
Clamp, clamp, clamp, clamp!<eos> Come on!<eos> He's bleeding out faster than we can put it in!<eos> What did I do?<eos> Did I...
I mean, you don't just teach them what to do with their hands.<eos> You teach them what to do with this, how to live through this.<eos> I mean, you take it on yourself.<eos> I know.<eos> You don't!
And that nasty esophageal tumor is in the medical waste, where it belongs.<eos> You got the damn cancer?<eos> We got the damn cancer.<eos> You got it?<eos> Well, Dr. Wilson and I did.
- I don't know.<eos> Maybe dental records?<eos> She doesn't have a home, you think she has a dentist? I don't know.<eos> They'll figure it out.<eos> Okay, but what if they don't?
She'll get over it.<eos> No.<eos> I don't want to be with him.<eos> Okay.<eos> You do, though.
- Yikes. - Yeah. So, if I may,<eos> Oh, okay. Uh, t-tonight?<eos> If the offer hasn't expired.<eos> Yeah. Well, I mean, I have a date now, but I can cancel it.<eos> - Oh, no, no, no, don't. No.
Arizona... you've always had an active love life.<eos> If I worried about who you've been kissing on, it would leave me little time for anything else.<eos> Okay, you're mad, and you didn't mean that.<eos> Yes, I did.<eos> No, I didn't.
What's wrong?<eos> I just look terrible.<eos> You have the same look Toby has every time he runs into someone he owes money to.<eos> Someone you're avoiding knows you're back in L.A.?<eos> They didn't.
Why don't I let you two talk.<eos> - Good to see you, Amy.<eos> - You, too, Henry.<eos> We should talk.<eos> We did.
I got to go.<eos> You're a terrible kisser.<eos> Must suck to be on the outs with Lucifer.<eos> He hates it when people manipulate him.<eos> I didn't.
Or not.<eos> Maybe there's another piece missing.<eos> Or maybe a dragon has to breathe on it.<eos> Who knows?<eos> Well, maybe Mum does.
We can use it to herd them toward the traps. - What about me?<eos> - Like, what should I do?<eos> - I just thought maybe you could take it easy. - It's your first day and...<eos> - I'll have you know,<eos> - Stronger even. - You already did this.
When did you become a grumpy old man who doesn't like people?<eos> I like people.<eos> I don't like Riggs.<eos> If you want to go to dinner with the guy, go to dinner.<eos> If you don't, don't.
It would hurt me, because there's zero indication he needs one.<eos> Smoking-related mesenteric ischemia...<eos> It could be that.<eos> Do you smoke?<eos> My grandmother did.
Oh, my...<eos> Oh, God!<eos> It's only been a few months, but when you know, you just know.<eos> You know?<eos> I do.
Jackson, he, uh... He likes you.<eos> I know him, so I know what that looks like.<eos> And, uh...<eos> He likes you. He has feelings for you.<eos> No, he doesn't.
Your mother's death was his mistake, but this will be yours, Daniel.<eos> You can't stop him, Alex.<eos> Do it.<eos> I know what you're feeling right now.<eos> No, you don't!
You can't stop him, Alex.<eos> Do it.<eos> I know what you're feeling right now.<eos> No, you don't!<eos> Yes, I do!
All right?<eos> Some of my best friends are bluish.<eos> - Why is Velma the only one that talks? - "Velma"?<eos> My suit.<eos> The others do sometimes.
You ok?<eos> Bill, I've got no TARDIS, no sonic, about ten minutes of oxygen left and now I'm blind...<eos> Can you imagine how unbearable I'm going to be when I pull this off?<eos> Don't do this...<eos> - You always do this.
Oh, so doctor isn't the only thing you have in common.<eos> I need to find her.<eos> We've done three rescues today and found no women.<eos> I don't know where she is, and I doubt anyone else will.<eos> He does.
He was in distress.<eos> He was gagging and bucking the vent.<eos> So you pulled out his E.T. tube?<eos> Why didn't you call me?<eos> I did.
I can't say who.<eos> WHISPERS: Everest.<eos> Christ, it makes me angry.<eos> Can't anyone ever think of the children?<eos> Well, thankfully, here at Cachet, we do.
Hello.<eos> Is Mistress Trixie available?<eos> Mistress Trixie doesn't live here any more, all right.<eos> Oh, Okay.<eos> Who does then?
I'll tell you where it's going, though, Her Majesty's Inland fucking Revenue.<eos> Wow!<eos> Are you going get to meet the Queen?<eos> Not unless she works at a tax office in Southend-on-Sea.<eos> She doesn't.
A lot.<eos> But...<eos> I've never had a boyfriend before.<eos> I don't know how to do that.<eos> Yes, you do.
It would put him in terrible danger.<eos> It is not safe for him.<eos> But I come for him.<eos> You understand?<eos> I do.
He's coming around to that curved section.<eos> Ooh, will this be our first finisher?<eos> Let me tell you, he's gonna make it.<eos> He's gonna make it! He's going to make it!<eos> He does it!
Ooh, will this be our first finisher?<eos> Let me tell you, he's gonna make it.<eos> He's gonna make it! He's going to make it!<eos> He does it!<eos> - He does it!
I know a lot about you, Emma.<eos> You faked your own death, and hid in the past.<eos> You have no idea what you're up against.<eos> I have a pretty good idea.<eos> No, you don't.
But I don't, it's my special, but I don't want to come back, but I'm coming back!<eos> No, okay, okay.<eos> No, no! No!<eos> But what if I didn't come back?<eos> But I did, I did.
You're a fucking sadist, you know that?<eos> You're demented!<eos> I'm almost tempted to let you have a run at it just to watch you waste your fucking time.<eos> This technology did not work when Peter theorized it, and it doesn't work now.<eos> It actually does work now. - It does.
You want a fleece?<eos> God, there's something beautiful about testing your first alpha.<eos> It's like watching a child take its first steps.<eos> Well, let's see if our space-saver app actually saves us any space.<eos> All right. Done.
How do you figure?<eos> 'Cause now I know you had some embarrassing shit to hide.<eos> I don't even need to know what it is.<eos> My phone may be in the toilet, but... but I win.<eos> No, you don't.
Anyhoo, as soon as Erlich comes in and brings us our signed data storage contract from Keenan, we'll be all set. We'll be back in business.<eos> Huh? Go team.<eos> Let's celebrate. Let's...<eos> let's put on some music.<eos> We never do that.
You can't leave.<eos> - Don't beg, Richard.<eos> - I'm not. According to the employee handbook, which you wrote, an employee cannot leave without giving two weeks' notice.<eos> You... you read the handbook?<eos> - Yeah, I did.
What the fuck?<eos> Shit.<eos> We must've left the work lights on all night.<eos> Well, do we have jumper cables?<eos> - Jared did.
You called him my friend.<eos> Who?<eos> Elliot.<eos> You said you were not my friend who died.<eos> Yeah, I did.
And before I knew what he was doing, he grabbed a knife from the kitchen counter and ran himself through with it.<eos> Well, not once, not twice.<eos> Three times.<eos> I tried to save him.<eos> I did.
The only difference between you and us is we're organized, and we're not letting Will Olsen out of here alive, not while he knows how to find us.<eos> So you can give up Will or you can watch your good friend Harry die.<eos> Carly!<eos> Don't do this.<eos> Harry didn't do anything wrong.
So you can give up Will or you can watch your good friend Harry die.<eos> Carly!<eos> Don't do this.<eos> Harry didn't do anything wrong.<eos> Didn't do anything wrong?
- I got it.<eos> My God. My God!<eos> Shh!<eos> - How?<eos> - How did you...
You all right?<eos> Yeah. Pulse is normal, I'm breathing regular.<eos> There's not a thing wrong with me.<eos> Why do you look like someone just died?<eos> Because Tammy almost did.
I just got the new.<eos> Total combat, was psyched to play it, And then I found him, You know,<eos> Out of lives. Okay, um, he was meeting someone from the internet?<eos> Do you know who?<eos> Sorry, I don't.
And you'll still be around?<eos> I'm the money.<eos> He may be a billionaire, But it takes billions more to build his empire.<eos> Gideon's interests will come and go, But he needs me to pay for his dreams.<eos> We done yet?
Should we call a halt? Not at all.<eos> With a little luck, a blow will land.<eos> All he's doing is showing off his feathers.<eos> I believe the lady feels the same.<eos> They usually do.
Yes, Lord.<eos> Louder. Why?<eos> Why not put all of my effort into...<eos> Now do you see, Lady?<eos> I do. Yes.
What is your name?<eos> I'm called Sihtric, Lord.<eos> Please, I'm not loyal to Kjartan and never can be.<eos> You swear your sword is mine?<eos> On Thor's hammer, I do, Lord.
I cannot remember the last time that I truly slept.<eos> Take some herbs, Your Highness.<eos> It will help.<eos> If you say they will help.<eos> I do, with all my heart.
I want to hear that.<eos> Right now?<eos> Yes, right now.<eos> Come on.<eos> Do it. - No way.
I'm so sorry.<eos> It's okay.<eos> I think I won the game.<eos> Yes, you did.<eos> I did.
I feel like you should probably start going now, though, no?<eos> I guess you won!<eos> I guess I win.<eos> I won!<eos> You did!
Something is sapping the breath from within me.<eos> You are only human and you are a good man.<eos> You are not alone.<eos> Do you agree to serve the Lord?<eos> I do.
- Shall we dance, good sir?<eos> - But of course, my lady.<eos> Guess we know who's taking out the garbage at the new place.<eos> That was not a confidence booster.<eos> You did very well.
What did I tell you?<eos> Nothing to worry about.<eos> You're just dumb, you know that?<eos> Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth?<eos> I do.
I wasn't aware I did it.<eos> Well, you do, and it's annoying, and judgey, to be honest.<eos> You know? Like you know something I don't.<eos> Okay.<eos> Do you?
I still can't believe you have never played. Skee-ball before, how is that even possible?<eos> I know we said the past is just the past, but this is much more mysterious than your tattoos.<eos> Well, let's just say I had a very unusual childhood.<eos> So, what will this get us?<eos> How does a brand-new
Me!<eos> What are you doing?<eos> I just need a minute.<eos> I was about to throw up in my suit.<eos> I did that once.
Yeah, and he calls us friends.<eos> Doctor!<eos> Think of the age gap!<eos> Stop mucking about and concentrate.<eos> Nardole, do something non-irritating.
What about him?<eos> - It's all right.<eos> They don't feel pain.<eos> - I think they do.<eos> Yes, they do.
Why won't you ever explain?<eos> I do explain.<eos> They are the special patients.<eos> When do those bag things come off their heads?<eos> They don't.
I got a nickel.<eos> So, I guess you'd say you're a couple of Davids looking to take on Goliath.<eos> -We never said that.<eos> -Well, you didn't have to.<eos> I did.
Elizabeth Thatcher is trying to cause trouble for the railroad.<eos> I don't want to see her near those children again.<eos> You find a way to teach them so they don't need her, or I'll find someone who can.<eos> We have to talk.<eos> Yes, sir, we do.
And he was pissed off, man.<eos> And... this time he knew my weakness.<eos> And he tossed me, like, 20 feet.<eos> How did you learn to bull-ride?<eos> I didn't.
But it's fixed.<eos> You could've just snuck it back in here.<eos> That's not my style.<eos> Don't beat yourself up over that.<eos> I do, I do.
Was she hot?<eos> Case closed.<eos> All right, we are almost done with these in-service training reports.<eos> Almost?<eos> Uh, we just did six classes in three days.
But it's not like he asked.<eos> You know, he's got a thing for frontier justice.<eos> But Veld takes the fall for this and...<eos> He's right.<eos> I do.
Where would she be without you?<eos> Lena barely knows me.<eos> I was in prison half her life.<eos> You can tell me anything.<eos> Just next time, you do it at the beginning of our date.
Why don't you take them chocolates?<eos> Oh, do you have the same kind you were selling before?<eos> Basically the same, yeah.<eos> I think that guy wanted to talk to you.<eos> Yeah, everybody does.
- That's what I'm hoping for.<eos> We're gonna go meet the lawyers in an hour.<eos> I think we should go light a candle across the street.<eos> - There you go.<eos> - I do.
I fell right into Scratch's trap.<eos> He won't win.<eos> He already has.<eos> Just the battle, not the war.<eos> You didn't do anything wrong.
For what she did to you, what she did to Markos.<eos> You don't get it.<eos> Shepherd, her army, her plans, they can't be stopped.<eos> I thought you said you didn't know any details of Phase Two.<eos> I don't.
Her next of kin.<eos> We don't know who the trust belonged to.<eos> We were hoping you might remember.<eos> Or perhaps you'd know what you did with the money.<eos> I don't.
Everybody trusts the FBI.<eos> Hey, who's Lisa Williams?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Why? Oh, somebody from the Herald called. They were just wondering if you knew her.<eos> I don't.
I'm sorry I'm late.<eos> The vice president has told me that your contacts have once again lost track of Ahmadi.<eos> Yes, as I explained, Syria is like a different country one day to the next.<eos> Yes, well, you can thank Viktor Petrov for that.<eos> Oh, I do.
I was the last person to see Aidan. He confessed to me.<eos> He secretly used the NSA, FISA, to manipulate the electorate.<eos> We're meeting with counsel to perfect the rest of the testimony.<eos> As long as no one has anything that contradicts you.<eos> No one does.
What is she worth to you?<eos> A lot.<eos> So then here's what I'm thinking.<eos> Do you solemnly swear and affirm that the testimony you are about to give is the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth?<eos> I do.
Then why didn't you say that?<eos> Because that's not what people do.<eos> Well, I would prefer if people told me exactly what is on their mind.<eos> No.<eos> No, you don't, you really don't.
We have to wait a little bit.<eos> They make you take a physical before you enter, so...<eos> Just a precaution.<eos> I didn't know you had a dog.<eos> I don't.
And I always feel very empathetic towards those 17-year-old people who say, "I don't know what to do."<eos> I was no different to that, I didn't know what to do at all.<eos> But then I did a course in theater design and I found myself in this room full of people making model stuff.<eos> I thought, "This is good, these people are feral, and they stay up all night making models, I feel quite at home here."<eos> So, I did that.
Where is he?<eos> Mom, it's gonna be okay.<eos> We'll find him.<eos> We don't even know where he is.<eos> Yes, you do.
He kicked some dude's ass.<eos> I wasn't planning to hook up with him, but after he took his shirt off and dominated in the ring, I was like, "Come to mama."<eos> Seriously?<eos> You should've seen him.<eos> I did.
Every soldier needs a way to let go of the weight he carries.<eos> Trevor found his way.<eos> Doesn't mean I have to agree with it.<eos> Do you even want to know what it was gonna say?<eos> I don't.
I didn't know that that had happened to him.<eos> The harassment and the...<eos> Yeah, but I didn't know he was so...anyway.<eos> I just think what you're doing is heroic.<eos> I really do.
Well, not the "government" government, obviously.<eos> But the people behind the government, the Illuminati.<eos> Whose brain have you eaten?<eos> Who wants to know?<eos> I do.
My question is, why not?<eos> You have a wife and a child and a life.<eos> Leave well enough alone.<eos> Told Liz I would, that it didn't matter.<eos> And it doesn't.
- Because they put them there.<eos> - Ah.<eos> Somebody drugged me.<eos> My hands, they put my hands on her neck.<eos> "They" did?
I'm so sorry, Maggie.<eos> You need God's strength.<eos> I never did believe in him.<eos> 'Til cops came to my house at 5 AM.<eos> Now I do.
But you know what Al's been up to.<eos> You can't read the morning paper without seeing his name.<eos> Keep it down, will you?<eos> My wife and kids don't know my real name.<eos> Nobody does.
Damn, I can't afford to live there.<eos> - Objection.<eos> - Eh, withdrawn.<eos> My point is you got a sob story.<eos> We all do.
"There's a surgeon, a one guard for the Bulls."<eos> I want to grab Olinsky and tell him it's gonna be okay... but it's not, never will be.<eos> The confession...<eos> I didn't actually hear it.<eos> Who did?
Read the title of chapter three.<eos> "Trials: It's All A Con."<eos> And I think I'm his mark.<eos> I never thought Dylan could do something like this.<eos> But you do now?
- Same objection.<eos> - Sustained.<eos> Mr. Stone, you're limited to questions relating to the defendant's prior outburst.<eos> Tell me, Dylan, why did you say that your mom doesn't know anything about your life?<eos> Because she doesn't.
Oh, he looks sad again.<eos> Well, I really envy your relationship.<eos> Other than you two only having sex once a year, you're the perfect couple.<eos> You-you know about that?<eos> Uh, yeah, everyone at the university does.
- That's it! - That's it.<eos> Well done, Rober! Awesome!<eos> He's got one last jump to go.<eos> Can he do it? Trying to time this jump just right.<eos> He does it! He does it!
Uh, yikes. $37,000 annually.<eos> That's not taking into consideration books, cost of living, ramen, beer kegs, bean bag chairs, et cetera.<eos> Joey Fletcher's family didn't have anywhere near that kind of money.<eos> How did he pay for it?<eos> He didn't.
Well, I'm just glad that the attorney general's taken a break, finally, from wasting tax-payer money, because he had no chance, zero, of getting a conviction.<eos> That's not what DOJ said.<eos> Of course not, because when has the FBI ever acted unethically?<eos> My client got full immunity.<eos> You do the math.
We're looking for the same supplier.<eos> Elizabeth, how's Henry?<eos> He-He's recovering, sir.<eos> He tried to drag himself here from the hospital.<eos> Of course he did.
They threw me out after I exposed their mission here.<eos> Well, now you have your answers, Alex, so I'll...<eos> Harry...<eos> I know how you feel.<eos> - No, you don't.
Well, many plants do. Concentrated solar plants do have storage.<eos> You store heat.<eos> You store the heat, and then whenever you need the electricity, you run the heat by water to heat the water--<eos> [Bill] A conventional steam turbine.<eos> So does a fission nuclear power plant--
Oh, thank you so much for grabbing my cat.<eos> Come on, Sweatshirt, there's still some sashimi left between my toes.<eos> Uh, this here is, uh, Winston's cat, Furguson.<eos> Sweatshirt walked through my door a year ago, and while he may come and go as he pleases, he loves Mommy and her little milkies.<eos> Yes, he does.
Doesn't matter if they're a rival or an ally or an old friend from boarding school.<eos> I didn't know Clay would do that.<eos> Well, if you didn't, you should have.<eos> And if you want to keep your job, you'll find out what he's up to and you'll make it up to me.<eos> And if you don't,
They deceive each other about everything.<eos> Just so you know, that guy in the parking lot hit me.<eos> He wasn't in a car, but okay.<eos> Just say you want to drive.<eos> I honestly don't.
Only one thing left to do.<eos> Keep testing.<eos> Dr. Curtis and Ms. Quinn, thank you for considering Harbor Oaks as a wedding venue.<eos> We hope that you enjoyed your complimentary spa session.<eos> We most certainly did.
I am a germophobe; I would never put my hand in something if it was contaminated.<eos> We rendered a deadly space rock safe.<eos> We have that technology.<eos> We know how to do it.<eos> You don't.
- Good for him. - He's got it, oh, man.<eos> - Nice job.<eos> Adrien Ngouah-Ngally has to jump on that last platform, and he gets another 20 points.<eos> - There we go.<eos> - He does it.
Yungyung Kim comes into Level 2 with 60 points, and he'll need more than 100 to move on to Level 3.<eos> If he doesn't, Adrian Raya of Mexico will be moving on.<eos> Oh! He slams into the second platform.<eos> I mean, he hit that thing really hard.<eos> - Yeah, he does it.
We don't do it!<eos> We don't do it.<eos> I'm kidding.<eos> I love to vote.<eos> I do it, like, five, six times in an election.
Kelsey?<eos> I'd like to ask you a few questions.<eos> If that's okay with you.<eos> I know how hard this must be.<eos> No, you don't.
If that's okay with you.<eos> I know how hard this must be.<eos> No, you don't.<eos> You're right.<eos> I don't.
Find out.<eos> He died.<eos> The funeral was yesterday.<eos> - You know where she is.<eos> - I do.
- Mm.<eos> Okay, hold on.<eos> You don't want to?<eos> No, I... I do.<eos> I do, 100%.
Crate 10997... Last earthly possessions of Milton Barker.<eos> Or at least the last earthly possessions that weren't stolen by Travis Unger.<eos> Says here Mr. Barker was an insurance adjustor, died of a stroke, age 86, no known heirs.<eos> So, how do you open this?<eos> I don't.
saving time already.<eos> Genius.<eos> I was gonna say,<eos> "Why does anyone think Sheldon's a genius?"<eos> But I didn't.
Good-bye. Okay, vague premise aside, I don't know what I would do, but if Jess was with me,<eos> I'm sure... I'm sure we'd be okay.<eos> She's got that giant heart that's, that's part compass and, and part flashlight and... she's just the greatest person I have ever met.<eos> Bob? Does that answer your question or what?<eos> It does.
I'm sure... I'm sure we'd be okay.<eos> She's got that giant heart that's, that's part compass and, and part flashlight and... she's just the greatest person I have ever met.<eos> Bob? Does that answer your question or what?<eos> It does.<eos> Weirdly enough, it does.
He was gonna give all of you up.<eos> So you shut him up.<eos> Isn't that right?<eos> No, I didn't do that.<eos> Then who did?
Four horses?<eos> He pushes me off a cliff, and you get four horses?<eos> Four horses is a lot.<eos> - I could have died.<eos> - But you didn't.
I found a roly-poly in these pants, they gave me 89% off.<eos> Oh. That's sweet. Um...<eos> Charmaine, I have to tell you something.<eos> I don't work in radio.<eos> I don't.
I-I didn't know you felt that way.<eos> No.<eos> I don't feel that way, I...<eos> - But you said unfair.<eos> - Yeah, I did.
Well, welcome back!<eos> Sorry.<eos> I don't know why I'm still shouting.<eos> Um, so Nick told me about what's been going on with you two.<eos> Oh, he did?
- Oh.<eos> It's all right. You know, it's just, technically, this is just for myself...<eos> Wait.<eos> Do you remember when you had to smuggle the golden sextant out of the Paris Math Academy?<eos> - I do.
I can get you anywhere.<eos> I own this place.<eos> We're taking you home.<eos> You don't know who you're messing with, Alvez.<eos> Yes, I do.
I said, "No, I don't think so."<eos> He says, "I'm sure of it."<eos> And then he cuffs me to prove the whole thing. And--<eos> Round of applause if you've been arrested. Has anyone been arrested before?<eos> Few people. What did you--
- You did that on Christmas mornin'?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Well, the cows don't know it's Christmas.<eos> Sounds like somethin' I'd say.<eos> Yeah, you do.
I did it to save everyone else.<eos> Well, you exposed yourself, and now, you should leave the team.<eos> Yeah, I should.<eos> Yet I don't want you to.<eos> You don't?
- I understand.<eos> - I don't want to die for this.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I thought you might want to be a part of something... with me.<eos> Yeah. So did I.
I just want to know from Paige, why did you tell me you loved me?<eos> Mom.<eos> Did you really say that to Walter?<eos> Um... honey, I don't recall.<eos> Yes, you do.
Well, tell him Ka-hey for me.<eos> Will do.<eos> You still have a thing for her, huh?<eos> Who says I have a thing for her?<eos> Who doesn't?
Last one's for you.<eos> Ready to get your life back?<eos> Kind of crazy to be working with you again.<eos> It's kind of like I never left.<eos> Yeah, but you did.
Now I'm a good cop?<eos> You didn't want me around in the first place.<eos> I'm a good cop.<eos> You're right.<eos> I didn't.
I knew that no matter how much you'd hate me for what I'd done, you'd do the right thing for your country.<eos> You can't be corrupted Kurt.<eos> Stop calling me Kurt!<eos> You don't know me.<eos> Yes, I do.
Get it together, you're up.<eos> Thank you, Ralph.<eos> Do you, Tobias Merriweather Curtis, take Happy Quinn to be your lawfully wedded wife?<eos> You bet I do.<eos> And do you, Happy Quinn...
But you need to get our badges back.<eos> Your own Deputy Director suspended you.<eos> How am I supposed to change that?<eos> 'Cause you got pull.<eos> Yes. I do.
This is not a negotiation.<eos> We're still establishing the connection.<eos> You have a deal.<eos> How do I know you'll keep your part of the deal?<eos> You don't.
What's this about?<eos> It's about the shipyard and Mayor Hamilton.<eos> I'll be right there.<eos> Why does NCIS know about the shipyard?<eos> NCIS doesn't, I do.
And they just wear grass.<eos> 'Cause they don't even have sticks yet.<eos> They're in the grass age.<eos> They have no clocks.<eos> But they do a dance.
- You tell me!<eos> - Vera? - She let Smith out to get to me.<eos> I'm lifting your suspension.<eos> - That's if you want to come back.<eos> - Yes, I do.
But sometimes you fail people.<eos> Anyone in particular?<eos> Bea Smith?<eos> Yeah, I failed her.<eos> We all did, all of us.
I'm sorry, everybody, we are being shut down... because of the actions of one stupid individual...<eos> Elizabeth Birdsworth.<eos> Me?<eos> Sonia that was an accident.<eos> - I did...
I'm told you're opening offices in Paris and London.<eos> My accountant's untimely demise left the door wide open for you to purchase that fleet of cruise ships for a song.<eos> - Well, now...<eos> - I know what happened with Von Hauser.<eos> Everyone does.
I'm a little down on my luck.<eos> A penny stock.<eos> Invest in me now and when I rise, you'll be able to afford three mistresses.<eos> I may have something in steerage.<eos> Done.
Probably a lot.<eos> I mean, it's right there in the name: lie-brary.<eos> What are we gonna do?<eos> Well, she's gonna come home sometime.<eos> And when she does...
How did that work?<eos> It worked fine.<eos> Here, you contribute, you're in.<eos> - Everybody loved him.<eos> - Well, somebody didn't.
"Shar, just leave it alone.<eos> It's just one of those things, you should just leave it alone."<eos> He never said, "Oh, my God.<eos> You're so ridiculous. How... "<eos> He didn't do that.
No, for giving me a chance.<eos> I didn't wake up today thinking I'd be a doctor again.<eos> Oh. Well, I mean, like I said, you're helping us out.<eos> We're taking advantage of you.<eos> Oh, yeah? Well... do it anytime.
So now, you're giving up fashion design to become... what? A hero?<eos> I'm not giving up my art.<eos> The truth is... that jerk I stabbed in the hand... He was right.<eos> My work lacked identity, because I didn't have it.<eos> And now I do.
She just wanted to steal my business.<eos> Really?<eos> Then why did they contact her?<eos> You have no proof of that.<eos> Yes, I do.
They're one of my biggest.<eos> And if they leave because you chose some prisoner over one of the biggest developers in the country, people are gonna get the message that we don't want to be in the real estate business.<eos> Did they say they were gonna give people that message?<eos> - Harvey--<eos> - Did they or not?
You want to run that by me again?<eos> I just ran it by you.<eos> What you are doing is a mistake.<eos> I don't think so, and Donna doesn't think so, which means--<eos> Actually, Harvey, I do.
Simply put, it is my mission.<eos> Really?<eos> I didn't think people had a mission.<eos> I don't think everyone has one.<eos> But, like me and yourself, Nanaka, some humans do.
Arlo, be nice.<eos> You tryin' to get laid?<eos> You gonna tap some ass?<eos> I don't think so.<eos> What does that do?
Wendell Dukes, seven kills.<eos> Vincent Agostino, one kill.<eos> Daniele Wilkins, one kill.<eos> Begin.<eos> No! Don't!
That's murder, ain't it?<eos> You know what the penalty for murder is, don't you, Lieutenant?<eos> Yeah. Hmm?<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Yeah, you do.
You cannot beat a river into submission.<eos> You have to surrender to its current, and use its power as your own.<eos> I control it by surrendering control?<eos> That doesn't make any sense.<eos> Not everything does.
- And I did<eos> When Eddie said he didn't like his teddy You knew he was a no-good kid<eos> But when he threatened your life With a switch-blade knife - What a guy<eos> - Makes you cry<eos> And I did
- Makes you cry<eos> And I did<eos> - What a guy<eos> - Makes you cry<eos> And I did
It's a cool joke.<eos> That was funny.<eos> It's disgusting.<eos> Is it more or less disgusting if I tell you it came from the front?<eos> - Oh, you didn't...
Who cares if you impress him?<eos> Oh, golly, you two are something.<eos> You're right.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> - I don't...
Thanks for the upgrade.<eos> Rowan, ya big bully!<eos> Hope this guy knows how to ride a motorcycle.<eos> Rowan, not Kevin!<eos> Yeah, he does.
Now look at me.<eos> Both... both of you.<eos> - I think I know what you want.<eos> - No, you don't. - Yeah, I do.<eos> - No, you don't.
That's three.<eos> It's just ten.<eos> Did you drink this?<eos> No. Oh, thank God.<eos> You did.
Hey, hey, what-- what are you doing?<eos> Bingo.<eos> What bingo?<eos> What-- your eyes darted.<eos> No. No, my-- no, they didn't.
Call'em.<eos> But without you minding her, your lady friend stays here strapped to a board in a drug- induced coma.<eos> They warned me about you.<eos> I didn't believe the stories.<eos> Nobody does.
Is that what you are?<eos> Ultralinks? No!<eos> Max, those are very dangerous.<eos> They destroy worlds. They destroy everything.<eos> They don't...
If everybody thinks I'm gonna kill the president, no one will suspect my actual objective.<eos> And with Masovich's bodyguards all outside during the party,<eos> -he will be at his most vulnerable.<eos> -Are you sure it will work?<eos> Already did.
Say good night, bitch!<eos> Good night, bitch.<eos> Arrest that man for the assassination of President Cueto.<eos> I didn't do anything. I did not do it.<eos> He did it.
How's it looking up there, Captain Hiller?<eos> It's truly humbling to see how beautiful Earth is from here, Madam President.<eos> On this day, in 1996... President Whitmore passionately declared...<eos> "We will not go quietly into the night."<eos> And we did not.
She doesn't want her.<eos> Ask her. Ask her, right now.<eos> Do you?<eos> Do you?<eos> I do. I do... Please.
- Yeah, I'm Frank.<eos> - The fault is yours, then, huh?<eos> I'm sorry, okay?<eos> I didn't mean for any of this to happen.<eos> Well, it did.
I wrote the music. Twink is my lyricist.<eos> The melody came to me one night... when I was getting super, super, super baked.<eos> Like fuck-a-guy baked.<eos> You know what I'm saying?<eos> Yeah, he does.
I can't do that.<eos> - I want you to come home with me. - Well...<eos> I can't do that.<eos> Then I don't really know what to do right now.<eos> I don't either.
He's out of control, Mike.<eos> You told me Bianca was not a problem anymore.<eos> Bianca isn't a problem anymore.<eos> I'm afraid that's his problem.<eos> Oh, my God, you didn't.
You told me Bianca was not a problem anymore.<eos> Bianca isn't a problem anymore.<eos> I'm afraid that's his problem.<eos> Oh, my God, you didn't.<eos> - Your guys didn't...
Hey, Scott, you still here?<eos> I'm Bianca's brother.<eos> I'm in your office.<eos> I've got what you want, and you've got what I want.<eos> How did you...?
- How was your holiday?<eos> - All right.<eos> I'll grab your bag.<eos> Did you get to see your sister in Los Angeles?<eos> Yeah, I did.
Put him in a comfy cell? They're not.<eos> He's right.<eos> You know this guy?<eos> No, I didn't know him.<eos> But Marcus sure did.
I mean, where the fuck is everyone always goin'?<eos> Huh?<eos> Where's everyone goin' all the time?<eos> Think I don't care?<eos> I fuckin' do.
The subject has consented to participate in accordance with IRB guidelines.<eos> Mr. Leeham, Mr. Leeham.<eos> - Yes, sir.<eos> - Please state for the video record that you understand the nature of this study.<eos> - I do.
- Is she awake?<eos> - Yeah, she just woke up.<eos> She was so excited about the baby.<eos> She really wanted it.<eos> We both did.
He left it out of pride.<eos> There is talk of suspending Durán.<eos> What would you say about that?<eos> I-I don't know what happened.<eos> And if I don't, then you don't.
You have great fighter's instincts.<eos> I was just there to support you.<eos> That's not true.<eos> I need you in my corner, Ray.<eos> Not anymore, you don't.
Would you just let me have the win?<eos> We're winning!<eos> It ever occur to you that I know what I'm doing?<eos> I hope you do.<eos> I do.
Where I wrote it...<eos> -Yeah. He used to take the most beautiful portraits without using any filters or Photoshop...<eos> I've read your diary.<eos> He was amazing.<eos> My God, you did?
Fucking golf.<eos> -Okay. Cocky McBlockerson.<eos> What the fuck?<eos> Bam!<eos> Who does your taxes? HR Cock-block?
Yeah, I told her about the sheet thing.<eos> Yeah. Efraim has some contacts with the government.<eos> So we're just combining forces right now.<eos> Yeah, just... Just be careful with him.<eos> - Emily, don't.
Oh, I know.<eos> That's why I have to go to New York, because people there do feel responsible, responsible for blowing up Vietnamese villages, blowing up little babies.<eos> But you don't care.<eos> And neither does Mother.<eos> No one in our family or in our fucking little town does.
You are the one who asked me to help him.<eos> Yes I did say that... because he was just a tourist then ...and now he is a criminal in this country...<eos> And till the time all is not clarified or proven, that he is not involved in any criminal activity.... ...but actually doing social good...<eos> Do you even understand the difference?<eos> I do sir...
That's such a bullshit line.<eos> What is?<eos> I have nothing to hide.<eos> I don't.<eos> Everyone does.
We're targeting bad guys' cell phones.<eos> Sometimes the SIM card.<eos> Okay, and how do we know the bad guy is in possession of the bad cell phone when we strike?<eos> Well, we don't...<eos> Course we do.
So we interviewed him?<eos> Yeah, over a year ago.<eos> Remember when you asked me to find out who was on the phone with Webb?<eos> Of course.<eos> I did.
Matt.<eos> Yes?<eos> Have you seen this?<eos> Have you seen this?<eos> Do it again!
Well, it matters because... if you're going to give up your dream.<eos> I think it matters... that you like what you're playing on the road for years.<eos> Do you like the music that I play?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I do.
Listen to me, please.<eos> I love you.<eos> Well, I don't love you.<eos> Mother: Oh, hush!<eos> You do, too.
Because you ran away...<eos> Goddamn it!<eos> Shit!<eos> You messed me up, real good!<eos> Please don't...
Do you know what I told him?<eos> That you took my money and left, so he should pay back his kid's debt instead.<eos> Then he asked me for just a week.<eos> He said he needed a week.<eos> So what do I do?
- I'm not pushing you away.<eos> - Did you fuck that guy?<eos> - Did I fuck what guy?<eos> - You know.<eos> - I don't.
This way!<eos> Go!<eos> What?<eos> What...?<eos> And did you also...?
The Maham Order had begun.<eos> Whoever supported him was given Gold... the rest were given death.<eos> Srujan did not commit any crime.<eos> We did!<eos> I did!
I know, but it's hard because...<eos> I get it.<eos> I've been there.<eos> Thanks, Lieutenant, you always know what to...<eos> I do.
Julius Caesar in the corner.<eos> He's read it all.<eos> He knows every battle ever fought.<eos> - Does he know about the real thing?<eos> - None of us do.
I told him, "Hey, you want to do something original? How about a series with a cop who doesn't give a shit?"<eos> Punches out, comes home, has dinner with his family, bangs the wife, and sleeps like a log.<eos> You write a show like that, and the job will throw you a parade.<eos> Am I right, Dennis?<eos> What the fuck you still doing here?
I walked past him, out of the station and then stopped.<eos> I turned around and went back.<eos> Why?<eos> Because I didn't see what I see in my other clients.<eos> And I still don't after all this time.
I wish they had seen something.<eos> Now, there's 10,000 people that think I got no dick.<eos> Wait. You guys know I have a dick, right?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - You do. You do.
- If one believes in God, isn't that what it all comes down to, where we end up after all this?<eos> Probably not, but maybe.<eos> I'll go to Hell so someone else could go to Heaven.<eos> - You got my package?<eos> - I did.
If you're referring to him informing the military about the kidnapping plot against my brother, then, yes, of course.<eos> He was a hero.<eos> - Were you and your brother close?<eos> - Very close. - You have any brothers?<eos> - I do actually.
Yeah, Jackson's still alone.<eos> Keep me updated.<eos> Derohan should be there soon to relieve you.<eos> You really think all that money's in there?<eos> Yeah, I really do.
So... where did you learn about the secret rule?<eos> Let's talk about your dad.<eos> I don't like what you're insinuating!<eos> Yes, it was my idea to bring Lou-Lou here!<eos> Peter did nothing wrong!
The lift had to be down!<eos> Wait for me.<eos> They'll feed us their vile apricot chicken.<eos> The Vaunoy cook very well.<eos> Sure they do...
- Fuck off.<eos> All right.<eos> Get away from me.<eos> Stop it.<eos> Oh, don't.
What about my mother?<eos> Huh?<eos> The judge would never let that happen.<eos> And anyway, no one even knows where she is.<eos> I do.
I'm just saying it kind of freaks me out.<eos> Oh, god damn it, where did I park the car?<eos> Yeah, I don't know, but i wish you'd figure it out because I'm freezing my ass off.<eos> You don't have a normal winter coat?<eos> - Huh? - Yeah. Yeah, I do.
Minimum wage plus the room.<eos> All right.<eos> Let's go get some furniture.<eos> I got furniture.<eos> No, you don't.
- Oh, my God.<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> You look beautiful.<eos> You think I look beautiful?<eos> Of course I do.
Oh.<eos> Uh... How 'bout if I put my penis in you?<eos> - That's even worse.<eos> - Oh, I'm so sorry.<eos> What about if I just did the tip, like, just the very beginning...
We've got your kid, now calm down.<eos> He's all right.<eos> - He's just a little baby.<eos> - I know.<eos> - He didn't, doesn't...
Now can we get back to having the best fucking night ever?<eos> All right, I'm bringing it up.<eos> Hey, all right, you two fucking on the dance floor last night?<eos> I'm sorry, I guess I was just raised a little differently than you, slut.<eos> - No, no, we didn't.
I don't remember going there.<eos> I went back upstairs to the bedroom.<eos> I didn't kill her.<eos> Even if you can't remember anything, you'd know that. You'd feel it, right?<eos> I don't.
It's up to you.<eos> What'd he say?<eos> He offered to help me in here.<eos> - And you said?<eos> - I didn't.
We all better figure it out fast 'cause I don't like it here.<eos> It doesn't make any sense.<eos> There was no way they could've known we'd be in this van.<eos> Doesn't matter.<eos> They did.
- I'm not fuckin' around.<eos> I need to know.<eos> Do you need to know or does your husband?<eos> You know I hate it when you call her that.<eos> Course I do.
I don't care about them.<eos> Well, no, I do, but I don't really.<eos> I care about you and him.<eos> I know that, Sam.<eos> And he does, too.
Why would Steve do something like this?<eos> Wait, does he think he stopped growing?<eos> Yeah, that's right.<eos> I know what this is about.<eos> You do?
- Okay.<eos> - Defendant, please rise.<eos> Raise your right hand.<eos> Do you swear or affirm to tell the truth, the whole truth, - and nothing but the truth?<eos> - I do.
Are you kidding me?<eos> Are you kidding me?<eos> Ask him again.<eos> You drank, took drugs, had sex, and... killed her.<eos> No, I didn't.
Me clothes are soaked.<eos> Would you, erm, fetch me mac for me, so's I can go out through the hall?<eos> Of course.<eos> Has this happened to you before?<eos> Well, it does, doesn't it, to women?
Now, if you need a worthy cause, Miss, I suggest you find a Seaman's Mission.<eos> Men give you their lives, Mr Gibson.<eos> At least respect them, even if you won't protect them.<eos> I think it was when we were at the community centre.<eos> I really don't...
- No!<eos> I don't want that.<eos> I want you here.<eos> I nearly lost you once already.<eos> But you didn't.
I'm going to get us both right out of here.<eos> When I get my degree, we can go where we like.<eos> I don't know...<eos> Well, if you don't know, Lin, I do.<eos> "I do."
It hasn't been baptised.<eos> I should've baptised it myself.<eos> You don't have to be a priest to christen a baby, did you know that?<eos> No.<eos> I didn't.
Was it a girl?<eos> Yes.<eos> I knew.<eos> Always knew.<eos> Yes. Yes, you did.
I wished so hard for her.<eos> Maybe I shouldn't have.<eos> Maybe I'm being punished.<eos> - But God knows I love my boys...<eos> - He does.
There's one school of thought that blames nuclear testing.<eos> It happened after Hiroshima and Nagasaki too.<eos> We did it in History.<eos> So World War II is history now, is it?<eos> We do exams in it and everything.
I might have gone a few words past necessary.<eos> My brother, he died in jail while I was getting my masters.<eos> I knew he needed help, but at the time I felt I did all I could do, and I have... regretted feeling that way ever since.<eos> - Sorry I pressed.<eos> - You did.
'Cause you don't trust us.<eos> We need to get him to a hospital.<eos> No, I can't go to the hospital.<eos> They'll kill me.<eos> Just like they did Chico.
- Come into the precinct. - No. No.<eos> You saw how quickly Mariah sent that lawyer and got me out of there.<eos> You didn't wanna talk to me before.<eos> What makes you trust me now?<eos> Because Luke Cage does.
No, it's fine.<eos> It's just... you know.<eos> You know Kim and Kanye?<eos> No.<eos> No, I don't.
You came here because you know it's time to come in.<eos> Your father created the program.<eos> Didn't have what it takes to make it work.<eos> And you did.<eos> You always did.
You and your secrets, Mr. Church.<eos> My sister loved the banana bread you made.<eos> Oh, thank you, Poppy-<eos> "My sister loved the banana bread you made."<eos> She did.
These stores are expensive.<eos> Let me.<eos> I'll never have a child of my own.<eos> You don't know that.<eos> No, I do.
Thank you for your time, sir.<eos> You're welcome.<eos> I hope you found something because we have no leads and the next murder flight leaves in three hours.<eos> I hope you found something because we have no leads and the next murder flight leaves in three hours.<eos> As a matter of fact, we did.
Save it! - Please help me!<eos> - These guys are gonna kill me!<eos> You're gonna wanna pay attention to my questions. Please.<eos> No, wait, wait, wait!<eos> Oh, God, please don't!
Father disagreed with the Prophet on Thor Gundersen.<eos> Got him cast out. And us with him.<eos> I know.<eos> So, where'd you say you're headed?<eos> I didn't.
I guess I better get back to the cut, then.<eos> There's pieces in there still.<eos> Doctor couldn't get it all.<eos> It won't ever heal then.<eos> Some things don't.
- Yeah.<eos> But, um... dropping everything and jetting off to Europe...<eos> I don't know why, but... it's hard for me imagining myself getting carried away like that.<eos> - I know why.<eos> - You do?
- For 3 1/2 weeks.<eos> - Are we talking about the heiress?<eos> Current theory ... scorned woman plants land mine.<eos> - You got anything better?<eos> - I do.
But with my guidance she rebounded from fashion disaster.<eos> Sweetie, dial it back.<eos> When she met Will, I knew it was special.<eos> She never talked about boys, so when she brought him up, I just knew that...<eos> Okay, Em, kind of doing something up here.
- Hot rodders and hooligans.<eos> Juvenile delinquents in blue jeans.<eos> And then there's the service.<eos> It takes forever and a day for your food to arrive.<eos> - And when it finally does...
So if you can't beat 'em, buy 'em.<eos> I remember the first time I saw that name stretched across your stand out there.<eos> It was love at first sight.<eos> I knew right then and there, I had to have it.<eos> - And now I do.
What do I got to hide? !<eos> Juice ain't got nothing to hide!<eos> Why in the hell were you in there alone?<eos> I don't know, man.<eos> I don't...
You cannot tell by somebody's voice whether they are black.<eos> That is a racist statement and entirely inappropriate.<eos> Your Honor, yeah, I am offended that in America, in 1995, that we have to endure this kind of thinking.<eos> All right, I didn't make the statement.<eos> The witness did.
Yes, but we are all aware of the realities of this case, the problem with conjugal visits and telephone calls that are only monitored on one side.<eos> This is an obvious attempt by the defense to get material to the jury that has not been admitted in court.<eos> It is inappropriate and deliberate.<eos> I strongly urge the court to exercise control and not permit testimony without cross-examination.<eos> Please, Your Honor, don't do this.
Want to guess what it is?<eos> Something special.<eos> The first day I was in here, you gave me your Bible.<eos> I know how much it means to you, so I'm gonna give it back to you.<eos> Yes, it does.
As am I.<eos> I had a dream Bandon was alone, drowning in a sea of black.<eos> This is my fault.<eos> I failed him.<eos> We both did.
- Beetle.<eos> The point is your story will live on in him.<eos> Hello, my young friend.<eos> Why don't you join in my song?<eos> But how did you...
[police siren]<eos> And the representative for the Minister of Finance?<eos> In favor.<eos> You don't want a casino?<eos> No, we don't.
The campaign has started.<eos> It's a big risk.<eos> If I don't stand, the mafia will take over the city.<eos> Nobody, not even Barrès, has the balls to stand up to them.<eos> But I do.
When we met, I didn't tell you...<eos> I haven't seen Antía for 12 years.<eos> Twelve years?<eos> Did you really see her like you said?<eos> Yes, I did.
We couldn't live without each other.<eos> It's a pity it was hell at the end.<eos> Hell?<eos> I see you know nothing.<eos> I don't.
Yeah, but I still don't want you to die of a rare pond disease.<eos> Oh, what am I doing?<eos> What am I doing, Ray?<eos> I don't know how to be a husband.<eos> No, you don't.
What was that?<eos> What was what?<eos> (chirps again)<eos> You hear that, that chirping sound?<eos> I did not, no.
- Meaning?<eos> I entrusted him to God.<eos> - I don't understand!<eos> Don't you believe in Providence?<eos> I do.
You want to know the nature of my relationship with him.<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Because you're concerned<eos> I aided and abetted a known criminal.<eos> Did you?
- She was this close.<eos> - What did you do?<eos> Oh, I ran away screaming, of course.<eos> Oh, do you believe in ghosts, Oswald?<eos> Yes, I do.
I let them separate us.<eos> I had no idea.<eos> She never told me she was pregnant.<eos> She didn't tell me about you.<eos> If she did...
She must've figured that the two of you would be better off making your own way.<eos> Which, in fact, was probably the truth.<eos> Look at you.<eos> A strong young man.<eos> She did a good job, didn't she?
I know what you're doing.<eos> Alfred told me everything.<eos> He shouldn't have done that.<eos> - I understand how you feel.<eos> - No, you don't.
"Malone's death made me realize a couple of things.<eos> "You can't kill murder.<eos> "You can't get revenge on evil.<eos> "You can only begin to fight such things<eos> "by not doing them.
Now I know you know something.<eos> If you're providing aid and shelter to Jim Gordon, anything... a glass of water...<eos> I will bust you like a bum I never met.<eos> Cap, I wish I knew where he was.<eos> But I don't.
She changed her mind.<eos> Smart girl.<eos> Oh, you're an animal, Bullock,<eos> - you know that?<eos> - Oh, yes, ma'am. I do, I do.
I need your help.<eos> - My help?<eos> - I didn't kill Pinkney.<eos> - You have to believe me. - Yeah.<eos> Yeah, I do.
What the hell was that?<eos> You'll see.<eos> Allow me to introduce Basil.<eos> Basil just woke up this morning.<eos> Didn't you, son? Yep.
Yeah, try and spread the word that you've got a connect on the outside that gives you access to contrabands:<eos> cigarettes, burner phones...<eos> Pornography.<eos> Amy, women don't watch...<eos> - They do. - Mm.
Every band I approach, they say they don't like my face. - What?<eos> - Is there something wrong with my face?<eos> Just tell me, it's fine.<eos> No, Clark, we just scored the Zeppelin deal.<eos> Richie did.
He should be on medication.<eos> And did I tell you he still craps the bed most nights?<eos> Oh, boy.<eos> Uh-oh.<eos> No, you did not.
Do you know what that is?<eos> Look, I should just go with you, you know? I mean...<eos> Your mom did tell me to share my life with you.<eos> Yeah, I know.<eos> You don't...
- Please.<eos> What is it? What's the matter?<eos> He doesn't love me any more.<eos> He loves Julie Karagina.<eos> No, he doesn't!
I don't know, it would just feel awkward.<eos> False.<eos> That's because you really love that funny one with the glasses!<eos> Pierre?<eos> I do not!
Who is he? Where the hell's he come from?<eos> He's our seasonal sous-chef from England.<eos> He was working in that kitchen.<eos> We need to call the police.<eos> Chief, we doing medical attention?
I-I... shouldn't have called you.<eos> This was a mistake.<eos> Don't say that.<eos> This has nothing to do with you.<eos> Yes, it does. It does.
MAC:<eos> Oh, I think we know how to be parents.<eos> She's a baby, "A." She doesn't retain any of that shit.<eos> Well, yes she will.<eos> No, she doesn't.
You're a Mason?<eos> Yes, I belong to the brotherhood of Freemasons.<eos> I'm afraid my way of thinking is very different from yours.<eos> I don't believe in God.<eos> Of course you don't.
The marshal there, Count Rostov, has failed to produce half the men required of him.<eos> The army still needs to be maintained, even in this time of so called peace.<eos> Rostov needs someone to ginger him up a bit.<eos> Do you know the man, at all?<eos> - No, I don't.
The army still needs to be maintained, even in this time of so called peace.<eos> Rostov needs someone to ginger him up a bit.<eos> Do you know the man, at all?<eos> - No, I don't.<eos> - I do.
None of this is her fault, she didn't know that Nikolai was going to speak out.<eos> Truly, she's never expected anything from him.<eos> And now, my son hates me!<eos> He doesn't!<eos> Oh, he doesn't!
Either way, you can direct all future questions to my lawyer, Clay Hibbard at Berkowitz and Etz.<eos> Great. We're so sorry to have bothered you.<eos> You know what, though, I think this is going to make an awesome story for the press, and the thing is, I love to be in the press.<eos> - It's true. She does.<eos> - I do. I really do.
Let the psychologist do her evaluation and try again later, Louise.<eos> You said you were going to leave the police.<eos> Yeah, well, not so easy with six kids.<eos> I thought you didn't want Olivier's job.<eos> I didn't.
One for you, one for me, and one for the lawyer.<eos> Need a pen?<eos> I signed already.<eos> Right. Always prepared.<eos> You doing any writing these days?
Maybe you needed better teachers.<eos> That could be.<eos> Can I do the drill now?<eos> - You promised.<eos> I did, didn't I?
Struggling?<eos> Do you know what I've been struggling with?<eos> Trying to be patient with you and understanding, and all the while, I've been...<eos> I've been dealing with carrying our child.<eos> 'Course I do.
'Cause if the engine was going, we would hear a gah, gah, gah, gah, gah, gah, gah...<eos> Are you deaf, Charlie?<eos> I was like...<eos> (imitating motor boat)<eos> (all doing different engine imitations)
Well, because I'm the most responsible person.<eos> Uh, guys, guys, I-I don't think any of us should have a gun.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Well, one of us does, so... the end.
If not, we fight to protect the island.<eos> With who in command of the fleet?<eos> No one's seen Flint in weeks.<eos> When he hears news of the invasion, he'll return.<eos> But if he doesn't?
We persuaded them that they need us.<eos> We most certainly need them.<eos> Do you understand what I'm saying?<eos> Don't imagine that will be the last of those.<eos> Neither do I.
What's good for you could be really hard for her.<eos> Why didn't you have your defense team contact the police?<eos> I don't trust lawyers, and I don't trust the police.<eos> I only trust you.<eos> Or at least I did once.
Operation over.<eos> So, what, we go back to questioning Mom? No.<eos> We put out a federal warrant.<eos> His crew sees a Fed warrant, he might as well have a target on his back.<eos> He already does.
They're not gonna get away with this. That's exactly what they're gonna do.<eos> Manny, the cops in my mom's unit are like family to me. They're gonna make this right.<eos> You'll just have to trust me.<eos> You, I trust.<eos> The police, I don't.
Parsi, come with me.<eos> Jaldi!<eos> You can help me dig!<eos> He says he didn't deal with the man himself.<eos> So who did?
We got it!<eos> You guys [Bleep] that up!<eos> You [Bleep] it up for me!<eos> Oh, you want to watch another episode?<eos> - Do you? Yes. - Yeah.
Oh, man.<eos> That's it.<eos> Dude, I thought I was gonna make it.<eos> I know.<eos> You almost did, but...
I'm sorry, too.<eos> I threw you in the deep end out there.<eos> I should've never asked you to come.<eos> Honestly.<eos> No. No, you didn't do anything wrong.
This is Chub.<eos> My real name's Charles.<eos> Everybody calls me Chub, you know, 'cause I'm fat.<eos> I didn't know Trudy had any African-American friends.<eos> She don't.
You said it was possible yourself to have feelings for two people.<eos> You love him too?<eos> I don't believe it.<eos> Believe it.<eos> I do.
- I have something for you.<eos> - No, Liz, honey, please don't make this more difficult than it needs to be.<eos> Let's just...<eos> Please, just open it.<eos> Oh, you didn't.
You understand that it's in connection with your conviction for murder?<eos> - Frazer's explained, yes.<eos> I wonder, do you recognise this man?<eos> For the purposes of the tape, I'm showing David a picture of a male individual.<eos> I do, yes.
Why are you protecting him, David?<eos> No-one has any idea how bad Gortnacull House was.<eos> Only those that were there.<eos> - I have some idea.<eos> - No, you fucking don't.
That's a sign of respect.<eos> At least it is with gorillas.<eos> Not helping.<eos> I think that somebody needs one of my special stories.<eos> I don't, I don't.
What the fuck are you doing?<eos> Bradley-- no, I didn't.<eos> Shut up. You cannot play with this!<eos> Well, you shouldn't have left it out then.<eos> I didn't.
Look, I need $40 for HBO.<eos> D'accord ?<eos> Okay.<eos> Did you get that job?<eos> Yeah, I did.
- It's good to see you, Harry.<eos> Tony went to Las Vegas frequently for business.<eos> Did he always drive?<eos> He didn't like to fly.<eos> Oh, who does these days?
- The what?<eos> The riddle of the two barbers!<eos> Understand that, Florence, and you understand who killed Dan Hagen.<eos> - You know who killed Dan Hagen?<eos> - Yes, I do.
Why don't we just find his mother?<eos> Why, just so she can bury him?<eos> Yeah, because trying to kill Barry has gone so well for you in the past.<eos> Yeah, Lana, but this time it's, um... [chuckles] Were you gonna say, "This time it's personal"?<eos> [chuckling] Yeah, but I didn't.
[Pam] Wait, are we doing-<eos> - Jesus!<eos> You were willing to risk that? Oh, that is classic you!<eos> A mother! The one thing I've been searching for my entire goddamn life, and you take it for granted!<eos> Just like you do with everything else!
- What bet?<eos> - No, shut up.<eos> I would think "person" was implied.<eos> Yeah, no, I just didn't wanna get in that head space and then, you know...<eos> No, I don't.
- Why the glasses? - Um...<eos> I like them.<eos> They totally work on you.<eos> But do you need them?<eos> - Yeah, the lenses don't do anything.
You're free of your pledge to avenge Bayen's death.<eos> The Skinshifter is dead.<eos> But the man who forced it to do his bidding still lives.<eos> If I lose and I'm challenged, my brother thinks I'll step aside.<eos> Everybody does.
Good morning. I am Senator Ronald Sperling,<eos> Chair of this Hearing. Miss Sloane...<eos> Please raise your right hand.<eos> Do you solemnly swear that you will tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, under pains and penalties of perjury?<eos> - I do.
All right, Jane, contact Rodolfo Schmidt at Peterson Wyatt, and tell him there's a total of six coming over.<eos> I count five.<eos> Mathematician you are not.<eos> Who said I was coming?<eos> I did.
- Hey! Were you followed?<eos> Evidently.<eos> Let him in.<eos> Do you solemnly swear that you will tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, upon pains and penalties of perjury?<eos> I do.
- And you're ex...<eos> - NSA.<eos> Badgley is flip-flopping. But, quickest way to get him in line is to mine for sordid details, and then let him know we're in possession of them.<eos> Mr. Schmidt, did you?<eos> Yes, Senator, we did.
- May I ask you a question?<eos> - Go ahead.<eos> Are you Slean's woman?<eos> Only, I saw him leave your home this morning.<eos> You did?
I hear you went native while I was away. - Yeah.<eos> That's one way of putting it.<eos> - You got another way?<eos> Listen, Job, I tried to find you.<eos> We all did.
You see, what Blake's shirt says is inappropriate.<eos> What does it say?<eos> Well...<eos> You know what shirt he was wearing.<eos> I don't.
I understand what you see in Edward.<eos> I get it.<eos> - No.<eos> - No, wait, I do.<eos> - No, you don't.
You clear?<eos> - Mmm-hmm. - All right, let's go, Tony.<eos> Now, we're going to a place you might remember, and you can help yourself out by telling me about it.<eos> But if you don't remember,<eos> Tony does, all right?
It's pussy dust.<eos> Pussy dust.<eos> We get a private room, I'll show you my pussy dust.<eos> You like to party?<eos> Who doesn't?
You like to party?<eos> Who doesn't?<eos> To happy endings.<eos> I love happy endings.<eos> Who doesn't?
- To the printing office?<eos> - Yes.<eos> For two days?<eos> Call the newsroom.<eos> I did.
We've run a story on that, really.<eos> Enjoy, my friend.<eos> So they've really run off.<eos> But we don't know where.<eos> We do.
You really think a dance is all it takes?<eos> Mom, I know that Schmidt is not what you imagined.<eos> Or what I imagined.<eos> I never thought I would fall for the slim-hipped ghost of Tom Cruise.<eos> None of us did.
It was chilling.<eos> The times when your dad was performing in New York, and then we would see each other very often, and that's when they started to go closer.<eos> And then we became his groupies.<eos> When he performed anyplace east of the Mississippi, we would fly out to be there.<eos> One summer, he did two plays.
You sure?<eos> Mm-hmm. If we don't go now, he'll get too far away.<eos> So, you did or you didn't see something?<eos> It's hard to say.<eos> Well, you either did or you didn't, Philip.
He's dead!<eos> Well, maybe it's his ghost. Maybe he's haunting us.<eos> -It's not his ghost.<eos> -So how do you know that?<eos> -I just do!
Look, I'm on your side.<eos> I'm here to help.<eos> I'm gonna make things better around here for all of us.<eos> Thank God you're here.<eos> Do me a favor.
Mike, don't do it. I don't need my baby teeth, Mike!<eos> Mike, seriously, don't!<eos> Mike, don't do it!<eos> Seriously, don't do it, man!<eos> Seriously, don't!
I wanted to tell you, I just--<eos> What if this thing took you, too?<eos> You risked your life... and Nancy's.<eos> I thought I could save Will...<eos> I still do.
Welcome, Professor.<eos> We thank you on behalf of the Committee for making time for this. I know it wasn't easy, and we appreciate that.<eos> Uh, please stand to be sworn in.<eos> Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?<eos> - I do. - Okay.
How can I explain all of this stuff that they say about me? Hmm?<eos> Vile things no child should ever have to hear about their father.<eos> And these men judging me, half of them are under an ethics cloud at this very minute. Money charges, sex charges.<eos> You don't see their lives going up in flames around them, do you?<eos> Do you?
I'm... it's fine.<eos> I really have no gag reflex.<eos> Okay. Open. What did you try to do?<eos> Crack a walnut?<eos> Your wife did some damage here.
Sorry to cut this short, but we've got to skeedads.<eos> Scrivener is waiting for us at Polo Bar, and it's Jade's favorite place to not eat.<eos> Redmond.<eos> - I want this book.<eos> - Everyone does.
I mean, you're an amazing mom, just like you're an amazing big sister.<eos> Well, not always.<eos> Do you remember the day you moved in here?<eos> I put that rope across the room to keep you out of my half.<eos> Yeah, you did.
Dolores, why don't you play a hand?<eos> You're wasting your breath.<eos> Girl'sharboring a grudge.<eos> Idon'tblameyou , sweetheart.<eos> I did some ugly things to you both.
No... .. just curious.<eos> He let vanity get the better of him.<eos> He'd have been much better off letting me win.<eos> Oh, you'll win.<eos> You always do.
- Now, just swing and miss, do you hear?<eos> - He'd have been much better off letting me win.<eos> You always do.
What?<eos> In fact, I just happen to have, by chance, one or two things... here.<eos> Have a look.<eos> And how did you learn to draw like this, Sooni?<eos> I didn't.
What, when they're asleep?<eos> No, no, I meant when they're peaceful!<eos> You never wanted children of your own?<eos> Yeah, I wanted them.<eos> What wife doesn't?
I heard him.<eos> And you just let him talk about me.<eos> You didn't say anything!<eos> You're right.<eos> I didn't.
- No.<eos> - You guys were taking drugs?<eos> - No, we don't take drugs.<eos> It was medication, you know, like, antidepressants.<eos> Okay, you don't do drugs.
Well, I love you, and I still want you in my life.<eos> Okay, people, what are we doing?<eos> We are well into overtime.<eos> Kimberly Louise Gibbler, do you promise to remain engaged to Fernando for as long as you feel like it?<eos> - I do!
Did you wait?<eos> Not at all.<eos> - Shall we?<eos> - Okay.<eos> How about we do hot pot at my place?
I'm sorry for all the trouble.<eos> Don't mention it.<eos> The two of us didn't work out but I know you'll be fine.<eos> How do you know that?<eos> I don't.
That would explain the cleaner crime scenes.<eos> Except none of those men had drugs in their system.<eos> How in the world?<eos> I have no idea.<eos> But, maybe this guy does.
I am writing the completely true story of the St. Valentine murders.<eos> And what's your version of the completely true story?<eos> The police... Got the wrong guy.<eos> And I assume you have proof to back that up.<eos> I do.
There's something missing.<eos> Bruising around the neck.<eos> Right?<eos> Your guy doesn't have any.<eos> All our male victims did.
I mean, what -- what were you doing? !<eos> I... I-I don't know.<eos> You do know.<eos> No.<eos> You do!
A serene resting place.<eos> You are coming back?<eos> Someone's got to keep you out of trouble.<eos> Tell my sister I said hello, and that I miss her.<eos> I always do.
I have to go.<eos> If there's anything you need, you just talk to him, OK? - OK.<eos> - Have a nice day.<eos> - Do you smoke?<eos> - No, I don't.
So you know, I have a record, but...<eos> Yes, we have that information.<eos> That's not an issue.<eos> The position's yours if you want it.<eos> And you do.
I gotta turn myself in...<eos> Wait, now, hold on!<eos> I gotta tell them what happened...<eos> Yeah, but you don't know what happened.<eos> Yes, I do! Yes, I do!
No, Oscar, this is my thing.<eos> This is my problem.<eos> I'm confused.<eos> Why did you ask me to come out here, then?<eos> Well... I didn't...
I'm the one who stopped looking and got promoted for it.<eos> So blame me.<eos> Hate me.<eos> Because I'm the one who didn't save your son.<eos> No. You didn't.
So, who won that round?<eos> You or the porcelain?<eos> Porcelain. Porcelain's undefeated.<eos> I'm sorry about that, I thought everyone left.<eos> Yes, they did.
She said it so casually.<eos> In the next room, my six-year-old daughter was being taken off life support.<eos> And this woman says "collateral beauty."<eos> People don't know what to say in those moments.<eos> No, she did.
Yes, you're right. I was there in her laugh, but I'm also here now in your pain.<eos> I'm the reason for everything.<eos> I am the only "why."<eos> Don't try and live without me, Howard.<eos> Please don't.
You're home.<eos> All these cars...<eos> I guess someone's having a party.<eos> Oh, dear God.<eos> How did they...
I was pretty good.<eos> People tellin' me I should make a go of it, so...<eos> I took my little brother and we snuck off.<eos> It's not that we didn't love our family.<eos> We did.
There are people there that need help.<eos> Sir?<eos> Sir? What do you mean "people"?<eos> I hope you know I've always thought of you, well, all of you as collaborators, but... you, most of all, I like to think of as a partner.<eos> Don't.
So am I.<eos> Well, we certainly can't move to Florida now.<eos> It looks like you need us again.<eos> Who wants doughnuts?<eos> - I do!
Yeah, sometimes I get donuts.<eos> I just thought I had one thing that I was good at.<eos> My mom wants me out on the street.<eos> Just pay attention to what people say.<eos> Or what they don't.
It has all kinds of secrets in it. Your son Charlie is alive.<eos> Those assholes were close enough to take a picture of my son, and we still don't have him home.<eos> How long you been spying on me, lying to me, selling me out to those killers you work for?<eos> I did it to protect you.<eos> - Bullshit! - You did it for you.
♪<eos> And you know what ATM stands for, right?<eos> Yes.<eos> I don't wanna be the kind of person that gets off on that.<eos> I really don't.
I'm just gonna drive around a bit.<eos> Clear my head.<eos> Hey, hey, cheer up.<eos> Things will look brighter in the morning.<eos> They always do.
Yeah. But you're gonna love what I just heard from this British fruit, Farraday, my guy on the stock loan desk.<eos> Guess which hedge-funder's got himself in a precarious short, ripe for a squeeze?<eos> If you're talking Bobby Axelrod, this just became my favorite round of the year.<eos> - You have details?<eos> - I do.
What is this nonsense about a containment leak?<eos> Yes, th-there... there was a leak, and I'm afraid that the lab is...<eos> Under isolation.<eos> We heard. And when might the lab be safe enough to enter again?<eos> I don't...
I intend to get that sample from Whitney Frost.<eos> The best chance that we have of getting close to Whitney without being detected is her husband's campaign fundraiser tomorrow night at the MacArthur Grand Hotel.<eos> Not an easy ticket to get.<eos> Howard Stark donates money to all the political candidates to ensure good favor with whomever wins, so Mr. Jarvis has two tickets secured.<eos> Of course he does.
Ah, email, email.<eos> Listen, this is the final warning.<eos> Pay me, or you must go.<eos> George, I really think you need to see someone, okay?<eos> I really do, George.
You know, it's a bit ugly, but maybe you'll like it.<eos> It looks good with your beard.<eos> Oh, I like that a lot.<eos> - Huh?<eos> - I do, yeah.
I - I know.<eos> And it's not that big a deal.<eos> You told me that you had a hope...<eos> Like you really hoped that...<eos> Of course I do.
Well, then I'll home school her.<eos> And she can go to AA meetings at night.<eos> What makes you think she'll follow through with it?<eos> Because she said she would.<eos> - Of course she did.
You know, it's... this is how you meet people.<eos> You meet people you know.<eos> It's not like you guys were married.<eos> If I did something immoral, I would feel bad.<eos> I... but I don't because we didn't do anything wrong.
I'm not one of those people who has it easy.<eos> You know, who can just bounce back, pretend like nothing ever happened.<eos> So, you two just had a civil ceremony?<eos> Where'd you and Juliette honeymoon?<eos> We didn't, actually.
Bye.<eos> - ♪ Without you ♪ - May I have this dance?<eos> - ♪ Just one look ♪ - Hey, Mom.<eos> Did you ever love my dad?<eos> Oh, honey, of course I did.
Look, I'm sorry about last night... for what I remember, but mostly for what I don't.<eos> Well, you lived up to Cash's recollection.<eos> You're a mean SOB when you get liquored up.<eos> Listen, whatever nonsense that I was spouting, I didn't mean it.<eos> Yeah, you did.
What, so she can thrive?<eos> So she can bloom?<eos> You don't even know her!<eos> I mean, do you even understand how talented she is?<eos> Yeah, I do!
And I'm sorry about our conversation earlier.<eos> You know, I think as cool as it is to be on the cover of Businessweek, I've lost sight of why I wanted to work with these artists because I've lost sight of myself as an artist.<eos> And I have to admit, the tour for Layla is probably as important for me as it would have been for her.<eos> Want to do 10 dates for the hell of it?<eos> Yeah, I do.
The cops screwed up, and three people died in the crossfire.<eos> There was an investigation, but in the end, Chicago P.D. stuck together.<eos> They blamed the ATF, and they blamed the state police, and they blamed the FBI.<eos> I just wanted somebody to stand up and tell the truth, like I had in the NFL.<eos> But they didn't.
Why would anyone want to?<eos> Yeah, I see your point.<eos> Did you get what you came for?<eos> Well, I came to bring someone back to New York.<eos> So, yeah. I did.
It's okay.<eos> Coming?<eos> Want a beer or something?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Do I?
Ice Nation didn't tell Gina to stay there.<eos> That was me.<eos> Given the information you had at the time, you made a reasonable choice.<eos> You were trying to save lives.<eos> But I didn't.
Then wait for me.<eos> I'll come back.<eos> In this world, when people leave, they don't come back.<eos> - I did.<eos> - Not for me, you didn't.
Titus is right.<eos> I would do anything to save my people.<eos> You know that, but I know them.<eos> Not everyone agrees with Chancellor Pike.<eos> Kane doesn't.
You can't just keep screwing up like this.<eos> It affects everyone.<eos> - You most of all.<eos> - I get it.<eos> I do.
- Well... can't I keep wearing it?<eos> Just let me wear it a little longer.<eos> - Don't forget.<eos> - I won't.<eos> Everyone does.
- if you want to, or...<eos> - Oh, I didn't mean to invite myself.<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> - No. No, no, you didn't.
Coffee<eos> Thank you!<eos> - And your coffee?<eos> - Tea. Already had two cups<eos> Bathroom done, jogging done, shower done...
She wants you to pick it up.<eos> You scared, huh?<eos> Oh! Whoa, whoa, whoa. Whoa.<eos> Anybody else want a taste of Blue Thunder?<eos> Uh, I do. Yeah.
Bart's claiming he's in another dimension, but I think he's just hiding in the closet.<eos> I had 90 days.<eos> I was promised 90 days.<eos> Now you have to give me more time.<eos> Oh, no you don't.
Homer, why were you fishing with Milhouse?<eos> Because for once, I'm with a kid who respects me.<eos> One who doesn't call me "Homer."<eos> I didn't know that bothered you.<eos> It does. A lot.
What?<eos> Well, who are you?<eos> You know who the fuck I am!<eos> And you know what you did!<eos> No, I don't.
Calm down, we're the good guys, I promise you.<eos> - You have to trust us.<eos> Please. - "Trust you"?<eos> You kidnap me, and you hit me with a Winnebago...<eos> We did that for a reason!
Unless we need a big fat paperweight.<eos> I'll paperweight you!<eos> Homie, sweetie, replacing a tile is something you really need a professional for.<eos> I know how to replace a tile.<eos> All guys do.
I threw up on my glasses.<eos> Hot damn.<eos> What the hell was that?<eos> You could've died right there, you know that?<eos> Yeah, I do.
He's a regular guy... nothing to see here.<eos> Trying to get a warrant to search his house.<eos> It's just not that easy.<eos> Do you think I'm lying?<eos> My wife does.
Tell me what color you want me to wear, I'll wear it.<eos> She's a little on edge, but when the time comes, she will knock it out of the park.<eos> The time is tomorrow.<eos> If you want our endorsement and our money, we need to feel confident that she'll toe the party line.<eos> And right now, we don't.
No.<eos> I was afraid.<eos> I didn't have anywhere else to turn.<eos> I didn't know where else to turn.<eos> And now we do.
Assuming Bobbi and Hunter.<eos> The other figures moving in the room... assume bad guys.<eos> One of them has powers, so best we avoid him.<eos> To that end...<eos> At S.H.I.E.L.D., we do better than duct tape.
Maybe you're not supposed to get over it.<eos> Some things you can't move past.<eos> They scar you, change you permanently.<eos> I don't know what happened there, on that planet.<eos> I do.
What do you mean, "both of them"?<eos> Yeah, I made a copy of the tape.<eos> You taught me that.<eos> Always make a copy.<eos> Well, Mindhorn did.
I don't know anything.<eos> I'm actually quite confused.<eos> You know that I killed Moncrief, right?<eos> I did not know that.<eos> Well, you do now.
Previously in "The 100"...<eos> Let the people know they have a new Commander.<eos> You don't have the Flame, Ontari.<eos> - No one knows that.<eos> - He does.
He would beg and beg and beg them to leave him alone, just to stop, right?<eos> They said the only way they'd leave him alone was if he did one thing.<eos> - Uh-huh. - What?<eos> Kill.<eos> Well, like demons do.
They said the only way they'd leave him alone was if he did one thing.<eos> - Uh-huh. - What?<eos> Kill.<eos> Well, like demons do.<eos> Yeah. Like demons do.
Who could blame her?<eos> Go.<eos> What?<eos> Heda requires your presence, Flamekeeper.<eos> Of course she does.
Florida is eight million miles long!<eos> Too bad, Fiona, I'll find him!<eos> He wants to be a pilot, and I'm going to support him.<eos> - He doesn't love you.<eos> - Yes, he does.
Was hoping you would.<eos> Oh, you're doing this wrong.<eos> I mean, you're looking in the wrong place.<eos> So, uh... this Blake guy... he has safehouses, what, all over?<eos> All agents do.
You have to create a coolant system that diffuses core radiation.<eos> The radiation is what's making it impossible for the pods to take it out.<eos> So we need to turn it back into a regular sharknado in order for your pods to work.<eos> But we don't have a body of water that's big enough.<eos> - And, dude, even if you did...
- I'm sorry, Bow.<eos> - Oh.<eos> You know, I don't want to think about not being here for our kids.<eos> Oh, God.<eos> - I don't, either.
- Oh.<eos> You know, I don't want to think about not being here for our kids.<eos> Oh, God.<eos> - I don't, either.<eos> I don't, either.
If you do, the legitimacy of your Khanate will forever be in question.<eos> Your people will wonder why the great Kublai Khan was so afraid to let their voices be heard.<eos> - I'm not afraid.<eos> - I know that.<eos> Once again, they do not.
- How?<eos> What's the most important thing in wrestling?<eos> Tackles.<eos> - You know tackles.<eos> - Did.
Maybe I can break through to get out.<eos> It's the only way we all live today.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Do we even know what we're supposed to be looking for?<eos> We do now.
Listen, Nicolás.<eos> It is you who don't understand.<eos> You haven't noticed that not even your mom loves you?<eos> -My mom loves me.<eos> -No, she doesn't!
It bothers me that Harry put you both in danger to catch Grey.<eos> Yeah but we caught him, didn't we?<eos> And there was no easy way anyone could have managed it.<eos> Also, you know as well what a proper male'd say?<eos> I do.
They did not.<eos> And this low opinion you suffer of Mr. Hafeez?<eos> He is a bad boy, no respect.<eos> Common, you understand.<eos> Oh, I do.
The killing that comes your way, that ain't.<eos> Do you understand what you raise in me, Matthew?<eos> - If this absurd plot of yours fails...<eos> - It won't.<eos> Well, if it does...
Lila.<eos> You speak for the people on this matter of the Huskarla training?<eos> - I do.<eos> - When do we start?<eos> - We don't.
Stop it, Lolly.<eos> We cannot move it.<eos> If I told you I already moved it, would it calm you down?<eos> Maybe for a minute.<eos> Good, 'cause I did.
Hand me the blanket, Miss.<eos> - Miss.<eos> - I'll die.<eos> You won't.<eos> No one does.
Just get better, eh?<eos> If I'm not truly ill, then how can I get better?<eos> If you're not ill, then what are you?<eos> You wouldn't believe me.<eos> Dr. Banning doesn't. My parents don't.
- Up!<eos> Stop!<eos> Up!<eos> GORDON". No, no!<eos> Don't, please.
I would never.<eos> I love Her Majesty. And I... I would never harm anyone.<eos> I can't even imagine wanting to. Please.<eos> You must believe me.<eos> Oh, I do, Mr. Balfour.
I love Her Majesty. And I... I would never harm anyone.<eos> I can't even imagine wanting to. Please.<eos> You must believe me.<eos> Oh, I do, Mr. Balfour.<eos> I most certainly do.
How has he presented himself?<eos> As a Fallen Angel, brother to Lucifer.<eos> Then take that to be truth.<eos> He was cast to Earth, to live among us, assuming different identities over the centuries to protect himself, unnoticed, until he strikes.<eos> And when he does?
Walk the other way?<eos> Never meet me, or her?<eos> You've seen what I come from, that dragon that raised me, that land that reared me.<eos> I've known very little grace in my life.<eos> But I did with her.
The scarab isn't an artifact.<eos> Hi. Abbie, Abbie, Randall is dead.<eos> He's not controlling the Ghoul.<eos> You need to search Nevins.<eos> We did.
I mean, I spent my whole life pretending like his opinion didn't matter to me.<eos> And I have just been trying for so long to understand him.<eos> And, you know what, man, I think I finally do.<eos> You loved him, Atticus.<eos> We both did.
It's the exact coordinates of the nine sacred sites.<eos> Well, I can't tell you how much this means to us.<eos> Well, I don't really care.<eos> I just retired.<eos> Yes, Mr. Nevins you just did.
Thank you so much for joining me.<eos> I know how busy you must be.<eos> But we're gonna be working together on this eviction so I thought, well, let's break some bread.<eos> I've always been friends of y'all, you know that.<eos> Mm, I do.
I saw someone in the hallway.<eos> Someone Mrs. Stilinski didn't see.<eos> Well, if Claudia is not seeing ghosts, maybe it's because she's not a Banshee.<eos> I think he was trying to help me find something Stiles left behind. A relic.<eos> Did you?
You got to do it.<eos> I'm guessing you might be a little bit mad right now, but, trust me, you have nothing to worry about.<eos> I just want back what's mine, starting with my dark objects, and I figured I needed to get your attention.<eos> So do I have it?<eos> In point of fact, you do.
Yeah, well, they're my eggs and I made the decision so I need to do it.<eos> You can say whatever you wanna say.<eos> I don't care.<eos> Just promise me you won't tell my mom.<eos> Emily, Elliott didn't.
Candidates' Daughters In Boyfriend Brawl.<eos> That isn't exactly explosive, political cannon fodder.<eos> And this isn't exactly the race for a senior class president.<eos> We don't do those kinds of things anymore.<eos> Do we, Spencer?
Together, they're more.<eos> They're inspiring.<eos> So here they are together again making a new commitment to be there for the best week ever and the worst week ever which sometimes happens in the same week.<eos> Byron, Ella do you promise to love, comfort and honor each other for the rest of your lives?<eos> We do.
Well, it's funny because that may not be as big a lie as you think.<eos> Ezra... called Jillian to try and get me off the hook and... Ended up asking for me to be his co-author.<eos> I mean, obviously, I had no idea that he was gonna do that.<eos> He didn't even have any idea he was gonna do that...<eos> Oh, yeah, he did.
I don't even know why I'm surprised.<eos> You're surprised because you're hoping that he's the parent you've always wanted him to be, the parent you deserve.<eos> In an extremely ironic role reversal, my mother was smarter than me.<eos> She said, "People don't change, no matter how much you want them to."<eos> Some people don't.
Look, I know how you ake everything on, everyone's problems.<eos> It's one of the things I love the most about you.<eos> But you can't fix his one, Ollie.<eos> I have to try.<eos> No, you don't.
There's still some concern about the Star City operation.<eos> Enlighten me.<eos> Phase 5 requires control over city hall, yet somehow we've found ourselves mired in a petty political race to see that happen.<eos> We didn't exactly plan on<eos> Oliver Queen, did we?
Tommy Merlyn was--was one of the greatest people that I've ever known.<eos> He was--he was so much more than just... A billionaire playboy.<eos> I loved him.<eos> I loved him in-- in every way you could possibly love someone.<eos> And so did Oliver...
You spared the life of the man who killed your mother.<eos> And you killed a friend of mine.<eos> You killed tens of thousands of innocent people.<eos> With Slade Wilson, I had a choice.<eos> This time, I don't.
I think we got another beatboxer in the office.<eos> Ders, go in there and then rap over his flow, and I'll FaceTime Pauly.<eos> - Yeah, I'll do that, yeah.<eos> - You got his number!<eos> Yes, I did.
Friends who will turn on you, who will try and sabotage the connection we share.<eos> Only because they don't understand, but they will if we can make them share our connection.<eos> You want to put your friends through the Kree experiment.<eos> Once Radcliffe has worked out the kinks, yeah.<eos> Yeah, I do.
Do you reject the glamour of evil and refuse to be mastered by sin?<eos> I do.<eos> Do you believe in God, the Father Almighty, - creator of heaven and Earth? - I do.<eos> Do you believe in Jesus Christ, his only son our Lord, who was born of the Virgin Mary, was crucified, died and was buried, rose from the dead and is now seated at the right hand of the Father?<eos> I do.
- I mean exactly where it was? - Yes.<eos> Neighbour says the car's gone.<eos> Hasn't seen him in a couple of days.<eos> I'd say, DS Mclntosh, we have reason to believe Mr McDade's life may be in danger.<eos> Don't we?
No, but maybe there's more there that could help us find him.<eos> - Alice?<eos> - Yeah?<eos> - So, I found the forger.<eos> - You did?
That's crazy!<eos> - Awesome.<eos> - Well played, gentlemen.<eos> All right. Thank you.<eos> Well done, slick.
- You texted me.<eos> - You invited me.<eos> No, I didn't.<eos> Says so right here.<eos> No, he didn't.
Morgan and Stephanie love each other, right?<eos> So all you have to do is convince them that marriage is still worth it.<eos> You still believe that, don't you?<eos> That part wasn't a lie.<eos> I do.
Still waiting on Valentine's thank-you card.<eos> Opening the gates of hell...<eos> that's a little more tricky.<eos> Valentine doesn't have the cards.<eos> I do.
Ground me?<eos> Maureen called us this morning and she was very upset.<eos> Actually, Maureen called me... and she said that you were spazzing out, like more than normal.<eos> She said...<eos> She did what?
Who? I have no idea.<eos> But I might be able to help you figure out why.<eos> First question I'd ask is:<eos> Why did Verna McBride deserve to die?<eos> - She didn't.
- I can't live with it.<eos> - I remember that pain ... sick with guilt, anger.<eos> I know why you went to face Hive alone.<eos> I tried. I tried to defeat him.<eos> - I did, but I ...
- I don't know.<eos> - Who sent it ?<eos> The number's not in my phone, I don't know.<eos> Must be the wrong number, I don't know.<eos> What do I do ?
- What's your name?<eos> - Kyle.<eos> Kyle. You think you're too good for us, Kyle?<eos> No, all right?<eos> No. Yes, you do.
Finn can purge it himself.<eos> He's earned the agony.<eos> Besides, you know how much I love burning things to the ground.<eos> Klaus, when you said that you wanted to work together for Hope's sake, I wanted to see what that looked like.<eos> And now I do.
I kept Hayley breathing!<eos> I kept white oak from piercing your cold, black heart.<eos> I did everything!<eos> We know.<eos> No, you don't.
I kept white oak from piercing your cold, black heart.<eos> I did everything!<eos> We know.<eos> No, you don't.<eos> No, you don't.
It's probably better if you just stay here.<eos> She's aware that you and Hope are under my protection.<eos> Unfortunately for Mary, that didn't do much for her grandson, did it?<eos> You know I couldn't prevent that.<eos> Yes, I do.
I can't see you again, Asa.<eos> When you left, he was there, and he'll always be there.<eos> He doesn't run.<eos> You love him?<eos> I do.
He died by his fire, and so will you.<eos> All right.<eos> All right. You're right, Ma.<eos> All right, I deserve to perish.<eos> I do. All right?
You think on that.<eos> My guy doesn't know anything. How 'bout yours?<eos> Well, he didn't kill Breece.<eos> - Well, how do you know?<eos> - 'Cause I do.
Nothing else!<eos> Nothing!<eos> Sexual assault is the hardest crime to prosecute.<eos> Most times, these investigations don't go forward.<eos> They just don't.
Plus, he kept asking what Valentine's room looked like.<eos> He was interested in Valentine's style?<eos> Fascinating...<eos> No, he thought I might have seen something that could help us find him.<eos> And did you?
Then I'm glad you did it for you.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You have an interesting effect on people, Clary Fray.<eos> He helped save Luke's life.<eos> You all did.
Hi! Good to see you all.<eos> -When did you last see him?<eos> -This morning at the hotel.<eos> After his Coco Pops, he said he was gonna go and take that ladder back and meet me here.<eos> Well, why didn't he do it yesterday?
Finals!<eos> It's good she's got a scholarship.<eos> It depends on her final grades.<eos> - Stuff like this happens.<eos> - Around here, it does!
But the bus didn't come. I mean, it was late.<eos> So when I arrived, Eliza wasn't there, where we usually meet.<eos> I see.<eos> Did you call her?<eos> Of course I did, only it didn't...
It just looks like a wine glass.<eos> That wine glass saved your life.<eos> What if... what if I hadn't gotten the Cup out in time?<eos> - That demon...<eos> - But you did.
If we needed to, I would have called Luke.<eos> I just want to know if he's all right.<eos> I saw him.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> You did?
Simon, I would not blame you if you...<eos> What?<eos> Killed you?<eos> Don't you understand anything?<eos> No, I don't.
No. The people are upset.<eos> Our polls show a referendum to abolish would pass in a landslide.<eos> When it does, what change will you be able to affect then?<eos> Who said I wanted to change things?<eos> You did.
Maybe you quit the force for a wayward girl who needed your help.<eos> Did I guess it?<eos> - Her name is Sarah.<eos> - You have a daughter...<eos> I do now.
Then I heard her shout.<eos> Scream.<eos> It was a grown man.<eos> Who did you see?<eos> I didn't.
The point is, you were safe, okay?<eos> I just... wanted you to know that.<eos> Guess I'm just supposed to take your word on that.<eos> Classy.<eos> - Nothing to do with my word, lady.
Hello, boys.<eos> Do you remember when we met... you told me you'd never abandon me?<eos> It's funny.<eos> For the life of me... I can't remember being so naive I'd believe you.<eos> But I did.
I mean, it would require payoffs, bribes...<eos> This guy's a ghost.<eos> He works alone or close to it. I just...<eos> - How do you know?<eos> - I just do.
Stop thinking about screwing up, about losing.<eos> You need to think about winning.<eos> Colonel Ray Schoonover, United States Marine Corps.<eos> Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help you God?<eos> I do.
Ha! I could really get used to this.<eos> Stay on him, Ray.<eos> Stay on him.<eos> I had it covered.<eos> Sure, you did.
And I'm pretty sure that saving it counts.<eos> I'm pretty sure it does too.<eos> See you soon.<eos> You know, I would've stayed for you.<eos> I do.
Oh, by the way, I'm going to be real pissed about this whole roofie thing,<eos> - but I do get over it.<eos> - Roofie thing?<eos> - I-I would never dream...<eos> - Yeah, you do...
Got it.<eos> Lindsay was last seen talking to the lead scumbag.<eos> The founder, Carver Cruz.<eos> So he was interrogated?<eos> Yep, but his lawyer did all the talking.
Cheers!<eos> Maze!<eos> You haven't wished me happy birthday.<eos> The Devil doesn't have a birthday.<eos> Well, I do now.
Oh. Are you sure?<eos> Very much so.<eos> Very well.<eos> If, uh... if you think it's best.<eos> I do.
God has faith in him.<eos> In all of us.<eos> Even in our darkest moments.<eos> Oh, you really believe that.<eos> I do.
Stop!<eos> I believe they call this interrogating.<eos> Lucifer, stop!<eos> - He needs to tell me where my stuff is.<eos> - Don't.
A few bad apples shouldn't paint us all in a bad light, now should it, ma'am?<eos> But it does paint you as suspects.<eos> Hey, look, just because we have a reputation as outlaws doesn't mean we had anything to do with a murder.<eos> You like being considered a criminal, don't you?<eos> Yeah, you do.
We have some questions for you.<eos> NAOMI:<eos> You think I killed Javier?<eos> Well, I don't.<eos> But she definitely does.
I punish evil.<eos> Yeah, but, but you're, you know...<eos> The devil, yes.<eos> And you think you know who that is, don't you?<eos> The whole world does.
Hey, she did just fine for 25 years.<eos> Or, she was really good at pretending.<eos> I know you think your mom is this heartless, narcissistic monster...<eos> - Your words...<eos> - Some days, I do too.
Mississippi.<eos> You forgot Mississippi.<eos> Mississippi.<eos> God damn.<eos> I always do that.
And then... yank.<eos> It is going to be all right.<eos> You just have to tell the truth.<eos> They won't believe me.<eos> Nobody does.
Your head ain't right.<eos> I threw it after we crossed the overpass.<eos> E, we wasn't even on the freeway.<eos> How do you know where I threw it, huh?<eos> E. Huh? You don't.
I threw my back out at Pilates.<eos> It's killing me.<eos> I was trying to get extra bendy for my honeymoon with Brad, if you know what I mean. Huh?<eos> Well, you got a guy 15 years younger than you, so I think Bendy Bonnie knows what she's doing.<eos> Yeah, she does.
No!<eos> I like you.<eos> I like me, too.<eos> You just said, "I like me, too."<eos> No, I didn't. No. Yes, you did.
I like you.<eos> I like me, too.<eos> You just said, "I like me, too."<eos> No, I didn't. No. Yes, you did.<eos> You totally did.
You're the kind of player who should write for himself.<eos> And if I don't get it, then I'll move to Naperville with you guys.<eos> Miles.<eos> No.<eos> You don't...
You know, school's not gonna be the same without you.<eos> Nothing is.<eos> Jude. I'm sorry, okay?<eos> I want to stay.<eos> Really, I do.
Um, I'll be back Friday.<eos> - This can't be my life.<eos> Jules, it can't be.<eos> - I wanted to see the fireworks.<eos> I really did.
- You have any idea where he is right now?<eos> Why would you do this?<eos> - She didn't.<eos> Not by herself.<eos> Did you?
-I'm sorry. I was just... resting here.<eos> All night.<eos> You told him.<eos> I did.<eos> I did.
And married me 24 hours after he did the stupid thing he did!<eos> He wanted to tell you, but I wouldn't let him.<eos> Not before you went into surgery.<eos> -So you knew?<eos> -Yes. Everyone did.
I dig you.<eos> I mean, that's before I found out you were Ted Nugent.<eos> So what is it?<eos> You don't want to hear about the Chilean soap opera that's become my life.<eos> Actually, I do.
There you go, guys.<eos> But-- But why not stay a pilot?<eos> Because I almost died.<eos> I was-- I was flying over Lake Placid one day, and my co-pilot dared me to walk out on the wing and jump.<eos> So I did.
Your book was right there in the gift store.<eos> Oh, my God, will you sign?<eos> Hello?<eos> Libby, I know you probably don't want to talk to me right now. You're right.<eos> I don't.
I brought you something.<eos> When you came out of stasis, you had no memory, but you knew the right thing to do because you are who you are.<eos> Never forget that.<eos> You manage to crack the file? Yeah.<eos> Yeah, I did.
Emile Sayles, enters her life and takes control not just of her piano but nearly everything she does.<eos> He pushed her until she broke.<eos> And you think she's still under his influence?<eos> Yes, ma'am.<eos> I do.
Thank God I could vent about her on our walks.<eos> You know, she vented about you, too, sunshine.<eos> -When?<eos> -On my walks I took with her right after the walks I took with you.<eos> -You did a lot of walking.
"Para-Been To Hell And Back."<eos> You have. Twice.<eos> Two times.<eos> Don't change the subject, Grace.<eos> I didn't.
- He had every right. If a member of the House Intelligence Committee chooses to share information with me, he's at liberty to do so.<eos> Our conversation was in confidence.<eos> I don't feel comfortable with this.<eos> The Congressman is just as frustrated as you are, and he spoke to me because he wants to help.<eos> And so do I, General.
Hello.<eos> Hello?<eos> The family was told not to contact anyone.<eos> They didn't.<eos> The cruise line did.
It's what makes me think you're lying.<eos> Of course he's lying.<eos> Look at him.<eos> If you hadn't seen the Carsons, why didn't you just tell us?<eos> I did!
Of course he's lying.<eos> Look at him.<eos> If you hadn't seen the Carsons, why didn't you just tell us?<eos> I did!<eos> I did!
Describe him.<eos> The vendor said he was a clean-cut man in his 20s or 30s wearing Western clothes.<eos> Body language and linguistics make me think he was telling the truth, but he was holding something back.<eos> - I don't know what.<eos> - I do.
No.<eos> Stop it!<eos> You're hurting him!<eos> Please! Please!<eos> Don't!
All things considered?<eos> You think so?<eos> You think it's all gonna be okay?<eos> Kind of.<eos> Yeah, I do.
What?<eos> - Ice-skating.<eos> - I don't know how to ice-skate.<eos> - Yes, you do.<eos> Because I do.
And as soon as she could escape, she'd be coming for you.<eos> I actually believed it.<eos> Hmm, so did I.<eos> I wanted so bad to believe that there was someone out there who loved me.<eos> And now someone actually does.
Why me?<eos> This is how it came down.<eos> The doctor wanted you.<eos> But to tell you the truth, I had it in for you, too.<eos> You did a job in Vegas a year ago.
Like, permanently?<eos> Girls, you know I love you. But it's out of my hands now.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I wish things had turned out differently.<eos> We all do.
Every time I get to this one part, I just... Ugh.<eos> I don't know how to explain it.<eos> You get in your head?<eos> Get scared you're gonna mess up and let everyone down?<eos> Then you do? Yeah.
Leave me alone.<eos> We got this, girls.<eos> March it out.<eos> Well, for whatever it's worth, dad, I didn't notice.<eos> Gloria did.
[ Sighs ] In many ways, you fetched me!<eos> [ Cheers and applause ]<eos> [ Clears throat ] You caught me.<eos> I know they're not coming back.<eos> Mm, sometimes they do.
Need some help?<eos> Too little, too late, Jake Riley.<eos> Officer.<eos> Your friend Major Carnahan said you might be of some assistance.<eos> Oh, did he?
Put the gun down, man.<eos> OK, you don't want to do that.<eos> - It's good.<eos> - You're right.<eos> I don't.
Thought this thing was only transmitted through fluids.<eos> You cage us like animals and leave us out here to die!<eos> - Open up! - Today... We're getting out!<eos> Your job was to find a spot where they would not see us taking the child.<eos> And they didn't!
Be your puppet?<eos> To smile and lie for you?<eos> Information needs to be managed in a crisis.<eos> I thought you understood that.<eos> Oh, I do.
We won't know for a little while.<eos> Do you think it will?<eos> I want it to.<eos> Do you have a mom?<eos> I did.
I'm not mad at you, Thomas.<eos> Not even a little bit.<eos> No one is, not even Quentin.<eos> I didn't mean to make Mary sick.<eos> Of course you didn't.
It's safe, Jake.<eos> I know what you're gonna say, but... but I miss Lex.<eos> I have to try.<eos> So please don't judge me.<eos> I don't.
- And I'm going to give you a use for it which will give us the power to rewrite destiny itself.<eos> Change the course of the entire world.<eos> So if Savage plans on blowing up the world three times,<eos> - how do we stop him?<eos> - We don't.
People shouldn't kill each other.<eos> That's what I believe.<eos> That's what I'll always believe.<eos> - I know that.<eos> - We all do.
You will never see my daughter again!<eos> Psycho.<eos> I cannot believe this...<eos> when'd you learn how to drive?<eos> I didn't.
The past is the past, Gil.<eos> I'm about to get married.<eos> Do you think I'm gonna throw that away just so you can...?<eos> - Did you forget what happened?<eos> - Yes, I did!
We say nothing.<eos> We can't leave Kevin at their mercy.<eos> - Yes we can.<eos> - We need to save him.<eos> No we don't.
Oh, my God.<eos> Well, thank you, Peter.<eos> This was a lovely evening.<eos> I'm glad you liked it.<eos> I really did.
- No kids?<eos> - Nope, you?<eos> Me what?<eos> Do you have any kids?<eos> Well, of... of course I do.
Yes, could I get a glass of the '98 Lafitte Rothschild Bordeaux?<eos> Make it a bottle.<eos> Let me ask you something, are you happy doing this job?<eos> We all have to work.<eos> Do we, though?
Come on in.<eos> So, who referred you to me?<eos> I...really must thank them.<eos> Oh. I don't need a haircut.<eos> You don't?
Damn it.<eos> Oh, why am I not allowed one single victory?<eos> I am always the one to suffer.<eos> [Sighs] There is no God.<eos> Did you just...
How does that happen?<eos> She made a bad choice, and I blame her.<eos> Don't look at me like that.<eos> I know it doesn't make sense, and I know you won't understand.<eos> Actually, I do.
I am so embarrassed. [Chuckles]<eos> Wait.<eos> You don't have to go.<eos> Yes!<eos> Yes, I do.
I thought you'd be jealous.<eos> I am.<eos> But I'm also happy for you.<eos> You don't mean that.<eos> Yeah, I do.
- Yes. Spence Westmore is an escaped murderer.<eos> We have orders.<eos> Now, if he resists capture, we will shoot to kill.<eos> I understand why Peter wouldn't talk to me after what I did.<eos> You didn't do anything.
I hope that's all right.<eos> No snooping, you.<eos> Polly!<eos> I am very seldom required to wear white by my employers.<eos> But, anyway, I always do.
The winter of that year proved to be unseasonably warm, and by February, all that was left of the snow on the sides of the highways had turned mostly black.<eos> It rained too much in the spring, and the fruit in the trees hung heavy at the ends of bent branches.<eos> The sun in the summer months was unreasonably hot and stung my bare shoulders whenever I let it.<eos> I remember thinking that it felt like fall would never come.<eos> And then it never did.
Yes, it is.<eos> - Who wants to hear my writing?<eos> - No, too rude.<eos> - I'd rather die.<eos> - Good, Theo does.
- Oh, dear.<eos> Nancy feels, and, well, I agree with her, but less so...<eos> - Oh, bloody hell, Larry.<eos> - OK, we by which I mean Nancy, but a proportion of me want to find our own place to live.<eos> No, you don't.
I...<eos> I can write for money.<eos> I'm sad, too.<eos> Erm... just in case this helps at all, we think it's fine if Larry leaves.<eos> - We do. - Yeah.
- Is it sex in a home?<eos> - No.<eos> - I give up, then.<eos> - I think I might know.<eos> - Of course you do.
By the time we scale those cliffs, Zoom could already...<eos> I need a minute.<eos> Barry, I know you... can't give up your speed to that monster, but...<eos> I also know that I want to get my son back, and I don't know what to do.<eos> I do.
Ever since the skies parted and showed me another world... with another speedster.<eos> Once I saw you, I came here, figured out what I had to do.<eos> How are you still alive?<eos> We saw you die.<eos> You did.
It's a gold for Geeta!<eos> Geeta has achieved the impossible!<eos> She is the first ever female Indian wrestler, to win gold at the Commonwealth Games!<eos> Who would have thought that a girl from a small village in India, is capable of leaving her mark on the whole world!<eos> Well done, Geeta!
Suit or no suit... that guy is a hero.<eos> That's everything you asked for.<eos> How do you sleep at night?<eos> Knowing you've destroyed so many people's lives?<eos> I don't.
I mean, the amount of will it takes to forgive your son's killer?<eos> Who does that?<eos> Not to say that I can't see the other side of it.<eos> How do you know he won't go out and kill again?<eos> You don't.
- She's thinking about it.<eos> She'll say yes.<eos> My point is I might have to go to church so I can atone for my sins.<eos> Mm. You have to believe in God for that.<eos> Or maybe you do now.
I know what you are.<eos> So, you want to change your life, or are you happy just to stay Annalise Keating's bitch?<eos> Just tell me.<eos> We found her.<eos> Well, Oliver did.
Yeah, I do just... I want to say this.<eos> It was bad morally.<eos> I feel that.<eos> I just don't want you to think that I didn't... enjoy it.<eos> Because I did... uh, thoroughly.
See, if people want a piece of you, you give it to them, right?<eos> Ch. Is that what people want?<eos> A piece of you?<eos> Do YOU play video games?<eos> No. My kids do.
Of course you're not in there.<eos> Why the fuck am I yelling?<eos> This is stupid.<eos> - How'd it go?<eos> It didn't. Why?
Please. I'm trying to give you the out.<eos> Please just take the out.<eos> I don't want an out.<eos> - I know who you are.<eos> - No, you don't.
Please just take the out.<eos> I don't want an out.<eos> - I know who you are.<eos> - No, you don't.<eos> Yeah, I do.
That was the last time I saw her.<eos> They sent me on assignment that night.<eos> It wasn't till I got to Bangkok that I heard rumors about them trying to turn a Hexenbiest into a warrior.<eos> But nobody told me if it worked.<eos> It did.
He'll contact you later.<eos> It'll be a public place.<eos> Are you sure that's a good idea?<eos> I have to deal with this.<eos> Yeah, you do.
Guard!<eos> Guard! Soon as we showed them the mark, Billie's parents backed off.<eos> Told us to get off their property.<eos> They said Billie was living a life of courage and conviction.<eos> - You do a background on the parents?
You mean what she did.<eos> What you did.<eos> You still think you're talking to Juliette.<eos> I don't know who I'm talking to.<eos> Yes, you do.
- What?<eos> Your car smells like a pee wee soccer team threw up in there.<eos> I cleaned it three times.<eos> You said it didn't smell anymore.<eos> Well, it does.
Dude, I'm not sure you can get V.D. off a finger.<eos> The Venice Dog Clinic.<eos> Look, man, at least he had the guts to come and tell you.<eos> I just...<eos> I don't...
Sometimes it's good to let go of the past.<eos> Yeah, but does this need to be one of those "sometimes"?<eos> Are you ever going to sign our divorce?<eos> I think it might help untangle you, set you free.<eos> - I did.
But I could spot their tells from my apartment.<eos> A nervous knee, a finger twitch.<eos> Handler didn't blink... just like you.<eos> It's true the world doesn't know where my son is, but neither do you.<eos> Only I do.
- Oh. - Of course we don't mind.<eos> I'll pay for the utility bill this month.<eos> - Not necessary, Mother.<eos> - Oh, I insist.<eos> Of course you do.
- Yeah, I'm just worried about you.<eos> Is... is Mike really pissed at me?<eos> No, he's just sad, I think.<eos> He misses you.<eos> We all do.
The problem is...<eos> How can they not know?<eos> They don't pay 'em!<eos> No, they do!<eos> The biscuit factory does.
Yeah, but in a bad way.<eos> No!<eos> He talked about bringing you milk.<eos> And how he upset you by bringing his friend and how much he wishes he hadn't done that now because that seemed to spoil everything.<eos> Did he...?
These are the first few photos clues texted this morning.<eos> Yeah. And we already had those photos.<eos> Can we trace the numbers receiving the texts?<eos> Negative.<eos> Or the number doing the texting?
Mrs. Van Owen makes the tea party look liberal.<eos> Once she found out Peter was in a three-way marriage... That was it.<eos> So you went behind his back and offered to take over.<eos> I didn't do anything wrong.<eos> Well you certainly didn't do anything right.
They gave the Cup to Lydia.<eos> You're free to go.<eos> You were right, they came back.<eos> You knew!<eos> Oh, I didn't actually.
Why you?<eos> Because, Belle, I'm the only who's been there.<eos> Plus, my blood can summon the ferry.<eos> Just come back to me.<eos> I always do.
Talk to me.<eos> He doesn't know we came for him.<eos> We... he doesn't know we're here.<eos> He doesn't know that I care.<eos> Yes, he does.
Don't take it personally.<eos> "Don't take it personally"?<eos> I have a family, Matt.<eos> So did I, and a girlfriend and a life.<eos> And now I don't.
Yes.<eos> A nice little visit.<eos> It's the least I can do for one of my fans.<eos> So, how'd it go?<eos> It didn't.
Well, this is great.<eos> They're going to be so excited.<eos> They've been looking for you everywhere.<eos> But how do we get out of here?<eos> We don't, Max.
I do believe in ghosts.<eos> I do believe in ghosts.<eos> I do.<eos> I do believe in ghosts.<eos> I do.
- So does she.<eos> If I had more,<eos> I'd give you more.<eos> Yeah.<eos> But you don't.
We're forever linked, you and I.<eos> How do you know I don't want to stake you?<eos> Do you?<eos> No.<eos> I do.
- Is Genji your aunt?<eos> - Oh, hey, Alice.<eos> - Is that Genji?<eos> - Do you guys know her?<eos> Everyone does.
They told you not to travel, eh?<eos> Too unpredictable, too hard to control...<eos> Yeah, because it is.<eos> I got zero control.<eos> I don't...
- Because you cannot contradict me.<eos> - You are a fraud. - Meriwether?<eos> What's she doing here?<eos> She knows about me.<eos> She does.
Mrs. Finch.<eos> May I come in?<eos> Thank you for having me over.<eos> I assume if you knew anything about Brian's whereabouts, you would tell us, yes?<eos> I don't.
I'm not formally representing my daughter.<eos> I wanted to speak candidly with you, Agent Harris, because frankly...<eos> I'm pissed.<eos> I understand.<eos> No, you don't.
This all happened when we came back to town.<eos> - You don't think I might be a target?<eos> - Listen, this guy's crazy.<eos> I don't know what to think.<eos> Nobody does, okay?
Wow. Who's next?<eos> What about that boy that you had a crush on in Bio?<eos> She can't hear you.<eos> You don't know that.<eos> Yes, I do.
- Thank you.<eos> If you have any questions...<eos> Ask you?<eos> You're Sarah, I take it.<eos> How did you...?
So what?<eos> Serial killers have groupies.<eos> What if Tom is the brains, and he's got someone on the outside being the brawn?<eos> Yeah, but he doesn't see anyone. I mean, except for me.<eos> Yes, he does.
I'm not done.<eos> My mother.<eos> Did you kill her?<eos> Yes.<eos> In a way, I did.
Yeah. Yeah, you ain't working, you ain't providing.<eos> Shit, you probably ain't even putting it down.<eos> - Man, hey. - Nah, nah, no disrespect.<eos> You love your girl and shit, right?<eos> Yeah, I do, I just...
Uh, no.<eos> Again, that's Madalena.<eos> Isabella is in Hortensia.<eos> I don't think he knows what he's talking about.<eos> No, I do.
Can we page him again, please?<eos> Sorry about that.<eos> Something came up.<eos> Dr. Harris, I was starting to worry you weren't gonna show up.<eos> Ready to do this?
Ladies and gentleman, it's my pleasure to introduce to you my good friend, and Portland's next mayor, Andrew Dixon.<eos> Thank you, Sean.<eos> And thank all of you for coming out today.<eos> Did you know that between 1524 and 1526 over 100,000 German peasants were killed in these woods?<eos> I did not.
Thank you.<eos> I know who you really are, Raymond.<eos> Who you are to her.<eos> And I know why you did this.<eos> Does she?
- Yeah. - Hey, I want to show you something.<eos> I got this thing on my shoulder, might be a mole.<eos> Could be a... wax burn from some degrading role play.<eos> You know what I'm talking about, don't you?<eos> Yeah, I do.
- How?<eos> I work in the art world as a part-time full-nude model.<eos> I am such an idiot.<eos> I don't know why I had to go so big with my apology.<eos> I do.
That's unfortunate.<eos> You're in the land of lies.<eos> You're really good at it.<eos> Do I know how to be a real shit?<eos> I do.
Never again.<eos> I could have been caught.<eos> I did it.<eos> - You saw them?<eos> - I did.
We're gonna get you through this, you need to trust me.<eos> Even when you're in the dark.<eos> Even when you're falling.<eos> I trust you, sweetheart.<eos> I do.
Let's go.<eos> I appreciate your condolences, Madam Secretary.<eos> But they won't bring back President Ostrova, nor will they alter the fact that Ukraine abrogated the ceasefire by assassinating her.<eos> President Ostrova wanted peace.<eos> She didn't.
15 minutes.<eos> Then that's how long we have to get her away from him.<eos> Keep them here, no matter what.<eos> Okay, do you remember before, when I told you that I wanted to die?<eos> I did, for a very, very long time.
Keep them here, no matter what.<eos> Okay, do you remember before, when I told you that I wanted to die?<eos> I did, for a very, very long time.<eos> Yeah. I don't know how you got through that.<eos> I didn't.
Did you see this boy?<eos> Not at my booth.<eos> That poor family.<eos> I saw that kid.<eos> I do, uh, custom cabinetry.
Exactly like that.<eos> And then what?<eos> And then you pour alcohol all over it.<eos> That can't possibly work.<eos> No, it does!
Don't worry, it's just to record what happens in here.<eos> And these four cameras... they do the same.<eos> We call this an ABE interview.<eos> My family, I want to see them.<eos> Of course you do.
Tinned food.<eos> I ate from the can.<eos> No spoon.<eos> We had to earn the right to a spoon.<eos> I never did.
You don't know where your mum lives?<eos> OK, I get the point.<eos> It's not...<eos> Why don't you know where she is?<eos> I just don't.
You have the right to legal representation.<eos> Would you like to take that right?<eos> I don't know what I'm supposed to have done.<eos> Answer the question.<eos> No, I don't.
Well, God bless the children that had to listen to that.<eos> Well, it's gonna be very interesting, Earl.<eos> I don't think I ever remember you playing sober.<eos> You always said the junk gave you the funk.<eos> - I did? - Mm-hmm.
Mike. She was good, Harvey.<eos> - Yeah, so were you.<eos> - You were great.<eos> She was better. Everything she said was true and the jury knows it.<eos> No they don't.
Then I'll get right to it.<eos> I need a favor.<eos> You got a truck needs fixing?<eos> I want to know what that verdict was gonna be.<eos> No, you don't.
I need a favor.<eos> You got a truck needs fixing?<eos> I want to know what that verdict was gonna be.<eos> No, you don't.<eos> Yeah, I do.
[ Telephone rings in distance ]<eos> I'm excited to speak with him.<eos> I know you're there, and I know you told them about Shell Island.<eos> But since you're not me, you didn't receive an invitation, and you don't know when and where the meeting is taking place.<eos> I do.
Habeas corpus isn't on the menu today, not when we're dealing with matters of national security.<eos> So, who do you work for?<eos> The men who took you were former Marines.<eos> Did you know that?<eos> No, I-I didn't.
You have pushed those kids away from you.<eos> This last year, you have shoved them away.<eos> - But work was always first for you.<eos> - I know I've had my crap, too.<eos> - You do... for a living, but that always
Some kind of a riot or something?<eos> Taylor, I have to say, I thought you got a...<eos> I thought the school could have handled your situation better.<eos> I see things here sometimes, and... I just think you deserve better than how you were treated.<eos> A lot of us do.
Yeah.<eos> Leslie should've settled this thing a long time ago.<eos> There are a lot of us who think there need to be changes.<eos> But the school board is split on Leslie, and she's got a lot of donors who like her.<eos> A lot of people don't.
Nothing.<eos> Something happens, and you never got anything to do with it!<eos> First time the police came... after the Captains' party, I could've told them about all the liquor you bought, all the drugs, all the girls you got to come around and get screwed.<eos> I didn't.<eos> Nobody did.
What I feel...<eos> Do you feel guilty about anything else?<eos> You know how, um... my mom gave me up once?<eos> I know why she did, but I, um, never really got it.<eos> Now I do.
- She just ditched it.<eos> - She what?<eos> Well, either that, or she's currently laying down in the middle of the Pulaski Bridge.<eos> I'm gonna say she ditched it.<eos> Of course she did.
They told us everything.<eos> Yeah, the underage drinking and the trespassing, we expected.<eos> The prostitutes and the heroin, now that we didn't think was coming.<eos> What? The prostitutes?<eos> We didn't...
Are you hurt?<eos> Please, stop! Stop!<eos> I have to get you to a hospital!<eos> I didn't understand what happened.<eos> I still don't.
Hey. Things got kind of cray.<eos> How you doin'?<eos> Like someone out of clues.<eos> Look, I know we're at a dead end right now, but we will figure this out.<eos> We always do.
Why?<eos> Maggie: I didn't know anything about this chamber.<eos> This is your lab!<eos> How could you not know?<eos> - 'Cause I didn't.
- He doesn't mean that.<eos> - Yes, I do.<eos> So you don't like it?<eos> He likes it.<eos> We both do.
She's not responsible for what happened to that boy.<eos> It doesn't matter.<eos> The moment she left this office with those files, she broke the law.<eos> She had my permission.<eos> Did she?
Oh. Sorry, I...<eos> I don't have a reservation for tonight.<eos> Booked under David Wagner?<eos> He gave very specific instructions to call this number.<eos> Wh-When did he...
Now what?<eos> Okay, those wire bundles control the communication going in and out of the building.<eos> Phone, cable, Internet.<eos> Okay, how do we know which ones to disable?<eos> You don't.
I'm afraid so.<eos> My wife and I hosted the cocktail party where your client killed Sadie.<eos> Did you see my client kill her?<eos> No.<eos> No, I did not.
Oh, sorry.<eos> This is the right hand.<eos> Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth,<eos> - and nothing but the truth?<eos> - I do.
Tell me something I don't know, like who did.<eos> No idea.<eos> Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth,<eos> - and nothing but the truth?<eos> - I do.
That's the company Felix used to find his bio sister.<eos> I don't know.<eos> Is it? They're owned by Brightborn?<eos> I knew there was something about Adele.<eos> No, no, you don't.
Hello.<eos> Real sister, how?<eos> We have the same father.<eos> I thought you didn't have a father.<eos> Well, I didn't, but now I do.
It's a safe house, Fee.<eos> You're paranoid.<eos> The two of you, you're bloody paranoid.<eos> Kira's here. We have a right to be suspicious of Adele.<eos> No! No, you don't, okay?
I ain't ever gonna kneel.<eos> Yeah, I said that, too.<eos> Yeah, I know.<eos> See that's the thing, man.<eos> You don't.
I love her.<eos> She's my daughter.<eos> But she isn't mine.<eos> I had to accept that.<eos> I did.
Come in.<eos> I'm sorry to interrupt, sir, but, uh...<eos> You left Lucille out by the truck.<eos> Seriously?<eos> I never do that.
You had to.<eos> That's not what happened.<eos> Whatever helps you sleep at night.<eos> How do you sleep at night?<eos> I don't.
Or even my person, really.<eos> Well, just remember. If you get in, that's great, but if you don't get in, that's fine, too.<eos> Angelina Jolie was never in a sorority, and she married Brad Pitt.<eos> Not that marriage is the answer if don't get into a sorority.<eos> Or even if you do.
I'm in a situation.<eos> We had sex last night.<eos> It was an accident.<eos> Is it gonna happen again?<eos> It already did.
No one else makes them right.<eos> I'm sorry, Ally.<eos> I mean, Miss...<eos> You know my husband's on the board of this club.<eos> - Of course I do.
You found her?<eos> Did you find Daisy, too?<eos> Her real name is Sheila.<eos> Sheila Woods.<eos> And, yes, we did.
How many of them live near a grocery store?<eos> Define near.<eos> Uh, within a mile.<eos> Well, there are 163 grocery stores in the greater St. Louis area.<eos> Two of them do.
And who wants to be impotent?<eos> You're late.<eos> You knew I was at dinner with my father.<eos> I don't like waiting.<eos> Then don't.
Okay.<eos> You have it?<eos> Do I have... ?<eos> My schedule.<eos> Oh, sir, I-I do, but, uh...
You're working.<eos> You seem good.<eos> What?<eos> You thought you'd find me drunk, playing Russian roulette with the nuclear codes?<eos> You did.
I'm not the obvious choice, then.<eos> You and I both know that's not true.<eos> You don't talk to her?<eos> No.<eos> I don't.
No.<eos> I don't.<eos> You?<eos> No...<eos> I don't.
I can re-create the circumstances to get you your speed back.<eos> Let's set up the particle accelerator.<eos> Barry... he's gone.<eos> This wasn't su...<eos> I didn't...
- literally.<eos> - No, I don't.<eos> And how can you stand there in judgment and accuse me of rejecting my gift?<eos> Do you have any idea how much I've done since I was first struck by lightning, how many people I've helped with the power that you gave me... what I've sacrificed?<eos> Of course we do.
Izzy was my partner and my friend. Why would I kill him?<eos> He wanted to make some real music, and that meant ending your partnership.<eos> You got pissed, went to Amiel. He could relate.<eos> Izzy was suing Amiel, wanted out of his contract.<eos> Then you two did something childish.
- My son is a hero!<eos> You hear me?<eos> He's a hero! You really mean that, Dad?<eos> You think I'm a hero?<eos> Of course I do.
And I'm not gonna wait anymore.<eos> And for what it's worth, I always liked the horse from Horsin' Around.<eos> - You did?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Everybody did.
- Hey, keep your goddamn hands...<eos> Don't... don't... don't hurt him.<eos> I'm going to give you to the count of five to tell me where the key to the boat is. - One.<eos> - He doesn't have it.<eos> Who does? Two.
- You'll see them soon.<eos> Your time here is done.<eos> Chris can't see this.<eos> Think I'm actually starting to get used to this.<eos> Please don't.
Okay, stop.<eos> That's close enough.<eos> Good luck.<eos> How do you say "asshole" in Spanish?<eos> You don't.
- Let me by, Chris. Whatever you think you saw, it's wrong, Alicia. I froze.<eos> That's it. That's all that happened, okay? - Chris, let me go.<eos> - You have to believe me.<eos> You can't say anything.<eos> What if I do?
Nick.<eos> - He's just--<eos> - I'm not the boy's daddy.<eos> I just thought that- - I don't know what's happening to him.<eos> Yes, you do.
She really needs you.<eos> She's hurting.<eos> - Come on.<eos> You found him.<eos> No, I didn't.
Dude, it's not like that at all.<eos> It's just this house has, like, nine bedrooms.<eos> You have any idea how scary that gets at night?<eos> So I just wanted to have some roommates around, but, um, you know, I felt weird charging them rent, cause, you know.<eos> No, I don't.
- Thank you.<eos> Finally.<eos> - From the logo.<eos> BoJack, you didn't kill Nadia.<eos> BoJack did.
You control every part of my life, I don't know anything about you.<eos> [scoffs] -You don't want to know me, BoJack.<eos> -No, I do.<eos> -I want to be known and know others.<eos> -You don't.
The San Diego Union-Tribune called me, "A talent to watch."<eos> I knew I had to get out of there.<eos> And you've been living here ever since?<eos> That's right.<eos> I also did an arc on The Good Wife.
"Who threw my cocaine in the champagne fountain?"<eos> - So standard rich people stuff?<eos> - I guess.<eos> - How come you never told me that?<eos> - I did.
- What happened?<eos> What exactly is she saying happened?<eos> We just want to hear your son's side.<eos> His side?<eos> He didn't do anything wrong.
I have only one question.<eos> Paul Lefebvre isn't his real name.<eos> I figured as much.<eos> Did he ever tell you his real name?<eos> No, he never did.
No, seriously.<eos> What is there to talk about?<eos> Will you at least give me a chance to explain a few things?<eos> - I told you I was married.<eos> - You did.
Anything!<eos> Fuggedaboutit!<eos> And scene!<eos> I said "fear of public speaking."<eos> Yes, you did. Very nice.
Sit back, relax.<eos> You planning on taking some research satellites?<eos> You're trying to eat dessert when they just served salad.<eos> Don't you know how to romance someone?<eos> No, he does not.
It was when Arnold died, when I suffered, that I... began to understand what he had found.<eos> To realize I was wrong.<eos> But you kept us here in this hell.<eos> Bernard, I told you, Arnold didn't know how to save you.<eos> I do.
Thank you.<eos> Thank you you all very much.<eos> Thank you.<eos> He looks just like his father.<eos> He really does.
I get stoned super easy these days.<eos> Have you noticed?<eos> I keep replaying what happened at that bar.<eos> I pleasured myself at my desk, thinking of you.<eos> You didn't?
Everything's as it was, status quo?<eos> Same old, same old, huh?<eos> Nothing new in your life, nothing exciting, nothing, well, unique or exotic?<eos> You know that I know you know, right?<eos> - I do now, okay. - Okay.
Take a breath.<eos> Breathe.<eos> I am trying, Em, but I need this.<eos> - I want to be Dean of this place... of Hamilton.<eos> - Of course you do.
I mean, but that's what Jack does, right?<eos> - He... he panics.<eos> - Let me guess.<eos> Something to do with the 20-something you've invited into your marriage and the power-hungry neighbor recently appointed to a governing body that will determine your husband's professional fate?<eos> - How do you do that?
See? Look at this.<eos> That's the one.<eos> You just want to have sex with it.<eos> I do.<eos> I do!
Omar Velez was a dead end, but if we can figure out who wanted her dead, we'll have our bomber.<eos> Precisely.<eos> Okay, so who was she?<eos> I have no idea.<eos> No one does.
Janet Heffernan.<eos> Someone killed her?<eos> A few days ago.<eos> Did you know her well?<eos> No, none of us did.
Jesse?<eos> You know about him?<eos> What he is?<eos> Jesus. That's right.<eos> You did.
I promise, Daddy.<eos> You stop that.<eos> We Custers don't cry.<eos> We fight.<eos> I did this, Daddy!
All in the name of justice.<eos> Preacher, you're gonna wish you was in hell.<eos> I'm sorry, sheriff.<eos> I'll see you Sunday.<eos> How did he...
I'm sorry, we're just gonna, like, drive around, shooting people, getting wasted, and looking for God?<eos> Oh, I'm so in!<eos> And what are you gonna do when you find him?<eos> Well... God wants our help, we'll help him.<eos> If he doesn't...
We're above that.<eos> Yeah. Try being here.<eos> - Okay.<eos> I know.<eos> - No, you don't.
Why would they do that?<eos> Weaponizing alien abilities for military purposes.<eos> What do they do to humans?<eos> Does Clark know where it is?<eos> No. No one does.
I never could have gotten through today without your help and support.<eos> Nope. It was all you.<eos> [Chuckles] Ohh.<eos> You got my 20 bucks?<eos> Yes, we do, Thelma.
The only thing this coffee needs to be is not vodka.<eos> You do know you two aren't fooling anyone, right?<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> Mom, everyone knows you and Steve are dating.<eos> - No, they don't.
You do know you two aren't fooling anyone, right?<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> Mom, everyone knows you and Steve are dating.<eos> - No, they don't.<eos> - JODI: Yeah, they do.
What?<eos> It just happened.<eos> One thing led to another.<eos> You know how it is.<eos> No, I don't.
No, it is not about you.<eos> It's just how I want to live my life now, that's it.<eos> Just unafraid.<eos> Kirsten, you know how I feel about you.<eos> You do.
I'll make up two rooms, then.<eos> The fever is infectious.<eos> Reckon she caught it from the Partridge lad.<eos> She needs a doctor.<eos> They both do.
Says who?<eos> Me.<eos> I thought you hated that place.<eos> I do.<eos> We all do.
Everywhere I looked, there were fins.<eos> And teeth.<eos> And blood.<eos> I knew if they saw me, I'd be next, so I just floated there, waiting, praying they'd swim on.<eos> But they didn't.
I really need...<eos> Stop.<eos> Okay, just stop.<eos> You had him at "hello."<eos> First of all, she didn't.
You did the right thing.<eos> At least you didn't kill her.<eos> She's lucky you aren't a better shot.<eos> How did she know about the Stitchers program?<eos> She didn't.
You can just give me the jacket back when you guys get home, okay?<eos> - Let's get out of here. - Josh.<eos> Gabi, look, I didn't mean to ruin your...<eos> You're not too late.<eos> - But didn't you and Jake...
I made pancakes.<eos> Morning.<eos> Good morning.<eos> You know, I really do love you, Becca.<eos> Of course you do.
She never told me any of this.<eos> Why?<eos> Because she didn't want to hurt you.<eos> Because someone did love you.<eos> Someone still does.
Yeah, I guess if it's for you, it's a love poem.<eos> It's kind of inspired by our, uh, Ohio Blue Tip Matches.<eos> Really?<eos> Does it mention the little megaphone shape the letters make?<eos> Y-Yeah. Actually, it does.
- Sam!<eos> What happened to me?<eos> The Witness took control of you.<eos> I don't love you!<eos> You did once.
Then what are we still doing here?<eos> For what?<eos> Why continue this?<eos> You know why.<eos> No. I don't.
Where are we going?<eos> This is it. 1957.<eos> My God, there's a woman here with a gun!<eos> How did you know?<eos> I didn't.
This is it. 1957.<eos> My God, there's a woman here with a gun!<eos> How did you know?<eos> I didn't.<eos> Then I did.
- Can't you delay it? - No, I can't.<eos> Besides, you have already stated your ability to run the ship without me for some time.<eos> In jest, my dear boy, when you become mutinous and presumptuous.<eos> You know how much I depend on you.<eos> - I do.
Uh, my cellmate got a little frisky with me, and I had to clock her with a Bible.<eos> So why didn't they call you "The Bible"?<eos> It was already taken.<eos> Okay, next question.<eos> At the Rolling Stones concert at Altamont, how many Hells Angels did... ?
She could sense that something was off.<eos> You know, the late hours, no family ever around.<eos> Elizabeth wanted to tell her who we were, and I didn't.<eos> We fought about it for months.<eos> And then we did.
The President wanted to see me.<eos> Come this way.<eos> Take a seat.<eos> I caught your interview with Sally.<eos> You did?
It's Sunday-night dinner.<eos> Can I come in?<eos> Um, this is a surprise.<eos> You keep saying that you don't want to eat at the house.<eos> Well, tonight, I do.
So given that Steve and Danny traveled all this way, I've agreed to sign off on their therapy hours once they've completed the course.<eos> I should also tell you that I've spoken with Steve and Danny about their partnership, and it is fraught with some very serious problems.<eos> So I think it would be both cruel and irresponsible for us to abandon them in this time of crisis.<eos> Really?<eos> I don't.
Danny, you haven't exactly been participating.<eos> What's your take on all this?<eos> Uh, my take on, uh, this is, um-- sorry-- it's stupid, and I'd like to just go take a nap if that's okay.<eos> So you don't see the value in anything we do here?<eos> I-I don't.
I know that too.<eos> So, I don't want to give anyone the wrong impression.<eos> It amazes me how dumb a doctor can be.<eos> Everybody knows you like Natalie.<eos> They do?
- No.<eos> But he was scheduled, right?<eos> Monday, Wednesdays, and Fridays, yeah.<eos> You have any idea where I can find him?<eos> I don't.
But right now, I need both of you to answer a few questions.<eos> Unh-unh. N... not without a lawyer.<eos> Mrs. Bah, your son has been radicalized by some very bad people.<eos> You should be thanking us we got to him before he carried out their instructions.<eos> Don't, Ma.
She asked me not to say anything to you.<eos> I tried to change her mind.<eos> She doesn't want to see me?<eos> She doesn't mean that.<eos> Yes, she does.
That's some consultant from Major Cases.<eos> He just showed up.<eos> Said he heard about it on his scanner.<eos> You made him sit in a corner?<eos> No, he did that himself.
We underestimated the hold the imposter has over them.<eos> If they won't help prove she's a fraud, we'll just see if she killed Bob Underhill instead.<eos> Yesterday you said you had to accompany your mother to a doctor's appointment in Scarsdale.<eos> That's right.<eos> Only you didn't.
I had to make sure you weren't trying to cheat me.<eos> I told you not to use it.<eos> This could ruin everything.<eos> - I think I know what I'm doing.<eos> - No, you don't.
What'd I do?<eos> 'Cause I don't remember doing anything bad.<eos> You shoot these photos?<eos> Ah, Summer Blake.<eos> Yeah, I did.
There, there.<eos> Are you hungry?<eos> Yes, you are.<eos> Your mummy knows exactly what you need, doesn't she?<eos> Yes, she does.
We don't need to tell you where we're coming from.<eos> A concert.<eos> This isn't right.<eos> Step out of the car.<eos> Please, sir, we really didn't do anything.
You know, I treat a hundred patients a day, every day.<eos> No, I don't remember him.<eos> Did you see Mr. Heshman when Dr. Pineda was treating him the night she was attacked?<eos> No.<eos> I did.
Or you could break it off.<eos> Those are your options.<eos> She's already gone through this with the police.<eos> Do we really need to... ? Yes.<eos> We do.
Justina's a foster kid?<eos> Justina is Lizzie.<eos> The friend that she told me about was her.<eos> Thanks a lot for telling Zoey that I cheated on you.<eos> I didn't.
It must be if you're having slumber parties.<eos> His buddy dropped him off here.<eos> Evan tied one on, and he's crashing here, so that he doesn't have to face Mom until he's sobered up.<eos> And you know he's allergic to pet dander, so...<eos> -Oh, I didn't, actually.
You wanna go?<eos> I will kick you right back to the trailer park where you used to make out with your uncle.<eos> You need to come to daddy.<eos> No.<eos> No, she doesn't.
A one-timer.<eos> I date CEOs, not gangsters.<eos> The night Cassidy bit it, she came back from her break screaming about how she just caught Nick banging some other chick, and that she was gonna send his ass to jail.<eos> Did anyone else see Nick here that night?<eos> We all did.
Uhh! I was buying food for dinner.<eos> For who?<eos> Savannah.<eos> Do you love her?<eos> Yes, I--I do.
No.<eos> I really thought we were gonna<eos> - go on to New Hampshire.<eos> - I know.<eos> Peter did, too.
Over metro D.C. in less than 30.<eos> Damn.<eos> Hell of a day to quit smoking.<eos> Didn't know you smoked, ma'am.<eos> I don't.
Not going anywhere.<eos> Your life is in danger.<eos> Not the first time.<eos> - You don't understand.<eos> - But I do.
- I don't know, Julia.<eos> I mean, what do you want me to say? "I give up"?<eos> "Forget about ever really fixing anything"?<eos> No, we keep trying, okay?<eos> At least I do.
So, when we drove over it, my dad lost total control of the wheel.<eos> And we ended up upside down in a ravine.<eos> When we got to the hospital, I sat there for probably two, three hours.<eos> I was waiting for one of those Disney movie fantasies to come to life, where he woke up.<eos> But he never did.
Flag on the play.<eos> Like an idiot, Stefan didn't renew the minutes on his cell phone. We'll call you when we connect.<eos> Come on, Bon. I want to beat traffic.<eos> You know where he is.<eos> Yeah, I do, Enzo.
Well, well, well, Mr. Frink.<eos> Have you reconsidered? Reconsidered?<eos> Yeah, my offer to place some more authentic Americana with my Japanese clientele.<eos> Listen, you got a problem.<eos> We both do.
It's all we have right now.<eos> Okay. Let's do this.<eos> So much for surprising him.<eos> Oh, we'll think of something else.<eos> We always do.
What if...?<eos> What if I could burn our names off the gravestones that Hades made for us, the ones holding us here?<eos> I looked for a spell like that.<eos> It doesn't exist.<eos> Actually, it does.
Why do you defend Rumplestiltskin?<eos> He kidnapped you.<eos> He made you a servant.<eos> You should want him dead, too.<eos> Yeah, well, I don't.
Did the doctor say I can shower yet?<eos> I can't imagine how hard this is... but we need you to hold on just a little bit longer.<eos> Carolyn, I just want to make sure you know that none of this is your fault, okay?<eos> You guys have a brave little girl here.<eos> Yes, we do.
This is your win, too.<eos> Come with us.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Okay, well, I... I do love me a mojito.<eos> Duh, who doesn't?
How are you doing?<eos> - Great! - Great.<eos> - Great.<eos> Hi, I'm Kelly. - Kristen.<eos> - Oh, did I not...?
No, this is different.<eos> - What do you make of this?<eos> - It's wool, English.<eos> The man you're looking for has money.<eos> But he didn't always.
You know, the story we tell everybody and obnoxiously post on Facebook every year on our anniversary.<eos> But now we can't, because it's ruined!<eos> - Oh, my God.<eos> Did you hear that?<eos> - Yes, I did.
Mm.<eos> And again.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Well, I have that effect on women.<eos> Yes, you do. (Chuckles)
I froze. I'm...<eos> I'm... I'm... I'm not good in high-stress situations.<eos> - It's just a phone call!<eos> - I know.<eos> But I didn't.
These are just bones, yeah?<eos> You couldn't find DNA on any of them, so I will guess that they came from working girls.<eos> Guess?<eos> You told SVU some of these victims might have been from Chicago.<eos> Did I?
- She does.<eos> - She doesn't.<eos> Mmm. She does.<eos> She doesn't.<eos> - She does.
Mmm. She does.<eos> She doesn't.<eos> - She does.<eos> - I don't have time to do this.<eos> She doesn't.
She doesn't.<eos> - She does.<eos> - I don't have time to do this.<eos> She doesn't.<eos> She doesn't.
There's, uh, hard costs, operating expenses...<eos> Hard costs?<eos> Like what, specifically?<eos> I understand your frustration.<eos> Sincerely, I do.
So... Hunting vampires is your identity.<eos> Your fundamental "this is who I am..."<eos> In a nutshell.<eos> You ever wonder if there's a way to change that?<eos> No, I don't.
And maybe that will kill her and Stefan too.<eos> If I do nothing, she'll kill Damon.<eos> You're willing to kill for him?<eos> Do you really think he cares that much about you?<eos> Yeah. I do.
Yeah. Check out the trunk.<eos> Well, that's not department issue.<eos> That blood on the barrel...<eos> We know whose it is?<eos> No, sir. We don't.
We're going through those channels to set up another interview.<eos> You got nothing to connect him to the other guys?<eos> Not yet.<eos> But you like him.<eos> - We do. - Hmm.
Well, now I know why you're not getting enough sleep.<eos> And that's not all.<eos> Eve told me that the Captain is knowingly working with Black Claw.<eos> He knew Dix was gonna be shot?<eos> If he didn't then, he does now.
Nothing's changed.<eos> Nothing has happened.<eos> You think I'm being stupid?<eos> No.<eos> I don't.
There's been talk about blackmailing you.<eos> I don't want you on my conscience, too.<eos> This is the last time we're gonna see each other.<eos> Got a cigarette?<eos> No, we don't.
Calling me "Cutie", morning drinking,<eos> Everything's back to normal.<eos> We just have to frake it for one more day.<eos> But I really want to see you tonight. I know.<eos> I do too.
What happened? Another rescue by Hondo Ohnaka!<eos> Thanks, Hondo!<eos> We owe you one.<eos> No.<eos> We don't.
Bye.<eos> Did you call Jane Fellows?<eos> I did.<eos> I support your decision.<eos> No, you don't.
I know someone is watching me.<eos> I can tell.<eos> On the train, at work, in my apartment.<eos> How do you know?<eos> I just do.
Maybe it wasn't such a good idea.<eos> - Do you know what time it is?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Time for you to tell me how Curtis died.<eos> He.. he just did!
I need to finish what I started. With Evil Corp.<eos> But I don't know what to do.<eos> Why did you first start listening to me?<eos> When I sent you that note on the server at Evil Corp, something inside you told you to listen.<eos> And you did.
She should be with our boy.<eos> She should be going.<eos> She missed this time with Emma, and now it's happening all over again.<eos> We shouldn't be here.<eos> I didn't...
That doesn't sound like a very convincing battle cry.<eos> Ruby, what's going on?<eos> When we were on our trek, Dorothy asked me what I've been looking for this whole time.<eos> And I told her that didn't know.<eos> Well, do you?
You left without saying anything.<eos> I was afraid.<eos> I couldn't lose you to Zelena.<eos> Well, yeah, but I almost lost you.<eos> You didn't.
Take it.<eos> - Hey, I said you're not going! - Aah!<eos> Forgot to mention...<eos> I hate bullies.<eos> He really does.
- We can't what?<eos> Tell Moms.<eos> - Why not?<eos> - Because you know why.<eos> No, I don't.
People today are too obsessed with their phones.<eos> I don't like it-<eos> - I come out here to connect with nature.<eos> Unplug. You feel me?<eos> Yeah, I do, uh...
If you don't believe me, ask Melissa or the waiter.<eos> Or any of the 75 other people that were there.<eos> You got to believe me.<eos> Relax.<eos> I do.
Or any of the 75 other people that were there.<eos> You got to believe me.<eos> Relax.<eos> I do.<eos> You do?
I knew.<eos> I know what you're thinking -- jealous wife kills her cheating husband.<eos> But that couldn't be further from the truth.<eos> I loved Dan.<eos> I still do.
I guess.<eos> Wait a second.<eos> You didn't kiss Staci.<eos> No, of course not.<eos> No, but Dan did.
Enough.<eos> I know we made an amazing and dynamic team.<eos> But that doesn't change the fact that you lied just to get my sympathy.<eos> Well, that is right.<eos> I-I did.
The flash drive you traded for Mateo.<eos> Who did you give it to?<eos> I gave it to Rose.<eos> No, she doesn't have it.<eos> Who does?
Nellie's mother is downstairs.<eos> - Susan Baldwin. - Okay.<eos> You and Halstead, as soon as she's seen Nellie, go interview her.<eos> Run his name through DCFS.<eos> Do a national check, too.
Why should us carry-on folk have to foot the bill for those morons who don't know how to pack?<eos> Three weeks, I went from Edinburgh to Warsaw on two pairs of pants and a tam-o'-shanter.<eos> I'm falling asleep.<eos> - I love naps!<eos> - Who doesn't?
Might be a fuse.<eos> (cellphone rings)<eos> Mitchell, we have a problem.<eos> MITCHELL:<eos> No, we don't.
All she wanted.<eos> Needed, really.<eos> You think she knows we got him?<eos> I believe she does.<eos> They both do.
Okay, well... apology accepted.<eos> Wh... uh... Wait, I mean, let's, uh, let's at least have a drink.<eos> You know, I really wanna make this up to you.<eos> Sure, if that makes you feel better.<eos> It does.
Wh... uh... Wait, I mean, let's, uh, let's at least have a drink.<eos> You know, I really wanna make this up to you.<eos> Sure, if that makes you feel better.<eos> It does.<eos> It really does.
Yes. Do you have any way of reaching her?<eos> My understanding is she's not scheduled to check in with her handler until the end of the week.<eos> Of course, the fear is that by then it might be too late.<eos> Commander? Do you have a direct line to Lieutenant Rollins?<eos> No. No, I don't.
I adore gas station television,<eos> I mean, myself, personally.<eos> It is the intersection between information and also gas.<eos> That's right. Cece, today it's gas, tomorrow, it's local news... the next thing you know, you're reporting diabetes statistics as we all watch B-roll of fat people walking across the street.<eos> I just, I don't...
It's nice to get a good laugh in this heat.<eos> I need a laugh.<eos> It's too hot not to laugh.<eos> Lord knows it!<eos> You do.
Almost audition time.<eos> - Hey, Cece.<eos> - Huh? You know that thing you said before about you not being talented enough?<eos> You didn't mean that, right?<eos> Yeah, I did.
Fly in the Amazon.<eos> What the crap does that mean?<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> Sorry, sorry, sorry.<eos> You don't...
Hey. How you doing, buddy?<eos> Fine. I fell.<eos> This is all probably overkill.<eos> Did you see the incident, sir?<eos> - No, I didn't.
Look at you.<eos> When is the last time you held her hand like that?<eos> You love her.<eos> Maybe you forgot that.<eos> I do.
And you don't.<eos> You don't have mosques in the Financial District.<eos> No, but Thornton and Kellen certainly have informants in mosques.<eos> You didn't share these doubts with them.<eos> No, I didn't.
Yeah, about that.<eos> There you are.<eos> Hey, check out the sky.<eos> The bartender has a theory.<eos> Of course he does.
It's my fault.<eos> No, this is all on me.<eos> I tried to have it all.<eos> Next time, it'll be different.<eos> Nora, don't!
Sorry, what did you say your names were?<eos> You ask anyone at 1PP, Hank Abraham was a political appointee.<eos> He was never one of us.<eos> No one's losing any sleep over him.<eos> Well, we all did.
- Ah. - Unless Peter told her.<eos> Campaign managers push their candidates to admit all before signing on.<eos> So, Ruth... might... have... known.<eos> Aha. So, the question is,<eos> - did she?
That's good news.<eos> Kelly... they call that kind of blockage a "widow-maker."<eos> If they hadn't found it,<eos> Eddie could've been dead within a week.<eos> They did.
- Yes, and that's the problem.<eos> He left prison with a price on his head.<eos> A man promised to kill him if he didn't pay back $50,000 he took.<eos> - And he came to you.<eos> - Of course he did.
I have something to say!<eos> Why come to a little place like Jodie when there's plenty of teaching jobs in Dallas?<eos> I didn't really take to the city.<eos> Call me Deke.<eos> All my faculty does.
Have a drink.<eos> It's a party.<eos> Do you... you realize how badly you're messing things up right now?<eos> How do you know I'm not making them better?<eos> You don't.
It's okay, I'm your brother.<eos> So what if this move is too much, too soon.<eos> Too much, too soon?<eos> Who said that?<eos> Well, you just did, for one.
- I just don't- I don't know why you left a big pile of rags right there.<eos> - Uh, I had to close, and yeah, so there's a pile of rags that I left, and I'll clean it up before we open.<eos> How's this a mystery?<eos> - Pete, the place is always perfect every time you close, so I thought you must have a reason.<eos> - So, I didn't.
Yeah, real bad.<eos> - I know.<eos> - No, no, you don't know.<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> - You don't.
Sorry. Look, I think Derek's telling the truth.<eos> I don't think he knew.<eos> Wait. What are you talking about?<eos> You can't know that already.<eos> Well, I do.
It had its ups and downs.<eos> Got to meet a few nice people along the way.<eos> Yeah. Plus, we got to travel the world.<eos> Do you remember our train ride to Austria?<eos> Oh, yes, I do.
Remember, you're just watching.<eos> You can get up and leave anytime you like.<eos> I'm right here, Norman.<eos> I thought you didn't want to be seen with me.<eos> I don't.
I thought you didn't want to be seen with me.<eos> I don't.<eos> Pick it up.<eos> How much money do you want?<eos> I don't...
She squashed you like a bug 11 years ago, and she never looked back.<eos> She doesn't think about you.<eos> She doesn't visit you.<eos> She doesn't care about you.<eos> Yes, she does.
Just because you pull out doesn't mean that you weren't- that you were never there.<eos> - Boy, you really have a skill at justifying horrible things.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - I don't know what to do.<eos> - No, you don't.
That's why his lungs are soaked.<eos> Prepping now.<eos> I got a 14 and a 16 standing by.<eos> The LVAD battery.<eos> He did this to himself.
After everything he's done to you?<eos> I know nothing.<eos> Nothing. Nothing!<eos> That look like a hull number to you?<eos> Yes, it does.
Don't put that song on and disappear into Rory's room. Hey!<eos> At least turn it down!<eos> -Did my boxes get here? -Behind the rack.<eos> Great!<eos> So, you finally did it, huh?
Was so out of context.<eos> So, who's up for being on the advisory committee?<eos> -Me.<eos> -Me, too.<eos> -I'll do it.
- Great. - Yeah, you know what?<eos> I've actually been getting referrals for patients all by myself for years now.<eos> Patient's presenting with severe pelvic pain and night sweats.<eos> Yeah, yeah, yeah, you're chief of surgery, but I think I still control what patients I take on.<eos> Well, of course you do, Alex.
It's just fascinating.<eos> We had a pair of conjoined twins born in Cleveland Clinic.<eos> I was part of the team that worked on them for 20 hours.<eos> They nearly didn't survive.<eos> They... they rarely do.
Well, then let me put it another way.<eos> Is there a chance that she could live?<eos> Of course.<eos> But you need to believe that you can.<eos> I do.
So... how do you jump from that to "Want to grab a drink sometime?"<eos> I'm the last guy you want to take advice on women from.<eos> So what now?<eos> She had a case for self-defense.<eos> She still does.
You got to admit there are a lot of unanswered questions.<eos> We need to check Kayla out.<eos> That's just what we do.<eos> We need to look into her personal computer.<eos> No, we don't.
And so why are we here? We should go back home where Alexei can't hurt anyone, where it's safe.<eos> We give Elena time.<eos> We let her absorb what I've told her, okay?<eos> We don't have time.<eos> Alexei doesn't.
Well, yeah, it's easy to say that now because you know who Joy turned out to be.<eos> But 30 years ago, would you have really put your career on hold for diapers and teething and all-night crying fits?<eos> Look, Hayden had to make a call, and maybe it was the wrong call, but don't pretend like you don't understand why she made it.<eos> You know I say this out of love, right?<eos> Yeah. I do.
Sure, we could do that.<eos> Or we could just pretend you never found this.<eos> Fine.<eos> But my dad wants to know what happened during his missing time.<eos> Of course he does.
No one knows what they're about.<eos> So an all-women firm.<eos> Does anybody want an all-women firm?<eos> An all-women partner firm.<eos> Some people do.
I don't want to lose you, Dr. Edwards.<eos> I don't want to leave here and have you not care about me.<eos> But don't you think that it's possible that I might make even more progress if I'm near the person who makes me feel complete and whole and safe?<eos> With you, and with her, I really think that I can get better. I...<eos> I really, really do.
Is that what you said?<eos> I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> You said... you... Did you say you were a unicorn?<eos> I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> You did!
I know what you did, Bill, and I know why you did it.<eos> Finally we are back where we belong, together.<eos> I should have called first. I know.<eos> Did I leave something at the office?<eos> Did you...?
77, huh?<eos> That's how many outlaws we'll have to put down?<eos> - Yeah, give or take a 7.<eos> - So what about your dad?<eos> - How many revenants did he...?
We didn't trust each other and now look what I done!<eos> Put down the knife!<eos> The heir's gonna help us!<eos> I do know the numbers.<eos> 'Least, I did!
I didn't get it.<eos> And I didn't understand what I had done.<eos> Why you pulled away.<eos> Well, I-I was waiting for you to say... uh, something.<eos> And when you... when you didn't...
Why shouldn't our names stand on their own?<eos> Especially if we are doing most of the work?<eos> Come on, Art. You-you studied at Kinsey.<eos> You know more about homosexuality than either of them do.<eos> Why not do the study at our own clinic?
I'm the one who made the mistake of coming to you, thinking that my marriage could change, that things could be different.<eos> They still can.<eos> I know what my marriage is, 'cause I made it that way.<eos> Maybe if he had the keys that night... but he didn't.<eos> I did.
It's far from it.<eos> I have made many mistakes, but that doesn't mean there isn't love in it.<eos> I love you... and Jenny and Howie.<eos> And I did love your mother.<eos> I still do.
"This is not what we do, Jenny"!<eos> It's not.<eos> You screwed this up.<eos> She needed to know all the risks.<eos> - No, she didn't.
This wasn't my fault.<eos> Telling the mother.<eos> Stress doesn't just cause arteries to rupture.<eos> - You know that.<eos> - I do.
We'll figure this out.<eos> This isn't your fault, you know.<eos> Maybe my face just doesn't like forehead flaps.<eos> Hey. You will figure this out.<eos> You always do.
Come on, Mom!<eos> Ma'am, I do need to advise you against this.<eos> Advice taken.<eos> Do you have a tray?<eos> No, ma'am, I don't.
Advice taken.<eos> Do you have a tray?<eos> No, ma'am, I don't.<eos> You're gonna have a hard time keeping up.<eos> Ma'am, I really don't...
We just shared a connection.<eos> We just dropped bedrock.<eos> Okay, we just laid a foundation for our house that is our partnership.<eos> And Captain Cole approve of this?<eos> She did. She definitely did.
I need more practice.<eos> That's Dad's job.<eos> It was worth a shot.<eos> Got a cigarette?<eos> No, we don't.
This.<eos> God! "Sommersby."<eos> You... where did you even get this?<eos> You don't want to know.<eos> Oh, no, I don't.
No! It'll get all over my cave.<eos> What if we feed him to the reptile!<eos> Get that horny toad!<eos> Look, I appreciate your ideas, but Sid didn't take your eggs!<eos> Then who did?
They'd get down there soon enough.<eos> I found these in Justin's drawer.<eos> Two tickets to Florida for next month.<eos> She thought she had time.<eos> We all do.
It wasn't a bomb.<eos> Gas leak.<eos> My wife, Hank Wesley, all those good people hurt because of a rusty valve.<eos> This doesn't make sense, does it?<eos> No, it doesn't.
I didn't sign it yet.<eos> I hear what you're saying, but I've known Emily a long time, and I think she deserves the benefit of the doubt.<eos> All right, it's your life.<eos> But you know how this is gonna end.<eos> As a matter of fact, I do.
I told you not to call him.<eos> Well, I did.<eos> Because he's a partner, and like he just said, he was the one who wanted to sever the noncompetes in the first place.<eos> You're right, Louis.<eos> I did.
And if you so much as picture her in a school-girl outfit.<eos> Come on, Louis, we're all feeling good.<eos> You telling me you never slipped up and had an inappropriate relationship?<eos> Louis, I do not want to know the answer to that.<eos> I did.
Okay. Or I can give you a hard copy at dinner next week.<eos> Next week?<eos> Yeah, we get together every Thursday to go over lesson plans and activities.<eos> You're gonna love it.<eos> We all do.
We don't have time!<eos> That's the problem.<eos> Okay. So what's the first thing you would do?<eos> I don't know!<eos> Yes, you do.
- But I alre... - Oh, tch, tch, tch!<eos> Don't worry, Mrs. Heck.<eos> Think of this like "Downton Abbey" and I'm one of the basement people.<eos> You won't have to do a thing.<eos> And I didn't.
So, uh... I made it clear I'm dating, right?<eos> Or should I give myself a hickey with the vacuum cleaner?<eos> Gabi said you needed me?<eos> Remember how you told me not to go back to my therapist?<eos> - I did. - And?
Oh, my damn!<eos> Oh! Oh, my damn! Oh, my damn!<eos> Yay! We're having a baby!<eos> - You have my blessing.<eos> Yes. - We do?
Look at all those parents whose kids disappeared.<eos> They spend years in court trying to clear their name.<eos> How did you know Courtney's neck was snapped?<eos> Well, you told me.<eos> No, I didn't.
- She knows.<eos> - Knows?<eos> April knows.<eos> - What?<eos> - Doesn't she?
That I went on a date.<eos> So, April knows, huh?<eos> Uh, that you're seeing other people.<eos> - Does April know? - No!<eos> N... She doesn't.
I was coming to tell you...<eos> When did you know?<eos> Did you know before the divorce?<eos> Did you know before we signed those papers?<eos> Yes, I did.
No idea, sir.<eos> Too long!<eos> Her plane lands any minute.<eos> Yeah, I'm sure that trip's a complete coincidence, right?<eos> Nothing to do with me or... her or...
Now that we've stabilized the heart, we will administer esmolol to slow the heart rate for better control.<eos> Right, now go ahead and incise the diseased artery.<eos> I don't...<eos> I don't want to do this.<eos> I don't...
Sam, what song will you sing?<eos> No, I'm sorry.<eos> I'm working, sir.<eos> Do you like Broadway show tunes?<eos> Of course, who doesn't?
I have a plan.<eos> What the hell did you guys do back there?<eos> The whole place is lit up.<eos> Did you get the scepter?<eos> We did.
Why is that?<eos> I don't know.<eos> You're a bad person.<eos> I don't want you to feel like you're doing wrong when you're with me.<eos> Yeah, you do.
What's down there?<eos> Uh... just an old bunker...<eos> I want to see it.<eos> I don't have any keys.<eos> We do.
That's weird, Mom.<eos> Isn't that weird?<eos> I'm not getting involved.<eos> He was a little... unstable at the time, and I was afraid he might regret his decision.<eos> Did he?
Aria, I called you last night after you went to Ezra's. Yeah.<eos> I'm sorry I didn't get back to you.<eos> Well, is everything okay?<eos> Did he find out about the Nicole call?<eos> No, he didn't.
And then suddenly, there you are.<eos> You were all smart and preppy and ready to hatch an escape plan.<eos> I really wish I could have been there, Hanna.<eos> I wish that I could have helped you.<eos> You did.
It wouldn't make you any less of a father if you just...<eos> I just wish I got to know my real mom before...<eos> Okay.<eos> You really think it's good for Emma?<eos> I do.
The crux of your dispute is your contention that Lucifer, and only Lucifer, can use the Horn to beat Amara, right?<eos> You got it.<eos> Well, that scenario only works if you actually possess said Horn, which you do not.<eos> No, we don't. But you do, so --<eos> Exactly! I do!

Mr. Church just became our top priority.<eos> "Our" is not going to be enough for this guy.<eos> Church runs with a crew, and yours is not coming back.<eos> - You don't know that.<eos> - Yes, I do.
You can't fight it.<eos> Do I even want to know?<eos> Will it deter you from going in?<eos> Nope.<eos> Then, no, you don't.
- We grant you mercy.<eos> You'll die quick.<eos> It'll be over before you...<eos> I'll deal with this one.<eos> You do the honors?
It means abandon everything and everyone.<eos> It means run for your life and don't look back.<eos> You can't do that.<eos> - I have no choice.<eos> - Yes, you do.
W-What's behind the sheet?<eos> Kate... you've been going through a lot of changes these past few years.<eos> You gave up your place, you got married, and you became a captain.<eos> But some of the things that you love have fallen by the wayside, including one thing that's been gathering dust in your father's garage.<eos> - You didn't?
Hiding me.<eos> Protecting me.<eos> Poisoning you!<eos> He'll figure it out!<eos> And what if he doesn't?
Previously on The Vampire Diaries...<eos> I have a family, Matt.<eos> So did I.
Thanks for getting back to me.<eos> I'll admit, I was surprised to see you on my phone sheet.<eos> Is there something I can do for you, Damon?<eos> I have a rather lengthy list of hell stone rejects that I need killed posthaste, and I hear you have the resources to do it.<eos> I do.
Yeah, I was there.<eos> I came back for the anniversary of the sheriff's death.<eos> I knew it'd be a hard day for Caroline, and I thought there would be a good chance she'd show up, and if she did, I wanted to be there for her.<eos> But she didn't show, did she?<eos> No, she never did.
No tentacles.<eos> Do I even want to know?<eos> Will it deter you from going in?<eos> Nope.<eos> Then no, you don't.
I know you feel the same way.<eos> So...what do we do?<eos> There can be no us.<eos> We should just walk away.<eos> Then why don't you?
But then you went and you made all these other things.<eos> I hated you for needing something else, something that wasn't me.<eos> And then you locked me away, and all I could think about was making you suffer.<eos> You had your reasons.<eos> I did.
Look.<eos> The system is maintaining its own stability, the quantum vortex apparatus is now controlling the orientation.<eos> You're right.<eos> You realize what this means?<eos> I do.
'Cause we're the woke ones.<eos> Hey. Uh, can I just say how happy this makes me, that we can hang out and not make this weird?<eos> Uh, what?<eos> You thought I couldn't do that?<eos> Of - - Of course I did.
I'm not hungry.<eos> Well, then you can watch me eat.<eos> Nate's staying over tonight.<eos> I'm just telling you so you don't have to worry about me.<eos> I don't.
His father?<eos> Biological father.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> You knew about this.<eos> -Of course she did.
You guys thinking of running the pistol again this year?<eos> Maybe.<eos> Hey, did you get your physical yet with Dr. Nagel for next season?<eos> It's tomorrow.<eos> So, how you doing?
Look...don't lecture me on morality.<eos> Get that ***** on the line, now!<eos> Don't you get it ...<eos> I don't have a problem with you.<eos> But I do!
Only the men drink.<eos> Your mother?<eos> Your sister?<eos> Do they drink?<eos> Women from good family don't!
Do you do this often?<eos> Invite women that you barely know onto hotel roofs?<eos> Would you believe me if I told you you were the first?<eos> And hey, I do know you.<eos> - Oh, you do? - Sure.
Two beers, a frog, and a-a crying cat.<eos> Harry?<eos> What's the matter? I just...<eos> I don't know. - I should have said no.<eos> - Why didn't you?
I will.<eos> Nothing to worry about?<eos> I was wondering when you were gonna show up.<eos> You do know why the capacitor failed.<eos> Yes, I do.
Hey, would you say I'm a silver fox?<eos> Oh! Got 'em.<eos> Drake, fetch.<eos> Now even the dog likes you better?<eos> Of course he does.
- Is that it? - And change my bed pan?<eos> Yeah. That would've been nice.<eos> Hey, Craig, you want to make some money?<eos> Old times' sake?<eos> No, he doesn't. He doesn't.
How's Craig? Fine.<eos> That's all I get?<eos> Look, my boys don't know about this, and I don't want 'em to.<eos> He still look like me?<eos> He never did.
Okay. Ready?<eos> How are you feeling?<eos> Thank you.<eos> I was in a car accident a few years ago, and, um... I started taking Oxy. And somewhere along the way...<eos> Yeah, my mom did heroin.
He's a teenage boy. He might just do it for pussy.<eos> Jesus, you're not considering having her sleep with him, are you?<eos> We need him to wear a wire.<eos> Do you really give a shit how she gets him to do it?<eos> Yeah, actually, I do.
Bones prove where the artifacts came from.<eos> You can't sell one without the other.<eos> But that take, especially that gold ring that everybody wants so bad, must be in the other bag.<eos> You don't know where it is?<eos> If I did, brother...
Oh, please.<eos> You couldn't stop staring at Jill's boobs.<eos> Well, what choice did I have?<eos> The damn things threw a shadow.<eos> Don't, just don't.
♪ Edelweiss ♪<eos> I know the Baron's plan.<eos> Heil Hitler!<eos> You did not salute the Fuehrer.<eos> Oh, yeah. Sure, I did.
Ah. Thought you'd never ask.<eos> Back up, everyone.<eos> Ah, what's next?<eos> Don't you think that's enough incineration for one day, Mr. Rory?<eos> No, I do not, Professor.
But I believe in my men.<eos> And I believe in the good that we're doing.<eos> Do you?<eos> Do you believe in your mission, Captain Lance?<eos> I do.
@ ~ I wanted to say that.<eos> There's our train.<eos> Loaded with enough dwarf star to punch a hole in a mountain and cut off the pass to the East.<eos> How do we stop a moving locomotive?<eos> We don't.
There's our train.<eos> Loaded with enough dwarf star to punch a hole in a mountain and cut off the pass to the East.<eos> How do we stop a moving locomotive?<eos> We don't.<eos> I do.
I remembered how we... you don't think that's something?<eos> Let me present you with a scenario.<eos> You're confronted with something, a threat that you've never seen before.<eos> You don't know how to stop it.<eos> Who does?
So what?<eos> That's that me, it's not this me.<eos> And I want to be a speedster.<eos> I... I want to be a flash.<eos> No, no, no, you don't.
You'll be fine.<eos> I promise.<eos> Hey, man.<eos> I just wanted to see if you wanted to talk about...<eos> I don't.
The Dominators have the President.<eos> - Hey, son.<eos> - I don't understand, Dad.<eos> No one in this family wants me to have powers.<eos> You don't.
Are you all right?<eos> Yeah, yeah, yeah.<eos> I mean, I barely knew the kid, Thea.<eos> But that doesn't make it sting any less.<eos> Well, yeah, sure it does.
Victims 3 and 4 were not random.<eos> We think Prometheus is using those names as anagrams to spell out other names.<eos> Adam Hunt, Ted Gaynor, Palmer Cokes, Sachi Beech.<eos> Those names supposed to mean anything to us?<eos> They do to him.
Right.<eos> Well, I got to go, so you guys need to run a DNA test on these ashes and bone fragments to find out who this person was and why Prometheus is keeping their remains.<eos> You guys know how to run a DNA sequencer, right?<eos> No.<eos> Of course you don't.
Well, we've had a BOLO out for weeks.<eos> I'm not talking about a be on the lookout order.<eos> I'm talking about a shoot to kill.<eos> I don't know how that will sit with the public.<eos> I do.
Isn't that the best?<eos> You guys made a person.<eos> We did.<eos> And I like to think I helped.<eos> You didn't.
That's what cars are for.<eos> That's not gonna bring Jodi back.<eos> Yeah, but it might stop that dirtbag from killing someone else.<eos> Look, I miss Jodi as much as you all do, but Travis didn't kill her.<eos> Her addiction did.
Okay, so what you're saying is that you have no real alibi, but plenty of motive.<eos> Look, I made a mistake.<eos> I almost went to jail for it.<eos> You really think I'd risk everything a second time?<eos> For $80 million, yes, I do.
It's all yours, Hirsch.<eos> Hey-o. Second responder.<eos> Yo, dude, you didn't carry that all the way up the stairs, did you?<eos> You know there's a dumbwaiter, right?<eos> No, I did not.
I don't-- she's not gonna say-- tell her what?<eos> - She's not gonna say anything.<eos> - He's right.<eos> She's not gonna talk, but if we keep her out there, we can monitor her and maybe get a lead.<eos> And what if we don't, then?
Screws with all the targeting systems.<eos> Well, that's why he's here.<eos> He's got the security codes.<eos> He's right.<eos> I do.
What were you doing out there, anyway?<eos> So, I was rehearsing for an audition, to be WNY-8's new weather man.<eos> Cloudy with a chance of Tucker.<eos> Wait, wait. I thought you wanted to be an entertainment reporter?<eos> I do!
You're forgetting something very important.<eos> She's not into me.<eos> - (elevator dings)<eos> - You don't know that.<eos> Well, I do now.
So, uh, what are you guys talking about?<eos> Your friends were just telling me about all the other girls you're dating.<eos> Why would you do that?<eos> I specifically asked you not to do that.<eos> We didn't.
I'll try to convince Taro to speak to you.<eos> He's the one who leaked the invoices online.<eos> Anyway, the scandal is my problem, not yours.<eos> You're not meant to know the workings of a national election!<eos> Right, and I don't, but Taro does.
I want to go home, get Frankie, and just keep moving.<eos> But first, I want to kill everyone who's responsible for what just happened.<eos> Hell, yeah.<eos> - You want revenge?<eos> - You don't?
You know, before the quarantine was in place in St. Louis, it was just me and 115 people in a Costco.<eos> But I was able to protect them, because they wanted more than anything to be there.<eos> Not like those broken people we saw in that shelter.<eos> Back then, ‭the people wanted to fight.<eos> They still do, sir.
Honestly, I would choose to stay home if I could, but when my sister was ill, we took on her medical bills, and it drained our savings.<eos> So I work during the day, and I study for the bar at night.<eos> I never meant it to affect my children this way.<eos> Do you know who broke into our house?<eos> Yeah, we do.
Clearly someone on the inside leaked the details of the op.<eos> Which is exactly why I conducted an off-the-book investigation.<eos> All my operatives were cleared. The leak did not come from MI6, it came from NCIS.<eos> And why didn't you relay this information to morrow?<eos> I did.
But then, I felt pretty sure before. What's the difference?<eos> There were a lot of things that weren't known back then, or looked into.<eos> And a lot of mistakes.<eos> And no one ever even spoke to Chris Nelms that day?<eos> Never did. Unbelievable.
That was my voice.<eos> And I did care.<eos> I thought death would be too easy for you, too easy an escape.<eos> And I didn't want you to cheat the system.<eos> And I still don't.
Oh, don't.<eos> - You do. - I just...<eos> I've been a cop<eos> - for five years and...<eos> - You do.
Dude, I had a friend named Adolf.<eos> Okay, Adolf.<eos> I didn't hold it against him.<eos> And besides, I think the Devil - gets a bad rap. - Oh.<eos> - You do, do you?
Because I seem to remember her telling both of us where to shove it.<eos> Luci, you don't think she helped Mom escape, do you?<eos> Well, that doesn't sound like the kind of evil, duplicitous thing a demon would do, now, does it?<eos> But, no, I don't because I found Mum.<eos> - You did?
Now that we are stuck here, I need to figure out... where I fit in.<eos> And she's been helping me do that.<eos> Thanks.<eos> I knew you wouldn't understand.<eos> I barely do.
No.<eos> No, it's not.<eos> Why do you say that?<eos> Well, I've assumed a lot about my mother, including the fact that she wants revenge for what I did to her.<eos> - And now she doesn't?
You win a championship, you got a right to be in that Canton conversation.<eos> - You really think so?<eos> - Don't say you ain't dreamt of having that beautiful beard in bronze.<eos> Yeah, but I don't wanna get ahead of myself.<eos> Shit, well, you do it with everything else.
He doesn't understand English?<eos> Tell him to put the gun down. ...or my team will beat him till he speaks all 480 languages of India<eos> Tell him!<eos> You have your passport, right?<eos> Yes, I do.
Hey everyb...<eos> Damn it.<eos> Do you need a hand there, Sophie?<eos> No, I got it!<eos> You really don't.
I'm worthless to one, but priceless to two.<eos> Love.<eos> They love me.<eos> If you would've bought the election, you would've never known.<eos> But now you do.
It was an accident that I deeply regret.<eos> And I was not gonna tell you this, but then...<eos> Edward,<eos> I know what you did.<eos> You do?
Someone paid 'em off.<eos> The question is, who?<eos> Who has that kind of money and influence?<eos> You don't know.<eos> But I do.
I feel like this office is cursed.<eos> You think Barnes'll be all right?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I'm sorry I doubted you.<eos> You didn't.
I was angry.<eos> The guy killed my father.<eos> He had the nerve to smile at me.<eos> Do you have any idea what that feels like?<eos> No, I don't.
Like always.<eos> So I figured that if his toys started stabbing each other with a celestial blade, that maybe he might take a moment.<eos> Humans are dying because of you.<eos> Well, humans die.<eos> They all do eventually.
Well, that's an interesting theory, but we don't have any evidence that Eric Cooper's the killer.<eos> Mm, actually we do.<eos> Prints just came back.<eos> Eric Cooper.<eos> How did you...?
Right.<eos> If only.<eos> Oh!<eos> Good. You came.<eos> Yes, he did.
- Do you know him?<eos> - He's my wife's boss.<eos> He was murdered.<eos> - You knew that already.<eos> - No, I didn't.
- No.<eos> - Why not?<eos> I can't afford it.<eos> Come on, you really think I'm here for money?<eos> We do, yes.
People don't think there's a process to being happy.<eos> So what do you want?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I mean, I guess I just want a chance to find out.<eos> Who doesn't?
! I'll say it.<eos> I'm sorry I turned you in.<eos> It was a mistake.<eos> Didn't know who I was.<eos> Now I do.
Um, I think I've been sending some confusing messages.<eos> Punching me in the throat, abruptly running away from me.<eos> I think you've been pretty clear.<eos> No, because those actions might send the message that I don't like you and that I don't want to see you...<eos> And I do.
No, no, no, no! No, no, no!<eos> Stop, stop, stop, stop! Stop, stop, stop!<eos> Stop, stop, stop, stop!<eos> No, don't, don't!<eos> Don't!
Yeah, she's on her way from Madrid.<eos> This ain't on you, Javi.<eos> It's on Escobar.<eos> And one way or another, he pays.<eos> We all do.
- Me? Me, ma'am?<eos> Me? - We shouldn't leave, Tata.<eos> - All of this is your fault.<eos> If you'd listened to Pablo, my brother would still be alive.<eos> Because you do that so well?
Now, we hope you like our tent.<eos> We think the great thing is that because it roams around the world, we get a different view out of the big picture windows every week.<eos> So this week, obviously we've got the high desert of California.<eos> - Next week, who knows?<eos> - I do.
Yeah, you're supposed to love church.<eos> Also, the singing is good, and I'm getting really good at it.<eos> Mom, Morgan says that her church is really great.<eos> Did you know that Mormons are really into music?<eos> No, honey, I didn't.
- The girl from chorus, honey.<eos> Which girl?<eos> The black one, baby.<eos> The one who asked you for a playdate on Friday.<eos> No, they didn't.
James and I are going on our first date.<eos> It's gonna be great.<eos> We are finally both free and clear to just hang out.<eos> No aliens trying to destroy the Earth.<eos> Just him and me, together like normal people, doing what people do on dates.
Yeah. How long do you plan to stay here?<eos> Don't know.<eos> Honestly, I don't know.<eos> And anyway I believe, we never decide the time.<eos> Life does.
- That's sweet of him.<eos> - Yeah, he's really sweet.<eos> She thought she loved me.<eos> But she didn't?<eos> No, she did.
But Gurpreet said you're Pakistani.<eos> We are Pakistanis.<eos> Do you have any objection?<eos> Of course not.<eos> We don't if you don't.
I want to tell you enough.<eos> Did I tell you to love me?<eos> Did I tell you not to love Amar?<eos> But..you told Amar, that you love me.<eos> I did.
If I had that right. ...then you could've never loved someone else.<eos> Not now..or in the next lifetime..or after that.<eos> Then why?<eos> I just want to tell you.. What you're doing is completely different from what you want, Taran.<eos> You didn't do anything wrong, Taran.
I don't.<eos> No, I-I do.<eos> It's just been a long time since this has even been an option.<eos> I know, I know.<eos> Um, you don't.
Was.<eos> I don't follow baseball much anymore.<eos> Yeah, but still, you got to love watching the Yanks get slapped around, right?<eos> The Yankees?<eos> Who doesn't?
I know what I've lost, okay?<eos> I do, I... and I know what I got to do to get it back.<eos> Dad, please don't go.<eos> Raimy, I know you mean well.<eos> I do.
You didn't...<eos> You talked at him.<eos> You did not talk to him.<eos> - There is a difference.<eos> - I didn't...
I reckon so.<eos> Don't overdo it out there.<eos> I know my limits.<eos> You worry too much.<eos> No, I don't.
Come on, come on, come on, come on!<eos> I got it!<eos> Grandpa, help me.<eos> I thought you had it trapped.<eos> I did.
You never listened to me.<eos> You never encouraged me.<eos> - I wanted to be a writer!<eos> - You tried.<eos> Yeah, I did.
Yeah, I did.<eos> I tried that.<eos> I wanted to be a writer, and you wanted me to be you. Or at least one of your beloved Mustangs.<eos> That's true.<eos> I did.
Who else is going to help him?<eos> Did Karev tell you what happened with this patient tonight?<eos> Huh. You should ask him.<eos> I thought this little one got to go home.<eos> Uh, yeah, she did.
You are bored out of your freaking mind.<eos> Oh, my God, I'm so bored.<eos> And I can't move as much as I want to, so we just sit and stare and stare and stare.<eos> And I love Harriet.<eos> I do, obviously.
Yeah, it's weird, and... hard.<eos> Agreed.<eos> It's hard.<eos> I don't like it.<eos> - I don't either.
Tracked her down to return it.<eos> - Harris, Fiona, this is Evan. - Hey.<eos> No, we met.<eos> I didn't have pants on.<eos> I do now.
You mean harassment?<eos> - Something like that.<eos> - You're the interested party?<eos> - I didn't say that.<eos> - No, you didn't.
What would we want with them?<eos> - We do not want bodies.<eos> No, we don't.<eos> So you're saying there was no transfer?<eos> The FBI didn't...
Never a fan of the eggy bread.<eos> No, Granny. It's a place.<eos> - And its Count has quite the reputation. - Oh.<eos> Why would he want to meet with us?<eos> He doesn't.
The Queen's our friend.<eos> She's changed.<eos> She doesn't want you to do this.<eos> That's where you're wrong.<eos> She does.
Shit!<eos> Whenever I laugh, these things fall right out!<eos> Do you still love me?<eos> What? You know I do.<eos> No, I don't.
Jesus!<eos> ...in a majority government.<eos> Even here in Hull...<eos> Did you hear that?<eos> We did it!
Not you, though. I asked you if you were in favour of war and ruin.<eos> And what did you say?<eos> You said no.<eos> You're a true leader!<eos> Not a puppet who does whatever--
Trust me...<eos> It doesn't matter.<eos> The Cabinet is empty.<eos> I knew it would be.<eos> Every Rhodian does.
He was disheveled, out of breath, sweaty.<eos> You were about to ask him if he needed anything, but he was in such a hurry, he left without saying a word.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> I didn't see anything like that.<eos> Yes, you did.
"No talent.<eos> Now I have ear cancer."<eos> Emily!<eos> -[Jim and Bethany] Emily.<eos> -I didn't...
Ishida Ryo.<eos> You stand accused of the death of your father,<eos> Emperor Ishida Tetsuda.<eos> How do you plead?<eos> I don't.
I haven't seen him since he left home happily singing about his friendship with you.<eos> Dad, what do you know?<eos> What?<eos> Nothing!<eos> I don't... oh, oh...
All these years I've been pretending to be the idiot bartender while actually I'm this super genius guy.<eos> Now, do you want to avenge your father?<eos> I'm in.<eos> Do I get any weapons?<eos> You certainly do.
Why don't we do one of Maggie's puzzles?<eos> Cow goes in the cow-shaped hole, boom.<eos> Next case.<eos> Hmm, I thought the one good thing about you hurting yourself was that we could spend more time together.<eos> You did?
We got something here, Oscar.<eos> We have ourselves a moment.<eos> Yes, we do.<eos> Now, I know you love Al.<eos> Yes, I do.
- We...<eos> - You're the one who made me that appointment with that first guy who turned out not to even be a doctor.<eos> - How do I even know I have cancer at all?<eos> - Just trust us.<eos> You do.
Yeah, right. Yeah.<eos> It's just now coming to me. I've never had my blood even tested.<eos> I just went to a person who said, "You undeniably have cancer."<eos> I don't even know if I actually have cancer!<eos> - You do.
You're aware of that, right?<eos> On my children, I'm telling you the truth.<eos> I believe you.<eos> That's the thing. I do!<eos> But, unfortunately, my very impatient partner does not.
That is the beauty, Joe.<eos> No.<eos> You saved my life.<eos> Please tell me it matters.<eos> Of course it does, Joe.
Don't breathe!<eos> Hold your breath! No!<eos> - John, Emily, don't breathe!<eos> - Uncle Frank!<eos> No! No! Don't...
- Mr. Forrest... so many lives were ruined that night.<eos> Your daughter's, her boyfriend's, yours.<eos> - Is there a question?<eos> - Someone had to pay for that, didn't they?<eos> - Yeah, they sure as hell did.
I finally triangulated Murphy's signal.<eos> He was transmitting from Spokane.<eos> Washington?<eos> That makes no sense.<eos> And anything else does?
If you'll have me.<eos> On one condition.<eos> I hear you've been having fun with Louis Litt.<eos> But it stops now.<eos> Done.
Yeah, whatever you say, Kevin.<eos> I know I haven't told you why I'm in here, Mike...<eos> But you don't understand.<eos> From the second I got here, I've had to watch what I say, every single word, and every morning I get up, and I remind myself not to say the wrong thing to the wrong person, and every night I go to bed and think,<eos> "Another day down where I didn't."
Why doesn't it say it on the card?<eos> Because a guy that good isn't in the phone book.<eos> Listen, Rachel, when you get to a certain level, everybody has their person.<eos> Harvey has Vanessa, I have Carter.<eos> And now I do too.
Okay, Mike.<eos> I'll make it happen.<eos> Do you have a second?<eos> Actually, I don't, Donna, because I'm going on the most important date of my life tonight, and I have no idea where I'm taking her.<eos> Yes, you do.
That's why I came out here alone.<eos> You can't do it for me this time.<eos> Do you know how it feels when you know all your happiness is a lie?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I do.
- Suh's the least of my worries.<eos> Anderson clipped me last night.<eos> You got fired?<eos> I didn't tell you?<eos> No, you definitely didn't.
And Edward!<eos> And Ed...<eos> How could I forget?<eos> And we brought you back together to see if magic will strike a second time.<eos> Just do you.
We each get a pickled ear.<eos> A bag of Mentho-lyptus.<eos> Jar of black strap molasses.<eos> More ammo.<eos> The babies do cuddles with Mama.
You're seeing their faces, aren't you?<eos> Everyone else...<eos> what's wrong with them?<eos> - Why don't they see it?<eos> - I do.
And who knows what kind of weapon they stole from the energy lab in Pasadena.<eos> You want to know what's connecting these things.<eos> Ithink it might be me.<eos> Now you see it.<eos> Now you don't.
- Just do it!<eos> I get it.<eos> You and Phil Coulson are close.<eos> I'm the new Director, your boss, so you think there are things that I don't need to know.<eos> But I do.
Well, the first part is like you said.<eos> The fire, the chase, the shooting.<eos> But what I remember most is feeling like I screwed up that because of me, you were going to die.<eos> We both were.<eos> We didn't.
She's throwing this big... Hollywood party at her house tonight, right? The network president's gonna be there, everyone.<eos> I'm supposed to show up, get down on my hands and knees and beg to be the Manny again.<eos> They own me, Sis.<eos> I don't know what I'm gonna do.<eos> Well, I do, and you did it already.
Yeah, those guys are good.<eos> You think it's too soon for this.<eos> Think I'm a media freakshow.<eos> I should keep my head down, focus on the game.<eos> Actually, no. I don't.
Sorry, the Korean Consulate.<eos> I need an interpreter.<eos> You're aware our manager got thrown out of the game and our pitcher just escalated a beanball war?<eos> - Yes, I am. ‭ - Oh, it's a shame it had to end like this for Al.<eos> Does it, Frank?
Sawyer?<eos> It's Danvers.<eos> Can I talk to you a minute?<eos> I don't know you.<eos> Now you do.
That's the difference between us.<eos> I don't want to remember.<eos> You want to still be there.<eos> You want to relive it, over and over.<eos> I don't!
It will be.<eos> I'm going to teach you how.<eos> I got the impression that you didn't want to spend time with me.<eos> Oh, you're right.<eos> I didn't.
Hey, I was hoping you'd turn up.<eos> Any interest in a game?<eos> Well, actually, I was wondering if you were still good for that drink you promised me.<eos> You told Kara?<eos> Yeah, you did!
I know how hard this is for you.<eos> Because I was young... and I didn't realize how hard it was for you.<eos> So where does that leave us?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I really don't.
I'm just gonna go make a call.<eos> Goff has been AWOL for 20 years on my end, and I am the one dealing with the fact that this psycho beat and strangled Mom.<eos> Everybody wants a memorial for her.<eos> They want to mourn her.<eos> Of course they do.
I don't believe this.<eos> What's wrong?<eos> This guy from the office just congratulated me on being pregnant.<eos> You did already know, right?<eos> No one at the office did.
Because you're wasting your chance.<eos> And what's the point in living if you're not gonna live?<eos> You might as well do everyone a favor and kill yourself now.<eos> I usually pray for men like you.<eos> I do.
I've been test driving this bad boy with this other bad boy all day.<eos> For six hours.<eos> We went through every Wendy's drive-thru in Queens.<eos> I wrote "Help me" on a napkin.<eos> But nobody did.
Bravo.<eos> You fooled us.<eos> Call the police.<eos> You have no right to treat us like this!<eos> - Yes, they do.
Previously on Pitch...<eos> The video is everywhere.<eos> I just don't want to do it anymore.<eos> I just don't...
Turn that off.<eos> Been working on a cutter.<eos> You want to see it?<eos> No.<eos> I don't.
- Trust me.<eos> Let's say 149.<eos> Damn it, Riggs, giving Ned money wasn't part of the plan!<eos> Uh, in fairness, I didn't have a plan.<eos> Yes, we did.
More than you'll ever know.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Worked in "Back to the Future II."<eos> I know what you're gonna say.<eos> No, you don't.
I used to pray every day, hoping somehow she was still alive, being kept somewhere.<eos> I used to dream about it.<eos> But now, after this, I hope she died quick.<eos> I feel like when we were little you told me you saw his face.<eos> Did I?
Give it time, Ugga.<eos> There could still be a second scream.<eos> No. You're okay.<eos> I could've sworn I heard... [screaming]<eos> Oh, you did.
We'll identify the issue and stop it from happening again.<eos> Yes, we're anxious for you to begin.<eos> Well, let's get crack-a-lackin'.<eos> My Happy needs her sleep.<eos> Before you do, a few things:
Every choice that you make is no longer about your future alone.<eos> Everything changes.<eos> You said that you had a serious boyfriend out west.<eos> You didn't want children?<eos> He did.
That is impressive.<eos> I better pace myself.<eos> Hey, I love the new haircut.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Yeah, I do.
Copy that.<eos> Come on, dear.<eos> She's tough.<eos> Trust me, you do not want to mess with Miss Loretta.<eos> No, I don't.
Cancer, sterility, birth defects.<eos> Turns out a chemical plant up river had been leaking for years.<eos> They'd known about it the whole time, of course, but it was cheaper to up their campaign contributions than to repair the damage.<eos> So the people elected to protect us looked the other way as... thousand of families were destroyed.<eos> I don't...
All right, Happy, you're certain you stopped the footage at exactly 7:13?<eos> I know what seven, one and three look like.<eos> Okay, if the president's chief of staff downloaded that bug, and the president sent the FBI to get us to fix the server...<eos> How do we know Backside, Fart and Go-Smell-Me aren't in on this?<eos> We don't.
Uh, it's usually used to hunt big game.<eos> It's, uh, meant to knock a lion out from distance in seconds.<eos> Of course, that-that doesn't necessarily guarantee that you're not gonna get eaten.<eos> You know who it's registered to?<eos> I do. Yeah.
You're worried about your parents, and that's making this worse, but they're gonna be all right.<eos> They're gonna find that magic little baby tree thing and defeat the Evil Queen.<eos> They're gonna find that magic little tree thing?<eos> Yeah, that's right.<eos> What if they don't?
I thought I'd lost you forever.<eos> May the love between you always be strong, true, and eternal.<eos> If you need anything, I will always find you.<eos> Do you promise?<eos> I do.
- Be right with you.<eos> - Okay, well,<eos> Patton found the brother of our dead gunman, James Connor.<eos> Yeah, he may have spotted me.<eos> Yeah, he did.
No, I'm not trying to slut shame you. Why didn't you return my text?<eos> [Alison] My privacy is public.<eos> [Jacob] Yeah, but mine isn't.<eos> [Alison chuckles] Uh, I don't think that's true.<eos> -What do you--
Von Braun will be at the demonstration tonight.<eos> I can get us past the front door.<eos> Lucy can accompany me as my secretary.<eos> - How do I get in?<eos> - You don't.
The Feds are Halbeck's problem.<eos> All that matters to me is that we are right on schedule.<eos> Gentlemen, mind if I join you?<eos> Yeah.<eos> We do.
If someone hired this Lindquist Concern to kill Najjar, I want to know what revolutionary technology they got their hands on.<eos> Make it quick.<eos> Komarov gets massages twice a week from a woman who moonlights as an FBI informant.<eos> - He does?<eos> - He does now.
Between you and Kirk, between Tom and Kirk.<eos> Can you at least admit how difficult that is?<eos> No.<eos> It's only difficult if you accept the premise that Kirk is your father.<eos> I don't.
Chicken Kiev.<eos> My... my kids love it when I make Chicken Kiev.<eos> I do mine from scratch. I mean, I don't have chickens.<eos> I have a butcher friend.<eos> Who doesn't in L.A. these days?
Uh, yes. I remember this.<eos> His 32nd birthday party. Ah.<eos> His sixth grade graduation.<eos> He made the Honor Roll that year. Yeah.<eos> He did every year. Huh.
We are not alone.<eos> CABE:<eos> It's just like The Birds.<eos> Probably didn't see that film.<eos> Oh, I did.
But...<eos> Come on.<eos> Why is there a photo of me and a letter that you sent to William's apartment?<eos> No, you know what? Don't-- don't speak.<eos> Please, don't just-- um...
- I'm sorry.<eos> This early midlife crisis is so you, I can't stand it.<eos> You want something to smile about?<eos> - No, please.<eos> - Do you, do you really?
She could top herself, but not kill someone else.<eos> - Have they arrested her?<eos> - Yes.<eos> You think she did it?<eos> No, I don't.
Destroy the doc.<eos> How? I'm not...<eos> I don't...<eos> I don't have it.<eos> When you do.
You said you have some files on J. Edgar Hoover?<eos> Actually, no. We wanted to ask you about the Watergate Hotel break-in.<eos> No. I only came...<eos> I don't know anything about the Watergate.<eos> Yes, you do.
You should be.<eos> They control all of us.<eos> Look.<eos> I don't know everything.<eos> No one does.
No.<eos> I've showed up at a doorstep or two.<eos> I'm not proud of that, though.<eos> Well, why do you care so much about it, anyway?<eos> I don't, Lasalle.
Oh, God.<eos> We wanted to, but we thought if you knew, she might pick it up.<eos> Look, you didn't tell her anything, did you?<eos> I may be dumb, but I'm not stupid.<eos> I just don't...
I know Morse code.<eos> Wow, that's really interesting, Hank!<eos> Deirdre, do you have any hidden talents?<eos> Thank you very much for asking, Evie.<eos> And, yes, I do.
And now I'm...<eos> All day long, I have been thinking that there is... there's a reason that I was in that line.<eos> There's a reason that I met you.<eos> And I don't believe in God or fate or anything.<eos> She doesn't at all.
I know.<eos> I waited anyway.<eos> We need to talk.<eos> You're right.<eos> We do.
And now I'm...<eos> All day long, I have been thinking that there is... there's a reason that I was in that line.<eos> There's a reason that I met you.<eos> And I don't believe in God or fate or anything.<eos> She doesn't at all.
I know.<eos> I waited anyway.<eos> We need to talk.<eos> You're right.<eos> We do.
They're useless without someone capable of decrypting them.<eos> Someone like Eric Boyer?<eos> We have to destroy the drives before the terrorists figure out how to decrypt them.<eos> How do I know you're not leading me into a trap?<eos> You don't.
Sleeping with the man who could get you fired.<eos> Why?<eos> Why compromise the entire mission for sex?<eos> You don't get it.<eos> I don't.
Scalpel.<eos> How do you know when you're too tired to operate?<eos> Right about when you make your first mistake.<eos> I hate that answer.<eos> You don't.
- Do not make that cut!<eos> Basin.<eos> Clips, please. Boki.<eos> We decided not to list him.<eos> No, you did.
Okay.<eos> Actually, no.<eos> Um, what did you mean before when, uh... When you said... "Promise me we'll never have kids"?<eos> I shouldn't have said that.<eos> Yeah, but... you did.
T-Leaf, sit down and join us.<eos> No, I can't.<eos> I'm already on round nine, about to level up.<eos> I haven't thought about Evie for 31,207 steps.<eos> I just did.
I'm sorry, but, you know, I cross-check and I figure it out quickly.<eos> I know.<eos> It's gonna get better.<eos> Well, I wish it would hurry up and do that because this feels really rotten.<eos> Of course it does.
Like, we were supposed to do this together?<eos> Or like, I agreed to go out with you because you were gonna lose the weight<eos> - for me.<eos> And...<eos> - and I did.
Because I'm black?<eos> No, because you're black and you're adopted.<eos> Yeah, hit the jackpot with that combination.<eos> - Couldn't have had it any easier.<eos> - In our house, you did.
Yeah, well, that's why we got to dig deep.<eos> And this system generally works?<eos> Don't know.<eos> No one's ever tried it.<eos> - And if it doesn't?
Somewhere between one in a billion and impossible.<eos> How do they help us land?<eos> Hey, there.<eos> I don't know what else to do.<eos> Well, I do.
So this footage is a couple months old, but I'm pretty sure these were two of Bennett's customers.<eos> The date and time jibe with the logs he kept in his office.<eos> His plane returned from a trip to Montreal not 20 minutes before these two got into that limo, but that's not all.<eos> You know Mike over there is in the Army Reserves, right?<eos> Yeah. Did a few tours as an MP in Afghanistan.
Even if we do turn Roman, the last thing I need to deal with is a sociopathic killer.<eos> He's her brother... and if you don't at least hear her out, you risk losing her.<eos> You really think that she would turn to Sandstorm if she doesn't get her way?<eos> No.<eos> I don't.
- Fine...<eos> - what's the Akkadian?<eos> - It's a myth.<eos> It's an assassin so lethal it's able to reach targets in such untouchable locations that the intel community doesn't believe it even exists.<eos> Yeah, and neither does Snopes, apparently.
Come on, that's... that is pretty romantic, right?<eos> It is when you say it, for some reason.<eos> Oh, and here's another thing I know for sure happened on our wedding day.<eos> You looked beautiful and I... was the luckiest man in the world.<eos> I did.
I mean, in the last day, our kids have engaged in vandalism, conspiracy and racketeering.<eos> I don't really know what that is, but they make a hell of a racket.<eos> Okay, you guys know Uncle Don.<eos> What you don't know is that he is also a father.<eos> Yeah, we do, to cousin Mikey.
Why does the president want to know about Hannah Wells?<eos> He's interested in some information she claims to have on Peter MacLeish.<eos> Why?<eos> What kind of information did she say she had?<eos> She didn't.
Tell her we'll give her an exclusive on the man that we have in custody, but she's gonna have to wait till tomorrow.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Sir, I'm sorry about Atwood.<eos> I know you didn't want it to be true.<eos> None of us did.
It's wonderful.<eos> -You can walk again--<eos> -Michele, why are you so happy?<eos> It took me years to accept that I would never walk again.<eos> But I did it.
I think it's time we open the gate.<eos> How many candidates have been eliminated?<eos> None.<eos> Marco brought them together, they were organized until the end.<eos> Everyone did their part with very little conflict.
[Ezequiel] Are you hungry?<eos> If you eat, you'll be eliminated.<eos> -What?<eos> -It wouldn't be fair to the others.<eos> What if I don't?
Then he doesn't deserve to be missed at all.<eos> Because he's one of them... not one of us.<eos> -It doesn't work like that, Ezequiel.<eos> -Julia...<eos> It doesn't.
Let's begin.<eos> First candidate.<eos> Joana is done.<eos> Next.<eos> Done, why?
What did you say?<eos> I'd like to quit.<eos> Have you lost your mind?<eos> You made it this far.<eos> Very few do.
You have to stay in your room until the transportation to Offshore!<eos> Please!<eos> Please, open the door!<eos> Please! I know I was wrong!<eos> I do!
What about the tox report?<eos> The driver wasn't drunk.<eos> There was nothing there.<eos> Hey, look, I know how hard this can be.<eos> No, you don't.
If we're right and Shaw knows how to cure Kirk,<eos> Reddington has just made sure that's not going to happen.<eos> Which means Liz is his only hope.<eos> Kirk's not gonna hurt her as long as he needs her stem cells to survive.<eos> But he doesn't.
She had A joy for living.<eos> She was more alive than anyone I knew.<eos> When I heard she killed herself...<eos> I didn't believe it.<eos> I still don't.
What?<eos> I'm trying to see if turn of the century exclamations can make a comeback.<eos> It's a small linguistics experiment I'm doing.<eos> Anyway, hey, you don't even like movies.<eos> Yes, I do. Hooey.
But she saw through my insecurities.<eos> She gave me a chance to be the man that she knew that I could be.<eos> But you know what it's like.<eos> She was in love over this nonsense playboy life.<eos> Yeah. I sure do.
And they'll be able to follow the trail we left.<eos> We were worried about speed, not stealth.<eos> We need to act while we have the numbers on our side.<eos> Guy out there has a gun.<eos> We don't.
Apparently, somebody ratted us out.<eos> Yeah, but you didn't get busted, right?<eos> No, thanks to you.<eos> How much did Percy say about this Ramon dude, exactly?<eos> Not enough, obviously. Yeah, but you didn't do anything wrong, right?
Did you see my double?<eos> You had a hit?<eos> I had three hits.<eos> I'm just kidding you.<eos> Of course you did.
Someone saw me at the precinct.<eos> An old coworker.<eos> At any moment, the lab is going to realize that the knife is missing, and when that happens, I will be screwed.<eos> You should have thought about that before you decided to steal evidence.<eos> I did!
I was living the American dream.<eos> I had tenure, passion, standing room only at my TED talks.<eos> But I didn't have that one thing... that one thing that would make them take notice.<eos> And then?<eos> I did.
That's actually really great.<eos> - Oh, that was you.<eos> - We really gotta get you working.<eos> Let me take a few photos to send to a photographer I used to work with.<eos> - Do some model looks.
Okay, why are you even here?<eos> I thought the whole point of promoting me was you could go off and write.<eos> I would love to be writing, but thanks to you, all I can do is look at Donovan's face and try to figure out why humans find it appealing.<eos> This is insane... you have to be able to admit that he's attractive.<eos> I do...
And I felt that I had the choice to either go into the light or to come back to you.<eos> And well, here we are.<eos> Mm... this is gonna be a tough one.<eos> - You know what's so great?<eos> - No. I don't.
!<eos> 9:18 A.M. refused delivery?<eos> Did you refuse a package to Retired Rear Admiral Jay Garage-A-Roo?<eos> Listen to what you just asked.<eos> Of course I did.
I like to think of her as our Cece.<eos> You screwed the pooch on this one, Winston.<eos> Me?<eos> I didn't screw the pooch.<eos> - Yes, you did.
It's from Winston!<eos> They had to make it out of this dumb blanket.<eos> Winston, you remembered our game night.<eos> I love it.<eos> You do?
They had to make it out of this dumb blanket.<eos> Winston, you remembered our game night.<eos> I love it.<eos> You do?<eos> - She does.
Winston, you remembered our game night.<eos> I love it.<eos> You do?<eos> - She does.<eos> - I do.
Last year, he called me an extremist just because I told him I was a member of the NRA.<eos> I'm sorry, but I don't think there's anything wrong with being a patriot.<eos> All Americans should have the right to defend themselves.<eos> So you have a gun?<eos> You don't?
I'm sure he'll make it a big spectacle.<eos> So I will have the chance to speak?<eos> I'll talk about the gods, about my joy of entering Valhalla.<eos> Even though you don't believe it.<eos> I don't.
So I will have the chance to speak?<eos> I'll talk about the gods, about my joy of entering Valhalla.<eos> Even though you don't believe it.<eos> I don't.<eos> But my sons do.
I'll talk about the gods, about my joy of entering Valhalla.<eos> Even though you don't believe it.<eos> I don't.<eos> But my sons do.<eos> My people do.
You guys find Flynn, I'll go find the boy.<eos> No, no. No, please don't kill me.<eos> Please. Please. Please don't kill me.<eos> No. No, no, no. Don't kill me.<eos> Please! Please don't!
You of all people should know better than to sneak up on a gladiator, especially one with the blood of his vanquished opponent still fresh on his blade.<eos> It was a good battle.<eos> Attilius fought valiantly.<eos> Indeed he did.<eos> They all did.
Mother-in-law, I'll go and buy some soy sauce.<eos> What about money?<eos> That money was for his father's life! His father's life!<eos> Welcome.<eos> How do you do things here?
I mean, I'd just chucked away a lot of my money.<eos> We can't believe it anymore.<eos> We think they just want to keep us here.<eos> God knows why.<eos> Their God certainly doesn't.
What?<eos> - Ice-skating.<eos> - I don't know how to ice-skate.<eos> - Yes, you do.<eos> Because I do.
Detective Snuggles.<eos> Nana warned me not to leave my chocolate lying around.<eos> But it was just after Easter, and I had pulled in a big haul.<eos> I never thought that cat would find my stash.<eos> But he did.
But, Jim, tonight... celebration!<eos> Looking forward.<eos> Seriously, we've got a Defcon One situation in Trollmarket.<eos> - How do you know?<eos> - I just do!
Well, you said you wanted adventure and something more.<eos> - Did that amulet help you find it?<eos> - No.<eos> - No?<eos> You did.
You really like this girl.<eos> No secrets between you two.<eos> Screwdriver?<eos> I thought you liked her too, Blink.<eos> Everyone else did. Ah!
If the hunter is foolish enough to deal with him, I doubt they will return.<eos> Did you bring the charm I require?<eos> Do you know what to do with it?<eos> Don't patronize me.<eos> Of course I do.
I know you see what the Kirin Tor can not.<eos> It's why you left them.<eos> No one can stand against the darkness... alone.<eos> I don't understand what you want me to do.<eos> Yes, you do.
It's the loneliness that makes us weak.<eos> Khadgar.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I wanted to save us all.<eos> I always did.
The woods.<eos> In the mountains.<eos> I gotta be on my way.<eos> - How do you get out of here?<eos> - You don't!
But we have information that tells us that he's staying here with you.<eos> - No.<eos> - Oh, it's...<eos> Wait, you said something.<eos> Yes, you did.
The arrangements were made last minute.<eos> There's no paper trail.<eos> No one able to preplan.<eos> No one even knew which transport they were on.<eos> You did.
What happens if she goes into the light?<eos> There's no getting her back if she does that.<eos> Just because he said that, it doesn't mean... that's true, okay?<eos> Nothing you've said makes sense to me.<eos> And everything else does, right?
It's sealed.<eos> Give it to me.<eos> It's shaking.<eos> Do you think I have it in me to never have another drink for the rest of my life?<eos> Yeah. I do.
- Yeah, same.<eos> - Hey, Stephen?<eos> - Yeah?<eos> Do you want to go home?<eos> Yeah, I do.
We're not in Coachella... waiting for the Molly to kick in so we can writhe in the mud... and wait for Tupac's hologram to come on and make us feel things.<eos> - Understood.<eos> - Good.<eos> You're cynical. I get it.<eos> I really do.
That is against God's will!<eos> Is fornicating outside of wedlock, a Christian act?<eos> But I love him...<eos> Of course...<eos> Of course you do...
- This is my studio.<eos> What's your name?<eos> Linus Harp.<eos> Do you know who occupies the opposite studio?<eos> No... No one does.
You're not him.<eos> - You want a moment alone with him?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Did you get the guy?<eos> - No, Katherine did.
You were sent to protect me by John Connor, the leader of the Resistance.<eos> My son.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> You can't know any of this.<eos> But I do.
- It's irrelevant.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Good thing, too.<eos> We're years away from making this thing work.<eos> But when we do... - Boom!
He seems to be involved in every crime in the city and yet the Bureau keeps saying he's clean.<eos> It's only when another agency has an informant that I hear maybe Whitey isn't so squeaky clean.<eos> Well, I hear that he's very careful, he doesn't use phones... that kind of stuff, and...<eos> Who did you say these other informants were?<eos> I didn't.
Now you gonna have to go to school or you gonna have to go to work.<eos> Now I don't even care if you are a janitor. I don't care what the hell you do...<eos> Long as I own the company. I know, I know.<eos> But you don't own the company.<eos> - Lonzo does. - Okay.
These invoices haven't been paid. They're two or three years outdated.<eos> These are cancelled checks. They all bounced. And these are past due.<eos> Jerry took advantage of you.<eos> I know it's a lot, but you had to know the truth sometime.<eos> Now you do.
- Where were you born?<eos> - Kosovo.<eos> - Kosovo.<eos> You don't have an accent.<eos> [with thick accent] I don't?
Did you get a chance to look at what we sent you, Ben?<eos> It's Charlie.<eos> I'm here, too.<eos> Hi, Charlie.<eos> Yeah, I did.
There's no way you're marking these swaps appropriately.<eos> Why shouldn't we back out of this trade right now?<eos> Didn't I say when we made this deal that the ratings agencies, the SEC and the big banks were clueless? Didn't I say that? - Yes.<eos> - Didn't I say it? Yes, you did.<eos> You did.
But it was us believers, don't you think?<eos> Just like this valley... why it survived, why you and I did... because we have faith.<eos> What if you don't have faith?<eos> You have to.<eos> - Not everybody does.
Must have slipped his mind.<eos> Not easy to picture you making a deal with a royal.<eos> Titus told me you were posted to this planet and said if I helped him, he'd get you your wings back, full reinstatement.<eos> - I figured I owed you.<eos> - Yeah, you do.
Next year you're out of your parents' house right?<eos> Yeah.<eos> We can actually be together.<eos> If you still want to, after all this.<eos> Of course I do.
In 7 weeks when Jenifer Larson, disappears forever... and Susan Flietcher takes up residence in a remote farmhouse in Ashton, Oregon...<eos> Adaline Bowman, beside from one moment of weakness will have kept her vow for the past 60 years.<eos> Hello, Ray again?<eos> Amanda, you're not gonna stand me up are you?<eos> Yes, we did that last year.
Your father needs you here.<eos> Captain!<eos> I was having a fine old time.<eos> You had to go and choose that one, didn't you?<eos> Yes, I did.
"No, you didn't. I didn't say..."<eos> Yes, you did. And thank...<eos> "No, I didn't, I didn't." Yes, you did.<eos> And I thank you.<eos> You did.
They like him because he's, like, an amazing guy.<eos> Look, I like myself.<eos> I wouldn't wanna be anybody else.<eos> And I realize now that none of this matters to me.<eos> But it does to you.
Ah, you know.<eos> I was showin' her a picture of my cousin's baby.<eos> Great.<eos> Yeah, she must really think I'm a whore.<eos> No, she doesn't.
What?<eos> What, are you praying?<eos> Yeah. Somethin' wrong with that?<eos> Well, you don't believe in God, so...<eos> For the good stuff, I do.
Yeah. He's an abomination and he's got to go.<eos> The challenge for me was I was the only human in that scene.<eos> Everyone else was living dead.<eos> So how did that affect how you played the role?<eos> It didn't.
I-is this a date?<eos> I don't cook for people who are tryin' to pitch me.<eos> Whatever.<eos> I thought a nice, normal guy wanted to hang out for once.<eos> I did!
I don't cook for people who are tryin' to pitch me.<eos> Whatever.<eos> I thought a nice, normal guy wanted to hang out for once.<eos> I did!<eos> I do!
Oh.<eos> Is this your girlfriend?<eos> Uh...<eos> 'Cause last night, you said you didn't have a girlfriend.<eos> I don't.
I mean, he's pretty pivotal in the movie, including the final scene.<eos> I don't really understand how you could just cut him out.<eos> Yeah, I-I think that bigger issue thing makes sense.<eos> Oh. D-did you have other problems with the movie?<eos> Yeah, I did.
I shouldn't have done that.<eos> Don't think that way.<eos> There's no connection.<eos> How do you know that?<eos> I just do.
I know you want to do it.<eos> Just kiss me.<eos> -No, I wasn't.<eos> -Ben!<eos> -Okay, for a second I did.
We got to get to the party.<eos> Ben, this is a suicide mission.<eos> Guys, they're gonna bomb this whole town in less than two hours.<eos> What if Denise reaches the military in time?<eos> And what if she doesn't, Carter? Then what?
- There is none.<eos> - What do you mean there is none?<eos> I have the phone number for the French co-producer.<eos> - Leave it be.<eos> - But I do!
Right?<eos> - No, you said a day. Remember?<eos> - No, I didn't. - We agreed to it, Samantha.<eos> - Yes, he did!<eos> - Yes, he did.
Okay, I'll make a deal with you guys.<eos> We'll start to wind the engines down.<eos> You guys can sit here quietly and watch some TV.<eos> We're not getting any channels.<eos> - Did you...?
Petra, I'm sorry.<eos> It was sixth grade, I didn't know what I was doing, and I'm sorry.<eos> It's fine.<eos> I probably didn't have any titties to whisper to anyway.<eos> Nobody did.
I'd like to challenge the protective order in the Geoghan case.<eos> You want to sue the Catholic Church?<eos> We're just filing the motion, but... Yes.<eos> - You think it's that important?<eos> - Yes, I do.
I'm not following up on an article.<eos> - The one in the Phoenix?<eos> - No, in the Globe.<eos> - Did you see the one in the Phoenix?<eos> - No, I didn't.
Look, Mr. Garabedian, I know there's... things, you cannot tell me, but... I also know there's a story here.. and I think it's an important story.<eos> - I already talked to the Phoenix.<eos> - Yeah, there's a reason I didn't see it.<eos> Nobody reads a Phoenix anymore... they're broke, they don't have any power.<eos> The Globe does.
He's only taking bets on how fast Sweeney rules against us.<eos> - Robby.<eos> - Hi, it's me.<eos> - Did you get my message?<eos> - I did.
90 fucking priests?<eos> In Boston?<eos> That's what he said.<eos> If there were 90 of these bastards, people would know.<eos> - Maybe they do.
I gave you my very last pin, young lady, and I am not about to let it go to waste.<eos> What do you mean your last pin?<eos> Wait, that place I saw...<eos> - It exists?<eos> - Of course it does.
This reminds me that that is not good enough.<eos> Who were you with?<eos> You said "we".<eos> In the blizzard.<eos> Did I?
You don't need to apologise... ever.<eos> You never have.<eos> Well, they got to be here somewhere.<eos> They must've gone off for a hike or something.<eos> You do the ricotta?
For God's sake!<eos> Now we have no idea what they are doing.<eos> I might have a solution.<eos> If my targeted can calculate us coming in under 50% for collateral damage on the girl. Do you think you can get approval at your end?<eos> Yes, I do.
Go.<eos> Come on in.<eos> You look great today.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - Doesn't she?
And knowing that, that's the difference.<eos> It's not binary.<eos> You can be decent and gifted at the same time.<eos> He didn't mean it.<eos> Yeah, he did.
Behind my back, at the office, you know what it stood for?<eos> Local Integrated System Architecture.<eos> I was five!<eos> Why couldn't you just lie?<eos> I did.
That all will be eaten.<eos> D'oh!<eos> This system is really rigged against us.<eos> You forgot to glaze me.<eos> No, I didn't.
Okay?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Okay, cool.<eos> Hey, how come you never had kids?<eos> Oh, I did.
Yep.<eos> Why did you decided to come here?<eos> It was lust too strict over there? They weren't cool?<eos> My Mom told me I should try something else.<eos> So I did.
We'll see what happens.<eos> You do love me, don't you?<eos> No, I'll believe it when you say it convincingly.<eos> 'Say it convincingly, or I'm getting out of here.'<eos> Yes, I do.
It's all good.<eos> Look.<eos> I don't have to say this but I did you have an affair with Isabelle?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yes, yes I did.
You were gonna ditch me?<eos> - No!<eos> - Liar!<eos> I never lie!<eos> Yes, you do!
I... love you.<eos> - What'd you say?<eos> - I love you.<eos> I don't think that sounded very sincere.<eos> - Did it?
All right, I'm off.<eos> Happy Valentine's Day.<eos> - Oh, what?<eos> Sweetheart, you know I think it's all a load of commercialised bollocks, right?<eos> Yes, I do.
- I fucking got it! - What?<eos> - It's like a real wedding except like a fantasy.<eos> Then I go out in the crowd and find myself a real fucking bride.<eos> - Oh, fuck!<eos> - And I do everything with her!
It's time.<eos> That shit itched.<eos> - Boom, that's out of here!<eos> - Fuck that thing!<eos> Richie? Done!
Cassidy's hurt and you haven't said anything? Are you serious?<eos> Don't put this on me.<eos> You're the reason we came here.<eos> Yeah, but maybe you're the reason all this shit's happening to us!<eos> - Don't even do that, okay?
So smart, and...<eos> And I know the way he makes me feel.<eos> I love him.<eos> I know you don't understand that but I love him.<eos> I do.
- You undressed me?<eos> - I didn't have much choice<eos> Where did you sleep?<eos> - Dear god...<eos> We didn't...
Oh, hey! Hey, you're back.<eos> I didn't see... see you get here.<eos> Hey, what's everybody doing out here in a state of undress?<eos> I'll give you two guesses.<eos> - You didn't...
- Meth head.<eos> - Fucking meth head.<eos> - Bad beat. - The worst.<eos> - Things will look up.<eos> - They always do.
No, it was... It was something I wanted to tell you so I don't...<eos> I'm gonna do something with my life.<eos> I may not have that figured out yet, but I'm gonna do something.<eos> It's something I wanted to tell you.<eos> So I did.
- Curtis...<eos> - I'm...<eos> I'm serious.<eos> Vanessa, listen to me, don't tell her that I called, okay?<eos> Don't. - Okay.
Well, it wasn't closed quite, Dan.<eos> So, I just wanted to hear you both under these new terms today.<eos> Just you and Chuck, that's all.<eos> Those pants are so tight, you'd think I could see your balls or your dick.<eos> But I don't.
Not really.<eos> I won't ask what that means.<eos> Would I get married again?<eos> No, I wanna be waiting outside the bathroom of my boarding house forever.<eos> Of course I do.
But, make sure you're not being follow.ed Oh.<eos> I didn't win those opera tickets, did I?<eos> No, I'm afraid not<eos> - So, where do we meet?<eos> - We don't.
- God!<eos> - Just...<eos> Please never put that face again.<eos> - I do not even want to know what it means.<eos> - Yes, you do.
- How?<eos> - It was her.<eos> Was she right? Was it.<eos> Was it.<eos> But I did not.
I thought she was some weekend prostitute or something along those lines.<eos> I was shocked to find out you actually had a kid.<eos> Didn't really work out.<eos> No.<eos> No, it didn't.
Someone has been playing an intricate game and has made pawns of us.<eos> And once all these pieces are in position...<eos> Triple Yahtzee.<eos> You think you can find out what's coming?<eos> I do.
I find it enormously charming that you read any book with a dictionary next to you.<eos> My last boyfriend was eight years ago. And he wasn't even my boyfriend.<eos> He was almost 60 and fat and he worked in Human Resources and he had a wife and his daughter was older than me.<eos> And the only reason he pursued me was because he thought he'd have a good shot.<eos> Which he did.
Ben is in big trouble.<eos> It's bad.<eos> He'll need a lawyer.<eos> So you do have money.<eos> No, I don't.
Yes. We're patching you though.<eos> So it was you.<eos> Oh hello.<eos> Mrs. Arid? Did you receive the train set alright?<eos> I did. Yes.
What else am I going to do?<eos> I know you don't like to drive alone. So.<eos> She's young.<eos> Tell me you know what you're doing.<eos> I don't.
I know you don't like to drive alone. So.<eos> She's young.<eos> Tell me you know what you're doing.<eos> I don't.<eos> I never did.
Pigpen!<eos> I will.<eos> A little dirt never hurt anyone.<eos> Schroeder.<eos> I do!
That makes me feel old.<eos> Kids don't know what VCRs are?<eos> What was that?<eos> - Did you hear that?<eos> - You did? -Yeah, man.
Those ants really do it for you, don't they?<eos> - I need to drain the pasta.<eos> - I know.<eos> Is that why you're stepping on my foot?<eos> I do.
- Thank you for this great honor.<eos> - I knew your mother and father well.<eos> If they were still among us, they would be very proud.<eos> - So it begins again.<eos> - So it does.
I know you had designs!<eos> That was years ago.<eos> And she refused me.<eos> And now I'm out here risking my life for both of you perhaps that entitles me to an occasional innuendo.<eos> Well, it doesn't!
Why do you hate them so much?<eos> You should ask my mother and my sisters.<eos> I never met 'em.<eos> That's correct.<eos> You never did.
It's so fun here.<eos> - Is Dennis okay?<eos> - Oh. Of course.<eos> - You want to see him?<eos> - Yes. Yes, I do.
Just tell Felix if he still wants to give me the information that he got, I'll be at 93 Calle Hercules, apartment 4D.<eos> - You moved back to London?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> But I had been in DRC, where I spent the past year, helping out, following your lead.<eos> Don't.
Someday you'll come up with me.<eos> Okay.<eos> Why don't you two keep talking, I'm gonna get dessert ready, okay?<eos> Wow, there's just so much I didn't know.<eos> Well, now you do.
I don't know.<eos> Would you like to count them?<eos> What do you think?<eos> Does it look the part?<eos> It does.
I finished my shift early.<eos> I felt like being alone.<eos> Oh, call for the doctor, Sonny.<eos> Nimish asked me to marry him this morning.<eos> And Abhilash did the same this afternoon.
Fuck!<eos> My life is ruined.<eos> I venture you've heard that I'm going to prison.<eos> Yeah.<eos> No, we all did.
That was the last time I saw Rachel.<eos> She went into a coma shortly after that, and died about 10 hours later.<eos> I know I told you she doesn't die. And I'm sorry.<eos> Deep down somehow, I didn't think she would.<eos> But she did.
That's not until 10, is it?<eos> We'll eat at half seven and you go after. Perfect!<eos> Come on, Sylvie.<eos> - You know me, don't you?<eos> - Yeah, I do.
It's not possible to talk to you.<eos> I've been trying my whole life.<eos> Did you listen, even once?<eos> Do you know how it feels, to be humiliated by a woman?<eos> No... you don't.
I said, give me an update!<eos> I said, status!<eos> I suppose I should be flattered.<eos> I didn't think I merited a contract.<eos> You don't.
This shit's experimental, Doc.<eos> I've seen it work... and believe me when I tell you you don't wanna be the one it's working on.<eos> You're a bastard.<eos> I know.<eos> No. You don't.
I thought she was just for the spa.<eos> It's kind of her to come and support me.<eos> You'll see, she's nice.<eos> José, do you still love me?<eos> Of course I do.
Why bring me here?<eos> Because I love you.<eos> Why marry that goody two-shoes?<eos> You don't love him.<eos> Yes, I do!
And now look.<eos> Sorry.<eos> José, I think I shouldn't have sold the house.<eos> You regret it?<eos> - Yes, she does.
Sorry.<eos> José, I think I shouldn't have sold the house.<eos> You regret it?<eos> - Yes, she does.<eos> - She does.
Unworthy of a hero.<eos> I know.<eos> But it's true.<eos> I don't know how to box.<eos> I never did.
Be quiet!<eos> I'm fed up of this angry soul.<eos> Maybe it's Firmin.<eos> No one thinks of him.<eos> I do.
They're fronts?<eos> Proxies?<eos> So how do they communicate?<eos> How do they connect up to our actor?<eos> They don't.
He's...<eos> That case you stole from this asshole belongs to me.<eos> Well, you may not know this, not from being around these parts, but I'm in the business of collecting money, not giving it away.<eos> I thought Jonathan might have told you that.<eos> I kind of did.
That lady?<eos> Come on.<eos> No, you come on. You know how hard I have just tried to fit into your world.<eos> Why can't you try to fit into mine?<eos> I do!
- Zachary.<eos> - What?<eos> Cops see dead bodies.<eos> That's okay.<eos> Yeah, I did.
Yeah.<eos> Yeah. Fired me the day that I was cleared.<eos> You miss it, huh?<eos> Most days.<eos> Yeah, I do.
Who's "they"?<eos> It's a matter of jurisdiction.<eos> Campus police handle student suicide.<eos> You understand.<eos> You don't.
I need some answers.<eos> I'm coming.<eos> I'm gonna be worse off now than I was before I started trying to achieve stuff.<eos> I know what it is to want things.<eos> No, you don't.
I'm sorry, Rob.<eos> - You know this won't work out.<eos> - That's a...<eos> - I don't know why you say that.<eos> - Yes, you do.
- We'll get off your train alright.<eos> - Got you, would everybody just relax?<eos> Why don't we take a seat?<eos> - I was just trying to help!<eos> - Don't.
Ah!<eos> Ooh!<eos> - Help!<eos> Help!<eos> - Don't...
Brakes is right.<eos> About what?<eos> - Money's too heavy.<eos> - We had to leave a sack in that drum.<eos> - You did what?
They don't understand this.<eos> Just gonna get you stable first, OK?<eos> You're gonna be OK.<eos> - I thought I lost you.<eos> - You did.
But when you're ready, I'm offering you shelter.<eos> Comfort. A safe harbor.<eos> As my wife.<eos> You must at least admire my persistence.<eos> I do.
- Why have you come back?<eos> - The strangest thing. I missed you.<eos> You don't seem very happy to see me.<eos> You said I was nothing to you.<eos> Did I?
How about a drink?<eos> How about your room?<eos> How the hell did they rob a bank?<eos> They'd have to have his...<eos> He did. They did.
How about your room?<eos> How the hell did they rob a bank?<eos> They'd have to have his...<eos> He did. They did.<eos> Someone did.
I get connected to a person or a place.<eos> It comes out of nowhere.<eos> It wraps its fingers around your heart and won't let go.<eos> Did you see something at the house?<eos> Yeah. Yeah, I did.
- Yes!<eos> Good.<eos> - Really!<eos> - I believe it.<eos> - No, you don't!
Giorgio, we've already broken up.<eos> Stop it!<eos> Don't you have the slightest...<eos> - It's me, you know, don't you?<eos> - Of course I do.
- For the scooter.<eos> The scooter is far off.<eos> But you promised!<eos> - We didn't promise a thing.<eos> - Dad did.
Look what I found in the drawers.<eos> Why are you wearing your grandmother's robe?<eos> - I had a shower and found it.<eos> - Take it off, it bothers me.<eos> - Why? - It just does...
I read about them in the paper.<eos> I memorize their names.<eos> 621 people.<eos> That's on me.<eos> Don't.
Am I right? Jack and I, anything goes.<eos> Church of Lesbyterian, dinner beneath the bridge, guided tour of site B, if you know where that is.<eos> Remember when you said we should and I was like, "I'm not gonna do that."<eos> - You said, "Go on, try it."<eos> - Did I?
I recall one time in the hospital, the third cycle of chemo, very weak, making my way down an endless hallway and a nurse comes up to me with a wheelchair.<eos> She said, "Mr Armstrong, would you care to sit down?"<eos> And I said, "Thanks, but no thanks."<eos> "I'm gonna walk."<eos> And I did.
Why don't I see a palace here?<eos> Or a throne?<eos> Or a crown? Or a...<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> I do.
It was very painful for everybody.<eos> - They started to shoot the movie without me, and I didn't know anything went on.<eos> And then Gary called me into his office one day and said that they had approached me originally, and then they'd shot, and they weren't happy with what they had, and would I consider doing it now?<eos> He thought I could do it.<eos> As long as I did the show in the daytime, and the movie at night.
Come.<eos> Stretch your arm slowly.<eos> Easy.<eos> Okay.<eos> You do this arm by yourself.
It'll be the first time it's ever been done on a pro athlete.<eos> If we get this, we'll have access to the biggest names in sports.<eos> LeBron, Durant, Blake Griffin.<eos> I've heard of this guy.<eos> He did D'Brickashaw Ferguson's knee, right?
That's-you haven't had an orgasm in a year?<eos> Come on, that's bullshit.<eos> Not even when you masturbate?<eos> Lainey, you've got to be kidding me!<eos> You don't mast-- Why not?
It would appear we've had a decrease in population.<eos> Did Mr. Healy not come by to take care of the apiary whilst I was gone?<eos> Yes, but he won't be able to do it next time.<eos> - Did Mr. Healy say that?<eos> - No, his daughter did.
I hope you hung up on him.<eos> Apparently the Lexin derivatives are toxic.<eos> Oh, shit.<eos> They expect us to retrieve them without spilling the beans.<eos> What sort of a feasibility study did they do?
Hey Jack, do you remember mouse?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Do you know where he is?<eos> I do.
Why would I do that?<eos> - So Jack could be free.<eos> Now, this is the ultimate sacrifice and I understand that... but did you think about him having a normal childhood?<eos> - But he had me.<eos> - Of course he did.
I hope you have a good fucking night too.<eos> Back in five.<eos> It's all under control, sir.<eos> Do I detect some frustration or doubt, Mr. Washington?<eos> How did you...
I saw him.<eos> He had on a mask.<eos> He had on a breathing mask.<eos> I believe you.<eos> I do...
I can't guarantee that.<eos> In Washington, 10 of the original 19 subpoenaed began their testimony before the House Un-American Activities Committee.<eos> Mr. Trumbo, raise your right hand.<eos> Do you solemnly swear the testimony you are about to give is the truth, the whole truth, nothing but the truth so help you God?<eos> I do.
And you each get five more jobs and five more writers and so on.<eos> To keep that going, we'd have to write every script in the business.<eos> Oh, Arlen, what a devious lad.<eos> So who wants to write a gorilla movie?<eos> Who doesn't?
For the record, you're Robert Rich?<eos> I am.<eos> I've been through the whole list, Ed. They're all hacks.<eos> And you wrote The Brave One?<eos> I did.
~ So, you're staying?<eos> ~ No, I've got things I need to do.<eos> ~ I don't like being here by myself. ~ Stop worrying.<eos> ~ You don't know what he's capable of.<eos> I do.
Uh, excuse me.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Sorry, but can I ask you a favor?<eos> Hey, you see anything?<eos> I do not.
Actually, no, I'd like a Modelo.<eos> Do you want a glass with that?<eos> No.<eos> Hey, is there karaoke tonight?<eos> No, we actually only do that on Thursday nights.
--Open the fuckin' door!<eos> Sir, I don't even know what you're talking--<eos> So you don't know what I'm talking about?<eos> No, sir, no.<eos> I do not.
Good, I hear brandy can get you into trouble.<eos> Who's Brandy?<eos> My mother's Brandy.<eos> I didn't think you had a mom named Brandy?<eos> I don't.
Um...<eos> I mean, I really shouldn't have done that.<eos> You shouldn't have.<eos> I wanted to.<eos> I did, too.
I'm not washing it.<eos> You know, Princesses don't know how to cook anyway.<eos> ♪ My love, love is beginning... ♪<eos> Do you remember how my first night on the job Was your Graduation day?<eos> ( sighs ) I do.
Well, the truth is, is...<eos> I've been seeing some doctors.<eos> Okay, this is taking too long. What Coach Beiste is trying to say is that she has cancer.<eos> - You have cancer?<eos> ! - No, I don't. - What?
She's talented.<eos> She's a senior.<eos> - Kurt, she hates me.<eos> - You don't know that.<eos> No, I do.
She's a senior.<eos> - Kurt, she hates me.<eos> - You don't know that.<eos> No, I do.<eos> All of those kids do, okay?
Yeah, and we can order pizza and root beer and have, like, a party.<eos> I'm s...<eos> Are-are you joining us?<eos> You want to win, don't you?<eos> Yes, we do!
I know that you can't levitate.<eos> That's everything?<eos> Don't you need anything?<eos> - What do you need band-aids for?<eos> - I don't.
So what is it that Julian sees in her that...<eos> He didn't see in me?<eos> Now. How should I know?<eos> Because you said that Mick asked him!<eos> - Did I? - Yes.
And only she has recorded them.<eos> And as long as I live, she will be the only one to sing them.<eos> The problem is, dear sir... my wife can't sing any more.<eos> Now do you understand?<eos> Do you?
Do you know what a M1 Abrams is?<eos> It's a type of tank.<eos> I could list like 50 types of tanks right now.<eos> When did I learn about tanks?<eos> I didn't.
- I've solved the case.<eos> We've got them all.<eos> I'll get her.<eos> Hello, Angela.<eos> Did you really?
So get on it, gentlemen.<eos> You have two weeks.<eos> Sir. Sir. Sir.<eos> We know right now. We know exactly what we wanna build.<eos> - We do?
You have two weeks.<eos> Sir. Sir. Sir.<eos> We know right now. We know exactly what we wanna build.<eos> - We do?<eos> - We do.
And not because I have feelings for the chef or anything, but I couldn't help but think, what if I did?<eos> It wouldn't be hard to tell the girls.<eos> There wouldn't be some complicated history that exists between us that we're never going to be able to move past.<eos> No, I get it, I get it.<eos> I do.
That was then.<eos> And this new version of me doesn't feel like being friends.<eos> With anyone.<eos> Hey, kiddo.<eos> How you doing?
And, you know, a quick fix isn't always such a bad thing.<eos> A pot cookie?<eos> Works every time.<eos> But what about all of the talk about how God helped you?<eos> He did, he does.
Your lame attempt to go undercover and stalk me more?<eos> We have a lot to catch up on.<eos> I don't know what to say.<eos> It's okay.<eos> No one does.
That makes sense.<eos> You think that's all it was, though?<eos> Did you maybe have a fear of commitment?<eos> Ow.<eos> Maybe we both do.
- Hi.<eos> Umm, I'm so sorry for not calling or anything.<eos> Brenna told me, but I just...<eos> After the other night, I didn't know what to say.<eos> I still don't.
I didn't know he had one of those either.<eos> None of that is in his file.<eos> His cousin is Fausto Alarcon.<eos> I don't know who that is.<eos> No one does.
Yeah.<eos> But we're safe here for the night.<eos> And our parents will definitely come and get us in the morning.<eos> I wonder if my mother even knows I'm missing.<eos> Of course she does.
According to Mertens.<eos> Who's Mertens?<eos> The man from the deep south who rides a billy goat at night.<eos> - Do you have speed?<eos> - Yes, I do.
You don't like me.<eos> That's just fine because I don't like you much either.<eos> But I do know what you're going through.<eos> You're overwhelmed. You're not sure what to do.<eos> You don't anything about me.
Bless you<eos> I want to say something to you.<eos> Yes tell me.<eos> Even I love someone as you did.<eos> So do it.
Minnie dosen't smoke a pipe.<eos> She rolls her own.<eos> "Red apple tobacco"<eos> but mi negro amigo, I think you already know this.<eos> Yeah I do, senor Bob.
Right down to his bare ass.<eos> Then I told him to start walkin'.<eos> I walked his naked ass for two hours, 'fore his cold collapsed him.<eos> - You never even knew my boy?<eos> - No he didn't!
I'm gonna' kill that fella' and turn my sister lose.<eos> Now do you have any reason why you'd want to interfere with me saving my sister from a hangman's rope?<eos> - No.<eos> - You don't.<eos> - No I don't.
What are those yachts?<eos> It's the final ordeal before letting you go and the hardest one.<eos> 15 days of vacation, just a couple, alone.<eos> - Didn't you read the leaflet?<eos> - I did.
You'd think so, wouldn't ya?<eos> Well, he was clearly upset by the whole thing.<eos> I think... I hope, anyway, that with a little time and space from the drama of it all, he'll come to his senses.<eos> You really think that's gonna happen?<eos> I do, actually.
You were just little.<eos> That's why you can't remember.<eos> Now that I'm grown up... you can tell me the truth.<eos> Do the monsters really exist?<eos> They did.
I think you don't need my dad's help to go into town.<eos> You, when you were a kid, did you know how to add and subtract?<eos> Well, not much.<eos> I tell you what, not much now neither.<eos> Well, I do.
Faces before names. You remember me?<eos> You remembered my face.<eos> Earlier, you rock up and flick water in my face.<eos> - You don't remember my face.<eos> - I do.
Sound good?<eos> That pot, there.<eos> Gentlemen, you're done.<eos> Finished.<eos> - Nearly done.
- I love him.<eos> Leaving his wife sobbing... You judge from the outside.<eos> What do you know?<eos> - I don't.<eos> - You do.
Uh-huh.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Well, what do you wanna do?<eos> You know, with the last few hours of life we've got left?<eos> I... I don't...
- lt took me months to get here.<eos> No one believes me.<eos> No one.<eos> You don't believe me either.<eos> I do now.
I can't stop now.<eos> Silence me.<eos> Because I can no longer live caged by your dead customs.<eos> Have you seen the light of love?<eos> I did, Hari.
He's got a great track record.<eos> He comes highly recommended.<eos> He has some very interesting ideas for new hires.<eos> Honestly, we're lucky to have him.<eos> How did you... Of all...
Jesus Christ, I'll never take a shit again.<eos> Evan, Evan, slow down.<eos> What's up now?<eos> Mike...<eos> He didn't...
Okay.<eos> We can't fight on an empty stomach<eos> Captain Yem said you would cover our compensation.<eos> What's with you?<eos> He did.
Not that we're aware of.<eos> And we've asked them to hold off questioning you until you're feeling more like yourself.<eos> Rachel, she...<eos> I don't remember.<eos> Yes, you do.
Well, in over your head, wearing two hats, the obvious things.<eos> And are you saying this because you don't want to move forward?<eos> Not at all.<eos> I'm sharing with you so you fully understand - what you're getting into.<eos> - And I do.
- Yep. Take that.<eos> Okay, if you want to visit Newton, I know he'd be happy to see you.<eos> Yeah, okay.<eos> We never finished Carniv? le, so if you want to finish the last two episodes...<eos> - I don't. No.
Yeah, okay.<eos> We never finished Carniv? le, so if you want to finish the last two episodes...<eos> - I don't. No.<eos> - You don't. Okay.<eos> - I don't.
Yeah... that's about how long it takes.<eos> I went to watch, at first.<eos> Because that's who I was... a spectator.<eos> And this kid, maybe 20, he had this look on his face... like this was one more thing he was gonna fail at.<eos> And he did.
You saved our lives!<eos> My white baby boy!<eos> You saved our lives!<eos> How did you know we were here?<eos> I didn't.
Mm-hmm.<eos> Um...<eos> No, I just...<eos> I think it's important.<eos> I do too.
We could be here till morning.<eos> What would you like me to say?<eos> Something truthful.<eos> You think I hate you... ..and you are right.<eos> I do.
No, Boss.<eos> Then write that.<eos> Write the truth.<eos> ~ If you insist, Boss.<eos> ~ I do.
We good?<eos> Okay, you know what?<eos> I don't... I don't...<eos> I don't want to be doing this crap any more than you do.<eos> I don't.
Just let her have some fun.<eos> I mean, but it's the I.C.U.<eos> We're gonna say something, right?<eos> No. She'll get all emotional and want to leave.<eos> They always do.
Quinn: Well, I am glad you liked it.<eos> I look forward to reading the new issue, hopefully this time with fewer surprises.<eos> [Chuckles] Oh. [Groans]<eos> I'm sure I don't want to know what that was about.<eos> Oh, no, you don't.
Come on, Rach.<eos> I was, um... in my sweatpants, under the covers, watching bad TV and eating ice cream.<eos> Which... wait a second...<eos> I had it delivered.<eos> Okay, I didn't...
When the dragon's away, the mice will play.<eos> My girls are moving on up.<eos> Really?<eos> Adam said that?<eos> He did.
It'll take a little groveling... my father, who ripped me in the press, stopped my mother and brothers from talking to me?<eos> I don't think so.<eos> All he wants is a respectable son, and this circus makes the whole family look bad.<eos> Oh, God. Did he send you?<eos> - So what if he did?
It is a family date.<eos> How did she even get here without my permission?<eos> Louise brought her to meet Adam.<eos> You want my daughter to meet this guy?<eos> Yeah, I do.
I'm honoring my promise.<eos> What about the promise that you made me?<eos> Or did you just sober up?<eos> Rachel, you mean everything to me.<eos> You do.
Oh, good God, Chet.<eos> You want me begging every time I get a boner?<eos> I'd be mauling you five times a day.<eos> You know who I am.<eos> Yes, I do.
Join the Peace Corps if you want, and see how that feels as your life.<eos> You know something?<eos> I just don't want to be a woman whose whole life is this.<eos> You may want to be Chet, but I don't want to be you, Quinn.<eos> Yeah, you do.
Adam... These people are vulgar.<eos> They will do anything they can to make a quick buck off us.<eos> And you'd willingly be a part of that?<eos> I... I'm sorry.<eos> I... I didn't...
Ow!<eos> And here's me, looking forward to this all morning.<eos> To what?<eos> You don't know what I'm talking about, do you?<eos> Of course I do.
- You heard.<eos> You have no idea what it's like to be me.<eos> Come on Matt, I didn't mean it like that.<eos> Uh-huh.<eos> Yes, you did.
Thanks for helping us.<eos> Erika created a perfect virus, but she never meant to hurt anyone.<eos> She just became obsessed.<eos> I don't think I understand that kind of obsession.<eos> I do.
Why? !<eos> Why what?<eos> You killed Ben.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, I did.
I really fucked up.<eos> Mom hates me.<eos> I don't think she hates you.<eos> I just think maybe...<eos> She does.
And...<eos> No, I'm sorry, Ross.<eos> Stop.<eos> Again, please, as if your future depended upon it.<eos> Or better yet, as if mine did.
We could go to that nice bookstore on 16th Street.<eos> Where's Daddy?<eos> Molly, you know why Daddy's not here.<eos> No, I don't.<eos> No, I don't.
I think they just wanted to do something nice.<eos> To make up for us not going to Washington.<eos> We're not invited to the White House?<eos> Gus, why?<eos> You didn't do anything wrong.
Three!<eos> I just wanted to say thank you for handling my, um, my problem.<eos> I never heard from that guy or the magazine again.<eos> You're welcome. I did what I had to do.<eos> You didn't...
For your 20th, it's meant to be China.<eos> Men should never pick out jewelry alone.<eos> Gus already has something kind of like this.<eos> Wally does, too.<eos> All the guys do.
We can all taste it.<eos> But we... we were family.<eos> I'm... I'm sorry.<eos> I... I should probably go.<eos> No, don't.
Hope you've got your speech prepared.<eos> I want to hear nice things about Kate on Saturday.<eos> So, I hear you don't want to go to the Crawley's lunch.<eos> I don't mind if you don't, but I wondered why.<eos> I just don't.
Look, there's the clock that she told us about.<eos> Do you play sports?<eos> I don't like sports.<eos> He used to.<eos> What do you do?
Needs a bit of warming up.<eos> What do you think?<eos> Do you think that we look alike, me and Reggie?<eos> Oh, yes, certainly.<eos> No, you don't.
- Do you know that?<eos> - Of course I do.<eos> Fucking surprise, that.<eos> So why don't we kill Jack now?<eos> Or we do Albie as well?
Is he hitting on you?<eos> Watch out.<eos> He always hits on the new ones.<eos> I know that.<eos> We all do.
Have you got one of Sarah's?<eos> - What do you care?<eos> - You didn't before.<eos> How do you know?<eos> - You didn't.
I love this song.<eos> No.<eos> Uh-huh. No. I don't dance.<eos> - Yes, you do.<eos> - Gwen, I don't.
But so many lost their lives, you know, and it's easy to see them as just an extension of Joe, but I don't even recognize that name--Sherry.<eos> The more I really think about it, there's only a handful of names that I do remember.<eos> Joe Carroll turned those people into killers.<eos> But their lives, their families should still matter.<eos> And they do.
It's like destiny that we were meant to meet.<eos> Do you believe in destiny, Evan?<eos> I'm an architect.<eos> So obviously I believe that things happen by your own design.<eos> Well, I do.
They believe hes everywhere.<eos> Everywhere?<eos> But cannot be seen?<eos> How do they know he exists?<eos> Maybe he doesn't.
This is our latest acquisition.<eos> I'd say, go ahead.<eos> Do you smoke?<eos> - No.<eos> From now on you do.
What happens next?<eos> Nothing.<eos> It stops here. - And now?<eos> How do you know this will work?<eos> I don't.
"I'm sorry"?<eos> That's completely unacceptable.<eos> I really like him, Dad!<eos> He does not love you!<eos> Yes, he does!
Like, 1,200 miles.<eos> Well, there you go.<eos> That's 1,200 miles between you and your love of your life.<eos> Because you love her, right?<eos> Yeah, I do.
I still can't believe she hasn't called.<eos> They probably don't have phones in Agloe.<eos> She has a cell.<eos> How do we know that she's even still in Agloe?<eos> I just do.
And I've never stopped loving you every single day since.<eos> You're not in love with me.<eos> Don't say that.<eos> You don't even know me.<eos> Yeah, I do.
It took me a long time to realize how wrong I was.<eos> And not just about Margo.<eos> I was wrong about a lot of things.<eos> I used to believe everyone gets a miracle.<eos> And I still do.
You see, he made these people unafraid.<eos> Everyone realized, like just about anything else in this life... the moment you stop fearing it, it loses all its power.<eos> The governor is a friend!<eos> The governor gave very specific instructions.<eos> - No, don't!
I've been headed here, like a freight train.<eos> I couldn't have known then where all this was gonna end up.<eos> I didn't know why he decided to come back.<eos> I didn't know then what he's running from .<eos> None of us did.
You know what, I'm sorry.<eos> Fuck.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> You want me to talk to Dad, I'll talk to Dad. Of course I will.<eos> Yeah, I do. I do.
Why wouldn't I believe that?<eos> It was my advice.<eos> Not only are Lennox and I on good terms, but she canceled that stupid trip to Colombia.<eos> I don't know how to thank you.<eos> Yeah, you do.
Come here.<eos> - You want to go upstairs?<eos> - I do.<eos> I think we deserve some fun time after all that hardcore parenting.<eos> Ooh, yes we do.
What was that for?<eos> Well, you know, I just wanted to thank you for the ring and...<eos> You know, sometimes, there are no words.<eos> Guess who delivers?<eos> I do.
- We can fight later.<eos> - No, no, no.<eos> Why would I want to fight with my thoughtful, wonderful husband?<eos> - You really mean that?<eos> - I do, of course I do!
- I'm starting a new...<eos> - There's nothing new about any of this.<eos> There's nothing new you can say.<eos> You don't have any compassion?<eos> I do.
Just for tonight, because I'm so sad.<eos> Move over, you silly woman.<eos> Hey, dude.<eos> Hey, did you know your uncle knows all about construction?<eos> No, I didn't.
Quite.<eos> I think we'll have to leave it.<eos> Do you have any female friends who speak English, Mrs Khatun?<eos> It might help for the examination next time.<eos> She doesn't.
Those of us who volunteered to move out and find private digs will be given a rent allowance.<eos> And I've put my name down.<eos> Oh, Delia, you don't want to end up in some filthy hole,<eos> ~ living cheek by jowl with a lot of students.<eos> ~ No, I don't.
I'm your fiance's daughter.<eos> Marlene Dooley, nee Buckle.<eos> You remember me?<eos> Yes!<eos> Yes, I do.
It needs to be done before tonight.<eos> Fred?<eos> We're too old to be silly about this, aren't we?<eos> Now either you like me... .. or you don't.<eos> I do.
Hey, guys, I was kidding, I've got a huge one.<eos> Like, I wasn't in either of those groups in high school.<eos> - I...<eos> - me either.<eos> - I, like, did my own thing.
You got to eat something before, bud.<eos> Sherry Cruz.<eos> Yeah, the one that got away.<eos> She doesn't know what she's missing, man.<eos> She really doesn't, man.
Guess who's just been promoted to point person on the She-donism party?<eos> What?<eos> Diana is giving up control?<eos> Annabelle wants a younger vibe.<eos> Of course she does.
What?<eos> Polly Pockets.<eos> So do I!<eos> It's too bad we don't have any here that we could play with.<eos> We do!
I had an inkling it might play well in the suburban book club crowd, so I sent it to one.<eos> After we agreed upon that strategy.<eos> E-exactly.<eos> I feel it's always good to keep a finger on the suburban pulse.<eos> Yes, she does.
Yeah, uh, maybe the "geh-nocchi"?<eos> Actually, it's pronounced "gnocchi."<eos> What?<eos> Why hasn't anybody ever told me this?<eos> 'Cause you do it so cute.
You cannot pay my interest.<eos> Tell me something..<eos> How is Pat" as a person ?<eos> He's fine. Didn't I tell you?<eos> You did?
Did you tell anyone about Harman?<eos> I never told anyone.<eos> Be honest, and I won't harm you.<eos> I said I didn't tell anyone...<eos> Yes, I did.
- Bye.<eos> Didn't Rod meet Kimmy here?<eos> And Tina.<eos> He had a thing for bottle service girls.<eos> Who the fuck doesn't?
Memo deleted.<eos> I fucking hope not.<eos> Do you solemnly that the testimony you are about to give is the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God.<eos> So help me God.<eos> Yes, I do.
I fucking hope not.<eos> Do you solemnly that the testimony you are about to give is the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God.<eos> So help me God.<eos> Yes, I do.<eos> - I do.
And then when the nausea passes, give them back to me.<eos> Okay.<eos> Before you go back there, you need to know, he may not look exactly the way you remember him.<eos> I don't want to see the body.<eos> I really don't, actually.
- Paddy...<eos> - I'm on it. Yep.<eos> I'll be right back.<eos> - Did you see that?<eos> - I did.
- That wasn't good for you?<eos> - Oh, Jesus.<eos> You know that I loved you so much.<eos> I loved you too.<eos> I still do. I do.
I love that you're gay.<eos> That's great.<eos> - Do you have a boyfriend?<eos> - No, not anymore.<eos> I did.
Even if it's not with me, you shouldn't...<eos> Be... done, Lynn.<eos> You like it?<eos> Yeah, dude.<eos> I do.
What is going on?<eos> Don't say that you have me, all right?<eos> You have me.<eos> And you have... you... Up till about 10 seconds ago, I was gonna say you have Lynn, but...<eos> Well, I didn't.
It's Halloween!<eos> Hey. You dressing up tonight?<eos> Does a bottom howl at the moon?<eos> I don't know what that means.<eos> Sure you don't.
- Seen it?<eos> - Yeah, I've got that.<eos> I will, uh, I'll just unfold it.<eos> You know, 'cause I slay Celine Dion.<eos> I really do.
You know, 'cause I slay Celine Dion.<eos> I really do.<eos> Don't I, babe?<eos> Oh my God. You do, yes.<eos> - Fuck yeah, I do.
- I didn't ask for help.<eos> You were the one who said you didn't want to get involved in any business dealing.<eos> Didn't you tell me that?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Then don't.
I mean, we got to do something.<eos> Even if it's just yelling at them... telling them that they're not gonna get away with this.<eos> But you know they are, right?<eos> Well, not if I have anything to do about it.<eos> But you sort of don't.
- That's good to hear.<eos> - Are you relieved?<eos> - I would have been if that idiot hadn't have mentioned something about how it can lead to, uh, bed-wetting.<eos> I'm just trying not to think about it.<eos> Good, don't.
No, I don't get it.<eos> Okay, look, you have to put our logo in the viewer.<eos> That's it, period.<eos> Mmm... Actually, I don't have to do a damn thing.<eos> - Yeah, you do.
Okay, look, you have to put our logo in the viewer.<eos> That's it, period.<eos> Mmm... Actually, I don't have to do a damn thing.<eos> - Yeah, you do.<eos> - No, I don't.
I bet we did.<eos> That's awesome.<eos> Well, we never actually breached his security.<eos> Remember we got Marc's login info and went through the front door?<eos> So, he didn't actually do anything wrong.
We don't enjoy all the freedoms that you have in China.<eos> All right? Where people smoke all the time.<eos> I don't smoke.<eos> Expt for special occasions.<eos> So you do smoke?
Good? It's the fucking best.<eos> This whole place is.<eos> You call this place and they don't know you, they pretend they don't speak English.<eos> You see a white face in here?<eos> No, you don't.
I am so happy that my uncle is dead.<eos> But I still don't believe it.<eos> You saw him killed.<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes I did.
There's no more pain.<eos> Go to sleep.<eos> Who are you?<eos> - You know who I am.<eos> - No, I don't.
We were talking about a failing colony, not a failed one.<eos> We also didn't have the most respected captain on the island standing in advocacy of our plan.<eos> Now we do.<eos> We didn't have the trade boss of the island actively working to reform operations then.<eos> Now we do.
- They have toilet paper.<eos> All right, all right, they have toilet paper.<eos> Let's not get bogged down.<eos> The idea is, they're buying these basic human necessities, with the exception of toilet paper... (chuckles) which they already have.<eos> Well, they do.
Not really, but you're totally missing the point.<eos> Of glasses?<eos> So how was your lunch with Tim?<eos> Oh, and by the way, you heard the "oh, no" thing.<eos> - I did.
Why?<eos> I don't want to confuse 'em.<eos> Or... we could make it less confusing.<eos> I have no idea what that means.<eos> What if we did this in, like, a more permanent way.
- I was.<eos> How could she do this to me?<eos> I know.<eos> Look, I know how you're feeling right now.<eos> No, you don't.
Be back soon.<eos> (Whimpers) I got to go.<eos> You know, I'm a writer too.<eos> Oh, no.<eos> No, I did not.
Hi.<eos> This is what happens when you take a guy's pants.<eos> So Eric went for the bugs.<eos> You like bugs?<eos> I really don't.
Matt was getting harassed, and he thought he was being followed.<eos> You fucking whore.<eos> How about you, Noah?<eos> You got a girlfriend?<eos> Matter of fact I do, yeah.
Franklin! You add to that the fact that we just about killed his little kid, you think this guy's gonna let us live?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, I-I do. What makes you so sure?<eos> Because I know him.<eos> No, you don't.
Then it would be...<eos> Both.<eos> Ah, well, that would work.<eos> Do you even know what you're doing?<eos> Of course I do.
Seeing as how you're in an underground dwarven citadel, it looks as if it has nested hinges, which are...<eos> - Oh...<eos> Brodie!<eos> - Told you they'd be okay.<eos> - No you didn't.
- I don't wanna hurt you.<eos> - It's easy. - Just do it.<eos> - Stop!<eos> - Come on! - Please, stop.<eos> - Do it.
It's all for librarians.<eos> Hey, something's wrong.<eos> Come on.<eos> You heard me.<eos> Well, I did.
Hey, why are you actin' so strangely?<eos> What's so important we gotta go over it...<eos> You killed Spangler.<eos> - What?<eos> - Didn't you?
I should have sent them to the country.<eos> Liz wouldn't have let them go.<eos> Anne cried every time you were away.<eos> Did she?<eos> Anne did?
Seems like a good time to be with other people.<eos> - Says the guy who ran away to Thailand.<eos> - Zoe, my family is your family.<eos> - You need family right now.<eos> We all do. - Griffin, I...
All you need is love.<eos> I get that now.<eos> You write that all by yourself?<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Yeah. Oh, I do! I do!
I get that now.<eos> You write that all by yourself?<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Yeah. Oh, I do! I do!<eos> I do! I do!
What do you want to see?<eos> Or maybe... you can show me.<eos> Show you what?<eos> What you people have.<eos> What my family on the island doesn't.
You may be in the safest place<eos> - They had no right to punish me.<eos> Doesn't Michael say that the true path<eos> - is always righteous?<eos> - That, he does.
The skeptics, of course.<eos> If we're going to rebuild, there can be no interference.<eos> We can easily expel them from the abbey.<eos> If you think that's best.<eos> You don't?
It was Alan.<eos> What happened?<eos> I shot him.<eos> That doesn't make any sense.<eos> Love rarely does.
Like Michael?<eos> Mycosis spreading through bees...<eos> Even Ilaria can't control nature.<eos> - Can't you see that I don't have a choice?<eos> - You do.
"Deliver Marta Ochoa safe and sound... or your family is next."<eos> Signed, "Death to Kidnappers."<eos> Please! Please, let me go.<eos> - Hurry up!<eos> - Please, don't!
All you guys having a good time?<eos> You gotta let it go, man.<eos> There's good that came out of this.<eos> Yeah, we used him, then we got him killed. No, we didn't kill him...<eos> Escobar did.
"Where have you been, son?" I would yell out.<eos> "In the mountains, Mama."<eos> "Higher than the clouds, Auntie," Gustavo would say, laughing.<eos> He... He always wanted to go farther.<eos> He always did. But with you.
It was the closest we'd ever come to him, and we never felt further away.<eos> All right, then.<eos> Let me hand over my gun.<eos> - You won.<eos> - We both did.
All right?<eos> They call it "the sweet tea."<eos> - Oh, really? - Mm-hmm.<eos> All these things have names?<eos> Yes, they do, son, all of them...
- Mm-hmm.<eos> Junior.<eos> Junior.<eos> You see what's going on here?<eos> I do.
Look at Britney and K-Fed, Sid and Nancy, Ruby and Earl.<eos> Never heard of Ruby and Earl?<eos> They're the fiery couple who made my childhood miserable... my parents.<eos> When these two loved each other, they loved each other.<eos> But when they didn't, whoo!
I've never bought you a fake purse.<eos> - Dre.<eos> - Hmm?<eos> You know that "Chanel" has one "N," right?<eos> - I do now.

Savannah!<eos> I've never heard of you before.<eos> The coven doesn't tell you anything.<eos> They're not your family, they don't care.<eos> But I do.
Aleister: An assassination attempt.<eos> Of course you'd have to try.<eos> What good are you as a werewolf if you don't?<eos> I should not have survived in the first place.<eos> But I did.
She is no longer in your mind.<eos> They want to control me.<eos> If you tear your bed apart, you'll just have to sleep on the floor.<eos> What do you care?<eos> I don't.
We have a baby on the way...<eos> No. He's our son, Rachel.<eos> It's too late!<eos> What do you mean?<eos> No, no, you didn't...
You shouldn't have to pay for my addiction.<eos> How did it go?<eos> It was hard.<eos> He didn't take it well.<eos> You did the right thing.
I mean, I must be.<eos> Because you're always right.<eos> I can't believe this.<eos> I think I'm in love with you, too.<eos> I really do.
They're doing a bit.<eos> Sorry, that was just a joke.<eos> Do you guys want to do something a little fun?<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> I do, I do.
So, from now on, Waitress...<eos> I promise to be nice and true.<eos> I have a name.<eos> Do you want the ring or not?<eos> I do, yes.
You've really earned this.<eos> You've been living in Mom's house, taking care of her all these years.<eos> Which was so noble of you.<eos> - I don't know how you did it.<eos> I really don't.
I just hope you got mine.<eos> Hey, I wanna tell you something.<eos> You don't have to marry Marco.<eos> - I know that.<eos> - No, you don't.
So, come on down to the basement and you can check this out.<eos> Okay, so, uh, watch your step on the stairs here.<eos> Wouldn't want you to trip on any old paint cans or anything like that, but hopefully everything down here, you know, has been properly painted and put where it's supposed to be.<eos> So, you know what I'm saying?<eos> No, I don't.
We always pass, okay?<eos> We never have a hard time passing.<eos> It's not a big deal.<eos> Nobody gives a shit.<eos> You didn't do anything that special.
None.<eos> It's not private.<eos> I've gotten no girls pregnant except for you now.<eos> I think you're behaving very magnanimously this time.<eos> I really do.
- Are we scared? - No! - Are we scared?<eos> - No!<eos> Who are we?<eos> I don't know either.<eos> - I don't.
Okay.<eos> All right, well, I thought I'd just check.<eos> I'll make the call.<eos> You don't have to.<eos> Yeah, I do.
No, they don't.<eos> Jimmy's right -- I left.<eos> After my mom died, I was the parent, and I left.<eos> Well, you felt trapped.<eos> Of course you did.
Good.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I would have mailed you your cup, but I didn't know where you were.<eos> Well, you knew I'd be back.<eos> No, I didn't.
Hmm, well, because three is meaningful to everyone.<eos> I say three, and you're impressed because you have three kids.<eos> Wait, now.<eos> How do you know I have three kids?<eos> I don't.
But it's him!<eos> He's a freak and he's got my son involved in all this weird shit.<eos> Frank. Listen to the sheriff.<eos> We'll handle it.<eos> How did you...?
They're all fresh when they come out of the molds... and then I make them suffer.<eos> Some people think that's what life is.<eos> Born fresh to suffer.<eos> Do you think that?<eos> Uh... I did.
At the very least.<eos> I'm sorry, this is a fascinating narrative... but I don't see it's much help to us.<eos> It's the hidden language of the demon.<eos> It must have a purpose.<eos> Not everything does.
This is but one evening.<eos> Mr. Gray is being a proper host to a new guest, that's all.<eos> You're smarter than that, Miss Ives.<eos> I wanted her to have life.<eos> Now she does.
Without Mina.<eos> Without you, even.<eos> But when he settles down, he'll come around.<eos> He won't forget about you.<eos> I certainly didn't.
- Yes.<eos> - You saw her grow into the fine young woman she is?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yeah. You watched her rather carefully, I'd say.<eos> Did I?
What things you must do here.<eos> So much empty space to fill up with your...<eos> adventures.<eos> But you like adventures.<eos> Who doesn't?
And as always, when we accidentally end up doing Loose Animal in the Studio, we have to show you this disclaimer.<eos> Boring!<eos> Here's a disclaimer, I didn't read this disclaimer.<eos> Ooh, good point.<eos> Okay. Done.
Look, I've tried. I just can't focus enough to read a book.<eos> They're so boring.<eos> I mean, 30 seconds after I crack it open, I'm sound asleep.<eos> You know exactly what I mean, right, Laurie?<eos> I don't.
- Betty.<eos> Di-Betty, I mean, diabetes...<eos> Which I hope you don't have.<eos> I-I made pie.<eos> Well, no, I don't.
We're gonna find Mona and we're gonna get out of here tonight.<eos> How?<eos> Did you guys know that, um<eos> I won an Etch A Sketch contest when I was in the third grade?<eos> Of course, you did.
The world's very cruel, Master.<eos> It laughs at your pain.<eos> You cause the heart-beats of everyone to run faster.<eos> Why do You increase the difficulties of the public?<eos> They do 50 different kinds of drama.
Come on.<eos> Fucking hell, man.<eos> What the fuck?<eos> ! Where did you learn to drive?<eos> Maybe I didn't.
Um... I mean, it doesn't make for a good employee.<eos> Like, I read a horrible article this morning about this woman getting stoned in Iran for adultery, and it seriously made me so upset that I've folded this laundry, like, four times already.<eos> Emotional equals unproductive, I guess.<eos> - I like getting stoned.<eos> - Who doesn't?
Because you have nothing to say!<eos> S-s-s-s-s-son of a b-b-bitch!<eos> To a meal well done.<eos> You have embraced your new general with dignity.<eos> Not really, but you did well, anyway.
Beware of overeating.<eos> Well, this is disappointing.<eos> You've got the poulet à la crème.<eos> I didn't know what that was.<eos> And... I still don't.
- Ohhh, correct! - Whoo-hoo!<eos> And now, we takin' back a little thing called... reparations.<eos> You sure you want to get into the ring with me?<eos> - Oh, okay!<eos> - What if she do?
But you still didn't use it.<eos> 'Cause my wishes weren't about being smarter.<eos> They were about being normal.<eos> I mean, I didn't want to not be smart.<eos> I just didn't...
I have a very strong sense that this is the night they announce their retirement.<eos> I've been wondering the same thing.<eos> Of course, I'm not psychic.<eos> Oh, honey, you don't know that.<eos> No. I do.
I... didn't know how to handle it.<eos> Well, good job picking the worst way imaginable.<eos> Some things there's no good way to do.<eos> How do I tell the woman I've loved for 40 years that I can't be with her - if I want to be happy.<eos> - You don't.
Hey, you got any ideas?<eos> Look, changed the carb. Changed the battery. Changed all the ignition shit.<eos> I still can't get it to turn over.<eos> What about the cap and rotor?<eos> - Did you?
Hey, I danced with you one time.<eos> No!<eos> - I don't think so.<eos> - No, no. We did.<eos> We totally did.
Why would I be pissed?<eos> I didn't lie.<eos> I never sent you to that warehouse.<eos> You put a note on my car.<eos> No, I didn't.
It's so violent.<eos> Life is violent.<eos> It is.<eos> I didn't think so before.<eos> But you do now.
Okay, the only thing you really need to know about me... Is that Tequila makes me want to fight... And cheap wine makes me want to fuck.<eos> I'm sure the lives of many brave young men were lost... In the refinement of that elegant theorem.<eos> I love you. Oh.<eos> Find everything you were looking for today?<eos> Uh, yeah, yeah, we did.
Well, he's Peter hemmings or whoever... So I'm sure he doesn't travel anywhere without his trusty team of apologists.<eos> Right.<eos> Yeah, I know, not your fault.<eos> Yeah, um, you get service out here?<eos> No, I don't.
I'm tired, okay?<eos> You're all tired out, because it's special shit all of a sudden?<eos> Pretty townie chick, out and about.<eos> I don't want to do this tonight.<eos> Yeah, what, 'cause you already did some of that la fag?
Well, good.<eos> I can't imagine how much your prayers and your passion for God must have meant to your husband.<eos> Gosh, I wish I could've met him.<eos> No.<eos> No, you don't.
Where are you?<eos> The police are on their way.<eos> Please don't hurt her!<eos> Emma, the police are coming.<eos> She didn't do anything.
Then I'm going inside and I'm gonna slowly gut your boss and his "Little House on the Prairie" niece.<eos> I don't think so.<eos> Nola.<eos> - Let me die.<eos> - You already did.
- No, you don't.<eos> You had someone in that building with you.<eos> And you two weren't performing some remote hack on some of the most advanced security systems on the market while rappelling from the roof, so by my count, that adds up to three guys not counting Mr. Rabbit.<eos> What, do you think I work for some criminal mastermind that goes around calling himself Mr. Rabbit?<eos> Yes, I do. Yes, I do!
I think we should, uh, maybe not tell anyone about our little secret yet.<eos> Oh, baby, don't worry about it.<eos> I am a very private person.<eos> You know that.<eos> I do.
- 3.<eos> - 3?<eos> Were you taught by your mother?<eos> No.<eos> Our Maester Cressen did.
- Thanks.<eos> I can't have children.<eos> Oh, well don't worry.<eos> Some people try for 10 years until they can have kids.<eos> And others never do.
Time was a source of terror.<eos> But in here, every moment spent free of that man is a gift.<eos> But... why are you here?<eos> Because I put rat poison in his bibimbap and killed the motherfucker.<eos> She did her husband, too.
- You got it?<eos> - I got this aisle.<eos> They're stuck behind something.<eos> How do you know?<eos> I don't.
I'm sure it looks like we haven't lost much, but we have.<eos> We've lost things.<eos> Other things we're just fighting like hell to hold on to.<eos> Everything you people have been through, I don't know if you see that.<eos> We do.
We are not... Executing anyone.<eos> Don't ever suggest it again.<eos> That sort of thinking doesn't belong in here.<eos> People die now, deanna.<eos> They do.
Stop it.<eos> Your brother felt he was apart from it.<eos> He was a part of it.<eos> He didn't deserve to be here.<eos> - You don't!
Who was Roger's killer?<eos> Dad!<eos> You threatened Roger with great bodily harm when he insulted me at dinner, a detail you conveniently left out when Agent Moretti and I interviewed you.<eos> - He has Alzheimer's.<eos> - Not here he doesn't.
Does anybody find it strange that Celia and Alice were never in the same room at the same time?<eos> And do any of you find it as interesting as I do that Celia is an anagram of Alice?<eos> [Scoffs] That doesn't prove anything.<eos> No, it doesn't.<eos> But this does.
- Your story makes sense.<eos> - Of course it does.<eos> Devil's advocate, like the cop said, the Kettlemans' cars are still at their house.<eos> No record of them leaving. How'd they get out of the country?<eos> They didn't.
You'd verify the documents and he wouldn't have to do anything else.<eos> Well, it didn't work out that way, did it?<eos> Oh, I'm sorry, Nicki. I'm just...<eos> I'm ti... I'm just tired.<eos> Bill did nothing wrong.
But he seems pretty harmless. Corey something.<eos> I don't know his last name.<eos> Does he know your last name?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, he does.
There's no more waiting until marriage.<eos> These kids are hooking up with strangers they met on a phone app.<eos> Why buy the cow when you can get the milk for free?<eos> That's not happening to Hayley.<eos> So what do you do...
Yeah...<eos> belongs to Boz Shepherd.<eos> Did you happen to see who was driving it today?<eos> You want me to say it was Boz.<eos> And what if I did?
How's he doing?<eos> Doctor said he's gonna be all right.<eos> You really love him?<eos> He's an idiot most of the time, but... yeah.<eos> I do.
now he's back out there.<eos> Because he didn't do it.<eos> You know, I thought we had each other's back.<eos> Yeah, same team for the first time.<eos> I did.
No big deal.<eos> What was her name?<eos> Michie.<eos> I like that name.<eos> - You do?
I mean, I've caused you nothing but problems since I got here, so I get it.<eos> Pretty much.<eos> Fuck.<eos> - Why do you even care?<eos> - I just do.
All right?<eos> I mean...<eos> I guess you could call him honest.<eos> But I fucking hated him for it.<eos> I still do.
It's one thing to make yourself miserable, but you're making everyone around you miserable, too.<eos> Now, I'm telling you for the last time-- take the cap off.<eos> Oh!<eos> Really?<eos> What if I don't?
Shall we go?<eos> I'd hate to be unprofessional.<eos> I never said...<eos> We have our own ways of working.<eos> Yes, we do.
- Okay, I'll call you later.<eos> Goodbye.<eos> - Take care.<eos> Brother, finally you lied.<eos> - No. I didn't.
Ye happen to run into the rightful king across the water, you tell him Angus Mhor sends his best, eh?<eos> King James is in Italy, ye fool, no France.<eos> No, I meant if ye go...<eos> I meant if ye go to Italy!<eos> Yer arse, ye did.
Split even or nothing.<eos> I may need one more day to set up the deal.<eos> You know someone?<eos> I found a place.<eos> A job we did in West Ham.
Do you like to sail?<eos> - I love to sail.<eos> - I do, too.<eos> I think we're going to be very happy, you and I.<eos> I do, too.
I want you to be my wife.<eos> Now.<eos> What is it?<eos> Do you want to marry me because our families arranged it?<eos> Or do you--
You will try to help her?<eos> I'll do everything I can to win her freedom and her brother's.<eos> Your happiness is all I want in this world.<eos> - I know.<eos> - No, you don't.
But men worshipped here long before him.<eos> Who carved this altar?<eos> - Do you know?<eos> - I'm afraid I don't.<eos> No one does.
I don't fight for the crows.<eos> We're not here to fight.<eos> We're here to talk.<eos> Is that right?<eos> You and the pretty crow do a lot of talking, Tormund?
All interviews.<eos> Even talk show interviews.<eos> Fuck Phil Donahue.<eos> I just don't understand why nobody tells you how bad it's gonna be in the real world.<eos> Yeah, they do.
Send the old guy out to find a pay phone.<eos> Is that it?<eos> I just bought you five minutes.<eos> I want a lawyer.<eos> - No, you don't.
- It's a birthday card.<eos> So you make the husband as the doer?<eos> I do indeed.<eos> Not seeing a whole lot of evidence.<eos> Well, domestic homicide, you usually don't.
That little, um... escapade.<eos> We were just mucking about.<eos> Uncle Lance said you never take it up the bum.<eos> (LAUGHS) Oh, my God!<eos> ADAM: He did.
Sorry.<eos> He's fit.<eos> I can see why you chased after him.<eos> Except Lance ended up getting slaughtered.<eos> Right, I didn't... Um...
I... will take Matt with me, get him a plot in Simi Valley.<eos> And you get to decide that?<eos> Yes.<eos> - We need to talk.<eos> - No. No, we don't.
She's holding on to her life.<eos> That's what's happening.<eos> And you want to talk about whether she was raped,<eos> - whether she wasn't raped.<eos> - Yes, I do.
Insight the first, you ain't afraid to put yourself out there.<eos> And insight the second, you believe in the real America...<eos> Freedom, self-sufficiency.<eos> I do. I...<eos> I really do.
Who the hell wouldn't?<eos> I... I find it inappropriate for a person suffering from a physical condition.<eos> Anyone who's spent more than a few minutes with me knows that this isn't some kind of delusion.<eos> Wouldn't you agree, Kim?<eos> Of course she does.
Why would she do that?<eos> I think she...<eos> Sometimes it just gets to be too much, you know?<eos> Oh, I know.<eos> 'Course you do.
Not great.<eos> Really?<eos> Why not?<eos> I thought you said I had, autonomy, when it comes to academics here.<eos> - You do.
Snapper fish for the man.<eos> Actually, our fish supplier had an incident at their facility, so we are limited on fish.<eos> Market price is quite high today.<eos> Do you have the snapper or not?<eos> Yeah, uh, we do.
- Mm-hmm? - "Show me."<eos> So just give me the answer, and then I'll say sh...<eos> You know what, go ahead and do it.<eos> Just go ahead and do it, then.<eos> - Do what?
All he needed was an introduction to Lobos.<eos> Oh, shit.<eos> He asked to come to the Lobos meet.<eos> He wanted me to take him.<eos> Of course he did.
You had your reasons, Tommy, for not telling me.<eos> Don't make it any less true, right?<eos> Right?<eos> Well, now you know everything.<eos> Do I?
It's like sometimes those guys make me do things that aren't really me, you know?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Like, okay, like, I kind of feel compelled to call you a bird right now and throw my glass of water in your face.<eos> But, uh, you know, I'm realizing that I only do that stuff 'cause I don't want the guys to do it to me first, you know what I mean?<eos> Of course I do.
So, you know, just... all right?<eos> Yeah, I'm s... sorry.<eos> Okay. Do you want one, or...?<eos> No.<eos> I... don't.
No, no.<eos> Please.<eos> We're trying to show Bill that life is worth living.<eos> Your dad loves you.<eos> No, he doesn't.
Oh.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Has he not said it?<eos> Because I'm telling you, he just...<eos> He does. No.
Uh, turns out that Mac's dad didn't kill the guy.<eos> No, there was another man in on this.<eos> Yeah, it's gonna look really bad if I rat on this man Eduardo Sanchez, so I can't say his name.<eos> Uh...<eos> You just did.
You, too.<eos> Moore, hey. Um...<eos> This isn't a date, but I have some warm beer in my locker, and I was wondering if you wanted to get it...<eos> Hell yeah!<eos> - Okay. - I do.
It's funny.<eos> No? Okay, what's up, dov?<eos> You don't talk to me for months, And now you want to be my friend?<eos> Actually, no, i don't.<eos> No? You don't?
And sometimes that's all you can hope for.<eos> [ footsteps depart ] [ door opens ] bill: Gail.<eos> They're ready for you.<eos> Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, And nothing but the truth, so help you god?<eos> I do.
Hi.<eos> Your phone's off. I know.<eos> I was in court. What are -- is everything okay?<eos> Nick, how did you know that this was my car?<eos> I didn't.
Oh, yeah? Taking a train to vancouver?<eos> I'm not taking the train.<eos> Look, i only told you about the offer to give you an out.<eos> Giving me an out. I don't want an out.<eos> I never did, okay?
So, now that we're alone, we should talk, because I'm pretty sure I know what's going on with you.<eos> I saw this test mixed into Lemon's folder, and...<eos> I don't know... What you're talking about.<eos> Nope.<eos> I do not.
Don't follow politics.<eos> Well, uh, perhaps you remember a-a certain sack against Florida State in the champ...<eos> Two Super Bowls?<eos> I prefer baseball.<eos> Oh, who doesn't, really?
Please open up!<eos> Can-can we talk?<eos> Have you, uh, seen zoe?<eos> Is she all right? She's upstairs sleeping, If you want to wait.<eos> Yeah. Yeah, i do.
You sure are.<eos> That prick firing you?<eos> Best-case scenario is my two-year plan just became a ten-year plan.<eos> That schmuck.<eos> You didn't do anything wrong.
- Do you have news about our case?<eos> - I do, in fact.<eos> But before we get to the nitty-gritty, I think we should chat about your deal.<eos> We told you, there will be no deal.<eos> You did, didn't you?
Put it in the top of your stocking.<eos> Hold it with your garter.<eos> Never take it off, even when you sleep.<eos> Do you ken how to use a knife?<eos> Yes, I do.
No, no thanks. Cause I'm not gonna kill ya<eos> Fucks<eos> What's going on out there Mike?<eos> Backup's here<eos> How you doing doc?
Her final words, what were they?<eos> She said that you would come for me.<eos> There would be nowhere I could hide.<eos> She didn't deserve to die.<eos> No, she didn't.
Don't you fucking move.<eos> You just still see the bad we did.<eos> I see the good.<eos> No.<eos> I don't.
You don't care about Robert.<eos> You wanted to sideline me.<eos> So you actually think you have a shot at this office?<eos> Yes, I do.<eos> And so does the leadership.
Okay, can we just...?<eos> Okay.<eos> Hey, wait a minute, what is that?<eos> No, no, no, you need this.<eos> No, I don't.
If you--<eos> If you just let me do you, you know, like a lady.<eos> No!<eos> No!<eos> If you do, then--
Father.<eos> You know something.<eos> What do you know about Juan Cerboni, Lucio's mother's ex boyfriend?<eos> I recognise evil when I see it.<eos> We all did.
Well, I wasn't after your job, if that's what you thought.<eos> I wasn't worried about you taking my job.<eos> Then what?<eos> You knew how shaky things were at home for her.<eos> We all did.
Schweikart is throwing softballs. And he's gonna keep on throwing them over and over.<eos> We'll be busy swatting them away we'll never spend time on the actual case.<eos> This case will span years.<eos> And we don't have the capital to carry it forward by ourselves.<eos> We simply don't.
What are you talking about?<eos> There's an office in Santa Fe with your name on it.<eos> Or there could be.<eos> And you'd be working on your case.<eos> I don't even...
But we keep it in our back pocket.<eos> Michael Corrigan?<eos> They're going to release him when we visit.<eos> You made a miracle happen.<eos> We did.
I think it's about respect.<eos> And you're not respecting his pain.<eos> - His pain doesn't matter.<eos> - How can you say that?<eos> Because mine doesn't either.
It took me years to realize that that doesn't make... them any less.<eos> It actually made them more, because we're human beings, and we all make mistakes.<eos> You know?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I do.
How many you think lunch will give us? Hmm?<eos> I've lived here my whole life, I've never once been in this place.<eos> Hey, Gary, how are you, man?<eos> Played here last weekend with Judge Walters.<eos> Of course you did.
Get a load of those two, the dread on their faces?<eos> - Jesus.<eos> - (scoffs) I know.<eos> Uh, I feel there's something I want to share with you.<eos> - You do?
- Jesus.<eos> - (scoffs) I know.<eos> Uh, I feel there's something I want to share with you.<eos> - You do?<eos> - Yeah, I do.
- Okay.<eos> Hannah: Excuse me?<eos> Could we get two best "friendulum" piercings, please?<eos> (snorts) Who wants to go first?<eos> She does.
You were gone when we woke up.<eos> - I know.<eos> - I have been calling you for 45 minutes.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> I did not...
Hi! - Oh, my gosh, this place looks amazing.<eos> - Doesn't it look great?<eos> Yeah. How are you?<eos> - I heard you got the flu or something.<eos> - Ugh, I did.
Hey, after that interview,<eos> I'm happy to let the music do the talking.<eos> I gotta say, I'm still really disappointed about that Jade St. John concert. I wish we could go...<eos> Mom, I told you, I already had plans.<eos> Yes, you did.
I just...<eos> I just don't want it ripping' you apart.<eos> Tell you...<eos> I wish I'd never told anybody.<eos> Well, you did.
Hey, listen, I know this is last-minute, but Rayna had to bow out unexpectedly, and I was hoping you might fill in.<eos> Everything all right?<eos> I'm not at liberty to say.<eos> Teddy, I, uh... I know about Deacon.<eos> - You do?
Oh, I'm out the game.<eos> Come on, man.<eos> Please. I'm in a dark place.<eos> Just... Tell me what you love.<eos> I don't... ohh.
You've seen it before, but you can't remember where, right?<eos> Something like that.<eos> You've got the ring of the Magi!<eos> - No!<eos> - Yes, you do!
It helps to talk.<eos> There's a rumour going around school that I'm a witch and that Grey House is haunted.<eos> Did that help?<eos> No.<eos> It didn't.
Because I'm married.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> It's okay.<eos> I understand.<eos> You don't.
I'll be asleep.<eos> Well then... I'll be going.<eos> - No buzzer?<eos> - I used it.<eos> - You did?
You know me. I'm not like that. I follow my route.<eos> I'm not bragging.<eos> In all these years, ifs never been that tough.<eos> And, to be honest, the opportunity never arose. Bu!<eos> if it did...
I'm not bragging.<eos> In all these years, ifs never been that tough.<eos> And, to be honest, the opportunity never arose. Bu!<eos> if it did...<eos> If I! did...
- Of course. Loads of times.<eos> Loads of times?<eos> Of course I lie. Don'!<eos> you?<eos> Well I do.
I think... because he lost control in the window, he feels ashamed.<eos> But more than that, he...<eos> he survived and his men died and he feels responsible.<eos> ~ That makes no sense.<eos> ~ But it does to him.
Thank you.<eos> How are you?<eos> I know everyone's a bit shaken up.<eos> Oh. I'm almost scared to walk home tonight.<eos> Then don't.
Everything but a bell goes off when they smell fresh meat.<eos> Tell Spencer to cut this embargo crap before it's too late.<eos> Have you forgotten what it feels like to be in a cage for something you didn't do?<eos> Do you remember how that felt?<eos> Yes, I do.
That building, where the student union is, that's the original college. Founding father Eustace Ballard laid the first brick of foundation himself.<eos> I can show you a plaque carved in wood from Mr. Ballard's outhouse.<eos> Okay.<eos> Did I mention Ballard was also a minister?<eos> Yeah, you did.
Depends on what?<eos> Chunky chocolate, Taffy bits, marshmallows?<eos> You... you don't know if you like that stuff?<eos> - I know I do.<eos> - Course you do.
Then be careful I don't bite you.<eos> That is the second time you have struck me.<eos> There will not be a third.<eos> Do you really have to go?<eos> I do.
I hope you're wrong.<eos> We can't reject the truth when it is revealed.<eos> He's insisting that we move him somewhere safer.<eos> He knows where I am.<eos> Who does?
- Drop your weapon!<eos> - Put your weapon down!<eos> - Put your weapon down!<eos> - Captain.<eos> Do it!
They will find him.<eos> Yeah?<eos> They will take care of him.<eos> That is their job.<eos> And what if they don't?
Is that why you've done it all in the first place?<eos> - Was that your game?<eos> - Hey, this isn't a game.<eos> I got feelings for you, Harry. As much as just said so as did you about me.<eos> I certainly didn't.
He doesn't know, but look, maybe Aldo stole it.<eos> But Gino came here honestly.<eos> He's a good man.<eos> He has a family, a job, you know?<eos> He didn't do no wrong.
I don't know.<eos> I met her only briefly.<eos> Hanne is clever.<eos> I don't know if she understands Saga.<eos> - Who does? - I do.
Well... because I have a favor to ask.<eos> Uh-huh. As both of you know, I've been stressing out about the reopening of Fancie's, particularly the menu.<eos> And I was hoping, as my closest friends, that you'd be willing to come over this evening for a sample meal.<eos> Hmm. I knew she wanted something.<eos> Yeah, of course she did.
Oh, Robert, come on.<eos> Shoo!<eos> You're not allowed to see.<eos> They don't want me here.<eos> Of course they do!
There must be a better place somewhere.<eos> What else could make sense of this child's torment?<eos> I'm a vet, Doc.<eos> Re-upped after 9/11.<eos> A lot of cops did.
I can't stay here.<eos> You understand?<eos> Do your fucking job.<eos> I got things to do.<eos> Don't we all?
Maddie. She's pretty.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> - She gets that from her mother, obviously.<eos> Didn't tell me you guys had a suspect.<eos> We don't.
It's you and me against the world, little one.<eos> Why don't you take her along with you?<eos> Single girls with babies aren't exactly a good look.<eos> You don't know that until you get there.<eos> Yes, I do.
I love perfume.<eos> I'm kidding.<eos> Spacex, right?<eos> You really think he's going to Mars?<eos> Uh, yeah. Yeah, I totally do.
She says all these tiny things that, you know, says massive stuff, and... .. and I think she really liked me and all.<eos> Wow...<eos> What did you say to her?<eos> ~ What happened?<eos> ~ You did.
But I believe a man who can convince harvey To hire someone who never went to law school Could convince him to make an exception for this.<eos> What?<eos> He didn't tell you I know.<eos> No, he didn't.<eos> Well, I do.
Donna, I can't have him risking our other business.<eos> It was one client, and you covered it.<eos> And if he drags this to trial, It will be every client.<eos> - You don't know that.<eos> - Yes, I do.
All right.<eos> Good night.<eos> Bon voyage.<eos> You do know that doesn't mean "good night."<eos> Of course I do.
You can't pretend this didn't happen.<eos> Look, I know you're frustrated.<eos> No, you don't know, about me, how I feel.<eos> You treat me like I'm some fucking puzzle to be solved.<eos> - I don't.
He looks after me.<eos> Do you know this man, Kieran Reilly?<eos> He's also been living rough.<eos> No.<eos> No, I don't, no.
- He won't have them.<eos> "Shane looks after me." Shane's his problem. If we could get him to talk... If we push him now,<eos> Shane's toy solicitor is only gonna scream "undue pressure".<eos> Let's wait and see, and if Kieran wakes up, there's your witness.<eos> What if he doesn't?
He got Kieran like this by the throat and then he threw him down, and he didn't hurt him, not so much.<eos> A bit, yeah, but it was me that kicked him. I did it, and I knew I'd hurt him badly. But I just thought that if... if he was out, he could go to the hospital or something, get help.<eos> So I helped him over the wall, but I didn't wanna kick him.<eos> I know you didn't.<eos> So why did you?
He'll know if what I say is true.<eos> Who is your mother?<eos> Aethra from Troezen.<eos> How do you know my mother, Medea?<eos> I don't.
There's no law against that.<eos> It makes it considerably more difficult for us to exert pressure.<eos> So... let's begin with the one name we DO know.<eos> Jonathan Tresidder.<eos> ~ Banks with us, does he not?
But if you prefer gingersnaps, I baked those, too.<eos> Wow.<eos> That is the single most gourmet lunch to ever going be consumed underneath a freeway overpass.<eos> Do we need to get going?<eos> - Uh... oh, yes. We do.
She only told me because I'm a minister.<eos> You did that on purpose.<eos> Did she admit to giving him the silver soda pop?<eos> Okay, who is "she" now?<eos> The lawyer. And, no, she didn't.
Don't worry, I won't tell her.<eos> Ruin your legend.<eos> With all due respect to my surroundings, fuck you.<eos> I thought you didn't believe in God.<eos> I don't.
He's sick.<eos> Yes, he is.<eos> As far as I'm aware, it hasn't happened since.<eos> You believe that?<eos> Yes, I do.
I don't want to kill him!<eos> From where I'm standing, little bird, it doesn't look like you can.<eos> I thought you were special.<eos> I thought you wanted to make me proud.<eos> - I do.
- Finally!<eos> - So let me ask you this...<eos> Yes, take a week off.<eos> You earned it.<eos> We all did.
- Germans are not so uptight about nudity. - Mm.<eos> This is not about nudity, OK? This is... This is about decency.<eos> It is about privacy.<eos> If you were so concerned with privacy and decency, why did you look?<eos> I did not.
Saying goodbye was the...<eos> hardest thing I've ever done.<eos> I never saw her again.<eos> I cried as if she had died.<eos> In a way, she did.
Clarke is right.<eos> We need to do this.<eos> Peace with the Grounders is the only way we'll survive.<eos> Oh, I don't think they know what peace is.<eos> The commander does.
You watch my back.<eos> Are you mad at me for some reason?<eos> How about you lied to me?<eos> About the will.<eos> - No, I didn't. No, I didn't. - Yeah.
I didn't believe them. You working with the housing people now, right?<eos> They tried the same program in Greenburgh and it worked, Jack.<eos> Bullshit!<eos> You really think it could make a difference?<eos> Yes, I do.
On TV I saw you.<eos> I'm leaving in just a few moments.<eos> Thank you.<eos> ♪ I don't need your answered prayers... ♪ _<eos> How you doing, Mary?
Can I have a word with you in private?<eos> Sure, Ted.<eos> You know where my wife is?<eos> I don't, Ted.<eos> But you did, didn't you?
Just forget.<eos> Can we circle back?<eos> When trey came by your house that morning...<eos> Did you know that Hanna was dead?<eos> I did not.
Your code is Amantha's birthday.<eos> I don't think anyone here knows who Amantha is, Mother.<eos> You remember?<eos> 08-11.<eos> You do.
We're not... doing.<eos> Damn, is something in the water around here?<eos> Something in the something.<eos> Um, you want the rest of the mu shu pork?<eos> Yeah, if you don't.
Um, you guys are ruining my rehearsal.<eos> Come on, y'all.<eos> I got to get up out of here, man.<eos> All right, we out.<eos> We didn't...
Did you know Tom was yours?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Um, I have no business asking that question.<eos> It's okay.<eos> I didn't...
The press don't want the truth.<eos> They want a good story.<eos> Then give them yours.<eos> No one knows you're innocent until you tell them.<eos> The police do.
What?<eos> ! I don't think that she'll come to the house.<eos> But i think she wants to make amends.<eos> Not that she deserves forgiveness.<eos> Because she doesn't.
You dropped your cards and were halfway there before anyone else realized what was happening.<eos> I've never seen your father more proud.<eos> See, here's the thing.<eos> I was terrified for you, I didn't know why.<eos> And now I do.
I get it.<eos> For you, kissing other guys means nothing.<eos> The kettle calling the pot black...<eos> Do you have a part for me?<eos> - Actually, I do...
- When you say ancient...<eos> - I wasn't calling you old.<eos> I think you're quite young for your age.<eos> - You know my age?<eos> - Everyone does.
It was Jack.<eos> It had to be him.<eos> Kenzi? What, what you think she did this?<eos> Kenzi. You saw the blue light.<eos> We all did.
Thanks.<eos> You okay?<eos> I tried to call.<eos> I didn't want to talk.<eos> But you didn't...
I do feel closer to Hannibal here.<eos> God only knows where I'd be without him.<eos> He left us his... his broken heart.<eos> How did he know we were here?<eos> He didn't.
Is that concern for your patient or concern for yourself?<eos> I'm not concerned about me.<eos> I know exactly how I will navigate my way out of whatever it is I've gotten myself into.<eos> Do you?<eos> I did.
Of course you know what he would favour.<eos> Tell me, Dr. Bloom, does he favour you?<eos> I think I amused him.<eos> Things either amuse him or they don't.<eos> And if they don't...
Tell me, Dr. Bloom, does he favour you?<eos> I think I amused him.<eos> Things either amuse him or they don't.<eos> And if they don't...<eos> Well, you didn't.
Have him do it.<eos> Leaving them without power that long would kill them all, and as I said, that's not the mission.<eos> Besides, we lost contact with Bellamy.<eos> What?<eos> We did?
She's at Mickey's.<eos> Terry went to go pick her up.<eos> I'll meet him there.<eos> You didn't have to be so hard on him.<eos> He didn't do anything wrong.
Is that grease?<eos> Down at the shop, we just call it grime.<eos> Grime.<eos> Look, I know why you asked me down here.<eos> Oh, you do? Oh. Oh, dear.
♪ Free. ♪<eos> Are you serious?<eos> That was ridiculously good.<eos> Look, I already know what you're gonna say.<eos> No, you don't.
But weddings are the time to put all those differences aside.<eos> That's a steaming load of crap. I want to be surrounded by the people who love me and the people that I love.<eos> The only person that you know how to love is yourself.<eos> You don't know the first thing about me.<eos> Yeah, actually I do.
ARE YOU SURE YOU'RE GOING TO BE FINE ON YOUR OWN?<eos> I THINK I CAN CLEAN PUBES OFF SOAP BY MYSELF.<eos> THANK YOU.<eos> HEY, DID YOU GET THAT PICTURE I SENT YOU?<eos> YES, I DID.
I MEAN, DO YOU JUST WANT THE WHOLE PLACE TO GO UP IN FLAMES?<eos> ACTUALLY, YEAH.<eos> THAT WOULD KIND OF SOLVE OUR PROBLEM, IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT.<eos> WE KNOW SOMEBODY WHO HAS A PLACE RIGHT AROUND HERE.<eos> WE DO?
- Amazing.<eos> - Oh. Yeah, and I just, you know, I want to be the best me I can be, ya know?<eos> Constance: Good for you.<eos> What did ed say when you asked him?<eos> You didn't, did you?
Lou, I need one.<eos> I'm asking you for one.<eos> Ed, that's not...<eos> No, I've seen the shows on TV.<eos> No, you don't...
Like a lot of people on the Rock River, in Dixon, Illinois.<eos> But I've never been one to focus on life's downs.<eos> I was a lifeguard in high school.<eos> And where some saw a drowning man, I saw a life to save.<eos> Which I did 77 times in five years.
We'll figure it out.<eos> That's what people do.<eos> They figure things out, stay together, make it work.<eos> I can help.<eos> Do your chores, kid.
Uh, I've been up since 4:00.<eos> Sleeping in one of these interview rooms - isn't all that relaxing. - [Chuckles]<eos> Uh, you know, I don't believe in past lives or ghosts or astrology, but this room... it, um, has a weird energy in it.<eos> Sitting in that chair, a person's whole future can change.<eos> Mine did, a long time ago.
Their mission?<eos> No, they got nothing to do with El Jefe.<eos> Oh, so you don't want to see your brother again.<eos> No, no, I...<eos> I do.
The only reason I'm here is to promote peace, while the warlords back home are ready to start civil war.<eos> Everything is going to be fine.<eos> Breathe, Abdul.<eos> I believe in you.<eos> We all do.
Honestly.<eos> Thank you, Aunt Gisela.<eos> I like you, Lena, and the others like you, too.<eos> I don't know.<eos> Yeah, they do.
Fine.<eos> Yes, I asked my brothers not to tell you I was back.<eos> I didn't want to see you after all this time when I wasn't myself, not like this, and perhaps, I feared that I might be desperate to kiss you, which I clearly can't do whilst occupying someone else's lips.<eos> Did you?<eos> Did I what?
Credit where credit's due.<eos> I told you you needed a woman to mess things up for you.<eos> You never told me if you like me in this dress.<eos> You're right.<eos> I didn't.
We're leaving in five minutes.<eos> We're not coming back.<eos> Oh, we can't just run.<eos> Waller knows I tried to steal the virus to get Tatsu back.<eos> Even if she didn't,
A really big favor.<eos> Last time you asked me for a big favor, I had to loan you my helicopter.<eos> Don't need your helicopter.<eos> I need your jet.<eos> Well, Oliver does, but both of us.
You go on, I'll catch up.<eos> I love you, Thea.<eos> Don't ever forget that, ok?<eos> Oliver, I don't know what to say.<eos> I do.
How could you stand by his side?<eos> Because of the threat of the League.<eos> We have to work with him.<eos> I don't have a choice.<eos> Yes, you do.
You're no longer in danger from the League.<eos> Maybe getting away from Starling City for a while is--is what's best for you.<eos> You approve?<eos> Is that supposed to worry me?<eos> 'Cause it actually kind of does.
Perhaps "mother" will suit you better.<eos> After your betrothal to Al Sah-him, you will extend my lineage by having a child of your own.<eos> If you think I will bear his child--<eos> Yes!<eos> I do.
How did you get him back?<eos> Doesn't matter.<eos> What matters is, you didn't kill him.<eos> No, I wanted Ra's to kill him.<eos> And I still do. Thea...
Oliver didn't do this.<eos> You have feelings for him.<eos> Yes.<eos> I mean...<eos> No! I did.
Who is it?<eos> Show me.<eos> Get a move on!<eos> Pick up.<eos> Do it now!
And her response is positive.<eos> Calm.<eos> There's another visitor.<eos> I thought you said that you didn't know she was there.<eos> I didn't.
Did you want a lawyer?<eos> - Want us to call one of your bosses?<eos> - No!<eos> No, no, no.<eos> I don't...
She's wearing that.<eos> Close to the time Larissa got bludgeoned.<eos> Placed at the scene.<eos> So we got her, right?<eos> Yeah. We do.
and then he was "wrapped" at 6:00... no, he was wrapped at 4:15 p.m.<eos> Which means when he drove back on the lot at 10:00 p.m.,<eos> - it wasn't to work.<eos> - No. You saw someone with him, didn't you?<eos> Right? You did, Bert.
Let me know if you hear anything.<eos> Jane's a hell of a swimmer. [ sighs ]<eos> She could make it out to one of those islands<eos> That korsak circled.<eos> But what if she didn't?
I wish.<eos> Do you know the bonus I get for a money shot like that?<eos> Divorce attorneys love me.<eos> And the more naked, the better.<eos> I didn't.
You have one day.<eos> I'll be back tomorrow.<eos> Hello.<eos> Do you know why your father killed himself?<eos> No, I don't.
No, I just meant it... as a joke.<eos> I feel good here, with you.<eos> You do?<eos> Can I say something stupid?<eos> I do it all the time!
He wasn't involved in Dagger's death.<eos> I think he got Number 8 to get rid of a witness.<eos> He didn't call Number 8.<eos> - How do you know?<eos> - I just do.
I'm fine.<eos> I just want him out of my life.<eos> He did this to himself.<eos> Don't feel sorry for him.<eos> Oh, I don't.
They let his ass go, cuts a dude, O.D.s his girl.<eos> I didn't do nothing, but I'm the one still stuck in here.<eos> Prosecutors want to talk to you.<eos> Hell, yeah, they want to talk to me.<eos> Now they do.
If I don't get that money by tomorrow, you'll need a new attorney for your nursing license hearing.<eos> Maybe your boyfriend here can help.<eos> Wow, I... hey. Everything I have is yours, you know this.<eos> I know, but you don't have a job, Eddie.<eos> Yeah, well, you barely do either.
You've been leaking information to the press about active murder investigations, which could compromise those investigations.<eos> I haven't leaked anything.<eos> You sent e-mails from your work computer.<eos> Oh, right.<eos> Yes, I did.
Paper never wins.<eos> Calm down, fella.<eos> No one knows what really went on.<eos> That puke had a threesome with my Kitty Kat.<eos> Well, so you do then.
Why?<eos> He... he didn't.<eos> Well, police found evidence in Derek's locker.<eos> Did you ever feel threatened?<eos> Did you...
And it's still there.<eos> It doesn't go away.<eos> No, it doesn't.<eos> But it changes.<eos> It does.
Do you wanna hear my revelation about you?<eos> No, I-I got my own.<eos> - You did?<eos> - Okay, you can wipe the surprised look off your face.<eos> Yeah, I did.
- Is that what you want? - Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.<eos> It was my fault.<eos> It's my first day on the floor.<eos> I'm still figuring out where the forks go, if you know what I mean.<eos> I do not.
You can't fix me?<eos> It's just that with other diseases,<eos> I know what I'm dealing with.<eos> But with this...<eos> I don't.
Is that what I am?<eos> Stop beating yourself up.<eos> Bo, if I had just given her the serum when I had the chance...<eos> Look, you had no way of knowing.<eos> But now you do.
Let's just say I'm really good at reading people.<eos> Look, the point is... if this Maestro is so great maybe he can help you too.<eos> I'm okay, I'm fine.<eos> How did you know I don't like being alone?<eos> Because nobody does, not all the time.
I still don't get how you knew to come home now.<eos> Dude, snail mail?<eos> I assumed it was from you.<eos> What?<eos> I didn't...
They're fucking wrong.<eos> Why are the lights off?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> You want a drink?<eos> I don't.
It's gonna ruin our name. It's gonna ruin our reputation.<eos> Everything Mom and Dad ever worked for their whole lives is gonna be gone.<eos> - John, we cannot report this.<eos> - We don't have a choice.<eos> Yeah, we do.
I gotta sit this one out, Coach.<eos> You know better than that.<eos> The bigger the tribe, the easier it is to call on the spirits.<eos> How do I know this'll work?<eos> You don't.
Then every minute counts.<eos> Peter, how much time is left on ABADDON's countdown clock?<eos> About 35 hours.<eos> Well, do we know anything about their leader?<eos> Nobody does.
Okay, you two, it's time for bed.<eos> But Raul was telling me about his scars.<eos> Well, I'll tell you what, sunshine, if you go to bed right now, I'll tell you about the scar I got when I got zapped from an electric eel.<eos> - Mom has a scar.<eos> - No, I don't.
And you can do the same, Leland.<eos> Do you know what it's like to lose someone?<eos> To have them just snatched away from you?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, I do.
You're a son who lost his mother.<eos> I'm a mother who lost her son.<eos> I know.<eos> They deserve to suffer just like your mother did.<eos> No, they don't!
You...<eos> - You don't seem to be...<eos> - Because I knew.<eos> Sean... he told me that he felt something.<eos> Oh, of course he did.
It seems you're way ahead of the curve.<eos> I don't follow.<eos> Well, allowing Claire Bennigan to gather those children, ask them questions about Africa, about Drill.<eos> Oh, I, uh...<eos> You didn't...?
That is bullshit.<eos> No goddamn way that's the same snowflake!<eos> Respectfully, yes it was.<eos> So wait, you think like five winters ago, a snowflake fell to the ground, and, like, melted, then evaporated and shit, went back up to the sky, then turned back into the same exact snowflake, flew back down to earth at, like, the exact moment that that dude kissed that chick?<eos> Yes, I do.
Not really, I mean...<eos> Obviously I love him, but it's not destiny that we met.<eos> I think it was.<eos> - Bullshit.<eos> - I do.
- At the light.<eos> - Maybe!<eos> But you don't know that!<eos> - Well, yeah, actually I do.<eos> - Or... or you don't.
In June last year, just after the Queen was crowned, your son Lord Montague and your son Geoffrey Pole dined with Lady Mary.<eos> Two weeks later, they dined with her again.<eos> I wonder what they discussed?<eos> I'm sure you do.<eos> Actually, no, I don't.
4.20.<eos> 4.20 was the time of Janet's death.<eos> Oh, tell him about the day of the funeral.<eos> Oh, he doesn't want to know about this.<eos> I do.
Damn, Shawn, you sweating like you was balling for real.<eos> You know I had to school Riq a little bit.<eos> I used to hoop at St. John's before I blew out my knee.<eos> I didn't even know you went to college.<eos> Okay, well, I did.
Now I would die before I let him die.<eos> It's simple. Complete.<eos> I never made that change.<eos> Kev did, I didn't.<eos> Some do, some don't.
It's not a question of if.<eos> There is no way Chuckie was smuggling heroin by himself. - Heroin?<eos> - What's the fuck's the matter with you?<eos> Carl, you have to do the right thing and tell the cops it was you.<eos> - No, I don't.
Uh, a few of the girls here for sure, but I wouldn't try talking to them. You'd just get them into trouble.<eos> - He like boys?<eos> - More like he likes to watch.<eos> Had me and this girl go at it while he sat in the corner.<eos> You do girls.
Just one question.<eos> Am I supposed to solve this or not?<eos> Just no surprises, Detective Velcoro.<eos> Ray accepts dualities must be effected to serve public interests.<eos> I really do.
Take it to another hotel, all right?<eos> I just don't know how to be out in the world, man.<eos> Hey, look out that window.<eos> Look at me.<eos> Nobody does.
I want you to.<eos> And I think we should get married.<eos> I don't want you to do this because you think it's the right thing or something.<eos> I'm not.<eos> I don't.
Why did she say it then?<eos> What part of it do you not understand?<eos> Your life doesn't interest me.<eos> - I want the baby to have a dad.<eos> - But he doesn't!
What's wrong?<eos> What's the matter?<eos> Is it the baby?<eos> - Don't you want it?<eos> - Of course I do.
Fancy a drink?<eos> Yes.<eos> - Put on your trousers.<eos> - They itch.<eos> No they don't.
And keep your voice down.<eos> No one must see us leaving the palace.<eos> What's wrong, Majesty?<eos> Do you love me?<eos> Of course I do.
- Come on.<eos> Look, we've got the gun.<eos> Why don't we just let him... Wait, wait. I don't want it.<eos> All right?<eos> I don't...
Tell me what I want to know about Fisk.<eos> You think you're different... from me?<eos> From him?<eos> But you'll get there.<eos> Sooner or later... we all do, men like us.
You...<eos> You think anyone's gonna believe that?<eos> You're running around in a mask, holing up with a known felon in the wake of a series of bombings.<eos> There's that police officer you're holding hostage, so... yes.<eos> Actually, I do.
Gail...<eos> why did you tell Sandra that I'm running an escort service?<eos> I beg your pardon?<eos> You told her I was selling sex.<eos> No, I didn't.
Spence took miguel to a movie.<eos> What do we need to talk about?<eos> I saw the way you were looking at me today.<eos> You wanted me.<eos> No, i didn't.
And that's why I'm gonna help you.<eos> Thank you.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> You don't want me to sign this.<eos> Yes, I do.
You have a boyfriend?<eos> Why didn't you tell me?<eos> Well...<eos> - I want to meet him.<eos> - No, you don't.
[Chuckles] Maybe.<eos> So, Doug, how did you meet this beautiful lady?<eos> - Well...<eos> - You don't want to hear about that.<eos> Yes, I do.
Don't worry about me.<eos> How are you?<eos> I'm so mad, I could spit.<eos> Did you hear what he was saying about us, that we're too close?<eos> I did, and...
You want me to be more like her?<eos> Exactly.<eos> And it's a two-way street.<eos> You can tell me my dress is ugly, and I can tell you that I don't like your hairstyle.<eos> You don't?
- Look. I know it seems crazy, but the Powells really do love Deion.<eos> Letting him stay here might be the best thing for him.<eos> Listen, lady.<eos> You have no idea what I'm going through.<eos> Actually, I do.
I rescued your neighbor's dog from the shelter.<eos> I also convinced her to adopt a Chihuahua.<eos> - (Chihuahua barking)<eos> - That's Penny. For a tiny dog, she's really loud.<eos> No, you didn't.
Mrs. Taylor was involved with Louie's death.<eos> And Blanca's. I told you.<eos> There's no way Taylor's the one who killed them.<eos> But she knows who did.<eos> Yeah, she does.
I resent that.<eos> Will you tell us The proposal story again?<eos> You don't want to hear that again.<eos> We done told it so many times.<eos> Aw, yes, we do! Please!
It doesn't matter that we have, like, we have great chemistry?<eos> It doesn't matter that i love you?<eos> Did you just say that you love me?<eos> Yes.<eos> I did.
You asked me before if I had faith.<eos> I remember.<eos> I told you I didn't.<eos> That wasn't the truth.<eos> I do.
What about the heart?<eos> No, the heart is not eternal.<eos> But doesn't God have a heart?<eos> Yes.<eos> Of course He does.
- What?<eos> Do what?<eos> - Your son, did you beat him a lot?<eos> What?<eos> No, I didn't...
He never hit me or Arthur... never.<eos> Your mother says he hit her... hard and often.<eos> - That's why she left.<eos> - You spoke to my mother?<eos> We did, in fact, a couple of times.
Did you know that when you're not using your chopsticks, you should place them in front of you, parallel to the edge of the sushi bar with the narrow end in the hashi oki?<eos> That's what this cute little thing is called... hashi oki.<eos> I googled it.<eos> I never knew that.<eos> Well, now you do.
You have no idea what it's like for me, the amount of pressure I'm under every single day.<eos> We're both under pressure.<eos> Can you at least try and understand what it's like for me?<eos> I want to help.<eos> No, you don't.
- Yeah.<eos> Have a good night.<eos> Totally get it, by the way.<eos> I like her.<eos> Everyone does.
I mean...<eos> Unless...<eos> You don't think that Wilson would testify against you?<eos> No, no, no. Wilson loves me.<eos> More than my husband ever did.
I do.<eos> [Groans] So, Niko...<eos> Is officially working at the SLS as of, uh, three hours ago.<eos> Ellis transferred her to one of his other restaurants.<eos> He did indeed.
I actually have an interview with Mr. Boone for the new restaurant he's opening.<eos> Wow. Good for you.<eos> How's married life?<eos> Oh, you know.<eos> Nope. I don't.
You're only going to make her more upset.<eos> Well, I can't just sit here and do nothing.<eos> I'm taking care of her. I promise.<eos> So, you had a key to the house. Yes.<eos> But a lot of people did.
You either like someone or you don't.<eos> All right.<eos> I don't like him.<eos> Is there a reason?<eos> I just don't.
He was happy.<eos> That's the thing -- the police said my son killed himself.<eos> Now, why would a happy man take his own life?<eos> - It makes no sense.<eos> - No, it doesn't.
Um, I thought you were...<eos> Aren't you on the pill?<eos> I was, but as it turns out, one in 11 women get pregnant while on the pill every year.<eos> Who knew?<eos> I certainly did not.
Oh, baby, I think after everything that's happened,<eos> I-I... really, I just want to attack life.<eos> - You know? - Yeah.<eos> You want to talk about what's happened?<eos> No, I do not.
How did I miss this?<eos> How did I not see myself?<eos> !<eos> Oh, my God, I have to call him.<eos> Yes, you do... immediately!
In fact, I am so up for having another crazy night, I have prepared as well.<eos> Oh, look!<eos> You got a whole mess of cocaine.<eos> Oh, yeah. 'Cause you love cocaine, right?<eos> Yes, I do!
Abso-fucking-lutely.<eos> Bring the cursor up to the blue button and three, two, one, click it.<eos> Did you get it? Did you get it?<eos> !<eos> Yeah! The whole world did.
Tell your parents, they have to let you stay.<eos> It's safe now.<eos> Emily, I have to go.<eos> Listen to me, you don't.<eos> Yes, I do.
We're done.<eos> We've been dealt a king and a ten.<eos> I don't know why you want to ask the dealer for another card.<eos> - Because I know it's an ace.<eos> - No, you don't!
I know the outcome.<eos> My hand is bigger than Bob's!<eos> Put me in, Coach.<eos> So, saying we wanted to, how do we present it?<eos> We don't.
I don't know.<eos> You know what?<eos> I think you do know.<eos> I don't think you're done with Haven.<eos> I don't.
I will protect you.<eos> I don't want your protection.<eos> I want your love.<eos> You must feel something for me.<eos> I do.
Where is it?<eos> Gee, I submitted it.<eos> Didn't I?<eos> - Not yet, no.<eos> - I didn't?
White male. Fair. Mid-30s.<eos> Facial hair, 6'3", 220.<eos> Which is exactly what I wrote down on my notebook when you described the shooter to me at the scene.<eos> - No, I told you...<eos> - Yes, you did!
- Yeah!<eos> Calm down, that's enough.<eos> So Mr Moreau, you stand by your statement?<eos> Shouldn't I?<eos> Of course I do.
We are here to establish the facts of the Queen's infidelity.<eos> You are accused of seducing the Queen at the convent in Bourbon-les-Eaux.<eos> And of fathering her child.<eos> Do you swear to give us the truth of this sordid encounter?<eos> I do.
Trust a black hat once, shame on them.<eos> Trust a black hat twice...<eos> How long do you think you can deny the thirst, Nelson?<eos> You have no idea how much money can be made selling the secrets at your fingertips.<eos> But I do.
(sighs)<eos> That's why I'm here.<eos> I know who wrote the code.<eos> (chuckles softly)<eos> I did.
I was wrong about Tobin.<eos> I will be wrong again.<eos> But I am not wrong about Nelson.<eos> I want you to be right, okay?<eos> I really do.
I think about what the Dragon will do to me if I don't serve her up.<eos> She called me a man.<eos> A sweet... man.<eos> I didn't hear... Reba's heart.<eos> I... didn't!
I believe that's what they call a "mic drop."<eos> You dropped the mic, Will, but here you are having to come back and pick it up again.<eos> I knew you would keep running if I kept chasing you.<eos> I knew you wanted me to know exactly where I could find you when I needed to.<eos> And you did.
You know.<eos> Well, take your time.<eos> Now, you didn't tell anyone.<eos> No, no, of course not.<eos> Well, don't.
Nick is doing everything he can.<eos> And where's Monroe?<eos> Why haven't they found him yet?<eos> Listen, I know this is difficult for you.<eos> No, you don't.
Will has looked after your family for many years.<eos> He has great affection for you all, but you're asking him to commit a malpractice.<eos> He can't possibly do that.<eos> I sympathise.<eos> I really do.
He was afraid of getting me killed.<eos> You must have been scared to death.<eos> Well, actually, I was thinking, "this, uh, this thing goes off, there'd be nothing left of me to send home to Jordan and my mom."<eos> You're lucky it didn't go off.<eos> No, no, it did. It did.
Now, that... that's true. That's true, my glory days.<eos> My glory days ended my freshman year when I fractured my back in training camp.<eos> Never played a game.<eos> I spent an entire year in traction, so, trust me, I do get where you're coming from.<eos> - I do.
Forget that I'll never be able to build a house from the ground up.<eos> I can't even change a damn light bulb.<eos> Do you have any idea how that makes me feel?<eos> - I know it's hard.<eos> - No, you don't.
- He signed the DNR.<eos> That was his choice.<eos> - Three months ago.<eos> Who knows what he would have wanted today?<eos> Actually, I do.
I'll call Dr. Nelson at Hopkins and secure your spot.<eos> I didn't say "Hopkins."<eos> I don't understand.<eos> You said you want to go into surgery.<eos> And I do... but on my own terms.
All right, I will try and fast-track the paperwork on the medication, but it could still take a month.<eos> All right, so for now, add on an I.V. aminoglycoside.<eos> All right, that might work.<eos> Okay, but, uh, this sucks.<eos> Yeah, it does.
- You're not your dad.<eos> - Gee, thank you for the reminder.<eos> You know, maybe if you focused more on surgery a little bit more than Joey's ass,<eos> - this girl wouldn't be back in here.<eos> - You don't...
Rachel said she'd take care of me, and then tried to dump me on my Uncle then hide the fact that she's dying.<eos> That's not lying?<eos> Devin, I am so sorry.<eos> And I know that this must be...<eos> No, you don't.
Like hell you are.<eos> We've got to find Monroe and Rosalee.<eos> There!<eos> Did anybody get away?<eos> Because Riken sure didn't.
Perhaps today is a good day to thank God for our victory.<eos> Hmm, lucky me.<eos> To have a friend like you, the luck is all mine.<eos> - Cassel will come.<eos> - And if he does not, Sire?
Why would you ask that?<eos> You're doing that biting-your-lower-lip thing that you do when something's bothering you.<eos> I'm fine.<eos> Cisco says I don't have a life.<eos> You don't, do you?
Everyone's getting along, all kum-bah-yah.<eos> Everyone's talking about moving on and whatnot.<eos> You saw her, man.<eos> I know you saw her.<eos> Okay, and what if I did?
You don't need a drink, Sam.<eos> What you need... is to forgive yourself.<eos> I don't know if I can do that.<eos> Not if Joe can't forgive me.<eos> And what if he doesn't?
Okay, look, if you don't want to deal anymore, that's fine, but at least tell me what's going on.<eos> I'm getting back together with Griffin.<eos> What, are you crazy?<eos> Why? I love him.<eos> - No, you don't.
Your honor, I'd like to ask for an immediate mistrial.<eos> Because you had your client cause one?<eos> No, the state happily accepts father Crawford's plea.<eos> Your honor, he doesn't know what he's saying.<eos> I do, too, your honor.
- But you lied!<eos> - You said you didn't know this Rudy guy.<eos> - I didn't. Then how come he ended up in a mental institution?<eos> How should I freaking know?<eos> You do, though.
You're angry, you lash out, you use people.<eos> But only because you don't know better.<eos> Been alone so long you don't know what it means to love someone.<eos> And here is a boy who so clearly loved you.<eos> He still does.
Sure he shouldn't take the trophy?<eos> Look at me.<eos> Look at what you did to me.<eos> You said you loved me.<eos> I still do.
Every awful thing anyone has ever done to me.<eos> But you know what?<eos> You're the worst one.<eos> 'Cause I didn't know I had to be afraid of you.<eos> You don't.
Are we a bad couple for going at it like that?<eos> - I mean, we went ballistic.<eos> - Face it, babe.<eos> We're both strong-ass cups of tea who do not like to back down.<eos> - No, we do not.
It's a big deal, you guys.<eos> - What?<eos> - You don't know what he wants, either.<eos> You have no idea what your husband likes.<eos> Like you do.
Hey, give me a second, Zo-Zo, okay?<eos> Happy Birthday, Dre.<eos> Thanks, J.D.<eos> You know I danced for Whodini, right?<eos> Uh... Yes, I did.
And then you came along, Dre, and you changed everything.<eos> I was so busy trying to make you think I was perfect,<eos> I almost flunked out of med school.<eos> Hey, babe, you didn't have to do that for me.<eos> - I didn't?
If y'all wanna do it, be my guest.<eos> I don't want to keep playing these games.<eos> I like you.<eos> You like me, too.<eos> And what if I do?
I can't take anyone else lying to me.<eos> I can't.<eos> I have to tell you one other thing.<eos> If this is about Keisha, I know.<eos> You do?
- Huh... would you give us a minute please, Cisco?<eos> - Yes, sir.<eos> - I realize you don't have to explain your hiring decisions to me, but maybe for the sake of a fun exercise, we could pretend you did.<eos> - I have a good feeling about him.<eos> Just as I did about you.
John's more prepared than even I realized.<eos> You're gonna have to sneak a couple things in.<eos> Assyrian exorcism rite.<eos> How did he know he'd need that exact spell?<eos> He didn't.
Strong motherfucker.<eos> That's right.<eos> You know what matrix tortuosity is?<eos> I-I do not, no.<eos> No one does.
Knowing what it is is tough.<eos> And let me guess.<eos> You know what the right thing to do is.<eos> No.<eos> No, I don't, Matthew.
Do you know what hubris is?<eos> Do you know? !<eos> Sorry.<eos> I-I thought that was another... rhetorical... question.<eos> Yes, I do.
- I'm in.<eos> - Ah, that's my boy!<eos> Name your terms.<eos> You remember when we were 14, we stole all that meat from Satriani's?<eos> Yeah, I do.
Or no deal.<eos> Are you all right?<eos> I'm okay.<eos> How long have you known Fish Mooney?<eos> Huh? I don't.
So what next?<eos> Assume Loeb and Falcone are the only ones who know where the stash is.<eos> We need someone close to them, someone who'll talk.<eos> That person doesn't exist.<eos> Yeah, he does.
But, Harvey, I can't do that without your help.<eos> Look, I know you're riding high, what with getting over on Loeb and all.<eos> But there's one thing you should always remember:<eos> Fly too close to the sun, you're gonna get burned.<eos> - You done?
Call me tonight.<eos> I can come over after work, if you want.<eos> Oh, Jason..., please, I really have to go.<eos> No.<eos> You don't.
Sir, the crate is empty.<eos> My worst fear has come true.<eos> We have to assume they were all taken at the same time back in the '40s.<eos> Does that mean Hydra has them?<eos> And if Hydra doesn't, who does?
I know you think I overreacted.<eos> But this decision... leaving Skye with you ...<eos> it carries real danger.<eos> I want you to understand that.<eos> I do.
Her vitals currently are steady.<eos> - May I?<eos> - Oh, yeah.<eos> I did not know that you were married.<eos> Now you do.
- Right.<eos> - We can't risk you losing control.<eos> - I won't.<eos> - You don't know that.<eos> - Yes, I do.
Weaver thinks it made you into some kind of a messenger for an alien race.<eos> Can you say with certainty that that's not true?<eos> And we haven't even begun to talk about your protégé, Skye.<eos> You two have a lot in common.<eos> At least, you once did.
Flesh-eating.<eos> Weapons sale gone bad with the Russians.<eos> Give my team time to assess.<eos> Did you say, "Biological Weapon"?<eos> Yes, I did.
We have to make sure that the Cal that we put out into the world is the same Cal that I've seen here... th-the safe and user-friendly Cal.<eos> You were trying to make it easy on him.<eos> You were being compassionate.<eos> - How do we get Lincoln back?<eos> - We don't.
Flippin' hope so!<eos> See ya, Mum.<eos> I fucking saw you in there, Danny!<eos> You didn't see a thing.<eos> Yes, I did.
- What are you saying?<eos> - When the teleporter left the cargo hold...<eos> We were able to follow his signature.<eos> - You know where they are?<eos> - We do.
- Deep in their ship, under lock and key.<eos> - For now.<eos> - Sounds like somebody knows something we don't.<eos> - Jiaying, this doesn't concern him.<eos> - Yes. Yes, it does.
Why can't you be in there right now?<eos> I told you, we needed someone objective.<eos> I know that Whitehall subjected you to unspeakable horrors, that he took everything from you.<eos> A good man, Phil Coulson, put a bullet in him.<eos> - Where did you...?
How many people who trusted you have died?<eos> See, I've seen the real Grant Ward, the one buried deep inside.<eos> He's a coward who always has an excuse or someone else to blame.<eos> - You don't know me.<eos> - Sure, I do.
I get it.<eos> You make the best choice you can.<eos> Sometimes, it works out.<eos> Sometimes...<eos> - It didn't. - It did not.
Now?<eos> - You want to talk about this now?<eos> - No.<eos> We...<eos> We don't...
Suddenly, I have a "reputation"<eos> for boning other guys' wives and girlfriends.<eos> I can't even get a job.<eos> - I thought you had a job.<eos> - I did.
Unless you're going to arrest and charge me,<eos> I'll be on my way.<eos> If there's anything further you'd like to discuss, please feel free to contact one of Mr. Stark's attorneys.<eos> Do you have any idea how stupid that was?<eos> - I didn't...
By her own account,<eos> Carter would be back in cuffs when Stark didn't show.<eos> She gave up Captain America's blood.<eos> I know that's big for her.<eos> So do you, Jack.
No, I might have you edged out on that.<eos> Okay, present company excluded.<eos> All I'm saying is Armand Tully is a dead end.<eos> You find something out?<eos> I, um, did a little back-channeling with Marci.
Yeah?<eos> If there is a God... and if he cares at all about... about any of us...<eos> Fisk will get what he deserves.<eos> You have to believe that.<eos> I do.
Yes, of course.<eos> I'll be back in a minute.<eos> I didn't vote for Senator Cherryh last election.<eos> Thank you so much.<eos> Few people did.
I only ever needed my friend.<eos> I wouldn't have kept this from you, Matt.<eos> Not from you.<eos> You don't know that. You don't know that.<eos> Yeah, I do.
Sure.<eos> Thanks for knocking.<eos> I didn't.<eos> No, that's right.<eos> You didn't, did you?
- We're not friends.<eos> Hey, your buddy here jacked us for a hundred bucks.<eos> But I'm willing to let that slide if you say I'm your best friend now.<eos> Say it, do it.<eos> Do it.
Not on my property, you're not.<eos> Oh, damn, Waymond, it just got real out here.<eos> Have you ever seen anything like this?<eos> Anders, do you think we should shut this down?<eos> No, I don't, Montez.
Now then...<eos> Where did your son and queen go?<eos> I'm afraid I don't know.<eos> He doesn't know.<eos> None of them do.
You want dirt.<eos> I don't have any.<eos> You must.<eos> If I did, I don't know if I'd shovel it your way.<eos> But I don't.
That's awesome.<eos> Hey, have you ever tried group Zen?<eos> I'm sorry, what?<eos> I love group Zen.<eos> Do you?
You know, it just... It steps on the peaceful environment that we have here.<eos> It rattles Mother Nature.<eos> You understand that, don't you, Dylan?<eos> Yeah, sure.<eos> We do.
I'm sorry, too.<eos> Things just escalated.<eos> - Exactly.<eos> - You know, but I have to say, it doesn't seem like you like me very much.<eos> - She doesn't.
He disobeyed your direct order.<eos> What a cruel mistress.<eos> Good morning, mom!<eos> Ah, buenos día.<eos> No, I didn't.
And young Jane chose to believe that.<eos> Mostly.<eos> If I'm being honest, perhaps the fantasy cracked, just a little.<eos> _<eos> But then again, it usually does.
_<eos> I'm just saying... our first case together.<eos> And the last.<eos> And we caught the bad guy!<eos> We definitely did.
Really?<eos> Yeah.<eos> No response yet but...<eos> I think it's good.<eos> I really do.
She was just a person.<eos> But that knife was very filthy.<eos> Though clearly not a perfect one.<eos> - Xiomara, I want to apologize.<eos> - No, you don't.
But that knife was very filthy.<eos> Though clearly not a perfect one.<eos> - Xiomara, I want to apologize.<eos> - No, you don't.<eos> Oh, yes, I do.
Don't you want that for Rogelio?<eos> I mean, if he wants it...<eos> - More children?<eos> Of course I do.<eos> - You do?
And why is that a bad thing?<eos> He was there.<eos> He provided for me.<eos> - I know that.<eos> - No, you don't.
TV's too small.<eos> Your face needs to be 50 feet high.<eos> And in 3-D.<eos> I have been told I have the perfect features for 3-D.<eos> Of course you do.
And how did he land such a prized role?<eos> He gave a great audition.<eos> But I don't understand.<eos> Even if you wanted a part, you didn't have to get me fired.<eos> Of course I did.
Of course.<eos> Do you think they'll last?<eos> Jane and Rafael?<eos> 'Cause I don't think they will.<eos> Deep down, I-I don't.
Are you nervous?<eos> A little.<eos> You know I hate needles.<eos> I just need to have faith.<eos> And I do.
That's not your fault.<eos> _ _ _<eos> I get that, ma.<eos> But do you think that that's what he'd want?<eos> Because I don't.
It's Rose Solano.<eos> Seconds before Zazo was impaled.<eos> She couldn't have killed him.<eos> And Emilio is right there with her.<eos> So the bellboy did it.
Thanks, mom. It means a lot.<eos> It means a lot.<eos> Rafael:<eos> Wow. Babies need a lot of gear.<eos> No, they don't.
Let me guess... cute, rich, but dumb, right?<eos> Oh, for the love...<eos> - I-I-I'm not...<eos> - You don't want me to read that?<eos> - Well... I-I do, but...
I hope it helps.<eos> If you have, like, five minutes at the end of your session To ask, like, a little question for me.<eos> What's going on?<eos> I-I kissed marco last night.<eos> You did what?
You're not imagining it.<eos> But I don't know where it's coming from, and...<eos> I mean, there's so much up in the air, - and with you it is safe and familiar and... - Oh, wow.<eos> - Safe and familiar, huh?<eos> - I-I didn't
Almost every day.<eos> Well, according to the network logs in Evan's laptop, he connected to the coffee shop's Wi-Fi the morning after the murder.<eos> You still think it's a possibility that he framed himself?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I do.
You gave me this mission.<eos> You're the reason I'm here.<eos> Now, it's been two years, Cassie.<eos> Please tell me you know who Leland Frost is.<eos> I don't.
This is crazy stuff, but it's true.<eos> I remember meeting you in 1987... 28 years ago, and you looked exactly the same as you do today.<eos> Don't understand?<eos> That's okay.<eos> I didn't either at first.
Left just after the quarantine ended.<eos> That was you... outside the tents that night... the lights.<eos> I was wrong about the plague.<eos> People could have died because of me.<eos> But they didn't.
Well, that was fun, but I feel like I know way too much about all of you.<eos> But, like, not so much about Becca, though.<eos> What?<eos> I drink.<eos> I did, a few...
I mean, it wasn't that bad.<eos> Did we just watch the same movie?<eos> I'll admit, you know, maybe Lolly and I don't share the same taste in film, but you know, it's not like we have to have everything in common.<eos> Are you dating her?<eos> Honest, I don't...
Potential.<eos> I mean, you got a long ways to go, but the foundation, it is there.<eos> You want to feel something?<eos> Do you?<eos> You do.
So why'd she... Blow you off tonight?<eos> If I had to guess, I... I'd have to say someone's trying to keep us apart.<eos> I mean, the thing is, I really like Jamie, and I didn't want to blow him off tonight.<eos> I mean, I love coal oven pizza.<eos> Who doesn't, right?
Joe.<eos> Dr. Wells had nothing to do with my mom's murder.<eos> You believe that now?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, yeah--I do.
You're right.<eos> How are any of these guys going to protect me?<eos> They don't know.<eos> They don't know what Mardon's capable of.<eos> All right, well, lucky for you, Your friends at S.T.A.R. Labs do.
Relationships should be more than just getting along.<eos> Your heart should ache for me.<eos> Does it?<eos> You're not upset with me?<eos> No one did anything wrong.
Sorry.<eos> You, Detective, are one of the few people I know that truly understands that kind of loss.<eos> Iris's mother, you never talk about her, do you?<eos> No.<eos> I don't.
The best in the city, best in the country.<eos> Look at them.<eos> They have no clue what's going on.<eos> They're baffled, and the reason for that is what's happening inside Barry is a mystery, and they don't have the tools to solve it.<eos> - But you do?
You know, I couldn't have done any of this without you.<eos> I feel the same way about you.<eos> It's so strange.<eos> I mean, I look at him now, and I know that he killed my mom and he sent my dad to jail, but, I mean, sometimes he's just so kind in the moment, I actually like him.<eos> But you never did.
How's our cargo doing?<eos> All quiet so far.<eos> Don't bother.<eos> Your powers don't work in here.<eos> None of ours do.
All you can do is ride the wind.<eos> Hurricane force wind, category awesome.<eos> Voo, stop it. Stop.<eos> Stop it.<eos> Don't.
I'd say it's time to cut your losses.<eos> That's a big fucking bundle to give up on.<eos> Tell me what to do.<eos> Eric told me you left.<eos> I did.
Ever since you came here.<eos> What am I supposed to do with that now?<eos> Do you really think I didn't know?<eos> ~ Well, why didn't you say anything?<eos> ~ Because you never did!
~ No, she's not.<eos> ~ She's, er... I'm afraid Lee's really hurt her.<eos> ~ What? What? !<eos> You should be in -<eos> You didn't...
You gotta change the past.<eos> Joe?<eos> So what... What, that's it?<eos> You think I should just do it?<eos> Yeah, I do.
Why?<eos> Why?<eos> You could have had the life you wanted.<eos> You could have had everything you ever wanted!<eos> I already do.
Like, get you into a fancy hotel suite, Give your dad a few drinks, loosen him up, And then they hit you with the pitch?<eos> My dad doesn't drink.<eos> Well, he was arrested for driving while intoxicated About an hour after your meeting.<eos> I mean, i didn't see him have any drinks that day.<eos> Yeah, you did.
Officer Brasher was behind him.<eos> What happened next.<eos> I was making my way around a vehicle to get over to them when I heard the shot.<eos> Did you see Officer Brasher draw her weapon?<eos> I did not.
Pam, you can't just keep giving me your stuff.<eos> - No, come on, take it.<eos> - Yeah, I don't want it.<eos> - Just take it.<eos> - I don't...
The wedding vows didn't take place, there is no truce between our clans.<eos> They didn't wed?<eos> I thought you knew.<eos> I had no idea.<eos> Well, you do now.
As defense, I offer only my ignorance.<eos> Meaning you thought you were stealing from Calhoun?<eos> Yes, sir. I did.<eos> And now you know the prize in question belongs to me.<eos> - That, I do. - Mm-hmm.
You know it's gotta be cash and only cash, right?<eos> And what about an I.D.?<eos> You got a new I.D.?<eos> Hmm? That's the only way to get off the grid.<eos> No, I don't.
I'm so sorry for your loss.<eos> Could you turn that off?<eos> I can't believe she's gone.<eos> I can't believe I abandoned her.<eos> Brooke, we both did.
And then I say...<eos> I don't know, a line of some sort about something.<eos> Or not.<eos> My, uh... Dad was out when I got home last night.<eos> Did you...
If you're the key to all of this, then you have to find a way to fight back.<eos> I did.<eos> And he sliced Will in half, right in front of me.<eos> I don't know if I have any fight left.<eos> Yes, you do.
I can't talk about it.<eos> Mr. Branson...<eos> Whatever your name is...<eos> Okay, my friends are dead, my family has been targeted, and you know why.<eos> Actually, I don't, Emma.
I am.<eos> I really am.<eos> - After what happened to Will, I couldn't risk...<eos> - I get it.<eos> I do.
Oh, I'm sorry that I didn't call you yesterday.<eos> Actually, uh, now's probably a really good time to catch up.<eos> What's wrong?<eos> I went through Rachel's raw footage, a lot of it, trying to find a connection to Branson.<eos> And did you?
I should have.<eos> But I didn't have any information that would've helped.<eos> It was a no-win situation.<eos> I really wanna believe you.<eos> But you don't?
He left.<eos> I messed things up royally.<eos> Or maybe he left because he did it.<eos> Audrey, I know that you want justice for Rachel...<eos> Yeah, I do.
I miss you.<eos> I miss what we've had.<eos> But whatever they say about me, you have to know that I would never hurt you.<eos> I don't even know who you are.<eos> Yes, you do.
Oh, none of these people.<eos> They've declined.<eos> And these are the only replies we've received for a party that begins in less than six hours.<eos> No one wants this.<eos> - I do.
- No!<eos> You gave him something over time...<eos> Stop it!<eos> You really think that I'm capable of murdering your child?<eos> I didn't before.
The nurse.<eos> He's not crying but he's awake.<eos> He needs to be held.<eos> Give me two minutes to reschedule my meeting, and then we'll grab lunch.<eos> We just did the autopsy on his mother.
That's a girl's machine.<eos> - He said that that's actually...<eos> - I know what he said.<eos> Yeah, I-I choose not to hear when he gets like this.<eos> How we doing up there, Johnny?
Blanche?<eos> Don't go swimming without me.<eos> It's dangerous.<eos> - I know how to swim.<eos> - No, you don't.
- I want to hire you.<eos> In the middle of the night?<eos> He's been Kilgraved.<eos> - Open the door, Jones.<eos> - Don't!
I don't even know what the hell I'm looking for.<eos> Anything that points to where Antoine might've gone.<eos> Airline receipts, train schedules.<eos> Won't find any of that if someone grabbed him.<eos> No one did.
Then what was it?<eos> Why does it matter?<eos> Maybe I can make it right.<eos> You can't.<eos> You didn't do anything wrong.
There's only one that can help Luke.<eos> I just don't want him to wake up alone, not knowing what's happening.<eos> I don't even know what's happening.<eos> It's asking a lot, and you don't know me, but...<eos> Sure I do.
- What the hell is all this?<eos> It is rather unpleasant, I agree.<eos> All these chemical products!<eos> Keeps the birds away.<eos> So does public radio!
It's on page one of the rule book!<eos> That's where I doodle.<eos> It's a comic strip I do called Bumble and Grumble.<eos> Grumble likes to yell, but deep down he loves Bumble like a son.<eos> No, he doesn't.
And?<eos> - Nothing.<eos> Maybe there's nothing to find.<eos> You don't believe that.<eos> - No, I don't.
Wow...<eos> You are...<eos> - I'm what?<eos> You know what you are.<eos> And now I do too.
Alive and breathing, which is the good news.<eos> And the bad?<eos> Well... if her soul is being used for a dark purpose, then she doesn't have long... a day or two at most.<eos> - How can you separate a soul from a body?<eos> - You don't.
My lawyer believed I would be released.<eos> Then orders from the Defense Department arrived, and I ended up in this hell hole.<eos> Defense Secretary Richards has to be the one who's behind this.<eos> You believe I'm innocent?<eos> Yes, I do.
I won "best couple" in high school, and the guy I was dating was a clown.<eos> Oh, no.<eos> I need your dad to like me.<eos> T... he will.<eos> He does, Zelda.
I think she's... she's having trouble moving past an old relationship.<eos> Yeah.<eos> It happens.<eos> I think I know why you really came to visit.<eos> Oh, you do?
Sometimes it's like you had something special with somebody, and it's... it's hard to make those feelings go away.<eos> That's exactly what I'm saying.<eos> Hey, so she didn't want me back.<eos> At all.<eos> Oh, she... she didn't?
We had some good years.<eos> And then pop got sick and died, and they sent me back.<eos> You know all about that, Harry.<eos> You know all about the darkness, don't you?<eos> I do.
What do you want, Cromwell?<eos> Well, I hear that she's telling people that if the King marries Lady Anne, he has only a year to reign.<eos> I just wondered who is controlling her.<eos> She may be a simple country girl but she has a genuine gift.<eos> She does, doesn't she?
In Jerusalem.<eos> So, how do we kill it?<eos> I do not know.<eos> Well, how did you kill it?<eos> We did not.
- Cat, don't do this...<eos> - No! I am...<eos> I am sick of hearing about how wonderful Mom is, how special Mom is, how much good Mom did.<eos> You don't know what she did, Heather.<eos> None of you do.
So, saddle up.<eos> What does this guy Peterson have on you?<eos> Why do you ask?<eos> Because you're acting like he has something on you.<eos> He doesn't.
I'm not saying he should have called you that.<eos> You're not...<eos> Latin.<eos> - You don't understand.<eos> - No. No, I don't.
Sneaking around, trying not to get caught.<eos> This is the best we're gonna do.<eos> You need to listen to me, okay?<eos> - I have more to lose than you do.<eos> - No, you don't.
That sick bastard.<eos> What is it?<eos> Our daughter's name.<eos> I didn't know you had kids.<eos> We don't.
You look like a movie star.<eos> Get the fuck in the car.<eos> It's good to have you back, brother.<eos> You came through for me.<eos> Of course I did.
What's that doing there?<eos> But...<eos> You told me you like sukiyaki.<eos> - I didn't.<eos> - Yes, you did.
These murder scenes are re-creations of their deaths.<eos> This is the second time in 24 hours that I've been called a liar.<eos> First you're the liar, now me.<eos> You lived this moment.<eos> You both did.
Wow.<eos> You lied like a pro.<eos> I bet he can't tell when you're faking it.<eos> Come on.<eos> We all do it.
Looking for something to treat a headache.<eos> Headaches can be caused by blood vessel abnormalities or brain tumors.<eos> How do you know that?<eos> I don't know. I...<eos> I just do.
You don't feel it.<eos> Your consciousness is too small to comprehend it.<eos> I feel the emptiness of messages bombarding me, telling me to consume.<eos> I feel like there's something lacking in my life, and I feel like you might have the answer.<eos> I do.
Well, technically, he wasn't my superior,<eos> - and I didn't feel pressured.<eos> - It was an inappropriate relationship according to department policy, was it not?<eos> How does filing a harassment complaint undermine his statement about what happened in the garage?<eos> It doesn't.
It's gonna be all fancy, and you love fundraisers.<eos> Um, I...<eos> What?<eos> Brenna, I know before I left, we were thinking my parents would forget about what happened and they wouldn't care if we saw each other.<eos> But they still do.
I tell her that she is.<eos> And I believe that she will be okay.<eos> But I can't control what happens.<eos> - I mean, you know...<eos> - I do.
There's no last hurrah, is there?<eos> No, every day is the last hurrah.<eos> You have to go.<eos> You know that.<eos> I do.
And what's great, dimples...<eos> Dom...<eos> Domples, is that we can be friends now, because I have nothing to worry about.<eos> You don't want April back.<eos> - I do.
Jeez, can't a girl collapse at her own wedding without everyone getting all worked up?<eos> I'm okay.<eos> Just been a crazy day.<eos> I heard about your fight with Leo.<eos> - You did? - Yeah.
On behalf of the club, we're so glad to have our first "B".<eos> Wait.<eos> You're bi?<eos> Oh. I thought you were gay.<eos> Yeah, I did, too.
An eye for an eye, I say.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Anyway, this is a conversation for another time.<eos> But speaking of government, did you know that Simon was class president?<eos> Oh, yeah. Yeah, I did.
What happened to you?<eos> Are you okay?<eos> I don't know; I've never been beaten up before.<eos> Wait, how did you know I was here?<eos> I didn't.
No, I know.<eos> And they did.<eos> It wasn't until it hit me that we might not get a real wedding that I realized that I might want one.<eos> Do you?<eos> Yeah, I do.
- Why?<eos> - To learn that my eldest child is a child no more and quite tough enough to run this estate.<eos> Indeed, she could clearly run the kingdom, should she be called upon to do so.<eos> Well, I hope you mean that.<eos> I do.
- What'd I miss?<eos> Federales got intel that Lobos is planning on meeting his distributor tomorrow at 1:00 in a warehouse on the West Side.<eos> SAXE: So we need every roof, window, and door covered until tactical enters the access point and secures Lobos.<eos> How do we know the info's legit?<eos> We don't.
You wanted the king dead, so just tell us how you did it.<eos> If I knew he was heir to the throne of Urkesh, you think I would have poisoned him, like a woman?<eos> No need to get sexist, pal.<eos> I would have stabbed him in the heart with a knife and told him to rot in hell for what he did.<eos> What exactly did he do?
You don't have to split anything if you steal it.<eos> You know, I could see a big guy like you handling a harpoon.<eos> Why would I kill him?<eos> Rick was the only one that knew where the gold was.<eos> Now nobody does.
I, uh, requested it from the Explorer's Club.<eos> It was found on the shipwreck that Rick discovered.<eos> I know. You know?<eos> Yeah, I read it on your Explorer's Cub journal here, right?<eos> They did a whole photo spread and everything.
Now, I'll be very happy to take your bracelet back to my lab to get an exact analysis.<eos> I hope you have a lawyer.<eos> I guess I did leave that mark.<eos> But I didn't kill her.<eos> Eddie did.
Yeah, I think he's getting impatient with me.<eos> Having trouble narrowing down a place?<eos> No, it's just, things are... Well, they're moving so fast.<eos> And... you're afraid you don't like him?<eos> No, I-I-I'm afraid that I do.
They're all yours.<eos> Sheriff.<eos> Think I just found something.<eos> I think we're going to love it here, Abraham.<eos> I really do.
He was gonna kill her, Abe.<eos> I'm sure of it.<eos> Further proof... Adam is a complete psychopath.<eos> We know this.<eos> If only Jo did.
I got just what you need.<eos> A little bit of down, and a whole lot of up.<eos> Why don't you come inside?<eos> Maybe next time.<eos> What kind of drug does that?
'Mary Marriott, sir.<eos> 'Uh-huh. - 'And you are a bathing woman?<eos> - Yes, sir. '<eos> Do you know Sir Richard and Lady Worsley?<eos> Yes, I do.
I get the distinct feeling these memories have purpose.<eos> How is he alive?<eos> We saw him die on the battlefield.<eos> We saw him die.<eos> Nobody here did.
You have to do something.<eos> - I'll be back here with a court order.<eos> Our lawyers will have one too.<eos> Guess we all know what your word is worth, don't we, Detective?<eos> What did you do, Walt?
Dry ice is frozen carbon dioxide.<eos> Oh, look who paid attention in chemistry.<eos> Oh, serious crush on my teacher, Mr. Brewer.<eos> That man knew his way around a Bunsen burner, if you know what I mean.<eos> No, I don't.
- Absolutely.<eos> - Also, the entirety of their recent stumbles with Homicide, with Intersite, with the very decision to pursue video instead of more pioneering applications.<eos> This was all rooted in human error, which is why I found it prudent to secure Hanneman's shares, his voting rights, and most critically, his board seats.<eos> Right. Russ has two board seats.<eos> He did.
I mean, think about it.<eos> Any Evo who turns on his own, can you ever really trust them?<eos> I trusted you.<eos> And I liked you, Noah.<eos> I still do.
She's a tenacious little construct.<eos> Hunt it down and kill it.<eos> And bring me Otomo.<eos> How did you--how did you know that wasn't me?<eos> Oh, I didn't.
I am gonna freeze to death out here, and my husband and my kids are trying to call me, and they can't reach me, and they're just gonna hold out hope until some soybean farmer finds my partially thawed corpse in the spring.<eos> Oh... my... God.<eos> You didn't even notice I was gone, did you?<eos> ! - What? - We were so worried.<eos> - I didn't...
Oh... my... God.<eos> You didn't even notice I was gone, did you?<eos> ! - What? - We were so worried.<eos> - I didn't...<eos> - Of course we did.
Another handful there.<eos> I honestly have no idea what it all adds up to.<eos> The program has been effective, sir.<eos> I believe it should be continued.<eos> You do?
-He loves the crown. -But...<eos> -And his hair.<eos> -But... -Not in that order.<eos> -But if not Roland, then there has to be someone else!<eos> No, there doesn't.
He knows you.<eos> Told us all about you and your secret mission.<eos> No, no, no, no.<eos> I don't have any secrets.<eos> I don't. I don't.
- ♪ And I love you ♪ - I know.<eos> - ♪ I mean I love you ♪<eos> - Yes. Thanks.<eos> - ♪ I said I love you ♪<eos> - You did.
You were a bit of a mess, sir.<eos> A big, hot mess.<eos> Well, that's the least of our problems.<eos> I think I might have ruined our only chance, and now I don't know what to do.<eos> Good thing I do.
I suspect he ordered Concetta's husband Fabrizi to burn down Nonna Luisa's restaurant.<eos> And I'm guessing he had an alibi for that.<eos> Several.<eos> Well, at least we know how this whole thing began.<eos> We do?
That all came out of the restaurant account.<eos> This was her personal one.<eos> Another one of her secrets.<eos> What did you say you were up to last night?<eos> I didn't.
Give it a go.<eos> Oh, you've got really soft hands.<eos> - Can you just put it in the ice water?<eos> Cold will contract it. - Yeah, that's what we want.<eos> No, we don't.
I have to go. - Abe.<eos> Take it.<eos> I'm using Hewlett to get around Mary.<eos> She thinks I'm in New York studying the law.<eos> - Everyone does.
What in God's name...?<eos> - Dr. Charles Hallum?<eos> - Uh... Sorry to interrupt, but you have something I need.<eos> A bust of the king commissioned from a Miss Patience Wright in London. But I don't have it.<eos> I... I never did.
Coming to the city to see Wicked.<eos> I live in Ronkonkoma. And you came by yourself?<eos> I was supposed to meet a girlfriend.<eos> (Benson) Supposed to?<eos> So you didn't?
'Cause I am so over it.<eos> ♪ No longer down, I'm moving up higher... ♪ You look good, Keem.<eos> Mature and so handsome.<eos> You know, you got to switch up your style sometime, you know what I'm saying?<eos> Yes, I do.
Well, I want to be at Empire, but I want it to be how it was.<eos> You mean...<eos> You and me.<eos> Look, if she can forgive you, then... Maybe you can forgive me and we can be together again.<eos> I do...
She'll be angry you didn't take care of your phone, but she'll get over it.<eos> You know that.<eos> It's my fault.<eos> I have to take responsibility.<eos> Yes, you do.
No, thank you.<eos> You don't want a story, Tom?<eos> Those boys don't have daddies, either.<eos> You know, your daddy loves you very much.<eos> No, he does not.
You don't want a story, Tom?<eos> Those boys don't have daddies, either.<eos> You know, your daddy loves you very much.<eos> No, he does not.<eos> Of course he does.
He's not coming.<eos> - I told you.<eos> - Why isn't he coming?<eos> Daddy's not coming, Daddy's not coming.<eos> I didn't, um... I...
I'm so scared.<eos> I just... couldn't keep going with the chemo.<eos> I fucked up.<eos> - I should've kept fighting.<eos> - You did.
No, I mean, if you're saying it's great, then it must be great, I just... you don't really seem like you're...<eos> I just wish that you wouldn't have inserted yourself into this situation.<eos> They had it all figured out.<eos> I didn't insert myself into anything.<eos> Yes, you kind of did.
Okay, right, right, but how many people?<eos> - Joel.<eos> - Sorry.<eos> - It's... no, it's just... - Okay.<eos> But just for the record, I didn't...
We'll do it next week.<eos> He's gonna be there. He's gonna be there.<eos> Don't worry about it.<eos> Don't cry.<eos> I don't...
And we'll work here together as well.<eos> I think we can do it.<eos> You do?<eos> I do.<eos> I really do.
What?<eos> Uh... uh...<eos> It's a romantic comedy.<eos> Oh, I'll have to see that one.<eos> Yeah, oh, y-you definitely do.
Okay? We can't help it.<eos> We find you irresistible.<eos> You...<eos> I can't believe you guys think I'm handsome.<eos> We don't.
Joseph.<eos> Hi.<eos> [Sighs] I know things got off to a bad start with us.<eos> But... I still feel like we have a chance.<eos> - You do?
You are to me.<eos> You know, I am going to go and put this beautiful necklace on right now.<eos> Oh, you outdid yourself, padre.<eos> Come here.<eos> You sure did, padre.
An entire month's rent?<eos> I'm sorry, but I don't feel very "secure"<eos> just giving away money I might not get back.<eos> Oh, you definitely won't get it back, bro.<eos> Nobody does.
No, this doesn't have anything to do with Callie.<eos> There are other things going on in my life, you know.<eos> I'm protesting.<eos> In case you've forgot, you fired my favorite teacher yesterday.<eos> I didn't...
Um... [clears throat] ... I... saw Ana at my dad's.<eos> Moms aren't gonna take her baby.<eos> - Did she tell you that?<eos> - No, I don't think she knows yet.<eos> Or maybe she does.
But I am also the hottest one.<eos> Yes, you are also the hottest one.<eos> - The pizza party? !<eos> - Oh, my gosh, Eddie. You won?<eos> No, Cindy Horowitz did.
I'm thrilled for you.<eos> Bomb at City Park.<eos> Got your old bosses written all over it.<eos> I don't know anything.<eos> Yes, you do.
What if Abigail had turned on that kid's family?<eos> You want another situation like what happened in Memphis?<eos> - Stop it.<eos> - Look, okay, I'm sorry.<eos> I didn't...
Maybe we just leave him here.<eos> That's not who you are.<eos> I know.<eos> Hey.<eos> You don't.
Will you do that for me?<eos> I'll take care of that one.<eos> Michonne, you take point.<eos> I know it's how it is.<eos> I do.
Michonne, you take point.<eos> I know it's how it is.<eos> I do.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I do, too.
Yes, I do, or someone else will get hurt.<eos> Someone whose life still matters.<eos> No, your life matters.<eos> No.<eos> No, it doesn't.
No.<eos> Please never let this moment end.<eos> - Do you have your video recording device?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Yeah, I do.
I'll try that.<eos> Um, so, look, I mean, you probably don't even want the baby.<eos> I want the baby, Doug.<eos> Okay, well, I know you have to say that in front of people, but between you and me...<eos> You do.
Well, this is leading towards something dangerously misguided.<eos> We'll see how she likes taking care of me for a change.<eos> You probably don't want to get to "Level Two Jimmy drunk"<eos> around all these people.<eos> Or maybe I do.
Thank you.<eos> Salim Sadik?<eos> Hey, I'm looking for this synth.<eos> Oh, when did you bring it in?<eos> I didn't.
The Aether needs a catalyst, a complementary energy to supercharge it.<eos> The same energy it has always needed, love.<eos> The energy it needed when she went in as Lucy and as Sarah.<eos> - I... - You do not have that.<eos> I do.
I wanted us to have more time.<eos> We'll always want more time.<eos> The trick will be being thankful for the time we had.<eos> We had an amazing time.<eos> Yeah, we did.
Do you really believe that that will rekindle the momentum of your doomed Crusade?<eos> I am not here to kill but to confess.<eos> To repent for my sins.<eos> Your wife was not murdered by a Turk assassin.<eos> I did it.
Mmm.<eos> Shut up.<eos> This is just the thing to get your bodies to absorb all these nutrients.<eos> Stop. Stop. Stop.<eos> Don't.
It freaks me out.<eos> Franny, you're 12 years old.<eos> You'll be fine.<eos> Besides, I don't really have much of a choice.<eos> Yes, you do.
No?<eos> At least we're not dead.<eos> Maybe you might wanna tell me where all that money came from?<eos> No. I don't owe you an explanation for anything.<eos> Yes, you do.
She had a gun.<eos> I tried to stop her.<eos> I couldn't.<eos> I believe you.<eos> But you don't, do you?
I couldn't do that to you.<eos> Then drive me into town.<eos> It was the Creekers.<eos> Yeah, I know.<eos> You do? How?
- It's gonna go great tonight. - Mm-hmm.<eos> Why are you being so nice to me?<eos> Because you're letting me. [Chuckles]<eos> (Kevin) Nobody knows what they're saying.<eos> (Lolly) Yes, I totally do.
Thanks.<eos> Hey, let me ask you a weird question.<eos> How'd you know I liked apricot jam?<eos> Everybody likes apricot jam.<eos> No, they don't.
- His leg was on Evelyn's lawn. - Yeah.<eos> I can't see Taylor chopping up a body and throwing the parts all over town.<eos> Yeah, it must've been her lover.<eos> But nobody knows who he is.<eos> - Katy does.
The Man's mama wore that very dress the day she got married.<eos> Ain't it beautiful?<eos> It's real pretty.<eos> You wore it when you got married?<eos> We all done.
He and his wife.<eos> They used the original tissue to make a son.<eos> We find him, we get a bit of DNA, that's all we need.<eos> Did he ever mention a son?<eos> He did, didn't he?
She's not a monster, she was just...<eos> Trained to be a killer.<eos> Does that sound familiar?<eos> How do you know she's even still alive?<eos> I just do.
- Go right? - Yes, right.<eos> Dude, she got it!<eos> Just tell her she's safe, OK? Shut the fuck up.<eos> I took care of that, wanker.<eos> Yeah, man, Boxer, he really did.
I know that.<eos> And I love that you get to do what you love.<eos> Really?<eos> 'Cause it doesn't sound like you're supporting me at all.<eos> Oh, God, you didn't?
You used my deafness?<eos> She needed to know your story.<eos> She knows I'm deaf.<eos> But she probably doesn't know the extent of the extra challenges you face.<eos> She does.
I'm sorry, I didn't even know who to call.<eos> I have no idea who I even...<eos> You need to pull it together.<eos> If you shot an armed intruder, this is going to get hairy.<eos> But you didn't do anything wrong.
Very strong.<eos> It's one of the ironies of this work that so many lives depend upon one man's relationship with an adolescent girl.<eos> You don't like that.<eos> She's 15 years old.<eos> Do you?
I mean, this, all of this, we-we hope this demonstrates how Kaan and Associates can help your company to really reach its apotheosis.<eos> So, let's just do this.<eos> Let's regroup tomorrow, and we will present you with our very detailed brand strategy.<eos> I think... I-I think you're going to be amazed.<eos> I really do.
He's not listening, you know?<eos> Doug,<eos> I don't even like absinthe, and I will drink anything that makes me forget.<eos> Do you know what Oscar Wilde said about absinthe?<eos> I do.
Why do you refuse to accept what you've seen with your own eyes...<eos> That we shared a vision?<eos> - I don't know what that was.<eos> - Yes, you do.<eos> In your heart, you do.
We want to make a break for it, but we need to get organized.<eos> I know you can help.<eos> Don't you want to get out of here?<eos> No.<eos> I do not.
- They're at chicago pd.<eos> What's the latest with terrance?<eos> - Uh... Still on the machine.<eos> - Hey, uh... You want to hear How dawson found brett and mills?<eos> - Yeah, yeah i do.
A second unsub.<eos> Do you think Allen pissed off a partner who decided to take him out?<eos> Only one way to find out.<eos> We know you planted the bomb at the coffee shop because you wanted to be a hero, but you had nothing to do with the one at your house last night.<eos> Who did?
This thing must have cost you a fortune.<eos> Oh, no, baby, when it comes to our love, money is no object.<eos> And I used your Black Card to buy it.<eos> Have a great day.<eos> You did...?
Robust.<eos> Fancy-ass words for fat.<eos> Baby, I think you're perfect.<eos> You know I love that sexy body.<eos> - Oh, you do, do you?
I thought it best if we take some time.<eos> I've been through this before with my ex-wife, and I, uh...<eos> I just didn't want Lauren getting hurt because of me.<eos> Do you really think this is someone that I know?<eos> Yeah, we do.
I was abused.<eos> I'm damaged goods.<eos> Lord, they pick up on them labels, don't they?<eos> Yes, ma'am. Little pitchers have big ears.<eos> They still do.
The paint.<eos> Last night.<eos> The can... Just knocked it over.<eos> Well, these... These things happen.<eos> No, they don't.
Too petrified to sleep.<eos> Do you know what happens to someone, when they don't sleep?<eos> - To their mind?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - You do?
Whoo!<eos> Oh!<eos> Baby, it's me! Oh, baby!<eos> Do you really think I had Grady murdered?<eos> I did.
I found her truck some down the road, abandoned.<eos> No sign beyond.<eos> Gotta suck, be that close to the prize, have it shot out of your hand.<eos> - I kinda know how you feel.<eos> - No, you don't.
Dad, in love?<eos> No.<eos> Yes.<eos> He told me so.<eos> Not explicitely, but he did.
I don't see Alvis.<eos> - Alvis couldn't make it. He's...<eos> - I know where he is, Auntie.<eos> It still doesn't explain why I should trust you.<eos> Because Alvis does.
I'm just the investigator.<eos> Who's suing me?<eos> Barlow Connally.<eos> Frankly, I don't care...<eos> No, I don't!
No history of vience.<eos> She just lost it.<eos> Like Jason.<eos> Rebecca asked mom if Fry Girl drank Max Rager.<eos> She did. Tons of it.
I'm at the hospital.<eos> Minx has the same thing Henry does.<eos> Oh, I'm sorry. She have a fever?<eos> It's not just her.<eos> They all do.
- Who's this guy?<eos> - 300,000!<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> Jeffrey you know, ordinarily I'd do anything you say.<eos> Do it.
What was so special about this Troy person?<eos> Did he own a rainbow?<eos> Was he the group's pharmacist?<eos> We don't like to talk about it.<eos> But you often do.
We can walk down the street holding hands.<eos> If I take a job tricking people into buying things they don't want.<eos> Do you enjoy billboards and commercials, Miss Perry?<eos> You mean shill-boards and con-mercials?<eos> No, I don't.
In the new Play Dough movie, is that right?<eos> Maybe, you know, maybe.<eos> But like I always say, you know, life is a roller coaster.<eos> You were a teacher at a community college in Colorado.<eos> Did you just...
I heard it was banned.<eos> Well, you can't believe everything you hear.<eos> Okay, you just asked if I heard something and now you're invalidating the whole.<eos> Do you know why I beat you, Todd?<eos> Seriously, you don't?
It's true, what he said.<eos> If you guys lower your guns, I'm not gonna throw you a party, but I'm not going to get anyone fired either.<eos> I'll see you Monday, idiots.<eos> So who wins?<eos> What do we-.
He changed the game.<eos> I assume it's bad he was talking to the game designer?<eos> Ralph made a suggestion that helped modify the game.<eos> Do you know how that's gonna look to Eckherd when he finds out?<eos> Ralph did nothing wrong.
Oh, seriously, why do we have two birthdays so close together?<eos> We didn't.<eos> Brick, listen... Um, I don't even know if you're aware of this, but, um, it's come to my attention that it's possible we might have missed your birthday.<eos> Oh, you did.<eos> You definitely did.
Uh, I'm not embarrassed about dating her, 'cause I never dated her!<eos> Stop talking.<eos> She could be listening.<eos> I can't believe we forgot Brick's birthday.<eos> We do this all the time, and now we did it on his 13th birthday.
Great.<eos> Well, you smell clean.<eos> I suppose you washed your genitals real nice for her?<eos> - Carol, come on. - Phil.<eos> Yes, I did.
Okay, but this one only has Cake Bosses on it.<eos> Okay, great. - Spoiler alert...<eos> - Oh, no, no, I don't want to...<eos> - The cake...<eos> - Don't.
I protected the president once.<eos> Thank you for allowing me to feel useful again.<eos> I wish I could say I wouldn't forget it, but, uh...<eos> There's advancements in neurological science every year. You never know.<eos> Yes, I do.
Make as many great memories as you can.<eos> 'Cause at the end of the day, we don't get to decide the ones we keep, huh?<eos> Lorraine?<eos> !<eos> H-How did you...?
- It's for your own good.<eos> There, that's settled.<eos> Thank you.<eos> - Do you believe him? - Yes.<eos> I do.
We'll be in touch.<eos> Well, that was fun.<eos> Thank God you covered.<eos> I didn't have much of a choice.<eos> Actually, you did.
- sentient strigoi.<eos> - Jesus Christ.<eos> I'm pretty sure Zack saw her.<eos> You need to talk to him.<eos> Maybe he didn't.
But then Josh, he called off his wedding because of me!<eos> Which means he has feelings for me!<eos> For me!<eos> Oh, no, no, no. No, no, no, no.<eos> No, it doesn't.
How we gonna get home?<eos> Sean!<eos> We'll get home, bruv.<eos> How do you know?<eos> Because I do.
Dios mío, this is an insane world.<eos> I thought I was joining with this group for my own security, not to kill innocent civilians.<eos> Trust me.<eos> - Where's the sub now? Where'd he go?<eos> - I don't...
Am I not good enough?<eos> Myung-ae, I'm sorry.<eos> I didn't know you felt that way.<eos> I always appreciated your dedication...<eos> Mootaek did too.
I shouldn't have sprung it on you like that.<eos> Oh, no, no, no, no.<eos> It had just been a really emotional day.<eos> The big "I love Ben" announcement.<eos> And you really do, right?
Well, yeah, that's one perspective.<eos> It just seems like you have feelings for each other.<eos> And you're right.<eos> We do.<eos> We do?
It's a CIA front!<eos> Still, though.<eos> Why don't you go read the damn dossier?<eos> Read about the communist insurgency.<eos> I don't do dossiers.
Because you also need my help.<eos> Only because you just broke two of my ribs, in addition to impaling me on a bamboo stake, on which, I think we both know, you smeared some poop!<eos> I-- And if you did I don't wanna know!<eos> Because... you'd have no idea what you're supposed to be looking for!<eos> Not that I do, necessarily, but--
Uh, no, I merely implied that.<eos> I have no idea where it is.<eos> Although...<eos> Ah, so you did know.<eos> No, I totally didn't.
- He's an undergrad. - So what?<eos> He needs to take responsibility for what he puts in his fucking paper.<eos> Oh, my God, stop being this guy.<eos> You are not this guy. I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> Yeah, you do.
No women on the railroad, plain and simple.<eos> The men will ask questions.<eos> I'll keep a tight lip, but that's as far as I go with this.<eos> Now light the damn fuse.<eos> She does good work.
I tried to stop myself before I said it, sorry.<eos> This is happening in Portland?<eos> Well, if this has anything to do with Wesen fertility, I'll bet you Monroe and Rosalee know something about it.<eos> We need to talk.<eos> Do we?
No, I'm sorry, I can't.<eos> Wait, I need to know something.<eos> What?<eos> How much of that blood money do you get?<eos> Oh, no, you don't.
It's our last chance to try. Our last chance to save Max.<eos> What's the point of saving him?<eos> We're never getting out of here. Leo.<eos> We don't know what will happen.<eos> Neither does Hobb.
After you get cut, do you really not remember anything?<eos> It's not even me.<eos> It is, it's just a part of you you don't want to face.<eos> How can I control it?<eos> You don't.
I'm leaving, Waldo, with Veil.<eos> She's pregnant.<eos> So what?<eos> I imagine I've got a dozen pups pissing on posts around here.<eos> Every Clipper does.
You were the last one in the tunnel today.<eos> Yes.<eos> That special book, the one on my desk, you didn't see it, did you?<eos> No, Mother, I'm sorry.<eos> I didn't.
I am.<eos> Will you rededicate yourself to a spiritual path?<eos> I will.<eos> Do you promise never to leave again?<eos> I do.
There's a thing inside you.<eos> Your cure will come with the number three.<eos> I didn't know where you were.<eos> You knew I'd be back.<eos> No, I didn't.
Stacey, Mr. Peterson and I go way back.<eos> Thank you.<eos> How was your little trip down to Rio Bravo?<eos> You know about that?<eos> Of course I do.
Something's obviously going on, and I'm here to protest my exclusion.<eos> Vega.<eos> Jane is planning something, and I'm pretty sure it has to do with whatever's going on with Abbott.<eos> Don't worry about it.<eos> I do, though.
I know. I know too, Mother.<eos> I know too, because I remember everything about that night.<eos> I've gone over and over it a thousand times in my head.<eos> I didn't black out.<eos> I didn't do anything wrong.
I've gone over and over it a thousand times in my head.<eos> I didn't black out.<eos> I didn't do anything wrong.<eos> - I know.<eos> - I did not.
- No!<eos> What makes us not animals is that we make choices.<eos> You can't help what you think, what your impulses are.<eos> We all have crazy ones.<eos> I do.
What do you mean?<eos> We're lucky we got away with our lives.<eos> Tell me what happened.<eos> - You know what happened.<eos> - No, I don't.
♪ Am I beautiful ♪ - Clear. - ♪ Even at my ugliest, you always say ♪<eos> Clear.<eos> ♪ I'm beautiful ♪ We found Rentman's tree house, uh, a bunker under, uh...<eos> Who knows?<eos> I do.
I'm gonna be late for work.<eos> Just one game.<eos> How about that shower now?<eos> I see you.<eos> Yeah, I do.
- I don't know.<eos> I told him it had to be a superior.<eos> I guess Suger just connected the dots.<eos> All the way to the murder.<eos> Raffi, did you...
We could, or...<eos> I know a fantastic hot spring about 15 minutes up the road.<eos> We could hike.<eos> Oh, well, we don't have our bathing suits.<eos> Neither did Adam and Eve.
I don't have great taste.<eos> So what?<eos> I'm just giving you a hard time.<eos> I knew that.<eos> No, you didn't.
That's not a choice you get to make.<eos> We get what the SVR needs, or they go after Alex directly.<eos> What words do you need me to say, Mark?<eos> That I didn't cheat on you?<eos> I didn't.
_<eos> Use force against U.S. federal agents in their own country?<eos> This is a line Moscow has never crossed.<eos> I don't think you understand the stakes, Victor.<eos> I do.
- Hey.<eos> - Hi, Joe-Joe.<eos> - Hi.<eos> - Do you have an iPhone 4 charger?<eos> No, I don't.
So I'm just supposed to trust-<eos> You. Yes.<eos> Why would you in the future endanger you in the now?<eos> That makes no sense.<eos> No, it doesn't, does it?
Get back up in here!<eos> Let's go, let's go!<eos> He's out!<eos> You really think you're worth it?<eos> Somebody does.
This place is a write-off.<eos> Like my dream of going home.<eos> You can't give up now.<eos> We don't have Brad.<eos> Well, apparently we never did.
- with the males carrying the eggs?<eos> - Oh.<eos> It's about time.<eos> - You did not know that.<eos> - Yes, I did.
It's been redrawn a bunch of times.<eos> How long have you had it?<eos> - [Elevator bell dings] Six months.<eos> - Oh, my god. We should all know better than to bet with Korsak.<eos> Well, I do now. Yeah.
That's pretty common.<eos> An older canvas makes the work seem authentic.<eos> Easier to pass off.<eos> - So this guy knew his stuff.<eos> - They usually do.
A-And she never would've let someone in she didn't trust.<eos> No. And there was no record of a call to set up a meeting.<eos> Well, unless she had a burner and they took that, too.<eos> Janie, I-I don't want to believe that she was crooked.<eos> Nobody does.
- Hmm.<eos> "I'd ri..." Oh, Winston's the naughty.<eos> Yeah. Mm-hmm.<eos> - God, I love cowboys.<eos> - Who doesn't?
me, Maura, Mom.<eos> And Mom has decided that she should move in with me so that you can live with Maura.<eos> - Okay. That works.<eos> - No, no, no!<eos> It does not!
You never told us you were dating Ten Mohs.<eos> - A lot of people dated Ten Mohs.<eos> - Yes, but Karina was a threat.<eos> She loved him.<eos> - So did you.
What you say cannot fit in this room.<eos> When I was 14, my best friend, uh, Carice Jaquard... she lived next door.<eos> And one day, she didn't show up for school.<eos> So on my way home, I thought I would stop by, see if she wanted to know what the homework was.<eos> Mnh, she didn't.
Maura, I live in a 2x3 room in order to avoid living with my mother.<eos> You were a child, and he put you in a terrible position.<eos> But it was so long ago.<eos> You want me to shoot him?<eos> - I do.
You were a child, and he put you in a terrible position.<eos> But it was so long ago.<eos> You want me to shoot him?<eos> - I do.<eos> I really do. - Okay.
We slip backstage using Duke and catch them off guard in their own turf?<eos> - Mm-hmm.<eos> - Hey.<eos> Want to go undercover?<eos> Yes, he does.
- Mm-hmm.<eos> - Hey.<eos> Want to go undercover?<eos> Yes, he does.<eos> He does.
She didn't want to move Duke away from his home and training facility.<eos> Million dollars is a lot of motive.<eos> The only problem with that is I found her will in the house.<eos> The daughters don't stand to inherit the estate.<eos> - The dog does.
Sure everyone feels safe now.<eos> - Window!<eos> - All right!<eos> Circle around the back.<eos> - How you doing?
Could I just have the hot sauce?<eos> Give me that sack.<eos> Give me that goddamned sack!<eos> Why are you acting like the last four months didn't mean anything?<eos> - Because they didn't.
- I'm sorry.<eos> I am.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> So listen, you told me... that if I ever needed anything I should come to you.<eos> Did I?
To cut the opponent you detest into pieces? !<eos> Will you feel satisfaction from crushing him under your feet?<eos> You may have taken that form, but you're just a human obsessed with revenge!<eos> Everyone has a some darkness in him!<eos> Ren-kun does, too! Me, too!
People weren't willing to give us a chance.<eos> - How can we assume the worst of this child?<eos> - Still..<eos> We don't know what's really going on.<eos> Nobody does.
I just checked myself out of a mental hospital.<eos> I'm not kidding.<eos> I wouldn't do that to you.<eos> Zombies really do exist.<eos> They do.
For contacting your dodgy friends.<eos> For scheming and maneuvering and setting things in motion.<eos> I have no use for it. Yes, you do.<eos> I'm sorry, love, but you don't get to sit this one out.<eos> None of us do.
What?<eos> If anybody knows about castor, it's going to be her.<eos> I'm not authorized.<eos> I'm not even supposed to know where she is.<eos> Yeah, but you do, don't you?
I'm safe.<eos> No one needs to know.<eos> No, no. This is a business relationship.<eos> If this has become something else in your head... maybe you're grasping at something you never had.<eos> I did, though, didn't I?
Okay, yeah, all right, okay, I hear you.<eos> Come in.<eos> That looks like it hurts.<eos> You should see the other guy.<eos> I did.
Ferdinand.<eos> You scared the shite outta me.<eos> I thought that you were going to call me if Siobhan Sadler ever came to town.<eos> We had an understanding.<eos> Yeah, we did.
We can keep them separated for now, but, um, this rivalry seems to be problematic.<eos> Well, there's nothing wrong with a little healthy competition.<eos> Yeah, I think the key word there is "healthy."<eos> And, uh, Tammy over there doesn't seem to know when to stop.<eos> No, she doesn't.
And, honey, you look pretty.<eos> I also have a berry cobbler, so I hope everybody saved plenty of room.<eos> Oh! Before I met Judith, I didn't know it was possible to go up two pants sizes in one meal.<eos> He's always teasing me, this one.<eos> So how did you two...
I'm sorry, Jo.<eos> I thought it was Friday.<eos> Is that nightie new?<eos> It looks pretty on you.<eos> Doesn't it, Graham?
I'm looking for the same thing.<eos> I have no idea how to find it.<eos> You don't think you've changed?<eos> No. No.<eos> I do.
- You are?<eos> - Yes.<eos> In college I had a thing for all my professors.<eos> So did I. I loved them.<eos> But I never did anything about it.
You said to follow my bliss.<eos> I said a Volt or a Prius.<eos> You willfully misheard me.<eos> Well, I think it's a super cool car, Walter.<eos> I really do.
You're lying.<eos> You and Father can bring the Palace down around you for all I care.<eos> I will wait here for you.<eos> Come back, okay?<eos> But if you don't...
It has nothing to do with her.<eos> I'm staying here because I want to make the case of me playing a role in the future of Abuddin.<eos> What does that mean?<eos> I can't say yet.<eos> If I did...
Oh, please.<eos> With the sales pitch.<eos> It's a classic piece of junk, that car.<eos> You know what that car means to me.<eos> Uh-huh. Do you not?
_<eos> Lily.<eos> Mom said I could have it!<eos> - Flashlight...<eos> - No, she didn't!
You might as well have accused General Horemheb of treason.<eos> He's the greatest general Egypt has ever known.<eos> Is that how you earn the army's trust?<eos> No.<eos> I do so on the battlefield with you by my side.
We understand.<eos> You were in law enforcement yourself, is that right, Mr. Radchenko?<eos> Yes, I was.<eos> Now you'll ask me if I have any theory about who did this terrible thing?<eos> Do you?
Find out who that someone is.<eos> What memory?<eos> A memory she has no memory of.<eos> You said you had the situation under control.<eos> - I do.
I need to know the truth.<eos> Where is it?<eos> I'll have it to you by 9:00.<eos> I thought you said you had it already.<eos> And I do.
The federal Marshals were called in, and they were standing on the tops of all the buildings downtown with guns.<eos> [Andy] Seated in front of the stage facing the audience was Martin Luther King,<eos> Ralph Bunche from the UN and a lot of other worldwide dignitaries.<eos> [Al] You had Langston Hughes, James Baldwin, Sidney Poitier,<eos> Bill Cosby, Leonard Bernstein, Harry Belafonte, and we did "Mississippi Goddam."
Just 'cause the boss is off ship ain't no excuse to lollygag.<eos> - Keep looking. - All right.<eos> - Ned wants results.<eos> - Yeah, all right.<eos> Don't "all right" me.
If you knew about me, you woulda taken care of me.<eos> And Jude.<eos> I know that.<eos> And it's not that I don't love you.<eos> I do.
It's your lawyer.<eos> Oh, well, that was quite an afternoon, wasn't it?<eos> Yeah...<eos> I just hope you know that everything that Robert does, he does out of love for you.<eos> I do.
If this is true, and Anneca is responsible for hundreds of people's deaths then you and the other high-level executives will be prosecuted.<eos> Reparations can be paid to the alleged victims.<eos> We can fix this.<eos> Reparations are all well and good but the people I represent don't want you to fix it.<eos> - They don't?
I think we need front-channel negotiations.<eos> You should go to Texas and meet with your former boss.<eos> Should we order some dessert?<eos> I hope they still have that strawberry savarin.<eos> And they do!
- That sounds badass.<eos> - No way. Oh, I bet you got a better idea.<eos> Damn right, Gramps was a paratrooper, so we're gonna crenate his body in a bon fire and scatter his ashes from the sky, just like he always wanted.<eos> - I knew you'd have a good idea.<eos> - I didn't.
What's the deal?<eos> You're just gonna sit here the whole time?<eos> Hey, stop!<eos> - Lay on, peasant.<eos> - Don't.
W-What?<eos> Come on, "unfriend" isn't even a word.<eos> - Why would you...<eos> - Do you really want to be in the middle of this?<eos> No, I really don't.
(knock on door)<eos> Hey.<eos> Why didn't you call me?<eos> Did my mom come down to the station?<eos> She did.
So critical to any stellar Shakespearean production.<eos> The lighting was really good.<eos> Another aspect typically overlooked by most audiences.<eos> You didn't like it.<eos> No, I didn't.
Point her out to the jury, please.<eos> She's in the third row.<eos> She's wearing a blue dress.<eos> Does Mrs. Marin work for you?<eos> She did, she doesn't anymore.
It's just my face.<eos> Sometimes it does things without checking with me first.<eos> Well, it sounded like she deserved what happened to her, and I don't believe that.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Nobody does.
I answer, you could charge me with accessory.<eos> Yeah, and if you don't, I charge you with impeding an investigation.<eos> I told him not to do it.<eos> I told him I didn't want no part of it.<eos> None of us did.
Move!<eos> - Rockwell!<eos> - He has a knife in the car!<eos> I don't have a clear shot.<eos> I do.
- Don't listen to him. He's lying!<eos> I suppose there's no delicate way to say this.<eos> Dr Pryce is going through the classic stages of drug withdrawal.<eos> I had no idea how bad his addiction had become.<eos> People rarely do.
I wouldn't even know what to do.<eos> Doesn't matter what you do. Only that you do.<eos> And you have my solemn word, this is not going on your permanent record.<eos> I can't.<eos> I don't even...
You might want to hire some protection.<eos> What are you guys doing over there?<eos> Air quality sensors.<eos> So, got any veggie burgers?<eos> As a matter of fact, we do.
These women are warriors.<eos> They live by the code of the ancient Amazon.<eos> A sisterhood that had each other's backs.<eos> Wow, I wish I had that.<eos> You do!
- Stop.<eos> No, it is.<eos> - Like all the time. - Ah!<eos> - Banging and banging.<eos> - No, don't!
Funny.<eos> I've never eaten anyone I didn't want to eat.<eos> You did this to me!<eos> Liv.<eos> Don't!
Now just try to retrace your steps.<eos> Well, I wasn't in the sofa cushions.<eos> Agh!<eos> Well, you could have said that!<eos> I did.
Which are in turn full of shit.<eos> Sorry?<eos> She just had a baby.<eos> Ya know...<eos> I didn't.
If I didn't know any better, I'd say this guy's been branded.<eos> All right, so somebody comes in here, try to make this thing look like an overdose.<eos> I'm assuming whoever did this did not want us to tie this kid to Julius Brennan.<eos> Yeah, well...<eos> Well, that scar just did.
He used to go away all the time, but this time, he's...<eos> He's gone, and I know he's gone.<eos> And the bed feels lonely.<eos> It's like I don't know how to sleep alone.<eos> You don't.
- And she gave me her umbrella. - It had a hole in it.<eos> I was soaked.<eos> So you have all the same memories?<eos> Yeah, Lucas and Lucy, they share the same neural programming.<eos> - They all do.
- It had a hole in it.<eos> I was soaked.<eos> So you have all the same memories?<eos> Yeah, Lucas and Lucy, they share the same neural programming.<eos> - They all do.
- Did they find Terra?<eos> Or Ares.<eos> But I know they're out there somewhere.<eos> How do you know that?<eos> I just do.
If there's another player on the board, I need to know.<eos> Of course, but this brings up the question of your own safety,<eos> Madame Secretary.<eos> I have adequate security.<eos> As did General Shepherd.
- Yeah, simple.<eos> Watch.<eos> What are you saying?<eos> I thought you didn't understand this stuff.<eos> I didn't.
Then why are you willfully and deliberately marching towards your own death?<eos> When I came back from 2nd K, I can't tell you how many nights I would wake up in a cold sweat.<eos> - The nightmares...<eos> - I understand that!<eos> No, you don't!
[Horn blaring]<eos> So...<eos> It's begun.<eos> Thomas: Do you repent your sins?<eos> Stephen: I do.
It's begun.<eos> Thomas: Do you repent your sins?<eos> Stephen: I do.<eos> Do you believe in Jesus Christ, the son of God, who died on the cross and rose again on the third day?<eos> I do.
Beer? Anyone?<eos> Ah, yes, please. Hermann wore me out.<eos> Oh, he will do that to you.<eos> I don't think I have any, actually.<eos> - Oh, yes you do. - Oh.
Love and you've lived."<eos> It's no joke.<eos> I asked if you called them.<eos> Because you don't know the answer.<eos> - I do. Easy.
Exposed wires, electrical fires.<eos> No. I mean being here with me.<eos> You know, if you have someplace else<eos> - you'd rather be...<eos> - I don't.
Pull the ripcord.<eos> - What?<eos> - Well, she's not the one.<eos> If she was, you wouldn't have to ask.<eos> - Yeah, but I didn't even...
We've done the same things.<eos> We've covered up killings.<eos> Yeah, but Conrad was unarmed.<eos> But he destroyed countless lives.<eos> - Kate didn't...
- But, Bruce, he's just...<eos> He's not you, Dick.<eos> Before I took you in, you had loving parents.<eos> You had a heart.<eos> - And he doesn't?
- Shut up. Shut up!<eos> I swear to you we'll find a replacement.<eos> Now, kill him!<eos> Yes, Grandmaster.<eos> Do it!
Are you counting on my son?<eos> 'Cause there's something you should know.<eos> He's never had the nerve to go up against his father.<eos> All right?<eos> He still doesn't.
I'm gonna go back to the azaleas.<eos> What happened to all the stuff that was in here?<eos> Oh...<eos> Del? Why'd you move their stuff?<eos> I didn't.
I'm here, buddy.<eos> Thanks, Jack, you're my best friend.<eos> You want some more of that?<eos> - No.<eos> - He does.
Oh, so you were a client as well as her landlord?<eos> I did a couple readings.<eos> She was incredible.<eos> Really connected, you know?<eos> No, I don't.
Right. So somebody stole your mallet, then killed Justine with it, and then what?<eos> Planted it back on you?<eos> Okay, I shouldn't have lied.<eos> But I was scared that you would think that I killed Justine.<eos> We do.
It happens.<eos> This was the whole reason for the hunting trips and the jet skis, trips to Bali and stuff.<eos> I said to her, "babe, if it's just gonna be us, let's make us an adventure."<eos> But she really wanted a baby.<eos> We both did.
Right this way.<eos> Thanks.<eos> I'm sorry, Mom, Dad.<eos> It's okay, baby.<eos> You didn't do anything wrong.
Morgan was right.<eos> What?<eos> Don't say anything else.<eos> Danny, I know.<eos> - You do?
He was so alive!<eos> Why didn't he tell me?<eos> Dr Slater said Jake didn't want you to know.<eos> What, Karl knew?<eos> Of course he did!
Until I considered another riddle.<eos> And then it all started to make sense.<eos> If the killer had no way out of the workshop, then they had to still be there!<eos> But we'd have seen him.<eos> Oh, but you did.
This sucks.<eos> Marriage sucks.<eos> Correction, love sucks.<eos> You don't believe that.<eos> Yeah, I do.
She thinks Kit came back different this time.<eos> Kind of felt like we were dealing with the same thing.<eos> Kit's been going through some stuff, for sure.<eos> -Um, it takes him a while to get back to normal.<eos> -Thanks. But he always does.
You're in a sweat lodge?<eos> You're the one who said everything's got a weakness. I figure I take a shvitz, kill a freak, call that a good day.<eos> Yeah, if it works.<eos> Ah, well, you got a better idea?<eos> Yeah, I do, actually, Dean.
Now that government's gone made that OG dank legal, taxing it, ain't that a bitch?<eos> Yeah, the government, it's pretty diabolical.<eos> Do you want some ice cream?<eos> - I don't know what you want from me.<eos> - Oh, sure you do, Trey.
- The owner and I, we go way back.<eos> You guys want more bubbly?<eos> - Free champagne. - Yeah!<eos> - We need to talk.<eos> - Oh, we already did.
He broke his collar bone and shattered his arm.<eos> His athletic career is shot.<eos> Scholarships gone.<eos> Did you see Jenny push him?<eos> No one did.
You were in the shower, so I went for a walk, you know?<eos> I was going a little stir crazy.<eos> You can't just leave like that.<eos> What if someone recognized you?<eos> No one did.
He's going to lead them to the tri-state championships next week.<eos> Have you seen his father down here?<eos> No, I would like to though.<eos> A kid like that, he's raised right, you know?<eos> I do.
Run facial recognition.<eos> Donna McKinney, illustrious manager.<eos> Her clients engage in mixed martial arts, which, according to my research, is a competition of sorts to inflict bodily harm on another human in an enclosed cage space.<eos> We all know what MMA is, Max.<eos> - Of course we do.
Sir?<eos> I have to admit some confusion.<eos> Dr. Grace's telegram ascertains that Mr. Graham was indeed poisoned by water hemlock.<eos> Sir, how does that prove that Jagger Brown was seen with Graham in Toronto?<eos> It doesn't, George.
Our only hope to make up for not killing them last time is to bring back the beast, and a very, very special beast.<eos> And the only way to find out if that's<eos> Vincent is to make sure that Cat isn't alive to save him.<eos> I won't let you down.<eos> You never do.
Someone got saddled with a new partner.<eos> I mean, I get that Carol is trying to prove herself as captain, but...<eos> Uh, you mean Tess, right?<eos> That's what I said.<eos> Uh, no, no, you didn't.
What the hell is going on?<eos> I'm saving your life, that's what's going on.<eos> Next time, answer your phone if you want a heads up.<eos> Liam got Alton, didn't he?<eos> Yeah, he did.
That's a good question, actually.<eos> Even if he is telling the truth, he certainly doesn't need Vincent's help breaking into DHS. Right.<eos> I could simply lay waste to any agents who stand in my way.<eos> Which makes Vincent the only one who could save them.<eos> And also responsible for them if he doesn't.
It's okay.<eos> Really.<eos> It's fine. I'm fine.<eos> I just needed to know.<eos> And now I do.
Right.<eos> Where did we get married?<eos> Anglise Mare de Dieu, Iga, 1937, in Basse-Normandie, in the township of Bellame, part of the district...<eos> - I wish I had your memory.<eos> - No, you don't.
But not his.<eos> Because I'll keep fighting.<eos> Finish what he started.<eos> - Sorry.<eos> - Sorry, I didn't...
That's easy.<eos> Nothing.<eos> Ok, so maybe we'll go through all the encounters that you've had with the ghosts, everywhere they've hidden, and places you can cross...<eos> John... We should have discussed this.<eos> Thea and I did.
I just gave him to the nurse.<eos> Baby... she was wearing a uniform.<eos> She said he needed a hearing test.<eos> But I should've known.<eos> And I didn't.
The pulling, how did you do that every day for two years?<eos> Are you ready?<eos> See you later, best friend.<eos> You want to know the best part about knowing who I was?<eos> That Matty did too.
We have a problem with the final delivery.<eos> What happened?<eos> They moved the third chemical to a higher security lab.<eos> I don't have clearance.<eos> The guy who does,
Bad day on the job, my dear?<eos> Half of England wants me gone.<eos> Only the Catholic half.<eos> Well, the rest don't want Mary, but they certainly wish I were a man.<eos> Of course they do, especially your privy council.
- We made a promise.<eos> To do what?<eos> Charge out there, guns blazing?<eos> We don't even know how to kill them.<eos> She does.
And then what happened?<eos> Nothing.<eos> I told her I'd made a mistake and...<eos> And I could never see her again.<eos> And I didn't...
Hey.<eos> I thought we could do Taco night.<eos> What do you think?<eos> Mom, you don't have to cook.<eos> Sure I do.
A royal officer held by our forces.<eos> The crime he's committed most certainly merits death.<eos> Our Connecticut 5th has been awaiting my instructions for a month.<eos> If they do not hear word by tomorrow, they'll assume they have my approval to proceed with the execution.<eos> Well, do they or don't they?
Go on!<eos> Washington: Of all the decisions I make, it is this one which threatens my life and our future.<eos> Shall I pardon a brutal murderer in order to save a failed spy?<eos> What should I do?<eos> You always do the right thing, General.
For a lawful execution to take place, one requires sufficient evidence.<eos> Right, and without evidence you gotta get a confession.<eos> Despite whatever miseries they've heaped upon him,<eos> Woodhull hasn't succumbed.<eos> Neither did the other one.
You see, his word was not just the law.<eos> It was the word of God himself.<eos> Justin was our oracle.<eos> He was our burning bush. - I understand.<eos> - You don't.
You know, David, all this contempt leaves me wondering why you even bothered to come here to warn me about your boss's intentions.<eos> Well, let me be clear.<eos> I don't want this to blow up in her face, and you seem like a shrewd enough operator to keep your mouth shut.<eos> She doesn't need any more enemies in the Senate.<eos> She sure as hell doesn't.
You know what to do.<eos> This is Nick.<eos> You know what to do.<eos> No.<eos> I don't.
You're a stuck up bitch who thinks she's too good for anybody.<eos> Ricky, what are you doing?<eos> Zack was an okay guy, and now he's dead, and I think it's because of you, so I came to get what you never gave him.<eos> No, no, no! You don't know what's gonna happen.<eos> Yeah, I do.
Step in, please.<eos> You spun me.<eos> No. Yeah, you did.<eos> I asked you if Sam had priors.<eos> And he doesn't.
Well, I believe shame is the worst thing a parent can teach their children.<eos> I want my children to be joyful and frank and adventurous.<eos> Like you.<eos> But if parenthood - is something that doesn't interest you... - No.<eos> It does, actually.
I want my children to be joyful and frank and adventurous.<eos> Like you.<eos> But if parenthood - is something that doesn't interest you... - No.<eos> It does, actually.<eos> More so than it does my husband.
That's why I sent for her...<eos> I thought she might want to meet you...<eos> Enough!<eos> You didn't invite her.<eos> I did.
by Nuri Ceylan. I gave it to you.<eos> Why are you sweating so much?<eos> It's so hot.<eos> You wanted another movie too, remember?<eos> I don't!
I've seen movies, read lots of books but can't find a good subject.<eos> Listen, those films are already made, those books already written.<eos> You have to look elsewhere.<eos> It won't come just by itself.<eos> What do I do?
It was your husband, Troy and you.<eos> You can't make me testify against my husband.<eos> There's some law about that, isn't there?<eos> Look, your husband didn't kill Troy Carter.<eos> You did.
Detective Soto, please, sit.<eos> And I hope this can be real quick.<eos> How can I help?<eos> Do you feel you can be completely honest when discussing Detective Diamond's relationship with Captain Broderick?<eos> Yes, I do.
Okay. All right, let's make this quick.<eos> All right, come on.<eos> Agent Thomas was shot through the head, but there were no powder burns, so it couldn't have been from close range.<eos> I still can't work out how the shooter got in here undetected.<eos> Maybe he didn't.
Okay, did you call Lena?<eos> Yeah, she's not answering.<eos> It's okay.<eos> We'll find her.<eos> Jack, what if we don't?
I'm not sure they'll ever be.<eos> So that's it then?<eos> I should just... go back to being a prisoner in my own house?<eos> I don't know, Camille.<eos> Honestly, I don't.
Give me 48 hours.<eos> Done.<eos> Good luck.<eos> We have no idea where that cocaine is.<eos> No, we don't.
They know.<eos> If we were suspects, we would've been hauled in already.<eos> Then they're stalling.<eos> You think he was their only witness?<eos> Yes, I do.
Thanks anyways.<eos> Do me a favor, don't tell any of the others about this, okay?<eos> I thought you had resolved to trust them.<eos> Well, some of them anyway.<eos> Yeah, so did I.
Are you sure you want to wait until it begins?<eos> I can give you an honorable death before it comes to that.<eos> Are you serious?<eos> I'd rather have a dishonorable life.<eos> And you did, by all accounts.
- Stop moving.<eos> - I want you gone.<eos> I want you gone!<eos> The only thing you know is true, Rowan, is that I love you.<eos> - Don't.
You promise you haven't shot up any more of that stuff?<eos> Oh, God.<eos> Please don't tell me this is some intervention.<eos> Only reason I haven't called my candy man yet is 'cause you promised you were bringing something even better.<eos> And I did...
I should go check on David.<eos> So we're clear, I'm not big on sharing my toys.<eos> David's mine.<eos> I don't mean to cause any trouble.<eos> Oh, but girls like you never do.
It's unfortunate that we happened to emerge from FTL within lethal range.<eos> Yeah, right... This is all just bad luck?<eos> We're supposed to believe this?<eos> You think whoever sabotaged the ship timed this malfunction deliberately to put us in this location?<eos> Damn straight I do.
- It's my regular spot.<eos> - Oh, right, you're a local.<eos> Nice.<eos> Don't I know you?<eos> Do you?
- Oh, bugger.<eos> - Alfred.<eos> - You knew, didn't you?<eos> - I didn't know, Alfred.<eos> You did.
I was there, darlin'.<eos> - She might.<eos> - Whatever.<eos> The Pikes hate me and Penguin, for obvious reasons, but... everyone knows Fish loved you.<eos> They do?
They have one victim left.<eos> They're calling him the Son of Gotham.<eos> Did they say anything about Galavan?<eos> - I was not kidnapped by Theo Galavan.<eos> - They didn't, did they?
(Phone chimes) Shoot. Uh...<eos> Ooh, Ruben. Let's see, college graduate, works in marketing, five foot... Eleven!<eos> (Gasps) Oh! Elliot, it looks like we have a match.<eos> Did you know, statistically, cellphones are dirtier than toilet seats?<eos> I did not.
So deaf people shouldn't get hurt on the weekends?<eos> It's not my policy.<eos> What about a video phone?<eos> You're supposed to have one of those.<eos> We do.
Now you have to buy me a new cupcake.<eos> This is outrageous.<eos> You expect me to avoid...<eos> oh, I see.<eos> Mm-hmm. Yeah, you do.
No, we spent the night cutting open hundreds of dogfish to see if they had diamonds inside.<eos> - Did they?<eos> - Wouldn't you like to know?<eos> Yeah. It would be pertinent to the case.<eos> They didn't.
NYPD!<eos> Drop it!<eos> Drop it, you're under arrest.<eos> I hope they have saunas in Swedish prison.<eos> They do, actually.
Yeah. Why'd, uh, you and JT break up?<eos> He wasn't supposed to tell you.<eos> He didn't. I just... I used my beast senses.<eos> Vincent, you don't have that power.<eos> No. No, I don't, okay?
Northwests!<eos> You've got some explaining to do.<eos> Dipper, you came back.<eos> You lied to me!<eos> All of you did.
You don't mean those boys?<eos> Yes!<eos> What other boys do you have?<eos> But the doctor said you'll be fine. Right?<eos> No, no she did not.
Yeah. We need an autopsy.<eos> Good luck with that.<eos> Yeah, well, I'm gonna go light a fire under Dr. Helpful out here.<eos> I bet all the inmates know exactly what areas are covered by surveillance.<eos> That they do.
Guess there's no place like home.<eos> I saw some more of your memories.<eos> I know what happened to you, I know where you're from.<eos> I already know.<eos> You do?
If it gets any worse we're gonna have to shut it down.<eos> A damaged relationship?<eos> Relay switch.<eos> I said relay switch.<eos> No, you didn't.
You knew?<eos> I had my suspicions.<eos> Why didn't you say anything.<eos> I had no idea this technology even existed.<eos> It doesn't, officially.
It is so sad about Boone, isn't it?<eos> Oh, are you okay?<eos> I mean, how are you feeling?<eos> Uh, I don't know.<eos> How do you...
Can I rephrase the question?<eos> Does your vagina still have teeth?<eos> No!<eos> The answer is no! "No, it no longer has teeth, so it used to have teeth, but you got them removed"?<eos> No, I didn't.
Well, I found this old talking board in the basement.<eos> Yes, they do.<eos> Didn't you see the movie?<eos> The movie Ouija?<eos> No! No one did!
That's true.<eos> You know, we couldn't waste time kissing when people were in danger.<eos> But now they're no longer in danger.<eos> I mean, you said it yourself.<eos> Did I?
You scheduled this meeting;<eos> that means you talk first and I do my best to try to pretend to listen.<eos> You know why I'm here.<eos> You told me if I helped you get out of that asylum, you'd tell me what happened to the baby in the bathtub.<eos> Did I?
She thought I was cool.<eos> You know?<eos> She liked my playlists.<eos> And I believe that even though everything else was a lie that she really liked my playlists.<eos> Aw, she did, Dad.
Then you get him on that.<eos> Look, the answer is no.<eos> Briggs, don't you think it's time that some of us started paying for what we've done?<eos> You know, penance doesn't mean death.<eos> Sometimes it does.
DEA won't approve it until Sid's behind bars, but, uh... it's happening.<eos> - What?<eos> - You're kidding, right?<eos> You don't have to do this.<eos> Yeah... I do.
Killing Lieutenant Kutzler's first Medal of Honor nomination.<eos> I have no idea what you're talking about.<eos> The packet was routed through your chain of command in 2012, Admiral.<eos> Then it must have got lost in the shuffle before it reached my desk.<eos> Because it never did.
They always do...<eos> They always do it on you, instead of in you.<eos> You know...<eos> I don't know what to say anymore.<eos> I don't.
Do you want shot glasses? I can grab 'em...<eos> I wanted to get the fuck out of there.<eos> It pisses me off because everyone knows that you were getting almost punish-fucked for money.<eos> It's like you're supposed to have respect for yourself, too.<eos> I do.
You're damn right I do, because I don't care how it got up there.<eos> My name is on that wall.<eos> And if I had a crowbar handy...<eos> I would pry it off.<eos> Well, Jeff, you don't.
I have very good contacts, in my country and in yours.<eos> Can I continue?<eos> Abraham Levi handed over the book to the Queen Isabella of Castile. In exchange for protection.<eos> I think you know the story.<eos> Yes, I do.
~ Really?<eos> Do you really have to?<eos> Yup.<eos> Rob, do you smoke?<eos> No, I don't.
Let's not get anxious.<eos> We need to find out the San Esteban's fate.<eos> Maybe she also came back to Spain mostly unharmed.<eos> Okay, I know it's a strange question, being in 1588, but does your grace have a PC at your disposal?<eos> By God I do.
- It is.<eos> So you can stop complaining about women being in charge,<eos> I never complained.<eos> When did I complain?<eos> Last night you did.
I don't understand why it is painted without any colors.<eos> White, black and gray.<eos> As though it were a photograph from a newspaper in a story about the bombing.<eos> I didn't know you knew about art.<eos> I don't.
You should be more careful from now on.<eos> I will be.<eos> I will leave the stage and return to my old life, I have never known anything more dangerous than being a comic.<eos> Do you know how to write?<eos> No, I do not.
This is Castleroy's personal ledger, found in his counting house.<eos> Its contents will confirm guilt rather than innocence.<eos> I don't know how much time I have, but before this is done, there are things I need you to know.<eos> I lied to you, Mary, and that is a treason in itself.<eos> But Aloisius did nothing wrong...
No, I'm not all right.<eos> I've been thinking about all that we've been through, my ladies and I.<eos> And sometimes I wonder if I should have even brought them with me.<eos> I would have felt very alone if I hadn't.<eos> As I do now.
She's being a stubborn little fool.<eos> Calm down, Hunter.<eos> He didn't mean that.<eos> He cares about you, Beth.<eos> We all do.
I wasn't lying, I was just reluctant to discuss the intimate details of my...<eos> - Hooker habit?<eos> - Dammit, Laura!<eos> You know I didn't do this.<eos> - I don't.
Yes.<eos> All right.<eos> These guys are nut jobs at best and dangerous at worst.<eos> Now, how did you know where to find them?<eos> I just did, all right?
--Toaster take picture of you.<eos> Doesn't even make sense.<eos> It makes perfect sense.<eos> You don't make sense.<eos> It totally does.
So, how's my head?<eos> The tumor seems stable.<eos> I was worried about the inferomedial margin, but the good news is, there's no sign of growth.<eos> It hasn't invaded the optic nerve yet.<eos> Well, how long till it does?
Happy... Like really happy.<eos> So?<eos> You seem happy...<eos> Ish. What do you even care?<eos> I don't, obviously.
Well, that's your problem.<eos> Well, the word's spreading. This was a good idea, hunt...<eos> This is gonna put Amelia Shepherd on the map. Mm. Unless it fails.<eos> It won't.<eos> If it does...
If I do wake up but I'm dependent on vents or tubes, pull the plug then, too.<eos> Y-you know what?<eos> You're not... you're not dying.<eos> Shepherd knows what she's doing.<eos> She does.
You're not... you're not dying.<eos> Shepherd knows what she's doing.<eos> She does.<eos> Okay.<eos> Sure. She does!
Dylan, focus! I don't know where she is, but I can sense that she's okay.<eos> It's like we share the same brain. Who has it now?<eos> Okay, so, last night when you were with her, she didn't say anything about getting married?<eos> Haley got married? ! That's so upsetting!<eos> Done.
How are you here?<eos> Oh, Abigail,<eos> I have so many questions.<eos> So do I. And God do I wish we had more time.<eos> But we don't.
Oh...<eos> Oh!<eos> Wow.<eos> You had no choice.<eos> Yes, I did.
Oh!<eos> Wow.<eos> You had no choice.<eos> Yes, I did.<eos> We all did.
Why would I say "my boobs"<eos> when it's your boobs that I like?<eos> Have you thought about us?<eos> I want to give it a try.<eos> Oh, you do?
But I need to know...<eos> Were you drinking?<eos> I didn't have a drop.<eos> You have to believe me.<eos> I do.
What did he see?<eos> Doesn't much matter now.<eos> Who's he gonna tell?<eos> Louise...<eos> Did you...
I said she's fine, Russell.<eos> Tell that to the Chinese.<eos> Thank you for coming.<eos> Hope you're right, Henry.<eos> I really do.
So when Johnny OD'd on blow two years later...<eos> Which I warned you about.<eos> The "I don't want to die anonymous" verse of Sex Drugs became the fan base's mission statement.<eos> They didn't want you to die anonymous.<eos> Who does, right?
Hey, if I don't get the right vibe, I'm not gonna waste my time.<eos> What about my time?<eos> If I wasn't doing this, I'd... you know, still be here, but I'd be drunk by now.<eos> Hey, I've been watching you try to help your friend meet someone, and I think it's very sweet.<eos> You do?
A fellow smartass.<eos> I can see why you're his drinking buddy, though you're gonna have to knock off the hard stuff while you're breastfeeding, mate.<eos> You know, what are you even doing here?<eos> I thought you hated Stefan.<eos> Yeah, I do.
Very impressed.<eos> All right, reach down and stretch. Touch your toes.<eos> That's it.<eos> Feel the burn.<eos> And, uh... do that thing. The arm thing.
I need it for my interview.<eos> Oh, do you know what?<eos> Don't worry, you don't understand.<eos> - Of course I do.<eos> - No, you don't!
What a lesson!<eos> That's what this is about?<eos> - You want an apology.<eos> - Yes!<eos> Yes, I do!
Well, Max is fine with it, so...<eos> Yeah, because he's Max.<eos> That's not how he really feels, though.<eos> - How do you know?<eos> - Because I do, Tay.
But I'm not getting a "Hey, kids!<eos> , we're going to Disneyland" vibe out of it.<eos> - They're getting divorced.<eos> - You don't know that.<eos> - Yes, I do.
So you want to stay with mom?<eos> Yes.<eos> Does mom want to stay with you?<eos> I hope so, Grant.<eos> I really do.
I mean... I think...<eos> We should be us again.<eos> Together.<eos> You want to get back together?<eos> Yeah, I do.
Okay, so you want to get the stuff on the list or do you want to make up the schedule?<eos> I'll get the groceries.<eos> Did you mean what you said about us working things out?<eos> Yeah, yes.<eos> I did.
Yeah, I'm starting to think it might be nice if all I had to worry about was prom and whether or not I'm gonna look like a dork in my yearbook photo, rather than constantly feeling like<eos> To... adulting.<eos> To adulting.<eos> So does this mean you figured out what to do with those files?<eos> Yeah, I did.
We're the police.<eos> It's all right, it's all over now.<eos> Look! There she is!<eos> Do you know her or not?<eos> - Do you? - No, sir.
You be safe and you come home soon.<eos> We haven't got many days left.<eos> I don't want to be alone at the end.<eos> I know, Mum.<eos> None of us do.
- Oh, yeah.<eos> But if he teams up with and beary and squirrely, you're a goner.<eos> Mom, you know I tried to take out that mugger, right?<eos> - I do. - And you know how much it hurts to get pepper-sprayed, right?<eos> I do.
Mom, you know I tried to take out that mugger, right?<eos> - I do. - And you know how much it hurts to get pepper-sprayed, right?<eos> I do.<eos> And you know that Riley's being a terrible girlfriend by making me look like a coward on national TV, right?<eos> - I don't.
You'll be contagious for five to eight days, during which time, it is imperative that you pass it on to as many people as possible, who will then have five to eight days to do the same, and so on.<eos> We need a minimum of 10,000 people at each stop to sufficiently spread the cure across these sections of the country.<eos> What about dropping the cure from the sky?<eos> Didn't you find a way to make the aerosol work?<eos> I did.
Still triangulating.<eos> The wind was blowing, and we just... we rolled down the windows even though it was cold.<eos> We didn't even care because the music was blasting on the stereo.<eos> You remember that?<eos> Yes, I do.
I did not bet that bird, chuparlo.<eos> Yes, you did, mi General.<eos> 8 pesos.<eos> How is it you have 8 pesos to bet with?<eos> As a fact, I do, Excellency.
Expose his unholy affinity for savages.<eos> Yes, he's the greatest curse that Providence in all its wrath has sent to our country.<eos> Sullied the reputation of countless women, abandoned two wives.<eos> If the people truly knew him as we do...<eos> But they do.
And I'll take one hell of an ass whooping, won't lift a hand.<eos> But she ain't getting on this wagon.<eos> Is that true?<eos> You love him?<eos> I do.
Not here.<eos> Not-- - Look at it.<eos> - [grunts] Look at that.<eos> [quietly] You think you can moon me without consequences?<eos> Huh? Do you?
I am so pleased that you could come.<eos> I was happy to, if only to thank you again for your intervention with that mob.<eos> Of course.<eos> Did you see the house?<eos> I did.
I mean...<eos> I like Danny Wheeler.<eos> Oh my God, how crazy is that?<eos> It's true.<eos> I do.
!<eos> Hang on, who's Katie Springer?<eos> She looks amazing.<eos> - Yeah, If you like that kind of thing.<eos> - Which everyone does.
He's a big softie, isn't he?<eos> I had no idea he was so sensitive.<eos> Well, don't you remember him from college?<eos> Never talked to me at college.<eos> No-one did.
That wasn't our plan.<eos> - Now we can't go to Mexico.<eos> - Théo, look at me.<eos> I don't love you.<eos> I never did.
and he's got to be great in bed.<eos> But he's also sweet and someone I'd want to have my children with, someone I can trust.<eos> That's a tall order.<eos> Where you gonna find someone like that?<eos> I did it once.
- To kill me.<eos> - You missed.<eos> - Marissa,<eos> - I don't want to do this right now.<eos> - Yes, you do.
Thank you so much.<eos> I love this so much.<eos> Schmidt, isn't there something you want to ask your mother about?<eos> Well,<eos> I did...
What, he can't just be a good Samaritan?<eos> Tip about a possible missing NSA agent out of the goodness of his heart?<eos> Maybe in Kansas.<eos> Never want to meet at a Starbucks, do they?<eos> No, they don't.
- I killed my daughters.<eos> - I know.<eos> No.<eos> No.<eos> You don't.
- Joe is a fucking idiot.<eos> No, Joe's not a fucking idiot.<eos> Joe hired me to bring in big money players, protect the wealth, and capitalize on the success of men in a world that, with all due respect, Mr. Anderson, you don't know anything about with the exception of when you watch the Red Zone Channel on your very big fuckin' flat screen.<eos> Monetize my friendships is what Joe's been preaching to me from the moment I walked in the door, and I always thought that that came directly from you.<eos> Everything does except the bad shit.
Yeah?<eos> You think you can handle me all by yourself?<eos> You're kind of a... A wild girl?<eos> You really don't want to know.<eos> I do.
I know what you did.<eos> You and your two buddies Declan and Killburn beat Simon George's father to death.<eos> How the hell would you know that?<eos> 'Cause I saw it.<eos> Sure, you did.
Because I'm just trying to protect myself and my baby from being killed by Juliette.<eos> You've seen what she is now.<eos> I have.<eos> You think I planned all of this?<eos> I don't.
We were supposed to look out for each other, and I let her down.<eos> Look, I'm just gonna cut to the chase.<eos> I'm a Grimm, and I know you're a Klaustreich.<eos> I don't know what you're talking about...<eos> Yeah, you do.
I have teams from four precincts pulling all video in a 10-block radius from where Beckett was taken.<eos> It's a long shot, but...<eos> What about Amy Barrett... the phone call she made to Beckett?<eos> Can we trace that?<eos> We did... to a cellphone.
Your breath, it smells like a fart.<eos> Hey.<eos> You okay?<eos> You're probably wondering why I wanted to see you.<eos> Something to do with Liam?
Actually, boss, yeah, I-I did.<eos> Really?<eos> You didn't tell us?<eos> Well, I didn't know if he'd want me to.<eos> I don't.
At least that's what Nick told me.<eos> - Where's Juliette now?<eos> - She's dead.<eos> Nick killed Juliette?<eos> No. Trubel did.
If I don't like anything you say, they can look all they want, but they'll never find you.<eos> Don't answer it.<eos> I need to send my thumbprint so they know it's me.<eos> Wait a minute; how do we know she didn't just send a distress signal?<eos> You don't.
- Martha--<eos> - No, um...<eos> I can't take it.<eos> Everyone at work knows that I'm lying.<eos> - No, no, they don't.
- You don't know?<eos> - No.<eos> Mrs. Anselmi, you picked up discount tickets?<eos> No, I threw them away, as usual.<eos> No, Mrs. Anselmi, you didn't.
I can not work with people I don't trust.<eos> I trust you.<eos> - But I don't.<eos> I don't.<eos> I did.
I'm compelled to investigate.<eos> You and I both know you did this.<eos> Actually, based on how quickly you pulled that press conference together, I'm inclined to think maybe you did this.<eos> - I shot at myself?<eos> - Sure you did.
Uh, Jerry's alive.<eos> Thank God. Thank God.<eos> So, I-I guess...<eos> I guess you know Jerry?<eos> Oh, I do.
Obviously, you're pissed off about something, something about me.<eos> No.<eos> No, I am pissed off at myself 'cause I'm so stupid.<eos> - I thought you wanted me to call you.<eos> - I did! Really?
This is crazy.<eos> Who cares what we do in our sleep?<eos> We can be ourselves.<eos> We love each other.<eos> - We do?
Because in high school, I was shoved in a locker multiple times.<eos> This also explains the victim's shoulder injuries.<eos> Before I tell Booth about this, do you really think your strategy of photographing ourselves...<eos> Taking a selfie.<eos> And yes, I do.
And I really think we should<eos> - take you to a doctor...<eos> - The pills were fine.<eos> And how do you know that?<eos> - Because I do.
Look.<eos> If she had actually killed herself and I had never seen her again, I just know I would spend the rest of my life wondering why on earth I didn't at least try and help her.<eos> Please, can you understand that?<eos> Yeah, I can.<eos> And I do.
And I know that's not an excuse... in any way.<eos> But I promise you it didn't mean anything.<eos> Crash, I was out of my mind.<eos> Please believe me.<eos> I do.
The guilt?<eos> You need to let me go and give yourself up.<eos> I can't go back to jail.<eos> You need to know I didn't choose any of this.<eos> No, you did.
Excellent.<eos> It's getting harder and harder to maintain my sunny disposition, Smithers.<eos> Oh, you're always my ray of...<eos> Shut up.<eos> Dad, what does that do?
Do it.<eos> Enter the world of body spray, wiry hairs and wondering what boobs feel like.<eos> Do you know?<eos> Sure, sure.<eos> Of course I do.
Aubrey.<eos> What?<eos> That's my name. Aubrey.<eos> - Wait, aubrey. - Hey!<eos> Hey, no, don't do that.
Congratulations! A picnic rug?<eos> Ta-da!<eos> Well... .. don't you recognise it?<eos> I don't believe it.<eos> Where on earth did you...
- Come on, you know you want it.<eos> - You don't know what I want.<eos> Oh, yes, I do.
Do you really expect me to believe you came to Wales for a romantic getaway?<eos> Easy, bro.<eos> Wales is kickass!<eos> I mean if this weren't a romantic getaway, would I be doing this?<eos> I do, because we did.
I couldn't commit to Biggie until I had a chance to see the world, so I decided to pull an "Eat, Play, Love."<eos> I skipped the Ashram part.<eos> Curry doesn't always agree with me.<eos> You don't want to know what curry does to a pregnant woman.<eos> No, we really don't.
Not talking about it.<eos> I'm focusing on my future.<eos> Tomorrow, I will make a lasting second impression via my lifelong passion for baton.<eos> You don't have a lifelong passion for baton.<eos> Uh, yeah, Amy, I do.
I'll talk to you later.<eos> Bye.<eos> Amy!<eos> Look... I know why you're trying to help me out.<eos> Oh, y-you do.
Told you last time I saw you I'd get out of the slammer.<eos> We need to know how to remove the Mark of Cain from Dean's arm.<eos> He's gone nuclear!<eos> Who knew the Mark was so toxic?<eos> Actually, I did.
I think she was confused by the derby.<eos> Yeah. I think we're all a little confused by it.<eos> Nola, I want to ask you if you've ever had any success, but I don't know how to do that without insulting you.<eos> That's correct.<eos> You don't.
You want me to call a doctor?<eos> But wait!<eos> Good...<eos> He looks so bad.<eos> We didn't do anything serious?
Okay, let's go home and make some plans.<eos> I already have a few ideas.<eos> Save them for the meeting.<eos> Yeah, I don't really like meetings.<eos> No one does, Flynn.
Professor Bancroft is... is the authority on Colonial American architecture, man.<eos> You are so lucky!<eos> I-I-I would... I would have killed to have taken classes from... from... from...<eos> And you... you don't even care.<eos> Nobody does, mate.
Just let me know what you want.<eos> That was nice meeting Father Barnes.<eos> I think you're in good hands.<eos> So, uh... did you read the letter?<eos> Yeah, I did.
You think I don't know that?<eos> Erin, I'm an ex-cop.<eos> You think I didn't do my own digging?<eos> Of course she's got a past.<eos> Who doesn't?
- I didn't say that.<eos> Marianne, I liked you as soon as I saw you.<eos> - Do you love me?<eos> - Of course.<eos> No, you don't.
Lie my whole life?<eos> - He might look like Gilbert.<eos> - Maybe he'd understand.<eos> Maybe.<eos> But what if he didn't?
'Cause I didn't want to waste my time having this conversation.<eos> My friend has been murdered.<eos> I have to find out who did it.<eos> No.<eos> I do.
Really?<eos> How come I'm just hearing about him now.<eos> She just remembered him from a pile of photographs of Ganz's associates.<eos> It's not that you have a history of lying, but you have a history of lying.<eos> We both do.
- In other words, you understood his oral agreement to be genuine.<eos> - We did.<eos> - That's all we need.<eos> Howard doesn't need to understand the particulars of his contract.<eos> You did.
Okay, are you accusing me of overscheduling our tone-deaf daughter so she's so tired she misses the talent show and doesn't humiliate herself?<eos> Lily has no talent.<eos> Because she's 7.<eos> No one has talent at 7.<eos> I did.
I can't fire my dad!<eos> I know.<eos> I know.<eos> It must be hard, but you realize it's the best thing for the company.<eos> - Yes, I do.
What did you just say to me?<eos> That's not what I meant.<eos> I didn't say that--<eos> Because you pity me?<eos> Yeah, you did.
That's all we can do.<eos> Well, "all we can do"<eos> is gonna send her back to some horrible facility.<eos> - We don't exactly know that.<eos> - Yes, we do.
And Mary Ann couldn't tell you because she doesn't speak.<eos> Which mean we don't have any proof.<eos> Where are you going?<eos> I'm gonna go get us some proof.<eos> You did this?
You don't know that.<eos> I'm the one who vetted those Afghan soldiers.<eos> I convinced the DoD to trust them.<eos> Do you feel confident in the Intel you gathered about them?<eos> I did.
She just hung up on me.<eos> Rough call?<eos> You want to talk about it?<eos> No, thank you, Mr. Beale.<eos> I don't.
I don't date much.<eos> I was involved with an agent in the office a couple of years ago-- Chris Amador.<eos> Yes. I think I was more involved with him than he was with me.<eos> But I'm sure you know what happened with Agent Amador.<eos> I do.
When you're in a stitch, and you're waltzing around some dead person's memory, it is my job to keep you safe.<eos> I know what I signed up for and I know all the risks.<eos> All the risks?<eos> No.<eos> You don't.
I'd say it was worth the side trip.<eos> You expect to walk out the front door loaded down with that stuff?<eos> Who said anything about walking?<eos> You don't mess with the Rocket unless you know how to fly!<eos> Which they do!
Y'all are just -- just -- just negligent.<eos> See, now -- now look right here.<eos> Hey, hey, hey, the three of you, put your collars on.<eos> - We have them on. - What are you talking about?<eos> - Uh, we did.
Then why do I keep doing it?<eos> Opening the floodgates, giving voice... nay, valuable office hours... to the crackpots and the crazies?<eos> You're the dutiful servant of the American people, and the American people need their pulse taken.<eos> The American people believe the air force is chemically neutering us when it snows, Holly.<eos> - This next lady doesn't.
Well, that's very inspiring, senator Ross.<eos> But the truth is, if confirmed, you will be one horrible tragedy away from the presidency.<eos> With your lack of experience, how do I know that you're prepared to protect us against Russia or the North Koreans?<eos> Simple.<eos> You don't.
You provide for your family.<eos> No regrets.<eos> You know what?<eos> I don't regret it.<eos> 'Course you don't.
It was really quite clear.<eos> - It's quite long.<eos> - You know, look.<eos> - We want to be socially responsible.<eos> - We do.
Wait, nothing.<eos> I didn't say anything.<eos> You said, "The streak is alive." No!<eos> No, I said, "Freak." I said, "The freak is alive."<eos> No, you didn't.
I didn't say anything.<eos> You said, "The streak is alive." No!<eos> No, I said, "Freak." I said, "The freak is alive."<eos> No, you didn't.<eos> No, she didn't.
She's convinced that she's being watched.<eos> It was about the break-in?<eos> Nice outfit, Soto.<eos> Liked it better when you wore it yesterday.<eos> Oh, I did? Hm.
Plus, you're kinda like a young me.<eos> Deadites ruined your life and you're hot as hell.<eos> Okay, let's get to the book store and hit the undo button on this BS once and for all.<eos> You know they were Jewish, right?<eos> I - I did not.
- Delicious!<eos> That's good, too.<eos> There's a new one: veal sausage!<eos> Same as you.<eos> I didn't...
"Without you the heart's restless."<eos> "The tears trickle down my chest."<eos> "I swear on you, the tears don't dry up."<eos> "You know..."<eos> "and so do I."
But people usually just call me Ellie.<eos> And you are?<eos> I just graduated from the Met Police Service with a degree in forensics psychology.<eos> I... hope you don't mind if I observe.<eos> And if I do?
Any luck?<eos> Lot of anger.<eos> Not much info.<eos> Think she knows anything?<eos> I do.
I mean, what if this is the beginning of the end?<eos> We promised each other... roommates in college and... and houses next door to each other.<eos> Best friends forever.<eos> Don't you want that anymore?<eos> Yeah, I do.
I don't appreciate being instructed as to what will or will not happen in my courtroom.<eos> Your Honor, if I may.<eos> A citizen of this district has been brutally murdered.<eos> Not just a citizen but a public servant a lieutenant for the Metro P.D. And the people have a right to access and evaluate all evidence--<eos> - No, they don't.
Hey, you.<eos> This man you know that sells guns...<eos> Is he reliable?<eos> I thought you had someone.<eos> We did.
- Tell her what?<eos> - About Tom.<eos> You should have told her some time ago.<eos> - I don't know how do that, Dembe.<eos> - Yes, you do.
It was your idea.<eos> I helped you.<eos> You know, Francoeur...<eos> I don't know who Francoeur is.<eos> And nor do you.
I want to go on a copper-mine tour.<eos> I-I don't think they have that here.<eos> Hayley, everywhere I've ever vacationed has a copper-mine tour -- New Mexico, Utah, Nebraska.<eos> You're telling me that all those places have something that the so-called<eos> "greatest city in the world" doesn't?
Oleg, the people at Table Two want to know what's in the veggie burger.<eos> No. They don't.
An Gorta Mor is Gaelic for "the great hunger."<eos> - You want to hear it?<eos> - Now?<eos> No, you don't want to hear it.<eos> No, no, I do.
You want to take down The Countess?<eos> So do I.<eos> And Iris here is the key.<eos> Nobody gets closer to The Countess than she does.<eos> You did.
That's the name of the guy who built it.<eos> And you had dinner with him.<eos> I was in a room with a guy who claimed to be him, a guy who I think is responsible for the five dead bodies on the wall in my office!<eos> You think he's The Ten Commandment Killer?<eos> I do.
Forever.<eos> We made love like it was the first time.<eos> But you didn't believe her.<eos> Oh, I did.<eos> I did.
Huh? Your mama is the sick one.<eos> Only room for one in the family.<eos> Daddy, let me drive you over to see Dr. Sammy tomorrow.<eos> I can drive myself if I want to go.<eos> And I don't.
- Come on.<eos> - No.<eos> Alex is not the answer.<eos> She doesn't know about you.<eos> Not the way I do.
I stood there listening to that kid threaten your life.<eos> I'm not taking time off until he's caught.<eos> Wherever Donovan is, I'm pretty sure that he's running as far away as possible, as fast as he can.<eos> You're lucky they're allowing me to talk to you.<eos> They don't usually do that.
Oh, why?<eos> Do you hate the color?<eos> He doesn't like commitment.<eos> Do you not have Gigi's name on you?<eos> No, no, actually, he doesn't.
dimension in here, but there's only room for one ME.<eos> Wait... wait a second.<eos> You just raved about ghosts like a kid who had too much sherbet.<eos> Do you know what you need? You need a hobby!<eos> I really don't.
That it will be all right.<eos> That the Doctor will save us.<eos> And when you say it, do you believe it?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, I do.
- You owe me.<eos> I pay you.<eos> Sorry, Gabi, monies before honeys.<eos> Gabi, we need to talk.<eos> Yes, we do.
That's fabricating evidence.<eos> The Feds want her on the stand, under oath.<eos> Um, Maya.<eos> Do you swear everything you're going to tell us will be the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth?<eos> I do.
Up, down, up, down.<eos> Up, down... up, down.<eos> Good!<eos> You feel the burning in your core?<eos> Oh, yes, I do.
Hey, you want to fire a confetti gun, Homer?<eos> That's the only kind of gun I've never fired.<eos> Come on, just point and squeeze.<eos> I know that guy.<eos> Yeah, sure you do, Uncle Lenny.

Oh, I'm sorry.<eos> What's going on?<eos> Well, the truth is, she embezzled several million dollars, and she's in jail.<eos> You know, I've never known anyone who's been to jail.<eos> Yeah, you do.
Nobody likes a drum solo.<eos> Sorry.<eos> I'm just really nervous.<eos> I did something horrible.<eos> So did most of the people in this room.
Toilet wine-- a lovely mixture of moldy bread, rotted fruit, and ketchup.<eos> Ketchup makes it a rosé.<eos> And, of course, heroin, smuggled via somebody's boyfriend's poop chute.<eos> In either case, you really gotta want it.<eos> And I did.
What is your problem with God?<eos> I don't have a problem with God.<eos> I happen to be a very spiritual person.<eos> My problem is with an ex-con looking me in the eye and telling me I lost Alvin because God has some freakin' plan.<eos> Well... maybe he does.
I'll be right back.<eos> Stay in the carriage.<eos> You.<eos> - Do you know this town?<eos> - I do, Majesty.
There's one secret that I kept.<eos> And it has cost the ones I love more than I ever wanted.<eos> What the hell, Ems?<eos> I am David Clarke's daughter.<eos> Does David Clarke already...
I can't read the book in its present form... but there is someone who could.<eos> Nadya.<eos> Grand Coven witch.<eos> Where do I find her?<eos> You don't.
And you won't ever hurt anyone ever again.<eos> No one needs to know, Dean.<eos> What happens in purgatory stays in purgatory.<eos> How do you know this' work?<eos> I don't.
I want my son dead.<eos> -After--<eos> Once I cast the spell, and you need me to cast that spell... who knows what'll happen?<eos> I don't have time for this!<eos> Right, you don't.
Oh, you have no idea.<eos> -Your partner's a piece of work, agent.<eos> -Yeah, ain't he though?<eos> Dean-o. Welcome to the party.<eos> The hell you doing here, Rudy?
The rest of my memory.<eos> The Desert Wolf.<eos> Why didn't you tell Scott?<eos> I didn't think you wanted me to.<eos> I don't.
Interpol estimates at least a dozen drug-related homicides in the last year alone.<eos> You're telling me that Tom Keen, the four-eyes who taught third grade, is walking into that?<eos> How do we find him?<eos> I can check, but I don't think we have any friends on the inside.<eos> I do.
But ethically, you have to.<eos> Ethically, I'm looking out for the best interest of my patient and his family.<eos> Hey, thanks for walking us out.<eos> You know, you didn't have to do that.<eos> With your sense of direction, I kind of did.
It's just he says he wants to come back and just work. For me.<eos> Still not sure what you're asking.<eos> Well, I'm asking should I believe that?<eos> Can I believe that?<eos> - I do.
Still not sure what you're asking.<eos> Well, I'm asking should I believe that?<eos> Can I believe that?<eos> - I do.<eos> - You do.
- For another.<eos> Bash, apart from you, I've only been lied to<eos> - and betrayed by men.<eos> - Who want you.<eos> They always do.
If you don't want to say anything, I must send you home, whether you like it or not.<eos> My mother is here.<eos> Your mother?<eos> I have never heard you talk about your mother.<eos> I don't.
Ladies and gentlemen, Freddie Holst.<eos> - Jeanette, do you regret doing this?<eos> - Definitely not.<eos> - Do you?<eos> - No. Not if you don't.
Did something happen?<eos> No.<eos> Hi, Claes.<eos> - Do you know her?<eos> - Yes, I do.
- Hello? - I've been trying to get you all frigging day.<eos> - I've been busy all day.<eos> - With gambling away our house again?<eos> Is it Holst who said that?<eos> So you did?
The one who tipped us off about the connection between Holst and the pictures.<eos> I don't know.<eos> Does he work at Andersen TL?<eos> There is, in any case, someone with that name who does.<eos> Did.
You want a beer?<eos> Whoa, wait!<eos> Who says we're done here?<eos> Come on Stash.<eos> I do.
"Exhausting" is more like it.<eos> At least you can have a beer after a long day.<eos> This is true.<eos> Oh, you met Pam.<eos> Yes. I sure did.
Janet Wong was on duty that night.<eos> She placed Derek Caster in the cell with Mason Garvey.<eos> Suddenly, she had a new car.<eos> Right, and then Wong told you that Henry Guenther paid her $50,000 to arrange the murder?<eos> She did, yes.
Love you.<eos> Oh, God...<eos> I brought you bagels.<eos> - You should have called.<eos> - I did.
- (Both sighing) - Oh. Is that it?<eos> Okay.<eos> So, he finally found out you've been lying to him about his birthday?<eos> Ben told you, too?<eos> No. You did.
You know she didn't mean it, right?<eos> She was just using her teenage superpower Of instantly knowing the most horrible thing to say.<eos> What bothers me is that she snuck out, late at night.<eos> Something terrible could've happened.<eos> But nothing did.
Sometimes when i'm at parties, I'm the girl who lost her brother.<eos> I know how you feel.<eos> I guess you would.<eos> How do you forget about it?<eos> I don't.
Turns out when laurel disappeared, The manager was questioned and cleared.<eos> Okay. You know, but young girls run away all the time.<eos> Problems at home, they take off.<eos> You know what i mean?<eos> Yeah, i do.
No one's ever hated you.<eos> Even when they disagree with you, they love Fitzgerald Grant.<eos> That face, that voice.<eos> You got that thing that makes people love you.<eos> And I don't.
That's how he lets her know Papa Pope is in charge.<eos> That's how he lets her know that...<eos> You can't take command, son. Yes.<eos> She never had a chance, did she?<eos> No, she didn't.
What about a sick relative?<eos> One she had to leave the ship to visit?<eos> That works, too, but Amy doesn't have a sick relative.<eos> Actually, she does.<eos> No, she doesn't.
Now that's a revenge all-star opportunity.<eos> What do you have on tap?<eos> A long summer of fun.<eos> Trust me.<eos> I do...
- He wailed for 3 hours.<eos> - The horror.<eos> It's why I don't want kids.<eos> - Really?<eos> You don't?
- The shots don't work.<eos> - It'll work.<eos> What will?<eos> Stop saying it'll work.<eos> It doesn't!
I never know where to look.<eos> Look down, you're being rude.<eos> Too much eye contact, and people think you're weird.<eos> Facts, numbers, patterns, they make sense to me.<eos> People... people don't.
I didn't realize you felt that way.<eos> Because you never really listened to anything I said.<eos> And you took my V-card, and then you could hardly look at me.<eos> - Come on, I liked you.<eos> - No, you didn't.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.<eos> No, I got you. Got you.<eos> You know, I'm, I, it was clear enough that I might be dancing with the devil.<eos> Do you think you have an answer now?<eos> I do.
No, I know who I am.<eos> I am the puppet of some high-functioning sociopath.<eos> I don't even know what I'm doing here.<eos> What you're doing here is celebrating your birthday with me.<eos> - What did you...?
I saw her as I've never seen her before, as a woman in love... with you.<eos> You'd never know she suffers the torments of hell believing that you had died without knowing.<eos> Knowing?<eos> That she has always loved you.<eos> And she still does.
Just to play it safe, I think you should sit this one out.<eos> Well, if you insist!<eos> Uh, I do.<eos> As long as you know that I could've finished the race had I run.<eos> - Oh, I do.
Just for you,<eos> I think there's a little truth in this big lie.<eos> Where'd you find her?<eos> - We didn't.<eos> Mr. Beamish did.
Move the ba...<eos> My.<eos> But...<eos> But the leak!<eos> How did you...
Bottom line is, people don't change.<eos> But sometimes, they do surprise you.<eos> Nick!<eos> You came.<eos> Yeah, I did.
Martha.<eos> In her defense, I think she just wanted to get me on board with the sale, since she knew it would be unpopular with the town council.<eos> So, do you really think that tearing down Keating house is the best option for our town?<eos> - I don't have the choice.<eos> Sure you do.
I don't want to make you late for your date.<eos> My X-ray is down, but to be safe I need to get a better look.<eos> You did say you fractured that ankle once before, so this joint is at least susceptible.<eos> If you insist.<eos> - I do.
- Yes, see, control.<eos> No, see, struggle.<eos> I think I'm gonna control myself on home.<eos> And now I seem to be struggling a bit.<eos> Hmm... we all do.
Me, I wanted a whole baseball team.<eos> It's funny how you can think you know someone when you don't, really.<eos> How about you and Jake?<eos> I loved him until the day he died.<eos> I still do.
- (Knocking)<eos> - Hello there, Doctor.<eos> Please, call me Sam.<eos> - If you insist.<eos> - I do.
- He didn't tell you?<eos> - No, he didn't.<eos> Oh...<eos> I'm sorry, Cassie, but you should know.<eos> Yeah, now I do.
I'm stuck between them and they really hate each other.<eos> Dad wants me to stay here, and Mom wants me to go with her.<eos> Well, what do you want?<eos> I want to go to Hong Kong and back to New York.<eos> No, you don't.
Well, what do you want?<eos> I want to go to Hong Kong and back to New York.<eos> No, you don't.<eos> - How would you know?<eos> - I just do.
When I get back from China, I'm gonna look for a house here in Middleton.<eos> I've already spoken with a real estate agent, Sam.<eos> - You can't be serious?<eos> - You asked me to do this.<eos> - No, I didn't!
(Knocking)<eos> - Hello there, Doctor.<eos> Please, call me Sam.<eos> If you insist.<eos> - I do.
He didn't tell you?<eos> - No, he didn't.<eos> Oh...<eos> I'm sorry, Cassie, but you should know.<eos> Yeah, now I do.

Well, I do want to talk about it.<eos> - I don't care.<eos> - I do care.<eos> - I don't suck dicks.<eos> - I do... not...
I will convey your message, Mr. President.<eos> But to be honest, I have no idea what you're talking about.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> They will.<eos> He did what?
Because we can.<eos> Because we're here.<eos> Dad's home!<eos> Come on, get your coats! We found a place with awesome vegan options.<eos> I did.
Well, then, I'd like to talk to him.<eos> Captain's not permitted to talk to material witnesses during an ongoing investigation.<eos> Also protocol.<eos> Listen, Mike, I hear everything that you are saying.<eos> I really do.
Sir, we fished an I.V. bag out of the trash.<eos> The tube still had the blood on it from when Niels ripped it out of his arm.<eos> And?<eos> Every bag prepared in the medical bay should have the patient's name, medication, and Doc Rios' signature.<eos> This one didn't.
I hear you're pretty shaken up, Mr. Sharpe.<eos> Julian Stancroft.<eos> I've advised my client that I'll respond to all questions on his behalf.<eos> - You want that?<eos> - He does.
Have you ever had reason to suspect a personal agenda drives her work?<eos> I don't think she's the one with the agenda here.<eos> If you're found to have lied during an internal investigation, you can be discharged under the police services act.<eos> Do you understand that, detective?<eos> I do.
- ... that he would come?<eos> - Clementine.<eos> - Do you?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> I really don't.
- What?<eos> - Seriously?<eos> You're gonna make your best friend have to pry it out of you.<eos> I know about the cure, Elena.<eos> You do?
I just--I needed some time to process.<eos> I mean, 24 hours ago, I didn't even think it was possible to become a human again.<eos> But you want to be a human again.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Well, I did.
What did you just say?<eos> Nothing.<eos> You just said that you love me.<eos> No, I didn't.<eos> Yes, you did.
What I did to her.<eos> So I just imagine something else, you know?<eos> She's out there with new parents, and they're helping her and loving her, and... the doctors are fixing her brain.<eos> 'Cause I can't live if I don't think that she has a chance, so...<eos> But she doesn't.
And that's a big chance to take when the fallout is your brain in a jar.<eos> I still have a human being's body, Jim.<eos> And it's tired.<eos> This is so messed up.<eos> We didn't even do anything wrong.
two former enemies drinking at the end of the world.<eos> "Former"?<eos> Oh, come on, Jim.<eos> You must have regrets.<eos> Yeah, course I do.
No, no, no, no, no, you're not going anywhere.<eos> Are you ready to face judgment?<eos> You're all sure you want to do this?<eos> Like you even need to ask, Red.<eos> Hell yeah, I do.
She's nobody's queen.<eos> She was conceived and born in three days.<eos> - She is my daughter.<eos> Look, I know how you feel...<eos> No, you don't.
What'd you do to her?<eos> I'm not sure.<eos> I think you're lying.<eos> If you really were human, you'd remember everything you did while you were infected.<eos> I do.
Was she, though?<eos> I mean, I saw the date book on her desk, and she scheduled a mani/pedi for next week.<eos> Now, why would someone with a death wish worry about their cuticles?<eos> Just doesn't make any sense.<eos> Death rarely does.
But I would be remiss if I didn't thank you for that brilliant idea I found on that flash drive of yours.<eos> Just as you were planning on making it appear as if I had murdered you on your farcical wedding night, I'm going to make it appear as if you murdered me in your own home.<eos> The only difference...<eos> You never actually had the guts to kill yourself.<eos> But I do.
This is where it all ends on 37th street between a yarn shop and a falafel stand."<eos> I know what a near-death experience is, and this wasn't my first.<eos> And it's true.<eos> Your life flashes right before your eyes.<eos> And this morning, mine did.
I'm sorry.<eos> I know I'm supposed to keep it down, but...<eos> We had sandwiches.<eos> Wait... you did?<eos> We did.

Lucious Lyon joint. Classic Empire for you, baby.<eos> Right here.<eos> He dropped that from prison?<eos> How? Your daddy, he has his ways.<eos> He always did.
I cannot miss another night with my sons.<eos> I missed too many.<eos> If it's good, Cookie, honey, you can leave right away.<eos> I don't know if Lucious shot or killed Bunkie.<eos> I really don't.
Good.<eos> Look, man, I know I've been hard on you.<eos> My label is my life.<eos> My mom, she deserves the best.<eos> She does.
You know, in this whole damn chapter, only kid was ever a real soul brother.<eos> Hey Charlie, you remember that ride? Hm?<eos> Out in the desert?<eos> You, me, the kid?<eos> Yeah, of course I do.
The Olympic swimmer.<eos> Andy Sinclair won four gold medals in the last Olympics including one of the greatest come-from-behind finishes in sports history.<eos> The guy inspired a Nation.<eos> Does he inspire you?<eos> Well, yes, as a matter of fact, he does.
Uh, checking out... 708.<eos> The chef's secret weapon is truffle oil.<eos> He bathes everything in it.<eos> - What if I love truffle oil?<eos> - You don't.
I didn't kill Michelle.<eos> I've done some bad things but for the right reasons.<eos> Please, you have to believe me.<eos> I do.<eos> Y-you do?
(Oskar) I walk out of that door alone... Or nobody does.<eos> You killed the woman carrying your own child, The woman you loved.<eos> Then you know what I am willing to do.<eos> How do you sleep at night?<eos> I don't.
He'd better.<eos> He does.<eos> Now text her back before she starts worrying.<eos> She's totally gonna know I'm lying.<eos> She always does.
He was both.<eos> We believe he started driving because he was digging into Zooss.<eos> What did he want to know?<eos> Mostly about Patrick's job, like if I knew about any problems Patrick had at work.<eos> I didn't.
- Yeah, yeah, of course.<eos> - Good.<eos> I just... really want someone to be excited for me.<eos> And I, uhm...<eos> Right, how do...
We're not besties.<eos> It's not like she shares.<eos> Well, you'll just have to make sure she does, hmm?<eos> We had a deal.<eos> We still do.
So you were a part of a conspiracy, and when Cruz tried to go against you, he was murdered...<eos> Thrown off a bridge to keep him from blowing the whistle.<eos> That's when you framed him, which is why she framed you.<eos> When I knew her, she was nobody, a ranch hand.<eos> How did she...
- Yeah.<eos> But I'm sorry.<eos> You're still fired.<eos> Do you remember when you had sex with Ders on this desk?<eos> I do.
Yep, yep.<eos> I'm awake. I'm awake. Ahem.<eos> Did you get the encryption?<eos> No, he didn't.<eos> Yes, I did.
Can I take a wild stab at who's chairing this committee?<eos> ...but you will stand before that committee<eos> - and you will tell the truth.<eos> - Not a problem.<eos> Do it all the time.
Those, however, are the only ones where he appears to be in heated altercation with a man two days before he was murdered.<eos> This guy was murdered?<eos> Last night.<eos> Do you want to tell us how you knew him?<eos> I didn't.
So, I checked Arn's records to see if he did any time with Czech inmates.<eos> David and Aleksandr Brosnek.<eos> Cocaine traffickers operating from Prague.<eos> Cocaine traffickers?<eos> Anything to do with narcoterrorism?
- Hamartia.<eos> - Yeah. Yeah.<eos> The gun used to shoot Arn and Chloe was a SIG Sauer, but, Arn's accomplices have confirmed that they gave Arn a Czech pistol, so where is Arn original gun?<eos> - I don't understand.<eos> - I didn't either.
- Thank you.<eos> But you don't be scared.<eos> If there's any problem, just call me.<eos> You have my number, don't you?<eos> - You do, don't you?
Brother, in this era you can ask any youth like me and he'll tell you that finding love has become so expensive and hard.<eos> I mean...if we go watch a film in the multiplex, that's 800 rupees.<eos> And if you eat a combo of popcorn and fritters then it's 900 rupees.<eos> And after that if your baby says "Baby, coffee" then treating her to coffee costs almost 1000 rupees.<eos> And all night on your prepaid card, we do...
You're safe now.<eos> I'll make sure your family is, too.<eos> You don't know these people!<eos> You don't know what they can do!<eos> Oh, yeah, we do.
Thomas Dewey organizes a citywide raid to find Lucky Luciano.<eos> He's not in here.<eos> Luciano escapes, but for Dewey, the raid isn't a total loss, as he brings in a prostitute who works in one of Luciano's brothels.<eos> So, how do you know Lucky Luciano?<eos> I don't.
Oh, shit!<eos> I waited 45 minutes just to see if you'd show up.<eos> Sorry, Crys.<eos> I really tried to make it.<eos> No, you didn't.
[PHONE CLICKS]<eos> She's alive, Harold.<eos> We wrote her off for dead, but she's alive.<eos> - We don't know that, Miss Groves.<eos> - Except we do.
- Oh, I see.<eos> So that means more time chatting with friends.<eos> Exactly.<eos> You know what women are like.<eos> Yeah, I do.
I didn't know what else to do.<eos> Spoken to me.<eos> You should have spoken to me.<eos> I thought that you loved me.<eos> I did.
Spoken to me.<eos> You should have spoken to me.<eos> I thought that you loved me.<eos> I did.<eos> I do.
They're all over the place.<eos> Yeah, the little piggies with the tusks, with the tusks.<eos> Look, you're probably married, right?<eos> - So you know how it is.<eos> - No, I don't.
Something very stupid.<eos> She has a gun.<eos> Which is why I want you as far away as possible.<eos> You know I feel the same way about you, right?<eos> I do, I do.
It's boring.<eos> And I'm stuck here.<eos> Abandoned by the one man who should know what eternity feels like.<eos> Who should understand.<eos> I do, now, but...
Stop this!<eos> They are defenceless.<eos> - He doesn't care.<eos> - But I do.<eos> Oh, God, I do.
I don't wanna think about it being in a diary somewhere in my room.<eos> I want a nice, big wall between before and after.<eos> ♪ Make you feel better make you feel safe ♪<eos> I thought you liked this wallpaper.<eos> I did.
I don't know.<eos> We have, uh, witnesses who say he's your cousin.<eos> He's a stranger, someone we let into our home.<eos> So you must know where he went.<eos> No, I don't.
He's going to Lebanon.<eos> Kasim.<eos> Tell me why I shouldn't tell them.<eos> I owe Khalil nothing.<eos> None of us do.
_<eos> _<eos> You don't have to do that. You don't have to...<eos> Get the fuck off me!<eos> Hey, I didn't do...
I spent the first weeks after the Departure just waiting.<eos> I'm still waiting.<eos> We all are.<eos> I had a patient who said she could feel that something terrible was gonna happen.<eos> And it did.
Shut the fuck up, Patti.<eos> Do you want me to do this?<eos> - What?<eos> - Do you want me to do this?<eos> Or don't you?
- She was drowning, so...<eos> - Did you drink any?<eos> - What?<eos> - The water, did you drink any?<eos> - No. - And don't.
It's pointless.<eos> I'm Evie.<eos> Meg.<eos> I'm sorry you didn't find whatever you were looking for here.<eos> No one ever does.
I was pressuring her, and she ran away.<eos> And now that she's returned?<eos> That means she's ready to confess, and we can all move on.<eos> The real question is, how do you know Harper?<eos> - I don't.
Hey, I thought this was a happy memory.<eos> It is for me.<eos> Hey, John Updike.<eos> I love him.<eos> Oh, yeah, so did my dad.
Wait, she called you?<eos> - It... - Just to offer my condolences.<eos> It's just so tragic and unexpected.<eos> Just, you know, it doesn't make any sense.<eos> Well, suicide rarely does.
Go on.<eos> Well, like I said, Tenant works for GBR, and GBR provides infrastructure for the military.<eos> You know, laundry, recreational equipment, basketball courts.<eos> So... ?<eos> They do business in Mali.
I've got orders.<eos> Rich, my husband and my daughter think that I'm dead, that I'm never coming home!<eos> You don't think I deserve to know why?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, you do.
We have to prepare for battle.<eos> I have defenses in place.<eos> You don't win wars with defense.<eos> No.<eos> You do it with a trap.
No.<eos> He's a dyad.<eos> Half human, half higher angel fused together, living in a single body.<eos> I never thought they existed.<eos> Well, they do.
It's nice not to care.<eos> It made me miss just sitting in a bar... drinking... with you.<eos> One more?<eos> Alicia, I, uh...<eos> I don't really...
From their own words, Your Honor.<eos> Because they believe that our client was already under arrest, and therefore he should have been Mirandized and offered the services of a lawyer.<eos> This was a slip on the radio, Your Honor, that's all.<eos> Officer Tannerman, did you clearly hear Mr. Rickter referred to by the 10-26 designation?<eos> Yes, I did.
Read something.<eos> What do you know?<eos> What have you seen?<eos> I've seen what people do.<eos> What they don't do.
How long are you planning on keeping them?<eos> Well, you got to take that up with lady doctor Exner. It's her show.<eos> - Fine.<eos> How do I talk to her?<eos> - You don't.
I believe many things.<eos> I believe this palace is a symbol of our king, of his power, of his country, and our enemies have stopped at nothing to destroy it.<eos> Since the first stone was laid in this expansion, His Majesty knew this day would come.<eos> So, do I believe that our enemies would dare to poison King Charles of England's sister?<eos> Yes, I do.
It gave her great comfort.<eos> Though I was never the one to prepare it.<eos> Do you know who did?<eos> Do you know who did?<eos> Yes, I do.
I mean, hell, I worked for them for 16 years.<eos> It's got to be worth something.<eos> 16 years?<eos> Did you know she had a film?<eos> She did.
Maybe God wanted us to know that she was gonna be okay in the other place.<eos> And now that we know that...<eos> We have to let her go.<eos> I'm sorry, but you don't know that.<eos> No one does.
Is that all you're gonna say is "oh"?<eos> Well, she's a teenager, Cat.<eos> I mean, it's not great, but it's pretty normal.<eos> I caught Will a couple of times, you know?<eos> No, I didn't.
- Does he get on with Philip?<eos> - They were friends as boys.<eos> I'm afraid she doesn't like my daughter-in-law.<eos> - Oh, dear.<eos> - Who does?
Oh, hey, Mom.<eos> Hi, Soph.<eos> Hey, great news.<eos> Looks like we found your ghost.<eos> Well, actually, my team did, with the help of a very famous psychic.
And in exchange, he's donating money to medics international.<eos> I know it sounds crazy.<eos> But it's a lot of money, and there are a lot of people...<eos> I don't think it's crazy, I think it's pretty brilliant.<eos> You do?
There's nothing going on.<eos> Business as usual.<eos> It's okay.<eos> I know you adore my brother.<eos> We both do.
I don't know if we can work together any more.<eos> So, um, you're just gonna quit?<eos> Move back to London?<eos> I said I don't know.<eos> I don't.
Maggie could explain away the trip out of the country, any follow-up appointments, any pain or cramping.<eos> What if she really did book that surgery?<eos> Well, you looked at her pretty closely at the morgue.<eos> If she had had her stomach stapled, wouldn't you have noticed?<eos> She didn't.
They wouldn't waste time planning a one-off score like this, with amateurs.<eos> Amateurs have to sell to professionals eventually.<eos> Well, the DEA should have a list of cartels that can handle that kind of weight.<eos> You two feel like knocking on the doors of a few drug lords this afternoon?<eos> Yes, I do indeed.
She took it?<eos> Took what?<eos> I'm such an idiot.<eos> The flash drive.<eos> - She did this?
Mum.<eos> I know Dad loved you, and I love you, too.<eos> And so does Cyrus.<eos> Do you think so?<eos> Of course he does.
But there wasn't.<eos> There was just... wasted time and then she was gone.<eos> I don't believe in someday.<eos> Not anymore.<eos> Lucky for you, I do.
- Those times were for free.<eos> I never would've done what I done to your brother if I'd known it was him.<eos> And not 'cause he was a prince. 'Cause he was him.<eos> They said it was a military accident.<eos> Of course they did.
You gotta ask yourself, who "they" are.<eos> - Who are they?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> I mostly operate UAV's.<eos> At least, I did.
- Get it!<eos> - I already did.<eos> Yes!<eos> Oh, God, I can't wait to tell the boys!<eos> I already did.
We could have had peace.<eos> If Claire dies because of you...<eos> Not very smart wearing David's watch around.<eos> Zoe, you gotta listen.<eos> I didn't...
Listen, I've been doing this a little longer than you, and I know one thing:<eos> we got to put pressure on them.<eos> Trust me.<eos> You know, I hate it when someone says "trust me."<eos> I immediately don't.
I know how you feel.<eos> I've wanted this bastard for 20 years.<eos> He doesn't deserve a new start.<eos> You're right.<eos> He doesn't.
Oh, God, the big one.<eos> Is my daughter here?<eos> - No, she left. - Oh.<eos> You know where she went?<eos> - I do not.
'They investigate my parents, tear up my uncle's farm' because I wanted to help you.<eos> Because I didn't believe what people said about you and your friends.<eos> - Just let me explain...<eos> - 'Don't.'<eos> Just don't.
I've... I've always doubted myself.<eos> At least now we know the truth.<eos> Do we?<eos> 'Cause I'm havin' a hard time believing nobody else in this family knew about Charles.<eos> Somebody did.
No.<eos> If-if you overheard anything she said yesterday...<eos> I'm screwed up, Emily.<eos> I know it, your mom knows it..<eos> ...and you do too.
Swim in the ocean.<eos> I can't get back the time I lost, but..<eos> I don't wanna waste any more of it sitting in a room having someone analyze me.<eos> I don't expect anyone to understand any of this.<eos> I do.
People can surprise you.<eos> Mona maintained a 4.0 average and perfect hair while she was tapping Rosewood's police calls.<eos> Spencer, we jumped on the Andrew train...<eos> But he didn't have a motive.<eos> This girl does.
You wouldn't, uh...<eos> You've been...<eos> You know what actually?<eos> You don't even need to know.<eos> No one does.
When...<eos> When did I have a solo exhibit at The Brew?<eos> I might have embellished slightly.<eos> But I mean, I do have your self-portrait hangin' above my desk.<eos> I did.
Thirty thousand dollars?<eos> It's your tuition, Hanna.<eos> I promised you I would figure out how to pay for college.<eos> - Didn't I?<eos> - Mom, eh, how did you..
No, I mean, that..<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I don't know the right thing to say here.<eos> Of course not.<eos> No one does.
I thought you said that you..<eos> Uh, that was when I was gonna be sharing a punch bowl with a bunch of former students.<eos> If you want me there, I will be there.<eos> Unless I have to dress up like a troll or something.<eos> I don't, do I?
My husband isn't well and he'll worry if I'm not home by quarter past.<eos> Well, um...<eos> I suppose that'll have to be enough for today.<eos> Oh, I didn't know you worked here, Mrs Simms.<eos> - She doesn't yet.
I love it.<eos> Wow, babe, you look stunning.<eos> We both do.<eos> And you know you're not dying tomorrow, right?<eos> I don't.
If this can get me through months in the hospital, it can definitely keep you entertained for five to seven hours of your donation.<eos> Fingers crossed.<eos> Have you thought any more about the recipient?<eos> - Do you want to know?<eos> - I do.
Remove it and you will find a silver case along with a key.<eos> This is about the fulcrum.<eos> Yes.<eos> You still have it.<eos> I do. This case, the key.
I'm taking take care of it.<eos> You were right, dembe.<eos> I should have told her.<eos> I understand why you didn't.<eos> No. You don't.
Good job.<eos> Keep Callen and Sam in the loop.<eos> You asked if we could find out anything on the hit man that tried to take the Berkeleys out.<eos> Nikolai Brantov?<eos> Unfortunately, we did.
Leave me alone.<eos> Tom?<eos> Tom, I'm not going to do that, mate, because I don't think<eos> - that's what you really want.<eos> - I do! I do.
Oh, Gretchen, you don't need to pretend you have friends.<eos> What?<eos> I have friends.<eos> No, there's nothing wrong with not having friends.<eos> I don't.
The devil!<eos> What was he thinking of?<eos> I never expected it to go this far.<eos> I thought it'd be over in a week.<eos> - Didn't we all!
No, no, no, no, no.<eos> Not that one... she's kind of my strip club wife.<eos> All right, good boy.<eos> Do you want to get a lap dance with me?<eos> Oh, hell yeah, I do.
You have to follow the money, Gretch.<eos> Big oil, the Middle East.<eos> (snaps fingers) Benghazi!<eos> I don't want to talk about Benghazi.<eos> Nobody does!
In light of this criminal connection, we have to ask ourselves, what do we really know about this guy?<eos> I Googled Pastor Barlow the day he got here.<eos> There's almost nothing online about him.<eos> Let's face it--we don't even know exactly why he was relieved of his duties in Florida.<eos> - I do.
- Yes, I trust that you will give us a service that will uphold the dignified standards of your predecessor.<eos> You don't have any of those services on video, do you?<eos> 'Cause I'd kinda like to see how it's done.<eos> I mean...how it used to be done.<eos> Uh...uh... no, I don't.
- I said I'm sorry.<eos> 'Can I confirm their description please?<eos> Look, I hadn't done a commentary before... .. and the bloody sat nav...<eos> I don't know if it's an A road, B road...<eos> No, you don't.
No, no, Beckett. I need to be...<eos> What you need to do is go back to the loft and stay there.<eos> Now, I've assigned a security detail to you.<eos> - Why would I be a target? - I don't know.<eos> And neither do you.
What do you want?<eos> I want to help you liberate Abuddin from the apostate Al Fayeeds.<eos> Finish the job your father started 30 years ago.<eos> - I'm done fighting.<eos> - Done?
It's Sara, right?<eos> Did Sara understand your relationship with Triva?<eos> Sort of.<eos> You know how it is, old girl, new girl.<eos> Yeah, I do.
It was really awesome of her to force me to go to Charton against my will, wait until I was happy there and then force me to leave.<eos> I had to quit my job at Alchemy 'cause it's too far from my new school.<eos> But since April got sick, she always comes first, especially now that she's getting married.<eos> There's, like, no way to compete with the cancer bride.<eos> So I don't.
- I am. I... I have just too much going on at home right now for me to even consider planning a trip away.<eos> So...<eos> I hope you understand.<eos> Of course.<eos> Of course I do.
He doesn't know for sure that's what started it.<eos> You got to keep the faith, Billy.<eos> The truth comes out.<eos> You believe me, don't you?<eos> Yeah, I do.
- Then you do know.<eos> - I don't!<eos> Stop telling me the opposite of what I am telling you.<eos> I am too tired for this!<eos> I don't!
Not her.<eos> Because you knew?<eos> Etienne found out.<eos> He banned him seeing her and gave her a roasting.<eos> Like he did to his wife?
Ms. Clarke, my thoughts.<eos> I will grant bail, but I do so with great concern and under the strictest of conditions.<eos> If I hear even a rumor that my conditions for release have been violated, I will have you locked up so fast your inscrutable little head will spin.<eos> Do you understand?<eos> Yes, I do, Your Honor.
Can I talk to you outside?<eos> Sure. Yeah.<eos> Anywhere that's less than 6 feet from the door.<eos> Who knew Victoria had it in her?<eos> Well, I did.
I got him a... oh no, no... oh no...<eos> Ha ha, almost got me.<eos> It's a surprise.<eos> Guys, you didn't have to get me anything.<eos> Good, because she obviously didn't.
No, you can't!<eos> I have to do this.<eos> What sort of human being puts another person at risk just to prove a point?<eos> You don't run this prison, Smith.<eos> I do.
Maybe you should have told your mates not to start burning their gear out in the yard.<eos> Get back to your units.<eos> Open the door or Vinegar Tits gets it.<eos> You don't run this prison.<eos> I do.
No warrants, nothing.<eos> We're bringing him in.<eos> Mr. Yates, it looks like your car was reported as being involved in a hit-and-run where a pedestrian was injured.<eos> Do you know anything about that?<eos> No, I don't.
This is going to be hard on you.<eos> I'm fine, we went over it.<eos> Just give me a second, okay?<eos> Hey, maybe you don't want to be in there.<eos> Yeah, I do.
I just know what I saw.<eos> No, I'm a consultant with the NYPD.<eos> But a warrant could be arranged pursuant to my request.<eos> Or, if you prefer, a formal summons could be issued in response to this needless obstruction.<eos> No, don't me on hol...
Jackson, it's only three months.<eos> You could at least pretend to be happy for me.<eos> Why?<eos> I don't like it.<eos> I don't.
And while he was writing Lord of the Rings, he was sending excerpts to Christopher to get his mind off the war.<eos> I do that too.<eos> You know, I'm not a writer, but I make videos for my mom.<eos> Aw, I bet she loves getting them.<eos> She did.
I do that too.<eos> You know, I'm not a writer, but I make videos for my mom.<eos> Aw, I bet she loves getting them.<eos> She did.<eos> Did?
I'd like to discuss it with you.<eos> Okay.<eos> Not here.<eos> So you got the job, I see.<eos> Yes, sir. I did. Coffee?
Hello?<eos> Hello.<eos> Randall: Tough choice, Frank.<eos> Either way, somebody you love dies.<eos> Or maybe you all do.
I... I'm free to go?<eos> I am free to go?<eos> You have suffered enough, and I am not a monster.<eos> If you ever need any more Jews to kill, you know where to find me.<eos> Yes. I do.
I have to find this man.<eos> How am I supposed to do that?<eos> With my help.<eos> Do you have someplace private we can talk?<eos> Do we ever.
Lara's going to wait out here with Derek.<eos> You go in and sit on the bed, then I'll come in and we'll talk but the door stays open the whole time.<eos> I'm not going to hurt you.<eos> You know that.<eos> No. I don't.
And thank Christ for that, if this is what it does to you.<eos> You could always steal it.<eos> I'm just saying.<eos> If you wanted to.<eos> He doesn't! OK.
Keep the process legit while I'm gone.<eos> Just stop the car.<eos> Stop the car!<eos> I want to do it again.<eos> No, you don't.
Lucy, no.<eos> You can't do this.<eos> I have to.<eos> You don't understand.<eos> Yes, I do.
And... and she would do anything for me.<eos> You're wrong.<eos> Mara wanted to get you back, but only so she could find your stash of Aether.<eos> You knew where it was.<eos> She didn't.
Really following in your father's footsteps.<eos> I hope it's not too hot.<eos> Oh, Audrey... I don't want to hurt you.<eos> You're my daughter.<eos> And even if I did, poison?
I've tried, but I can only see how other people die, not me.<eos> If you had seen it, it would've looked a lot like this.<eos> I know how it ends for you, Crocker.<eos> I can see it.<eos> Just like Vanessa did.
Ava?<eos> This is Dr. Hamza.<eos> If she overdosed, she shouldn't be on morphine.<eos> It's a light dosage on a slow drip.<eos> I did a full liver and blood work-up.
I'm sorry, the place is a bit of a mess.<eos> Why did you say no?<eos> Why was the offer even made?<eos> I mean, Ferguson doesn't want me there.<eos> Yes, she does.
I'm sick of everyone and I'm sick of myself.<eos> I hate it here.<eos> I know.<eos> I told you, I didn't take it.<eos> Yeah, well, then who did, huh?
Mr Channing.<eos> Everything alright?<eos> During the riot, when I was held hostage... ..did the governor refuse to open the doors to isolation?<eos> Yes.<eos> She did.
No.<eos> I fucking killed him!<eos> I killed Harry Smith.<eos> I don't have psychotic episodes.<eos> I don't.
You had an hallucinogenic in your system.<eos> So I was drugged?<eos> So, you didn't take them yourself?<eos> No.<eos> I don't do that shit.
I knew she was a freak, but I didn't think she'd go this far.<eos> She's fuckin' demented.<eos> You believe me, right?<eos> Yep.<eos> Yeah, of course I do.
It was a relapse, Bea.<eos> Yeah, exactly.<eos> You get your hands on more booze and you'll have another one.<eos> Oh, and you'd know.<eos> Yeah, I do actually.
I'd walk through the front door and see you, and when you hadn't had a drink,<eos> God,<eos> I'd be so happy.<eos> But I knew it wasn't going to last.<eos> And it never did.
She's exactly right, Your Honor.<eos> That's exactly why we want to exclude this transcript.<eos> Because this witness, a stripper named Lexie Bromwich, perjured herself on the stand.<eos> Do you have evidence to that effect?<eos> Why, I do.
You worked with the defendant Mr. Tatro?<eos> Yes, I did.<eos> Hey, Brett.<eos> Do you have any memory of Lexie Bromwich?<eos> Yeah, I do.
- We have to tell the judge.<eos> - No.<eos> Listen, Amber.<eos> When we argued for the transcript to be admitted, we didn't know it was false.<eos> Yes, but we do now.
What... what are you talking about, Warner?<eos> Don't you remember what you said to me? No, I...<eos> I don't.<eos> You said that you loved me.<eos> No, I didn't.
Come to Jess!<eos> Righto, righto.<eos> You right?<eos> Jessie loves her Joshy.<eos> Yes, she does.
Er, did you notice anything about the boys?<eos> Clothes?<eos> Height?<eos> Er... I don't know.<eos> I didn't really...
Armageddon is tomorrow.<eos> Your mother has a bunker, she wants to save your life, so let's go.<eos> Well, actually, no, I'm sorry to disappoint you<eos> - but I don't wanna live.<eos> - But your nephew does.
My name is Meredith.<eos> We're gonna get you out of there, okay?<eos> That'd be great.<eos> How do we even start?<eos> We just do.
There wasn't anything you could've done.<eos> He was too far gone.<eos> - You don't know that.<eos> You don't know.<eos> - Yes, I do.
No, no, not everyone.<eos> I didn't. You didn't?<eos> I didn't know that.<eos> How about you, Monte?<eos> Did you?
So what's the plan?<eos> Just gonna wait up here until he shows, if he shows?<eos> Why do you care?<eos> You don't want me around.<eos> Mike does.
Laura said your family's all dead.<eos> - What?<eos> - Did you kill them?<eos> No.<eos> No, Toby, I didn't.
What about the horse?<eos> What about the horse?<eos> We're gonna eat it.<eos> Dinner parties don't grow on trees, darling.<eos> French do it all the time.
Liam's been gone less than a week.<eos> The body's still warm.<eos> There is nothing going on between me and Fisher.<eos> Okay, well, if you want my opinion on turning Liam down...<eos> I don't.
I don't know.<eos> Um, Laura and I have to go look at houses later this afternoon, so...<eos> What's Wrong with my house?<eos> You knew we weren't gonna live here forever.<eos> I do now.
Look, I'm sorry.<eos> You're sorry?<eos> This is not easy for me, either.<eos> I love you guys.<eos> I really do.
What are you saying, Fritz?<eos> What I'm saying is just--<eos> Is that a decoder ring?<eos> I know that I'm no war hero or even brave, and I have sciatica, and--<eos> I do!
- What about you, Abby? Any cravings?<eos> Oh, it's usually just whatever they're out of at the commissary.<eos> Oh, the commissary's a disaster.<eos> You should see the shopping list I foist on Robert when he's traveling.<eos> You do a lot of traveling, don't you, Dr. Oppenheimer?
This test-- this test is the start of a whole new era.<eos> This is like Auro's interplanetary cruise ship crash-landing on Jupiter.<eos> I don't know, I--<eos> I just- - I don't need the prestige.<eos> - Maybe most guys do, but--
It's a-a hotline to the pastor so that we can talk church business at any time.<eos> Okay, you're good to go.<eos> Oh, I-I see. So you can conduct your affairs without me knowing. What affair?<eos> I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> Neither does she.
- Uh-huh. Well, this is definitely not the weekend I was expecting.<eos> Well, I guess we shouldn't be completely surprised.<eos> His voice mail was sung to the tune of Candle in the Wind.<eos> [sighs] The main thing is he seems happy.<eos> He really does.
Look at all these posters.<eos> Oh, I can't!<eos> If I wasn't gay already...<eos> I wouldn't know the first thing to do with this.<eos> Yeah, neither do straight guys.
He said you threatened him?<eos> Well, you've just got to pity some people, haven't you?<eos> Fantasist.<eos> But why would he make that up?<eos> He didn't.
No.<eos> No blood, no shell casings, no nothing.<eos> Hey, doesn't this remind you of, uh, that sketch from "Saturday Night Tonight" where, uh, Mickey Franks plays Sherlock Holmes' wacky cousin?<eos> No, I don't watch that stupid show, bro.<eos> - You don't?
And when Sid didn't want to go along, van Zant opted for revenge instead.<eos> Where is van Zant now?<eos> He's registered at a hotel up in Queens.<eos> Yo. I sent van Zant's photo to security at "S.N.T.," asked if anybody saw him last night.<eos> No one did.
I haven't seen any of my friends.<eos> No, th-they're here.<eos> You know, th-they're around.<eos> Yeah, no one wanted to miss the chance to party with San Francisco's... sexiest bachelor.<eos> No, they didn't.
Is he?<eos> You saw us kiss.<eos> That's the only explanation for your big sudden gesture to Jake.<eos> - Gabi...<eos> - Don't Gabi me! Okay?
I can't believe you did this.<eos> Are you sure about this?<eos> I'm sure.<eos> I don't know how to thank you.<eos> Yeah, you do.
Maybe.<eos> - Put that on.<eos> Oh, you're so cute. - (Knock on door)<eos> Who wants a virgin eggnog?<eos> Ooh, I do.
You were right.<eos> I was a dick in that meeting and again in the bathroom and again with Jessica.<eos> I said some things that I wish I could take back, but we've been friends with each other for a long time, and I don't want to throw that away.<eos> You really mean that?<eos> I do.
What the hell are you talking about?<eos> Stripes.<eos> I'm just quoting Stripes.<eos> It's a movie.<eos> Harvey and I do this all the time.
- Look at her... mocking me with her noodles.<eos> Will you talk to her?<eos> - Laura?<eos> - Yeah. She loves you.<eos> She does, doesn't she?
She thinks that... We're in love.<eos> Krista needs to avoid dickheads like you in the future.<eos> Her radar needs fixing.<eos> I'll know if you skip any detail.<eos> So don't.
The fucking Congo can wait.<eos> Oh, your troubles are weighing heavily on you.<eos> I'm not entirely sure why.<eos> I was told that you know the person responsible.<eos> Of course we do.
Pheromones.<eos> The scent lets him know you're ready to engage.<eos> Like a wolf.<eos> But what if I don't have a scent?<eos> You do.
Is there any more soy sauce?<eos> Why'd you do it?<eos> Why'd you cheat?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Yeah, you do.
Valerie got divorced?<eos> [Valerie] Laura and I have to go look at houses later this afternoon.<eos> What's Wrong with my house?<eos> You knew we weren't gonna live here forever.<eos> I do now.
Oh, how did I know that?<eos> Because my mother called him and asked him.<eos> - Oh, yeah. - Mm-hmm. - You didn't Want to know.<eos> No, I did not want to know.<eos> No. No, and now I do.
- to drop our other two suspects.<eos> - With all due respect, sir, there are no other suspects.<eos> - Korsten has the polonium.<eos> - You don't know that.<eos> Yes, sir, I do.
Excuse me.<eos> Trooper Collins. Go.<eos> We need to talk to that driver.<eos> I tried to stop.<eos> I did.
- So...<eos> - So...<eos> You want to go out with me?<eos> I mean, if you're into the whole French cowboy thing...<eos> Of, course, I do.
Just for you to dump me.<eos> Now you're not gonna let Mariana date me either?<eos> I already told Mariana, if you two want to date, I don't have any rights to stand in your way. Okay?<eos> - You're right.<eos> You don't! - No.
We can try to be right, we can try to be good.<eos> We can try to make a difference, but it's all bullshit.<eos> 'Cause intentions are irrelevant.<eos> They don't drive us.<eos> Daemons do.
Because, after that, you could be stationed anywhere. Yes, sir.<eos> - Fighting in any number of possible conflict areas.<eos> I understand your concern.<eos> It's not that we don't like you, Jack.<eos> We do, very much.
Since when was it necessary to have a licence for tea and biscuits?<eos> The war will shortly require each of us to have a licence for breathing in and another for breathing out.<eos> £5 seems remarkably steep.<eos> You'd think the authorities would have more important fish to fry than frying us over this. You would.<eos> And they do.
I was just hearing about your accident.<eos> I'll just say hello and then I'll leave you both in peace.<eos> I thought you liked me. I do.<eos> - I thought we had a lovely time the other day.<eos> We did.
We couldn't go on across because the asphalt had melted.<eos> There were people on the roadway, some already dead, some still lying alive but stuck in the asphalt.<eos> They were on their hands and knees screaming.<eos> Some miraculously survived the inferno, reaching safety in rivers, canals and parks.<eos> Thousands more, however, did not.
But do they know about me?<eos> No, not yet, 'cause the reporter's gotta talk to them first and make sure it's safe.<eos> But...<eos> They'll love you.<eos> Just like I do.
- Quite a few headlines.<eos> - Well, this is another one.<eos> Right, Odelle Ballard.<eos> - You have information?<eos> - I do.
How you took down a Goliath organization<eos> - like SOC...<eos> - I've got good aim.<eos> Precisely why I want to keep you.<eos> No, you don't.
He send anyone else in here buying Bibles?<eos> Um... a girl.<eos> Uh, she's in her 20s... brown hair, pretty.<eos> And you wouldn't know where I could find this pretty girl, would you?<eos> No, I don't.
And her tehuana dresses.<eos> You're gonna love them.<eos> What is your guys' obsession with frida kahlo?<eos> I don't get it.<eos> I never did.
No Layla tonight?<eos> Jeff wanted the focus to be all on you... right where it should be.<eos> Damn straight.<eos> Kick ass tonight.<eos> I always do.
Uh, white, white, white, white, half-Asian, then you.<eos> Whoa, so that half-Asian guy, he was kind of a gateway drug to me?<eos> I guess so.<eos> Who knows what will be next?<eos> I do.
Well, I'm eager to hear what was so urgent.<eos> Have a seat.<eos> Okay, then.<eos> You know, I thought that we were gonna be friends, Hap.<eos> I really did.
I want to be sure that's your official statement.<eos> If you didn't catch it, you can always borrow someone else's notes after class.<eos> And that you will well and faithfully discharge the duties of the office on which you are about to enter,<eos> - so help you God?<eos> - I do.
- Go on!<eos> Six bullets, just what I left William.<eos> I should've died.<eos> I should've died, not her.<eos> Well, you didn't for a reason.
You're running around here half naked.<eos> Just be what you are.<eos> Hmm? You're an exhibitionist.<eos> You like to be looked at.<eos> - Oh. - You do.
This is one time.<eos> It's never gonna happen again.<eos> Neither is this.<eos> That never happens again.<eos> Fucking done.
Neither one of us ever back down from a fucking argument.<eos> She fights harder than I do.<eos> Let me ask you a question.<eos> - Do you love her?<eos> - I do.
Dana Sloan, sister of the bride, rang.<eos> Danny, oh, my god.<eos> I swear, you've ruined everything.<eos> Call me.<eos> Actually, don't.
- Yes.<eos> No, I haven't seen them.<eos> I'm so busy.<eos> Stupid, I don't have time to see much.<eos> - I don't...
"Give a man a gun and he can rob a bank, but give a man a bank, and he can rob the world."<eos> It's a bit of a silly expression, actually.<eos> A little reductive, but still...<eos> I like it, for the same reason most people hate it, because to me it means that power belongs to the people that take it.<eos> Nothing to do with their hard work, strong ambitions, or rightful qualifications, no.
No one knew why.<eos> Then one day he told me.<eos> He had leukemia.<eos> Made me swear to never tell anyone, especially my mom.<eos> So I didn't.
Because you say annoying stuff like that, Danny.<eos> You make me a better person, and I make you a better person.<eos> No, no, no, no, no, no, you don't know what you're talking about.<eos> Okay, Mindy?<eos> Just do me a favor.
I'm looking at pictures from the shoot this morning.<eos> Oh, yeah?<eos> I look good?<eos> Well, I haven't gotten dressed yet, If that tells you anything.<eos> Yes, it does.
You answer no to our questions, we'll all go away.<eos> What questions?<eos> Does your wife drink mint tea?<eos> D... w-what if... what if she does?<eos> A lot of people do.
Clara, what are you playing at?<eos> The chronolock!<eos> Take the teleport off him first!<eos> I don't have it, I'm telling you.<eos> Clara does!
Take the teleport off him first!<eos> I don't have it, I'm telling you.<eos> Clara does!<eos> No...<eos> No, you didn't.
Clara does!<eos> No...<eos> No, you didn't.<eos> Go on, then. Take it off.<eos> Clara, you didn't...!
You always care. Always have.<eos> Your reign of terror will end<eos> - with the sight of the first crying child and you know it.<eos> - No, I don't.<eos> I do.
Don't run.<eos> Stay with me.<eos> Nah.<eos> You stay here.<eos> In the end, everybody does this alone.
Married the diamond(! )<eos> Hello?<eos> Sir...<eos> - .. the ship, it came down, did you see it?<eos> - Yes, I did.
Why are you sad?<eos> Why are YOU sad?<eos> I told you, my diary's nearly full.<eos> I worry.<eos> Please don't.
That thing you were talking about earlier, about Matty?<eos> Oh.<eos> You want to know the secret?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Do I?
- Why would you say that?<eos> - Because it's the truth, Brian.<eos> They had this fun little thing in Mexico, and she got carried away and agreed to marry him because she thought he'd be shipping off before she ever had to go through with it, and she got all caught in these wedding details,<eos> Jenna.<eos> She never did.
Okay.<eos> You win.<eos> Nobody treats me like that and lives.<eos> Do you even know who the hell I am?<eos> Do you? !
You're not the first Castithan concubine that has attempted to murder me.<eos> Your people know nothing about my physiology, and that's exactly the way I like it.<eos> I have lived for many, many centuries, and the longer my people live, the more difficult we are to kill.<eos> So why do you want me dead?<eos> Actually, I don't.
What shall you do?<eos> In my entire life, no man has ever made a meal for me.<eos> I feel I should thank you.<eos> You know whose badge that is.<eos> Of course I do.
- You have to.<eos> But... why don't we just send them all home?<eos> Okay, fine.<eos> Then you tell Daphne why you have a problem with Larry 'cause you're the one who said you didn't want the kids to know about our financial problems.<eos> No. I don't.
I don't get to know what will happen.<eos> I won't get to know why it happened, what I did right or wrong.<eos> Not now.<eos> I have to live with that.<eos> You do, too.
Till we meet up with my friends.<eos> They got a car.<eos> You can ride with them.<eos> How many friends you say there were?<eos> I didn't.
Thank you.<eos> So... Now what?<eos> He wants to see you fight.<eos> But I thought he loved me.<eos> He does.
- Jay.<eos> Don't try and diminish me.<eos> Let me ask you something.<eos> Do you think Laura wants a relationship with you?<eos> - Yes, I do.
Don't try and diminish me.<eos> Let me ask you something.<eos> Do you think Laura wants a relationship with you?<eos> - Yes, I do.<eos> - You do?
Miracles don't happen.<eos> I won't argue, but you're making a mistake.<eos> I can get you an appointment.<eos> - I don't want that.<eos> - You don't?
She has ancient documents in her possession that cast doubt upon the Church's most significant teachings.<eos> I find it difficult to believe that a man as pious as Archdeacon Robinus would endanger the life of a child.<eos> But we must meet Robinus and his Rosula to find out if it is indeed a harsh truth or the delusion of a potion maker.<eos> You do not think it is a delusion.<eos> I do not, my lady.
I hope one of those burn for me.<eos> Are you in need of prayers, Sir Brattle?<eos> From the moment my eyes open till they close again with sleep.<eos> Do you truly believe the vision we shared was that of our child's birth?<eos> I do.
- I have a beautiful soul.<eos> - Yes, you do.<eos> I have the soul of a warrior!<eos> - Yes, you do.<eos> - I do!
Happy?<eos> I left her first.<eos> She was depending on me, and I got on that bus, and I left her here.<eos> So I know how you feel.<eos> [Crying] No, you don't.
Hey, uh, before you go, I just want to say...<eos> I had a really great time.<eos> I mean, it worked.<eos> We worked.<eos> Of course we did.
Yeah.<eos> Me, too.<eos> Do you have any idea who shot you?<eos> Did you see their face?<eos> Yes, I did.
Why are your clothes still on?<eos> I thought we had a deal.<eos> You know, if you want to be a good FBI agent, you're gonna have to learn how to lie better.<eos> You didn't have a date tonight with Brandon... o-or anybody, I figure.<eos> No, I didn't.
Well, great.<eos> Get your hands off me.<eos> Look, it's okay.<eos> We both said things we didn't mean.<eos> Yeah, and some things we kind of did.
does it make me creepy that I notice that you get up every time Alex leaves a room?<eos> Or that you go on long runs in the woods by yourself?<eos> Or that you somehow seem to know this campus like the back of your hand... that's creepy!<eos> You really want to know what's creepy? !<eos> - Yes, I do!
Hiding behind those monitors.<eos> - Shelby, please. - No.<eos> This morning, we said we weren't gonna make any more choices that we regret.<eos> So I hope that you can live with this, Alex.<eos> I really do.
- Wait, what?<eos> - Yeah, what?<eos> Sue's gonna change the tire.<eos> If she does it the way I taught her, it shouldn't take long.<eos> It did.
Oh, please. Do you expect me to believe you actually care about them?<eos> I care about the account, and we're running out of time.<eos> Do you have anything useful?<eos> - Maybe.<eos> - No, you don't.
That's a weird new attitude.<eos> Yeah, Dr. Reed's been in a real good mood since he started getting it on the reg.<eos> On the reg with Whitney?<eos> Well... She knows you're going out, right?<eos> Indeed she does, Danny.
No!<eos> After a long day of being a Modern Mominista, there's no better reward than your hubby's appreciation.<eos> Welcome, my beautiful breadwinner.<eos> Wow. Place looks great.<eos> - Doesn't it?
But that's not who you are.<eos> You...<eos> You're wrong.<eos> - I know the real you, Lincoln, and you...<eos> - You don't.
Is he?<eos> Or is he meeting contacts at places where it's just very easy to blend in?<eos> Might've planned this whole thing out.<eos> I doubt he planned on getting arrested in Singapore.<eos> Nobody does.
We're federal agents!<eos> Okay, how about, uh, a hundred thousand dollars each?<eos> Open the door!<eos> I have a gun.<eos> No, you don't.
It's different, Ollie.<eos> Both of our parents died because...<eos> That's how we know each other.<eos> I really don't want to talk about this right now.<eos> What if I do?
Both of our parents died because...<eos> That's how we know each other.<eos> I really don't want to talk about this right now.<eos> What if I do?<eos> What if you do what?
Motherfucker tagged me from behind.<eos> Took out my lower spine.<eos> Love you, guys.<eos> My wife... she was so ashamed of having a husband that the stank bitch didn't even show up to Fort Brag when they sent my ass home.<eos> But Melvin did.
Well, it's true.<eos> I mean, you've got a beautiful home, a beautiful family.<eos> And your partner Stef... what a great gal, huh?<eos> Yeah, yeah, I really lucked out in the wife department.<eos> Yeah, you really did.
Their tears.<eos> And their families' tears.<eos> You shut down your emotions for long enough, you don't want to spend all day with somebody else's.<eos> Does it bother you when I talk about my mother?<eos> It did.
You can say it, you know.<eos> - Say what?<eos> - "I told you so."<eos> You don't need me to tell you that getting involved with Ray was a bad idea... you know that on your own.<eos> I do.
I wanna stay.<eos> _<eos> Positive.<eos> I have those feelings too sometimes.<eos> You do?
Had two men with him.<eos> You know, my experience is limited, but I'd say they were professionals.<eos> It was Hydra.<eos> Don't know why they'd be after me.<eos> - I do.
I used to walk around that fancy campus and think, what am I doing here?<eos> My mom works at a box store.<eos> Who cares what your mom does for a living?<eos> You did deserve to be there.<eos> You do.
And we need money for boat tickets and a bribe for the visas.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> This shit is fascinating.<eos> Did you know there is such a thing as inherited trauma in your actual DNA?<eos> No, I did not.
What have you done?<eos> - Melinda, don't...<eos> - Unh! Let me go!<eos> Don't do that!<eos> I don't ...
- Every day.<eos> Phantom pain.<eos> The thing that's missing is the thing that you feel the most.<eos> - Makes it hard to forget.<eos> - So maybe you don't.
I won't do it again.<eos> But you have to stop this.<eos> Melinda...<eos> How'd you know that wouldn't kill him?<eos> I didn't.
No.<eos> You've been investigating this for two years and you haven't told them?<eos> It's a family thing, Laurel.<eos> I would think you, of all people, would understand keeping secrets when it comes to the death of a sibling.<eos> I do.
I... I, uh...<eos> I didn't know where else to go.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I shouldn't have come here.<eos> But you did.
Maybe. It...<eos> It's possible we saw what we wanted to see.<eos> I have one last far-fetched question, but<eos> - we have to ask.<eos> - No, we don't. No, we don't.
Why are you just standing like that?<eos> Like a man, come on.<eos> Director if you don't play good, your contract will be gone.<eos> What you guys doing in front of a child?<eos> Director, nicely done.
I don't know.<eos> I think...<eos> Yes.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, of course you do.
I think...<eos> Yes.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, of course you do.<eos> Of course you do.
You're the most amazing thing at this party.<eos> Well, excuse me!<eos> I'm not even the best Simpson at my best friend's party!<eos> Do you know what it's like to be second-best at anything?<eos> Yeah, I do!
Don't want to?<eos> You have no idea what it is like, Cotton, to be filled with ideas, with dreams, with visions of how things should be, and yet be utterly powerless to do anything about them.<eos> That is what it is to be a woman.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> Of course you don't.
Darius McCrae wrote something for me?<eos> He did.<eos> He wanted to apologize.<eos> You don't have to read it if you don't want to.<eos> No, I do.
Morning.<eos> So... we, um...<eos> Drank Chinese whiskey.<eos> And then?<eos> We didn't...?
Not here!<eos> - What is it?<eos> - It's the impossible.<eos> What made you change your mind?<eos> I didn't.
Which is why we're going to stop them.<eos> - Yeah, but why us?<eos> - I'm guessing we're all they've got.<eos> You two have powers.<eos> My other agents don't.
- Because I can't.<eos> - Harvey, what's going on?<eos> - Nothing's going on.<eos> How did you know those things about her in that deposition?<eos> Because I did.
I never welcomed you to the firm, and I should have.<eos> You know, when I was a young mother, First week of school, every day I dropped my little girl off.<eos> When I left, she cried.<eos> Friday came, I left, she didn't cry.<eos> So I did.
You just signed his death warrant.<eos> Put the bag man in the box and get him talking.<eos> I don't appreciate your tone.<eos> You want to know what I don't appreciate?<eos> We really don't.
Why she's so unbearable?<eos> That's why she's willing to drive an hour to work.<eos> She was humiliated.<eos> There's no one in our precinct who knows what happened to her.<eos> - But if they did...
Grinder, Grinder, Grinder, Grinder... It sounds like The Grinder has worked his magic again.<eos> The Ramirezes are going to be able to stay in their apartment.<eos> And so the hero makes his way out of town.<eos> Why do you have to go, Uncle Dean?<eos> - I just do.
All hail, Morpheus, eh?<eos> 'Deep-Ando.<eos> Conscript.<eos> 'Likes to think of himself as the joker of this little group.<eos> 'Well... he DID...'
You know exactly where he is and what he is.<eos> My child is breathing and talking right down the block from me at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, but I can't see him.<eos> I don't know how he is or what he needs or if he's even okay.<eos> He's surrounded by vultures who want to pick the flesh from his bones, but he doesn't know it.<eos> And I do.
Hamilton/Lookwood allows me to see any doctor I want with extremely low deductibles, and the prescription plan is awesome.<eos> Anything else?<eos> You said the promotion you missed came with stock options and a bonus of?<eos> The entire package was worth almost $2 million, but I don't know how that's relevant because I didn't get it.<eos> No, you didn't.
When I fail, she can move on.<eos> When you fail, there's no moving on.<eos> You turn to dust.<eos> What do you care what happens to me?<eos> I don't!
I can't believe I'm about to say this, but it could be booby-trapped.<eos> You could get killed.<eos> Oh.<eos> I didn't know you cared.<eos> I don't.
I finally told her that the reason I'm having a hard time falling in love with her is because I've already... fallen in love with somebody else.<eos> - With you.<eos> - Yeah, I-I got that.<eos> Hey, I know it's not okay. I know.<eos> You don't...
- but I am now.<eos> - Mike--<eos> - What if it doesn't work?<eos> - It'll work.<eos> - And what if it doesn't?
And the only reason it's gonna end that way is because that deal is coming from me.<eos> How the hell am I supposed to believe a word you say?<eos> What do you want me to say, huh?<eos> That I got tired of playing the goon?<eos> Because I did.
I'm going across.<eos> You won't make it.<eos> We have to get him.<eos> No.<eos> We don't.
Everlasting life.<eos> What's he talking about?<eos> Well... if you're interested... we've got<eos> You got a stuttering problem? !<eos> Well yes he does.
Coulda, shoulda<eos> You know they got a name for that.<eos> Yeah, well if we can't be self-critical, there's no room for self-improvement.<eos> Who said that?<eos> I did.
Bold.<eos> No fear of being caught.<eos> Exsanguination.<eos> You recognize this M.O.?<eos> I do.
Forgive me, Rachel.<eos> This must be the strangest thing you've ever done.<eos> Oh, not even this week, Your Majesty.<eos> You think you're going to get away with this?<eos> Yes, I do.
I don't think Dad would want that for you.<eos> And would he want me hanging out on a boat getting high?<eos> He'd want you to be happy.<eos> I know you miss him.<eos> I do, too.
Riley, everything is gonna be okay.<eos> Ross is just some guy you dated.<eos> He's not the one.<eos> - How do you know that?<eos> - I just do.
Light's mask.<eos> How did you get this?<eos> Iris shot it off Doctor Light when she attacked Linda.<eos> You know how to use the mask to find Light?<eos> Yes, I do.
But they may also come through you, Marcellus.<eos> Remember that.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I hoped I was wrong, Lucien...<eos> I really did...
I am here for the same reason Lucien and Tristan are... to protect my sire.<eos> Now, if you turned me that night like I'd asked, I would be here to protect you, but since you didn't, I need to know where in the hell is Rebekah?<eos> Elijah.<eos> I didn't realize we had a meeting on the books today.<eos> We don't.
You know what I learned?<eos> No one is gonna respect you until you show them who you really are, so if you're gonna wear old-lady choker scarves...<eos> You're gonna get old-lady goats.<eos> Is that all you got, a hunch?<eos> I don't do hunches.
You get a little yelly.<eos> Yelling is caring.<eos> Resheida:<eos> Oh, yo, Mr. J., did Zoey tell you I've been thinking about that Daddy's Day thing?<eos> No, I did not.
And that is how people wind up shot.<eos> That is exactly why we shouldn't have a gun in the house.<eos> Babe, I get it.<eos> And I shouldn't want one, either, especially after what just happened.<eos> But I do.
We have been so presumptuous.<eos> Oh, well.<eos> Of course you have your own culturally specific church.<eos> Yes.<eos> Who doesn't?
If you're not a parasite, you have nothing to fear.<eos> So what about Summer?<eos> Why am I always your go-to?<eos> - Never go in my room again.<eos> - I didn't!
Oh, you think so, huh, Morty?<eos> Well, let's see.<eos> Hey, wait-- huh?<eos> I don't get it.<eos> Of course you don't.
Oh, shit.<eos> Well, well, looks like birds of a feather... go to jail.<eos> Why was he wearing sunglasses at night?<eos> I hope you folks like community service.<eos> - I do. - What?
Dinner tonight?<eos> Totally.<eos> Let's hit that gravy truck.<eos> Okay, love you.<eos> No, I don't.
Let's hit that gravy truck.<eos> Okay, love you.<eos> No, I don't.<eos> Aw... "I love you.<eos> No, I don't"?
Yeah. But we had some good times, though, right?<eos> - Did we? - Right.<eos> Well, um, take care.<eos> Hey, I hope you can find a way to be happy, BoJack.<eos> - I really do.
For being so neglectful.<eos> You guys had your own stuff going on.<eos> I get it.<eos> No.<eos> You don't.
For a vote like a man and I did.<eos> And is Jack Soloff aware of this?<eos> Not only aware of it, he's voting for it.<eos> And however did you get him to do that? Let's just say that you wanted me to do this Like Harvey would have and not like I would have,<eos> But I did the best of both.
- But I am now.<eos> - Mike...<eos> - What if it doesn't work?<eos> - It'll work.<eos> - And what if it doesn't?
And the only reason it's gonna end that way Is because that deal is coming from me.<eos> How the hell am I supposed to believe a word you say?<eos> What do you want me to say, huh?<eos> That I got tired of playing the goon?<eos> Because I did.
I know what kills, I know what cripples, and what just hurts.<eos> Stop!<eos> Stop!<eos> He didn't take the drugs.<eos> I did.
W-What gun?<eos> It was you, wasn't it?<eos> Yes, it was him.<eos> I have right to kill him.<eos> Yes, you do.
No!<eos> I know exactly what you're doing.<eos> I just want you to take your pills like we agreed.<eos> - "Like we agreed."<eos> - Yeah, we did.
They know Assad's in the crosshairs.<eos> They know we have a likely candidate to replace him.<eos> Screw 'em.<eos> As long as they don't know the who and the when.<eos> They don't.
Yeah, it's all over the Internet.<eos> They keep mentioning classified documents... are they the same ones Laura Sutton was writing about last week?<eos> One would assume.<eos> He said as much on the video.<eos> - Who did?
Are you talking to anyone else about this?<eos> I told you there is no one else.<eos> I'm counting on you to do this.<eos> And I just told you I would.<eos> You did.
I always feel like I'm in second place.<eos> Wait...<eos> Are you breaking up with me?<eos> Because that's not fair!<eos> I didn't do anything wrong!
I mean, is there anything you don't know how to ruin?<eos> Dude, what was up with that?<eos> Yeah, why didn't you tell us?<eos> Well, do you guys want the whole story?<eos> Yeah, we do.
There's something different about him, something, ah, mystical.<eos> Mystical, really?<eos> We stop meta-humans because we're scientists.<eos> We can figure out what their weaknesses are, but we don't have any experience when it comes to guys like this, with magic.<eos> They do.
This is what was so urgent, Harrison?<eos> You get me to come here so I can take your speed drug?<eos> That's right.<eos> - You knew about this.<eos> - Of course she did.
Uh, Efram.<eos> You're fine.<eos> You're fine, you're fine, you're fine, you're fine.<eos> You're unclean in the biblical sense.<eos> Don't!
I mean, what did you want me to do?<eos> Tell me the truth.<eos> Come on.<eos> Do you have any idea how worried I was?<eos> Yeah, I do.
Thea said you were being a little more humorous lately.<eos> I'm sorry, how do you know so much about Savage, anyway?<eos> I don't know anything about him,<eos> Mr. Allen.<eos> No one does.
Savage lays waste to Central City.<eos> Yeah. We've been through this before.<eos> 1887, the Huang he floods,<eos> Savage killed nearly two million people to get to us.<eos> And he did.
Where is Merlyn?<eos> Said he had to attend to League business.<eos> Can't believe I'm gonna say this, but I owe him one.<eos> I helped out a little bit, too.<eos> Yes, you did.
♪ Sick of leaving things... ♪ The poems of sir Walter Raleigh, a proper Englishman.<eos> Oh, this looks like a decent edition.<eos> ♪ Sick of leaving things half done... ♪ Do you really think some bauble will convince the heretics to side with you over an evil step-daddy who spoils them rotten with ponies and ice cream?<eos> - I don't have a choice.<eos> - Yes, you do.
I do miss us hanging out together.<eos> Sorry I kind of went a little crazy.<eos> Ah, that's all right.<eos> And I'm sorry I will always love your wife.<eos> Which I don't.
No! Go!<eos> Do your worst.<eos> How...<eos> H-how did you know that would transform her back?<eos> I didn't.
Tell her I'll think about it and let her know.<eos> I don't believe in someday.<eos> Lucky for you I do.<eos> 'I hope the fairy tale works out for you.'<eos> - I really do.
So much for slowing down.<eos> - Eleanor.<eos> - What?<eos> Last night... you said you liked it when I said your name.<eos> - I did? - Mm-hm.
But wherever she is, one may assume her heart grieves.<eos> Well, she's a coward and a murderer.<eos> You do not understand the position she was in.<eos> You're right.<eos> I don't.
Yes.<eos> We all have.<eos> You still have me, Favi.<eos> That I do, Andina.<eos> That I do.
My job covers a wide range of responsibilities.<eos> You ever heard of Bankers Trust in Sacramento?<eos> Maybe you've heard of Simon Kincaid.<eos> I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> Yeah, you do.
I think we can handle him.<eos> No, you don't understand.<eos> He's not what he seems.<eos> We know all about him.<eos> No, you don't.
No.<eos> He's at work.<eos> It's a little weird getting used to being here again.<eos> - I can't even imagine.<eos> - Don't.
Uhtred?<eos> Father Beocca.<eos> My goodness.<eos> - You know this hassling, father?<eos> - I do. Yes, I do.
This is Center Stage.<eos> It demands your respect.<eos> Sorry, Dr. Lorenson, but did you want to lay down?<eos> No.<eos> Uh, no. I didn't...
Plenty of O-neg.<eos> You get any sleep today?<eos> Yeah.<eos> - I know when you're lying.<eos> - No, you don't.
This time it's on me.<eos> God, I'm so stupid.<eos> Amanda, don't.<eos> I believed him.<eos> We all did.
Beslan?<eos> What about Beslan?<eos> He wasn't with Tamir.<eos> - Do you have eyes on him?<eos> - We don't.
Tamir told me that Dmitry... that I killed your husband.<eos> That's why he attacked me.<eos> So I had to kill him before I could find out where Kate is.<eos> You didn't kill Doku.<eos> I did.
What kind of person asks a cancer patient for proof?<eos> But why would anyone fake something like this?<eos> It's funny you should ask.<eos> Laura has a theory.<eos> Of course she does.
I just thought that maybe because you saw us together that it might make you feel differently.<eos> It doesn't really matter what I feel.<eos> Laura, is there something you're trying to tell me?<eos> Or that you want me to say?<eos> You already did.
But I'm also not ready to give up on this place.<eos> It was the future I wanted to build.<eos> I don't think mother nature felt the same way.<eos> I really cared about it.<eos> I still do...
You're being stupid.<eos> So stop it.<eos> Right now, we have to clean up this mess.<eos> No.<eos> We don't.
We'd share one heart because we took the same kind of risk that Emma took.<eos> We save each other.<eos> That is what our family does.<eos> So have some faith in her.<eos> I do.
But that's what she said.<eos> She said, "I want Ricky to do me in my office."<eos> Lots of times.<eos> Didn't she also say, "Lots of times?"<eos> Yes, she did.
- You've just been given an examination of your magical aptitude.<eos> - "Magical"?<eos> - We had reason to believe you possess certain... nascent abilities. - Okay.<eos> I mean, I used to think that...<eos> - And perhaps you did at one time.
Copycat or no, why go back to this town and do this again?<eos> They could be sending some kind of message to announce their return.<eos> Or it just might be criminal ego.<eos> They got away with it the first time.<eos> Why not do it again?
About the other night.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> It doesn't have to mean anything.<eos> We just... Had fun.<eos> Well, at least I did.
I'll have no need to be hostile if she stops acting like I'm the one on trial here, Your Honor.<eos> You watch yourself, Ms. Keating.<eos> You're a material witness here today, nothing more.<eos> Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?<eos> I do.
- No, you're the idiot because you told him.<eos> It's hard to explain, but everyone in there... we know a lot about each other, even the really bad things.<eos> Oh, like the fact that I'm positive?<eos> No.<eos> I didn't...
Lock me up.<eos> That way, you can all finally be safe.<eos> Caleb and Catherine Hapstall, you've been charged with murder in the first degree in the death of Helena Hapstall.<eos> Do you understand the charges?<eos> They do not, Your Honor, and neither do I.
MWA?<eos> Municipal Workers Association.<eos> So, what, two gunmen five minutes ago,<eos> NYPD called us already?<eos> No, they didn't.
I'm sorry.<eos> You know what I remember about that night?<eos> His eyes.<eos> They had this shine.<eos> Just like yours did on that subway platform.
The one we don't talk about?<eos> Sorry.<eos> I don't mean to push.<eos> When you were an operative, how did you know when you were in too deep?<eos> I didn't.
I've already notified my agency.<eos> What?<eos> Why?<eos> You love your job.<eos> I did.
They won't believe me if I tell them what's coming.<eos> But they might believe you.<eos> Well I'm in.<eos> Since when do you know how to ride a horse?<eos> I don't.
What is it about this girl that's got everyone's knickers in a twist?<eos> Including your own.<eos> I'm happy.<eos> Doesn't anybody care that I'm happy?<eos> Of course I do.
Her therapist is probably the only one who knows.<eos> She-she's some, uh, uh, Dr. Linda in-in Beverly Hills.<eos> Saw her, like, five times a week on the DL.<eos> Used a fake name, everything.<eos> Oh, did she now?
- Here you go, sweetie.<eos> - What?<eos> ! Don't give it to me.<eos> I can't go back down there.<eos> You do it.
Thank you.<eos> Will you come see us after?<eos> I will if I can, yeah.<eos> I loved him, Alex.<eos> We all did.
He wins again?<eos> He made my life a living hell.<eos> Now he's bent on keeping me here.<eos> My father... Started touching me when I was 8, told me if I ever told my mother, it would kill her.<eos> So I didn't.
You know, as fathers, we try to protect our-our children from every-every cruelty.<eos> But you can't be there every second of every day.<eos> You can't live their whole lives for them.<eos> I tried to be a good father.<eos> I did.
What's happening?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Yes.<eos> My heart, it took.<eos> It did.
Very carefully.<eos> What do we have?<eos> Vault's in the southwest corner of the building.<eos> We're really doing this?<eos> We really don't
Yes.<eos> We're not gonna be able to fight our way out of this, Lizzy.<eos> We're gonna have to think our way out.<eos> You really think he can help?<eos> I do.
Cover the back.<eos> This way. Come on.<eos> William, please listen to me.<eos> Shut up. No. I know what you're feeling.<eos> No, you don't.
It smells like the Jolly Green Giant's jock strap.<eos> Oh, my God, it's like...<eos> Stop.<eos> You gagging makes me gag.<eos> Okay, almost done.
Hey, thanks.<eos> - Sorry.<eos> - That's okay.<eos> I don't understand why you would react like that.<eos> No, Kara, you don't.
He would deliver Mullens and the money to me.<eos> It's a hell of a stretch.<eos> Hauser was my sergeant before he was my captain.<eos> We rode for two years, you don't know him the way I do.<eos> The way I did.
We're working on a new case.<eos> Case?<eos> So, are we both cops now?<eos> I know you got your pieces of the puzzle, too.<eos> - You always do.
- Dash. - Now!<eos> Where was he?<eos> I didn't see him.<eos> Dash, I missed.<eos> I didn't.
You two seem pretty chummy.<eos> We were wrong about Hank.<eos> He didn't have anything to do with my dad's death.<eos> - How do you know?<eos> - Just... I do.
Gabriel wants me to transfer all my assets to a holding company he controls.<eos> Gabriel got away with the money that was meant to buy his freedom from the Yakuza.<eos> Without it, we're both dead.<eos> It's not that I don't love you.<eos> I do.
The shared ventilation system provides all of us with roughly 150 cubic feet of oxygen.<eos> Divide that by 13, each consuming 1.5 cubic feet of oxygen per hour, we have one hour and ten minutes of oxygen left.<eos> I'm a Marine-- I spent a lot of time on a ship.<eos> You have immersion suits down here for underwater escape.<eos> Uh, we do, but not in this compartment.
Okay.<eos> I'm sorry to hear your friend is sick.<eos> Seriously? We have to put a bell on you.<eos> I know how you feel.<eos> No, you don't.
Let's go!<eos> I can't believe that worked.<eos> I can't believe I left my pants in there.<eos> I'm so glad I brought extra clothes.<eos> You did?
Oh, that doesn't make them innocent.<eos> These people would be murderers.<eos> Yeah, but the trick is, which one are we looking for?<eos> We have no DNA, no face to run.<eos> What if we did?
- Mm.<eos> I knew a man who worked at Lackland Air Force Base in San Antonio.<eos> Lucas Tollin?<eos> Mm, can't say I ever met the man.<eos> Sure you did.
Mark was a little agitated this afternoon.<eos> Then you know that the provisions bypass doctor-patient confidentiality.<eos> Denying access is a felony punishable by jail.<eos> How do you sleep at night, Detective, knowing that you work for a police state?<eos> Well, some nights I don't.
Could you isolate that sound?<eos> Yes.<eos> Oh, my God! It's wheezing.<eos> - I know who it is.<eos> - No, you do not.
I don't need a precinct to solve a case.<eos> Now, this tattoo was on the body of a dead convict found in Central Park.<eos> I know I've seen it somewhere before.<eos> I just don't know where.<eos> I do.
Someone on that list.<eos> Dean Feller, I'm sure you know why you're here.<eos> Actually, I don't.<eos> Well, we found the studio apartment.<eos> I don't...
You're not gonna get a signal.<eos> - You trapped me in here on purpose.<eos> - No, I didn't.<eos> But since you brought it up, tell me... why do you feel trapped in our marriage?<eos> I don't.
Wish me luck?<eos> Oh, you don't need luck.<eos> You'll be back.<eos> You always come back.<eos> And when you do...
- All right.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> Okay, so I've had about 20 minutes in the car to process this news, and I think I know what's going on.<eos> No.<eos> No, I don't.
Years, Mom.<eos> I mean, she reads magazines and blogs.<eos> She follows trends.<eos> She even sketches designs sometimes.<eos> She does?
Yeah, it's good energy.<eos> It's real.<eos> Cayman and company back there can be kind of soul-crushing.<eos> Why would you want to be friends with people like that?<eos> I don't.
You don't know the first thing.<eos> I know everything.<eos> My whole life, all I've seen are people making the same decisions that you're about to make.<eos> And it doesn't help.<eos> It never does.
You've always been a good lad.<eos> I made the right choice.<eos> The other one, Joseph, he was the Devil.<eos> Do you remember what I used to talk about?<eos> You didn't.
Yeah, we're not looking for physical evidence.<eos> What are we looking for?<eos> We are looking for George Mallory's camera.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I-I do this sometimes.
I mean, it just, it sounds so romantic the way you say it, you know?<eos> I mean, I could see it now-- you and Catherine in matching camouflage cargo pants on some very exotic shooting range, and you get down on one knee, and you say, "Babe,<eos> I mean, it's every girl's fairy tale.<eos> Oh, yeah, you want to hear a secret? Yeah.<eos> You do? Mm-hmm.
Hello, Ms. Rosewood.<eos> I'm Dante Harrell.<eos> There's no need.<eos> I know who you are.<eos> You do?
Want some more?<eos> No, thanks.<eos> I'm off to bed.<eos> - Did he really say "thanks"?<eos> - He did.
After all that talk of armies and ships, you defeated the English with nothing more than a letter.<eos> I can't take much of the credit.<eos> It was Mary's plan.<eos> How did you know it would work?<eos> I didn't.
Okay. ATF already knew that they had sold 50 pounds of the explosives to a Filipino arms dealer named Ramon Santos.<eos> I was able to get in undercover as a middleman between Santos and Madison's guys.<eos> We set up a buy, everything was going smoothly until the sale went down.<eos> Then... you saw the rest.<eos> Yeah, we did.
Double-double, animal style.<eos> My treat.<eos> Who's with me?<eos> You know they make animal-style fries, too?<eos> Of course I do.
People have been talking to you your whole life.<eos> You just got to pay attention to their mouths.<eos> "I did not read the Iliad.<eos> Maybe honesty counts for points"?<eos> It does not,
Hi.<eos> Good morning.<eos> So, we're here to see that guy.<eos> Do you have an appointment?<eos> No, we don't.
Of course... if it is your DNA under Paul Wilkerman's fingernails, we'll know soon enough.<eos> Which means you have a very short amount of time to cooperate.<eos> You could start by telling us which of Paul's heirs you were conspiring with.<eos> And I want to know what you did with Arthur's mouse.<eos> I do, too.
You took out<eos> - You know where my parents live? money and you're not paying it.<eos> - No, I've paid every cent.<eos> - Yes, you should... I can do that, it is not illegal<eos> - for me to do that.
The night she was killed. What do you mean, Chavez was killed?<eos> It was a set-up.<eos> They attacked us right when we got there.<eos> You know the FBI is still looking for her, don't you?<eos> You didn't...
They're crazy, what they're gonna do.<eos> They told you? No, no.<eos> Forget it.<eos> I thought you said they didn't talk to you.<eos> They didn't.
You know, 'cause she was chopped all up in a bag, right?<eos> Guys, look, uh, all right, look, maybe it makes sense if it's our killer's way of linking himself to the Vic?<eos> Okay, that's... that's pretty good.<eos> Since when do you speak Latin?<eos> I don't.
- Hey! It's good - Oh, hi!<eos> - to see you guys!<eos> - How are you? Nice to see you.<eos> Yeah, so I see you got some drinks.<eos> - Yeah, we did. We did. - Mwah!
But nothing...<eos> Nothing, I mean nothing destroys the Flexi-box.<eos> Aw, man!<eos> I used to love this commercial.<eos> Of course you did.
I don't want the kids to wake up.<eos> You want to take the box?<eos> No, I tell you what, why don't we just leave it here so she can visit her brother in the morning.<eos> Girl really loves her brother, doesn't she?<eos> Yes, she does.
She thought her world was over. Aasia, you never told me that.<eos> She picked up extra-credit work and she was going to withdraw her request on Monday.<eos> This, whatever's happening, it isn't related to that.<eos> I need you to believe me.<eos> I do.
But she didn't get off Scott-free.<eos> I just wanted to discuss the fact that you stole Mr. Solano's sperm.<eos> And let's not forget<eos> - Rogelio and Xiomara.<eos> - I totally do!
I just wanted to discuss the fact that you stole Mr. Solano's sperm.<eos> And let's not forget<eos> - Rogelio and Xiomara.<eos> - I totally do!<eos> - I totally do, too!
Have him sign my new contract.<eos> Of course I didn't read the contract.<eos> Who reads contracts?<eos> That's what I have lawyers for.<eos> At least I did, anyway.
Okay. Trust you on that one.<eos> Oh, no! I don't have magnesium.<eos> You can break up the flint.<eos> You have a fire-starter kit in your heel?<eos> You don't?
Oh, dear. I need a pen, though.<eos> Here you go.<eos> Thank you.<eos> We need to finish this right now. Let's go.<eos> All done.
So, you had to be dead.<eos> You did a good job.<eos> The 911 called the DNA on the broken windshield.<eos> Oh, yeah. I thought that would convince him.<eos> It did.
No, Phil, I can't. I can't.<eos> I am tired, and I am sweaty, and as much as I have tried to stay positive like you all day, I think sometimes we need to just face certain facts like corporate people are not creative, and ducks that haven't hatched in a month might never.<eos> Just turn the eggs, lady!<eos> You know what?<eos> Kind of done with birds for the day.
Maybe I can talk to him.<eos> Look, Gavin--<eos> Mr. Delgado, we both know you can take that site down.<eos> I don't choose who deserves to die.<eos> The masses do.
No Capitol Hill, no committees, no debates.<eos> I've created the purest form of democracy.<eos> By dispersing power directly into the hands of the people, no single person possesses the ability to tip the scales.<eos> And I don't choose targets.<eos> The people do.
What site? What are you talking about?<eos> Look at me and listen to what I'm saying to you, because I'm in no mood to repeat myself.<eos> We know what you've done.<eos> We know you have the power to stop it.<eos> No, he doesn't.
I am so sorry, but I had nothing to do--<eos> You killed her!<eos> No, she didn't.<eos> It's understandable that you would think she did,<eos> - but she didn't.
You're right... younger.<eos> Selena, Demi, Emma Stone.<eos> I heard she can play any race.<eos> - Stop, you know who it should be.<eos> - No, I don't.
Mommies, stop.<eos> There's no right choice, because we're all different.<eos> The only thing that's important is that you honor whatever choice is right for you.<eos> Oh, my.<eos> Did you... ?
Jane and Rafael, what name do you give your son?<eos> - Mateo.<eos> - Mateo.<eos> Michael and Lina, as godparents, do you promise to support these parents in raising this child, showering him with wisdom and affection?<eos> - We do.
- Mateo.<eos> - Mateo.<eos> Michael and Lina, as godparents, do you promise to support these parents in raising this child, showering him with wisdom and affection?<eos> - We do.<eos> - We do.
_<eos> Okay, Mateo's down.<eos> So... let's talk about Petra.<eos> I mean, if you still want to.<eos> No, yes, of course I do.
Justin was gonna sell the original painting.<eos> The two of you would split the profits, but when you found out that he was just gonna give that painting away, you got a little pissed.<eos> That's ridiculous.<eos> I-it doesn't prove that I killed him, either.<eos> No, but the hair at the crime scene does.
Of course I'm upset about him!<eos> He's Korean Channing Tatum!<eos> Come on, I'm sure you have an ex who's more attractive than you let on.<eos> No!<eos> I didn't!
I-I think I got a better pose for you.<eos> Allison...<eos> I always knew I loved you,<eos> (Voice breaking): But I had no idea how amazing it'd be to build a family and a life with you.<eos> But I do now.
- I have this, er... friend and he's seeing one. - (Whistles)<eos> - (Groans) - (Cracks nut)<eos> But, er... he doesn't trust her.<eos> - She's got this mother.<eos> - They always do.
You scared the hell out of me.<eos> When that door closed and I heard those shots,<eos> - I thought they...<eos> - Jane.<eos> They didn't, okay?
That man pulled every one of us out of that wreck.<eos> My whole body was broken.<eos> I couldn't move.<eos> - I know.<eos> - No, you don't.
Okay, settle down.<eos> I thought you and I had something<eos> - in the bank here, Leanne.<eos> - We do.<eos> We do.
They look so expensive.<eos> They are.<eos> We just wanted to say we're sorry.<eos> We were way out of line to think we knew what was best for you.<eos> Even though we do.
You know that.<eos> No one wants this hot potato.<eos> They disappear, we all sleep easy.<eos> My agency had plans for them.<eos> (chuckles) Yeah, well, who didn't?
Everyone is.<eos> But this is our hospital, and these are our patients whether we like it or not.<eos> And we are gonna push through as best as we can, and we are not gonna stop until every last patient gets exactly the care that they deserve.<eos> Got it?<eos> Yes, I do.
Or maybe it was just a bad signal.<eos> Oh, there she is.<eos> Babe?<eos> Nope, was trying to make sure you had a good signal.<eos> You do.
Oh, this is really exciting.<eos> I thought this area was just gonna stay forever.<eos> Who is?<eos> So you think you keep all the existing structures?<eos> I do.
So, you've just recently moved here?<eos> That's right.<eos> And do you believe this town is deserving of a Whole Foods?<eos> You know, I think it's changed a lot.<eos> I really do.
It's called "The Octopus"...<eos> Dominic's favorite position...<eos> mine, too... except Dominic also liked to get slapped in the face during it.<eos> Uh, how does this help Tanya's case?<eos> It doesn't.
H-how is that even possible?<eos> Look, this is just so you don't get in trouble, all right?<eos> We'll be right back, and then we'll figure out what to do with you.<eos> Well, how do -- how do I get it back -- my soul?<eos> Generally, you don't.
There's a lot of people that are looking for you.<eos> Sarah?<eos> You know my name?<eos> I know all about what happened to you.<eos> No, you don't.
Ah, well...<eos> What I've lost in speed, I've made up for in accuracy.<eos> Look, Jake, I understand your, erm...<eos> No.<eos> You don't.
I'm fine!<eos> How can you say that after what happened to you today?<eos> You had someone pull a gun on you!<eos> You nearly died...<eos> - But I didn't.
I'm gonna let you in on a secret.<eos> See, when Webber had this job, it was easier for him.<eos> And hunt had it easier than I do.<eos> You know why?<eos> - I don't.
You knew.<eos> Did you give him the drugs because you knew what he would do with them?<eos> I graduated college in 1973.<eos> Do you know how many women in this country had a college degree in 1973?<eos> - I don't.
Oh, it looks like Angela got us access to Ross's league.<eos> That's gonna be tons of information we're gonna have to go through.<eos> Lots of transaction logs, e-mails; not to mention, all the trash talking on the message boards.<eos> Oh, I love a good trash talking.<eos> Of course you do.
They ate pigs?<eos> Perhaps they got into a farm?<eos> No, these pigs were cured with salt.<eos> I know the murder weapon.<eos> You do?
And when you didn't approve the Aaron Rodgers trade, he was gonna oust you as commissioner.<eos> You can't prove anything.<eos> That's when a fight escalated.<eos> You grabbed your little meat holder there and stabbed him two times.<eos> How did you...?
Booth, you're questioning my knowledge of an injury to the sternum?<eos> Oh, really, you're questioning my, uh, gun shots.<eos> Stop!<eos> No!<eos> Don't!
Oh, really, you're questioning my, uh, gun shots.<eos> Stop!<eos> No!<eos> Don't!<eos> Don't!
I don't know what to do.<eos> Please. Tell me.<eos> How do you feel?<eos> Do you want to marry me, or not?<eos> Of course I do!
The kid is serious.<eos> Look kid.<eos> Don't even think about it.<eos> Do you even know how to shoot?<eos> Of course I do!
What are you saying?<eos> Don't you boys have to get going?<eos> Sir.<eos> - He didn't mean anything.<eos> - Yes, I did.
Not everyone dies hunting.<eos> Do what's right!<eos> The hunters here belong to the army.<eos> You know you can't come and go as you please.<eos> Of course I do, sir.
She knows what the hell this is about.<eos> It's okay, Frank.<eos> See?<eos> Annalise, he could have a wire.<eos> I don't.
I have some questions.<eos> Of course.<eos> Frank helped you, right?<eos> It's not like you and Annalise carried that body into the woods.<eos> He did.
- gonna handle this the right way? - Yes. And what does the "right way" mean?<eos> - I'll call you later.<eos> - They're dating?<eos> Michaela's pretty much the only other number he calls, but I don't think she knows who he is.<eos> But Wes does?
I understand why you did it.<eos> This can't be an easy decision for you to make.<eos> Then don't make me make it.<eos> I wish I had that much power.<eos> You do.
- Relax, Michaela.<eos> - How can I if we're about to get arrested?<eos> - No one's getting arrested.<eos> - How do you know that?<eos> 'Cause she does.
Hey!<eos> Keep your hands off of her.<eos> - Where's Rebecca?<eos> You know, don't you?<eos> - I don't.
It is peih-gee and tasha, monica and spencer, joe and kass have And spencer, joe and kass have the first section completed.<eos> The first section completed. Big lead for ta keo.<eos> Big lead for ta keo.<eos> Spencer and opinion ca -- monica Spencer and opinion ca -- monica struggling. Struggling.<eos> Tasha did this puzzle for her
For in this crisp time when autumn begins to fade, the chef brines chicken in habañero and even adds habañero powder to the crust.<eos> But the heat is restrained.<eos> You experience the fruity, delicious flavor of this without any spicy pain.<eos> I don't need anymore pain.<eos> Hell, does anyone?
You were engaged twice?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Before Wendy, there was Nicole.<eos> - You knew that.<eos> - No, I didn't.
Way it shook out, I, uh, I'm glad you get to watch it with me now.<eos> Edie can't get enough of this raw bar.<eos> Look at her go!<eos> - Do I know kids or what?<eos> - You do.
Why stage the crime scene?<eos> - I exaggerated it.<eos> - Why? Because I knew no one would believe me.<eos> - How do you know?<eos> - Because I do.
Not me?<eos> I-I'm still good, right?<eos> Find everyone who knew Jill and Steve and see if anyone witnessed the abuse.<eos> We believe her?<eos> For some reason, I do, yes.
Wes stole the key to the storage locker because this guy Bruno told him you went there the night Rebecca disappeared.<eos> So we unlocked it to see if her dead body was in there, but...<eos> We just found cash.<eos> - I know.<eos> - You do?
There is no "us."<eos> Suspect is in custody.<eos> I'm sorry you had to do that.<eos> I know he meant a lot to you.<eos> He did.
I find myself quite curious as to how you plan to spin the fact that Senator O'Malley was hacked to pieces.<eos> So you're saying Rick was dismembered?<eos> What's interesting is the placement of the hack marks.<eos> As a former surgeon, you know it is ideal to cut along the joints.<eos> Killer didn't do that.
Bastards were smart.<eos> Avoided the security cams, had all the right gear.<eos> Industrial cutters, just like those.<eos> Look familiar?<eos> Murder weapon did double duty.
- My husband? - Yes.<eos> He loves you, and he's gonna take you home.<eos> I'd rather go with you.<eos> I wouldn't know where to go.<eos> Tom does.
I actually find this very sad.<eos> Your principal ... he stinks!<eos> Not true!<eos> I showered this morning!<eos> Yeah, you do, you old dick!
You suck at video games, you don't like rap music, and you hate Chew Blast gum!<eos> No!<eos> Your bus driver sucks [bleep]<eos> You suck [bleep]<eos> No, you do!
You want to tell me why you ran an eye-dent search on Tendo Guinta?<eos> - Hawk-Eye showed...<eos> - You can go ahead and stop lying to me now.<eos> I met Arthur.<eos> How did you...
Any time they started a video chat, their conversations were redirected through the target's computer, allowing him to eavesdrop.<eos> All right, this is voyeurism.<eos> I mean, not in a classic sense.<eos> But our target is a cyber voyeur who became obsessed with Isabel after watching her on a computer and realized he couldn't have a relationship with Isabel in the real world, and ultimately killed her.<eos> Right, but if he didn't...
It's gonna take time.<eos> Yeah, but if we do it right...<eos> He'll lead us straight to Loksat.<eos> I thought you said lying was wrong.<eos> I did.
Oh, she's in surgery with Grey and Pierce.<eos> What do you need?<eos> I need to tell her her boyfriend's dead.<eos> He coded in the hallway.<eos> Well, how did he...
It worked?<eos> Since then I've been sensing things you've sensed and feeling things that you've felt.<eos> I wanted to bring us closer.<eos> I'm sorry, I had no right to do it.<eos> No, you didn't.
- Chief.<eos> - Hey.<eos> I just want to apologize.<eos> The whole baby thing...<eos> I didn't exactly...
I don't care about his judgment.<eos> I care about yours.<eos> Which in this case was nonexistent.<eos> I know, look, I...<eos> No, you clearly don't.
Then behold the true power - Aw man... - of the Beast--<eos> I got dirt in my special place.<eos> are you listening?<eos> Let me just shake this out.<eos> You done?
You're gonna say you love me but...<eos> - You don't know what I'm going to say!<eos> - I'm pretty sure I do.<eos> - It doesn't matter!<eos> You don't! - Fine!
Neither did we.<eos> Good night, son.<eos> D-Did I, uh... did I ever tell you about the time that, uh,<eos> Megan pulled the fire alarm to get me out of trouble at school?<eos> No, you never did that.
No work.<eos> So, just to get small talk out of the way:<eos> let's see, your dad is, uh, on a low salt diet, your aunt's become a lesbian, and the dog is eating his own poop.<eos> I have baggage.<eos> Yes, we do.
Max is a special boy, Merri.<eos> A brilliant boy.<eos> We only have 90 minutes left.<eos> You don't think I know that?<eos> Yeah, yeah, sure you do.
You power-walked out of here like a panther!<eos> We couldn't find you!<eos> Well, this is...concerning.<eos> You -- you have another bag, don't you?<eos> She did.
I should be, but my baggage<eos> - has proven impossible to locate. - Mm.<eos> I could leave a valet behind, but I'd rather keep these items at hand.<eos> - You understand.<eos> - I do.
I don't know what that is.<eos> And we're sure it's not that cardboard box?<eos> I-I don't think so.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I don't, either.
And genius insanity, which is a dangerous combination.<eos> Attacking with a genetic slime that modifies cells, turning facial skin pigments into a hideous death mask.<eos> You know Memento Mori is going to try to top this.<eos> Even though Gray is in custody.<eos> I do.
I need to get you three out of here.<eos> What about them?<eos> Put them in.<eos> What do we do when they wake up?<eos> How about they don't?
Oh. Well, that's easy one. I think you should...<eos> Hold out for something more magical, right?<eos> I should just wait for that special someone?<eos> No, I-I think you should say yes.<eos> You... okay. You do?
Her boyfriend?<eos> I don't know.<eos> At what time did Anna usually come home?<eos> You have to help me.<eos> Often, she didn't.
Then why do I have chills?<eos> I love Cher.<eos> I used to imagine she was my real mom and that one day she'd pick me up and take me away with her, and then we'd get matching see-through body stockings like normal mothers and daughters.<eos> Aw, that's so disturbing.<eos> Max, we did nothing wrong.
Sorry... good times.<eos> Um, okay, so... to boobs.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Did I just say "boobs"?<eos> Oh, yeah, yeah, you did.
Just plopped there.<eos> "Hello."<eos> He's waited 18 months for this kidney.<eos> We finally have one, and now he has cancer?<eos> What if he didn't?
"Hello."<eos> He's waited 18 months for this kidney.<eos> We finally have one, and now he has cancer?<eos> What if he didn't?<eos> Didn't what?
Right.<eos> Talking.<eos> Do we need to, though?<eos> I-i want to.<eos> If you do.
Yeah, we, um...<eos> Dr. Hunt and i go back a bit.<eos> Oh!<eos> Oh, I didn't realize.<eos> No. No [Scoffs] you didn't.
Hey, everybody.<eos> Like you all to meet my friend, King Julien.<eos> Say "Hi," Your Majesty.<eos> I don't have time to say hello. I'm the king.<eos> Old chunky-thighs Maurice does all the hi's for me.
_<eos> Stop, please!<eos> I don't know where he is!<eos> He's your brother.<eos> Of course you do.
So now what?<eos> N-N-No, no, no, no...<eos> Thank you.<eos> _<eos> - Did you...
That's very impressive, doctor.<eos> You do know your ortho.<eos> I want to apologize about before.<eos> It's not that I don't respect ortho.<eos> I do.
This is for you.<eos> She suggested we, uh, make one for Aidan in case you couldn't make it.<eos> That's so sweet.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I nearly didn't, actually.
Most of these units are owned by foreigners with big wallets looking to invest in Manhattan real estate.<eos> Hardly anyone even lives here.<eos> And her?<eos> Yeah, I sort of remember her going up one time but I never saw her come out.<eos> Maybe the night guy did.
I'll start you off easy.<eos> Electric eel, pufferfish, shrimp.<eos> I wouldn't fight the eel, because I know it can generate enough current to kill a horse.<eos> So I'd eat the eel, fight the shrimp, and befriend the pufferfish, because it would be nice to have company on those days I feel bloated.<eos> Very well done.
I thought you should know, Mr Bucket is looking for you.<eos> Here, was he?<eos> A fleeting visit.<eos> Funny he came here looking, when all the time he knew where I lived.<eos> He did?
- No.<eos> - She was taunting you. - Bad.<eos> That made you mad.<eos> Yeah. I don't like that.<eos> Yeah. No one does, Robby.
Listen, you cannot go by what Jade told you.<eos> Your teacher recommended him highly.<eos> - He's horrible!<eos> - You don't know that!<eos> Yes, I do.
You're not making any sense.<eos> I'm making total sense.<eos> You obviously just don't get what I'm trying to explain to you.<eos> When I took this job I thought you at least understood the basic concept.<eos> - I do. - No.
- What are you saying?<eos> I'm saying this is my home now, and I don't wanna be saved.<eos> - Sorry, Mabel.<eos> - No worries, bubble bear.<eos> - You did what?
Yes, I do.<eos> I've never taken my mom's pills.<eos> The only thing I take are my vitamins.<eos> Mom, you believe me, right?<eos> Yes, honey, of course I do.
Oh, no.<eos> I'm simply sharing my culture with my family.<eos> Why?<eos> Does that bother you?<eos> Yeah. It does.
It was quite a sausage fest.<eos> Ironically, they ran out of sausage.<eos> So I figured I'd take you up on your invite.<eos> I didn't invite you.<eos> Julie did.
Hiding behind the red velvet.<eos> We'll take these too, please.<eos> So, is that nice Mark boy still taking you to Monica's pool party?<eos> Not sure.<eos> We do weird phone call.
'Cause what you already have has been fighting for you all day.<eos> And if you have someone in your life that knows you're worth fighting for, then you're right, that's not a spark.<eos> Mrs. Glenn, that's a fire.<eos> H- how do I know he'll change?<eos> You don't.
I'm not sure I follow.<eos> You want Squad Three to be the best squad in the city, right?<eos> I do.<eos> And you have an idea, a vision, on how to make that happen, I assume?<eos> Of course you do.
There is nothing going on between Sebastian and I.<eos> I mean, I'm a happily married woman.<eos> I know that.<eos> So, um, what-what's really going on?<eos> I don't...
L-Look, these were things that I didn't even share with my own son.<eos> And she promised me that she would spend her entire career here at the Palace.<eos> Now, I invested a lot in that girl.<eos> And she broke her promise to you.<eos> She did.
Fine.<eos> Man!<eos> That was weird.<eos> I don't know what got into me.<eos> I do.
- Maybe somebody put her up to it.<eos> Look, you want this taken care of,<eos> I can look into it.<eos> Just depends on your tolerance for getting down and dirty, Chief.<eos> - No, I didn't do nothing wrong.
We got played.<eos> Let's figure out how.<eos> Is this because I clicked on that porno mail?<eos> I didn't mean to.<eos> We never do.
Okay, Dad, choose.<eos> - Yeah, Dad, who's it gonna be?<eos> Mike had to do something he never had to do in his whole life... pick between his two sons.<eos> So, he did the only thing a father could do in that situation.<eos> He didn't.
Solar flares happened on Air Force One.<eos> I was read in to that one.<eos> I know about the malware.<eos> Well... but not who was behind it, because we didn't know.<eos> And we do now?
I'll be right back, guys.<eos> Okay. What is going on?<eos> Gabe showed up for the parole hearing.<eos> I thought you didn't want anyone there.<eos> No, I didn't.
I supported your parents and the messages they beamed out against the Empire.<eos> It was part of the reason I was accused of treason and sent to prison with them.<eos> I do remember.<eos> Then you know what happened to them.<eos> Yes, I do.
Do you believe me?<eos> You have to trust me, Noah.<eos> I want to do this for myself.<eos> I don't want to be a doctor.<eos> No? You don't?
It's obviously a set-up, and we're pretty sure that Maddox is behind it.<eos> Her name is Serena Holmes.<eos> I need to find out if Maddox is paying her off.<eos> - I don't know anything about it.<eos> I honestly don't.
I don't need my damn lawyer.<eos> I just need y'all to let me up out of here.<eos> Well, the judge has ruled that you'll remain in custody pending the result of the new trial.<eos> You got nothing shows I killed those people.<eos> You never did.
All right. Now, there should be three more bags of clothing.<eos> Shoes, pants... undergarments.<eos> Good morning, Abby, Timothy.<eos> I understand from Mr. Palmer you have the Baltimore coroner's report.<eos> I do.
The DNA on the needle does belong to Joy Vanatter.<eos> And then I ran the residue from inside the barrel through Major Mass Spec, and it's black tar heroin.<eos> It's a very cheap low-grade form of the narcotic.<eos> That's weird, 'cause Cheech said that Vanatter was using, um, high-grade heroin.<eos> He did.
Not a tear.<eos> Everybody looking at me like -- Like I didn't love him.<eos> But he knew.<eos> He had to know, right?<eos> Of course he did.
That's perfect.<eos> Love is a gamble, right?<eos> We're just two gamblers, rolling the dice, you know?<eos> Yeah. You got to roll the dice, right? - You have to.<eos> - You do.
And now you come here to engage me in one of these agreements.<eos> If she goes back to Sudan, she'll die.<eos> You know that.<eos> No.<eos> No, I-I don't.
Thank you so much.<eos> You saved my ass.<eos> Oh, it's all good. [Sighs]<eos> - So, how do you know Jeff Scarborough?<eos> - I don't.
So you won't be needing a cadaver?<eos> Hardly knew her.<eos> Boom.<eos> Why, did you find one?<eos> No, we did... uh, no, we did not.
The Greek spirits of pain and suffering.<eos> I liked that.<eos> You also liked his plan to "KSR" Lucy Van Gaal.<eos> I did.<eos> I still do.
How else can I help you?<eos> What you did up there...<eos> Your Honor, we earned that, right?<eos> That wasn't about what I said in here earlier?<eos> - Because I didn't...
I-I'm so sorry for doubting you.<eos> But now we can continue to develop our friendship.<eos> I don't want to be friends with you.<eos> Rogelio, you don't know one thing about me.<eos> Yes, I do.
It stayed there, behind them gates.<eos> It didn't come out with me.<eos> I was happy when I got out.<eos> I probably was the happiest man on the Earth.<eos> - How you doing? - Oh, hello.
I just talked to the producers, and they said that if I take this, I can't have any contact with the outside world, so...<eos> I can't... talk to my parents or friends or see you.<eos> Well, that's really lame, but I think that you should do it.<eos> This is a really good opportunity for you.<eos> You do?
Emperor Franz-Joseph,<eos> Cosimo de Medici,<eos> Juan Luis Delgado.<eos> Juan Luis de Medici, I like it.<eos> Oh, fucking A, you do.
I mean, between you and me, yes, but between normal people, it's not the same.<eos> It's something else.<eos> Maestro Rivera, he asked me to go back to Mexico and take his place.<eos> - You accepted?<eos> - No, I did not.
I've been watching a lot of Discovery Channel.<eos> Did you know that...<eos> That there's a dead Marine in an alley?<eos> Yeah, I did.<eos> And now you do, too.
You can't be too careful, you know.<eos> Oh, so you're the idiot?<eos> You ordered your own test?<eos> 23% of people who have a first heart attack have a second one.<eos> 77% don't.
But I've never met somebody as cold-blooded... as him.<eos> To think what he did to that girl.<eos> Sit and think about that for a minute.<eos> - Think about her family.<eos> - Oh, I do all the time.
Correct?<eos> - Yes, if this is all November 5th. Yes.<eos> Well, if you take a minute and look through there and show me where Lieutenant Lenk signed in.<eos> Do you see an entry that Lieutenant Lenk signed in anywhere on that log on November 5th?<eos> No, sir, I did not.
- Did you see him do it?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - No, honestly, yes or no, did you see him do it?<eos> Don't lie about it.<eos> If you did, good.
- Yeah.<eos> - No, honestly, yes or no, did you see him do it?<eos> Don't lie about it.<eos> If you did, good.<eos> If you didn't, good.
A photographer.<eos> I ordered a dozen portraits.<eos> He said, "You're such a handsome young man.<eos> "Get three dozen."<eos> So I did.
- What's wrong? Your eye?<eos> - I hit myself pretty good, huh?<eos> - Do you believe in ghosts?<eos> - No.<eos> I didn't either.
Didn't you just take one of those a minute ago?<eos> Gerda, I know what I'm doing.<eos> I'm just going to get some fresh air.<eos> You know, sometimes I do wonder why you let me go through all this, if you thought that everything would be the same afterwards.<eos> I didn't.
I'm sorry, Princess.<eos> There was a reason.<eos> You say this to me... as if I'm blind to the moon's phase.<eos> I know what's in store.<eos> No, you don't.
I was in third grade and you were taking me over to Anthony Nadar's house for his birthday, and we were there early, so we gave him a ride around the block, and he was talking about how much he loved your car,<eos> and so you were all like, "This is gonna be Mason's when he turns 16."<eos> All right, first off, I have no memory of that, all right?<eos> Second of all, I would never say that.<eos> You did, though.
Who are you?<eos> Jim! The cool guy from the safari.<eos> Do you wanna "bowl" me a few pitches?<eos> I'm sure your father wants to do that with you.<eos> No, he doesn't.
Subterranean beast.<eos> Nasty temperament.<eos> Blind as a bat.<eos> How do you fight a Boggart?<eos> You don't!
Where's my shoe?<eos> The cops are up to something, right?<eos> Something to do with your son, with you.<eos> Why do they want you dead? How should I know?<eos> Same reason you do.
This is yours.<eos> Oh no. Come on.<eos> I'm packed too.<eos> Forget it.<eos> Jai, whether anyone does anything or not.
You did it.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Want to go fool around in the woods?<eos> Yeah.<eos> - Yes, I do.
Yeah.<eos> Want to go fool around in the woods?<eos> Yeah.<eos> - Yes, I do.<eos> - Yes, I do.
We're not interested.<eos> Well, I was asking your husband's opinion, Mrs Pemberton, not yours.<eos> Easy.<eos> Well, I don't want you to worry about it.<eos> Well, I do.
- When was that?<eos> - Two years ago. - You've been prescribing a rare, potent drug to somebody you met once in a coffee shop two years ago?<eos> He had medical records. He was representing someone else, but the name had been redacted.<eos> You have no knowledge of who's actually using this drug?<eos> None whatsoever, but I did nothing wrong.
- 38. Better schools, better jobs, Mr. Lake.<eos> This doesn't just... just end.<eos> Are you still a believer?<eos> Hmm? Do you still believe?<eos> I don't.
That's a good point.<eos> Mia, your man knows his punk rock history.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Oh, God, something just stung me.<eos> Who does that?
I'm not going anywhere.<eos> Hey, I just got here.<eos> They're saying he's through the worst of it.<eos> They were assigning his room, so, I thought I'd come here before I checked in on Kat and Den...<eos> They didn't...
Someone who turns a blind eye to what he does.<eos> There are some people in Scotland Yard that think that Jack is doing us a service.<eos> He kills his fair share of bad people.<eos> They believe that one in the hand is worth five in the street. Think they can... control him.<eos> But you don't.
And as far as he was concerned, the sun rose and set on you and your siblings.<eos> You're gonna be okay.<eos> - I know.<eos> - No, you don't.<eos> But I do.
According to these records... the only call, to the police, made from this office, took place at 8:53 PM.<eos> Sam, that feed went live at 8:30 PM.<eos> Fuck.<eos> Do you know who I am?<eos> Yeah, of course I do, you crazy bastard.
Just interesting.<eos> I've never known where I fit.<eos> Does it need to be a place?<eos> Well, I don't know what to say to the pair of you!<eos> No, really, I don't!
After 400 years of slavery.<eos> Am I the only one sitting here who's done nothing about this until now?<eos> I do know a few things about military action.<eos> Still, if you're not going to listen to me, then why did you take me away from my family?<eos> I didn't.
Shift's over, Jer.<eos> - Jerry?<eos> - Hi. Fiona.<eos> You said I should come by accounting some time.<eos> - I did? - Yeah.
I know, but why? Had she seen you before?<eos> Was it something about...<eos> It was possible that I might not have been the strongest candidate that they were looking at, but I had other things to offer, which I let her know, wink wink.<eos> She just wasn't going to give it to me. I wasn't their top candidate.<eos> Well, how did...
What do you tell him?<eos> That it wasn't my thing.<eos> - I'm sorry, Rich.<eos> - No, Milo, you don't ever have to apologize.<eos> You didn't do anything wrong.
We were young. He'd destroy me now.<eos> And you've beaten Bobby.<eos> That was a long time ago.<eos> Bobby has problems.<eos> So did Mozart.
You bought her free drinks and don't think I don't know that you did it on purpose?<eos> That was my stool and nobody sat on that stool because it was Cousin Marv's stool.<eos> And that meant something.<eos> That meant something!<eos> But it didn't.
Want to know what his name was?<eos> It's 2:00, Bob. It's 2:00.<eos> His name.<eos> - I would not know, Bob.<eos> - Yes, you do.
And may I say this pharmacy has the most impressive collection of douches I have ever seen.<eos> Well, thank you.<eos> High blood pressure, acid reflux, chlamydia.<eos> Never would have guessed.<eos> No one ever does.
Mostly clothes I don't wear anymore.<eos> Mom, what's wrong?<eos> Does he know what he's doing to you?<eos> No.<eos> He doesn't.
And if I go on and kill the Omega, you're dead.<eos> Forever.<eos> Why does it matter what happens to me?<eos> I wish... I didn't know you.<eos> But I do.
I'm sorry, my little one, but he's...<eos> No, look! On the ship!<eos> See?<eos> I do, Almitra.<eos> I do.
So, peg leg!<eos> What did your father think of your Night Fury friend?<eos> He didn't take it all that well.<eos> But then he changed.<eos> They all did.
I rushed to protect you.<eos> But what I saw... was proof of everything I believed.<eos> This wasn't a vicious beast... but an intelligent, gentle creature... whose soul... reflected my own.<eos> Valka, run!<eos> Don't!
If you do this, you do it without my support and without my future commitment.<eos> I understand.<eos> Good day, gentlemen.<eos> And for the record, Mr. Chang, my boys didn't fail.<eos> I did.
- It's always cold because the appropriate staff won't bring it into the rooms, so it sits and rots until one of my staff can.<eos> I know him.<eos> Can I go inside with you?<eos> Only if you wear all the protective shit.<eos> If you don't, I don't.
No meeting with his gay assistant.<eos> What?<eos> Do I embarrass you, Bruce?<eos> Yes.<eos> You do.
Last year I had five cards.<eos> Now I have 50.<eos> A collection of cardboard tombstones, bound together with a rubber band.<eos> I hate these fuckin' funerals.<eos> I really do.
- Yeah. He had a skiing accident.<eos> He should have a scar across the right side of his face.<eos> Chrissy?<eos> No.<eos> No, he doesn't.
If I'd have known you were in any kind of danger, I'd never have stayed away.<eos> I had to. For Adam's sake.<eos> He's our son, Chris.<eos> And he loves you very much.<eos> We both do.
Do I make myself clear?<eos> Hey, uh, by the way, did you see the polls tonight?<eos> That's pretty superb, huh?<eos> I don't think you understand me.<eos> I certainly do, sir.
It's all very confusing.<eos> And it's... Confusing.<eos> Very.<eos> -You know, Josh knows about us now.<eos> -He does?
He has been counted out.<eos> His opponents were, very often, much bigger. They looked much bigger than him.<eos> Every time he entered the ring, then I get scared.<eos> "Can he do this? Can he handle this guy?"<eos> And, he did. Amazingly, he did.
They know more about the maze than anyone.<eos> Wait, what?<eos> What?<eos> What? You just said "maze."<eos> I did?
And it wasn't any clearer about what had driven them apart either.<eos> They each gradually located a different karmic thermal... watching the other glide away into different fates.<eos> Does it ever end?<eos> Of course it does.<eos> It did.
Okay, we were trying to capture truth, but the truth of experience...<eos> I don't wanna miss his speech.<eos> You know, it's your responsibility to be honest.<eos> People are gonna believe it.<eos> I didn't do anything nobody else does.
- No, you control it. - Control it.<eos> You control it.<eos> Stop it.<eos> - You control it.<eos> - Don't.
I know.<eos> I fucking love you.<eos> Did you just say, "I love you"?<eos> No, I didn't finish my sentence, is what I did.<eos> Yes, you did.
Yes. This is my DI, David Knight.<eos> He's running the operation on you.<eos> I think it's best if we all have a chat.<eos> I've explained to David how we've been working so far. And now we want to work out something a bit more interesting.<eos> Do you?
Wait, wait, wait.<eos> Is this a fucking joke or what?<eos> That's not...<eos> What you doing, David?<eos> What you doing?
Yeah.<eos> You're a fucking terrorist, ain't you?<eos> They knock about together.<eos> Really? How do you know him?<eos> I don't, really.
Was that your first kiss since 1945?<eos> - That bad, huh?<eos> - I didn't say that.<eos> Well, it kind of sounds like that's what you're saying.<eos> No, I didn't.
Then finish it.<eos> Because I'm with you to the end of the line.<eos> On your left.<eos> Do you solemnly swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth?<eos> I do.
What does it say up here?<eos> "Deaf" or "dick"?<eos> Help me out.<eos> Stop! Leave him alone!<eos> Don't!
This is the most cliche hiding place you could have chosen.<eos> I'm...sorry.<eos> This is the stupidest hiding place. Take us to the Bahamas hiding place.<eos> I don't want to talk to you about England is because...<eos> I don't...
Just the man I wanted to see.<eos> - You...err...talked to Peter?<eos> - Yeap.<eos> I want to help you, Mr. Osborn.<eos> I really, really do.
So I suggest you do your job, Kattan.<eos> Now, if you'd like to finish that cliché you followed me into the pisser to unload...<eos> Did it involve my reflection?<eos> Maybe sleeping at night, how do I do it?<eos> I do it on a Tempur-Pedic bed, in a Highland Park home... with a Ferrari, next to a loving wife... with the ass of a high-school volleyballer.
- Couldn't make it.<eos> School.<eos> Oh. I didn't know kids in Chicago go to school in the summer.<eos> There isn't.<eos> They just do...
I just...<eos> I'll see you in court.<eos> Judge Palmer.<eos> Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth... and nothing but the truth, so help you God?<eos> I do.
-Got it.<eos> -Go.<eos> What the hell are you doing?<eos> I didn't tell you to activate it.<eos> I didn't.
I want to help the team.<eos> Really help the team.<eos> If you think I'm ready, which I am.<eos> Assuming you agree.<eos> And perhaps even... if you don't?
Two, but the little girl, she could really fight.<eos> She?<eos> What?<eos> You said she.<eos> No, I didn't.
Is it confusion?<eos> Is it doubt?<eos> Is it questions?<eos> I got questions.<eos> We all do.
We play with it.<eos> That's right.<eos> And he was a good man.<eos> He was a really good man, but I don't know what he believed in.<eos> None of us did.
I know I might look scary, but... I would never do anything to hurt you.<eos> Come sit with me.<eos> It's over.<eos> I know who you are.<eos> You do?
So, watch...<eos> Watch your fingers when you shut the canopy.<eos> Okay.<eos> Do you see the joystick between your leg?<eos> Yes, I do...
Well, that's sort of what life is.<eos> When will it end?<eos> It won't.<eos> - Well, it'll end when we die.<eos> - Don't do that, buddy. Okay?
Listen to me.<eos> I still believe in you.<eos> And I don't wanna give up. I don't.<eos> -But I can't. I can't.<eos> -What? Did you even...?
That I've trampled on the essence of the constitution?<eos> You want to spout that crap?<eos> Yes?<eos> Do you know where you are?<eos> No, you don't.
Rocket, you're drunk.<eos> All right?<eos> No one's laughing at you.<eos> He thinks I'm some stupid thing!<eos> He does!
Hopefully, they'll believe we're there to help.<eos> There's one more thing we need to complete the plan.<eos> That guy's eye.<eos> No!<eos> No, we don't.
Thank God for you.<eos> Girl doesn't show up and leaves me to handle two cabins.<eos> You're a lifesaver.<eos> If I pass out, just promise to catch me before I hit the floor.<eos> Not if I do first.
For what?<eos> Plenty of little chickens out there we can get for a handful of f-f-feed.<eos> See that's why I run this operation.<eos> You don't know nothing about retail markup.<eos> And you do.
What's wrong?<eos> Where were you?<eos> You left me in the concert.<eos> You stayed, huh?<eos> Actually, I did.
I hate surprises.<eos> You're going to like this one.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> It's for both of us. Don't get too excited.<eos> You didn't.
There are only five divisions of military intelligence.<eos> Exactly.<eos> That's the spirit.<eos> Mr. Turing, do you know how many British servicemen have died because of Enigma?<eos> - No, I don't.
You're mediocre linguists, and positively poor code-breakers.<eos> Alan, you can't just fire Keith and Charles.<eos> - Well, he just said I could.<eos> - No, I did no such thing.<eos> But Churchill did.
How's that different from talking?<eos> - Talking?<eos> - When people talk to each other, they never say what they mean.<eos> They say something else, and you're expected to just know what they mean.<eos> Only I never do.
Please!<eos> No!<eos> No. No!<eos> Well, then, it seems that your great big expensive machine doesn't work.<eos> - It does. - Wonderful.
That sounds like a better marriage than most.<eos> Because I care for you.<eos> And you care for me.<eos> And we understand one another more than... more than anyone else ever has.<eos> I don't.
And you care for me.<eos> And we understand one another more than... more than anyone else ever has.<eos> I don't.<eos> - What? - Care for you.<eos> I never did.
I wish that Franklin D. Roosevelt had lived to see this day.<eos> Was I God?<eos> No. Because...<eos> God didn't win the war.<eos> We did.
Lock on it.<eos> Jesus Christ. It's the President.<eos> Who the hell is that?<eos> Anyone here got an ID?<eos> Yeah, I do.
They are heirs to a European throne, Grace.<eos> And add to that the fact that you would have been a failure as a Princess.<eos> I don't want to say no to the movie.<eos> I don't.<eos> Well, don't.
What?<eos> I don't know, Phillip.<eos> Sometimes... sometimes you just look at everything and it's all just different.<eos> - Do you know?<eos> - Yeah, I do.
America?<eos> - Really, yeah.<eos> It says he carved it with a chainsaw.<eos> - Do you believe that?<eos> - I do.
- I'm calling the cops.<eos> - You don't have to call the oops.<eos> Look who came back.<eos> Yeah. I came back.<eos> - You did it?
Human will not forgive.<eos> You must go... before fighting begins.<eos> I am sorry... my friend.<eos> I thought we had a chance.<eos> I did, too.
- Everyone here? - Yeah.<eos> This is crazy, guys.<eos> Hey, can I use your cell? My son's out there.<eos> I got no signal. Yeah, yeah, yeah.<eos> I don't either.
What is this?<eos> The jellyfish commercial that you wanted.<eos> You said they were erotic yet deadly, like women.<eos> I never said that.<eos> - Yes, you did.
The jellyfish commercial that you wanted.<eos> You said they were erotic yet deadly, like women.<eos> I never said that.<eos> - Yes, you did.<eos> - No, I didn't.
Why is it called Xenophobe, anyway?<eos> Well, apparently it means having a fear of anything foreign.<eos> Well, if by foreign it means a drooling, alien creature that's gonna kill me, you bet your ass I fear it.<eos> When in the name of the ass are you going to do the Eee Tee? You are my last hope.<eos> Please do Eee Tee.
My party, my rules.<eos> Or don't you have the balls?<eos> Ray?<eos> You know this prick?<eos> Yes, yes, I do.
What's the capital of New York?<eos> All right, we'll try again, but there are rules.<eos> No upsetting questions.<eos> I didn't realize it was one.<eos> Well, now you do.
Four days.<eos> Okay.<eos> No, I think...<eos> I think it's a really good idea.<eos> You do?
Why is Ma Zouri in the stable?<eos> At least the French put him in a cell.<eos> - Here.<eos> - You believe this trash?<eos> Others do!
- Damn straight.<eos> Come on, Nick.<eos> Nick. - I don't know.<eos> - You know, I say we take it. I say we take it. - Yes.<eos> - Yes, we do.
Robert was my dad's name, I'm a Junior.<eos> He's not around, though, I don't really know him 'cause he left when I was a baby.<eos> Yeah, my dad's not around either, he did some bad things to my mom and so we left and I haven't seen him in a while.<eos> I kinda miss him, though, my Mom's being a jerk.<eos> They do that, man.
Abort.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - Hi sweetie, it's your father.<eos> You didn't forget, which means you probably love me.<eos> Of course I do, Zooey.
Right there.<eos> You doubted me, and my spy glasses worked.<eos> You, too, you're a sellout.<eos> No, uh-uh, you didn't get Emma's number.<eos> Yes, I did.
No, thank you very... No, thank you.<eos> I'm just trying to get a taxi and I can't get high enough.<eos> Taxi, Taxi!<eos> Oh.<eos> I didn't... Oh.
And how about you?<eos> Where'd you apply?<eos> You did apply, right?<eos> You're, like, super smart.<eos> Yeah, I did.
That's the original.<eos> Go ahead and touch it if you want.<eos> - No, thank you, sir.<eos> - That's okay.<eos> I don't...
You don't look anything like each other.<eos> What do you do? Um...<eos> She's my assistant. Works with me.<eos> And does she talk and speak?<eos> She does. Yeah.
Do something for me<eos> Invite Das to the club<eos> We'll do the coal mine deal<eos> Have you lost your mind?<eos> Do the deal there? In a public place?
So quit then.<eos> Go crawling back to Miami.<eos> Go ahead.<eos> - Ain't gotta be like this.<eos> - Yeah, it does.
You're not even a good artist anyway.<eos> - Joey.<eos> - What?<eos> I know you don't mean that.<eos> Yeah, I do.
Perhaps you can help me take my mind off things.<eos> Perhaps I can.<eos> I'm coming.<eos> No, no, no. I don't want that.<eos> Nonsense, of course he does.
I didn't want to die.<eos> What?<eos> Well, I mean, I...<eos> I thought I did.<eos> I did. I...
Okay, I'm going to go start dinner.<eos> Do you guys want your favorite, lasagna?<eos> Need some help?<eos> Hey, Big Joe.<eos> Yes, I do.
I was maddening a belt, but I can't make that.<eos> You're not yourself.<eos> What else is going on?<eos> I'm just asking.<eos> Don't.
It was an accident!<eos> Just a God damned accident!<eos> You don't, you don't want to do this!<eos> No.<eos> I don't.
Marianne, send them away.<eos> You brought them.<eos> - I don't want to!<eos> - Nor me.<eos> - I do.
You're both green.<eos> Talk to her.<eos> Do you understand what you're doing by staying here?<eos> What you're throwing away?<eos> - Do you? - Ah, ah.
What you're throwing away?<eos> - Do you? - Ah, ah.<eos> Take some deep breaths.<eos> I'm not throwing anything away.<eos> - Why do you always... - What?
I didn't realise you were, you know, exclusive.<eos> What was it you said earlier?<eos> "Girls for now, girls for later."<eos> - I didn't say that.<eos> - Yes, you did.
And I'd rather you be doing it in my camp than someone else's.<eos> I'm not just offering you a better lawyer, Alistair, I am offering you a future.<eos> Good.<eos> You know Lord Riot did not spell his name R-I-O-T, but R-Y-O-T?<eos> Nothing to do with riotous behaviour.
And stay down, Kresten.<eos> No, stay down.<eos> Stay down, Kresten!<eos> Lower your gun.<eos> Do it!
I am sure your whore mother sounded like a mule when you were conceived.<eos> Damn!<eos> Do you know how long, I've waited for this very moment.<eos> You felt that, didn't you?<eos> Of course you did.
- You think so?<eos> - Mmm-hmm.<eos> It makes me excited about us again.<eos> Do you feel it?<eos> - I do.
There, the cold does not laugh.<eos> The teacher is young, strong as an ox.<eos> But me, I need fuel.<eos> I think I'll avoid.<eos> I do not usually.
I should've stopped him.<eos> I guess I didn't because part of me thought that Jason might've been right about you.<eos> But things are different now.<eos> I never knew how much Nardo loved you.<eos> But I do now.
Do you ever make exceptions?<eos> I'll have it scanned for you right now.<eos> Would you say I was a good parent?<eos> Great. Do you have a pen?<eos> Uh... indeed, I do.
Sorry, do you want them back?<eos> No, I was making a joke about the Gs being like grands.<eos> Anyway, I need to close this door because it's freezing outside.<eos> Yeah. Yeah, I know it is.<eos> Yeah, of course you do.
Do you need a place to plug in your vibrator?<eos> How dare you?<eos> Turn that music off, Mary.<eos> You seriously like this?<eos> You seriously don't?
That's right, Jenn.<eos> The girl in the stupid picture with Sam, it's fucking Mary.<eos> Thanks, Zoe.<eos> She has a right to know.<eos> Everybody else does for fuck's sake!
Yeah, I guess.<eos> - I guess you hit that, huh?<eos> - Totally. I totally hit that.<eos> Cool. Do you still love her?<eos> I do.
You're still filming Sibel's wedding?<eos> -Yes, it's for my film studies.<eos> Except the hen night. She won't let me.<eos> Seriously?<eos> Just do it.
Why didn't I know she was coming?<eos> I forgot to tell you.<eos> Yeah, right.<eos> How can you forget something like that?<eos> I just did.

And when I went back to follow up on it the file said, "Report made in error."<eos> I never wrote that.<eos> So I marched it right into the Sheriff, Ted Childress.<eos> He's dead now.<eos> He did it.
What is it?<eos> I think something's back there.<eos> I think it's a way out.<eos> How do you know that?<eos> I don't.
I can't believe it.<eos> I felt abandoned.<eos> I finished the John Galt line to move your oil, and you disappeared on me.<eos> You quit when I needed you most.<eos> All of you did.
He was the first.<eos> So he destroyed his reputation and the family's copper mines for the strike?<eos> That's not all he gave up.<eos> You know that he and I were very close at one time.<eos> I do.
The waves that turn everyone into a psycho killer.<eos> But what he probably didn't tell anyone... is it can also super heat their soft tissue at his command.<eos> Valentine selected his chosen few to get the countdown warning... but he had to be sure they didn't blab to the wrong people beforehand.<eos> How does this help us right now?<eos> It doesn't.
Kill him!<eos> Gazelle!<eos> Come on! Come on!<eos> Kill him!<eos> Well done, son!
Gazelle!<eos> Come on! Come on!<eos> Kill him!<eos> Well done, son!<eos> Well done, Eggsy!
Vadim, every time you come, all you do is worry about the election.<eos> It's not for another year.<eos> In fair weather, prepare for foul.<eos> You do well to tend to worldly matters, but remember the divine.<eos> But I... Don't I already?
We can't end anybody's parole.<eos> Well, you can tell a judge that Darryl aided you in the apprehension of a federal fugitive.<eos> That coupled with his exemplary record as prisoner is evidence of his full rehabilitation.<eos> You really believe that?<eos> Yes. I do.
- No.<eos> I got him cuff links.<eos> - Silver, with his...<eos> - We don't talk about birthdays.<eos> - We don't do gifts.
We got a long drive tomorrow.<eos> You okay?<eos> This is all on me.<eos> She's going to jail, 'cause of me.<eos> You did 15 years for her.
I climbed the Wall with the wildlings.<eos> I--<eos> I laid with a wildling girl.<eos> You admit to breaking your vows, then?<eos> I do.
Right but the pseudo, I mean, you do have it...<eos> Oh, I've got it, partner... but here's the thing... if I tell you where it is now what's to stop you... just putting a bullet in me?<eos> Well, I can think of a long list of things, Russell... but number one would have to be the fact that...<eos> He doesn't have a gun.<eos> Well, you do now.
Oh, I've got it, partner... but here's the thing... if I tell you where it is now what's to stop you... just putting a bullet in me?<eos> Well, I can think of a long list of things, Russell... but number one would have to be the fact that...<eos> He doesn't have a gun.<eos> Well, you do now.<eos> You do now...
Damn fucking straight.<eos> That's why whenever I load my gun I always like to keep one chamber empty.<eos> Then I spin the wheel of fate...<eos> And I never know which one the empty chamber is.<eos> Nobody does.
Oh god, ok, ok, look... Milton, I...<eos> I'm begging you... just... I'm begging you.<eos> I know you're begging me Russell. I know you are.<eos> But here's the thing...<eos> So did they.
No but that first day, the day I cooked the meth.<eos> He knew something back then.<eos> He knew every single step of my filtration process.<eos> And nobody knows that.<eos> But he did.
I know he's been out there.<eos> I thought he's gotten over this.<eos> I-I think that... he's young, he's impressionable.<eos> Her death hit him very hard.<eos> He and Miss Watson-- I don't even--
Holy cow, that was close.<eos> You did it!<eos> You killed Herzog?<eos> I can't believe that that actually worked,<eos> Of course it did.
And I'm quite happy to see you sail off the edge of the world.<eos> But if you somehow achieve your aims and return, well, you'll owe me, won't you?<eos> Very well.<eos> I accept your offer.<eos> Of course you do!
Want me to plead insanity like I'm some kind of whacko.<eos> I ain't no whacko!<eos> I'm not stupid.<eos> Do you think I'm stupid?<eos> No. I don't.
He can't have forgotten how you tried to overthrow him.<eos> That whole incident was a tragic misunderstanding.<eos> You forget who you're talking to.<eos> I saw the orders with my own eyes.<eos> So you did.
Was this built before or after Copernicus?<eos> Before.<eos> So, they still believed everything revolved around the Earth.<eos> Which means the Earth didn't count as a planet. Right.<eos> But the Moon did. And so did the Sun.
Fever, rash... same as his friends.<eos> But he insisted.<eos> And he never came back.<eos> He disappeared.<eos> They all did.
Ouch!<eos> There.<eos> One more?<eos> - I don't have any more.<eos> - You don't?
Throw it away.<eos> Perfect, Chérif.<eos> Very good.<eos> Who wants to go next?<eos> - I do. - OK.
- You're trending, bro.<eos> - They're sending me messages.<eos> They're goading me into responding to this prick.<eos> - Don't do it.<eos> Don't do it, man.
"Why don't you come by again tonight? "I got a whole new menu just for you, asshole."<eos> - No, gimme the phone.<eos> - That's not good.<eos> Not a good idea.<eos> Don't do it!
No, Chef.<eos> That's my son.<eos> Get back in there. We got some hungry people.<eos> He's ready to cook!<eos> - We did good, man.
One second of every day.<eos> And then you cut 'em together and watch it.<eos> OK, enough with the virtual world.<eos> How about something real? Who wants to stop at Disney World?<eos> - Oh, yeah, I do.
Could I just... - Go fuck yourself?<eos> Yeah. What did you think it was gonna mean, working for me?<eos> - I just thought that maybe...<eos> - No, you didn't. You didn't think. You didn't have the guts to ask me either.<eos> Nobody does.
You have a right to have an attorney present during questioning.<eos> If you can't afford one, the court will appoint one for you.<eos> Sir.<eos> OK, I just wanted...<eos> He didn't do anything.
You okay?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Everything's okay.<eos> Keep talking.<eos> Well, back in the day, my mom did some work at WCIV.
Mary Jane Paul is the host of "Talkback" on SNC.<eos> Mary Jane. Mary Jane, this is Avery Daniels.<eos> She was a partner at Cornwall and Sullivan law firm and now she sits on our financial advisory board.<eos> I guess I do.<eos> Yes, I do.
He also wanted me to give you this.<eos> Let me handle this.<eos> Uh... go get him, tiger.<eos> - Hi. - I see you got my message.<eos> - I did.
- He's a Russian Jew.<eos> He's gonna tax us businessmen out of business.<eos> Maybe we ought to be taxed out of business, seeing as how it was our business that got this whole country in a mess in the first place.<eos> Really, Jonas, you act like you don't want to make money.<eos> I don't.
I know you see me standing here, Niecy.<eos> You know I was thinking about getting my tubes tied.<eos> I thought you were just talking.<eos> You were the one who said that having babies shouldn't be my biggest achievement in life.<eos> Yes, I did.
But they don't come back.<eos> It's not all right.<eos> You have to somehow move past them.<eos> You have to somehow convince yourself that you don't need those people.<eos> Because you don't.
We used to... we used to sleep in your bed together.<eos> You know?<eos> Remember?<eos> I don't like it like this.<eos> Of course you don't.
- That guy you told about me? - Uh-huh? He's a serious guy, huh?<eos> - You wanna know what he did, Carl? - No.<eos> No, I don't.<eos> He burned my family alive.<eos> Oh, I didn't...
Ain't no debate.<eos> I just know not to trust a word that comes out of a cop's mouth.<eos> We're trying to save someone's life.<eos> You all worried about my boy?<eos> Don't.
Ay, ay... You always had a certain audacity about you, you know.<eos> I can say you're still very much the John Wick of old.<eos> Am I?<eos> People don't change. You know that.<eos> Times, they do.
You get a gender exemption?<eos> Yeah, dulled male only.<eos> You mind if I just double-check that permit?<eos> You know what the odds are for landing a bighorn license?<eos> I sure do.
I don't care.<eos> Now promise.<eos> What if a man is walking on the side of the road, and it's really hot and he drops a penny, and it gets stuck on the melting road, and his hand gets stuck and a truck is coming?<eos> That's never happening.<eos> But what if it did?
If you're gonna kill someone, it's probably best not to announce it.<eos> You're not really a member of the guard, are you?<eos> No, the real guard will be here soon, unless we stop it.<eos> You don't actually think they're gonna forgive your crimes?<eos> Even if they do, then what?
But some enterprising guards have made a good amount of cash selling our spice's magic remedy to... gullible humans outside the Sector.<eos> It was worth a shot.<eos> Do you... have a sick friend?<eos> Um, I don't.<eos> She does.
Where are you?<eos> I'm right in front of charing cross station.<eos> You missed her?<eos> How?<eos> I just did, okay?
Listen to me.<eos> This is very simple.<eos> What I asked Simone to do with this man yates is disgusting to you.<eos> But you're wrong to blame her.<eos> Or me. Don't.
reinventing myself, I suppose, within the business that I'm in, you know, and it was...<eos> I can't reinvent myself.<eos> - Do you want to?<eos> - No.<eos> I don't...
and he goes, "Oh, I saw him last week in the South of France"<eos> "and the T-shirt seller did most of the set<eos> "and The Killer just sat on the side and came out...<eos> - Oh, really?<eos> - "and did Great Balls Of Fire
Your plants need light, Patrick. They're dying-<eos> The crazy thing is, they're fake. They are?<eos> Maybe they're fake dead plants.<eos> - Do you like dead plants?<eos> - No. Maybe some people do.
I'm gonna go take a piss.<eos> Yo, Frankie.<eos> Yeah?<eos> You ever wonder what life would be like if... if you never pulled the trigger on that cop 10 years ago?<eos> But I did, Jimmy.
Yo, Frankie.<eos> Yeah?<eos> You ever wonder what life would be like if... if you never pulled the trigger on that cop 10 years ago?<eos> But I did, Jimmy.<eos> But I did.
Are you gonna arrest me or what?<eos> No, I'm not gonna arrest you.<eos> Then stop following me.<eos> Why did you say that you didn't recognize Ellie Ford?<eos> - Because I didn't.
No, I'm not gonna arrest you.<eos> Then stop following me.<eos> Why did you say that you didn't recognize Ellie Ford?<eos> - Because I didn't.<eos> - Yeah, you did.
He told me... that you were Jenny Glick's daughter.<eos> Do you have any idea... how special that makes you?<eos> He speaks to me, June...<eos> Judas.<eos> No, he doesn't, Daniel.
He speaks to me, June...<eos> Judas.<eos> No, he doesn't, Daniel.<eos> He's dead!<eos> Oh, he does.
That would mean it's our anniversary.<eos> Oh, my God, it's our anniversary.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Well, we need to celebrate.<eos> Yes, we do.
Especially for grabbing you by the back of your head like that.<eos> But that was just reflex.<eos> It's fine.<eos> When I was curled up in a ball on the floor trying to forget the look on our pediatrician's face,<eos> I, uh... I did a lot of thinking.
I think I was wrong to ask you to stick around.<eos> After everything that's happened, everything you went through,<eos> I should have thought about that.<eos> I'm sorry, but you don't belong here anymore.<eos> I never did.
You sound like my father.<eos> I think that was an insult.<eos> You see, my father believed that the law spoke for all men, even a black janitor.<eos> You just have to have faith in the system.<eos> And he did.
Okay, you said he was going swimming?<eos> It's not always about race, pal.<eos> You seen many swimming pools in this neighborhood?<eos> Does Kenny know how to swim?<eos> No, he doesn't.
I used to think that I failed because of my team.<eos> -I didn't have the right chief of staff, campaign manager, comms guys, my then wife, but, no.<eos> It was me.<eos> I just didn't have it.<eos> - Well, very few of us do.
Yeah.<eos> What is it?<eos> Did you have to turn him against me?<eos> I didn't.<eos> You did.
- That may be.<eos> "May"?<eos> It doesn't matter.<eos> It does matter. It matters that you know we didn't do this.<eos> I do.
"May"?<eos> It doesn't matter.<eos> It does matter. It matters that you know we didn't do this.<eos> I do.<eos> I do.
Um...<eos> But you have to understand.<eos> I didn't have all the love and support that Ben has.<eos> I didn't have an incredible, selfless mother who would do anything for me.<eos> Well, who does really?
- I know.<eos> - I don't remember the other night.<eos> You know that, right?<eos> I'm not saying that makes it OK.<eos> - It doesn't.
- I don't care.<eos> Did you forget something? - I gave it to you. I gave you the money.<eos> - Address?<eos> - Right. OK, and how do I, uh, contact you?<eos> - You don't.
Yes, or we'll get in a mess.<eos> Weren't you with my father?<eos> Yes, but... I think he suspects something.<eos> He says it doesn't seem you've been together three years.<eos> - He did?
I don't know how to say this, really.<eos> Um...<eos> Say what?<eos> You know that I care about you a lot, right?<eos> Yeah, of course I do.
Yeah.<eos> I mean, sometimes I imagine her wet and scared in a cardboard box by some train tracks.<eos> And, other times I see her in a penthouse, dripping diamonds and laughing at us.<eos> But... we don't know which one's the truth.<eos> None of us do.
That's why I'm glad that you're out of there.<eos> Hanna, I might have to go back.<eos> What do you mean, "might"?<eos> I have to go back.<eos> No, you don't.
And we can't get away from her.<eos> And I'm so tired of being Sara's friend.<eos> Just... sucks the life out of you.<eos> I understand how you feel.<eos> No, you don't.
There's nothing I can do about it.<eos> You're still the chief of police.<eos> You've never left me out there, not for one day.<eos> You know you have to do this.<eos> No, I don't.
Oh, I forgot.<eos> Do you have a cell phone?<eos> No.<eos> Yes, I do!<eos> No, I don't.
Use me as a reference.<eos> You're a postdoctoral scientist at Tristana Pharmaceuticals.<eos> - Yup.<eos> - So you already knew...<eos> Oh, that cancery stuff, yeah, I did.
She's completely age-appropriate.<eos> Why' you jealous?<eos> Fuckin'<eos> -A, I'm jealous. You see that body?<eos> No, of course you did.
Wait, wha...<eos> Dad, don't you want to build it with me?<eos> Well, there's no dad on the box.<eos> I don't want to get in trouble.<eos> Of course I do!
- If you want, you can come with.<eos> - I not coming!<eos> - I never want to see you again.<eos> - You can't mean that.<eos> Yes, I do.
So, what do you need me to do?<eos> Get any information you can on this guy.<eos> Do you really think David killed Craig and that other guy?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I do.
What's your point, pound cake?<eos> I'm hoping we can find a way to coexist.<eos> - What did he say?<eos> - He wants to see if ghosts exist.<eos> Ooh, they do.
Oh! Fuck off!<eos> If I had tits like that, it would not have taken me till I was 18 to get some dick.<eos> Shelby, did you bring my black shoes?<eos> I don't have them.<eos> Yes, you do.
- Lucas Goodwin.<eos> - From the Herald?<eos> He must have been working with Zoe.<eos> - How much does he know?<eos> - No more than she did.
Killing redskins more your line?<eos> You know nothing about it.<eos> Whole Indian nations pacified into nonexistence, what don't I know?<eos> How do you know I was in the Indian wars?<eos> I didn't.
- First, tell me what we're doing here.<eos> - We're going to explore a plague ship.<eos> Come this way.<eos> You asked me once if Sir Malcolm knew what he was seeking.<eos> He does not.
Harmless, of course.<eos> Something any girl would do.<eos> I told myself it was no more than mischief.<eos> But I knew it was more.<eos> Of course I did.
What happened?<eos> He died.<eos> They all died.<eos> Did he find God?<eos> No one did.
But you do.<eos> When the moment comes, look into my eyes, and pull the trigger.<eos> And send you to heaven?<eos> If you believe in that.<eos> Oh, I do.
So you can imagine the kind of politics that we...<eos> Listen, Case.<eos> The guys in D.C. cried wolf about this African yellowcake once before.<eos> We both know how that turned out.<eos> Yes, I do.
I haven't thanked you yet. For what?<eos> Your excellent work in picking a vacation spot.<eos> Come on, man.<eos> You know I was born to roll like this.<eos> Yes, I do.
You know what it looks like?<eos> It looks like you got herpes.<eos> Hey, no.<eos> Oh, shit!<eos> It kind of does.
It was saying that Harry Potter, it has seven book, you know?<eos> You guys only have six book.<eos> Huh? I don't know what to tell you...<eos> I... You know how long I'm asking for this book?<eos> No, you don't.
And do you know why?<eos> I'm here because my commanding officer told me to come here.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> The review board will have, uh, a hearing for both of you next month.<eos> - I didn't do...
- Until I can stop.<eos> - You prefer prison?<eos> I've given you eight child pornographers, three botnet masters. But you still haven't given us AVunit.<eos> I told Carter I don't know where he is.<eos> - Yes, you do.
What the fuck is this now?<eos> I'm sorry to interrupt.<eos> I'm Julia, Levon's mom.<eos> Levon has something he'd like to say to you.<eos> Do it.
- It's an acting appointment. - Mm.<eos> - You didn't answer my question.<eos> - An audition.<eos> Rath said that there was a small part that I might be good for.<eos> Oh, Rath did, did he?
I'll make some calls.<eos> Well, the only reason you'd be calling me is if there's an Emma problem.<eos> So what's the problem?<eos> I threw her out, Harris.<eos> You did what?
'Cause you're pretty cute when you're angry.<eos> Oh. All right.<eos> Okay, then.<eos> Hey, you like barbecue?<eos> Who doesn't?
- I hit him!<eos> You see, you understand nothing.<eos> You will never understand!<eos> I thought I was doing the right thing. Yes.<eos> Yes, you and your sons and your armies, all doing the right thing!
And I'm gonna get it.<eos> Devon, we struck oil!<eos> Son of a bitch, it's oil!<eos> You're acting like you don't want to make money.<eos> I don't.
And that you drove during the accident<eos> I will place the best lawyer that will get you out of jail as quickly as possible<eos> With good conduct you're out in less than year and a half<eos> -Does it work that way?<eos> -It does
What's up?<eos> You couldn't sleep?<eos> What about Dad?<eos> I don't know if he'll be back home.<eos> I don't, Théo.
Maybe we won't go into next semester being the same lame losers we are now.<eos> I don't have to jump off a bus to prove I'm fun.<eos> I'm fun.<eos> I know that.<eos> Just... no one else really does.
- A what?<eos> - A pee pad.<eos> Two maxis stacked so they like a maxi-maxi.<eos> And then you just let out a little at a time.<eos> Now, some people do two down and then one across the front, one across the back like a diaper, but me, I just do a double stack.
Left hand, please.<eos> Raise your right.<eos> Do you solemnly swear that you will tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth,<eos> - so help you God?<eos> - I do.
Are you and mom going to get a divorce?<eos> How can we get divorced?<eos> We're not even married.<eos> You know what I mean.<eos> I do.
I'm a blasphemous mess.<eos> If there's a top ten most unwanted list up there, I... I could very well be on it.<eos> Maybe so.<eos> But right now you just seem like a man who loves his wife.<eos> I do.
If there's a top ten most unwanted list up there, I... I could very well be on it.<eos> Maybe so.<eos> But right now you just seem like a man who loves his wife.<eos> I do.<eos> I really do.
I think that's what makes me pop so fast.<eos> You see, this is why we don't go out, because every time we do, Charlie says something that makes me throw up in my mouth.<eos> She started it.<eos> Hey, well, try living with that shit try living with that shit.<eos> I didn't.
Squeeze.<eos> Keep squeezing.<eos> Keep squeezing, fuck.<eos> - l'm squeezing. - Until he comes back.<eos> When he does...
Honestly, it's an honour for me to be here and meet you.<eos> - l'm starving.<eos> - l have toothpaste.<eos> - Doesn't work.<eos> - lt does too.
I'm tired.<eos> That's why we want you to see a doctor.<eos> Would you stop bringing that up?<eos> You know why I don't want to see one.<eos> No, we don't.
It's 20 degrees out there and the kids are in sandals.<eos> Lowering overhead is not a bad idea.<eos> Is that where you'd start, keeping in mind "the four Ps"?<eos> Do you have an MBA?<eos> No, but their head of marketing does.
My name is Burton Guster.<eos> Hello.<eos> Do you by chance know where the parking ticket payment window is?<eos> You poor thing.<eos> Yeah, I do, actually.
Using the technician's green screen suit, you knew you'd remain undetected.<eos> You waited for them to drop out of frame--<eos> And you knocked that poor girl out cold and stabbed you some Jackson Hale.<eos> Then you noticed it wasn't Connie at all, it was my client Sandra Panitch, an innocent girl who walked into a deadly love triangle.<eos> I did, I did.
Shosh?<eos> Ray's third worst scenario in life... thank you...<eos> Is a road trip with a spontaneous detour.<eos> Who has a third worst anything?<eos> - Who doesn't?
Ray's third worst scenario in life... thank you...<eos> Is a road trip with a spontaneous detour.<eos> Who has a third worst anything?<eos> - Who doesn't?<eos> - I don't.
- But if you did have some arnica for these bruises on my thigh, that would be so helpful.<eos> Did you run into something, or is that more of, like, an abuse scenario?<eos> 'Cause those are really...<eos> You know, I don't know what to call a provoked physical attack by someone you love.<eos> - I really don't.
I've seen Ken Burns' jazz documentary about 17 times.<eos> - Does that count?<eos> Absolutely not.<eos> No way.<eos> No, it doesn't.
The Stein Foundation has to stay intact.<eos> It cannot be compromised.<eos> It already is.<eos> The Israelis will know.<eos> Hamas probably already does.
Given what's happened, I have to suggest the possibility that our most likely point of first contact will be when Kasim's kidnappers choose to make it with us.<eos> So the long arm of the law has just come up short.<eos> Is that what you're telling us?<eos> And how do you expect us to react to that?<eos> He doesn't.
Then, yes, you are.<eos> I can change.<eos> Would that involve black denim?<eos> - It could if you wanted it to.<eos> - I don't.
I spent 15 years searching for my daughter.<eos> And now she hunts me.<eos> Tell me, Yulish.<eos> Do you really believe in God?<eos> I do, yes.
I don't trust you.<eos> I don't give a shit.<eos> And instead of wishing for God... I am praying...<eos> That He does not exist.<eos> Because if He does... Dead or alive...
Wade.<eos> Holly's boy?<eos> You have a crush on Holly's boy?<eos> - No, not a crush exactly.<eos> - Yes, you do.
I asked Him for guidance.<eos> I strained to listen.<eos> And He told me,<eos> "Morning is coming."<eos> Yes, He did.
My king.<eos> He would have been your nightmare.<eos> Your Grace, I feel...<eos> You knew exactly what he was.<eos> I did, too.
A tremendous amount.<eos> There must be someone at the Iron Bank you can speak to, come to some arrangement.<eos> The Iron Bank is the Iron Bank.<eos> There is no someone.<eos> Someone does work there.
He didn't listen and neither did you.<eos> Which is why you've abandoned your watch atop the Wall to come here and read about the terrible things that may have happened to the girl you love.<eos> I don't love her.<eos> - Yes, you do.<eos> - No. Yes, you do.
I'm sorry, Maester.<eos> I didn't mean it like that.<eos> Do you know who I was before I came here?<eos> What I could have been if I'd only said the word?<eos> Of course you do.
That sounds dangerous.<eos> - How do you make people fly?<eos> - We don't.<eos> What do you do with all the bad people and the scary people and the people you don't like?<eos> I never did anything with them at all.
- I'll pay to have it fixed.<eos> - You pay nothing.<eos> The school has insurance.<eos> But the $500 deductible, who pays that?<eos> I do.
Yeah, dogs eat in the kitchen.<eos> Y-You know, you're eating mostly horse hooves and tallow, right?<eos> You cool with that?<eos> Oh, and the ones that fall on the floor, you just eat those up, too, huh?<eos> Oh, yeah, yeah, you do.
That's a custom tint.<eos> And I cut the ignition there, Leno, so don't think about running off. I'll have you know that I cannot make a damage claim this early into my new job.<eos> You tell me where the gun is, I'll let you live another 30 seconds.<eos> Come on, man, you don't wanna keep killing dudes.<eos> Yeah, I do.
Can we make a u-turn?<eos> We're also running out of gas.<eos> All right, Gus, if this is it, I really need you to know something.<eos> - I know, Shawn.<eos> - You do?
We're also running out of gas.<eos> All right, Gus, if this is it, I really need you to know something.<eos> - I know, Shawn.<eos> - You do?<eos> Yes, I do.
Yes, I would like that very much.<eos> I have a confession to make.<eos> I actually did have gum, but it was my last piece.<eos> So you lied to me.<eos> Yeah, I... did.
You're talking to a friend.<eos> Today Michele told me I'm not his mother. - Why ?<eos> - Because it's true.<eos> - I didn't know.<eos> - No one did.
I can't keep you.<eos> I can't pay you.<eos> I made a mistake.<eos> You pull out.<eos> You always do.
It's everything and everyone else around her.<eos> I understand running away.<eos> But to let your friends and family think You're dead?<eos> I really thought It was alison in that grave.<eos> We all did.
He's told us everything.<eos> Were photos taken in your house too?<eos> I can understand it isn't easy.<eos> I hope it happens to you one day.<eos> I really do.
- Bye.<eos> Classic.<eos> All right.<eos> So we serve about 300 people a day.<eos> We do pre-natal care, eye exams, dental services, wellness center.
Or you could go get in your car and drive away.<eos> Now, why would I do that?<eos> Because some roads you shouldn't go down.<eos> Because maps used to say, "there be dragons here."<eos> Now they don't.
Do you have a pencil?<eos> Thank you very much.<eos> You see that?<eos> It's amazing.<eos> They did it in The Big Lebowski.
Pinkie Pie: WOW!<eos> Oh.<eos> You um, you didn't hear me, um ...<eos> Singing in the most beautiful voice ever?<eos> Uh, yeah we did!
♪ Is this some kinda joke?<eos> Why, Rarity, what ever would make you think I was joking?<eos> Because you would never wear an ensemble like that!<eos> You like plowing fields and hauling apples... And I can like fashion just as much.<eos> But you don't!
I'll be back with a freshly painted one in no time!<eos> We were using that!<eos> And it's not like anypony else has color-coordinated horseshoes or anything!<eos> (sigh) I guess someponies do!<eos> Someponies do what?
Slowly, gently. All right?<eos> Good girl, good girl!<eos> The head's delivered, Doris!<eos> I want my baby.<eos> Doing wonderfully, Doris.
So you could try and change my mind?<eos> You're my brother.<eos> And this is my country!<eos> Everybody has a choice, George.<eos> Yes, they do.
Of course, M'Lord!<eos> Thank you.<eos> That's all I need to know.<eos> You don't HAVE to go.<eos> Yes, I do.
Felt?<eos> Yes, to line military coats.<eos> I need a great deal of it - and quickly.<eos> I trust you have suppliers.<eos> I do.
I look terrible.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> What is it that they think you've done?<eos> They believe I have a link to Germany.<eos> And do you?
How do you want to do this?<eos> - I'll go...<eos> - We split up.<eos> We split up, meet back here if we find nothing.<eos> Signal if we do.
Absolutely not!<eos> Did you see your father's face, dead on that sofa?<eos> Did you see his face?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, I did.
The case will go on.<eos> And Miss Borden will be tried in the matter of which she was accused.<eos> The prosecution calls Miss Bridget Sullivan.<eos> Do you swear to tell the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help you God?<eos> I do.
Herschel was the first person ever to see into the deeper waters of the cosmic ocean.<eos> There he glimpsed the magic trick that light does with time.<eos> Father... do you believe in ghosts?<eos> Why, yes, my son!<eos> You, you do?
With all due respect, Father, surely your friend was mistaken.<eos> If no one can see them, then how can we possibly know they exist?<eos> Did you see the man who left those footprints, John?<eos> Why, no, Father.<eos> I did not.
- Mr. Murphy!<eos> I need to you to calm down.<eos> My son is missing.<eos> You know what that's like?<eos> No, I don't.
It's true.<eos> Back then I was against it.<eos> And now?<eos> Does she still dance?<eos> Yes, she does.
Sorry, never saw him before.<eos> - Are you sure?<eos> - Detective, I have said, I don't remember anything from that day.<eos> Do you understand whay "anything" means?<eos> I do.
No.<eos> Why do you get bored when there are people?<eos> I'm not bored, I'm looking.<eos> - Why don't you talk to people?<eos> - I do.
I hope you get your money.<eos> You've been waiting a long time.<eos> Forget it.<eos> I didn't mean what I said about Dad.<eos> Yes, you did.
Alice, I'm from the same world as you.<eos> I know it's hard to accept that people think we're important.<eos> But if you do, you'll be strong.<eos> Did Agnès ask you?<eos> No, she didn't.
Give him a break.<eos> He just wanted to see the baby.<eos> Really?<eos> Well, I don't see the baby.<eos> Do you, Frankie?
You put your family through hell, and I for one would like to know why.<eos> You were a good Dad.<eos> We were a-a good family.<eos> We had good times, right?<eos> Yes, we did.
Ali is alive.<eos> Who told you that?<eos> Never mind.<eos> She's alive and you know how to find her.<eos> No, I don't.
What are you wearing?<eos> It's nothing, I...<eos> I had to change.<eos> And this is all I had in my gym locker.<eos> Did you?
I just want to get off.<eos> Aria, please, just listen to me.<eos> Nothing you say will change anything.<eos> I don't even know who you are.<eos> Yes, you do.
Aria, please, just listen to me.<eos> Nothing you say will change anything.<eos> I don't even know who you are.<eos> Yes, you do.<eos> Yes, you do.
Why did Toni get that job, and not you?<eos> - They offered it.<eos> I refused.<eos> - You refused?<eos> - Yes, I did.
And, when I got up... he was just starin' at the sky.<eos> His neck was turnin' purple.<eos> So, I ran home and told my dad.<eos> I took him out to show him... and he takes a look... and tells me to go home.<eos> So, I do.
I thought that Jean was with Kopus last night.<eos> No, she was at a friend's house.<eos> She don't know where Brian is, either.<eos> You sure you don't know where he is?<eos> No, I don't.
It's just a nickname.<eos> Yeah, I have one for you, too...<eos> Tessa... dactyl.<eos> I texted you after school to see if you wanted to get a yogurt, and you said you had plans?<eos> And I do, with Junebug.
All her clothes were gone.<eos> May I see.<eos> Carl?<eos> Sunday.<eos> Well done, Henning.
- What if they find her?<eos> - She has dug herself into a hole.<eos> Finally she disappeared altogether.<eos> - What if they find her?<eos> - Then we do it.
Oh, uh... no. I'm sorry.<eos> I have to get this done before sundown.<eos> Adrian is convinced the gunmen will come back, so he's decided to change every lock in our house.<eos> You know how to change locks?<eos> No, he does not.
Alejandro can treat me like the help.<eos> I don't care.<eos> But you...<eos> I thought I mattered to you.<eos> Of course you do.
If it wasn't for your speech, the integration program and your father's work would've gone down the drain.<eos> You wouldn't have given up on integration, though.<eos> No.<eos> But I'm only interested in programs that work.<eos> Thanks to you, this one still does.
I sent him.<eos> And the truth is I don't know if he is alive or dead.<eos> But I still have hope.<eos> How does the Chancellor vote?<eos> I don't.
That's a weird one. That's a weird one for me.<eos> I'm sorry, guys. It doesn't take a psychiatrist to correlate Adam's romantic interest in you with a repressed fantasy toward me.<eos> - I don't want to fuck my sister.<eos> - No one is saying you do.<eos> Caroline just did.
They're gorgeous.<eos> Who'd you say your client is?<eos> I didn't.<eos> I was just wondering if maybe I knew him.<eos> You don't.
I thought I knew every angel in heaven, but I've never seen you.<eos> Why would I tell you anything?<eos> Well, I don't give a damn who you are.<eos> You need to get out -- now!<eos> And if I don't?
You've seen everything that he's seen, even if you can't remember.<eos> That's what I need you to do.<eos> I need you to remember.<eos> Did I kill Kevin?<eos> No, you didn't.
How'd your friend get rolled up in this?<eos> She and Jasper had a thing going on the side. Selling.<eos> Yeah, I heard about that.<eos> All right, I know Jasper.<eos> Everyone does.
Yes.<eos> I should have guessed with all the trips to the city.<eos> She's been talking to you about Gino.<eos> You know about him?<eos> I do now.
Okay. It's nice.<eos> It is nice, I told you.<eos> Does she supply her own eggs?<eos> I mean, I don't want to go, but I want to know if she supplies her own eggs.<eos> Oh my God. Does she?
You want me to fuck you?<eos> Yeah. - Okay. - But not today.<eos> Oh. I feel like maybe I opened up enough today.<eos> If you know what I mean.<eos> But I do.
I always do.<eos> You answer to me. I'm SVP of sales, so you're dog shit around here until you close a deal.<eos> - Do you understand?<eos> - I do.<eos> All right: "Do." Good.
Why are you doing this?<eos> "This puts the future squarely in the hands of those who know computers not for what they are, but for everything they have the potential to be."<eos> What?<eos> You know who said that?<eos> No, no, I don't.
Uh, Cardiff finds out, then both of us would be on the street.<eos> Apple, IBM, they have the market sewn up.<eos> Plus, you got Commodore, Tandy, Texas Instruments.<eos> I'm sorry, but you missed it.<eos> We all did.
It was a majority decision.<eos> The committee decided.<eos> I hope you and your bloody committee can guarantee their safety, Sian.<eos> I do.<eos> I really do.
No proof.<eos> And I will not be leaving this desk until you do.<eos> We've got all day, so chop—chop.<eos> - Nobody said anything about hiding who we are.<eos> - Yes, they did.
- So now Cliff will speak on behalf of the LGSM.<eos> Floor's yours, Cliff.<eos> Well, what I want to say abo--<eos> About the gays and lesbians-<eos> Why don't you do us a poem, Cliff?
Wait, don't hang up.<eos> I'm working.<eos> - Don't get pissed.<eos> - Then you don't understand?<eos> No, you don't.
Wow, so, you're telling me it's not even an elective.<eos> Correct.<eos> It's a class required for graduation.<eos> Uh, but how does senior tanning enrich students academically?<eos> It doesn't.
No.<eos> But I'm clocking two of your pavement artists right now.<eos> You've had me in a floating box since I left Angel's Bluff.<eos> Weatherly didn't know.<eos> The president still doesn't.
♪ Boy uh, I'll go get some beers.<eos> I don't wanna ruin what is clearly going well for you with cute and nice over there, but I thought that flock of seagulls boy with the grouchy attitude was more your speed.<eos> He is. Scott's a friend.<eos> Oh, your boy didn't show, huh?<eos> No, he did.
If my girlfriend finds out, she'll totally dump me.<eos> You have a girlfriend?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I thought you knew.<eos> I did not.
It did until you showed up.<eos> Look, I've been thinking about you a lot.<eos> I was hoping to find you.<eos> I don't know where you live.<eos> Very few people do.
But with you, it's... it's more.<eos> It's like I crave you.<eos> I keep searching for this biological explanation, but there's none.<eos> I don't know what to do.<eos> I do.
Why? No.<eos> - I'm so sorry.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> I didn't mean to scare you.<eos> I... I didn't.
- What are you talking about?<eos> - You forgot to batter the bread.<eos> - No, I didn't.<eos> It...<eos> - Yes, you did.
Take it out, please.<eos> Take it out.<eos> Don't stop.<eos> Don't stop.<eos> Don't...
Fuck you!<eos> So what do you want to know?<eos> What do you want to tell me?<eos> What's important in your life right now?<eos> I don't...
Why can't we do that?<eos> Together?<eos> I honestly don't know whether to wish you luck or not.<eos> - Oh, come on.<eos> - I don't.
You know, I was gonna leave that cell on my 18th birthday, get sick and die in my own piss and vomit.<eos> Look at me!<eos> I don't have any memories of touching my dad's hand, or what my mom smells like.<eos> You told me that a relationship between a vampire and his maker was special.<eos> - Yes, I did!
You're not just killing them.<eos> You're wiping them from existence, and all because they drink blood.<eos> Now, I saw the way that you fought, and there is no way you could've pulled that off without drinking.<eos> You're right.<eos> I do!
Now you're gonna do the same with this lil' smokie girl!<eos> Nobody knows I messed up more than I do.<eos> I've had a lot of time and multiple dimensions to think about my guilt.<eos> Do you think I like coming here and being scorned by you?<eos> I really don't.
You're welcome!<eos> You shouldn't have done that!<eos> I couldn't stand here and watch them talk to you like that!<eos> I deserve this.<eos> I really do.
or I get to be alone or I get to live a lie.<eos> Those are my choices, right?<eos> What, you don't want me to compel you? Hmm?<eos> I will do it!<eos> No, I don't.
You came in here practically glowing.<eos> Live blood, I can smell it on you.<eos> Who was it?<eos> Did you kill her?<eos> Of course you did.
- Sally, I'm sorry.<eos> - Stop apologizing.<eos> Let me finish.<eos> You don't know what this curse is yet.<eos> You don't.
You weren't answering your phone.<eos> I was worried you might have been bitten.<eos> Oh.<eos> Zombies not able to control selves.<eos> All we do bite, bite, bite.
Well, then why would you wish that on me?<eos> Don't ask me to do that to Kenny.<eos> You're asking me to look the other way while people die.<eos> I didn't know what he was up to.<eos> I really didn't.
Yes... we will.<eos> Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm gonna share this primo origin ish with my bride.<eos> Even the mintiest comic is just acidifying pulp, if you have no one to read it with, right?<eos> Nerds don't get girls.<eos> These days they do, man.
I love art!<eos> Art?<eos> What do you know about art?<eos> You don't even know who painted that picture.<eos> Yes, I do.
Right here, right now, cut the crap.<eos> Do either of you actually know what Thinman is?<eos> No. We just play supernaturalists on tv.<eos> We have no idea what we're doing.<eos> Of course we do.
Why don't we just leave that here?<eos> We talked about this, and we decided that --<eos> No.<eos> In all fairness, we didn't decide.<eos> You did.
He does seem angry.<eos> I mean, he's always a little angry, but now it seems like...<eos> More.<eos> I think a part of him actually believed that I ordered those angels to, you know...<eos> Sam, you don't, do you?
Without her, we ain't got jack.<eos> Yeah, you think I don't know that?<eos> You think I wanted that to happen?<eos> I don't know, Dean.<eos> Did you?
- See you later.<eos> - You couldn't take any more, huh?<eos> Shut up and blow me<eos> Dad looks great, Ciro.<eos> Even in maximum security, double or triple maximum security... he always does great
Mom's not in there, nothing's in there,<eos> Mom's gone.<eos> Do you believe in God?<eos> The God who sees all, knows all.<eos> I do.
All right, guys. Here you go.<eos> Will wants his jacket back.<eos> What?<eos> Bobby, what are you...<eos> I don't...
Bobby, what are you...<eos> I don't...<eos> I...<eos> I'm not in...<eos> I don't e...
No, no.<eos> Not as a gift. No.<eos> As a reminder of how hard it can be to put something back together again once it's been crushed.<eos> If you're going to threaten me, you don't have to go to the trouble of veiling it.<eos> I don't usually do interviews with reporters.
Wondering why do I remember?<eos> I do not have a car.<eos> He made me an errand to me.<eos> Barry? , Got me what I asked for?<eos> Yes, yes, I did.
Mommy... I want Mommy.<eos> I want Mommy...<eos> You'll see your mother again.<eos> I really believe that.<eos> After today, I do, too.
If she did anything wrong, it was my fault.<eos> I should have been more understanding.<eos> I didn't know that.<eos> Did you know that Agent Bellamy has gone over my head and gotten a federal court order to open the tomb?<eos> I did.
Yeah, just make sure that we have the north side of Montgomery covered.<eos> I thought you had cars posted outside.<eos> We had all cars to the robbery.<eos> How the hell did he get away so fast?<eos> Maybe he didn't.
And that piece of crap doesn't even come close.<eos> You're a liar.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> You said you didn't know how to write lyrics.<eos> I don't.
I went through this phase, thought I wanted to know where I came from.<eos> So I hired a private detective.<eos> He tracked you down.<eos> But when I came here and asked to meet you, your father told me you didn't want anything to do with me.<eos> He did what?
Gonna drink tea and write in my therapy journal.<eos> Why don't you call some friends and have them come over?<eos> My uncle wouldn't like that. No!<eos> He wants you to have a good time.<eos> We both do.
We were in Chicago together. - On a book tour?<eos> - Good guess.<eos> And one thing led to another and...<eos> [Chuckling] You know how it goes.<eos> I do. [Chuckles]
- Good guess.<eos> And one thing led to another and...<eos> [Chuckling] You know how it goes.<eos> I do. [Chuckles]<eos> I really do.
She refuses to step into this house until you're gone.<eos> That's how much you've upset her.<eos> You're lying.<eos> Carmen loves me.<eos> No, she doesn't.
I gave up food in the '80s.<eos> I see no reason why I can't give up fluids, as well.<eos> Give me Henri's number.<eos> I just promised mom I wouldn't call him.<eos> Yeah, but I didn't.
All right.<eos> If you really think of me as your mother...<eos> And I'm not sure how I feel about that.<eos> But if you mean that...<eos> I do.
What if it doesn't come true?<eos> What?<eos> Well, lots of people have dreams that don't work out, Or they get their dream and then it goes wrong.<eos> That's not gonna happen to me.<eos> But what if it does?
That smells good.<eos> If you invite him to eat with us, I'll kill you.<eos> - We have to talk.<eos> - No, we don't.<eos> We really, really do.
He doesn't remember much, which isn't surprising.<eos> I wish I could be more helpful.<eos> This is a big property.<eos> Do you have security cameras?<eos> We do.
Did she have something on him?<eos> I'm not sure what it was, but yeah.<eos> She had something.<eos> Of course, mom couldn't really tell anyone because Nick saw her push Dahlia off the bridge.<eos> We both did.
You're rich. You can buy anything. Give gifts.<eos> But be careful. Why?<eos> You must be wary.<eos> When you have money, people love you.<eos> People already do.
Is she pregnant?<eos> I know a doc.<eos> You gonna help or just commentate?<eos> You spent the night with her?<eos> Yes, he did.
How many hours do you have?<eos> It's complicated, but I'm trying to stay away from guy drama and focus on school.<eos> Speaking of which, have you seen the college apps?<eos> I don't know where to start.<eos> I do.
Lissa doesn't even want to be cheer captain.<eos> Well, if I'm called to serve, I guess I'd have no choice.<eos> Jenna, the equipment girl, may I have your ballot, please?<eos> - I get a vote?<eos> - No, you don't.
We're both sorry.<eos> And he's an 11-year-old boy.<eos> Polio or no polio, he needs to spread his wings.<eos> I don't know what I'm going to do with myself.<eos> I do.
How are they forcing them out? Money.<eos> I mean, they buy them out or they raise the rent.<eos> How much do you think I'd get for a place like this?<eos> That doesn't matter.<eos> It does to me.
This is the building.<eos> Once he's gone, they can sell the whole block.<eos> It's worth a fortune. Wow.<eos> You really think you can stop them?<eos> Of course, I do.
Oh, and by the way.<eos> Oh, no.<eos> Sir, can you step over here, please?<eos> Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.<eos> I didn't do...
There have to be consequences.<eos> We can't just let them hang people.<eos> Hopefully, we figure it out before Murphy kills us for helping her.<eos> He's not the forgive and forget type.<eos> - How did you...
I never got to take care of you, you know?<eos> Let me take care of you now, please.<eos> Okay, here we go.<eos> You think Gustavo wants to help us get out of here?<eos> I do, too.
Filthy Roman scum!<eos> Just give it back!<eos> Jerusalem needs water.<eos> You think your god brings it?<eos> No, he does not.
Just give it back!<eos> Jerusalem needs water.<eos> You think your god brings it?<eos> No, he does not.<eos> Rome does.
Trust me.<eos> That's how the universe works.<eos> Karen: So, you knew Jacob liked me?<eos> Of course.<eos> We all did.
You had months to take me back, but you couldn't make up your mind.<eos> You were in.<eos> You were out.<eos> And then you just totally disappeared.<eos> I didn't...
Why not?<eos> Seriously?<eos> Harry, I got a camel...<eos> A real, live, leaf-eating, cud-chewing camel.<eos> I did lanterns instead.
Dr. Bickman.<eos> Can I help you?<eos> You know, I can't stop thinking about last time.<eos> Well, it was a mistake. It will never happen again.<eos> - It just did. - No. No!
- You're engaged to a cook.<eos> - His name is Will.<eos> - I don't care.<eos> If you are serious about this man and you feel nothing for me, why do you want me to touch you again?<eos> - I don't.
- His name is Will.<eos> - I don't care.<eos> If you are serious about this man and you feel nothing for me, why do you want me to touch you again?<eos> - I don't.<eos> - You do.
Need you to make me something.<eos> It's for a patient.<eos> Hunter showed up at the hospital.<eos> - Did you know that?<eos> - No, I didn't.
We gave thanks because of your dad.<eos> I don't know what to do.<eos> I can't make this decision for you.<eos> I don't want to disappoint Esme or Joshua.<eos> Of course, I don't.
We can go cure them over here.<eos> Come on.<eos> - Watch here.<eos> - Did you see his eye?<eos> I did.
Previously on "Black Box"...<eos> I'd like to propose a-a toast to the brilliant woman who I'm now going to be spending the rest of my life with.<eos> What happened between us... It was meaningless sex.<eos> Why do you want me to touch you again?<eos> - I don't.
Well, it's what you want, isn't it?<eos> I'm open.<eos> You want to talk about this?<eos> Sure.<eos> If you do.
But you will.<eos> I don't know.<eos> Maybe I'm out of my depth.<eos> Hey. I very much doubt you're out of your depth, but even if you are, you know how to swim, don't you?<eos> Yes, I do.
Jaye, I...<eos> Don't beat yourself up for closing that door.<eos> You thought I was right behind you.<eos> Looks like we make a pretty good team.<eos> We do, don't we? Good.
All it takes is one person's cousin to visit from Lynchburg.<eos> Someone you went to school with or some client that you spent the night with.<eos> - Those guys would never end up here.<eos> - You don't know that.<eos> Yeah. I do.
He's gonna get away with it, isn't he?<eos> Yes.<eos> He is.<eos> - Take an iced tea if you have any.<eos> - We don't.
- What took you so long?<eos> I can have a briefing ready in five minutes.<eos> Don't bother.<eos> I had Seth do it. He doesn't have security clearance.<eos> Well, he does now.
I'm immortal.<eos> Wrong.<eos> I don't want to die.<eos> Tough shit.<eos> Who does?
That furnace.<eos> Yes.<eos> The grate providing ventilation for the blacksmith's forge.<eos> Dragonetti said that was too dangerous.<eos> He did.
Spare my house.<eos> Why should I, when my own house has been sacked by that scoundrel Brilhac, who calls himself General?<eos> You're lucky to be alive!<eos> Maurice, tell them, if you know of a hiding place.<eos> I don't, mother.
I've spent hours looking for it.<eos> I could have stopped you falling from that horse.<eos> Yes.<eos> I didn't tell you where the ditch was.<eos> No, you didn't.
I know.<eos> So, why were you coming to see me?<eos> Because I wasn't completely honest with you the last time I saw you.<eos> I said I didn't have any feelings left for you, and...<eos> I did.
So, why were you coming to see me?<eos> Because I wasn't completely honest with you the last time I saw you.<eos> I said I didn't have any feelings left for you, and...<eos> I did.<eos> I do.
I was kind of hoping we could talk before he...<eos> There is nothing for us to talk about, Daniel.<eos> I just want this whole thing over.<eos> I understand.<eos> No, you don't.
What?<eos> No, did you get the results?<eos> Not yet, but I have it.<eos> I know I do.<eos> Of course I do!
Uh, w-well, no... no... no reason.<eos> I just... [Chuckles] Yeah, I thought you were mad.<eos> [Sighs] Look, Harry, I know... Deep down, you still hate me.<eos> No.<eos> No, I don't.
All I wanted was to protect you from this.<eos> All of it.<eos> No. I needed to hear this.<eos> I wanted to know all this time why you kept pushing me away.<eos> Now I do.
My name... is Bedelia Du Maurier.<eos> You're Hannibal Lecter's therapist.<eos> What's that like?<eos> I've heard so much about you, I feel I almost know you.<eos> - You don't.
Now is your opportunity.<eos> You intend me to be my own last supper?<eos> Yes.<eos> How does one politely refuse a dish in circumstances such as these?<eos> One doesn't.
Tell me what you believe is happening.<eos> What do I believe?<eos> What do you believe?<eos> Do you believe Will killed Freddie Lounds?<eos> No, I don't.
Understand me, Excellency.<eos> As close to this house, I felt it was my duty...<eos> You have done well, Vilaça.<eos> If I need something, I'll call you.<eos> - What does he?
Like the good book says, it's all about burn time and cloud cover.<eos> But I know your mom will be watching.<eos> I've never seen anyone love someone the way she loves you.<eos> You know that, right?<eos> I did.
And she rung up The, um...<eos> Batteries or something.<eos> Well, that was a...<eos> No, that was a big victory.<eos> And i didn't...
Right now, we wait.<eos> Hetty's contact is en route with keys to a safe house.<eos> It's a favor from a Russian mobster who owes her one.<eos> FBI knows you're in town.<eos> Figure Carter does, too.
Yeah.<eos> Kens, you know when you... you really want something, and you get it, but somehow, it's... not the way that you wanted it at all?<eos> I...<eos> I want to be aa agent.<eos> I do.
Brunson's unstable, Hetty.<eos> If he keeps it up, I'm taking the shot.<eos> Understood.<eos> It's a bitch when things don't go according to plan.<eos> Do they ever?
They're my '27 Yankees.<eos> Doesn't get any easier, does it?<eos> Sending them out each time, never knowing if they'll come back.<eos> They always come back, Owen.<eos> Until one day they don't.
A suspected gang informant got merc'd two weeks ago at that same spot.<eos> Who killed Agent Clark?<eos> I don't know for sure, but that's the Gaki Boyz style.<eos> Why would the Gaki Boyz want Agent Clark dead?<eos> They don't.
That brain-dead water jockey?<eos> He's basically like a roided-out version of me, and I'm not roided out, Jillian.<eos> I'm roided in.<eos> Oh, well, I don't think it was his brain she was attracted to, if you get my drift.<eos> - I don't.
From your wife that has you on that diet?<eos> Damn!<eos> I don't want to be on his wife's diet.<eos> Do you?<eos> - No, I don't.
But if you hit her because she's out of pocket...<eos> Isn't it more sexist not to hit a woman because she's a woman?<eos> What you're saying is more sexist...<eos> I'm saying, do you want us to hold the door for you or not?<eos> Well, you do.
However, in this case, the observation wants for accuracy, since apparently I'm in a position to do you a great deal of good.<eos> Indeed, but not for long.<eos> My lady Selima believes it would be quicker to torture from you what we need.<eos> So I understand.<eos> I, myself, do not.
You imagine so?<eos> Truthfully?<eos> Don't get yourself into harm's way again.<eos> What do you mean "again"?<eos> I never did it once.
Yeah, more than we can say for Aaron Whitmore.<eos> Weren't he and Elena tight?<eos> Yep. Does she know Damon killed him?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Does she?
Who are you?<eos> I'm Sloan, and you met some of the travelers when they were taking a bucket of your blood.<eos> Oh, yeah. How could I forget?<eos> So, you have the antidote to this ripper virus, correct?<eos> We do, thanks to Enzo.
It's probably nothing.<eos> Speak.<eos> Well, don't you think that Stefan and Elena have been a little...<eos> You know?<eos> No. Clearly I don't.
I got you!<eos> Looks like I've now saved you from both metaphorical darkness and actual darkness.<eos> I think you owe me a beer.<eos> You said you had a plan, Bonnie.<eos> I did.
Frank.<eos> You look like you've seen a ghost.<eos> I'm not at all sure that I haven't.<eos> When he pushed past me, he was close enough that I should have felt him brush my sleeve as he passed, but I--<eos> I didn't.
I got that from hanging up the phone.<eos> He's perfect.<eos> This is the greatest day of my entire life.<eos> I didn't even know pumpkin pounders existed.<eos> Well, we do.
- Jay. Jay, do you read?<eos> - Loud and clear, boss.<eos> - What's going on?<eos> - You got a visual on Carrie?<eos> Indeed I do.
- I didn't...<eos> - Don't lie to me.<eos> I did know.<eos> But I loved him.<eos> We both did.
- I love your blog.<eos> Well, thank you.<eos> Thank you very much.<eos> - I didn't know you read it.<eos> - God, everybody does.
- But they were always home by bedtime.<eos> - What for?<eos> A reputation.<eos> You know.<eos> No, I don't.
On the road.<eos> At the edge of town.<eos> - Did they have boyfriends? - No.<eos> Is it true they wanted to leave town?<eos> - Who doesn't? - I don't.
Okay, okay.<eos> Where were you?<eos> You already know, I was with Marina the whole time.<eos> How do you know her?<eos> I don't.
I'll call you when I hear back.<eos> You're protecting him.<eos> What?<eos> You don't know how things work around here.<eos> Yes, I do.
Uh, did he tell you... that Dani's moving in with him?<eos> Danni's moving in?<eos> No, he didn't.<eos> It's his life, though I still don't understand why he didn't break up with her, but that's... none of my business, right?<eos> He did.
He's just talking to me.<eos> You don't legally have to be in there.<eos> But if Norman wants you in there anyway,<eos> - that's fine with me.<eos> - No, I-I don't.
But he doesn't even know me.<eos> I told him about you.<eos> So you just told him, and... and he believed it, even though he doesn't know me?<eos> And I told you, and... and you know me better than anyone.<eos> And you didn't?
I told him about you.<eos> So you just told him, and... and he believed it, even though he doesn't know me?<eos> And I told you, and... and you know me better than anyone.<eos> And you didn't?<eos> - And you still don't?
Did... did I do something wrong?<eos> - It's not that.<eos> - Well, then what is it?<eos> - Why don't you believe me?<eos> - I do.
She was never in it.<eos> She was Allison's aunt.<eos> And a total sociopath.<eos> You don't have to talk about it now if you don't want to.<eos> Um, yes, he does.
Above a college bar.<eos> And then there's the kid in Florida.<eos> She's fine with her mother.<eos> Yeah, but shouldn't you and her be tryin' to make it work?<eos> We did.
This is the unflushable turd that is left in the can for the next person, e.g. me.<eos> The toilet's still broken, FYI.<eos> Has POTUS gone nuts?<eos> We can't have a crazy president.<eos> In Italy they do.
Please, man, It wasn't my idea, I swear.<eos> No?<eos> Then whose was it, huh?<eos> - Whose was it?<eos> - All right. No, no! Please don't.
Lukas is dangerous to all that.<eos> You don't have a lot of options.<eos> With everything in my fucking heart, all I know is I've got to protect this.<eos> You know how that feels?<eos> I do.
Uh, but first, we need to see everyone's weapons.<eos> If you could just lay them down in front of you.<eos> All right.<eos> - I'm sure you understand.<eos> - Yes, I do.
We bonded, like two peas in a pod.<eos> I mean, sure there was some downsides, like I was never allowed to have Cocoa Puffs in the house.<eos> But that was more than made up for by her teaching me how to shave, and how to drive, and how to hit a curveball. I mean, we were always together.<eos> Do you know what it's like to have your mom take you to a Bulls game?<eos> No, you don't.
When he was done...<eos> Howard would clean David up.<eos> Then he'd come over to me and just say...<eos> "Don't tell Mommy."<eos> And I never did.
But I learned a secret that I can tell you.<eos> They don't deserve it.<eos> He's ruined this day for me forever.<eos> Nobody knows that we're not together.<eos> Yeah, but you do.
Was my best friend.<eos> Anyway, she said...<eos> "Brook, be a grasshopper."<eos> And it just made so much sense, you know?<eos> No, I don't.
- Hurry up.<eos> - Can I rinse off?<eos> They used to hold an empty one for Red.<eos> - Move it!<eos> Do it in the fucking sink. - Ow!
Congratulations.<eos> You've officially destroyed a man's life.<eos> No. You gotta tell her that if the bank is closed on Sunday... that there's no fucking late fee if you pay her Monday morning.<eos> - That shit's not right.<eos> - I did.
Really? But it's getting clearer every second that you're totally batshit crazy. But you're a beautiful, sweet girl.<eos> Fuck this guy.<eos> So many people are gonna love you.<eos> No. No. Nobody's gonna love me.<eos> I do.
We abandon our principles together.<eos> You found her out by the greenhouse?<eos> What was she doing out there?<eos> I do not remember taking Lady Locksley out there.<eos> I do not!
No... that's what makes you great.<eos> Thanks, Rosa.<eos> Hey, you ever think about Jay-Z and Beyoncé fucking?<eos> 'Cause I do.<eos> Like, more than I do myself, even.
What do you need?<eos> Sebastian blood.<eos> He's about to be the new mayor of starling city.<eos> I know who he is.<eos> No, you don't.
Sebastian blood.<eos> He's about to be the new mayor of starling city.<eos> I know who he is.<eos> No, you don't.<eos> No one does.
You can't pin it on sebastian blood.<eos> Daddy, please, you have to believe me!<eos> Please!<eos> Please.<eos> I don't, baby.
I suppose you think I was wrong about sebastian, too, though.<eos> I think...<eos> That you have everyone fooled, Because you want people to think that none of this gets to you.<eos> And that you don't need anyone's help.<eos> I don't!
I thought it would be instructive for you to know what it feels like To suddenly lose someone you love.<eos> To have them ripped from your life without warning.<eos> You do not want to hurt my mother.<eos> You're right.<eos> I don't.
But I've made some mistakes.<eos> What sort of mistakes?<eos> I took money from my employer.<eos> I invested it with a Wall Street man that said it couldn't lose.<eos> Then it did.
And I'm here to make certain that she gets it.<eos> Miss Mallon, would you take the stand, please?<eos> Place your hand here, please.<eos> Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?<eos> - I do.
So, please, just do as you're told.<eos> - John...<eos> - Now, Nurse Elkins.<eos> You see what it's doing to him?<eos> I do.
Meanwhile, the pageant girls were quenching their thirst from another questionable source.<eos> Tessa: - Um, what's that?<eos> - It's go-go juice.<eos> Oh, you don't know about that?<eos> Everyone does it.
You need some?<eos> No. No.<eos> We don't need some.<eos> Alana has plenty of natural pluck and sparkle.<eos> [ Chuckles ] Does she, though?
Would you look who's standing in our office?<eos> Oh, no way.<eos> I can't believe it's that guy!<eos> - You have no idea who that is, do you?<eos> - Yes, I do.
I assure you, ma'am, the Indians do have souls, if any of us do.<eos> "If"? - Anne:<eos> And what about witches?<eos> Do they have souls, too?<eos> They do.
"Do you want to allow modifications of your work?"<eos> I was floored, just completely flabbergasted that these adults regarded him as an adult, and Aaron stood up there in front of a whole audience full of people, and just started talking about the platform that he'd created for Creative Commons,<eos> and they were all listening to him, just...<eos> I was sitting at the back, thinking: he's just a kid, why are they listening to him?<eos> But they did...
I was testing you... the no-sex policy at work... and you passed, so well done, fellow employee.<eos> Okay.<eos> Sure you were.<eos> I hate you.<eos> Of course you do.
- It's Latin.<eos> The only people lacking mental capacity in this courtroom are them and anyone who would consider this ridiculous argument.<eos> Whoa. Whoa, the judge is considering.<eos> Your Honor, he just called you crazy.<eos> - No. I most certainly did not.
Yes.<eos> And as I recall, you were asked to leave.<eos> Do you remember telling us that you thought Mason was insane?<eos> I never said that.<eos> And didn't you... what?
Now let's get back to the fair.<eos> Lily, when you told me about your project on the bus,<eos> I thought it sounded good.<eos> I thought you could win.<eos> - Yeah, we both did.
Which means you were scared I was gonna do better than you.<eos> Which means... someone thinks I'm a good teacher.<eos> No, I don't.<eos> Boom!<eos> (hushed) I do.
Mexico!<eos> In a tunnel!<eos> I had no choice but to let them dig that tunnel!<eos> You let them build a thousand-yard tunnel into your land, and yet you got nothing in return, Mr. Phelps?<eos> Of course I did.
All in the line of duty.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I got you that thing you wanted.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> How did you...
It's not a con.<eos> It's a sting.<eos> Sting.<eos> The prosecutor doesn't know that this is not real.<eos> The Attorney General does.
Do you recall the day of McAllister's death?<eos> I do -- big day.<eos> I had been chasing the man for eight years.<eos> Any of you know what it's like to be driven by a moral imperative?<eos> You do.
They're so sparkly.<eos> Oh, my God. You noticed my glitter lotion? Yeah.<eos> Oh, look.<eos> It's on me, too.<eos> At least somebody did.
Oh. Well, we found something that belongs to you.<eos> Where'd you get that?<eos> Over at the Fishing Camp.<eos> You know it, don't you?<eos> Sure you do.
We've been sitting here like two hours, dude.<eos> You guys heard of human rights?<eos> No such thing.<eos> Which one of you found Tyler's body?<eos> I did.
I mean, my own parents thought I was guilty.<eos> You were a legit suspect.<eos> The file says that you were stalking Greta.<eos> You were spying on her.<eos> I-I didn't.
I mean, she was 15.<eos> I was 18.<eos> You do the math.<eos> Well, for what it's worth, we talked to Christie, and she always thought you were innocent.<eos> She did?
You do the math.<eos> Well, for what it's worth, we talked to Christie, and she always thought you were innocent.<eos> She did?<eos> She said that?<eos> Yeah, she did.
Yeah, apparently, it's good.<eos> No burgers.<eos> I wish my wife were here.<eos> Women really love this kind of stuff.<eos> Yeah, they do.
What happened in that box with Reddington?<eos> He saved my life and then threatened to kill me.<eos> What he said while doing that is none of your business.<eos> According to the report from your therapist, you feel guilty about what happened during the raid.<eos> Of course I do.
Where is Schroeder?<eos> He should be in here now.<eos> I don't even know who you are.<eos> I need to know exactly what you told him.<eos> No, you don't.
We have two minutes to access the security door.<eos> Shall we?<eos> Lizzy, I know this must be very difficult for you, but we can't both lead.<eos> How did you know about Omaha?<eos> I didn't.
He escaped.<eos> Now you ask me to meet in secret, off the record, so you can tell me you're willing to work with him?<eos> You let Reddington get away.<eos> You want him on the street.<eos> I don't.
What are you doing in a bunny costume, bear?<eos> I'm here with the parents, Stan and Francine Smith.<eos> Do you folks have a statement?<eos> I just want my baby to come home.<eos> Of course you do.
This was, this was a great idea!<eos> I know, right?<eos> Ooh, grab-grab that cab.<eos> Hey, so what's the craziest thing you ever... has ever happened in this cab?<eos> So-so how many hours did...?
- Well, this is what we're playing.<eos> - But it doesn't make any sense.<eos> Oh!<eos> It sounds like Anthony wants to forfeit.<eos> - He doesn't.
Congratulations.<eos> She's gonna be like me.<eos> Like my mother.<eos> - You don't know that.<eos> - No, I do.
Most of my employees have some sort of military training.<eos> - And who... who's that?<eos> - Bobby Hammond.<eos> - He work here too?<eos> - He did.
I'm gonna call Juliette.<eos> Yeah, dealing with a 6-foot-tall scorpion, we're gonna need all the help we can get.<eos> Okay, the first candidate is from 13th-century France.<eos> It's called a Trasque... a small, solitary creature who loves the singing of maidens.<eos> Who doesn't?
We watch TV on our own, and it's really nice. Yeah.<eos> Tom makes the best finger sandwiches.<eos> Oh, oh, does he?<eos> I'm so glad you like those.<eos> I really do.
I do love that end table.<eos> That's a start.<eos> I do love you.<eos> You know that, right?<eos> Yeah, I do.
There's no way to cross over, not without another curse.<eos> We have to move on.<eos> This is our home now.<eos> Now, I know you miss them.<eos> So do we.
Told me what?<eos> The truth about us, Regina.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> How do you know my mother?<eos> The same way you do.
They will not let me off till I go with them,<eos> "respond to them."<eos> You know what it is?<eos> You know what will happen to you if you break it?<eos> No, you don't.
Bulletproof?<eos> Completely.<eos> Sorry.<eos> We missed the 4:00. Did you get my text?<eos> I did.
No one is watching you.<eos> Who's that guy?<eos> That's a teaching fellow.<eos> You don't know that.<eos> Yeah, I do.
I'm buying it, except for two things.<eos> I can't put Tommy and Melanie together at that reunion, and I can't out them together at that party 22 years ago.<eos> Ok, so the police report said something about blue paint transfer from the car to Vicky's clothing, right?<eos> Yeah, we check with DMV, neither Tommy nor Melanie had a blue car.<eos> But Melanie's aunt, Laura, did.
Seems like something else is on your mind.<eos> He doesn't just want to work together.<eos> He wants us to keep seeing each other.<eos> And you don't want to risk the one to have the other.<eos> No, I don't.
The plan is shock and awe.<eos> If we rush a tender offer, we won't have enough leverage to force people to vote with us.<eos> It's fine to have shock and awe when you're the only one in the game. But Walter Gillis knows we're coming and he got himself an ally.<eos> How do you know that?<eos> Because I do.
No, it's not for me.<eos> Remember when I said two years ago... We had to concentrate? Us all to Swedish House Mafia<eos> I do not know whether we then used drugs.<eos> We need to focus our subsequent and our solo things have to give.<eos> Yes, you did.
I know that you've been replaced at B613 as command.<eos> I work for the Smithsonian.<eos> My title is chief curator.<eos> I'm just saying I know what happened.<eos> No, you don't.
I thought you said you were dropping this?<eos> I tried the dark side. Turns out you were right. Didn't suit me.<eos> He's brilliant and ego-maniacal and has done more to thwart the rule of law than you and I will probably ever know.<eos> And he's powerful. And he thinks he doesn't have a weakness.<eos> But he does.
And this debate could be the nail in your coffin.<eos> I've been there.<eos> If this debate happens, you are going to go to jail.<eos> I-I don't know if we sell copy paper.<eos> Because I just don't, okay?
- Olivia proxy.<eos> Right.<eos> I'm calling her.<eos> She said you'd say that.<eos> - Did she?
You think you're family...<eos> But you're nothing but the help.<eos> And you don't even know it.<eos> You don't know what you're talking about.<eos> Oh, I do.
But you're nothing but the help.<eos> And you don't even know it.<eos> You don't know what you're talking about.<eos> Oh, I do.<eos> I do.
Yeah.<eos> No.<eos> I don't know.<eos> I don't know why I'm calling you.<eos> Yes, you do.
You didn't trust me.<eos> No, Gr... Grayson, listen.<eos> You have no idea how many times I tried to tell you the truth.<eos> I tried.<eos> But you didn't.
Yes, it did.<eos> Fuck that.<eos> You believe that story?<eos> Coming from this?<eos> Yeah, I do.
No, now you should be!<eos> You have every right to be!<eos> I would be, too, if I was...<eos> I wasn't thinking!<eos> I didn't...
And you believe him?<eos> Yeah, I do.<eos> Why?<eos> I mean, how well do you know him?<eos> I just do.
Baby, I don't know what you're thinking. Doesn't matter what I'm thinking.<eos> What matters is I can't think of anyone but you... And me...<eos> Who knows where that gold's at.<eos> And such a betrayal.<eos> I didn't
Don't let anyone make you feel like a fallback.<eos> Sometimes I pull total 10s out of here.<eos> There's no rhyme or reason to the dating game.<eos> You are so wise.<eos> I do a lot of drugs.
We're friends.<eos> - It doesn't help.<eos> - You don't actually believe--<eos> No.<eos> But enough of the country still does.
it's so weird, you know?<eos> I-I love going to bed early and getting up early.<eos> And ... and ... and ... and drinking at home.<eos> - And I love pyjama pants!<eos> - Who doesn't?
With large fries and two ice teas.<eos> And apple pie with ice-cream pudding.<eos> We didn't order it.<eos> Hold on. Hold on.<eos> I did.
So the chart says that you've been in an accident.<eos> Leg fell asleep.<eos> Foot slipped off the brake.<eos> But then again, you and me... we never knew when to stop, right?<eos> - He didn't?
Hey, who wants to do something fun?<eos> - I do!
Chick was definitely motivated.<eos> But he's too motivated.<eos> It's awful.<eos> Do you know how many towel snap marks I have on my ass?<eos> I actually do.
Score. Thank you. Nope.<eos> You're on the stupid diet with the rest of us, Tucker.<eos> No special privileges just 'cause the waitress wants to ask you out.<eos> Tansy and I are just...<eos> She doesn't...
Yeah?<eos> Well, Simmons is probably smarter, technically, but that's because she likes homework more than life itself.<eos> Nice to have someone to talk shop with all the time... or to just plain talk to.<eos> You know, um, I didn't like it here at the Academy at first.<eos> - You didn't?
I don't know.<eos> She was right behind us.<eos> I can't believe I fell for it again.<eos> - Alice, we don't know...<eos> - Yes, we do.
- Yeah.<eos> Hey, I've got an update on your Wim Stuyvesant.<eos> God, please tell me he doesn't exist.<eos> He doesn't exist.<eos> But he did.
I'm gobsmacked.<eos> That must be Wim Stuyvesant.<eos> Gee.<eos> How do you say "Suck it" in English?<eos> You just did, Shawn.
- Everything we spoke about.<eos> Getting the Republic back, that's what you want, right?<eos> Well, trust me, we need his help to do it.<eos> You understand?<eos> Do you?
Yeah.<eos> Oh.<eos> Donnie has the ball.<eos> - Oh!<eos> He does!
Did you have to go to the bathroom?<eos> - No.<eos> I need the truth.<eos> - Oh, ooh.<eos> Yeah, I-I didn't ...
Ah, you better have a good reason for being late.<eos> Oh, I do.
- So? You pay Luisa to clean it.<eos> Go to your room.<eos> Oh, by the way, Luisa broke that garbage disposal.<eos> Did you know?<eos> No, you didn't.
- You ever been a 3-foot tall half ling running through 2-foot high vines trying to punch a 7-foot monster?<eos> I'm gonna check the others.<eos> Check your character.<eos> Or just kind of generally take this game seriously.<eos> Your son does.
Eat fresh!<eos> Subway, ho!<eos> Did we just save Greendale?<eos> - Did we just save Greendale?<eos> - No, no, you did not.
I didn't do anything about it.<eos> Look, are you joking?<eos> No!<eos> No, no. I thought it was her.<eos> We all did. We...
Then who the hell is?<eos> Evil.<eos> What?<eos> Did you just say "evil"?<eos> Yeah, Tom, I did.
So is there anything going on between you and Liam, then?<eos> - SHE SCOFFS - No.<eos> Why?<eos> Do you think there is?<eos> - Amy Malone does.
What's she doing here?<eos> - She's come to beg me not to fight her.<eos> - Well?<eos> Did she tell you where she keeps sneaking off with Liam?<eos> No. She didn't.
The "scope".<eos> That's the word I got this morning.<eos> It's unbelievable to me that you guys never worked through that.<eos> You must have known... you must have known somebody that died from AIDS, right?<eos> Oh yeah, honey, everybody did.
He just kept on saying, "please, please, please."<eos> - Danny. - For him.<eos> For all of us, especially you.<eos> - I... - I don't understand.<eos> I didn't either.
Don't worry.<eos> We're gonna get you out of here in no time, man.<eos> - I'm gonna call Alex.<eos> - No.<eos> Don't, Joel.
- monitor both of you.<eos> - You know he's still alive, right?<eos> His heart is slowing down, but he's still alive.<eos> I think that he's a fighter.<eos> I do.
It's like the wishbone, you know?<eos> Remember the wishbone?<eos> You always got the big piece.<eos> You remember that?<eos> I never did, not once.
And that.<eos> Okay, Honey, listen.<eos> It's okay.<eos> I know.<eos> You do?
Anything you leave on your desk is mine.<eos> Uh, have a seat. Have a seat.<eos> I'm trying to tell Jenny that I love her.<eos> She doesn't know already?<eos> Hell, the rest of the world does.
I think he's all right.<eos> Thank you.<eos> If you hadn't stopped when you did, that car might have...<eos> I don't know how he didn't see him.<eos> He did.
Shit.<eos> Something's happening?<eos> Something's on my nose.<eos> Get it off! You have an itch.<eos> Humans do that.
- Where you going?<eos> I've got to handle some details.<eos> Don't you have people for that?<eos> It's called "customer service," Tasha.<eos> I do this part myself.
Oh, God.<eos> We both know how this ends.<eos> Neither one of us walks out of here a happy man, huh?<eos> I don't wanna rat.<eos> I don't.
20.<eos> Sabueso caught a bachelor party.<eos> Had to stay on to deliver.<eos> And this motherfucker here hits Cruz when he's holding the money from all the day runs?<eos> Plus we did that brick drop tonight.
From what I can see, The Scythe is a true sociopath.<eos> Ilaria's hatchet man.<eos> And yet your father worked for the very same corporation.<eos> How do you defend that?<eos> I don't.
I'm not saying that because I did no such thing.<eos> Would you be willing to prove that by taking a polygraph?<eos> Look, Edward, you were the one who wanted to talk to us, remember?<eos> If you cooperate, we can drop all this tough-guy stuff and just get to the bottom of what really happened.<eos> And if I don't?
When I was married to Jake, he beat me.<eos> And I'm gonna tell the world.<eos> I'm not afraid anymore.<eos> Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?<eos> I do.
What did you say?<eos> - What?<eos> -Your... daughter?<eos> - I didn't say that.<eos> -Yes, you did. No.
Big ol' clogged toilet in the girls' room.<eos> It's pretty bad.<eos> You'll know it when you see it.<eos> Thanks for the heads-up, Tre.<eos> No problem... just do me a favor.
I really like you, Derrick, but you'd be the only thing keeping me here.<eos> I can bartend anywhere.<eos> And Sam and his dad...<eos> I don't know what to do.<eos> Uh... yeah, you do.
There was this big, bright round yellow thing. And all this blue.<eos> - Bees don't dream.<eos> -Why?<eos> Well...<eos> They just don't.
You were the bait.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I-I didn't mean to get...<eos> I mean, I never would, uh...<eos> I did...
Look, I didn't have a choice.<eos> I can't go to the awards gala with her.<eos> I feel bad, okay?<eos> It just... seemed like you... didn't really want to go.<eos> I didn't.
Someone.<eos> Congratulations.<eos> You know, it's great, Mom.<eos> You deserve to be happy.<eos> - Everybody does. - Yeah.
Working with him last year cost you your detective shield.<eos> Now, it can cost you 18 months in prison.<eos> They want his name.<eos> Do you know who the Arrow is?<eos> I don't.
These are Kaiten torpedoes.<eos> Manually operated.<eos> Someone needs to steer from inside.<eos> Okay, but then, how do they get away from the explosion?<eos> They do not.
Never mind.<eos> Hey, Lyla.<eos> I love you.<eos> You know that, right?<eos> I do, actually.
My blade against your neck.<eos> Just like my blade is against the neck of your beloved.<eos> If only I'd killed you then, everything would be different.<eos> Drop the bow, kid.<eos> Do it.
You helped me become a hero, Slade.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You think I won't get out of here?<eos> You think I won't kill those you care for?<eos> No, I don't.
I...<eos> Maybe you might have meant it.<eos> What you said.<eos> You really sold it.<eos> We both did.
Go away.<eos> Back off! Now!<eos> Let him go.<eos> You heard me.<eos> Now, do it.
Bridgette, I know this is a lot.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> But I'm gonna need your help.<eos> If you know where he might be, if he's tried to contact you, you need to tell me right now.<eos> I don't.
You know how it works.<eos> First person to step up gets a deal, and Yamada is dead.<eos> I call that an opportunity.<eos> Look, you talk now... maybe you serve two to three years in a minimum-security prison and you get some kind of relationship with your children.<eos> But if you don't...
But she can.<eos> - Done!<eos> - Nah.<eos> I thought you didn't like to drink.<eos> I don't.
I believe that a joke is a brief oral narrative with a climactic humorous twist.<eos> For example, uh, Wolowitz's mother is so fat that she decided to go on a diet... or exercise, or both.<eos> See?<eos> The twist is that people don't usually change.<eos> Well, they don't.
How could you say that?<eos> I don't know...<eos> I got all confused when you said "honestly".<eos> Look, do I think that you are talented and that you are beautiful?<eos> Of course I do.
Don't stop, go on.<eos> Tell me how I'm gonna be a waitress for the rest of my life.<eos> That is not what I said.<eos> Look, I think you're really good.<eos> I truly do.
For if the assassins had succeeded, you would be the unquestioned head of the bank.<eos> Perhaps our profits would benefit.<eos> It was easy for you to blame the Duke, with his troops enforcing the embargo.<eos> I don't like your tone, Signor.<eos> You don't?
So you really imagine the architects of this structure would use the same deception twice.<eos> I see.<eos> It doesn't matter.<eos> Zo meant you no harm.<eos> None of us do.
Hey, Fruit Brute!<eos> You don't remember me do you?<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> - I just made an ass out of myself.<eos> - No, no, no. I... I do.
I have all this energy, like I drank 100 Red Bulls or something.<eos> And I think like in a jiffy.<eos> Real quick.<eos> Did we...<eos> We didn't...
Eating burgers whenever you want.<eos> Yeah, I'm thinking about sub-letting the space on the other side.<eos> If you know anyone who is interested, it would make a really great spot for like a start-up.<eos> I think.<eos> I did, but...
No.<eos> Seriously?<eos> What were you guys doing in the storage closet that whole time?<eos> We just wanted to be together.<eos> We still do.
I'm sorry. I-I can't.<eos> I'm pregnant.<eos> I don't need anything from you.<eos> I just figured you deserve to know.<eos> And now you do.
I've been jetlagged before. It doesn't make you feel like you're on your period.<eos> Midsummer Night's Dream!<eos> Did you tell them?<eos> Tom, how do they know I'm on my period?<eos> They don't.
Midsummer Night's Dream!<eos> Did you tell them?<eos> Tom, how do they know I'm on my period?<eos> They don't.<eos> Okay, well, they do.
Did you tell them?<eos> Tom, how do they know I'm on my period?<eos> They don't.<eos> Okay, well, they do.<eos> We do.
Making a difference.<eos> If I can help one person get back on the right path, then...<eos> I'm doing my job.<eos> You know what I mean? Mm-hmm.<eos> Yeah. I do, and I...
Wonder why he kept it a secret.<eos> Because the men in this family like to brag about everyone's accomplishments but their own.<eos> Uncle Danny, didn't you get a medal for your time in Fallujah?<eos> Really, Dad?<eos> He did.
Yeah, I just... I just wish things had turned out differently.<eos> Because if you had turned him in, maybe he'd still be alive?<eos> Yeah, maybe something like that.<eos> Danny, no, you can't think like that.<eos> You didn't do anything wrong.
No.<eos> (Sighs) I've been thinking.<eos> Me too.<eos> I said a lot of things.<eos> We both did.
Stop it!<eos> I need this.<eos> Chef Asher cancelled our date for tonight.<eos> He said he didn't think we had a real connection.<eos> - You didn't.
No! No.<eos> No, Mr. Moyer.<eos> I'm not going to engage in any of that with you.<eos> - She said it back.<eos> - Of course she did.
- She said it back.<eos> - Of course she did.<eos> Now get off of my balcony before I ask you if she cried.<eos> - Did she cry?<eos> - She did.
Thank you.<eos> Hey, Jeanne.<eos> Have you heard?<eos> My transfer finally came through.<eos> No, I didn't.
Is... is that all you got?<eos> I bet you banged my brother harder than that.<eos> No matter what you think, I never slept with Killian.<eos> I loved you, Dash.<eos> - I really did.
You sound surprised.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You're welcome, Aunt Wendy.<eos> Did you feel that?<eos> I did.
- I got rid of it.<eos> I didn't want it anywhere near me.<eos> So, the truth is he just could've found your earring.<eos> Joanna, you asked me to come out here to talk about this because you have doubts.<eos> I do.
Because he fed me lies about all of you, and I believed him.<eos> I didn't know what I was doing.<eos> By the time I realized how wrong I'd been about everything, it was too late.<eos> I thought you understood.<eos> I do, I do.
Dash told me, Freya.<eos> About everything.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> I know you're a witch.<eos> You do?
They're collateral damage.<eos> We'd be saving lives, and it could take weeks, tracking them down.<eos> We don't have that kind of time.<eos> Look, just... tell me where you saw the Mandragora.<eos> I didn't.
It makes sense.<eos> You've been hurt... a lot.<eos> Do you want to know<eos> - how this turns out?<eos> - No, she doesn't.
You've been hurt... a lot.<eos> Do you want to know<eos> - how this turns out?<eos> - No, she doesn't.<eos> - Yes, I do!
Because we shouldn't fight?<eos> Because we're family?<eos> Because I can trust... you?<eos> You don't want to do this.<eos> Yeah, I do.
How are you saying this to me right now?<eos> ! - On my birthday, by the way.<eos> - I know it sounds, nuts.<eos> - Okay?<eos> I do. - Yeah.
- It wasn't like that.<eos> - Yeah, kind of was.<eos> I had a very good reason.<eos> That's what you always say.<eos> She really did this time.
Did you know Kyle well?<eos> No, ma'am, I can't say I did.<eos> Do you like being here?<eos> The Academy's taught me how to be disciplined, courageous, serve the greater good, to be a man.<eos> Yes, ma'am, I most certainly do.
Hey. What can I get you?<eos> Uh, I'll have the Gin Rickey, and the ladies will have the champagne, the billecart rosé.<eos> You don't remember me, do you?<eos> No.<eos> Yes, of course I do! Yes!
Is Bjorn going with you?<eos> That's up to Bjorn.<eos> Bjorn, you have a big choice to make.<eos> I admire your mother.<eos> We all do.
And I couldn't help but notice that you've yet to take a public stance on my guilt.<eos> I like to know all the details of a story before I tell it.<eos> Jack told you what Conrad did to his family?<eos> - How did you know?<eos> - I didn't.
And please... please forgive me for all the lives I've taken... including the one I will take today.<eos> Hey, you're driving me to Eric's, so when Mom comes in and tells you, you remember.<eos> I totally knew that.<eos> No, you didn't.<eos> Yeah, I did.
Yeah, I did.<eos> No, you didn't.<eos> - Yeah, I did.<eos> - Nope.<eos> Okay, I did not.
Shit. I got to go.<eos> It's me.<eos> Yeah, well, there's been a problem.<eos> Sarah Manning's gone.<eos> I did, and now, I don't.
I followed you from mother's house.<eos> I shot you!<eos> You were dead!<eos> You were dead!<eos> Yes, you did.
Right?<eos> Sit, please, Paul.<eos> I'm in need of a new monitor.<eos> You have a monitor?<eos> She did.
Oh, shit. Shit!<eos> Dr. Cormier.<eos> My bad.<eos> I wanted to see the original genome.<eos> No! She didn't.
My bad.<eos> I wanted to see the original genome.<eos> No! She didn't.<eos> Aldous, you held back a stem-cell line from us.<eos> In fact, I didn't.
What's that smell?<eos> Um, no. No. Stop.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> ! What are you doing?<eos> ! Don't!
But why the DYAD cover story?<eos> Maybe they think he's dead.<eos> Maybe they told him to be dead and go live in guadalupe, only he's in our freezer.<eos> I know what to do.<eos> - Oh, you do, do you, Donnie? - Mm-hmm.
Unless you don't want her anymore.<eos> Of course we want her.<eos> It is not a question of whether we want Callie.<eos> It is... it is whether she wants us.<eos> - She does.
- Brandon.<eos> - What?<eos> She's just going to hurt you.<eos> You... you don't know...<eos> - I don't. - ...
If you're interested in using me as sperm donor, I'm in.<eos> If you wanna use Timothy,<eos> I think we should get together, all three of us, talk about it.<eos> The lawyer would like to know if you two would like to see your father first.<eos> - Oh, we don't.
Not far from here, actually. North Park.<eos> Now the lawyer spoke to your father, and he has agreed to sign away his parental rights.<eos> That's good.<eos> But the lawyer would like to know if you two would like to see your father first.<eos> Oh, we don't.
Now the lawyer spoke to your father, and he has agreed to sign away his parental rights.<eos> That's good.<eos> But the lawyer would like to know if you two would like to see your father first.<eos> Oh, we don't.<eos> I do.
- Why?<eos> 'Cause we both have to be there at the test, to make sure that nothing gets switched or whatever.<eos> I know you didn't want to know anything about him.<eos> Guess I don't have a choice.<eos> Some people do.
So?<eos> So, like, our first time shouldn't be in a car.<eos> Don't worry about me.<eos> I don't need the whole candles and roses thing if you don't.<eos> - I don't.
My dad thinks Jude is gay.<eos> That's why I can't spend the night at your house anymore.<eos> I see.<eos> - Did he say that to Jude?<eos> - No. But I did.
I hope you weren't rude.<eos> We raised you better than that.<eos> - Didn't we? - I wasn't rude.<eos> I just have a lot of homework.<eos> I still do.
But when it comes to girls, he can be a little all over the place.<eos> Not in a bad way.<eos> He's just not very good at expressing his true feelings.<eos> If he even knows what he's feeling.<eos> Which, most of the time, he doesn't.
If he even knows what he's feeling.<eos> Which, most of the time, he doesn't.<eos> He's easily confused.<eos> Are you saying he doesn't like me?<eos> No, he does.
Maybe we shouldn't talk about Crime and Punishment right now.<eos> It's a little heavy.<eos> - But not.<eos> You know?<eos> - I do.
Hi.<eos> Your dad is talking about having a baby with Dani.<eos> I need you to know why I'm helping Ana.<eos> - I know why.<eos> - No, you don't.
I know how it feels to love you and not know why you're pulling away.<eos> It's a lonely place to be.<eos> And frankly, it's not OK.<eos> I really don't want to talk about this.<eos> Of course you don't.
No matter what, they can't make you live with them.<eos> We'll still be your family.<eos> I'm never getting adopted.<eos> You don't know that.<eos> Yes I do.
I'm so stupid.<eos> I could have blown everything.<eos> But you didn't.<eos> Will anyone ever love me?<eos> I do.
Make sure you tag it, too.<eos> How did you get in here?<eos> I've been in here for a long time.<eos> It walked right to that evidence crate like it knew where it was going.<eos> Not like. It did.
She said she did, anyway.<eos> And you loved her too.<eos> Thought I did, yeah.<eos> She left you though.<eos> Yes, as a matter of fact, she did.
Yes, you did. You know, I was thinking... Maybe the three of us could get together and...<eos> Do this again sometime. What do you think?<eos> What, you mean like a band? - Let's do it. - Yeah.<eos> Did you sleep here? Yes...<eos> last night, I did. Sorry.
You tell me.<eos> You're the one who put me here.<eos> We can't keep doing this, Finch.<eos> Put you where?<eos> Doing what?

Blaine, come on, wait up.<eos> I can't even look at either of you... that's how grossed out I am.<eos> Please stop.<eos> We owe you an apology.<eos> Yes, yes, you do.
And I was wrong and I'm sorry.<eos> I thought we were gonna have the perfect senior year, and the one that we got has been so weird and really hard.<eos> Yeah. And so when I tried to plan the perfect night out and it didn't go the way that... that I'd hoped, I-I flipped out.<eos> And I guess I found it shocking to find two people kissing that I never really expected to find kissing, but, really, that happens all the time around here.<eos> It does.
"Do you want a blow job?"<eos> And I...<eos> Do you remember what I said?<eos> You were just like, "Yes, please." "Yes, please."<eos> Because I did.
You're standing where my wife took her last breath.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I'm so very sorry.<eos> Tell me she didn't die for nothing.<eos> If I did...
Okay, look, as city attorney, I represent this department and these officers.<eos> I got to know who sent me that drive.<eos> I'll have our I.T. Guy run it.<eos> - I'll make you a copy.<eos> - I already did.
You're blushing just looking at me.<eos> I mean, you're ready.<eos> All I got to do is look at you.<eos> We had something.<eos> Yeah, we did.
You're upset. I understand.<eos> But you've got to...<eos> I hate her!<eos> No, no, you don't.<eos> Yes, I do.
They wouldn't be after us if this wasn't real.<eos> This is my chance to tell a story that really matters.<eos> I love you, Ben.<eos> Do you love me?<eos> Of course, I do. I just...
It's easy enough to suppress this footage, coordinate a cover story, get out in front of it.<eos> But we still have a leak.<eos> And that angers me.<eos> I abhor being lied to.<eos> Who doesn't?
Raise your hand.<eos> It's a boy!<eos> Both: Yes!<eos> I thought you didn't have a preference.<eos> I didn't.
Like, what do you have to lose?<eos> Okay, what's up with you?<eos> - Hey, I didn't see you.<eos> - Whatever.<eos> Yeah, you did.
- I...<eos> - No, unfortunately for you... (Whispers) I never forget a face,<eos> (Normal voice) Which is surprising, I know, considering...<eos> - (Chuckles) Now I'm not a religious man...<eos> - I didn't...
You wouldn't even let me come to my own brother's funeral.<eos> You know why I did that.<eos> You know what?<eos> I don't want to dwell on the past anymore.<eos> I don't.
I'm just smarter than you are.<eos> Seriously, this is the most romantic present ever.<eos> You should write into like "Cosmo" or something.<eos> I'm sure they have a whole column for stories like this.<eos> They do.
I didn't even know if you and I were getting back together.<eos> Why do you think I came back here?<eos> I wanted to be here for you, like as your boyfriend.<eos> Since we were only on a break because of distance, I thought you wanted that too.<eos> I did.
She can't help it.<eos> Do you remember last Christmas?<eos> She turned this whole house upside down.<eos> She really thought we had bedbugs.<eos> And we didn't.
It's all just...<eos> Well, it's cruel.<eos> Ohh, you're out there in the john making baby batter, while in here, the doc gets the results from my very last test, and it turns out I'm the culprit.<eos> I don't even know what to say.<eos> Nobody does.
Doesn't that mean anything?<eos> Y-yes.<eos> Yes, of c... of course.<eos> That's all I think about...<eos> How to do right by you, the baby.
It's Betty Moretti now.<eos> Yeah. So you guys are friends from...<eos> Acquaintances, really.<eos> - Oh, we go way back. Mmm-hmm.<eos> Same gal does our hair at Clarise's.
All right.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Mrs Kenworthy just cancelled her appointment<eos> When does she want to reschedule?<eos> She doesn't.
You plant beans, you get beans.<eos> Carrots become carrots.<eos> Set out to make something grow, and it does.<eos> You wanted a clinic of your own.<eos> Deep down, you probably always did.
I don't want to.<eos> What you do, what you don't do, it's not my place to judge my own son.<eos> My place is to love you.<eos> Just that.<eos> And I do.
It may be the only fun of the night.<eos> Bill certainly has had a lot to drink tonight.<eos> I think Bill may have lost his mind.<eos> Yes.<eos> I do, too.
It was great seeing you.<eos> Really.<eos> You don't think I drove six and a half hours to discuss Marilyn Monroe's nose job, do you?<eos> I don't know if you heard, but after all my years of bachelorhood debauchery, I finally settled down.<eos> I did.
So, Ulysses is a dildo?<eos> What did you think? Our female subjects were having intercourse with a Greek leader in the Trojan War?<eos> CBS doesn't like dildos.<eos> CBS doesn't have to use a dildo.<eos> But Dr Masters and Mrs Johnson's participants did.

It's like you're hoping to discover underneath it all, I'm really just a dilettante.<eos> A militant?<eos> A dilettante.<eos> You don't know what a dilettante is?<eos> I don't.
I'd be dead if it weren't for you.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Kira, you must know something about Anton.<eos> That's why they tried to kill you.<eos> I don't.
I didn't know I was working with an illegal.<eos> The irony.<eos> Well, sometimes we do center pivot, but mainly we do lineal like you see out there.<eos> What is it your business does again?<eos> Something to do with algebra?
Dude! Dude, hey. I owe you a big apology, man.<eos> I had no idea who you were before and I read all this coverage about your company online, and I was like, "Hey, Pied Piper!<eos> I met this dude!<eos> He came into the store and told me my parking app was fucking awesome!"<eos> I did?
- I set my alarm for 6:00 AM.<eos> Excuse is the refuge of the moral coward.<eos> Dude, I got three hours of sleep.<eos> I was up all night studying for econ.<eos> So did every other jerk on morning shift.
It just is.<eos> I don't think Kelly would agree.<eos> She doesn't know.<eos> I never told her.<eos> You didn't?
Patterson grilled the guys.<eos> Yeah, me, too.<eos> Everyone at TM and the hospital.<eos> I don't think they have any suspects.<eos> They don't.
It's not just anyone but Na Young Unni!<eos> The Prime Minister has to know about this.<eos> I have to tell him.<eos> Even though Ms. Park Na Young doesn't want that?<eos> - Na Young Unni doesn't?
Just give me two days, and then I'll explain everything.<eos> I can't.<eos> I can't leave Arliss.<eos> You don't owe him your life, Lee Anne.<eos> You don't.
I really like you, Rico, but I'm just not ready.<eos> Yeah, o... okay.<eos> It's okay.<eos> I mean, I don't want to have sex with you.<eos> You don't?
Yes.<eos> (Chuckles) Oh, I've seen "Star Wars" like 100 times, but every time is like the first time.<eos> (Stammers) I mean, you know what I mean.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I do.
But then you and I got together, and everyone else fell away.<eos> You weren't my last choice, Marty.<eos> You were my best choice.<eos> You won, Marty.<eos> We both did.
Demons have been known to speak backwards.<eos> Just to up the creep factor.<eos> Isolating the audio...<eos> Let's see if this works.<eos> Indeed it does.
I just... ..I just didn't want to talk about this in there.<eos> I can bless your mom with oils.<eos> An exorcism is really in the realm of science fiction, Sarah. I...<eos> I used to think that.<eos> - I still do maybe, but...
Not for money.<eos> Because I wanted to be with someone who thought I was worth fighting for.<eos> (Chuckles) I think you've always wanted to be with a completely different kind of woman.<eos> And I hope someday you find her, Roy.<eos> I really do.
That we knew of.<eos> "Smoking a coke-laced bowl of weed is the best high ever"?<eos> Amateurs.<eos> Wasn't she afraid he'd find out?<eos> He did.
Why do you think we stole your money?<eos> Because you knew where I hid it.<eos> - Where?<eos> - In the damn keg!<eos> Ooh. We do now.
Why would you want to do that?<eos> Why wouldn't I do that?<eos> Because you'll get convicted.<eos> - You don't know that.<eos> - Yes, I do.
All right, come in.<eos> What do you want to chat about?<eos> The weather?<eos> How I slept last night?<eos> 'Cause I didn't.
And I felt this calm.<eos> There was nothing of Jimmy in you.<eos> You were from me and no one else.<eos> And we were happy.<eos> Then why did you, um...
Oh, my God.<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> Calm down.<eos> You saw that.<eos> Yes, I did.
Blake, go to the gas station crime scene, and as soon as we can find Sita Patel,<eos> Reid and I will talk to her, see if she interacted with the unsub.<eos> I was walking to work.<eos> The boy grabbed my handbag, and then when I tried to hold on, he yanked hard, and I fell. Did anyone else see the attack.<eos> Many people. But they did nothing.
You found her?<eos> Did you find Daisy, too?<eos> Her real name is Sheila.<eos> Sheila Woods.<eos> And, yes, we did.
How many of them live near a grocery store?<eos> Define near.<eos> Uh, within a mile.<eos> Well, there are 163 grocery stores in the greater St. Louis area.<eos> Two of them do.
I mean, you must have known this.<eos> No, that was too late.<eos> There was zero benefit from me coming forward at that point...<eos> You killed four billion people.<eos> - I didn't...
I'm so sorry, Kenny.<eos> I don't know what to say.<eos> I don't even know how to feel.<eos> I don't know what to do.<eos> Yes you do.
That's the problem!<eos> You can't fight him.<eos> Confrontation is standing up, looking something in the eye and being honest.<eos> - I don't know how to do that.<eos> - Yes you do.
So you work for Holland Knox?<eos> Yes.<eos> I used to work for his predecessor Wes Tarkington.<eos> Jamie: And when you worked for deputy chief Tarkington, did you ever see a copy of a statement of complaint submitted by my client Lee Anne Marcus?<eos> Yes, I did.
I haven't been myself since I've been pregnant.<eos> I wouldn't trust my instincts if I were you.<eos> I trust mine, and I think there's something here.<eos> Did you know Nena Pascal was pregnant?<eos> No, you didn't.
It is an old building with old rooms.<eos> There's nothing secret about that.<eos> Don't use that tone with me.<eos> I know what they want, Guy.<eos> I finally do.
Honey...<eos> You're not gonna give up, are you?<eos> She was meant for us.<eos> You really love her.<eos> I do. I do.
'Cause they are possible, Guy.<eos> All of them.<eos> And you deserve it, don't you?<eos> I really do.<eos> You really do.
You just... you went a little nuts last night.<eos> That's all.<eos> By the way, I like the new you.<eos> I thought you liked the old me.<eos> Well, I did.
Okay, fine, then we will develop my pictures first like the plan that we had, and then you can do yours.<eos> All right, Max, listen.<eos> We're not developing your pictures today, okay?<eos> So great, so you're a liar!<eos> - Did you--
Did you see... 33... 34... 35... 36... 37... 38... 39... 40.<eos> No signal.<eos> Mother!<eos> Do you forgive him or not?<eos> I don't.
You don't have to worry, miss Nunez.<eos> Detective Benson is not in the court today.<eos> You can tell the jury the truth.<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, she did.
I froze.<eos> An experienced detective didn't hear me come in, didn't see any signs of forced entry.<eos> She just froze.<eos> So you're telling me that you didn't invite me in, but clearly, you react differently to me than you do to hundreds of other men that you've...<eos> - No, no, I don't.
Some are men who want to know what I'm wearing, but, you know, I'm trying to figure a way to block all of the pervs.<eos> So, yeah. I guess that is my plan.<eos> It's amazing.<eos> We are so proud of you.<eos> Don't even, guys.
I'm gonna miss you, Vincent.<eos> I'm gonna miss you, too.<eos> I love you.<eos> I love you, too, Jay Bird.<eos> I really, really do.
Asked and answered-- she has made her statement twice.<eos> Why are you harassing her?<eos> Because my job is to make sure that everybody is telling the truth, and she is not!<eos> You don't know that.<eos> The hell I don't!
This from my fellow body snatcher?<eos> No, I was trying to save Vincent, apparently because Cat shot him.<eos> He didn't give her much of a choice.<eos> You don't know that.<eos> Yes, I do, and so do you.
Come check this out.<eos> This is surveillance from that security camera at the entrance of the roller coaster repair yard.<eos> Ted enters alone at 8:47 P.M.<eos> Did anyone enter prior to that?<eos> No. But about 15 minutes later at 9:04 P.M., someone does.
The hell you are!<eos> Can I finish?<eos> Can I finish?<eos> Since Ramón gave his word that you people wouldn't bring any guns...<eos> Hey, we didn't, not even my underwear gun.
- Oh, for...<eos> You dated<eos> - Burt Reynolds!<eos> - They don't have the coke, lickbag!<eos> - We do! Right here in the Trans Am! - Oh.
- pretty good plan, y'all.<eos> - No, it isn't!<eos> We might as well slather ourselves with whatever it is<eos> - crocodiles eat, and swim down!<eos> - What do crocodiles
- It cannot possibly.<eos> - Gospel of Luke?<eos> - Hey. - Oh for... Ray, you used to be a preacher, you want to back me up here?<eos> I actually don't know.<eos> My church didn't really do the
Alicia, if I had known what Jim Moody was up to, why would I have asked you to disqualify those ballots?<eos> You didn't ask me.<eos> Eli did.<eos> Because he didn't know anything about what Moody was up to.<eos> And neither did I.
My report is inconclusive until I have the governor's full and unconditional cooperation.<eos> You're throwing this into the laps of the Feds?<eos> No.<eos> But it might end up in the laps of the Feds because you don't trust me.<eos> He did nothing wrong.
Well, this guy is never gonna believe it.<eos> You know you've been photographed with known associates of Los Sangres, right?<eos> I get my picture taken with a lot of people I don't know.<eos> When did you put the money in the ceiling, JJ?<eos> I didn't...
He saw Alphonse in the locking room alone looking suspicious.<eos> - Well, let's go talk to him.<eos> - What about Becker?<eos> We can't tell him we're working off one of my reads.<eos> So we don't.
That sounds good.<eos> Hello?<eos> Who?<eos> The nomadic company?<eos> I don't even...
We're not moving to Italy.<eos> We have a baby.<eos> It makes sense to stay here.<eos> Even I know that.<eos> You do?
Calm down. Calm down!<eos> - Get the fuck my glasses!<eos> - Dion!<eos> Hey, hey, hey, hey! Do the breathing! Do the breathing.<eos> Do the breathing.
- We had some good times. E*xcept for the time when I accidentally fucked her mom.<eos> That was unfortunate.<eos> She told me about that.<eos> She also said you give really great head.<eos> - She did?
Am I right?<eos> I can tell this guy knows his way around the rodeo.<eos> Well, if by rodeo, you mean sex...<eos> [Chuckles] Um, uh, no, unfortunately.<eos> Uh, I don't.
It's the headache.<eos> People get them all the time.<eos> Right.<eos> Yeah.<eos> - Um, I actually do in my purse.
My brother was going through a rough time, obviously, the last six months.<eos> He was angry at the world 'cause he was sick.<eos> [Sighs] Angry at me 'cause I didn't do enough to help.<eos> But I tried.<eos> I really did.
She's on to us.<eos> Abort.<eos> I repeat, abort.<eos> I hate you.<eos> You don't.
Diane, certainly.<eos> But also Catherine.<eos> What better way to warn you of Nostradamus's visions, than by fulfilling his latest prophecy?<eos> That one among us would die?<eos> And one of us did.
There's some things I got to do.<eos> Don't you give me the "soldier going off to war" speech.<eos> I seen that look as soon as you walked in... the killer look.<eos> The Yukon got you.<eos> Didn't it, Haskell?
I know John had a gift for telling a good tale. Seducing his listener.<eos> But the truth is, his story was going nowhere.<eos> He was frustrated.<eos> So you think it was an accident?<eos> I do.
Now we got an entire network meeting and you're gonna go deal with some bullshit at the club?<eos> They're shutting the club down, Tommy!<eos> We wash more money up in there than we do at every other front we got combined.<eos> You want me to just fuck this off?<eos> - Hell, yeah, I do.
Norman.<eos> Norman.<eos> Then why didn't she close the door?<eos> Because. Because she knows you're watching her.<eos> - She does not.
Norman.<eos> Then why didn't she close the door?<eos> Because. Because she knows you're watching her.<eos> - She does not.<eos> - Of course she does.
What happened?<eos> On a tip, we located the bomb components in a locker at Penn Station.<eos> That tip was provided by one of my officers in the International Liaison Program.<eos> FBI didn't have the intel, or Interpol, or the CIA.<eos> Only we did.
There's someone else who wants to thank you, too, right over there.<eos> Daddy?<eos> Daddy?<eos> Allie.<eos> Did they...?
Well, maybe you ought to.<eos> Pop, I'm not going back to the last century where the top spots went to the guys with hooks.<eos> Nobody's asking you to.<eos> And by the way, it worked just fine.<eos> No, Pop... it didn't.
Thanks for coming by, Officer.<eos> Thank you, sir.<eos> I'm sorry. We both know you're dreaming.<eos> I don't think the judge will agree with you.<eos> I do, and....
Well, I was hoping that... tonight could maybe be one of those.<eos> Right. The Nicky question.<eos> Uh-huh. You really think we should be telling her about... whatever it is we've been doing?<eos> Only if we want to keep doing it.<eos> And you do?
Right. The Nicky question.<eos> Uh-huh. You really think we should be telling her about... whatever it is we've been doing?<eos> Only if we want to keep doing it.<eos> And you do?<eos> Yeah, I do.
You're still here? Tour ended hours ago.<eos> I wanted to watch you march Warner in.<eos> That didn't happen.<eos> Maya jerk you around again?<eos> No, nothing to do with her.
What do you mean, it's going with you? You know the terms of our clinical trial...<eos> Any implant removed from participants becomes the sole property of Sabian Medical Devices.<eos> What, is that the only reason that you wanted to conduct the autopsy... just to get your prosthesis?<eos> (sighs) If there is a design flaw here, I want to know about it, and I want to get it fixed.<eos> - Yeah, we all do.
Ah, I've never been to an outdoor sex club.<eos> Oh, yeah, you know what?<eos> Speaking of romantic, intimate getaways-- my mom.<eos> She wanted us to come grill tonight.<eos> - She did? - Mm-hmm.
What if we advertise?<eos> Put an ad in Craigslist or one of those free local business things?<eos> Hey, yeah, we can get some meth heads to hand out flyers and shit.<eos> - And pay them how?<eos> - We don't.
Sometimes you get your heart broken.<eos> Sometimes nothing changes at all.<eos> But sometimes...<eos> Just sometimes...<eos> Everything does.
And I'm so gassy.<eos> There's just been, like, a long, slow fart stream coming out of me since we started talking... this morning.<eos> That really sucks.<eos> Yeah.<eos> It does. Thanks.
Yo, Sharee.<eos> Is that your mom?<eos> Mom, what are you doing here?<eos> You know damn well why I'm here.<eos> - No, I don't.
This won't take but a sec.<eos> Here, Dotty. Hold that till it dries.<eos> Rough morning.<eos> Won't happen again.<eos> But it did.
I watched her play volleyball, Frankie.<eos> Got her checked out at the emergency room.<eos> I'm just saying, you don't know where she works.<eos> You have no idea what J-P-la is.<eos> Nobody does.
What were those girls so afraid of?<eos> What happened in that cafeteria?<eos> I'd offer a theory, but I'm too busy having detention flashbacks.<eos> You must've spent a lot of time in this hallway.<eos> More than I did in class.
- Stop.<eos> Leave him alone.<eos> He's just trying to protect me.<eos> She even kind of looks like Carrie.<eos> No, she does not!
Did you track down whoever Madison was seeing?<eos> As far as I can tell, she wasn't seeing anybody.<eos> But these are her financials.<eos> - What kind of high-school kid has financials?<eos> - Madison does.
Yeah.<eos> You must think I'm a freak, huh?<eos> Uh... how did you do it?<eos> You wouldn't understand.<eos> Most people don't.
I keep thinking about the other night.<eos> It just felt so good to connect with you again.<eos> Arliss, baby...<eos> There's something you gotta know.<eos> Don't.
(brandon) whew! 'sup?<eos> Good workout.<eos> You know, it's weird I never worked out with you before.<eos> What'd you say your regular gym was?<eos> I didn't.
Say hello to leo sporm.<eos> A p.I.?<eos> These guys are hacks.<eos> How do you know if your husband's a murderer?<eos> You don't.
Daddy, Julia took my scrapbook.<eos> I didn't take it.<eos> She lost it.<eos> - Yes you did!<eos> - No I didn't.
He was trying to protect you.<eos> Tell me everything right now.<eos> I don't know everything.<eos> Just that he made it up, or he let you believe it.<eos> So he and Aida didn't...
That's why you were driving so fast.<eos> You were trying to get her to the hospital. So they could pump her stomach.<eos> I didn't want you and Scott to know.<eos> I didn't want you to ever know.<eos> No, of course you didn't.
With a bad mark.<eos> You only went after that guy 'cause big jim kicked dad out of houston.<eos> You made it personal, and that's why you blew it.<eos> No, I blew it because I didn't have the right boxman with me.<eos> Well, now you do.
And Kyle knows that. I'm disappointed in him.<eos> I am doing everything that I can to help you, Detective.<eos> As I told you that I would.<eos> Did you see the girl?<eos> One of my boys did.
Every time I've ever opened the door, the only thing I've gotten back from you is that disappointed, shitty look of yours.<eos> You don't know me.<eos> You have never known me.<eos> That's the problem.<eos> No one does.
Yeah, great.<eos> Well, why did I come all the way out here to meet you?<eos> Did you know that dad was in love with a woman before he met mom?<eos> Um...<eos> No, I didn't.
They were all on leave.<eos> And then this one guy... and he took me to one of those motels like you took me to.<eos> I'm so sorry. No, no, no.<eos> That's not...<eos> I didn't...
All right, I'll hang onto this till you return the key. No problem.<eos> Thank you, raymond.<eos> You're welcome, sir.<eos> The lab's not empty. It's supposed to be empty. Okay, calm down.<eos> What do we do?
Are you going to open this door, Carl, or don't you have a key?<eos> Of course I have the key, but we c... or maybe you don't have the cajones then?<eos> Maybe you should check.<eos> I thought you wanted to, uh...<eos> I do.
Where have you been?<eos> Where's Monty?<eos> - Monty's gone?<eos> - Clarke, we need to leave, now.<eos> All of us do.
It wasn't the jar that trapped it.<eos> It was where I buried it.<eos> The Nemeton.<eos> A place I don't know too much about.<eos> Who does?
The Nemeton.<eos> A place I don't know too much about.<eos> Who does?<eos> Deaton.<eos> Deaton does.
Sometimes it's better to...to put things in a box.<eos> I married a paranoid schizophrenic.<eos> And she caused a lot of trouble, as er...as delusional people will.<eos> She had a serious drink problem too and...<eos> I didn't...
Please forgive me, Munchkin.<eos> How did you er...find out?<eos> The police told me.<eos> Er...you've been talking to the police behind my back?<eos> They did the talking, Malcolm. Oh.
Gordon, let me ask you something.<eos> When is the last time you cut their toenails?<eos> Or which one of your daughters is allergic to apricots?<eos> Do you even know their pediatrician's name?<eos> No, you don't?
I have no idea.<eos> Hey.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Do you mind telling me what the fuck is going on?<eos> Actually, yeah, I do.
Things would go a lot faster if the two of you Did less experimenting and more working.<eos> And I'm not the only one who thinks that.<eos> You melted my fringe.<eos> You think I have an anger problem?<eos> I don't.
Oh, come on. Don't go all pete on me.<eos> We each have to do this.<eos> - No, I'm not, it's just...<eos> What if I don't have a defining warehouse moment?<eos> Of course you do, pookie.
I'm not walking out on you.<eos> But we can't get married just because you're screwed up about your dad.<eos> Don't use him as an excuse for cold feet.<eos> If you don't want to get married, just say so.<eos> I don't!
North Evil... is starting to suspect me.<eos> I have to move fast... to quickly rescue them.<eos> Why not find a chance to kill Lui directly?<eos> No.<eos> If we do,
No need.<eos> Hear me out.<eos> Don't be like this.<eos> I don't want your explanations!<eos> Don't do this.
Bye. - Bye.<eos> See you.<eos> - Um, I'd like to buy this, please.<eos> - Sure. Also, do you have it in a seven?<eos> - We do.
The graves of Asgard's enemies are littered with men who underestimated Sif.<eos> Do not make the same mistake.<eos> You do not know her.<eos> No.<eos> I don't.
- What's your name?<eos> - Rita.<eos> Nice to meet you.<eos> Noemia, did you know that Severino was suing us?<eos> No, I didn't.
Let go of me!<eos> - Let go of me, you madman.<eos> - You punk. - Stop it!<eos> - Let go of me!<eos> We don't do this in this house!
You should've came with us.<eos> It's a little late for that, I think.<eos> But it's not too late for Bo.<eos> I know you care about her.<eos> Okay, we all do.
Yeah.<eos> I'll drive you, you can Uber back.<eos> I didn't even say we were going.<eos> Yeah, I know you didn't.<eos> I did. Huh?
How do I know I can trust you?<eos> What's up?<eos> Um, what's up is you haven't been in school in a week.<eos> Told you, I'm sick.<eos> You did.
We've only been dating for three years.<eos> If we were to share a room, people might talk.<eos> I got you your own room.<eos> What if my room has a claw-foot bathtub?<eos> It doesn't.
Okay? Okay.<eos> Okay, thank you.<eos> Oh, if she's scared, you can sing to her.<eos> She likes Katy Perry.<eos> Oh, but don't do "Firework""
Warner...<eos> Warner, will you stop wiggling?<eos> That's just what your mother used to do, up all night with her stomach pills and her heart pills.<eos> She had a cute angina.<eos> Yeah, she sure did.
May I say goodbye first?<eos> Indeed.<eos> You ready, brother?<eos> If you think it's for the best.<eos> I do.
He wanted to make sure you played.<eos> But what happened between us, that was real.<eos> Oh, shut the fuck up.<eos> If you don't wanna believe me, that's fine.<eos> I don't.
Yeah, I've done it lots of times before.<eos> You're cute.<eos> Black or camo?<eos> Did you not get your last check?<eos> No, I did.
Relax.<eos> She's fine.<eos> She could've died, Tess.<eos> On my watch.<eos> But she didn't.
Since he was a young prince, servants tried to kill him.<eos> They poisoned his food and carried knives. I've heard of over 12 attempts at his life.<eos> Still!<eos> You! He trusted only you!<eos> I did, too.
I know that sounds bad, but for a politician it's pretty much the best-case scenario.<eos> Well, you guys might as well be a pile of leaves because you're about to get blown away.<eos> I have booked a meeting with none other than Grant Larson.<eos> - No one knows who that is?<eos> - Um, I do.
What's "slap-a-dope"?<eos> Ohh!<eos> You still got it.<eos> [ Laughs ] I can't believe the dope fell for it.<eos> - Job well done.
Stop. I don't-<eos> - Ugh.<eos> I don't understand why you're so upset.<eos> I mean, yes, my dad can be a handful, but you still wanted him to move in with us.<eos> No! I didn't!
I should have talked to you more before asking dad to move in with us.<eos> I just-- I got so excited at the fact that you said it was an option that I started to really believe that's what you wanted.<eos> I was being selfish.<eos> I do want him to move in with us.<eos> No, you don't.
What can I say? I thought my role as husband was to provide... ..give my wife everything her heart desired.<eos> It turns out that what she desired was some jumped-up gigolo.<eos> Do you know they were actually planning to run away together?<eos> Must have made you very angry.<eos> Yeah, yeah, it did.
I owe my life to a man, Duch, who executed thousands of others.<eos> My savior is a torturer.<eos> A murderer.<eos> I've no idea if he feels remorse.<eos> I do.
Good. I think I found a space under the dungeon.<eos> It could have some more clues.<eos> I was hoping you could check it out.<eos> And you two will be...?<eos> Doing our day jobs for a change.
I can't be with her, JT.<eos> Ugh, what is wrong with people?<eos> You should just wear black on Valentine's Day.<eos> I don't deserve her, man.<eos> Yes, you do.
I got another one here from 2013, Scottsdale, Maryland.<eos> He was smart enough to cross state lines.<eos> The Crestview rapist was operating during that time.<eos> The male unsub never went dormant.<eos> Only the female did.
That doesn't make sense, so I'm not going to do it.<eos> Your hair doesn't make sense.<eos> Get out of my fucking area!<eos> Do you want a fucking go about this?<eos> Yeah, I do!
I think that you win.<eos> You know what, tell me this:<eos> why would someone want a gem that controls beasts unless they already have, or they're creating, ones exactly like Tori and me?<eos> You have to get it back.<eos> No. We do.
Okay, you know what?<eos> I'm in.<eos> - Great.<eos> - What kind of beer does Berkley like?<eos> - He doesn't.
Sounds fantastic.<eos> Did you hear that?<eos> His husband invited us, not him.<eos> He so doesn't want us there.<eos> Yes, he does.
- Why would you close M.E.N.D.?<eos> Because I want you to know how sorry I am.<eos> - And I want to make restitution somehow.<eos> - Wait, wait, closing clinics that are saving desperate mothers and ... and children?<eos> I-I don't ...
You know, just wanted to see what you do.<eos> Always wondered how candles got made.<eos> Well... now you know.<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, I do.
You were starting to freak me out with all your cake-tasting and seating charts.<eos> So, we're good?<eos> Same old us?<eos> Do you promise to stop measuring me in my sleep?<eos> I do.
No, I mean make it a fair fight - ocean floor, but the bear gets scuba gear.<eos> - Interesting.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Hey, how did your date with Kelly go?<eos> Did you finally...
That's my fault, I shouldn't have given her apricots.<eos> Will, it's nothing to be ashamed of.<eos> I know what it's like to get blown off by women.<eos> Poker chip.<eos> No, I don't.
That people love what you can give them, and a queen... what's the use of might-have-beens?<eos> It's too late.<eos> Those two naive children are dead now.<eos> We killed them.<eos> Did we?
Ok.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I was... really trying to help.<eos> Well, at least no one knows.<eos> - Ana does.
I'm really sorry.<eos> For everything.<eos> - Didn't think...<eos> - No.<eos> No, you didn't.
- In Arizona.<eos> - That sucks.<eos> - It's ok.<eos> - I just want him to be safe.<eos> - Yeah, of course you do.
The truth now.<eos> I did not...<eos> Although I came very close once.<eos> But you know how it feels to want to spend the days of your life with someone that you cherish?<eos> I do.
I believe he's a better man than you take him for and stronger.<eos> Well, I believe he's had more than his equitable share of sacrificing himself in the name of someone else's welfare.<eos> Then to be clear, what are you saying?<eos> I have to lay it out?<eos> Yes, you do.
Left me alone and unwanted.<eos> There's suffering all around us.<eos> Why not take some pleasure from it?<eos> I don't know how to get pleasure from suffering.<eos> Yes, you do.
If you untie me now, I won't tell anybody what's happened.<eos> Please Peter.<eos> Please Peter, would you talk to me?<eos> I miss what we had.<eos> I do.
At the end, his doctors were trying all sorts of different treatment avenues.<eos> How long have you been dealing?<eos> We found the DNA profile of the girls who died on the backup log of your ChemPrinter... along with every customer you ever printed a pill for.<eos> Bet you didn't know it had that feature.<eos> So when did you...
Aaron's cries can't hurt anyone anymore.<eos> This is the longest The Troubles have ever been in Haven.<eos> What if it stays this way forever?<eos> We'll cope.<eos> Haven always does.
Good job, buddy.<eos> Hey, I see you told them the good news about the LCD screen.<eos> Yeah, everyone's excited.<eos> Good, I thought maybe you didn't get my message.<eos> No, I did.
Wish me luck.<eos> Weren't you going to tell me?<eos> Of course I was.<eos> I just, um...<eos> I didn't, because...
He wants kids.<eos> Ain't that what you want?<eos> When you and I were together...<eos> - ...children was something that we- - I do love him, Bill.<eos> I really do.
Wade, honey, if you're here, come on out.<eos> With your hands up where I can see them.<eos> You don't have to be so dramatic.<eos> - They didn't break any law.<eos> - Like hell, they didn't.
- Okay.<eos> So...<eos> -...should I use this on you?<eos> - Uh... How much does it say to use? Um...<eos> It doesn't.
Hold it together, Noomi.<eos> You are one with the universe.<eos> Keep it together.<eos> You know how on the news you see these... These places get wiped out by tornados but the people who live there are always vowing to rebuild on the exact same spot where tragedy took away everything they had?<eos> I do.
I had one for breakfast, one for lunch, and then a sensible dinner.<eos> You know what, I'm gonna do something that I don't normally do.<eos> I'm gonna take off my sunglasses and I'm gonna really listen.<eos> This sauce of yours, does it have a story?<eos> It actually does.
I'm... I'm sorry.<eos> I never should have had a guest over here without asking your permission.<eos> She actually just came over to give me something.<eos> Oh, I know what she gave you.<eos> - You do?
- Let me out.<eos> I have to go now!<eos> - Ow! - Come on. - Trevor, get up.<eos> - But he hurt me.<eos> - No, he didn't.
The Metas were never going to let us out of this deal.<eos> After our last payment, they were going to kill us all.<eos> Salazar is going to have to report back to his bosses.<eos> When he doesn't, they'll come looking for him.<eos> And when they do?
You did.<eos> Rumor on the streets is, you're still angry you didn't get the Fishscale rights from the Metas, so you took out your anger on my supplier.<eos> Are you still upset that we wouldn't move your product?<eos> How do I know you're not setting me up?<eos> You don't.
They put me in this damn chair.<eos> I understand how you feel, Carlos, but...<eos> No!<eos> No, man.<eos> You don't.
So is Lavar Quintel.<eos> What have you always told us?<eos> _ _<eos> We don't have anything to offer Lavar Quintel.<eos> Yes, we do.
I was six years old, alone.<eos> Javier was the only one who loved me.<eos> He told me he was doing it for all the right reasons: to get the family out of crime, to go legitimate.<eos> And you believed that?<eos> I still do.
See, my father made a deal with them.<eos> They've taken over his operations, and soon they won't be satisfied with just Peacock Hill.<eos> They'll be looking to expand, which means sooner or later, they will come after you, Lavar, and you will need me as much as I need you.<eos> You want me to clean up your daddy's mess.<eos> No, no, no, no. I do not.
My lies can be very helpful when they serve your purposes.<eos> Won't be mayor if I'm behind bars like you.<eos> Calm down.<eos> No one knows about us.<eos> Does Lopez?
It's too late.<eos> She must know you're here.<eos> Now, you've already gone through labor once, so at least you know what to expect.<eos> Oh, yes.<eos> We both do.
I think it's best to just get these anxieties out in the open.<eos> Feelings, especially those we keep bottled up, can affect a pregnancy just as much as diet and exercise.<eos> Look, I suppose what I'm trying to say is that... If you've got any fears at all about any of this, it's best to just get it out<eos> - into the open.<eos> - I don't.
- It's what happens when a spirit...<eos> - I don't need to know the lingo. - I just need you to get rid of it.<eos> - Well, it's not that simple.<eos> - Why did you say it was?<eos> - I didn't.
Came here to the mother ship five years ago.<eos> He had been on the commodities desk ever since.<eos> Did he have any enemies at the company?<eos> I guess.<eos> We all do.
- We'll lose the deposit.<eos> - Aw, the hell with the deposit.<eos> What?<eos> I-I thought you wanted to get married, babe.<eos> I do, it...
- How was the flight?<eos> - Bumpy.<eos> Got to admit, you're the last person I expected to see here.<eos> - I assume you got my cable.<eos> - I did.
The reason we couldn't find her is because she hasn't used her maiden name in over 20 years.<eos> So Guy Ingram and Burns' wife were gonna run away together.<eos> Burns must've found out and made sure that didn't happen.<eos> All right, how do we get to Sally Ann?<eos> We don't.
I saw you get baptized at Hand of God four days ago.<eos> You opened my eyes to what it means to be saved, and now I see you're a modern day Solomon.<eos> So whatever decision you make here today, I'm good with it.<eos> Uh, Mr. Dennison, uh...<eos> Did you, uh...
Well, perhaps she left a trail.<eos> I was hoping the same thing.<eos> Well, then you've got yourself a partner.<eos> I don't remember asking for one.<eos> You didn't.
Maybe.<eos> Come by.<eos> Find out.<eos> He doesn't deserve to go out like this.<eos> No one does.
No, no, look, it's fine.<eos> I'll head over by myself.<eos> I'll be back in a couple hours.<eos> What, you don't want me to go?<eos> Probably best if you don't, tough guy.
Oh, you have freakishly strong fingers.<eos> Hey! Knock it off.<eos> I'm serious.<eos> - God, please don't-- - Ow!<eos> Don't you--
Did you know there'd be alcohol?<eos> Yes, I knew there'd be alcohol, so I rushed her right over.<eos> But first, we stopped at my dealer's house and did some pot.<eos> I'm just saying-- she's getting to the age where you got to keep your eye on these things.<eos> Oh, I do?
You think I'm in the tank for Kemp?<eos> How dare you?<eos> I write for the working stiff, the guy that takes the 7 train, the guy who worries whether his kid needs a new pair of shoes or not.<eos> Okay, Jimmy, I understand.<eos> No, you don't.
Whoa!<eos> Who's this little dumpling?<eos> Only my niece.<eos> If there's one thing she loves, it's piggy-back.<eos> No, I don't.
Family isn't about whose womb you come from or whose blood type you share.<eos> It's, um...<eos> You remember when your mom and I went out and left Ben in charge for the first time?<eos> And you guys had that huge fight and you kicked a hole in the bedroom door.<eos> I didn't...
I had the perfect chance 'to throw a pint of sex in his face, and I blew it. '<eos> All right, fatty?<eos> Er, where have you two been?<eos> We've just been out having fun, like young couples do, you know.<eos> No, I don't.
Syd. Here's that rainbow loom you have at home.<eos> I thought we could, uh, you know, go rainbow... Bracelet crazy this weekend.<eos> I don't play with that anymore.<eos> I'm ten now.<eos> You don't?
- Okay.<eos> Well, anyway, I like it.<eos> All right.<eos> I think that's the cover.<eos> I do too.
huh?<eos> I know it sounds crazy.<eos> I'm sure I'll never have this chance again.<eos> But I was getting ready, and I looked in the bathroom mirror, and you know that sticker I have?<eos> Yeah, yeah, I do.
So, then, when did you go to the hotel and meet Justin?<eos> I don't remember.<eos> Anita, we have a witness that saw you accost Justin outside of a coffee shop a couple of days ago.<eos> - Do you remember that?<eos> - Yes, I do.
- Come here, little boy.<eos> - Don't!<eos> Please.<eos> I don't want to.<eos> I really don't.
- Feel?<eos> Yes, I can.<eos> Just not fully.<eos> It's difficult to explain.<eos> Then don't.
Last time, all it took was me believing in magic and kissing Henry.<eos> Since I've been back, I've done both and nothing.<eos> It's the belief.<eos> Henry... he needs to believe.<eos> In this new life... he doesn't.
- What do you mean?<eos> He was going through a rough time.<eos> He was realizing he had been given up.<eos> He didn't feel like he had a real family.<eos> He did.
Last night?<eos> I just... I don't really think you needed to lay those guys out, you know?<eos> Hildy, those guys were assholes, okay?<eos> They were looking for a fight, and I didn't... I didn't... I didn't have a choice.<eos> Yeah, you did.
Do something for me today, your daughter walks out of here.<eos> Why should I believe you this time?<eos> The only thing you need to believe is that there was a dead boy in a barn, and a mother who put him there.<eos> I know who you are, Francis.<eos> We all do.
I welcome the opportunity, Mr. Chairman.<eos> I welcome the opportunity, Mr. Chairman.<eos> Please raise your right hand.<eos> Do you swear that the testimony you give before this Senate committee today will be the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth?<eos> I do.
Get the light out of my face, man.<eos> In a couple of hours, you'll come down off of whatever shit you took, but in the meantime, you need to follow my instructions.<eos> Now bend forward and expose your buttocks.<eos> I didn't take nothing.<eos> I don't do drugs.
Guy's got brass ones...<eos> I'll give him that.<eos> He's barely even changing the name.<eos> I know, and the system's so big, no one ever caught it.<eos> Linda did.
It's not here.<eos> He drove it last night.<eos> Now, your brother's friend, was he a Lausenschlange too?<eos> - I don't know what you mean.<eos> - Yeah, you do.
Advanced computer probability...<eos> Hold on, wait.<eos> Wait.<eos> - What's wrong?<eos> - Where did you...
Debbie!<eos> - Any luck?<eos> - Not yet!<eos> Uh, yes, I'm looking for a Cabbage Patch Kid.<eos> You do?
Oh, thank you so much.<eos> And do you happen to know what area of the bowling alley I can find a good dentist in?<eos> That was such a fun night, Marty.<eos> Did you see my lasso dance every time I knocked down a pin?<eos> Yeah, I sure did.
_<eos> Hey, look.<eos> Come on.<eos> Got it.<eos> Hey. What you doing here, loser?
It's a date.<eos> All right, great. Hey, min.<eos> You got a sec?<eos> I got some pretty hot gossip.<eos> I don't, Danny.
First things first.<eos> Uh, can anybody think of anybody who may wish Bertie harm?<eos> No.<eos> Bertie doesn't have an enemy in the world.<eos> No, but I do.
You didn't want to remember.<eos> No, Lev.<eos> I died eight years ago after I opened my veins and I left you holding all that guilt.<eos> Say you forgive me.<eos> I do.
Irzu won't let me die.<eos> Would you stop that?<eos> This thing inside you, it doesn't come from Irzu or any other kind of god.<eos> How do you know?<eos> Because I do, okay?
It's lucky he didn't break his skull.<eos> - He called you a name.<eos> -That's no excuse for you to...<eos> He's the guy! He's the guy that killed that little boy!<eos> He did not!
You may not know anything about the law, but we do know someone who does.<eos> Well, unfortunately the deposed is indisposed and won't be re-disposed until an undisclosed time.<eos> So in other words, I'm gonna be a while. - Oh!<eos> - It's all right. I've got you.<eos> Yes. Yes, you do.
Really?<eos> you... you need to say something.<eos> Oh my God, no. I could never.<eos> I mean, what if he doesn't like me back?<eos> Oh, he does.
I fight in the war to which your father gave his life.<eos> Which is why, though it pains me to say, we cannot trust my son with your cure.<eos> You love your son?<eos> In spite of everything, yes.<eos> I do.
I don't even know what we're doing here.<eos> I got 19 episodes of Chicago Fire burning up my DVR.<eos> We all done crying in our soup?<eos> Oh, come on, Lavon, you got to admit, things are looking mighty bleak.<eos> No. No, I don't.
Okay, good enough for me.<eos> I love y'all, but everybody out!<eos> Oh. Now!<eos> You know I love you.<eos> I do. I... Mm.
No, trust me, there are no animals in this restaurant.<eos> You're gonna get it now.<eos> Stop it!<eos> Get away!<eos> Don't do it!
This is nonsense!<eos> Darius talked to you?<eos> What did he say?<eos> Well, he made me promise to take you to Africa. - He said that?<eos> Yeah, he did.
I'm sure Karl will be very happy to take over.<eos> Stop making excuses! If my father wanted Karl to lead us, he would have said so. But he asked you.<eos> He must've had a good reason.<eos> I really can't think of one.<eos> Plus, he didn't really...
And you guys are all moving on, and...<eos> - No, I'm not...<eos> - Yes, you are!<eos> And I don't have a life to move on to.<eos> I don't.
- Hi, Lana.<eos> - Hey, is Danny okay?<eos> - What do you mean?<eos> - He didn't come in this morning.<eos> Yeah, he did.
How?<eos> We're not sure.<eos> He was found lying on the beach early this morning.<eos> Does his mom and dad know?<eos> Yeah, they do.
I'm relying on you to catch them.<eos> I promise you, Beth.<eos> I promise.<eos> He did know, didn't he, that I love him?<eos> Of course he did.
I meant I'm not gonna leave my mom and I'm not trying to go 50k in debt by the time I'm 21.<eos> What if you could get a scholarship for field hockey?<eos> They have those?<eos> (Scoffs) They have scholarships for kids who speak Klingon,<eos> - so yeah, they do.
She has so much raw talent.<eos> I just really want her to get the chance she deserves.<eos> - You know?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Yeah, I do.
You tried something!<eos> Unless you want to climb back on that safe little boat<eos> - I found you on.<eos> - No.<eos> I don't.
He gets to take an extra bag because of his wheelchair.<eos> Okay, can you stop for a second?<eos> Why don't you want me to chaperone?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I just don't.
- Well...<eos> - You know, I-I try to--<eos> I try to step in where I can, but it's--it's gotten bad.<eos> I think that next year is gonna be much better.<eos> I really do.
Like you don't know what I'm talking about.<eos> What's that on your wrist?<eos> It's faded ink.<eos> And of course I don't know what it means.<eos> But you did.
You never have.<eos> You say you want apples when you want oranges.<eos> You claim you want to sue me and pretend you want a pay day.<eos> I just want things to be fair.<eos> No you don't.
- If she really hit that screw<eos> - in county, she's harder than she looks.<eos> - My brother told me the real story.<eos> Guard was psycho.<eos> He did himself.
I don't mean just in here.<eos> Back in high school ... scheming to steal someone else's man, talking behind each other's backs.<eos> Girls grow up nipping and s-scratching and whupping each other's ass.<eos> It's no wonder when a man does it back... we think it's normal.<eos> Until we don't.
Ah, this sucks, dude.<eos> Oh!<eos> Look at this crew!<eos> Who knows what day it is?<eos> I do.
Obviously, you nailed it.<eos> Totally us.<eos> You get it?<eos> I didn't know if you'd get it.<eos> Of course I do.
She was really good.<eos> But you don't want to do it without her?<eos> - Is that it?<eos> - I... no, I didn't want to do it in the first place, so...<eos> Yeah, you didn't.
Yeah. It is.<eos> Since we're being... Intimate, let me ask, do you miss her?<eos> I mean, how often do you think about Claire?<eos> Good, because I miss her, Ryan.<eos> I really do.
They're primal, alphas.<eos> I gave you my reason for not making a move these past few months.<eos> What, pray tell, is theirs?<eos> They don't have the stake.<eos> Well, then who the hell does?
It's wasted now.<eos> You took out one of Steelgraves' crew earlier tonight.<eos> It was a set up so they could plant that thing on me.<eos> Oliver, I know what you're thinking.<eos> No, you don't.
And your husband will hate you for it.<eos> As soon as he learns how the world works, How it's always worked.<eos> Open the door, put him inside.<eos> His mother knows it.<eos> So did his father.
(Coughing)<eos> Well, there you are.<eos> - I see you got my message.<eos> - Yep!<eos> I did.
So I trust that you will keep my office in the loop if there are any... significant developments.<eos> Is that clear?<eos> Of course.<eos> Sir, I didn't... I didn't know you had a sister.<eos> Oh, well, now you do.
It's not illegal to know.<eos> And I guarantee you you will never link me to that payment, so you'll never be able to prove witness tampering.<eos> But, yeah, I knew about the wire.<eos> And Peter wasn't wearing it when he was killed because he had already left it for the feds at the dead drop at Lafayette and Spring.<eos> How do you even...
What the hell are you guys still doing out here?<eos> Am I really the only one that reads the Regent's Addendums to the manual?<eos> Okay, look, we know that the shield draws its power from the Alpha Centauri Star System.<eos> - I knew that.<eos> - No, he didn't.
Am I really the only one that reads the Regent's Addendums to the manual?<eos> Okay, look, we know that the shield draws its power from the Alpha Centauri Star System.<eos> - I knew that.<eos> - No, he didn't.<eos> I did.
Go to hell.<eos> No matter where I go or what you do to me, I will always ...<eos> What did you do?<eos> - Wait. What just happened?<eos> - Did Ward just...
- I face a S.H.I.E.L.D. review board.<eos> Whatever the punishment, I'll take it.<eos> I deserve it.<eos> But I don't regret what I've done.<eos> - You don't?
When you told me to check into the psych evals, you said something.<eos> You said, "read his mind."<eos> And it got me thinking.<eos> And Ward said that the Clairvoyant knew how to push all the right buttons.<eos> Raina did that to me, too.
Mark.<eos> You son of a bitch.<eos> You played me.<eos> You think I'm an idiot...<eos> No. I don't, Mark.
It's a topsy-turvy world, Sister.<eos> And nothing more topsy-turvy than that cocky sort.<eos> Turning up in men's clothes.<eos> Neither fish nor flesh, if you ask me.<eos> But I didn't.
George, my boy, he can't talk.<eos> He was hit in the head.<eos> I don't think he sees me.<eos> Doesn't know I'm there.<eos> Of course he does.
You know, I still think you have a question for me.<eos> If you do, you need to ask it now.<eos> The Blighty convoy is here, Major.<eos> Sir, in your regiment... ..do you know of a Subedar Major Amar Singh?<eos> Yes, I do.
You do know that impeding a police investigation is a very serious offense.<eos> And you know that as a Fortune500 company, we have a full complement of lawyers that can back-up my truthful and helpful statement.<eos> But why go there. Liber8 is behind this robbery Mr. Richardson.<eos> You don't want them having anything of yours.<eos> And they don't.
Wha-- look, that's fine.<eos> Go ahead. Dress like one of the characters in the book and do a lame presentation like a million other kids.<eos> What do you want, Brick?<eos> Do you want to go the safe route, or do you want to be an innovator, a trailblazer, a rule breaker? !<eos> I do.
[ Chuckles ] And I don't know if you do or you don't, but if you don't and you want to go, I'm around, so I could take you if you want.<eos> Are you kidding me right now?<eos> ! No, uh, but if you don't want to --<eos> No. No, no, no, no, no.<eos> I do, I do, I do.
What's the best way to handle this?<eos> Handle what?<eos> The lottery winners.<eos> How do we tell them that they're not going home... that they're gonna be sequestered in a facility in South Carolina for the next two years and that their babies will be the property of the United States government?<eos> We don't.
- Hullbert.<eos> Hullbert, right.<eos> What a prick.<eos> I should have punched that son of a bitch in the face.<eos> You did.
Well, I told them I didn't have anything to do with this.<eos> I just got done clearing out Nathan's office.<eos> So you've been drinking.<eos> I thought you gave that up.<eos> - I did.
Yeah.<eos> It's special.<eos> Look at me!<eos> I... I lied.<eos> I did.
Grow up!<eos> Kieran, we're wrapped.<eos> For the day.<eos> Just wrap it.<eos> Wrap wrap wrap, done done done.
You and Mr. Gardner are lovers,<eos> - isn't that correct? - Excuse me.<eos> What does that have to do with anything?<eos> The relationship between two lawyers on Governor Florrick's legal team - bears a direct relationship to...<eos> - No. No, it does not.
- And like prison.<eos> - Well, I feel like if we get tired of each other, I can always run across the hall to my room. It's so close.<eos> Just pop over there.<eos> Mm. - Do you not want to? - Whoa.<eos> I did not...
You in the toy business?<eos> Inventor.<eos> You know the Finger Paddle?<eos> Oh, God, my kids used to play that game for hours.<eos> Some still do.
Yes, I did.<eos> Please, have a seat.<eos> When I heard about Michael Elliot's murder, I thought I should contact you.<eos> - How do you know him?<eos> - I don't.
We'll need access to his office computer and files.<eos> Absolutely.<eos> Will? Would you please call Jennifer?<eos> May I ask, do you have any suspects?<eos> We do.
I'm getting married.<eos> This is interesting. What?<eos> - Are you talking to me?<eos> - You said something.<eos> I did?
Go fuck yourself, "Jack and the Giant Freakstalk."<eos> Your team lost, and you should be fitted with a leper bell, you sinking shit.<eos> Yeah, okay.<eos> Boy, I do not know what I saw in you.<eos> I do.
- Thank you.<eos> Why didn't you tell me that wasn't David Fickler?<eos> - You didn't ask.<eos> - Hey, how did everything go?<eos> It didn't.
- What?<eos> - You just checked her out.<eos> - No, I didn't.<eos> - Yes, you did.<eos> - I didn't.
No.<eos> Truly dangerous.<eos> Not just to your reputation.<eos> I was warned many girls don't survive.<eos> You did.
- Well, why don't you take it up with the president?<eos> - Guys... - Kent: Why don't you call the Chief Justice<eos> - and get them both in?<eos> - And so it begins.<eos> Actually, it really does.
So what's the good news?<eos> Well, I thought that he may be working with a partner so, I kept looking.<eos> What I found was a secondary stream in the cash-flow, only this account path had a small flaw in the code and I was able to crack it.<eos> Do you have the account holder's name?<eos> I do.
Like the decor?<eos> Sorry, I knocked?<eos> I didn't want to answer.<eos> My husband just died, you know?<eos> But of course you do.
1:00 am.<eos> Don't you have a life?<eos> Do you know this guy?<eos> Commander Hugo?<eos> All the older guys do.
- It's, you know-- it's temporary until I figure out- yeah.<eos> It's great.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - Your kids are-- they like it?<eos> - Yeah, they do, they...
Listen, goose, I want--<eos> I want to talk to you about our selling the house.<eos> I just want you to understand my point of view, my feelings about it.<eos> I'm mom, I-I get it.<eos> I do.
Sorry about that.<eos> Put in your piggies.<eos> Put your piggies in. Look at this pretty girl.<eos> Did you mean it when you said to your mom that Jabbar's baptism was one of the greatest moments of your life?<eos> I did.
Put in your piggies.<eos> Put your piggies in. Look at this pretty girl.<eos> Did you mean it when you said to your mom that Jabbar's baptism was one of the greatest moments of your life?<eos> I did.<eos> - You did?
I wanted to --<eos> Everyone knows what I want to do --<eos> Then I remember the last drink that got me here 2 years, 1 month, 10 days ago.<eos> I don't even have to say it. But...<eos> And I didn't, and...
Jennings.<eos> There is grace and forgiveness for you.<eos> For everyone.<eos> Do you believe that?<eos> I do.
- Why?<eos> - To fix the air-conditioning.<eos> Honey, it's not broken.<eos> You just don't know how to set it.<eos> - Yes, I do.
- To fix the air-conditioning.<eos> Honey, it's not broken.<eos> You just don't know how to set it.<eos> - Yes, I do.<eos> - No, you don't.
I set it up back when we were dating.<eos> I, uh, wanted it to be a surprise.<eos> Patrick...<eos> I wanted good things for you, and -- call me crazy --<eos> Mm, I still do.
Because you didn't think he was worth it.<eos> With everything that happened with my father, I understand.<eos> You're the only person who knew how to save me.<eos> - I'm not sure I deserve it.<eos> - You do.
36 salt specks.<eos> You count the number of salt specks?<eos> You don't count?<eos> No.<eos> No, I don't.
How are you? So, are we... are we... are we cool?<eos> You tell me.<eos> Do you want to... talk about it, or...<eos> I don't know.<eos> Do you?

Fuck him and fuck this place!<eos> Nobody talks to me like that, it's bullshit!<eos> I'm not coming here any more, I'm done with therapy.<eos> Liam, you don't mean that.<eos> Yeah, I do.

What did you think of me when you first met me?<eos> Is this about your speech, or more procrastinating?<eos> Speech.<eos> I liked you.<eos> You did not.
Crime detection rate was within norm.<eos> No drug addicts, no prostitutes at all.<eos> But you and Matyugin will be going up in smoke in his fire truck.<eos> Any more threats?<eos> What did you do with the prostitutes?
Two pistols.<eos> Somewhere private.<eos> Choose Baker as your second and I'll select the most discreet man I know.<eos> - Yeah, I know what a duel is.<eos> - Of course you do.

Sir, given his fixation with the '70s, we figured that this would be an opportunity to let Harold Leone open up about his knowledge on Vincent Bianchi's murder.<eos> And did he?<eos> Well no, but...<eos> So, all this mess, this ridiculous display and you have nothing to show for it?<eos> Actually, sir, we do.
Gordon, you're wrong.<eos> What's going on?<eos> - Did you know about this?<eos> - I didn't know anything about this.<eos> Yes, you did.
Gonna be lots of cops out there looking for us, you know?<eos> Were you scared?<eos> Yeah. Yeah, I was.<eos> I'm just glad the clerk didn't get stupid.<eos> And what if he did?
There are dog-sitters on every street corner just waiting to be called.<eos> Those are homeless people.<eos> There are teenagers in this neighborhood that would pay me to look after an adorable dog like Wendell.<eos> - We'll find somebody.<eos> - Yeah, and what if we don't?

You want to sell.<eos> This isn't about Lisa, and I don't give a shit whether this company is sold or not.<eos> This is about you and me and how we're going to run this firm.<eos> Didn't we just have a conversation about that?<eos> Yeah, we sure did.
Not well.<eos> I can only imagine what these last couple of days have been like for you.<eos> But I'm telling you, it's gonna be okay.<eos> - You don't know that.<eos> - Yes, I do.

Good Lord!<eos> Padawan's the student, not the teacher.<eos> Seriously, let him go.<eos> Sheldon, if you really need to do this, I'm not gonna stand in your way.<eos> I do.
Hey, Grayson. I'm a suspect.<eos> They're interrogating me.<eos> You never responded to my text about sponsoring my softball team.<eos> I don't think I got that text.<eos> Yes, you did, honey.

Nothing is ever enough for Amanda Rosewater.<eos> Oh, no, come on. That's not true.<eos> You love being the boss.<eos> - I don't love being the boss.<eos> - Yes, you do. - You totally do, yes.
I thought she could stay behind.<eos> She and Berlin don't get along so well.<eos> I figured we could minimize the drama.<eos> Irisa has value.<eos> Your girlfriend does not.
Why?<eos> Because that's what you do.<eos> When you love someone, and you know they're the one, you make a commitment. Forever.<eos> You don't want to marry me.<eos> Yes, I do. With all my heart.

Come on then.<eos> Stay with me.<eos> Look at this.<eos> If she was in school uniform, she'd look like you.<eos> Don't, Shell.
I know he's marrying me for my money, but I don't care.<eos> Dad and I spent more time together planning this wedding than we ever have before.<eos> And if being married means I get to spend even more time with my dad, then it's worth it.<eos> Wait. You knew all along I just wanted you for your money?<eos> Yeah, Dad, I did.
And when the doctors came to tell her it hadn't worked, she started to scream.<eos> LEIBOVITZ: I went to Seattle to bring her home in an air ambulance.<eos> It was really a harrowing experience.<eos> She then returned to Sloan-Kettering because it was over, and she was being sent there to die.<eos> Um...and she did.
So did you save any lives today?<eos> I bet you did.<eos> I think you have the coolest job ever.<eos> Did you know one of my real-life dreams was to ride in an ambulance?<eos> I didn't, but...
Come on, you started it, what does that mean?<eos> Okay, fine.<eos> I sent you flowers.<eos> We spent the night in a hotel together, but you act like nothing ever happened and I don't like it.<eos> You don't. No, I don't.
Okay, you want honesty?<eos> You may think that Vincent has changed, you may even believe that he actually has, but I used to be what he is, and I know sooner or later, he is going to hurt you...<eos> Gabe and you will be sorry!

I run downstairs, and, uh, there's chazz.<eos> And he's got the hammer.<eos> And he looks up at me and says,<eos> "oh, jeez, lester.<eos> What did I..."
No, you know, last night, your dad and I were talking, and we realized that every time we take a trip, the same thing happens, right, Mike?<eos> Back, cry, forget, snark, fight.<eos> And nobody likes that.<eos> Do you like that?<eos> No. Nobody does.

Things getting better with that math teacher?<eos> It wasn't so bad today.<eos> Oh, by the way, you were right about the park thing.<eos> Piper's parents thought it was weird that you wanted to meet her there, too.<eos> I didn't.
She was Sully's girlfriend.<eos> Where is she now?<eos> Aw, Jesus, here we go again.<eos> You don't want to know.<eos> Oh, but I really do.
He's my father.<eos> Well, if there's any way I could talk to him, even if there's one Sully story, I'd like to hear it.<eos> He's a tired old con.<eos> Sure, he made a lot of stupid mistakes, but he paid for 'em.<eos> We all did.
He noticed some tape had come loose on the box, and... he freaked out.<eos> He made me swear I hadn't opened it.<eos> Holly, do you have any idea what was in that box?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I... I really don't.

Sir.<eos> Potato chips?<eos> Why don't we have any potato chips in this house?<eos> You don't want potato chips.<eos> No, I do.
So, tell me about Gracepoint.<eos> Well, it's the only town for 20 Miles, one road in, one road out.<eos> People come for whale-watching season, tourists, and then again the summer, but basically, we're just a working town.<eos> We've never had a murder here.<eos> I do a weekly crime report in the journal, so...

We are about to launch a product that will fundamentally alter the landscape of this company.<eos> So why shouldn't your father commit to you before your brother has a chance to change his mind?<eos> Are you sure this is the right address?<eos> County Registrar's office said there's no Kurt Renner or anyone living here.<eos> Well, someone does.

Tonight, Bay and I...<eos> Bay and you, what?<eos> Nothing.<eos> I just don't want to lose you.<eos> And neither does Bay.
Yeah, but he's cool weird.<eos> And she's, like, the best mom you could ever ask for.<eos> Okay, I'm just gonna let that go.<eos> - You know what I mean.<eos> - I do.
- No, don't worry.<eos> Instead of $10 million, we'd like to give you 100 million.<eos> Because that would still cost us less than if we fought you and you got this.<eos> - I have no idea what that is.<eos> - Yes, you do.

The cops can trace that shit.<eos> You're gonna get busted, Jill.<eos> Your dad already knows you took it.<eos> - Did you tell him I took it? - No.<eos> But he does.
You don't mean that.<eos> I just wish he could hear me.<eos> So I could tell him I was here.<eos> He knows we're here.<eos> He does.

Oh, yeah. We have another suspect.<eos> Stace? Sweetie, what's wrong?<eos> I'm worried about Owen.<eos> I don't think he wants to marry me.<eos> Well, of course he does.
Owen, you recently had an anxiety attack.<eos> Let's talk about that.<eos> Yes, let's!<eos> I don't think Owen wants to marry me.<eos> What? ! No, of course I do.
I don't think we should just put her in with random skank.<eos> You said Zen Dolls, right?<eos> That's right.<eos> I know somebody who works there.<eos> Or did.
Took her longer to describe it than to drink it.<eos> But she was damn good police.<eos> Slept like a baby every night.<eos> Mind if I keep it?<eos> Yeah, I do.
- You know, you getting promoted up here, When perhaps... She deserves it a little bit more.<eos> - Oh, that.<eos> Well, she's been assigned a new partner.<eos> - There he is.<eos> - Hey, man, what the hell you doing back so soon, huh?
He'll probably get a little rhythm for cooperating.<eos> Annie, I'm sorry.<eos> I should've never let charlie back in.<eos> People don't change.<eos> - You did.
What do you want, Simon?<eos> We are blowing out Madison's candles.<eos> Listen, I don't care that you're her father.<eos> Madison doesn't want to talk to you.<eos> Because she doesn't.
It is helping.<eos> I feel so free.<eos> Do you know what it's like to have sex with a woman who never wants to see you again?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, I do.
No, we had a great day.<eos> Good snowboarding and really nice talks.<eos> You told me that you're very religious.<eos> - I... didn't say that.<eos> - Yes, you did.
You told me that you're very religious.<eos> - I... didn't say that.<eos> - Yes, you did.<eos> Not that I'm very religious, no.<eos> Yeah, you did.
Want a smoke?<eos> No, thank you.<eos> Actually, can I take one?<eos> Do you smoke, Daddy?<eos> Yes, I do.
I love you, Matt... but what you're doing... your paper, the church... it's not working anymore.<eos> It's not making things better.<eos> Maybe it's time to let it go.<eos> The kids' preschool teacher.<eos> They usually did it at her apartment.
I've never done this before, okay?<eos> I've never lived with someone before.<eos> I'm not used to accepting stupid... wooden bars and stuff like that.<eos> You always say that things will work out.<eos> But what if they don't?
I mean, you wouldn't happen to have, you know, a horse that counts or a sheep that juggles?<eos> I mean, anything to sell tickets.<eos> Juggling sheep, huh?<eos> See that little goat over there?<eos> He does a pretty neat trick.
Oh! Oh, come on.<eos> The opening act's about to start.<eos> Uh... the date's over already?<eos> How'd it go?<eos> It didn't.
Oh, yeah.<eos> Relieved.<eos> I thought it was gonna be the worst day.<eos> I was so afraid Reid wasn't going to make it.<eos> Yeah, but he did.
They said he liked nighttime walks in the snow?<eos> He hated the snow.<eos> What about that food?<eos> I didn't know he cooked.<eos> He didn't!
"Charity is good, murder is bad.<eos> But they are random and, in fact, meaningless."<eos> Do you not believe this?<eos> Professor?<eos> - I do.
Tell me about the ASCP, the security agency.<eos> I don't know anything about them.<eos> They installed your alarm.<eos> Possibly, but I don't deal with maintenance issues.<eos> Dad, you do everything, round here.
And what kind of a pageant have you been in?<eos> Well, it was a robotics competition.<eos> Ahem. But the, politics are all the same.<eos> - If you say so.<eos> - I do.
You can force me to stay... but not to see.<eos> You'll have me, but not my visions.<eos> Not if you cost me this last chance at happiness.<eos> So you came to me as if I had a choice,<eos> - but clearly I don't.
Amazing.<eos> Dr. Marber is an artist.<eos> Dr. Marber?<eos> No way.<eos> - Do it.
- You look great. - Bye, Cat.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Bye, darling.<eos> Cat said that Jake needs to be at the book signing.<eos> He does.
And Minnie.<eos> The Equestranauts!<eos> Do I like this show?<eos> Neigh...<eos> I do not.
All these...<eos> Equesticles.<eos> We both know they're weak, pathetic.<eos> I-I don't think that.<eos> Yes, you do.
Look around the side of the eyes.<eos> You see it?<eos> Yeah, yeah, uh, looking... good.<eos> Do you still recognize me?<eos> Do you?
You thought I was the A.V. guy?<eos> What?<eos> No.<eos> No, I didn't.<eos> Yes, I totally did.
Thank you.<eos> You and Louis really came through.<eos> So did you.<eos> Look, I know what you're thinking.<eos> - No, you don't.
- Ultrasound's ready. - Okay.<eos> We're gonna see which saphenous vein to harvest.<eos> Ooh, that's so cold.<eos> Oh, wait.<eos> How did you...
Cheer up, Charlie.<eos> You're not serious?<eos> You are serious.<eos> This place is yours, Cristina, if you want it.<eos> Do you?
A Yorkie and a green leather jacket?<eos> Are you even real?<eos> I love horse racing.<eos> I used to go to the track all the time, and not to brag, but I do own a Thoroughbred.<eos> Oh, yeah, she does.
My comments were thoughtless, and I'm sorry if I offended anyone.<eos> More to the point...<eos> and I want to be clear... it's no one's fault if they are poor.<eos> And you feel that was a sincere apology, Mrs. Florrick?<eos> Yes, I do.
Enjoy.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Oh, hey. The rod that holds up the shower curtain just broke out of the wall.<eos> - Well, maybe Norman can hold it up for me while I fix it.<eos> So how did you...
I'll see you then.<eos> You look beautiful.<eos> I just put dinner on.<eos> Hope you like steak.<eos> Who doesn't?
You're my husband, it's all right.<eos> It's not as though I'm inexperienced.<eos> I'm well aware of that.<eos> Well, if you wanted a virgin...<eos> No, I don't.
Eren wants to join the Survey Corps.<eos> Mikasa, you traitor!<eos> Eren, what are you thinking?<eos> Do you know how many people die outside those walls?<eos> I do!
Even if I'm alone.<eos> You're either incompetent or you're spineless cowards.<eos> How pathetic.<eos> You can sit here and suck on your fingers.<eos> Yeah, do that.
But we're missing something.<eos> What are we missing?<eos> Odor.<eos> Oh, I didn't know you wanted to go that far.<eos> Uh, I don't.
Where's Emma?<eos> Where's Emma, huh?<eos> How do you know my name?<eos> Why'd you tell me you didn't have a family?<eos> I don't.
Are you seriously suggesting Rebecca Barton was assassinated?<eos> Yes, I am.<eos> But they have someone in custody.<eos> Come on.<eos> Of course they do.
This was when we were looking for a mole in the department.<eos> And, more recently, when Liber8 took Jim Martin.<eos> Yeah. Betty found his location pretty quickly.<eos> I don't know what to do.<eos> Yes you do.
She missed my birth 'cause she "had a thing."<eos> Come on, she can't be that bad.<eos> Turns out, you're not that big of a high school dropout, And she's probably not that big of a monster.<eos> I mean, she raised you alone, and you didn't die.<eos> I did actually, twice.
Smokey Taylor for the gold.<eos> - What the hell happened?<eos> - The minute you walked out, she freaked and started yelling that she wasn't ready to be a mother.<eos> How do we know she's not gonna freak and change her mind again?<eos> - We don't.
What do you mean?<eos> Well, you're about to re-marry a man you divorced only a year and a half ago.<eos> That's kind of weird, right?<eos> - You want to explain it?<eos> - No, I don't.
Yes.<eos> You're very good at math, Alex.<eos> I love numbers.<eos> They don't lie.<eos> But people do.
I can't.<eos> I thought I knew you, but now...<eos> Baby, I... I'm not sure.<eos> You did.<eos> You did, Jack.
One, two, three.<eos> Cheers!<eos> It's very good after drinking champagne.<eos> You have a shot, go to bed and crash out, you'll sleep all day.<eos> Like we don't already!
Those guys were after you.<eos> Who's your wife?<eos> Who are you?<eos> - George...<eos> - No, don't.
How?<eos> How?<eos> Stamps are more expensive.<eos> I see right through what you're trying to do, Charlie.<eos> - You do?
Dad beat me.<eos> So I ran, and Grandma chased me.<eos> Said she'll kill me.<eos> Were you here with your grandma?<eos> Did you...
You can't, th...<eos> Anything you do say may be given in evidence.<eos> Are you with me, Ashley? Have you taken that in?<eos> I haven't...<eos> I didn't...
Oh, come on!<eos> You encouraged me.<eos> I...<eos> Maybe not to start with.<eos> But you did.
Good luck, Mr. State's Attorney.<eos> Finn Polmar. Finn, I had a thought.<eos> About how to keep Castro from firing you.<eos> You know he's running for state's attorney?<eos> Yeah, I do.
Don't take him from me again!<eos> Please, God, give him a second chance.<eos> Let's get him to the OR!<eos> I swear to God, Toph, I thought he was gone.<eos> We all did.
Scott is an excellent surgeon.<eos> Yeah, he's good.<eos> I just don't like...<eos> Anyone telling you what to do?<eos> Who does?
You got your phone?<eos> Yeah... Take a picture and send it to him.<eos> Oh, come on.<eos> You sure you want to kick up that hornet's nest?<eos> Oh, hell yeah, I do!
MURMURS: An a fortiori argument is an argument from a stronger...<eos> Must you read at the table?<eos> What's all that stuff anyway?<eos> - I thought you were going to see Neville Kelly.<eos> - Well, we did.
Now, as for having nothing but contempt for Upton, then, yes, I have at times fallen into that trap, but that's not how I feel now.<eos> I don't blame any of you for protecting what you love - I can't.<eos> It's exactly what I'm trying to do right now.<eos> Now, we've all said and done things we don't mean, myself included, and we don't always see eye-to-eye, but I believe we could live side-by-side.<eos> I really do.
She's lucky he's alive, because we're only gonna take her license.<eos> When we're done, she won't practice medicine ever again.<eos> And if we lost him, I wouldn't stop until she was behind bars. I...<eos> It wasn't Dr. Bailey's fault.<eos> She didn't do anything wrong.
Why... why were you so mean to him?<eos> He wasn't spying on us.<eos> He just said he likes us.<eos> - He wants to join the company.<eos> - Of course he does, Richard.
And neither did he.<eos> And he was kind of being an asshole back there.<eos> Yeah, that's why he's a billionaire. 'Cause he knows how and when to be an asshole.<eos> That's what you need to be like.<eos> - You do, Richard.
This is how she feeds.<eos> Will I get a familiar?<eos> In time.<eos> How do I choose?<eos> You don't.
Hey, we need to talk.<eos> Oh, I can't right now, Joe.<eos> I just stopped by to pick up my notes for my afternoon meeting with the Mayor.<eos> I know what's going on.<eos> You do?
Okay?<eos> 'Cause you have me.<eos> And you'll always have me.<eos> You want to be with me even if I'm pregnant with Emerson's baby?<eos> Yeah, I do.
What are you doing?<eos> Get off me. Stop.<eos> How do you know it's real?<eos> The black box?<eos> I don't.
Except for us.<eos> You always said I was too close...<eos> That I couldn't see what was right in front of me.<eos> I wanted to be wrong.<eos> I really did.
Didn't want to get involved.<eos> You people destroyed my family.<eos> How?<eos> - Doesn't matter.<eos> - It does to me.
So you're threatening me?<eos> There must be some part of you that's sick of having a secret.<eos> Keeping a secret like that's exhausting, weighs on your heart.<eos> Oh, at least you love me.<eos> Yes, you do.
I'm not wearing that either.<eos> Mr. Barber, you offered a deal, yes?<eos> Yes, we'll drop obstruct for a plea on vandalism.<eos> For which you have no case.<eos> - We do, actually. - Okay.
Whether we like it or not, that is our job, that is your job.<eos> We are way past the point of no return here, Tess.<eos> This thing is gonna blow up on Vincent and soon.<eos> Which means you need to pick a side.<eos> So does Catherine.
He's obviously knows what he's doing.<eos> Damn it.<eos> Keep looking.<eos> Did you know Catherine was with him?<eos> No. I didn't.
I didn't need to be saved.<eos> Even if I got caught, I wasn't going to jail.<eos> Juries love me.<eos> You saw my boobs.<eos> I did.
Don who?<eos> Our collective ex-wife who still receives alimony?<eos> I agree with Jim.<eos> Do you still love Megan?<eos> Of course I do.
What happened, why do you look so tensed?<eos> Do you love me?<eos> No.<eos> I'm being serious.<eos> Of course I do.
All of them pretty nasty.<eos> There's a creaky saying you hear a lot at the meetings:<eos> Do you want to be right or do you want to be happy?<eos> I don't have that choice.<eos> I never did.
Are you okay?<eos> Do you need anything?<eos> Yeah, I need to know that it didn't happen.<eos> Shana in the theater.<eos> But it did.
You sit with your child at the end of the day and you're exhausted and you don't even know what you did.<eos> And everything you do seems wrong.<eos> It's hard to accept that those are the definitions, but they are.<eos> I'm sorry you had nothing to live for.<eos> I did.
No reporter is gonna sell us their ticket.<eos> There are people on this flight who aren't reporters.<eos> Let's look around and identify them.<eos> Those two are on their honeymoon.<eos> I do, just a little.
Benedict fails to mention that in his sermon, which is bad enough, but you failed to mention that in your report Monday.<eos> And that's inexplicable to me.<eos> Bill Donohue...<eos> Yeah, you don't want the Catholic League mad at you.<eos> Nobody does.
It was a story Charlie wanted because it was a story Pruit wanted and I pretended we couldn't find the Princeton student so we wouldn't have to do the segment.<eos> Charlie knew I was lying, he knew why I was lying.<eos> And I knew he knew why I was lying.<eos> It was a showdown and he lost.<eos> Yes, he did.
- All right, Neal's plane landed!<eos> - Why suddenly?<eos> - What?<eos> You said it was suddenly very important that you live a long time.<eos> - Did I?
You think that because I recommended you for the job in DC that I don't care that you might move to DC?<eos> - I never said that.<eos> - It's easy to interpret as a soft breakup.<eos> - I don't even know what that is.<eos> - He does.
Oh, you know what?<eos> There's this girl that Jenna went to college with.<eos> She's out here, she is smoking hot, man.<eos> I mean, I should get you her number.<eos> I don't really...
No, I'm lucky I brought this.<eos> Yeah, but can that show you how to find food so you don't starve to death?<eos> I brought granola bars.<eos> Yeah, they'd be good if you didn't have a gluten allergy.<eos> Which I don't.
It doesn't work at all.<eos> I mean, if you're a god, why didn't you know the truth about my father?<eos> You didn't even know you were a god.<eos> Admit it, you have no idea where we're going.<eos> Yes, I do.
Ever since you've been gone,<eos> I-I feel like I've been holding my breath.<eos> Well, if that trouser cough is any indication, I can understand why.<eos> You know that's all you, right?<eos> I do now.
Congratulations, you have ruined a beautiful song.<eos> It's a song?<eos> I thought we were just riffing.<eos> I apologize to Dan Hill and all of our viewers.<eos> I don't! Shh!
Oh, honey, you're just hurting.<eos> I'm so sorry you have to go through this.<eos> - I don't know what to do, Mom.<eos> - Oh, sweetheart.<eos> Shh-shh. Oh, baby, nobody does.
- So, let's review.<eos> - Sure.<eos> You sexually entrapped Erich Blunt into giving up a DNA sample, and you were completely out of policy when you shot and killed a man in a rogue police action... a killing for which you were put on administrative leave and sued.<eos> Inspector, don't you think these behaviors call into question your competence as a police officer?<eos> No, I don't.
You'll get paid weekly.<eos> I know it won't bring back your son.<eos> I know that.<eos> You have other sons.<eos> You do.
It's like having a fucking job.<eos> Hey! Easy with them fan belts.<eos> I'll wipe that smile off your face.<eos> I want another pound a boat.<eos> Done.
I had to destroy the evidence.<eos> Luckily, I'm cool under pressure.<eos> What?<eos> ! No!<eos> When did he...?
Listen, I thought you were a reporter, not a sci-fi writer, so...<eos> Tess?<eos> You know that I saw something strange at Cat's apartment that night.<eos> I know that you think you saw something that night and I also know who your so-called source is and he's completely unreliable.<eos> Yes. - You do?
- Right.<eos> Because none of this is real, right, Gabe?<eos> Look, I'm not doing this story.<eos> I don't believe Vincent's a beast, or that they even exist.<eos> Well, they do.
Yeah, but-but Jeff might come back one day.<eos> Look, honey, Jeff is gone.<eos> And nobody knows where he is, not even him.<eos> Plus, he said he hated you right before he left.<eos> No, he didn't.
Come on, come on.<eos> - Want to go? Want to go?<eos> - Please... can you give your highly superior memory a break while we try to relax? I...<eos> I never relax, you know this.<eos> I do.
Also, just stop!<eos> But we've only been together four months.<eos> I just love you so much, I can't wait to have your baby.<eos> God! Kids ruin everything!<eos> Yeah, they sure do.
They all follow the same basic pattern.<eos> "We're gathered here today to join these two in holy matrimony."<eos> "Do you take him to be your lawfully wedded spouse?"<eos> And the first person says...<eos> - I do?
Where the hell have you been? !<eos> Curfew's lifted.<eos> What?<eos> Have they caught the killer?<eos> He did.
But you understand. I had to kill her.<eos> I had to protect my precious angels.<eos> Horseshit.<eos> You had to protect yourself.<eos> But you don't...
Jesus, what the hell was that, gasoline?<eos> It tastes like piss on fire, but it's cheap. It'll get you drunk twice as fast.<eos> Let's have another one.<eos> One's good for me.<eos> I don't do liquor.
May I escort you to the terrace?<eos> Oh, what's this?<eos> Oh. Well, you know how at Costco they have all those free samples?<eos> - I don't.<eos> - Well, they do.
He's just some jealous ex-boyfriend.<eos> He's the person that I slept with who made me realize that I am so over men and way into the lady business.<eos> - Oh, God.<eos> - I don't know what's happening.<eos> I do.
So good!<eos> How are you on this perfect, beautiful, angel-like morning?<eos> Someone's either on a sugar high or a "got them some sugar" high.<eos> Well, I know I don't usually talk about my personal life at work because I didn't have one, but...<eos> I do now!
Look, I'll get you a good lawyer, hopefully...<eos> No, no, no, wait, wait, wait.<eos> You don't have to do that.<eos> I know that he's 17.<eos> - You do?
Mind how you go.<eos> What she say?<eos> Nothing.<eos> Eh?<eos> What she do to ya?
Parsa gave up Hansur as his second in command during my interrogation.<eos> Hansur evaded our roundup, but today he showed his face.<eos> On behalf of the Brotherhood, he released a video claiming responsibility for the break.<eos> Thought you said he didn't have the funding to pull this off.<eos> They don't.
He was your father.<eos> He was.<eos> And now he's dead.<eos> And I still have a job to do.<eos> And I didn't?
Intel suggests that all remaining leaders of the Brotherhood were killed in the strike.<eos> Like I said, I don't need a confession from you, Alejandro.<eos> You think I'm dirt?<eos> You think my father was dirt?<eos> Damn right I do.
Well, she's missing and my friend wants to find her, see if she's okay.<eos> When did the Roundhouse become your personal investigation resource?<eos> The intelligence officer who monitors that database reports to the commissioner every time he sees a red flag.<eos> Like why is a vice cop looking for investigative information on a homicide that's none of his business?<eos> Nothing to do with his caseload.
I hope that's true.<eos> We'll sit by the fire, with all our children around us, and I'll make certain that you are safe.<eos> I wonder.<eos> We both want it so much, but do you believe it'll really happen?<eos> I do.
The witnesses who fingered Walton came clean, all right?<eos> They admitted to lying.<eos> Then why did Walton take the deal?<eos> He didn't have a choice.<eos> You do.
Just slide it in there, nice and easy.<eos> Erich?<eos> Sorry, we have a situation.<eos> Who the hell let you in, Leonard?<eos> I did.
I have no idea what you're talking about.<eos> You had your grandfather kill your father.<eos> I know.<eos> Haven't put all the pieces together yet, and I will.<eos> But when I do...
Fuck, everything's just perfect!<eos> Daddy, your foot!<eos> Hey, sweetie.<eos> Why aren't you sleeping?<eos> I already did.
I really don't know!<eos> All I want to know is... the reason why Park's looking for Lee.<eos> I don't know, I swear!<eos> Please let me go, okay?<eos> You really don't?
Peter, just tell them to stop.<eos> This needs to stop.<eos> Seriously.<eos> I would go there myself with a hatchet, - but I'm in the middle of something here. - Okay.<eos> You didn't...
I'll see you tonight at 8:00.<eos> Eli.<eos> You busy?<eos> I thought we were only watching things that had to do with us.<eos> - This does.
- Inspired by the curves, huh? - Okay.<eos> You hear that?<eos> - You hear him?<eos> You hear your son?<eos> - Yes, I did.
I sit at home and I wonder... how did things come to this?<eos> Why did I deserve this?<eos> There's no reason, Ma.<eos> You think when you're looking at the end, you're gonna get the reason why everything was the way it was.<eos> But you don't.
- Why don't you do this any more.<eos> - I'm going to sign up with the agency.<eos> Even if I can't play such young women any more, I'll find roles that fit my age.<eos> Didn't you like the toy?<eos> I did, Daddy
What's up with that?<eos> We're shooting a film with Veli Bilgin and it's the last scene and he wants to open the shot with an elephant comb.<eos> You know how it is with art house stuff.<eos> - If you don't have it, I'll check in Karaköy.<eos> -I don't, Seyhan.
- Goddamn it.<eos> And I told him I wasn't interested in a family therapy session.<eos> Thank God you're all right.<eos> I... missed you.<eos> Did you just...
How many hours in total do you wear your contacts, Kieren?<eos> Oh, I wear them all the time.<eos> All the time?<eos> When do you take them out?<eos> I don't.
Oh, dear. I should watch my language, though, shouldn't I?<eos> Can't even say boo to a goose these days.<eos> You know, we saved the world once. You'd think that'd be worth summat.<eos> It's like the Rising never happened.<eos> Aye, but it did.
Oh, you know, it's-it's late.<eos> It's just, I was thinking of Katie.<eos> You're the only one in the world who understands.<eos> I understand that calling me makes you feel better.<eos> I do.
They would've preferred the truth.<eos> Heard about Mrs. DiLaurentis, too.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I don't really think that it was a coincidence that Bethany Young was found buried in her backyard.<eos> Do you?
Good seeing you, Spencer.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I should never have come back here.<eos> Look, I get that you're scared, Ali.<eos> We all do.
Yeah. It's so sad.<eos> So much tragedy for such a small town.<eos> If there's anything I can help you with.<eos> Well, we were hoping that you could tell us where you were the night she died.<eos> I already did.
Please, stop it, I'm being serious.<eos> I'm being really serious.<eos> Please, stop it.<eos> Please don't do that, that's upsetting, I'm not...<eos> Don't!
I'm so scared.<eos> I know.<eos> I don't know...<eos> I don't know how to pray, Oliver.<eos> - You do.
James was out of the house...<eos> M.I.A. - Okay, that's a week before Neyers' death.<eos> - Right.<eos> You know where your husband went at that time?<eos> - No, I don't.
You are one spirited little lesbian.<eos> - Who said I'm a lesbian?<eos> - No one.<eos> Not... no, not me.<eos> Not anyone. No one did.
- Megan's in for a visit.<eos> - Thanks for the subtitles.<eos> - Did you hear about Ginsberg? - Yes.<eos> Have you seen him?<eos> I did.
Oh, for the love of christ.<eos> [ sighs ] damn!<eos> [ dog barks in distance ] Jane: Yum.<eos> Tastes just like a ham-and-cheese omelet. Except without the ham and the cheese and the omelet.<eos> How did -- what?
"And my name ain't 'nigga.' you will address me as 'Mr. Freeman.'"<eos> Amazing.<eos> I can't believe it.<eos> - Sturdy, did you hear this?<eos> - Yes, I did.
The Save'n'Shop.<eos> Um...<eos> Jem?<eos> I was wondering if you had a partner for the show-and-tell tomorrow.<eos> Cos if you didn't...
Yeah, we do it every Wednesday now. It's good...<eos> You know, it's good for the circulation, good for their heart.<eos> Vicky takes the class.<eos> Not everyone joins in, you know.<eos> Joe doesn't do it any more cos of his wig.
Been putting it about a bit.<eos> Word on the street, she's now called the hefty gobbler.<eos> Nah, we're better than ever now.<eos> Sex.<eos> Yeah, you do.
Please!<eos> Please!<eos> Please! I'm sorry, please!<eos> Daryl. Stop. You almost died 'cause of him!<eos> But I didn't.
You're thirsty.<eos> Don't say you're not.<eos> Did you want me to shoot you?<eos> I thought I did.<eos> But I didn't.
Uh, sure.<eos> But she was sleeping.<eos> Oh, for heaven's sake, wake her.<eos> You still have my keys.<eos> Yeah, I do.
And Fabián?<eos> It's complicated.<eos> What did he do to you?<eos> Does he know you're here?<eos> - No, he doesn't.
AND ALL WE GOT WAS HOUSE.<eos> THERE'S SOMETHING BIGGER GOING ON HERE.<eos> - MAYBE WE DO STAKE IT OUT, PUT A U.C. INSIDE?<eos> - COOL. THEY DON'T KNOW ME.<eos> HOW ABOUT I DO IT?
And...<eos> Not a problem.<eos> She's all behind it.<eos> Don't expect me to thank you for doing your job.<eos> I don't.
But if an inmate makes the request himself... then I'm required to run their request up the flagpole.<eos> Feel-good drugs?<eos> Feel-less-bad drugs, maybe.<eos> You get what I'm saying?<eos> I do.
I may be wrong, but the thing is...<eos> ..I think I might know who these people are.<eos> Did you see anything?<eos> No. No.<eos> I-I didn't.
Something we can agree upon.<eos> I know God loves you, Daniel.<eos> You said that before.<eos> Or was it Jesus who loved me?<eos> They both do.
He came by the house.<eos> Who?<eos> Teddy.<eos> He told you?<eos> He did.
If he's at ease, exhaust him.<eos> Well fed, starve him.<eos> Settled, move him."<eos> I never knew you gave much merit to Sun Tzu's treatise on war.<eos> I don't.
I can't let you do this.<eos> Okay?<eos> I can't let you walk away from this relationship.<eos> I don't think I have a choice.<eos> You do.
My feelings for you were... are real.<eos> But Marian is my wife.<eos> I loved her, and I made a vow...<eos> "Until death do us part,"<eos> and it did.
If he's hiding something from the FBI, he's not gonna announce it to the whole world on live television.<eos> Ems, I respect your instinct, but I think you're looking for an easier answer.<eos> 'Cause the truth is anything but.<eos> It's hard to accept that this happened to someone that we love.<eos> But it did.
Well, because you had the courage to invest in me.<eos> An investment that paid off.<eos> I figured the profits would provide a nice nest egg for my daughter, Amanda.<eos> She never got the money, did she, Nolan?<eos> Of course she did. Of course she did.
I see.<eos> Hmm. Why don't you take a little longer there, Lavon?<eos> Not like we have a fire to put out or anything.<eos> Hey, we had an understanding!<eos> No, we didn't.
It's a cat?<eos> Yeah. Ha ha ha!<eos> But it has a pop tart for its body, and it's just shooting through space and it has rainbows coming out of its butt and it's just really happy about it.<eos> I don't get it.<eos> No, dad, you don't.
Well, it's great having Alex home, huh?<eos> So great.<eos> You don't think that she's the reason why we --<eos> No.<eos> No, I do not.
Two hours rehearsing with Rosa?<eos> Cam, what is going on with you?<eos> We just had the most romantic year ever, planning our ceremony, the wedding, the honeymoon, and I'm just worried if we let this go, we'll never get it back.<eos> Well, that doesn't all just end.<eos> It did once.
Please stay.<eos> We need at least one adult in this household.<eos> Okay, fine.<eos> You know the attic window is open, right?<eos> We really didn't.
I brought you some coffee.<eos> Did you ever feel anything?<eos> Did you ever love me...<eos> - At all?<eos> - Yes, I did.
Did you ever feel anything?<eos> Did you ever love me...<eos> - At all?<eos> - Yes, I did.<eos> - I do.
Well, yeah, but what doesn't kill you makes you stronger, right?<eos> Please stop talking.<eos> I really got to get on the road, guys.<eos> Gunnar, get out of the car.<eos> - No, you don't.

Huh!<eos> No shit.<eos> Try not to get trapped in there.<eos> How did you know?<eos> Uh... I didn't.
Understand what?<eos> You ever think about the 14th, 14th of October?<eos> The great vanishing? The sudden departure? The clusterfuck of the modern era?<eos> When's the last time you ever really thought about it?<eos> I don't. Me?
You couldn't say "cat"?<eos> Half the internet is videos of cats, Will.<eos> You watched our sex tape? !<eos> Not just me.<eos> We all did.
I forgot.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> My boss called us into work last minute, and I'll take you to dinner this weekend instead.<eos> Boyfriend drama?<eos> I don't do boyfriends.
I think they need to be tested.<eos> But when I say it, I'm wrong.<eos> I made the team!<eos> - That's so exciting!<eos> - Of course you did.
Listen, um...<eos> I want you to know that if it... if it was gonna be anybody, it would be you.<eos> I really want to keep it.<eos> You want to help me cut the peppers?<eos> Yes, I do.
I hooked up with pretty much all the hot guys at boarding school, if it makes you feel better.<eos> Also, I barely remember what his penis looks like.<eos> Wait.<eos> No.<eos> I still do.
It's a normal reaction.<eos> Your mom must be so excited.<eos> Actually, she doesn't know.<eos> Oh, and the father?<eos> Uh, he... He doesn't either.
I'm a big boy. I can handle it.<eos> Well, in that case... ♪ I was right ♪<eos> ♪ I was right, I was right. ♪<eos> I don't know how people... Can be friends with you. I mean, I don't...<eos> I don't...
I would have to lather myself in Purell before stepping into that etch-a-sketch place.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> - Do you have the time?<eos> - Ew! Do you not own a cell phone?<eos> I do now.
Back off, bitch!<eos> Hey, let your phone go!<eos> Thanks.<eos> I had it under control, Jenna.<eos> No, you didn't.
Put your seat belt on.<eos> -Where're you living?<eos> -Is that my son?<eos> -That's my lad.<eos> -Nothing to do with you.
No, please don't, Louie.<eos> Please don't do it here.<eos> Don't what?<eos> - Don't start here.<eos> - Don't what?
- I know it looks a little gay, but it works. - What?<eos> I'm about to go upstairs and give Junior the talk.<eos> - Mm-hmm. - Hey, pops,<eos> - how come you never gave me the talk?<eos> - I most certainly did.
Guys, that's like 300 mississippis.<eos> We better go.<eos> A quadruple ass-whupping?<eos> I don't think you have the cardio stamina for that.<eos> - Oh, I don't.
Really?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Baby, this is the beef plantation!<eos> So, you have "roots" on laserdisc, but eating at a place called beef plantation doesn't bump you?<eos> Well, it didn't...
I didn't mean none of that stuff I just said.<eos> I had to make it at least appear that I was setting you straight for my wife.<eos> You know, she can be a little cuckoo sometimes.<eos> - You understand, right?<eos> - I do.
But that's beside the point.<eos> Man, look.<eos> All black people don't know one another.<eos> Do you know Rupaul?<eos> Yeah. I... I do, actually.
Home invasion?<eos> No. (Laughs)<eos> The thought of you guys growing up.<eos> That scares the hell out of me.<eos> Please don't do it for another 15, 20 years, okay?
Yeah!<eos> Yeah!<eos> Did I forget to tell you that Santa's in charge of the toy drive?<eos> Um...<eos> Yes, you did.
- It's not fair!<eos> You know what? I'll give you the key and you can come down and watch yourself.<eos> Just don't use the stove again.<eos> I don't wanna go to Newark.<eos> - Nobody does.
Boss, I don't want to do this.<eos> You don't get to tell me what you want.<eos> Do you know anything or not?<eos> Boss-- You wanna keep your job?<eos> No. Yeah, you do.
Asking if you were all in, that was wrong.<eos> You think so?<eos> I do. I think it's sexy.<eos> No, you don't.<eos> Yes, I do. I really, really do.
- Axl, get your feet out of my face!<eos> - Come on!<eos> It's an improvement!<eos> - You wish your face looked like my feet!<eos> - Ohh! No, I don't!
Silvie was the idealist of the family.<eos> She worked for an inner-city charity called NRP.<eos> What's that?<eos> - Neighborhood Relief Project.<eos> - Mm. They did anti-gang work...
About what time was that?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Around 9:00.<eos> The next day, she begged me not to say anything...<eos> So I never did.
[Toilet flushes]<eos> Mm, sounds like your dad figured it out.<eos> - Your dad's here?<eos> I want to meet him.<eos> - No, you don't.
That way, if you had a change of heart while it was happening, you couldn't stop it.<eos> [Voice breaking]:<eos> Every day got a little more stressful, especially when his symptoms started to show.<eos> We... we both knew it was coming.<eos> And then... it did.
Uh, you know, it's just, um...<eos> Well, my parents always worried that a job might interfere with my studies.<eos> My big sister... she set me up with this job and I didn't show up, and now she's probably going to throw me out of her house.<eos> My big sister bought me this messenger bag.<eos> Of course she did.
Just so you know, what I heard was, "I love you."<eos> Well, if he's choking, you're doing that wrong.<eos> No, Ama, that was a hug.<eos> "Another thing we didn't have in our village."<eos> We didn't.
- Your husband gets arrested. - Mm-hmm.<eos> Then later on, his buddy Lee comes over, looking for bail money.<eos> Right, and I think if Geno's so smart to save some bail money, well, then he's got to have some money hidden somewhere in this house.<eos> And you want it.<eos> Oh, yes, I do.
My son doesn't need no kidneys.<eos> But I need your son's heart.<eos> I do not give my consent.<eos> - I understand.<eos> - No, you don't.
I told John that you were at a super fun student center event that I could not miss.<eos> Well done. (Sniffs)<eos> Hey, what's wrong?<eos> Nothing.<eos> I did some coke.
Oh, you know, it's-it's late.<eos> It's just, I was thinking of Katie.<eos> You're the only one in the world who understands.<eos> I understand that calling me makes you feel better.<eos> I do.
I mean, you don't just meet somebody like that.<eos> I mean... I had that with my last boyfriend, Cooper.<eos> We had this amazing connection until, you know... He dumped me and moved to China.<eos> But, you know, the point is if you love somebody...<eos> I do!
Please don't do this.<eos> - How long do you want to do this, huh, Lawrence?<eos> - Again. - Briggs.<eos> - No! - He knows.<eos> - What if he doesn't?
A haiku man.<eos> I like haiku.<eos> I'm gonna need your full name and address.<eos> My name's Yosa Buson.<eos> - Any I.D. on you? - I don't.
Who died?<eos> Her husband, uh, down at the pawn shop.<eos> I'm... I'm... I'm really sorry if you were close.<eos> No, he didn't die.<eos> No, no. He did.
Doc, I'm begging you, please, if you can stop this itching, I'll comp you at my new restaurant for life.<eos> Hell, I'll put your kids through college.<eos> Either of you two have kids?<eos> No.<eos> No, I don't.
I mean, you could say there is a God if you believe in it.<eos> That's-- you could just get to say it 'cause you believe it.<eos> You can't argue with somebody's beliefs.<eos> "I believe in God."<eos> "No, you don't."
This may be my last day here.<eos> Okay, Louie. Ready? Mm-hmm.<eos> One, two, three, fart!<eos> I thought you said you had one.<eos> I do, I just...
So I go upstairs, and I'm walking by his parents bedroom.<eos> So the door is wide open and his mom is standing there with just a skirt on.<eos> I saw her tits.<eos> No you didn't.<eos> What if I did?
Nobody wants to put me on a fucking card.<eos> I've pissed off a ton of promoters.<eos> Do you want to fight?<eos> Fuck.<eos> Yes. I do.
I'm a fucking bully.<eos> I'm a bulldozer.<eos> But I hear you.<eos> - Okay?<eos> I do.
He and I used to have such fun.<eos> If only there was someone with whom I could share a bit of roguery.<eos> Ah, yes. That's right.<eos> There is.<eos> You didn't.
Wasn't it your coven who threatened her life?<eos> Is that tea your idea of a peace offering?<eos> Chamomile has lots of healing properties.<eos> Did you know that it's also a flowering plant?<eos> I did.
- I want to get out of here.<eos> - OK, well, that's...<eos> That's up to the board to decide.<eos> I don't have any power over that.<eos> - If you did, your opinion...
Excuse me, Hamilcrap, that is my intel.<eos> Whoa, whoa, you guys, just stop it.<eos> I know you have a thing against Eva, but you need to deal.<eos> Do you even know who she really is?<eos> Yeah, I do;
Huh- - What do you think of that?<eos> So-so-So what'd I say?<eos> An ounce per scale, is that what it was?<eos> Actually, you said two ounces.<eos> Oh, I did, did I?
Simply a woman!<eos> I'm repeating myself.<eos> So change the record, love.<eos> - I make a mess when I eat.<eos> - Michel does, not Mylène.
I'll get solitary.<eos> You've missed the roll-call.<eos> Maybe you'll just get a reprimand.<eos> - How do you know all this?<eos> - I just do.
There was no abuse, Ellen.<eos> I got bruises.<eos> You ran, Tish.<eos> When people do that, we chase after them.<eos> Of course she did.
And I grew up watching my parents and all of his teachers baby him.<eos> And it didn't do him any favors.<eos> It wasn't until people stopped making excuses for him and forced him to truly try that he made any real progress.<eos> I didn't know that.<eos> Well, now you do.
- Yes.<eos> - Who... yeah.<eos> - Yeah, no, we...<eos> - no, wait, no.<eos> - Not sure I do.
Did you call the Sheriff, Walt Longmire?<eos> You can tell me.<eos> I didn't call anybody.<eos> I thought you said you and your wife had some car trouble.<eos> We did.
For quite some time.<eos> Nucky?<eos> I called.<eos> Didn't you get the message?<eos> Actually, I did.
We're just good friends...<eos> And roommates and, uh...<eos> But I don't know all the details of her life.<eos> Do you know where Divya is?<eos> Oh, yes, I do.
What do you mean?<eos> You told Nemec about me.<eos> It was you.<eos> You're the only one who knows I'm here.<eos> Of course I did.
Did something happen between you and Erica Flynn?<eos> Why?<eos> She made a point of letting me know that it did, so did it?<eos> Actually, yes.<eos> Something did.
Millions in selling oil to the west.<eos> I mean, you say that that gave you the ability to be who you are, to do what you do, as a direct result of Western wealth.<eos> Your arrogance is surpassed only by your naivete.<eos> You thought you knew us.<eos> You did not.
I didn't have it on me.<eos> Why did Vera give you a gun?<eos> He wanted me to be safe.<eos> Did you love Aaron?<eos> I still do.
Because it can't.<eos> I've read your letter.<eos> Do you love me?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, I do.
Vigor."<eos> The ouroboros, or a snake eating its own tail.<eos> It suggests eternal renewal.<eos> I wonder if that has something to do with the condition of your father's body.<eos> Or maybe this does.
No, thank you Caitlyn.<eos> I can wait till he's back from Brussels.<eos> Ryan's not in Brussels.<eos> But you knew that already.<eos> - Yes, I did.
Should we go back to your room?<eos> No.<eos> And... and... and you got to get back to work.<eos> - No, I-I-I don't.<eos> - Yeah, you do.
Yeah?<eos> What?<eos> You're using the garden project as a way of smuggling stuff in.<eos> I don't know what you're talking about, Dors.<eos> Yeah, you do.
Personally, I'm thinking the storage space, but if we're really digging into the space-time of it all, the colonial's got that whole Narnia spin.<eos> You said that you saw this in a vision? They always mean something.<eos> I think that door is the way back into the dome.<eos> Hunter, we need addresses.<eos> No, you don't.
- That's quite a lot.<eos> Did you take my advice?<eos> I'm just asking.<eos> I haven't your appetite for danger.<eos> So you didn't?
No one knows who's flying or where until the algorithm chooses.<eos> Cloaked in this kind of secrecy, it must be a very high value target.<eos> And without planning, it's almost an impossible heist.<eos> Unless you have the algorithm.<eos> Of which, thanks to Neal and Keller, the Pink Panthers do.
That's why I'm gonna take all the money.<eos> I-I told you we couldn't trust him.<eos> We had a deal, Keller.<eos> Yeah, you're right.<eos> We did.
I don't know, but until I think of something,<eos> I'm going to confuse the shit out of everyone I can.<eos> That doesn't make any sense.<eos> - It makes total sense.<eos> - No, it doesn't, Your Honor.
I told him I was going after the same company he was, and he used that knowledge to move up his tender offer.<eos> He waived conflict.<eos> That doesn't apply to privilege.<eos> Bottom line is, he doesn't have proof of anything.<eos> I don't, but he does.
Look, I gave my word to Walter Gillis.<eos> That's what I told Harvey and what I told Logan and what I didn't think I'd have to tell you.<eos> I'm just saying, all of this could have been over today.<eos> You think I don't want this to be over?<eos> I do.
I mean, she didn't even consider me.<eos> Just brings him in, had me train him, and gives him the corner office.<eos> Hey, did I ever tell you about the time that I auditioned for Hamlet in college?<eos> Obviously, you played Ophelia.<eos> No, Chrissy Kiff did.
And he's about to go down.<eos> How do you know?<eos> 'Cause the only way to stay in the game is to get Walter Gillis to give up his dream.<eos> And you don't think he has the stomach to rip off the arm to save the body.<eos> No, he doesn't.
Need anything else?<eos> Um, I will let you know.<eos> Wow, beer guy is super hot.<eos> I guess. If you like that type.<eos> I do.
That's not cool.<eos> You can't treat my niece that way.<eos> Forget it.<eos> Wayne, you have chocolate sprinkles on your face.<eos> I always do.
I don't even know how you do that.<eos> I really thought I hated you, you know?<eos> Well, thank God you kept that to yourself.<eos> There was this planet, Obsidian. - Planet of perpetual darkness.<eos> - I did.
Affliction can only be passed by some kind of conception.<eos> And do our siblings share this affliction?<eos> Do you... Share this affliction?<eos> No...<eos> I don't.
Kol will return home soon.<eos> Elijah will wake from his slumber believing the only way to salvage his humanity is to rejoin our family, which is why it is time you bring Camile in.<eos> Here. I've spelled this to subdue her without causing bodily harm.<eos> I thought we had more time.<eos> We don't.
We have a lot to catch up on.<eos> Oh my God.<eos> Who was that?<eos> Some guy who thinks I wrote him into my book.<eos> - Did you?
Finito.<eos> After what happened last night, there's zero chance we're ever going to get back together, and it's all my fault.<eos> Yowzer, here we go again.<eos> Liam, enough with the guilt.<eos> You didn't do anything wrong.
Sorry.<eos> Stop saying sorry, Keith.<eos> You sound like a fucking pussy, man.<eos> Hey, Keith, why didn't you start the puzzle?<eos> I did.
Yeah. I just thought it was Huntington for some reason.<eos> Well, I guess if you want to be official, you're from the Valley.<eos> But to me, you're from Venice.<eos> Hey. Lisa said you have my money.<eos> I do.
Here, drink this.<eos> So, the good news is, his knee is stable.<eos> So right now it's all about developing his strength and his lateral movement.<eos> Did he tell you he has a piece of his pelvis floating around?<eos> Uh, yes. Yes, ma'am, he did.
Oh, there was hench.<eos> Was there, now?<eos> Yes, there was. Look at you, picking up on things.<eos> You must have had a feeling about that.<eos> I did, yes.
Can you just call me back when you get this?<eos> 818-121-8791.<eos> I really have to talk to you.<eos> Hey, I'm not here.<eos> Do your thing.
Sorry for what?<eos> - For lying on the stand.<eos> I was sitting next to you while she testified.<eos> Why didn't you say anything?<eos> I did.
Now, you tell the judge and let's all get on with the rest of our lives.<eos> I'm just sick of this shit.<eos> Can I get one of those?<eos> I didn't know you smoked.<eos> - I don't.
He still won't come with you?<eos> Uh, it's just hard for him.<eos> The kids at school have been...<eos> Honey, Luke loves you so much.<eos> He does.
Dancer, leader, wife, mother, collector of rare meteorites.<eos> You'll find people here have many skills and interests.<eos> Korra, why did you lie when Aiwei asked if there was anyone else with you?<eos> What?<eos> I-I didn't.
All right, I know this is gonna be a long first leg, but I'm gonna get back every chance I can.<eos> You're gonna come out every chance you can.<eos> We're gonna Skype our lessons.<eos> I just don't get why Luke's making you go on tour with him.<eos> I don't, either.
Look Wheeler, Brett from Rolling Stone.<eos> - Brett: How you doing?<eos> - How you doing?<eos> I thought this was just gonna be the two of us - taking care of all this.<eos> - I did, too.
[Voice breaking] He doesn't want kids.<eos> Wait, you've been dating three months. You just now told him?<eos> Nobody wants to date a single mom, okay?<eos> Kiley, come on. I'm sure some guy's...<eos> No, Gunnar, they don't!
! No, Maddie.<eos> I am trying to protect you.<eos> Do you remember how you felt when you saw that magazine article?<eos> Remember... and the way it depicted you?<eos> - Yes, I do.
Probably shouldn't, anyway.<eos> Maybe you should just move in for a little bit.<eos> Guest room's empty.<eos> Unless you have a better idea.<eos> I don't.
Oh, it's when you're stuck with somebody.<eos> Like my mom's stuck with me?<eos> Hey, she's not stuck with you, buddy.<eos> She just... Needed a little breather.<eos> We all do once in a while.
Let's talk about it.<eos> My ex-wife, married to me for all of six years, took me for more than half of everything I'd ever earned in my entire life to that point.<eos> And I'm sorry about that.<eos> But that's not me, and I think you know that.<eos> Yeah, I do.
I did love him, but I don't love him now.<eos> I love you.<eos> Who ended it?<eos> - Does that matter?<eos> - It does to me.
At least this way it'll be me.<eos> What's the difference if you hire somebody to look into Mike or Logan does?<eos> You know damn well they're gonna uncover his secret.<eos> I don't know that, and you don't either.<eos> - Yeah, I do.
It's 10:30.<eos> There's a lot to discuss, Jessica.<eos> No, there isn't.<eos> We need to bury them in paperwork.<eos> No, we don't.
Dude.<eos> It's okay.<eos> I always kind of knew.<eos> Wait.<eos> You did?
Okay, that's the last one.<eos> Looks like we're live.<eos> It's fancy.<eos> I didn't know the department had money for gear like this.<eos> They don't.
You enjoy giving people grades.<eos> A valid point, but unoriginal-<eos> - B-minus.<eos> And you love the sound of your own voice.<eos> Yeah, well, of course I do.
Not yet.<eos> Get ready.<eos> I told you to call my cell phone.<eos> You really don't want to be up here.<eos> Oh, yes, he does.
Previously on Girlfriends' Guide to Divorce...<eos> Jake needs to be at the book signing.<eos> He does.
- Oh, my God.<eos> Wanting your husband dead?<eos> - Really.<eos> Well, we all think it at times.<eos> What? - Yes, of course we do.
Wanting your husband dead?<eos> - Really.<eos> Well, we all think it at times.<eos> What? - Yes, of course we do.<eos> You do?
- Yes, you do.<eos> You're afraid of what's happening to me.<eos> And Mom doesn't love me.<eos> Your mom loves you.<eos> We-we both do.
Ethan, give me that phone.<eos> Hey, I just want to see it.<eos> You don't want me to call him.<eos> You're right.<eos> I-I don't.
This doesn't seem like a prudent course of action, considering.<eos> We're not leaving him.<eos> You said Sean was exposed to the spores.<eos> How do you know he won't contaminate the capsule?<eos> I don't.
- Why?<eos> - Run it by him.<eos> We're here to make the decision for him.<eos> Do you think we should take him the bid at $10 million?<eos> - I do.
I was about to leave, anyway.<eos> I hate Russian food.<eos> Nice meeting you, Martine. Mmhmm.<eos> - I like her.<eos> - No, you don't.
Preggers felt that in the baby maker.<eos> He said he'd kill me if I did.<eos> He said he'd get away with it 'cause he was a policeman and no one would believe it if he killed his wife.<eos> He told me no one would protect me.<eos> But someone did.
I know.<eos> I'll stop, okay?<eos> Stop trying to change you or whatever the hell it is you think I'm trying to do.<eos> I'll just stop trying to help.<eos> No. Don't.
There's a gag order.<eos> What if I leak it?<eos> The judge will hold you in contempt.<eos> I can just say I don't know what a gag order is.<eos> But you do.
- Are you lying, Cody?<eos> - Your Honor, I ask the court to cite the prosecutor for misconduct and allow my witness to leave the stand.<eos> I'm not lying about my mother.<eos> She loved elke.<eos> We all did.
If the light takes me back, I need you to burn me.<eos> Hide me from the demons.<eos> You're not gonna die, Eleanor.<eos> I got a good doctor coming.<eos> But if I do.
Now, you know that.<eos> I heard you talking to those kids at the diner.<eos> You believe.<eos> Don't you, lady?<eos> I do.
Okay.<eos> I don't want...<eos> I don't want to have sex.<eos> That... that... that came out wrong.<eos> I do.
And, please, promise me... promise me you won't say anything.<eos> Fine.<eos> Ah, I still don't know what got into you last night.<eos> [Chuckles] Well...<eos> [High-pitched voice] I do.
Insecure.<eos> In-secure.<eos> you don't think I'm, like, this overemotional, you know... sensitive crybaby?<eos> Baby bird.<eos> Of course I do.
I'm sorry, Julia.<eos> It's my own fault.<eos> When you guys started talking about tunnels, I just really wanted...<eos> I really wanted to believe there was a chance.<eos> We all did.
No, you didn't lose faith.<eos> I'm the one who lost faith.<eos> I didn't understand your gifts.<eos> O-O-Or that the dome had chosen us.<eos> Now I do.
But even with everything that's happened, I still choose to believe you're trying to protect us.<eos> I think that when you... stopped moving, that was your way of giving all of us another chance, so I need to ask you for one more thing.<eos> Please help Melanie.<eos> She deserves to live.<eos> Everyone in here does.
Nobody knows which way to go.<eos> Barbie, we need to go this way.<eos> We saw the butterfly go down there.<eos> I think it's a sign.<eos> Both Joe and I do.
It's not life threatening, but you should try to avoid eating rich foods, red wine, oysters... that kind of thing.<eos> Yeah, where she's going, that won't be a problem.<eos> You're a traitor.<eos> We had a deal.<eos> We did.
Okay, I have...<eos> Two dollars.<eos> What do you got?<eos> I thought you had money.<eos> I did.
You're like a brother to me now.<eos> I really like you.<eos> I really... really, really like you.<eos> That shirt looks great on you.<eos> Yeah, better than it does on me.
(IN MOCK LA ACCENT) Georgie, that went so well.<eos> You did so well, I have to say.<eos> Do you think you'll definitely get the part?<eos> -(IN NORMAL ACCENT) Yeah, definitely. -I think you will, too.<eos> How about we do a little role play?
I'm just realizing it's gone.<eos> The spikes are starting to understand that they're part of you.<eos> Wait.<eos> You make it seem like they've got a mind of their own.<eos> They do.
I got it.<eos> Aim for the heart.<eos> The heart?<eos> Where's the heart?<eos> Just do it!
You know, Sam finally made reservations at a restaurant, which he never does.<eos> I just want to have dinner in bed.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Oh, hey, did, uh, Wes sign those papers?<eos> Yeah, he did.
Yeah.<eos> Oh, hey, did, uh, Wes sign those papers?<eos> Yeah, he did.<eos> Awesome!<eos> He did, yeah.
Please don't use that expression.<eos> What, did it offend you? No.<eos> It's just inaccurate.<eos> Mr., uh, Grassi, do you know why you're here?<eos> Nope. I don't.
What does... what does any of this have to do with me?<eos> Go ahead, Junior.<eos> Tell your dad.<eos> You did this to my son?<eos> No, Mr. Grassi, I didn't...
We could all go home.<eos> You could have kept quiet.<eos> But instead, you walked into my office, and you sounded the alarm.<eos> I thought you should know.<eos> And now I do.
So do you try to capture bad guys every day?<eos> I try.<eos> Boy: But...<eos> How do you know If they're bad guys or good guys?<eos> Sometimes you don't.
- Caitlin, whatever happens--<eos> - Ronnie.<eos> Ronnie!<eos> He saved so many lives that day, And no one will ever know what he did.<eos> - I do.
You two arrive at the same time?<eos> - Dad, we have something that we need to tell you.<eos> Dad, the thing is-- - You two are dating.<eos> I know.<eos> - You do?
It doesn't make sense, but I'm not doing this because of the journal, I'm doing this because what does make sense is protecting Vincent from Gabe.<eos> And that's all that matters to me.<eos> I got to stop Gabe now.<eos> No.<eos> You don't.
I'm the reason they're coming after us.<eos> Which is why you wanted to hire Jeff in the first place.<eos> That was before all this became real.<eos> Now that it's happening, he doesn't want to sit on the sidelines.<eos> Damn right I don't.
What did you say to Gianopolous?<eos> Not much. Just that you were the person responsible for his number two leaving him.<eos> I was responsible?<eos> He agreed to it. But what he didn't know was is that it was his own lawyer who came up with the idea.<eos> Now he does.
Well, did you?<eos> See it?<eos> He came in from the side. It was fast but...<eos> Father should have seen him coming.<eos> He didn't even...
Thank you.<eos> Seriously, thank you.<eos> Yes, a lot of people died and maybe the wrong people survived.<eos> - Yeah, but we saved the world, right?<eos> - We did. - You did.
Improving.<eos> I see you've got news for me.<eos> News? He figured it out then?<eos> PE figured out there was a way home.<eos> Yeah. Yeah, he did.
He'll make a maths teacher yet.<eos> Listen, Doctor.<eos> There's something that I have to tell you and, um... ..it's not good news so just listen, OK? I know.<eos> Sorry? I know exactly what you've got to tell me.<eos> You do?
Well, it's... it's not about the toll.<eos> So, um, it's... it's a possibility you might have witnessed something today.<eos> You know, one of your neighbors saw the car and called it in.<eos> No, I didn't see anything important.<eos> I don't... no.
If you have to pretend to be all harmless to win her over, then clearly, you've picked the wrong girl.<eos> - Again!<eos> - I'll pay your way.<eos> You have to pay for Sergio, too.<eos> Done!
That's a shock.<eos> Well, this can't be good.<eos> The, uh, Secretary of State's plane just went down over the Atlantic.<eos> I thought we said no gadgets at the table.<eos> ELIZABETH: We did.
I love him.<eos> You don't even know him.<eos> Yes, I do.<eos> I... you must've loved Jax when you were together.<eos> I still do.
Close this deal, and as soon as it's wrapped up, he's out.<eos> And what about Jessica?<eos> Is she gonna agree to it?<eos> Let me deal with Jessica.<eos> Oh, just like you did on wexler.
Oh, my God.<eos> You son of a bitch.<eos> You promised me that I would control what happened to that company.<eos> I promised you if we won.<eos> We didn't.
You son of a bitch.<eos> You promised me that I would control what happened to that company.<eos> I promised you if we won.<eos> We didn't.<eos> - You did.
You promised me that I would control what happened to that company.<eos> I promised you if we won.<eos> We didn't.<eos> - You did.<eos> - Yes, I did.
What are we talking about here?<eos> Where's Lucia?<eos> She's with Carlito, thanks to you.<eos> What, you just let him take her?<eos> I didn't... yeah.
Being the kind of scumbag Who's begging to get his ass kicked. Excuse me?<eos> Do you hit on all of aria's friends or is it just hanna?<eos> So I'm guessing you're the boyfriend.<eos> I respect you coming here.<eos> Seriously, I do.
If you identify this guy, it will be way too easy For "a" to prove that you're lying.<eos> We don't even know who this cyrus person is Or where he came from.<eos> I get it, em.<eos> Okay?<eos> I do.
Were you even listening when I asked you Not to talk to her?<eos> Yes, I was.<eos> And you sought her out anyway?<eos> I...<eos> I didn't...
at the hospital or we're busted.<eos> What picture of "A"?<eos> Picture of Alison.<eos> No, you said a picture of "A".<eos> No, I didn't.
What picture of "A"?<eos> Picture of Alison.<eos> No, you said a picture of "A".<eos> No, I didn't.<eos> Yeah, you did.
"Don't screw up"?<eos> Don't miss.<eos> Okay, all you have to do is nick him. It'll work fast.<eos> Even on an Alpha.<eos> We gonna do this again?
It's not like he said,<eos> "Kyle, I know you're sleeping with my wife."<eos> Trust me, Liz, he knows.<eos> Can we...<eos> And now... so do we.
Guy in a silver Subaru who sat in his car all day watching me.<eos> My God.<eos> I hope you got his license.<eos> As a matter of fact,<eos> I did.
Go, have fun.<eos> I know.<eos> Hey, yo, try some Fro-Yo.<eos> Do you know what you want?<eos> Um, yeah, yeah, I do.
I kissed Gabe, didn't I?<eos> Yes, you certainly did.<eos> Taylor...<eos> I really don't like him.<eos> Except, you do...
What are you doing here?<eos> I should've told you this sooner.<eos> Because then maybe you wouldn't be here.<eos> Elizabeth didn't take your backpack.<eos> I did.
But after the things she said, and the way she acted...<eos> He thought she was crazy.<eos> Well, she said she heard things.<eos> Why did she want her ashes in here?<eos> Well, actually, she didn't.
How easy is it to get this thing now?<eos> Meredith was only there *** once.<eos> But I think once was enough.<eos> How did your grandmother know her?<eos> She didn't.
I wanted to help.<eos> All you ever wanted to do was help.<eos> Is that why you're here?<eos> I know you wouldn't want to be here if you didn't want to talk.<eos> I do.
I want Alvey and him to be there. You know, I get it.<eos> I completely understand.<eos> Man, I tell you, it's like spinning plates all the time.<eos> - Nothing ever works out, you know.<eos> - I do.
Even made a new one.<eos> Guy in a silver Subaru who sat in his car all day watching me.<eos> My God.<eos> I hope you got his license.<eos> As a matter of fact, I did.
Go, have fun.<eos> I know.<eos> Hey, yo, try some Fro-Yo.<eos> Do you know what you want?<eos> Um, yeah, yeah, I do.
I kissed Gabe, didn't I?<eos> Yes, you certainly did.<eos> Taylor...<eos> I really don't like him.<eos> Except, you do...
What are you doing here?<eos> I should've told you this sooner.<eos> Because then maybe you wouldn't be here.<eos> Elizabeth didn't take your backpack.<eos> I did.
- I know.<eos> You love him, you tell us about him.<eos> Our words can contradict our thoughts.<eos> Out of family duty, I say I love him.<eos> When you actually don't?
I have scripts at home.<eos> I'll read them to you.<eos> Tonight, I dub thee... actress.<eos> - Did you speak to him?<eos> - Yes, I did.
Read what?<eos> The door.<eos> It says, "Keep Out."<eos> No, it says, "Go Away Humans."<eos> Oh, so it does.
Is there not to be an intercession?<eos> Intercess all you want, mate, as long as I'm intercessing with my double cheese, extra pep.<eos> I'm assuming he doesn't have my pizza on him.<eos> No.<eos> No, he does not.
I anticipate an upgrade to murder, but that's just me.<eos> We've become aware of certain emails and texts he sent to Rose Marquez.<eos> Threatening ones.<eos> If you know where he is, you should tell us.<eos> We don't.
I tried and I tried.<eos> Mr. Martin...<eos> She was never the girl I needed her to be.<eos> You understand.<eos> I do.
It's about Frank.<eos> What about him?<eos> He's in trouble.<eos> You know where he is now?<eos> - We do.
I just...<eos> I rolled out and forgot my cards.<eos> I'll get you back.<eos> - You said that last time. - No, I didn't.<eos> Uh, yes, you did.
You had two sets of sheets, a terrycloth robe, three sets of pajamas, five sheets.<eos> No kids clothes.<eos> Give them back.<eos> And you.<eos> You did three loads... all boys clothes.
We walked around and around in circles.<eos> Then we went on one of those little can...<eos> I mean, it was just...<eos> Do you know...?<eos> He doesn't.
Thank you again.<eos> I'll walk you out.<eos> You were right.<eos> People change.<eos> Fletcher Sayers did.
There's been some trouble, Rush.<eos> Some business associates of mine, they...<eos> Business associates?<eos> You know what I mean.<eos> Yeah, yeah, I do.
Is that it?"<eos> "No, hang on, Charlie.<eos> "Do you see an image?<eos> "Hidden in the ink blot?<eos> "Other people do.
All dead.<eos> That's finished.<eos> The war ended.<eos> Damn, Bohannon, they had it comin'.<eos> They did, right?
Carrie.<eos> There was a car right here.<eos> A rental.<eos> You got the plate?<eos> Uh, I... I... I didn't...
A rental.<eos> You got the plate?<eos> Uh, I... I... I didn't...<eos> I didn't see it.<eos> Yeah, you did.
That'd be nice.<eos> - Let someone else be cops for a while. - Oh...<eos> You've done enough.<eos> Give Jo time to find the antidote, let us all take over.<eos> What if she doesn't?
So, they hustled Jiggy while Henry was wearing that invisibility suit.<eos> Henry is the one that was moving the cue ball around the table.<eos> And perhaps once Henry realized the power of the suit, he set his sights on Will, making sure that power would never be taken away.<eos> Okay, how do we find this kid?<eos> We don't.
I just keep thinking I'll lose you again, or something terrible will happen.<eos> I know it sounds crazy...<eos> No, no, it does not sound crazy.<eos> I would feel the same way.<eos> Matter of fact, I did.
Tell me, Bess, do you believe that Harry, here, is the possessor of supernatural powers?<eos> Over me he sure does.<eos> I believe when we first met,<eos> I told you I was a clairvoyant.<eos> Yes, ma'am, you did.
I never got the chance to tell her...<eos> I said some really terrible things to her.<eos> Listen to me, Connor.<eos> I'm a mother, and I promise you, your mother knew you were sorry.<eos> No, she didn't.
Did you... scatter Bixby's ashes?<eos> In the garden under a jacaranda tree.<eos> In the spring, it's gonna be full of purple flowers.<eos> I thought she was gonna make it through.<eos> Yeah, we all did.
You see what I did there?<eos> I put a sock in it.<eos> Literally.<eos> Classic Bolin.<eos> I do what I do.
I did not love my neighbor this week.<eos> I sat in judgment on my fellow man.<eos> I reveled in the pit of my own self-righteousness.<eos> So I deserve to be cast out into darkness, and I do not deserve salvation.<eos> None of us does.
That's his way.<eos> Your way is about the future.<eos> A future I want for my country, my people, my children.<eos> Do you have officers you can enlist... men you trust?<eos> I do.
No.<eos> Actually... I'll use our phones.<eos> If you think that's best.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, I do!
- Did you arrest Robles?<eos> - It's not that easy, Sonya.<eos> Why?<eos> Mexico City has Eva's affidavit.<eos> No, they don't.
In the meantime, can I get back to fine-tuning machines instead of being hooked up to one?<eos> Yes.<eos> In a second.<eos> I barely had anything to drink.<eos> I didn't... a couple sips of wine with a pairing menu.
- Awful?<eos> The person who did this should get a big fat reward.<eos> You think this is a good thing?<eos> Angels dying?<eos> Yeah, I do.
- Now listen here, sonny.<eos> I've won this contest three years in a row and I never had any problem with vandals until you decided to enter.<eos> So be warned, I will sit up all night to protect my decorations and my property.<eos> And anyone who trespasses will have me and the end of a baseball bat to contend with.<eos> - You didn't... ?
!<eos> I want diamond earrings.<eos> Are you sure you like them?<eos> No...<eos> Yes, I do.
Drop it.<eos> Drop the fucking gun.<eos> There's a million dollars on that table.<eos> $500,000, if you split it.<eos> A million if you don't.
Three missing bodies.<eos> There could be a connection.<eos> You have anything with the missing bodies with the scent?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, I do.
You don't know the things waller's made me do.<eos> The person she turns you into.<eos> That still gives you no right To put a bulls-eye on my family's back!<eos> I had no choice.<eos> But you do, john.
I just can't be here, and I can't be at home.<eos> I can't be anywhere.<eos> Go see him.<eos> I don't even know where he is.<eos> Yes, you do.
Well, it damn sure didn't help when you jumped on in there and told him it was a great choice.<eos> It was a great choice, and if I hadn't jumped in and let you speak your mind, you know what he would have heard?<eos> Something's wrong with Mike Ross.<eos> - You don't know that.<eos> - Yes, I do, and so do you.
I am.<eos> Why aren't you at work?<eos> Because I spent the whole day moving from one place to another, and I just had to talk to you.<eos> How'd you know I'd be here?<eos> I didn't.
I guess I am.<eos> A little.<eos> My sister has to stop calling.<eos> I'll take care of it.<eos> Luisa, he really doesn't...
And instead of embracing me, you used me and lied to me?<eos> Charlotte...<eos> Do you hear yourself? You chose revenge over me.<eos> I didn't think I had the choice.<eos> Well, you did.
How'd you hurt your wrist?<eos> I fell.<eos> Does it hurt?<eos> Whoa, looks like the bad guy's winning.<eos> He always does.
Whoa, looks like the bad guy's winning.<eos> He always does.<eos> That doesn't seem right.<eos> Why don't you let the good guy win?<eos> Because he doesn't.
That's what really killed Reed, you know?<eos> The Gadget.<eos> I don't know how many different ways I can say this.<eos> Even if I had known about an inside man in Werner Heisenberg's staff...<eos> - Which you didn't.
The Gadget.<eos> I don't know how many different ways I can say this.<eos> Even if I had known about an inside man in Werner Heisenberg's staff...<eos> - Which you didn't.<eos> - Which I didn't.
The Perlmans are your wife's cousins?<eos> What role did Abby play in all of this?<eos> Paul.<eos> Didn't think you had the first idea where I lived.<eos> I didn't.
Totally.<eos> High five.<eos> I'll get that.<eos> Okay, I like that.<eos> All girls do.
Even though she's clearly a ridiculous human being, you know?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Break-ups hurt.<eos> I've heard.<eos> I don't really do relationships.
And that's what I wanted.<eos> Really good.<eos> It was the American dream, if that even exists anymore.<eos> But that day, I totally believed in it.<eos> We both did.
You don't know that.<eos> I hope it.<eos> Look... I just need a night here before I continue my journey, but I'll stay tomorrow and help, if that's what you want.<eos> Just meet me in the morning at the barn, and we can continue training.<eos> But if you don't...
I'm having a whiskey.<eos> You want one?<eos> We have a guest.<eos> Well, does he want one?<eos> No, she doesn't.
- Thank you.<eos> Bye-bye.<eos> Who's that?<eos> Seems like they've met before.<eos> Yes, it does.
It could've been me.<eos> Hunted, on the run, cut off from everyone I know and care about.<eos> You guys saved me.<eos> And I want to save her just as bad as you do, Barry.<eos> We all do.
You don't take innocent lives.<eos> We shouldn't be listening to this.<eos> That man deserved to die.<eos> They all deserved to feel my pain!<eos> No, they didn't.
I mean, this mitrial gurgle...<eos> Martrial gastral...<eos> No, no.<eos> Crosby, do you even know what mitral regurgitation is?<eos> No, I don't.
He's got all my files.<eos> Brought you everything I had at home.<eos> Did Grace ever get that job?<eos> She mentioned something about a presentation or something a while back.<eos> She did, didn't she?
I thought that's what this party was all about.<eos> You think that's what I wanted to see from you?<eos> You're here because of who you are, not because of who you think I want you to be.<eos> Well, I wanted to show you that I know what I'm doing.<eos> But you don't.
That's right! Explain why merchants prefer to border our city.<eos> We want an explanation.<eos> Rather a clarification, because we're losing a lot of money.<eos> - Let's see...<eos> - Do your best!
- Did you get it?<eos> - No.<eos> A little heads up would have been nice.<eos> I don't exactly have a backup plan.<eos> - Well, good thing I do.
Just lost his last appeal.<eos> Scheduled to be executed next week.<eos> So, what?<eos> You think someone's decided to pick up where your boy left off?<eos> Yeah. Yeah, I do.
Those last three girls you killed, where are their bodies?<eos> 'Cause the families want closure, right?<eos> But... this ain't the movies.<eos> And, trust me, they do not want to see them now.<eos> But maybe someone else does.
Yeah, which didn't come back to Briscoe or his twin, but to an unknown male, who probably is the real killer.<eos> Maybe.<eos> Maybe not.<eos> You still think the twins are behind this?<eos> Yes, I do.
He's likable.<eos> So is Trey.<eos> Trey was the one wearing the wire.<eos> You said you didn't know who was wearing the wire.<eos> I didn't, until today.
Of course, you gunned them down, so now they're everyone's problem.<eos> We hear the bitch lived.<eos> Yeah, unfortunately.<eos> But she is critical and not talking.<eos> And if she does?
Lin will meet us.<eos> All right, good.<eos> Okay, I put Barosky on notice.<eos> He wants another five grand for the personnel.<eos> Of course he does.
Yeah. I might. I might do, Becky.<eos> Russian flu is real.<eos> It's some psychopathic weaponised virus from the '60s... and they're going to release it, did you know that?<eos> - What?<eos> You did?
Um, I just got a call from your grandfather's nursing home.<eos> I guess Gemma's visiting her dad.<eos> Really.<eos> I didn't know that.<eos> Yeah, well I didn't, either.
We shot into the ceiling, just like you said.<eos> I'm not talking about the bank robbery.<eos> I'm talking about the train robbery.<eos> - We didn't actually rob the train.<eos> - Yes, you did.
Okay, great.<eos> All right.<eos> Just, uh, text me the deets.<eos> - They still say that, right?<eos> - They do.
- What's wrong?<eos> - I just learned how to perfectly express myself in 140 characters.<eos> Now I have to condense everything into a 7-second...<eos> - What is it called... "vine"?<eos> - No, Evan, you don't.
When will you be back for the second surgery?<eos> A couple weeks.<eos> I have some business to sort out at home.<eos> Will you miss me?<eos> I already do.
Uh, can I ask you a question?<eos> Mm-hmm. Does it tickle when you kiss?<eos> I guess there's only one way to find out, isn't there?<eos> Yeah. Yeah. You know what?<eos> It actually does a little bit, yeah.
I don't know what you heard, but let me set things straight.<eos> In order to get my job back, I put myself out there as dirty.<eos> I never agreed, nor did I ever report on another cop.<eos> - I know what you're feeling.<eos> - You don't.
It's a nice place you got here.<eos> What brings you out here?<eos> Ah, I'm taking the day off.<eos> Hey, you know what? Good for you. Good for you.<eos> We don't do that enough as a culture.
- Why would he stop?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> - I thought it was helping.<eos> - I know. I did, too.<eos> He just did it.
What the hell is going on here?<eos> It's, uh, it's beautiful.<eos> - You really like it?<eos> - Are you kidding?<eos> Of course she does.
Fine. What is it?<eos> I was... I was wondering if you...<eos> If you wanted to hang out with me and Karma this weekend.<eos> Why? We hate each other.<eos> We do not.
- Yeah, I'm just gonna wait until the next therapy, because, yeah, our shrink was a little late, which started the session out weird.<eos> And then before I even had a chance to say anything,<eos> Barb started talking about how her sister's lupus is affecting her.<eos> Did I tell you that Barb's sister Joni has lupus?<eos> No. Well, she does.
- You seem so wet.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Totally wet.<eos> You want this?<eos> Yeah, I do.
Shell.<eos> We have options.<eos> - Don't say it.<eos> Don't say it.<eos> - We do.
- You okay, you like it?<eos> - Yeah, it's cool.<eos> - Really?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - You really do?
- I want to fuck that chair. - Okay.<eos> Okay.<eos> You ever think about Barb and Len?<eos> Yeah, of course.<eos> Course I do.
How'd you know I'd be here?<eos> Easy, conceited.<eos> I had no idea you'd be here.<eos> - Alex...<eos> - He didn't.
Dr. Will Rush's office.<eos> Did you get the flowers?<eos> It's J.P.<eos> Yes...<eos> I did.
Rush got me out.<eos> The rest doesn't matter.<eos> It does matter.<eos> It matters a lot.<eos> Oh, no... it doesn't.
I always knew I would get a violent death.<eos> But I was not prepared for the humiliation by being killed with knitting needles.<eos> By a Norwegian.<eos> I admire you.<eos> I do it.
Talk to acquire unique expertise in refugee issues.<eos> Sure, but it does not look like there are some who need it, so...<eos> I think you should come and see us and assume bit like consulting assignments.<eos> Are you saying that you are willing to to give me a second chance in the Nav system?<eos> Yes. I do it.
Well, there's only two types of people who travel.. a lot.<eos> Those in the circus and... those on the run, and curiously,<eos> I'm not seeing any funny wigs or face paint.<eos> I know what I'm running from.<eos> Do you?
[Laughs] Well, look at you.<eos> - Yeah. Look at me.<eos> - Who knew you had such excellent taste in cars?<eos> - [Laughs] I thought you would like it.<eos> - I do.
Macalvoy!<eos> Let me go!<eos> I swear I didn't kill him!<eos> Yeah?<eos> Then who did?
He's an oligarch in exile from Crimea.<eos> He hired Frank to retrieve something from Sevastopol.<eos> I don't see a connection, Caterina.<eos> Neither do I but...<eos> Frank does.
Exactly.<eos> You want to create.<eos> You want to express yourself.<eos> You want to break out of who you are and try new things.<eos> Well, I do too.
Hey, I tried to blackmail him.<eos> Mm-hmm, for you.<eos> It didn't work, but... you want to fuck me, Oscar?<eos> What?<eos> You do, right?
- Okay. It's o...<eos> - Wait.<eos> - What? I don't have a car.<eos> - Oh, fuck. - I don't have a fucking car.<eos> - I don't... - Okay.
If I hadn't let him sleep...<eos> Would he be alive now?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Do you believe in heaven, dr.<eos> No, I don't.
Yeah, that's personal.<eos> I get it.<eos> All right.<eos> Well, if you want to talk...<eos> I do.
We had a fight.<eos> That's the biggest thing she ever hid from me.<eos> We're off to the South, to settle her father's affairs.<eos> - I have some in my mouth.<eos> - No, you don't.
I tagged him.<eos> With a flesh wound!<eos> He's marked.<eos> There's nowhere in the world he can go where I can't find him.<eos> And when you do?
Hmph.<eos> With all these lights, your gas bill must be enormous.<eos> Nein, the castle was built on a natural-gas resource.<eos> We have all the gas we need. - Ha, ha.<eos> Yes, you do. Ha, ha. - Ha, ha.
Like the Centers for Disease Control, right here in Atlanta.<eos> [Takes deep breath, crying] Leave him alone.<eos> Let's go.<eos> What did you tell them?<eos> Yes, you did. Yes, you did.
I can't miss my weigh-in.<eos> Emma's pretty great, isn't she?<eos> Yeah, she is.<eos> You know we, uh... Used to be a thing?<eos> No, no, I didn't.
Officers, don't talk to my client, and you... I don't like that tone.<eos> - I hired you.<eos> - Uh, excuse me, officers.<eos> Does this ad possibly say, "lonely, bi-man seeks special boy, 12, for deep friendship in Manhattan"?<eos> It does.
When did this happen?<eos> When did you meet her?<eos> How did you meet her?<eos> It doesn't matter.<eos> I just did.
I'm here to tell you that I know you know the truth about Louis' resignation.<eos> I don't know...<eos> Yes, you do, and I'm guessing you didn't like it.<eos> You're right.<eos> I didn't.
"Oh, no," what?<eos> You have that look on your face like you want me to have some emotional conversation I don't feel like having.<eos> You know what, Harvey?<eos> I just came in here to see if you needed anything.<eos> - I don't.
- Hmm. - What?<eos> Oh, I'm just tryin' to figure out at what point in the last week you decided to become a pussy.<eos> Oh, so doing something nice for someone makes you a pussy?<eos> - I didn't say that exactly.<eos> - Yes, you did.
I want this place to look like a damn orphanage.<eos> And when your womb gives out, we're gonna fly around the world.<eos> We're gonna collect them like stamps... like precious, little, lovable stamps.<eos> I knew it!<eos> You did?
- Mm-hmm.<eos> ...the first time.<eos> How long, David?<eos> How long have you been pretending to hate stuff that you actually love?<eos> - I don't...
Welcome to the Yurt.<eos> Perfect.<eos> So, where do I start?<eos> Oh, I don't think we have any medical issues at the moment.<eos> We rarely do, actually.
Actually, I'm not sure what they are.<eos> But I care about you, Erin.<eos> I care about you, too.<eos> I just need you to understand that...<eos> I do. I do.
And after that, we said it would never come to this again.<eos> How the hell did it?<eos> We stepped into the ring with Charles Forstman.<eos> I'm guessing he didn't budge last night.<eos> He didn't.
I'm guessing he didn't budge last night.<eos> He didn't.<eos> He sheltered himself, and he'd rather laugh in my face than be 100% protected against the S.E.C.<eos> You have a plan "B"?<eos> He doesn't, but I do.
I'm not sure you do.<eos> You're angry.<eos> You're scared.<eos> You want to get things on an even keel, controllable, knowable, calm.<eos> Okay, maybe you do.
Can we get her a lighter sandwich?<eos> - Where's the food stylist?<eos> - Right away.<eos> Oh, hello. I thought you left.<eos> I did.
So, what?<eos> Do you think I'm a bad person?<eos> I think you did a bad thing.<eos> Doing one bad thing doesn't make you a bad person.<eos> But what if I did, like, a lot of bad things?
You just became him!<eos> You became everything we suffered ignorance and brutality to change, that people died to overcome.<eos> You're the one who bought the lie.<eos> You believed that they had all the power.<eos> You still do.
!<eos> Are you there?<eos> They don't want you to know the truth.<eos> They don't want you to know who you are.<eos> Who doesn't?
Pull up a chair.<eos> - Holy crap.<eos> - I know, right?<eos> - This is killing me. - I hope it does.<eos> - I really do.
Tell me what you did to stop an attack that canonized a terrorist and wiped out my entire station.<eos> It wasn't an attack. It was a goddamn coup.<eos> You think I want these people running Pakistan?<eos> - You tell me.<eos> - I don't.
Baby, are you okay?<eos> Are you sure you want to do this?<eos> I want to.<eos> I do want to.<eos> You do?
I swear.<eos> That's the whole purpose of Chauvenet.<eos> It's anonymous.<eos> I have no idea who Papa Legba is.<eos> Nobody does.
He doesn't understand a word we're saying.<eos> It's a tactic.<eos> If we think he doesn't speak English, we won't expect him to tell us anything.<eos> Due respect sir, then why do we expect him to lead us to his commander and not into a trap?<eos> We don't.
Losing you, the others, the war, it changed him.<eos> He executed the Grounder that drew us the map.<eos> Pulled the trigger without even blinking and walked away.<eos> That doesn't sound like Finn.<eos> No, it doesn't.
Now we'll make sweet music together, and she won't be able to deny her feelings for me.<eos> But it's supposed to be you and me!<eos> It is just you and me... and them.<eos> You know what would be so cool?<eos> If we did an all-acoustic set.
Amazing!<eos> - You love me so much!<eos> Oh!<eos> - I really do.<eos> I really do.
I can't really tell if you're purposely being contemptuous, of maybe you are unstable.<eos> Well, if you dismissed every government worker who was unstable,<eos> Washington would cease to exist.<eos> Giving these responses, how do you expect me to approve you?<eos> I don't.
You ready?<eos> Even if you can save Lincoln... he won't be the same.<eos> The things he's done... they'll stay with him.<eos> We don't know that.<eos> Yes, we do.
Please.<eos> You're right.<eos> I must stop calling you "my little turkey".<eos> You're too big, now.<eos> But what to do?
Have the gallows constructed in the town square.<eos> A public execution?<eos> Transparency, Judge. Followed by a strict adherence to the law.<eos> A death warrant should be drawn up.<eos> Do it.
And you know it.<eos> You got a dark heart to go with that widow's dress.<eos> I see you've cleaned yourself up for the occasion.<eos> And you look fetching in black.<eos> Don't she, Ling?
Contestants must craft an undercover persona and talk to as many police officers as you can before being recognized.<eos> Pregnant.<eos> Nice.<eos> Means you had sex.<eos> Damn right I did.
Who told you we were there?<eos> Medical examiner just called.<eos> He needs to see you, stat.<eos> How do we know we can trust her?<eos> We don't.
I don't know Covington.<eos> I was approached by an associate I don't know his name... about providing him with viable material.<eos> You deal with bodies.<eos> I thought donor organs had to be fresh.<eos> They do.
They said it was just like the first one.<eos> I... I don't know.<eos> Uh, but we went to Delancey's afterwards.<eos> And I'm not sure how the subject came up, exactly, but it turns out that Jeff thought I would be nuts to skip college this semester.<eos> - Did he?
Deedee, what are you doing with Dad's keys? Put those back.<eos> Oh, come on, that's Dad's truck. Dad's chum is in the back.<eos> No! No, no, no!<eos> Sucka dick,dumbshits!<eos> Well, that crazy clam did it.
Hey, thanks for listening to all this.<eos> You're a really good friend, Todd.<eos> Since you weren't able to give me any useful intel,<eos> I had to offer up my restaurant, but now, we're on my turf.<eos> Time for operation "I don't."
What?<eos> Because Sarah Lynn said the thing about Hulk Hogan?<eos> That was like four hours ago.<eos> Oh, uh, right.<eos> - How we doing now?
Probably what?<eos> Mature stage multicell cluster.<eos> It's just rain.<eos> I like rain.<eos> Who doesn't?
Mature stage multicell cluster.<eos> It's just rain.<eos> I like rain.<eos> Who doesn't?<eos> Well, cats don't.
It's just rain.<eos> I like rain.<eos> Who doesn't?<eos> Well, cats don't.<eos> And snakes don't.
Charlie was the editor of The Harvard Lampoon.<eos> He can be Princess Carolyn's new assistant while I use Laura.<eos> - Ugh. - Good thinking, boss.<eos> Ah, ah, phone is ringing. Phone is ringing.<eos> What do I do?
Those kids couldn't have killed Sam.<eos> They couldn't even get off the island, 'cause Sam had their only boat.<eos> And you and Carrie believe their story?<eos> Jay's looking for the boat to confirm it,<eos> - but, yes, we do.
I'm at peace with it. - Seems like an angry peace.<eos> Look, with everything that's going on,<eos> Hank, Emma, the board, if you want to keep talking to Bob- what?<eos> No, I don't.<eos> I don't, okay?
A degree in what?<eos> - Theater. - Mm.<eos> - I'm sorry if you feel deceived.<eos> - You know what?<eos> I don't.
- Seriously though, I just walked out on Boris.<eos> You think he's pissed?<eos> What are we gonna do if he's pissed?<eos> - I'm sure we'll figure something out.<eos> We always do, right?
Rusty?<eos> Permanently?<eos> I gave you the greatest gift, didn't I?<eos> - You did, you did.<eos> - I really did.
- I'd what?<eos> Punish you?<eos> Look, I've done tons of stupid I'm not proud of either.<eos> But if you really want to make this work...<eos> Oh, of course I do.
Mrs. Blithely?<eos> This light... The way you're standing, you look... you look like my stepmother must have when she was young.<eos> Does she, Thomas?<eos> When mother was a girl?<eos> No, she does not.
It's all organic.<eos> This looks so damn good.<eos> You know, I know that resistance helped you to get out and that herr Meisner was instrumental - in the orchestration. - Uhhuh.<eos> So how did he know our people were waiting for you?<eos> He didn't.
I guess you don't think it's out of the question.<eos> And what, you think I did it?<eos> I didn't say that.<eos> But did you? No.<eos> Well, who did?
We needed a break.<eos> Maybe we finally got one.<eos> Right on time.<eos> Saul.<eos> What do I do?
Quit your mewling.<eos> He's going to fall.<eos> My baby!<eos> Don't much like drinking alone.<eos> Nobody does, Captain.
Hello?<eos> Are you even listening to me?<eos> Yes, totally.<eos> I just listen better when I have<eos> - something to do with my mouth. - So, what do you
Sorry. (laughs)<eos> It's okay.<eos> You go to work.<eos> I see what you did there.<eos> I did.
Well, I'm sorry for your loss, Ms. Meadows.<eos> Thanks for your time. Yeah.<eos> How was your meeting with the principal?<eos> According to her, everyone just loved good old Mr. Messner.<eos> Until someone didn't.
How was your meeting with the principal?<eos> According to her, everyone just loved good old Mr. Messner.<eos> Until someone didn't.<eos> We need our, uh, bunny suits?<eos> I did a sweep.
It's not what you think.<eos> What did she want then?<eos> The cops were at the cemetery, why?<eos> - Who knows?<eos> I don't!
Has it crossed your mind that I decide what will happen to you, not your uncle?<eos> There's no unemployment in Italy?<eos> Let me give you some advice.<eos> If you don't want to be out of work you have to abide by our rules.<eos> But you don't.
It's a sniper rifle. Huh.<eos> Pardon me.<eos> Uh, just one quick question.<eos> - You went to S.H.I.E.L.D. academy, right?<eos> - You didn't.
I am very sorry, Agent May.<eos> Don't be sorry.<eos> Just wait.<eos> Uh, we just have a little wager.<eos> - Uh, so, did you...?
Gary's had more opportunities handed to him in his life than I've had hot dinners.<eos> And he's pissed them all away.<eos> Gary's is a life wasted.<eos> B'hoah Shlomoh, kvosh et hahosheh.<eos> All done.
She's a tough bird, that one.<eos> I'm talking about Astra.<eos> There's something I need to tell you, John.<eos> About Newcastle.<eos> Gaz, you don't...
And I knew you were high.<eos> We all did.<eos> The thing is, Gaz...<eos> I don't blame you.<eos> I never did.
You know, your son is a really great guy.<eos> Every night when I fall asleep on the sofa, he carries me to bed.<eos> Well, he tries to, and then he just drags me by the leg.<eos> You think I don't know my son is great?<eos> Of course I do.
He made contingencies.<eos> Oliver, if you fight Ra's al Ghul, he'll kill you.<eos> No, he won't.<eos> During the Undertaking, Merlyn told me that I couldn't win, because I didn't know what I was fighting for.<eos> Now I do.
I see the years have done little to dull your stubbornness.<eos> Maseo...<eos> My name is Sarab!<eos> You told me once a man cannot live by two names.<eos> And I don't.
Under our code, you have 12 hours to settle your affairs.<eos> The 13th hour, be at this place.<eos> This location is consecrated ground for the League.<eos> A place for the settlement of blood debts-- if one survives the climb.<eos> If you do.
Every single time I put on that mask, I feel like a fraud.<eos> You--<eos> You have to give this time.<eos> If you want to talk about it--<eos> I don't.
You look beautiful.<eos> I think it's the dress.<eos> The dress is actually missing something.<eos> Oh, no, I forgot to do up the zipper again?<eos> I always do that.
Oh, and now you believe him?<eos> I haven't decided yet!<eos> Do you know that you're training with a vigilante?<eos> Former, apparently.<eos> And no, I didn't.
I haven't decided yet!<eos> Do you know that you're training with a vigilante?<eos> Former, apparently.<eos> And no, I didn't.<eos> I didn't!
My husband's a great guy and a wonderful father, and we used to work together... no problem.<eos> But ever since I became the accounts manager, which made me his boss, we've been having problems, and how do you handle that?<eos> Well, I never worked with my husband.<eos> I can imagine.<eos> No, but you do work with my dad.
Well, I think it's best if we wait for the others.<eos> I don't bite, Congressman.<eos> Unless, of course, I'm provoked.<eos> I prefer to have everything on the record, Ms. Lange.<eos> Of course you do.
Wow.<eos> I did not see that coming.<eos> I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> You know exactly what I'm talking about.<eos> Uh, no, I don't.
Yeah, well... practice is gonna have to wait.<eos> Why do you want to talk to me?<eos> We've got a photograph of you fleeing a mugging near the Vietnam Memorial last Friday, wearing this backpack.<eos> You mind if we search it?<eos> Yeah... yeah, I do.
About six years.<eos> She joined us just after she got out of the Navy.<eos> Courtney's a systems analyst.<eos> With her military background, our clients love her.<eos> You do a lot of government work.
Yes. I took 'em myself.<eos> Give me that.<eos> Oh... This gentleman Has both his original central incisors.<eos> Is that a problem?<eos> Angus didn't.
I'm sure angus was satisfied with your work.<eos> His standards weren't very high.<eos> I mean...<eos> I'm-I'm sorry, gareth, I-I need to have a word in private with maggie.<eos> You don't!
Explains the blood spray.<eos> Well, the carotid artery acts, quite literally, as a spigot.<eos> No buttons, no timers, just... on.<eos> Once the motor starts, it doesn't stop.<eos> Well, apparently, that one did.
- I'm good.<eos> I like a girl.<eos> Really?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - You do like a girl?
You'll learn how to do that.<eos> You just toed the line.<eos> That is how you-- I got to take notes.<eos> - Hey, you want another one?<eos> - I certainly do.
Seriously, did you punch yourself?<eos> Rafael, stop.<eos> You and I both know what happened.<eos> No.<eos> We don't.
- That's right<eos> All present and correct<eos> That's the heart<eos> - Do you want to hear it?<eos> - Yeah. I do
Not fast enough, Flash.<eos> - Who are you?<eos> - You know who I am, Barry.<eos> I don't know who you are.<eos> But you do, Barry.
So nobody else gets hurt.<eos> Can you do that?<eos> And The Flash?<eos> Do you know who he is?<eos> Yeah, I do.
Charlie-0-5-Sanders!<eos> Are you there?<eos> CSI Finlay, I need you to surrender your firearm.<eos> I know the drill.<eos> Yes, you do.
My luck's already turned, right?<eos> Dude, anyone ever tell you when you walk, you look just like a penguin?<eos> Nobody's ever told me that.<eos> He's saying he has a right to stop me from beating on a mope.<eos> Damn right I do.
Looks like... the snitches get bumped.<eos> That's life.<eos> But they're not going to get away with it, not as easy as they think.<eos> You take things too personally, you know that?<eos> Yeah, I do.
He was, like, so excited and happy about it, and, you know, it's...<eos> I don't know. It's confusing for me.<eos> It's weird being here.<eos> Like, seeing him, and... it's hard for me to see him again, and... yeah, I mean, he was... seemed like he was kind of a mess to me, I mean.<eos> Oh, I don't...
Alicia, I'm tired. I need you to take over for me.<eos> Never say such a thing.<eos> I don't know why he'd say that.<eos> I never heard him say such a thing.<eos> No, I-I did...
I know... you guys made a fortune.<eos> Give me half the money. Otherwise ... I'll perform your story... every day in front of the Division office.<eos> Xiu ... what fortune?<eos> There's no such thing. Sir Zhao. You know who I am?<eos> Who doesn't in this town?
Wait, um...<eos> What's changing?<eos> I thought we were good.<eos> Yes, but it all changes, Alex.<eos> It always does.
Of course, it proves that he does really know about your, um... Condition.<eos> You're right.<eos> He knows everything about me, which means he knows about you.<eos> Well, so?<eos> So what if he does?
You were coveted by a very important man.<eos> A man that I need to keep happy.<eos> So, now for both of our sakes,<eos> I need you to tell me that you didn't tell anybody anything.<eos> I didn't.
Paint a picture.<eos> She'll see.<eos> This is how you answer the door?<eos> Only when it's a dude I don't care about.<eos> Or a girl I do.
I just wish he was awake to meet you guys.<eos> You would love Johnny.<eos> I mean, everybody did.<eos> I can't believe I just said that.<eos> Everybody does.
You want to play fairy fucking godfather?<eos> Get me an eight-ball of blow, some strippers, and show me how you ball, man.<eos> - I know you be balling. - Johnny. Johnny.<eos> - We can't do that.<eos> - I don't even do blow.
If I could not forgive, then I would be truly handicapped. What?<eos> It's from the book, Peter.<eos> What book?<eos> I forgive you, Peter.<eos> You do?
I'm just saying, you probably have an itchy ankle under that cast.<eos> It starts as a tickle and then you can't quite reach it? Not gonna work, Stewie.<eos> Yes, you're right. Best not to think about it.<eos> Even though it might be a little bug digging away down there, just nagging and itching and...<eos> Ah, ah, crap, I did it to myself!
That's a very nice gift, Danny.<eos> Hey, it's a loan.<eos> See you later.<eos> Have a good day.<eos> You didn't, uh...
Nah, there's more to it than that.<eos> You went through great lying lengths to keep me around.<eos> What lies?<eos> Oh, that's funny you should ask.<eos> I didn't.
Oh, Mom.<eos> She meant to have you two leave this place together.<eos> But when the time came, she realized only one could escape. So she let you go.<eos> She loved me.<eos> My mother did, too.
What's going on?<eos> I can't keep being the lost human in the Fae world trying to be Fae.<eos> I'm not Fae.<eos> That has never mattered to me.<eos> But it does to me.
Riley.<eos> Hey!<eos> Riley!<eos> You think the dog's trying to tell us something?<eos> Yeah, I do.
You could call a friend.<eos> Are we?<eos> Still friends?<eos> I need a favor.<eos> I don't do favors for the White House anymore.
What did you think was going to happen?<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Did you think I'd want you back?<eos> Don't flatter yourself, Robin.<eos> You did, didn't you?
That little girl you took, she's not my daughter.<eos> I know. My brother-in-law grabbed the wrong girl, but it didn't matter.<eos> I knew as soon you heard 1.6 million, you'd do whatever I said before you'd admit to killing my daughter.<eos> You have to believe me, I never meant for that to happen.<eos> But it did.
I...<eos> I asked Dad if I could use his credit card.<eos> Did he know what you were buying with it?<eos> - God, Mum!<eos> - Did he?
- But you'll make this one exception.<eos> Hey.<eos> Hm!<eos> I don't like you leaving the back door unlocked.<eos> I didn't.
- Jesse.<eos> - Hey.<eos> What's goin' on?<eos> Come in.<eos> Well, why doesn't he?
- No.<eos> Jesse, don't. Don't.<eos> Why are you with me?<eos> I didn't have a choice.<eos> I did!
Jesse, don't. Don't.<eos> Why are you with me?<eos> I didn't have a choice.<eos> I did!<eos> I did.
Why are you with me?<eos> I didn't have a choice.<eos> I did!<eos> I did.<eos> I did.
I didn't have a choice.<eos> I did!<eos> I did.<eos> I did.<eos> I did.
Well, you do make me staple everything on a diagonal two centimeters from the top left... It gives the strongest hold.<eos> And you did put a password on our DVR player because<eos> - I don't know how to manage Sunday nights.<eos> - How to manage Sunday nights.<eos> You don't.
You told Zelda.<eos> Zelda told Stephie.<eos> Now Stephie's using it to pretend to be some kind of psychic at me.<eos> I don't know what a Geronimo is.<eos> He didn't.
It should be...<eos> Nobody knows what you're talking about.<eos> I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> You don't know what I'm talking about?<eos> You don't.
Noted.<eos> People who get on the U.N.O.S. list are not just people who need the organ.<eos> It's people who the board feels will take care of the organ.<eos> Do you know who's on this board?<eos> I do, indeed, yeah.
We give up.<eos> - You just tell the parents to give up?<eos> - Don't talk to me like that.<eos> You don't think that this kills me, too?<eos> Actually, I don't.
When I had my first surgery, he was there, playing with this...<eos> Little creature... An origami thing, and...<eos> Oh, I know that completely sounds like I was high, but...<eos> You got to believe me.<eos> I do.
I didn't think you'd want me to.<eos> We're gonna need it as evidence.<eos> - When did you find it?<eos> - I didn't.<eos> Rosalee did.
As children, the three girls were quite close, often seen playing together in the royal gardens.<eos> But then, one day, Helga and Ingrid vanished.<eos> No one ever knew what happened to them.<eos> It was a tragedy the royal family wanted to forget.<eos> And they did, with my help.
This scroll... the writing is runic.<eos> It's a prophecy.<eos> It says, "the name of the savior is Emma."<eos> She knew?<eos> Before you even did.
They're both attached to electrical leads.<eos> Which probably lead to a power supply controlled by a computer.<eos> That countdown started at one hour.<eos> - Whichever brother has the least votes gets his heart stopped.<eos> Or they both do.
He said he wanted to be together, but where was he?<eos> Hey.<eos> Have you guys seen Matty?<eos> - No.<eos> - I did.
Look, no offense, but you got to find<eos> - someplace else to say.<eos> - I totally get it.<eos> I appreciate you guys helping me.<eos> Really, I do.
== sync, corrected by elderman == @elder_man<eos> He followed me for, like, two blocks.<eos> I couldn't just shut the door on him.<eos> I didn't think you liked cats.<eos> I don't.
You'll just have to trust us.<eos> WOMAN:<eos> This is a big tent firm, Erin.<eos> Yes, we handle hard-core crime cases, but we also have attorneys on everything from the Keystone Pipeline to defending the civil liberties of the Guantanamo Three.<eos> We also do incredible pro Bono work with the Innocence Project.
- He's next!<eos> Hey, stranger.<eos> Ooh, it is taking every ounce of self-control I have not to block this.<eos> It's like I want people to be happy.<eos> But on the other hand, no, I don't.
And if he ever had the clap.<eos> Oh, sorry, sir.<eos> Uh, no, Henry, please, join me.<eos> Thought you had a private bathroom - in your office.<eos> - Oh, I do. I do.
No, I don't.<eos> I hate it.<eos> But it's what I'm good at, and it's what I have to do.<eos> You don't have to save everyone.<eos> Yes, I do.
- TBD.<eos> - TBD, TBD.<eos> Hailey,<eos> I told you not to let me go in.<eos> Didn't I? Eh?
That's me.<eos> Is this fun or what?<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> Your dad is dating Trashley Berkman?<eos> - Didn't she... ? - Yes.
Why are we meeting in a parking garage?<eos> Because what we are doing is unsavory<eos> - and we're hiding from God.<eos> - And you also... you promised Winston and everybody pizza, so...<eos> Yeah, you definitely did.
I don't love this tableau.<eos> Is that Gloria's gift to me?<eos> What is it?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Sure you do.
Shall I go on?<eos> Says last night, you claimed he harassed you by phone, followed you to class, incited arguments.<eos> The dude broke into our house.<eos> We don't know that.<eos> - Yes, we do.
They even come with a soundtrack.<eos> But Roberta Flack?<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> Your life has a soundtrack, Ben.<eos> No, it doesn't.
Maybe when the money and the favors dried up, you decided to make her pay.<eos> I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> Really?<eos> Because I have a video of you assaulting her in a parking garage.<eos> No, you don't.
I'm still angry.<eos> Of course you are.<eos> No one lets go all at once.<eos> You might have to do it 1,000 times before it gets any easier.<eos> But it will.
Close your eyes.<eos> How did you just become more beautiful in 20 seconds?<eos> Do you want to kiss me?<eos> Yeah, but I don't know how.<eos> You will.
Others before me may have felt it was their destiny... but I am Danny Rand.<eos> And I'm the Iron Fist.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I wish you could understand.<eos> I never will.
I'm scared.<eos> I know you say that I'm enough.<eos> But there are certain things that you are used to getting that I will never, ever, ever be able to give you.<eos> And it might be fine for right now, but what's gonna happen when you start needing them again?<eos> I won't.
For whom?<eos> We have no idea who they are, who they pretend to be.<eos> It's been 12 hours!<eos> He will break.<eos> No, he won't.
That's amazing.<eos> Besides, we're right behind you.<eos> When we get back from our trip we're gonna meet with an adoption agency.<eos> - Just don't say anything.<eos> - No, I won't.
♪ ♪ You couldn't have stopped Ben from taking that deal?<eos> It was his decision.<eos> And it's not my case anymore... because I got promoted this morning.<eos> We should celebrate.<eos> Oh, we will.
'Cause that's so much better.<eos> You guys, I'm trying to have friends, you know, like you guys are always talking about.<eos> Sweetie, your friends are not going to like or dislike you for a car.<eos> Mom, it's high school.<eos> Of course they will.
I want you to do what you want to do.<eos> Whatever's going to make this better for you, if anything can.<eos> But I'm not gonna lie.<eos> I want him to pay for what he did.<eos> Will he, though?
Before she died...<eos> Hannah recorded 13 reasons why she killed herself.<eos> And you're number 13.<eos> And everyone who comes before you on these tapes knows what you did and didn't do.<eos> And they always will.
Are you ready if this goes south?<eos> It won't.<eos> If it does, you don't need to feel bad.<eos> I do feel bad.<eos> I will.
- He's a friend.<eos> - Yes, sorry.<eos> The friend. Where is he?<eos> - Dad, don't say anything.<eos> - I won't.
Stop.<eos> Sorry, she didn't mean that.<eos> She just likes to blurt things out.<eos> You're gonna have a very healthy and happy life in front of you.<eos> - No, Booth, he will not.
I think that Grunwald is starting to rub off on me.<eos> Well, I'm not gonna challenge the logic in that.<eos> Noel's dead, but Jenna's still out there.<eos> - I mean, we have to find her.<eos> - We will.
Yeah, maybe.<eos> But we keep trying.<eos> So we'd beat on boats against the current.<eos> We will get out of here.<eos> We will.
Sorry to me?<eos> For what?<eos> Don't you dare apologize for being with me.<eos> And don't you dare forget it, any of it.<eos> 'Cause I won't.
We here at Fillmore-Graves are preparing for D-Day.<eos> Discovery Day, the day when humans, en masse, learn of our existence.<eos> What do you think happens then, Liv?<eos> I thought it would be in our best interests if it didn't get out.<eos> Maybe it won't, but it probably will.
Once you dilute it, there is enough here to cure every infected person in Gotham.<eos> Oswald, you and I will rule this city together.<eos> OSWALD: Yes. But first, I have to kill Ed Nygma.<eos> He has to die.<eos> MOONEY: Oh, he will.
Once the time paradox catches up with him, then... he'll be erased from existence.<eos> But I saw him.<eos> He didn't disappear.<eos> - Not yet.<eos> - But he will, Joe.
I've always appreciated you doing the salmon ladder but never as much as in this moment.<eos> I got about 5 feet of slack.<eos> I can make it.<eos> Oliver, if you don't...<eos> I will.
Hey, you could fit in that one if you were gonna fit in one.<eos> I haven't fixed it yet, but...<eos> But I guess that doesn't matter right now.<eos> - I don't see anybody.<eos> - You won't.
You seem troubled.<eos> I hope it was not the encounter with your manservant.<eos> If this is my destiny,<eos> I do not want to fail.<eos> You won't, Bruce.
Can't watch him be happy.<eos> And it's really hard for me to say that I won't be there with you.<eos> Because you know I would do anything for you.<eos> I can't do that to myself.<eos> I won't.
Lucifer, I told you no hospitals.<eos> How am I supposed to find the antidote if I'm laying here...<eos> We'll take it from here.<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, we will.
Alright, lads?<eos> Come on, let's play. -You alright?<eos> (MEN CHATTER)<eos> Can't let him do it again.<eos> The rest of us won't. Oi!
It's just, I want you with me.<eos> I don't think that this town is safe anymore.<eos> I feel like Riverdale is getting ready to slide off of a mountainside, and I don't want you anywhere around when that happens.<eos> Just promise me you'll at least think about it.<eos> Yeah, I will.
Danny Nasiri had a good life, a loving family.<eos> I don't believe a kid like that would self-radicalize.<eos> Why do people from Ferguson, Baltimore, and Milwaukee burn down their own neighborhoods?<eos> I honestly don't know.<eos> And you never will.
And it's important to me that you know that.<eos> [Chuckles]<eos> [Inhales deeply]<eos> Okay. [Laughs]<eos> And nothing ever will.
Yes.<eos> It has.<eos> She's a disease.<eos> I regret my role in spreading it.<eos> You will, too.
Not many people have.<eos> Why would He leave Heaven? What's He thinking?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Well, I hope you find him.<eos> I will.
Violet tells me there's not a soul in Quigley's house tonight.<eos> Place is like a morgue.<eos> Give the man money, Mr. Haxby.<eos> A coin for a gentleman!<eos> I will not.
I think you're a liar.<eos> 'Cause you said we would find Hannah.<eos> You will find her.<eos> No.<eos> We will.
Let me start by doing the right thing.<eos> Report back to work, Agent Danvers.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> I hope one day we get him back.<eos> We will.
Yeah.<eos> He's a great DP.<eos> You'll be happy you stuck around to get him.<eos> Yeah, as long as we have the deal in place by the time he leaves for Prague Sunday night.<eos> You will.
And who was there to see that it was not?<eos> He as much as told me.<eos> Killed his brother cos he'd fallen for you.<eos> I don't believe you. Oh.<eos> But others will.
They have to be broken in other ways.<eos> But make no mistake... they have to be broken.<eos> Many inmates have tried to make a fool of me over the years.<eos> None have succeeded.<eos> And none ever will.
- Take me with you.<eos> You know I can't do that.<eos> You've got a life here, a family.<eos> I want to see the future.<eos> You will.
All right.<eos> We'll see how your friend does with the Traugott guard.<eos> But someone...<eos> Someone has to pay for this.<eos> And they will, but not with their lives.
She'll come around and see how special you are.<eos> Clarke...<eos> If I don't see you again...<eos> No.<eos> You will.
I also knew this is how they got you to confess to Nassar's murder.<eos> Jason, take your statement back.<eos> Tell me everything you know.<eos> Listen to me, if they know - that I'm cooperating with you...<eos> - They won't.
He's my boss.<eos> Everyone answers to a higher authority, Miss Clark.<eos> What about my team?<eos> I am preparing a new, more trustworthy team for you, so the work of the Stitchers Program will continue.<eos> No, it won't, not without me.
Look, we have feelings for each other, of course we do, but... is it worth losing a war over?<eos> So that's it then?<eos> I think it has to be.<eos> I'll see you tomorrow?<eos> Yes, you will.
Time to spread your wings. Focus on your art, your music.<eos> You have a gift, baby.<eos> You have so many beautiful futures in front of you.<eos> Make sure you pick a good one for me, okay?<eos> I will.
Us.<eos> That's how Olivia knew.<eos> Everything is on that document.<eos> - If anyone else sees it...<eos> - They won't.
I'm busy.<eos> I want to go out with you.<eos> Meredith.<eos> Stop.<eos> No. I won't.
I don't know what to say.<eos> I mean, how do I even...<eos> I don't know what...<eos> I don't know what to say<eos> You will.
I don't understand.<eos> Why does he think that... that killing Emma with this blade will make him the Savior?<eos> He's not the first one to think wielding that sword would make him a hero.<eos> We have to find him before he gets his hands on it, before he goes after Emma again.<eos> We will.
Are all these Peter Gregory's notebooks? Um...<eos> - Are they?<eos> Are they in this box? - Richard.<eos> Remember, you promised you were gonna get some sleep tonight.<eos> Yeah, I will.
I didn't mean it.<eos> - Walk away from this.<eos> - I can't.<eos> You can.<eos> You just won't.
How are you gonna handle things then?<eos> I...<eos> You have to think about that.<eos> I know you don't want to hurt us, but it can happen without you even realizing. You wouldn't even know you've said it.<eos> All right, all right, I'll just--
Well, I think I can handle you, Uncle Albert.<eos> Good choice.<eos> I like him.<eos> Well, I'll see you on the dance floor.<eos> Yes, you will.
Always did like to storm out.<eos> I should go too.<eos> I should be there for my people, whatever happens.<eos> You mean in case I fail?<eos> You won't.
No.<eos> Never.<eos> Missy!<eos> I will never stand with the Doctor!<eos> Yes, my dear, you will.
No. Hey! You can eat after.<eos> ¿Después de qué?<eos> You promised you'd have the 50 grand.<eos> I know, I know.<eos> I will...
- Would you like a piece?<eos> - Oh, no, no thank you.<eos> Clearly, I hate gum.<eos> - I'll take some.<eos> - No, she won't!
I don't know when I'm coming back, so I don't know if it's fair to ask you to wait for me.<eos> Jack...<eos> I would wait an eternity for you.<eos> Elizabeth Thatcher... will you marry me?<eos> Of course I will!
You're not the only one.<eos> What is she gonna do when he's gone?<eos> What are we gonna do?<eos> I'm really gonna miss him.<eos> We all will.
And all I hear the patients say is,<eos> "Ow!<eos> That's my tongue!"<eos> Okay, but, like, so, I find someone who's willing to hire me, then I show up on my first day, and... how will I know what I'm supposed to do? !<eos> Oh, you won't.
Paola just reminded me of the helplessness that I felt when I lost Brad.<eos> Of course.<eos> If we can find out who did this to Drew, it's gonna give her closure, allow her to move on.<eos> I hope we can do that.<eos> We will.
Please, just think about it.<eos> Think about the evidence.<eos> I know. Scratch dots his Is and crosses his Ts.<eos> We know that.<eos> But a jury won't.
They knew what it took to stop them.<eos> We knew lines had to be crossed.<eos> You have betrayed every oath that you have ever taken.<eos> Once all this is over, you're gonna pay for everything you've done.<eos> Everyone will, Alex.
And, um...<eos> I have all the help that I need.<eos> It's not you.<eos> What happens when he changes his mind?<eos> He won't!
I have all the help that I need.<eos> It's not you.<eos> What happens when he changes his mind?<eos> He won't!<eos> He will.
You keep blaming yourselves.<eos> It's not your fault.<eos> There's nothing you could have changed.<eos> We know, but that doesn't mean we're gonna let you f-face it on your own.<eos> And you won't.
I was, like, "I guess I'll open it."<eos> Which, by the way, isn't in the commercials.<eos> It's not like, "Listen to music.<eos> Take selfies.<eos> Open wills."
My anger has blinded me for too long.<eos> I'm so sorry I misjudged you.<eos> You've proven, it's not what's in your blood. It's who you are that counts.<eos> Please come back to us.<eos> I will.
What I came here for...<eos> Start the final battle.<eos> But worry not.<eos> You won't be around to regret your mistake much longer.<eos> No one will.
How did he find us?<eos> All right, look.<eos> If Tito sent this guy to get the kid, he's not gonna fire that thing in here.<eos> So we've got time.<eos> He will.
The last time I handled an asset, it... it didn't end well.<eos> This time, it will.<eos> Be careful.<eos> In case I don't come back, I...<eos> You will.
This time, it will.<eos> Be careful.<eos> In case I don't come back, I...<eos> You will.<eos> You will.
How'd it go on your end?<eos> The night that Fred Kirby disappeared, nobody saw anything.<eos> So, whatever happened here, maybe they finished it with a gun.<eos> Anybody find any slugs or casings?<eos> No, and they won't.
They were like, "This thing's got bad juju, get it off our hands", you know.<eos> But of course, the final piece of inanimate set decoration, is you, the audience.<eos> A collection of comedy nerds and theater dorks and... [laughs] children whose parents have made a severe miscalculation.<eos> All of you gathered together, wondering if there will be an intermission.<eos> There will not!
No shit.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Yeah, man.<eos> And tell your wife... I'm sorry.<eos> I will.
Clean up what?<eos> Clean up the studio.<eos> Destroy everything.<eos> What if we need that stuff?<eos> We won't.
So if you're gonna walk out of the convention, then you just do it right now!<eos> But if not, then I expect to see your bright and shiny faces wearing your big "All the way with LBJ" hats tonight when I take the stage.<eos> Bird, go away and leave me be.<eos> I can't do that, Lyndon.<eos> I won't.
Here, let's have a look.<eos> Oh, you'll survive.<eos> Rinse that with cold water and put a compress on it. You'll be fine.<eos> I didn't know what to do.<eos> Well, next time, you will.
Interesting.<eos> I didn't mention she was a woman.<eos> We'll show ourselves out.<eos> I hope to see you again in the morning.<eos> You will not.
A simple exchange of information.<eos> Julie Mao was one of ours.<eos> I want to find out what happened to her just as much as you do.<eos> You think a man like Filat Kothari deserves to walk free?<eos> Because he will.
Okay, I understand.<eos> Thank you, Paul.<eos> Yeah, sure thing.<eos> Give Joe my regards, all right?<eos> - I will.
Sure.<eos> This the same girl who was over at the house?<eos> No. That was sylvie, and this is Sandy.<eos> They don't know about each other, so, uh, please don't say anything in case it comes up.<eos> I won't.
Okay, talk soon.<eos> She asked if you'd like to join her to an American Embassy reception this evening.<eos> - Was that her?<eos> - Yes, she's still in the meeting.<eos> When she will.
More intelligent than men according to some maesters.<eos> They have affection for their friends and fury for their enemies.<eos> - I am their friend.<eos> - Do they know that?<eos> They will.
How's your mother's jaw?<eos> Better.<eos> And your father?<eos> No one's seen him.<eos> And no one will.
Do you ever...<eos> Do you ever wish you hadn't broken it off with Tom?<eos> No. We're much better suited as friends.<eos> And hopefully we'll both find other people one day.<eos> Of course you will, Trixie.
- I'm not finished. - Yes, you are.<eos> - Hey, Counselor.<eos> - Aw, don't jinx me, Pop.<eos> I haven't even passed the bar yet.<eos> Oh, you will.
I ain't no barber.<eos> What about you?<eos> Another question for another time, my man.<eos> We gotta figure out something soon either way.<eos> I will.
If that's what you wanna call it.<eos> He would want you to have his apartment upstairs.<eos> Uh, especially since your crib blew up.<eos> I'll earn my keep somehow.<eos> Goddamn right you will.
Man of God is called to lead in love.<eos> Anything else will leave us all worse off.<eos> He is a god of love, Nat.<eos> Don't you forget that.<eos> I won't.
Is that what you're telling me?<eos> Why is she doing this?<eos> No one'll believe it.<eos> If it's her word against yours.<eos> Yes, they will.
Previously on AMC's Hell On Wheels.<eos> I'm coming back for you and the baby.<eos> Don't say it.<eos> I will.
This ain't your head talking.<eos> William is your son.<eos> It ain't right for me to keep him from you.<eos> Pray on it.<eos> I will.
All they asked to be read back was the limo driver testimony.<eos> That... that sounds good.<eos> Really good.<eos> I'm not going to say it.<eos> Then I will.
Wait, you're leaving us?<eos> What is this, a party?<eos> Yeah, and I want you to do the honors.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> Oh, you will in a second.
Kids now.<eos> So, you want to hire me?<eos> I want someone to die.<eos> Wait a while.<eos> They will.
How are we going to find him now?<eos> You need to have faith, Bruce.<eos> I know what you risked today.<eos> If Barnes finds out you were involved...<eos> He will.
Lots of things are funny, aren't they?<eos> You think you're going to score, don't you?<eos> What makes you say that?<eos> Not one of your muscles is relaxed.<eos> Anyway, you won't.
Like with Kelly.<eos> When she died, I was devastated.<eos> But... now that she's gone,<eos> I mean, I-I love Kelly.<eos> I always will.
Nothing happened.<eos> It's all right.<eos> You... You've got a lot to think about.<eos> We'll talk again.<eos> No, we won't.
And then, that's our lives settled... for ever.<eos> It's frightening.<eos> You just have to choose right, that's all.<eos> But how will I know?<eos> You will.
Tell the story, Papa, tell it!<eos> Papa! Come here, I'll tell you the story.<eos> But I want Papa to tell it!<eos> Just come and say goodbye to him.<eos> I will not!
I mean, once he signs it, if they make an arrest, it won't take these guys long to figure out it was me that talked to the Feds.<eos> Well, once he signs, it'll be a matter of hours, not days.<eos> The WITSEC arrangements are already being made.<eos> - You know where they're sending me?<eos> - Nope. And I never will. Nobody will.
I get that.<eos> But if you pull her out before she has a chance to save her sister, she will never look at you the same way again.<eos> You know that.<eos> I can't lose her.<eos> And you won't.
You stupid girl.<eos> Have you any idea what you're doing?<eos> Yes, I'm stopping you.<eos> Your mother believed she could, but she failed.<eos> I won't.
Does he have money?<eos> No idea.<eos> Well, has he taken his card or not?<eos> He didn't need it at the institution.<eos> Now he will.
But I was just hoping that maybe, you know -- no, I know what you were hoping.<eos> Door's always open.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, that's cool, Bobby.<eos> I-I will.
Instead, he woke up in a hospital with two broken arms and a restraining order safety-pinned to his chest.<eos> Jesus, Matt.<eos> If I take a night off, people get hurt.<eos> I don't wanna lose you.<eos> - You won't.
I know.<eos> Every day, it was as if I could see you.<eos> You can see me now.<eos> I can't lose you again.<eos> You won't.
That can't be a thing.<eos> And you are gonna have to carry him until he gets home.<eos> Are you shitting me right now?<eos> I don't shit.<eos> But he will, uncontrollably, for the next 36 hours.
How much you willing to bet on it?<eos> Everything I've got.<eos> That's a lot to lose.<eos> But I won't lose.<eos> Yes, you will.
Whitney Frost shot my wife.<eos> I'm coming with you.<eos> No, you're going back to the hospital.<eos> I want her to pay for what she did to us.<eos> And she will.
Handle with extreme caution.<eos> Got it?<eos> Oh.<eos> Who's doing the honors?<eos> I will.
Chicago, right?<eos> October 17, 2014, at 6:31 p.m.<eos> ♪ You're not alone ♪<eos> - ♪ I've been out chasing ghosts ♪<eos> I always will.
I'm getting a promotion.<eos> So, when I get back I'll be able to move you to somewhere better.<eos> Somewhere near the beach or something.<eos> You won't come back.<eos> Of course I will.
Hannah.<eos> She may look like a woman... but she's just a child.<eos> Ignorance, Mr. Lockhart... is the great enemy of science.<eos> I wanna see Pembroke.<eos> And you will.
I think that would be a mistake, but it's not up to me.<eos> I'll talk to the people still at home.<eos> I'll discuss it with the people on guard now, too, but who else wants to approach the Saviors, talk to them first?<eos> What happened here, we won't let that happen again.<eos> I won't.
Radiant.<eos> And he's been kind to you.<eos> Bountiful with the gore, he's been.<eos> I should like to meet him.<eos> You will.
I'm here to see you.<eos> You made me a promise to support my people.<eos> If Heda's spirit chooses me.<eos> Yes.<eos> Will you still?
We need him.<eos> He can help us find Clarke and the other A.I.<eos> That was a mistake.<eos> I don't think so.<eos> You will.
It's a couple weeks' worth of security footage.<eos> Copy.<eos> I've told so many people that they've lost loved ones.<eos> It never gets any easier.<eos> And, Monty, it never will.
There's plenty of food and water.<eos> It should last you until at least we get home.<eos> Sweetheart, please come home in one piece.<eos> - Tell Gilly I love him.<eos> - I will.
He'll grow older, stronger.<eos> He'll remember.<eos> Then he will come for me.<eos> Who will protect me then?<eos> I will.
One such name chimes heavy with me, sir.<eos> And which one is that, Sergeant?<eos> Teague.<eos> He's a union steward.<eos> One moment, if you will, sir.
That is a metaphor, darling.<eos> The killing that comes your way, that ain't.<eos> Do you understand what you raise in me, Matthew?<eos> - If this absurd plot of yours fails...<eos> - It won't.
- If this absurd plot of yours fails...<eos> - It won't.<eos> Well, if it does...<eos> I will not spend my last day on Earth in vain, desperate hope.<eos> No, you will.
I'd make a horrible wife.<eos> Well, that's not true.<eos> And you're a horrible liar.<eos> I'll miss your hair.<eos> So will I.
Out there in the open, taunting their prey.<eos> There's no need to hide when you've got the numbers.<eos> Ah, but do they?<eos> He's dying of thirst.<eos> We will, too.
Ethan Talbot is a scourge upon the earth.<eos> Whatever code I have followed... I hereby disavow.<eos> If given the chance, I will shoot him in the back. And butcher all his kind.<eos> And when this one dies?<eos> So will we.
Lydia, I'm going to be erased, okay?<eos> Just like Alex.<eos> You're gonna forget me.<eos> I won't. No, I won't.<eos> I won't.
Just like Alex.<eos> You're gonna forget me.<eos> I won't. No, I won't.<eos> I won't.<eos> Lydia, you will.
You're not gonna find him.<eos> Let's be honest, he's probably already dead.<eos> I wonder what's gonna happen when Scott realizes that it's your fault.<eos> I should kill you.<eos> Yeah, but you won't.
Because I believe that you have the promise to lead fairly and wisely.<eos> But you have to calm yourself, be measured in your thoughts and your deeds.<eos> You treat people right, they'll stop questioning you.<eos> Trust me on that.<eos> I will.
Don't ever make that mistake of forgetting her.<eos> Just a minute.<eos> One can even find God if you truly seek Him.<eos> Why can't you find a girl?<eos> Sure you will.
You know, I was also thinking about getting my old band back together.<eos> I hope that's not gonna be a problem.<eos> - Ooh... - I mean, we'd only want to practice over here, like, three nights a week,<eos> - maybe four, max.<eos> - I'll just...
But they're never gonna know that unless you've got their attention.<eos> And this is how you get the world's attention.<eos> My parents are gonna see that tape.<eos> - Tyler's parents...<eos> - No, they won't.
I never knew you were an orphan, too.<eos> Well... now you know.<eos> - Does Lenny know?<eos> - No.<eos> And he never will.
It won't work.<eos> Is that a challenge?<eos> I just want Finn to suffer for what he did to me.<eos> For what he did to us.<eos> He will.
That will be perfect, Norman.<eos> And you should bring whatever outfit you would like us to put her in.<eos> Hello? Are... are you there, Norman?<eos> - Yes, I'm here.<eos> - I'll...
She was a maid, for Godsakes.<eos> You were going to marry a maid?<eos> That's pathetic.<eos> I loved Violet.<eos> And I always will.
And right back to Hell you go.<eos> People come to me to ask for favors, and more often than not,<eos> I'm happy to oblige.<eos> What do you get?<eos> A devilish I.O.U., if you will.
We're going to put her under, the way she was when I first saw her.<eos> She won't feel any pain, will she?<eos> She won't feel anything.<eos> We have to try to help her.<eos> We will.
Why?<eos> You play?<eos> A little.<eos> Norman, this handsome dude was just asking if we ever have anyone play that piano.<eos> No, and we never will again.
Time was, the finest meat packing plant in town.<eos> Yeah, it's a winner.<eos> Hey, that star on your arm...<eos> - I earned it.<eos> You will too with effort, whole sleeve of 'em.
Go out with me to a little club called...<eos> Aura.<eos> Aura? Yeah, we can't get in there.<eos> I know the bouncer.<eos> Yes, we will.
You'll be given food, shelter, and a letter of manumission.<eos> What is "a letter of manumission"?<eos> It's the piece of paper that states you're free.<eos> And slave masters will believe this paper?<eos> They will in England. Hyah!
- Get out!<eos> Kizzy, I swear!<eos> Kizzy, it's been a while now.<eos> And I ain't told nobody, just like I said.<eos> And I won't.
To help save someone else's son.<eos> A son whose mother is a liar.<eos> Look, Hank is still out there.<eos> Now, if you'll just take a look at this...<eos> I won't!
One spicy step ahead of you.<eos> Enter the Serrano pepper!<eos> Chi-caw!<eos> No one will know the difference.<eos> I will.
It's just...<eos> Back in the real world, I am going back to debt and custody battles... and... keeping my chemistry in line, and God knows what else.<eos> You shouldn't have to deal with the responsibilities in my crazy life.<eos> Yeah, okay, - what if I want to?<eos> - You won't.
What's that, a drink?<eos> Manicure-pedicure.<eos> Sounds like fun.<eos> If we ever get out of here.<eos> We will.
♪ Tomorrow is a better day... ♪<eos> God, I'm glad to see you.<eos> I know.<eos> We need to need to find Fi.<eos> We will.
It's been months.<eos> Can't you forgive me by now for what happened to the baby?<eos> No!<eos> I don't forgive you.<eos> And I never will.
Yeah, well, I loved her.<eos> Sat behind her in home room for three years.<eos> Smell of cherry lip balm and acne cream still gets me going.<eos> She didn't even know you were alive.<eos> Oh, she will now.
And?<eos> He got away, but I'll find him.<eos> Later.<eos> He needs to pay for what he did to my brother!<eos> And he will.
We're going to marry.<eos> I'll continue to provide you with the best care and the finest treatment.<eos> You know you can run to Elizabeth as soon as I'm dead. Why can't you wait?<eos> We can't wait.<eos> We won't.
Madam. The new government of Pakistan has put a stay on death penalty.<eos> Sister... they've put an indefinite stay.<eos> It means Sarbjit's death sentenced has been postponed for now.<eos> This means... papa's coming home?<eos> Not yet... but he definitely will.
You have to let her go.<eos> Well?<eos> Repeat--all agents, do not engage or pursue until the bomb is defused.<eos> You can leave.<eos> But you won't.
Oddly, I haven't missed you.<eos> Of course you have, my love.<eos> All right, you two can catch up later.<eos> Right now, we need to find the Book of the White.<eos> And you will, but not without payment.
I'm scared, Frances, I'm scared, I'm scared I'm going to die,<eos> I'm scared I'm dying, I'm dying! No, look at me. Look at me!<eos> Now, listen.<eos> You are not going to die, I won't let it happen.<eos> I simply won't!
I thought, maybe he's finally figured it out.<eos> Ugh. What an idiot I was.<eos> - What the hell are these? - Geez.<eos> You want to tell me about them?<eos> Because your father won't.
I guess I wanted to prove to my mother that I was nothing like her, so I became a lawyer.<eos> How you feeling?<eos> About the same.<eos> I haven't found anything that could help.<eos> You won't.
Yes, thanks to your map.<eos> If it weren't for Hook, I'd still be rotting in that cell.<eos> You'll tell him that I did the right thing?<eos> That he was right to trust me?<eos> I will.
Only she knows who White is.<eos> Any joy with his van?<eos> It's been found abandoned.<eos> We'll find him, sir.<eos> We will.
Everything doesn't need to be talked about.<eos> Okay.<eos> Yeah, I understand.<eos> So another time you will call me, and we'll go out.<eos> But you won't, will you?
I'm just saying that if for some reason I was responsible for taking away your dream...<eos> That you'd never be able to live with yourself.<eos> You go finish law school, okay?<eos> And you pass the bar, and you become a lawyer, and then... in two years when I get out, if you still want to marry me...<eos> Oh, I will.
That you'd never be able to live with yourself.<eos> You go finish law school, okay?<eos> And you pass the bar, and you become a lawyer, and then... in two years when I get out, if you still want to marry me...<eos> Oh, I will.<eos> Of course I will.
Good idea.<eos> You should come over and see my computer.<eos> Oh, you know, I think I'm done for the night.<eos> Oh. Well, how about after dinner?<eos> I will.
You should come over and see my computer.<eos> Oh, you know, I think I'm done for the night.<eos> Oh. Well, how about after dinner?<eos> I will.<eos> Not tonight, but, uh, I will.
Where are we?<eos> Bus station.<eos> Why?<eos> It won't work.<eos> - Yes, it will.
That guy gets lost in his own cross examinations.<eos> Yeah.<eos> You will be fine.<eos> Too bad you won't be there to see me in action.<eos> - No, but I will.
Husband.<eos> Ah, a husband.<eos> Well... it would appear a better man than I has won.<eos> But I am in port quite often... should that ever change.<eos> It... it won't.
Wherever you need to go, whatever you need to do, do it.<eos> And when you get back, I'll be here.<eos> Okay. I love you, Barry.<eos> I love you too.<eos> And I always will.
You okay?<eos> Mitchie went behind my back and found out about Erica's year off.<eos> Then he tagged my mother in.<eos> - Don't be mad. - He told you, too?<eos> Forcibly and against my will.
I thought you might like to do it.<eos> I don't think that I'm the guy to get up and talk about Dad.<eos> Maybe Erin or Shane.<eos> If you change your mind...<eos> I won't.
Will you serve God?<eos> Of course I will.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Of course.<eos> I will.
Of course I will.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Of course.<eos> I will.<eos> I will.
Which means she doesn't have long.<eos> Your sister wasn't his target.<eos> Well, maybe that doesn't mean anything to him.<eos> - We have to find her.<eos> - And we will.
We have Becca's backdoor password.<eos> We have me.<eos> You said the moment we use the password,<eos> A.L.I.E. will know.<eos> She will.
Marjorie deserves to be happy.<eos> We'll tell her after she gets back from the cruise.<eos> Christy, I don't, I-I don't think I can hold it together.<eos> Yeah, well, you will.<eos> All of us will.
I am getting to have the family that I thought I lost forever.<eos> Please.<eos> Now, you make sure that nothing happens to them.<eos> Please.<eos> I will.
Really.<eos> I just heard.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> That baby will never know how special she was.<eos> He will.
He lost the presidency.<eos> Sorry.<eos> So am I.<eos> I hope we have some time together.<eos> Mm. We will.
One was a sniper in Beirut.<eos> Just the 2 of them?<eos> They'll hold them until the Turks get there.<eos> - They'll blow their cover.<eos> - Yes, they will.
Please make him go.<eos> Stupid shoe!<eos> I'll have to have it seen to.<eos> Will you look at it for me?<eos> - Yes, of course I will.
Of course.<eos> Type in your number.<eos> This is more than a job to me.<eos> If something happens to Carlos...<eos> Nothing will.
Alaric really...<eos> He needs you.<eos> Yeah, I get it.<eos> Well, we'll-we'll figure it out once this huntress thing is over.<eos> Yes. We will.
Well, that's not department issue.<eos> That blood on the barrel...<eos> We know whose it is?<eos> No, sir. We don't.<eos> And we probably won't for a while.
Is this because I won't write you back to life?<eos> I'm not the one that ordered all the phones to be ripped out down here.<eos> Well, with all you heroes running around, the place he feels has a little too much hope bubbling up in his realm.<eos> Well, you can tell him it's gonna take a lot more than ripping out phones to discourage us.<eos> I will.
Don't flatter yourself.<eos> Nobody wants to hug you anyway!<eos> I'll hug him tonight when he's asleep.<eos> Can you sign this form saying you take full responsibility for the school camera, editing equipment, the sound equipment, and lighting packet while it's in my possession?<eos> No, we will not.
Russia?<eos> I know it's not easy.<eos> It's the only way.<eos> Okay. And how soon before you come?<eos> I won't.
Let me go.<eos> - Let me go.<eos> - What do you mean?<eos> I won't let you go!<eos> I won't!
I'd arrest my own mother if I thought she was scamming cops.<eos> Your own mother.<eos> Well, with a lot of back-up.<eos> Please, Erin, don't insult me.<eos> I won't.
Nobody's gonna believe me, ever.<eos> Hey, Kristi.<eos> Kristi.<eos> I know exactly what those guys did to you.<eos> Nobody else will.
He's testing you.<eos> Push back-- let him know you're serious.<eos> Are you out of your mind?<eos> What if he doesn't call back?<eos> He will.
They'll beat any price.<eos> And you heard about this item where?<eos> Antiquities market is small.<eos> People talk.<eos> And so will you.
Our lawyer, Bram Keller...<eos> He thinks that this trial could be as important as Scopes.<eos> Didn't Scopes lose?<eos> He did.<eos> Yes. But we won't.
Will you love her, honor her, keep her in sickness and in health, forsaking all others, so long as you both shall live?<eos> I will.<eos> Virginia Johnson, will you have this man, William Masters, to be thy wedded husband?<eos> Will you love him, honor him, keep him in sickness and in health, forsaking all others, so long as you both shall live?<eos> I will.
I do not want to lose that, so I am willing to make a deal with you.<eos> What kind of deal?<eos> Sasha Antonov.<eos> If Roman has Sasha, the feud will end.<eos> And so will the list.
You know, sometimes adults say silly things that kids don't understand, like when they talk about mortgages or other people's parenting skills.<eos> You might think you get it, but your brain hasn't actually developed the capacity for irony yet.<eos> In fact, your head's probably still soft.<eos> If I touched it right now, my finger would probably go right through it.<eos> Not that I will.
Want to be a tax lawyer now? Hadn't thought of that.<eos> That's a good idea.<eos> I never saw this kitchen finished.<eos> Neither did Daniel.<eos> Well, maybe he will one day.
You're gonna make it.<eos> So I don't accept your forgiveness, you understand?<eos> You are gonna have to stay strong, okay?<eos> Okay.<eos> I will.
What are you talking about?<eos> I'd understand.<eos> Tomorrow morning, you will leave for Russia.<eos> And how soon before you come?<eos> I won't.
I'm gonna make it fun.<eos> I promise.<eos> It's Laurel.<eos> Tell her that I'm really sorry about her grandmother, okay?<eos> I will.
No need to send any more hit men my way.<eos> Sorry.<eos> I saw you flirting, and I got jealous, so I told him...to back off.<eos> It won't happen again.<eos> No, it will.
Where... where I have speed, where, I'm...<eos> The Flash.<eos> I can give you that back, should you desire it.<eos> I just want the pain to stop.<eos> It will, child.
Yeah, but I used your gun to shoot Private Collins.<eos> Apparently, he walked in on your attempted illegal appropriation of WMD for your own personal gain.<eos> I got 6 men out there who'll testify to that.<eos> No one will ever believe your story.<eos> I will.
I saw you singing with the choir.<eos> I was thinking about joining, so...<eos> Oh, you should. We could use all the talented singers we can get.<eos> You should come to rehearsals tomorrow. Okay.<eos> Maybe I will.
Thanks, bestie.<eos> Are you sure you're well enough to drive?<eos> - Absolutely. - Okay.<eos> Well, promise me you'll be careful.<eos> I will.
- Laxmi!<eos> I beg of you!<eos> I finally have a decent life.<eos> Please don't ruin it!<eos> You won't, right?
I'll leave.<eos> He's gone finally...<eos> He is gone.<eos> He won't come back, right?<eos> He won't.
Sorry, Jervis.<eos> I'm not killing anyone.<eos> Yes, you will! Now pick up the pistol and fire!<eos> You want to show me who I really am, then show me.<eos> Oh, I will.
No. I'm determined that you'll live on and suffer without your love as I have.<eos> Choose.<eos> No.<eos> I won't choose.<eos> You will. You will.
We're both adults.<eos> There's no reason we can't work together.<eos> I'm glad you feel that way.<eos> Mario agrees?<eos> He will.
Our paths weren't meant to cross just yet.<eos> But I'm not gonna kill you yet.<eos> I do that, you become the martyr, and she'll carry you in her heart forever.<eos> Before I kill you, she has to hate you.<eos> And she will.
He wanted to destroy you.<eos> I begged him not to.<eos> I asked him to send you to hell instead.<eos> I did it because I love you, son.<eos> And I always will.
They're not sending me anywhere, Nyx.<eos> I'm choosing to go.<eos> - What other choice do we have?<eos> - We can fight.<eos> We will.
Stop them coming.<eos> Please, you must stop.<eos> Okay.<eos> I have child who is scared.<eos> I will.
- You don't know that.<eos> - Know what?<eos> If Kara's mom would ever forgive her.<eos> You have no idea.<eos> Of course she will.
You are completely demented.<eos> At least I'm not a coward.<eos> Don't contact me again.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> I won't.
HE GROANS<eos> ALL GASP<eos> DOOR OPENS<eos> Will he live?<eos> Yes, yes, he will.
Read it and you'll see.<eos> You done wasting my time?<eos> You don't want it?<eos> Fine.<eos> Plenty of other outlets will.
My sweet, sweet baby.<eos> I want to talk to my Flora.<eos> Baby girl.<eos> If by chance you see this, the first thing you have to know, is I love you.<eos> I always will.
Yo, I got to head to Canelo's.<eos> This late?<eos> Why? With all the power out, there's gonna be looting.<eos> Gabe doesn't know about the night job.<eos> And he never will.
- Ginny, you're in Midland.<eos> Okay? No one knows you're here.<eos> What do you...?<eos> They know about us.<eos> Soon, everyone will.
I was the one who recruited you here.<eos> I believe you may be special.<eos> And you keep working as hard as you are, and we're gonna have a talk.<eos> Very soon.<eos> Yes, we will.
All right, let's go over this one more time.<eos> You need entrances, exits, number of terrorists, hostages, explosives, how they're rigged, armaments, hostage locations, and if bio weapons are a real threat or a bluff.<eos> Anything I'm forgetting?<eos> Alex, please be careful.<eos> Okay. I will.
Well, what if you get caught?<eos> Then you'll both be in jail when the world ends.<eos> If the world ends, which it might not,<eos> - by the way.<eos> - It will.
Look, I know you want me back, Rumple.<eos> It's... it's never gonna happen.<eos> I know.<eos> But I cannot lose another son, Belle.<eos> I won't.
I need confirmation from both of you.<eos> It's very important to me.<eos> Isabella will apply to the Process.<eos> And she will pass.<eos> She will.
If you want to speak to an operator, press seven.<eos> We've never really gotten along with machines that talk and try to understand us.<eos> Who saw you?<eos> She saw me.<eos> - And maybe we never will.
Not to just give up when things got a little tough.<eos> We're not giving up, Bryson.<eos> What does it matter if we skip the shitty parts?<eos> - No one's gonna know.<eos> - Well, I will.
Miranda!<eos> You're too late, witch hunter.<eos> She died badly, screaming.<eos> Alone.<eos> Just like you will.
And when you bring it back, it means that you'll be with it.<eos> And that's what I really want.<eos> For you to come back.<eos> No matter what.<eos> I will.
It is only with the heart that one can see rightly. What is essential is invisible to the eye.<eos> He'll always be with me.<eos> I understand now.<eos> - Please tell the Aviator I remember him!<eos> - I will!
There, yeah.<eos> Okay.<eos> You will come to the party and I cannot stop trailing off.<eos> - All right.<eos> - But I will now.
Yeah, yeah, Don't be sad.<eos> Tell you what.<eos> When I get back up to Headquarters.<eos> I'll make sure Riley remembers you.<eos> - You will?
Watch that again.<eos> See if there's anything you can find to help us out.<eos> Yeah. I can sit in your chair?<eos> No, you can't, and everything is recorded.<eos> Okay, I won't, I won't, I won't.
Ray!<eos> Ray! Ray, he's not getting in!<eos> He's not getting in.<eos> It'll hold.<eos> It will.
She'll resent you more if you don't tell her.<eos> I'm telling Kit.<eos> It's my news, too.<eos> - Jay! Please, let me tell her in my own time.<eos> Fine, I won't.
I'm asking you... stop doing what you're doing to Tom Watson.<eos> Tom Watson shook my hand and agreed to a deal.<eos> - He's not going to leave.<eos> - He will.<eos> One way or another, he will.
Our Lord was a man, anyway.<eos> He didn't care about greasy skin.<eos> Ladies, no more talk about Our Lord's complexion at dinner, please.<eos> The girls will help you find something suitable, Eilis.<eos> - Won't you, girls?
- It's in Yuma tomorrow night.<eos> Yuma's less than a day's walk from here.<eos> That poker game, there's practically gonna be an army protecting' it.<eos> If Tommy says we can beat 'em, I'll believe him.<eos> - We all will.
Thank you.<eos> We'll carry your stuff.<eos> Go on, get ahead of us.<eos> When you pack, don't forget her medical kit.<eos> We won't.
No, I went when I woke up.<eos> So, when you come back to LA, will I see you?<eos> Look, I, um, the thing is...<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, you will.
Thanks, Dad.<eos> Hey, it's what dads do.<eos> So, are you gonna be, like, staying with us from now on?<eos> Well, actually, Son, I...<eos> I... I will.
Hey, it's what dads do.<eos> So, are you gonna be, like, staying with us from now on?<eos> Well, actually, Son, I...<eos> I... I will.<eos> Of course I will.
How are you, Mrs. Donnelly?<eos> Why did you come here, really?<eos> To pay my respects to you.<eos> There's nothing I admire more than someone planting trees under whose shade they may never get to sit.<eos> Others will.
That's not gonna happen, James, because I'm gonna put my investigators on this twenty-four-seven until we find out who really did this.<eos> Just stay in county lines with that thing on. Otherwise, the U.S. Marshals will be down there pronto.<eos> Son, I want you to stay strong.<eos> Do you hear me?<eos> I will.
File 5-1-7, access code G21-12-57.<eos> Thank you.<eos> But you won't find her.<eos> She's a ghost.<eos> I will.
We should have else desired your good advice in this day's council, but we'll take tomorrow.<eos> Is't far you ride?<eos> As far, my Lord, as will fill up the time 'twixt this and supper, go not my horse the better.<eos> Fail not our feast.<eos> My Lord, I will not.
Of course, it's my duty.<eos> But Master Ip you know the score.<eos> The police can't keep watch here all day. We need your help.<eos> Tell people to be careful.<eos> - I will.
- I wish I could do more.<eos> I had no idea Jeanine was capable of something like this.<eos> It's time we fight back.<eos> - We don't have the numbers.<eos> - We will.
Frank said we can fix this.<eos> - We just need more time. - Oh, no.<eos> It's too late for that.<eos> You have no idea what you've done.<eos> But you will.
You found your targets, you tracked them down, you fought very hard.<eos> Susan... you are a good agent.<eos> You'll get them next time, huh?<eos> Unless we die here.<eos> Then you will not.
Rumi writes, "there's a candle in your heart, ready to be kindled."<eos> There's a void in your soul, ready to be filled.<eos> "You feel it, don't you?"<eos> Richie.<eos> You will. I...
Oh, Hymie, this is nothing like Roman Holiday.<eos> Roman Holiday had a guy with a name and a body they could give the award to.<eos> There is no Robert Rich.<eos> Who gets the thing if it wins?<eos> Well, maybe it won't.
Surely, as an avid reader you know that the husband of a princess can only be discovered through a tournament.<eos> So I won't choose him myself.<eos> What if I don't love him?<eos> You will love him, Violet.<eos> You will.
Do you know what I chose to fake?<eos> You.<eos> We will have this family.<eos> Yes.<eos> We will.
The rest is on your shoulders.<eos> Thank you, Senator.<eos> Tell the president I'm doing this out of respect to you.<eos> Frank's still on my shit list till I beat him in the general.<eos> I will.
Zach is really upset.<eos> You should talk to him.<eos> It's the girl stuff.<eos> He doesn't wanna talk to me about it.<eos> Okay, I will.
We deserve to know.<eos> I'm ready to face whatever it is.<eos> I-If-If your fiancée is out there and there's still a future for you with her, we'll face that too.<eos> I just... I can't leave here without you.<eos> I won't.
Nah, you're all right.<eos> I'm gonna walk. It's a lovely day for it.<eos> Don't forget this lot.<eos> They're very important.<eos> I won't.
Are there any demons, Lord Zhong will not slay?<eos> Come see my performance tomorrow night!<eos> Depends on who it is!<eos> Sister, what if he doesn't come tomorrow?<eos> He will!
I think you know that.<eos> Because my lease is up at the end of the month.<eos> Oh! I see what you did there.<eos> You said we'd talk about it.<eos> And we will, but right now, cake!
How marvellous.<eos> Are we supposed to go to him or is he coming here?<eos> Well, he'll want to meet me too, won't he?<eos> I didn't actually ask him.<eos> Well, of course he will.
I'm getting free treatment from the government.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> Keep it. I'm sure you have other expenses.<eos> Yeah, I do...if you come along.<eos> Will you?
Just do it, Doc.<eos> Please.<eos> Just hook me up to that machine and do it.<eos> I can't, Rex.<eos> I won't.
We should never give in to these vile pagans.<eos> Otherwise we will have failed, and that is how we would be judged.<eos> The Franks want to discuss a way to end the siege.<eos> You have all failed!<eos> I will not.
Units on standby, ready for go. Good.<eos> Hold off on that live feed.<eos> We've got an evolving situation here.<eos> Did they give you the green light yet?<eos> They will.
I don't think that's a good idea.<eos> I didn't ask you.<eos> No one else knows what happened to him. No one knows he's dead.<eos> If we all tell them, they'll believe us.<eos> No, they won't.
- I know my son, and he would never break the rules.<eos> Why don't you help me find him and you can ask him for yourself?<eos> - Soren will return on his own time.<eos> - What if he doesn't?<eos> He will.
Julia.<eos> Alan is here.<eos> We're running out of time.<eos> If we don't find...<eos> We will.
But I do.<eos> And I want you to show them who you really are.<eos> You are the most powerful witch of all.<eos> I don't even have my powers yet.<eos> But you will.
Get your mind off what happened.<eos> What happened to me at Aleister's...<eos> I hate that it took me so long to find you.<eos> I thought I lost you.<eos> You never will.
Then we do that.<eos> We trap him, we hold him in the cage, and we wait.<eos> Clay's strong, Jeremy, he can fight this, okay?<eos> I know he can!<eos> He will!
When all the witches are dead, it will just be you and me.<eos> What are they planning?<eos> Clara wants to possess a new body.<eos> Who survives the Undoing?<eos> Clara will.
That the curse is lifting?<eos> That we won't be werewolves anymore?<eos> Jeremy wouldn't say it if he didn't believe it.<eos> Look, I know what it means for us not be a wolves anymore, but if it happens, our lives become easier.<eos> They will.
The only male witch.<eos> The only female werewolf.<eos> You put up a good fight.<eos> But all good things must come to an end.<eos> They will.
You should leave<eos> Calm down<eos> Did you tell anyone what we saw today?<eos> I did, but they wouldn't believe me<eos> They won't
Jorge...<eos> What, woman?<eos> Can't you see I'm in communion with the Holy Ghost?<eos> Want to make us a little boy?<eos> With God's will!
No.<eos> Let me deal with it.<eos> Are you sure?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I will.
He's out.<eos> If you see him, could you tell him...<eos> Tell him to call his office.<eos> Of course.<eos> Of course I will.
Untroubling and untroubled where I lie."<eos> [both] "The grass below, above, the vaulted sky."<eos> I wonder if he ever found it... his silent place with God.<eos> Oh, the poem tells me that he did.<eos> As you will one day.
It's taken care of.<eos> We need to get you out of here.<eos> It's too late.<eos> We'll never make it.<eos> Yes, you will.
I see it.<eos> Noah, that kid... he said he didn't know if he can make it.<eos> That's how I feel.<eos> You're gonna make it.<eos> Both of us, we will.
Yeah. Thanks, Pete.<eos> Let's be friends, man.<eos> We kind of have to be, right?<eos> Yeah, we do.<eos> So we will.
Okay, pria, we -- we lost tonight.<eos> We lost our guy.<eos> We didn't find him.<eos> I know.<eos> But you will.
We don't want that.<eos> Please, come home.<eos> We forgive you.<eos> I don't forgive you.<eos> And I never will.
- Please, Sue...<eos> I need this.<eos> Please?<eos> If you come up with money by the end of the month, deal.<eos> I will.
You barbaric filth!<eos> There's a special place in the Seven Hells for your kind.<eos> Please, please, I'll pay!<eos> I'll pay all of you.<eos> Yes, you will!
No, I'm not gonna settle down.<eos> I'm gonna go and find myself one more cock, and do you know what you're gonna do?<eos> You will wait. - I'll do what?<eos> - You'll wait for me.<eos> I will not!
- Dirty fuck.<eos> Don't get like that.<eos> Are you going to tell her?<eos> Veronica. Not a fucking word.<eos> - I won't.
Previously on Power...<eos> Mrs. Stern, I have good reason to believe that Simon's been skimming from the clubs, hiding assets.<eos> There's proof, I can destroy him in this divorce.<eos> - You said you had documentation?<eos> - I will.
You need to clear that up for me before we die.<eos> I follow orders, as you do.<eos> Well, in that case...<eos> I want to meet your boss.<eos> You will.
Ah, you two very good together.<eos> Maybe you two get married, yeah?<eos> Yeah, well, your invite's in the post.<eos> Which one of you will wear the dress?<eos> He will. She will.
It takes all the emotion out of everything.<eos> What's goin' on with you? Huh?<eos> I'm having a baby, and I just feel like nothing in my life is my life and I lose my voice, too, I'm gonna...<eos> I can't. I can't lose my voice.<eos> You won't, you won't.
I didn't get the surgery.<eos> No.<eos> But we found one donor.<eos> We'll be able to find another one.<eos> - Will we?
You are a stranger to yourself.<eos> The truth is staring you in the face and you can't even see it.<eos> What truth?<eos> Whatever I am... .. you love me.<eos> And you always will.
And I was hoping, as my closest friends, that you'd be willing to come over this evening for a sample meal.<eos> Hmm. I knew she wanted something.<eos> Yeah, of course she did.<eos> All you had to do was ask.<eos> But of course I will.
That's...<eos> It-it-it's not fair... to AnnaBeth or George.<eos> Not to mention, it's just plain craziness.<eos> It won't work.<eos> It will!
They figured out that you got the heroin from me, but they're gonna give me a second chance.<eos> But you need to stop.<eos> No more gambling.<eos> I know.<eos> I will.
Everything I do is to build a life for her.<eos> Every breath I take, I breathe for her.<eos> Without her, my life has no meaning.<eos> And if something happens to her...<eos> neither will yours.
I do feel I-I owe you an apology.<eos> Your apology can wait.<eos> Virginia, I-I just didn't know how else to prove to you that Dan Logan is not what he seems.<eos> I do not want to talk about New York.<eos> Then we won't.
We ain't had us a little girl.<eos> This is our answer to the pipe bombs-- politics, everything thrown at us during this project.<eos> I only hope people still wanna live in these houses.<eos> Oh, they do.<eos> And they will.
I shouldn't listen to other people's conversations.<eos> And repeating it, especially to strangers, that's worse.<eos> I just want everyone to know the truth, daddy.<eos> You didn't kill Tom.<eos> They will, monkey.
Well, i would... (laughs)<eos> I would really love that, too.<eos> Good.<eos> Okay. (laughs) Uh, i'll see you then.<eos> Oh, yes, you will.
What if we lost her?<eos> Then we'll find her again.<eos> Kenz, we'll find her.<eos> We're not giving up.<eos> Lauren: And nobody ever will.
Someone's alive down there.<eos> Jasper, where do you want this?<eos> Put it here, no weak spots.<eos> We need to make sure they don't get in.<eos> They won't.
- Andrew?<eos> - Yeah. What is that, a family name?<eos> Andrew Pilbasian... will you marry me?<eos> Yes!<eos> Yes, I will!
- Yeah. What is that, a family name?<eos> Andrew Pilbasian... will you marry me?<eos> Yes!<eos> Yes, I will!<eos> - Yes, I will!
I can't remember Sara's smile.<eos> It's weird, isn't it?<eos> I mean, I know Sara used to smile and--and laugh, but when I close my eyes and I try and picture it, all I see is the way that I found her.<eos> You know, sometimes, the only thing that keeps me going is the thought of one day finding her killer.<eos> We will.
I don't want to go out like Butch and Sundance, so what's the plan?<eos> Shoot straighter than they do.<eos> Cover me.<eos> If he gets to the fortress before we do, we're dead.<eos> He won't.
God damn it, Walter!<eos> Of course.<eos> I apologize for jumping the gun.<eos> I will stay here as long as is required.<eos> - Damn right you will. - Yes, sir.
- You do hear that, right?<eos> - He's not coming.<eos> We're leaving.<eos> - This better make sense real fast, buddy.<eos> - It will.
I'd tell you to go kill yourself, but I know you don't have the balls.<eos> If you're here, then you're desperate, so come back with some money.<eos> I'm not coming back.<eos> Oh, yes you are.<eos> Maybe not on purpose, but you will.
And...<eos> I still love you.<eos> I still love you.<eos> I love you.<eos> I always will, bro.
Stay where you are.<eos> Don't leave.<eos> I might send someone over to get some clothes for him.<eos> Ok.<eos> I will.
What the hell are you doing here?<eos> We had an agreement.<eos> Come back to the church with me.<eos> That's where you belong till that baby's born. No.<eos> I won't.
Are you kidding?<eos> Brandon's perfect.<eos> He takes care of me... like you used to.<eos> Okay, I just want you to be happy, so...<eos> Cyndee Sandy Pokorny, will you...
I'm not even gonna pretend to know what that means, but good for you. [Laughs]<eos> Delia, you know what? I got to tell you something.<eos> I represent a few people who could use a shark like you to help un-marry them.<eos> Well, have them call me, by all means.<eos> (Hal) Absolutely, I will.
You know, in spite of your act, I think you have a place in your heart for children.<eos> Here is your paycheck.<eos> With a little something extra, as promised.<eos> I don't understand why you wanted Zoila to think you were broke.<eos> You will.
We'll have the French fries, the jumbo shrimp cocktail, and... ?<eos> Um, do they have Mac and cheese?<eos> Well, the Mac and cheese is truffle Mac and cheese, buddy.<eos> You might not like it.<eos> I will.
Vivian... you know him.<eos> If I tell him now, he'll... Blow off the award and jump into savior mode.<eos> I'd never forgive myself.<eos> He won't forgive you for not telling him.<eos> I will. I will.
Paige, you don't have to go.<eos> They arrested Alison for killing Mona.<eos> She's in jail.<eos> She won't stay there.<eos> Yes, she will.
That's the important thing.<eos> I don't even wanna go nowhere.<eos> Gwen, we got a code 3 for chest pain.<eos> But, yeah, we'll finish this later.<eos> - Oh, yes, we will.
[Lid closes]<eos> Rebecca... ?<eos> If we don't find her?<eos> Don't worry.<eos> We will.
He's right, Bobbi.<eos> We already took the top deck.<eos> Director Fury left orders, and we're gonna follow them.<eos> Hydra will not get this ship and its cargo.<eos> They won't.
Angels are guardians, Jiaying, but they're also heralds, sent to reveal the truth.<eos> And that is my purpose.<eos> I'm here to show the Inhumans exactly what you are.<eos> Even in the darkness, they will see the truth.<eos> No. They won't.
I haven't been sleeping.<eos> It's this shift and studying for boards and...<eos> - It can't happen again.<eos> - I know.<eos> It won't.
I wanted to come home.<eos> I wanted to make something here.<eos> A house of sorts.<eos> A safe place.<eos> A celebration, if you will.
I think he was waiting at your house to tell you.<eos> You want to put names with those black faces, you're gonna have to work harder than that.<eos> I'm asking you to trust me.<eos> I don't.<eos> I never will.
- We shouldn't inform the press until after you land, for security purposes.<eos> Donald...<eos> - If anything should happen to me--<eos> - I'm prepared.<eos> - But nothing will.
We have the core.<eos> Careful.<eos> Your father... his sacrifice was not for nothing.<eos> Promise me this'll work.<eos> It will.
This ain't working.<eos> It's not working.<eos> You got to stop.<eos> I can't.<eos> I won't.
Even though you're kind of a nerd who thinks it's okay to wear "sensible shoes""<eos> the truth is, we really think you're a great teacher.<eos> So, here.<eos> Don't cry.<eos> I won't.
Geez.<eos> At least her see if she likes it.<eos> She already knows she likes teaching.<eos> Trust me, she will like this much, much more.<eos> No, she won't, you silly actor.
Look, I-I understand that you're mad, and you have every right to be.<eos> I'm not mad, Rafael.<eos> I'm scared.<eos> When this baby comes, I'm scared it's gonna all be on me, all the child care.<eos> No, it won't.
And it's really hard for me to believe that you knew nothing about it.<eos> You know, I liked it better when you were suspended.<eos> Look, if your father needs money or a place to hide, he might contact you.<eos> And if that happens, we need to know.<eos> And you will.
I should check it out then.<eos> You could come stay with us.<eos> We have a terrible futon and a terrible coffeemaker.<eos> You should really come to New York.<eos> Maybe I will.
They're connected to this place somehow.<eos> 1987... that's the date<eos> Leland Goines said he met me before.<eos> But that hasn't happened for you yet.<eos> No, but it will.
Stop it!<eos> Look, Greylock was keeping me hidden and the easiest way was for mw to be a boy.<eos> But why?<eos> If I tell you, make a promise that you keep my secret.<eos> I will.
And your daughter's worried it's her mom.<eos> I told Brooke, Monica is fine.<eos> She's at Pleasant Roads Rehab in Phoenix.<eos> - Give her a call.<eos> - I will.
They filmed your first time.<eos> I mean, the day that your video accidentally went viral and I was right there to see it happen?<eos> Priceless.<eos> They're gonna figure out who did this.<eos> No, they won't.
It's okay, come on!<eos> It's just their perception, Lizzie.<eos> Perception based on misunderstanding.<eos> They don't want to understand.<eos> They will.
Well, why don't I go find out and then I will send him on his way.<eos> Do you want to go with Adele?<eos> No.<eos> No, I want this madness to end.<eos> So it will.
And I've often remembered her in my prayers.<eos> I never thought I'd have another child.<eos> I just...<eos> I kept loving her.<eos> And you always will.
- The Mason Hotel wants a painting.<eos> They won't accept an easel.<eos> Or... will they?<eos> No.<eos> They won't.
I can see why Simon wanted to take it from you.<eos> Your information checked out.<eos> With proof I can destroy him in this divorce.<eos> - You said you had documentation?<eos> - I will.
But it wasn't about that for Eddie.<eos> He knew he was innocent.<eos> It was about finding the truth.<eos> Yeah, well, maybe he lost hope that he ever would.<eos> Well, now he won't.
I told him that I have his daughter.<eos> What?<eos> You mean alive?<eos> What happens when he finds out she's not?<eos> He won't.
And still, I accept that as a choice.<eos> One that I have carried the burden of every day since I made it.<eos> We're gonna keep running for the rest of our lives.<eos> - Until they find us.<eos> - They won't.
All I wish for, madam, is that you do my bidding.<eos> You betray my love for you by asking...<eos> It is not betrayal... it is simply my wish.<eos> You should wish to please me.<eos> I won't.
You betray my love for you by asking...<eos> It is not betrayal... it is simply my wish.<eos> You should wish to please me.<eos> I won't.<eos> I won't.
I did that once in my summer camp.<eos> Are you sure about this?<eos> I never said I was great at it.<eos> If we lose, everyone will hate me.<eos> No, they won't.
How it is does not make it right!<eos> I'm close, though.<eos> Dr. Urman said a call could come at any time.<eos> You can't give up hope.<eos> I won't.
Now it's not anymore.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You know, after I cleaned the fries off your face and put you to bed, you said something to me that was pretty dark.<eos> Don't tell me.<eos> Okay, I won't.
- Got the Seattle chief on the line.<eos> - Well, where's Rachel?<eos> She'll be here in two.<eos> - Gonna miss you, Raylan.<eos> - No, you won't.
I'm sorry to hear that.<eos> Don't be.<eos> When it rains, it pours.<eos> So I'm just hoping a storm is coming soon.<eos> It will.
With this merger, Maya's dream of mass production is effectively neutralized.<eos> Without it, however,<eos> Maya is free to take her highly sought-after technology anywhere.<eos> And it will get made.<eos> Yes, it will.
I just want to talk.<eos> What about?<eos> Have you thought any about what we discussed last time?<eos> It won't work.<eos> Yes, it will.
Okay, that's it.<eos> - Out, Walt.<eos> - What?<eos> Look, I said you could sit there as long as you kept your mouth shut.<eos> - Sorry. I will.
Two miles away, on Harvard Drive, this house had their driveway sealed on Wednesday.<eos> Now, we know that when Lexi ran she didn't get very far, so Clark's got to be holding Cara somewhere nearby.<eos> I should get out there.<eos> Wait for backup.<eos> I will.
She is in our class as well.<eos> This is what I want.<eos> Oh, Garrett.<eos> Stacy, will you marry me?<eos> Yes, yes, Garrett, yes, I will!
Previously on "The Strain"...<eos> You may have resigned from Stoneheart, but you haven't resigned from Eldritch Palmer.<eos> You can break this chain of misguided loyalty once and for all.<eos> - I'm not gonna change my mind.<eos> - Yes, you will.
Yeah, you and me both.<eos> I'm missing lunch.<eos> Come on, Jackson.<eos> Don't tell me you haven't chaperoned a patient before.<eos> Okay. Then I won't.
She's the one who won't talk to me.<eos> She's the one being irrational.<eos> I don't think it's irrational to not want to talk to the guy who raped her.<eos> Look, you don't understand, Dylan.<eos> You never will!
No, it feels great.<eos> Just say.<eos> You sure you don't want to stop? No, I want you to come.<eos> I want you to come too.<eos> I will.
I-I ruin my life.<eos> The story's not even about you.<eos> It's about me.<eos> Before you judge, will you please just read the whole book?<eos> No, I won't.
It's the answer.<eos> Do it.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> You will.
Is that the page that August took out of the storybook?<eos> Did you find anything?<eos> I think this door somehow Has something to do with the author.<eos> I just have to figure out where it is.<eos> You will.
They wanted me to put in a good word, you know?<eos> Maybe-- maybe you'd see them.<eos> You don't have to put in a good word.<eos> Just have them call the office.<eos> All right, I will.
That sounds like a death threat to me.<eos> I was being dramatic.<eos> How were you being when you shot her?<eos> Look, you don't understand.<eos> And neither will a jury.
Listen to me, you don't... you don't move from this spot.<eos> Okay? You don't talk to anybody...<eos> Okay, I won't.<eos> Don't move, all right?<eos> I won't, I won't.
I know what that is.<eos> Why do you have that?<eos> - Please don't use it!<eos> - Don't worry.<eos> I won't.
Is that the page that August took out of the storybook?<eos> Did you find anything?<eos> I think this door somehow Has something to do with the author.<eos> I just have to figure out where it is.<eos> You will.
I missed the bus on the way over here and I forgot my phone at home. I...<eos> I had to run half the way over here.<eos> Thanks for driving us home.<eos> Oh, it's fine, I'm sorry your moms couldn't stay to celebrate.<eos> - We will tonight.
And tell me what I want to know, Jenny.<eos> Or I will tear you apart!<eos> They're afraid of you, Frank!<eos> They don't want to be with you!<eos> They will.
You're going to be discovering yourself.<eos> Right. I can do all of that and still be with you.<eos> But if you take this time for yourself... there will be no regrets.<eos> Promise me you'll at least think about it.<eos> Yeah, I will.
– Didn't your father say anything?<eos> – He did.<eos> He was nicer?<eos> Maybe he'll come back too.<eos> – He won't.
He just wants to get your attention. - He got it.<eos> - What are you gonna do?<eos> I don't know, but I can't sit in Sherwood Forest hoping they live up to the ideals of the Constitution.<eos> I can't.<eos> I won't.
He just wants to get your attention. - He got it.<eos> - What are you gonna do?<eos> I don't know, but I can't sit in Sherwood Forest hoping they live up to the ideals of the Constitution.<eos> I can't.<eos> I won't.
Please wake up.<eos> She's gone, honey.<eos> No. No!<eos> - We have to go now.<eos> - No, I won't.
Come on, let's go.<eos> Well... I guess I'm not a hybrid. Just an ass.<eos> You just wanted the choice.<eos> You think the world is ever going to know what really happened?<eos> This time, they will.
Come on, let's go.<eos> Well... I guess I'm not a hybrid. Just an ass.<eos> You just wanted the choice.<eos> You think the world is ever going to know what really happened?<eos> This time, they will.
Well, I'm sorry, but I can't let that happen.<eos> So can we try this my way now?<eos> We already compelled him into art school.<eos> Sorry that I wanted my little brother to actually get a degree.<eos> He will.
Now we have to look at all the wood back here to see if we can find the piece he used to kill Dover.<eos> You don't have to go back to the game, Booth.<eos> Cam and the others found evidence at the scene.<eos> But we got no answers.<eos> Yet, but we will.
I know we're putting you in a very difficult position.<eos> But the guy that we are after killed two little girls.<eos> We really need your grandfather's help.<eos> Just... don't tell him where you got the number.<eos> We won't.
What am I supposed to do?<eos> Just stick with the plan, it's already in motion, right?<eos> Get the gem, assemble SWAT, and we'll capture Liam the moment he comes out of DHS.<eos> This will blow up in our faces if Helen Ellingsworth can still protect Liam.<eos> She won't.
Well, I'm gonna let you now.<eos> Come here.<eos> Just sleep, okay?<eos> You'll know what to do in the morning.<eos> Yeah, I will.
I'll let you know once I make a copy.<eos> Don't call this number.<eos> Call my cell.<eos> Please don't forget.<eos> I won't.
I, uh...<eos> I wanted to thank you for helping her.<eos> Rosetta is a fine girl.<eos> She and the baby will thrive with a few shillings from you, of course.<eos> Yes, she will.
Peruse the inventory, make your pick.<eos> As soon as Charlotte swoops in to seal the deal, we swoop in.<eos> Billy Soto looking fly.<eos> Shame you don't get to see me in action working my magic.<eos> Oh, but we will.
The second it happened, I knew it.<eos> But I didn't know they were gonna do it, I had no idea.<eos> You're a trained liar.<eos> How will I ever know if you're telling the truth?<eos> You won't.
I-I'm sorry.<eos> I'm just frustrated I can't do anything with this stupid hand.<eos> How do you think I feel?<eos> I'm here trying to play scientist, when I really should be trying to make captain.<eos> And you will.
Okay. JT: It's not gonna be easy to keep this from her.<eos> And frankly, I'm not even sure we should.<eos> If we tell her that Julianna escaped, she'll call off the wedding.<eos> Well, Tess is right.<eos> She will.
It's like Craigslist, but without the high probability of being murdered by a deranged medical student.<eos> And about those lamps?<eos> We can't worry about our outdoor business.<eos> We barely have an indoor business.<eos> And we never will, with that attitude.
Is that what you call them?<eos> Men? This wasn't supposed to happen this way.<eos> I didn't want to hurt Mary or anybody else, anybody but them!<eos> I understand.<eos> Maybe a jury will.
The wagon is ready to take her away.<eos> Nobles are waiting.<eos> Promise me you'll take care.<eos> Promise me, Greer, for it is a dangerous world.<eos> I will.
We're good together.<eos> We are.<eos> And I'll miss you, too.<eos> I mean, working together.<eos> I will.
What about him?<eos> 'Cause he's staying over there and you don't want to see him.<eos> Well, he's also working with Crash, another person I don't want to see.<eos> Well, in any case, everyone's gonna be there if you change your mind.<eos> Maybe I will.
[Carisi] Well, find out.<eos> And then tell the pimp that you got a special request.<eos> You got a whale here who's willing to pay top dollar for snow bunnies.<eos> I'll do what I can.<eos> Yeah, you will.
That was a clear case for the Medal for Valor.<eos> Eh. Now, every time you put on the uniform and I see a space where a medal should be, or a commendation bar, yeah.<eos> Yeah, I have regrets.<eos> I don't have regrets, Pop.<eos> Neither will Danny.
I would think it would be obvious.<eos> Typically each side must prove that the other has something to lose by continuing the conflict.<eos> Allowing two British parties to bloody each other further wouldn't be good for either of us.<eos> I'm sorry, have you seen any blood?<eos> Nor will you.
- but now I've lied to everyone and it's all a big mess. - OK.<eos> I just don't know what to do.<eos> Look, I get your dilemma, I do.<eos> - Don't tell anyone about this!<eos> - No, I won't.
He called 911 from a nearby payphone, but when we got here, he was already gone.<eos> Obviously, she's not carrying I.D.<eos> So, uh...<eos> I'm guessing we don't know who she is?<eos> Hopefully we will in a minute.
But I don't go down easy.<eos> When he saw he couldn't get at me, he... went after the thing I loved.<eos> If someone went after my daughter, I... I don't know what I'd do.<eos> - We got to get him. - I will.<eos> I will.
Oh, no, what are you doing?<eos> - I have no idea.<eos> - I'm not sure.<eos> Stop it!<eos> [echoing] Maybe I will, maybe I won't.
No, not you. I want $3 million from whoever hired you.<eos> I assume it's one of the guys in my book, and he's got to have money.<eos> I mean, Olivia Pope don't come cheap, right?<eos> Nobody's paying you $3 million.<eos> One of the publishers will.
Anyone with a stopwatch?<eos> Okay, you know what?<eos> No need to humiliate me.<eos> May the best child win.<eos> - Oh, she will. - Ah.
Not a chance.<eos> Maybe we can use this broom handle to pry it loose.<eos> No, that won't work.<eos> Oh, no.<eos> Yes, it will.
That's right.<eos> Get over here.<eos> It's good to see you.<eos> Stop by the district later.<eos> I will, I will.
Someone slipping in the shower is an accident.<eos> Felicia was thrown out a 20-story window.<eos> She fought back tough, didn't she?<eos> If you say so.<eos> Actually, the medical examiner will.
All the other evidence had closed?<eos> My sister was abducted when I was 12 years old, Inspector.<eos> The trail has gone very, very cold.<eos> You never stopped looking for her.<eos> I never will.
Yeah. Been looking for that.<eos> Since when do you read The Hague Guardian?<eos> You know me, I like to stay well informed.<eos> Then don't forget the doctors appointment tomorrow.<eos> - I won't.
I got shushed, but the purple prose is fine.<eos> Shh!<eos> Okay.<eos> She is gonna pull it off, though, right?<eos> Yes. Yeah, she will.
I thought you were reborn.<eos> Donovan was my one true love.<eos> I thought when he brought me back from the brink of death, it was because he loved me.<eos> He doesn't love me.<eos> He never will.
But it's also crazy and messy and confusing...<eos> - Go on a date with me.<eos> - What?<eos> Gabi, you and I have been through so much, but the one thing we've never done is go on a simple date.<eos> So... will you?
Or not.<eos> A minute, 32 until impact.<eos> What took you so long?<eos> Oh! Uh, please tell me you did not just drop the screwdriver.<eos> Okay, I won't.
You are the past.<eos> Dawn is the future now.<eos> Stop fighting, son!<eos> Give up!<eos> We won't.
Awesome.<eos> I told you we were due for a win.<eos> Good to have you back, pal.<eos> I don't trust you.<eos> I never will.
I never should have put him there.<eos> He'll go to prison for the rest of his life because of me.<eos> One step at a time, Lizzy.<eos> He's not gonna come back.<eos> He will.
- But you're going Hans' tomorrow?<eos> - Will you come with me?<eos> - Do you want me to?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Then I will.
But as long as Donna wants to work for Louis,<eos> I am not gonna force her to work for me.<eos> Okay.<eos> ♪ ♪ Harvey, have you thought about what's going to happen if she doesn't come back?<eos> She will.
I know you think you're helping me...<eos> I am helping you.<eos> You'll see.<eos> - I don't see.<eos> You will.
Perhaps if I stay on with your friends, after the baby's adopted by that couple in Sweden.<eos> I'm doing the right thing... the only thing I can do... is giving up the child.<eos> Thank you for finding me a loving home and family to hide out with.<eos> And as long as Bash doesn't say anything...<eos> He won't.
Yeah, could be Barbie leading the charge.<eos> I'm not dying 'cause you can't pull the trigger on your boyfriend.<eos> Maybe it never comes to that.<eos> Yeah, well, if it does, you'd better not hesitate.<eos> - 'Cause I won't.
If they're alive, it won't be for long.<eos> The kinship still thinks that I'm a part of them, so why don't I head down to town hall, and see what I can find out.<eos> Okay, I'll go check out the other places the Resistance could be hiding.<eos> What if... somehow they know you're not one of them anymore?<eos> Hey, they won't.
Don't hold back, Nolan.<eos> That's what I did with Jack, and look where it got me.<eos> And I have a private jet at your beck and call...<eos> If you want to fix that.<eos> And I will.
Your secrets are safe with me.<eos> Of course in exchange, Helena is going to need a little favor.<eos> From one Queen to another.<eos> - If I refuse?<eos> - You won't.
Victor, the FBI, they're-- They're on their way,<eos> (Sarah) what if those guys come in before they get here?<eos> Upstairs, behind all that stuff in mom's closet.<eos> But if they find us up there...<eos> They won't.
What are you doing here?<eos> I, um... I went by the house.<eos> They told me.<eos> We don't know who did it.<eos> You probably never will.
Holy shit.<eos> No, no, you can't leave him at Julio's.<eos> I have to.<eos> What if someone finds him?<eos> - They won't.
You should have spoken to me.<eos> I thought that you loved me.<eos> I did.<eos> I do.<eos> I always will.
Yes.<eos> Yes.<eos> There you are.<eos> We will find a way through this, you and I.<eos> We will.
Our Father is here.<eos> Faith is useless in this world.<eos> That's not our truth.<eos> It's clear you don't believe in our faith.<eos> Perhaps you never will.
So now what?<eos> Now we wait to see if you live or die.<eos> Aslam.<eos> Pray they find him and he has this flash drive you say is so valuable.<eos> They will.
Killing the boy won't matter.<eos> All we ever needed was his skin.<eos> If you kill him, you may as well kill me.<eos> I'll never forgive you.<eos> Oh, yes, you will.
My cousin is coming to pick us up in the morning.<eos> We'll set up your mom in one of the bedrooms, okay?<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - Aren't we leaving?<eos> Yeah, yeah, we will.
You're stronger than that, brother.<eos> I know you are.<eos> Plagues, wars, communism, Nazis.<eos> Everyone before you held the line.<eos> And so will you, my King.
And now you know.<eos> I'm trying to find him because I'm concerned about him.<eos> I'm worried that his world has just been destroyed and he's alone.<eos> Maybe you can sit back and wait for him to call you, but I can't.<eos> And I won't.
There was just... wasted time and then she was gone.<eos> I don't believe in someday.<eos> Not anymore.<eos> Lucky for you, I do.<eos> And I always will.
This pitch alone would yield over a hundred thousand square feet of prime agricultural land.<eos> Why would anyone play cricket on it when it could be used to feed people?<eos> Because not everyone thinks like you.<eos> - Not yet.<eos> But they will.
I understand why you didn't.<eos> No. You don't.<eos> The blessing of an honest man.<eos> She still hasn't found caul.<eos> She won't.
I just want to go dancing like we used to.<eos> Just one more time.<eos> No, thanks.<eos> I'll go dancing with you.<eos> You will?
You didn't tell us your name.<eos> Once he's finished eating, bring him home.<eos> Give him something to wear that won't draw attention.<eos> What if the government finds out that we are harboring a fugitive?<eos> They won't.
I need you.<eos> I'm not gonna put Victoria in prison.<eos> I'm gonna put her in the ground.<eos> And don't you dare try to stop me.<eos> I won't.
Appreciate that.<eos> How can I help you?<eos> I want you to do something for me.<eos> I'm afraid I don't understand.<eos> You will.
You must ask for an audience.<eos> See her in person.<eos> You are right.<eos> I'll look into her eyes and I'll know.<eos> We both will.
- Did you see what we saw?<eos> - The real Greg Yates?<eos> I just hope the jury saw it.<eos> They haven't yet.<eos> They will.
Yeah. I guess I'm kind of still getting used to talking about that.<eos> Well, so am I.<eos> And sometimes it can be a...<eos> I don't want you to worry.<eos> I won't.
Yes, we're gonna have a party at the house, so I'd love for you all to come.<eos> Of course. We'd love to.<eos> We'll be there.<eos> Sophia, you need to eat something.<eos> And I will.
N-no, doctor.<eos> We shall go, all three of us.<eos> With all due respect, Magistrate...<eos> As magistrate, it is not your respect I require but your obedience.<eos> As you will.
Nolan's whipping us into shape to face your good pal Rahm Tak.<eos> Rahm's no friend of mine.<eos> Any word of your mother?<eos> They haven't caught her yet.<eos> They never will.
~ HE CHUCKLES ~ Why?<eos> Because I love you.<eos> I want you to remember that.<eos> Never forget it.<eos> I won't.
He's colicky, love, that's all it is.<eos> And Arty used to be exactly the same.<eos> He'd get gassed up and there was nothing you could do, and he had lungs on him like a bloody trombone.<eos> He won't feed, Liz.<eos> No, he will.
And I don't want my kids to, either.<eos> - Your kids?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> What happened to Steffan can never happen again.<eos> - It won't.
You wanted to get back at me.<eos> Is it sinking in?<eos> Have you felt it yet?<eos> No.<eos> But you will.
Jason is the only person who can save Atlantis.<eos> I'm going to find Melas.<eos> If anyone knows how to help Jason, Melas surely will.<eos> ~ If they find you...<eos> ~ They won't.
Get out!<eos> There, now.<eos> She feels your pain.<eos> I told you she would.<eos> And soon they all will.
- My husband is this country.<eos> If he fails, it fails.<eos> I'm telling you, I know him.<eos> You need to act now.<eos> The president and I will...
I'm finishing my junior year, and I have no idea what I want to do.<eos> By the time you were my age, you'd already published your first book, and now you're winning this amazing award because you followed your passion.<eos> How can I be amazing if I can't find mine?<eos> Trust me.<eos> You will.
Taking yourself off up here to brood, instead of talking to your wife about the most important decision you'll ever make in your... in all our lives.<eos> You want to go and fight... Stan?<eos> Go. Because you're no bloody good to us like this.<eos> I know every inch of you, man, inside and out. I always have.<eos> I always will.
I'm sorry.<eos> There's no time for that.<eos> We still don't know who this is or how he died.<eos> And we'll figure that out.<eos> Yes, we will.
- Why? What's happened?<eos> Pasiphae's protected me since I was a child.<eos> I realise now that she nurtured me so I would become like her.<eos> But I cannot.<eos> I won't.
You brought merchandise with you?<eos> It is on a shipping container to the Port of Newark Terminal tonight.<eos> One of the 27 statues of Gudea.<eos> Yeah, I recognize it.<eos> So will everyone else.
- You need a head.<eos> I can get you a head... fit for a king.<eos> Why do you delay?<eos> We have paid, we will receive.<eos> Yes, you will.

Hey, Al.<eos> Yeah?<eos> I'm heading out.<eos> Did you finish that engine transfer on that Jeep?<eos> I will tomorrow.
They meaning us and not you.<eos> How you should leave us behind if we can't keep up.<eos> Glenn is out there risking his life for you and for everyone else and I'm still here, so I don't know what the hell you're talking about.<eos> Things are gonna get worse and then we'll see.<eos> Yeah, we will.
What is it?<eos> We will not defeat them on steeds.<eos> You will know what to do.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> You will.
I want him to find his place in the world.<eos> I just don't believe for a second it's here.<eos> And if you're honest with yourself, you'd agree.<eos> No, I don't.<eos> You will.
Marcus admired Alex.<eos> On some level, he might have envied him, but... .. I can't believe he'd want to harm him.<eos> Could you arrange a meeting?<eos> So you do have something specific you're going to speak to him about?<eos> - We will.
The judge will never let Lena and Stef adopt me.<eos> It just wasn't meant to be.<eos> I should probably go back to my room.<eos> I'm afraid Mariana's going to wake up.<eos> She won't.
That girl sleeps like the dead, you know that.<eos> I wish we could stay here forever.<eos> ...and ever and ever.<eos> Do you think they know yet?<eos> They will soon.
Yes, but it... - We didn't do anything wrong.<eos> - You don't think so?<eos> We can't... We can't ever tell anyone.<eos> I know.<eos> We won't.
Okay. That's a bad idea.<eos> No, it's not.<eos> If Jack thinks I signed Dellmore, and I tell him I'll give him a piece, he'll know it's worth a fortune to him and he'll overturn the vote.<eos> And what are you gonna do when he finds out the whole thing was a lie?<eos> He won't.
But even so, Kakarot.<eos> I have no interest in being the second best!<eos> One day I will surpass you!<eos> No...<eos> I will surpas everyone in this universe!
Thank you.<eos> Of course.<eos> And, Allison, please don't tell anyone about this.<eos> Anyone.<eos> I won't.

Well, he didn't break in.<eos> Do you know how he could get in?<eos> I have no idea.<eos> Come to the station tomorrow if you want to press charges.<eos> - I will.
Why are we hugging?<eos> Cos this is it.<eos> This is goodbye.<eos> I'm never going to see you again with your new cat insurance job and your new wife and your...<eos> You will.

No.<eos> But if you did... what would you do if you knew how long you had?<eos> I would try and figure out how to be happy.<eos> Then why don't you?<eos> Maybe I will.
When I grow up, I'm going to live here in the Moors with you.<eos> Then we can look after each other.<eos> You don't have to wait until you're older.<eos> You could live here now.<eos> Then I will!
Do you think you can work out where that is?<eos> I mean, there can't be... too many places that fit that description.<eos> Training's over. I'll see you tomorrow.<eos> We don't even know where we're going.<eos> We will soon enough.

Forgive me.<eos> You are my son...<eos> I need you to listen...<eos> You didn't tell Caesar about the guns we found?<eos> Neither will you.
What about now?<eos> I feel... different.<eos> It's like she sort of cleaned me out or something.<eos> Um, do you think you'll still play the show?<eos> Yeah, I will.
Now I spend every fucking minute praying to be somebody else. Somebody I'm not!<eos> Anybody-<eos> Just put the gun down, Ed. She doesn't love you anymore.<eos> You don't, do you?<eos> And you never will.
I just wanted to be what you wanted. What you wanted.<eos> Now I spend every fucking minute trying to be something else, something I'm not.<eos> Just put the gun down, Ed. She doesn't love you anymore.<eos> You don't, do you?<eos> NO. And you never will.
So, how are people supposed to know when...<eos> Forget the when!<eos> What... what when?<eos> What I mean is, how will they know what's on?<eos> They won't.
How did you feel when she threw you aside?<eos> When she's ready, get her on a boat.<eos> Captain, this isn't what I meant by cleaning up.<eos> What if she comes back?<eos> She won't.
- At table.<eos> - I dribble like I want.<eos> I'm too strong.<eos> - What it does, the arbitrator?<eos> It will cardboard.
Hell, you've been gone for a month doing who knows what.<eos> Who do you think has been taking care of business around here?<eos> No one.<eos> I need you to check this one again, Eddie.<eos> Will you?
- It'll only take a second.<eos> - I'm serious.<eos> I can't today.<eos> Tell him to come tomorrow.<eos> - I will.
Way to wiggle out of getting beat.<eos> You and Mom going for a drive?<eos> Well, that was the plan.<eos> She'll come around.<eos> No, she won't.

It was given under oath at the inquest by the family gamekeeper,<eos> Benjamin Pickstock and his son Robert, that O'Connell had been sworn to be revenged on Blaise-Hamilton...<eos> ..for a just flogging received at his hand.<eos> We found no record of the trial.<eos> Nor will you.
It was such a long time ago.<eos> It's like it... It's like it never really happened.<eos> One thing you should understand.<eos> I loved my brother.<eos> I always will.

Why did he have to go?<eos> I don't know.<eos> - It just doesn't make sense.<eos> - I know.<eos> It never will.

I would love to be like you, Mr Hereward.<eos> I would love to be young and zealous and full of ideals.<eos> But what happens in St Gideon's is real, and compromised and shabby.<eos> And that can change.<eos> Maybe one day it will.

We're not gonna kill a child.<eos> Agent Callen, why don't you ask your partner what we should do.<eos> We'll take her with us.<eos> If she slows us down-- and I want you to understand this-- you're trading her life for Kensi's.<eos> She won't.
Please.<eos> Be my guest.<eos> Deliver this to the spaniard.<eos> Nobody must know.<eos> Nobody will.
These drugs are... Hardcore.<eos> Close your eyes.<eos> I came to say bye.<eos> I want to see you.<eos> You will.

The hospital is now running at a deficit of nearly $30,000 a year.<eos> Now, in light of this, I've taken the liberty of postponing the much-needed repairs in the courtyard.<eos> Now, Dr. Thackery, as you were Dr. Christiansen's Deputy Chief of Surgery, the board would like you to step into his position as Chief.<eos> We'd be grateful if you'd accept.<eos> I will, though with great regret.
Who?<eos> Give us a name.<eos> He will bury you.<eos> Well, we'll see about that.<eos> Yeah, you will.
If Torbin Salvi succeeds, these chickens will only be coming back to Russia to roost.<eos> Yes, but here I have my chicken in hand.<eos> Dominik Salvi is personally responsible... for the deaths of hundreds of innocent Russians.<eos> My country deserves to see him pay.<eos> And they will.
- So I'll call you after.<eos> - All right, cool.<eos> I'll buy the coffee, but I want you to do all the talking.<eos> I want to know what's going on.<eos> You will.
And I think it's good that we clear this up.<eos> Anyway, uh, I imagine it's a difficult time.<eos> Ethan must be taking the breakup badly.<eos> He can't understand it.<eos> Well, he will...
Don't.<eos> Let him turn.<eos> Cross any of these people, you kill them.<eos> Don't hesitate.<eos> They won't.

Now, make sure you listen to the tone of the cuckoo on this one.<eos> Ready.<eos> Will you...<eos> Marry me?<eos> Will you?
Oh, so this is where you keep the clones.<eos> Ah, obviously you're part of a high-security program.<eos> Yeah, most restricted projects are entirely compartmentalized.<eos> Right, so smart people don't know what they're actually working on.<eos> Ah, but you will.
He screamed, and he fell off of me, and... and that's when I ran.<eos> You have been amazing.<eos> He didn't break me.<eos> I want him to know that.<eos> He will.

My kingdom for a lobe.<eos> Didn't expect to see you again.<eos> Do you know how many nights I laid awake, year after year wondering where you were, if you ever thought about me?<eos> Did you? Ever? No.<eos> I will now, though.
No!<eos> No!<eos> Whoever did this to her is going to suffer.<eos> You cannot die until you have known... Complete despair.<eos> And you will.
I've made a lot of mistakes, so... I understand why you're not here.<eos> I just want you to know I don't blame you.<eos> This is on me.<eos> I've always loved you.<eos> I always will.
I need you to know that no matter what happens, I'll keep you out of it.<eos> You can't keep me out of it, Dash.<eos> I helped you.<eos> No one knows that.<eos> And no one ever will.
Nice try, Fedora.<eos> We got numbers, bro.<eos> - Nicely done. - Mm-hmm.<eos> Be good to her.<eos> Oh, we will.
But that's not gonna happen unless you leave tonight.<eos> You were so small when they took you from me.<eos> And now I...<eos> I can't lose you again.<eos> You won't.
So, you're home.<eos> ى.<eos> So, you do however, the "night games"?<eos> It depends. He's coming?<eos> No, it will not.
You're good?<eos> - Yeah. It's the right call.<eos> - I'll let Brandon know. - Ok.<eos> Oh, and tell him if he wants to come by, that, you know, I'm here.<eos> - I will. - Ok.

You will put an end to this shameful charade today.<eos> Because if you don't, I will.<eos> I will tell your husband myself.<eos> No.<eos> No, you won't.
I want you to delete them, Sandra-- all of them.<eos> I can't.<eos> Those calls are part of the public record.<eos> They're evidence, confessions, dying words.<eos> I won't.
Any later...?<eos> I'll not be able to take it, even if you leave me today...<eos> So do you wanna get married?<eos> Will you?<eos> You will!

Is my car still out back or did you move that, too?<eos> It's still there.<eos> Please don't say anything.<eos> To Jax.<eos> I won't.

All those in favor of moving forward with the Mayoral Toast and Roast, let me hear you hoot.<eos> Belles, I understand there are some among you that may take issue with my new boyfriend.<eos> It is true that Davis Polk is a Gainey, but he is also a wonderful and honest man.<eos> That said, if you feel the need to censure me or even ask for my resignation as Belle co-leader, I will not object.<eos> Well, I will.
- Let's have a drink, man, toast our goodbye.<eos> - Well, I only drink with people that I like or I pretend to like, but I will indulge in one of these cigarettes.<eos> - Shit, I didn't even know you smoked.<eos> - Well, there's a lot of things you don't know about me, Darryl Crowe Jr.<eos> - And you never will. - Ha!
They're coming for me.<eos> It's time we finally meet.<eos> Can't say I'm a fan... of this double-blind situation.<eos> How will the field teams meet us at the destinations?<eos> They won't.

Are you okay?<eos> How was that?<eos> Alarmingly convincing.<eos> Just stop freaking out, okay?<eos> Now I will.
But why choose Kingston Tanner as your target?<eos> Oh, no, no.<eos> No. He chose me.<eos> He's been taking my name in vain to increase his coffers, so I thought it best to teach the man a lesson and show the world what religion truly represents.<eos> And we will.
Discharge on 27?<eos> Uh, that is correct.<eos> What does that mean?<eos> Discharged with further investigation in case we find any additional holes in your alibi.<eos> You won't.

Her tragic end came when you drained her body of blood...<eos> All for a spell to smother the wolf within Niklaus, as memory serves.<eos> Actually, Elijah, your memory doesn't serve you at all.<eos> You just don't realize it yet, but by the time we are done here...<eos> You will.
Do I have a choice?<eos> Now you have blackmail on me.<eos> I'm gonna take that as a yes.<eos> You know, I'm not going to tell anyone, Lauren.<eos> None of us will.

In a short time, you have become too important.<eos> We can't.<eos> You have to focus on your relationship with Jane, and I'll only get in the way.<eos> No.<eos> No, you won't.
Even I'm not ready for that one yet.<eos> I think what Chas meant was, um, Don't go wandering around here without a chaperone, all right?<eos> Right.<eos> Each one of these stigmata represents A place where something bad is going down.<eos> Supernatural brushfires, if you will.

Now, if I target concentrated micro-frequency waves-- which this remote emits-- to the second floor circuit breaker, then I can cause it to short out.<eos> But I will need an accelerant.<eos> Which I almost have for you.<eos> Even if we get a fire going to flush them out, they have guns.<eos> Then so will we.
I have David.<eos> Even after he reunited with Emily.<eos> You keep waiting for blowback, but it hasn't happened.<eos> - Not yet.<eos> - It won't.

My handlers want to wait until you use the courtroom shooting to humanize yourself and then we'll leak that you were, in fact, sleeping with your boss.<eos> - Is that a threat?<eos> - No.<eos> I told you I won't go negative, Alicia.<eos> - And I won't.

No way.<eos> I won't let you.<eos> I can't even pay the rent.<eos> Yeah, you can.<eos> And, yes, you will.
And then, I felt everything in me... just let go of everything I was holding onto so tightly... and it hit me that I don't have an intellectual reason.<eos> I trust myself, I trust my feelings.<eos> I'm not gonna try to be anything other than who I am anymore... and I hope you can accept that.<eos> I can.<eos> I will.

I contracted it too.<eos> I've loved you since that day you rescued my hat.<eos> I've loved you since the wind brought you to me.<eos> Please marry me.<eos> I will.
I love you.<eos> You just go to sleep, ok?<eos> I'm scared.<eos> I don't want to die.<eos> - You will not.
Because I knew right then and there, you'd be an amazing father.<eos> But, I need you. You know?<eos> I don't wanna do this without you.<eos> You have me.<eos> You always will.
I'd love to...<eos> Now hand over my baby.<eos> Bo promised...<eos> She promised nothing would happen to my baby.<eos> Then nothing will.

I'm sure the sellswords prefer to fight for the winning side.<eos> I imagine you're right.<eos> I'd like to talk to the Titan's Bastard about winning.<eos> He may not agree to meet.<eos> He will.
Many surprises for her.<eos> How am I supposed to sit here planning a war when you're over there looking like that?<eos> Will you come with me one day to Volantis?<eos> When all this is over?<eos> I will.
You really want to make me feel old, do you?<eos> - Can I have one? - Go ahead.<eos> Another thing.<eos> Quit smoking.<eos> Maybe this way he will, too.
I nearly tripped over your crap on the way out.<eos> Are you still coming by this weekend to get it out?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, I will.<eos> I will.
Well, I hope you're wrong.<eos> But you're probably not.<eos> Of course, we don't have Louis' side of the story.<eos> I still haven't heard from him.<eos> Perhaps we never will.
I felt as if I knew her.<eos> I think this is a very brave decision.<eos> Will you come back for her christening?<eos> Yes.<eos> Of course, I will.
It's almost midnight.<eos> - I don't want to stop working.<eos> - Neither do I.<eos> We shouldn't let our momentum die.<eos> We won't.
Well, that's kind of a simplification.<eos> Is it, though?<eos> You died, Leena died, and now, the whole damn world is dying.<eos> Claud, Claud, Claud, Pete and myka will find a cure.<eos> - They will.
Giuliano!<eos> As I was saying, the timbre of the barrel is also indicative of its general properties.<eos> Start again.<eos> Don't scrimp on the sulfur this time!<eos> He won't.
You make it every time.<eos> He's done the coin thing, has he?<eos> You're the map maker.<eos> I thought you needed rescuing?<eos> - I will.
I so wanted to love everything about you, but it was just not there.<eos> What I am trying to say is:<eos> Natasha Moss...<eos> Want to let you divorce me?<eos> Yes... Yes, I will! I will definitely.
Erik:<eos> Even so, he was my kinsman.<eos> We must avenge his death.<eos> It was done in the name of king Aelle, and king Aelle must suffer for it.<eos> One day, he will...
And the award for Worst Girlfriend Ever! Goes to me...<eos> She'll forgive you.<eos> Here's to your Dawning.<eos> May you not die.<eos> - I won't.
I don't wanna see you slip back into old habits.<eos> I won't.<eos> It's gonna be different this year.<eos> Resolutions are only good if you stick with them, Scott.<eos> I will.
Because it seems just the opposite.<eos> I pay by direct this and ensure our interests , thing you're doing.<eos> And the question arises: where is my gold?<eos> Oh, I have, Judah.<eos> You will.
Yes.<eos> You see here, these two finger nails broken.<eos> Skin, from her assailant.<eos> Now, Inspector you will confirm that I have not yet opened this sack.<eos> I will.
We know that they take bribes.<eos> Everyone knows it!<eos> They shame your good name.<eos> So, when you are gone, and the Philistines return, and we look to your sons to call on God... will God answer?<eos> No, he will not.
Yes.<eos> I'm with someone else now.<eos> You know that.<eos> But I feel an infinite tenderness for you.<eos> I always will.
Look at this, it's tibor.<eos> Where is the money for the car?<eos> I don't quite have it on me, but I'm...<eos> - You don't have it on you, eh?<eos> - I will definitely...
- Wait, what?<eos> - Hey!<eos> Kristoff!<eos> Don't come back!<eos> We won't.
Thanks.<eos> You should eat.<eos> Don't fight.<eos> She'll win.<eos> I will.
What?<eos> Uh, Shawn, I thought that you said we were going to the Le Cirque show.<eos> Yeah. This is a dress rehearsal.<eos> Yes, but we promised Max that he would be seeing the show.<eos> And he will.
- Huh?<eos> - What are you doing?<eos> - Hmm?<eos> Will you please Wang Chung with me?<eos> - Will you--
You are too old.<eos> Just let her go.<eos> Listen to reason.<eos> I'm going with you.<eos> And you will too.
Listen to reason.<eos> I'm going with you.<eos> And you will too.<eos> I'm not leaving.<eos> Yes, you will.
They are really good at this.<eos> Stronger than me.<eos> - They will find this murderer.<eos> - She's right.<eos> We will.
It just goes on and on.<eos> Relentless.<eos> It will stop, I promise.<eos> I just thought, when she woke up, we would get some answers.<eos> And you will.
What?<eos> It's just what?<eos> Nothing.<eos> I'll win the next round.<eos> Too right you will.
No.<eos> It's the one next to him.<eos> His name was Jason Winters.<eos> And where will we find Mr Winters?<eos> You won't.
Ah, I have cousins there.<eos> They have a fine orchestra.<eos> If they won't have me, it will mean a cap on the pavement.<eos> Will you go back to fight this war, Colonel?<eos> We both will.
I love you.<eos> - Are you gonna leave?<eos> - No.<eos> Everybody always leaves.<eos> I won't.
He was freaking out about the whole kid thing.<eos> What whole kid thing?<eos> About how I may be Kev's kid.<eos> Debs, be home for dinner.<eos> - I will.
Look.<eos> I don't think she's ever gonna know what you did.<eos> Even if she did know, when all this comes to light,<eos> I honestly believe that she'll think what you did was courageous.<eos> Everybody will.
You were gonna ask me to go talk to him for you.<eos> - Would ya, Hank, please?<eos> - No, can't do it.<eos> - Won't do it.<eos> - Of course he will.
All these years I have sat at home, while you've gone out and had your fun!<eos> Do you think that I want to be this way?<eos> Do you think that it makes me happy?<eos> Now I'm meant to feel sorry for you, is that right?<eos> Well, maybe I will tomorrow.
You arrogant bitch, you judge her before even seeing her!<eos> That was her choice.<eos> Good day.<eos> - Will she see me?<eos> - No. No, she won't.
Hey, can you fill the car up?<eos> You can use the card.<eos> - Yup.<eos> - Don't forget.<eos> - I won't.
You're... you're my...<eos> You're my boy, Danny, and I let you down.<eos> I'm so, so sorry.<eos> I love you zillions, superstar.<eos> I always will.
And I lost everything.<eos> But his sacrifice won't be forgotten.<eos> Killing people isn't going to bring your husband back.<eos> No.<eos> It won't.
That is, if he makes it through the night.<eos> At least Will remains in one piece... for now.<eos> His temperature is 105.<eos> White blood cell count is twice normal, and they still can't identify the source of his infection.<eos> They will.
Someone here asked me if I kept my stained clothes.<eos> How did that make you feel?<eos> Like I wanted to go home.<eos> But I don't have a home anymore, do I?<eos> You will.
Totally.<eos> Wait, what?<eos> You weren't here. We all had breakfast.<eos> I haven't even met him.<eos> Well, you will.
He's more interesting.<eos> I just wish I could have found morrissey.<eos> I know I'll never see him again.<eos> Don't say that.<eos> Of course you will.
Set the sail.<eos> Floki!<eos> The sail!<eos> - She'll sink.<eos> - No, she bloody won't.
I'm sorry that I attacked you at the reception.<eos> It's just, I saw you up there, singing with Blaine, and I saw the old, legendary chemistry.<eos> I saw two soul mates rediscovering each other, and I was jealous. Why couldn't that be me?<eos> Why can't I have that with someone?<eos> You will, just not with me.
What?<eos> 'In your face, Chloe!<eos> '<eos> Right, who wants a beer?<eos> - I will.
Uh, please, my apologies.<eos> Uh, I must go, but I can come back to translate fully if you like.<eos> (Kate) Thank you.<eos> Do you know who did this to her?<eos> No, but we will.
This is good.<eos> This is really good.<eos> We just gotta find the mode of transport, the timing.<eos> - He doesn't have the business yet.<eos> - He will.
I'm sorry, Doctor.<eos> Jane's had some problems, uh... taking stuff.<eos> Oh. Well, that's the first I've ever heard of that.<eos> Well, in that case, let's empty your pocket.<eos> No, I will not.
I thought you fell asleep.<eos> No.<eos> Just thinking about work.<eos> I don't have anything for you yet.<eos> I will soon.
Why would I be upset?<eos> Okay, see, this is why I wanted to stay at the Four Seasons, So you wouldn't have to deal with this.<eos> Castle, I shouldn't have to deal with this Because you should've said no.<eos> Yes, but I didn't, and now I can't. I know.<eos> I'll...
Put that back.<eos> Exactly how it was.<eos> Put it back.<eos> Stuart, what if he doesn't find anything?<eos> He will.
Now, several hours after this video was taken, we injected Allegra with our Serum RM47.<eos> We expanded on the University of Wisconsin studies on induced pluripotent stem cells.<eos> Meet Allegra today.<eos> I'll have what she's having.<eos> And you will.
I wasn't really thinking about you at all.<eos> Any of you.<eos> Just wanted the jewels.<eos> I hope you'll all forgive me someday.<eos> You will?
You took the blame.<eos> There's no point both of us rotting away in here.<eos> How can I ever repay you?<eos> Oh, you will.<eos> My friend, you will.
He's ready.<eos> Hey, doc, do you think maybe you could call her?<eos> Maybe that would work.<eos> It'd be really great to see her again.<eos> You will.
The new quartermaster,<eos> Barbara L. Tottingham, will not buy us any more uni-balls.<eos> There's not one single uni-ball in this entire firm.<eos> - Please stop saying uni-ball.<eos> - No, I will not.
This isn't an environmental allegation.<eos> No, it's a bribery charge, it's got teeth, and it's coming your way.<eos> Don't sugarcoat it, Mr. Specter.<eos> Give it to me straight.<eos> Okay, I will.
But I will make you share my pain, Kenobi.<eos> Satine.<eos> Remember, my dear Obi-Wan...<eos> I've loved you always.<eos> I always will.
How'd you find out -- organized crime tip?<eos> Organized wife tip.<eos> She has access to the guest lists for these types of things.<eos> She's not gonna be there, is she?<eos> Yeah, she will.
And I know you'll ask all the right questions.<eos> Stop staring. You're hurting my head.<eos> If that's what you really want.<eos> It is.<eos> All right, I will.
He knows who and where Drew is.<eos> He won't...<eos> It's easy, Raylan.<eos> You just stuff that file, tell him we've got all the evidence that we need, and then you give him a little nudge or a thinly veiled threat, and he'll spook.<eos> He won't.
I am what you have made me.<eos> More soldiers return.<eos> They pry wood and beams searching for vermin.<eos> If we stay, will they not find us?<eos> They will.
Why didn't you tell me he was gonna hurt himself?<eos> I never would've done it.<eos> How could I have known?<eos> - I just want all this to go away.<eos> - It will.
Look, Gibbs, for all intents and purposes, he's on your team now.<eos> So that means it's your job to protect him and my job to protect you.<eos> Give him time to figure things out.<eos> And if he doesn't?<eos> He will.
I'm sorry.<eos> I love you, Sasha.<eos> No matter what.<eos> I always have.<eos> And I always will.
Can you tell him to call his son?<eos> Can you please just...<eos> I don't...<eos> Tell him that his son wants to speak to him.<eos> Of course I will.
I can do all the treatments in there.<eos> I'll be in control.<eos> He'll be trapped.<eos> - Look, if he gets out again...<eos> - He won't.
I can't say.<eos> Why not?<eos> I'll get in trouble.<eos> No, no, no, Wendy.<eos> No, you won't.
You were, uh, an anomaly in Jason's brain, to... to be eliminated.<eos> I never thought of you as a person.<eos> How could I keep making a drug that would kill another person?<eos> I can't.<eos> I won't.
What can I say?<eos> I treat dangerous people.<eos> It's a hazard of the job.<eos> Besides, you have no proof that Zach Hamilton is guilty of anything.<eos> I will.
No.<eos> I want to do it in person.<eos> You got to get me a chopper, and from now on,<eos> I want to be in charge of her safety detail.<eos> Like hell you will!
Emily? It feels like home when you see a friendly face.<eos> Uh, this is for you.<eos> It's from my mom.<eos> Tell her I said thank you and I look forward to having her over for tea as soon as I'm settled in.<eos> I will.
When are you going?<eos> - So I can plan.<eos> - Did you read my mail?<eos> I never read it.<eos> I never will.
What did you say?<eos> Leave me alone!<eos> Hey!<eos> - Stop it!<eos> - Will you...
Guess I'm afraid that you'll be her role model, and I'll be some putz who hangs around sometimes.<eos> You're not the putz who hangs around.<eos> Come on.<eos> They need the bed. I don't want to lose her.<eos> You won't.
I didn't even write it on paper.<eos> I had cooked it up fresh in my mind.<eos> Yet they stole it.<eos> That means yöu never wrote anything.<eos> I will...for yöu.
No, you need my help now.<eos> Police are closing in.<eos> There's nothing I can do.<eos> Do they know I'm here?<eos> No, not yet, but they soon will.
I'm lucky you're here with me.<eos> And I'll get through it.<eos> I'll get back on track.<eos> They won't even find out I was using.<eos> Yes, they will.
All of it.<eos> Because if this doesn't work, I'll be expelled.<eos> And my whole future will be over.<eos> Hey, I'll find something.<eos> I will.
Stop running!<eos> You can't help me, Master.<eos> Someone's setting me up!<eos> I believe you, Ahsoka!<eos> But no one else will!
Yeah. This town's lousy with magic.<eos> Now you should go.<eos> If Neal suspects anything, it's gonna make everything we have to do that much harder.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> He won't.
Now this guy has some powerful magic, mate.<eos> He's untouchable.<eos> You'll never get another chance to take him down.<eos> Oh, I will.<eos> I will indeed.
- Because we don't know if it's going to work.<eos> - It could.<eos> It's too risky.<eos> No one will go along with it.<eos> Yes, we will.
- All right. - Okay.<eos> - Here we go.<eos> - Bye. Have fun.<eos> - See you in a bit.<eos> I will. [ Chuckle ]
Why do I feel like I'm not getting the whole story?<eos> Because you're not getting the whole story.<eos> I'm working a case.<eos> Will you cover for me, please? Uh...<eos> Of course you will.
She was so much a part of my life.<eos> But I have my work and I have Emmalin.<eos> And you have friends who care about you deeply.<eos> Don't forget that.<eos> I won't.
I appreciate the offer, I do. But no way.<eos> What's that?<eos> My number.<eos> In case you change your mind.<eos> I won't.
Why do you want to rush into war?<eos> I don't want to take charge of a platoon and be the only guy who doesn't have a combat patch.<eos> Sorry, I don't date customers, especially soldiers.<eos> My number, in case you change your mind.<eos> I won't.
Maybe I should stay here for a little while.<eos> Maybe we should hold off on the whole moving-in-together a little bit.<eos> Sure, if that's what you really want.<eos> Just don't go too far away.<eos> I won't.
- Yes.<eos> - I don't want that<eos> - to happen again.<eos> - I know.<eos> It won't.
Let's just say I made peace with that fact.<eos> [Groaning]<eos> Peace?<eos> You love Elena.<eos> You always will.
My family got to Texas.<eos> They're, uh waiting for me.<eos> Well, then you have to get back to them.<eos> I want you to know I love you, Aaron.<eos> I always will.
And all interested parties have been assured results from your team.<eos> Ha, ha, well...<eos> We appreciate the confidence.<eos> I just don't understand why a Jane Doe would draw the attention of the IIB.<eos> You will.
Well, the question is, how do we search it?<eos> We don't.<eos> We keep our distance and let Neal search on his own.<eos> Does he know where to look?<eos> He will.
As soon as I set foot in my country...<eos> I'm going to be killed.<eos> ♪ Blue Bloods 3x15 ♪ Warriors Original Air Date on February 15, 2013<eos> I can assure you that nothing came from this office.<eos> Nor will anything.
Orphans and paupers!<eos> Their father dies a traitor.<eos> His lands will be forfeit.<eos> And who do you think will get them?<eos> SHE will.
Here.<eos> Make sure you always come back alive.<eos> Miles, I can't take this.<eos> I... I-I don't want this.<eos> One day, maybe your son will.
So we'll... we'll never know?<eos> It needs to unfurl on its own, Anonymously, Where the world can't interfere.<eos> And if she's carrying what we think,<eos> You will know.<eos> We all will.
Gates will see.<eos> I don't care.<eos> I can't believe this is happening.<eos> We're gonna find her, Castle.<eos> We will.
I don't--I don't...<eos> I-I need to have more time.<eos> Maybe we can do that sometime, you know, someday.<eos> How will I know if you made it?<eos> Oh, you won't.
- Sir. - Something is going on.<eos> My hellhound has been killed.<eos> Winchester, jumbo size, is trying to break into the mother ship and that prophet of theirs is madly translating away.<eos> - Add it up.<eos> - I will, sir.
I appreciate your honesty very much.<eos> Shall we get on?<eos> -You only have one computer, is that correct?<eos> -Yes. But I don't see what that's got to do with what happened to that woman.<eos> You will.
Dad?<eos> If you want to tell us more... about the fire, about what happened, then maybe it'd be good to get it off your chest.<eos> And then maybe this... haunting, whatever it is... well, maybe it'll stop.<eos> Think about it.<eos> I will.
Kevin Spacey is Keyser Soze.<eos> Takes all the names from the things in the room.<eos> Listen, if the CIA finds out we've been harboring an alien, they'll kill us all.<eos> He's not gonna tell anybody.<eos> He will.
Aw, honey.<eos> Is everyone else's tushie filling out except yours?<eos> Yes.<eos> What if my ass never comes in?<eos> Oh, it will.
But it's SOCO, they've had their hands everywhere.<eos> Dirty Brian.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Sir, do you think we'll get them, the killer?<eos> We will.
Mr. Shikijoh...<eos> Do you think he'll really come here?<eos> He will.
Perfect.<eos> I keep checking to see if something's changed, if somehow he knows his mother's... gone, but...<eos> He's too little.<eos> He couldn't possibly understand.<eos> He will one day.
Could you give us a second, please?<eos> I was hoping you'd come.<eos> I wanted to say good-bye this time.<eos> "Good-bye" makes me feel like I'll never see you again.<eos> You won't.
Go, go, go!<eos> [Tires squealing]<eos> [Tires squealing]<eos> Don't forget to breathe.<eos> He won't.
[Tires squealing]<eos> [Tires squealing]<eos> Don't forget to breathe.<eos> He won't.<eos> I won't.
Oh, here it is.<eos> Okay.<eos> - You want to hear my pitch? - Mmm-hmm.<eos> A strong, independent woman, starting her own business.<eos> An "entrepreneu-her," if you will.
Some of it is illegal, and some of it's just downright disgusting.<eos> I'm talking "no amount of Lysol's gonna clean that corporate jet" disgusting.<eos> You know what he's talking about, right?<eos> - Actually, I don't.<eos> - Oh, soon you will.
I wanted to thank you for allowing us the use of the tavern.<eos> Yeah, sure, but you'll have to excuse me.<eos> I'm running late.<eos> Actually, we were hoping to discuss involving you with the campaign in a more official capacity.<eos> Our very own, uh, "Joe the plumber," if you will.
Ken Richards wouldn't lie to me.<eos> Someone put a gag on him.<eos> I want to talk to Mr. Richards.<eos> No.<eos> I will.
But I will grant an emergency hearing for a preliminary injunction.<eos> Thank you.<eos> My courtroom, tomorrow, 10:00 A.M.<eos> Come prepared with a real argument.<eos> Yes, I will.
But we must go now or we'll get stick.<eos> Do any of you ever leave school?<eos> I'm sneaking off.<eos> I wish I knew why.<eos> You will.
- How are you?<eos> - Good, you?<eos> Don't be late.<eos> Call if you need to.<eos> I will.
I reckon Jimmy's right.<eos> They say that to everyone who fails.<eos> Well, I reckon you work hard and you deserve to succeed.<eos> You just have to stick at it...<eos> and you will.
But, it'll be a few weeks more.<eos> I hope you don't mind.<eos> Not if you make yourselves useful.<eos> Try to be strong, my darling.<eos> I will.
I'm not talking about Scully!<eos> Now, given that every museum in the world is filled with art created from this basic impulse, the greatest literature... the most beautiful music.<eos> The study of sex is the study of the beginning of all life, and science holds the key.<eos> Yet we sit huddled in the dark like prudish cavemen, filled with shame and... and...guilt... when the truth is, nobody understands sex.<eos> And now nobody will.
Do it.<eos> It's done.<eos> $10 million.<eos> (Voice breaking) What if he doesn't call?<eos> He will.
You can't always get out of everything with hugs, let go of me.<eos> - I won't let go.<eos> - Serena, let go of me.<eos> - Let go of me!<eos> - I won't.
Miss Arletty bought me two songs.<eos> I'll live somewhere else.<eos> I'll be on the radio.<eos> Will you listen to me?<eos> I will, like anybody else.
You will be happy.<eos> I don't see myself being happy.<eos> I self-sabotage.<eos> Well, now that you recognize that tendency, maybe you can change.<eos> But I won't.
I think it better start being now.<eos> (clicks)<eos> It's empty.<eos> Well, I didn't know that.<eos> And neither will they.
- Oh, good.<eos> It's you.<eos> Your majesty. I didn't do anything wrong.<eos> But I will say that I am guilty if I can just pay the fine and go home.<eos> No, you won't.
Ade and Navid...<eos> Go.<eos> Navid and I are fine.<eos> We have each other.<eos> We always will.
Oh, my God, are you serious?<eos> Yeah.<eos> And it's romantic as hell, and I'm not taking no for an answer this time.<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, I will.
How you understand your job, that is the point.<eos> Sometimes you're not gonna like yourself very much for the decisions you have to make; knowing how the men feel about the decision you made... but you're gonna have to make that tough decision again and again because that is the job you accepted.<eos> I get that.<eos> No, you don't.<eos> But you will.
Why not what?<eos> Some of us are going on to the Embassy later.<eos> Oh, what fun.<eos> Oh, well, you can come, if you'd like.<eos> I will.
Do they know what they have in you?<eos> I know what I have in them.<eos> So, have you decided whether or not you will come to the ball?<eos> Oh, how can you ask?<eos> Of course I will!
I'm sorry.<eos> Freddy, he was my partner, and he was my friend, but he wouldn't be dead if it weren't for this dome.<eos> You're gonna have to tell Rusty.<eos> He'll understand.<eos> Like hell he will!
Okay, what's going on?<eos> You're not acting like yourself.<eos> I-I'm scared.<eos> What if the dome lasts forever?<eos> It won't.
I would not trust her unless she earns it.<eos> Get some rest.<eos> Let's be careful out there.<eos> McGee.<eos> We will.
Uh, how about, uh...<eos> We play for it?<eos> I win, you do the job for me.<eos> - And when I win?<eos> - You won't.
But I'm gonna need help from all of you To prove it.<eos> The caterers should be doing that.<eos> Oh, it's all right. I need to keep busy.<eos> If you need any help...<eos> I won't.
You may have gotten distracted while I was talking.<eos> You were spewing vile rumors about a dead woman, trying to shock me.<eos> Now, that's just silly.<eos> I don't think so.<eos> And neither will Nicholas.
And I'm gonna be happy...<eos> Very soon!<eos> Seriously, Rosie,<eos> I don't understand what you mean.<eos> You will.
And you can come visit me if you want.<eos> Might even need you to do some of my homework.<eos> I'm really gonna miss you, Axl.<eos> I know, Brick.<eos> Everyone will.
- Because I will not.<eos> I will. Be be honest.<eos> You will save people, but I will not be saved.<eos> You can not handle, you want to sleep with me.<eos> - No, I will not.
Yes, of course I want to have sex with you.<eos> But it's more important than sex.<eos> Wendy...<eos> Get your drunk ass back here now!<eos> Will you...
This was Wayne's show.<eos> He wanted somebody to slow you down so he could get away, and I volunteered.<eos> Anything to get away from that madman.<eos> I ain't trying to die out here.<eos> Now you won't.
But you haven't told anyone he has Christian.<eos> What?<eos> You're gonna tell him you two can work this out together.<eos> What if he doesn't believe me?<eos> He will.
I miss Leonard too.<eos> What's...?<eos> What is wrong with me?<eos> Why can't I ever have love?<eos> - You will.
Pseudorealism versus true realism.<eos> What's the difference?<eos> Honestly, I have no idea.<eos> You know, the film you're shooting won't survive a nuclear attack.<eos> Nothing will.

Abuse...<eos> The blue medicine.<eos> It's time for you to forget.<eos> No.<eos> No, I won't.
- Sweet.<eos> But in my excitement to be a have, I'd forgotten about the girls who were still have-nots, like Kiki Reynolds and Mia Brady and Kristy Patton.<eos> I knew what it was like to be bare-chested.<eos> Jenna Hamilton, will you be... [Laughs] Matty's girl?<eos> Yes, I will.
Please stop talking to Jake about Matty and me.<eos> Okay.<eos> Fine.<eos> Even if Jake wants to talk<eos> - about you or Matty, I won't.
Yeah, you did.<eos> No way!<eos> She'll know what I meant.<eos> Okay.<eos> - She will!
I know how important this is to you.<eos> I owe you.<eos> We all do.<eos> Yeah, well, as long as we get the real bomber...<eos> We will.
In which case, Barton, you've been bamboozled by our lying, arrogant employee worse than I've been.<eos> I leave the honors to you.<eos> You know what needs to be done.<eos> I will continue my study at this hospital... no matter what you say today, no matter what you do.<eos> You won't, Bill.
He's trying to reach out to me, but I don't know where he is, and I can't understand what he's trying to say.<eos> All I know is that he's scared, and he's lonely, and he's in a lot of pain.<eos> He's in a lot of pain.<eos> We have to find him.<eos> We will.
We're gonna save him, I promise.<eos> The DNA was a perfect match.<eos> You handled yourself well.<eos> What happens when I refuse to cooperate?<eos> You won't.
Mica is 10 years old.<eos> She can't.<eos> We'll keep them safe.<eos> You're gonna start over, find others, people who don't know, and you're gonna survive out here.<eos> You will.
I shouldn't have barged in on you like that.<eos> Thanks for not throwing me out on my ass.<eos> Do me a favor?<eos> Don't tell Kate.<eos> I won't.
Cloette is coming!<eos> -It was too big!<eos> -Take a big gulp of water.<eos> When David comes on Saturday, make beef stew.<eos> David will not.
It's like a blog.<eos> Oh, right.<eos> It's just an ironic gesture of how romance is outdated.<eos> I haven't really worked it out yet.<eos> Well, you will. You will.
We could do it together.<eos> No!<eos> You're safe, I promise.<eos> Please don't leave me!<eos> No, I won't.
- I want to know who leaked the story.<eos> The campaign's happy to announce the results of the latest New Hampshire Journal poll, which has Governor Romney in the lead with 37% of New Hampshire's likely Republican voters, well ahead of Rick Perry with 18%,<eos> Ron Paul with 14%, then Michele Bachmann and Herman Cain.<eos> You forgot about Huntsman, Gingrich, and Santorum.<eos> - And soon you will, too.
You guys have fun.<eos> - Totally.<eos> - We will.<eos> I'll take your money next month.<eos> Oh, no, you will not!
A little late.<eos> I believe I'm right on time, Michael.<eos> I thought we were gonna have a face-to-face.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> We will.
You're changing the venue.<eos> There's a car waiting at the corner of Collins and 7th.<eos> It leaves in two minutes.<eos> - What if I don't make it?<eos> - You will.
You can't.<eos> She can't even walk.<eos> That's the most idiotic thing I've ever heard.<eos> - But they'll come.<eos> - No, they won't!
Did Jerry video me having sex with that guy like he did the others?<eos> Yes.<eos> Are you gonna watch that video?<eos> No.<eos> No, I won't.
That's... a refreshing change.<eos> Down-to-earth.<eos> That's what I like.<eos> Well, look, why don't you come down sometime and we'll find you a slump-buster, all right?<eos> Yeah, maybe I will.
No, no, please. No.<eos> It's like I'm not really here.<eos> I can't even feel things with my hands properly.<eos> None of it makes sense, Andrew.<eos> Never will, will it?
I can buy out Vincent's for you tomorrow, maybe get you some curtains or-- Marcel... you know what I really want?<eos> I want to make them pay.<eos> I'm pleased you stayed.<eos> You'll keep your promise about your mother's spell book?<eos> I will.
Apartments are to be divided.<eos> The Jews are all exterminated and we'll be next.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I promise they won't come again.<eos> They won't.
It's not going to change.<eos> There's got to be a way.<eos> The girls have never lived this long before.<eos> I don't think I can take losing them again.<eos> We won't.
- Hmm... wise man.<eos> Let's begin.<eos> A blindfold?<eos> Please, I've came so far to see your petals in bloom.<eos> And you will, you will.
Pan trusts me. He'll let me in.<eos> And maybe, just maybe, I'll leave a way open for you.<eos> But you've only got one shot, so you better have a good plan.<eos> Thank you.<eos> We will.
I knew I'd never stopped loving you.<eos> And before I even had a chance to take a breath, I... I lost you once more, and all that pain that I had pushed down for all those years, it just came... rushing back, and I...<eos> I didn't know if I could go through it again.<eos> I love you.<eos> I probably always will.
This is Taco and I will be victorious on the battlefield.<eos> Hey, Taco. Hey, Andre, I have one question for you.<eos> Did you ever have to tell a friend that his dick was blown off and then you realize it wasn't your friend, it was you?<eos> You don't know what it means to lose.<eos> But you will.
Especially you, Mrs Stanley.<eos> No doubt he wants to finish the job.<eos> To kill me?<eos> Yes. Well, supposing he gets inside?<eos> He won't.
You kill people!<eos> I won't be alone.<eos> It can't happen!<eos> If the police take you...<eos> They won't.
-Thank you.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I'll try that.<eos> You'll have to find out where the damp's coming from as well.<eos> I will.
I don't know.<eos> I'm running out of ideas.<eos> I promised Severide that I'd find her, but...<eos> - What if I can't?<eos> - You will.
I'm not sure.<eos> If he is, he's running out of time, too.<eos> You sure you don't want to try kickboxing?<eos> It's more cathartic.<eos> Maybe I will.
- Oh, that's great.<eos> Hi.<eos> Hey, Lowen just arrived.<eos> And get home safe.<eos> Yeah, I will.
Max, I might be a virgin again.<eos> I love my new phone!<eos> It's so cool and red.<eos> It feels like anything could happen!<eos> But it probably won't.
You want to be recognized for your gift.<eos> And who is more recognizable than them?<eos> I was given this power for a reason.<eos> I just want people to see what I can do.<eos> They will.
Why don't you call her from here?<eos> We'll all go out to dinner.<eos> Fantastic. Tell your guy to wear his fanciest dress shorts.<eos> Okay. Tell Mary to bring aersolity.<eos> I will.

There was no job in Mexico.<eos> There was nothing.<eos> I'm nothing.<eos> I don't want to leave you.<eos> I won't.
Joel.<eos> He never shut you out.<eos> Listen, um, don't mention this to the others, okay?<eos> Everyone is so emotional about this house.<eos> No, I won't.
So I think you need to trust me now.<eos> Do you really think I'd put Luke in a dangerous situation?<eos> He's my favorite, which I did not just say.<eos> - If anything happens to him --<eos> - It won't.
- We land in half an hour.<eos> - Good.<eos> The sooner we begin, the better.<eos> Whatever this is, whatever you think you're doing, it won't work. I won't give you what you want.<eos> You will.
I really do.<eos> And I love y'all so much, but I don't like booing' too much.<eos> I think that's kinda rude.<eos> I've always thought of you as family.<eos> I always will.
Finally.<eos> - Still pretending to have fun?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Will, uh, will Poo be like this?<eos> - Will what?
Don't be afraid.<eos> Sister!<eos> Eko.<eos> Bill- promise me that... you'll protect all the children.<eos> Yes, I will.
It was an act of pure selflessness, and one I will always cherish.<eos> So what now?<eos> Does Conrad know?<eos> No.<eos> He never will.
Wait.<eos> What do you want from me?<eos> Do you see these people?<eos> They don't understand.<eos> Hopefully they never will.
Was I really in that place?<eos> You were there, I can attest to that.<eos> Hey! You didn't log out?<eos> Do you really want be be logged-out of life?<eos> Yeah, I won't.
You did tell your parents I was coming, right?<eos> Or that I exist?<eos> I thought we'd surprise them.<eos> But what if your mother hates me?<eos> She won't.
I don't want your pity,<eos> I want your company.<eos> Tomorrow night at the Three Crowns?<eos> Won't you come and drink with me?<eos> I bloody will.
The worm has teeth.<eos> What, you're here to pwotect your wuved ones?<eos> I'm not going to let you touch either one of them.<eos> Oh, and I'd like to see that.<eos> Oh, you will.
When I'm done you're gonna be back in a prison cell.<eos> Did you sanction a CIA black Ops team to torture Teo Braga with full knowledge that he was your husband's son?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Did your husband know that?<eos> - He will now.
The Bishop wants to meet your cook at pier four in the Defense District, in one of those old abandoned buildings.<eos> It makes sense.<eos> It's isolated, discreet.<eos> This whole thing only works if The Bishop turns up in person, you understand that?<eos> Yeah, he'll the.
There was an incident of a... particular nature.<eos> The nature of which I cannot recall the details of.<eos> Or you could get a reference from me.<eos> Oh, nice one!<eos> But you won't.

It was foretold...<eos> That your arrival would seal our fate.<eos> Seal your fate?<eos> I don't understand.<eos> You will.
Will it definitely come up?<eos> They're meeting for a big chat, JP.<eos> Ooh, big chat.<eos> No-one likes a big chat.<eos> Still, maybe it won't.
No-one likes a big chat.<eos> Still, maybe it won't.<eos> That for the first month I was going out with Josie, I was also going out with Heather as well?<eos> Well, maybe it won't, so long as they don't talk about any of the following - men, relationships, emotions, life, what either of them have been doing, or how they've been feeling.<eos> Yeah, so it probably will.
I must flee.<eos> If the guards catch me, they will kill me.<eos> Where will you go?<eos> How will I find you?<eos> You won't.
Okay, then shut up.<eos> You can have the Asians back, but I wanna negotiate my own terms.<eos> That is so cute.<eos> Now shut your silly little mouth, or you will never see Fred again.<eos> In fact, no one will.
Yeah, I did, too.<eos> But I just found out that it's not.<eos> I'm sorry, Jeremy.<eos> - Call me sometime?<eos> I will.
I tried to be a good mother to you.<eos> I wanted to be perfect, but this is a musician's life.<eos> We rehearse and we practice and we perform.<eos> Unfortunately, that's how it's going to be for you, too, you'll see.<eos> No, I won't.
Not talking to me is a very dangerous decision for you right now.<eos> Not here.<eos> I'll call you.<eos> - Look, if I don't hear from you soon...<eos> - You will.

Mom can make up your old room, and I can take some time off work.<eos> I don't mean to be disrespectful, 'cause we really appreciate that, but you just heard Paige's doctor say that she needs to go back to her normal routine.<eos> Her life with me is her normal routine.<eos> Yes, but that's a life she doesn't remember.<eos> She will.
Wait a minute, there's no such thing as a perfect man, right?<eos> What do you have to lose?<eos> Isn't that what you've been preaching to me all night?<eos> Okay.<eos> I will if you will.
Exactly, that's what I'm saying.<eos> Why even bring that up?<eos> You don't bring it up, you just let them in.<eos> Why mention it?<eos> No one will.
- That sounds like fun.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Pretty soon, you'll have a whole new group of friends, you know.<eos> You won't even think about this place anymore.<eos> Yes, I will.

It is a little indistinct. It was taken from the security camera before she went into that tunnel, but they hope that someone will recognise her from it.<eos> They'll kill me,<eos> They'll never know.<eos> They will,

How's Mother?<eos> Resting.<eos> It will take weeks for your letter to reach the queen and hear if she will<eos> - even accept your offer.<eos> - She will.

Figure it out.<eos> For once, I'd like you to handle one of these meetings while I lurk in the shadows.<eos> - You couldn't lurk if you tried. - Heh.<eos> That number we gave her better pan out.<eos> It will.

Okay.<eos> But by whom?<eos> Well, I am working that out, but in the meantime, have him walked across the street to the doctor, have his personal things sent to my office, and he'll be out of your hair for the rest of the day.<eos> Before we can deal with any of your concerns, we need to comply fully with the law.<eos> And we will.
I promise.<eos> I love you, mom.<eos> Coop. Mase, let's, uh, let your mom rest now.<eos> If you see Nana, say hi, okay?<eos> I will, baby.
You have your own cup?<eos> Yeah, when you come here a lot, they give you one.<eos> Want one?<eos> I don't come here a lot.<eos> You will.
Dangerous people.<eos> My mother died when I was a baby, and my father has been the only family I've ever known and they slit his throat.<eos> They are going to have to kill me if they want me to give this up.<eos> Well let's hope it doesn't come to that.<eos> And it won't.
Do what you gotta do.<eos> But we got bigger fish, okay?<eos> We trade him in, we get outta here.<eos> - Won't matter.<eos> - Yes, it will.
That sounds great.<eos> Can you hear my voice, Mr. Delaney?<eos> Oh, man, you should've just kept going.<eos> I know you want to die.<eos> And you will.
What is that?<eos> The culmination of my life's work...<eos> You and I have more in common than you realize, Edouard.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> You will...
The culmination of my life's work...<eos> You and I have more in common than you realize, Edouard.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> You will...<eos> You will.
From my garden.<eos> It seemed the least I could do.<eos> She would have appreciated it.<eos> I like to think so.<eos> I, however, will not.
Oh, that's...<eos> that's so good to hear.<eos> Thataboy. I just...<eos> I just want you to not worry about anything.<eos> I won't.
After that crime he committed.<eos> After he was convicted with all of those witnesses.<eos> Cheryl, you will either find a woman without family and friends and torture her or you won't.<eos> If you do, your daughter will be healed.<eos> If not, she won't.
Billy...<eos> He'll be my responsibility.<eos> Oh, thank you so much.<eos> You will not regret it.<eos> Yes, you will.
Thanks for making this happen so last minute.<eos> No worries. Nothing I like more than making dinner for six unexpected house guests.<eos> This is getting serious, Annie.<eos> - I really could lose this job.<eos> - But you won't.
Relax, I'm fine.<eos> Please, don't break up with me.<eos> Please don't, just don't.<eos> I'll do whatever you ask, honestly.<eos> I will...
Use your moped.<eos> I don't have time.<eos> Call me tonight.<eos> - Call me.<eos> - I will.
Now his soul will be in my arms, too.<eos> Can you see now why I fear death?<eos> You want to hand me over.<eos> There's no shame in that.<eos> But you won't.
Actually, give me like 15.<eos> I'm gonna stretch this leg out.<eos> I'll be right with you.<eos> No.<eos> You won't.
Now, y'all find Rusty's mother, like I promised him we would, and when I come back from Atlanta, we'll - - I'll --<eos> I'll only be working down the street a ways.<eos> We'll see each other all the time.<eos> I know it.<eos> We will.
No, trust me. I'm not your guy.<eos> Well, if you say so.<eos> But I am definitely going to the party, so I've gotta come up with a costume.<eos> I'll see you there?<eos> Yeah. Well, yes, you will.
- Too low.<eos> Do better.<eos> - No. No.<eos> We'll take it.<eos> - No, we won't.
Now is the knee too much?<eos> No, no, no, the knee totally makes it.<eos> All right.<eos> I can't imagine my life without you, so, Karen Ann Churley, will you marry me?<eos> Why, yes, I will.
No.<eos> No, Pete.<eos> You won't remember.<eos> But I will.<eos> I will.
The program represents thousands of euros.<eos> You know we won't release you.<eos> It's been 10 years since the last time you came.<eos> - I needed to go back to my roots, to catch my breath.<eos> - With us you won't.
We steer a little bit of his paycheck into a quiet little slush fund.<eos> He can do whatever he wants with it.<eos> And if he were using this slush fund to binge on his favorite bad habit, where do you suppose we might find him?<eos> I rented an apartment in Tribeca under the name of the dummy corp.<eos> Yes, I will!
He can do whatever he wants with it.<eos> And if he were using this slush fund to binge on his favorite bad habit, where do you suppose we might find him?<eos> I rented an apartment in Tribeca under the name of the dummy corp.<eos> Yes, I will!<eos> Of course I will!
And I'm sure she'll give Peter a glowing recommendation.<eos> Neal, this plan sounds incredibly intricate.<eos> It is.<eos> What happens if it doesn't work?<eos> It will.
It's public record.<eos> And?<eos> And...<eos> He said he wouldn't say anything, but...<eos> But he won't.
You have an idea the place of the operation?<eos> I heard we were going blow themselves purpose I do not know not exactly where.<eos> I think it's a bar.<eos> On after you, there will be that Jews and Christians?<eos> In my opinion, there will also Muslims.
If she dies during the operation, which is very possible, I want her family to know the most experienced surgeon was operating.<eos> Do you understand?<eos> Of course.<eos> I know, you hate me for refusing.<eos> But one day you won't.
The upside... I've done time before.<eos> - But that was before Dylan.<eos> - You'll make bail.<eos> No.<eos> I won't.
Even the King is starting to be suspicious of him, so...<eos> I will go and bring him back immediately.<eos> If by chance... although the General would never do such a thing... the General cannot step even one foot outside with the Prince, otherwise, everything is over for him.<eos> Tell him those words clearly.<eos> I definitely will.
Why kill Gus?<eos> He had nothing to do with keeping that old guy locked up.<eos> I get the feeling that killing ain't too much of a stretch for this bunch.<eos> What if no help comes?<eos> It will.
Because I have just as much incentive to figure out who set that fire as you do.<eos> Someone clearly wants to frame me, someone who has waited a long time for me to get out, but would prefer that I stay caged up in that cell.<eos> And you might know who that someone is?<eos> I'm offering my services.<eos> As a... arson investigator... if you will.
Actually, Hank, I think I'm gonna have my associate cover for me next week too, and not rush back so fast.<eos> Yeah, um...<eos> Well, have fun up there.<eos> And... and tell your family... I'm really sorry I missed out.<eos> I will.
Oh, hey, Desean.<eos> You draft me, I'm talking about two touchdowns a game.<eos> Oh, I want all your TDS.<eos> And don't forget about the punt returns.<eos> Oh, I won't. Oh, shit!
Come see my room, grandma.<eos> It's upstairs.<eos> Upstairs?<eos> Then you better stay close, 'cause I might get lost.<eos> I will.
I admit...<eos> I made a lot of mistakes in my life, but I was a drunk.<eos> What's your excuse?<eos> Have a good semester.<eos> I will.
There.<eos> Will that convince you?<eos> Convince me again.<eos> And don't say, 'If we ever have any.'<eos> Because we will.
Of course.<eos> I'm worried about Mary bumping through the glen.<eos> She doesn't have to come.<eos> No, I know.<eos> But she will.
Lot of paperwork.<eos> I hate paperwork.<eos> So what do we do?<eos> Shoot 'em.<eos> If you won't, I will.
Don't know that. We can't control his movements, Joan.<eos> Well, did you tell him he could see David again?<eos> (Water splashes) No, but I didn't rule it out, either.<eos> Roland... I told him it'd be one step at a time.<eos> No, it won't.
Really?<eos> 'Cause it didn't look like nothing.<eos> We'll talk about it tonight, okay?<eos> Yes, please.<eos> We will. Okay.
That's not so reassuring.<eos> You came to me.<eos> I didn't come to you.<eos> I'll see you on the first tee.<eos> No, you won't.
- A story for every day of the year, most of them not fit to be repeated.<eos> None of them even close to the truth.<eos> Why don't you put them right?<eos> Because the story can change all it likes.<eos> This never will.
What's your name?<eos> Am I required to tell you?<eos> Well, I'm just a consultant.<eos> You don't have to tell me anything.<eos> Then I won't.
You've got to accept that.<eos> She said honey bunny and sweety.<eos> Stop it now.<eos> She'll come back.<eos> -No, she won't.
That is completely paranoid.<eos> I know.<eos> Don't let anyone in.<eos> I'm not waiting up for you.<eos> Sure, you will.
You got me here.<eos> That's more than you ever had to do.<eos> Hey, you're talking in the past tense.<eos> - Whatever happens or doesn't...<eos> - It will!
Guys, quick announcement.<eos> I'm gonna be popping these crow's eggs in the fridge here so they don't spoil.<eos> Do not touch them.<eos> They are ours.<eos> We won't.
Just--I need another second, please.<eos> I need to remember every little thing about how perfect my life is right now at this exact moment.<eos> Are you good?<eos> - Yeah. - Okay.<eos> Leslie Knope, - will you-- - Yes!
And he mourned his death for years.<eos> He gave up.<eos> It was the most depressing thing I'd ever seen, and...<eos> I don't want that to happen to me.<eos> - It won't.
Ah... [Sighs]<eos> You know, Oliver, I'm no expert at this, but...<eos> I don't think love is about changing or saving a person.<eos> I think it's about finding the person who's already the right fit.<eos> One day you will.
Oh, delightful.<eos> Well, my weekly fee is-<eos> There, there.<eos> I'm sure you'll find someone you like just as much.<eos> - No, we won't.
Um... for a long time, he... he wanted to get revenge on the bastard who ran her over, but I told him,<eos> "Hank, our Missy came home to us with a few broken bones.<eos> We get to live with our daughter.<eos> The monster who left her there has to live with himself."<eos> No. I won't.
Ed:<eos> - Okay, Soph, I gotta go.<eos> Sophie: Eddie, please, be careful.<eos> Ed:<eos> I will, okay?
I put everything together in a folder.<eos> It's on the dresser.<eos> Just look at it.<eos> I will.<eos> We will.
Over here.<eos> The water's pretty murky.<eos> Haven't seen anything yet.<eos> They still haven't found the body.<eos> They won't.
The police have offered to give you an update whenever you want, but not until it suits you, of course.<eos> - Would you handle the practicalities?<eos> - Certainly.<eos> Prepare the priest and tell him, that it will be as Maja wants.<eos> Yes, I will.
[Chuckles] No.<eos> A basketball team.<eos> Sports?<eos> Party on, you two.<eos> We will.
Somewhere out west.<eos> Like the UP or something.<eos> You know what, Beth?<eos> - When we catch this guy--<eos> - You won't.
I was a stupid child when I said those things.<eos> Life with you could never be boring.<eos> Blair Cornelia Waldorf, will you marry me?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, I will.
Çağatay and Genghis Khan's sons probably gave him strange looks. Because this tactic, worked in steppes and deserts with a few cavalrymen. Not in woods or battlefields against knights.<eos> I understand, sir.<eos> You don't.<eos> You don't understand yet.<eos> But you will some day.
I've crossed through too many worlds to be brought short at the brink of success.<eos> Who was it who bested you?<eos> The swan girl. Emma.<eos> Rest assured, it won't happen again.<eos> No, it won't.
Yeah, I'll see you there.<eos> We've all been there.<eos> It usually happens first few months after being on the job.<eos> Right now you have nothing to compare it to.<eos> But you will.
No print hits from the letter.<eos> So we start with Manor Hill, get a list of Lassiter's students.<eos> Think somebody up at that school wants to talk about abuse?<eos> Have a nice drive.<eos> We will.
Please.<eos> Protect yourself.<eos> Take it.<eos> You know what to do.<eos> No, I won't.
In the midst of the Lake of Avalon there is an ancient isle.<eos> That is the source of their power.<eos> You must take him there.<eos> He won't allow that.<eos> He will.
You did!<eos> The kid's right.<eos> The money's coming out of your pocket.<eos> Sorry, slick, but we don't have that kind of dough.<eos> Oh, you will.
Then quick, let's just head on and turn on back to Helium.<eos> What do you take me for?<eos> I take you for a man who's lost.<eos> I won't be lost if you just tell me how to work this thing!<eos> I will!
It's not the right time.<eos> You know what?<eos> Daphnee thinks the penicillin was you.<eos> - What?<eos> - And after this, she will for the 1st attempt too.
I suppose that's possible.<eos> She was a sweet kid, Helen.<eos> And they killed her because of me.<eos> They want me to run.<eos> But I won't.
They were already dead.<eos> The important thing to remember is that you saved countless others.<eos> One of them is still alive.<eos> -Find him.<eos> -We will.
Dad had a mind of his own, you know.<eos> You just didn't fucking help matters.<eos> Will you come for a drink with me?<eos> - No.<eos> - Yes, you fucking will.
You're never gonna get another job after this catastrophic season you're about to set us all up for.<eos> You'll have to explain to your kid why you're working at Dick's Sporting Goods.<eos> I'm not gonna fire you, Grady.<eos> - Fuck you, Billy.<eos> - Now I will.
That's rubbish!<eos> THE THIRD DAY<eos> Coat!<eos> She's not eating!<eos> She will.
I'm sorry I didn't know. Should've brought some blue balloons.<eos> It's just a guess.<eos> When I picture him, I see a boy.<eos> We'll see.<eos> You won't.
Errors. In fact these five gifts do not exist.<eos> I said, after confirmation.<eos> Awesome, but I kind of foreboding!<eos> If there are five individuals They must here.<eos> Yes, they will.
Oh you're welcome honey and I hope you enjoy it.<eos> Hey if that pink slip shows up while you're packing, will you mail it to me?<eos> Oh, sure will Honey, sure will!<eos> And you have a safe trip back to LA!<eos> I will. - O.K
I know.<eos> He's just mad that his friends don't visit him here.<eos> He thought they would all visit.<eos> But nobody came.<eos> Well, they will.
Don't do that.<eos> Don't just disappear like that on me.<eos> - You told me to.<eos> - You shouldn't listen to me.<eos> Fine, I won't.
- You don't have to be so rude.<eos> - Fuck rude!<eos> People are dead.<eos> I wanna get out of this village, out of this fucking country.<eos> And we will.
- I must find them.<eos> - The two ladies are gone.<eos> I can see that, but I want to find them.<eos> - Not a chance.<eos> - Ah, but I will!
So just go.<eos> I just want to make sure my family is safe.<eos> Why wouldn't anyone be safe?<eos> Unless you call the police, everything will be fine.<eos> I won't.
It means, get the fuck out.<eos> We have been facing a challenging and complex new set of threats for this region.<eos> Iran's ballistic missiles prove to be a significant risk to this area.<eos> interceptors... ..will...<eos> Will what?
Go on, pull the trigger. Kill me and you kill Fiennes.<eos> They won't stop till they get him.<eos> I stopped you, I'll stop them.<eos> I didn't want to kill him.<eos> They will.
And Pooh supervised.<eos> And now to disguise the pit.<eos> Catch, Piglet.<eos> Gosh, Pooh, I hope this idea works.<eos> Oh, it will, Piglet.
Lord Eddard Stark is my father.<eos> And Lady Stark is not your mother, making you... the bastard.<eos> Let me give you some advice, bastard.<eos> Never forget what you are.<eos> The rest of the world will not.
You remember the importance of routines?<eos> - Yeah. He sleeps here.<eos> As the court has determined, he doesn't know where you live.<eos> If you want a phone...<eos> - I will not.
- You ask just about fours.<eos> No, go jump in the ocean.<eos> - Do you have any sevens?<eos> Yes, I have.<eos> No, I will not!
It must be absolutely awful.<eos> It is quite possible we can look for each other after this?<eos> You need someone who can take care of you.<eos> Would you do it?<eos> - Of course I will.
Nathan.<eos> I'm your father, but I'll never be your dad.<eos> I lost that chance a long time ago.<eos> I don't know if you can understand my reasons.<eos> Maybe someday you will.
Don't you tell me what my son feels.<eos> He's coming with me, and there isn't anything you can do.<eos> Then you can't have that commission.<eos> Oh, well, we'll see about that!<eos> Yeah, we will.
And so now it's kill or be killed.<eos> You get that, Denis?<eos> Whatever, I warned you.<eos> Do whatever you want to do.<eos> I will.
Weird.<eos> So can one of you take me to the library?<eos> I feel like reading about Peru.<eos> No. Brick, sorry, can't.<eos> Actually, won't.
He still believes in Santa Claus.<eos> You shouldn't have to go through all this with Tara or... whoever that is.<eos> I'll figure it out, ma.<eos> It's no big deal.<eos> No, you won't.
At least it's not mine.<eos> No, it's not mine, either.<eos> Someone is trying to frame us.<eos> I don't know anything about it.<eos> Well, we will soon.
You know...<eos> Today was something... I never could have imagined.<eos> But if the impossible is possible...<eos> Who's to say that someday I won't see him again?<eos> Maybe you will.
Wow, move all the way to Indianapolis, so I can pick up your vitamins and supplements.<eos> Everybody starts somewhere.<eos> You'll travel, and you will meet interesting people.<eos> Think about it.<eos> Okay. I will.
An apology.<eos> A what?<eos> I'm sorry for the part That I played in your death.<eos> I was protecting elena.<eos> I will always
Unless you see him attempting to participate in this investigation, in which case you have my permission to shoot him.<eos> Rachel, the, uh, the guest room is just at the top of the stairs.<eos> Thank you, but I'm not here to sleep.<eos> I need to take a look around.<eos> Well, I'll...
Look, there's too many guards.<eos> We can't outrun 'em.<eos> - I'm gonna have to buy you some time.<eos> - How will you get out of here?<eos> I probably won't.
I messed up, and I'm taking my punishment like a big girl.<eos> It's okay, Uncle jarek.<eos> No, it's not okay, okay?<eos> I'm not gonna lose you to some boneheaded mistake.<eos> You won't.
- l worry for Frank. I care about him.<eos> - Well, I'd stop.<eos> No.<eos> I love Frank.<eos> I always will.
Well, only one of you can come in.<eos> Um, Mom.<eos> Mom, go ahead, please.<eos> Just make sure she knows we're all out here, okay?<eos> I will.
Don't you get tired of moving around all the time?<eos> It's how my job works.<eos> I come in here for a period of time, so you don't have twnenty subs in and I'm outa here, and then, you have a permanent teacher come in and I leave.<eos> Attention to all teachers, this is an special announcement from the Principle's Office.<eos> There will an all faculty meeting today, during nutrition"
I ain't goin' away with you.<eos> I can't.<eos> Daddy?<eos> You mean you won't.<eos> Right. I won't.
PARSONS: Thanks.<eos> I... I should run. I'm sorry.<eos> HEWES: I'll take care of this. Don't worry.<eos> So you'll think about the playdate?<eos> PARSONS: I will.
The crew rigged the interior with explosives to prevent enemy access.<eos> I need someone who can open it without setting the charges off.<eos> Luckily, I already know the best. That's why you're here, Neal.<eos> And if I refuse?<eos> You won't.
Together, the two of you will be able to eliminate the Count.<eos> But you must act now.<eos> We cannot keep your new assassin a secret forever.<eos> I will have my revenge.<eos> You will, sister.
But you must act now.<eos> We cannot keep your new assassin a secret forever.<eos> I will have my revenge.<eos> You will, sister.<eos> You will.
But so young.<eos> Where is your master?<eos> He will come for me.<eos> And if he does not?<eos> He will!
- He wants to meet a girl.<eos> - We'll get you that, too. - That'd be nice.<eos> - No, I meant Dale.<eos> All we have to do is find him a girl before Omega chi does and he'll drop out.<eos> - A little divine intervention, if you will. - I will.
For the past 18 months, we at the CIA have been training a brigade of anti-Castro guerillas in Guatemala.<eos> Yes, I'm aware of that.<eos> Then I'm sure you're also aware that President Eisenhower approved this training and its ultimate purpose-- the--the elimination of Fidel Castro.<eos> Well, I'm certainly for his, uh, elimination. I just question whether or not this will, uh, work.<eos> I think-- Yes, it will, Mr. President.
Feels like I've been away too long already.<eos> He's just trying to steady the boat.<eos> And we don't need you jumping all over it.<eos> We'll have to see what Glickman says about that.<eos> Yeah, we will.
But you also lost a killer. He got away!<eos> And no-one even knows what he looks like!<eos> We'll find him.<eos> How?<eos> We will.
Yes, I do.<eos> But right now you owe me one million and in four days' time, if we stick to the plan, you'll owe me four million with no means to pay.<eos> But in three months you'll have turned over 10 million and all our debts will be cleared.<eos> Only if your plan works out.<eos> It will.
I love her.<eos> You need to call her. Yeah.<eos> Okay.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I definitely will.
You keep saying that.<eos> What Eli is neglecting to mention is that a jump like this is going to require every last ounce of power we have, and if his calculations are off--<eos> They're not.<eos> And we fall short even by a fraction, a tenth of one percent--<eos> We won't.
Yeah, look, I've written down most of what I intend to say.<eos> If you've got anything you might want to add...<eos> So, I'll speak when you're done.<eos> But just so we're clear, if we don't get the 10 volunteers...<eos> We will.
- It's your fault, isn't it, sweets?<eos> 'Cause you told House it was the last Tardis.<eos> House can't feed on them if there's none more coming, can he?<eos> So now he's off to your universe to find more Tardises.<eos> - It won't.
The truth us, son..<eos> ..today he has said..<eos> .. what I wanted to.<eos> But.. I couldn't muster the courage.<eos> Son, will you..
Yes. But without the Pope's permission? I will be walking towards my death.<eos> Or towards your life.<eos> This could be the sign from God for which you have been waiting.<eos> I want Giovanni to want me tonight.<eos> He will, Lucrezia.
- Say what?<eos> - Oh, just get it out.<eos> No, it's just...<eos> I don't know how you do it.<eos> Well, you will, one day.
It's changed a lot since the version that I started with.<eos> It's not right.<eos> You should be at the lunch.<eos> - Harcourt should know you. - He will.<eos> He will.
Unpleasant childhood.<eos> Maybe some...<eos> some daddy issues.<eos> Other than that, I can't figure you out, Philly.<eos> You never will.
This friend happens to have a daughter who just turned 18 last month.<eos> Is she your girlfriend?<eos> - No.<eos> I've never even met her.<eos> But I will, in a couple of days.
Argh, not... not there!<eos> Do you want to go on top?<eos> Quickly.<eos> I'm trying.<eos> It won't...
All right, break the light bulb and attach the filament to the battery of your cellphone.<eos> The filament conducts the charge...<eos> Which creates a surge, shorts the power, and the locking mechanism should release.<eos> "Should"?<eos> It will.
There he is...<eos> Escape artist extraordinaire, Peter Burke.<eos> What happened with Keller?<eos> He hasn't shown.<eos> He won't.
Promise me one thing.<eos> You'll give me five minutes alone with this guy.<eos> I'll do the same thing to him he did to her.<eos> That's what he deserves, not jail, and he has to pay for what he did to my mother.<eos> He will.
That's one messed-up love letter.<eos> We need to talk.<eos> Alone.<eos> You owe me at least that.<eos> We will.
You really don't want to draw attention to yourself in this place.<eos> C'mon--<eos> Help us prepare to the feast.<eos> Bo, I don't know where I am.<eos> So how will you?
What's up?<eos> Thomas, I'm your boss, but I'm also your friend.<eos> So, Thomas, I'll tell you something and in the name of our friendship,<eos> I'll ask you not to answer.<eos> OK, in the name of our friendship, I won't.
Do you realize the shit you got us into?<eos> Wait, it's not my fault. I didn't ask to escape.<eos> Then, let's see how Jo reacts.<eos> I can hear the rip saw.<eos> You won't.
That's not how I want this to end.<eos> All I ever wanted was to make you happy. That's it.<eos> And I'm so sorry that I couldn't do that.<eos> But I still love you, 'nessa.<eos> And I always will.
Fair enough, but do you get the respect you deserve from Franklin and Bash for being a grinder?<eos> Pindar, tell the truth.<eos> Yes, he does.<eos> All right, well, let us know if you change your mind and you'd like to join our team.<eos> I will.
Well, when she does, you got a good story.<eos> You were abducted.<eos> That'll score you points.<eos> - Yeah, if she calls.<eos> - She will, Nicky D.
It's just like before, when Dad brought both of us here but put us on different planes back to the mainland.<eos> I haven't talked to you in ten years, and I never saw Dad again.<eos> Hey.<eos> We're gonna see each other again, okay?<eos> Hey, we will.
Once we use the portal to bring our people here, then we will own it all.<eos> - Are you ready?<eos> You understand the size of the array we're building, the amount of fuel we're going to need?<eos> - This operation needs to work.<eos> - It will.
- I'm not.<eos> - Or that you really want to be with me,<eos> - I don't.<eos> - I thought, should you ever want to get back with me,<eos> - I won't.
No! You're not going anywhere!<eos> Besides, there are snakes here.<eos> Necla, I'm at the end of my rope.<eos> Get in the car!<eos> No, I won't!
They are fighting for democracy they want it to take the lead.<eos> It shall not proceed further?<eos> That's it.<eos> Well, okay.<eos> Tomorrow, Aung San Suu Kyi will to Shwedagon.
Okay.<eos> I'll do it if you cover my share for the band for Ben thing.<eos> I don't know.<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, I will, okay?
What's going on?<eos> She's very symmetrical.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Don't blow it.<eos> No, no, Officer, I won't.
There's your proof of life.<eos> Now get the money or we'll send you proof of death.<eos> Please, she's our little girl.<eos> You have to find her.<eos> I will.
Now get the money or we'll send you proof of death.<eos> Please, she's our little girl.<eos> You have to find her.<eos> I will.<eos> I will.
Well, you should feel bad. You're cheating on my mother.<eos> - What? I never cheated on you. Mm-hm.<eos> Then why are you here with your tail between your legs?<eos> I came to tell you I don't have a high school diploma.<eos> And now, thanks to Lumpy, the study partner, I never will.
There's a lot around here.<eos> They're paying you overtime, right, doctor?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I expect so.<eos> They will.
and there won't be little sisters to ream or Golden Lilies to get crazy over.<eos> Guess I'll do a shot for you if we win the Lily.<eos> I know we'll...<eos> - I know you'll win it.<eos> - Oh, we totally will.
She has his nose, his black hair.<eos> Aye.<eos> Tell him when you see him, My Lord.<eos> If it please you, tell him how beautiful she is.<eos> I will.
- They're the best. - Okay, everybody, stop.<eos> No matter how hard we work at it...<eos> She's not ready.<eos> No, she can't leave. She's-she's been watched by doctors 24 hours a day.<eos> She still will.
- Okay. You can let go of my hand now. All right.<eos> Don't trip. Don't trip. Don't...<eos> You're not gonna trip.<eos> You're right.<eos> I won't.
A treat for doing well in school.<eos> I did promise.<eos> I don't fancy this any more.<eos> Think I might have some cereal instead.<eos> Well, if you won't!
And I want you to come with me.<eos> I know that's a lot to ask of a boyfriend.<eos> And I was thinking,{\* you know,} maybe, since given our last conversation,<eos> and that we're both ready...<eos> Michael Scott, will you...
Benedictine,or Franciscan?<eos> He belongs to a mendicant order,Your Eminence.<eos> Well,where is his begging bowl,then?<eos> He has yet to find one.<eos> But he will.
And you want to feed these rumours?<eos> What is all of Rome talking about now?<eos> - I will not have him in her house!<eos> - You will-<eos> You will not?
And, if I may say so, dangerous.<eos> Stop that.<eos> You have done penance enough.<eos> Who then will forgive us, Your Holiness?<eos> God will.
- Hugh?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> We're both here.<eos> Where are we? My eyes haven't adjusted.<eos> They won't.
And I'm guessing you're about to tell us we need to find something like an E.E.G. to prove...<eos> Nope, 'cause I already got one.<eos> You want me to sing?<eos> How's singing My Bonnie gonna help you see inside my brain?<eos> It won't.
Well, there's probably no point to it, Harry.<eos> He'll just be sedated.<eos> Hey, man, get at me soon.<eos> I got nothing so far on which gang we're dealing with, but I will.<eos> I will.
No thanks to you, Queen Audrey.<eos> Would you just...? Yeah.<eos> Okay, let's set up a defensive perimeter.<eos> Right after I set up the grill.<eos> Will you just...?
- What's this?<eos> - Our new business plan.<eos> We start with six pumps instead of eight.<eos> We can always add more later if we've got the tank capacity,<eos> - which we will, okay?
You will know.<eos> How?<eos> Only you know that.<eos> No,I don't.<eos> You will.
I saw myself in the future...<eos> After I had gotten my revenge, And that person scared the hell out of me.<eos> I realized what you said was right.<eos> I have a chance to get out before it's too late, And I have to take it.<eos> - You will.
That division could negotiate his release?<eos> Didn't think so.<eos> Now, be a good boy and do as you're told.<eos> - You're gonna regret this.<eos> - One of us will.
Let out of jail.<eos> You did this to me!<eos> The bite is a gift.<eos> I don't want it.<eos> You will.
That you can see better... Hear more clearly, move faster than any human could ever hope?<eos> You've been given something that most people would kill for.<eos> The bite is a gift.<eos> I don't want it.<eos> You will.
Maybe you should write to them after all.<eos> You've nothing to lose. No.<eos> They have to see him.<eos> They must see Charlie.<eos> Well, maybe they will...
Perotto and I long to be married.<eos> As much as we hope to please you, Lucrezia that is not possible.<eos> Tomorrow you will leave for Spain to become a nun, as you so devoutly wished.<eos> And you will care for your brother's orphaned children.<eos> I will not.
I know I can't wrap my head around anything right now.<eos> Are you sure this is the best time to be thinking about this?<eos> Well, when should I?<eos> No, I'd just hate to see you do anything you'll regret.<eos> I won't.
Obviously, I did that.<eos> Now if you will excusez-moi...<eos> Ah, Monsieur Archer.<eos> If you will please to follow me to le suite royale where I took a liberty to have a woman waiting in your Jacuzzi.<eos> Yes, I will.
I mean, come on, I'm here for you.<eos> I couldn't get on the plane fast enough.<eos> I don't know how I'm gonna deal with this.<eos> You will deal with this.<eos> Of course you will.
My dad's were the best.<eos> What the fuck?<eos> What are you doing?<eos> I wanted to do this the other night, but the shooting sort of messed everything up.<eos> Debra Morgan, will you--?
- God, this is so cold!<eos> - It freezes your mouth!<eos> And your tongue, and your lips.<eos> - Will you come to the seaside with me?<eos> - Yes, I will.
Whom you delivered her to, who was in charge with her.<eos> It's your only chance.<eos> Tell me everything!<eos> I want to talk to my lawyer!<eos> You will.
Oh, my God, it's late!<eos> I have to go.<eos> Off I go and I'll be back.<eos> Don't come back!<eos> I will!
Um, see, the thing is, a friend really screwed me over and...<eos> And I was supposed to take my senior year off and motorcycle through South America, but some skinny Beverly Hills brat told my parents I was growing pot, so, uh...<eos> I'm going to need the place more than you.<eos> So I guess we're just going to have to see who gets it.<eos> Hmm, yeah, we will.
- You see that pelican? - Yeah.<eos> You're running, right?<eos> You have a switchblade taped to your shoe.<eos> He does?<eos> He will.
I can help you.<eos> All right? I can talk to the D.A. I can tell him it was an accident.<eos> You didn't mean to hurt those people.<eos> - It won't make a difference.<eos> It will, Ben.
It's- it's not mine.<eos> It's Ian's.<eos> I need it for the insurance claim on my ring.<eos> it still hasn't turned up?<eos> It will.
I know you feel responsible for her death, but it wasn't your fault.<eos> I still think about her every day, Charlie.<eos> My daughter loved you very much.<eos> Never forget that.<eos> - I won't. - Goodbye John.
Okay, I know that killing an embezzler or even an actor should never have been plan "A," but I never would have done any of this if it weren't for the fact that I am absolutely, totally dead broke.<eos> What?<eos> ! And the money you were paying to have Mr. Hirschbaum served?<eos> I don't have it. I never did.<eos> A-and now I -- I never will.
She's happy, so I'm pleased.<eos> She's a good mate.<eos> Been mates since uni.<eos> That'll change.<eos> Will it?
Did you know that?<eos> And now, because of you people, they think I'm the one who did it.<eos> You know what...<eos> Don't come here again.<eos> I won't.
Castle, it's my second day back.<eos> That's all.<eos> It's no big deal.<eos> And if it happens again?<eos> It won't.
They stink!<eos> Stay in class and we can dance together.<eos> We'll make each other look good.<eos> Really?<eos> Okay. I will.
Of course there is.<eos> No tears, babe.<eos> You said we'd get the money, Bruno.<eos> You said this would work.<eos> It will,
Yes?<eos> I miss you.<eos> I miss you, too.<eos> Take care. And kiss dad for me.<eos> - I will. - Bye bye.
None of our boys wanted a fight. They just wanted to yell slogans!<eos> They'd have got the shit beaten out of them. But there'd have been no corpses!<eos> Only Daddy had to fucking give things a shove...<eos> - Stop it!<eos> - No, I won't!
Why?<eos> She told Cassie she was going to the lake house.<eos> The kids are headed up there to check on her.<eos> When we made Henry's death look like a heart attack, the idea was that the neighbor would find him, not Faye.<eos> She won't.
So I... I still believe that we can have a whole lot more.<eos> So this means we're trying it again?<eos> Would you be my girlfriend all over again?<eos> No, I'm playing.<eos> Yes, I will.
Speaking of which, how soon will this video get out to the media?<eos> I'd say a year and a half-ish.<eos> A year and a half?<eos> But you said people would see me.<eos> Oh, people will.
Ross-<eos> I need to know where he's vulnerable.<eos> I'm fucking done with him-- Impeachment hearings.<eos> Did you find her yet, the nurse?<eos> - Not yet. We will though.
I'm out.<eos> Ever get volunteered for a job you don't want?<eos> So, as you can see from your board there, this kill list is weirdly similar to high school.<eos> Group one is like the popular kids-- prom court, football team, Dean's list.<eos> The Heathers, if you will.
No, he wants to get to York.<eos> We'll meet him there the following day.<eos> My dear.<eos> I hope you can be strong if it goes against him.<eos> It won't.
No.<eos> That's it.<eos> You're free.<eos> - I hope I never see you again.<eos> - Oh, you will.
Now it's our turn.<eos> Who will cover us?<eos> Don't be a simpleton, Merlin.<eos> They haven't found the cargo.<eos> They will.
Why?<eos> Maybe we'd be dead, then, too.<eos> Nobody could protect him from Little T.<eos> We're gonna get him, okay?<eos> We will.
Yeah, I know you'll be a great cop.<eos> So, promise... You'll do it, too, sis.<eos> What?<eos> So, don't give up, sis.<eos> I won't, either.
Not being able to see is nothing.<eos> Daughter!<eos> Cheer up!<eos> So, don't give up, sis.<eos> I won't, either.
The booze?<eos> Well, a little bit of that, you know.<eos> Mostly the scandals, the cover-ups, the dogma.<eos> Missed the pussy, didn't you?<eos> And you will, too, after three years of marriage.
It's all circumstantial.<eos> She's right.<eos> Anyone could've put that bulb in there.<eos> We have no proof.<eos> But we will.
I didn't mean to be presumptuous about what you were feeling.<eos> Don't worry about that, Lindsay.<eos> The trust is, if I were really honest with myself, I do feel a little responsible, so hearing you say that to me, I just lost my cool for a second.<eos> We are gonna get this guy, Jo.<eos> We will.
Unless you want to see that school teacher dead.<eos> His man's got Miss Catherine, Dan.<eos> He'll kill her if we don't give him the bank's money.<eos> Did you tell him that we don't have it?<eos> But we will by the end of tomorrow.
You keep your scrawny ass right where it is.<eos> You know, that`s not my wife.<eos> I don`t care if y`all married or not.<eos> Actually that wouldn`t be a bad idea.<eos> Will you? Okay.
Wow!<eos> What a great gift.<eos> What if he never comes back?<eos> What am I saying?<eos> Of course he will.
I know that anger you're feeling right now--<eos> What it's like to lose someone you love.<eos> Help us find the men who did this to your husband.<eos> It doesn't matter if you find them.<eos> Elias will.
If she's really sitting on Bruno's murderer, she's gonna be surrounded by Feds.<eos> You think they're gonna let John Bianchi walk in that door?<eos> Fine. Do it.<eos> But if I don't have a name by the end of the day...<eos> You will.
They're selling the house.<eos> No matter.<eos> I've told you.<eos> No one can own this house.<eos> No one ever will.
You make all of my days better and I don't ever want to spend another one without you.<eos> Lily...<eos> Tonight, back where I first set eyes on you, in front of all of our... friends, will you please...<eos> say that you'll marry me?<eos> Yes, I will.
It actually, uh, it nearly fell down the drain while I was washing up.<eos> Honey, we have a reservation.<eos> Yes.<eos> We'll figure it out tomorrow.<eos> Yep, we will.
Oh, my God, Mandy, you can't send these photos in.<eos> Girls!<eos> What's all the yelling about?<eos> Kristin doesn't like my photos.<eos> Yeah, well, you won't either.
Does Langley know about this plan?<eos> You mean Joan.<eos> Joan appreciates resourcefulness.<eos> All that matters is whether or not the job gets done.<eos> And it will.
Dr. Whitmere warned me it's only temporary.<eos> It's gonna be a long road back.<eos> I'll probably screw it up.<eos> No.<eos> No, you won't.
But she's our lead singer, mate.<eos> I'm sorry, but recent research has shown that the umbilical cord is also a vocal cord.<eos> Now can you tell me who the father is?<eos> Mmm...<eos> We will not.
Seven?<eos> A lot of them don't live till they're eighteen, do they?<eos> That IS the tragedy.<eos> Mm. So she might not last till she's, I don't know, twelve?<eos> Well, with your help, she will.
-You said so yourself.<eos> I said you were not hardly Alice, but you're much more her now.<eos> In fact, you're almost Alice.<eos> Even so, I couldn't slay the Jabberwocky if my life depended on it.<eos> It will.
- What do you mean?<eos> - I can't help her.<eos> - Yes, you can.<eos> Do it or I'll kill you! - I can't.<eos> I won't!
It's not safe<eos> I couldn't agree with you more sir.<eos> Did I leave my keys in the truck?<eos> I am not telepathic Spencer<eos> Maybe I'll just...
I mean, she needed a little love.<eos> How does she run?<eos> Well, when I'm done, better than ever.<eos> Well, man, I'd like to see that.<eos> You will.
I don't mean to be rude, but, uh, I... I have to get going.<eos> Well, where are you headed?<eos> Just got to tell my wife that we've lost everything.<eos> But that's not what our broker statement says.<eos> No, but the next one will.
It's cold.. - No!<eos> - It's quite cold.<eos> So what do you say?<eos> He won't come.<eos> He will.
He will.<eos> I know Donsai very well he won't come.<eos> I believe in love he will come.<eos> - He won't.<eos> - He will.
- He won't.<eos> - He will.<eos> actually, I want him to come So that I can break his head.<eos> But he won't come.<eos> He will how about a bet?
- Hold on, hold on.<eos> Hold on. Hey!<eos> - I don't get it.<eos> - I know you don't, Nick.<eos> And you probably never will.
- But think of the billions that you're gonna saved.<eos> I can guaranteed you that goddamn Jena tribe casino will never opens.<eos> And before you know it, the Jena tribe gonna be back selling moccasins.<eos> You know, Mr. Abramoff, we can't afford to lose this one.<eos> You won't.
In all my life, I never thought I'd see you down on one knee.<eos> Yeah, it's getting a bit damp down here, so...<eos> What's it to be, Anna from Boston?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, I will.
He should already know that.<eos> I do, doubter.<eos> Go on.<eos> Da said your spines can guide us.<eos> And they will.
So I'll tell Lucy it's on.<eos> That's my uncle.<eos> Don't mention it. Hey.<eos> That it's... you know.<eos> - I won't. I won't. -
Byzantine, Mediterranean. Whatever you need it to be.<eos> Hello, my peeps.<eos> The Fosters, I love them.<eos> - Dad, come play Legos with me.<eos> - Yes, yes, I will.
No plates.<eos> You got a candidate?<eos> I got a nominee.<eos> He'll have an alibi.<eos> He will.
One condition... I want a pound for every body you sell.<eos> A pound?<eos> - Man starts getting fancy clothes... also starts getting fancy ideas.<eos> Just think of it as a tax between a man and a wife.<eos> A kind of nuptial agreement, if you will.
We are doing very well alone, ain't we Martin?<eos> - Are you going to the colony?<eos> - Yes, if I may.<eos> Of course you may.<eos> Will you?
For 20 th July.<eos> That's all I can. Cancel the reservation!<eos> Comrade Commissar, I am telling you as your:<eos> Forbidden to annihilate Reservations! We received a directive from headquarters:<eos> Only by special order. So you will not?
I have.<eos> Just in Paris, over half the Israelites are French nationals.<eos> Not to mention their children, all born in France.<eos> The Germans won't take the children.<eos> Won't they?
- You like them?<eos> - Yes.<eos> What have you got here?<eos> Don't mess them up.<eos> I won't.
I lost your sister when she married that Neapolitan dickhead.<eos> Your brother won't even talk to me, he might as well be dead.<eos> You're my life, my blood, my breath.<eos> You have to help me.<eos> You will, won't you?
Promise me, anything you don't know how to fix, you'll leave it for a handyman.<eos> Leslie, I got this.<eos> You worry about getting to work on time.<eos> - Have fun tonight on your date.<eos> - I will.
We'll figure it out. - Hip down.<eos> - Breathe.<eos> - Well, I'll leave you guys to it.<eos> - Yeah, that feels good, right there.<eos> I'll just...
I bet you mean I 'destroyed' you.<eos> Oh...<eos> Okay, I'll be right back.<eos> "Unpause."<eos> Hey, no way, you'll a 'quitter' now!
Dad, it's okay. You can go.<eos> As soon as I'm finished here, I will get on a plane and I will be in L.A., I promise.<eos> - Just be careful, please.<eos> - Come here.<eos> I will.
Come on.<eos> - All right, best way to take this thing down is- hit the stress points.<eos> - Exactly.<eos> - Drake, he's gonna have to pay for what he did.<eos> - He will.
Of course.<eos> But we're running out of time.<eos> If your brother dismantles our opposition forces, we will no longer be able to reconstitute our nuclear program.<eos> He won't succeed.<eos> At this rate, he will.
They're going to kill him.<eos> Not if CTU can get there in time.<eos> There's a rescue operation underway.<eos> They know where he is?<eos> They will shortly.
A family of means and history, you fucking cunt!<eos> You sold the men!<eos> Common slaves, Who tried to kill me, tried to fuck me like a whore!<eos> But I will not be fucked!<eos> I! Will! Not!
I seriously doubt it.<eos> Oh, you do?<eos> Well, then, I guess you'll see.<eos> Will I?<eos> Yeah, you will.
You let them go and I won't hurt her.<eos> Her?<eos> Go ahead, see if I care<eos> I said let them go, now!<eos> Okay Cody, we will.
Find a way to be in your kid's life.<eos> You're a dad.<eos> And you're a good dad.<eos> You and Amy will find a way to do what's best for John.<eos> You will.
So, you were right in the end.<eos> It was her past.<eos> Did she get her memory back?<eos> Not yet.<eos> Will she?
- I'll be inside if you need anything.<eos> Okay. Thank you so much, Rebecca.<eos> Oh, my sweet, sweet, sweet boy.<eos> Oh, Robert... What if I never see him again?<eos> You will.
Okay. Thank you so much, Rebecca.<eos> Oh, my sweet, sweet, sweet boy.<eos> Oh, Robert... What if I never see him again?<eos> You will.<eos> You will.
Aw, well, Schuester here's a prime example.<eos> He used to have that glimmer ofhope in his eyes... that I can see right now in all of yours.<eos> But... he couldn't make it happen for himself... so he now has to try and convince you all that it'll happen for you. Guess what.<eos> His dream didn't work out.<eos> And neither will yours.
For the creation of stem cells the crossbreeding of different cell types is not even necessary anymore.<eos> Didn't you discuss that?<eos> - Yes, we have, and I understand it in principle, but really I don't understand it.<eos> Well, then come and visit me at the institute.<eos> I will.
- I joined the peace ambassadors.<eos> You don't have to be afraid of the v's anymore.<eos> I'm not afraid of the visitors, ty.<eos> I'm just afraid of losing you.<eos> You won't.
Cold is the least of my troubles.<eos> It's only a few days north to the Columbia by my reckoning.<eos> I been keepin' notes.<eos> What if we don't find water soon?<eos> We will.
I guess.<eos> Will you come with me?<eos> Well, it's the full moon tomorrow.<eos> I don't want to go on my own.<eos> Of course, yeah. Course I will.
Can you manage it?<eos> No. No, not unless...<eos> Why can't I sell you next year's wool?<eos> - You haven't got it yet.<eos> - But I will, in the spring.
Let me tell you something, you're a gangster,<eos> So technically, we really can't be seen together hang around togheter or even doing anything<eos> That's all I'm saying ...<eos> - Keep your words.<eos> - I will
I promise you.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I love you, Nina.<eos> I love you too.<eos> I always will.
They bought in Euros and lost big time.<eos> First thing in the morning, got some explaining to do in London.<eos> Told Susan to book you a ticket as well.<eos> My agenda is till... Wednesday.<eos> Then it'll just you and I.
I'm not supposed to have strangers in the house.<eos> Quite right. But may I use your bathroom?<eos> You know, my mother will be home soon.<eos> You should go.<eos> We will.
Walter?<eos> What can I do?<eos> I can't let Peter die again.<eos> And he's going to.<eos> They all will.
- You won't.<eos> Once he knows the whole story.<eos> Walter. You saved his life.<eos> I am sure that he will understand.<eos> No, he won't.
I'm glad you're with us.<eos> But Lucinda, she lost her life so I could have this body.<eos> There was only enough magic to bring you back.<eos> We should find Denna before the trail goes cold.<eos> We will.
I charge you both, as ye will answer at the dreadful Day of Judgment, when the secrets of all hearts will be disclosed, if either of you know any impediment why you may not be joined together, ye must now confess it.<eos> Wilt thou have this woman to be thy wedded wife?<eos> I will.<eos> Wilt thou have this man to be thy wedded husband?<eos> I will.
I will.<eos> And though the forces of evil are sworn to bring about your death, still, will you go on?<eos> I will.<eos> And will you accept the name of the Seeker?<eos> I will.
Th... there's something about the way the forms are so constrained and then this blue line in the middle just flies off the canvas like...<eos> Like it just wants to keep going forever or you know...<eos> Honestly, I think it looks like something Libby did in second grade.<eos> Oh. Would you just tell him I loved?<eos> I will.
Thanks to emily, we walk the streets in daylight.<eos> No one will ever suspect us.<eos> Not unless a human tells them.<eos> I'd sooner die.<eos> And soon enough, you will.
Whatever you say, dear.<eos> Dr. Krieger?<eos> Now, then...<eos> Still didn't get the contract.<eos> Oh, but I will.
Yeah, we'll, uh, be right there.<eos> There is absolutely no way i'm calling riley... To reminisce about a relationship... That just completely blew up.<eos> Owen likes the dynamic in the script.<eos> What if he senses, like, the major tension between us?<eos> No, no, no, he won't, okay?
No, thanks.<eos> You've been sitting there all day.<eos> Why?<eos> All right.<eos> I'll just...
Ah,it would've ended,anyway.<eos> Another one?<eos> I better not.<eos> I don't wanna regret anything in the morning.<eos> I won't if you won't.
Somebody took a shot at Ava tonight.<eos> Old Raylan here put one in him.<eos> I want to make sure it ain't you.<eos> Get your clothes off.<eos> Well, I will if you will.
I really don't see the point.<eos> If you change your mind, here's the info.<eos> We'd love to see you.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> Maybe we will.
Fine.<eos> Mike, give me a hand, will you?<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> This is so romantic.<eos> Karen, will you...
Oh!<eos> And little chocolates!<eos> This is going to be the best Valentine's Day ever.<eos> Yeah, I forgot about all this.<eos> But I never will.
Pop...<eos> Everyone will die.<eos> Want a drink too?<eos> Including me.<eos> My entire world will... 31st August.
Ah no. And I'm not, so.<eos> Yeah cause your life is boring So you're creating melodrama.<eos> No, I'm just trying to help that woman out.<eos> If the widow finds out...<eos> Which she won't.
Ben went out with Grace Bowman tonight.<eos> Ben and Grace?<eos> So you might wanna stick with Jimmy.<eos> Oh, and tell him thank you for dinner.<eos> Okay, I will.
His command of color the most magnificent.<eos> He transformed the pain of his tormented life into ecstatic beauty.<eos> Pain is easy to portray, but to use your passion and pain to portray the ecstasy and joy and magnificence of our world...<eos> No-one had ever done it before.<eos> Perhaps no-one ever will again.
Okay. So what do I do?<eos> Just take him back to my place.<eos> I'll meet you there with Russell.<eos> And, Candace, be careful.<eos> All right, I will.
I'd be nervous if I were you.<eos> Alex, leave your sister alone.<eos> She's gonna be fine. As long as I don't get the same guy.<eos> He's so mean.<eos> You probably will.
Someone may be dying.<eos> - Oh, the nurses will keep them alive until I get there.<eos> It's their job. So, uh... what needs to happen in order to keep the campaign going?<eos> I mean, I'm... sorry. I'm totally willing to keep the, you know, campaign going.<eos> I'll... I'll...
Especially since I can't destroy Jasper's life from home.<eos> Yeah, it might be time for you to let that go, buddy.<eos> What, are you kidding me?<eos> Well, the last plan didn't exactly go so well.<eos> Yeah, well, the next one will.
No one wants to kiss a girl in black.<eos> Oh, do stop admiring yourself.<eos> He's not marrying you for your looks.<eos> That's if he wants to marry you at all.<eos> He will.
Is that Logan... On a horse?<eos> Hello, milady.<eos> Would you like to accompany me to... The dance?<eos> Say yes!<eos> Heck, yeah, I will.
We're back.<eos> And you look even more beautiful than in my dreams.<eos> I love you.<eos> I never stopped loving you, not for one night, not for one moment.<eos> And I never will.
Thank you.<eos> Is Mom still mad at me?<eos> It's not you, buddy.<eos> Your mother really loves you.<eos> She always will.
I don't even know what happened.<eos> And he knows I like wings.<eos> I don't even like pizza that much.<eos> Oh, Amy, you will get through this.<eos> You will. No, I won't.
I can't go back to him now.<eos> That would be extremely skeevy.<eos> We just had lunch.<eos> I swear I will never see him again, I promise.<eos> Yes, you will.
So, do we break a patient's confidence and disobey her orders?<eos> We can't. Lfshe's forbidden it.<eos> - I must say I agree with you.<eos> - Well, I'll tell him.<eos> No, you will not.
It's like the cry of a banshee.<eos> Mr Carson's telephone is ringing.<eos> Isn't someone going to answer it?<eos> I wouldn't touch that thing with a ten-foot pole.<eos> Well, I will, then.
Every night has been.<eos> But, no, I still can't marry you.<eos> I need you to promise me something.<eos> Promise me that when I'm gone you'll still finish the record.<eos> I will.
But I was wrong.<eos> I'm just gonna be here, okay?<eos> I'll jump.<eos> I mean it.<eos> No, you won't.
I see a lady who won't take no for an answer.<eos> If you change your mind...<eos> I'm gonna give you my card and my home phone number.<eos> If you change your mind.<eos> I won't.
Don't you think it's odd?<eos> I don't know you.<eos> And I don't have to answer your questions.<eos> It would be better for you if you did.<eos> And sooner or later, Ms. Jimenez you will.
This is obviously important to you, and I get that.<eos> I said I'm going, and I'm going,<eos> So just leave it alone!<eos> If you can't go to this funeral with a smile on your face, Then don't go.<eos> Fine. I won't.
It's okay, Will.<eos> It's fine.<eos> My hope is that, uh... You know, when this whole thing is over, we can...<eos> Somehow, you know, find some way to - to keep our relationship.<eos> We will.
- I dropped it.<eos> - You couldn't pick it up?<eos> Well, I dropped it in a drain.<eos> If it's supposed to make me feel better, it don't.<eos> Well, maybe this will.
Glenn worth that to you?<eos> What life I have I owe to him.<eos> I was nobody to Glenn, just some idiot stuck in a tank.<eos> He could have walked away, but he didn't.<eos> Neither will I.
Look, if you're not going to admit to it, you might at least want to try coming up with a story that's a little more convincing.<eos> It's what happened!<eos> Like you weren't scared.<eos> I want this guy to fry, Beckett.<eos> - Ow. - Oh, he will.
"I never thought I'd have to tell you how I feel about us, "because the smile on my lips when I looked at you...<eos> "Pretty much said it all.<eos> "But now that you won't be seeing it anymore, "I'll have to use words to tell you.<eos> "I've never loved anyone the way I've loved you.<eos> "And I never will again.
I spent the last year trying to convince people that I didn't do it.<eos> And when I finally did, when I finally slept at home again, I...<eos> I will not take a plea of eight years.<eos> I did not do this.<eos> I will not.
You're being paranoid.<eos> Can you tell them I'm not like that?<eos> Tell the judge it's just an act.<eos> I'm not a bad girl.<eos> I will.
You're such a good liar.<eos> She'd have made a great lawyer.<eos> Sarah, this is ridiculous.<eos> You have to tell him the truth about your age.<eos> I will, Mom.
And when I found out what happened, I just...<eos> Suddenly, everything seemed less possible again.<eos> Saul, everything is still possible.<eos> Don't let what I did make you give up hope.<eos> I won't if you won't.
He's dead.<eos> Walt's no angel, but he didn't deserve this.<eos> Cops better find out who did this.<eos> - Someone's got to bring them to justice.<eos> - Someone will.
Give you credit.<eos> Most people, they'd be a bloodstain on my carpet right now.<eos> You made a mistake coming in here.<eos> - You'll never find Bailey without my help.<eos> - Yeah, I will.
I know.<eos> I just love you way too much.<eos> And I don't know what I would do.<eos> Okay. And then I think about Max and who's gonna take care of him when we're not around.<eos> Mom, I will.
You know, I just, um, you hear things, you know.<eos> You meet people.<eos> So, uh, I guess I'm cooler than you think, huh?<eos> We will see.<eos> Oh, yeah, we will.
Chase is checking everywhere in the neighborhood,<eos> The... the crawl space, the closets.<eos> Well, she can't get past the gate.<eos> Oh, God. I hope not.<eos> No, she won't.
Mum...<eos> I don't think I can do this, I don't want to do it.<eos> All right, love.<eos> Will you find who did this?<eos> Yes... ..we will.
You know me.<eos> - You wet your bed.<eos> - I did. I do.<eos> - I don't anymore.<eos> - You will.
No, don't go there.<eos> - Wait here, I'll go in and look.<eos> - No! Please!<eos> - Come on!<eos> - I won't.
He can't hurt you again, OK?<eos> How do you know?<eos> You didn't find him.<eos> You're right.<eos> But I will.
Oh, I am scared.<eos> Well, you know, I'm not a great man, Matthew, but I can tell you that fear... Well, it's just one of those things in this world, that proves beyond a shadow of a doubt that you're truly alive.<eos> And I can tell you that you're alive until you're dead.<eos> You are going to die, Matthew.<eos> We all will, eventually.
Except, uh, can I get his cell phone?<eos> You want a phone?<eos> Well, his phone actually.<eos> He doesn't need it anymore.<eos> He most certainly will not.
She cares about you... She... feel sorry for you.<eos> Okay?<eos> She loves me.<eos> She doesn't even know you.<eos> But she damn well will before the wedding.
Just how much jail time do you want to do?<eos> Because every minute of silence piles on the time!<eos> I want you to think about that.<eos> She'll talk.<eos> No, dad, she won't.
She responds to fairness and honesty.<eos> She needs to be convinced that taking the stand Equals doing what's right.<eos> - I thought she understood that.<eos> - She does.<eos> She will.
- That's all.<eos> - Yeah, well, you're probably gonna have more than a couple of years.<eos> Chances are, she's not going to Brown.<eos> I mean, not if some of her old classmates might be there.<eos> Which they definitely will.
What does that mean?<eos> Well, I mean, he was hesitating for whatever reason, and I encouraged him to go back with you, and if it doesn't work out, feel free to blame it on me.<eos> This time it'll work out.<eos> Well, if it doesn't.<eos> It will.
Jeff told me.<eos> Actually, I thought it was kind of funny, but I'm sure it was much funnier when you said it.<eos> Okay, you know, I think it's great.<eos> You should get a job.<eos> I will.
He was working long hours, and... I wanted him home. Where he'd be safe.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Do you care about any of that anymore?<eos> No. He loves you very much, you and Sophie.<eos> He always will.
Come on, Larry.<eos> You and I both know you're not gonna shoot me.<eos> Try me.<eos> You won't reach the door.<eos> Yes, I will.
Ah, we have to find her!<eos> If you find your mum, don't go near her.<eos> Even if she says it's her, you can't trust her, you call me.<eos> I know.<eos> I will.
Even I know who that is.<eos> Does Hiram know you have this?<eos> Has it helped?<eos> - You haven't read it.<eos> - I... I will.
I believe.<eos> It doesn't matter that men are weak.<eos> It doesn't matter that the Prophet isn't perfect.<eos> I believe.<eos> And I always will.
Who else knows we're here?<eos> My editor knows I found you, but I didn't tell him where.<eos> But if I was able to find you, how long before the bad guys find you?<eos> And I don't mean the FBI.<eos> Because they will. Soon.
It is so much better slowly, to take your time.<eos> You know, all my life,<eos> I've been meticulous about finishing what I start.<eos> And that bothers me, because I haven't finished what I started with you.<eos> And you won't, you sick scumbag.
She's still mad at me that I won't come home and sleep in my pink canopy bed.<eos> Mm. I always wanted a pink canopy.<eos> I wanted a horse.<eos> Please don't tell me that you always wanted to dissect dead people.<eos> Okay, I won't.
What a man!<eos> He made crazy things to hunt away his boredom, and now kids at school study what he did.<eos> I want kids to study my deeds too.<eos> - Come to my trial.<eos> - I will.
What kind of a jackal would turn his son against his own father?<eos> The kind who is paid in diamonds - although one less thanks to you.<eos> You dropped that crate on us.<eos> It's too bad you didn't get the message.<eos> But Tomba and his father will...very soon.
Ex-porn slut.<eos> Just say it in plain English.<eos> No one has to know about what you were doing before.<eos> I mean, past is past, and I won't tell anyone.<eos> Will you?
Do my time. Michael, it's up to me to check off the boxes, and I can't do that unless I honestly...<eos> Do you know how... Do you have any idea how angry that is making me?<eos> Tell me.<eos> I think we might be about to maybe really get somewhere.<eos> Yes, I will.
Schoolchildren in Madrid will mock laughs me.<eos> The balerina so ridiculous.<eos> We're gonne be fine.<eos> I need to look great!<eos> And you will...
Even her life.<eos> How about a farewell fuck?<eos> That's crass.<eos> And it won't save you.<eos> - What will? - Nothing.
In order to keep you safe, we need to keep you here.<eos> She's right.<eos> All right?<eos> You find her... before he does.<eos> We will.
You and me<eos> But in that interview yesterday we turned all that into a travesty<eos> And we aced it I mean, we...<eos> We sat there betraying it with big smiles on our faces<eos> But I won't, Birgitte.
Delay the press conference Move all my appointments.<eos> We're staying till tomorrow<eos> Thank you<eos> -Carsten Ockels hasn't arrived<eos> -He will
That would solve our problem.<eos> - But how?<eos> We'll leak Grozin's request for his arrest and hope he skips town.<eos> What if he doesn't?<eos> - He will.
Your guys shot one of the hostages.<eos> That was an accident.<eos> Your people had your gun pointed at a civilian who was clearly in distress.<eos> How did I know you weren't going to shoot?<eos> Any more tricks like that, and we will.
- No, it's Jordan Chase.<eos> But I'm looking for Dexter. Is he there?<eos> He... He's not available right now.<eos> Can I leave a message? Uh-huh. Tell him I'm just checking in, and I'd like him to schedule another appointment as soon as possible.<eos> I will. Bye.
So you found sugar dust.<eos> Good for you.<eos> Did you find excessive concentrations?<eos> No.<eos> But we will.
I know what you mean, brother.<eos> Wait a minute.<eos> I don't. What are you talking about?<eos> Nothing.<eos> I'll, um...
Ah, that kid must've said a hundred times how he didn't know they were going after a gambling debt.<eos> - Yeah. So?<eos> - Well, do you believe him?<eos> Okay, there you go.<eos> Neither will the jury.
Let's flag this guy.<eos> His credit cards, phone and license.<eos> He could be a flight risk.<eos> Oh, and if you happen to think of anything else, don't hesitate to call.<eos> I won't, Danny. Oh, and, um...
You're not going anywhere.<eos> I'm not?<eos> You have custody of our suspect's son.<eos> And you think that's a conflict of interest.<eos> Her attorney will.
Guinevere...<eos> They'll see.<eos> I don't care.<eos> I want you to know... ..if I never see you again...<eos> You will.
For the love of Camelot!<eos> HE GASPS<eos> I have a feeling I won't be seeing you again.<eos> No.<eos> You won't.
Then please help me convey this to him.<eos> Please tell him that Ma Hye Ri is looking for him, if he calls.<eos> You must help me convey this. Although I do not have any relationship with him, but you only have to tell him Ma Hye Ri.<eos> He'll know.<eos> Lawyer Seo will.
Baek Eun Jo!<eos> Where are your manners?<eos> Hurry and apologize to your nuna.<eos> I don't want to!<eos> I won't!
I'm consistent.<eos> I don't pretend to be humble because I'm famous.<eos> I must have betrayed the country in my past life, seeing as how I'm doing this with you.<eos> Hurry up and practice.<eos> I will!
Tell Daegil to hurry here.<eos> So I can get rid of him once and for all.<eos> He will soon come looking for us here.<eos> Indeed, indeed...<eos> Indeed he will.
There's two behind me and one at the northeast exit.<eos> There is a God. - You speak Swahili?<eos> - You don't?<eos> You got enough to work with, kid?<eos> We will.
That's my gum ball ring.<eos> Bea, I don't want to go anyplace else without you.<eos> I Iove you.<eos> Will you marry me?<eos> You will?
I won't.<eos> Seriously.<eos> Thanks.<eos> I'll call you tomorrow, all right?<eos> Yeah, you will.
I'll fill it in. Get the next train.<eos> Okay.<eos> Thanks.<eos> And you, you stay.<eos> He will.
But you're family.<eos> Promise me you'll stand by Andrew. Even if... if you don't agree with him.<eos> I promise.<eos> Andrew. Promise me you'll work harder to be a part of this family.<eos> I will.
I'm done.<eos> Don't you get it?<eos> You're not even gonna come home for Christmas any more?<eos> No, I didn't say that.<eos> I... Of course I will, Mom.
I personally believe that human evolution has run its course.<eos> We live in a world where the people who can make fire have a tendency to wear condoms, sit in casinos and drink themselves into a stupor.<eos> I believe that individual evolution has been replaced by something else.<eos> By a shared evolution.<eos> A communal contest, if you will.
Thank you, but I can handle it.<eos> Well, anyway, you'll be going off to college soon.<eos> The most important thing is that you're honest with her, that you treat her with respect.<eos> Thanks, Phil.<eos> I will.
What are you doing?<eos> - Do you remember me?<eos> Do you remember me?<eos> Hey, be careful.<eos> You will.
What? Doesn't she want to live better, too?<eos> I don't think she'll agree to all this stuff with her house.<eos> She's old and set in her ways.<eos> - She won't agree to it.<eos> - She will.
But when I found you.<eos> And it started again.<eos> And it's more intense than ever.<eos> And I never want to lose.<eos> I will not.
Is this guy nuts?<eos> He should work in a hospital and earn lots of money.<eos> What's he looking for in the mountains?<eos> Commander says, they'll definitely attack.<eos> Then they will.
So they're at least normal enough to have real jobs that pay tons of money.<eos> You think having lots of money makes you normal?<eos> You've clearly never met my family.<eos> Well, we'll see.<eos> Yes, we will.
Hey, no no.<eos> You said you had an idea.<eos> Well, go, follow it.<eos> Look, I told you this is not a good time.<eos> All right, I will.
I'm sick of his phony cheer, when he's so low.<eos> I've had it with cancer, Yom Kippurs, bar mitzvahs, his parents who make me feel oh so goy, and that damp beach house in Arcachon!<eos> Who is he?<eos> You don't know him.<eos> In time, I obviously will.
About time.<eos> Whatever he did has been locked up in him for 40 years.<eos> He can't get it out.<eos> I think he told you, and he wants you to tell it for him.<eos> Because he won't.
He can't get it out.<eos> I think he told you, and he wants you to tell it for him.<eos> Because he won't.<eos> Or can't.<eos> Or won't.
Is everything all right?<eos> Take me back to my country.<eos> Princess, I'm sorry, but General Kane has taken control of your country and assumed command of its government.<eos> - But I must go back.<eos> - And you will.
No, but they supply girls, some of them very high-end, to fine, upstanding clients.<eos> There's one client I'm interested in.<eos> Find out who's connected to the Dollhouse, the Borodins won't be touched and you'll never see me again.<eos> I haven't seen you yet.<eos> You will.
You're back, Seeker.<eos> You can kill the Master.<eos> You can free the Confessed.<eos> Please, will you help us?<eos> I will.
You think the first time was good?<eos> Second time's even better.<eos> All the know-how, none of the aches and pain.<eos> No. I won't do this.<eos> I won't.
Say it.<eos> It means you're a monster.<eos> You don't know me.<eos> You never did.<eos> And you never will.
I will.<eos> I will. Honey, I am so sorry.<eos> You didn't plan it this way, I know.<eos> Just make it to our little ceremony tomorrow, and I'll be fine.<eos> I will.
Then you met at the elevator, possible kiss there.<eos> Then the doctor went up and the doctor came down. Then there was a thumbs-up, but that's it.<eos> I have no idea what happened in between.<eos> Have you told Lauren?<eos> No, and I won't.
Immaculate.<eos> Why did you show me this?<eos> Do you want to know what happens when you die?<eos> Yes.<eos> You will.
Seventeen fifty?<eos> We'll make it 1750, for, like, you know, interest.<eos> - I thought your word was your bond. - Lt totally is.<eos> Definitely. I just don't have the money at this particular moment.<eos> But I will, soon.
- Soul mates ?<eos> Does Kyle know about any of this ?<eos> He's never said anything.<eos> But I think he feels the same way.<eos> Or he will eventually.
I never mentioned it.<eos> There's a lot of things I know about you, Jessi. A lot more than you think.<eos> I think it's time I explained.<eos> As long as you don't rat me out to mom and dad.<eos> I won't. - Fine.
I don't think anyone should know about this yet.<eos> - I know it's not over.<eos> - No.<eos> We need to find out why he did it.<eos> We will.
Why?<eos> Because you all want to lose yourself in another person.<eos> You believe that love is transcendent and eternal.<eos> I want to believe that, too.<eos> Hey, you will.
I want to believe that, too.<eos> Hey, you will.<eos> I promise.<eos> Someday you will.<eos> You will someday, okay?
Hey, you will.<eos> I promise.<eos> Someday you will.<eos> You will someday, okay?<eos> You will.
SO HE HAS DIBS. YOU RESPECT DIBS,DON'T YOU?<eos> I'M NOT A BARBARIAN.<eos> GOOD.<eos> WILL YOU ET ME IN 20 MINUTES AT THE SPOT?<eos> I WILL.
Mr. Reyes has been notified.<eos> And that's my only legal obligation.<eos> Yes, and we both know Mr. Reyes is innocent, don't we?<eos> Do you have evidence to prove that Mr. Sheridan had any involvement?<eos> I will.
So when you've Gotten your license, This little beauty Is all yours.<eos> Dad! Huh?<eos> How do you like Your old man now, huh?<eos> But you can't let Your grades slip. No, they won't.<eos> They won't. All right.
Oh, actually, you can't.<eos> He's dead.<eos> What the hell are you thinking?<eos> I don't want to end up like Logan.<eos> You won't.
I flunked out.<eos> Why?<eos> What a fucking question!<eos> I'm talking because I want a cigarette, give me one and I'll leave.<eos> I won't.
The whole day?<eos> I think we should go.<eos> Now, I know that you're angry, but there are some things that are difficult for me to compromise on.<eos> - So I don't even get a say?<eos> - No, sometimes you will.
So, you're offering me Bradley's job as president of the company?<eos> I can't think of anyone better suited.<eos> Now, of course, it would be the same compensation package.<eos> - Please, tell me you'll accept.<eos> - He sure will.
Found the contract. Everything is in order.<eos> All we need now is your signature.<eos> Mr. Dinsmore, would you mind if I speak to my husband for a moment?<eos> Oh, yeah, please go ahead.<eos> I'll...
See you soon, Dr. Stevens.<eos> - Hope so.<eos> - Know so.<eos> - Dr. Bailey, if something goes wrong...<eos> - It won't.

Betty, come on.<eos> the man made me dress up in a bunny costume.<eos> I have to prove to him that i deserve respect.<eos> Besides, nothing's official until he signs on the dotted line.<eos> Lower that, will ya?
Bad Blake's hit the big time.<eos> That's great, right?<eos> That's what my agent says.<eos> You gonna come with me?<eos> - Will you?
How do you find my home?<eos> You-you would be killed if the Governor had not given?<eos> Since small-, I dream of dying a martyr.<eos> -I believe that death does not you, will you do about it.<eos> One day you will a little old,
You will give me yours, lady, unless you want everyone to know your little secret. Very well.<eos> Go to Nottingham, have the deeds drawn up.<eos> Thank you, my lord.<eos> Malcolm, the lands have to pass to Guy.<eos> And they will.
I know that.<eos> It happened.<eos> But this is your one chance to get out in front of it, so tell me what happened.<eos> Just tell me the truth, and I promise I'll do everything I can to help you.<eos> I will.
You're T ony Crane.<eos> I assume at some point there will be a little more to your line of questioning than this.<eos> T ony Crane.<eos> I'm sorry, do we know each other?<eos> We will.
I need to get the bullet out.<eos> How did you know there was a bullet in my leg, Richard?<eos> - Because you told me there was.<eos> - No, I didn't.<eos> Well... you will.
You're the one shut down, Crunchy.<eos> I could say you're always broke. At the store, we always have to lend you money.<eos> You don't even have ten cents for a can of pop.<eos> I'll pay you back.<eos> No you won't.
I stop the killings, I promise.<eos> The eggs are too well protected today.<eos> Impossible to achieve your old friend Stojkovic.<eos> You want to be avenged, no?<eos> Yes, you will.
I'm already in so much trouble with dad.<eos> What's the worst that can happen now?<eos> - I heard the word "jail" again.<eos> Um, why don't I just take Sarah to the movies?<eos> - No. No, you will not.
And now I have.<eos> Only to run from me.<eos> El, do not run.<eos> Come with me.<eos> I will.
It's an ambitious development.<eos> And a lucrative one.<eos> When this land becomes available, I will need capital investors.<eos> - If this land becomes available.<eos> - It will.
Are you his family? - Please, Dr. Gallagher!<eos> Or was that just another helping of Hollywood rubbish?<eos> Help him.<eos> Please help him.<eos> I will.
- And that's justice?<eos> - That's reality.<eos> See, I have a sympathetic victim, a nervous defendant, strong evidence.<eos> And you never lose.<eos> Some day I will.
- You said you didn't care.<eos> - I care about surviving.<eos> - You need to take a timeout, Neil.<eos> You'll get it, Bernard.<eos> You will.
Is that him?<eos> Why not my place?<eos> It's too small.<eos> We'll disturb you if you want to watch TV.<eos> No, you won't.
- Yeah. Why, do you know her?<eos> Yes, John.<eos> I know her.<eos> I'll miss you, John.<eos> I really will.
Eli, we'd better get back to the North Pole, lickety-split.<eos> Santa's gonna need all the help he can get.<eos> - He can talk? - Uh-huh.<eos> We don't have enough magic to power the truck.<eos> We will soon.
Me too, Lady Redbush.<eos> All those months I was without you, I never stopped seeing' your face in the back of my wife's head.<eos> And all those months I was sailin' for the new world I saw your face in every slave's stomach.<eos> Tell me we'll be together forever.<eos> We will.
You have to talk him out of this.<eos> - Me?<eos> - You're his hero.<eos> He doesn't listen to people like me.<eos> If he won't, others will.
What?<eos> That I want you in my life forever.<eos> Steve?<eos> Will you marry me?<eos> Of course I will.
Having a baby does not make either one of us an adult. I don't wanna talk about tonightonth an Frankly,I'm a little nervous.<eos> Don't be nervous. They're nice guys.<eos> Yeah,but I'm not.<eos> - What if they don't like me?<eos> - They will.
And it's not.<eos> It's clearly not.<eos> So I can't marry you,Amy.<eos> But we're gonna have to figure out what this non-married, unmarried,want-to-be-marrd relationship is.<eos> And we will.
It's clearly not.<eos> So I can't marry you,Amy.<eos> But we're gonna have to figure out what this non-married, unmarried,want-to-be-marrd relationship is.<eos> And we will.<eos> We will.
You can make sure that my parents don't get divorced.<eos> They seem unhappy.<eos> Couldn't help but notice.<eos> But I think they think that if they get divorced, they're gonna be a lot happier.<eos> Yeah,but I won't.
What happened to her, anyway, your iceberg girlfriend?<eos> She didn't get you to take the gig.<eos> That's what happened to her.<eos> I guess you'll be joing her, 'cause you didn't, either.<eos> Oh, I will.
That's great, Yigal.<eos> I'm proud of you.<eos> I'm really proud of you.<eos> I want to come with you to Paris.<eos> -So you will.
- Wha...?<eos> - Back seat.<eos> Get in!<eos> Please. Don't hurt me.<eos> We won't.
Maybe.<eos> I'll think about it.<eos> Okay.<eos> I'll see you at the game tomorrow.<eos> Yes, you will.
He cut off his own hand.<eos> Thought he could stop the bleeding, but he panicked.<eos> - Is he okay?<eos> - Somebody better call his parents.<eos> I will.
But,you know,as the old adage goes,keep your friends close and your enemies closer,that's right,right?<eos> Here's the thing,if i go with you-- you know-- there are two basic alliances,right.<eos> I know i can get to the final four with taj and brendan.<eos> And i will go with you,with coach,tyson and debbie now if you promise me you will turn on them.<eos> I will.
You know what? It's okay.<eos> Someday you'll let someone in.<eos> Today's just not that day.<eos> I don't want this to change anything.<eos> No, it won't.
Change perspectives.<eos> GisèIe?<eos> I know that Fred's body isn't even cold yet.<eos> I don't want to take advantage of the situation.<eos> But... I will, just a little, to...
Aren't you coming with me?<eos> Not yet.<eos> But I want you to meet him.<eos> I brought you here to meet him.<eos> I will.
I'm pretty desperate too.<eos> Amy...<eos> There's a couple out there just dreaming of becoming parents to your baby.<eos> I'm sure you'll find them - And if I don't?<eos> - You will.
What the hellam I supposed to do with that?<eos> I swear to god, marshal.<eos> Relax, I'll have himin denver by 10:00 A.M.Tomorrow,ready to testify.<eos> Straight.<eos> I will.
Of course.<eos> She has always been in my mind. Every single day.<eos> Life has taken me my daughter but gave me back three children.<eos> Take care of each other.<eos> - We will.
- Promise.<eos> This Officer La Reynie... He killed Blanche too.<eos> I'll cut him open.<eos> Like an animal.<eos> Yes you will.
I know. I am busy chasing a crook.<eos> Yesterday, he killed six of my men.<eos> - God!<eos> Did you arrest him?<eos> - I will soon.

A woman.<eos> He needs me.<eos> He won't want to make me mad.<eos> I can't lose you.<eos> You never will.
But you're not easy to read.<eos> We really need to talk about personal space.<eos> It's not too late, Jordan.<eos> Boodikka believes in my vision.<eos> Others will too.
I even killed myself to try escape this life.<eos> But the darkness, it doesn't come out when Chloe's around.<eos> She makes me human.<eos> What happens when that changes?<eos> It won't.
He'll be reading and dribbling first.<eos> They are gonna be amazing parents.<eos> And you are gonna be an amazing mom.<eos> You should have that one day.<eos> And you will.
You suck for not telling me, and I'm not going anywhere, so...<eos> What are we gonna do, P. Sawyer?<eos> How am I gonna help us get through this?<eos> I don't know.<eos> We just will.
Hey! We know what you did.<eos> Well, do you now?<eos> You went too far, Michael.<eos> I'm calling the cops.<eos> No, you won't.
People being fired-- Times are tough.<eos> Sure, yeah.<eos> We can't let that happen.<eos> Don't worry, son.<eos> We won't.
Yeah, put your head down, let's go.<eos> Let's go.<eos> You know, someday, weeks will go by. Maybe even years. It won't even cross our minds.<eos> Yeah, all we gotta do is survive.<eos> We will.
She was working for him, right?<eos> I don't really think that's on her mind right now.<eos> Sure.<eos> Well, tell her we're sorry.<eos> I will.
Well, I will not ask him to do that.<eos> Do you really love him?<eos> Sometimes things are just what they appear to be.<eos> Will you help me?<eos> Yes, I will.
Well, that's good.<eos> Thank you, nora.<eos> Because the pastor will know what to do.<eos> That's right.<eos> She will.
I'll go first.<eos> Jack, don't misunderstand who's in charge here.<eos> I'll go first.<eos> If someone in that house is a threat, you might hesitate.<eos> - But I won't.
I need to get the bullet out.<eos> How did you know there was a bullet in my leg, Richard?<eos> Because you told me there was, John.<eos> No, I didn't.<eos> Well... You will.
I should probably get some rest.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, I should go.<eos> Hey, but, uh, don't forget to put ointment on it.<eos> I won't.
But even when our hopes give way to reality and we finally have to surrender to the truth... it just means we've lost today's battle... could I have another,please?<eos> Not tomorrow's war.<eos> So I guess a big wedding won't be that bad.<eos> I'm just sad 'cause I didn't get a chance to see you in the actual dress.<eos> -You will.
Well, it needs work.<eos> I'm going back to the office.<eos> Come and see me when you're done.<eos> - I don't believe this n. I.p. stuff works at all.<eos> - You will.
So how about it?<eos> Want to come over?<eos> Oh,not today,hijito.<eos> But once I've moved in,you and your friends should comeover here.<eos> Okay,fresa.We will.We will.
If there is any way that you can see clear to hand him over, I swear I will bring him back the minute that he's sentenced.<eos> I can do that.<eos> This is an open-and-shut case for us. Nobody got hurt.<eos> As long as you promise to bring him back.<eos> Oh, I will.
I need to finish my yogurt... then I was planning on working out-<eos> Well, until your calendar clears up, just know... I'm gonna make my way through every friend, relative and associate you have.<eos> Let me save you some time.<eos> My friends and family don't know anything.<eos> Sooner or later, someone will.
It is supposed to only be six inches from the curb!<eos> Say it's eight inches from the curb.<eos> Say it!<eos> - Get off me, man!<eos> - I will.
You look freaked out?<eos> No,no,no,I'm not.I'm not freaked out.<eos> It--it--it's exciting.It's just big.It's big. I know it is.I'm just asking you to think about it,okay?<eos> But try to think good things.<eos> I will.
THIS IS A COUPLE'S THING. MY WIFE IS VERY EXCITED.<eos> - AS WAS I.<eos> - WHAT'S REALLY GOING ON WITH YOU?<eos> - WHAT IF YOUR WIFE DOESN'T LIKE MARLOW?<eos> - OF COURSE SHE WILL!
But I'm glad I did it. I got it over with.<eos> - And I wanted to tell you first because I wanted you to know that you didn't fuck me up.<eos> My life is tough and weird and unpleasant sometimes, but I walk around knowing that I have parents who love me, who care about me, who always try their best, even if they screw up sometimes.<eos> I know I gave you a hard time when Mom was gone, but I hope you know that I love you, Dad.<eos> And I always will.
And he paid a heavy price.<eos> He didn't ask for forgiveness.<eos> He didn't ask for anything.<eos> He just said, "do thisand you and all the families "hurt by the bridge collapse will get your justice."<eos> Maybe now you will.
You were late.<eos> You were early.<eos> They targeted me too when you got yourself killed.<eos> I love you.<eos> I always will.
Are you all right?<eos> I think it's marvelous the hotel has a nurse on duty.<eos> I'm sorry I puked.<eos> It won't happen again.<eos> Yes it will.
And what did I get out of it?<eos> I don't even have money for cigarettes<eos> You are too old<eos> - Nobody would want you<eos> - Somebody will
!<eos> What if he doesn't come?<eos> He will come.<eos> What if not?<eos> He will!
It's my fault.<eos> If I hadn't slept on that mattress... we could have just returned them and moved on.<eos> - Hey, can I give you some advice?<eos> You need to give yourself a break.<eos> You'll...
- whatever you're going to do, I don't care.<eos> Just please, i'm begging you.<eos> Don't tell him. - i wouldn't.<eos> I wouldn't.<eos> i won't.
I count myself among them.<eos> But if I follow the path that my father has laid down, it'll be years before I'll have the power to act.<eos> I may be more than 30!<eos> And by then I might be as hidebound as he.<eos> No, you won't.
Are you with me?<eos> I hope so, this thing works, you will be the fucking mayor.<eos> Thanks for stopping by, Hector.<eos> So no uncle Bobby, right?<eos> Will you...?
But we don't... I mean, we've never... Tucker, you know me.<eos> I'm a planner.<eos> I didn't know you were planning that.<eos> Listen. I promise I'll never... I'll never do something stupid like go through your purse ever again.<eos> Yes, you will.
How many times I got to tell y'all that?<eos> We going to trial.<eos> - We will lose.<eos> - We ain't gonna lose.<eos> Yes, we will.
Fine, I will help you.<eos> My gosh! Thank you.<eos> After I slam his dick in this drawer.<eos> - Let's go, he's not gonna help.<eos> - No, I will.
I wonder what they're talking about.<eos> Don't say anything to Ricky about Mr. Juergens.<eos> He might tell Amy.<eos> He might tell Amy.<eos> No, I won't.
Don't say anything to Ricky about Mr. Juergens.<eos> He might tell Amy.<eos> He might tell Amy.<eos> No, I won't.<eos> I won't.
I was much younger when my dad died.But, uh, I remember how I would go from weeping to forgetting to remembering to being screaming angry-- just hitting my bed with a baseball bat.<eos> That helps.<eos> If you want, I'll bring you a bat.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Maybe I will.
Come on. No way.<eos> We need you here.<eos> Did you cousin in Romania?<eos> - I think so. Call her directly.<eos> We will a month the salon open.
I'm sellingmy personal collection.<eos> It's the only wayto keep sofia.<eos> Wait,you're selling off assets to pay for your wife'scrazy shopping sprees?<eos> Why don't you just tell her that you can't afford themanymore?<eos> This will coverour medical bill.
Counselor, are you okay?<eos> I need a moment.<eos> And what do you tell him?<eos> I tell him that his dad is always with him... always loves him... and I pray to God that as he gets older, Michael doesn't forget his father.<eos> He won't.
Stay here.<eos> I wanna get a picture.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> You'll see her again.<eos> Sure I will.
- Calm down, lloyd.<eos> - I can't.<eos> We're gonna make magic together, johnny drama.<eos> Let me just please get this show.<eos> You will.
I really look forward to helping you out.<eos> Uh, do you know when he'll be back?<eos> You want the truth?<eos> - sure.<eos> - uh, he won't.
Why didn't he just tell me?<eos> 'Cause he knew you'll try to stop him.<eos> He knew you do anything to protect your family.<eos> But I didn't.<eos> Well... You will soon.
I'll handle it.<eos> Will you please trust me?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> You don't understand.<eos> Later, you will.
But what I can do is try to prove to you... as much as possible that.<eos> I will try my best to do what's right what... whatever that is for us and for our kid.<eos> Every family has these doubts, but... you just have to make a leap of faith.<eos> I just want to make sure we leap together.<eos> We will.
Right.<eos> Look, I got a sponsor.<eos> Hey, baby, how about giving me some of that money, 'cause... ?<eos> Did you ever give Mick that board I sent ?<eos> Uh... I will, I will.
I don't know. I'm not a piece of meat.<eos> I mean, I got feelings, emotions.<eos> Time's a-wastin'.<eos> Drop them.<eos> No, there'll no pant-dropping without a nice dinner and many, many cocktails.
Yes.<eos> In the kitchen.<eos> In the kitchen.<eos> I don't smell anything. You will, mother.<eos> You will.
And I don't see you going the turkey baster route, so I just assumed that you had a boyfriend,<eos> - and I could call him for you.<eos> - Mom. Unless you think he strangled you because he's married.<eos> I don't want to talk about this now.<eos> Then we won't.
The case is closed.<eos> I still don't understand.<eos> Why would the mob want to kill him?<eos> Nobody knows.<eos> Probably never will.
Maybe I'm... it's just not in me.<eos> It is.<eos> You're a good man.<eos> And in time, eventually, you'll, uh, you'll find someone.<eos> You will.
Okay,what kind of a car was she driving?<eos> A Nissan.<eos> There's the license number right there.<eos> Tell me you'll help me.<eos> I will.
Take the ring, put it on.<eos> - No.<eos> - You have to. Now.<eos> What if i never see you again?<eos> You will.
And I'm asking you right here. Right now. To allow me to help you finish that fight.<eos> You see this gentlemen. This right here, this is the past.<eos> Who wants to finish this fight?<eos> Who'll finish this fight with me?<eos> I will sir.
You don't use it for an out, not in that situation.<eos> - I struck him out.<eos> - We'll talk about this later.<eos> - I'm gonna make our deal.<eos> - No, you won't.
Fine, I'll do it, but not today.<eos> I mean, how heartless would it be to break up With someone five months before their birthday?<eos> The follow-through is looking much better, Gladys.<eos> You go, Gladys, you're gonna get it in one day.<eos> - She never will. - No.
Put your hands behind your back.<eos> You are making a bad mistake.<eos> If you people don't let me go right now,<eos> Mia westlake will be tortured to death If they think you've Done anything to me.<eos> No, they won't.
now I'm going to kill the demon!<eos> cast!<eos> the demon escaped to the other side!<eos> If no one can help ... here.<eos> tomorrow I will not.
Not after everything I've done.<eos> I'm not asking permission.I quit.<eos> This is the year,Luke!<eos> You blow this chance,and you will regret it for the rest of your life!<eos> I won't.
You'll call, right, Pop?<eos> I'll call, you'll call, we'll visit.<eos> We'll be sick of each other.<eos> I'll miss ya, Hank.<eos> Of course you will.
It's just...<eos> You never asked me to go with you, and that kind of hurt.<eos> So you'd have gone with me?<eos> 'Cause, baby, if you want to go... Come to Los Angeles with me.<eos> Will you?
- It depends, what are you asking for?<eos> - I need to call in a favor.<eos> I'm gonna take run at her.<eos> She's not gonna simply crack under pressure.<eos> Under the right kind of pressure, she will.
Lady, I don't have any idea what you're talking about.<eos> But do yourself a favor.<eos> Don't lose any sleep worrying about me.<eos> (chuckles) Don't worry.<eos> I won't.
Thank you, mother.<eos> So i take it you didn't tell him About your little trip this summer?<eos> No, and i'd like to keep it that way.<eos> When will you learn, my love, That some secrets can't stay hidden?<eos> Well, this one will.
It's like putting Jesus on the Star of David.<eos> Oh, now that's just offensive. I can't believe you'd even say that.<eos> Besides, it's white on white. You can't even read it!<eos> Well, the important thing is, you know it's there.<eos> But my congregation won't.
- Oh, gesundheit. [ECHOING]<eos> PLASTIC MAN: Do you swear allegiance to the side of goodness and right?<eos> WOOZY: I do.<eos> Will you strike terror into cowardly and superstitious criminals everywhere?<eos> WOOZY: I will.
Gotta bring it on the boat and check it out. I cleaned this off like five minutes a go. Right?<eos> Right now the problem is this, there's too many flying fish... Too many...around us.<eos> If we moor through the nights with the lights on and stuff, more and more will keep coming and what they're doing is they're actually laying on the boat now, so the boat has become their object and that is not good.<eos> So basically you're worried that if we just stay on this drift we're gonna sink the boat.<eos> Five hours from now that'll 3,000 pounds.Yeah, yeah.
Don't worry, let me see it.<eos> Oooh, good shot, Douglas!<eos> Almost got me. Almost got me, Douglas.<eos> We'll get him next time, won't we?<eos> Yes, we will. We will.
Three groups, 12 people each. And immediately begin a search on foot across the lake.<eos> You have 24 hours.<eos> They won't make it back alive, Comrade Zhdanov.<eos> Out of three groups?<eos> Someone will.
And since I've been with her, I feel safe.<eos> I haven't felt that way for a long time.<eos> Not since I was a kid.<eos> I wish she could hear you sing.<eos> Maybe she will one day.
This industry will turn your best friends into your worst enemies.<eos> Pac warned me, but I didn't believe him.<eos> This song was made months ago.<eos> He probably won't believe me.<eos> Maybe nobody will.
Arjun, just a minute..<eos> ..I'm just giving a coin to a beggar.<eos> I told you before, I'll pay you on the 25th.<eos> But in which month?<eos> In any month, but I surely will.
That one, which is shining the brightest.<eos> Yes.<eos> - I want to shine in the world just liket hat.<eos> One day, the two of us will be shining just like that star.<eos> Yes, we will.
What do you want?<eos> - What you wanted from your mother.<eos> I want you to love me.<eos> Okay.<eos> I will.
She saved us.<eos> - Alex? - Alex, tell him.<eos> Anna, what are you saying?<eos> He can't see it, Anna.<eos> He never will.
She's part of me. We've been together all these years.<eos> But you're more than a husband and father.<eos> She must understand that.<eos> The best interests of the people are one with your own. - You belong to them.<eos> - She won't.
That's why I'm here.<eos> - I want to talk to you guys.<eos> - I thought he was a teacher.<eos> - Guys, come here.<eos> - No, I won't.
Good.<eos> Maybe I'll finally get an update on Angela.<eos> Angela.<eos> An update from you.<eos> - Yes, no, you will.
Maybe I'll finally get an update on Angela.<eos> Angela.<eos> An update from you.<eos> - Yes, no, you will.<eos> Everybody will.
And I promise that I will be at every game, cheering for you.<eos> - Every game?<eos> - Every game.<eos> But I will not wear that gaudy orange.<eos> I will not.
- Can I contact my parents? - No.<eos> - Derek?<eos> - Negative.<eos> - Do they know where I am?<eos> - No, and they never will!
Yes, of course.<eos> Chaos Theory is the idea that all actions have consequences... when you take that... quantum leap...<eos> OK, erm, bit of advice.<eos> When you are talking about this stuff, speak with a bit more confidence about it.<eos> OK, well, I will.
- I know that!<eos> I'm going to talk to him tonight. Face to face about this.<eos> I swear to you, when I tell him that we're ready, he's going to jump at the chance.<eos> - And if he doesn't?<eos> - He will.
Now go to England and make her smile.<eos> Is this all the luggage?<eos> - What if she wants to dance?<eos> - It's your first visit.<eos> She won't.
He was full of hope and trust.<eos> "Good luck, Winnie," he said.<eos> "God bless you."<eos> I mustn't let him down.<eos> - You won't.
My formal event wardrobe is pretty non-existent.<eos> Oh, hey. If you're still out shopping this afternoon, call me.<eos> I need no excuse to buy myself a little new something.<eos> Yeah, cool.<eos> I will.
Then, when we do, we're going to open this bottle of champagne.<eos> And we're going to drink to Phillip Robinson and Darren Covington and all the other patients who helped us change the face of medicine.<eos> And we're going to celebrate.<eos> We're going to use this as our victory dance.<eos> Meredith, we will.
- Wait, Jer.<eos> Wait.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - What if you die?<eos> - I won't.
- Yeah.<eos> - What if you die?<eos> - I won't.<eos> - What if I die?<eos> - You won't.
- Danny mccoy.<eos> What do you have to say for yourself?<eos> How can you put your head on your pillow and sleep at night?<eos> I can answer that for you...<eos> you won't.
Your Majesty.<eos> I ask you only one thing.<eos> That you allow me to serve and worship you as Lancelot served and worshipped Guinevere.<eos> Sweet, gentle lady will you let me so?<eos> I will.
"Hey, let's have lunch every Thursday.<eos> How 'bout a little business deal?"<eos> He's writing a cashier's check faster than he can change his wet diaper.<eos> I just think he's lonely and his wife died.<eos> So will we.
Is he a friend of yours?<eos> Stay calm, we'll help you. -Police!<eos> -Someone's at the door.<eos> Open the door! Police!<eos> -I won't.
- You're a squirter.<eos> - Shane.<eos> What about my brother?<eos> I don't wanna lose him.<eos> You won't.
I promise.<eos> My birthday's in two months, Owen.<eos> I'm gonna have a party at my new house.<eos> Make sure you guys come to the Flats for it.<eos> - I will.
I guess it just took a trip to see my grands to put it in perspective.<eos> Nothing needs to get put in perspective.<eos> It was a disagreement.<eos> That'll happen.<eos> It will.
What does that tell you?<eos> It tells you that dead people don't like company.<eos> - Now, jog them on.<eos> - All right, I'll tell them to leave.<eos> Yes, you fucking well will. Smelly junkies.
Those Parties Can Be That Way.<eos> So Are You,Um, Packing Up Your Music?<eos> Nah.<eos> I Just... Need To Find Something New To Write About.<eos> And I Will.
I'm so sorry.<eos> I hope they didn't scare you.<eos> No, no, it's... We love dogs!<eos> Dude, this idea of yours better work.<eos> It will.
Okay?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I'm sorry. I'm sorry, okay?<eos> Daddy's really sorry.<eos> I will never-
So he came in third and they're only giving out two spots this year, so...<eos> You behave yourself over there.<eos> I don't want his mum calling me with no stories.<eos> No. She won't.<eos> She won't.
If you give me just a little wider smile.<eos> Oh, shut up, Harvey.<eos> So how's this going to work, Mr. Shine?<eos> I have absolutely no idea.<eos> But it will.
20 minutes.<eos> Shake some hands on the rope line, meet and greet with the mayor.<eos> Well,that sounds like the time for us to make our move.<eos> You got the password yet?<eos> I will.
Thank you.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I really wanted you to have your family at the wedding.<eos> I will.
Then I'll unseal it.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> We got to get off the street or they're going to be on us in no time.<eos> We're not going to make it to Texas like this.<eos> Yes, we will.
Yes, sir.<eos> We got to get off the street or they're going to be on us in no time.<eos> We're not going to make it to Texas like this.<eos> Yes, we will.<eos> Yes, we will.
Yeah, no shit.<eos> Thanks for noticing.<eos> I haven't been myself lately, but I love you.<eos> Nothing about that has changed.<eos> Nothing ever will.
She's dead.<eos> Yeah, I remember watching her fall.<eos> Me too.<eos> How will she get the notes?<eos> She won't.
No.<eos> She's got the gate to hell between her legs.<eos> Why don't you tell your precious Julia where you were last night?<eos> Okay, fine.<eos> I will.
When you're a mama lion, and you see a baby cub in distress, you instinctively move to help.<eos> You need to be told the truth.<eos> And what might that be?<eos> Sean doesn't love you.<eos> And he never will.
- I'm not done yet.<eos> - I won't get paid.<eos> - I'll pay you.<eos> The boy and I have an agreement, I think you should respect that.<eos> - No, Lennart, I won't.
- I saw that.<eos> Oh, man.<eos> We've been living in perfect marital bliss for three weeks.<eos> I don't want to lose what we have here.<eos> Then we won't.
Look, the kids know I'm a psychiatrist and that what they say to me is confidential.<eos> So they feel safe coming to me with their problems.<eos> But you can't say what you talked about?<eos> I can't.<eos> And as a man of my word, I won't.
You're a lucky man.<eos> The bond between a father and a daughter, nothing like it.<eos> Just make sure you cherish every second of it.<eos> Because let me tell you something, it goes by fast.<eos> - I will.
- Mother.<eos> As bad as that?<eos> - I won't be like a monkey! - Afraid so.<eos> I won't be like them! I don't want to be black!<eos> I won't, I won't!
You will go where he says.<eos> You will give him your cash, and then you will hit the deck when the bullets start flying.<eos> Once Michael's dead, then you can run.<eos> And Drew, if you ever come back, I will find you...<eos> - I won't. - Good.
I haven't had much luck in my life so if I succeeded, anyone could succeed.<eos> Tibi...<eos> It just occurred to me:<eos> I don't want to die yet.<eos> Then you won't.
I'm leaving Russia.<eos> Why?<eos> What tired eyes you have.<eos> I love you.<eos> And I always will.
Find them al lby next Friday, and I'll give you another eighth of an inch.<eos> And I'll take that eighth of an inch, sir.<eos> I'll take it like a man.<eos> - I know you will.<eos> - Yeah, I will.
I'm coming over.<eos> Reschedule<eos> Curious.<eos> Can someone do me ?<eos> - I will.
Reschedule<eos> Curious.<eos> Can someone do me ?<eos> - I will.<eos> - I will.
Chemical smells, which makes me wonder if someone hasn't set up a drug lab.<eos> A drug lab.<eos> In Middleton?<eos> You need to check on it.<eos> I will.
I believe this just about sums things up, kids.<eos> Yes?<eos> No? Anyone?<eos> Jason and Cindy cannot beat you again in Miami.<eos> - They won't.
So you tell me.<eos> –Do I wait for you?<eos> –I want you to.<eos> But I understand if you can't.<eos> Well, I will.
- Really?<eos> - Only slightly.<eos> I don't care.<eos> Show me how.<eos> I will.
I lost two men this afternoon.<eos> You despise your men.<eos> If I send a man to die, I need something to show for it.<eos> You'll get your prize.<eos> One way or another, yes, I will.
I will be fine.<eos> I'm sure you will be, but i'm not sure he will be.<eos> So... i... am coming with you.<eos> The deviates will not like you.<eos> Oh, nope, they will.
- Hey, can I hold the money?<eos> - No.<eos> I'm gonna go hide this.<eos> - We'll find it.<eos> - Yeah, we will.
You just wait till she comes back, though.<eos> She's not gonna come back, grandma.<eos> Well...<eos> - We'll see.<eos> - Yep. We will.
THEN KNOW THAT, WHEN MING CAST ME OUT FOR BIRTHING A DEVIATE CHILD, HE FORCED ME TO TAKE A BLOOD OATH.<eos> IF I WERE TO EVER SPEAK OF IT TO AURA...<eos> YOU WOULD DIE?<eos> NO.<eos> SHE WILL.
And now everything's going to be fine.<eos> You can keep my secret for me, can't you, baby?<eos> And you'll never tell daddy the truth?<eos> Even if he asks?<eos> No, I won't.
Okay. It is dead.<eos> Your plan worked.<eos> You don't have to sound so surprised about that.<eos> We should really be getting out of here.<eos> We will.
I explained there's nothing to be afraid of.<eos> Did you get the building permit for the new house?<eos> - I'll do it today.<eos> - Don't forget.<eos> I won't.
We have bigger problems than Mrs. Bloom.<eos> Jessi starts back at school today.<eos> I sort of levitated.<eos> - Show me how.<eos> - I will.
And the others, Latnok, they-- they just don't think you're as good as Kyle.<eos> But they're wrong, okay?<eos> You can be better.<eos> See, they don't see your potential, and neither does Kyle.<eos> Or he won't.
So what's going on?<eos> I know you.<eos> You know that guy that hit you?<eos> What if he comes back?<eos> He won't.
I do feel that.<eos> If I promise to take it upon myself to find her a family round here to take her in.<eos> I only want to knows she's not to be handed over to the authorities.<eos> - And if you can't find a family?<eos> - I will.
Robert!<eos> There's a noise.<eos> Someone's downstairs.<eos> I want my ma.<eos> You will, kitten.
There's a noise.<eos> Someone's downstairs.<eos> I want my ma.<eos> You will, kitten.<eos> You will.
And when he wakes up and starts bitching to anybody who will listen, it's gonna look pretty fucking dismal for us.<eos> We dump him outside.<eos> There's no connection.<eos> And what if nobody finds him?<eos> - No, they will.
And with our new boss at work, and this Chuck and Jill thing is like:<eos> - What Chuck and Jill thing?<eos> - Hmm? Jill thing? I didn't say...<eos> - You tell me everything that you know.<eos> - Mm-hm, absolutely, I will.
Then you used him to try to kill me<eos> Because to you...<eos> I'm nothing but a monster.<eos> He doesn't see our humanity, claire.<eos> He never will.
He wants it back. It's normal.<eos> I'm talking about you.<eos> You'll take what you put in and I'll never see you again.<eos> I'll come to Gramsh.<eos> No, you won't.
I'll be fine<eos> It took me only three days to cure you the last time<eos> Your country needs you now.<eos> Wait for me<eos> I will...
Wait, my address.<eos> I know where you live.<eos> Right.<eos> Tell Jessi... I'm looking forward to meeting her.<eos> I will.
Ciao.<eos> Easy with the meds mum I'm just going to England<eos> That's for bellyaches.<eos> Will you remember ?<eos> I will
Well, I'm off to the store to check they're out of oil.<eos> If not, I'll make you drink some!<eos> Sure! You're going to the bar!<eos> Shut up, woman!<eos> No, I won't!
You are a little too sure of yourself.<eos> One only has to look at the embroidery to see IT holds the key to this mystery, so I shall have the Misses Pratt examine it.<eos> Why don't I find out about Wigmore, and you pursue the meaning of the panel?<eos> Then we will see.<eos> We will.
Yeah, but dad didn't.<eos> Look, I-I know my limits.<eos> Ten years ago, I made a bad decision,<eos> - and I'm not doing it again.<eos> - You won't.
Get out while you can.<eos> We don't want out.<eos> Judge Tate is not gonna insert herself into a school matter.<eos> Consider Mr. Michael's testimony.<eos> Judge Tate certainly will.
Everyone needs secretaries.<eos> Soon as I'm earning, we'll get a proper place.<eos> just you wait, Mum.<eos> What if it never gets better?<eos> Course it will.
Can be terrifying, brilliant and funny... sometimes all at the same time.<eos> I've seen some amazing things though.<eos> Whole new worlds.<eos> Oh, I'd love to see new worlds.<eos> You will.
All the pain that filled it.<eos> I just don't know if I can face that every day.<eos> It won't stay like that.<eos> She'll help you.<eos> We both will.
Sure, be right down, boss.<eos> Abby's lab.<eos> I've barely had a chance to finish unpacking this stuff, let alone processing it.<eos> I don't have anything for you.<eos> - You will.
Abby's lab.<eos> I've barely had a chance to finish unpacking this stuff, let alone processing it.<eos> I don't have anything for you.<eos> - You will.<eos> - I will.
But if she did agree to go out with me...<eos> -... you'dbeokaywiththat ?<eos> -But she won't.<eos> -But if she did? She might.<eos> -She won't. She won't.
It's the scale of it, Donna. I mean, how can one man stop all that?<eos> Trust me.<eos> He can do it.<eos> Yeah, well, if he doesn't, you tell him he'll have to answer to me.<eos> I will.
It'll probably take awhile for him to show affection and he'll want to know why you never came to get him.<eos> Children believe their parents can do anything.<eos> So, saying you couldn't find him or you tried everything, just may not be enough.<eos> Just be patient, Ms. Tanner.<eos> I will.
Sara. This is a good thing.<eos> You made me mortal.<eos> Only to lose you.<eos> We should have had more time.<eos> We will.
Marly!<eos> chriE. Stin.<eos> I've taken their crap for three years,richard. For three years.<eos> You didn't stop taking that cream.<eos> No,and I never will.
Julian, you're not a freak.<eos> Please, Julian, we've got to talk about this.<eos> This is totally normal, but we can't make it better if you run away from me.<eos> I don't want to lose you.<eos> No, you won't.
Well, the important thing is that you're here.<eos> Well, that's one theory.<eos> Can i get you a scotch, joyce?<eos> Are you having one? I'm having two.<eos> Well, then i will as well.
It's ok.<eos> I got to do this.<eos> You have to tell him that i didn't do anything with those other guys.<eos> I never did. I never did.<eos> I will.
You're under oath as a material witness, ms. Montenegro.<eos> I swore to tell the truth, and the truth is that I am not saying anything.<eos> judge haddoes, could you...<eos> - The witness will answer.<eos> - No, the witness will not.
Folks like us there ain't no happy ending.<eos> We all got it coming.<eos> Well, ain't you a bucket of sunshine.<eos> I'm what you've got to look forward to if you survive.<eos> Which you won't.
But I can recommend the fried apple pie, the frozen Hawaiian pie, the chocolate pecan praline pie, the chess pie, the seven-layer Jell-O pie...<eos> They'll have the peanut butter pie and the Spunky Hollow honey pineapple pie,<eos> - please, Harley?<eos> - Gotcha, Buster.<eos> We will?
Thanks, Dr. Bruen.<eos> What if they find something wrong?<eos> They won't.<eos> - I wanna have our baby.<eos> - And you will.
That's it for me.<eos> Thanks for the drinks.<eos> Thanks for your help.<eos> Think about what I told ya.<eos> I will.
Yet you plan to meet her at her hotel.<eos> Correct again.<eos> I do not understand.<eos> One day, kitt.<eos> One day you will.
Double-fisting tonight, huh?<eos> Just single-fisting.<eos> I mean, I'm single. Just an FYI.<eos> I hope to see you around.<eos> You will.
Besides, you're the politician.<eos> You decide how to run your campaign.<eos> Hire who you want, target the areas you want focus on the issues you want.<eos> Just don't lose.<eos> I won't.
That's only one part of the equation.<eos> The other math goes like this.<eos> Vic takes down someone who's done worse deeds than him it balances accounts for Terry. In that big old box of sins God keeps on all of us.<eos> I don't believe in God.<eos> Oh, you will.
I just have to get up.<eos> They're on fire.<eos> They're full of ants.<eos> If you move. You will die.<eos> We all will.
How do you understand that?<eos> You and I talk about it a lot.<eos> We do?<eos> We do.<eos> We will.
Listen, if he is who you say he is, then he deserves whatever is gonna happen to him in that room, but not until he tells us who he is and what he's doing here.<eos> Do you understand?<eos> - He is who I say he is.<eos> - I want to hear him say it.<eos> He will.
Sorry, sorry.<eos> Where are you going?<eos> Martha, come back here!<eos> Martha, you don't know what you're doing.<eos> I won't!
With all due respect, that's not good enough.<eos> Now, I've been trained for a lot:<eos> Hostage crises, terror campaigns suicide bombers, chemical attacks but the things I've seen since I started working for you...<eos> If I'm gonna do this job, I need to know what it is I'm dealing with.<eos> And you will.
Why don't you have a seat?<eos> Okay?<eos> So, what do you think about?<eos> If I tell you, you'll hate me.<eos> Everybody will.
If we could show the court that Kathleen is predisposed to BPD, then the judge might consider alternative sentencing.<eos> Right. Psychiatric treatment instead of jail.<eos> Yes.<eos> But it will only happen if Kathleen admits she's sick.<eos> She won't.
Right. Psychiatric treatment instead of jail.<eos> Yes.<eos> But it will only happen if Kathleen admits she's sick.<eos> She won't.<eos> She won't.
- What are you talking about?<eos> - Well, the normal operating procedure would be to leave a few crew members awake so that they could monitor the pods and bring the others out when it's time, but since they all went in,<eos> I would assume there'd be some kind of an automatic or timed shut-down protocol, but I can't find one.<eos> So if we do not wake them...<eos> Then they never will.
And we'll be stuck with this other woman in Keller's body?<eos> - We need to get moving.<eos> - Agreed.<eos> Do we know which planet this device is on?<eos> We will.
You want me to read this to you ?<eos> Just skip to the part where the prince and the princess live happily ever after.<eos> Dean...<eos> So ?<eos> Will you ?
If she didn't let them in, then my sister wasn't really dead.<eos> This man is a monster, and we can catch him. But we need your daughter's help.<eos> - If you accuse her of anything...<eos> - Ma'am- i will be on the phone so fast...<eos> - Ma'am, ma'am, we won't.
But I was so mean to you.<eos> And you were just a kid.<eos> You were a kid, too.<eos> Will you tell him I love him and forgive him?<eos> I will.
Sure.<eos> I know you weren't thinking right when you did what you did.<eos> Be good to Aunt Jo.<eos> Don't leave your clothes everywhere and be respectful, okay?<eos> I will.
Shut up.<eos> Listen... i'll go to the police and i'll tell them that i killed him.<eos> I'll say he broke into the house while you were out.<eos> - it won't work.<eos> - yes, it will.
We'll find him.<eos> You and me?<eos> You and me, Eric.<eos> This never ends, does it?<eos> And it never will.
You don't have to close tonight.<eos> I can do it.<eos> You look tired.<eos> No, it's... it's my turn.<eos> I'll...
Is my car still out back or did you move that, too?<eos> It's still there.<eos> Please don't say anything.<eos> To Jax.<eos> I won't.
We can't take another day of this.<eos> Another night.<eos> We didn't sleep.<eos> We just want everything back the way it was.<eos> So will you?
Another night.<eos> We didn't sleep.<eos> We just want everything back the way it was.<eos> So will you?<eos> Will you?

And if your beloved ever pulls a nasty trick on you, like, say, drugging you into a stupor, then the balance of power shifts to you.<eos> And then you can demand they prove their love by, say, undergoing surgery.<eos> - Do you understand?<eos> - Not really.<eos> You will.
When I Was Clearing Out My Office,<eos> I Accidentally Opened Up A Piece Of Daniel's Mail.<eos> Well, Darling, Given What We're Dealing With Here,<eos> I Think Daniel's Going To Overlook That One.<eos> No, He Won't.
How was breakfast?<eos> - So damn good.<eos> - Good.<eos> Hey, will you remind Quentin that he's got a tutoring session after practice today?<eos> - Yeah, I will.
You can help me out, Charlie, but we're not going to put Green<eos> - Man into anything.<eos> - Well, we'll see about that.<eos> - We'll see about that.<eos> - Well, we will.
( laughing ) Nah.<eos> I just... I just had this party I was supposed to go to, but... you know, I guess I can skip that.<eos> All right, cool.<eos> We'll see you there.<eos> Not at midnight you won't.
I cannot believe that Nate Archibald is a gigolo.<eos> You cannot tell anyone, remember?<eos> Hey, who would I tell?<eos> Who would I tell except everyone I've ever met?<eos> I won't.

You beg for your life, and just maybe I'll set you free.<eos> No.<eos> I'm not crawling anymore.<eos> Not even for you.<eos> And pretty soon, no one else will either.

- Comrade Doctor!<eos> We're not here to argue over who's more concerned for the people.<eos> The issue is whether you will retract your statement or not. That's it.<eos> I will not.<eos> You will not?
You can Finally here more 'late.<eos> And not 'what for you signed, right?<eos> I do not Andro 'now.<eos> If you're worried that I you think that the six date a raised legs when I was more 'need you... well, I do not think '.<eos> Si ', it will.

Both sharper blades than any that had cut me before.<eos> I have something of yours.<eos> I've kept it on me every day.<eos> Then do not part with it now.<eos> As I will not with you.
Just preach it like you did in court.<eos> You'll be fine.<eos> they came for a sermon, reverend.<eos> I just thought... everybody'd come around?<eos> - They will.
We're not letting you have surgery because you want to die with Jeremy.<eos> If I go home, I die.<eos> I die in a few weeks, a few days.<eos> I don't want to lose you.<eos> Mom, you won't.
- She's a reporter, Carter.<eos> No, nothing she'd repeat.<eos> - Let me buy you a drink.<eos> - I don't drink.<eos> You will.
Red, behind you.<eos> You may have mused in the past, "Am I mortal?"<eos> You are now.<eos> Abraham, many people have died for this crown.<eos> He will, too.
- I want you.<eos> Do you know where she is?<eos> No. Europe, I think.<eos> What if she comes back?<eos> She won't.

They are orders that must be executed, entrusted to us so that we might forge stability out of chaos.<eos> This one is yours.<eos> I don't...<eos> Look, I thought you brought me here to kill Cross.<eos> You will. In time.
But, Hyung. Will everything be alright for you?<eos> Yes.<eos> Don't worry about me and study hard.<eos> Do not forget your promise.<eos> I won't, Hyung.

Okay, dry your tears and go on to class.<eos> - Yes, ma'am.<eos> Oh, I'm just sorry to take over, but I know these children pretty well.<eos> I understand.<eos> - You will soon enough.
How far out are you?<eos> Maybe five minutes.<eos> Jack, don't let them take my kids.<eos> Don't let them take the children.<eos> Carl, I won't. Everybody!
Father.<eos> It's nice to see you on time for once. Mm-hmm.<eos> How are you holding up?<eos> It still doesn't feel quite real.<eos> It will soon enough.
No choice.<eos> Never had the chance to fight for them.<eos> You do.<eos> Don't stop.<eos> I won't.
You ready?<eos> - No.<eos> No.<eos> - Take your time.<eos> - I will.
Here.<eos> I wanna marry you because you're the first person that I want to look at when I wake up in the morning and the only one I wanna kiss goodnight.<eos> Because the first time that I saw these hands, I couldn't imagine not being able to hold them.<eos> But mainly, when you love someone as much as I love you getting married is the only thing left to do.<eos> So will you...
And 10 years ago, I got in bed with the wrong girl.<eos> She turned out to be the right one.<eos> I love you, Hannah.<eos> I always have.<eos> And I always will.
If you still plan to come to France,<eos> I'll leave my number.<eos> That's nice. Thanks.<eos> Call me if you come.<eos> I will.
The only problem is we can't get our wine there without your help.<eos> See, I'm only allowed to carry on one bottle of wine, and I brought twenty-f- uh, 26 bottles of wine back to Paris without them being shaken or bumped around.<eos> Will anybody carry a bottle for me?<eos> I'll take one.<eos> And so will my husband.
Please. - I'm going with her.<eos> - Okay, get in the car.<eos> Can he come with me?<eos> - Don't leave me. Don't leave me.<eos> - I won't.

Who?<eos> The Greeks.<eos> Dimitri left them a copy of the map before we left.<eos> Yeah, and what if they decide not to come, Jeff?<eos> Then somebody else will.
Who were the others?<eos> On Friday, when you return... alone, we shall begin your initiation.<eos> I'm not sure I can afford to come back.<eos> Don't worry, Symonds.<eos> This will...
That's the beauty.<eos> –The arraignment is when?<eos> –10:00.<eos> I'll go with you.<eos> No, you won't.
I will go after you if you have broken the law.<eos> Your honor, this law is about imposing a morality.<eos> What's more, it doesn't work.<eos> Prostitution exists.<eos> It always will.
When a tumor like that gets to be problematic it's gonna come with a lot of symptoms.<eos> Loss of short-term memory problems with your depth perception, with your motor skills.<eos> - Lf you had that, you'd let me know?<eos> - Yes, but I haven't.<eos> And I won't.
You were mean and stubborn and just... a bastard.<eos> You were.<eos> But you were a bastard who knew what you wanted.<eos> And you stuck to your guns and proved that if you want something badly enough, if you're... determined enough and patient enough, eventually it will happen.<eos> It will.
No, one.<eos> Then you pull her off me.<eos> You slept with O'Malley?<eos> You said you wouldn't say anything.<eos> I won't.

You have a lot to do still, what with having to look after these other two missing girls.<eos> Why don't I take Roger off your hands? Have Robbery /Homicide book him.<eos> I don't see how that's gonna help me.<eos> Oh, it will.<eos> It will.
That's me.<eos> Go get the money.<eos> Leave the bag. Go get the money. Now.<eos> I'll be right back. That's right.<eos> You will.
My mom's been working really hard, but... we still had to make some sacrifices.<eos> The car and the piano were mine.<eos> You two are in it together.<eos> Which is nice, but... it would be nicer if I knew things were gonna get better soon.<eos> It will.
Stephen's finally ready to listen and I'm letting him down.<eos> When my dad was alive, we used to sit in the gardens at Lancaster Park and talk for hours.<eos> He always told me I could do anything if I just believed.<eos> But what if I fail?<eos> You won't.
Not here.<eos> They won't let us be.<eos> Then we'll get away.<eos> Yes, we can.<eos> We will.
Maybe even hurt my family.<eos> How... how do you know that?<eos> I just know.<eos> I - I don't even know your name.<eos> You will.
It's not weird.<eos> - Yes, it feels weird.<eos> Listen, you're like my best friend, ok?<eos> I really don't want things to change.<eos> And they won't!
Why The Hell Would You Tell Janelle?<eos> She's Gonna Find Out.<eos> How?<eos> I Don't Know How.<eos> She Just Will.

They sound kind of like heroes to me.<eos> Well, heroes don't have people killed, They don't consume the personalities of innocent men and women.<eos> I don't know exactly what The Marked are up to. I haven't seen the movie.<eos> You never will now.<eos> No one will.
You...<eos> You're okay.<eos> People need to know what he did to my dad.<eos> People need to know the truth.<eos> They will.
- Do you remember Dr Suresh?<eos> He is working really hard to find me a cure.<eos> And, when he does, I'll get better.<eos> - Yeah, but what if he doesn't?<eos> - He will.

If Morgan is Coraline-- And I'm not saying she is-- if--<eos> And she realizes that you suspect her, I don't know what she'll do.<eos> I'll be careful.<eos> But one way or another, I will finally find out the truth.<eos> We both will.

It's not your hands i worry about.<eos> You ought to change your name to lucky.<eos> Thank whatever god you got.<eos> You're outta here.<eos> I will.
- Not gonna happen.<eos> He is off limits.<eos> I just want to hear his side of it.<eos> Adrian Monk just shot Santa Claus. People are gonna want to know why.<eos> And they will. Just not today.
I didn't take any tape. Your number was deleted from Nanna's cell.<eos> - Am I a suspect?<eos> Is that it? - Who were you with?<eos> - Won't you tell us?<eos> - The hell I will.
What a coincidence.<eos> I'm tired of hearing about it.<eos> Linda's smart, Linda's sophisticated, Linda's successful.<eos> - Linda doesn't like you.<eos> - She will.

Honey, I didn't even know you were home.<eos> Sorry, I just got in.<eos> Before I left, we got a huge delivery that I had to inventory.<eos> Come on, come on up to bed.<eos> I will.
Remove the artifact.<eos> What?<eos> I can't... what...<eos> I'll die if I open myself up like that.<eos> You won't.
They lynch them. They put them in prison cells that are like graves.<eos> - You tell it.<eos> - Good job, Mom.<eos> I'm asking you, please, help my son.<eos> - We will.
No way. - I love you.<eos> There's so many things I wish I could ask you. Excuse me.<eos> Time travel now, questions later.<eos> Just get back to that science fair, and we'll see you real soon.<eos> Oh, right. Right, okay, I will.

# Traveling many a mile<eos> # Papa, Papa<eos> # Has you brought gold # For to pay this hangman's fee<eos> # Or did you come to see me swinging # High from this hangman's tree<eos> Of course they will.
Really?<eos> Yeah, I'll take a cab home.<eos> Okay.<eos> Be safe.<eos> I will.

Testament.<eos> Promise at all.<eos> I need to show Jasna to grandpa.<eos> What if she don't want?<eos> She will, she will.

You got a sec?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Come on in.<eos> It won't be stealing. We'll leave some money, eh?<eos> Rather you will.
Ethel Ann, do you take this man, Teddy, to be your lawful-wedded husband?<eos> I do.<eos> I'll be yours till the day I die.<eos> You better do whatever you're gonna do with that ring.<eos> Jack, will you?
In a thousand years, they'll be barbecued and their souls will be in squirrels.<eos> You weren't Jesus!<eos> Oh, Edith.<eos> If...it rains...<eos> It won't.

Can't you see she is using you?<eos> She's using you.<eos> She doesn't love you.<eos> She never has.<eos> And she never will.
Madame, I cannot wait.<eos> I am, as you say, a spoiled child.<eos> When I want what we speak of, I will have it.<eos> You will have it?<eos> I will.
Stupendous. It's stupendous, darling.<eos> Your first play.<eos> Do you think so?<eos> Do you think Leon will like it?<eos> Well, of course he will.
I really wish you, um, wouldn't say it.<eos> You're afraid of the word?<eos> Yeah, for some reason, I think that saying it might... Make it happen.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - It won't.
- They stand up to tyranny.<eos> - I told you.<eos> We don't have their courage.<eos> - Sorry about this.<eos> - And we never will.
I'm not in the mood.<eos> - Bullshit.<eos> You don't go to the pub anymore.<eos> Everyone should have at least one sin.<eos> Maybe I will.
What are you doing here?<eos> How are you?<eos> OK, fine.<eos> You won't start crying?<eos> No, I won't.
The light quivering modestly in the morning.<eos> Dic nobis Maria quid vidisti in via?<eos> When are you coming back?<eos> When are you coming back?<eos> I won't.
- He's an Arab.<eos> - He's a cook!<eos> - A German cook wouldn't have this problem.<eos> - l don't know what he's accused of.<eos> - You never will.
You're dead inside and everybody knows it!<eos> What are you doing?<eos> I'm leaving for San Francisco, tomorrow, alone.<eos> No, just wait wait until after the hearing and I'll come with you.<eos> No, you won't.
I know I did the right thing.<eos> Then tell them.<eos> I don't want you to have any regrets, Tom.<eos> Not because of me.<eos> No, honey, I won't.
She laughs.<eos> "It is not possible.<eos> -If it is always possible.<eos> Just want, and things happen.<eos> Not always, as you will.
Who's got so much, he won't even miss it.<eos> He won't give you a thing.<eos> Why do you say that?<eos> He won't give you anything, that's all.<eos> He will! Of course, he will.
You don't have to say anything.<eos> I mean, I've come to grips with my situation.<eos> And besides, I've got a new four-legged friend.<eos> Just promise you'll be careful out there.<eos> I will.
The fact is... Checkers isn't a blue-blooded thoroughbred.<eos> But that's why he's so special.<eos> He won't be judged fairly.<eos> - Well, they have to at least give him a shot.<eos> - They won't.
- No man. - That's why you... can't get reckless.<eos> You hear me?<eos> I'm gonna need your help to finish this thing.<eos> I can't lose you, too, Shane.<eos> You won't.
I will be king.<eos> If I can count on your support, you can count on me.<eos> - How do you know that he will come?<eos> - He will, I am sure.<eos> He will.
- Yes.<eos> She's with Hope.<eos> Faith's coming.<eos> She'll be here any second.<eos> No, she won't.
Here, get rid of all the high-end brand alcohol.<eos> Go generic. It'll save us a ton.<eos> You know what, why don't we go the complete opposite way and make us a ton?<eos> I don't follow.<eos> You will.
And then forgive yourself for surviving.<eos> Good.<eos> Good.<eos> I just pray to God that you remember this.<eos> I will.
Please, Lord, hear our prayer.<eos> Mary-Elizabeth Martino, will you dedicate your life to finding your child, and properly raise him following the teachings of Christ ?<eos> I will.<eos> When you find the demon's child, do you swear before God and His son Jesus-Christ, to protect the baby from all evil, keeping him safe within the support and the protection of the Holy Church ?<eos> I will.
Cam, we have to face the fact that I am going to die here.<eos> No, I don't have to face that fact, because I am not going to let it happen.<eos> I appreciate that.<eos> But the truth is, even if you manage to create a distraction and destroy the device, you are never going to get me to the gate by yourself.<eos> - Yes, I will.
No.<eos> Okay, but listen to that Fela CD.<eos> That will help you.<eos> - I promise.<eos> - I will.
Okay, but listen to that Fela CD.<eos> That will help you.<eos> - I promise.<eos> - I will.<eos> I will.
We're all pretty career-driven.<eos> You have your own business, you must understand that.<eos> You focus fully on one thing, other things disappear... cooking at home, lazy Sundays, sex.<eos> There's not much time.<eos> Not much will, either.
- The fucking worker !<eos> - Yeah, the fucking worker...<eos> Are you having a can, Josie ?<eos> Do.<eos> I will so, I will, thanks.
For over a year. I've lived here... alone.<eos> - So we've come too late?<eos> - Most likely.<eos> Search somewhere else.<eos> We certainly will.
Do you know who did this?<eos> Yes.<eos> My father says they are cowards.<eos> They must pay with their lives.<eos> They will.
Come to me, sweetheart.<eos> What are you looking at?<eos> Keep your eyes to yourself.<eos> I wish you weren't going.<eos> Maybe we won't.
Boss, I know where Hyde went on the express elevator floor 1-13 only there is no floor 1-13.<eos> How he accessed it?<eos> No idea.<eos> For what reason, don't know.<eos> But I will.
I hope you don't blame yourselves.<eos> And don't be strangers.<eos> I'm tired of the lies, Cliff.<eos> I can't do this anymore.<eos> I won't.
Just go with the detective.<eos> Answer his questions.<eos> Don't panic.<eos> - What if those men call?<eos> - They won't.
Sit.<eos> I thought I could practice here but it's not so easy.<eos> I have to pass four exams and with my English, really....<eos> But they say I can keep testing until I pass.<eos> You will.
NOTHING BEATS A LIVE TESTIMONIAL.<eos> IT'S LIKE I ALWAYS SAY-- IF YOU CAN'T DELIVER THE BACON,<eos> BRING 'EM THE PIG.<eos> YOU ALWAYS SAY THAT?<eos> WELL, I WILL FROM NOW ON.
Just not to me.<eos> She'll come around.<eos> Give her time.<eos> What if she doesn't?<eos> She will.
If it's a matter of expenses, we can talk about that later, if you get my drift.<eos> We're not putting anything on paper of course, but uh... give it some thought, I appreciate it.<eos> Good news!<eos> Uh, I got a call from Mom and she will be in Colorado Springs on Friday.<eos> - She will!
30.<eos> And you've never seen an after school special, Dawson's Creek?<eos> How do you get to 30 and not know about condoms?<eos> Oh, god, I-I have an STD.<eos> No, but you will.
But I haven't been able to come in there, because... you know...<eos> Come in and eat.<eos> - Really?<eos> - Yeah...<eos> All right, I will.
It does not matter.<eos> Well, we think it does.<eos> Your fate is sealed!<eos> If you have any reason to suspect that I am not myself, do not hesitate to use that.<eos> I won't.
How ya doin', boy?<eos> Ooh, nice tie.<eos> Notice how Bob gets all the attention and we're just the appendages who happen to be nearby.<eos> Oh, don't forget your donation for the silent auction.<eos> Oh, I won't.
I think I found a way to stop him.<eos> - I found him.<eos> - Sylar?<eos> - I thought you had Sylar.<eos> - I will again.
Then take me to jail.<eos> You know, call me a killer... a murderer, whatever,<eos> but don't tell me I have a mother... because I don't.<eos> I never did.<eos> And I never will.
In fact, there's a lot of evidence to the contrary.<eos> All I'm asking is that you consider that before saying yes to this offer.<eos> That's all.<eos> Fine.<eos> I will.
Then I think Wisteria Lane is the place for you.<eos> Good.<eos> More than anything, I just want to fit in.<eos> Oh, you will, Alma.<eos> You absolutely will.
This won't blind any queens, to be sure, but still, it has the sparkle of life.<eos> I'll take it.<eos> I'm... sorry?<eos> It's perfect. I'll take it.<eos> No, you won't.
And here I thought you hatred was just professional jealousy.<eos> Who knew you were covering such a scandalous secret ?<eos> You're actually gonna stake your reputation on this tabloid garbage that's not even fit for the Inquisitor ?<eos> Nobody's gonna believe you.<eos> Of course they will.
–Right. Shh...<eos> Denny's going to get a jump on some... research.<eos> Dr Follette, when doctors induce a patient's death, they tend to say they're managing pain.<eos> I understand that.<eos> No doubt a jury will.
Life took on a whole new perspective.<eos> I'm gonna call the lab and see what's taking so long.<eos> Just relax.<eos> I will try to relax.<eos> I will.
The transport buses are starting to arrive.<eos> Good.<eos> By the time my jailed brothers are boarded on the aircraft, it will be too late for the Americans to realize what's happened.<eos> We still don't have the component.<eos> We will.
Anyone wake up with their clothes on from the night before, still drunk but strangely hung-over?<eos> Anyone?<eos> Well, I guess that was just me.<eos> Actually, last night was UNO night at my house and it was a bloodbath, but I care not to discuss it with you right now.<eos> So, we won't.
Gray!<eos> I didn't come here to listen to your stories.<eos> I'm serious.<eos> I need to find Dad.<eos> Okay, we will.
I want you to send two field units to 5137 Olson Avenue, in Simi Valley.<eos> It should be off the 23.<eos> I want them to wait for me there.<eos> Get Bill to call me back as soon as he's out of the briefing.<eos> Okay, I will.
Son of a bitch!<eos> A nuclear bomb just went off, like, 25 miles from here.<eos> When I'm done with this deal, I may just buy you a small country.<eos> - Have you found an engineer? - I told you I would.<eos> Now I will.
- I had to make him think I cracked.<eos> But I kept you out of it.<eos> It's gonna get a lot worse.<eos> He's not finished. He knows you didn't tell him everything.<eos> Yeah, and I won't.
Right now, the best way... the only way... to do that is to let you go.<eos> I hope one day you can understand that.<eos> I hope one day you can forgive me.<eos> I love you with all my heart.<eos> I always will.
We'll take you to him.<eos> Come on.<eos> He's in that house right there.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> You will.
Looks like you got clean.<eos> I tried so many times.<eos> But if addiction was a battle,rehab was war.<eos> I'll get clean,Maddy.<eos> This time I will.
Him just in his pants.<eos> No-one laughed.<eos> Best day of my life.<eos> Look, don't, um, don't tell the others, yeah, about...<eos> No, I won't.
- I'm really sorry. I've got to go.<eos> Do you?<eos> Kiss me again.<eos> No, Sid.<eos> I won't.
We won't need the Cylons to destroy us, we'll destroy ourselves.<eos> The fleet that arrives at Earth will not represent Colonial society at all.<eos> I am willing to fight for that society until my dying breath.<eos> I would love it if you would fight for that society as well.<eos> I will.
The fleet that arrives at Earth will not represent Colonial society at all.<eos> I am willing to fight for that society until my dying breath.<eos> I would love it if you would fight for that society as well.<eos> I will.<eos> I will, Madam President. I will.
Yeah.<eos> You gentlemen have a problem.<eos> The blood is definitely human.<eos> I will take a polygraph. I don't know anything about that.<eos> I will, too.
He'll be fine.<eos> My point is, Suicide is hardly the act of a happily married man.<eos> Gloria, for God sake, give it up.<eos> He doesn't love me.<eos> He will, dear.
It was spur of the moment.<eos> I slipped on something.<eos> I wanted to marry her.<eos> She never even knew.<eos> She will now.
- Its a little sketch that could.<eos> - What do you mean?<eos> That we've been trying to get it on for 6 weeks and we get it this far and it keeps getting cut, but despite the rejection, we keep working on it.<eos> - It is a little sketch that could.<eos> - And if will!

Guv, this doesn't make sense.<eos> What part of "will explode in 15 minutes" are you finding hard to grasp?<eos> It can't be the IRA.<eos> They don't use dynamite.<eos> They never will.
Is that what they deserve, Frank?<eos> How old is your boy?<eos> He's ten.<eos> How is a ten-year-old ever gonna understand what you're doing, Frank?<eos> He won't.
I'M JUST SAYIN'.<eos> GOOD JOB, SQUATCH.<eos> HERE, YOU MAY NOT HAVE SOME CAVIAR.<eos> I DON'T WANT ANY STUPID CAVIAR, HIAWATHA.<eos> YOU WILL. MMM!
You're saying it like they are!<eos> Ooh, they are.<eos> I am such a terrible liar.<eos> Look, Christina, you have to promise me. You can't tell anybody.<eos> Of course I won't.
And, uh, this is for the birthday girl.<eos> - A tongue scraper. - Oh.<eos> That's what that is.<eos> So many people forget about the tongue.<eos> Well, now I won't.
One of Péidin's people buried in the Fifteen Shilling Plot!<eos> Clear out of here, you slovenly bitch or I'll tell you in front of the graveyard who you are.<eos> I raised your father since all he could get at home was potatoes and salted milk.<eos> You still haven't a cross as fine as Néra Sheéinin's!<eos> But I will, you slovenly bitch, a cross of island limestone.
There's something much worse than<eos> Len Grady out there.<eos> Only he knows what it is.<eos> We've got to push Grady harder to tell us what he knows.<eos> He won't.
- What about?<eos> - He just said you should be here.<eos> He's to be taken to task by the commissioner.<eos> I'm not taking the fall with you.<eos> I just won't.
Don't tell anybody about that, okay?<eos> 'Cause I'm not proud of it.<eos> - Oh, I won't tell anyone.<eos> - You'd better not.<eos> I won't.
Lily is gonna kill me!<eos> Look at me!<eos> She's not gonna want to marry me like this.<eos> That's crazy.<eos> Of course she will.
He kissed me.<eos> I can't believe he's lying about it.<eos> Okay, I'll be right back.<eos> - Don't say anything to Joe.<eos> - I won't.
Take Kateryna instead.<eos> Blonde,beautiful, doesn't complain.<eos> I want Lena.<eos> Everybody left her,but not me.<eos> - I won't.
- I gotta see the movie.<eos> - Not gonna happen.<eos> Walsh won't even let Rubinstein see it.<eos> He understands that at some point everyone's gonna need to see it, right?<eos> At some point, everyone will.
And it's not his only ability.<eos> And when he hit me...<eos> Chloe, I haven't felt anything like that since I went up against Titan.<eos> - Clark, we need to find Lois before Wes...<eos> - We will.
Dad, I'm going with you.<eos> Oh, sure, you're part of the family when we're going to a banquet honoring minorities in America.<eos> - Hosted by Denzel Washington.<eos> - Thank you, Steve.<eos> But you won't even...
–It was good.<eos> –So stop sulking.<eos> –I'm not sulking.<eos> Well, don't even come over if you're gonna be like that.<eos> Maybe I won't then.
- No, sir.<eos> - Don't ever grab that phone again.<eos> - Yes, sir.<eos> - Know your place, corporal.<eos> - I will, sir.
He's so great.<eos> I'm so sorry I didn't make the appointment.<eos> I promise you I will never, ever, ever miss another appointment ever as long he's around ever.<eos> Be careful.<eos> I will.
My signal has been playing for the last 16 years and nobody has heard it.<eos> - What makes you think you'll have luck?<eos> - Naomi's boat is 80 miles offshore.<eos> I know if we eliminate Danielle's signal, they'll hear us.<eos> No, they won't.
You know, that's all ancient history.<eos> But they've been finding some damn strange stuff... down in that hole... in the last couple of weeks.<eos> Carvings and such.<eos> I think... something came out of that mine. Something that... never died.<eos> And never will.
But getting his buyers is even better.<eos> If they realise he's been grabbed, they'll disappear.<eos> I'm sorry, what are you saying?<eos> No matter how we grab Davian, his clients are gonna know he's been taken.<eos> No, they won't.
No, it's just...<eos> That.<eos> How about I promise... that I will call you later?<eos> - You better call me later.<eos> - I will.
Hey, we're going now.<eos> Bye-bye, bye-bye.<eos> Bye-bye.<eos> Hey, don't forget the forest and the boat, eh?<eos> Okay, I won't.
I, too, am on a very important case, inspector.<eos> So you understand what I mean when I say no one must know that I am here.<eos> I have just slipped my cell-phone number into your pocket.<eos> Call me if you need any help.<eos> I will, inspector.
How about breaking and entering?<eos> By the looks of this, a little assault as well.<eos> Thank you, Thomas.<eos> - This can't go any farther.<eos> - It won't, Sister.
I want my children to have a chance.<eos> You think you're so smart!<eos> You're gonna write a book and have the world on a string, huh?<eos> -Well, what if you don't?<eos> -I will.
I have another customer at 1:30.<eos> I work by appointments.<eos> 1:30.<eos> You won't make it in time.<eos> Yeah I will.
You have to let me go.<eos> But the truck will fall, and we'll both die.<eos> Let me go, or I'll pull this fucking trigger!<eos> - No, you won't. - I swear to God I'll do it!<eos> No, you won't.
What are you doing?<eos> Don't even think about it.<eos> It's not gonna hold us both.<eos> What...<eos> Yes, it will.
Would you rather wipe my ass for me?<eos> ...but there are certain parts of my job, that I'm not gonna be able to talk to you about and I cannot allow you to jeopardise ongoing investigation or your life.<eos> No, really there are things, you don't even wanna know about.<eos> - Ok then just say that.<eos> - All right, I will.
No! I can't believe this. I won't believe it.<eos> - Oh, Wilbur. - It isn't fair!<eos> - I want to live!<eos> I want to see the snow!<eos> - And you will.
-Finish it.<eos> -The--?<eos> -I don't know how it ends.<eos> -You do.<eos> You will.
Will you deliver Spain from bondage?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I'm trying. I don't know how.<eos> You do.<eos> You will.
I'm trying. I don't know how.<eos> You do.<eos> You will.<eos> You do.<eos> You will.
- She's been married off.<eos> Can't we at least wait until she's talking?<eos> If you insist. Come home.<eos> We're having a ball for the soldiers who fought in America.<eos> I will.
Nigel got what he wanted.<eos> And what was that?<eos> Eternity.<eos> You don't get it, do you?<eos> You will. You will.
Come on, Cos, let's go.<eos> Johnny says we're leaving, let's go!<eos> Hey, Johnny, watch this.<eos> Tell Jake we stopped in.<eos> Oh, I will.
Anything you guys throwing away?<eos> - Jesus, Lou...<eos> - Look, I'm asking.<eos> The shit you won't touch, come on.<eos> You will?
Disgusting!<eos> Diwakar's such a gossip monger!<eos> He'll tell the whole world!<eos> To prove him wrong, you'll have to get married!<eos> I will.
Georgia, you're my best friend.<eos> And you always tell me I can do things even when I think I can't.<eos> But I gotta tell you something.<eos> If you want to be a flight attendant, you first gotta ride on a plane.<eos> I will someday.
I dream stuff all the time!<eos> Sometimes it comes true!<eos> Hey, I'm just telling you!<eos> I really think it might happen!<eos> Then maybe it will!
We'll go visit him.<eos> They can't stop us if we want to be together.<eos> They'll never find us.<eos> Do you promise you'll take me with you?<eos> One day I will.
And based on your information, I then threw her out.<eos> - Did she commit suicide?<eos> - No. It was surely murder.<eos> - Do you have a suspect?<eos> - We will soon, Your Highness.
I am here, Bebe!<eos> My son, why are you standing so far off?<eos> Come here.<eos> Come and embrace your Bebe.<eos> Yes, I will.
So I'll see you there.<eos> Here.<eos> You can't go on like this. It's 1 0 miles.<eos> No, I don't wanna spoil it for you guys.<eos> -You won't.
Thanks.<eos> I'm waiting for it to get warm, and I'm gonna come by and take a ride.<eos> Well, anytime you want.<eos> It'll be on the house.<eos> Well, I will, then.
What's that?<eos> Will you marry me?<eos> Now, you don't have to answer now,<eos> Just, you, take your time, but... Promise me you'll think it over.<eos> I will.
As your friend, and as your husband,<eos> And as the father to our baby.<eos> And you know I want that baby, Sue. You know that, right?<eos> Will you marry me?<eos> Yes, I will.
You never know what it's good for.<eos> Let those losers fight it out.<eos> It doesn't get my nipples hard.<eos> We're here now... and we'll see this through.<eos> No, we won't, you fucking cunt!
- I guess I gotta go.<eos> - But... but, Copper...<eos> I'll see you later, OK?<eos> Yeah?<eos> Well, maybe you will and maybe you won't!
They'll ask you questions which you won't be able to answer.<eos> -l can answer anything.<eos> -Yes, but the lies have to be consistent.<eos> -They can't keep changing.<eos> -They won't.
Hey, I've been looking for you.<eos> Baby, what's wrong?<eos> Just fuck off, alright? !<eos> There are some thing you just don't talk about, you know?<eos> I won't, alright?
Emily, your daughter.<eos> Nicolai.<eos> Don't be afraid. Your brother is with us now.<eos> I love all of you.<eos> I always will.
You are asking me to forge the will.<eos> You want a fake will?<eos> If Arjun Bajaj can con my dad and steal what is my birthright...<eos> I can make a fake will to reclaim what is rightfully mine<eos> Jai, yourfather willed everything to Arjun Bajaj intentionally, and after much reflection.
For you?<eos> No, no, no.<eos> Say, l-l... I'm having real bad pains in my chest.<eos> Oh, Is that right?<eos> Well, I'll you what,
What do you want?<eos> Will you grant it?<eos> We are men of honor.<eos> We are not filthy liars.<eos> Of course we will.
I'll leave the fucking force!<eos> Shut the fuck up!<eos> It's not over yet.<eos> We'll get them.<eos> I will!
Uh, well, no.<eos> I'm here because- because I lost my job.<eos> You're here because you lost yourself.<eos> Well, right now I just want to get this job.<eos> You will.
- before he winds up in prison. - Waste of time. Mum!<eos> He's just a little lost!<eos> ***<eos> - Why do you always defend him?<eos> - Because nobody else will!
Overlooking the world.<eos> Imagine when we come down from the mountain.<eos> With this gift of fire?<eos> They'll never understand.<eos> One day they will.
But if you leave me...,<eos> I'm going to die,<eos> I won't be able to live, Simran,<eos> I won't be able to live anymore!<eos> I won't!
No, no.<eos> I do need sacks. But they were a good excuse.<eos> Well, we'll talk another time, Master Muharrem.<eos> Can you send the bill to this address, please?<eos> As God wills, of course.
- Stop yelling at me!<eos> I just think you're being disrespectful.<eos> Well, I just wanted to watch a fucking romantic comedy, Ben!<eos> Please don't tell your dad I said that.<eos> I won't.
- You argued about merchandising?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Warren thought he deserved 70% for the concept, but I think since I did the drawings, I...<eos> - Do you have a publisher?<eos> - No. And now we never will.
So did I, but they can't fire me.<eos> They can just ignore me.<eos> Good-Bye, Jacob.<eos> I'll see you next trip up.<eos> No...you won't.
I was still terrified.<eos> What if this is all wrong?<eos> What if i'm marrying the wrong guy and 10 years from now, I look around and go, - "My god, what was I thinking?"<eos> - Truth?<eos> Some days you probably will.
Anyways.<eos> You gonna have dinner with us?<eos> May be my last fucking meal if apoplexy takes me... off my nervousness.<eos> What if you won?<eos> I won't.
Mr Lumic!<eos> Jackie was just saying thank you, that's very kind of you.<eos> Those ear pods are hand made.<eos> Tell her to take care.<eos> Course I will.
I'm sorry.<eos> What if I go shopping and leave it in the supermarket?<eos> Don't worry, I'll do all the shopping.<eos> I'm afraid I'd mess it up, Luka.<eos> We won't.
Come with me now.<eos> - Who?<eos> - You'll see.<eos> Will you tell Andrea that I had a crush on her, too?<eos> I will.
I don't think she's stable.<eos> Noted.<eos> Do you have her address?<eos> She probably wouldn't want me to give it to you.<eos> So I will.
He hasn't met all of them-- some.<eos> Most.<eos> Well, what's the kid like?<eos> Yeah. You get along?<eos> Oh, well, we will.
Girl come on...<eos> look... look there's gonna be a lot others parties ok?<eos> ... there's gonna be a lot others parties, don't worry ok?<eos> there's gonna be a lot others parties in Los Angeles with Russel Simmons?<eos> Sure there will...
- I know.<eos> Just tell me the truth, Clark.<eos> Do you still love me?<eos> I've always loved you.<eos> And I always will.
When fired into an enemy vessel, the weapon caused explosive decompression in the targeted compartment.<eos> We had thought of that, yes, but if you want to affect a large population simultaneously, an aerosol gas is really the only way to go.<eos> Now we have to figure out a way to get it into your enemies' hive ship.<eos> Yes.<eos> We will.
Look.<eos> I can't begin to understand what you went through.<eos> That's right, you can't. Max...<eos> This has to stop.<eos> It will.
- I will.<eos> - I've got a 10:00. - Okay.<eos> Thanks for coming in.<eos> - Sure. Call if you need anything.<eos> - I will.
- Good.<eos> - Good.<eos> Look, take a break from work later, come visit me.<eos> You gotta eat.<eos> Maybe I will.
And how does he expect to provide for my grandchild?<eos> He's a clown!<eos> He is an artist.<eos> Brigitte, we agreed that the trust fund would be a safety net in case things don't work out.<eos> But they will.
He said if I danced at his club, and was nice to some of his friends-<eos> - If you're spinning me another line-<eos> - Setting you up was my last job.<eos> He said if I did that, he'd let me go.<eos> But he never will, will he?
So there's no longer any reason to put off you and me getting naked.<eos> Charlie, I'd like you to meet my parents.<eos> Hello.<eos> What if Dad says I could stay up to watch it?<eos> He won't.
I hate her, Dad. I swear.<eos> I want to kill her. I hate her.<eos> Fucking Bitch!<eos> I want to go back to Princeton.<eos> You will.
You,my friend,you are a true-blue knight in shining armor.<eos> Thank you so much,carlos.<eos> Uh,wait.<eos> Maybe i can,uh,see you sometime.<eos> Of course you will.
I'm sick of running,man.<eos> I just started to feel normal here.<eos> I started to feel safe.<eos> He said he would never stop looking.<eos> He won't.
Take him out!<eos> Don't save him.<eos> I can't do it.<eos> I couldn't do it.<eos> You will.
- I always am.<eos> All right.<eos> Your husband loves you very much.<eos> I never loved anyone that well.<eos> And now I never will.
No, it's not too late.<eos> He knows that he mistreated you both.<eos> He didn't know how much you loved him.<eos> I still love you, Edward.<eos> I always will.
No, I know my son!<eos> This is absurd!<eos> You can search my home.<eos> You will not find anything!<eos> Actually, they will!
Man: here we are.<eos> The wine list.<eos> I don't know about romeo here, but i'll have a beer.<eos> And you?<eos> I will, too.
I wish that it was me.<eos> I know that's horrible and I know that's selfish, but I watched you rescue Peyton, and you told me you rescued Dan, and sometimes I just wish you could rescue me.<eos> From what? From all of it.<eos> Okay, then.<eos> I will.
I mean, otherwise...<eos> How are we gonna get them back?<eos> Oh, I can take care of that.<eos> Yeah, but how will you know when to take them back to?<eos> Oh, the ring will.
- No way.<eos> - We'll see.<eos> You've never gotten her to come before.<eos> What makes you think she'll come now?<eos> - She won't.
They basically got enough just to pay for the funerals.<eos> However, Rhonda's family won a separate lawsuit with a $2 million payout.<eos> You'll never guess who from.<eos> You're right.<eos> I won't.
Anna's involvement is actually a positive for us.<eos> She's too well-known in the underworld to disappear outright.<eos> We anticipate that she will reveal herself before long.<eos> We will find her.<eos> Yes, we will.
Go find Neela, please.<eos> Okay, Abby, look.<eos> Look for the wire in the oropharynx.<eos> I can't see it.<eos> - You will, you will.
Nothing.<eos> - Anybody try his cell phone? - Oh.<eos> Give Anna her Papa's love.<eos> I will.<eos> I will.
- No wonder Mom ran off. - I'd pay<eos> - my debts and forget Paris!<eos> - But I don't want to forget it!<eos> If we don't show up tomorrow, we lose the job!<eos> We won't!
I'm sorry.<eos> I didn't mean to be like that.<eos> I guess I kind of got caught up in all that popular-crowd stuff.<eos> I won't be mean to you anymore, dad.<eos> Sure you will.
I-I have to sit down.<eos> - I never had it, Steve, butyou can.<eos> - I want it!<eos> - Then take it!<eos> - I will!
- Wormhole is established.<eos> - Of course it is.<eos> Teal'c, I have a collect call from the Pegasus galaxy.<eos> Will you accept the charges?<eos> I will indeed, Colonel Mitchell.
Told him to go where?<eos> Nimmo bay.<eos> The arraignment's at 10:00.<eos> Which I'll handle.<eos> Which you won't.
- It's not your problem!<eos> - I think it's all of our problem!<eos> And for our kids' sake, just think about what I'm saying.<eos> So does larkin know you're here?<eos> No, but she will.
Well, I'll tell you what.<eos> If I hear from him, I'll let you know, okay?<eos> When do you expect to be hearing from him?<eos> I don't know, really.<eos> Maybe I won't.
No, thank you.<eos> Please, doctor, I assure you, this will be very brief.<eos> I'm sorry your husband isn't with us tonight.<eos> - I wanna see my kids.<eos> - You will.
And you with him?<eos> And if I refuse?<eos> People will die.<eos> Will you do me the honor of becoming my wife?<eos> I will.
Will you quit looking at me like that ?<eos> Like what ?<eos> You know like what.<eos> Like we're never gonna see each other again.<eos> We will.
Right. Not as long as you're working out with the Mega-Bitch.<eos> Hey, me and Madison are just friends, alright...<eos> With benefits.<eos> - Does she know that?<eos> - She will.
Not too loud, but enough to wake half of the neighborhood.<eos> Listen...<eos> I want you to bring your paycheck straight home today, you hear me ?<eos> - i want a real Christmas this year.<eos> - of course i will !
Look for understanding someplace else.<eos> In fact,why don't you do us both a favor and just go away?<eos> That's not going to happen.<eos> Fine.<eos> Then I will.
I'm doing what needs to be done.<eos> Does that help you sleep at night?<eos> Eventually, Marshall or Rachel will do what I ask.<eos> No.<eos> They won't.
- I dont understand.<eos> Your people cannot place their future in Lucius hands.<eos> The time has come for you to save yourselves.<eos> We have no hope of defeating these soldiers.<eos> - You will with our help.
But Yankel had it, too.<eos> And my dad, he wrote a letter.<eos> And he might be going away.<eos> And I don't know if he'll ever come back.<eos> - Of course he will.
At the moment, I have different troubles.<eos> Those shipments were your responsability.<eos> And so is Boone, I'll take care of him.<eos> No.<eos> You and Krista will together.
Perhaps I haven't given you the proper respect.<eos> Yeah, throwing me off the building was a little rude.<eos> Yeah, you were trying to kill me, let's not forget.<eos> I haven't.<eos> You will.
I'm sending Krista back.<eos> No!<eos> Use every asset.<eos> If he gets to Domic and he discovers what we've been doing here.<eos> He won't.
Students being treated as sheep, how could that be!<eos> It's just for the... stationery stores to make money.<eos> Sir, I also wish to release an album... and want to donate the entire proceeds to our school.<eos> Shall we talk about this?<eos> We will.
Besides, if the system has screwed you up, you... screw it up too.<eos> Do you know how many defeats this... system has gone through while trying to defeat us?<eos> That's right, sir. What happened?<eos> Mr. Rafet, you have to sign the papers.<eos> Okay, I will.
Shut up!<eos> Why were you pushing there, Abi?<eos> What are you talking about? You were pulling, right?<eos> I told you to wear your glasses on stage!<eos> Well I won't!
- Take care of yourself, Dad.<eos> - I will.<eos> Don't you worry.<eos> - Remember the North Star, Molly.<eos> - I will.
- Oh, my God.<eos> - Will you stay?<eos> What?<eos> Will you stay with me, even knowing that I have herpes?<eos> Yes, I will.
No. No, you've been under a lot of pressure.<eos> The last few days have been tough on you two.<eos> Don't worry about us.<eos> Just get better, okay?<eos> Yeah, I will.
Let me just say one thing.<eos> - He got stamped as a criminal.<eos> - Let Jang answer.<eos> - Pay attention, Kurt.<eos> No, I won't.
- Mr. Magoo?<eos> Oh, gosh, he was a great man.<eos> - Um... an inventor.<eos> - Really?<eos> An entrepreneur, if you will.
Running out of places to look, aren't you?<eos> It doesn't mean we're gonna stop looking.<eos> Oh, no. Not for six more hours.<eos> - Do you want us to fail?<eos> But you will.
I did; suspect's in the house and he's not alone.<eos> You sure?<eos> I heard Paulson's voice.<eos> Let me give you some more money, in case you need it.<eos> I won't.
Well..<eos> Well, find evidence that he was involved in any serious criminal activity and I promise,...<eos> I'll hand him right back to you<eos> Do we have anything yet, Agent Gibbs?<eos> We will.
Well, at... at least we're getting to know each other.<eos> Just so you know... I'm not really into the whole bondage thing.<eos> Well, I hope we get a second date.<eos> I really do.<eos> We will.
Let bygones be bygones.<eos> You pardon me.<eos> I've been unjust to you.<eos> Pardon me for Christ's sake.<eos> God will.
And he forgives you for the rest of it.<eos> He does?<eos> He does.<eos> Steve...<eos> she will,too.
It's not at your place.<eos> I won't be telling you.<eos> I guess that goat's head didn't work after all, huh?<eos> Not much of a prosperity spell.<eos> It will.
She's saying it never is.<eos> She said that was the best date. The picnic on the beach and it poured sheets and sheets of rain.<eos> We sat in my car and listened to the whole American Beauty album.<eos> She remembers it all.<eos> She always will.
You don't need to arrest someone to have a conversation.<eos> - You're the relationship coach.<eos> - Not for families so much.<eos> - Why can't patrick just accept that his father is dead?<eos> - Well,I'm sure he will... eventually.
If Pruitt folds, so do dozens of other ancillary businesses.<eos> Who does that help?<eos> Those are sweatshop jobs.<eos> And if they go away, do you think these people are gonna stop coming here?<eos> They won't.
Miss Boa Vista?<eos> What's going on?<eos> The girl in the tollbooth car is my sister.<eos> We have to find her, Lieutenant.<eos> We will.
I'm afraid he's going to leave it on my doorstep in a gift-wrapped cooler.<eos> You don't need Matt's kidney.<eos> Because I'm going to give you mine.<eos> That is very sweet, Sean, but I think that we're both gonna feel a little silly when my body rejects it.<eos> It won't.
You can't return this.<eos> I have returned it, and somehow or another,<eos> I'm gonna get my $3,000 back. - No, you won't.<eos> - Yes, I will.<eos> No, you won't.
I have returned it, and somehow or another,<eos> I'm gonna get my $3,000 back. - No, you won't.<eos> - Yes, I will.<eos> No, you won't.<eos> Yes, I will.
- Why?<eos> - Just trust me.<eos> And nobody else should find out either.<eos> - And tell your boyfriend not to say anything.<eos> - He won't.
Maxentius is my brother, you forget that.<eos> I know him, he's ruthless.<eos> - He'll kill us.<eos> He'll kill you, he'll kill both of us.<eos> - No, no, no, he won't.
It's always stayed wild.<eos> In ancient times it was considered bad luck to walk in there or even to collect timber.<eos> Even the Romans stayed clear of it.<eos> I've had no report of any sighting.<eos> You won't.
That blows.<eos> We wanted to bring it for show-and-tell.<eos> Hey, sweetheart, you okay?<eos> What if the crazy lady comes back?<eos> She won't.
Well, listen, I really have to get back to upton.<eos> I don't like to come into the city very much 'cause it really makes me kinda nervous, so... so good to see you.<eos> - Bye.<eos> Please come visit us.<eos> - I will.
Amanda, if you knew who he was, why did you get so involved?<eos> Because... I thought he would get sick of serial dating.<eos> I sure as hell am.<eos> And what if he doesn't?<eos> He will.
And Maew... how is she doing?<eos> If you're coming home, bring her along.<eos> She's a famous singer now. Has she's forgotten me?<eos> Please tell her that we all miss her.<eos> I will, Mom. 13
No. No,you don'T.<eos> You don't know me.<eos> You know,I don't care what you read or what you think you read, you don't get it.<eos> But keep watching.<eos> You will.
No, about the Seth thing.<eos> I have been pulling away.<eos> It's just...<eos> Summer, I understand.<eos> But Seth will, too.
If you confess, I'll do whatever I can to help you.<eos> - They won't let me.<eos> - Jordan.<eos> - Who?<eos> Who won't?
--He says no.<eos> --Oh, no one's going to believe him.<eos> They're out for blood.<eos> He's not going to get a fair shake.<eos> Yes, he will.
Hey everyone!<eos> MA Yeon-seong here is...!<eos> Quiet, okay, I'll teach you how!<eos> But once you blabber our secret I'll sew your trap tight!<eos> Okay! I won't.
Aside from the food. And Timbits.<eos> Um, you know, honestly, I kind of dig it. I like it.<eos> This is my, uh, second-- well, third favorite part of the job. I like writing.<eos> I like editing. Because editing is kind of like writing. It's like getting to write another version of the script.<eos> Another draft if you will.
What, you're serious?<eos> No, no, no.<eos> I'm going to go so Ryan Atwood on his ass.<eos> Come on, Cohen, I don't like this.<eos> Neither will Che.
If she were alive, today would be her birthday.<eos> That's right.<eos> Today's the 29th.<eos> If I die, will you believe me?<eos> will you?
I'm sorry.<eos> You must still be in shock.<eos> February 29th is over.<eos> will the ghost return in 4 years?<eos> will she?
Stop!<eos> I'm sorry!<eos> I won't tell anyone!<eos> I'm sorry!<eos> I won't!
What is it Sue?<eos> Three thousand pounds Sue.<eos> Marry him Miss.<eos> Mr. Rivers loves you. And love never hurt a flea.<eos> All right, I will.
No.<eos> But you can.<eos> - There's gotta be something we can do.<eos> - You came all this way to save me.<eos> - And you will.
What?<eos> -We're gonna play a game.<eos> -What kind of a game?<eos> You'll see.<eos> Well, actually, you won't.
When you stand before God, you cannot say...<eos> "But I was told by others to do thus"... or that virtue was not convenient at the time.<eos> This will not suffice.<eos> Remember that.<eos> I will.
Blasphemy!<eos> An army of Jesus Christ, which bears his holy cross, cannot be beaten.<eos> Does the count of Tiberias suggest that it could be?<eos> There must be war.<eos> God wills it!
An army of Jesus Christ, which bears his holy cross, cannot be beaten.<eos> Does the count of Tiberias suggest that it could be?<eos> There must be war.<eos> God wills it!<eos> God wills it!

There must be war.<eos> God wills it!<eos> God wills it!<eos> God wills it!<eos> God wills it!
Everything's going to change now, isn't it?<eos> Promise you'll write this summer.<eos> Both of you. I won't.<eos> You know I won't.<eos> - Harry will, won't you?
Sit down.<eos> Breakfast is ready.<eos> I'm taking good care of my guy.<eos> She's got to come back on her own, Jack.<eos> She will.
Get out of here.<eos> Come on.<eos> Your whole life passes before your eyes.<eos> And if you've lived as a true American... you get to watch it all in colour.<eos> Oh, and you will.
No one would ever use ECT on a child.<eos> I don't know that he is having seizures. If he is, that could send him into status. It's a permanent state of seizure.<eos> Babak is my friend's son.<eos> I would never risk that.<eos> You will.
I am proud of you.<eos> I did my duty.<eos> I avenged my mother.<eos> Please tell me about her.<eos> Everything... I will.
'It hurts.'<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> - What if I don't wake up?<eos> - You will.
Who cares.<eos> Leave me alone!<eos> -We've gotta get this kid into the race.<eos> -The Chief will never go for it.<eos> Of course he will.
River.<eos> River, I'm sorry.<eos> No.<eos> I hate to leave.<eos> You won't.
You can go on up to your room and play.<eos> Cute kid.<eos> Thank you.<eos> If you hear anything, you'll give me a call?<eos> I will, Sheriff.
Yeah.<eos> All right. Yeah, good luck.<eos> Yeah, you too.<eos> May the best man win?<eos> Oh, he will.
No one has a camera here.<eos> Okay.<eos> I'm going...<eos> I'll go get one.<eos> I'll just...
Shoot. You think it wasn't hard bein' the only "moniker" up in the shop?<eos> But I stuck it out, and people warmed up...<eos> And eventually, it was like, blam!<eos> I was doin' the damn thing.<eos> And so will you.
It's okay, Gina.<eos> You'll get through this.<eos> - You'll get through this.<eos> - I wish that was true, Joe.<eos> You will.
That's the end of it, now stop it!<eos> You must all look inside yourselves... and that which you find there will save you!<eos> Now stop it!<eos> I'm having a drink so don't try to stop me!<eos> No, I won't.
And, yeah, so I can tell who's done it.<eos> Of course.<eos> - And you really haven't? - No, I really haven't.<eos> Please don't tell your mom, okay?<eos> - Yeah, I won't.
Right?<eos> Robert?<eos> - Robert?<eos> - Robert?<eos> It won't. No.
Big egos.<eos> Lots of screaming.<eos> I can maybe include one or two of you... but excluding Mossad or the army is impossible.<eos> Accept it.<eos> We will, but our source won't.
- What if he can't beat it?<eos> Can't we do anything?<eos> - He's in for the long haul.<eos> - He won't be able to last that long.<eos> Yes, he will. He won't.
Yes, a sweet curse.<eos> I know that you're in trouble because of the show.<eos> But I have a solution.<eos> If you could give me 2 minutes...<eos> I won't!
And you know it's just routine.<eos> For God's sakes, can't you wait a few weeks?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I just wanna know that something's gonna happen, you know?<eos> It will.
For God's sakes, can't you wait a few weeks?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I just wanna know that something's gonna happen, you know?<eos> It will.<eos> - It will.
I caught a glimpse. Something.<eos> You gotta stop obsessing about the dog-park girl, Jake.<eos> - I know.<eos> - Move on.<eos> I will.
Not enough to kill herself, but enough to keep pissing me off.<eos> What are you going to do?<eos> Here's your ticket, I'll take the jeep.<eos> - Don't worry.<eos> - I won't.
Our rules of engagement allow the use of weapons only in self-defense.<eos> In fact to use the M-2 machine gun, I must even obtain the approval of the Secretary General himsef.<eos> Our mandate is not to enforce the peace, but to monitor it.<eos> Alright Capitaine, I can understand the difference.<eos> Certainly these people won't.
- What's that, Birsu Abla?<eos> The phone bill.<eos> Since you arrived it's shot up to 100 million.<eos> - We'll share it.<eos> - No, we won't.

Ellen, we're gonna talk numbers.<eos> This cannot be happening.<eos> The realtor said another couple made an offer.<eos> Maybe the Janices won't get it!<eos> Maybe the other couple will.
Look, it might seem strange how I found it, but I did find it, and now they want to publish it in the yearbook.<eos> Tough luck.<eos> Grace, do you know how that touched me?<eos> You have this whole Emily Dickinson crazy talent that no one ever knew about and now they will.<eos> No, they won't!
I can't really say.<eos> How come he can get away with that?<eos> Because he's confused. You're lying.<eos> Do I want to know about this?<eos> Oh, you will.
Hey, these are intense feelings, Adam.<eos> Processing them at your age... yeah, but she saw me at the bottom, Mrs. G.<eos> Crying and complaining and scared.<eos> How's she gonna forget that?<eos> She won't
Joey?<eos> Hey, did-did someone say my name?<eos> No.<eos> Uh, no one did.<eos> But someday soon, everyone will.
I couldn't.<eos> Hey, buddy.<eos> Your mother would be proud of you.<eos> Make it back in one piece.<eos> I will.
I haven't spoken to him in 13 years.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I suppose it's better than nothing.<eos> Nessa, both your lives, and mine, are in danger if anybody finds out.<eos> They won't.
I spoke to your doctor.<eos> You don't need it.<eos> You know what?<eos> I'll take this one.<eos> Yes, you will.
Not until I leave, okay?<eos> We've heard rumours about insider coupons... but we were sure it was just another urban discount legend.<eos> Well, trust me, it's not.<eos> You two... cannot tell anybody...<eos> We won't.
Where is he?<eos> We think Lizzie may have him.<eos> Please.<eos> Please you've got to find him.<eos> I will.
I would.<eos> I understand now, Monk.<eos> You can't let it go, can you?<eos> Don't ever lose that watch.<eos> I won't.
Part of a sniper's mission is to infiltrate enemy territory.<eos> Our guy wants to prove himself, validate his skills.<eos> He's not gonna pass up an opportunity like this.<eos> - What if he succeeds?<eos> - He won't.
Did he look kind when he blew out Gerald's shoulder?<eos> You asked me why I couldn't stab him, and I told you.<eos> Contrary to conventional wisdom, Kate, eyes can lie.<eos> You meet him again, don't forget that.<eos> I won't.
You asked me why I couldn't stab him, and I told you.<eos> Contrary to conventional wisdom, Kate, eyes can lie.<eos> You meet him again, don't forget that.<eos> I won't.<eos> I won't!
Not today.<eos> Send them away.<eos> I keep doing that, they're going to get suspicious.<eos> Okay. Just don't forget what's at stake here, Captain.<eos> I won't.
Sometimes feels more intimate than anything else.<eos> Maybe you could help me with him.<eos> Just until this thing with Gina is resolved, until I get custody.<eos> - What if you don't?<eos> - I will.
I have to talk to her.<eos> I have to explain.<eos> - Luke, I wouldn't.<eos> - I can't go without making it right.<eos> I won't.
By the time we get there it should be gone.<eos> Okay, wait a second.<eos> Shouldn't somebody stay here by the phone?<eos> I mean, incase your dad calls.<eos> I will.
-So could I.<eos> You're my family now, Haley.<eos> The only true thing I have.<eos> I never want to lose you.<eos> You won't.
Nathan is gonna kill me.<eos> Just play him the track.<eos> He'll understand.<eos> No, trust me.<eos> He won't.
No, I can't,<eos> I have fluorescence-glowing bacteria growing...<eos> I have a meeting.<eos> - Oh. Okay, I'll take Jill.<eos> - You will?
Liz. Liz, I'm Franco.<eos> Nice to meet you. You know, Liz, if you just happened to leave your computer screen unattended, just for a moment and I just happened to check out that computer screen as a fellow city employee...<eos> That could happen, right?<eos> It could.<eos> But it won't.
I love you.<eos> Aren't they amazing?<eos> I don't love you.<eos> - Please don't cry.<eos> - I won't.
I don't want to lose you either.<eos> Will you marry me?<eos> Are you serious?<eos> Yes.<eos> Will you?
Yeah.<eos> The problem is not nuclear war.<eos> The problem is what's gonna cause nuclear war.<eos> I don't see us living through a nuclear war, george.<eos> Of course no not a whole lot of people will.
Yes, you can, dear, it's where we live.<eos> No, Ruth.<eos> This is where I live now.<eos> Let's get married and have a baby.<eos> Will you?
I'm in the middle of a practice.<eos> It's only gonna take,like, two seconds, I promise.<eos> - I'll do it later.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - I will.
Then you know that a friend would never keep me locked up in here.<eos> Get used to it.<eos> I did.<eos> People are going to come looking for me.<eos> They won't.
- I'll look forward to it.<eos> - You'll have to get used to a few things, now that everything's changing around here.<eos> But we can talk about that next time we visit.<eos> Just promise me you'll stick around.<eos> I will.
It's the end of the line, Maggie.<eos> Please, Nick.<eos> I promise I won't tell anyone what I know.<eos> You're right.<eos> You won't.
What I needed was for you to let me in. To be a part of your life.<eos> But now... God, after this...<eos> Luc, please.<eos> It won't happen again.<eos> Maybe not the same way, but it will.
So, the feeling is that maybe two weeks from now... we don't go back to the court for another extension.<eos> We charge what we have... we try to roll someone up at Cheese or one of Joe's other lieutenants.<eos> What, are you kidding?<eos> We don't have a case worth making yet.<eos> And at this rate, we never will.
- No. Look.<eos> We don't want anyone to get hurt, okay?<eos> That includes Kevin.<eos> If he hasn't called yet, he's not going to call.<eos> He will, Sara.
I really don't know if I could take any more.<eos> I'm not gonna do anything right now.<eos> I would like you to think about this for a day.<eos> There's a lot at stake here.<eos> Yes, I will.
She really was horrible to you.<eos> I'm going.<eos> - What?<eos> - I'll go to your little shindig.<eos> You will?
Come on!<eos> That was fun today.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I really hope he eats it.<eos> He will.
No.<eos> Not. Never.<eos> Smeagol hates nasty Hobbitses.<eos> Smeagol wants to see them dead.<eos> And we will.
Mr. Frodo?<eos> What is it?<eos> It's just a feeling.<eos> I don't think I'll be coming back.<eos> Yes, you will. Of course you will.
Maybe the future has been written.<eos> I don't know.<eos> All I know is what the Terminator taught me:<eos> Never stop fighting.<eos> And I never will.
- Johnny, this is ridiculous.<eos> - I'm a spent force.<eos> Spent, my ass.<eos> Ow.<eos> Will... you...
Right.<eos> As in Nikolaos Natchios.<eos> That's Dad.<eos> How am I gonna find you?<eos> You won't.
Because it's my damn ship.<eos> Oh, that makes perfect sense.<eos> Look, for 20 years, I've done nothing but Virgil. 20 years.<eos> Virgil belongs to me, and I will not let her fail.<eos> I will not.
Try not to worry.<eos> I'll talk to the judge.<eos> We'll have plenty of time to figure this all out.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Like hell he will.

I'm sure that's the case.<eos> But the fact of the matter is, none of us has any experience with having a severely retarded man wandering the halls with our students.<eos> The risk is enormous.<eos> -Please keep that in mind.<eos> -l will.

He's a very sweet man. And he's just, you know, very weak as well.<eos> I'm gonna leave this tonight, I can't concentrate on it.<eos> You know, in two or three years... I hope I'm gonna be able to support us properly. And then I'm gonna have a child with him before it's too late.<eos> -Does he want that?<eos> -Yeah, he will.
Fire at will!<eos> Get him out of here!<eos> - You know the policy on this?<eos> - Not at all.<eos> - He will.

I thought... "if only you had been there," I'd have asked you for an answer.<eos> I told Karan just that.<eos> - What did you say?<eos> That I can't say yes or no without consulting Raj. "If I forbid you from marrying him," you won't marry Karan?<eos> I won't.
What progress?<eos> I'd find a girl for him today itself.<eos> But will he marry the girl I choose?<eos> Why won't he? Won't I break the moron's legs?<eos> "I will, on one condition.

Creatures.<eos> Hideous nightmares that crawl in the night.<eos> I've seen them.<eos> I've seen them in visions.<eos> And you will too.

Gary's a bad guy, Carmen.<eos> Maybe I know that.<eos> I think I can change him.<eos> I do not understand you.<eos> And you never will.
That was most artistic, the way you disposed of the annoying Mr. Lounds.<eos> Your cell looks bigger with no books in it.<eos> Does it?<eos> I hadn't noticed.<eos> Oh, you will.

What?<eos> Have you....<eos> Did anybody....<eos> Has nothing been heard... about me?<eos> Not a word, and never will we.
Dude, women reach their peak at forty.<eos> I'm talking money, dude.<eos> We'll get young chicks when we're like forty and have money and shit.<eos> What if we don't make any money even when we're forty?<eos> We will, why won't we?
I'll drink from the bottle.<eos> I wish we could be alone.<eos> I won't lay a finger on you.<eos> I promise.<eos> I won't, okay?

My son is gay and in New York and you knew!<eos> My son is gay and in New York.<eos> I'm going to New York. I can see him!<eos> He won't want to see you.<eos> - Of course he will, darling.
You're still angry.<eos> Pain doesn't decompose when you bury it.<eos> And that is a Claire Otom-ism.<eos> Dr. Liston said I can come and visit whenever I want.<eos> -And will you?
Do you think I care about your little crush?<eos> Moon all you want over the Texas Twig because I know whose bed you'll be crawling into at the end of the day.<eos> Or the middle of it.<eos> You think you know me?<eos> Better than she ever will.

I promise.<eos> You guys, can we...?<eos> Can we just stay in tonight and not go to the restaurant?<eos> We still have to talk.<eos> Yeah, we will, just at home.
Clear your mind.<eos> You are a hunter now.<eos> You have the ability to find your prey.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> You will.
Heavy.<eos> Focus.<eos> What's the point?<eos> - We don't even have the Grimoire.<eos> - We will.
You guys stopped one of their own from killing.<eos> - I think they'd be grateful.<eos> - Yeah, one would hope.<eos> At least until they find those files on us.<eos> They won't.
- I found Ray.<eos> - Is he with you?<eos> - No, but I know where my husband took him.<eos> - You've gotta help me get him back.<eos> - I will.
You really believe in all that stuff?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I really do.<eos> Right now, I'd just be happy to find a good woman, you know?<eos> Well, you will.
Something your species doesn't seem to understand.<eos> I'll explain it to the Captain immediately.<eos> You might also explain to your captain... that it's been nearly three hours since he received our transmission.<eos> If he has the slightest hope of acquiring any technology from us... he'd be wise to pay us the courtesy of responding.<eos> I'll...
I´m afraid that she´s gone off to Denver with her mother.<eos> Oh, will you give her this for me?<eos> Absolutely.<eos> Tell her I made it.<eos> I certainly will.
Fine. Then you can tell the Williamsons that you're not spending time with them because you have a problem with their child.<eos> I won't have to tell them because I won't be there.<eos> Okay. then. I'll tell them.<eos> - Fine with me.<eos> - Yeah. I will.
This, uh... This fellow, this, uh, you know, upright sort of citizen he comes in, and he's, you know, complaining...<eos> Inara, she's gotta have some funny whoring stories, I'd wager.<eos> Oh, do I ever.<eos> Funny and sexy. You have no idea.<eos> And you never will.
- Make sure to swing by.<eos> - I will.<eos> I should make the rounds.<eos> Say goodbye before you leave.<eos> - I will, Cobra.
I have been patient for over 3000 years!<eos> Forgive me. I simply meant that the relics will soon be here.<eos> I feel it in my bones.<eos> And then, Lord Hades, the world will be ours.<eos> Indeed it will, human. Indeed it will.
The Knight of Pentacles.<eos> Is that good?<eos> Well, it confirms what I felt earlier...<eos> romance. You know anyone with a British accent?<eos> - No. - You will... very soon.
You know, I sent it out.<eos> To this magazine.<eos> No! I didn't!<eos> Honey, that's wonderful!<eos> When will you--
Fuck, no.<eos> The girl would spread her legs for anything that moved, and sometimes for things that didn't.<eos> I don't like to disrespect the dead...<eos> Hey, you know what, Javier?<eos> You never will again.
- Why don't you leave?<eos> - We've tried.<eos> No place like home.<eos> - Lf they get him... LIZ:<eos> They will.
I collect found playing cards.<eos> - They're all over the city.<eos> - Really?<eos> I never noticed.<eos> Well, you will now.
I've heard about you vendors.<eos> Hey, lady.<eos> I like the way your body looks.<eos> - Stop objectifying my mom.<eos> - I will in a second.
Never mind.<eos> Oh, look, here's one.<eos> - Who are you working for?<eos> - I don't understand.<eos> You will.
Go and have a look.<eos> Swipe it through the slot, light goes green, you're in.<eos> Go and see, please.<eos> - I'd rather you showed me.<eos> - I will, but...

Stolen, wandered off, no one knows.<eos> And that was five years ago.<eos> Jack stayed close with this guy?<eos> We all have our Chet Collinses.<eos> You will, too.
It's a tough bargain because either way... their personal tragedy becomes film at 11.<eos> They're just doing their job.<eos> Yeah, after some ambitious reporter goes behind your back... with an exclusive that blows your case, you might feel a little differently.<eos> - We'll see.<eos> - Yes, you will.
The guy was killed, right?<eos> A man survives a fall like this, on fire?<eos> It's not very likely.<eos> You got a body?<eos> We will, Agent Doggett.
Pharaoh Bender!<eos> He once more walks among the living!<eos> How we doing?<eos> Remember me!<eos> I will. I will.
Do they have summer here?<eos> You'll know it's summer when the partridge berries are out.<eos> And we can make partridge berry duff and sweet berry okie.<eos> Will you show me how?<eos> I will, yeah.
You're a kidnapper, and you're a sick weirdo.<eos> Megan, you're the most opinionated girl in my class.<eos> - Think you got that from your mom?<eos> - I wanna go home.<eos> You will.
Memsahib, we're leaving.<eos> Come on.<eos> He'll never agree, Bhuvan.<eos> Father.<eos> He will.
It is only you that will not see you run.<eos> Pride's the one thing they can't take!<eos> But they can take it from you.<eos> They can and they will.<eos> Oh, they will.
You can have a good time as well. It's allowed.<eos> Anything you want.<eos> You just have to ask.<eos> -Don't forget.<eos> -Oh, I won't.
A son.<eos> My own blessed son!<eos> Welcome, my child, to wind and weather.<eos> I'll...<eos> I'll...
I'm with you, Rafe.<eos> If it wasn't for Charlie on that boat, I would have thrown myself overboard.<eos> He kept fighting no matter what.<eos> He never gave up.<eos> Neither will I.
As you are.<eos> Good and bad.<eos> Better and worse.<eos> I told you this already, but you didn't believe me.<eos> Tonight you will.
My youngest child, Zsuzsi, was left behind in Hungary.<eos> She lives with a family in the country.<eos> My husband says that the Americans will help us.<eos> So I keep writing them.<eos> Well, they will. We will.
What do you plan to do with that?<eos> Commit a heinous crime. What else?<eos> You'll wait for me, right?<eos> Right?<eos> Of course you will.
Long lashes, brown eyes.<eos> He's kind of got that sexy, intellectual, preppy thing going on.<eos> What?<eos> Oh, cool.<eos> Yeah, I will.
You see that girl down there?<eos> You must promise to tell no one.<eos> We're to be married.<eos> Do you love her?<eos> I will, Sister.
We shouldn't talk like this.<eos> It's not safe.<eos> Your father, he's a good man.<eos> He'll understand vou had no choice.<eos> No, he won't.
Make you big and strong.<eos> You can fly far away from here.<eos> You can fly far away from here.<eos> We will fly away from here.<eos> We will away from here forever.
I'm sorry. lt won't happen again, OK?<eos> I got a brand-new timer plus a back-up power source.<eos> Gotta kill some Jews.<eos> It's all I ever talk about and this time it's gotta happen.<eos> It will.
I used to get angry.<eos> But today, I would like to tell you, that you were right.<eos> Mother loves you more than me.<eos> She loves you too much.<eos> And she will always.

Pawan, this place is unfit for a horse like you.<eos> Wait here.<eos> Look, another one in search of the same thing.<eos> You won't find...<eos> Nobody will.
'Prince' Asoka?<eos> - You'll stay here.<eos> - Pawan is waiting for me.<eos> His kind never return.<eos> He will, Bheema.
My father did not can not arrest you there ...<eos> Yes you can! He can arrest me.<eos> So there it is.<eos> But I will not stay, Shelly.<eos> - Okay. - I will not.

I'll be by at four.<eos> What for?<eos> To meet my father.<eos> I guess I'll have to join you.<eos> No you won't.
Abdel Hakim's dead. He committed suicide; I just got the news.<eos> Yet if I were in his place on June 5 I'd have done the same.<eos> My condolences<eos> I want you to come over.<eos> Yes, I will.
We have to turn left, via Cernavoda.<eos> And they'll keep the busimess?<eos> Ovarian, you'll be a big boss...<eos> And you'll keep giving them money?<eos> Sure I will.
I forgot.<eos> Finished.<eos> Don't make this harder.<eos> Sit next to me for a while.<eos> Will you?
You're a good boy, Siddharth<eos> You always stood by me<eos> You want me to be happy, don't you...<eos> Then... you be happy<eos> You will, won't you?

Oh!<eos> I Think, I'm always waiting<eos> Anyway, Sung-hee lt's good for you...<eos> Cheer up!<eos> Maby, I'll... lnnkeeper
Let's cut it off, Kate.<eos> That would be a mistake, J.J.<eos> Kate, the client wants to move on.<eos> We should see this last guy.<eos> It'll... Two minutes!
Last night, when I told her good night, she wouldn't even acknowledge me.<eos> I actually had the thought that I'd be... I'd be so glad when she got out of the house.<eos> When Janet wakes up, she'll know where Kim is and then we'll find her.<eos> - I just hope it'll be that easy.<eos> - It will.
This thing is burning a hole in my pocket.<eos> The last stop, baby.<eos> Will you marry me?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, Charlie, I will.
He has nothing to do with the CIA.<eos> So you say Sloane is a fraud?<eos> How do I know it's not you who is the fraud?<eos> You don't.<eos> But you will.
I thought she'd want it that way.<eos> And you have no idea who was responsible, who killed her?<eos> No.<eos> I swear to god, somehow I will find out who did this to our mother... and I will kill him.<eos> I will.
-You're gonna hit me?<eos> -That's a warning.<eos> -Excuse me, Jenny.<eos> Don't ever push me.<eos> Oh, but, Elaine, I will.
You helped me. You have no idea.<eos> It's late.<eos> My parents are probably wondering.<eos> You know, you will meet somebody.<eos> I will, and you will.
She wants me.<eos> She really wants me!<eos> She wants to get you alone, slit your throat, and rifle your pockets.<eos> - But go ahead, see for yourself.<eos> - I will.
- Wanna come?<eos> - Most definitely.<eos> Don't tell me...<eos> You've got a plan.<eos> Okay, I won't.
including Dawn.<eos> Then the last thing she'll see is me protecting her.<eos> You'll fail.<eos> You'll die.<eos> We all will.
We found some of Paige's hair in your car.<eos> Well, that's impossible because she's never been in my car.<eos> Are you sure it was hers?<eos> You mean, uh, will it stand up in court?<eos> Yes, it will.
I may not be able to.<eos> To stop him, I'll have to embrace my demonic self completely.<eos> There may be no coming back from that.<eos> Well, then we'll just have to make sure that potion works very well.<eos> Won't we?
- We're going.<eos> - Leo.<eos> It doesn't matter.<eos> It's not like we get to remember it anyway.<eos> You will this time.
Thank God you're okay.<eos> Actually, it had more to do with what you guys did.<eos> Vanquishing Zile broke the bond and reversed all the evil you had done.<eos> I just hope the wedding planners don't remember what we did to them.<eos> Unfortunately, they will.
If i wore the wrong dress, he'd have to keep his legs crossed all evening.<eos> I'm sure he's never like that with you.<eos> Really--are you?<eos> It's only that i went out with him for so long-- i got really good at getting him all worked up.<eos> You will, too.
We took a conference call and agreed on a settlement figure.<eos> That means we accept guilt?<eos> It means the hospital's gonna take it in the shorts to the tune of $1.5 million.<eos> But our insurance will pay that.<eos> And so will we, with sky-high premiums.
- No, you're not.<eos> In fact, you're not on for the rest of the week.<eos> Says who? - Says me.<eos> - Does Weaver know about this?<eos> - She will.
But we believe the technology served its purpose... smoothed the unification of our species.<eos> Ex-protector Robert Brody's CVI just killed him.<eos> Impossible!<eos> - I received no report.<eos> - And you won't.
It's official.<eos> Neil Goldman isn't kissable.<eos> Hear that, Neil?<eos> I don't like you.<eos> I never will!
You sure this thing's unlocked?<eos> I'm not feelin' any smarter.<eos> Give it some time.<eos> All right, but somethin' better kick in before that Dreadnought gets here.<eos> It will.
I am is still Dominar.<eos> Always Dominar.<eos> I mean, ruling from a throne instead of a throne sled.<eos> They'll never know if I kill Crichton.<eos> But you will...
-Where were we?<eos> Do you take this man..?<eos> -No!<eos> -You'll take him.<eos> -No, I won't!
- Look, it's right on top.<eos> - Isn't that a coincidence?<eos> There are some really big words in here.<eos> I hope you have a dictionary with you when you read it.<eos> I will.
- It's not like I don't know how it ends.<eos> - Okay, look. Rory, I'll sit in the back, you'll die, and I'll walk you home.<eos> - It's no big deal, right?<eos> - Right. Good. So I'll see you tomorrow.<eos> Yep, you sure will.
- You could bring your boyfriend.<eos> - I'll see.<eos> - Meet me after Biology?<eos> - And if I don't?<eos> You will.
That's funny.<eos> I would've wanted her to find someone who would send her home.<eos> I have to go.<eos> I'd appreciate if you didn't mention this to Lorelai.<eos> I won't.
Says your name every day. He cries.<eos> I don't know what to tell him.<eos> I gotta go now, Stephanie.<eos> Tell them I love them.<eos> I will.
HOW WOULD I KNOW WHAT SHE THINKS?<eos> BESIDES, IT'S NOT ADATEDATE, IT'S A PARTY FOR THE BOSS.<eos> IT'S BUSINESS.<eos> CHRIST, I WISH EVERYBODY WOULD JUST GET OFF MY BACK!<eos> FINE, I WILL.
How many have you done?<eos> For that matter, how many times have you sat on the grass and done nothing?<eos> You need to start taking some time for yourself.<eos> Promise me you'll do that.<eos> - I will.
I just don't understand Francine's motivation.<eos> Why does she only go after the smart ones?<eos> That's like asking the square root of a million.<eos> No one will ever know.<eos> Someone will.
Sir, that contest ended 30 years ago.<eos> We don't even make animal crackers anymore.<eos> We make household poisons and Christmas lights.<eos> Your box made promises of a "vacational" nature... and I expect you to live up to them.<eos> We won't though.
What's it like to shoot a gun?<eos> You wanna try some time?<eos> - Come down to East Los, be down.<eos> - Are you serious?<eos> Because I will.
Because I'm sure you'll do the right thing.<eos> That's why I made you captain.<eos> This is Rosalie's kid.<eos> That's why I'll understand if you give him a pass.<eos> Everybody else will too.
I was in bed.<eos> Why was today important to me, Tim ?<eos> Being promoted to sergeant next week,<eos> - don't forget.<eos> - I won't.

- I'm telling her.<eos> - Don't !<eos> - I will.<eos> If anyone tells her, I will.<eos> - You won't.
You will not terminate this one in order to destroy me.<eos> It went into Sam out of self-preservation.<eos> I cannot be removed from this mind without terminating.<eos> You will not terminate this one.<eos> None ofyou will.
Ifl had been able to complete transmission,... ..you would have been destroyed.<eos> My world would have been preserved. Well, in a way, you succeeded.<eos> We won't go back there.<eos> You can repair the damage and we won't send any more probes through.<eos> Yes, we will.
How are you gonna find your johnson When you're taking a leak?<eos> How do you think I learned to wrestle a hose?<eos> Thought you learned how to wrestle trying to keep your wife home.<eos> WALSH: we'll see you tomorrow.<eos> - Yes, you will.
She's staring in the face of her past.<eos> This man is the spitting image of Borias.<eos> -He was Xena's lover.<eos> -Well, have you found him?<eos> Not yet, but we will.
It's-- where is it?<eos> That's where it is!<eos> Here, talk to Bill.<eos> You have got to get me Main Street for nothing.<eos> I will.

A few hours.<eos> Korso and Preed<eos> - I can't believe it.<eos> How long before they reach the Titan?<eos> They won't.
And I get tired easily.<eos> I walk for a bit and I'm beat.<eos> And I have a cough in the morning.<eos> I'll give you something, but you have to take it.<eos> I will.

Only you and me seen it, and I won't tell a soul.<eos> Cross my heart.<eos> Ain't nobody gonna know.<eos> I will, Hardy.<eos> And so will you.
Those whom life doesn't cure death will.<eos> She will not break her word to me.<eos> You will see.<eos> Yes, ma'am.<eos> We will.
Did he call me a camel.<eos> They wanted you to play a saxophone solo after which intermission?<eos> The White House itinerary said after the first intermission that I would appear magically on stage through a trap-door.<eos> But we don't have a sax.<eos> We will.
Claire, stop.<eos> You're overreacting.<eos> Don't tell me how to react.<eos> - Will you keep your voice down?<eos> - I will not!
The downside of being good at my job. Good?<eos> My daughter was told you were the best.<eos> Like most people, I do the best I can.<eos> Last time she passed out she regained consciousness almost immediately.<eos> Next time, or the time after, she won't.
- Marion?<eos> - Who's that?<eos> She'll be sent for.<eos> She'll come.<eos> No, she won't.
No, you, um, go ahead.<eos> You, uh, get some rest. I'm...<eos> I'm tired too.<eos> I almost don't wanna click off here like... maybe we won't get this back.<eos> We will.

No, no, no, no.<eos> Listen, why don't we make it... 12,500?<eos> I can live with 12,500.<eos> As long as my husband doesn't.<eos> He won't.
We stick to the schedule.<eos> In nine hours, the water runs out.<eos> We need it. Our lives depend on it.<eos> He'll die if he doesn't get it.<eos> He will anyway.
You'll need the best of luck in particular.<eos> Take this body to my grand father monsieur Gillenormand, rue Filles du Calvaire.<eos> Eponine, what brings you here?<eos> I'll die.<eos> - No, you won't.
I'll be fine. I know what to do.<eos> Don't drink, go to meetings, find a sponsor, ask for help.<eos> Don't drink, go to meetings, find a sponsor, ask for help.<eos> Well, I hope he makes it.<eos> Statistically, only three out of 10 of us will.
Him, Wayne, does whatever Peter tells him. And Jason... Well, every firm needs a mad acidbath murderer, don't they?<eos> What do you think of my hair, Billy?<eos> - You look like a fuckin' poof. - Fuck off!<eos> What?<eos> Fuck of, will ya?
-Can I come with you?<eos> -No, baby, I'll just be a second.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I'm only sorry you couldn't meet Erin.<eos> -I will.
We can make a change that'll last forever<eos> It's all about love...<eos> Did you see that big lady dancing?<eos> - This is a night I'll never forget.<eos> - Neither will anyone else.

Let the boxers box, and that'll speak for itself.<eos> Unbelievable.<eos> Hector, if this happens... I'm telling Adrian no mercy.<eos> You understand?<eos> Yeah. So will she.
Yeah .<eos> Come on .<eos> Hey, can you cover my station?<eos> No, not if you're going outside.<eos> Okay, we won't.
This was the one.<eos> Hey, man !<eos> Congratulations, man .<eos> Who knows the next time I'm gonna get a chance like this?<eos> You will .
Will you take Sophie foryourwife and love herfaithfully, through good and bad times, forthe rest of your life?<eos> Excuse me?<eos> -We're waiting impatiently foryour answer, Mr. Gervais.<eos> Yes, I want her... I mean, I do, I will...<eos> Yes, I will, too.
Denny! Dad, I'm here.<eos> Oh, OK.<eos> You'll be the ring bearer for now.<eos> I'm not wearing that stupid pillow on my head.<eos> Oh, yes, you damn well will!
I didn't mean to make him feel bad.<eos> I just- - I-l just wanted him to-- to be my big brother.<eos> We gotta go find him.<eos> We just gotta.<eos> And so we will.
What!<eos> - Come on, Sonia. Don't spoil the fun.<eos> But I'm not in the mood!<eos> Fine! Don't come!<eos> Neither will Rohit!
- One can tell you're a pastor.<eos> - Can one?<eos> - It's not going very well, though.<eos> - No.<eos> But it will.
Me,jealous of an old man like that?<eos> That's just the way I see it.<eos> Stop that, stop!<eos> Stop that!<eos> I will not.
Take him away.<eos> Now!<eos> -Forgive me, Misha.<eos> -You'll wait for me?<eos> Of course I will.
For a lousy fare? This cab cost a fortune!<eos> The lousy fare feeds you!<eos> Gonna eat your tires?<eos> You don't like it, get out!<eos> We will!
No.<eos> I see.<eos> Then, I should apologize.<eos> I'm sorry. Please forgive me.<eos> I will.
You didn't come.<eos> - How are you doing?<eos> Very well.<eos> I don't want to lose you.<eos> - You won't.
- No.<eos> I talk to Yasmin and her brother. They want to meet us. I don't want to meet her.<eos> I've told you, I don't like it.<eos> You have to get married.<eos> - I will, but not to her.
I'm from Ebara All-Serve.<eos> Oh, great.<eos> I can't let go right now.<eos> Let yourself in.<eos> OK, I will.
Nothing ever happened.<eos> Consider it as a dream.<eos> To Mt.<eos> Take me there.<eos> Will you?
The Commonwealth spanned three galaxies!<eos> We had over a million member worlds, orbital habitats, asteroid colonies.<eos> Part of it must still exist somewhere.<eos> Then we have to find it.<eos> We will.
Not even thinking about his own family.<eos> Only thinking about them.<eos> Come on, love.<eos> I never did get that goodbye kiss.<eos> You will.
I really wanted to tell him this thing.<eos> What's all this telling Manny everything business?<eos> Tell me.<eos> No, you won't get it.<eos> - No, I will.
Just let the doctors do their magic.<eos> All right.<eos> Well, I just wanted you to get well soon.<eos> I know.<eos> And I will.
That's why I'm here every day.<eos> I have been since the police quit on us.<eos> I'm not leaving until I find somebody who saw what happened.<eos> How can you be sure that you will?<eos> I will.
You're not the only one, Gail.<eos> Everybody wants to be young and attractive.<eos> The difference is I knew what I was giving up.<eos> They don't.<eos> Oh, they will, one day.
And you have to try to get her back.<eos> Because if you don't I promise you, you will regret it.<eos> -Maybe.<eos> -No, Pacey.<eos> You will.
I'll give you that.<eos> I suggest the four of us go out sort of bury the hatchet.<eos> Mark thinks it's a great idea.<eos> He doesn't.<eos> He will.
Wait!<eos> Look, I don't know-<eos> If I talk, will you be my doctor?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Then I will.
I will take it under advisement.<eos> You are dismissed.<eos> Fine... and I'll await your decision.<eos> Yes.<eos> You will.
Pilot, get that boy on the phone.<eos> He is unwilling to discuss it further.<eos> He says he'll fire upon us unless we agree to return Crais now.<eos> Pilot, evasives.<eos> Moya won't.
Go !<eos> One more, sir, please ! Please, one more !<eos> I got my mind right, boss.<eos> - Be nice.<eos> - We will.
You make a worse Peacekeeper than Crichton.<eos> Glad to see you're okay.<eos> Where is he ?<eos> I want to see him.<eos> You will... soon.
I... I wasn't prepared to lose it.<eos> I... I lost control.<eos> I wasn't focused.<eos> D'Argo, that didn't help.<eos> Oh, and Stark's lies will?
I'm sure Dad doesn't care.<eos> He probably thought it was funny.<eos> He'll be telling this story for years.<eos> I don't want him to tell this story for years.<eos> Oh, but he will.
No matter what you decide to do with your life, I'm still proud of you.<eos> I've already decided.<eos> Dad, when I grow up I want to be just like you.<eos> Oh, don't worry, son.<eos> You will.
Oh, I'm sorry, Mic.<eos> It seems cut short.<eos> Maybe you can visit me down under.<eos> New location, no worries, you know.<eos> Maybe I will.
-Are you tellin' me you're in love with her?<eos> Let's just say I'm in love with what she can give me-a get-out-of-jail-free card.<eos> So, tonight, when we're safe, Jenna radios her boss and I give them the fat cat... and we get a little beach house in a sexy, non-extradition country.<eos> If she follows the plan.<eos> -She will.
- Come on, move! Let's get outta here! Move!<eos> [Groans] Myinsides are starting to boil.<eos> - Come on. It won't be long now.<eos> - [Groaning] I don't want to lose my baby.<eos> - You won't.
- No, no, no.<eos> Max, you have to.<eos> If I'm successful, if I can do this, you and I won't exist.<eos> Not as we do now. Max, if you don't do this, we're gonna die.<eos> Everyone will.
This is too important. Keep going.<eos> - Are you sure?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> The important thing is you find what you're looking for.<eos> - I will. - All right.
- Babies?<eos> - Humans.<eos> Moriarty - did he have any connection with Thatcher?<eos> Any interest in her?<eos> Why on earth would he?
Marge is right.<eos> You're getting spoiled!<eos> Before you strangle me, maybe you should check the scoreboard.<eos> I'm your dad and your coach.<eos> And because no one else would, your godfather.
For us.<eos> Would you dance with me?<eos> I just want to hold you,<eos> Look into your eyes, Be in love with you, And feel you being in love with me.<eos> Would you?
Because you aren't every other guy.<eos> You're different.<eos> You're good and kind... and decent.<eos> And I didn't deserve to be with someone like you.<eos> I never would.
I was supposed to.<eos> Morgan, you should not be alone here.<eos> Go.<eos> Not now.<eos> - Benjamin not... would not...
Being here means I'll never have to again.<eos> And neither will you if you just say "yes."<eos> Please say "yes."<eos> He would want you to.<eos> He wouldn't.
I mean... your lady, my ex-lady.<eos> It's all good.<eos> We're cool.<eos> I think now might be a good time to go over and say hi.<eos> I wouldn't.
Sekou was driving it.<eos> Well, hello.<eos> Her school is closed, and I've got a crisis at work.<eos> You want me to babysit?<eos> Would you?
- The less you tell them.<eos> They'll call me a traitor, want to know if I ever talked of going over to the other side, selling secrets to the highest bidder.<eos> For Christ's sakes, that's absurd, Saul.<eos> Harry and Leo would never believe that.<eos> No one would.
Not just the people in our section, but the whole stadium, booing.<eos> He just ruined it for all of them.<eos> They just wanted to hit the ball.<eos> Why would he wanna do that job?<eos> Why would anyone?
He could re-direct our missiles at Mars.<eos> Or Earth.<eos> It's just the guidance systems.<eos> We still have our abort codes.<eos> Besides, why would he?
Even before my dad got sick.<eos> When I was in high school, she bet me money that I could lose weight.<eos> That's awful.<eos> I had no idea.<eos> Why would you?
Balance the scales, right.<eos> What does that mean?<eos> I just mean...<eos> I can't tell you the amount of times that I've been in your shoes and a man with your face has made me feel better.<eos> Yeah, about that, I would...
And trust that Elena is right here dancing with you.<eos> For the sake of argument, if Elena Gilbert weren't tied to your mortality...<eos> Would I become a vampire for you?<eos> Well, you said even if you wanted to.<eos> Oh, would you?
The whole world is still wondering what happened to her ever since she stripped butt naked onstage at Fenway Park.<eos> Show some respect, Hakeem.<eos> The woman has an illness.<eos> Yeah, you would know a lot about that,<eos> - wouldn't you?
So about 10 years ago, did you really want something?<eos> I don't know, a Hello Kitty backpack or the death of an enemy?<eos> No.<eos> What about Marcus? Did he...<eos> Would he...
Even supporting Charles' career by hand-making a Mylar-lined suit jacket to spare his brother discomfort from exposure to electricity.<eos> And yet, during this time, Charles McGill's irrational animus towards his brother... grew to epic proportions.<eos> So when Jimmy discovered that Charles had used his love and his caring against him, when he discovered he had been betrayed by his only living blood relative...<eos> Jimmy snapped.<eos> Wouldn't you?
No daughter of mine would've allowed herself to be duped by a whore.<eos> Why were you the one I chose to keep?<eos> Move aside.<eos> I am not yours to command!<eos> ♪ Would he... ♪
If you will not help for my sake, would you do it for sweet Amelia?<eos> Quigley intends some foulness against her.<eos> Help me, Mrs. Wells.<eos> I see virtue in you and... if I have claimed otherwise in the past, it was a lie.<eos> On any other day I would.
A ship full of 'em came to Jamestown.<eos> Did you not get yourself a wife from amongst them, Henry?<eos> Must you talk all day long?<eos> If I was a man in Jamestown, all them years, I'd want a maid.<eos> What man wouldn't?
But if you felt so manipulated... why return to Chloe at all?<eos> Well, I mean, I tried to leave, but I just felt that I missed... my work.<eos> Look, anyway, baby, bathwater, the detective and I are quite the crime-fighting duo.<eos> I mean, you wouldn't break up<eos> - Batman and Robin, now, would you? - No.
And this is just a formality, so just try to keep it friendly.<eos> Okay?<eos> Martin, would you like to come over to dinner tonight?<eos> No.<eos> He would not.
She's feeling under the weather, dear.<eos> But we were supposed to do this together.<eos> I know.<eos> But she'd want you to play anyway.<eos> She really would.
You're awesome.<eos> Let's not tell anyone.<eos> What?<eos> I mean I want to tell people.<eos> Duh. Why wouldn't I?
When this goes public, they're gonna charge you with a felony, and then every arrest that you made, including the 400 with me as your partner, is gonna be thrown out or subject to appeal.<eos> Regrettably, yes.<eos> That means hundreds of criminals that we put away might be back on the streets.<eos> Yeah, but... this is what I've come to realize, even if that weren't the case, even if I could go back and keep what I did a secret,<eos> I wouldn't.
Duke!<eos> This is looking like a pretty clear cry for help.<eos> Well, as usual, you're not wrong.<eos> Would you like to help me out?<eos> Yes. Yes, I would.
No. Because that never happened.<eos> Did you ever tell your mom how humiliated you felt?<eos> Why would I care if some bimbo preferred to be with garbage instead of me?<eos> So you'd just as soon sit at home alone on your computer?<eos> As a matter of fact, I would.
He's helping me, and I'm gonna help him.<eos> See, I'm leaving tomorrow on my journey, and I was thinking i would take penny with me.<eos> I think that she might like that.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, she would.
So I want you to be prepared for what it feels like to be on the unemployment line.<eos> Because as of this moment forward, I'm going to do everything in my power to ensure that you never work in this town again.<eos> Hey, put that in your Facebook.<eos> - Should I put my showcase here?<eos> - Yeah, would you?
How would you like it?<eos> Excuse me?<eos> Having to sit up here in front of all these people, answering this type of question?<eos> That's what you meant.<eos> Well, I wouldn't.
- Okay.<eos> Just fuckin' with you.<eos> All right.<eos> Um, do you think i should call my mom to tell her about dad?<eos> - No, I wouldn't, Patty.
I think Sandy's mother likes you.<eos> No, she doesn't.<eos> I happen to know that she does.<eos> This could be good for both of us.<eos> I'd really rather not.
You don't have to deal with me anymore, right?<eos> - What happened?<eos> - Hey, you wouldn't understand, all right?<eos> - It's, like, a grown-up thing.<eos> - Yeah, I would.
- How?<eos> What do you do?<eos> You stand and you listen... and if you hear knocking, that's bad, but if you hear grain pouring, it's good.<eos> But I don't suppose any of you would go out there.<eos> I would.
Just chilling.<eos> Barb, is that my shirt?<eos> I don't know, is it?<eos> Want me to take it off?<eos> Would you, please?
Uh, just you?<eos> What, I'm a flamboyant Hollywood producer.<eos> Not the world's tiniest drag queen? What?<eos> I said we'll keep you updated.<eos> Well, you'd better, missy.
Quick, go!<eos> They're mine!<eos> You can't have them! If you try...<eos> Hurry up.<eos> Well, you'd just better not!
They have a-a judge and two assessors.<eos> God, I would have bullied you as a kid.<eos> Jury duty is supposed to be a sacrifice.<eos> Would I like to be at work right now, participating in the Spirit Week assembly?<eos> Yeah, I would.
- [files thud]<eos> You got nailed by the SEC, so you tried to sell me out?<eos> You wearing a wire right now?<eos> No.<eos> I would never...
I've been watching you very closely this week.<eos> I've wanted you to stare at me.<eos> And I am very impressed with what I see, and we were wondering if you would like to join us full-time at TAC-Van Nuys.<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Yes, we would.
Do you mind?<eos> - Yeah. Reason for visit?<eos> Uh, I'm pregnant and I need a--<eos> We'd like to learn about prenatal care, please.<eos> No, we wouldn't.
Tor Degaton's forces have surrounded the ship.<eos> I'm afraid our shields will not be able to sustain continued bombardment.<eos> You're afraid?<eos> Here's an idea: why don't you fire back?<eos> I would, except...
You tell me how first.<eos> Have a seat, Martha.<eos> I've had second thoughts about your resignation.<eos> Would you like to remain as attorney general?<eos> Yes, I would.
Of course not.<eos> Am I?<eos> Answer the man.<eos> No, you're not a jerk, but I didn't do anything.<eos> Mr. Galasso, please. He would never...
You know, I actually made my mom a mug in summer camp.<eos> - You did?<eos> - I did.<eos> I bet she still has it.<eos> Ha ha. Yeah, she would.
Long story.<eos> Tonight's their night.<eos> You're under lockdown.<eos> You think that would make a difference, huh?<eos> Yeah. I would. Ha ha!
Another stranger in his life when he's already lost his mami and papi?<eos> He'll adjust.<eos> But if his nanny was someone he already knew, that would keep him calm.<eos> And quiet.<eos> My sister wouldn't...
Dodger?<eos> Fagin has sworn under oath that the boy gave him the dead man's wallet.<eos> You understand the implications.<eos> You're lying.<eos> Fagin wouldn't...
- You better tell me.<eos> Or we can get an interrogation room down at the FBI.<eos> What, like, from the very beginning?<eos> I would love to.<eos> I would.
The bullet that we removed is evidence.<eos> With it and your testimony, you could put that guy away for a long time.<eos> Everyone will know what I did.<eos> It's true.<eos> They would.
Two!<eos> You still think about her?<eos> Maybe.<eos> You have any news?<eos> How would I?
Oh, well, you said you got a recording studio, right?<eos> - You think you could record me?<eos> - Wait, excuse me?<eos> Yeah, I want to go to music camp this summer, and they need a sound file of me playing the violin, so...<eos> I would, but...
Liz:<eos> Did you tell Cooper about the adoption?<eos> You told me to cancel the baby shower.<eos> I told everyone.<eos> Samar, why would you...
Life is so tough you can't make it into your own bunk?<eos> I don't feel good.<eos> I heard that Alex told you how our garden grows.<eos> If you say a word, I'll end you.<eos> I would... never.
This isn't going away, and you have been gone, and I know you are grieving your cousin...<eos> Uh, it's difficult.<eos> But I have to say it is not easy around here without you.<eos> Red, you know I'd never tell you how to do your job.<eos> Oh, yes, you would.
I'm glad you have ink. (laughs)<eos> So, um, anyway, we never did get to finish the list, but one of the items on Leonard's list was he wanted to drive a police car.<eos> That's such a boy thing.<eos> So, uh, how many ponies under that hood?<eos> I'd really...
I know, but would you back me if I said yes?<eos> If you win, what happens to you here?<eos> Well, I'd have to resign.<eos> Well, whoever replaces you won't know how we handle things.<eos> No, they would not.
Oh, he did it... all by himself.<eos> Mm.<eos> Hey, uh, my phone died.<eos> Would you mind e-mailing me that video when you're done?<eos> Yes, I would.
But why let some sketchy stranger talk you into it?<eos> He's not a stranger.<eos> You know Jimmy Chun?<eos> Recognized him.<eos> Anyone from Flushing would.
They're coming for us from all sides, Bella.<eos> But we're gonna show all these haters just what time it is.<eos> And I want you to know something.<eos> Everything I did was to protect my legacy, and I will do it again.<eos> Yes, I would.
Yes, I would.<eos> I got it.<eos> I see you in there.<eos> Acting like you asleep when you awake.<eos> Yes, I would.
They don't like being manipulated.<eos> So now your son is on a shoot first, ask questions later list.<eos> I want him taken into custody, alive.<eos> Of course you do.<eos> What mother wouldn't?
In case you're about to ask, I don't know who really ran Indian Hill.<eos> I don't care who ran Indian Hill.<eos> Then why are you here?<eos> And why would I know how to find Fish Mooney?<eos> No reason you would.
I...<eos> No.<eos> No, I did it.<eos> My father, he-he showed me the evidence and I knew it was fake.<eos> Christi would never...
Or maybe they do.<eos> I don't know.<eos> They won't respond to me e-mails.<eos> No, I think they would tell us if an asteroid was gonna hit us.<eos> - Would they? Would they?
We're contacting everybody on it.<eos> But you're right.<eos> He will try to do this again.<eos> If you want to help catch him...<eos> Yeah, I would.
The second you left, I took off in my invisible helicopter.<eos> This is not funny!<eos> If you actually listen to yourself, it's hilarious!<eos> Your own piece-of-shit portable containment unit weighed a couple tons, and needed a Mack truck to pull it around.<eos> How the hell would I...?
Said he stopped by earlier.<eos> You know, I don't get a lot of FBI agents calling.<eos> Was his name MacLaren?<eos> Would it help you if I told you I work with him?<eos> Yeah, it would.
My time is much more valuable than yours.<eos> Speaking of, I've only allotted 28 minutes for this conversation, which is very generous of me.<eos> So we should begin.<eos> I'd like to leave.<eos> Oh, no, you wouldn't.
Helen, I should be going now.<eos> I just wanted to say thank you so much for everything.<eos> Don't go yet, Julia.<eos> I'd like you to stay.<eos> I would.
You know, I don't get it.<eos> You're obviously a big-time attorney, and now you're subletting to me.<eos> What the hell happened here?<eos> - You don't know?<eos> - Why would I?
All right, where are you?<eos> Ms. Abernathy.<eos> Hate to bother you with more questions, but when you went out tonight, did you take your car or did you leave that at home?<eos> I drove.<eos> I would, too.
All right.<eos> Now to put all the stuff in it.<eos> Hook up a tiny gearbox.<eos> It's gonna slow down the revolutions of the paper feed so that I can actually see the map coming by.<eos> Otherwise it would just:
And Cash loves school spirit.<eos> Yeah, why do you think Emotacon performs at, like, every pep rally?<eos> - School spirit.<eos> - Yeah, I mean, who wants to be some rando screaming at him from the audience?<eos> - I wouldn't.
All right?<eos> - All right. - Okay.<eos> Let's accept that there is a world where I know, with absolute certainty, the exact time of your death.<eos> Now, you want me to tell you or not?<eos> Yeah, of course I would. Who wouldn't?
That is wasn't really an accident.<eos> Yeah.<eos> So, are you saying that you want to write that she, killed herself?<eos> Gene, I don't want to be a part of romanticizing what we do.<eos> Isabelle wouldn't either.
And I couldn't leave her.<eos> Thank you for your Candor.<eos> Thank you for your Candor.<eos> Tobias Eaton, this trial has concluded and you are absolved of guilt on the attack on Abnegation.<eos> Miss Prior if you would.
I believe a finger would be fair.<eos> Don't you?<eos> No!<eos> Jock!<eos> I wouldn't, mate. I really wouldn't.
That effect is killer.<eos> Let's keep it.<eos> Great.<eos> We'll lock that, and... moving on.<eos> Brett, if you would...
Would that be possible?<eos> ~ Does she want to marry him?<eos> ~ Yes.<eos> And do you want to marry her?<eos> What man would not?
You have such an easy life, J-Dawg.<eos> - Let's go back to the party, okay?<eos> - Yeah, let's get back in.<eos> J-Dawg wants back in.<eos> Why wouldn't he?
No one walks away from that kind of opportunity.<eos> Attitude or injury...<eos> Wonder what they'd tell me were I to call.<eos> - You should.<eos> They would...
Would you like to hear another reason why men are better than women?<eos> Sure, let's make it an even hundred.<eos> You would never kiss me and make me say "I love you"<eos> and then break up with me.<eos> I wouldn't.
Please.<eos> He mustn't find out.<eos> Are you sure that's how you want your marriage to begin - with a deception, a secret?<eos> He won't want to marry me if he found out.<eos> What man would?
- Who?<eos> His neighbour.<eos> He keeps a picture of her under the visor in his cab!<eos> - No. He said there was...<eos> - How would you?
I can't!<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Then don't. Look, maybe what we do is...<eos> God!<eos> It really would, though.
Whatever you want.<eos> We can at least begin a discussion, right?<eos> Even though you never stated it, surely you'd like to see the bombings stop.<eos> - Yes.<eos> Yes, I would.
What's that, boss?<eos> Gather the boys.<eos> And tell the prison guards they're to fire on anyone who tries to come in.<eos> Boss, do you think the prison guards will follow your orders?<eos> They'd better.
We could start our new lives together and live here as a couple.<eos> We could get matching robes that say "Hers" and "Hers."<eos> I could finally wear all those vests that I love.<eos> You'd probably miss your stupid husband, though, right?<eos> Yeah, I would.
You can do it, Jihad.<eos> Your meeting at school is the 22nd.<eos> - Will you be there?<eos> - Of course. He won't take me.<eos> Why wouldn't he?
Then you get sick.<eos> I can't imagine that turned her into Florence Nightingale all of a sudden.<eos> Leo, I'm married.<eos> I get it.<eos> Any man would.
Is that Danish?<eos> Is that like Swedish?<eos> Wouldn't you like to know?<eos> Yes, Jornatha.<eos> I would.
Now, missile defense.<eos> A statement for the Russian media.<eos> - That's all it is.<eos> - Let me ask you something. Would you read that statement if you were me?<eos> Yes, I would.
No, no, no. - I'm desperate.<eos> I'm not writing your wedding vows for you.<eos> - I don't see why not.<eos> - Because it's wrong on so many levels.<eos> I wouldn't even...
We need you.<eos> I need you.<eos> But if I can't trust myself, how can you trust me?<eos> ~ Anyway, Mrs Leclair wouldn't want to work beside me.<eos> ~ Of course she would.
The truth.<eos> You know the King is besotted with Milady.<eos> You might do more harm than good.<eos> But what if she wants to harm Her Majesty?<eos> Why would she?
Are you happy to hang out, or do you want to go on a date?<eos> (Laughs):<eos> No! I don't want to go on a date.<eos> No.<eos> I wouldn't... yes.
You're gonna have to come to my place.<eos> No, thank you.<eos> Doctor says I have to sleep sitting up anyway.<eos> Bed wouldn't do me any good.<eos> Would you...?
I mean he did.<eos> - George killed himself? - Yes!<eos> See? I told you you wouldn't believe me.<eos> I'd like to believe you, trey.<eos> I really would.
It's worth mentionin', you know, in the spirit of full disclosure,<eos> my plan, it worked.<eos> I made a deal for Dodd.<eos> With, what, the Gerhardts?<eos> No, they wouldn't.
It can save Thea.<eos> Right. But only if you become the new Ra's.<eos> Ok.<eos> Well, even if a magic hot tub were not crazy talk, we're not going to let you go and join the League of psychotic murderers, even if it is to save Thea.<eos> Which this wouldn't.
I'm very good at sticking it to the man, but this woman...<eos> I don't want to stick anything to her.<eos> Except myself, but she won't let me.<eos> Why would anybody want to be with you?<eos> Well, why wouldn't they?
Would the defendant like to say anything?<eos> Charles?<eos> Would you like to say anything before sentencing?<eos> Okay.<eos> I would, Your Honor.
Sam?<eos> Sam was drunk, yelling at me.<eos> Nate got out of his car to try to calm him down.<eos> Sam!<eos> Sam wouldn't.
I can't bring him ...<eos> I don't want him here in case he takes their side.<eos> He's a friend.<eos> I don't want him fighting against us.<eos> - He would never. - Oh.
Openly attack them?<eos> - Blast their planes out of the sky?<eos> - Well, for a start.<eos> Our daughter wouldn't want that.<eos> And my people would never
- What do you say?<eos> - Um, I...<eos> Or not.<eos> Totally cool.<eos> No, no, I would, I would.
Perhaps your brother will tell me.<eos> Well?<eos> I don't know where they went.<eos> Would you like me to talk to them, Father?<eos> I would.
Well?<eos> I don't know where they went.<eos> Would you like me to talk to them, Father?<eos> I would.<eos> I would.
What?<eos> That's part of the question, at least, right?<eos> Yeah, it is.<eos> And no.<eos> No, I wouldn't.
What am I supposed to tell people?<eos> The President's in town? I don't know.<eos> You think they'll believe you?<eos> No, Joe, no.<eos> They wouldn't.
We broke up.<eos> Turns out it's really hard to maintain the intensity that you get with Internet communication.<eos> You wouldn't know what I'm talking about there.<eos> - It's a whole new thing.<eos> - Actually, I would.
She could be your friend, too.<eos> - If you want her number, just ask.<eos> - Yeah, no, not tonight.<eos> Well, didn't know you were coming by, but now that you're here,<eos> - w-w-what would you I... - Shh.
I saved your life yesterday and that's how you're gonna repay me?<eos> I think my mom just pulled in.<eos> You should come over.<eos> She'd love to see you.<eos> We both would.
So she could arrest Tommy?<eos> It's not like that at all, T, okay?<eos> I would never do Tommy that way.<eos> Yeah, and you know what?<eos> The old Ghost wouldn't.
I'm finally at the age where I totally get those mugs that are like, "don't talk to me until I've had my morning coffee."<eos> And it's like, so sad and...<eos> Leo and I used to always walk down this street and laugh at the ridiculous things in the windows.<eos> Though, I did always say, I wouldn't mind a pair of Louboutins.<eos> Yeah, who wouldn't?
You still have that thing?<eos> Now, tell me how to sign onto Facebook and show me Maude.<eos> (laughing)<eos> Oh, I'd like to, Mom.<eos> I really would.
Honda.<eos> The power of dreams.<eos> Dean Pelton, I know how susceptible you are to advertising.<eos> Would you say, I'm a level seven susceptible.<eos> No, because why would I?
He runs for the border, yeah.<eos> All right, well, it seems like you have everything handled.<eos> I don't know if I should tell Jane and Lisbon.<eos> Good question. Yeah.<eos> I wouldn't.
Kind of hard to tell...<eos> Are you sure it wasn't her?<eos> For the love of God, yeah, I'm sure it wasn't her.<eos> Well, did the sheriff say anything about where Annika is?<eos> Why would he, Norman?
- During the divorce, we thought it was the best move for him.<eos> Alfie wouldn't do well going back and forth between two separate homes like a ping-pong ball.<eos> Yeah, I didn't like that part, either...<eos> - All the packing and unpacking.<eos> - What kid would?
Well, when Dr. Isles ran your victim's prints, it alerted us.<eos> The victim's on an international criminal database, so we've been after him for a while.<eos> - Great.<eos> - Name's Yuri Yevtushok, though he has a lot of aliases.<eos> I would, too.
Do you know that you used to pinch them when you thought no one was looking?<eos> - You would hurt them.<eos> - I...<eos> I remember wanting your attention.<eos> - But I would never...
What did you get?<eos> Kalinda got it. I just pulled it down from her computer.<eos> Your Honor. I ask leave to approach?<eos> With great caution, Counselor.<eos> As you would a lion in a cage.
- I don't get it.<eos> If you want to confront someone, why don't you just do it in person?<eos> W-What?<eos> Come on, "unfriend" isn't even a word.<eos> - Why would you...
I want to know why my daughter and her friends are visiting you all of a sudden.<eos> Shouldn't you ask your daughter that?<eos> She won't give me an answer. So I thought I'd get it straight from the horse's mouth.<eos> I've heard that your own brother refuses to come here.<eos> So why would these girls?
Nice to meet you.<eos> - What's the matter with you?<eos> - If you don't mind, I just want to give you a tip.<eos> I just saw something from back there.<eos> Oh, I would... yes, please.
- No, absolutely not.<eos> - Why?<eos> - What, are you jealous?<eos> - No, I'm protecting you.<eos> Like I would any of my detectives.
Oh. Oh, you don't need to do that.<eos> I know we don't need to, but maybe I want to support you and your amazing work.<eos> - And Max would enjoy. the free wine.<eos> - Yes, I would.<eos> Oh, I would.
He did a nickel at elmira for aggravated assault... got out a few years ago.<eos> He's still got his work uniform on, so let's see if anyone at go quick towing - knows how he wound up here. - Let's go.<eos> He wasn't on the job, I can tell you that.<eos> We didn't have any pickups out that way, so I don't know what he was doing there.<eos> Well, who would?
Once a year, she just lets that girly freak flag fly. Yeah!<eos> And you're gonna do it at her house, right?<eos> Actually, I was thinking about a bar.<eos> I doubt she wants to be ambushed at her house.<eos> No-no-no-no, she absolutely would.
Lisa's in a bad place.<eos> You know how sensitive she is.<eos> We don't want her to go back to...<eos> Tailee.<eos> No, she wouldn't.
How would you like it if I interrupted you all the time?<eos> I could've been friends with anybody--<eos> Janey, Sherri, Terri, You wouldn't like it all, would you?<eos> Hubert Wong, Wendy Wang.<eos> No, you wouldn't.
I'm just really nervous.<eos> I did something horrible.<eos> So did most of the people in this room.<eos> Do you think she's gonna ask about the money?<eos> I would.
Would you like to maybe hang out sometime?<eos> Wait, really?<eos> Yeah, yeah, I mean, you'd really want to?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I would.
Or my brother.<eos> No, but...<eos> I imagine you would like to see him again.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I would.
Not in your brain, in your head.<eos> Your direct line to the machine.<eos> The cochlear implant.<eos> Your little girlfriend told us all about it.<eos> She would never...
He's doped-up like a Tijuana drug mule.<eos> Just in case. Happy, would you mind keeping an eye on Ralph for a few hours?<eos> Not if he doesn't mind getting his butt kicked in Constructo-Battle.<eos> You want to babysit with me?<eos> Of course I would.
He's a nice guy and I like him, but he came with the wrong girl.<eos> I know you think you don't belong in my world... but I don't like my world without you in it.<eos> I'll wait for you.<eos> Would every night truly be like this?<eos> It would.
Senior's back from his little European wingding.<eos> He sounds rejuvenated.<eos> And... he wants to meet Zoe.<eos> She want to meet him?<eos> Why wouldn't she?
I'm gonna tell them I got in an argument with her?<eos> Tell me.<eos> Windi was upset about the guy that was bothering her.<eos> I wanted her to tell me his name.<eos> She wouldn't.
Kimye will look the same on your phone, your smart pad, and your computer.<eos> What's Kimye?<eos> Kanye and Kim?<eos> Yeah, right.<eos> You wouldn't, uh...
Stop.<eos> Let me finish it, Raphael.<eos> It's been too long.<eos> For Olivia and Daniel.<eos> You wouldn't?
I don't think that people are born bad.<eos> I think it's their choices that make them who they are.<eos> I think sometimes people convince themselves that doing something bad is okay.<eos> - What if I do that?<eos> - You would never.
I'd like to bring him in, you know, ask him a few questions, just check his temperature.<eos> Without Jay knowing why you're bringing Will in?<eos> That's correct.<eos> You want to ambush Will.<eos> [sighs] Well, I wouldn't...
Ake, ake, ake, amine.<eos> Amen. And we also give thanks for the safe return of Aumea.<eos> May the journey she is about to embark upon be as blessed as the union from which she came.<eos> Why would anyone want to kill her?<eos> They wouldn't.
We're gonna have to open her up.<eos> Listen, you could find a doctor to perform 20 operations on that leg, and it wouldn't change a thing.<eos> Well, there's only one way to find out.<eos> I know you want to fight for this.<eos> And I would, too.
I don't, um...<eos> God, it would save us so much trouble.<eos> The 12-page resumes and the phone calls and the polite vetting and...<eos> Who would want to be chief?<eos> Would you?
Everything we have...<eos> Is invested in Academy Green.<eos> Yeah, I know.<eos> Neil said.<eos> He wouldn't.
I mean, er, congratulations.<eos> So, you think I should go?<eos> No!<eos> I mean...<eos> Yes, ah, why wouldn't you?
Should we head back down?<eos> Will you just admit that I'm right?<eos> That marriage can work?<eos> I never said marriage couldn't work.<eos> Just that yours wouldn't.
600 bucks.<eos> I saved it from my quinceanera and my allowance.<eos> But, I want you to have it...<eos> So you can get a car that moms will approve.<eos> Uh, why would you...
I'm fine.<eos> Why do you want to rebuild the portal, Jemma?<eos> I saw the schematics, the data, the astronomical research you've been doing, and I just can't understand it.<eos> After everything you've been through...<eos> - Why would you ...
No one is trying to kill you, Mr. President, except the Caliphate.<eos> It's been a terrible day.<eos> I just wonder who you're crying for.<eos> What?<eos> Why would you...?
But is this truly proof?<eos> Excuse Paul.<eos> He's a lawyer.<eos> I am not unaware that, for some Americans, there's a sense of victory in deceiving the Japanese.<eos> Mr. Kasoura, I would never...
Is it possible?<eos> Mr. Bills go toward...<eos> The North Kaibe the planet.<eos> I felt the same.<eos> But why would Mr. Bills behind Goku?
Of course, they're down for hours.<eos> I was just noting his chart.<eos> You want to take it over?<eos> I'm slammed anyway.<eos> Thanks. I would.
So forgive him or not, don't antagonize him.<eos> There's still a chance you could get out of this.<eos> Good morning, everyone.<eos> Harvey, before we vote, would you like to say something?<eos> I would.
You still think I'm your bad guy?<eos> You were on the runway, about to take off in the Skystormer.<eos> That doesn't exactly bode well for you.<eos> I told you.<eos> I would never...
She looks familiar.<eos> Oh, no. I'm not going out with someone you already slept with.<eos> No, from something else.<eos> Definitely didn't sleep with her. Not that I wouldn't.<eos> I totally would.
Which isn't bad, but anything that you wipe your mouth on gets thrown away.<eos> Okay, enough about the napkin.<eos> What else you hiding in there?<eos> Wouldn't you like to know?<eos> I would.
If I can't take a shot to the junk for something I believe in, why am I even here?<eos> I've lost the thread of this conversation.<eos> There's got to be something you want to do that Mom and Dad won't let you.<eos> Well, I would like to walk home from the library at night by myself.<eos> Of course you would.
I've lost the thread of this conversation.<eos> There's got to be something you want to do that Mom and Dad won't let you.<eos> Well, I would like to walk home from the library at night by myself.<eos> Of course you would.<eos> What 13-year-old loser wouldn't?
He's putting out feelers.<eos> If you could go to his house for the holiday...<eos> I mean, would I like to go to the Chan's?<eos> Would I like to be surrounded by the unconditional love of a hundred Filipinos?<eos> Of course I would.
And I have good eyes.<eos> Good eyes.<eos> You didn't... you didn't find it because you knew where to look?<eos> No.<eos> How would I?
Talented?<eos> I was gonna say "odd," but sure.<eos> I mean, would you also peg him as...<eos> Sexually frustrated?<eos> Yes, I would.
It would be even better if you lived closer to Max, you know?<eos> We could...<eos> We could do this all the time.<eos> Right, I'm sure Max would just love that.<eos> Oh, he would.
Sit. It's okay.<eos> Do you hate me?<eos> - Not ever?<eos> Not ever.<eos> Because I would.
Whoa!<eos> - Are you kidding?<eos> - No.<eos> Sure...<eos> Yeah, we would.
- Oh, God, no.<eos> No, no, no, no, no.<eos> I couldn't.<eos> I'm married.<eos> I would never...
She was very happy that day.<eos> She asked me to say "I love you."<eos> I didn't.<eos> She wanted me to marry her.<eos> I wouldn't.
- Pretty easy, huh?<eos> - Not too bad.<eos> Now get off.<eos> Would you wear this suit tomorrow for me?<eos> Of course I would.
What would they look like?<eos> What would they look like?<eos> Thieves, killers, pulluleraient nerds, the world would be ablaze.<eos> - What's left?<eos> - It would ... the crippled and crazy houses.
- I mean those who ...<eos> - I have nothing to do.<eos> I wanted to say the same thing, and you leave me morality and conscience.<eos> - I had trouble expressing myself.<eos> - He would not ...
Not really.<eos> Does he love you?<eos> He says he does.<eos> He only said it once.<eos> Why wouldn't he?
A verbal taunt does not fulfill the protocol for self-defense, Sheriff, only a life-threatening act.<eos> And these little men aren't what I'd consider to be threatening.<eos> Fuck you, O.J.<eos> I do believe I now feel threatened.<eos> I would.
The cards will show the way.<eos> All right, well, let's see what else Madame Dooriya has to say.<eos> How many bags did we bring?<eos> Madame D really wouldn't like this.<eos> No, she really, really wouldn't.
If that's what you feel you need to do.<eos> Babe, it's the National Gallery.<eos> I mean, this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.<eos> You wouldn't expect me not to take the job just because you changed your mind.<eos> I wouldn't.
Twelve years of wine and eau-de-vie.<eos> I will not go over Celorico.<eos> You do not know the delightful story that I had with my mother.<eos> After finishing my studies at Coimbra, I wanted to settle in Lisbon with a nice pocket money monthly.<eos> She would not.
Call her.<eos> And say what?<eos> If Joe were alive, we would know.<eos> Would we?<eos> You would.
Hey. - You sure you're ok? - Yeah.<eos> - You sure? - Yeah.<eos> Would you be better if I kissed you?<eos> - That's cheesy!<eos> - But would you?
You'll trust no one and spend the rest of eternity alone.<eos> I'm afraid you're trapped.<eos> Boundary spell.<eos> The Originals can enter, but they can't leave.<eos> You wouldn't.
Do you say that to all the new nurses?<eos> No, of course not.<eos> I was only teasing.<eos> I know you wouldn't do that.<eos> Because I wouldn't.
You come into my pod and accuse my mother of mutiny?<eos> - Castor said that she and the pilot...<eos> - Enough about Castor!<eos> Nox was smart enough not to blindly trust him.<eos> - Why the hell would you?
You're a good-looking dude, don't you think?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I think I'm a good-looking guy, you know?<eos> But I'm not objective, so...<eos> On the good-looking scale, what would you...
And, by the way, I like watches.<eos> That's a nice watch you're wearing.<eos> Oh. Well, you see, it's new.<eos> Now, if I flipped it over, I wouldn't see an engraving, "Cristal Kenny"<eos> on the back, would I?
Hey, Threepeat, how you doing?<eos> I know you wanted that Hong Kong office pretty bad.<eos> You know, it's okay.<eos> I mean, would I really wanna leave my friends and family, move to a strange country, work seven days a week, and have absolutely no social life?<eos> Of course I would.
- And you're gonna kick ass.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> So we'll just do the long-distance thing, right?<eos> Yeah, I'll probably see more of you on Skype<eos> - ...than I would in Hong Kong.
Delphine just sent me Rachel's itinerary.<eos> So, we know where she's gonna be?<eos> And we know where Sarah's gonna be.<eos> In 16 days, when you begin to ovulate, we would like to harvest your eggs.<eos> - You would?
But I don't know what to do, B.<eos> If we let you have the surgery and it causes more damage, are you gonna blame us when you're older because we let you make this decision when you were only 16?<eos> And if we don't, are we getting in the way of your dream?<eos> - I would never blame you.<eos> - But I would.
IT'S...<eos> - I COULD COME BY LATER...<eos> MOVE IT WHEREVER YOU LIKE.<eos> - OH...<eos> I WOULD.
- Yeah. We say it like it is.<eos> So if I did want to run, why would I just step aside for you?<eos> See, that's what I'm talking about.<eos> - Why wouldn't you?<eos> - No, why would I?
I don't know.<eos> Six months ago, maybe.<eos> Oh, around the time that he disappeared off his boat?<eos> No, it had nothing to do with that.<eos> - Karen, I would never...
It can't be over.<eos> We turned down a half a million dollar settlement to fight.<eos> You're... you're just giving up?<eos> No, I'm not giving up, Lee Anne.<eos> I would never.
No one says grass.<eos> I never said grass.<eos> It's not that crazy an idea.<eos> We weren't smoking anything.<eos> Manny would never.
- Obviously, you idiot!<eos> ! - Kidnapping!<eos> It's a kidnapping, it's a kidnapping to kidnap me, Cherlene!<eos> - Why would bikers want to kidnap you?<eos> - Why would anyone?
So let me bounce this off you<eos> - guys...<eos> - What say we don't launch this giant nerve gas missile at, uh... where did you say you were launching it?<eos> Wouldn't you like to know?<eos> I would, actually.
Come on.<eos> I second Marshall's vow.<eos> I will never, ever get that drunk again.<eos> Yeah.<eos> She would.
Unfortunately yeah, she was married.<eos> Sure, I wanted to kill the guy.<eos> I thought about, chopping his head off.<eos> Draining him of every drop of blood that he had.<eos> Who wouldn't?
Because I know your next plan is to kill me.<eos> To remove the largest obstacle and hasten things along.<eos> A stray arrow, a hunting accident.<eos> - I wouldn't dare.<eos> - Yes, you would.
Who'd you rather bang, Valdes or Frankie?<eos> - Frankie don't take dick.<eos> - I know!<eos> But let's just say she does.<eos> Or she would.
Because none of this seems normal to me.<eos> You know, I have the best of both worlds, Uh, being a father and an agent.<eos> - But why couldn't you tell me?<eos> Because you would have wanted to meet him.<eos> - Hells yeah I would.
- Because of what you feel?<eos> I've felt something before for someone on my team.<eos> It seems foolish now.<eos> I would die for you.<eos> Any man would.
In there.<eos> That's why I'm standing guard.<eos> Would not want Sif to get out and hurt Lorelei.<eos> Ah.<eos> Of course we wouldn't.
I was trying to protect her.<eos> But she didn't want your protection, did she?<eos> She was always very honest.<eos> You know, she said I'd pay for it.<eos> That we all would.
Okay, there's no easy way to say this, so I'm just gonna rip the band-aid right off.<eos> There's something going on between Karma and Liam.<eos> What?<eos> No.<eos> Karma and Liam, she would never...
Maybe I could've saved her. At least just-- Just been here for her when it happened or something.<eos> Hey.<eos> You can't blame yourself.<eos> And I'm sure if she were here right now, your mama would tell you the same thing.<eos> No, she wouldn't.
If you do, the GTF can take down the Metas, and Daniel, Silvia and the rest of the family can be saved.<eos> What are you gonna do about Chapel's daughter?<eos> Everything okay with you and Ryan?<eos> If you would ever like to talk, I'm here.<eos> Yeah, I would.
What I wanted... to say to you... is that nobody should have to go through what you went through.<eos> Nobody.<eos> And if that guy shows up here again, I'd say it to his face.<eos> I'd like to see that.<eos> I really would.
You're smart and you're able to think ahead, so you can imagine what will happen when she wakes up, tied up, with us here.<eos> She'll think we did it.<eos> No, no, we'll explain to her how we rescued her--<eos> And she won't believe it.<eos> No one would.
A couple hours.<eos> You know, I think she freaked out when she realized how late it was.<eos> You know, Elias said that's why she made up that whole story anyways.<eos> How could they say it was consensual?<eos> I would never...
But that rang hollow.<eos> You're a pal.<eos> So you think that Stahma...<eos> She wouldn't dare.<eos> No, she wouldn't.
See? See?<eos> Thank you.<eos> Tucker gets it.<eos> But... but aren't you the one who's always saying innocent until proven guilty?<eos> No. Why would I...
It's nonsense.<eos> I don't know that man.<eos> I had a few drinks, I paid my bill, and I was at home on the phone with my husband by 8:00 P.M.<eos> Okay, so, then if we got a warrant to search your car, we wouldn't find any of Mr. Strauss' hair or fluids... you know, DNA?<eos> No, you wouldn't.
I want to finish what we started.<eos> I'm thinkin' me, you, and a weekend at my mansion in Monte Carlo.<eos> Oh, Cuban, that sounds incredible, but I'm working a flight to Miami which leaves in ten minutes.<eos> Unless... my new friends Stan and Francine could cover for me.<eos> Would you...?
[ Gasps ] How does she like it?<eos> I mean, based on the t-shirts I've seen, people seem to really love that place.<eos> Why wouldn't you introduce us?<eos> - I didn't know you'd want to meet her.<eos> - Well, of course I would!
Pick up those clothes, please?<eos> "A small company... no one expected it to be anything evolved into something great, something magnificent."<eos> You gonna tell us how the booth looks?<eos> Is anyone coming?<eos> I would.
Lexi Steele.<eos> Lexi Steele's my wife.<eos> How about I offer you 20 grand to fuck your wife?<eos> You gonna take that deal?<eos> No, I wouldn't.
Just now. I heard you.<eos> Look, all I meant was I loved Paris... the food, the wine.<eos> And by the way, I don't think you gained any weight.<eos> Why would you bring that up?<eos> I wouldn't.
How could I do that?<eos> Luke's dead-set against it.<eos> Hmm.<eos> Would you mind if I talked to him?<eos> Yes, I would.
All we want is an entire day where you thank us with go-karts and maybe a cotton candy machine and may...<eos> I was thinking maybe, like, the goo goo dolls could perform, and I could sing Iris with them onstage.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Personally, I don't want the world to see me, 'cause I don't think they'd understand.<eos> They wouldn't.
Did Steve stay home every night?<eos> No, he was undercover.<eos> Had to be gone a lot.<eos> Did he wear a ring?<eos> No, why would he?
Okay. Follow my lead.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> My fiancee and I would like to get married.<eos> - Really?<eos> - Yes! We would.
I had a tiny room.<eos> I'm happy.<eos> I feel good here.<eos> I'm not surprised.<eos> I would too.
Why would I do that?<eos> Because if you don't, I'm going to open up the back of my colleague's van here and let two wild animals chew up half your clientele.<eos> How does that sound?<eos> You wouldn't dare.<eos> He would.
Astounded at the charity you've shown my child, but if I wish to see her, is that not a father's right?<eos> Why, in particular, do you wish to see her, Reverend?<eos> Were you perhaps considering another exorcism?<eos> Do your days grow dull, lacking a child to beat and torture and the nights far too lonely with no daughter to visit?<eos> - I would never...
Then he just disappeared.<eos> Last anyone saw of him, he was hoppin' the Union Pacific Line with all of his possessions in a sock.<eos> Well, thanks for looking out for me, Dad.<eos> I sure wouldn't want to end up like Tony Lura.<eos> No, you wouldn't, son.
And the spectacle, the carnage...<eos> - Botched display of his prowess.<eos> - Does he honestly think that Francis and I would agree to have our marriage annulled?<eos> It's ridiculous!<eos> Even he wouldn't.
She is, God bless her, beautiful like the moon.<eos> You should consider it.<eos> "<eos> -He wouldn't accept." "<eos> -Exactly, he wouldn't."
Oh, I found it, abandoned, windows busted out.<eos> Well, then there's a mistake.<eos> It's gotta be a different house.<eos> Or you had me chasing ghosts to get me out of town.<eos> Why would...
I appreciate the positive affirmations and looking the other way on the perversion, but I know empirically and definitively I cannot survive on my own.<eos> - I cannot. - So you killed the bus?<eos> If I don't cure the disease, if I don't save the world, I have no value.<eos> - That's not how it works. - If I don't fix things, there's no way you people would keep me around, share resources, even protect me.<eos> Of course we would.
Ma'am?<eos> You got to "Ma'am" me tonight?<eos> I wasn't trying to.<eos> We need to go ahead and close up, if you don't mind.<eos> Why would I?
If there were survivors, we will bring them in, too.<eos> You have my word.<eos> I want to see my people.<eos> Of course you do.<eos> I would, too.
Although you and I both have excellent reason to find that weapon.<eos> I want it to protect my family, and you want it to protect your friends.<eos> We'd do well to forget our grievances and join forces.<eos> No.<eos> - Davina, would you just... - No.
I'm gonna go meet my buddies in town.<eos> We're kind of down here for one last hurrah.<eos> But...<eos> Do you want to swap numbers?<eos> I would...
To their home...<eos> They don't bring me to their home.<eos> I'm confused, this morning you were mad at me.<eos> No, I wouldn't call that mad.<eos> Okay, I really would.
To their home...<eos> They don't bring me to their home.<eos> I'm confused, this morning you were mad at me.<eos> No, I wouldn't call that mad.<eos> Okay, I really would.
Your time with the whore's whore-friend.<eos> Sanctioned by the Khan of Khans.<eos> You alerted the Song to our pending attack.<eos> You conspired to lead us into the slaughter.<eos> What need would they of warning?
We saved you dinner.<eos> Wow, that was really sweet.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Maybe you'd like a... (quietly) drink?<eos> (quietly): Yeah, I would.
Well, my butt looks great, and my friends are douches. [Chuckles]<eos> I just can't believe that...<eos> Oh, God.<eos> Why would Oz want to make Hank look bad?<eos> Why would anyone?
We're getting the most effective treatments we've ever had, and it's all because you asked nicely.<eos> You think I'm stupid?<eos> Tell me you weren't behind the breach that almost killed Maya.<eos> I wasn't.<eos> Dad, I wouldn't...
Come on, Carters, you gotta come.<eos> - Dad, let's go, come on.<eos> - Yeah, Dad, let's go.<eos> Kids, your dad already made plans.<eos> Yes... or we would.
Your daughter's nine years old.<eos> Let's revisit this in ten years.<eos> No, trust me, I will now.<eos> You know what?<eos> You probably would.
- This is the "better".<eos> Would you like to discuss the work conditions?<eos> - Is there Social Security?<eos> - Would you like that?<eos> - Who wouldn't?
Well, now that we know Wu is A.R.G.U.S., maybe Lyla can get us a lead?<eos> If this an A.R.G.U.S. thing, Lyla's going to want it to stay that way.<eos> Then tell her to stop letting people get killed in my city.<eos> You really don't care about my marriage, do you?<eos> Well, I would...
Thanks for this.<eos> We need to talk about Maggie Pierce.<eos> The e-mail said for professional and personal reasons.<eos> Now, you know what that could be?<eos> - Well, why would I?
- Bailey's was better. - Well, that's great.<eos> Alex, you would make a fine board member, but Bailey will make an exceptional one.<eos> Is that what you want me to do... vote for you to be good, to be fine?<eos> You want my pity vote?<eos> I wouldn't.
How could you let her do this to me, Finch-- tranq me like I'm some kind of animal?<eos> It was for your own good, Ms. Shaw.<eos> You are no longer safe from Samaritan's gaze, and you wouldn't listen to reason.<eos> He's right, Sam.<eos> You really wouldn't.
Looks like one in particular might have recorded our crime scene last night.<eos> I don't want to get caught in skinhead on skinhead violence.<eos> I don't want them coming for me.<eos> Look. I'll look back through the footage myself and let you know.<eos> As soon as possible, if you would.
I was lost.<eos> I always felt like I saw things ... Differently. Saw things other people didn't.<eos> I never said anything.<eos> I didn't wanna be different.<eos> Who would?
- That's easy.<eos> Billions of pounds and my own personal hit man. And a Court waiver over anything I want to do.<eos> - Really?<eos> - Um-hm.<eos> I'd...
Yeah. May I show you something very, very, very incredible?<eos> Yeah, of course!<eos> For my daughter.<eos> Wow. You think she will love it?<eos> Yeah, well, who wouldn't?
Yeah, of course!<eos> For my daughter.<eos> Wow. You think she will love it?<eos> Yeah, well, who wouldn't?<eos> Yeah? Who wouldn't?
- Really.<eos> Uh...<eos> - Excuse me.<eos> - I just want to get my stuff.<eos> - Would you just... - Hey.
He's probably wondering right now what I'm thinking.<eos> What my plan is.<eos> And how much I know.<eos> Wouldn't you be wondering what I'm thinking?<eos> I would.
This is intolerable. Eh?<eos> What are you hiding?<eos> Who are the Big Four?<eos> Well, it seems that everyone wants to be here tonight.<eos> And why wouldn't they?
- No.<eos> - That's not...<eos> - No.<eos> No.<eos> I wouldn't...
Whichever one means they know I'm here and they're totally cool with it.<eos> What's your home number, Edmund. Now!<eos> 049-157-0158.<eos> They're never going to let me set foot outside the apartment again, are they?<eos> I wouldn't.
For a woman just out of mourning, no.<eos> Of course, I... I don't want to impose.<eos> You would never be an imposition.<eos> Livvy would love the company.<eos> We all would.
Erm, but this is your home too and you'd be more than welcome to come back here.<eos> I'd like that.<eos> We'd like that.<eos> Well, I'd like it very much.<eos> We would.
I was coming?<eos> Yes, you came.<eos> Why?<eos> Because then I would leave.<eos> You would pro hairdresser, or what?
Uh, how would you describe the mental state of your patient, Thomas Grey, in the weeks leading up to his death?<eos> I would say he was accepting of what was about to come.<eos> Really?<eos> Do most people accept that they're dying?<eos> 'Cause I sure as hell wouldn't.
Do I seem different?<eos> You're a little different, but you've always been a little different.<eos> Brilliant strategy... that way no one ever knows if something's up with you.<eos> How would I know if something was up with you?<eos> You wouldn't.
But, if you must know, I traverse the globe.<eos> In the company of musicians.<eos> You're a groupie.<eos> I prefer muse.<eos> Sure, who wouldn't?
An offer better received from the men themselves.<eos> They've withdrawn to a villa on the outskirts of Nuceria, within short ride of what remains of their legion to the north.<eos> Spartacus continues to gather force in the valley of Campania.<eos> You know I would not have come if situation did not demand of it.<eos> No. You would not.
And I know you'd like to know what I know.<eos> - What would I like to know?<eos> - Wouldn't you like to know?<eos> - I would like to know.<eos> - Yeah, you would, wouldn't ya?
♪ It would be to show me how you feel ♪<eos> BOTH: ♪ More than words ♪<eos> ♪ Is all you have to do ♪<eos> ♪ To make it real ♪<eos> ♪ Then you wouldn't ♪
I was wondering if you would not talk to me in that tone.<eos> Oh!<eos> Yes, of course!<eos> That's a little different.<eos> I wouldn't. Why would I?
Yeah, and it's funny that she's jogging, 'cause when we first met, I was the one who was running.<eos> (Rooster clucking)<eos> But I was so struck by her beauty that I had to stop.<eos> (Siren wailing) Hey, you want a free fighting rooster? Ah!<eos> Who wouldn't?
That brings up a good point.<eos> At the airport, you were in arrivals, not departures.<eos> You were there to meet your employer, weren't you?<eos> Uh, Kate, I wouldn't... (Slams door)<eos> Yes, I would.
That kind of anger is earned.<eos> Right now, I'm more concerned about the chip.<eos> Chip?<eos> Your son has a tracer chip in him, right?<eos> I wouldn't...
What she said about... a bomb and you wanting to hurt people...<eos> I don't want to lie to you.<eos> So you were gonna do those things?<eos> But I didn't.<eos> And I wouldn't now.
He's always wanted a pair of riding pants?<eos> His toenails need a new coat of shellack?<eos> He wants to floss twice a day instead of just once?<eos> I think what Gummy is trying to say is that he'd like a little Spike time.<eos> Who wouldn't?
No, no, no.<eos> Um, Velcro straps and plastic sockets aren't exactly sexy, and I wanted this evening to be all about sexy, so I think that I need to take the leg off myself.<eos> And I need you not to watch.<eos> Oh, you want me to go in the bathroom until your leg's off and you're under the covers?<eos> Would you?
I'm over her.<eos> If you want to go out with her, go for it.<eos> I'm not going out with her.<eos> No, but you want to.<eos> Who wouldn't?
You know what? (Paper rustles)<eos> Here.<eos> I think Marty would've wanted you to have these.<eos> I don't suppose you'd want to take Marty with you?<eos> I would, but...
I saw the gathering of trunks.<eos> She goes with you?<eos> It was her intent.<eos> Yet I would find no comfort in her presence.<eos> As I would in yours...
It was Peter who convinced him to talk to me.<eos> What?<eos> I don't...<eos> I don't understand.<eos> - Why would he...
Sancorp does not want a pro-nuclear businessman in the White House.<eos> The market is shifting toward natural gas anyway.<eos> But Tusk wants to stall that shift or reverse it.<eos> Vice President doesn't have that kind of influence.<eos> This one would.
And I understand.<eos> I did, too.<eos> I loved your granddad very much.<eos> But if I didn't move forward, I never would have studied law, I wouldn't have become a judge.<eos> I wouldn't...
The men who beat you up were wrong.<eos> And we were wrong.<eos> You didn't molest Angelica.<eos> You didn't molest Sofia.<eos> No, I would never--
Love doesn't last long, does it?<eos> - Have you seen your sister?<eos> - Not in a week.<eos> - Is she coming?<eos> - Why wouldn't she?
And now he's going to stay with me.<eos> I mean, he'll, he'll always look after me.<eos> I didn't come home when father died.<eos> You couldn't get leave.<eos> You'd only just...
What?<eos> I'm asking you to kill the lamb you see before you.<eos> Clearly, you doubt me.<eos> On the contrary. I believe in your goodness.<eos> Then why would y-
Tell us the truth.<eos> All of it, not bits, not pieces, all.<eos> Or I leave.<eos> Would you at least like to sit down first, Becky? No, Jessica.<eos> I fucking wouldn't.
We got ourselves into this.<eos> You can't even cook anymore.<eos> "Baby, baby, baby".<eos> - Do you want me to end it with Flo?<eos> - Would you?
I sucked his cock, just like you told me to.<eos> I never said that.<eos> I-i never said that.<eos> Nina, Jesus...<eos> I-I-i wouldn't.
[Damon grunting]<eos> [Groans]<eos> Something bothering you?<eos> Would you believe me if I said mosquitoes?<eos> Oh, aye, I would.
Sarah had a controlling interest in the company,<eos> - but now all her shares are sold to Jen.<eos> - Sarah didn't want to sell.<eos> She didn't get a chance to sign the deal memo.<eos> Or maybe she wouldn't.
It must be a bloody hard job running this place.<eos> You have no idea.<eos> How do you relax?<eos> I have my ways.<eos> Would you...
She's a genius.<eos> Oh, really?<eos> I think that kid stole this kid's idea and she should probably get a lawyer.<eos> Oh, he wouldn't dare.<eos> Oh, he would.
Come back!<eos> (barking)<eos> - Bitsy!<eos> - Maybe he doesn't like wearing clothes.<eos> With that body, I wouldn't either. (growls)
You came here, you got this incredible apartment for you and your daughter, you started your own business.<eos> You showed me how to be an independent woman.<eos> And now I've got green in the bank and a black friend named Rocky.<eos> I don't ever want to go back to the way things were.<eos> Why would you?
Do I look fit of mind and body?<eos> And don't get me started on the self-abuse chapter.<eos> FREDDIE: For real.<eos> What grown man would actually want to live by these principles?<eos> I would.
And don't get me started on the self-abuse chapter.<eos> FREDDIE: For real.<eos> What grown man would actually want to live by these principles?<eos> I would.<eos> David would.
Good news is you're both here, which means neither of you killed Eileen.<eos> That's off to a reasonably good start.<eos> Gentlemen, please don't even think about it.<eos> E-Eileen would want you two to be making peace.<eos> Like hell she would.
- Hey, buddy.<eos> If you want Sonia to like you, you may wanna update some of your moves.<eos> Maybe you can help Danny.<eos> You are very good with women.<eos> Yeah, would you, Ryan?
And I...<eos> Forgive me, Jesus.<eos> I was so weak.<eos> What me and Bonnie done, those we stole from and the laws, they'd probably tell things different.<eos> Hell, even Bonnie, sure she would, too.
No.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> For once, I would like to know where I'm going.<eos> No.<eos> You really wouldn't.
They think that you snuck some home, used one of your perfectly legal needles to kill your cheating girlfriend.<eos> Look, I'm not denying that we had troubles, but I would never hurt Mia.<eos> You need to believe me.<eos> I'd like to.<eos> I really would, Ben.
Lord Aysgarth, I'm modern.<eos> I don't hanker for those days before the war.<eos> And I don't really want to spend the rest of my life among people who think me loud and opinionated and common.<eos> But I assure you, they wouldn't.<eos> Ah, yes, they would.
Especially since I'm about to win.<eos> B-But we didn't finish.<eos> Exactly.<eos> How does that make you feel?<eos> The same way any normal person would.
♪ ♪ It's Jess. ♪ It was after prom.<eos> ♪ Who's that girl?<eos> Cece and I were both 18, and we'd rented a hotel room.<eos> So... would you like to freak?<eos> Yes, I would.
You shouldn't be here.<eos> No, Nick.<eos> You shouldn't be here.<eos> I'd like you to go.<eos> No. You wouldn't.
As a knockout.<eos> I would.<eos> What?<eos> You asked me before if I'd do it again.<eos> I would.
Yeah, if I get it.<eos> I haven't gotten it yet.<eos> Company's been trying to poach you for years.<eos> They'd be lucky to have you.<eos> Yeah, they would.
They'd be lucky to have you.<eos> Yeah, they would.<eos> - Yeah--listen to you!<eos> - No, they w--<eos> Well, they would!
No charges will be filed.<eos> He's in the holding area.<eos> All right, well, before they release him and he runs off again,<eos> I would really like to speak with him.<eos> Yeah, so would I.
People do this all the time.<eos> And besides, I think... your mom might like to have Boyd a couple nights a week.<eos> Oh, it would make mom happy, huh?<eos> - She'd love it.<eos> She really would.
It's Rudy!<eos> It's just Rudy!<eos> I'm Ghostbusters, he's Ghostbusters II, and everybody knows Ghostbusters II was a right piece of shit.<eos> I quite liked it.<eos> You fucking would, wouldn't you?
For me. You know?<eos> But that's a good question.<eos> I don't know why some women can...<eos> I've sometimes thought it would be easier, if I didn't want these kids so much, you know what I mean?<eos> - It would.
I want to revisit our earlier one.<eos> This is our earlier one.<eos> Come on, you know you've thought about it.<eos> Yeah, I think about a lot of things.<eos> And you would.
Really?<eos> Haskell, I'm sorry, I can't leave Holly alone tonight.<eos> Would you mind taking a rain check?<eos> - Well, I...<eos> - Of course he wouldn't.
No.<eos> Nothing yet.<eos> That's disappointing.<eos> I can keep looking if you like.<eos> Would you, please?
Even if you have the baby, and it... and it looks like a little Greg with a little hat and everything, I'm not going anywhere.<eos> I'll stand here forever if I have to because I love you and I don't ever wanna be without you.<eos> Ever.<eos> Will you marry me?<eos> But would you?
We need the stockholders to get excited about this new direction that I'm taking.<eos> It's a focus on fresh, new talent.<eos> It's a focus that you inspired, by the way.<eos> You know, I would love to reschedule...<eos> I really would... For them.
She could have had a political career of her own.<eos> I'll be right there.<eos> Jeannine, thank you so much for agreeing to meet me.<eos> Mrs. Grant, I just wanted to tell you that I didn't.<eos> I would never.
I guess I'm just having a hard time believing that you were scared.<eos> I think you knew that my curse would kick in and save me.<eos> I really...<eos> I don't know the first thing about it.<eos> But Audrey Parker would.
Lou Mrozek was the most honorable man I've ever known.<eos> And yet after 27 years of honesty, hard work, and commitment,<eos> Karsten had no problem believing that your husband, Lou, embezzled a million dollars from the company.<eos> That's why Lou did the right thing and he went to the feds, and that's why Karsten sent T.J. to take care of him.<eos> No, T.J. would never --
I'm very proud of you, son.<eos> Maybe I haven't given you enough responsibility.<eos> I'm gonna fix that.<eos> You'd like that, wouldn't you?<eos> Yeah, I would.
I've got nothing to say to you.<eos> But I gotta say this to you.<eos> I did not hurt Tara.<eos> I didn't cause that miscarriage.<eos> - I would never...
What would I have to do?<eos> Would I have less dignity than a field mouse?<eos> Oh, good Lord, no.<eos> I'm not a monster.<eos> I would just...
What is that?<eos> Oh. It's like a Moroccan cigar, except you don't use as much upper body strength.<eos> A reverse bat cave is my favorite.<eos> - I love a King Henry.<eos> - Yeah, you would.
Look here.<eos> Neal stopped counting.<eos> 'Cause he got off the island.<eos> He was here longer.<eos> Then why would he...
- Hey, would you just mind your business?<eos> - I'm just trying to help.<eos> - Did I ask for your...<eos> - Stop!<eos> Mr. Pendrick, a real coroner would simply not

I mean, there must have been a change of plans 'cause it's happening, like, soon.<eos> That was so unfair.<eos> Tell me that you have a name.<eos> - All I asked you for was one thing, and you can't even do that?<eos> I wouldn't.
What was in it?<eos> Thracian Phiale.<eos> A ancient relic, allegedly protected by warlocks after Cromwell's conquest of Britain.<eos> Why would someone want something like that?<eos> You wouldn't.
Uh, hey, Jenny, do you have any idea how to get tear stains out of pillows?<eos> It's certainly not more tears, because I tried that.<eos> Have you tried spraying some desperate cry for attention on it?<eos> You want some coffee?<eos> Why, yes, I would.
"Do that again, you're gonna find out where else my glass slipper fits."<eos> Is it weird that that turns me on?<eos> Is it weird that's why I told you?<eos> So, hey, would you girls like a little more champagne?<eos> Oh, I would!
- Did you...<eos> - Stop.<eos> - Did you? - No. Okay?<eos> - Why not?<eos> - Because I wouldn't.
What the heck?<eos> So annoying.<eos> Cha Eun Sang has her hands on Chan Young now?<eos> - Just break up!<eos> - Why would we?
I mean, how do you think this makes me look?<eos> Because why?<eos> Because you have a hunch?<eos> And what would you have said if I'd called?<eos> I'd...
What?<eos> Really?<eos> Why not?<eos> I'd go to jail for you.<eos> No, you wouldn't.
Really?<eos> Why not?<eos> I'd go to jail for you.<eos> No, you wouldn't.<eos> Yes, I would.
Oh, mother.<eos> Are you sure you're not up to coming by for Christmas tomorrow?<eos> I know Freddie would love to see you.<eos> No, he wouldn't.
- On television, a falling Addy machine doesn't seem like it would hurt.<eos> In fact, it seems almost funny, but...<eos> Parker tragically discovered that life is not always like it is on TV.<eos> Would anyone care to share a few words?<eos> I would.
He's going for a check-up.<eos> Dr Cogan, he is still conscious, isn't he?<eos> He's fully conscious, Norma, yes.<eos> And he wouldn't want any of us worrying, now.<eos> Would he?
I should go because....<eos> Thank you so much for the half a beer and I'll see you at practice.<eos> Sure.<eos> If you did know me and you saw that ad, would you call?<eos> Yeah. I would.
Or maybe, just once, you could have, one time, just minded your own business, Ma.<eos> Maybe that could have happened.<eos> Look, I have Costco today, okay?<eos> I would appreciate it very much if we could just drive in silence until we get to Texas.<eos> I would...
I see.<eos> My bay the girl breezed this morning...<eos> I was wondering if your guy Jenkins would like to ride him.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> We sure as hell would, sir.
And, God, I hope I didn't make a mistake.<eos> I just want everything to be pretty.<eos> Would you like...<eos> Would you like me to take a look?<eos> Would you?
- Remember what?<eos> - Remember you.<eos> You would have an alibi, which means you didn't kill Christine Stanford.<eos> Kill Christine? Oh. I could...<eos> I would never...
I am yours.<eos> Maybe I should sleep downstairs tonight.<eos> Would you like that?<eos> Yes.<eos> I would.
I saw it in his eyes.<eos> Hated me.<eos> He never met me before, but he wanted to hurt me.<eos> - Of course he did.<eos> - Why? Why would a stranger--
I was raised to be Lord of Winterfell.<eos> I was raised to be a proper little lady, to play the harp and dance the latest steps and recite Valyrian poetry.<eos> I'd like to hear you play the harp.<eos> No.<eos> No, you would not.
I was a cock.<eos> You're not getting back in my pants, if that's what you think.<eos> It's not what I want.<eos> Charmed, I'm sure.<eos> Nah... I would.
Fired from a jack-off booth?<eos> Where the truckers go and masturbate. They're all along the interstate.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I know what you're talking about. Well? Would you?<eos> No. I would not.
You're a free man.<eos> I thought Sandy left things kinda open?<eos> Well, actually, I told Sandy that I would be here when she gets back.<eos> So I would like to be the kind of guy that sticks to his word.<eos> Yeah, we all would, man.
, I think I'm dying"?<eos> What if I'd opened that door ten minutes earlier?<eos> Or even five?<eos> Would it have made a difference?<eos> Well, would it?
- What's up?<eos> Well, I'm sorry, but Lennox is not a big fan of us going out together.<eos> Oh, I see.<eos> So you're saying we're gonna have to sneak around?<eos> No, I would never.
Squash.<eos> Henry.<eos> After the fight at the house, back at my dad's place...<eos> I wanted to... go find Alina, explain it to her.<eos> He wouldn't...
Henry.<eos> After the fight at the house, back at my dad's place...<eos> I wanted to... go find Alina, explain it to her.<eos> He wouldn't...<eos> He wouldn't...
If not for your dad, for rock 'n' roll.<eos> First of all, I don't owe my dad anything.<eos> He walked out on me.<eos> And I'm guessing you'd just like To get off the hook for all of this.<eos> Yeah, I would.
I haven't seen you in a while.<eos> Oh, I know.<eos> I've been so busy, helping Jackie plan the ceremony.<eos> You wouldn't believe how much work is involved.<eos> Oh, I would.
Hey, come in.<eos> I hope you don't mind.<eos> I was just in the neighborhood.<eos> Thought I'd stop by to see how you're feeling.<eos> No, why would I?
Some turkey sandwiches and Diet Double Dew. I Should Have Never Thought Horseback Riding<eos> Would Be Any Better Than Ziplining.<eos> This here waterfall is called Heartbreak Falls.<eos> Would you all like to know why it's called Heartbreak Falls?<eos> I certainly would!
Yes, it does, yeah.<eos> And another thing that it's curious about is:<eos> It's been two years since you came to your daughter's house.<eos> And you'd like to know why I'm here?<eos> Yeah, I really would.
Here's the aftereffect. Good.<eos> Can you tell who did it?<eos> No, but I can tell you where it was done.<eos> Would you like that?<eos> I would.
Would you like that?<eos> I would.<eos> This isn't one of those Columbo-like things where you keep me doing things for you, hoping I'll slip up?<eos> Because I'd rather just confess.<eos> I would rather that, too.
Well, I have inspected 2,934 toothbrushes, most of which were clean, as the soldiers use their button-brushes for their teeth, to keep their toothbrushes clean for inspections.<eos> So you betrayed me with a battalion!<eos> You want a brandy?<eos> I'll ring down.<eos> Rum and hot water, if you would. Of course.
- Just please try and rest?<eos> - Yeah, I'm good.<eos> (Coughing) Maybe we could step out?<eos> I'm going to need the names of the executives.<eos> Well, they wouldn't...
So, you know you're not making many friends down at the boardwalk.<eos> Been following Twitter feeds.<eos> There's a hell of a lot of complaining about some "dick detective who won't quit bugging Chef Lana."<eos> You don't think they'd ban me from the trucks?<eos> I would.
- You let Odi drive the car?<eos> - Odi's an excellent driver.<eos> - It could have killed someone.<eos> - "It"?<eos> - Odi would never...
Sweetie... why wouldn't you tell me?<eos> I guess I was afraid you'd veto it, like maybe you'd think me being here was invading your territory or--<eos> What?<eos> That's crazy.<eos> I wouldn't...
22,000... ish.<eos> My company adver-- used to advertise with that newspaper.<eos> And how am I angry and unlikable?<eos> Can I take this one?<eos> I wouldn't.
That's why you're reluctant to give us your DNA.<eos> You were afraid we were gonna connect you to Fred.<eos> Like I told you, he attacked me.<eos> I'd like to believe you, Dwayne.<eos> I really would.
But why?<eos> Why can't you do the surgery?<eos> Uh, the chief of surgery, Ellis Grey, will be doing the... it.<eos> Uh, I mean, I can.<eos> I would.
Defendant remanded to Rikers.<eos> Dad, dad, I'll get you out.<eos> After all I've done for you, you and your girlfriend turn against me.<eos> What?<eos> No, I'd never--
Still?<eos> Who cares?<eos> Right.<eos> I don't care.<eos> No one in their right mind would.
- You let Odi drive the car?<eos> - Odi's an excellent driver.<eos> - It could have killed someone.<eos> - "It"?<eos> - Odi would never...
If I give the police an excuse to blame this on our children, they might just do that.<eos> Why don't we just let this play itself out, see how it goes.<eos> Do you want Ben to go to prison for something he didn't do?<eos> He wouldn't last two minutes in prison.<eos> Oh, and Dylan would?
Mm-hmm.<eos> Would you like another glass of wine?<eos> Mm. [Snaps fingers]<eos> - Whoo!<eos> - Yes... I would.
But I am apologizing.<eos> You're new in his office, just like the woman I met.<eos> She was quite impressive.<eos> I bet you'd like to be impressive too.<eos> I would.
It's devastating what Lobell has done.<eos> I've known him for a long time, and I pegged him as a good guy.<eos> Well, I worked with him for 30 years.<eos> I want to break his neck.<eos> I would, too, son.
You show me the money first and then maybe I'll bite.<eos> You've got that look on your face.<eos> What have you been doing?<eos> Wouldn't you like to know.<eos> No, I wouldn't actually.
He knows his stuff with furniture and pictures.<eos> He'll walk into a saleroom and sniff out what everybody else has missed.<eos> He just knows... everything!<eos> Of course, he wants to make me suffer.<eos> What man wouldn't?
Never figured out it was me who set the damn thing off in the first place.<eos> Oh, you are the man.<eos> I love this guy.<eos> How much do you love this guy?<eos> Krueger would, too.
- Yeah.<eos> Um, we just feel it's really important not to put too many boundaries on foster.<eos> - Is that an approach that's...<eos> - yeah, it stifles his creativity.<eos> - Yeah, you wouldn't...
I thought there wasn't any surveillance footage of the victims' offices?<eos> There isn't, but I found a private security camera aimed at the building next to theirs.<eos> Thought I'd see if maybe the killer walked by.<eos> And how would you know if it was the killer?<eos> Probably wouldn't.
No, you cannot.<eos> And don't go too expensive... st somewhere where, you know, the spoon and the fork are two separate things.<eos> I mean, what was I gonna do, take you to Taco Bell and bowling?<eos> You wouldn't like that.<eos> Would you?
Come on, Dex.<eos> It's just you.<eos> You're the one who wants the arsonist dead.<eos> And I don't blame you.<eos> Who wouldn't?
Know what?<eos> You know.<eos> No, he doesn't.<eos> So don't say anything.<eos> As if I would.
I'm not your enemy, Carlos.<eos> And if the government wants to take charge of this investigation then I'm sure they have a good reason<eos> That wouldn't bother you?<eos> !<eos> Why would it?
Because you two need to learn to play a husband and wife believably.<eos> What does that have to do with Sushi?<eos> ! Listen, I once did a show where I had to play a man in great pain, so to prepare, I threw myself down a flight of stairs.<eos> You wouldn't believe how many times I hit my head.<eos> - Yeah, we would.

I have been eating a lot of soy lately.<eos> If it makes you feel any better, I really picked up the slack in there.<eos> That does not make me feel better.<eos> Would it help if I told you we could barely hear you yelling at your penis in the bathroom?<eos> It would not.
He didn't even want Giada and Michelle.<eos> We'll take 'em all three of 'em.<eos> I want our own kid.<eos> - Do you?<eos> - 'Course, I would.
Simmer down.<eos> Ms. Kaswell, while I find EVK's actions contemptible, I can't justify calling Mr. Kaswell a tenant.<eos> One minute, Your Honor.<eos> We would like to amend Mr. Kaswell's motion.<eos> We would?
If it was me, I'd get a little Japanese kid.<eos> They're smart, loyal and they don't bring their shoes in the house.<eos> Plus, they'll do your taxes, walk on your back and chauffeur your Green Hornet car.<eos> Are you telling me you wouldn't want to have your own little Kato?<eos> Of course, who wouldn't?
Knew what, mama?<eos> Ever since you made friends in fifth grade, you two can't stay mad at each other for more than a couple of days.<eos> You got time to stay for a cup of coffee?<eos> Love one.<eos> Yeah, you would.
Ever since you made friends in fifth grade, you two can't stay mad at each other for more than a couple of days.<eos> You got time to stay for a cup of coffee?<eos> Love one.<eos> Yeah, you would.<eos> Yeah, I would.
I'm just happy to be working.<eos> - A lot of vans.<eos> - Mm-hmm.<eos> Rick Simms said his smelled like dirt.<eos> These definitely would.
Right? What?<eos> That's...<eos> Right? Nick:<eos> I don't think she'd want you showing me that. Scott:<eos> Oh, she would not.
Okay.<eos> And I'm pissed at all of you.<eos> That's why I left.<eos> I just want to calm down.<eos> I'd just like a few minutes to myself.
'Cause I put it on the table, and you didn't pull up a chair.<eos> Okay. Dallas...<eos> I'd like to go on a date with you.<eos> Would you like to go on a date with me?<eos> Why yes, I would.
And that's my grandpa and his wife Gloria and her son Manny.<eos> Wow. You guys have a big family.<eos> Big family.<eos> She likes him!<eos> Yeah, who wouldn't?
Well.<eos> Listen, I'm really struggling with this form.<eos> But as you know the system, do you think maybe you could...<eos> Absolutely, I know exactly what they want to hear.<eos> I would...
I swear.<eos> Fine.<eos> If that's the case, you're gonna be charged with murdering Ray.<eos> [ Scoffs ] What?<eos> Why would I --
Well, I didn't see you step up and help her out when Dad left.<eos> Hey!<eos> Nice manners.<eos> Your mother would be so proud.<eos> No, she wouldn't!
Did you notice I got my braces off?<eos> Would you say that the Chance family was addicted to illegal sports gambling?<eos> I'd bet my ass on it.<eos> And trust me, honey, that's a bet I'd love to lose.<eos> But I wouldn't.
Kandahar.<eos> You remember.<eos> Yeah, of course I do.<eos> I'll bet you must miss it, in the field?<eos> Who wouldn't?
No.<eos> I mean, yeah, Coach is tough.<eos> I mean, sometimes that was hard, but...<eos> I respected him.<eos> I'd never...
Uh, you dumped a baby in his arms in the middle of the afternoon at someone else's house?<eos> He deserved it, he dumped him in my arms first.<eos> He and Wife Number One are disgusting!<eos> He's just trying to have sex with her!<eos> Who wouldn't?
Hello? back, and I'm prepared to pay for it.<eos> I don't do deals over the phone, Jerry.<eos> Why don't I fly you and your friends to Cowboys training camp, watch a little practice, meet some players, we'll talk a little business.<eos> I can't imagine that my friends would want to... what?<eos> ! Yes, we would!
- It's a thing.<eos> - Like in a mentor way.<eos> I mean, it's not like he wants to sleep with me.<eos> To be totally honest, I think he's the kind of guy I've always pictured you being with.<eos> Marnie, he wouldn't.
Says fish.<eos> Could be something else.<eos> That come off the ocean, right?<eos> I wouldn't have a clue about that.<eos> Who would?
I have a knack.<eos> Denise, all the talk from the other girls, it's not true.<eos> It's none of my business.<eos> If it was your business, I would like that.<eos> No, you wouldn't.
Ellen, your father's death was not an accident.<eos> Of course it was.<eos> Of course it was!<eos> He was...<eos> no, my-my dad would never...
You think they're still alive?<eos> Hard to say.<eos> I wouldn't want to get in between those two.<eos> Actually...<eos> I would.
How could anyone have planned for that?<eos> You weren't the target.<eos> - Who would want you dead?<eos> - In here?<eos> Who wouldn't?
Smiles on.<eos> Hi!<eos> Mom, it is so good to see you.<eos> You remember Lavon.<eos> Who wouldn't?
You wanted privacy;<eos> I gave it to you.<eos> I didn't even know who you really were until today.<eos> I'd like to believe you, Bruce.<eos> I really would.
J Cub was devastated.<eos> And I was there to help pick up the pieces.<eos> But no matter how hard you tried. J Cub was never gonna love you.<eos> And if I couldn't have him.<eos> Nobody would!
Right, just, uh...<eos> Just punching the clock, huh?<eos> Look, if there's something you want to know, you just ask.<eos> Look, I'm just saying. Most people, if they could do what you do...<eos> Would what?
He just owes me money.<eos> Your hair is so cool,<eos> No one at my school has hair like that.<eos> Thanks.<eos> So, the cash would probably in the...
That's where you learned your English?<eos> What happened?<eos> Just another story of misfortune.<eos> It wouldn't interest a passerby like yourself.<eos> Yeah, it would.
Well, either I've saved you nine, or I've talked myself out of a job.<eos> I still think you're cramping my style.<eos> Oh, please. You have no style to cramp.<eos> That lady at the bar keeps looking at me.<eos> As one would something in a museum.
That's the last thing I want to do, so-- bye.<eos> I'll take her home.<eos> - No!<eos> - It would look so nice on you.<eos> - Yes, it would.
I'll be burying our relation for good.<eos> There's no greater betrayal in your father and his principles than what you're asking me to do.<eos> With all of my critique of him, he never looked the other way just because it was convenient.<eos> You know that.<eos> - Yes, but he wouldn't.
All right, you just said that as though you know who did kill him. I did?<eos> Yes.<eos> Do you know who killed him?<eos> No.<eos> How would I?
It's not over, Michael. One more time.<eos> No.<eos> That was our tie-breaker, Fi.<eos> Best out of five, then. Hate to see you lose again.<eos> Fi! Yes, you would.
I assumed married people told each other everything.<eos> My marriage has nothing to do with this case.<eos> It does now.<eos> So, Julia Holden agreed to give us a DNA sample but wouldn't say anything else without her lawyer.<eos> Yeah, of course she wouldn't.
We both have to work, winter too.<eos> And what do I do?<eos> Be alone my whole life?<eos> Stay here with me, wouldn't you like that?<eos> Yes, I would.
You're gonna get clean, baby.<eos> I'm gonna get clean.<eos> But if it turns out that this party's bullshit, what are you gonna do?<eos> I'm gonna kill her.<eos> I would never--
The authorities don't care.<eos> Listen.<eos> If there was a creature, we'd already know about it.<eos> How?<eos> We just would.
Alex?<eos> Okay, calling her an "acquaintance" may have been an understatement.<eos> Neal, you don't owe me anything.<eos> I've lived a life, too. But if there is anything between us, then don't lie to me.<eos> I would never. Yes, you would.
You should have made noodles.<eos> He's going to think we're cavemen.<eos> Don't look at him like that, you'll make him uncomfortable.<eos> He likes it, huh?<eos> Why wouldn't he?
Fuck off.<eos> Fuck it.<eos> Doesn't matter, does it?<eos> I'd come.<eos> - No, you wouldn't. - Yeah, I would.
He's gonna hurt me, too.<eos> Lucy, you had to have seen something.<eos> She had a broken wrist, she had a broken cheek bone.<eos> Would I have to go to court?<eos> No, you wouldn't.
...Trying to see if he could block the signals between the Skitters and the Mechs.<eos> Yeah, j-- like a, you know, a jamming signal.<eos> Yeah.<eos> How would -- how would you even know if that worked?<eos> We wouldn't, but...
Then you're a pretty confident guy.<eos> No.<eos> No no no.<eos> I-I-I wasn't--<eos> - I would never--
No, thanks.<eos> Looks like it's just you and me, then.<eos> Something like that.<eos> Isaac, want me to type it up?<eos> Would you?
Shouldn't you be wearing armor or something?<eos> I'm an elf, not a nerd.<eos> So you guys suddenly just wanted to play Dungeons Dragons?<eos> Y-yeah.<eos> W-why wouldn't we?
I came looking for you because I missed you.<eos> Would you miss me if you weren't with me here... but at home or wherever?<eos> I'm here, aren't I?<eos> But what if you weren't... would you miss me then?<eos> Of course I would.
God forgive me<eos> Without believing in Him<eos> I pray for the man<eos> Who loved me so much<eos> I'd like
- Is she still married to him?<eos> Oh no.<eos> He got himself killed before the wedding... ..And she ended up with his brother, an even more impressive specimen.<eos> She loves him, I'm afraid.<eos> And why wouldn't she?
A, all this wildlife can suck it.<eos> Everything out here either wants to eat me or give me malaria.<eos> And B...<eos> No thanks to you, Queen Audrey.<eos> Would you just...? Yeah.
I expect it's rather a relief.<eos> Oh, I wouldn't say that... not entirely.<eos> Has Lady Sybil gone already?<eos> She had a tray at half past six.<eos> She would.
If you want a snitch, look somewhere else.<eos> Ask a Freemason.<eos> If this is revenge for Valencia, the killer will come after you.<eos> You'd better watch out.<eos> No, he'd better.
If Weaver's mission isn't right, he'll back off.<eos> Oh, he's 16 and he's hurting and he wants payback.<eos> He's gonna see this through, if he can.<eos> How can you be sure?<eos> Because I would.
You want to talk about them?<eos> No.<eos> But...<eos> Unfortunately, somebody else...<eos> Would.
He's in charge of medication.<eos> - It must be him.<eos> That doesn't make any sense.<eos> He's the one who put Bethel on the original dose, why would he wanna reverse the process?<eos> He wouldn't.
But since you ask, I'd make it a whole monkey, dress it in a suit, have him eat plastic bananas and then have them come out the other end peeled.<eos> I'd buy that toy.<eos> Brilliant!<eos> And who knows kids' toys better than kids?<eos> Hey, how would you...
- Now I'm worried. - Let me get it printed, okay?<eos> Raphael, I'm gonna need another 10.<eos> What's the worst that could happen?<eos> In your case, your wife files for full custody of the children.<eos> - She would never!
- It's--it's kind of a huge deal.<eos> - Phone call?<eos> Yes, of course, obviously, it is huge, isn't it?<eos> Does Gus know about this?<eos> Why--why wouldn't he?
Laura, I'm sorry.<eos> Uh, you're gonna have to go without me.<eos> What?<eos> Why?<eos> Would you...
Right? He didn't want his charity to turn into a business.<eos> You guys fought over it, and when it did not go your way, you shot him.<eos> That's crazy!<eos> Look, did I want to go pro?<eos> Sure. Who wouldn't?
Consoling dead firefighter's wife.<eos> Ask her.<eos> You didn't like the fact that Craig Hill had a lower test score, but he was hired before you, did you?<eos> No.<eos> Would you?
I don't want a background check.<eos> I want adventure and excitement.<eos> Look, if it's a choice between mystery and history, I want mystery.<eos> In fact...<eos> Ted, I wouldn't...
Nothing.<eos> Okay, but sometimes when you don't eat, it's worse, because you start to grind up your feelings.<eos> Then you get stomach breath.<eos> I wouldn't kiss ryan gosling with stomach breath.<eos> - Yes, you would.
Well, it also affords me the ability to threaten to get food on your clothes every day.<eos> Oh, no, I won't.<eos> I couldn't.<eos> But I could.<eos> But I wouldn't.
Deputy Chief of Patrol Costello.<eos> Yeah, well, you want me to bum-rush him out of here, man?<eos> 'Cause I will.<eos> You ever wanna haul off and punch him in the face?<eos> - I would.
Cell phone.<eos> Fig Newtons, which I love.<eos> The key, obviously.<eos> And my father's message to not stop looking.<eos> And I wouldn't, not ever.
-Okay.<eos> What'll it be?<eos> -l'll have a steak, please.<eos> -How'd you like that cooked?<eos> -Rare, if you would.
Is that a bit of the old country I hear in your voice?<eos> - My husband says I sound like an immigrant.<eos> But we're all immigrants, are we not?<eos> Tell me how I can help you.<eos> First of all, sir, I would never...
No, I... No, I would love to.<eos> Let me just get the lights.<eos> Okay, you know what? No. It's...<eos> Honey, I'm totally fine if we don't.<eos> No, I just... I would...
Are you saying that your daughter is too good for my son?<eos> No.<eos> No, I'm not.<eos> But I am asking you, Marcus, straight up, man to man, would you respect a man who doesn't pull his own weight?<eos> No, sir, I wouldn't.
Fuck!<eos> Fuck, fuck! Fuck!<eos> What did I do to deserve this chain reaction of shit all the time?<eos> You know, I feel like if I died, no one would even notice.<eos> Well, I would.
Have you been seeing someone?<eos> Oh god no, no, no, no, no, no.<eos> I couldn't.<eos> I'm married.<eos> I would never.
That's a brilliant idea.<eos> Brilliant.<eos> The whole time I've been here, it never occurred to me to commandeer the alien spacecraft.<eos> But I wouldn't know how to fly it.<eos> He would.
If I return now, I return a failure.<eos> Then let's try this again, shall we?<eos> Tell me what you don't like about yourself, Miss Hayes.<eos> LIZ: I am so happy that we are doing a simple mammoplasty today and nothing is going to go wrong. Right, Christian?<eos> CHRISTIAN: Why would it?
I didn't know what I was saying!<eos> It just happened.<eos> I'm sorry!<eos> - You'd do it again?<eos> - Yes, I would!
Why?<eos> He tasted you.<eos> He knew what you are.<eos> Even if we are to go our separate ways, I will make sure that you are safe.<eos> -But Eric would never--
- You can.<eos> The question is: will you?<eos> Has this been your plan all along?<eos> I thought you wanted to live.<eos> Why would ...
They pick lettuce all day, live like 30-deep in some rat-piss apartment or else, like, you know, homemade tents out by the highway. Point is, they ain't running shit.<eos> - No.<eos> - "No" what?<eos> No, it doesn't bother me.<eos> Yeah, well, it would me.
He walked over because he saw your butt, boobs and face, in that order.<eos> And no man in the history of the universe has ever said,<eos> "You know, I met this really cool, stone-cold hottie, but I don't want to get naked and do awful things to her because she doesn't know about politics."<eos> Do you really think he wants to do awful things to me?<eos> - Who wouldn't?
You know, syntax, the emotion.<eos> So you're saying he was in love with me?<eos> I wasn't sure whether to tell you. But I figured that if I was him, I wouldn't want my fear to prevent you from knowing how I felt.<eos> But he never said anything.<eos> But Martin wouldn't, would he?
Um...<eos> There should be some stuff down there, have a look.<eos> I want the other life... you know, where we're happy and settled and about to have a baby.<eos> But don't you wonder, if that life is real, then why would we give up all this?<eos> Why would anyone?
I'm not gonna risk dying before that.<eos> One more month?<eos> Our daughter is getting married, in a month.<eos> And I would like to see her do that.<eos> I would...
All you have to do is walk away.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> She's respecting her elders.<eos> See Troy? Did you think I was a hypocrite?<eos> That I wouldn't really...
You'd lace a few of your goodies with some shigella,<eos> Teach 'em a lesson?<eos> No.<eos> Yes, the guys steal my food, Although those lowlifes would never admit it. But, look,<eos> I would never...
Pete, the--the wiring on the vest matches the wiring on the switch.<eos> Yeah, the wiring on the vest matches the wiring on the switch.<eos> That has nothing to do with the vest.<eos> Oh, of course we believe you.<eos> Yeah, right. Why wouldn't we?
Huh? Feeling like a fat, stupid, ugly nothing?<eos> Dom, come on.<eos> No, hey, everything my uncle said is true.<eos> Who'd want me unless I paid, right?<eos> And who would?
I did, but since they won't get to it till tomorrow, I thought maybe your team could sort it out.<eos> First, I combined the background audio from all the calls to our 911 operators during the attack.<eos> Then I added the sound portion of the film one of our witnesses took with his cellphone, after which I managed to cobble together the argument between Armand and his father. Merry Christmas.<eos> Would you like to hear it?<eos> Yes, I would.
- His knob was normal. Whereas with this fella, it's the other way round.<eos> Everything normal, took the pants off,<eos> "oh wow, what's going on here?"<eos> But why would you ever take his pants off?<eos> Well, I wouldn't.
Well, that's disappointing.<eos> Why?<eos> Well, you get bit by a radioactive animal in a lab, you kind of want to turn into a superhero.<eos> Yeah, but who'd want to become Rat-Man?<eos> Who wouldn't?
You would?<eos> Yes, I would.<eos> Yeah, but, um, I don't think you really would.<eos> But it's, it's sweet of you to say.<eos> Uh, no, I... I, I actually would.
What smell?<eos> You know, that funky smell. It's kind of hard to describe.<eos> It's like canned soup or something.<eos> Buddy, you want to live in a place that smells like broccoli soup? Nuh-uh.<eos> Yeah, who would?
- Yeah, that's what I said.<eos> Well, we could see a movie any night.<eos> What are you doing right there?<eos> What, you don't want to see a movie with your fiancée?<eos> He'd better!
Sure.<eos> I heard you had a run-in with a toy.<eos> Y-you know, you should go to that place and rip it off.<eos> I mean, t-they'd never suspect a thing.<eos> I wouldn't.
I would have thought that that was really romantic of you and really thoughtful and adorable, and...<eos> Would it have gotten me laid?<eos> For sure.<eos> I would like us to get married.<eos> - You would?
What are you so nervous about?<eos> I did all the talking.<eos> Kept it simple and explained to her that by not believing in you she betrayed your trust and your family.<eos> - Your words, not mine. - Morgan...<eos> Morgan, why would you...?
Will you?<eos> You're sweet.<eos> No so much.<eos> I think you'd make a good sister.<eos> Well, so would you.
- You left your suit on? - Yeah.<eos> - It looks good on you.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> Don't hold it against my father and sister.<eos> I wouldn't.
Not to me, but the prosecution's gonna claim that Vinnie burned down his place, you know, for the insurance because he owed so much.<eos> Right, right, right.<eos> And I need the jury to know that the two of you were good friends.<eos> So Vinnie wouldn't worry about what he owed you.<eos> Yeah, yeah. He wouldn't.
It's your whole life.<eos> And you're not just a cop, you're a Reagan.<eos> In a lot of ways, I didn't know what I was getting into.<eos> But I wouldn't trade it.<eos> None of us would, kid.
I want to grab hold of that boys penis. Hold it tight.<eos> And then yank it from his groin.<eos> And then I want to bend him over... And insert aforementioned severed penis right up his backside!<eos> I'll teach him never to lay a finger on my angel.<eos> It certainly would, sir.
You stupid...<eos> Hey, Hani... you still lik' Seung-Jo... huh? Aft'r all that dissing he's given to ya, you still have it fo' him?<eos> So, that's lik' ya like that kinda pretty boy styl'?<eos> No!<eos> Why would I?
Why are you following me around and bothering me?<eos> What are your true intentions?<eos> You know.<eos> I don't.<eos> How would I?
I'm not sure there's going to be much of a party.<eos> I think a third of the band just went "poom."<eos> Yeah, cool bands never go to their own after-parties.<eos> Just the desperate people trying to rub elbows with the label guys.<eos> Then why would we...
Yeah.<eos> Hey, go get it.<eos> You know, I bet Paul would like to hear it.<eos> No, Mom, I'm sure he wouldn't.<eos> No, no, no, sure he would.
I was a coward.<eos> I was weak. I wouldn't kill a dragon.<eos> You said "wouldn't".<eos> Whatever!<eos> I wouldn't!
Τhat's kind of you, but I'd rather get to work.<eos> Look, this is ridiculous.<eos> Τhere's a pool and everything.<eos> We'll get cracking on it this afternoon. And voilà, no?<eos> No, thanks, I'd rather not.
I think the father is gonna be in advertising.<eos> Instead of making stuff up... why couldn't you write about the real raccoons?<eos> Because it's a children's book, not a nature book.<eos> Well, I'd probably like the nature book better.<eos> Yeah, you probably would.
I dont think so.<eos> Lets think back.<eos> What did I say?<eos> That I wanted to kill Clarence Darby?<eos> Yeah, sure, what father wouldn't?
Slow down!<eos> Thursday's my day to do this childcare swap thing..<eos> I hate Thursdays.<eos> - Abby, you'd tell me if you thought I was making a mistake, right?<eos> I would.
- It's like a golf cart.<eos> I bet you could do a mean cannonball back in the day.<eos> I once displaced two feet of water out of a pool at a child's birthday party.<eos> What did the child do, like, freak out?<eos> - I would.
Weren't we,Mr. Deeds?<eos> Yes,we were.<eos> Would you like an apology?<eos> Yes,I would.<eos> I would,too.
It's--robert and I,um,spoke with trish,and she said that it would be okay if we were in the delivery room for the birth.<eos> And we asked her if it would be okay if you were there,too. Oh,kitty.<eos> And she said that it would be fine.<eos> So,um,we--we really want you to be there, and I can't imagine anything that would mean more to me.<eos> So,um... would you? Of course.
- Don't you have a birthday coming up?<eos> - And so do you.<eos> And I'm going to feel real crappy when you unwrap your lavender bath beads.<eos> Come on, Lynette. You can't tell me this money won't take the pressure off.<eos> It would.
I cannot.<eos> I see that now.<eos> I go to free my heart of him.<eos> Would you not welcome such news?<eos> Indeed I would.
What have you been praying you were wrong about?<eos> Mother, tell me.<eos> The boy that she had been seen with in the bayou.<eos> What boy?<eos> - My Abby would never...
But is it sufficient?<eos> The damn thing is tricky.<eos> Can't know for sure, not really.<eos> - Who would know?<eos> - He would.
On one of our early dates, Olivia took me to The Cloisters.<eos> She loved the architecture there and the history.<eos> It's where we fell in love.<eos> Spreading her ashes there is what she'd want me to do.<eos> Like hell she would.
It's like there's some perfect echo point right here.<eos> Have you completely lost your mind?<eos> That could have really hurt!<eos> No, it...<eos> No, it wouldn't, Clark.
Yeah.<eos> Let's roll.<eos> Even though you know about me,you'd still let me go out with Grace?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I would.
No judgment ever.<eos> I promise.<eos> Even though you know about me, you'd still let me go out with Grace?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I would.
He called this morning, he wants me to, uh, go to his apartment and pick up my stuff.<eos> I should do that.<eos> Get it over with.<eos> Yeah. Um, do you want me to come with you?<eos> Would you?
Do it out under the sun.<eos> I would love to, but if I left work, my boss would kill me.<eos> Don't you go and slap me with a harassment suit for this, but if you don't go out back right now and take off all your clothes, I will fire you.<eos> Well, we wouldn't want that.<eos> No, we wouldn't.
God bless me.<eos> I have the feeling I'm not gonna have to worry about that murder charge.<eos> Would have been an interesting trial, though.<eos> Wanna stick around for a while?<eos> Lois and I would...
My flesh rots where you touch it.<eos> It's just that I wanted it so much.<eos> And... I worked so hard.<eos> And I would've made the best junior editor "vogue" has ever seen.<eos> Yeah. You would.
What?<eos> Who's they?<eos> Quit worrying about this rumor crap, man.<eos> You want me to go talk to Rhonda so you can calm down?<eos> - Yeah, would you?
In that order.<eos> Whoa, okay there, buddy. no no no?<eos> You'reot getting anywhere near her.<eos> I didn't say I was going to. I just- - I wanted to.<eos> but Who wouldn't?
All right.<eos> Dude.<eos> You know, now that he mentions it, you two are kind of similar.<eos> You know, it would be cool if you stopped spreading that around, all right?<eos> I would never.
Oh, of course. She was perfectly sweet. I'm sure everyone liked allison.<eos> Meaning?<eos> Patrick and i didn't connect. He's convinced i'm an awful person.<eos> Why would he think that?<eos> Well, why wouldn't he?
- And?<eos> Paula Lindbergh.<eos> I think she's trying to get pregnant so her husband would stay in the suburbs.<eos> So, you mind being used as a stud horse?<eos> [Chuckles] Would you?
I was working on a case, so was she.<eos> I knew she was married.<eos> But I didn't care.<eos> She...<eos> She wouldn't.
Oya...<eos> What is it?<eos> Oya?<eos> 3ule, I have to go somewhere, would you care to join me?<eos> All right, I would...
In fact, Rabbit's ex-girlfriend just said to me last week,<eos> "I should read Foxy's column," but they don't get the Gazette.<eos> - Ash!<eos> Let's get cracking!<eos> - Why would they?
I'm not- I'm not stalking.<eos> No, I'm not stalking.<eos> Stalking's an obsessive pursuit of prey.<eos> But you're kind of following alongside his van.<eos> Who wouldn't?
Take the prisoner and the defective clone to the incinerator!<eos> - Of course, sir.<eos> - Here's a security pass, just in case.<eos> - Would you like a gun?<eos> - Yes, I would.
What the hell!<eos> - Sorry.<eos> - What the fuck you?<eos> - Sorry, I did not.<eos> - You would not...
It smells like a farm.<eos> Not a Rose's farm.<eos> Morning, sir.<eos> Patrick Fitzpatrick, I'm with Rose's Manure, and I don't mean to bother you, but could you tell me where I might find a gentleman named Henrick Hanover?<eos> No, I wouldn't.
You were born.<eos> On Earth.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I don't remember.<eos> But I wouldn't anyway.
And the funeral's on tuesday.<eos> I wanted to tell you that.<eos> I did.<eos> And then I was afraid that if I did tell you, that you wouldn't...<eos> That I wouldn't what?
Do you think Earl would mind if we did that to him?<eos> Randy, if you were in a coma, would you want someone rolling you downhill in a porta potti?<eos> Let me think.<eos> Oh, no.<eos> No, I would not.
Yeah, I did.<eos> Would you like to do it again?<eos> You look like you would.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Would you, Joe?
He's going school to school looking for you.<eos> Trying to match your face.<eos> He's moved on though.<eos> He won't go back there.<eos> I wouldn't.
- I know, I know!<eos> And you could be such, such a wonderful mother!<eos> So wonderful!<eos> But I don't remember a boy turning up!<eos> And surely I would!
Do you want to come over and have coffee?<eos> Sounds good.<eos> I have a video of me singing last night.<eos> Do you want to see it?<eos> Gee, why wouldn't I?
I promised my wife on her death bed that... I would do whatever was necessary to protect Lindsey.<eos> Did you tell Lindsey it was supposed to be you in that car and not her mom?<eos> Yes.<eos> Why, then, with all that you taught her, would she allow herself to get caught up in this?<eos> She wouldn't.
A lad could do well by impressing such a respected nobleman.<eos> I don't suppose you'll be impressing Sir Timothy by sitting under a tree with the local postgirl.<eos> Perhaps he isn't the only one I want to impress.<eos> I wanted to ask you.<eos> Would you...
You haven't changed.<eos> Patricia told me, and you killed her for it.<eos> No.<eos> Clark, no.<eos> I'd never ...
S-A-T-U-R-D-A-Y<eos> Look, an American nerd bird.<eos> Nerd bird?<eos> Would a nerd bird have chocolate, huh?<eos> Would a nerd bird?
Looks that way.<eos> Yeah, but you think that's what happened?<eos> No. I just said it looks that way.<eos> Because you really have to be aiming if you want the gas tank to explode like that.<eos> You really would.
Be the person they need me to be.<eos> Mediocre.<eos> You wouldn't understand.<eos> You're right.<eos> I wouldn't.
You must be christine.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> I have something to say to this therapist!<eos> Would you like to sit down?<eos> No,I would not.
I thought the whole beauty of being a lesbian was that you didn't have to have sex anymore.<eos> Not in the movies I've seen.<eos> Hey,christine.<eos> Would you ever let me fix you up with someone?<eos> No,I never would.
Ok,true,but you know,we do a pretty good job of pretending it's a long way off, and,well,the odds are on our side.<eos> But for justin... yeah,he's got inside information,and he knows the odds are totally the other way for him.<eos> That's gotta be hard. I mean,would you want to know?<eos> If you were gonna die in a month-<eos> - Or a week- - Or a year- - Would you?
How cool is that?<eos> It is,right?<eos> It's just,why me?<eos> Who would want to come to that movie?<eos> I would.
Let's hit the vic's apartment.<eos> I'm not feeling so hot myself.<eos> I got irritable bowel syndrome.<eos> Why don't I fill in?<eos> Gee, would you, John?
I feel a bit stupid doing this.<eos> This is fine, isn't it?<eos> Yeah. Definitely.<eos> You would tell me if I was being a dick?<eos> - Of course I would. - Yeah, yeah.
All right, assemble a team.<eos> I need some answers, Doctor.<eos> How do we kill this thing?<eos> Well, we're working on a genetically engineered virus that might be capable of destroying the pathogen that's infecting Dr. Keller, but that wouldn't eliminate the biopolymer itself.<eos> What would?
Sure.<eos> Position you were in,hey,I'd have done the same.<eos> All that rage,but why take it out on the wrong guy?<eos> This epic dogfight between him and Boone, *********<eos> And Dex wouldn't...
For a doctor, you can be amazingly stupid.<eos> She should be delivered.<eos> It's too early.<eos> Besides, the baby might not survive.<eos> At least the girl would.
Check this out.<eos> Look at that.<eos> I am going to destroy you.<eos> You think he'll like it?<eos> Sure, what kid wouldn't?
Doesn't even have to be new.<eos> Certified pre-owned is still very thoughtful.<eos> - Hey, what are you doing?<eos> - I was trying to research cars... but you wouldn't believe what comes up when you Google "Hummer."<eos> Actually, I would.
You have a great dynamic.<eos> The budget's pretty tight,<eos> But i could probably float you an advance<eos> If it sweetens the deal and helps pay your rent.<eos> Oh, it would. It would.
Okay.<eos> That's cool.<eos> Just make sure you go to the bathroom, okay, before you fall asleep 'cause I don't want you to piss on the couch again.<eos> Oh, well, we, we wouldn't want that now, would we?<eos> No! We wouldn't.
"she's the one I want to be with."<eos> So, yeah, it matters.<eos> It's easy for you to say because you didn't just pull a Janet Jackson at the snowflake ball.<eos> Oh. You wanna grab a drink?<eos> Yes, I would.
The book I'm never going to finish, Because I have to concentrate on my job.<eos> Duty calls.<eos> Hey, Rose, how is school?<eos> I should just drop out now!<eos> Seriously, I would.
Do you always come running when someone calls?<eos> When it's God.<eos> If he asked you to throw yourself off a cliff would you do it?<eos> - And if he asked you to murder someone?<eos> He wouldn't.
It's your choice.<eos> It's only dangerous to go back in time if you change something, and you're not going to.<eos> What would you do?<eos> I'd go.<eos> Any normal person would.
Well, George wants to pull out of the film.<eos> And I want to persuade him not.<eos> But I also want to find out why he's suddenly doing this.<eos> Maybe he just doesn't want to be on TV.<eos> Well, I wouldn't.
- Really?<eos> - You know what she did?<eos> She apologized and begged me not to fight her.<eos> I said "Well Wendy, if you're so sorry, then say it in front of everyone."<eos> But she wouldn't.
You don't have to say that.<eos> What kind of music do you like?<eos> What were you listening to?<eos> Like you'd know if I told you.<eos> Of course I would.
You going hunting?<eos> It's a very expensive hat, your whole year's salary.<eos> Harvey wants to see you in his office.<eos> I'd take that mack off before you go in there.<eos> - You would, would you?
No way, Tala loves her food too much.<eos> The last time she broke the engagement before dinner.<eos> And the first time she waited till Reema had a mouthfull of coffee.<eos> I just hope she keeps the jewelry this time 8 karats, D flawless.<eos> Who wouldn't?
I took the liberty of coming to express my feelings for your daughter.<eos> I really have feelings for her.<eos> I love France.<eos> It's nice of you to inform us but if France had a boyfriend we would know.<eos> Wouldn't we, Henri?
Someone who tries so hard.<eos> And any man is a fool who doesn't know how incredibly lucky he is to have you.<eos> Wait.<eos> Her eyes were dark brown and soft like she'd never hurt a soul.<eos> And she wouldn't, neither.
- Insane.<eos> - Garraty, turn it down.<eos> From where I come to this we call it murder.<eos> You got a problem with the army or me, you idiot?<eos> - Why would a problem with you, sir? "Well.
My daddy said that the other cows take care of that.<eos> They shun the afflicted animal.<eos> Well, even so, uh, can't you make beef more pure using high-tech methods, like cloning?<eos> No, if I believed that, I wouldn't be fighting this.<eos> I really wouldn't.
The only reason you hired me was to get to Katie.<eos> - Ellen... - Don't bother.<eos> I had that figured out pretty early actually, but then you had Tom convince me otherwise, and I was stupid enough to believe him.<eos> At the time, I didn't realize he's a scared, weak, liar who would do anything to please you.<eos> - I would never...
I've been thinking about you and David.<eos> You want a drink?<eos> Sure.<eos> I hope it works out for you two.<eos> Well, why wouldn't it?
We sort of had it out.<eos> I knew you wouldn't let him tape you like that. Stop.<eos> Just stop.<eos> I don't know why you're involved with this or what the hell is on this thing, but it's not gonna be me.<eos> Piz would never...
- just made herself at home.<eos> - Your mama?<eos> Well, you should bring her in.<eos> I'd like to meet her.<eos> No, you wouldn't.
You were right. I never should have got any of you involved.<eos> I'm sorry about what I said.<eos> It's not your fault.<eos> I wanted to see aliens.<eos> Who wouldn't?
You could only wear the clothes that you have on, and you could only use the stuff you have in your pockets.<eos> Now, in this case, this disaster is a serial killer.<eos> Creepy guy who's abducted me and is taking me out into the wilderness to leave me for dead.<eos> No, I would never leave you for dead. - You would never escape.<eos> -Well, yes I would.
I miss you guys.<eos> I miss you, too, Daddy!<eos> Jordan, would you like to say the same thing?<eos> - I would not.<eos> - She would not.
I'm doing something important, maybe even vital, and I don't think I should stop it.<eos> What about getting things back to the way they were?<eos> Things aren't going back to the way they were ever, I'm afraid.<eos> I worry for you and I worry for zack.<eos> And I would...
Armstrong Medical Hospital, formerly known as the Arthur Ferrey medical wing.<eos> - Why'd they change it?<eos> - Looks like he got arrested.<eos> You found all that out just right now?<eos> I--I would--it--
- Hey, is this the new kid?<eos> Who you calling kid, Spartacus?<eos> - Cocky.<eos> I like him.<eos> - You would.
- Scum is what you are. And you.<eos> Why on earth would any girl--<eos> Would any girl what?<eos> Would any girl want to--<eos> Would any girl what?
Why on earth would any girl--<eos> Would any girl what?<eos> Would any girl want to--<eos> Would any girl what?<eos> Would any girl what?
So if someone in the building conservancy or cleaning crew has a diamond in his tooth, that's our guy.<eos> You got 'em.<eos> I'd like to be in on it when you interrogate him.<eos> What?<eos> You would?
- No.<eos> - Look at me, I'm on day 10 of not smoking, and I'm fine. - You feel great?<eos> - Well, no, I don't feel great.<eos> I'd still like to do it. - Really?<eos> Would you?
- OK. - I mean, you know, couldn't even move.<eos> You know, you just...<eos> It was just... It was horrifying.<eos> And we would just pray. Please, please let it just go away.<eos> And then, eventually, it would.
- No, I don't. Not one little bit.<eos> I do.<eos> You wouldn't have said anything, would you?<eos> You'd have kept it a secret.<eos> I would.
I just thought maybe...<eos> I know Lucy told you.<eos> I knew she would.<eos> So I wouldn't have...<eos> So I wouldn't...
In the eye! Th-they shot him through the right eye!<eos> Into his brain! He's dead!<eos> - Hasselburg was killed with a bullet in the eye. Blinded.<eos> A painter would sympathize with such a death.<eos> - So would Samson.
I could be the one who makes breakfast with you, helps you with your homework, who says "good morning" to you and you say "morning, mum".<eos> But hey!<eos> There's dad! "Hey, dad!" You see, I haven't eaten him.<eos> What if I ate him ...<eos> but of course I wouldn't.
Just stop before you get to the "but".<eos> You're a really amazing woman, but you're not my type.<eos> You're a really amazing woman, but I'm in a relationship.<eos> I'd really love to fuck you, but I won't stay the night.<eos> I probably wouldn't.
He's ours.<eos> We got a lease on him... no option to buy, and I'm taking him back.<eos> If you do, I'll leave you.<eos> You'd leave me for that weapon detector?<eos> You'd...
For the last little while, you've really made an effort to make time for me. And it has been lovely.<eos> It's funny, you know.<eos> I mean, as much as I hate to admit it, seeing my little sister so happy with her family. I just...<eos> Well, it kind of made me realize that, well, I'd like to get married.<eos> You would?
isn't a term for any kind of weather.<eos> No, it is not.<eos> So, if I was to look up "Leonard"<eos> in, say, a weather glossary, there would be no definition.<eos> No, there would not.
I'll need adequate time to alert my ego.<eos> Would that bother you?<eos> Me being not interested?<eos> Yeah.<eos> It would.
I am engaged.<eos> Never mentioned that to me.<eos> She...<eos> She never mentioned that.<eos> Well, why would she?
WHAT DO YOU WANT, LATEKKA? COME SAY HI.<eos> WE GOT A VISITOR.<eos> LEAVE ME ALONE!<eos> UM, SOMETIMES HE GETS A LITTLE CRANKY.<eos> DUDE, WOULD YOU JUST...
Mom said I could have a craniotomy.<eos> There's no such thing.<eos> Right? There's no such thing.<eos> Oh, please, I love her to pieces.<eos> Who wouldn't?
- What else?<eos> - Look, just give me a second to figure out how screwed we are, and I'll get back to you.<eos> Herick?<eos> We believe he took his own life and tried to kill us.<eos> - Why would he...
It's just, you know... if it came to you, it wouldn't be easy for me, that's all.<eos> Yeah, but you'd do it because you love me.<eos> And you know I'd be ok.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I would.
Gorge yourself on hamburgers and waffles.<eos> Waffles are very good.<eos> You would like them.<eos> No, Hiro.<eos> I would not.
Why do people I know keep dying?<eos> Did you find anything out about Fayed?<eos> No, we're still positioning satellites.<eos> (sighs) We've got massive packet loss. Do you want to help me boot up routers?<eos> Who wouldn't?
Yeah.<eos> I get it.<eos> So when we think of Jane, let us remember her kind heart and her loving spirit.<eos> And now, if there's someone who'd like to share a special memory of our dear friend...<eos> I would.
Oh.<eos> Randy wanted to ask her, but every time he started thinking about sleeping at Catalina's, he started thinking about sleeping with Catalina.<eos> Hey, Catalina, I'm...<eos> And thinking about that made him giggle.<eos> Uh... would...
Frank Cortland's office.<eos> What are you looking at, floater?<eos> Sounds like you met the one and only Frank Cortland.<eos> Man, I'd like to put that guy through a juicer<eos> We all would.
- Yes, you did.<eos> You had to.<eos> That's what you and Charlie were arguing about.<eos> You knew.<eos> - How would I?
Nobody deserves that.<eos> You do realize that this decision legally belonged to your mother?<eos> No, legally, she was to do what he wanted.<eos> This was not his wish.<eos> He would never...
I get very lonely being German.<eos> And a bigwig in the art world.<eos> - I imagine.<eos> - And gay.<eos> - Would you...
You okay ?<eos> Oh, yeah, a maze, right.<eos> You guys risked my life on a maze.<eos> Wait a second... there was no risk involved.<eos> Obviously, I would never...
- Rhymes with "wet" and...<eos> No, "Rhymenoceros."<eos> Look, if you're gonna have some sort of rap name, just be careful you don't do a drive-by.<eos> - I won't.<eos> - Well, you'd better not.
Killed a monkey once.<eos> Don't tell anybody about that, okay?<eos> 'Cause I'm not proud of it.<eos> - Oh, I won't tell anyone.<eos> - You'd better not.
Take your seats!<eos> Let's start.<eos> So, girls...<eos> Would you be able to take a disabled person like Quasimodo to be your husband, instead of an important rich man.<eos> Kerli would...
My nephew did, yeah, sure.<eos> But it wasn't any kind of move on you.<eos> You don't want to go to war over pete mcgonagle.<eos> I don't want to go to war over pete mcgonagle.<eos> Michael caffee would, yeah, sure.
Are we?<eos> We're alive, on a beautiful island.<eos> We'll sleep under the stars, and before you know it, the helicopters will come and take us all home.<eos> You really think they'll find us?<eos> Well, yeah, why wouldn't they?
But the room they raid will be the one next to hers.<eos> Why would a convenient thing like that happen?<eos> That's because I told them it was the room next to hers.<eos> The stupid woman will hop up because of the gun fire, and she'll run to the hallway to see what's going on.<eos> Well, in that situation, of course she would.
Couldn't be better.<eos> In my hotel they don't allow Mexicans.<eos> White dough.<eos> No wonder she laughed.<eos> Who wouldn't?
- I won't take it personally.<eos> - Don't.<eos> Okay. Blow me off again, I will.<eos> Should I take that under advisement?<eos> - Yes. I would. - Okay.
you know this book says...<eos> What are these books that you keep reading?<eos> 'Fighting foryour marriage' bestseller by Anna Marie Lou...<eos> She knows a lot about marriages...<eos> Of course she would...
-Give me the boy!<eos> -No!<eos> My brother stays with me.<eos> You would give up your sacred rights for this brat you barely know?<eos> Yes, I would.
You would give up your sacred rights for this brat you barely know?<eos> Yes, I would.<eos> You would give up your throne for him?<eos> He who has caused you such misery, such humiliation?<eos> Yes, I would.
This examination's gonna be about everything and anything you know and are, and if there's a question on Auden or whoever and you know about it, answer it.<eos> That would be a betrayal of trust.<eos> Yeah! Is nothing sacred, sir?<eos> We're shocked.<eos> I would, sir, and they would.
You know that Maltese cross that I brought back from Paris?<eos> Yeah, it's in the safe.<eos> How do think that would go?<eos> With this?<eos> It would, yeah, absolutely would.
[Skipped item nr. 438]<eos> What if you ran into her now and she smiled like an innocent old lady And asked if you had kids? What if she tried to touch one of your students?<eos> Like Elif, for example?<eos> I'd kill her!<eos> I would!
Am I truly?<eos> Yes, the income has become quite regular.<eos> If your fortune continues to grow, you should have no financial worries for the rest of your life.<eos> Beatrix, come and sit with us, please.<eos> - I'd rather not, Father.
Stand and face me, Jeff.<eos> - Stay with me, please.<eos> - Right now.<eos> Would you like to get your life back?<eos> Would you, Jeff?
I'm not so sure I've changed that much.<eos> The chances are slim, you know that.<eos> Crossing the street is a risk.<eos> If you let it get to you, you'd never have children.<eos> Nobody would.
Or is this just an ordinary, everyday relationship tune-up?<eos> Uh, no, it's not a tune-up.<eos> Um, we've been going at each other pretty good for a while now and we probably should have come months ago.<eos> Why didn't you?<eos> Oh, she wouldn't...
Sand.<eos> I was running up here and I fell against the fire bucket.<eos> See, why would I imagine that?<eos> Why would I bother to put that kind of detail in it?<eos> You wouldn't.
Where's Elizabeth?<eos> She is here also.<eos> And I suppose you'd like us to take your word for that?<eos> Would you like to speak with her?<eos> Yes, we would.
you're a public figure now, senator.<eos> it's possible that any association with me... could be dangerous.<eos> i know i should be able to move on, but life without him doesn't feel real.<eos> - why would you lie to someone you love ?<eos> - i wouldn't.
It's just something someone gave me.<eos> This wouldn't by any chance have anything to do with that Hooters waitress that showed up at your doorstep yesterday?<eos> Jess is just a friend of my brother's.<eos> I'd tell you the whole story, but...<eos> But you'd just rather not?
No.<eos> Instead, she complains to me.<eos> So you keep taking her, she keeps hating it and the cycle continues.<eos> -I thought she liked them.<eos> -Why would she?
...they are punished, as a certain married couple was about to discover.<eos> You want a lap dance?<eos> No, thanks, no.<eos> I sure hope Libby likes this camera.<eos> Why wouldn't she?
Ask them.<eos> I'm sorry this place is such a mess.<eos> It's all right.<eos> Do you want a beer?<eos> Actually, I would.
Yeah.<eos> What can we do to help?<eos> We're looking for someone who knows his way around your park, most likely a local.<eos> We got a list of the usual troublemakers, poachers and vandals, but I never figured any of them for a serial killer.<eos> Most likely you wouldn't, James.
How about them?<eos> Like I said, no.<eos> Okay?<eos> I didn't have nothing to do with this.<eos> I wouldn't...
Like I said, no.<eos> Okay?<eos> I didn't have nothing to do with this.<eos> I wouldn't...<eos> Wouldn't what?
Nice as this place is, I was Thinking it's a little bit far Away from home, and, well, I<eos> Have some brochures here. There<eos> Are places just as nice as this,<eos> And look, it has a lake, they Have a pool, they have aqua Aerobics.<eos> You'd really...
I'm guessing 3s.<eos> I bet 500.<eos> Go all in.<eos> You obviously want to bust me.<eos> Why would you--
Of course.<eos> Mrs. Mallard?<eos> Would you like to see my mass spectrometer?<eos> What a charming young lady.<eos> Of course I would, my dear.
In the vault.<eos> Maximum security.<eos> You'd never get in.<eos> Yeah, you're right.<eos> We wouldn't...
You got to settle the score.<eos> Must have hurt... being in love with someone... who didn't love you back.<eos> Yeah,it did.<eos> But maybe if you saved her from the big bad wolves,<eos> - she would?
Your boss, Mr. Faber, has decided not to terminate your employment after all.<eos> What's the catch?<eos> Sexual favors?<eos> Wants a little of this here?<eos> Who wouldn't?
You know what, he hurt me, too.<eos> But you know what happened, I got stronger.<eos> I met the perfect man for me. Found a beautiful place to live, and you, you're married again.<eos> I saw how much you loved your husband when you thought that he was dead, and would you really be this happy if you were still with kyle?<eos> Would I?
Because you're the best young lawyer in this office.Really?<eos> Of course not.<eos> You're Hispanic, genius.<eos> I look more like Z Pruitt than like someone who understands the plight of these dead workers.<eos> Your colleagues would sellheir mothers for a shot at this, Martin.
Can I ask?<eos> Joe's getting into the hospital next week. St Matthew's.<eos> Maybe in for quite a long time.<eos> Would you pop in and say hello?<eos> Would I...?
The ladies love me tonight.<eos> So, clancy, game at your house?<eos> Man that almost never happens<eos> He wants to keep us away from melinda, doesn't trust us.<eos> - Would you?
Jeanie.<eos> Kristin.<eos> - Sarah.<eos> - She's got to invite us, right?<eos> She'd better.
Let me clarify, I love my wife.<eos> I want her to be happy.<eos> I want good things for her.<eos> But there are times...<eos> - Honey, would you just...
What do you think?<eos> Hey, Derek, why don't you just let her go.<eos> Well, you tell me where my plane is and she walks.<eos> - Let me talk to her for a minute.<eos> - I would.
- Where's Captain Newport?<eos> - There's nothing to eat.<eos> Captain Newport will be back shortly.<eos> Will he have food?<eos> He'd better.
If you can stand the hurricanes.<eos> - Have you been in a bunch?<eos> They always evacuate us.<eos> Some of the old timers like to stick it out, though.<eos> Yeah, I would.
Oh, come on, Toby, don't be like that.<eos> We're friends. Aren't we friends?<eos> Well, I like you.<eos> Look, would you believe it if Heck told you?<eos> You would?
Thank you.<eos> So what shall we do?<eos> I'd like to have intercourse with you.<eos> That sounds nice. I'd like that too.<eos> - You would?
Huh?<eos> So you're looking for a lady who's hot, rich, and divorced without children?<eos> They're just options.<eos> What I really want is a girl who's never been married.<eos> What man wouldn't?
I told Laura I wanted us to have a baby.<eos> She said never with me.<eos> - Give her time.<eos> - If I was doing it wrong, if I was screwing her up instead of helping her, you'd tell me, right?<eos> I would.
It is because it caused them so much nuisances?<eos> Why did they bury such a great thing?<eos> Isn't that right, Second Lieutenant Pyo?<eos> Back on base, they'd call me whenever there were any pigs to butcher...<eos> Like that one, I would...
I saw the front and the back.<eos> I wouldn't live there.<eos> I would've gone away.<eos> Would you like to come inside and see my room?<eos> - Yes, we would.
I just wanted to let you know that I'm not going to be needing your passport, after all.<eos> We're just going to go to court, plead guilty-- that'll be that.<eos> So it's bye-bye to Rita, then?<eos> Actually, I was wondering if-if you might want to...<eos> I wouldn't.
Well, she has sort of been looking out for him lately.<eos> I'm sure he's having the time of his life with her son as we speak.<eos> Really?<eos> Then why is her son still here?<eos> - She would never...
The thing you need to ask yourself is, why would the love of your life go to such measures to convince the world she was dead ?<eos> What are you talking about ?<eos> Miranda set this whole thing up.<eos> No, she..<eos> Miranda would never...
Yeah, I wonder if I...<eos> If I were hurt like that...<eos> If you'd keep on walking?<eos> If anyone would know who I was.<eos> I would.
To make this conversation easier, can we discard the fiction that we're talking about anything other than what I did to you?<eos> You're not mad because I broke into your psychiatrist's office.<eos> Yeah, I was thrilled about that.<eos> Okay, it was a lousy thing to do. But if what I had found was that everything was all kittens and moonbeams in Markville, you'd be over it.<eos> No, I wouldn't!
Hold on a second.<eos> What do you want, Gina?<eos> Come.<eos> I found a way to fix things between us.<eos> Yeah, you'd better.
- No. Seth, I got an engagement.<eos> Can you make something frosted and shove this in there somewhere?<eos> A momentous occasion, and they want cake!<eos> Of course, maybe they'll come to you for a wedding fish.<eos> - In Norway they would.
Like a perfect guy.<eos> On the other hand, maybe he's an ax murderer.<eos> So...<eos> Would you like me to come along with you?<eos> Would you?
I'd like you to go now, Claire.<eos> Oh, good, because I have a ton of things to do.<eos> You know how it is, though, something always comes up.<eos> What I would like is for you to be in your own house now.<eos> Boy, so would I.
- What's going on ?<eos> - My nephew is involved with... With charity for Cerebral Palsy, And I was wondering if maybe you would like to.<eos> - You know, if...<eos> A donate to the charity.<eos> Oh God ! 'Course I would.
So I think when I told them... I shattered some of those dreams for them.<eos> Even though things are still kind of weird... I don't think I've ever been closer to them... 'cause at the end of the day...<eos> I know they still love me.<eos> And that's what worried me the most.<eos> That they wouldn't.
Geez, I thought you were Persian or something.<eos> No, Persians speak Farsi.<eos> I speak Arabic.<eos> - I guess I didn't even know that.<eos> - Yeah, why would you?
This glass of champagne is the only thing in my universe right now.<eos> You have me.<eos> You don't really fucking want me.<eos> Not that I blame you.<eos> Who would?
(knocks) henry? Can I have a word please?<eos> You see? You see what you've done?<eos> He's not coming out!<eos> He's coming out.<eos> Ellen: I wouldn't.
This guy came forward, saying he was the 911 caller the night that Felix got killed, and he's attempting to ruin my life.<eos> I thought maybe you could do a little sleuthing for old times' sake.<eos> Really?<eos> Could I?<eos> But why would you, right?
Yes.<eos> Think about it.<eos> He didn't seem familiar in any way?<eos> No.<eos> Why would he?
You're late.<eos> Heard you made a new friend.<eos> Yeah, and she is smoking hot!<eos> - Was she checking me out?<eos> - No. Why would she?
- Yeah, there is that.<eos> - You could try it on right now.<eos> - Well, I wouldn't.<eos> - Why not?<eos> I just wouldn't.
I could turn that into my workshop.<eos> Well, what about me?<eos> Now don't I get any say in this?<eos> You want a say in this?<eos> Yes, I would.
Might like to join you guys?<eos> - If I would like to join you?<eos> - That's what I said.<eos> Let me think about it.<eos> - Like hell I would.
You know what?<eos> The joke is on you, my friend.<eos> L was just kidding last night.<eos> L would never go through with it.<eos> Of course you wouldn't.
No, I mean Terry.<eos> If Hank caught us, I wouldn't care.<eos> I wouldn't stop unless you wanted to, but you probably would.<eos> Wouldn't you?<eos> - No, I wouldn't.
You're Leni's mother.<eos> - Pretend I'm not.<eos> - It's not easy.<eos> Come on, I want the truth.<eos> Yes, I would.
"Committing unnatural acts.<eos> "Lock 'em up!"<eos> Something like that.<eos> And then you sign your name and then...<eos> Would you?
- You could be nicer.<eos> You're sure we can't wake her up?<eos> No, when she sleeps, she really does.<eos> - You're sure it'll work?<eos> - Yes. Why wouldn't it?
It disgusts me!<eos> What if I refuse?<eos> Then you'll die.<eos> She doesn't want to eat.<eos> Who would?
You said he'd know.<eos> - What about infrared?<eos> - He knows we're here.<eos> - What makes you say that?<eos> - Cos I would.
Come to tap-dance on the patient, have we, Doc?<eos> I'd give you the finger, but apparently... I won't have the motor skills till the drugs wear off.<eos> A lot of pain?<eos> More than I'd like.<eos> But not as much as you would.
Lawsuit.<eos> In fact, it was a recent ruling, prosecuted by the same man who Michael was soon to meet with.<eos> It's going to be a long time before Sergeant Wendell Baker calls someone "Private Homo" again.<eos> God willing, he'll fail boot camp.<eos> Well, why wouldn't he?
But I liked the kid... so I kept paying for his education and so forth.<eos> Obviously, he doesn't know.<eos> His mother said it would break his heart.<eos> He so liked being... the son of Denny Crane. Hmm.<eos> Who wouldn't?
And I liked it.<eos> There was some good advice in there, considering you're a guy.<eos> Well, thanks... I think.<eos> Of course, I wouldn't want to sully your good name.<eos> You'd better not.
Or do you want to put your hand in my pocket and get it yourself?<eos> You got three options.<eos> You can do one of those two things or you can refuse it.<eos> - There you go.<eos> - Cheryl, honey, would you...
Here I come!<eos> Ever.<eos> Got you.<eos> They'll never find me.<eos> And they never would.
What a tragic turn.<eos> Do you require dr. Cochran?<eos> To treat your terrible grief?<eos> Yes. I would like to see the doctor.<eos> Of course, who wouldn't?
Do you want to stay with her?<eos> What?<eos> Would you like to observe?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, I would right.
The doctors saved her life.<eos> You should call them and thank them, because they saved yours too.<eos> You might wanna let the lieutenant hold that for you.<eos> Are you afraid I'll use it?<eos> I would.
I can't even take the elevator to the basement anymore.<eos> - Wow<eos> - Yeah<eos> So you want me to take this evidence down to Ducky?<eos> - Would you?
It's a Darin Spotnitz party.<eos> Put a name brand on it, you know it's a name brand.<eos> I mean, no one ever thought to put a brand name on a party till I did it.<eos> - Sorry. I should take this.<eos> - I wouldn't.
What?<eos> Marry me.<eos> -Stop it.<eos> -What?<eos> Would you?
Please don't say hell.<eos> By the way, I happen to agree with you.<eos> I was damn lucky to get those four extra years.<eos> Sure I'd have liked more.<eos> Who wouldn't?
You put us all at risk without letting us have a say.<eos> Over guns we got nothing to do with.<eos> And I'd do it again.<eos> Well, I wouldn't.<eos> I wouldn't.
If we don't watch these, it's like we're stealing tv.<eos> Do you love that sooo-weet smell of farmer Billy's bacon?<eos> Do I ever!<eos> Would you like to see how a pig goes from loving life to your fork and knife?<eos> Would I!
I don't blame her.<eos> I blame you.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> Your mother loved Julian.<eos> She would never...
Actually, you'd be surprised.<eos> Look, I know this probably seems crazy... but, Erin, she never likes my boyfriends, and I really want her to like you.<eos> - Relax.<eos> She's gonna love me.<eos> - Well, she'd better.
I can't believe I repeated that cycle with you.<eos> - Well, you did.<eos> - Well, I'm sorry, Elliot.<eos> - I'd let you give me a manicure.<eos> - You would ?
No way.<eos> Seeing you with your old gang made me think bad thoughts.<eos> Your friends cheapen you, Tommy.<eos> You're just pissed off that they didn't recognize you when you walked in.<eos> And why would they?
How are we fixed for witness assistance?<eos> Does the Department have sufficient funds to ensure pre-trial security... for any endangered witnesses?<eos> We have the resources that the city can afford, I'm sure.<eos> I understand you're in no position to criticize the Mayor.<eos> - Nor would I.
How exactly would they accomplish this sort of thing?<eos> Someone took all her dreams away.<eos> What was is no more.<eos> I mean, it's not like she wanted to end up sleeping in a barrel.<eos> Who would?
Yay!<eos> Let's ride the train!<eos> The train!<eos> Would you like to ride the train with me, and start a magical journey?<eos> Yes I would, Mr. Jefferson.
There's nowhere for you to run now.<eos> Forget it.<eos> I can't get arrested by those guys, not now. Then I'll be a decoy!<eos> You run away while I have everybody's attention.<eos> Why would you--
He may be right to fear.<eos> Someone has been feeding you a poison.<eos> It's the only possibility left.<eos> But the doctors have never found evidence.<eos> They wouldn't.
Eh, either one.<eos> Well, that's cocky, Ben.<eos> No, not cocky, confident.<eos> I'd like to see you prove that.<eos> You would?
Ridiculous.<eos> Humiliating.<eos> I cried for three days.<eos> Does the general know about this?<eos> How would he?
That's... liable... to be thousands.<eos> Then we'll read thousands.<eos> Start with that one.<eos> Perhaps you gentlemen would like some tea while you wait?<eos> No, they wouldn't.
I think you are.<eos> I think you're very nice, too.<eos> Would you like to come home with me?<eos> I know, I can't believe I said it, either.<eos> But would you?
Can I stay here?<eos> Just on the floor?<eos> Do you want to come up here?<eos> Would you like to do it?<eos> If you would.
I'm Barry and this is my brother Harry.<eos> Finally.<eos> I've heard so much about you from Russell.<eos> Glad you made it here all right.<eos> Why wouldn't we?
I can take care of this myself.<eos> Gil, do me a favor. Get a sports car.<eos> It's a lot cheaper and easier to handle.<eos> I'd like to come in.<eos> Of course you would.
Then tell us, Rosie, how it was.<eos> Uh, Toya... loved her... her... butterfly wind chimes.<eos> I put'em up in a window... for her.<eos> Then he'd come at night... late at night.<eos> Who would?
Their names were Orville and Wilbur Wright.<eos> Would anyone like to see a picture of their aeroplane?<eos> - Me.<eos> - Yes, ma'am.<eos> You all would.
I don´t know.<eos> Go tell her that she has nice hair or thatyou like her sweater or something.<eos> Why don't you go tell her?<eos> Because I think it would mean more coming from you.<eos> Why would she -
- No I should get home.<eos> But you'll invite me to your recital right?<eos> I mean when it happens.<eos> You'd want to come?<eos> Of course I would.
-He never said anything to me.<eos> -That´s not surprising.<eos> Many patients are uncomfortable discussing it with traditional practitioners. I´m sure you did all you could to help him.<eos> -What are you implying?<eos> -Nothing, but what would you...
Rach, she's not gonna remember this.<eos> I guess.<eos> Oh, I just had such an idea of what this day would be like, you know?<eos> Emma laughing and everybody gathered around her cake, singing "Happy Birthday."<eos> And then we would all...
I know, which is why I was so surprised you didn't want to spend the evening with her.<eos> - I do!<eos> - Then you should've come!<eos> - I couldn't!<eos> - You wouldn't!
There's no rule that says he has to bounce back right away?<eos> It's been a year and a half since the accident<eos> If he did something<eos> If he got a job, I think he'd feel better<eos> He would? Or you would?
A plastic surgeon giving his mistress implants... so that she can be more sexually uninhibited with him.<eos> Don't you find that unsettling?<eos> Wait a minute.<eos> Who am I talking with?<eos> Of course you wouldn't.
You work for Armadillo?<eos> You've seen him in town?<eos> No. Everything goes through Duardo.<eos> - You know where we can find Armadillo?<eos> - No, but Duardo would.
You, Geoffrey Tennant, are a coward.<eos> Fardels!<eos> Fardels.<eos> So... Would you care to comment on any other productions currently onstage at the festival?<eos> Yes, Oliver, I would.
(Danny) Durand and Hastings are on the move.<eos> (Ruth) 'They're selling to the Chinese.<eos> Keep Jean-Luc distracted.'<eos> - He knows we're on to them.<eos> - 'How? ' Because I would.
Moving to the economy, do today's unemployment figures indicate recession?<eos> Recession means two consecutive quarters of negative growth.<eos> That's not the situation.<eos> How would you characterize the economy, then?<eos> - I wouldn't.
- Out of my way<eos> "That night, all sense of reasoning deserted me"<eos> "I was left vacillating as if between pendulous scales"<eos> "You wouldn't want me to displease my father to make you happy..."<eos> would you?
You know what I think?<eos> I think you are literally going buggy living in that house.<eos> Yeah, you should move.<eos> You're rummaging around in an empty nursery. You're living with a talking parrot who won't even speak to you.<eos> Never would.
You know, I really believed they had a chance.<eos> Then you came along.<eos> Lilo, honey, we have to...<eos> Don't worry. You're nice, and someone will give you a job.<eos> I would.
And after that, I don't care what happens to me.<eos> Don't say that.<eos> I wish there was a story about me.<eos> I don't know who would read it, though.<eos> I would.
Who's May?<eos> Some weird chick Adam just dumped.<eos> How's your lip?<eos> Stow it, all right?<eos> Would you, please?
I was gonna ask if you wanted to go someplace more quiet.<eos> I can't.<eos> I have to stay here.<eos> Right.<eos> - I would....
Are they all classical?<eos> Yep.<eos> I don't see any CDs.<eos> I only listen to records.<eos> You would, wouldn't you.
You were desperate.<eos> She's burning, but alive.<eos> What would you do?<eos> L'd let her burn.<eos> And you? L wouldn't!
The quarterback is the most important member.<eos> He is like the rudder that guides the ship.<eos> - Right.<eos> Could I give you a hand with that?<eos> - Would you really?
In Nigel's mind,<eos> Jane Galloway was someone he could control, which was okay for a while, but you... you were someone he could actually become.<eos> See, Maslow's fifth tier of the Hierarchy is Self-Actualization. I am one, and who am I?<eos> The problem for Nigel is that you would have to die in order for that to happen.<eos> Or else he would.
