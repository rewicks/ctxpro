Frankie.<eos> Frankie.<eos> Excuse me, ma'am.<eos> Did you see where my little boy was that was right here?<eos> No, I didn't.
Do exactly what he says.<eos> Come on!<eos> What kind of man shoots an innocent child?<eos> You have no idea what kind of man I am.<eos> Oh, but I do.
Summer's ending.<eos> Best summer ever.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I don't want to go back to school.<eos> Yes, you do.
I don't mean that in a salacious way at all.<eos> I just think you look great.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Don't you think she looks...<eos> You do, too, Will! Thanks.
- This is not legal.<eos> - This is not legal.<eos> He's right.<eos> Does any man here object to the nuptials?<eos> - I do. - Congratulations.
15 years ago.<eos> Attorney: Who else knew?<eos> I acted alone.<eos> Investigator: When did he tell you he started this Ponzi scheme?<eos> He didn't.
I acted alone.<eos> Investigator: When did he tell you he started this Ponzi scheme?<eos> He didn't.<eos> And the entire time he was running it, you had no idea?<eos> - No, I didn't. - Cacioppi:
- Yes, it did.<eos> - Did it have a tennis court?<eos> - It did not.<eos> - Did it have a pond?<eos> - Yes, it did.
I visited their headquarters a few days ago.<eos> It's interesting, and like you said, maybe it's time to make a difference.<eos> Listening to me now?<eos> They want you, too.<eos> Good one, Z. Too right, they do.
It's-it's fine.<eos> It just slipped a little bit.<eos> Uh, no, I think we want to come back up now.<eos> No, no, no, no.<eos> We don't.
They bum me out with their upbeat attitude.<eos> All they ever do is make me feel more alone.<eos> Are you real?<eos> So, why did you quit writing?<eos> I didn't.
Okay.<eos> They are like dinosaures with that 20 tonns body and tiny little brains.<eos> And all tastes like shit too.<eos> Why do people eat?<eos> The don't.
You want anything special for dinner tomorrow night?<eos> Maybe I'll roast a chicken.<eos> 18.<eos> Doesn't make sense.<eos> Sure it does.
The tabby.<eos> But that kitty likes me.<eos> That'll make it easier to catch.<eos> I did very good work today.<eos> I did many kitties and many doggies.
Hey, Sherlock.<eos> Yes.<eos> I... so like you.<eos> Did I ever say?<eos> Yes, yes, you did.
Riley, this is starting to freak me out.<eos> I know, I don't get it at all.<eos> If it were a plague, where are all the bodies?<eos> I mean, if it were aliens, where are the ships?<eos> I don't...
I want you to meet somebody.<eos> You did very good.<eos> You remember my sister, you met her at my wedding.<eos> Stefania... Do you remember me?<eos> - No, you don't - no.
Tell me about your morning.<eos> Start from the beginning.<eos> I woke up.<eos> How did you sleep?<eos> I didn't.
And you are done with the world being explained to you by a man.<eos> Well, who isn't?<eos> So all he needed to do was find the first available lunchtime appointment with a female therapist within cycling distance of your surgery.<eos> My God, he knows you!<eos> No, he doesn't.
I spent a whole evening with her.<eos> We had chips.<eos> I think she liked me.<eos> You don't know Faith.<eos> You simply do not.
And again.<eos> I don't... want to die.<eos> Once more, for luck.<eos> I don't want to die.<eos> I don't.
It's... it's a sort of experiment.<eos> I'm not an experiment, Sherlock.<eos> No, I know you're not an experiment, you're my friend.<eos> We're friends, but, please, just say those words for me.<eos> Please don't do this.
Come on.<eos> Just a second.<eos> Dougie?<eos> Ma'am, do you know this man?<eos> Yes, of course I do.
Gordon.<eos> Whoa.<eos> We used to smoke together, way back when.<eos> You remember?<eos> Yeah, we sure did, Gordon.
Whoa.<eos> We used to smoke together, way back when.<eos> You remember?<eos> Yeah, we sure did, Gordon.<eos> We sure did.
- You really need to leave.<eos> This is just a practice sword.<eos> It doesn't even have an edge.<eos> Trust me... you don't wanna know what it feels like to have a practice sword smack you hard on the side of the face.<eos> I already do.
So... why did you give Jeri that bowl?<eos> Dredged up so many old memories... pushed down.<eos> Locked away.<eos> - That make any sense?<eos> it does.
So what does that mean?<eos> My... my dead father's been spying on me?<eos> I think you need a little rest.<eos> Why did you frame Danny?<eos> I didn't.
Must cost a lot to maintain this house.<eos> We're both retired.<eos> The extra money from the room comes in very handy for daily things.<eos> Did you take your pills, dear?<eos> Yes, I did.
Glad to see you've cheered up.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> Yesterday. You seemed all down in the dumps.<eos> I'm amazed you noticed.<eos> We all did.
Oh, it's totally cool.<eos> - Sorry we didn't get you out of here.<eos> - Well, sure tried.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, we did.
And, so, later, just swing by my office, okay?<eos> Yes!<eos> Well... congrats, Mickey.<eos> Thanks. I know you don't mean that, but, whatever.<eos> No, I do. Seriously.
I chased after her." All right?<eos> This... this guy is a wimp.<eos> He's not gonna fight for you.<eos> You want someone who is gonna fight for you!<eos> No, Dustin, I don't.
This... this guy is a wimp.<eos> He's not gonna fight for you.<eos> You want someone who is gonna fight for you!<eos> No, Dustin, I don't.<eos> Please, I don't.
How do you know that?<eos> I saw you.<eos> I watched you.<eos> I know you love him.<eos> I do, too.
I saw you.<eos> I watched you.<eos> I know you love him.<eos> I do, too.<eos> We all do.
Look at her and tell me I'm wrong.<eos> She is the perfect example of these humans and unworthy of your sympathy in every way.<eos> Destroy her, Diana.<eos> You know that she deserves.<eos> That they all do.
- Did you know?<eos> - What, know?<eos> - Did you know?<eos> - Did i...<eos> - Because I do, now.
Mr. Gunns, I wanna apologize for what happened.<eos> You've given me encouragement and wisdom and a helping hand, and I just want you to know that what they're saying about me is not true.<eos> I did not pull a gun on Chips Henderson and definitely didn't rob him.<eos> I know.<eos> - You do?
- My tio, Papa Fuerte, okay?<eos> He can take you out like that.<eos> - So, don't test me, Shao!<eos> - Yeah, you know what I heard today?<eos> That nigga old, he done for.
No. I was just thinking, uh, maybe she's heard from her.<eos> I don't want to worry her.<eos> Right, but, you know, they're pretty close.<eos> I mean, maybe she knows where she is.<eos> And what if she doesn't?
Buddy!<eos> I missed you so much!<eos> You been feeding my dog?<eos> Pedigree, lamb and rice blend, he loves that shit.<eos> Yeah, he does.
Yes, a good man who killed his wife for convenience.<eos> You know nothing.<eos> Always cow-eyed about your sainted mother.<eos> Or maybe it's about time you know about your mother.<eos> I do.
I've been thinking a lot about what happened, and... and I think we were right.<eos> There wasn't the time for such...<eos> ~ And we have plenty of time.<eos> ~ No.<eos> No, we don't.
No, we don't.<eos> When you first came back, you told me you loved me.<eos> ~ I would never have thought...<eos> ~ But you don't think.<eos> Do you?
Hey, there.<eos> Hey.<eos> You know me, right?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, of course, you do.
- I believe you did.<eos> - I did not say that.<eos> - I believe you did. - No.<eos> No, I didn't. I...<eos> - You did, Dick.
We're just asking for one night off.<eos> Well... not quite sure what to say.<eos> Just thought the crepes would be a special treat, but... we... we don't have to have 'em.<eos> Not if people don't want them.<eos> No, we do.
But now it appears that the mother of that child wasn't my ex-girlfriend, but it was her mother. And I can only assume that it was my horrible letter that in some way pushed the friend...<eos> Emma: Hello again, Tony.<eos> Emma.<eos> Oh, hi, Emma.<eos> How we doing?
Everybody else at American Atheists are pretending like nothing's happened.<eos> What makes you different?<eos> You have any idea what it's like to grow up black and gay in Texas?<eos> Um, no.<eos> Neither did Madalyn.
But we've considered a GSA in the past, and the board's unanimous decision has always been that it's more of a social hour and not a formal club... that the district should fund.<eos> Well, then, we need to vote again.<eos> I was never part of that.<eos> I was with Howie when he did the research on how many schools actually have it,<eos> - and the overwhelming majority do.
It was chaos.<eos> They were everywhere.<eos> Some of the kids were running. But for everyone else it, it was like there was nothing there.<eos> They couldn't see a thing.<eos> We did.
Remember?<eos> He can still hear you.<eos> Then he can hear me say he needs to shut up so we can figure out how to fight the Ghost Riders.<eos> You don't need to figure it out.<eos> Because Douglas already did.
She was the only one left.<eos> She had to fill a void.<eos> So she filled it with her son.<eos> And you saw this kid?<eos> We all did.
And we didn't get to be that way. By taking orders from other people.<eos> Well, margot...<eos> We don't need margot.<eos> If justine wants us to take down this smuggling ring...<eos> Which she emphatically does not.
If whoever killed the kincaids was after that money...<eos> They're gonna come after tommy next.<eos> I'm calling him right now.<eos> Does alice know you're here?<eos> No. She doesn't.
Are you alone?<eos> Where did you come from?<eos> She doesn't understand you.<eos> Well, she may not understand me, but she seems to know you.<eos> Well, at least somebody does.
You were quite alone when we found you.<eos> That's not possible.<eos> She wouldn't have left me.<eos> Well, she might have thought you were dead.<eos> We did.
I can't believe it's really you.<eos> Why didn't you help me?<eos> I thought I'd killed you.<eos> So you just got on with it and left me to die?<eos> But you didn't.
Father, he died when I was a child.<eos> No, no, I heard him!<eos> He's here.<eos> I heard him. Yes.<eos> Yes, of course you did.
The stone giants.<eos> The eternal warriors.<eos> To stop glinda permanently.<eos> It took magic to raise them, and the wizard doesn't have any.<eos> But nahara does, doesn't she?
Creditors respond to money.<eos> And they respond to influence.<eos> Her family has both.<eos> I understand.<eos> But... so does mine.
Perhaps we didn't.<eos> Just the battle.<eos> Does your son want to be a policeman?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, he does.
You're Jake, right?<eos> I'm Lenny. - I really dug the play.<eos> - Oh, thanks.<eos> I work at LDM on the future lit side if you got a screenplay.<eos> I-I do, yeah.
Hey, Alvey.<eos> Alvey:<eos> I got a class. Catch you guys later.<eos> Hey, Lisa tell you I'm on the card?<eos> Yeah, she did.
He's from Manchester.<eos> It's kind of, like, a rough area.<eos> Well, good.<eos> I don't want you to feel inferior.<eos> [Glass thuds] I don't.
What's the game?<eos> What's the game?<eos> You sure you want to know my game?<eos> Oh, you don't even have one.<eos> No, I do.
Now there's a good chance we're going all the way, and I'm talking the College World Series.<eos> That has never happened for this school.<eos> All we need is a little more cash to improve our training facilities, and we'll bring home that trophy.<eos> Plus... did I mention... how incredibly hot you look today?<eos> - You did.
- He's okay.<eos> He said it was a mistake, but... (sighs) he was at the hospital and he, like, escaped or something, and we thought that he might be on his way back to L.A.<eos> He had mentioned that he has a bunch of, like, film festivals and meetings coming up.<eos> I'm really sorry to hear that, but you know Emmett and I broke up two months ago, right?<eos> No, I... I didn't.
Well, we were mad scientists.<eos> Uh, the attic access was in your aunt Lila's room.<eos> This was Maggie's.<eos> You changed it.<eos> Yes, I did.
I'm not going anywhere.<eos> Sure you are.<eos> You're going to New York.<eos> - Max Peron?<eos> - How you doing, Max?
Let him go!<eos> Can't do it.<eos> Try this.<eos> No!<eos> Don't do that!
Was it?<eos> Or was it fucking amazing?<eos> That was fucking amazing.<eos> Like... I thought I was gonna die!<eos> But you didn't, did you?
Oh, no. No way.<eos> This does not leave the safe space.<eos> People need to see this.<eos> It will change them.<eos> No, they don't.
Anyway.<eos> Didn't realize you were such a stoner, Clay.<eos> I didn't realize you cared.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Of course I don't.
Last summer he told me I was trouble, and that I'd better toe the line. That's just a thing he says to guys.<eos> You got it way easier than Alex.<eos> With the hair.<eos> So, he didn't like Alex either.<eos> Well, he kind of did.
Because you're not the class slut.<eos> - Don't say that.<eos> - Everybody says it!<eos> - I don't say it.<eos> - Yes, you did.
I don't wanna be here.<eos> You know, I have pride like you.<eos> And I love Flo.<eos> You know, we both did.<eos> Do.
However, you can have a little dinner, some drinks, share a few laughs.<eos> There is nothing like beautiful women that smell good to make you feel human again.<eos> I wouldn't know anything about that.<eos> D-d-did you say "wives," meaning plural?<eos> Hell yes, I did.
Or we could just go.<eos> - You want to go? - Nah.<eos> We can do this.<eos> Yeah, I know we can.<eos> How you doing? !
There were always babies crying.<eos> I knew they had problems, but I didn't think they were mine to solve.<eos> I thought there were stronger or smarter people there than me.<eos> W-Who the hell am I, right?<eos> So I did nothing.
Put your hands on your head.<eos> I didn't have a choice.<eos> Why are you here?<eos> I said I didn't have a choice.<eos> But you do, both of you do.
You are smart, hot as hell, dignified as shit, and you don't suffer one goddamn fool.<eos> No one's gonna wanna watch you die.<eos> I don't wanna see that.<eos> So you don't have to.<eos> But someone does.
Well, then just talk to somebody else.<eos> I'm not going to call them.<eos> It looks weak.<eos> Lisa, all due respect, you said that I was gonna have leverage.<eos> And you do.
Yeah.<eos> - You want a Xanax? - Yes.<eos> All right.<eos> Jesus.<eos> How you doing, sir?
What are you talking about?<eos> What am I talking about?<eos> You didn't see the fucking gigantic stand<eos> - right by the door right there?<eos> - No, I didn't.
There's an ATM down the street. - An ATM?<eos> - Mm-hmm, with money.<eos> Oh, fuck, man.<eos> [Whispers] I want to.<eos> - You do? - I do.
And... how does that make you feel?<eos> Huh?<eos> No. You asked me how I define the person called me.<eos> And I'm saying, I'm always having thoughts of...<eos> What do ya?
We talked, and I think we got past it.<eos> What do you...<eos> No.<eos> Just...<eos> No, you didn't...
And now, he's begging me.<eos> "Emmit, please, take the damn stamps, give me the car."<eos> What's that old quote, that...<eos> "The greatest trick the Devil ever pulled was convincing the world he didn't exist."<eos> How did you?
We've got four hours.<eos> Phone records.<eos> Where did you get that?<eos> Doesn't matter where we got it.<eos> The hell it doesn't.
I'll help you find the meeting spot... but then I'm out.<eos> I'm here.<eos> Hey. Did the inspector come?<eos> No.<eos> What if he did?
Eli Harris built this town from nothing with little more than his bare hands.<eos> His name is carved into the cornerstone of the very building we are sitting in right now.<eos> Should we be surprised that he had flaws?<eos> I don't think so.<eos> What great man doesn't?
You're always so fucking amused.<eos> We all make choices.<eos> Like when I chose to believe you that Crystal Harris didn't know I killed that hacker chick?<eos> Well, guess what.<eos> She does.
Understood?<eos> Something you should know.<eos> What?<eos> Iran doesn't want a nuclear weapon.<eos> It never did.
Absolutely.<eos> One-hundred percent?<eos> Because I don't want to mess him up.<eos> He wanted me to meet some guy before I went to Africa...<eos> Saad did.
Tovah Rivlin, Mossad agent.<eos> I need what you have on her...<eos> Movements and contacts for the past two weeks.<eos> So, even if we had such information...<eos> You do.
General, you were in the Pentagon on 9/11.<eos> That's right.<eos> You had a plane come right through your office window.<eos> Where did you run to?<eos> - We didn't.
Andrew Keane just ran away.<eos> Cowardice runs in the family.<eos> Dar Adal's handiwork.<eos> You don't know that.<eos> Of course I do.
The deal with Iran has been formally adopted.<eos> It's settled policy.<eos> Any attempt to undermine it's-- Treason.<eos> You have proof of all this, I'm assuming.<eos> I do.
Yes, of course. I'll find someone.<eos> She didn't deserve this, okay?<eos> - Any of it.<eos> She's...<eos> - No. No. No one does.
And by "I," I mean Dr. Miller.<eos> I would love to, but I don't have a patient in 3.<eos> Your, uh, Magic Mike?<eos> I told Williams to discharge him.<eos> You did?
Why would the guy buy a car when he can buy a truck?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Two shots, two ducks.<eos> You like this, you dumb fuck?<eos> Yeah, you do.
If there is slaughter, Lord, and there appears to be slaughter, why do we ride towards it?<eos> We are curious.<eos> Fight the Dane!<eos> Test your sword-craft!<eos> Do battle with a turd, directly from the devil's arse!
You're just gonna leave him?<eos> Well, here's the good news.<eos> If this thing with Kevin doesn't work, who gives a shit?<eos> Officer Koalafart here is gonna drown in the flood tomorrow along with all the rest of us.<eos> But if it does work, sweet Lorelei...
Lost, unsettled.<eos> Seduced by the West.<eos> You don't know anything about me.<eos> I know decadence.<eos> So does your brother.
It's okay.<eos> Good. Good.<eos> I-I need you to count how many men there were, what they were wearing, what they were saying.<eos> Excuse me, Jennifer, just for a second, okay?<eos> Hey, how you doing?
Uh, Mariana?<eos> Yeah, we based your credentials around an agent who's on leave, but we haven't had time to backstop everything.<eos> Will it get me through security or not?<eos> We think so, but I'd feel better if we had a little more time.<eos> Yeah, well, we don't.
What Nicole said... that there's something inside you that... scares her?<eos> Yeah?<eos> I know what that is.<eos> Because I have it, too.<eos> We all do.
Break him out, you tit?<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> It's not Alcatraz!<eos> You got a better idea?<eos> As a matter of fact, I do.
She came into my restaurant and we just...<eos> I already heard all of that.<eos> She took pity on you because you needed a friend.<eos> Yeah, I did.<eos> But so did she.
and I'm gonna tell Bay as soon as I see her. Mom, he's a good guy who just got me through something big, and if you're happy, then I'm happy, and I'm sure Bay will be too.<eos> Wow.<eos> Everybody is handling this much better than I thought they would.<eos> Wait... he doesn't have a crazy ex-wife, does he?<eos> No, he does not!
Refuse... and he dies... along with the rest of the men who followed him here.<eos> And from what I understand, he is the one who matters most to you.<eos> The one with whom you might lead a life if you can set aside your pride in this moment.<eos> Do not make the same mistake I did.<eos> Do the deal.
He's like any sapien.<eos> A temporary solution to a long-term problem.<eos> BPO.<eos> - How do you avoid them?<eos> - You don't.
- It is incredible.<eos> - Lito, this is a bit awkward.<eos> I thought your lawyer was gonna talk to you. I know.<eos> He said that I needed to talk to you.<eos> Oh, he did, did he?
I came alone.<eos> I just want to talk.<eos> That's all.<eos> How did you know I would be here today?<eos> Well, I didn't.
Okay, this is getting weirder and weirder.<eos> Riley?<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> - He said I had to go down the stairs.<eos> - Who did?
These people are here for me?<eos> Yes, they are.<eos> - But do they know I'm just...<eos> - Just like them?<eos> They do.
- I thought it was.<eos> Oh, God. Oh, God.<eos> What the hell, Bug?<eos> You said it worked.<eos> It did work.
Come back to my office and try me.<eos> - Never had any complaints.<eos> You know, they say a trained professional can always tell when someone's lying.<eos> That's an exaggeration. We don't always know.<eos> But right now, I do.
Oh, yeah, that's right.<eos> I came down a whole other hallway from you.<eos> You were supposed to be my riot buddy.<eos> Did you see me push him? And then kick him later?<eos> Of course I did.
I don't want to go back down to eight billion of those motherfuckers.<eos> {\pos(375,5)}( crying laugh ) {\pos(375,5)}( sniffles )<eos> I need you to say you trust me.<eos> Yeah?<eos> I do.
Because I actually came here to try to help our tiny little friend here. All right?<eos> - Not steal fine china.<eos> Or someone else's fucking boyfriend.<eos> Can't believe you just said that.<eos> I did.
Very tortured woman.<eos> But our daughter is a good girl, so, you know, I have to believe that this... life, this mother, is teaching her something, you know, building her up strong, because, uh,<eos> she's had some depression stuff this year and it got kind of serious, but, um... she's good.<eos> - Listen, I don't know you...<eos> - No, Hannah, you do not.
- Hugo, he told me he can help.<eos> - Did you sell us out, Mike? - No.<eos> I swear.<eos> - Did you sell us out?<eos> No, I didn't.
- Oh, come on, Mira.<eos> You know you can't do that.<eos> It doesn't just fuck you over, it fucks me over, too.<eos> Now my head feels so noisy.<eos> - Well, of course it does.
Remember, Grandma Loreen?<eos> Oh, no, that's right.<eos> I'll be a grandma.<eos> And when you think of grandparents, you think of death.<eos> Nuh-uh, I don't!
Exactly!<eos> Their true, deepest, most intimate selves.<eos> Exactly.<eos> And of course we know the correct answer.<eos> - Yeah, we all do. - Yeah.
What are you trying to say?<eos> There are people who think that what we did on my birthday...<eos> I don't know.<eos> You should know.<eos> And I do.
I'm in Graham Reynolds' basement. No, no, no.<eos> You can't do that.<eos> You don't... you don't just leave without telling me or Cam.<eos> I wasn't aware I needed permission.<eos> You don't.
Booth, she wants to give Zack access to the case file.<eos> No way.<eos> Get out, both of you. KAREN:<eos> Okay, just-just think about it for a minute.<eos> Out. Done. No.
No.<eos> That's... that's Parker's.<eos> He gave it to me 11 years ago.<eos> He told me he liked me.<eos> Of course he did, huh?
Doctor, the Order of St Raymond Nonnatus is sister Mary Cynthia's family now, and she's already left for the Mother House.<eos> She'll be seen by a Chichester doctor as soon as she arrives.<eos> - Dr Turner.<eos> - Sister... did you see Sister Mary Cynthia before she left?<eos> No, I did not.
I do believe you get to see your loved ones.<eos> I'm gonna see my mom.<eos> You really think she's up there?<eos> - Watching over you?<eos> - Yeah. Actually, I do.
I've asked besma to write some statements for our guys, spin for the press.<eos> And Renee is working on my speech.<eos> Oh, and we are looking into constitutional lawyers.<eos> We're gonna need the best...<eos> - No, we don't.
Wait, why is he helping you?<eos> I couldn't get anyone else to volunteer.<eos> Yeah, that's because there's no way any of 'em are gonna make First Line.<eos> I mean, no one does before junior year.<eos> Scott did, and so did I.
Listen, Linc, I got to say something, man.<eos> Man, you got to slow your roll.<eos> Yemen is in a civil war. They're really close to collapse.<eos> It's no place for a white man with an American passport, no command of Arabic, to just show up on a whim.<eos> And yet, apparently, my brother did.
I agree, but she is dangerous.<eos> Why?<eos> Because she snapped a pic of me taking care of a friend?<eos> Hackett knows what Alison and I have been through.<eos> Everyone in this town does.
What do we think this means?<eos> It means that the world is much smaller than we ever thought.<eos> Lucas lied to us.<eos> He said he didn't know anything about Charlotte.<eos> Maybe he didn't.
No, you do not.<eos> Okay?<eos> And I've done some... really terrible things to you and everyone else.<eos> You don't need to tell me that.<eos> Yes, I do!
Then tell us who handed you the cash to make the transfer?<eos> Unless you'd rather tell the state board.<eos> Look, no...<eos> I-I don't have names.<eos> Alright. I never did.
It's not manipulation.<eos> Even if it means you have to let him go.<eos> You need to let him go.<eos> I don't need to ask him who he loves, Ali, because I know he loves me.<eos> No, he doesn't.
- No.<eos> We believe they were staying in Ambersea.<eos> I was in The Anchor all night for Sophia's party.<eos> What time did you go home?<eos> Er... well, I didn't, really.
What's the matter?<eos> What was he like...<eos> Buckley?<eos> Was an asshole who believed in aliens.<eos> You don't?
Yeah, we're working on a link between him and an ex-Spetsnaz guy named Akmal Barayev.<eos> We thought he was dead, but turns out he might not be.<eos> Chase, Fishbait, can you guys give us a minute?<eos> You trust me with your life, Ortiz?<eos> Yes, Chase, I do.
Better.<eos> You told me I could come and see you and talk to you when I was ready.<eos> No, I told you to talk to me when you finally wanted to come clean.<eos> So unless you're here to say you didn't actually see Frank in the basement that night...<eos> I did!
Before you yell at me... look at what he found.<eos> Sylvia Mahoney submitted DNA to a lab for analysis five days before Wes' death. So?<eos> My whole family had that done.<eos> Actually, I found out that I have some Japanese<eos> - in my genes. - She did the DNA test on Wes, idiot.
I love you, Michaela.<eos> And I know that you probably hate that I'm saying this right now 'cause that's the message that your face is sending me, but...<eos> I couldn't have gotten through any of this without you.<eos> I love you.<eos> I do.
That is the conclusion I'm drawing, yes.<eos> So let me go find out what she knows.<eos> You can't go by yourself.<eos> I got a gun.<eos> How y'all doing?
'Cause honestly, I feel hated.<eos> I feel like I failed you.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> Because as a mom, it is my job to deliver a world where the values that I raised you to believe in mattered.<eos> And they didn't! They didn't!
Why?<eos> Why would you do this? Huh?<eos> Why would you do any of this?<eos> No need to thank me, but I also called to confirm they received it.<eos> They did, so 7:00 a.m. sharp, Temple Street Courthouse.
I was getting tired of slumming with you anyway, watching it on a 50-inch screen.<eos> I'm gonna watch it in my bedroom, on a 70-inch, with no pants!<eos> So...<eos> We haven't had a chance to connect since the divorce.<eos> H-How you doing?
As you can see, I'm more than all right.<eos> I'm very well, in fact.<eos> How...?<eos> I always told you I'd get better. You just never believed me.<eos> Sure I did.
I didn't want to drag you into my shit.<eos> It's a little too late for that.<eos> Don't you get it, you idiot?<eos> Everything's changed because of you.<eos> No more killing, no more racing, I don't...
Everything's changed because of you.<eos> No more killing, no more racing, I don't...<eos> I just want to move on. Your incessantly annoying morality speech finally got to me.<eos> Just hope you found whatever it was you were looking for here.<eos> I did.
Just curious.<eos> We don't care for Red River folks.<eos> Least of all, Sheriff Leon.<eos> Where'd you say you're from again?<eos> I didn't.
Jimmy will most likely break in while he thinks I'm sleeping...<eos> I mean, I wouldn't put anything past him.<eos> It just makes the most sense He'll try to steal the tape under cover of darkness.<eos> You really think he's going to do that?<eos> I do, indeed.
Camille lives wherever she wants.<eos> Homes all over the globe.<eos> She's always liked to spend the winters in Agra.<eos> She loves the smell of lotus blossoms.<eos> Who doesn't?
If he says he's gonna rescue Madzie, we need to be here when he comes back.<eos> - Sure.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> But at what point do we say he's been gone too long?<eos> We don't.
The power core's up here on the roof, behind this access hatch.<eos> Unfortunately, it's impervious to the unlock rune.<eos> You're the head of the institute.<eos> You telling me you don't have a key?<eos> I do, in my office.
It's a little complicated.<eos> A little?<eos> Oh, and for the record, this is how I wanted to approach things in the first place.<eos> Only because you enjoy killing a lot of people.<eos> As if you don't.
I thought it should be personal.<eos> You were just trying to make me think I had the upper hand.<eos> (chuckles): It all fell into place.<eos> How did you know that Barbara would show up at the warehouse?<eos> I didn't.
Why did you come?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Maybe you wanted to come home.<eos> I don't have a home.<eos> Yes, you do, Caitlin.
I don't know.<eos> Maybe you wanted to come home.<eos> I don't have a home.<eos> Yes, you do, Caitlin.<eos> You do. With your friends. With me.
I will take on his guards.<eos> Yurievich--<eos> Yurievich is mine.<eos> Please tell me you didn't sleep down here.<eos> I didn't...
Right, but she's fine.<eos> She doesn't know what happened.<eos> I'm not gonna let them talk like that about her.<eos> I'm obviously gonna want to protect her.<eos> And I don't?
- That, uh, creeped you out, as I recall.<eos> - Mmm-hmm.<eos> Yeah. It was another set of eyes watching me have sex.<eos> - He didn't know what he was seeing.<eos> - He absolutely did.
Showing it off campus.<eos> All's well that ends well, right?<eos> So, clearly I'm a disaster, and the universe is telling me that this is not my thing.<eos> Come on.<eos> How did Oli do today?
Hey.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> Um, your mom sent my mom a permission slip.<eos> - Do you not want me here? - N...<eos> No, of course I do.
I don't know--<eos> I know you've seen this scumbag.<eos> He lives in this neighborhood!<eos> I don't know everybody, dude.<eos> I don't!
The good, the bad, and the ugly I know, and you don't need to punish yourself or isolate yourself, but what you need to do is stop pushing me away because I'm not going anywhere, Oliver!<eos> Do you get that?<eos> What do you want me to do, John?<eos> I've told you what I am, who I am, and even if you don't believe it, I do.<eos> I do.
And do you take Robin to be your lawfully wedded wife?<eos> Sí.<eos> And do you, Robin, take Carlos as your lawfully wedded husband?<eos> I...<eos> I do.
We live here. Are you from the street?<eos> What's that supposed to mean?<eos> N-no. N-no. No, I j...<eos> [Laughs Nervously] M... Uh, maybe I made a mistake.<eos> Yeah, you did.
Was this woman on your bus? I don't think she ever got on.<eos> But she left her bag.<eos> Hey!<eos> You know her?<eos> Yes, I do, amigo!
We've got nothing.<eos> Actually, we have less than nothing.<eos> There's something you should know.<eos> The Clave doesn't have the Soul Sword.<eos> They never did.
Once we have the mirror, none of this will matter.<eos> I can't have Clary hate me.<eos> Not after everything I've been through.<eos> Clary doesn't care about you.<eos> Yes, she does.
Well, then...<eos> What?<eos> Do you not want to?<eos> No. I mean, yes.<eos> Of course I do.
And why didn't it destroy the sword?<eos> What if the mirror I destroyed isn't the Mortal Mirror?<eos> Then why would your mom give it to the warlocks to protect?<eos> Maybe she thought it was.<eos> We all did.
He's not getting out alive.<eos> You forgot something.<eos> Ahh! ALEC: Go after him!<eos> Doesn't it seem strange that Clary's runes would be powerful enough to destroy a Mortal Instrument?<eos> AR I didn't that Cladestroy the mirror.
- No. I don't remember this man.<eos> When he was murdered, I was living in Italy.<eos> So you say you left the UK in March, Sara,<eos> - and went to Europe for nine months. - I don't "say" it.<eos> I did.
- 'OK, guv.'<eos> Maybe it was this that prompted his breakdown.<eos> The timing seems a bit coincidental, doesn't it?<eos> Though how it connects to David Walker...<eos> - If it even does.
Maybe it was this that prompted his breakdown.<eos> The timing seems a bit coincidental, doesn't it?<eos> Though how it connects to David Walker...<eos> - If it even does.<eos> - If it even does. Yeah.
Worked out a deal?<eos> With a man who casually murdered countless belters.<eos> A man who was a threat to all human life, and that is why Miller shot him.<eos> He didn't have the right to make that decision.<eos> But you do?
The Nauvoo just missed!<eos> How the hell did it change course?<eos> What the fuck?<eos> The Nauvoo didn't move.<eos> Eros did.
Guys?<eos> What the hell just happened?<eos> The Nauvoo just missed!<eos> The Nauvoo didn't move, Miller.<eos> Eros did.
Yeah.<eos> Yeah, must be real tough growing' up under a blue sky... Eight parents slobbering all over you.<eos> Hey, now. Wait till you get to know him better.<eos> He's got lots of layers.<eos> Yeah. So does a rock tunnel.
We look out for each other.<eos> You sure he's clear on that?<eos> Pretty sure.<eos> You did hear the part about him throwing me off the ship without my helmet, right?<eos> -I did.
You look beautiful.<eos> Dear friends, we've come together in this church on this day so that the Lord may strengthen and seal this union, so that Christ may bless this love.<eos> Do you have the ring?<eos> Francis Scott Fitzgerald, do you take Zelda Sayre for your lawful wife, to have and to hold from this day forward, for better, for worse, for richer, for poorer, in sickness and in health, until death do you part?<eos> I do.

No.<eos> - Why the fascination?<eos> - No, I was curious...<eos> Oh, yeah, I like it when you're jealous, though.<eos> No, you don't.
Yeah, you're probably right.<eos> But you can't control what he does, and maybe... maybe he really loves her.<eos> He doesn't.<eos> - Well, you don't know that.<eos> - Yeah, I do.
Mommy's gonna be president again.<eos> But you said that if any one of us objects that you're not gonna do it.<eos> Yeah, but I didn't expect anybody to object, did I?<eos> This was a test, folks, and you all failed.<eos> You really did.
Sources in the restricted area?<eos> The very same.<eos> And the simplest explanation for your grating obsession with the white walkers is that you're telling the truth and that you saw what you say you saw.<eos> So, you believe me.<eos> I do.
You deserved better. Both of you.<eos> Hey.<eos> Mom.<eos> You should really sleep, Sam.<eos> The dead don't.
I'm fine.<eos> I don't need your help, James. I got this far without you.<eos> I'm gonna keep going.<eos> You saw the news?<eos> I did, yeah.
And I never know anymore whether he's making some excuse. Just to keep in contact with me or do... you know?<eos> Are you sure you don't want to go visit the man. And get things settled?<eos> He kept you out of jail, And that's settled enough for me.<eos> Praise the lord!<eos> How you doing?
And so we've had to look hard for cuts.<eos> And unfortunately, the music ministry. Is one of those areas.<eos> That is unfortunate.<eos> And since you were the last person hired in the department, Well, you know the rest.<eos> I do, actually.
The truth is my only compass.<eos> That's a nice compass to have.<eos> I don't have the luxury of getting lost.<eos> I'm the first female governor of this state.<eos> Neither do I.
Turn to page 23.<eos> The Reckoning.<eos> "Let me make myself clear."<eos> I do not seek the white man's approval.<eos> I never did.
Yeah, I think that might sound wiser than it is.<eos> Wow.<eos> Okay, wiseass.<eos> So you know what happens after you die?<eos> Yes, I do.
All of them? All of the police are dead?<eos> Worse things out tonight than you.<eos> Do you have a car?<eos> Yes.<eos> I do.
He ain't lookin' back.<eos> I did. And I'm not.<eos> Shadow made my heart beat again.<eos> Why do men like anal sex?<eos> 'Cause women don't.
Now, maybe if you made your move at dinnertime, you'd've got past the gate. But you'd've ran right into the marshal's office across the street.<eos> How you know where the marshal office is?<eos> You ever hear of the Macon 7?<eos> All the same, why you care we get ourselves kilt?<eos> I don't.
He must have poked through a vein.<eos> Go get a doctor out here.<eos> Grab that sheet. Tear it in strips.<eos> How do you know what to do?<eos> I just do. Aah!
Get down! Hold your fire!<eos> Hold your fire!<eos> God.<eos> They stopped shooting.<eos> Of course they did.
Something happened, didn't it?<eos> Did you kill him?<eos> This is not gonna be good.<eos> This is not gonna be good.<eos> You did, didn't you?
Otherwise... we're both dead.<eos> Make a choice, Jim.<eos> I didn't think you had it in you.<eos> I know.<eos> You never did.
- Okay.<eos> - Just, um... yeah... okay, open 'em.<eos> I know you wanted to unpack slowly, like a normal couple, but I don't know... between our jobs and the S.T.A.R. Labs museum and... do you hate it?<eos> N-no, no, I don't hate it.<eos> You do.
You're gonna have to come and claim him.<eos> That's Arwen.<eos> That's... Arwen.<eos> I take it you also want the customary 24 hours to prepare? Do I want the customary...<eos> Yes, you do.
Francisco here could vibe it.<eos> And you're sure you can do that?<eos> No, no. Not at all.<eos> But Gypsy did say I could do some pretty incredible things<eos> - with my powers... - Yeah, she did.
You going somewhere?<eos> Yeah, I just wanna get back to S.T.A.R. Labs and train.<eos> Seeing as how you exploded on Barry in front of everyone, might want to wait on it.<eos> Well, the truth had to come out, so...<eos> Yeah, it did.
♪ And me... ♪<eos> What a singer, huh?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - You know her?<eos> Yeah, I do.
I don't care what it takes. I don't care what I have to do.<eos> I swear to you, I will find you a cure.<eos> Caitlin, I love you.<eos> I don't love you, Julian.<eos> I never did.
'We have a big problem, Alan.'<eos> Is this about the Chinese distributors?<eos> They are threatening to pull out because they think that Tangey's role as the Time Sorceress is a ghost.<eos> - So..<eos> - So they don't do ghosts.
He didn't really feel the love story.<eos> Okay.<eos> I, I thought Mike Tanen loved the script.<eos> Oh, he does.<eos> Really, he does.
Your mother didn't want to talk to me.<eos> But, um, I'm giving you a chance to come clean so how about it?<eos> Do yourself a favor and stay the hell away from me.<eos> If you don't tell me the truth, someone else will!<eos> Someone always does.
I had a meeting today at Newcastle and they told me they're firing Jake off his movie.<eos> I'm pretty sure he doesn't know.<eos> I mean, I should tell him right?<eos> Should I tell him?<eos> No. Don't.
Or did you figure out how to get Tangey back where she belongs?<eos> So sorry, Nina.<eos> I tried to stop her.<eos> - Try harder next time.<eos> - I did, but she...
Stop!<eos> Rainer!<eos> Rainer Devon?<eos> Do you need a ride?<eos> - As a matter of fact, I do.
We're okay.<eos> Whatever you guys are doing, keep doing it.<eos> I think they're siphoning directly from you.<eos> But I don't have any magic.<eos> Of course you do, luv.
Especially those who are secretly my mother.<eos> Well, I think you'll make an exception when you hear what I have to say.<eos> I don't have an eternity here.<eos> Oh, yes.<eos> Actually, I do.
Your baby already has a mother.<eos> I just want you to get to know her.<eos> And five... Hakeem. What's your grandmother doing here?<eos> Uh, hi, Ms. Walker.<eos> How you doing?
This is how I do business, Giuliana.<eos> It's how I've always done business.<eos> Nessa's fine with it.<eos> So, you have an agreement?<eos> We do.
We are suing Empire Enterprises for $50 million.<eos> We are also demanding that Hakeem Lyon cancel all upcoming club appearances and issue a public apology to Kennedy and to all women for the culture of violence and misogyny he and his music encourages.<eos> This is way out of control.<eos> Does Dad know about this?<eos> Well, he does now.
Okay, but I'm not challenging that.<eos> Make your history.<eos> I'm-a make my own history.<eos> Or I should say, I'm-a try to rewrite the history of you and your crazy-ass family.<eos> Do Inferno.
Prince of Hell.<eos> It's just a name.<eos> Doesn't mean anything.<eos> Still, the crown is yours if you want it.<eos> I don't.
Hayden was hooking up with this older guy on the DL, and she was really into him, but he was a total stalker.<eos> Texting constantly, ultra possessive.<eos> Skeeved her friend out so much she narc'd to Hayden's brother.<eos> Guess that explains why he was there.<eos> I did good, right?
Okay, so you're here for my hands?<eos> We want you.<eos> Look, you got more field experience than the next thousand angels combined.<eos> I think you overestimate me.<eos> I don't.
The... the s-system is very much I-intact.<eos> But you can disarm it?<eos> I'm not really known for my Patience.<eos> I don't quite have the means...<eos> Who does?
I wouldn't say that.<eos> It's better than this.<eos> Well, I don't know.<eos> Ain't so bad here, if you like killing angels.<eos> And you do?
- Same on the way back?<eos> - Same on the way back.<eos> - Well, that makes sense.<eos> - Glad you're happy.<eos> Except you didn't.
What are you even doing with it?<eos> - Look, everybody has it!<eos> All right?<eos> - No, they don't.<eos> I don't!
[Jacqueline] Here's how we handle DJ Fingablast.<eos> Men always want what they can't have.<eos> Cuban cigars, a watchable Superman movie.<eos> Just act like you don't want the gig.<eos> I don't.
- Caleb's going to be pissed.<eos> - Don't say anything.<eos> If she doesn't want me in the wedding, she's gonna have to be straight up with it.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> I-I don't.
Or Sergeant Derkin.<eos> That guy's got a lot of guilt, more than he can carry.<eos> I think I can turn him.<eos> On the upside, we got a roster of old white dudes to show Cory.<eos> Hell of a lot more than we did yesterday.
"Acting in the role of parent."<eos> That's right.<eos> And that's me.<eos> You see, Violet can get married if she has the permission of her legal guardian.<eos> And she does.
Klaus, you can't speak to an adult that way.<eos> And he's lying now.<eos> He's a liar and a murderer and he killed Uncle Monty.<eos> You have no proof.<eos> Yes, we do.
She leaked it to Abe Leonard.<eos> Wow.<eos> Do you think this has anything to do with him suppressing the threat assessment memo?<eos> No.<eos> No, I don't.
Becky, we get Elvis on more stations, then the kids go lookin' for the records, then the stores call the distributors, then they call us and then we're rollin' in it.<eos> At least that's the plan, praise Jesus.<eos> Now... Now you're asking him for help.<eos> Darlin', I'm asking everybody.<eos> And who he doesn't, I do.
And we didn't come this far for you to quit.<eos> There's no place for me in your life.<eos> We started this together.<eos> I don't see a future.<eos> Of course you do.
The thought crossed my mind.<eos> That's a dark fuckin' thought.<eos> He's been after this scumbag for years.<eos> Knows he did it, knows in his bones.<eos> The way we do.
All right, I went and I tried the door.<eos> All right?<eos> Then I got out of there.<eos> You saw the body?<eos> Yeah, I did.
How long can his beard grow this time?<eos> A lot of questions come to mind.<eos> But I wonder, for the life of me, do they ever enter yours?<eos> Truth be told, I don't think you ever think about what happens after your brilliant plans.<eos> So I did the thinking this time, for you.
We'll, uh, give you some leeway, Ms. wexler, but don't stray too far. Charles mcgill is not the subject of this hearing.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Did Jimmy know his brother was the one that prevented you from hiring him?<eos> Hamlin:<eos> No. He did not.
And I don't know if... he slipped and fell or had a heart attack or met someone who didn't like the way he looked...<eos> I don't know.<eos> And even after all these years, not knowing how he passed or where he is...<eos> I wish it didn't matter.<eos> But it does.
So with two women stars of our era to suddenly have the most successful picture in the theaters among young people, well, we thought it signaled a sea change.<eos> We had thought we'd all start working again.<eos> That there'd be a flood of women's pictures.<eos> It didn't turn out that way.<eos> Sure as hell didn't.
It's my picture, Jack.<eos> And now, Zanuck's.<eos> You can't work for Zanuck.<eos> We have an agreement.<eos> No, no, we don't.
Giving Bray easy access to move captives.<eos> Fantastic.<eos> If this compound sits on a tunnel... and let's admit that's a... that's a mighty big "if"... how do you suggest we get in or even know where we are?<eos> It's not like we have a map.<eos> No, the Middlesex Museum of British History does.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Everybody, just calm down.<eos> We're on the same side, fellas.<eos> It's okay. You don't have to do this, sweetheart.<eos> He has my son!<eos> No, he doesn't.
Forgot to send flowers.<eos> Anyone can open the Yellow Pages and call a private detective.<eos> Only my husband would hire a spy.<eos> What do you want from me?<eos> Same thing Howard did.
Those two new each other.<eos> Knew each other how?<eos> It looks like they had an affair, because after it ended, she had a restraining order against him.<eos> This doesn't make sense.<eos> Love never does, my friend.
I just never thought that madman would be you.<eos> You're not in the boardroom anymore, honey.<eos> You can drop the act.<eos> Scottie, you don't have any leverage.<eos> Of course I do.
I want to know the second you get a hit.<eos> If we find her, what's gonna happen to her?<eos> Justice.<eos> I loved her once.<eos> In some ways, I still do.
- Or how many mercs there are.<eos> - Or the location of Cantara.<eos> Other than that, Ms. Lincoln, how was the play?<eos> You said you had a way to get us inside?<eos> Matter of fact, I do, sweetheart.
We follow it, we all gonna make it out of here.<eos> You feelin' all right?<eos> He fine.<eos> I think it's a boy.<eos> Noah, I really don't...
So if you could just put it back.<eos> Emily... What do you think HR does?<eos> Oh, well, you know, it's... HR does the... It's human resources and...<eos> You have no idea.<eos> And neither does anyone else.
_<eos> Why me?<eos> I prayed for a solution, and he... Gave me you.<eos> I honestly believed you left that life behind a long time ago.<eos> I honestly did.
That's slightly suspicious, no?<eos> Are you living mannequins suggesting I had something to do with my brother's death?<eos> We're just curious. What do the police think happened?<eos> I'll tell you what I told them, which is that Jason did fall into the water.<eos> We both did.
So when an anonymous buyer made Mayor McCoy an offer, she couldn't refuse...<eos> Anonymous buyer?<eos> What do they have to hide?<eos> No one cares.<eos> I do!
You dragged me out of the Blossom house, and then you don't talk to me the whole way home.<eos> Dad, Jason and Polly were engaged.<eos> Did you know that?<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Of course you did.
What we're attempting is a stealth operation, Archie.<eos> If we go in there with the entire Scooby Gang, forget it, we're compromised.<eos> Well, don't you have to practice for the Variety Show anyways?<eos> Uh, no, I don't.<eos> Except that yes, you do.
Just that I had a few words with our director/host, and reminded him that he's heard you sing on numerous occasions.<eos> Even though it compromises my artistic integrity.<eos> Cutting to the chase, you have a slot if you want it.<eos> Veronica, thank you, but you saw what happened.<eos> We all did.
Oh, of course not, honey.<eos> She's welcome back.<eos> Where will the baby sleep?<eos> Sweetie, um, we've talked to your sister about this, and she's agreed to put the baby up for adoption.<eos> Polly did?
It was great, until FP told us you forced him out of the company he helped found.<eos> That's his story, wanna hear mine, hmm?<eos> FP was a mess. He was stealing from the company and selling stuff on the side. All things considered, I was pretty generous.<eos> So generous you didn't give him a second chance?<eos> Of course I did.
I don't really know what to think anymore.<eos> I'm not a perfect father, Jughead, no getting around that, but...<eos> I'm no killer.<eos> - Do you believe him?<eos> - I do.
You need to tell Fred about the land before someone else does.<eos> Archie.<eos> If music be the food of love, play on, play on.<eos> Did you know this week's the official start of maple syrup season?<eos> I... No, I didn't.
Oh, I got us some coffee and donuts.<eos> And I read your, uh...<eos> Your essay?<eos> Manuscript?<eos> - You did?
That's great, Jughead. But maybe you should wait a little bit longer just to make sure it sticks.<eos> No, dude, I'm telling you, something has shifted.<eos> I mean, he even asked to read my work.<eos> The essays, the articles I wrote about Jason.<eos> - Your dad did?
Do not push me tonight, Mom, because I will push back.<eos> If FP confesses, he might drag us into this.<eos> Talk about our dealings with the Serpents.<eos> But at least we'll know if Dad hired him to...<eos> And if he did?
Coming up to me with your concern.<eos> You don't get to do that anymore.<eos> - Come on.<eos> - You didn't choose me.<eos> Nobody does.
You know, that's why they been leavin' us alone all these many years.<eos> But may I ask, are you forgiving him?<eos> Or are you thinkin' something more dire will be his fate?<eos> He did kill our Bren'in, like him or not.<eos> Yes. He did.
Oh, you mean that kid that lived down the block?<eos> Well, so it is.<eos> Well, give him a doughnut and thank him for his service. No.<eos> I don't like Kevin Wilson.<eos> None of us do.
I'll go get it from the back.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Man, you are a life-saver.<eos> I can imagine you go through a lot of these.<eos> Yes, yes, we... we do, actually.
I love you too, babe.<eos> Kennedy?<eos> Are you there? Did you find the speakers?<eos> Uh, yeah.<eos> Yeah, I did.
Well, one of the gazillion things I missed was hanging out with girls.<eos> There, I said it.<eos> So, I take it you don't have a girlfriend?<eos> No.<eos> Well, I did.
I would have slept till I was dead.<eos> What are you two going on about?<eos> Her man's got another girl.<eos> Everyone knew.<eos> Now she does too.
Oh, and...<eos> There is a baby that has been squawling for an hour.<eos> Please do something to make it stop.<eos> I don't hear a baby, sir.<eos> You don't?
No book of mine will ever be.<eos> And all the writing I've done, and will do, is in spite of you.<eos> You teach with two goals:<eos> To prop up literature that is long dead, and to curry favor with the wealthiest students just so that you can indulge in the fantasy that you belong to their world.<eos> You don't.
I ask you, what is the point?<eos> Let's not wear any clothes.<eos> We're at the beach.<eos> Who needs them?<eos> We certainly don't.
Excuse me?<eos> Your poetic soul.<eos> I saw it the moment we met.<eos> Not something all men have.<eos> When one does, one does.
I haven't thrown a dart since I was a young man.<eos> It's like riding a bicycle.<eos> So, did Zelda mention the family supper?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, she did.
Yes, you'll have our decision within two to three weeks.<eos> Okay.<eos> Well, you two take care.<eos> Bye.<eos> - You did great!
A bit.<eos> She seems good.<eos> You know.<eos> Yeah.<eos> You doing okay?
That's enough.<eos> - You good?<eos> - Good.<eos> Did they find her?<eos> Yeah, they did.
I shouldn't have let her eat the whole cake!<eos> Can you hang on just one second?<eos> - Oh, sure.<eos> - Ravenous!<eos> What if instead of doing it on the show, we did it on Snapchat?
It's Chuck, about his snack.<eos> What?<eos> You told me he got his snack at 3:00.<eos> I'm so mad I could spit bullets!<eos> I... did I?
And how are you gonna get to the other side of the park, missy?<eos> 'Cause I'm sure as heck not driving you!<eos> I'm riding a bike!<eos> You don't know how!<eos> Yes, I do.
I'm afraid I need you to man the phone.<eos> Sister Julienne?<eos> Lucy.<eos> The doctor say that if she wakes soon she has a very good chance of getting better.<eos> But if she doesn't?
Now, I just need to take a minute and make some calls. I will get this figured out.<eos> And to answer your question... no, I didn't do it.<eos> I didn't ask you that.<eos> Yes.<eos> You did.
Marty Byrde.<eos> Nice home on a quarter-acre squared-off lot in the suburbs?<eos> Marty fucking Byrde. Putting presents underneath the tree since 2002.<eos> Not only would I not cheat on you but I... I'd let you do anything... you... wanted.<eos> Do me a favor.
You're not guilty of your father's crimes. And I'm not beholden to my ancestor's vows.<eos> Then why are you here?<eos> Because I need your help, and you need mine.<eos> Did you see three dragons flying overhead when you arrived?<eos> I did.
- I'm at war.<eos> I'm losing.<eos> What do you think I should do?<eos> I never thought that dragons would exist again.<eos> No one did.
And how are you gonna get to the other side of the park, missy?<eos> 'Cause I'm sure as heck not driving you!<eos> I'm riding a bike!<eos> You don't know how!<eos> Yes, I do.
She knows.<eos> She knows.<eos> My mom knows about us.<eos> How?<eos> No, I didn't.
She knows.<eos> My mom knows about us.<eos> How?<eos> No, I didn't.<eos> But now I do.
- Mmm, good!<eos> It talks.<eos> Hey, how are ya?<eos> I'm Chuck, and I... love you.<eos> Just do that one, right there.
Yeah, see?<eos> You say stuff like that.<eos> Greg, can you even have sex?<eos> You told me yourself - you don't have genitals.<eos> - No, I did not.
I'm sick of being alone on Saint Wiggin's Day, eating store-bought crumb fairy, but what choice do I have?<eos> Oh, all right.<eos> Suppose I was responsible for this hack, what then?<eos> Do you two own a cable news network on which to expose me?<eos> Because I do.
You're welcome, pumpkin.<eos> And thanks for finally seeing me as a gwown-up.<eos> I'm glad having your mom at the office hasn't ruined your life.<eos> I need a mom sometimes.<eos> We all do.
Audrey, I looked.<eos> Okay?<eos> What I don't understand is why you lied to me, made me think you changed the combination because I'm addle-brained.<eos> I never said that.<eos> You did.
We'll blame it on Keith Bosko.<eos> You'll be dead.<eos> Keith Bosko gave him the belt.<eos> I saw it with my own eyes.<eos> Do me this kindness.
You sent that nutjob after Holden?<eos> It wasn't my decision.<eos> But Frost is the boss.<eos> From the jump, I said we needed to bring that kid in, by any means necessary.<eos> You did.
Luke Wheeler is not gonna sell me Wheelin' Dealin'.<eos> You realize that we were supposed to get married.<eos> I left him at the altar.<eos> Right. You think I don't know that?<eos> Of course you do.
I mean, we're good now, but... I'm not sitting in judgment of anybody.<eos> I just hope...<eos> What?<eos> I just hope you know you deserve to be happy.<eos> Everybody does.
- Why would I do that?<eos> - Because I scare you.<eos> Well, that's a reason not to let you go.<eos> Okay, that makes no sense.<eos> Yes, it does.
And I got so mad I just decided I'm walking away.<eos> I'm done.<eos> I'm out of here.<eos> But as I walked away, I remember thinking to myself, but if he comes after me right now and he gets me, then I'll be with him forever.<eos> And he did?
- Oh, hey.<eos> - Hey.<eos> I'll take that for you.<eos> I never know what to say at these moments.<eos> Oh, nobody does.
I can't believe all this is happening.<eos> I was really just trying to stand up for him.<eos> I know that.<eos> He knows it too.<eos> No one else does.
He knows it too.<eos> No one else does.<eos> They all think I'm this spoiled brat. - Oh, come on... - I know.<eos> And they think I'm the worst. And so does Clay.<eos> No, he does not.
I didn't even think.<eos> And now everyone's making me into all types of things.<eos> And even you think it was my fault.<eos> I never said that.<eos> I didn't, baby.
Stay away?<eos> So are these people dangerous?<eos> Where is Holden?<eos> I told you, I don't know.<eos> - Then who does?
- Of course.<eos> Anyone would be an improvement after your first husband.<eos> So how is Noah?<eos> Do they know who stabbed him?<eos> No, they don't.
You can't go anywhere, not like that.<eos> Vik said he would take a look at you before work.<eos> That's not necessary, thanks.<eos> I'm happy to leave if you want me to.<eos> He doesn't.
Vik said he would take a look at you before work.<eos> That's not necessary, thanks.<eos> I'm happy to leave if you want me to.<eos> He doesn't.<eos> You don't.
- We're okay.<eos> - Don't know me.<eos> Wait.<eos> I like fucking you.<eos> You don't fucking...
Some people have it, Red.<eos> A brilliancy, charisma, breeding.<eos> Of course, the strong jaw and glorious hairline don't exactly hurt, either.<eos> Fitz had it.<eos> Frankie does, too.
You are being played.<eos> The warrant was served by the attorney general himself, who accompanied Vice President-Elect Beene to Maryland Hamilton Federal Penitentiary.<eos> Tell me you're not seriously considering making this a death-penalty case against Cyrus.<eos> The chief of staff doesn't make these decisions.<eos> The president does.
My God. It is him.<eos> We saw you sitting over here and wanted to say hi.<eos> We watch your show every day.<eos> I thought I made myself clear.<eos> - You did.
Neither do I.<eos> But you know what, enough about me, right?<eos> Let's talk about you.<eos> You like music?<eos> 'Cause I don't.
I risked her life.<eos> She's gonna be fine, Maggie.<eos> How do you always keep the emotion out of the OR?<eos> I wish I was a doctor robot.<eos> No, you don't.
That's a very nice pantsuit.<eos> Nordstrom Rack.<eos> You like Nordstrom Rack?<eos> I think I probably do.<eos> You do.
I'm sorry, love.<eos> Sometimes I...<eos> I just don't think.<eos> That's right, Gloria.<eos> You don't.
Just enough.<eos> And all I can think about is Emma.<eos> What happens if one day someone comes with news that I just didn't make it?<eos> She knows the risks.<eos> She doesn't. She doesn't. Not really.
I could have Hildy Simmons on that stage by noon tomorrow.<eos> Hildy Simmons?<eos> Hildy Simmons has a voice like a strangled...<eos> I take it, you saw the paper this morning?<eos> Yeah, I did.
Tell me, Ms. Benitez, why shouldn't I admit testimony from Detective Bosch's civil trial?<eos> It's irrelevant.<eos> Defense's intent here is obvious and exclusively prejudicial.<eos> It establishes a disturbing and career-long pattern of rogue behavior by Detective Bosch.<eos> It does nothing of the kind.
Jasper. How are you?<eos> My Lady Margaret.<eos> Who would have thought to find us here like this with Henry on the throne.<eos> I did.<eos> I always did.
Then, finally, I say, "I want to leave."<eos> And the leader... We called him Father.<eos> Father says to me, "You can't leave,<eos> "because even if you do, I'll come to you in your dreams."<eos> And he did.
- Say bye-bye.<eos> - It doesn't have to say goodbye.<eos> Remember that we have the fundraiser<eos> - for the library tonight.<eos> - I do, yes.
Angry.<eos> It was not a great visit.<eos> Well, why should this time be any different?<eos> Because I told her I was gay.<eos> Oh, my God, you did?

[indistinct radio chatter] [tires screech] Badge, please.<eos> Go ahead.<eos> [indistinct radio chatter]<eos> Did you know that LA's Deputy Proxy was coming for a visit?<eos> No, I did not.
I told you what was gonna happen, and then it happened.<eos> They killed everyone.<eos> Yeah.<eos> You work for them.<eos> So does your father.
I'm bad to the bone!<eos> Who the hell are you?<eos> I'm your guilt.<eos> I don't have any guilt.<eos> You do now.
'Spect so.<eos> She didn't say.<eos> I thought I would die today.<eos> I too.<eos> But when I did not,
I gotta go, Sammy, okay?<eos> It's okay.<eos> Okay?<eos> Hey, Butch, what's up?<eos> How you doing, Butch?
Okay?<eos> Hey, Butch, what's up?<eos> How you doing, Butch?<eos> What up?<eos> How you doing, man?
Mom, come out and talk to me, please.<eos> I'm supposed to look after you, not the other way around.<eos> I still need you.<eos> You never needed me.<eos> Well, I do now.
Are you saying she doesn't deserve that?<eos> Is there a reason why you're holding on to them?<eos> Why you haven't spread them?<eos> I kept them because nobody else wanted them.<eos> Now someone does.
And then tomorrow... I'm gonna start all over again.<eos> Hey.<eos> Ray's downstairs waiting for you.<eos> I didn't call him.<eos> I did.
There is nothing I would rather do than get dinner with you, but I can't tonight.<eos> I wish you would have called.<eos> I would have, but, uh...<eos> You didn't have my phone number.<eos> No, I didn't.
- And he's going to.<eos> But if you're gonna get this worked up about something like this, it makes me think i don't really know you.<eos> Louis, can you honestly tell me that you really know me?<eos> - Are we ready to take a picture?<eos> - no, I don't.
I don't make a habit of talking to ladies in bars.<eos> I got to tell you, you're about the hottest thing I've seen since fire.<eos> Well, thank you, Lewis.<eos> So you like America, huh?<eos> Who doesn't?
Where are you gonna go?<eos> Someplace I can keep Gracie safe.<eos> One sec.<eos> Hey, sweetie.<eos> How you doing?
The drive to reproduce is manic, it can become a vortex.<eos> I had one patient who was desperate to risk her life just to carry a baby.<eos> Did she succeed?<eos> Three.<eos> Yeah, she did.
Actually, this is my last week here.<eos> I'm not a gambler.<eos> Do you know any couple desperate enough to try illegal...?<eos> Surrogacy?<eos> Yeah. Yeah, of course I do.
- Eliot, there are certain student/teacher boundaries which I'd prefer not to cross.<eos> - So what am I supposed to do, Henry?<eos> - What did you think was going to happen when you dove headfirst into another world?<eos> - I thought I'd die.<eos> - But you didn't.
Yeah.<eos> I don't know, man, why don't you just call it Sophia's Joint.<eos> Change it when you think of something better.<eos> We all know what happened to Skeleton Key when they re-launched Miss Theo Goes Vintage.<eos> We do?
It'll sell.<eos> Kaavi's website is perfect.<eos> You believe me when I say it's gonna be okay. Right?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I do.
- That is not--<eos> Louis, if this woman needs to know she's special to us, there's more than one way to do it and Harvey's not the only one you can bring.<eos> Donna, that's great.<eos> But this meeting is tomorrow and I don't even know these new associates yet.<eos> Yes, you do.
Hey, I'm really young.<eos> And really ambitious.<eos> I'm not saying otherwise, captain, but I can wait.<eos> And I like my life the way it is, you know?<eos> Yeah, I do.
The court said so!<eos> And it's gonna be your last fuckin' weekend.<eos> Don't try doing anything, Joey!<eos> I'm warning you!<eos> Don't!
Better than almost anyone else I know.<eos> Not anymore.<eos> People change.<eos> What?<eos> No, they don't.
'Til the end of the world, right?<eos> Hey, asshole.<eos> Hey, hey, hey. I'm talking to you.<eos> Let's go. I don't have all day.<eos> No. You don't.
- You seem a little manic, honey.<eos> - Well, I feel really manic.<eos> It's exciting, there could be a cure. You could be eating pizza in a week.<eos> - Don't you want to be cured?<eos> - Of course I do.
So now what?<eos> I have a meeting with the DA in five minutes.<eos> He'll tell me what happens next.<eos> You know, I love this job.<eos> Oh, I really do, but sometimes...
Now it looks like Tillman kept cashing the disability checks.<eos> The last one was cashed at a BofA on 40th Street ten minutes ago.<eos> It's right near Gleason's house.<eos> All right, does Gleason have a car registered in his name?<eos> Yes, he does. 2005 red Silverado.
You make your decision?<eos> Give me that key.<eos> Back up, everybody back up on the wall. Back up on the wall.<eos> Okay, someone needs to tell us what's going on.<eos> No, we don't.
- Thank you.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - Hey.<eos> You ever find anyone to claim Sam?<eos> No, I didn't.
"...with the introductions effected by the two retinues, "at which point, the Princess and the Prince..."<eos> That should be the other way round, surely?<eos> ".. Will strip to the waist and wrestle in the filth "and detritus of the forest floor."<eos> It doesn't say that. Um...<eos> No, it doesn't!
Shall I add them to your shopping list?<eos> Eh, sure.<eos> Well, let's hope that Melcher doesn't hear about all this.<eos> You guys don't need all these lights on, do you?<eos> Yes, we do.
I love Julia more than anything, but there are... intimacies that I can't provide.<eos> Our bond is built on hope.<eos> It's what holds us together.<eos> So it doesn't matter if you believe the treatments won't work.<eos> Julia does.
There can't be a bigger emergency than this.<eos> My son is dying.<eos> Are you just gonna stand there and do nothing?<eos> Mrs. Banks, Dustin still has options, other ways of continuing to warm.<eos> Mr. Kessler does not.
Science and technology are my responsibility... it's not your fault.<eos> I knew the risks that came with using powerful autonomous machinery.<eos> I knew the dangers and... and you thought I was one of them.<eos> You didn't want that technology to fall under the control of a director you didn't know.<eos> No, I did not.
Probably best that she's not here for this.<eos> Guess now we know what your power is.<eos> - He's here.<eos> - We don't know that.<eos> Okay, now we do.
That was horrifying.<eos> I don't know how you live with it all the time.<eos> I'm just grateful Ghost Rider kept its part of the deal and went back to you.<eos> You know why he made the deal in the first place, right?<eos> - I do.
Hey, Amber, what do you mean by that?<eos> Aunt Megan, she had a monster inside of her.<eos> We took care of that, didn't we?<eos> You saw it leave.<eos> We both did.
This is a trifling matter, madam.<eos> Take your scandal sheet and go.<eos> Forgive me.<eos> I do not have the superior force of male reason willing my actions.<eos> As you and your powerful friends do.
Don't pick a fight with Willie.<eos> I'm not.<eos> Who doesn't love Willie?<eos> No one.<eos> I do.
I trust her. And she trusts me.<eos> You've tricked her into trusting you.<eos> How?<eos> I don't know.<eos> But she does.
But you don't know that, Moira, okay?<eos> You don't know that.<eos> It could happen.<eos> Okay, all right, um...<eos> If it does...
And maybe that's because I'm only thinking about myself.<eos> Like with this doctor, she's in town to save my mom's life and all I can think about is she's taken my bedroom.<eos> - So, did you want something?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Yeah, I do, Ramona.
I also know that at the end of each of those meetings, you say to them, "I never do this, but would you like to have dinner?"<eos> And then dinner leads to dessert, dessert leads to sex, and sex leads to them falling for you, and that leads to...<eos> - all right, I've heard enough.<eos> And you don't have proof of anything.<eos> - Actually, I do.
It's tomorrow at 9:00.<eos> I don't have anyone else.<eos> Mike, hey.<eos> Harvey, tell me you got some good news.<eos> I do.
Here, try and get some rest.<eos> Hey do you want blueberries?<eos> No, chocolate chips.<eos> - For breakfast?<eos> - Daddy does it.
Sorry.<eos> What are you going to do with him?<eos> Give them the money we brought over and give him back. Tell them to get lost.<eos> You got money over?<eos> We did.
Here, Suzanne.<eos> I got you this jacket with a dragon on it.<eos> It's reversible.<eos> Thought you'd like it.<eos> Oh, I do!
I'm going there now.<eos> Don't tell anyone.<eos> Tonight is the grand opening for the town's hottest new destination, run by the man most in demand for Springfield's haunted houses, Moe Szyslak.<eos> Oh, sorry, force of habit.<eos> - How you doing?
We just have some questions about your husband...<eos> What was his fake name?<eos> Joe Crocker.<eos> Do you have any identification?<eos> Yes, we do.
Uh, do you know how to repo a BMW?<eos> No, but I am very proud of myself, because this is my first big purchase without Victor.<eos> Yeah, girl!<eos> You don't need no man!<eos> Actually, I do.
Hi.<eos> Hello, Tiffany.<eos> We won.<eos> I wasn't sure if you heard.<eos> I did.
You love him, the liar who's not a liar?<eos> I don't know, um...<eos> I think so.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, I do.
They'll be safe at the Vanishing Point.<eos> Really?<eos> You said the Time Masters couldn't be trusted.<eos> Did I?<eos> Bollocks, so I did.
Finally, darling, we're alone.<eos> What is it going to take to get you off this planet?<eos> It's like I said.<eos> It's going to take two little words<eos> "I do."
Hey.<eos> Hey, hey!<eos> I'm so sorry. Sorry I'm late.<eos> - Better have a good reason.<eos> - I do.
Uh, big time. Yeah.<eos> Okay, well, think fast.<eos> Do you think it's the right thing to do?<eos> - Go.<eos> - Yes. I do.
You benefited from its cruelty.<eos> What about that Kryptonian emissary?<eos> Your guard...<eos> Do you even feel guilty?<eos> Of course I do.
When the market closes tomorrow and we have ridden this thing all the way up, that $125-million number might be... conservative.<eos> Yes.<eos> Don't quit your day job.<eos> Too late.<eos> You didn't.
You never tally your sheet until the lockup period is over, but even I have to admit it does feel great.<eos> You did a good thing here, son.<eos> You absolutely did.<eos> I hope that's true, Dad.<eos> I really do.
I am.<eos> He's thriving.<eos> You read my article.<eos> I did.<eos> I did.
So, uh, a gay bar, huh?<eos> Immersion therapy.<eos> You gotta get used to being around gay people, now that I know you hate us.<eos> I don't hate gay people!<eos> No, I don't.
Hey, you hanging in there?<eos> I can't believe this.<eos> They're all so happy.<eos> It's like they don't even know that they're trapped here.<eos> Well, of course they don't.
They like you!<eos> Unh-unh.<eos> Nobody knows me.<eos> And nobody knows I can bake.<eos> Well, I do, and he does.
Oh, very wise of you.<eos> The old boy wants the results off to the printers, so come on, help me decide the winners.<eos> I've learned it's always the best when these things are worked out over the fire.<eos> Who did well, would you say?<eos> Clutterbuck did well.
And in this instance, at this time, the plan began to unravel.<eos> Mr. John Lakeman, you're requested on floor two, interview room 216.<eos> Mr. John Lakeman.<eos> Where's the bag?<eos> Doing great, kid.
What's wrong?<eos> Well, far be it from me to jump to conclusions, but the last time anyone saw my brother, he was on his way here to talk to you.<eos> And you think I have him?<eos> Seriously?<eos> No, I don't.
Tell me where Marcel is.<eos> Detained, until we can be sure that he's free of this thing's vile influence.<eos> You Mikaelsons, you always find a way to get right back on top, don't you?<eos> And I bet you got a plan all figured out.<eos> As a matter of fact, I do.
A curse upon all present that night.<eos> She bound them to the full moon, so that once a month they would turn into the very beasts they used to hunt her.<eos> The Hollow created the werewolf curse.<eos> You bear the mark of the Crescent.<eos> So did she.
I mean, right on the number.<eos> And, at $10,000.<eos> And we went to the Marriott, right?<eos> And we were just gonna, you know, get a few drinks in the bar and then go home.<eos> But we didn't.
Then you ain't gettin' King.<eos> And... we're taking our stock public.<eos> Who wants to buy Judy King?<eos> - Selling to the highest bidder.<eos> - I do.
No, really.<eos> No, I am. I actually just landed a major new client.<eos> I designed the poster for a pretty big music festival.<eos> They, uh, pay you for that?<eos> Of course they did.
This food wouldn't be here if it wasn't for...<eos> It's not about the fighting.<eos> I like the fighting.<eos> But you...<eos> I didn't at first.
You learn some respect.<eos> Don't be scared. He's fine.<eos> .. always meet outside of Polesford... .. the night Abi was taken...<eos> You don't believe her, do you?<eos> No. I don't. Why?
Why?<eos> Well, actually, because I felt like it.<eos> - What if I steal it from you?<eos> - On you go, then. I don't know how it works.<eos> Well, neither did I.
This is a great day out.<eos> I mean, come on, admit it.<eos> You love it.<eos> Did I say I didn't love it?<eos> Yes, I do.
- Yes.<eos> Yes, we need to use code, otherwise anyone could walk in here and get you blabbing like a fool.<eos> That's a good point, sir.<eos> Now, these men, what do they know of this material?<eos> No more than I do, sir.
"Urchin boy deemed legitimate"! My God!<eos> It worked!<eos> You did it.<eos> You saved them.<eos> You did.
That's your house?<eos> Sharing, yeah.<eos> Six of us.<eos> - How do you get into the Tower?<eos> - You don't.
Yeah, I guess it was sweet in the sense that it forced us all to celebrate two people who got what they wanted at someone else's expense.<eos> Well, maybe Rich married the wrong person the first time around.<eos> It happens.<eos> I'm Jon's second wife, remember?<eos> I do, yeah.
Show him your thing.<eos> Uh, Eddie Zeidel. Is that correct?<eos> That's close enough, Monty!<eos> Well, Ron and Eddie from Boston and formerly from Tennessee, do either of you have a hard-boiled egg? We do!<eos> We do, Monty.
Why?<eos> Well, scientists think that light travels through its own special, invisible medium.<eos> They call it the ether.<eos> Yeah, but if it's invisible, then how do we know it's there?<eos> We don't.
Open your ears!<eos> Julius.<eos> It's growing colder, isn't it?<eos> I don't mind.<eos> You never did.
Delilah's trans.<eos> If I represent her, that's one too many trans people at the table.<eos> If it comes to trial, the jury may not trust you.<eos> Like maybe you've got an axe to grind.<eos> I do.
You must at least pretend to believe in God if you want them to hire you.<eos> Perhaps I'm being foolish.<eos> Why would I leave democratic Switzerland to work for a medieval, warmongering monarchy?<eos> Since when do you care about - the stupidities of politics?<eos> - I don't.
And Jamie was murdered between five to seven and ten past.<eos> I'm sure there were a lot of guests at the party who don't show up in random photos taken between those times.<eos> Did you see your son while you were up there?<eos> He was running nearby.<eos> No, I didn't.
"Banville defends another paedophile."<eos> Emma, you never read the papers, never watch TV.<eos> Why would you care?<eos> Because...<eos> .. because at the moment I do.
One day, Samuel, you're going to be governor here, master of all Virginia.<eos> I know it and I love you.<eos> Not many people could see the kindness in my brother.<eos> He wouldn't let them.<eos> I did.
Piece of shit.<eos> What you lookin' over there for, man?<eos> The cameras don't work, son.<eos> They ain't worked in over a year.<eos> Too bad, though, if they did.
How he knows me too?<eos> I mean, you tell me to lay low, and now you want me to be an errand boy to bribe some mobster?<eos> How do we know that he ain't working for the Feds?<eos> That this ain't some setup for me to get caught - with my dick in a ringer?<eos> - We don't.
Is that a promise?<eos> Promise?<eos> Santa Claus makes promises. That's why he's always smiling.<eos> People who make guarantees never smile because they know how much hard fuckin' work it's gonna take.<eos> I don't even... I don't...
It was crazy times.<eos> I ate, worked, and slept there.<eos> Changed a lot of Mandy's diapers there too.<eos> Sid left when she was five, and we bumped along another five years, and then I rolled the dice on comedy.<eos> After a while, things did what they did.
Several. And?<eos> And...<eos> Did any of them have brains in their digestive systems?<eos> No.<eos> No, they didn't.
I hate everyone.<eos> Anyone... laughing or smiling or... being alive is fucking offensive to me and they should all just fucking die.<eos> And eventually, I'm just gonna burn up from rage and then I'll just be dust.<eos> And I don't know how to make it stop.<eos> I do.
You think I don't hear those trick words, "Do our best," Miss, uh--<eos> -Reddy.<eos> -Well, my best friend is gone, Miss Reddy.<eos> So, "Do our best" ain't good enough no more.<eos> "Do our best."
Oh, man.<eos> I can't even kill myself right.<eos> Honey, your dad and me... we think you need some real help.<eos> You think so?<eos> Yeah! I do. Of course I fucking do!
Yeah, well, change is very important, actually.<eos> When my mom would, uh, catch my dad cheating, she would just... get a new hairdo, wax the bush, try some new eye shadow.<eos> Whatever. - Yeah. And that worked for her?<eos> - Well, no.<eos> But fucking his brother did.
Raven's looking for us.<eos> So Luna's rig is here, and if the fish in these waters are dying, well, basically, we're screwed.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> A.L.I.E. said we had 6 months.<eos> We don't.
That's the application fee.<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> Lisa, do you see them?<eos> The rings of Saturn.<eos> I do.
We just leave him here like this?<eos> Price of peace.<eos> Not a price I agreed to pay.<eos> - We need to clear out.<eos> - Do we?
Ma'am, we gotta walk.<eos> Fill in the blanks, Harlee.<eos> Woz wouldn't get tangled up with the Feds on his own accord.<eos> So how did it happen?<eos> It just did.
Adrian told one of his friends he had to go to the Y.<eos> Gave him his homework to hand in.<eos> Caddie!<eos> Caddie, you in there?<eos> Tess, how we doing?
We all have lots of questions about his death, and I was wondering if you maybe had any information.<eos> How'd they treat you down there?<eos> Oh, you know...<eos> You speak to Sheriff Nix?<eos> - My lawyer did.
Where you going?<eos> He asked me if I loved his dad.<eos> Oh, yeah?<eos> What did you say?<eos> That I didn't.
- Yeah, right there.<eos> It's rigged.<eos> Did you do this?<eos> You knew that they were coming after you.<eos> 'Cause somebody fucking did this on purpose, Marty.
- Petirroja. Petirroja, your breasts, "jhey" are... "jhey" are not so petit, but "jhey" are red.<eos> What?<eos> You don't like my cheating accent, mang?<eos> My cheaty, cheaty accent?<eos> Yeah, actually, I kind of do.
They only ask questions post-mortem.<eos> But our ace is you.<eos> Once we nab prints and drop the wards, you travel straight in.<eos> You really don't think a bank vault, of all places, has anti-traveler protection?<eos> Oh, they do.
She didn't care what happened.<eos> Did you receive the letter?<eos> Of course you did.<eos> How else would you have our address?<eos> Yes, I did.
- Am I supposed to lie on the stand?<eos> - No.<eos> I could go to jail.<eos> - They're not gonna call you.<eos> - What if they do?
For you... it was simple.<eos> Well... whatever it was, Roy... it wasn't simple.<eos> Three of us went out on that boat.<eos> - No, no, no.<eos> I don't...
We want the same thing.<eos> No, I don't think we want the same thing at all.<eos> Keep your pants on.<eos> You had one inside of you?<eos> We all did.
Why would you give up Sidney like this?<eos> I thought you all wanted the same things.<eos> You think I wanted that to happen to Patricia?<eos> I swore an oath to serve the people of this town.<eos> Owen Boyd did.
- We're married!<eos> - We're married!<eos> ♪ Even though I know When you're coming back, baby ♪<eos> I'm gonna get it, though.<eos> Hey, baby. How you doing, man?
I don't know.<eos> Something quiet.<eos> I wonder what happened to Grimes?<eos> - Do you think he's dead?<eos> - No, I don't.
Boss... I received a concerning bit of news.<eos> Mick Danzig just quit.<eos> Is that so?<eos> I just never thought I'd have an issue dating someone in the office.<eos> And I really didn't.
Because you were disabled.<eos> DÃ©shabillÃ© means undressed, you moron!<eos> Let's not get bogged down with "Ooh, can't speak French."<eos> Let's get to the point which is, James May, you lost and you broke the company yacht.<eos> - You did.
Just Field of Sheep to go.<eos> And he's right on the edge of the grip and across the line!<eos> It did look good. It did look good.<eos> - It did look good.<eos> - How did it do?
Skipping out on you?<eos> Real dick move and I'm sorry for it..<eos> Very, very sorry.<eos> - I don't care anymore.<eos> But I did.
L'un des flux antimatière transducteur a été compromis par une déficience dans I'un des accélérateurs de particules.<eos> What did you say?<eos> L'un des flux antimatière transducteur a été compromis par une déficience dans I'un des accélérateurs de particules.<eos> He said one of the antimatter transducer feeds has been compromised by an impairment in one of the particle accelerators.<eos> I did.
And what happens after that?<eos> You're still flesh and blood. You can't last forever without oxygen.<eos> I don't need forever.<eos> You don't get to make this call!<eos> Yeah, actually, I do.
You said, "shuttle us in."<eos> Five's gonna have to come with.<eos> I can get into the storage unit, but I'm going to need someone to hack in so I can access the safety deposit box, and from what I understand, she does that sort of thing?<eos> Thought you said tabor sent you there all the time.<eos> - ... He did.
Yes.<eos> Let me finally be a mother to you now.<eos> Let me help you die.<eos> I don't want to die.<eos> I don't.
_<eos> What the hell is he doing?<eos> Weaponizing the fuel.<eos> You said we need every drop.<eos> We do!
Alice?<eos> What?<eos> Would you help me scribe, please?<eos> I need your help.<eos> We all do.
A woman playing a woman?<eos> Are you insane?<eos> I know the lines.<eos> But we still don't have an ending!<eos> Oh, yes, we do.
Father, I beg you, save my Owen.<eos> I saw poor Neemes. Yes.<eos> But he is with the Lord now.<eos> Why does God not know that Owen loves him?<eos> He does, Marcus.
- Can that happen here?<eos> - No.<eos> But if it did, what would you do?<eos> - It's not gonna happen here.<eos> - But if it did.
A new life.<eos> A chance to make amends.<eos> I broke Troy in that old world.<eos> In this one, he has a purpose.<eos> We all do.
What is it, then?<eos> We haven't had a proper kill in quite a while.<eos> I'm going to really enjoy this.<eos> Please tell me you have a plan.<eos> Yes, I do.
Wow, I wouldn't have guessed that.<eos> I would've figured you were one of those guys who are on a voyage of self-discovery.<eos> Oh. You know, backpacking through Asia, rolling cigars in Cuba.<eos> Or, as Jonah would say, "Coo-ba."<eos> - He does that? - Yeah.
- Traffic.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Oh, okay.<eos> So everybody knows about my counseling.<eos> Well, they do now!
The actress in the video, does she get paid per video, or is it more of a flat rate for the whole day kind of thing?<eos> My guess is flat rate.<eos> Can ignoring someone you're dating be considered harassment?<eos> - I don't think so.<eos> - Of course you don't.
What...<eos> Marcus, what do you know about this pallet?<eos> Are you asking 'cause I'm in charge of the warehouse now?<eos> 'Cause you heard I'm in charge of the warehouse now, right?<eos> I did. Yeah.
Wait.<eos> How?<eos> You fixed it!<eos> I did?<eos> Oh, my God, I did.
- Great, no problem.<eos> No... no problem.<eos> Do undocumented people have documents?<eos> No.<eos> No, we don't.
And you'll get the governor's mansion for your efforts.<eos> And Connerty's started.<eos> You got one of those Cheroots?<eos> - Fundadores.<eos> - Mm-hmm. Yes, I do.
People are telling me I can't miss your party.<eos> No, because those people think the only way to advance is by following the rules and social mores.<eos> They have no fucking idea why we do what we do.<eos> I don't think I'm any better than them.<eos> Of course you do.
Sorry, sir, only commissioned officers or sponsored guests.<eos> The barman knows me, I rescued his life last Thanksgiving. Hello, friend.<eos> Good Quaker fellow.<eos> You know this man, Mr. Townsend?<eos> Yes, Tommy, I do.
- We checked every room.<eos> - Nowhere is safe.<eos> Sorry.<eos> If it makes you feel any better, I almost died after that.<eos> It doesn't.
- Oh. Ooh, beat my wife with a frying pan, it's even hotter today.<eos> Y'all, I'm sorry that Judge couldn't be here to say goodbye.<eos> He went off this morning on a business trip with Stewart to Key West.<eos> Ooh, I bet he went off to one of his special holes.<eos> Hey, you two girls, how you doing?
She's real in touch.<eos> This one's keeping Duracell in business.<eos> Max, I wish you had gotten something at the lingerie store.<eos> That saddle looked really good under you.<eos> Most things do. Did!
Melanie, do the moves.<eos> Those are my moves, kid.<eos> I mean, they're the moves that got me cast in the porn dance party in Body Double.<eos> Please, as if you worked with De Palma.<eos> I did. So...
It's rad, I swear.<eos> If this is being a zombie, then bring it on!<eos> This is torture and I'm not even enjoying it.<eos> Tell me again how we know the peeping Tom had a criminal record?<eos> We don't.
It won't be that hard to stop her.<eos> She may have gotten her teeth fixed, but she's still the same fragile mess with an under bite that I mentored years ago.<eos> - You used to like her.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Oddly, I still do.
$5,000 if you want to see the intel.<eos> - You've got to be joking.<eos> - That's bullshit, man.<eos> - Who's there?<eos> I don't do jokes.
All right, last chance, man.<eos> Anything you want to save?<eos> Sell it all.<eos> Who wants to buy some goodies?<eos> You do.
You always liked trains best, didn't you?<eos> Max.<eos> That looks like it hurts pretty bad.<eos> You should see the other guy.<eos> I did.
Well, with the FBI asking questions, maybe he's trying to tie up loose ends.<eos> I don't think so.<eos> Dushku and Heta were best friends since childhood.<eos> Came to Greece together.<eos> Heta even did some time for Dushku.
I'll take over from there.<eos> Okay, we'll ride this out together.<eos> So, we have a plan.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, we do.
Adapt.<eos> Like a chameleon.<eos> That's weird.<eos> I had a baby.<eos> Not the most ideal timing, but you did.
That depends, Princess.<eos> Do you speak for your brother?<eos> No, but I have his ear.<eos> It's true.<eos> She does.
You made a commitment to IHM, didn't you?<eos> Of course I made a commitment, I work here.<eos> But your friendship means more to me than a job.<eos> I hope you can trust me on that.<eos> I do.
Catalan is dead.<eos> Agent Wells is in custody.<eos> She'll be taken care of.<eos> We'll get through this.<eos> We always do.
How will you remember your mother now?<eos> How will you react to her when you are reunited?<eos> Yeah. Reunited.<eos> - You know where she is.<eos> - I do.
It must have been his plan all along.<eos> And he gave us the time of the attack so he could call it off if his son lived, or not if he died...<eos> it's a perfect revenge.<eos> Okay, okay, look, we just have to evacuate the building.<eos> No, we don't.
Well, experience in other offices would give me a shot at an executive position someday.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Anyway, you said you wanted me to take a desk job.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yes, I did.
- How? A sting operation masquerading as a weapons sale.<eos> None of that is happening today.<eos> Today is about establishing a contact and trust.<eos> Okay, um, so I don't need a gun or anything?<eos> No, you do not.
Megan, can we get you back on set, please? Yes.<eos> Absolutely.<eos> Right now.<eos> Hey, how's it going?<eos> Hey. How you doing?
- My God.<eos> No, but it was a horrible idea.<eos> It was a terrible, bad, stupid thing to do.<eos> And I'm really sorry that I hurt you, but it all came from love.<eos> No, I-I... I do not do that version of love anymore.
What was so important that it couldn't wait?<eos> I have a serious money situation that I need to deal with right away.<eos> - Okay, what do you mean?<eos> - Look, I-I... - I can't tell you the details.<eos> - Megan, if you don't...
Take five minutes.<eos> Oh, you read that one?<eos> Hey.<eos> I never said four weeks.<eos> - You did too.
- Yeah, to wag her finger at us.<eos> - It's not mean, there's nowhere for her to stay now that Donald's here.<eos> I did notice that. Five minutes after I move out and you've get a new son and I'm relegated to the guest couch.<eos> - I have the mumps now.<eos> - No, you don't.
Yes, me too, oddly, at the moment.<eos> Your husband? Every time I feel I'm moving on, he reappears like a ghost at the feast.<eos> I know you mistrust Mrs Haddock, but I'm no fool, and she seems to have a door into the lost world of the past.<eos> Do you have cabbage?<eos> Oh, yes, we do.
You're acting like a crazy person.<eos> - What's going on?<eos> - Okay, I found out. I found out that you were gonna go on tour with your ex-boyfriend.<eos> My ex-boyfriend?<eos> I don't...
It wasn't a come-on.<eos> Oh, it would be okay if it was.<eos> I could do worse, and, you know, honestly,<eos> I actually really get the whole girl thing.<eos> I do.
Like those personal pictures on that thumb drive?<eos> That folder was labeled "Do not open."<eos> If you didn't want me to open it, you wouldn't have labeled it that.<eos> Did we like what we saw?<eos> We did.
Stumbling through the forest.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Walkin' in front of trucks.<eos> No, I didn't.<eos> Sure, you did.
Got your little suit back?<eos> You're 40 minutes late.<eos> They sent my bag to the wrong hotel.<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Yes, he did?
So, the girls can do their own hair and makeup for now.<eos> Sure.<eos> Probably gonna have to make a budget for costumes.<eos> I'm sure you got ideas about that.<eos> - I do.
Someone else gets there first.<eos> I mean, it's like why bother even trying to make anything that you really care about?<eos> Because that's what you do.<eos> You're probably the only one who still cares about my work.<eos> I do.
When Baelfire rejected my magic, I respected it.<eos> I just wasn't brave enough to follow it.<eos> My whole dark life, I've sought out those who are light... like you.<eos> So, what, you don't want him to kill Emma?<eos> No, I don't.
It's like trying to make a list...<eos> - people yelling in your ear.<eos> - Big score potential.<eos> The... the pills I prescribed should help with that.<eos> They... do.
There are no witnesses to your wife entering Timothy Ifield's flat.<eos> No CCTV. No traffic cameras.<eos> No mobile phone GPS data.<eos> Well, she'd left her mobile phone at home.<eos> So did you, pal.
Do you love him?<eos> What?<eos> The boy.<eos> Do you love him?<eos> Of course I don't.
And Lizzie, what does she do?<eos> Doesn't she have you followed?<eos> Of course, but her ladies believe in Richard too, so they look the other way.<eos> From King James.<eos> How does your son?
Your rational mind.<eos> You're having a breakdown... a stress response.<eos> Your power is kicking in to save you.<eos> It created me.<eos> You did.
You just need everything to stop.<eos> You need people to stop bleeding, stop choking, for their lungs to stop filling with fluid, to stop crying, to stop screaming...<eos> Dr. Railly?<eos> Your patient's parents are here.<eos> It doesn't.
"There once was a serpent... "who only traveled one direction. "Always forward, never backward.<eos> "Until one day, the serpent came upon a demon."<eos> - What's it mean?<eos> - I don't know. I didn't write it.<eos> - Who did?
- Someone stole...<eos> - Well, let's not dwell on that.<eos> I gave you a syringe a few weeks back. It's the last one, and we need it for Liv.<eos> Do you have it with you?<eos> I... I did. Um...
Move your feet.<eos> Did you hear that?<eos> That's a nice one.<eos> Next time, I'll teach you how to snap off a real curveball.<eos> Hey, how you doing?
He's drinking all the time.<eos> He's pushing the limits of what he's doing with these people.<eos> They signed up for it.<eos> They knew what they were getting into. No!<eos> They didn't.
It could be nothing, but...<eos> What the hell?<eos> It's a foreign object buried in his shoulder.<eos> Where'd this man say he was from again?<eos> He didn't.
Tell me... How many Indians did your ancestors butcher in order to acquire that fine ranch of yours?<eos> That's tellin' her, Niles.<eos> Let the lady answer.<eos> I don't know.<eos> Probably as many as yours did.
- No, it's great.<eos> You know, I get to...<eos> I get to work with my hands. It's simple work. - Mm.<eos> - I... uh, watch something go up.<eos> - Yeah, Johnny did construction, didn't he?
I had no one, I just... I had nowhere to go.<eos> And you?<eos> You found somewhere to go. I mean, you... you found a place that has the answers that you need, you know?<eos> It probably saved your life.<eos> - Yeah. - It did.
Except you're not a beast.<eos> You kinda saw me as one.<eos> And you didn't break up with me to save me from the wild world of beastdom.<eos> - No.<eos> - Why did you?
That's why you couldn't kill me before and why you can't do it now.<eos> Stop talking!<eos> Do this... and you will become everything you hate.<eos> I don't have a choice.<eos> Yes... you do.
- Oh, come on.<eos> Is it because of Maggie?<eos> She'll get over it.<eos> No. I don't want to be with him. Okay.<eos> You do, though.
You were always so good.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> Incredible grades, a clean room, ooh, you never talked back, and you never messed around with the boys.<eos> Most parents would appreciate that.<eos> Oh, I did... then.
Please.<eos> Obaith wylarn myrr sa'norrwyn.<eos> You want me to follow you back down there so I could be the next to be killed?<eos> You heard about Enoch.<eos> Of course I did.
With someone not me.<eos> You were busy. ...with $8.3 billion in assets, it'll be the fourth largest Ponzi scheme in America...<eos> I know her.<eos> Who, her? I hope you didn't have any money wrapped up with them.<eos> My aunt did.
Okay, give me a minute.<eos> Adrian.<eos> Hey.<eos> I didn't know we had a meeting.<eos> No, no, we didn't.
- Of course.<eos> Never turn down an opportunity for love just because it comes in a different package. I have a question.<eos> I...<eos> I mean, it's, uh...<eos> Tracy P... Tracy P. does.
Just a little something for lettin' me shack up with ya.<eos> Speaking of shacking up, isn't that the cutie that's hot for your booty?<eos> Oh, man, I'm starting to sound like Toby.<eos> How do I look?<eos> How you doing?
- You will?<eos> - Yes, I promise.<eos> - Okay. - Thank you.<eos> - Can I get a kiss?<eos> - Please do.
Doctor?<eos> I... I may have misspoke.<eos> But you know the patient is an ISIS fighter?<eos> Doctor, answer the question.<eos> I do.
Yeah, well, let's see what a disbarment committee says. Get home safe.<eos> Yeah, let's see what they say.<eos> What was your quote? Um...<eos> "When you go after me professionally," "I go after you personally." - I never said that.<eos> - Yes, you did.
I will not!<eos> As mayor, my word is my bond.<eos> If I say that we're getting trees and swing sets, we're getting trees and swing sets!<eos> Except we have no money to get anything!<eos> - Of course we do. - No, we don't!
Okay, uh... I got to go.<eos> You're a terrible kisser.<eos> Must suck to be on the outs with Lucifer.<eos> He hates it when people manipulate him.<eos> I didn't.
Liz, what can I do?<eos> How can I help?<eos> You are helping.<eos> You know what I mean.<eos> I do.
Help me finish this infuriating puzzle.<eos> And when iniko does come, you'll be waiting with a magic bullet.<eos> Aram, talk to me.<eos> Are you sure you didn't see which way they went?<eos> I didn't, no.
Both of them?<eos> Who?<eos> Oh, yes.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I do.
I don't even know why...<eos> 'Cause you want a family.<eos> 'Cause I want a family?<eos> Don't we want a family?<eos> No, of course we do.
The jail trouble?<eos> No, it's worse.<eos> She sniffed a man's shirt.<eos> I don't expect you to understand.<eos> Okay, good. 'Cause I don't.
And if you ever invite me there, I'm gonna murder you so hard.<eos> I don't want to be romanced, okay?<eos> I w...<eos> I want to be loved.<eos> - Yeah, I do.
When did you become a grumpy old man who doesn't like people?<eos> I like people.<eos> I don't like Riggs.<eos> If you want to go to dinner with the guy, go to dinner.<eos> If you don't, don't.
Well, things are looking up for me, too.<eos> - I got a date tonight. - Oh!<eos> Is it someone in the hospital?<eos> I didn't say that.<eos> Your face did.
She thought her doctors were wrong.<eos> Yeah, I think you're right.<eos> Oh, there's more.<eos> Uh. How could there possibly be more?<eos> When did she do all of this?
Okay, okay.<eos> Excuse me. Did you say erectile-dysfunction drugs?<eos> Yes, ma'am.<eos> Hopefully somebody on board has some.<eos> Well, actually... we do.
I'll get a warming blanket.<eos> No!<eos> Can you...<eos> Will you just hold me?<eos> We did good?
All right, you're gonna be all right.<eos> - We have been looking for you!<eos> - You scared the crap out of me!<eos> - Oh, I need some O2.<eos> - Yeah, of course you do.
Maybe she was seeking someone who loved her unconditionally.<eos> Creep.<eos> God.<eos> But God doesn't love me.<eos> Of course He does.
- Titty Tuesdays. - Titty Tuesdays.<eos> And we were, like, "Look, man, we would love to indulge you", but we got about negative-three reasons why... we can't do it."<eos> - Callback! - I know, I know.<eos> Gotta do it for...<eos> I do it for the callbacks.
Because there's nothing for you out there.<eos> Nothing you can say will keep me in this abysmal Hamlet a moment longer than I need to be.<eos> "Abysmal Hamlet"?<eos> Sounds like you haven't had the right tour guide.<eos> But now you do.
Hey, aren't you happy for me?<eos> What's the deal?<eos> Alan, I thought we were going to your mom's house to hang out.<eos> - Do you not want to hang out?<eos> - I do. Okay? I really do.
My sister used to post up here.<eos> From the way Crane talks about her, she...<eos> She was something special.<eos> They had something special.<eos> We all did.
What did he tell you?<eos> He told me that you believed I was special, while my mother wanted to protect me...<eos> Yes, you-you are special.<eos> And your mother did want to protect you, she wanted it very much.<eos> We all did.
He's free.<eos> Okay.<eos> And he told me to tell you something.<eos> He told me that you should let Molly have that new cell phone that she's been asking for.<eos> - He did, did he? - Oh, yeah.
Now I emailed you the recipe but maybe it went to spam because of the word clam.<eos> Yep.<eos> - It's all right, sweetheart.<eos> - You like hummus?<eos> - No, dear, I don't.
I should like to believe you.<eos> Tell me, why do you seek the grave of Gawain?<eos> Eh... it's a long story.<eos> I enjoy long stories.<eos> Yeah, he does.
-I want to fight you.<eos> -No, you don't.<eos> I would destroy you.<eos> So instead let's think about why you wanted to come here in the first place.<eos> I didn't.
We could get an immediate extradition, but it's just the beginning.<eos> I really screwed up and I'm so sorry.<eos> It was for the right reason.<eos> I don't know what happened, but I know I didn't kill anyone.<eos> We do, too.
Beginners just try a side plank.<eos> I am not one to hold on to things.<eos> How are you doing that?<eos> So if you said it, I'd rather you just tell me.<eos> Fine. I did.
We are preaching to ourselves, too.<eos> We can all learn from God's words.<eos> - No one expects you to be perfect.<eos> - Yes, they do!<eos> The Church does. You do!
First, have a seat.<eos> Interesting office.<eos> My parents surrendered this room to me when I was 12, so...<eos> Your parents live here?<eos> They did, yeah.
Oh, yeah.<eos> It's Rich Eisen.<eos> You know Rich, right?<eos> Did I tell you I asked him to be the co-host of my TV show?<eos> No, you didn't, Michael.
But he deserves it.<eos> He deserved it.<eos> He deserves to rot in hell.<eos> You're right.<eos> He does.
Not just get yourself killed, but your recruits, too?<eos> How do we even know they're Bundes...<eos> Bundes...<eos> Bundesnachrichtendienst?<eos> We don't.
Look, it-it's just that, um... her ex killed my dad.<eos> I know.<eos> But that's only if you believe that death is finite.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I do, so...
What about it?<eos> It said "dark".<eos> Yes, well that's why we're hurrying, because there's not much light at this time of day.<eos> But it talked!<eos> Well, of course it did.
But it talked!<eos> Well, of course it did.<eos> It's a crow. All crows talk.<eos> They don't talk in the future.<eos> Course they do.
- It's in three hours and one minute.<eos> I want to tell you a story.<eos> I was a witness to a murder, and my testimony put the wrong man in prison.<eos> But you didn't mean to do the wrong thing.<eos> No, I didn't.
- Morning. I'm sorry to have to bring you a bit of bad news.<eos> Well, that never stops anybody, does it?<eos> Well, due to security concerns,<eos> Jordan has decided to cancel the Iranian/Israeli youth soccer game that was organized by Rabbi Lowenthal.<eos> They didn't do that already?
It's the only God I know.<eos> Cora, what are you burning?<eos> Please, will you read?<eos> You don't even believe in God.<eos> Ronnie did.
Who's Tessa?<eos> Should I be jealous?<eos> I thought you were in India.<eos> Does Rhys know you're here?<eos> No, he doesn't.
...Not only is Jeremiah Davis a potential suspect in the murder of Margaret Henderson, but he's trying to kill me, too.<eos> Oh, boo-hoo!<eos> Those are some serious allegations, Counselor.<eos> You better have evidence to back them up.<eos> I do, Your Honor.
Anthony... either you trust me or you don't.<eos> I get that you and Flynn are trying to wipe out Rittenhouse... We're no better than Rittenhouse.<eos> I know.<eos> I'm just a cog in Flynn's machine, I get it.<eos> I do.
You know, I worked on the campaign when he was governor.<eos> - Wow.<eos> - Is there a discount for that?<eos> - No, I'm sorry, we don't have that.<eos> - You don't?
Peace.<eos> Pentobarbital with champagne.<eos> Such a mind trip.<eos> Troy, if you're not ready, we don't have to do this today.<eos> Yeah, we do.
You're demented!<eos> I'm almost tempted to let you have a run at it just to watch you waste your fucking time.<eos> This technology did not work when Peter theorized it, and it doesn't work now.<eos> It-It, um...<eos> It actually does work now.
How do you figure?<eos> 'Cause now I know you had some embarrassing shit to hide.<eos> I don't even need to know what it is.<eos> My phone may be in the toilet, but... but I win.<eos> No, you don't.
No, I'm just gonna... the door. To...<eos> I was born to roam, anyways.<eos> Richard.<eos> Liz just told me.<eos> She did?
- Don't beg, Richard.<eos> - I'm not.<eos> According to the employee handbook, which you wrote, an employee cannot leave without giving two weeks' notice.<eos> You... you read the handbook?<eos> - Yeah, I did.
Can I help you?<eos> Hi, we're looking for a clock.<eos> It belonged to my grandfather.<eos> The auction website, it listed this address.<eos> Auction websites don't do that. Ugh, fine.
He was, but he's been very busy lately.<eos> He's working on a drug deal.<eos> It's taking up all of his time.<eos> He's eager to impress the, heads of SBK, and that doesn't concern you.<eos> Of course it does.
Like the TV show?<eos> Well, actually, The Mentalist was based on me.<eos> Man, you must be loaded!<eos> I, no...<eos> No, they didn't...
Okay, she's lying to you.<eos> She is manipulating you.<eos> I'll call you back.<eos> I have to talk to you.<eos> Yeah, you do.
No.<eos> You are nothing like her.<eos> What the hell, Nicole?<eos> I was just seeing if you still had the will to live.<eos> You do.
It is so not fine.<eos> You are being followed by the police, and now you're helping somebody escape police custody.<eos> I don't even know what this has become. - You don't understand.<eos> - I didn't have a choice.<eos> Well, I do.
But the other one, that's, that's a fairy tale.<eos> Are you saying that I hired Raymond Thorpe?<eos> Is that it?<eos> I don't even know him.<eos> Actually, you do.
Montsie.<eos> His name is Montsie.<eos> I didn't know they had a foreign exchange student.<eos> I didn't know they moved to North Carolina.<eos> Neither did I.
And then Margaret.<eos> I thought of changing my identity again, but what I did instead was to create a world in my head I can step into when things are difficult.<eos> Some people think that's me being aloof, but it's the only way I can make it through the day. - I...<eos> I hope this makes sense.<eos> - It does!
Uh, no, we did not.<eos> I mean, when you kissed us both on the mouth we sort of pieced it together.<eos> Listen, I don't want to cause any drama.<eos> - We don't want any drama! - Who wants drama?<eos> Nobody... does.
All I know is that when Richard called, I knew what he was saying was true.<eos> Please...<eos> None of us knows what's true.<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, we do.
Because you know her too.<eos> It's Alice.<eos> Honestly, I don't think that she knew anything about Shades.<eos> No, of course not.<eos> That Alice didn't.
Found that out from Tina.<eos> Yeah.<eos> So?<eos> Everyone knows that.<eos> I didn't.
Now at least they'll know this, too.<eos> It's so sweet, Colt.<eos> And you even put the comma in the right spot.<eos> Honestly, that was just a lucky guess.<eos> I didn't... I just...
I would make copies of my mom and dad in a 3D printer and give them to every kid because my mom and dad love me no matter what and everyone should have that.<eos> That's a good answer, Ella.<eos> We got this.<eos> I did not see that coming.<eos> No one did.
- I got you, boo.<eos> - So let's have a great show.<eos> Janet, before we go out there, there's just there's something that I need to say.<eos> No need. I got your number.<eos> No, you don't.
If only everyone could see this side of him.<eos> Ah, Jane is researching.<eos> Some things never change.<eos> Okay. Time's up.<eos> But some things do.
What?<eos> I don't care about the show.<eos> I'm happy when you're here.<eos> Have you thought about everything?<eos> Yeah, I did.
All right, to be continued.<eos> For right now, what about Shangri-La?<eos> Lam's about to take it over and we're not gonna let that happen.<eos> Lam can take it over, but only if he has the staff.<eos> He does.
If the world still exists.<eos> Let's hear it.<eos> Okay, yeah, well, uh, this is the solar system today.<eos> And, uh, excuse me. If you don't mind...<eos> - I do.
We position a probe next to the asteroid.<eos> Even though its mass is small, the probe generates its own gravitational field.<eos> Diverting the asteroid's path just enough to miss Earth.<eos> But you need a rocket powerful enough to get it there in time, and that rocket doesn't exist yet.<eos> Well, actually, it does.
As do I. I invented it.<eos> If you mean you invented the art of deception and subterfuge, then I can hardly argue.<eos> Give me a good reason why I should not have you killed.<eos> Because you do not wish me dead.<eos> I don't? No.
Uh le nail salon.<eos> You'll be right there. It's right there.<eos> How's it going?<eos> Hey, man.<eos> How you doing, Chip?
I wasn't aware I did it.<eos> Well, you do, and it's annoying, and judgey, to be honest.<eos> You know? Like you know something I don't.<eos> Okay.<eos> Do you?
- I haven't!<eos> I saw the wolf. The wolf is real.<eos> If there is a pandemic, it should have been mentioned online by now.<eos> - Not everything turns up on Facebook.<eos> - Yes, actually, it does.
If I was an escaped murderer, where would I hide?<eos> Where?<eos> Oh, I have no idea.<eos> I just thought if I gasped I could force an epiphany.<eos> And I did.
Not as sorry as I am.<eos> No one here believes that you're responsible for what happened to your wife.<eos> It doesn't matter.<eos> I have to go.<eos> No, you don't.
braendt i flys... tyrt'.<eos> - LaPointe.<eos> - Sorry.<eos> Erm... - Did you find out Anderson's real name?<eos> - I did, yes.
What makes you so confident?<eos> Because I believed him when he said he didn't know Isaac Goldberg.<eos> Was that his name?<eos> Aren't you going to ask me if I knew him?<eos> Did you?
Although now that I think about it, I may not have.<eos> Oh, good, everyone's here to see this.<eos> Matt, take that off.<eos> That was supposed to catch the critter living in my garage.<eos> It did.
Take care, Pastor.<eos> I don't understand, what happened with the investigation against Mr. Gowen?<eos> It was dropped.<eos> But Jack said the Inspector General had solid evidence against him.<eos> They did.
Too bad, 'cause it's not gonna work.<eos> Oh, it's gonna work all right.<eos> No, it won't.<eos> 'Cause you don't have what it takes.<eos> Yes, I do.
- I want to figure this out, too, but I have to go home eventually.<eos> - You think anyone cares about your damned plans?<eos> I know I don't.<eos> Do you care, Amy?<eos> - No, I don't.
Have I... always had bad taste?<eos> Just like I said.<eos> - Yeah, I said it, too. - Ha.<eos> Okay, whatever.<eos> - I did!
It's quiet there... except in the rookeries, where the penguins breed.<eos> Those aren't quiet. No, sir.<eos> I'm finished with my answer.<eos> Great.<eos> Almost done for today.
And I'll be just fine.<eos> All right, what?<eos> I mean, you want to talk about your music?<eos> - What?<eos> - We did.
- Five.<eos> - Five.<eos> Five. Enough.<eos> Save it for the stage.<eos> We already did that.
You're gonna go on after the speeches. Oh. Want to come?<eos> Si.<eos> Hey, Hunter, you mind if I talk to you a minute?<eos> Yeah, sure.<eos> How you doing?
Besides, ten grand is like a Chanel bag for you.<eos> Don't worry, I'll pay you back.<eos> You really love that boy, Alexandra?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I really do.
Actually, I do.<eos> Damn, baby.<eos> Look at you.<eos> Looking fine as ever.<eos> - How you doing?
Come on, now.<eos> All that mess you pulled with Mary.<eos> And I can't even count how many times you screwed over Carlotta.<eos> Well, I didn't exactly have my head screwed on straight at the time, - you know what I'm saying?<eos> - Oh, and you do now?
- You know what?<eos> Y'all go ahead and take a minute.<eos> What do you think?<eos> - I think you got something.<eos> - You really do?
What is it that you're trying to do?<eos> I just told you that I loved you.<eos> What do you want me to say, Hunter?<eos> That I love you, too?<eos> I do.
The only thing off the cuff is this speech, and, you know, it's still, you know, kind of...<eos> I think... very great.<eos> Well, congratulations, Ray.<eos> You win.<eos> We all do.
Hello, Doctor.<eos> Is that the President?<eos> It was.<eos> I take it he read the Veritas.<eos> So did I.
- Really?<eos> - Oh, yeah.<eos> When you're nine, cute, and me, you can sell anything to anybody.<eos> You have any interest in going to Bora Bora?<eos> Hell, yeah, I do.
No, not him.<eos> Him!<eos> Ooh... nice!<eos> Gabi, I don't want to marry you.<eos> - You don't?
My license is a little iffy.<eos> How great was that storm-out?<eos> And they say you don't learn anything from the Real Housewives.<eos> Elliot, I have something tell you.<eos> Of course you do.
Sam, Hetty has something else for you.<eos> Where is Hetty?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Uh, all she said this morning was that she had one last card to play.<eos> She always does.
Step forward to be baptized.<eos> On your knees.<eos> Why are they restraining him?<eos> Samuel, do you accept Him into your heart?<eos> I do.
You received your MBA from Columbia, didn't you?<eos> I did.<eos> Do you remember the subject of your master's thesis?<eos> Well, it was 30 years ago.<eos> No, I don't.
You know what it feels like now?<eos> You are fearless.<eos> Like you.<eos> We need to talk, Nicky.<eos> Yeah, we do.
Whoever left that info for you in the elevator didn't want it traced back to them.<eos> Well, luckily, they gave us enough to figure out where the anonymous tip was placed from.<eos> City directory says it's a pay phone in the Financial District.<eos> - They still have those?<eos> - In 2011, they did.
You'll hear from forensics experts that there was blood on the bathroom sink and shower where Gerald had cleaned up.<eos> He was horrified.<eos> Your wife is dead...<eos> Who worries about appearances?<eos> The defendant does.
No, it doesn't matter.<eos> You have no idea what you're up against.<eos> Oh, I think I have a pretty good idea.<eos> No.<eos> You don't, actually.
We just like to help the elderly when we can.<eos> I mean, how can it be a happy new year if you don't do something for others?<eos> Yeah, well, helping others can be a little neglectful to your family.<eos> That's why we're going as a family to the Orson Escape Room.<eos> Oh, we did that 18 months ago!
Okay? I'm gonna say "Jesus wept." We gonna be right out of here.<eos> - He knows how you...<eos> - He gonna talk about Jesus for 20 minutes.<eos> He know he wept, okay?<eos> He did the weeping.
I'm directly quoting her on that.<eos> I always thought of myself as the nudgy comic relief, like Balki or a Skippy or a Boner, but if an objective third party is saying I'm a leading man, it must be true.<eos> Now all we need are some hunky headshots to prove you're not a total goob.<eos> Not that Edie thinks that.<eos> Nobody does.
God! What is wrong with us? !<eos> This has to stop!<eos> - Does it?<eos> - I don't know!<eos> It does.
- JTP.<eos> - Yes!<eos> You got to give the guy credit.<eos> He always fights for what he wants.<eos> Yeah, he does, doesn't he?
For real?<eos> So you still want to go to prom?<eos> Is a nerf herder scruffy-looking?<eos> Jackie, no one knows what that is.<eos> I do.
Hey! How'd the speech go, Ray?<eos> No one liked it.<eos> - Kenneth!<eos> - No, it's true.<eos> No one did.
Look, it's just faster if you tell me what you need rather than pretending you want to hang out with me.<eos> No.<eos> One lump or two?<eos> I thought it'd be nice to hang out and do something you like, for once.<eos> You do like afternoon tea, right?
♪<eos> Oh, Ms. DiMeo!<eos> Thank you for coming.<eos> You're probably wondering why I asked you here.<eos> You did?
My husband and I went to check the mail, and we found... a pastrami sandwich just sitting in our mailbox.<eos> It was freaky.<eos> That is why I propose that we start a Neighborhood Watch.<eos> I know some of you may think I'm overreacting, like the police did, but I...<eos> Like hell we do.
That is why I propose that we start a Neighborhood Watch.<eos> I know some of you may think I'm overreacting, like the police did, but I...<eos> Like hell we do.<eos> I don't want a sandwich in my mailbox.<eos> Who does?
Let's go.<eos> It's warm.<eos> Disobedience.<eos> Eddie, I specifically told you not to use the dishwasher.<eos> - I didn't!
So, for this first shot, Tony's gonna demonstrate the Un-Gun.<eos> And then he'll ask, "And how does it work on those salads?"<eos> At which point, we will pan over to you, and you're gonna say your line, which is,<eos> "Onions, shallots, scallions...<eos> It does it all!"
The Un-Gun.<eos> It's so easy, the only thing you'll be crying about is not getting one sooner.<eos> And how does it work on that salad?<eos> Onions, shallions, scallots...<eos> It does all of them!
Rolling.<eos> And... action!<eos> And how does it work on that salad?<eos> Onions, shillions, skillets...<eos> It does them all!
And how does it work on that salad?<eos> Onions, shillions, skillets...<eos> It does them all!<eos> Cut.<eos> Onions, shallots, sicillians... It does them all!
Cut.<eos> Onions, shallots, sicillians... It does them all!<eos> Okay, cut.<eos> Onions, garlic, galleons...<eos> It does them all!
And... action!<eos> The Un-Gun is so easy to use, the only thing you'll be crying about is not getting one sooner.<eos> And how does it work on that salad?<eos> Onions, shallots, scallions...<eos> It does them all!
- Mommy... did you...<eos> - Yes.<eos> I debated myself.<eos> Who do you think won?<eos> - Uh... - You did.
I actually came for you.<eos> Really? I seem to recall somebody wanting to go to the Chancellor's Ball.<eos> Wait, who told you?<eos> How did you know about that?<eos> You did.
Why are you wasting your time on me when there's probably some other guy -- or merman -- who'd be perfect for you?<eos> I mean, I've been telling you for a long time nothing's ever gonna happen between us.<eos> No, you haven't.<eos> You never told me you didn't like me.<eos> I didn't? No.
And people would tell me, "Oh, girls are great when they're little, but wait till she's a teenager."<eos> And then you were a teenager, and you were just as delightful, and I thought, "We are gonna be best friends forever." And now...<eos> Come here, Mom. No. No!<eos> You don't want me.<eos> Yes, I do.
I'm not the one who's kissing one guy and dating another.<eos> What am I supposed to do?<eos> You don't want to tell anyone.<eos> I don't even like Chester.<eos> Oh, of course you do.
Yeah.<eos> Wait, wait.<eos> No, you can't do that.<eos> You don't have any money.<eos> Actually, I do.
Um, we have to process your home for evidence tonight.<eos> Do you have someplace to stay?<eos> Mr. Kettering, do you have someplace to sleep tonight?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, I do.
I knew he was officer material.<eos> I was helping him apply for a commission.<eos> We sent off his application to Officer Candidate School a few weeks before he went missing.<eos> In that time together, did he ever mention having any issues with anyone?<eos> Only with Baxter, but... so did everyone.
I'm not willing to risk it.<eos> That's not gonna work for me, Gibbs.<eos> I'm not a hospital guy.<eos> Besides, don't you think that Bishop is a lot more suited to protect Ellison?<eos> No... I don't.
The car has been there since 7:27 this morning.<eos> - Go, McGee.<eos> Take Bishop.<eos> - All right, Abby, send me the coordinates.<eos> Um, McGee, your phone doesn't do GPS.
Why?<eos> Why not kill me instead?<eos> I believe I have.<eos> She didn't deserve this.<eos> No, she didn't.
Nothing.<eos> Totally clean.<eos> Very professional.<eos> Looks like somebody knew what they were doing.<eos> Yeah... they sure did.
Yes, meaning my car is from the future and his is from the past, making me enlightened and him a dinosaur.<eos> They have been arguing like this for a while now.<eos> The thing is, I don't doubt that in the future electric cars will work, but they don't work now.<eos> - Well, they do.<eos> - They don't, James!
You're a good person.<eos> You risk everything for your country, and I hope I can live up to your example.<eos> Is Harry gone?<eos> I don't know, and I don't care.<eos> Yes, you do.
First I needed to sober up... remember what I'd done and pack my meager belongings.<eos> What you said last night...<eos> You were right.<eos> I didn't get what I wanted.<eos> But nobody does.
What's up, man?<eos> You want some coke?<eos> - You remember Callie and... - What are you doing?<eos> - ...her brother Christian.<eos> - Yeah, no, I don't.
What?<eos> - Hey, I'm sure I'm back. - Here we are.<eos> Yeah I've always thought That those tits can not be her.<eos> Oh - As? Women are turning ...<eos> - I did whatever I did today. What?
We used to smoke a lot of shit down here.<eos> You, me, and pope.<eos> Yeah, I remember.<eos> She tell you about my dad?<eos> Yeah, she did.
Rent's due.<eos> Gotta keep our money nice and clean.<eos> Do you want me to send it in?<eos> Read my mind.<eos> - How you doing with your homework?
You got to tell me, Bonnie.<eos> You got to tell me, okay?<eos> I'm your sister.<eos> I don't love him.<eos> I never did.
That's a good point.<eos> You never called me back.<eos> She doesn't care, Annie.<eos> You know she doesn't.<eos> Yeah, she does.
The truck was coming right at us, right, bullets flying everywhere.<eos> Luckily, I had my raid vest on.<eos> Brian Williams here seems to forget that he was around the corner in the surveillance van - at the time.<eos> - Okay, did I or did I not catch the killer?<eos> - [Chuckles] He did.
That's plenty of time. So why didn't he?<eos> Sometimes, in our line of work, things just go wrong.<eos> - Sure.<eos> - I'm afraid we may never know what happened during Emilio's last moments.<eos> - Well, but actually, we do.
Sometimes, in our line of work, things just go wrong.<eos> - Sure.<eos> - I'm afraid we may never know what happened during Emilio's last moments.<eos> - Well, but actually, we do.<eos> - We do.
# Don't...<eos> Don't you want me?<eos> # Not dressed like that.<eos> # You know I can't believe it when I hear that you won't see me ♪ Don't... ♪<eos> Don't!
Amen!<eos> - Amen!<eos> - You are preaching blasphemy.<eos> And I will have the blood of this entire church on my hands if I do not speak!<eos> Please, sister, do.
I thought we were good.<eos> We are.<eos> I've just decided not to try again.<eos> You don't want to be a mom anymore?<eos> No, I do, but, um...
Do you believe in witches?<eos> Emanuelle, this is Stephan Narcisse, he's the lord chancellor of France.<eos> Stephan, this is a witch that my pious daughter,<eos> Leeza, rounded up amongst other heretics. I didn't care for her.<eos> Clearly, you don't, either.
Yeah, it's funny how things work out sometimes.<eos> I like your hat.<eos> Thanks, yeah, it was my grandpa's.<eos> Did Nick ever tell you that he and I used to play on a team?<eos> No, he did not.
There was someone else in the room, but...<eos> Man or woman? I don't know because I was drugged. It was all hazy.<eos> How'd you get blood on your hands?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Yes, you do.
Coming out of the sky, a man in a golden helmet is lifting the bus to safety.<eos> Hey, now, we all just saw Alex run out of here, and then...<eos> - you don't think...<eos> - About him naked?<eos> Yes, I do.
Yes, because I'm in a... work situation.<eos> You see, you just did it again.<eos> Okay, fine.<eos> Yes, I wanted kids.<eos> You did?
You may be dying, but I am here to make sure it's not fatal.<eos> Do you remember who I am?<eos> John.<eos> Of course I remember.<eos> But no one else does.
- You got a minute?<eos> - Sure.<eos> Just wanted you to know how much I appreciate this.<eos> Your father always said you were a good kid.<eos> He did, huh?
Do we know where they were going?<eos> No, but they're still being tracked.<eos> Kate Baldwin was never supposed to talk to him. - This interview cannot happen.<eos> - We still have time.<eos> No, we don't.
There's a guard on the second floor working with us.<eos> He'll escort you to a corner where a cab will be waiting.<eos> Just... get in.<eos> So you don't miss Texas?<eos> No, I do.
Then why didn't you say that?<eos> Because that's not what people do.<eos> Well, I would prefer if people told me exactly what is on their mind.<eos> No.<eos> No, you don't, you really don't.
Carlos, Carlos.<eos> Hey... hey, Carlos.<eos> Um, this, uh, Cameron Tucker.<eos> I don't know if you remember me or not.<eos> Oh, you... you do. Okay, hi.
She was seeing someone, then stopped seeing him, and now she's seeing him again.<eos> - Bitch sounds bootless. - She's not.<eos> So, she was seeing someone, then she's seeing you, and now she's seeing him again?<eos> She thought he was dead.<eos> So did I.
I want to stop that, too.<eos> Why?<eos> Because I can't be the guy waiting around for letters or writing words that I don't mean.<eos> - Don't say that.<eos> - I don't.
It was like the ghosts of Valentine's day past and future.<eos> What's it say about us that we'd rather just watch netflix and take separate baths?<eos> Well, it means we've gone to the next level in our relationship, after years of fighting traffic and overpaying for chocolate soufflÃ©s.<eos> I mean, I don't even like chocolate soufflÃ©s.<eos> Nobody does!
What was your plans for your future?<eos> We wanted to have a family together, and we wanted to build a life together and stuff.<eos> We thought we really had a chance to do it, so we were happy about that.<eos> Does your mom and stepdad know what you did?<eos> No, they don't.
You want to tell me how you're connected?<eos> Wait... What did Enger say?<eos> Enough to get me listening.<eos> So you have no idea how wrapped up in this she is?<eos> No, I don't.
By offering you something that you value far, far, more than me.<eos> And what could that possibly be?<eos> Guys, do you have any idea how insane this plan is?<eos> Do you realise how many things could go wrong?<eos> Yes, and so does she.
- Just letting you know that I heard you.<eos> But no need to do it anymore.<eos> If you're gonna go and you've heard me, beep twice.<eos> Great.<eos> No, you just do once.
- There's a way to see your rating as a passenger. - Really?<eos> - Drivers rate you,<eos> - just like you rate drivers. - What?<eos> - They rate you?<eos> - Yes, they all do it.
David, can I talk to you outside for a second?<eos> I know you're terrified, but they know what they're doing.<eos> No, I'm sure they do.<eos> You just have no idea what it's like to have a child that you worry about every second of every day.<eos> Actually, I do.
But you know what Al's been up to.<eos> You can't read the morning paper without seeing his name.<eos> Keep it down, will you?<eos> My wife and kids don't know my real name.<eos> Nobody does.
- Restocking already?<eos> - They say liquor sells itself.<eos> Bet the sight of you pouring' it don't hurt either.<eos> How does our latest cocktail progress?<eos> - It doesn't.
No word from Ferris?<eos> Nothing.<eos> What do you want to do?<eos> Michelle trusts him?<eos> Yes, she does.
What is it?<eos> Granger.<eos> There's been a shooting at the hospital.<eos> I thought he had 24-hour protection.<eos> He did.
There's a thing going on.<eos> It... I...<eos> Smell it.<eos> You... you don't...<eos> Do you...
- Don...<eos> - No, no, no, no, no, no, no... - No.<eos> - Not your fight right now.<eos> - Come on, come on, come on.<eos> - Don't...
Damn, I can't afford to live there.<eos> - Objection.<eos> - Eh, withdrawn.<eos> My point is you got a sob story.<eos> We all do.
Be fearless.<eos> Must be nice to have somewhere to let go.<eos> You don't need permission.<eos> I just... I with I had somewhere to unleash my beast.<eos> You do.
Go, go, go, go.<eos> Let me see your hands!<eos> My mom's gonna be here in a second.<eos> I'm sorry... that I didn't tell you.<eos> Not that I did it.
Ximena has agreed to let you shadow her.<eos> - Are those yours?<eos> - I'm on a derby team.<eos> I wish I had somewhere to unleash my beast.<eos> You do.
- I have work, so.<eos> - And I have plans with Noah.<eos> Well, you can invite him.<eos> Wait, why are we inviting the new neighbors over for dinner?<eos> We never did that with the old ones.
I... It's, you know, the weekend.<eos> Blow off a little steam.<eos> You should try it.<eos> Do you want to dance?<eos> No, he doesn't.
Okay.<eos> I forgive you.<eos> So does Ximena know you didn't tell moms that you were practicing with the team?<eos> If I tell you, are you gonna go off on me again?<eos> So she doesn't.
WNBC's NewsYUKO has more.<eos> This is it! Shut the hell up, Kimmy.<eos> And I'll be damned if this hotsy-totsy rich mother-- [announcer] This is a News-4 weather alert.<eos> What? They cut me off like I'm some "who cares" fluff piece about a blind kid who loves his mailman.<eos> He does?
How do I talk about "you know who" "you know what-ing" me while we were in the "you know where"?<eos> Okay, when you meet Alex Trebek, don't get freaked out that he has legs.<eos> What?<eos> No, I know people have legs.<eos> Lieutenant Dan doesn't.
It's gone down twice. Why not make it a TKO?<eos> We need to keep your country safe.<eos> Henry believes extraordinary times call for extraordinary measures.<eos> - And what do you believe?<eos> - Whatever he does.
I'd look at him and think,<eos> "There's a surgeon, a one guard for the Bulls."<eos> I want to grab Olinsky and tell him it's gonna be okay... but it's not, never will be.<eos> The confession... I didn't actually hear it.<eos> Who did?
No.<eos> How do I put them on?<eos> Check the Internet?<eos> Did you know that originally condoms were made out of leather?<eos> I did not.
Consider taking my job.<eos> I'm gonna retire, and I already mentioned you to the guy that makes the decisions here, so...<eos> Ho-Hold on.<eos> I know you love being a cop, Roger.<eos> I did, too.
Same hotel, room service.<eos> Or not.<eos> You know, I can eat ten sliders on my own anyway.<eos> What's up?<eos> How we doing?
Why didn't you say anything? !<eos> I like being chauffeured around.<eos> It makes me feel important.<eos> So when I got up at 4:00 a.m. to drive you across the desert to an Antique Train Museum, I didn't have to?<eos> No, you didn't.
Come on. They know how to raise kids.<eos> They raised me, and I'm fantastic.<eos> Well, you're humble. I'll give you that.<eos> Look, I will talk to them, and make sure they do everything the way I do.<eos> Oh, the way we do.
And you are?<eos> Bonnie Plunkett.<eos> Oh, great.<eos> Well, it appears he has a type. Oh.<eos> Or you and I do.
- You just broke into my house.<eos> - Yeah, I don't care about you.<eos> Wow.<eos> - You really love him, don't you?<eos> - Of course I do.
You ran circles around Peasant Number One.<eos> - Did you see that?<eos> - Damn right I saw it. - Aww.<eos> - Multiple times.<eos> Dad never did.
We should double back, find another path. This is all too exposed.<eos> You must know my friend Kate.<eos> Should've told you about Janet.<eos> It doesn't matter.<eos> It does to me.
Excuse me?<eos> I'm sorry to interrupt, but is one of you named Matt Casey?<eos> Yeah. That's me.<eos> You saved my daughter's life.<eos> All of you did.
I'd look at him and think,<eos> "There's a surgeon, a one guard for the Bulls."<eos> I want to grab Olinsky and tell him it's gonna be okay... but it's not, never will be.<eos> The confession... I didn't actually hear it.<eos> Who did?
No one's been keeping tabs on her?<eos> We severed all ties.<eos> Tough love, it's what they told us to do.<eos> Do any of you know a man named Bobby Trent?<eos> No, no, I don't.
Ah, but a man of your talents will manage.<eos> If we are to crush this rebellion, we must make examples of its leaders.<eos> As you wish, Governor Tarkin.<eos> She did it.<eos> Hera really did it.
You okay, Beth?<eos> Guy bothering you?<eos> No, babe.<eos> It's just someone from work who happened to be in the neighborhood.<eos> How you doing, man?
No, nothing.<eos> I'm just saying, we usually start things off with an actual crime. Phone call, a body.<eos> But here, banking a lot on this Rita friend of yours.<eos> You must have good reason to trust her instincts.<eos> I do.
But here, banking a lot on this Rita friend of yours.<eos> You must have good reason to trust her instincts.<eos> I do.<eos> Keep fishing, New York.<eos> Thanks for doing this, Dwayne.
Dean, don't tell her.<eos> Don't tell her.<eos> - Don't tell me what, Dean?<eos> - Don't you tell her.<eos> Don't you...
What do you got?<eos> Foreign particles adhered to the esophagus, lining the lungs.<eos> - Theory?<eos> - Brewing. We got any sodium rhodizonate?<eos> Yeah, we do!
If you'll just kneel.<eos> That's not gonna happen.<eos> Guys, we can just forego the ceremony and introduce him to the game, right?<eos> You came.<eos> Sure I did, kid.
Today was...<eos> Par for the course.<eos> You were great, by the way.<eos> Truly appreciate your help.<eos> The whole gang does.
Unfortunately, the United States is out.<eos> South Korea is moving on to Level 4, and, boy, do they look thrilled.<eos> Hyunho didn't get high enough to get his legs onto that next coil.<eos> There he goes!<eos> Doing a great job right now.
- And maybe the Earth, or maybe not.<eos> - Mm-hm.<eos> - He's kinda tall.<eos> He seems clean, like he likes a good shower.<eos> I do like a good shower.
some weird half-crisis thing.<eos> And my eyes are probably tired, because I spent all day figuring out other people's problems.<eos> But you know what?<eos> I already know that shit.<eos> I do!
- Carl. - Aw.<eos> Well, you should get another one.<eos> I got the space.<eos> You do.<eos> You do.
Find out.<eos> He died.<eos> The funeral was yesterday.<eos> - You know where she is.<eos> - I do.
If Sabine hid something here, she made sure Nic couldn't find it.<eos> - Okay. - Mm.<eos> Okay, hold on.<eos> You don't want to?<eos> No, I... I do.
- Okay. - Mm.<eos> Okay, hold on.<eos> You don't want to?<eos> No, I... I do.<eos> I do, 100%.
Stand back, sir.<eos> Hey, hey!<eos> What did you have to tell me?<eos> They stopped looking for... ffor me.<eos> Who did?
You remember the first time we met Granger?<eos> How could I not?<eos> You drew on him and knocked him to the ground.<eos> Well, I thought he had kidnapped Hetty and rigged the entire boatshed with explosives.<eos> We all did.
See "in the near future" is four, "soon" is just one, four is more than one;<eos> saving time already.<eos> Genius.<eos> I was gonna say, "Why does anyone think Sheldon's a genius?"<eos> But I didn't.
Can you not tell Howard?<eos> Well, don't you think it'd be healthier if you told him what's going on with you?<eos> Don't you think it'd be healthier if you had your own apartment, grown man?<eos> Your secret is safe with me.<eos> Hey, since when do you do laundry on a Thursday?
That's not what I meant.<eos> You remember.<eos> We each chose our separate paths.<eos> Nothing's changed.<eos> With enough time some things do.
Look, I know I messed up last night, but there's this voice in my head, and it really got to me.<eos> I know the voice, Al.<eos> Eh. The fear, the doubt.<eos> I have it, too.<eos> Everyone does.
Those Lamanites did a number on you, didn't they?<eos> Heck, I thought you said it was one of them that pushed you off the cliff.<eos> _ but he's the only one.<eos> I've got a father and brothers and... And that girl you said I'm gonna marry.<eos> So I did.
Were Reid and Diana scheduled to have a visit?<eos> He didn't think so, but it happened anyway.<eos> What does the nurse say?<eos> Cassie didn't bring Diana.<eos> Another nurse did, a Carol Atkinson.
Kill him.<eos> When does it stop?<eos> Tomorrow.<eos> Do you honestly not remember any of this?<eos> Yeah, I do.
There are extenuating circumstances.<eos> Know how many times a day I hear that?<eos> I give in to him, the other will come crying.<eos> SSA Reid has rights.<eos> He sure does.
And here's one more.<eos> I won't be a part of this.<eos> You didn't tell us about the shoes.<eos> I knew it made me look guilty.<eos> You do now.
You do now.<eos> Why did you steal the prototype?<eos> I didn't steal it.<eos> I created it.<eos> You did.
These messages that you've been getting -- you know who sent them, don't you?<eos> You get it now?<eos> You killed her.<eos> She was ready to go.<eos> She did the first one herself.
Make it work?<eos> Well, I can't.<eos> I'm...<eos> I don't... have enough power.<eos> Of course you do, sis.
He was gonna teach me to Jet Ski!<eos> I know, baby, but I can teach you.<eos> I don't want you to teach me!<eos> - Dean!<eos> - I don't!
Something wrong?<eos> No, just... seems strange to bring down a detachment unit just to install fiber optic cable.<eos> Well, it is a pretty specialized install.<eos> Hey, check this out.<eos> I just did a quick rundown on Campbell's unit.
We have responsibilities.<eos> And we'll make it work.<eos> When you look back in 20 years, are you really gonna be happy if you didn't take a shot at the one thing you always said you wanted to do?<eos> But what if this doesn't work out?<eos> But what if it does?
I did it to save everyone else.<eos> Well, you exposed yourself, and now, you should leave the team.<eos> Yeah, I should.<eos> Yet I don't want you to.<eos> You don't?
Can we call you Jasper?<eos> He loves it.<eos> Hi, Jasper.<eos> Hey, you want to play a game?<eos> You do?
- Jasper spoke?<eos> ! - What? No.<eos> Carol, that's everyone.<eos> Did you say Gail?<eos> Yes, I did.
If you wake her up, I'll put you to sleep.<eos> This is really important for her.<eos> Yeah, well, so was going to that awards show with Tucker.<eos> But you don't see me plotting my revenge.<eos> You don't, do you?
Okay, we've had so much to drink.<eos> I was wondering where you went.<eos> Let's have some fun.<eos> - I don't want this.<eos> - Sure you do.
Who do we have next?<eos> Two CABGS, back to back.<eos> At least the hybrid suite's back online.<eos> Everyone's wondering who paid the ransom.<eos> I did.
That's not gonna look so good to outsiders.<eos> Especially when the outsider... running the depositions is Matthew Weitz.<eos> Yeah, he's trying to make a name for himself, trying to further his career.<eos> I didn't get subpoenaed. Maybe I could speak to my friends at the DOJ, see if they could delay the depositions.<eos> No, don't do that.
Quill!<eos> Eyes on the enemy!<eos> Tell your cowardly wooden friend to give us the sarcophagus!<eos> He doesn't have it!<eos> None of us do!
You want Princess T?<eos> You're gonna have to go through me!<eos> Works for me.<eos> Works for me, too.<eos> And so does he!
I just put a lot of stuff on you.<eos> Hey, I made assumptions about you, too. Because you're so... sweet and hot and I-I just... really wanted to have sex with you.<eos> Well, I really wanted to have sex with you, too.<eos> Yeah?<eos> I still do.
We used to bunk together.<eos> Yeah, she was...<eos> she was like a big sister.<eos> But anyhoo, they made me marry the leader who was 57.<eos> And you did it?
Why?<eos> I got a job.<eos> Baby, you know you need a break from all that Uncle Daddy shit.<eos> I know I do.<eos> And you do, too.
W...<eos> Everybody was so upset.<eos> Yeah, well...<eos> I don't remember nothin'.<eos> You don't?
What do you think?<eos> We're taking this case.<eos> I thought you were just evaluating him, Bull.<eos> You saw the video.<eos> He did it.
Your screen's filthy and it smells like peanut butter.<eos> Come on, concentrate.<eos> I paid 99 cents for this app.<eos> Okay, hypnosis doesn't work.<eos> Oh, yes, it does work.
She financed the attack.<eos> Now...<eos> It's not true.<eos> We all know that.<eos> But the country doesn't.
You knew what needed to be done.<eos> You wouldn't have flinched or hedged your bets.<eos> You are the right man for a job that I just made obsolete.<eos> If you think there's a move left to make and you can make it, this task force is yours.<eos> Clay, don't.
A source at the White House has confirmed that President Haas has been briefed on the situation...<eos> If I had a husband, they'd... hang his portrait in here.<eos> Of course, they don't hang portraits for presidents who are impeached.<eos> Did you write it?<eos> I did.
I don't want you to feel like you have to... No.<eos> Before I ever knew who Monroe Stahr was...<eos> I was a Minna Davis fan.<eos> I loved her.<eos> We all did.
Celebrating my miraculous survival.<eos> Shot point-blank, barely a scratch.<eos> Looks like more than a scratch to me. Yeah, well.<eos> - You should see the other guy.<eos> - Yeah, we did.
He's gonna kill Richard and make sure he takes the fall.<eos> Unless we stop him.<eos> You got yourself into a real mess here, Richard.<eos> You know I didn't do what they're accusing me of, right?<eos> Yeah, of course we do, Marino.
Who are you?<eos> My name's Lucy.<eos> I'm your daughter.<eos> I don't have a daughter.<eos> Yeah, you do.
- Chloe, I... I'm sorry.<eos> - You can't do this...<eos> It's all right, love, we'll sort it out. We'll sort it out.<eos> - You don't want me here.<eos> - No, I do. I do!
Yeah, and I'm gonna have a unit sitting on you every second.<eos> They're gonna be waking you up and tucking you in, and when you... when you spend the first dollar of that bank's money... and you will... you'll see me again.<eos> Come on.<eos> Listen, when you get in there, keep your head down, okay?<eos> Do your time.
- All right, stay there.<eos> We're gonna pop the doors. Get in through the back.<eos> Copy that.<eos> I said Hurst tool cutters, Mouch. - You did?<eos> - I did.
He needs his daughter.<eos> What he needs is some tough love.<eos> I'm all for him figuring out his life, but he's interfering in ours while he does it.<eos> Maybe I want him to do it with me.<eos> - And maybe I don't.
I'm sure next time will...<eos> No, I don't think there's gonna be a next time.<eos> When you're passionate about something, time means nothing.<eos> Who said that?<eos> You did.
We're plotting possible intercept courses with the asteroid to see which countries have available spacecraft out near Samson.<eos> Then we'll approach them about a collaborative mission.<eos> But we still don't know who was behind the hack.<eos> How do we know who we can trust?<eos> We don't.
About you.<eos> And you can ask me as many questions as you like to figure it out.<eos> But you only get one guess as to what it is.<eos> Now, guess correctly, I take your phone, I call our friend Lindsey, and I tell her to release your mother unharmed.<eos> If you don't...
Yeah, I would have, Spence.<eos> If someone was threatening my life, you bet your ass I would.<eos> It doesn't make you a bad person.<eos> 'Cause you know who does think like that, that... that in you doing what you had to do to survive somehow makes you a psychopath?<eos> She does.
What the hell is he talking about?<eos> Dr. Jason Bull is a highly regarded psychologist, widely considered a pioneer in the field of trial science.<eos> But let's talk about the facts of this particular case.<eos> Why didn't you tell us we took on Jules Caffrey?<eos> Because we didn't.
- Right, too far.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> This is all very new for me.<eos> - Son of a bitch. Where'd you find a steering wheel?<eos> - I didn't.
"Afraid"?<eos> I love doing that.<eos> It's like bubble wrap you get to have sex with every now and then.<eos> I got a pretty good one going right now, Peter.<eos> You always do, Lois.
I thought I'd run my own test, see what turned up.<eos> It was positive.<eos> Okay, well, that doesn't make any sense.<eos> Let me guess.<eos> It does to you.
- What anger?<eos> - But it's your...<eos> Do not say "mother"!<eos> A mother is someone who sticks around, day in, day out, and pays the price, like I did with her.<eos> - Well, you didn't exactly...
It's okay.<eos> You keep it.<eos> What's that supposed to mean?<eos> - Means I don't need it.<eos> - And we do? We do, Mom.
You keep it.<eos> What's that supposed to mean?<eos> - Means I don't need it.<eos> - And we do? We do, Mom.<eos> We really do.
I mean, a baby died every few pages.<eos> Well, yeah, but between the dead babies,<eos> I mean, there were some solid laughs.<eos> (gasps) You didn't read it, did you? - (gasps)<eos> Of course I did.
King...<eos> It's Hamilton.<eos> Mayor Hamilton's responsible for the chaplain being killed?<eos> "A new threat in Clearwater." That's what Rudd said.<eos> He did, but...
Are you saying you don't have feelings for me?<eos> I'm saying that what we have now is good.<eos> With us, with the kids.<eos> I-If it doesn't work...<eos> But if it does...
Right. Right.<eos> Let's get going, see what else is on these files.<eos> Well, actually, I think I'm gonna stick around, see what I can learn.<eos> Uh, okay.<eos> You do that.
I took the dog to ask her what to do.<eos> The vet said, "Listen, I think there's something you should seriously consider."<eos> I was like, "Please be saying to kill this dog.<eos> Please be a doctor that says the dog dies now."<eos> But she didn't.
- Then, stop being so bloody selfish.<eos> What?<eos> No walls, no bars, open spaces.<eos> If moving to Barnhurst for a spell improves her chances of getting over the cancer, then what are you complaining about?<eos> Course you do. We all do.
Morning, Aunt Chels!<eos> Well, hello, Nia.<eos> Hello, sweetheart.<eos> How'd you sleep?<eos> - You still doing okay on the couch? - Of course.
- Don't see any reason to.<eos> This isn't working.<eos> Every time I close my eyes, I see Nia's face saying she doesn't believe me.<eos> Why do you care what she thinks?<eos> - I don't.
No, you can't.<eos> You have to go talk to Booker.<eos> He had another vision.<eos> Levi... you don't really believe that, do you?<eos> Yeah. I do.
So, uh, what are we doing? Are we just--<eos> Do you not see the phone to my ear?<eos> I-<eos> - I do, but-- What?
The CSDS are here?<eos> Yeah, Governor's going hard on the drug problem.<eos> There's gonna be a dog at the entrance for the rest of the week. Huh.<eos> What, she didn't tell you?<eos> Yeah. Yeah, no. No, of course she did.
- Getting there.<eos> She is going to tear those women to shreds, piece by piece, and I feel sick about it.<eos> Well, I did try to warn you.<eos> She would have become Top Dog no matter what I did.<eos> Then do something about it.
'Member?<eos> Your first week here?<eos> I pointed to that sign and I said,<eos> "If you do like I ask, one day, you'll have all Hollywood in your hands."<eos> And now you do.
Miner.<eos> I was just looking for you.<eos> You know this man?<eos> He stole a struck from us.<eos> No, I don't.
And I gave you... everything.<eos> Just take the money.<eos> The money's not the point!<eos> Don't you have any feelings at all?<eos> Of course I do.
If he likes you?<eos> ! Of course he likes you!<eos> Who doesn't like you?<eos> Do you think so?<eos> Yes, I do.
Why didn't you ever tell me anything?<eos> I thought you might not be so interested in a married woman.<eos> And you were kind.<eos> And I needed a friend.<eos> I still do.
We won't know that for years and years.<eos> Really?<eos> How can we know what will last until the end?<eos> I love you, Monroe.<eos> Everybody does.
- Adoption?<eos> - No.<eos> I mean... not "no".<eos> Know that you have options?<eos> Because you do.
Say we knew he had taken something, hypothetically.<eos> What would that mean?<eos> Look, there's no point talking what ifs.<eos> If Tyler took something outside of our program, we knew nothing about it.<eos> Well, maybe his family does.
Oh, you wanna search me or something? Okay, Okay.<eos> Just please, don't go back to Flynn.<eos> I'll do whatever I want, alright?<eos> Patient records from the ED indicate the doctor who treated Cindi asked them if they still had some of what she took.<eos> Neither did.
- Yeah, I guess we did.<eos> Did he ever confide in you about his money problems?<eos> Well, he'd whinge I wasn't making him enough, but all my clients do that.<eos> Were you aware he asked Oliver Pittman to orchestrate a spot bet?<eos> No, I didn't.
And you were also aware that at least two of your clients were involved in a very large illegal betting syndicate.<eos> No.<eos> For the past two or three years, were you telling Clay and Nate what to bet on?<eos> No. Did you know that the morning Clay died, he was about to tell us who runs that syndicate?<eos> No, I didn't.
Could never nail him.<eos> We're talking about very hard people.<eos> And I can help you with them if you just please give me some names.<eos> Did you know that the morning Clay died, he was about to tell us who runs that syndicate?<eos> No, I didn't.
We don't want to reveal that we've been watching him.<eos> Or that we know about the warehouse.<eos> I'll traffic stop him for a broken tail-light then arrest him for the gun.<eos> - Does he have a broken tail-light?<eos> Now he does.
Are we still on for tonight?<eos> Well, I think we should stick to what we had planned.<eos> There's not much we can do here.<eos> I can text if anything happens.<eos> And even if it doesn't.
We also want our stuff back.<eos> - I can't do that.<eos> - And I can't go back to my people empty-handed again.<eos> What do you propose?<eos> How you doing?
You're not like me.<eos> I'm your brother.<eos> You were my brother.<eos> Did you all see what I saw?<eos> [all] We did.
Or maybe you'd like to prove to us that you don't have any bite marks anywhere.<eos> You are getting way ahead of yourselves.<eos> If you tested his DNA without a warrant, that is an unlawful search.<eos> You didn't have permission...<eos> We did, actually.
- Nah, it's superficial.<eos> You really had no plan out there?<eos> I still had time.<eos> They hadn't cocked their guns yet.<eos> Why? Did you?
I'd say less than an hour.<eos> Calamity Jane, you minx.<eos> I almost sent you to Hell, cat.<eos> Nedley forget about you?<eos> Maybe he didn't.
Everything where you did love me or everything where you didn't love me,<eos> I mean, who rushes on a train to tell someone they don't love them?<eos> You do love me.<eos> Yes.<eos> I do.
You were doing it.<eos> Again?<eos> What kind of dream was it?<eos> I don't remember my dreams.<eos> - You don't?
- I want you to say you make promises you can't keep.<eos> And by the way, you wouldn't have sent that Rachel woman back to me if you didn't know - what I do is worth it.<eos> - Okay, first of all, I never sent anyone back to you.<eos> And second, whatever job you think you're suited for doesn't exist in my firm.<eos> - It does at Baker Simms and Walker Stein.
I need your help, Gramm.<eos> It's messed up.<eos> The wrong guy's in that tube.<eos> Don't go there, Drew.<eos> It doesn't do any good.
And done without my advice - or my authorization.<eos> - Sometimes, it's better to ask for forgiveness than permission.<eos> You taught me that, sir.<eos> It's only better if you get results.<eos> And we did.
You want to run that by me again?<eos> I just ran it by you.<eos> What you are doing is a mistake.<eos> I don't think so, and Donna doesn't think so, which means...<eos> Actually, Harvey, I do.
You're fired.<eos> Please, I-I really was going to do it. I...<eos> I believe you.<eos> But my rule is three strikes and you're out. Otherwise, where does it end?<eos> In that case, why not do this publicly?
And that is why you will fail!<eos> [all] I believe there is safety in numbers.<eos> I am Groot!<eos> Who wants a stupid Belief weapon anyway?<eos> We do.
I don't have time for this.<eos> Don't know where he's going, but it better be super-important.<eos> Hey! Let go, Dey!<eos> We ain't got the helmet no more!<eos> [Quill] Not that we ever did.
Susie!<eos> [both laughing] - Oh, my God!<eos> - You have a freaking baby!<eos> Hey, um, I don't know if you notice, but I...<eos> I did.
How long did you wait to go over there after I explicitly told you not to?<eos> Well, you know what?<eos> It doesn't matter, because now your job is to blow that woman out of the water.<eos> Well, that's gonna be pretty hard, since she has a room full of witnesses and she also has Donna on record saying what you did was wrong and that's why you lost dominion over the associates.<eos> Whoa, Donna did what?
And this is not your fault.<eos> You were such a good husband to me.<eos> I never thought that I would have a normal life, and I did.<eos> - Cora...<eos> - I really did.
You were right to push him.<eos> You've been great with him lately.<eos> He's been needing you much more than me, which has been hard for me, but, clearly, really good for him.<eos> You know, I knew about Julia.<eos> Yeah, we both did.
Exactly... like that.<eos> I think.<eos> How do you currently pick out your clothes?<eos> I don't.<eos> My mom does.
Oh, yeah.<eos> Henry Miller, am I right?<eos> Oh, yeah! "Tropic of Cancer," so good.<eos> You know, it's not like I don't have fantasies.<eos> I do.
- Oh, yeah, my uncle was in jail, so...<eos> - Oh, gotcha.<eos> So I just pull this out whenever I need to think.<eos> You got something on your mind?<eos> As a matter of fact, I do.
- Because I gotta run and pick up some more avocadoes.<eos> I'm making my famous ugga-wugga-mole.<eos> Why am I making my famous guacamole, you wonder?<eos> - Are you talking to me? - Yeah. - I don't care.<eos> - Yeah, yeah, you do.
Do people become tougher if they have sex?<eos> I guess some people get tougher.<eos> Yes or no.<eos> Do people get tougher or not?<eos> No, they don't.
I guess so...<eos> Novel.<eos> Yes?<eos> You like the little girl type?<eos> No, I don't.
Simply put, it is my mission.<eos> Really?<eos> I didn't think people had a mission.<eos> I don't think everyone has one.<eos> But, like me and yourself, Nanaka, some humans do.
Oh, um... I'm... I swear I'm just like a little...<eos> Completely nervous.<eos> It's just my other school is not this nice.<eos> You guys don't have a yoga room or bio-sustainable duck pond?<eos> No. No, we don't.
No, that is super nerdy.<eos> Yeah, well, nerdy's good.<eos> Nerds get full scholarships.<eos> You want to go there, right?<eos> Um... Yeah, you do.
I am walking out the door now.<eos> Watch me so you can see how that's done.<eos> [Tango music] Who has other ideas for how Von Weber can pay it forward?<eos> Yes Simone.<eos> My plastic surgeon does a one for one program.
We understand. But we are not going to entertain the option of killing people.<eos> We? What?<eos> Do you got a mouse in your pocket there, Milch?<eos> - Mr. Norris has a point.<eos> - Absolutely he does.
West Brook High.<eos> Were you in my class? - Oh, I was in the year above you.<eos> We didn't hang out or anything, but I knew who you were.<eos> - You did?<eos> - Sure, everybody did.
I'm just gonna show you.<eos> You'll see.<eos> So, how did y'all get into ghosts?<eos> Did one of you see one?<eos> Yeah, I did.
Now look at me.<eos> Both... both of you.<eos> - I think I know what you want.<eos> - No, you don't.<eos> - Yeah, I do.
No, no, no.<eos> The place I'm gonna take you gentlemen...<eos> Listen to me now... it's downright naughty.<eos> Whoo! We know what you're talkin' about.<eos> No, you don't, Dave.
When he... hurts me.<eos> I like it.<eos> No.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> Yes, I do.
There you go. Call.<eos> But without you minding her, your lady friend stays here strapped to a board in a drug-induced coma.<eos> They warned me about you.<eos> My dumb ass didn't believe the stories.<eos> Nobody does.
What do you love to do?<eos> I like to make funny YouTube videos.<eos> Oh, if you like making YouTube videos, why aren't you looking for corporate video work?<eos> Corporate?<eos> Yeah, I don't do corporate.
You remember Miles, don't you?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah.<eos> No.<eos> No, you don't.
Yeah.<eos> Yeah.<eos> No.<eos> No, you don't.<eos> No, he doesn't.
We'll motorcade to the Cathedral.<eos> The back way.<eos> And then we'll bury him, and we put an end to all this.<eos> I don't give a damn anymore.<eos> I don't.
President Whitmore, thank god you're okay.<eos> It's been a while.<eos> I had 20 years to get us ready.<eos> And we never had a chance.<eos> We didn't last time, either.
Hand over the child.<eos> She doesn't want her.<eos> Ask her. Ask her, right now. Do you?<eos> Do you?<eos> I do.
What if it's not what the American does that makes him heroic, it's what he doesn't do?<eos> He falls for Rose, but he doesn't try to come between her and Johnnie.<eos> Self-sacrifice, that's noble.<eos> - Only if he stands a chance.<eos> - Maybe he does.
The gods must be punishing me, don't you see?<eos> This is what I get for giving in to my disgusting urges.<eos> I'm such a whore.<eos> Sweet bun, I must admit I too sometimes have urges... impure thoughts.<eos> We all do.
Then I did the same thing as...<eos> They killed Carl.<eos> Those fuckers.<eos> Did he suffer?<eos> No... Oh, yeah, yeah, he did.
Fuck, yeah, he did.<eos> And it's dope.<eos> This guy's smart. I mean like, fuck-a-guy smart.<eos> Know what I'm saying?<eos> Yeah, you do.
I don't think so.<eos> You don't think those bastards at Harper's and MacMillan aren't pouring poison in his ear already?<eos> Tom won't listen.<eos> You saw the dedication in time and the river.<eos> Yeah, I did.
- How was your holiday?<eos> - All right.<eos> I'll grab your bag.<eos> Did you get to see your sister in Los Angeles?<eos> Yeah, I did.
Some mate you are.<eos> - I know Strummer.<eos> - Sure you do, mate.<eos> We all do.<eos> - No, I really do.
Of course she won't.<eos> No.<eos> I mean, she's so desperate, the other day she went uptown, she was trying to buy this baby seal fat from this random woman.<eos> What, you think that's funny?<eos> No, I don't.
I wished they would have done that 10 minutes ago.<eos> Huh.<eos> You know you want to search their boat.<eos> What?<eos> No, I don't.
Defender of our homes and liberty.<eos> Bravery, humility, and honesty.<eos> You must have grown up singing this song in school.<eos> Yeah.<eos> - Yes, we did.
Perhaps we were both wrong.<eos> We are more similar than I thought.<eos> Thank you General.<eos> - Are you sure you don't want to go back?<eos> - Of course I do.
Put your helmet on.<eos> You gonna eat them?<eos> I don't eat meat.<eos> Help yourself.<eos> Of course you don't.
- Sit down. - What's this...<eos> Shut up.<eos> Sit down in the chair.<eos> You ever see a match-grade round traveling 3,000 feet per second go through a window?<eos> Nobody does.
It was wrong.<eos> It was wrong.<eos> That's all I wanted to hear, man.<eos> - Did you hear that? - Nice.<eos> Kyle, don't.
No, it hasn't worked for 15 years.<eos> Well, maybe it's just an electrical disturbance.<eos> We are required to respond.<eos> You mind if I come in?<eos> - Yeah, yeah, I do.
Now why won't you show me?<eos> Because I don't know it!<eos> You what?<eos> I don't know it, okay?<eos> No one does.
Turn around.<eos> Take a deep breath.<eos> You all right?<eos> How are we supposed to fight the Others if we don't even know what they are?<eos> Actually, we do.
Your family loved you.<eos> Our kind believe that love is just a trick.<eos> An instinct. A way to protect your genetic future.<eos> Do you really believe that?<eos> I did.
The Italians and the Cubans keep to themselves.<eos> But the Cubans, they hate the Spaniards, and the Spaniards look at all Cubans like they're uppity coons who forgot their place since America freed them in '98.<eos> The Cubans and the Spanish, they look down on the Puerto Ricans and everyone, I mean, everyone, shits on the Dominicans.<eos> The Italians only respect you if you came off the boat.<eos> How you doing, ladies?
You profit from the illegal addictions of others.<eos> Their weakness and sloth and libidinous behavior.<eos> But you can free yourself of that.<eos> But I don't want to.<eos> Of course, you do.
What about your father?<eos> What about him?<eos> You think he knows he's sharing me with his own son?<eos> You think you're something fucking different from them other whores out there?<eos> Do you?
Okay. Absolutely.<eos> Trevor, it's his first day.<eos> Please don't make him cry.<eos> - You need anything?<eos> - I do, actually.
We'll be fine.<eos> I know who you are.<eos> What?<eos> Janet didn't send you.<eos> Elsa did.
Maybe I was an asshole? I think about it. I think maybe I...<eos> She just...<eos> You know, we just weren't a good match.<eos> Doesn't mean you walk out, though. You don't let a person wonder, even if she hated me.<eos> She didn't.
You learn quickly.<eos> That's good.<eos> Snow Vase.<eos> How do you know her?<eos> I do not.
Pour him a double.<eos> You know, at the Battle of Sichuan, I did hire out to those raiders.<eos> But only because I thought that they were doing the right thing.<eos> I know that.<eos> Always did.
Never is.<eos> Needless to say, the position of Vice Admiral is yours.<eos> No one deserves it more.<eos> Vice Admirals don't fly, do they?<eos> No, they don't.
Oh, well, we've got the pink badges!<eos> I'm sorry, we can only serve Premier Badge holders.<eos> Um, okay, are there any other restaurants?<eos> Well, there's our relaxed dining area, and there are stalls outside.<eos> The Pig in a Poke does a nice hog roast in a bun with apple sauce.
Becauseoftheinitiallaunch delays,thenewdeparture timeisin eighthours.<eos> Might as well keep my suit on.<eos> Where's the captain?<eos> Hey worsley, captain stanaforth is here. Can you come and say hi?<eos> Hey worsley, how ya doing?
You know what?<eos> I'm a ginger, but I'm a natural redhead.<eos> Not that you're ever gonna find out. Because you will never be invited into my basement.<eos> I don't wanna see your basement!<eos> Yes, you do!
Why not?<eos> Because Mom's at work and you're fresh out of prison.<eos> Okay, white-collar crime doesn't count!<eos> Yes, it does!<eos> No, it does not. It does not.
Yes. I'm all in.<eos> Dana, I quit.<eos> I'm gonna start my own business, okay?<eos> - I have my own business.<eos> - Yes, she does.
It's me.<eos> Detective Corby.<eos> I think we need to talk.<eos> Did you read a story in today's local paper about a woman who died at Harry's Rainbow Grill?<eos> Yes, I did in fact.
She was badly beaten.<eos> Knifed.<eos> She was definitely murdered.<eos> No.<eos> I didn't.
My mother never gave her speech.<eos> She never got to meet Eleanor Roosevelt.<eos> But I could.<eos> Heads, I go.<eos> Tails, I don't.
Try it.<eos> There you go.<eos> You got it, you got it right.<eos> So, Why'd you run away from home? - I...<eos> I didn't.
Okay, but whose hero?<eos> If Superman were here right now, what would you want to say to him?<eos> That my family, too, had dreams.<eos> To look him in his eye and ask him how he decides which lives count.<eos> And which ones do not.
I never wanted this world to have you.<eos> Be their hero, Clark. Be their monument. Be their angel.<eos> Or be none of it.<eos> You don't owe this world a thing.<eos> You never did.
And I realized that you might come up short, so I went to the bank and got you some cash.<eos> Here you go.<eos> That's why I came round today, to make sure you and the kids were okay.<eos> Em, come on, you didn't think I would just, like, leave you hanging, did you?<eos> You did, didn't you?
It's, "Igot the brains." You guys got the know-how.<eos> You got the noggin.<eos> You came up with this stuff, with the thumb.<eos> Come on, show me.<eos> How do you do that?
You afraid of heights?<eos> A little.<eos> I'm uncomfortable in tight spaces.<eos> So don't look down.<eos> Or do.
- So you made him choose.<eos> - Of course.<eos> And Whitmore lost his man.<eos> No.<eos> No, I did.
Did you train him to do this?<eos> Yes.<eos> I have no idea how he learned this.<eos> - Did that just happen?<eos> - Yeah, it did!
Just stop this, please.<eos> Last chance.<eos> I'll start it for you.<eos> When I was a little girl...<eos> - Please don't.
But, unlike you, I was able to transition upward towards actual magic.<eos> Science, you may have heard it called.<eos> So, would you like to know, my friends, just how I got you here?<eos> We know how you did it.<eos> No, you don't.
Our American friends have permitted a breach of the Statute of Secrecy that threatens to expose us all.<eos> I will not be lectured by the man who let Gellert Grindelwald slip through his fingers.<eos> Madam President, I'm sorry to interrupt, but this is critical...<eos> You better have an excellent excuse for this intrusion, Ms. Goldstein.<eos> Yes. I do.
I want to tell him everyday for the past 13 years I want it to.<eos> Me too.<eos> This is my fault.<eos> I've failed.<eos> We both did.
But they bring out this one guy...<eos> - Did he have a big dick? - Keep it classy, Amanda.<eos> - Really?<eos> - What?<eos> Did he?
Sometimes a car will come in light with one pair of plates. Hour later, goes out heavy with another pair of plates.<eos> Ain't that weird?<eos> We all got our secrets.<eos> I ain't no hypocrite.<eos> You do what you do, i do what I do.
When you finish recording, you may hang up--<eos> Rosie?<eos> Troy!<eos> You didn't happen to see, uh, Rosie come by here in last hour or so, did you?<eos> Yeah, as a matter of fact, I did.
Look, look, I'll call you later. I promise, okay?<eos> Look at that.<eos> Yeah, she friended him right before he died.<eos> There's something else.<eos> - Jesus, Kobe, I don't...
This is my brother, Scott.<eos> Hello, Scott.<eos> Welcome to the School for the Gifted.<eos> Yeah. It doesn't exactly feel like a gift.<eos> It never does, at first.
You wanted me to get out of the house more, right?<eos> I can't stop you.<eos> Nobody can.<eos> But trust me, this won't end well.<eos> Nothing does with him.
You have me.<eos> You have Charles.<eos> You have more family than you know.<eos> You never had the chance to save your family before.<eos> But you do now.
These crates are supposed to contain weapons belonging to the United States Army.<eos> In fact, you sold them to insurgents.<eos> And these are now empty.<eos> Do you know who I am, Major?<eos> Yes, General. I do.
Look, it says I'm a "danger to society."<eos> "A deluded, washed-up charlatan "who never had a hit in his career."<eos> Oh, come on, you don't believe all that?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I do.
And, Leo, that is disgusting. Well, John, I've covered many disasters for this network, but this is sure to... Oh, they're about to start.<eos> Okay, guys, listen up! Look, I gotta tell you, um, there's not much of an audience out there tonight.<eos> But you know what?<eos> It doesn't matter.<eos> It really doesn't.
I told her no way, not after what you did in court.<eos> It's just normal craziness at the end of a trial.<eos> Don't worry about it.<eos> I accused her of killing her husband, did she mention that?<eos> Yes, she did.
Okay, that's great.<eos> We'll look for another explanation then. You and I can work on finding that together.<eos> I want to help you, James.<eos> But you have to want it too.<eos> - I do.
Those yankees came back again this morning.<eos> - Who?<eos> - The ones trying to buy the farm.<eos> - I thought you told them no.<eos> - I did.
Watcher, Player, Prisoner.<eos> I'm trapped.<eos> The only way out is to win.<eos> - So, you have to win.<eos> No, you do. - What?
Set the timer, Sam.<eos> Long enough to dance with death, not so long as to marry her.<eos> He had an antidote.<eos> - Would that even work?<eos> If done in time.
Yeah, it looked all right.<eos> It's a bit shit.<eos> That supposed to look like they're jumping in or something?<eos> Yeah.<eos> It doesn't.
You know I put a lot more into it.<eos> What was that place worth before I came along?<eos> A twentieth of the money I sank into it.<eos> - I didn't find any...<eos> - Of course you didn't.
What flask?<eos> I don't have a flask.<eos> - Yes, you do.<eos> No, I don't.<eos> - Yes, you do.
Nice rig.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I pulled you over because your back left taillight is out.<eos> Did you know that?<eos> No, I didn't.
Yeah, well, when you put it like that... But he didn't exactly say I couldn't come. And, I don't know, things have been going pretty good lately.<eos> Do you ever wonder why people kiss with their lips?<eos> I mean, why not rub ears like, "I want to hear you."<eos> Or wrists, like this.<eos> Hey, you did way too many threes!
- Let me explain!<eos> -What's to explain?<eos> I have eyes, James.<eos> You're an addict. You lied to me!<eos> No, I didn't!
This is what you do. You're not doing this to me. You brought this on yourself, Rachel.<eos> If you had just stayed away that one night... Just left us all alone.<eos> You brought this on Megan.<eos> In a way, you killed her.<eos> But I didn't. You did.
Driving up here like a happy donkey you two laughing at the dunce?<eos> Why didn't you say anything?<eos> Why didn't you?<eos> Why didn't you tell me to piss off?<eos> Why didn't you?
What's this?<eos> Glad you're putting it to use.<eos> - Well, I'm trying.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - So how we doing?
- Well, you know, ever since I've known you, you'll do anything to avoid being unpopular, whether it's what time she went to bed or whether she should study for exams, or how much pocket money she should have got, you know.<eos> I've always been the one that paid the price for you being spineless.<eos> Right.<eos> - Sir.<eos> - Hey, Tosh, how you doing?
- Who said anything about driving?<eos> I just assumed.<eos> It's too far to walk.<eos> So you didn't go to St Ninian's beach?<eos> No, I didn't.
Mommy was hurting me.<eos> No, no.<eos> Mommy's just not herself right now.<eos> But she loves you very much.<eos> And so do I.
Do you mind sleeping in the guest room?<eos> No.<eos> You're sleeping with me.<eos> Did you see Richard with Hélène?<eos> I did.
Stop, stop, stop!<eos> Catch... I think.<eos> You think?<eos> It's behind the other two rings, and I can barely see it, but I heard something latch, did you hear it?<eos> No, I didn't.
Stay right there<eos> Weren't you supposed to look after him?<eos> Where were you?<eos> John heard Mantosh is out on the boats.<eos> Doing a lobster run.
It's just...<eos> I mean look at Sammy.<eos> He's been hammered since 10:00 am. He's doing it right.<eos> Hey, Sammy!<eos> Hi, buddy, how you doing?
How could I miss it?<eos> I used to park right here.<eos> What's going on?<eos> I remember those good-night kisses.<eos> Oh, you do, huh?
Wait till you meet him.<eos> He's so... I adore Merry.<eos> I think she's very special.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - We all do.
All right.<eos> Stop it.<eos> Stop, stop, stop.<eos> All right.<eos> Don't.
Okay, but just to clarify, I did not hack.<eos> I showed that it could be hacked.<eos> You told me to find a patch.<eos> Do you have that in writing?<eos> -Yes, I do.
Not who, what.<eos> We're targeting bad guys' cell phones. Sometimes a SIM card.<eos> Okay.<eos> And how do we know the bad guy is in possession of the bad cell phone? We don't.<eos> - Of course we do.
You could've joined one of those gangs, but you didn't because you wanted to help.<eos> You wanted to help.<eos> You want a second chance, right?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I do.
Well, it matters because... if you're going to give up your dream.<eos> I think it matters... that you like what you're playing on the road for years.<eos> Do you like the music that I play?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I do.
Well, the party's changing.<eos> This younger generation's not gonna fall on their sword for segregation.<eos> You think every Southerner is gonna start dancing to your tune?<eos> Wallace almost won Maryland.<eos> - But he didn't.
No, I wouldn't.<eos> Time you woke up, Sherlock.<eos> I'm a story-teller, I know when I'm in one.<eos> Of course.<eos> Of course you do, John.
Because you ran away...<eos> Goddamn it!<eos> Shit!<eos> You messed me up, real good!<eos> Please don't...
If so, did you haunt me last night?<eos> - Vodka.<eos> Makes letting them go harder.<eos> - I never got a text, so I guess you never saw me.<eos> - I did.
- All right, Alan, can you tell us exactly what happened?<eos> I'll do my best to tell you as much as I know with as much detail as I can.<eos> My gurney was situated outside the O.R. Where they worked on him.<eos> -So you saw him come in?<eos> - No, I didn't.
What I'm trying to say is I... I know what it feels like to lose a child.<eos> Just like the heelshires.<eos> And that ties me to them. And to brahms. And to this place.<eos> Does that make any sense to you?<eos> Yeah. Yeah, it does.
Does the bank care about your hard life?<eos> - No.<eos> - No.<eos> Do they care about your low income?<eos> - No. - No, they don't!
- No.<eos> - No.<eos> Do they care about your low income?<eos> - No. - No, they don't!<eos> No, they don't!
No.<eos> Do... do they care about your low income?<eos> No.<eos> No.<eos> They don't.
Mommy says Huntington's a gift from God.<eos> The pain reminds us how precious life is.<eos> Your granny said the same thing to your mom when she was your age.<eos> Did Granny die of Huntington's?<eos> Yeah, she did.
- I did, you know.<eos> - No, you didn't.<eos> - Yes, I did, Dorottya.<eos> - No, you did not.<eos> - I did.
- For the award thingy.<eos> You're not serious.<eos> I've never been more serious in my life.<eos> You know, Milly, I've always wanted to say that line.<eos> And in my entire career I never once did.
That... That's his company phone?<eos> Isn't that crossing the wall?<eos> Well, technically there's nothing criminal here.<eos> So Remson doesn't have a policy prohibiting... this kind of romantic relationship between two employees?<eos> Some banks do, but nope.
Do you understand what's happening here?<eos> Cachet can sue you.<eos> No, they said they would take care of that.<eos> Who?<eos> Who did?
Even if that price is our souls?<eos> That won't happen.<eos> We won't let that happen.<eos> We have to trust in this.<eos> In this I do.
There were a lot of drugs.<eos> Oh, we've heard.<eos> A lot of foreplay, too?<eos> No. She didn't want a lot of that.<eos> She didn't. Okay.
Andrea.<eos> Tragic death.<eos> Nice girl by all accounts.<eos> I mean, she had her personal problems, but who doesn't?<eos> You do.
Yeah, Jackson's still alone.<eos> Keep me updated.<eos> Derohan should be there soon to relieve you.<eos> You really think all that money's in there?<eos> Yeah, I really do.
- I don't want to!<eos> - I don't care!<eos> I'm not gonna ask you again.<eos> - Look, I know this is a big night for you. - I don't care!<eos> - Yes, you do!
Not enough fuel!<eos> We die for sure.<eos> That's your problem, not mine.<eos> How do you know what's waiting at those coordinates?<eos> - I don't.
Hey, thanks for the assist.<eos> Now who the hell are you?<eos> Anybody else know you were coming here? No.<eos> No, I don't think so.<eos> They do now.
- Hi, sweetie.<eos> All right?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Did you buy sushi?<eos> - Of course I did.
Thanks. How you doing?<eos> Good.<eos> How's things going, all right?<eos> Yeah. You see the game?<eos> Yeah, I did.
Uh, that's okay.<eos> And you are...<eos> Um, Lee.<eos> ♪ Everything's goin' my way ♪ How you doing?<eos> How you doing?
Oh, goddammit, where did I park the car?<eos> Yeah, I don't know, but I wish you'd figure it out 'cause I'm freezing my ass off.<eos> You don't have a normal winter coat?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, I do.
Amen. Amen.<eos> You can say amen, Patrick.<eos> Nobody's trying to recruit you.<eos> I did say amen.<eos> Oh, you did? Okay.
But he didn't do this.<eos> Of course he didn't.<eos> I... will call you.<eos> I told you not to talk to anybody.<eos> I didn't, only to my parents.
I said anybody.<eos> While you were talking to them, you know who was listening in, which he can do legally, just not with me and you?<eos> Box.<eos> I... I didn't say anything.<eos> Sure you did.
You know, I don't believe you.<eos> I don't believe you ever really cared about their pain.<eos> Do you care?<eos> Do you really care about my pain?<eos> Of course, I do!
I can't tell you what it does to me. You have deserved this for a long time.<eos> You're totally right, i deserve this.<eos> I deserve this.<eos> I deserve this, please do it.<eos> Please do it. Just do it! Please...
I said that because I want you and Little Sam to be safe.<eos> That's all I want-- to become a maester so I can help Jon when the time comes so you'll be safe.<eos> Us and everyone else in the world.<eos> I don't care about them.<eos> Well, no, I do, but I don't really.
He was not on her list anymore.<eos> She had taken him off it.<eos> Why?<eos> Didn't she want him dead any longer?<eos> She did and she did not.
And my father didn't leave me as much money as everybody thinks, so I couldn't pay you more than a hundred and fifty.<eos> -A month?<eos> -A week.<eos> I'm not destitute.<eos> A few pointers as to how Madam Florence does things.
I think it's gone.<eos> It hasn't been baptised.<eos> I should've baptised it myself.<eos> You don't have to be a priest to christen a baby, did you know that?<eos> No. I didn't.
Bellmont it is.<eos> Attention!<eos> Who did you say lives here?<eos> Do I have the honor of addressing the Duke of Sandringham?<eos> You do, indeed.
If I knew, I would.<eos> It's good to see some familiar faces.<eos> I was sorry to hear about Angus' death.<eos> I always thought when that wee bastard fell, that you would fall with him.<eos> So did I.
Who do you think this guy was trying to call?<eos> Ghostbusters.<eos> He can laugh. You can't.<eos> Hey, Bailey.<eos> How you doing?
Really?<eos> Maybe at MG's, after a shift.<eos> Still can't believe that place went out of business.<eos> I miss Copeland's.<eos> Who doesn't?
No.<eos> You saw how quickly Mariah sent that lawyer and got me out of there.<eos> You didn't wanna talk to me before.<eos> What makes you trust me now?<eos> Because Luke Cage does.
That's not what I meant. I...<eos> No, it's fine.<eos> It's just... you know.<eos> You know Kim and Kanye?<eos> No. No, I don't.
- No. Just you.<eos> And you never once bought her a cup in return.<eos> Hello.<eos> I have a wife.<eos> - Not anymore you don't.
- whose birthday it is today.<eos> - Happy birthday.<eos> - This is Claire Maddox... - I'd forgotten.<eos> Claire remembered.<eos> She always does.
Who?<eos> The Prime Minister's office. Duby.<eos> I don't want to upset them.<eos> He'll know I was here.<eos> I don't...
You came here because you know it's time to come in.<eos> Your father created the program.<eos> Didn't have what it takes to make it work.<eos> And you did.<eos> You always did.
Roommates came and went.<eos> Class schedules changed... and I got closer every day towards graduating.<eos> They say, for some, college is the time of your life... where you find yourself.<eos> And for others...<eos> Hey, how you doing?
Hold it there.<eos> You behave.<eos> Upstairs.<eos> Hi, Will.<eos> How you doing?
Look, I'm sorry. But it's not negotiable.<eos> Thanks the vow of confidence, Tim.<eos> Anna, wait.<eos> I take it you know your patient Frank Henderson died last night.<eos> No, I didn't.
What about last night?<eos> What about it?<eos> Did you see Chloe last night?<eos> Jesus, Adam?<eos> No... I didn't.
I wanted to know about Gillian.<eos> Why would you ask about that?<eos> You know what happened.<eos> - No. No, I don't know.<eos> Yes, you do!
I think she was selling for someone.<eos> It would help us if you answered the question, Miss Macy.<eos> How did you know it was ecstasy?<eos> Doctor.<eos> I didn't.
Sack her, 'cause she's a lying bitch.<eos> It's her you should be investigating.<eos> Look, I want to have a talk to your boss.<eos> Don't have a boss.<eos> Yeah, you do.
Renae ...<eos> It's Chloe's funeral today.<eos> Roy should have stood by you, all those years ago, that's the truth of the matter.<eos> He had his faults.<eos> We all do.
What is that about?<eos> Smug is his default emotion anytime I'm not in the room.<eos> This probably has something to do with last night.<eos> I thought we had fun.<eos> We did! Well, you did.
Well, thank you for that, but you know, to be honest,<eos> I mean, sure, you're okay for someone outside of my age demographic.<eos> No, I know you had an awesome time.<eos> - No, no, I did not.<eos> - Yes, you did.
Father disagreed with the Prophet on Thor Gundersen.<eos> Got him cast out. And us with him.<eos> I know.<eos> So, where'd you say you're headed?<eos> I didn't.
Loves old movies.<eos> And she doesn't know anything about The Sox.<eos> Anybody can learn about baseball.<eos> Do you like her?<eos> - Yeah, I do.
I went to get the knife and I stood over you.<eos> I was going to cut you.<eos> I wanted to do it.<eos> He told me how good it would feel.<eos> Who did?
- Teenagers. - Hot rodders and hooligans.<eos> Juvenile delinquents in blue jeans.<eos> And then there's the service.<eos> It takes forever and a day for your food to arrive.<eos> - And when it finally does...
Kato, you like them burgers, huh?<eos> Oh, I love them.<eos> You told the cops you and I went out for burgers last night, right?<eos> Hmm? Yeah.<eos> You did, huh?
Which, of course, became a problem after they broke up, because O.J. knew that she needed it all the time.<eos> And it absolutely drove him crazy.<eos> You know, when she was at that little house on Gretna Green, he used to hide in the bushes and watch her have sex with other guys.<eos> Did she know that O.J. was out there?<eos> Of course she did!
Oh, let me rephrase.<eos> Other than the two victims, did this incredibly precise DNA matching show anyone else's blood and DNA at the scene of the murders?<eos> It did, uh, just one individual.<eos> And does this same DNA match the blood you found - on the back gate at Bundy?<eos> - Yes, it does.
I know there's business on your mind.<eos> And I know there always will be. - Yeah.<eos> - Look.<eos> I am sorry they wore their uniforms.<eos> Yeah, they fucking did, eh?
And I know there always will be. - Yeah.<eos> - Look.<eos> I am sorry they wore their uniforms.<eos> Yeah, they fucking did, eh?<eos> They fucking did.
- Do not use me for your lies.<eos> - Those men respect you.<eos> They respect me because they know who I am.<eos> - They know I am loyal.<eos> - As do I.
I will always love my brother.<eos> His soul is pure and perfect.<eos> His sins don't erase that purity, they only obscure it.<eos> He just needs... to atone for them.<eos> We all do.
If you're here to stop me, save your breath.<eos> I have to do this.<eos> What you're doing is treason.<eos> If you have a better idea, I'm all points.<eos> - We do.
You know, and what's the point?<eos> Now that I know what my grandfather did in the name of our kind?<eos> Maybe you were right about the Elves.<eos> Maybe we don't deserve saving.<eos> Yeah, maybe none of us do.
What the fuck !<eos> Follow me and we'll try it out.<eos> It's 30 degrees, why do I need the coat ?<eos> Do you trust me ?<eos> No, I don't.
- In favor.<eos> And the representative for the Minister of Finance?<eos> In favor.<eos> You don't want a casino?<eos> No, we don't.
We're staying in the city, at the theatre.<eos> I have other news that might be heavy for you.<eos> Your brother, King Christian, surrendered Denmark at 05:00 this morning.<eos> If it helps, he did not have much choice.<eos> No, he probably didn't.
Yeah.<eos> What was that?<eos> What was what?<eos> You hear that, that chirping sound?<eos> I did not, no.
Yeah sure, I was.<eos> We can go if you wanted to.<eos> Or not.<eos> It's just a dumb dance.<eos> I do.
We're going to win this thing!<eos> No, you won't.<eos> What's it to you, Eugene?<eos> Yeah, what do you care who wins?<eos> I don't.
- Why are they needed, sir?<eos> I bought a cursed sapphire into this house, Mary.<eos> And now I'm paying for it.<eos> And I don't know what to expect.<eos> But neither do my enemies.
- Meaning?<eos> I entrusted him to God.<eos> - I don't understand!<eos> Don't you believe in Providence?<eos> I do.
He was using supercooled liquid helium.<eos> It's one of the most effective substances in the world for rapid temperature reduction.<eos> This liquid helium, where do you get it?<eos> - Why do you need it?<eos> - He doesn't, dummy.
But it's been more than 24 hours since he's made contact.<eos> Perhaps that's because Jim Gordon still breathes.<eos> But if the police catch him first, how do we explain...<eos> Something that cannot be explained?<eos> We don't.
- Oh, boy.<eos> All right, listen. The case may not be quite as urgent as once thought.<eos> I dug it up out of my desk so you'd have something to do on weekends because you seemed so lonely.<eos> - You cited chatter from the streets that Garibaldi had resurfaced.<eos> - I did. I did. I did.
Instead of you approaching Maura, we're gonna get her to come to you.<eos> Yeah, try and spread the word that you've got a connect on the outside that gives you access to contrabands: cigarettes, burner phones...<eos> Pornography.<eos> Amy, women don't watch...<eos> - They do.
- Is there something wrong with my face?<eos> Just tell me. Just tell me, it's fine.<eos> No, Clark, we just scored the Zeppelin deal.<eos> Richie did.<eos> Richie did, okay?
Then I get word this little asshole's in the hospital.<eos> In the fucking hospital.<eos> Not for nothing, but he does have pretty bad asthma.<eos> What's that?<eos> Asthma. They all do.
Until recently, I thought that was me as well, but now...<eos> I don't know that it is anymore.<eos> It is natural for men new to power to assume that it has no limits.<eos> Trust me.<eos> It does.
I know it's confusing.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I can... i can help you get over that.<eos> I don't want to get over that.<eos> Yes, you do.
You can fill it out at home.<eos> Your secretary said on the phone That there would be no charge for the initial consultation.<eos> Well, she was mistaken.<eos> What if i hadn't brought my checkbook?<eos> Lucky for me you did.
Really?<eos> Did you not find any?<eos> Black bands?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I did.
- Let's go, Rosalie.<eos> - Yes, Walter.<eos> Jim?<eos> Do you realize it takes thousands of years to create an aquifer and that more than half of the world's aquifers are in danger?<eos> - No, I didn't. - Yeah.
So don't say anything to anyone, okay?<eos> Of course not.<eos> I'm very discreet.<eos> Like, you don't know where I live, right?<eos> Yeah, I do.
What is it?<eos> What's the matter?<eos> He doesn't love me any more.<eos> He loves Julie Karagina.<eos> No, he doesn't.
"She really thinks she's something."<eos> Now, who would write such a thing?<eos> I don't know. I'm not sure.<eos> Does it say who wrote it?<eos> Why, yes, it does.
Thank you for being such a caring friend and for doing such a good job raising my husband.<eos> To Divya.<eos> Do you remember me on the day we first met?<eos> It was right over there.<eos> Of course I do.
So, why did you do it?<eos> Why does Jonathan Pine, respected hotelier, risk his career by snitching on his guests?<eos> First in Cairo and then here.<eos> I don't know.<eos> Yes, you do.
Thank you, Arlene.<eos> I need to talk to you about Ann Rutledge.<eos> Do you have any idea... how much danger you're in?<eos> So you believe me?<eos> Yes, I do.
It's because you're a great guy.<eos> Thanks, man.<eos> And they probably wanna fuck the shit out of you.<eos> Hey, I didn't say it.<eos> You did.
- Get up.<eos> Do you have my shit?<eos> - Do you have my shit? - No.<eos> No. No?<eos> Well, someone does.
Yes,<eos> I belong to the brotherhood of Freemasons.<eos> I'm afraid my way of thinking is very different from yours.<eos> I don't believe in God.<eos> Of course you don't.
Did he say so?<eos> But how could he look at me as he did and not mean it?<eos> And you?<eos> Do you love him?<eos> I do.
I wish!<eos> Do you?<eos> Do you really?<eos> Of course, I love Andrei.<eos> Of course, I do.
Natasha.<eos> I love you.<eos> You can't love me.<eos> I love you more.<eos> Better than I did before.
But...<eos> Do you think you could love me?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, I could.<eos> Yes, I do.
Slightly nicer than the last wedding we went to.<eos> Sarah and Jeb's, August 23, 2001.<eos> It was by a lake, and I remember that you teared up during their vows.<eos> Pollen count was off the charts up there.<eos> Hey, how you doing?
What?<eos> $790,000 missing from the charity's accounts.<eos> I had... I had no idea.<eos> Do you think Noonan knew about that?<eos> - Because Laura did.
Maybe you needed better teachers.<eos> That could be.<eos> Can I do the drill now?<eos> - You promised.<eos> I did, didn't I?
My brother was gonna take care of me.<eos> And in the dead of night, he went through my Mesa Verde files.<eos> Uh, you know what? We don't have to listen to this.<eos> She does!<eos> You do... for your own good.
It's wearing me down!<eos> It's wearing down my faculties!<eos> My brain... my mind... it used to be...<eos> You know, it used to work!<eos> And now it doesn't anymore.
Two flats means you take every second letter, beginning at the start of the section.<eos> Three sharps means you take every third letter, beginning at the end.<eos> Does it make sense?<eos> Aye.<eos> Aye, it does.
And you will be hung as one if they catch you.<eos> We can't stay.<eos> We know what will happen if the Jacobites lose the war.<eos> But... but what if they win?<eos> They don't.
Truer words have never been spoken.<eos> I can see that ye still bear a grudge.<eos> Let's get one thing clear, Dougal MacKenzie.<eos> If I ever thought of you, then I might hold a grudge for all the things that you've done to me.<eos> But I don't.
There's no such path marked.<eos> Marked or no, it's there.<eos> As I told Mrs. Fraser, it's a narrow, winding path, hard to spot in daylight, and hopeless to find in the dark.<eos> Unless ye ken where to look.<eos> And you do?
Hey, Mac, is God gonna be able to protect against the ship sinking?<eos> God protects all things, Charlie. He is an awesome god.<eos> The only way this ship is gonna sink is if the captain's drunk.<eos> Guys, we don't have to worry about drunk captains, 'cause this is the dry cruise, remember?<eos> Yeah. Yeah, I do.
Why? Well, because I'm the most responsible person.<eos> Uh, guys, guys, I-I don't think any of us should have a gun.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Well, one of us does, so... the end.
He is innocent.<eos> Deandra Reynolds, you were the one that told the police that Bill had spiked the punch with bath salts.<eos> That's correct.<eos> But you didn't actually see him do it, did you?<eos> No, I did not.
I will hear him.<eos> I will look in his eyes while he tells me that he can be trusted to be a partner to us.<eos> But if I for a moment doubt him...<eos> Do you trust me to make this decision?<eos> Of course I do.
Cloaks itself in whatever it must to move you to action.<eos> And the more you deny its presence, the more powerful it gets, and the more likely it is to consume you entirely without you ever even knowing it was there.<eos> Now, if you and I are to lead these men together, you must learn to know its presence well so that you may use it... Rather than it use you.<eos> You have some experience with this, I imagine, living in fear of such a thing within you?<eos> Yeah, I do.
I stand here accused of corruption, witness intimidation, brutality.<eos> I confess to doing my job.<eos> I confess to keeping this town's peace.<eos> Do you know who you are?<eos> Yeah, Miss Goodwin, I sure do.
Look, I'll think about it. What's good for you could be really hard for her.<eos> Why didn't you have your defense team contact the police?<eos> I don't trust lawyers, and I don't trust the police.<eos> I only trust you.<eos> Or at least I did once.
Or at least I did once.<eos> I'm hoping I can still do that.<eos> So the abusive ex-boyfriend we framed for murder calls you for a visit and you decide that is a good idea?<eos> Look, his hearing's coming up, and Nava doesn't even know his defense yet.<eos> Now I do.
We both know who dropped him.<eos> This is your chance to convince me you have a plan.<eos> We reinforce what Wozniak already believes... that he found his mole.<eos> You assured me that Wozniak had no way of verifying that we had an informant.<eos> He didn't.
Tell them your Beyoncé's fourth-weekend nanny and that she loves you.<eos> I don't speak French.<eos> Can I get you anything?<eos> Um... Do you guys have any tampons I could...<eos> So sorry, no, we don't.
Don't tell me you weren't angling for it.<eos> What's your ask?<eos> One solid thing for us to work with.<eos> It tanks him, you got a cushion.<eos> It doesn't?
This is Chub.<eos> My real name's Charles.<eos> Everybody calls me Chub, you know, 'cause I'm fat.<eos> I didn't know Trudy had any African-American friends.<eos> She don't.
I'm sorry. I didn't know.<eos> - Know what? Don't blame yourself.<eos> Just stop.<eos> - I thought I was being pretty interesting.<eos> - So did I.
No, she's not a movie star.<eos> I'm not shallow. I'm not seduced by cheap glamor. I value substance and character.<eos> What the hell do you think I am?<eos> I wasn't implying anything like that, I thought it might be Hedy Lamarr, I know how much she adores you.<eos> Like all your clients do.
And they did forensic tests there, and they found the carpet in that room covered in semen stains.<eos> David?<eos> Is that something that happened to you?<eos> Did you have to masturbate in front of other boys, staff?<eos> - Everyone did.
At least it is with gorillas.<eos> Not helping.<eos> I think that somebody needs one of my special stories.<eos> I don't, I don't.<eos> Yeah, you do.
He still belongs to me.<eos> - 20 million.<eos> Never.<eos> Well, then you can't have Hakeem, bitch.<eos> I already did.
And now there is none. No, no, no, no.<eos> Honey, there'll be another heir.<eos> You really think so?<eos> I do.<eos> I really do.
August 2002.<eos> In London.<eos> Now, there's a gap in Spector's time-line.<eos> We don't know where he was or what he was doing.<eos> No, we don't.
Don't call me that, okay?<eos> Look, I need $40 for HBO.<eos> Okay.<eos> Did you get that job?<eos> Yeah, I did.
So why were you there?<eos> I can't tell you that, either.<eos> Then it looks like we don't have much to talk about.<eos> You're right.<eos> We don't.
Wha...<eos> He didn't bring the money.<eos> Senator Stay Puft, rebuttal?<eos> I didn't bring it, because... because I don't have it.<eos> - Wha... Well, who does?
I hope you're not on septic. Ugh!<eos> Have you no decency, man?<eos> We said only number ones, Krieger!<eos> - I never agreed to that.<eos> - Yes, you absolutely did!
And plus, Jerkleton, I've got this.<eos> Spanish Fly.<eos> - Right?<eos> - Pam, that shit doesn't work.<eos> Yes, it does.
And more importantly, how?<eos> Okay, that's...<eos> Oh, come on. Stop it.<eos> That's just about enough of...<eos> What... Well, that does it, missy!
- Why?<eos> Uh-huh. And since apparently Archer's penis is like a crack pipe...<eos> What, in size and/or shape?<eos> They said if he has sex with Veronica, she'll fall head over heels for him.<eos> Oh, they did, did they?
And it's your right.<eos> Is that all?<eos> Yeah.<eos> My dad's the only person in the world who believes me.<eos> Your mother does too.
You're all my blood.<eos> My son.<eos> Nobody else knows.<eos> You don't belong here.<eos> Never did.
Hello, Ted.<eos> - Innocent and Brock knows it.<eos> Well, the evidence says otherwise and the sheriff has to follow up.<eos> You got something for me?<eos> I did.
Kurt, did you know?<eos> If I knew, I would have said something to you.<eos> Look, we need to take a step back and figure things out.<eos> This changes things.<eos> Not for me, it doesn't.
When you were my age, you were already running things.<eos> There was no one holding you back.<eos> There was no one protecting me either.<eos> - I don't need your protection!<eos> - Yes, you do!
You don't even know me.<eos> Why do you care?<eos> One day, you're going to have a moment like this with someone else, sharing your experience.<eos> That's how it works.<eos> And it does work.
Oh, my God, it's so cool.<eos> It's this app that lets me watch Willow while she's in her crib.<eos> Really?<eos> Do you not trust your nanny?<eos> No, no, I do.
- Hey!<eos> - Hi!<eos> How's it going?<eos> My God!<eos> - How you doing?
One of those, I don't know, gross, coupled-up,<eos> - relationship evangelist things...<eos> - And yet...<eos> But you liked being with Lynn.<eos> Yes, of course I did.
Anyway, that's not why we broke up. - We just weren't right for each other.<eos> - No, no, no.<eos> - How do you know that?<eos> - I just did. I...<eos> - I do.
I want to get there myself to see this feat.<eos> By God, that the reed raises.<eos> Look that the slut will bring it down.<eos> - Don't make the text up.<eos> - I don't.
I had, like, a huge crush on you in high school.<eos> You knew that.<eos> No, I did not.<eos> What?<eos> Oh, whoops. No, I didn't.
It's pussy dust.<eos> Pussy dust.<eos> We get a private room, I'll show you my pussy dust.<eos> You like to party?<eos> Who doesn't?
You like to party?<eos> Who doesn't?<eos> To happy endings.<eos> I love happy endings.<eos> Who doesn't?
Haven't heard from her since?<eos> She called me a few months ago, in fact.<eos> Said that she was engaged to be married.<eos> She say to who?<eos> She did not.
I had no idea you'd grown up to be a detective till I saw your name in the paper... yours and Marjorie's.<eos> That case had nothing to do with my mother.<eos> It was just a lawyer dragging her name through the mud, trying to get to me.<eos> You said you know who killed her.<eos> Yes, I do.
- Correct.<eos> Nash is a firearms dealer.<eos> Makes sense he might recycle his brass.<eos> Did you find a reloader at his house?<eos> No, we did not.
You really think a dance is all it takes?<eos> Mom, I know that Schmidt is not what you imagined.<eos> Or what I imagined.<eos> I never thought I would fall for the slim-hipped ghost of Tom Cruise.<eos> None of us did.
You sure?<eos> If we don't go now, he'll get too far away.<eos> So, you did or you didn't see something?<eos> It's hard to say.<eos> Well, you either did or you didn't, Philip.
And running around like crazy.<eos> You're safe.<eos> We're together.<eos> Did he know?<eos> Gene, did he...
I mean, you're sportin' dress blues, for Christ's sake.<eos> And, like I said, we're gonna drive you back to where you were.<eos> I mean, do you know how awkward it is carpooling with someone whose friend or friends you've just killed?<eos> Oof. But I told you not to ask any questions.<eos> And then what does this ginger do?
Oh, well, so far so good.<eos> We'll see how it goes.<eos> I bet you cried your eyes out with your only one going off to college. -Well...<eos> -She did.<eos> You did.
No, no, no,<eos> -and of course I'm-- -hold on, Ms. Diaz, this is a conversation you should be having with your attorney in private. Your honor, if I can just have<eos> -a second with my client.<eos> -I trust you understand how many cases we have backed up today.<eos> I do, I do.
_<eos> - Arigato gozaimasu.<eos> - Arigato gozaimasu.<eos> Honestly, I think you're overreacting.<eos> - (Hannah) No, you don't.
All right, then.<eos> Terrific.<eos> We got the contracts right here.<eos> - You hear what I just said?<eos> - I did. I did.
All right, fine.<eos> They're not for everybody.<eos> You just do your thing, baby.<eos> Where'd you say you were from?<eos> I didn't.
The Parsi. In his British suit. Aafrin!<eos> Aafrin...<eos> Wait!<eos> Wait!<eos> She did nothing!
What if I had been in here shitting?<eos> You never take a... you never do that in the morning.<eos> I said what if.<eos> - We need to talk.<eos> - Do we?
You never take a... you never do that in the morning.<eos> I said what if.<eos> - We need to talk.<eos> - Do we?<eos> - We do.
It's not a store. It's an art gallery.<eos> Whatever it is, I think you should hold off for a few months because there are more important things that we should be thinking about.<eos> - Where are you going?<eos> - I think we're wasting our time with counseling.<eos> - So do I.
Okay.<eos> Open.<eos> What did you try to do?<eos> Crack a walnut?<eos> Your wife did some damage here.
Slim always had a bad temper.<eos> William, we have to go now.<eos> Lazo's been conning us the whole time.<eos> He was never gonna give the nitro to the Confederados. We have to run.<eos> Of course we do.
No? You have 11 missed calls.<eos> You have to fuckin' talk to him.<eos> Do I, Clyde?<eos> Yes, you do, Jeannie.<eos> Yes, you do.
Once they have established a toehold in Cuba, the Kohl brothers can spread their many tentacles into other arenas.<eos> Agriculture, energy, polymers and paper.<eos> We'll look at the file trajectory, determine the extent of the malware compromise.<eos> Hey, how's it going?<eos> - Hey, guys. How you doing?
And then what?<eos> He came in.<eos> You invited him in?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - You did?
How could anyone do this?<eos> Well, Sir, she claims that she was trying to fend off your advances.<eos> What?<eos> She was trying to fight you off, that's what she claims.<eos> Miss Prasad does? - Yes.
Yes, then a day becomes a week.<eos> Wasting my breath, aren't I?<eos> You can't do this.<eos> You don't have the strength.<eos> - Lucky for you, I do.
It should be enough for our passage. - All right.<eos> - I still can't believe we're finally going to do this.<eos> Madam? Coo-ee!<eos> Somebody overdo it on Cynthia's punch last night?<eos> Yes, somebody did.
Sooni's a very fine artist. What?<eos> In fact, I just happen to have, by chance, one or two things... here.<eos> Have a look.<eos> And how did you learn to draw like this, Sooni?<eos> I didn't.
What, when they're asleep?<eos> No, no, I meant when they're peaceful!<eos> You never wanted children of your own?<eos> Yeah, I wanted them.<eos> What wife doesn't?
- Come on in, Greg.<eos> - We're not going to the police.<eos> Greg...<eos> Did you actually see her shoot him?<eos> No, no, I didn't.
It's just that... I just had such weird thoughts.<eos> What thoughts?<eos> Stupid things.<eos> Do you trust me, Mum?<eos> Of course I do.
You are forbidden to go there!<eos> Go where?<eos> She's been to the hospital, looking for Frank Stringfellow.<eos> Did you find him?<eos> No, sir, I didn't.
How'd she die?<eos> Cancer.<eos> - Did you cry?<eos> Do you still miss her?<eos> Yeah. Yeah, yeah, I do.
Well, what do you believe that is?<eos> Prevent the spread of Communism.<eos> Right, well, we secure this gook stockpile in Quan Thang, we secure the lives and safety of hundreds of Marines, maybe thousands.<eos> Now, you believe that's worth something fighting for?<eos> Yes, sir, Captain, I do.
You've got god and miss Dix on your side, dear.<eos> Do as you deem fit.<eos> You don't want to see Mr. Bullen, miss. Yes, I do.<eos> No.<eos> No, you don't.
Go back. Go.<eos> Give me your gun.<eos> You can't die. I can.<eos> Jarrod, the Ilythia Clinic doesn't exist.<eos> Of course it does.
Did you mean to check every box yes?<eos> Yes.<eos> Why would you do that?<eos> You can't have every condition on that form.<eos> I do.
Because I have a lot of opinions about suicide.<eos> Now that I'm hearing that question aloud...<eos> Well, thanks to your answers, the school district is sending a psychologist to evaluate your classroom performance.<eos> Oh, I do not think that is necessary.<eos> The district does.
She's avoiding me.<eos> It sucks not having my little Christian with me all day.<eos> I miss our talks about "Teen Mom" where we guess which one will be the first to get their kid taken away.<eos> But I, like, don't really miss her or anything.<eos> Of course you do.
You know, the ones where the girls don't really want to be there.<eos> Oh, God.<eos> Eva, no, I'm not into that kind of stuff.<eos> - You know me.<eos> - I do.
"One guy"?<eos> His name is Rand, man.<eos> Rand.<eos> He's been my best friend for, like, 15 years and you don't even know his name.<eos> Yeah, I do.
That's it, yes.<eos> Well, that does make things easier. No.<eos> God. Please, wait. Wait.<eos> Please, don't.<eos> Please, don't.
- Shut your face, Gitty!<eos> - Martin, watch your mouth.<eos> Martin, this chicken's delicious.<eos> - Where'd you buy it?<eos> - I didn't.
A little bit at a time.<eos> For Ramba Ral.<eos> Do you like chocolates?<eos> What?<eos> Yes, I do.
There's something missing.<eos> Bruising around the neck.<eos> Right?<eos> Your guy doesn't have any.<eos> All our male victims did.
It's a good school.<eos> It's gonna help you get into college.<eos> Is everything okay with you and Evy?<eos> I don't want to go back to that place.<eos> I don't.
Leave your key cards.<eos> This is bullshit.<eos> I didn't do anything out-of-bounds... No more than anyone else.<eos> Did I sign off on that trade?<eos> No, I did not.
What you should have done, if you were really playing an elevated game, was come to me with what you had.<eos> See, if I had something better to give you in exchange for you holding on to it...<eos> You have never been willing to play any kind of game with me.<eos> I didn't know you were ready to play in the bigs, man.<eos> Now I do.
We're not leaving until we know where the cargo is<eos> We're obliged to gather the people together so we can depart We must be ready when the pack ice disperses<eos> If you make that call, I'll make a call of my own<eos> Did you buy a phone at the petrol station recently?<eos> Yes, I did
Ma.<eos> No.<eos> No.<eos> Anika Calhoun, do you take Lucious Lyon to be your lawfully wedded husband?<eos> I do.
And before I broke their last phone, it rang.<eos> There was a message and an offer.<eos> And since you have already compromised my place of business, I thought I might take the better deal.<eos> You understand.<eos> I do, but you don't.
Excuse me.<eos> -You have a nice house.<eos> -Thank you. -Expensive?<eos> Do you know what it's like to grow up in a home where everyone makes it?<eos> -No, I don't actually. -No...
I miss her and Rikard, but that doesn't make me do stupid things.<eos> -It's not the same.<eos> -Why not?<eos> -You don't need to refuel.<eos> -I don't?
It was nice.<eos> -How nice?<eos> -Stop it.<eos> So I can't ask why you spent the night with another man?<eos> I didn't, Erling.
What do we do?<eos> The Defence Minister and the reporter will be on the news tonight.<eos> -They want you to send a soldier.<eos> -We didn't know.<eos> -You do now.
So you know, I have a record, but...<eos> Yes, we have that information.<eos> That's not an issue.<eos> The position's yours if you want it.<eos> And you do.
Sure.<eos> Sounds like the protestors have been out to get her father for years.<eos> Think they're about ready to make good on their threat to put him down?<eos> I'm more inclined to think that someone in the Turner family wants to make sure that this wedding doesn't happen.<eos> Because if it does,
And please tell Ms. Shaw this is not her cross to bear.<eos> This lapdog has the same card.<eos> Temporary Resolutions.<eos> You want to tell me how this all-seeing eye thing doesn't see us coming?<eos> It does.
He knows you're not.<eos> He slipped up.<eos> He went back to the place he and Grace had their first date.<eos> Harold has a weakness.<eos> We all do.
- A bomb went off.<eos> I think running was the appropriate reaction.<eos> How long have you known Logan Pierce?<eos> The Friendczar guy?<eos> I don't.
Agent Wickham, Homeland Security.<eos> Detective Fusco here's been working with us to infiltrate this domestic terrorist ring.<eos> Homeland Security running a joint operation with NYPD?<eos> - How do you explain that one?<eos> - I don't.
- What's my problem?<eos> - What's your problem?<eos> You asked me did I know what my problem is, then you... told the story and I don't know what does it have to do with me?<eos> I didn't ask you that.<eos> - Yeah, you did.
-Because we never talked about it.<eos> -About what? I do not understand.<eos> -You know.<eos> -No, I do not.<eos> Yes you do.
What you saw in that video, that is my job.<eos> I have called in air strikes, bombed villages, I've...<eos> Thrown grenades into houses.<eos> How does that feel?<eos> It doesn't.
I mean, she... She said it so casually.<eos> In the next room, my six-year-old daughter was being taken off life support.<eos> And this woman says "collateral beauty."<eos> People don't know what to say in those moments.<eos> No, she did.
Uh, here, ketchup at midnight, mustard at four o'clock, mayo at eight o'clock.<eos> Good stuff, okay?<eos> Did I have an NDE?<eos> No.<eos> I didn't, but I, uh...
What was Hap recording?<eos> What did it mean?<eos> He was recording the soundscapes of our NDEs, trying to map out what it was that people call "the other side."<eos> Yeah, I... I put that part together.<eos> Bullshit you did.
- Lorna left me.<eos> - Oh, no.<eos> Yeah, she, she walked out, left a note and, and I'm so upset!<eos> Well, we're gonna break up too unless there's a major change.<eos> But my wife already did.
You're taking this way out of proportion.<eos> I think this shows that I care about you the most.<eos> I was the most worried to tell you.<eos> Does that not mean anything to you?<eos> No, it doesn't.
What is his name?<eos> What's your name?<eos> I'm Ma Yuan.<eos> He signed in this morning.<eos> So did everyone else.
Yes, I'm sure.<eos> But what the hell does it matter?<eos> I mean, really, Ethan, what is your angle here?<eos> That Gary finished up his spreadsheets and then they sent him over here to blow me away?<eos> You done?
In 10 years, we're all gonna be robots who speak Chinese, okay?<eos> So why don't you apologize for what you did to this piece of paper?<eos> I didn't rip it.<eos> I may have written some stuff on there, but the rips were all her.<eos> - She did the rips.
So why don't you apologize for what you did to this piece of paper?<eos> I didn't rip it.<eos> I may have written some stuff on there, but the rips were all her.<eos> - She did the rips.<eos> - He did the rips.
I just thought I had one thing that I was good at.<eos> My mom wants me out on the street.<eos> Fuck 'em.<eos> Just pay attention to what people say.<eos> Or what they don't.
Somebody hands you an idea and you execute like nobody's business.<eos> Yeah, that's right. - That's right.<eos> Look.<eos> I wish I had a family like this.<eos> You do.
You should be thinking hip replacement.<eos> It was so cute yesterday when they talked about bombing the Pentagon.<eos> You think it's charming that he never... he never spoke like that until she got her hands on him.<eos> Oh, you can't legislate feeling.<eos> In China, they do.
No. He needs a prime number. - Something like 607.<eos> - No, really, that's fine.<eos> Don't need a prime number.<eos> - It's okay.<eos> - Yes... no, we do.
New things can be fun, too.<eos> Unless you're afraid of change.<eos> Oh, I'm not afraid of much, and I can change in an instant, but, uh, not just for the fuck of it.<eos> Sometimes, you just got to make the change blindly and pray that it all goes well.<eos> And most of the time, it does.
- She's going to need something a little flashier for the amfAR dinner. - Yeah.<eos> That's the stuff Louis set aside for the dinner.<eos> If Louis likes it, then she'll love it.<eos> - You like it?<eos> - Mm. So does Louis.
After death, there's nothing. I<eos> - I know.<eos> And it's not that big a deal.<eos> You told me that you had a hope... Like you really hoped that...<eos> Of course I do.
Years ago, Mum died, he was sure that... he was visited by her.<eos> That it felt like a dream, but not, that it was very real.<eos> He could smell her, he could see her so clearly... you know?<eos> Do you believe that?<eos> Yeah, I do.
He could smell her, he could see her so clearly... you know?<eos> Do you believe that?<eos> Yeah, I do.<eos> It's not a religion thing, but I...<eos> I do.
My grandson, Oscar, was killed at the front there.<eos> Perhaps you knew?<eos> No.<eos> No, Your Highness. I...<eos> I didn't.
Bella!<eos> ♪ Rock, babe, rock, babe ♪<eos> What I tell you?<eos> She's coming.<eos> - How you doing?
I'm not one of those people who has it easy. You know, who can just bounce back, pretend like nothing ever happened.<eos> So, you two just had a civil ceremony?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Where'd you and Juliette honeymoon?<eos> We didn't, actually.
I don't think so.<eos> He said the money's gone.<eos> Looks like she is, too.<eos> He tried to call her.<eos> Yeah, I did, too.
Let me know if she does or if I need to hire somebody for that shift.<eos> Yeah.<eos> What do you got going on today?<eos> Hear our buddy Riff Bell's coming out of retirement?<eos> Yes, I did.
I owe you mine.<eos> What?<eos> That song... all my songs... they wouldn't exist without you.<eos> You're the person who got me into songwriting in the first place, so it doesn't seem right to me to just have my name on it.<eos> Hey. How y'all doing?
What do you say?<eos> You bet.<eos> Hey, there.<eos> Hey.<eos> How you doing?
What if Riff's just sick or hung over or something?<eos> I doubt Luke would consider canceling for a hangover.<eos> But he's looking for a replacement, right?<eos> - I'm sure he's gonna find someone.<eos> - What if he doesn't?
Avery has no time for me now that Juliette's back in town, so I feel like my album's at a standstill.<eos> Are they, like, hanging out again or something?<eos> They're hardly talking, actually.<eos> Not everybody has a great relationship with their ex.<eos> Well, Scarlett and Gunnar do.
- Thanks for coming.<eos> - Hey, anytime you tell me there's a new talent I should see, I am there.<eos> Yeah.<eos> - What'd you say this girl's name was?<eos> - I didn't.
You don't understand!<eos> She took everything from me!<eos> Yes, at first, I wanted to hurt her, and so maybe this started out wrong, but I swear my feelings for you are real.<eos> It doesn't matter... anymore.<eos> Of course it does.
It's been a rough year, huh?<eos> That's the understatement of the century.<eos> You know, I-I tried to call.<eos> I guess you changed your number.<eos> Yeah, I did a few times.
Daughter... it would be wise to remember I did not kill Mattiyahu.<eos> It was the Philistines, and I will seek retribution for their act.<eos> You can't be serious.<eos> I just really like her.<eos> Of course you do.
Yeah, I see your point.<eos> Did you get what you came for?<eos> Well, I came to bring someone back to New York.<eos> So, yeah.<eos> I did.
Hey, in case you haven't noticed, they're not kids anymore.<eos> With Clarke gone, Bellamy's the key.<eos> I've been trying to reach him, but Pike's influence is strong,<eos> and he really believes he's doing the right thing.<eos> Everybody always does.
Did we land dentine ice?<eos> What?<eos> Sorry, I repurposed the dentine pitch.<eos> But you see what I'm saying? Yeah.<eos> I do.
He's a hospital rat, Miss Phinney. Don't be taken in.<eos> Bullen -- he sent those men after you?<eos> I'm sorry you had to find out, but it's better you know.<eos> Silas has no intention of bringing your boy to Alexandria.<eos> Never did.
- I'm gonna...<eos> Yo, J, you see? He didn't die.<eos> I knew that shit would work.<eos> Guess I lost that bet.<eos> Nah, he did.
Along with the Duke's stolen documents.<eos> He didn't lose money, he was lying.<eos> I told you everything I remember.<eos> I couldn't see who took the purse and I didn't get anywhere near the Duke.<eos> Who did?
Get outta here!<eos> You live in a fucking nice area in a house that's... The living room's bigger than my whole place.<eos> How could you like this?<eos> I like it.<eos> You do?
We're driving into a shitstorm, Howard.<eos> What the hell is that?<eos> She's our gang.<eos> Come on, let's move.<eos> How you doing?
You can't.<eos> Carl?<eos> I thought I saw her that night.<eos> I thought I did.<eos> I did.
It's fundraising season.<eos> The administration needs Wall Street money to compete.<eos> Nobody wants this to look like some kind of crusade.<eos> I'm doing my job. I don't think about what it looks like.<eos> Well, the AG does.
Then I hypnotized him out of it. - Mm.<eos> You going for hypnotism now, Nancy?<eos> - Oh. - Huh? - It only works on him.<eos> I stare into his eyes, he locks in on me... and we will the change.<eos> Work it does.
You were right. It was the girlfriend.<eos> The video makes the whole thing clear. He was drinking. He basically admits to driving your kids drunk.<eos> He insults them and you.<eos> We've got the full version now.<eos> No one else does.
It hurts.<eos> Stop!<eos> Please...<eos> It doesn't matter.<eos> No, it doesn't.
- We don't talk much.<eos> - Oh?<eos> - You knew that.<eos> - No, I didn't.<eos> - Yes, you did.
Look, look, I know it's hard, all right?<eos> I'm sorry, I just... I got to get to work.<eos> Mr. Decody.<eos> So we're still going to keep her here a little while longer.<eos> But, uh, she did great.
I was frustrated.<eos> She was all over the place. She wouldn't tell me why.<eos> I was just making a point and...<eos> How did you know it was my print?<eos> Oh, I didn't, pet.
Flooded, thanks to Warren's press conference.<eos> Anything other than the usual shut-ins and crackpots?<eos> Even if someone calls with something, i-it'll take forever to find them in the haystack.<eos> We don't have forever.<eos> No, we do not.
Would you?<eos> Would I what? Marry me.<eos> Did you just ask me to marry you?<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> You did.
Kaboom!<eos> There's another 800,000 shares on this ticket. Can you get 'em in for me?<eos> You know I will. Give me some ups.<eos> Thanks.<eos> He did it.
Maybe you're not supposed to get over it.<eos> Some things you can't move past.<eos> They scar you, change you permanently.<eos> I don't know what happened there, on that planet.<eos> I do.
What do you mean, "both of them"?<eos> Yeah, I made a copy of the tape.<eos> You taught me that.<eos> Always make a copy.<eos> Well, Mindhorn did.
I don't know anything.<eos> I'm actually quite confused.<eos> You know that I killed Moncrief, right?<eos> I did not know that.<eos> Well, you do now.
Sit down.<eos> I record my sessions for later review, saves taking notes.<eos> I've never heard my own voice.<eos> You wouldn't like it.<eos> No one does.
If your goal was to scare the crap out of me, mission accomplished!<eos> And as far as I'm concerned... you can have it out with those Shadowhunters.<eos> Especially, the blonde one.<eos> You know, you don't need me.<eos> On the contrary, I do.
Someone who is in service to a cause greater than themselves.<eos> At least she is now.<eos> Abracadabra.<eos> Wait, you people actually say that?<eos> No, Clary, we don't.
Where are Alec and Isabelle?<eos> Being distracting.<eos> You're really not gonna talk to me, are you?<eos> That's because you have no idea what you're talking about.<eos> But I do.
Daisy, Bobbi, Mack, contain the General. Try to get him outside.<eos> We'll send the containment module down to the South exit.<eos> Yeah, be careful.<eos> He's an assassin, and we don't know what his powers are yet.<eos> Perhaps we do.
- Well, that's just as well.<eos> You've got two witnesses sat here saw you throw the first punch.<eos> You said you were looking at the Pevenseys.<eos> I just wanted to ask that fairground owner whether he knew Brendan.<eos> And did he?
I'm sick of my mum trying to break us up.<eos> Was that the only reason?<eos> Yeah.<eos> - Does Harris love you?<eos> - Yeah, of course he does.
Good.<eos> So, let's talk about what happened to your old bunkmate Jamie Thorne.<eos> I don't know anything about that.<eos> Jodie told you where I was.<eos> My mistake, pet, so she did.
I'm proud to be married to one, and I'm proud to have served with one, like Congresswoman Jones.<eos> Thank you, Doris, for all your years of service, and thank you, Celia, for picking up the mantle.<eos> Doris said her daughter spoke out of turn, that she didn't know about the deal she was brokering with Underwood.<eos> Did you connect with LeAnn?<eos> No, I didn't.
And second, as a gesture of good faith, we'd like to return Igor Milkin to Russia.<eos> You should've done so already.<eos> I need your assurances he'll get a trial.<eos> - What do you care about Igor Milkin?<eos> - I don't.
This is beast-to-beast catharsis.<eos> But I promise I will make sure they take good care of you because you were the best horse ever.<eos> A true friend.<eos> Even if sometimes I might have taken you for granted, you were always there for me... and you never held it against me if I got a little bitchy because you knew how much I loved you, even if I didn't say it<eos> But I did.

Can he play whilst we talk?<eos> Please.<eos> You were saying?<eos> He liked to drink.<eos> Plenty of them do in here.
Uh, congrats on your engagement.<eos> I-I meant to say that yesterday.<eos> Sorry.<eos> - So you kept the table?<eos> - Of course, I did.
And I know that Ezra can't look me in the eye when he lies. And when he told me he went home, he didn't...<eos> Look at me.<eos> Well, we have to tell someone.<eos> - Lorenzo, Ali, anyone.<eos> - No, we don't.
I knew this was too much house.<eos> What are we gonna do?<eos> I'm two years away from college, so this is more of a "you" problem than a "we" problem.<eos> Well, I've got a "disaster preparedness" folder.<eos> Of course you do.
Raising four kids requires the parents to be a perfectly coordinated team, and Bow and I are on point.<eos> We have it down. Mm!<eos> Or we did.
She is literally airing our dirty laundry.<eos> And it did not stop there, Dre.<eos> The wife says her hair is naturally curly, and I guess it is... if you call $700 worth of product natural.<eos> Oh, you did not like that.<eos> No, I did not.
- Everything!<eos> - No, she...<eos> - No, yes, she did. - No.<eos> She did not say anything.<eos> She did.
-No.<eos> -Good.<eos> Your female instinct, what does it tell you?<eos> I don't have one.<eos> Of course you do.
The Vice Regent's horse... fell on his leg.<eos> And you left them there.<eos> I thought you'd left me.<eos> Well, I said I was coming back.<eos> - You did?
And you left them there.<eos> I thought you'd left me.<eos> Well, I said I was coming back.<eos> - You did?<eos> Yes, you did.
Hello, my Princess Ling Ling.<eos> - Am I still a princess?<eos> - Of course you are.<eos> Master Ahmad says I may marry a prince one day.<eos> Does he now?
Maybe.<eos> -That's not what I'm meant to be.<eos> -And I am?<eos> -So you want it?<eos> -What if I did?
- I see, okay.<eos> Um, well, you know, uh... what is it?<eos> She slept over like a week and a half ago, and she hasn't left.<eos> - I mean, don't get me wrong, I love having her there at night, - if you know what I mean.<eos> - Yeah, I do, yeah.
Okay, but, like, why Dominique?<eos> So Hot Rachel gets the overnight.<eos> I mean, if I gave Darius an actual choice, then I wouldn't get what I want.<eos> Okay, well, Darius wants Ruby, FYI.<eos> Of course he does.
He doesn't even have the authority<eos> - to offer you something like that.<eos> - Oh, he didn't?<eos> The network president, Gary?<eos> Yeah, he did.
Okay.<eos> Ruby.<eos> Look, I know you don't want to hear it, but you know who doesn't win this thing?<eos> Rosa Parks.<eos> And who does?
Do you ever feel bad about what we do to these girls?<eos> - Oh, my God!<eos> - Darius, I'm so sorry!<eos> No.<eos> No, we don't.
Look, I'm not humiliating Chantal on national television.<eos> I'm not doing it.<eos> It won't happen, okay? She's a sweet girl.<eos> She doesn't deserve that.<eos> Okay, but Yael does?
I have a lot of friends and a pile of cash.<eos> We, uh... You really think we need $100,000 "Greens" budget?<eos> How did you get that?<eos> I know some hackers, and they taught me, so I tapped your phone, turned on the mike... - You tapped my phone?<eos> - Yes. I did this for...
His name is Chronos.<eos> He works for the Council of Time Masters.<eos> Chronos was clearly sent to bring me in.<eos> The Lazarus Pit brought me back, but it left me with this need to kill.<eos> Sara! Sara, don't!
And then, um, when I get the register open, you guys pull out the gun, and then I give you the money.<eos> Okay, look.<eos> We're lying. We're not. No one has a gun.<eos> We might have a gun.<eos> Nobody does.
How was it you came to send Philip after Dr. Lorenz?<eos> First person I bumped into.<eos> Said he saw him heading into the Heartwood.<eos> - And where did you find his case?<eos> - I didn't.
- Where's Stephanie now, Gideon?<eos> I was foolish.<eos> I thought that I could bring back the Hydra and guide it the same way Stephanie commanded that horse.<eos> I taught her to have faith in it as a god.<eos> And she did.
And which beliefs did he come to because of you?<eos> I am his father.<eos> That is a notional term, sir.<eos> You have a cheek.<eos> You always did.
The killing that comes your way, that ain't.<eos> Do you understand what you raise in me, Matthew?<eos> - If this absurd plot of yours fails...<eos> - It won't.<eos> Well, if it does...
What?<eos> You knew?<eos> You knew he was here, pushing his refined nose into work he had long since abandoned?<eos> Now, Drake, I merely told him...<eos> Do not now me nothing, Jackson!
- Nothing.<eos> - Right?<eos> I use scented tampons even when I'm not on my period, just to chemically strip my vagina of any scent.<eos> But I still worry it tastes really bad.<eos> It definitely does.
This is the good one.<eos> O'Neill?<eos> I heard he had kidney stones. But no health insurance.<eos> So he thought he'd power through, wait for it to pass.<eos> It didn't.
Hey, Will?<eos> Check it out.<eos> Detainee said this is where he picked up the radio scripts.<eos> You think all these cells are operating independently.<eos> I do.
I have to prove myself... As a husband and a father.<eos> I mean, well, this isn't the sort of thing I'd agree to do normally, without an important reason.<eos> Of course.<eos> Did I ever tell you I started out as a lab assistant?<eos> Of course, I did, right?
Please...<eos> You can't help him.<eos> That's big.<eos> No one said it was that big.<eos> I did.
In the cellar.<eos> You'll find what you're looking for in the cellar.<eos> Go ahead.<eos> Release the arrow.<eos> Do it, Marie-Jeanne.
Yeah, I'm... I'm... I... don't want to nag.<eos> That's not, you know, who I am.<eos> I just...<eos> I don't... I don't want you to feel burdened by anything.<eos> No, I don't.
I must've been thinkin' of someone else.<eos> Yeah. Maybe someone else who should be captain?<eos> We'll make it.<eos> Well, guess we have to go now.<eos> No, we don't.
Someone Mrs. Stilinski didn't see.<eos> Well, if Claudia is not seeing ghosts, maybe it's because she's not a Banshee.<eos> I think he was trying to help me find something Stiles left behind.<eos> A relic.<eos> Did you?
Pain is real.<eos> Feeling is real. Unh!<eos> You love this, don't you?<eos> I'm gonna die knowing my own son hates me.<eos> Yes. He does.
Elliott told you?<eos> Yeah, well, they're my eggs and I made the decision so I need to do it.<eos> You can say whatever you wanna say. I don't care.<eos> Just... [sighs] ... promise me you won't tell my mom.<eos> Emily, Elliott didn't.
Something's really wrong.<eos> Where are you going with this?<eos> - You went to see her?<eos> - Yes, Byron.<eos> I did.
Wait, Melissa Hastings?<eos> Melissa might have called Charlotte from the diner, she could've been the one who lured her out in the middle of the night......<eos> No, no, no, hold on.<eos> Wasn't Melissa in London? Spencer thinks so.<eos> Caleb doesn't.
Well, I doubt she's asking him for a ride to the airport.<eos> It was a meeting of the minions.<eos> Yeah, could be.<eos> Did he go in there with that tube?<eos> No, he didn't.
Don't do-- don't do this.<eos> Thank you both for coming.<eos> How is Thea?<eos> Don't pretend like you care.<eos> I do.
Reiter's pet.<eos> You don't know what you're talking about.<eos> I know you killed Vlad.<eos> I watched.<eos> We all did.
And he saved me.<eos> At great risk to himself, he kept me alive.<eos> I have more reason than anyone to hate this man, but he's our best chance of going home.<eos> He killed your brother.<eos> Yes, he did.
When you two were married, it was like living at the Gap.<eos> Hey, what did Noah mean when he said that he didn't have much choice in the matter when he left?<eos> I always just assumed he disappeared.<eos> He didn't disappear, hon.<eos> I did.
Hey, what did Noah mean when he said that he didn't have much choice in the matter when he left?<eos> I always just assumed he disappeared.<eos> He didn't disappear, hon.<eos> I did.<eos> We did.
Uh, actually, you owe me $20.<eos> Here's $50, go change your underwear.<eos> It won't come off.<eos> Hey, Peter, you want to earn another ten bucks?<eos> Course I do.
- They send you in here looking for me?<eos> - Did who send me in here looking for you?<eos> - The fucking producers, man.<eos> Did they send you in here to get me?<eos> No, they didn't.
Are you trying to hurt me?<eos> I'm not doing this to you. Then who are you doin' it to?<eos> Your lostie?<eos> He doesn't care about you either.<eos> He never did.
None of us do.<eos> Did you at least tell Coulson we might have a cure?<eos> No.<eos> Why not?<eos> Because we don't.
When you're not in prison, you bounce from town to town, rarely staying longer than a couple of weeks.<eos> You're just a thief, a pickpocket, a grifter... a survivor.<eos> All your worldly possessions are in this piece-of-shit motel room, and if you O.D. today, nobody would bother to claim your body.<eos> - Did you kill her?<eos> - Of course I did.
Apparently, you knew where Michael Thompson was living.<eos> I've never seen that e-mail.<eos> We found it on your computer in a file named "Dolos".<eos> See, Phyllis Brennan told us almost everything that we need to know about you.<eos> Or rather, you did.
And even if it were it really is beautiful.<eos> Wow, the Betsy Ross flag.<eos> The original Stars and Stripes.<eos> She told me she was not going on the mission.<eos> Clearly, she did.
Unless you're arresting and charging me, I don't have to give you prints.<eos> And any prints you DO take without my consent are unusable in court.<eos> So, again - no.<eos> - You know your rights.<eos> - Aye, I do.
My problem... (Voices in background)<eos> My problem... is what really happened with you and that suspect.<eos> Don't try playing the big man.<eos> We both know you're not up to it.<eos> She definitely does.
Neither are we.<eos> You know why I've been appointed - to ensure that anti-corruption inquiries don't get pulled apart in court.<eos> Don't try playing the big man.<eos> We both know you're not up to it.<eos> She definitely does.
Come on.<eos> Wait!<eos> - What did you do to me?<eos> - The only thing we could think of.<eos> Did we just...
First thing is to send an SOS to Berk.<eos> We need reinforcements, fast.<eos> The auxiliary team.<eos> How do we know he'll get there in time?<eos> We don't.
The auxiliary team.<eos> How do we know he'll get there in time?<eos> We don't.<eos> Well, how do we know they'll get back here in time?<eos> We don't.
You have no birthright.<eos> You gave it up when you joined your uncle in treason.<eos> Oh, for once in your life, can you please just be honest with yourself?<eos> You never had any intention of stepping aside for me, did you?<eos> I did.
We'll just spray it all over the fort.<eos> You know, you really should call it anti-clown spray.<eos> I mean, clown spray would attract clowns.<eos> -No, clowns.<eos> -But it doesn't! Right, Grandma Grace?
I was dying to tell you, Mom. I called you.<eos> And left a message with no hint of any news.<eos> I didn't want to tell you in a message.<eos> Well, you know something, it felt... like you didn't really want to tell me at all.<eos> Mom, of course I did.
♪ Embrace the doubt and face the fear ♪<eos> You cannot be calling me.<eos> You didn't answer my text.<eos> That's right.<eos> I didn't.
- Did you clone her phone? - A little.<eos> - Where's she going?<eos> Let's find out.<eos> Alice and I have things to discuss.<eos> No, we don't.
Morgan and Stephanie love each other, right?<eos> So all you have to do is convince them that marriage is still worth it.<eos> You still believe that, don't you?<eos> That part wasn't a lie.<eos> I do.
What did you say?<eos> Well, I said no, of course.<eos> W... I'm not gonna sit here and say to you and Morgan that marriage is an outdated concept and then turn around and marry him.<eos> Yeah, but you love him, don't you?<eos> Of course I do.
Well, I don't know what he was doing, but that's out there forever, all right?<eos> And once it's out there, there's not anything anybody can do about it, so... so don't be him.<eos> Well, I'm not him, nor do I even know him.<eos> So, I don't know why you have to assume I'm gonna do something wrong.<eos> I don't. I just...
- You sure? - Go.<eos> Thank you so much.<eos> I think you messed something up.<eos> Really?<eos> No, I didn't.
And we don't have to share it with your dad.<eos> In fact, we can give him this poison martini.<eos> Piss off, Francine.<eos> I've got too much to live for, knowing I still have my Ken Griffey Jr. rookie cards.<eos> Um, actually, you don't.
You win that Oscar, the next day you go back to being you.<eos> But that night is a really good night.<eos> I think you deserve a really good night, and I know how to get you there.<eos> Do you want that?<eos> Yes, I do.
Who?<eos> I have no idea.<eos> But I might be able to help you figure out why.<eos> First question I'd ask is: Why did Verna McBride deserve to die?<eos> - She didn't.
Did you really think I'd accept your charity?<eos> Charity?<eos> I don't have the power to make you pope, Michael.<eos> It's not true that you don't have the power to make me pope.<eos> You do.
Try to picture him with Christina McGee.<eos> Where the hell am I?<eos> It's charged. You can go now.<eos> You said you'd release me.<eos> Yes, I did.
- I can't live with it.<eos> - I remember that pain ... sick with guilt, anger.<eos> I know why you went to face Hive alone.<eos> I tried. I tried to defeat him.<eos> - I did, but I ...
I don't suppose you came with any concrete ideas.<eos> I have one.<eos> Coulson's gonna need your help.<eos> I don't know what he's planning, but ...<eos> - I do.
You gonna keep me hanging?<eos> So, Suh Casa.<eos> It ought to be a big hit, huh?<eos> What's up, big dog?<eos> How you doing, man?
The hunger.<eos> I'd like to blame my anger on Finn, but it's been growing worse since I came back.<eos> I never did learn how to keep it in check.<eos> I never really cared to.<eos> But now you do.
I kept Hayley breathing!<eos> I kept white oak from piercing your cold, black heart.<eos> I did everything!<eos> We know.<eos> No, you don't.
I kept white oak from piercing your cold, black heart.<eos> I did everything!<eos> We know.<eos> No, you don't.<eos> No, you don't.
Though I suppose I will let you listen to her cries as I tear off her limbs like the wings of pretty little butterfly.<eos> I'd like to see you try. You're brandishing your antiques at me.<eos> I suppose I would be scared if I thought you were quick enough to use them.<eos> You really did not think this through, did you?<eos> Actually, we did.
Not when... not when I'm starting to feel like I have my daughter back.<eos> Thank you for listening.<eos> How things go with your brother?<eos> You guys talk things through?<eos> Yeah. Yeah, we did.
I have apologies to give to you.<eos> For what?<eos> For the man that I was, the man I become.<eos> I should be the one apologizing to you.<eos> I done terrible things...
Tony and I are both going to be going to the LaGuardia High School for Performing Arts in Manhattan, so I don't need to take the subway or anything to school.<eos> I could just walk.<eos> And you'll be closer to the theater.<eos> I loved the show, Dad, I loved it.<eos> I really did.
I could just walk.<eos> And you'll be closer to the theater.<eos> I loved the show, Dad, I loved it.<eos> I really did.<eos> Tony did, too.
Yeah.<eos> [Romantic music playing] And do you, sir, take Robin to be your lawfully wedded wife?<eos> Sí.<eos> And do you, Robin, take Carlos as your lawfully wedded husband?<eos> I-I do.
Do you have any toilet paper? !<eos> What is happening?<eos> - Why did you use your sleeves?<eos> Why didn't you just use your socks?<eos> I did. Okay?
No matter what happens. Yeah, yeah.<eos> - You understand?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> All right, listen to me, my sweet little matryoshka doll, I love you, baby, and I'm gonna prove to you once and for all that I'm a real man, a-a...<eos> Nate, you... you doing vertical video?
- [sighs] You do?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> You're afraid I'm gonna cheat.<eos> - [sighs] - I swear to you that is not gonna happen, and I can say that for sure because I cheated on Courtney, and it was miserable.<eos> You did?
Plus, he kept asking what Valentine's room looked like.<eos> He was interested in Valentine's style?<eos> Fascinating...<eos> No, he thought I might have seen something that could help us find him.<eos> And did you?
War changes people.<eos> Sometimes they see things they can't unsee.<eos> Come home to find home's not there anymore.<eos> It changed.<eos> Or maybe they did.
It just looks like a wine glass.<eos> That wine glass saved your life.<eos> What if... what if I hadn't gotten the Cup out in time?<eos> - That demon...<eos> - But you did.
Oh, and I got to eat this bar that Caputo eats sometimes instead of food when he's really busy, and it wasn't that bad.<eos> Had this weird color, and he said I would probably have trouble pooping'.<eos> I need to get myself a yoga ball.<eos> Did you call the public library like I asked?<eos> -I... I did.
D... do y... you want a f... fucking c... coffee?<eos> Yes, thanks.<eos> Cost me 800 bucks.<eos> - Does it fit in your house?<eos> - Sure it does.
Sesmillo, read.<eos> 96 civil lawsuits against the police, 21 treated by paramedics, 2 cervical injuries.<eos> 567,000 euros in losses, complaints from 7 embassies and a man with a fractured hip.<eos> - We'll take responsibility but we got him.<eos> - No, Alfaro, we don't.
'Maybe your sins can be covered up in this lifetime.'<eos> But eventually, we all pay for our sins.<eos> - 'Violet.' - 'I love you.'<eos> - 'She said she loved me.'<eos> - Of course I do.
But eventually, we all pay for our sins.<eos> - 'Violet.' - 'I love you.'<eos> - 'She said she loved me.'<eos> - Of course I do.<eos> 'Of course I do.'
My choice.<eos> And I'm sorry.<eos> I'm alone in the world, Matthew.<eos> Do you know what that feels like?<eos> Of course you do.
Oh, you and I, we have very different ideas of fun.<eos> You can say whatever you want.<eos> - But I know you...<eos> - No, you don't.<eos> You don't, not anymore.
Sleep even better when he's dead.<eos> Uh, dead?<eos> Well, lethal injection, probably, although the electric chair is a possibility.<eos> New York doesn't have the death penalty.<eos> Yeah, but Delaware does.
I don't know what you expect from me... but we're finished here.<eos> Mr. Donovan.<eos> Vanessa.<eos> You asked me if I remember the art gallery.<eos> I do.
How do you know that?<eos> I went there.<eos> Busy boy.<eos> Oh, jeez. I thought it could work.<eos> I did.
No.<eos> Only if you let it.<eos> It explains everything.<eos> You knew all along.<eos> Yeah, I did.
They knew that Frank's team had to come to them.<eos> Fish in a barrel.<eos> So to speak.<eos> Only fish don't know they're gonna die.<eos> These men did.
- Our Holy of Holies.<eos> The Oculus viewing chamber, our most powerful window into past, present, and future.<eos> The source of all our information on the timeline.<eos> Why did I now know about this?<eos> No captain does.
Got it.<eos> Lindsay was last seen talking to the lead scumbag.<eos> The founder, Carver Cruz.<eos> So he was interrogated?<eos> Yep, but his lawyer did all the talking.
A few bad apples shouldn't paint us all in a bad light, now should it, ma'am?<eos> But it does paint you as suspects.<eos> Hey, look, just because we have a reputation as outlaws doesn't mean we had anything to do with a murder.<eos> You like being considered a criminal, don't you?<eos> Yeah, you do.
I came down there once with my pig, he had the flu.<eos> Flu's bad for pigs. But he's better now.<eos> You have a pig in your truck?<eos> Yeah.<eos> We all do.
You're not gonna be alone either.<eos> Thank you,<eos> Kara.<eos> She didn't deserve what happened to her.<eos> No, she did not.
Hey, she did just fine for 25 years.<eos> Or, she was really good at pretending.<eos> I know you think your mom is this heartless, narcissistic monster...<eos> - Your words...<eos> - Some days, I do too.
We fight.<eos> Kara, I'm tired of being the last.<eos> Tired of having lived.<eos> You, of all people, know how heavy it is to survive.<eos> I do.
You.<eos> I mean, it is your house.<eos> And I-I-I...<eos> I thought I-- that I might run into you here.<eos> Well, you did.
I didn't know. ls he all right?<eos> He'll never get over you, though.<eos> (sums) Do you want him to be happy?<eos> You know I do.<eos> Course I do.
And then... yank.<eos> It is going to be all right.<eos> You just have to tell the truth.<eos> They won't believe me.<eos> Nobody does.
Unfortunately, Steph, our list of Emile's known associates is over 12 years old.<eos> Unless you can recall something.<eos> Hey.<eos> Maybe we drag up all this old crap, and we don't find the shooter.<eos> Or maybe we do.
When was the last time you saw Tamika?<eos> I thought Tamika may have been at our fellowship dinner last night.<eos> Taco Mondays.<eos> We bring in a mostly Mexican menu so our Latino friends feel encouraged to join.<eos> - And many of them do.
I threw my back out at Pilates.<eos> It's killing me.<eos> I was trying to get extra bendy for my honeymoon with Brad, if you know what I mean.<eos> Well, you got a guy 15 years younger than you, so I think Bendy Bonnie knows what she's doing.<eos> Yeah, she does.
I can't move on, and why would I want to?<eos> Mia will come back.<eos> She's got a point, Mum.<eos> It's pretty hard trying to be normal when we know what we know.<eos> Stuff no-one else in the world does.
This guy is a dipshit.<eos> Right is right!<eos> Yeah!<eos> - I saved him!<eos> - You did!
Yeah, oh, yeah, I'm a person.<eos> Okay, well, let's take my helicopter to my yacht.<eos> Oh, don't you wanna hang out and see who wins?<eos> Uh, spoiler alert...<eos> My car does.
I think you like me as much as I like you.<eos> I do like you.<eos> But?<eos> I didn't say "but."<eos> Yeah, you did.
What if they're more than us?<eos> What?<eos> Do you believe them? Your patients.<eos> Just between you and me.<eos> - Yes, I do. - Hmm.
- Empty the register on the weekend.<eos> All right, no problem, son.<eos> How your mom feeling now?<eos> Oh, she doing good. She doing excellent. - Better?<eos> - She doing better.
I ain't say that.<eos> I told you to count what's off and you said it wasn't.<eos> That's you calling me a liar.<eos> Nah, all I did was tell you that...<eos> You... you did what?
- Hold on, hold on.<eos> In the corner now.<eos> I know you.<eos> Where'd you fight?<eos> - I didn't.
He is coming to kill us.<eos> You have got to give me back my power!<eos> I've got to save you!<eos> Do you remember that night?<eos> Um... Your father does.
Hello.<eos> Can you tell me your location?<eos> Hello?<eos> Whatever happens, trust me.<eos> I do.
And the city is prepared to change its mind, which makes this, we think, a very exciting time.<eos> This Sunday would be great.<eos> Gentlemen.<eos> Basie Skanks ain't got no pool.<eos> No. He doesn't.
Why?<eos> Because they'll never let you do this.<eos> [Laughs] The deacons don't run this church.<eos> You're right.<eos> God does.
- Aw. You weren't anything like Mama said.<eos> Nothing is.<eos> Did, um... did Faith ever come in here?<eos> She moved down to this neighborhood, right?<eos> She did.
Whatever I want.<eos> Don't you get it?<eos> This whole "You don't have any rights, Ray"?<eos> That's over, because you did screw up.<eos> You did.
- That's right.<eos> - Pastor Greenleaf?<eos> You must have an opinion on this.<eos> Oh, Lord, here we go.<eos> I don't, actually.
No.<eos> I'll deal with him, and I'll send him up here so y'all can make the peace man-to-man one last time.<eos> Oh. You do believe me, don't you?<eos> That's the thing.<eos> I do.
I'll deal with him, and I'll send him up here so y'all can make the peace man-to-man one last time.<eos> Oh. You do believe me, don't you?<eos> That's the thing.<eos> I do.<eos> I do.
And I don't want to.<eos> That's the whole problem.<eos> When I was a kid, my father would take a walk every night after dinner.<eos> We were never sure he was going to come back.<eos> One night, he just didn't.
It's all going to work out.<eos> You don't know that.<eos> You're right, I don't.<eos> But I'm going to do my very best to make sure you get to stay... if you want.<eos> Yeah, I do.
Are you home?<eos> Hank, I'm here.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Did you ring?<eos> Uh, yeah, I did.
- Thank you.<eos> Is that a new dress?<eos> Yeah, do you like it?<eos> Yeah,<eos> I do.
If... there's anything to suggest that... it wasn't a suicide.<eos> What, is this the part where you tell me you know someone who might have wanted him dead?<eos> Cops are generally interested in that kind of stuff.<eos> I don't know yet.<eos> And when you do?
And married me 24 hours after he did the stupid thing he did!<eos> He wanted to tell you, but I wouldn't let him.<eos> Not before you went into surgery. -So you knew?<eos> -Yes.<eos> Everyone did. Why-
Not before you went into surgery. -So you knew?<eos> -Yes.<eos> Everyone did. Why-<eos> - What does it matter now?<eos> It doesn't anymore.
Robert kicked him out and Paddy showed up at my place.<eos> So you're trying to get away from Paddy?<eos> Well, yeah.<eos> I don't want to feel sorry for him.<eos> But you do.
He was Jesus' earthly father.<eos> He, uh, dreamed a lot, and, well, in those dreams, he was visited by angels.<eos> And, uh, one day, an angel appeared to him and told him that he must take the Virgin Mary as his wife.<eos> Does everyone understand what--<eos> They do not.
- Well, he's gone now.<eos> - That's all that matters, right?<eos> Gone how?<eos> Your fa thinks you've killed him.<eos> So did I.
It doesn't change what his father did, but it shows that he learned.<eos> Now you must do for your father what he could not do for his.<eos> You need to forgive him.<eos> What good does my forgiveness<eos> - do him now?
You must escape.<eos> I won't do it.<eos> The Master cannot love. So he takes it from others, feeds upon it, along with their blood.<eos> I don't know if you can feel love, Quintus. But I can.<eos> And I do.
We just need to look for anomalies, anything that breaks the established communication patterns.<eos> You never rendered your opinion on Captain Rogers.<eos> - Who?<eos> - You know, Fet's new comrade-in-arms.<eos> Oh, yeah, I did.
Just talk to my lawyers.<eos> Okay, honey?<eos> Stand down.<eos> Did your C.I. know that warrant was fake?<eos> No, ma'am, he didn't.
Okay, honey?<eos> Stand down.<eos> Did your C.I. know that warrant was fake?<eos> No, ma'am, he didn't.<eos> None of the agents did, just me.
Please let me go get her.<eos> We're just taking you in, okay?<eos> You hit someone? !<eos> No, I didn't hit someone.<eos> How you doing, kiddo?
So why are you here?<eos> 'Cause Dad asked me to keep an eye on you.<eos> I've got information on these killings.<eos> Do you want it or not?<eos> Yeah, I do.
It's all right, sweetie.<eos> Let him carry you.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Hey.<eos> How you doing?
Alexa, there should be 14 new products at the new production presentation, but I only see 13 new products on this list.<eos> Why was this one removed?<eos> Mary said she needed it.<eos> Did she say for what?<eos> No, Otto, she didn't.
Where are the heartbeats coming from?<eos> You think it's easy being a woman in the drug business?<eos> I built this business up. I earned this money.<eos> And no Pritchard, living or dead, is gonna take that away from me.<eos> How you doing, Solly?
-Get down and hide.<eos> -Jhon, I don't--<eos> -Shit, Maritza,<eos> I don't have time to give you explanations.<eos> Just do it, all right?
Come in.<eos> So... this is how tuna fish feel.<eos> Minus the mercury.<eos> So did you make the tournament?<eos> Yeah, yeah, I did.
May I see your whole wardrobe?<eos> Yes, yes.<eos> Last autumn, your tailor made you a suit in this material.<eos> Do you remember it?<eos> Hmm, yes, I do.
She got pregnant, he didn't want to know.<eos> She never really talked about it.<eos> And then last year she put me in that school.<eos> My mom was afraid something might happen to her.<eos> And it did.
He'll look after you.<eos> I didn't have nowhere else to go.<eos> I didn't know how he was gonna react.<eos> If he'd even recognize her, after all these years.<eos> But he did.
Oh, yeah, yeah, but I-I am so sorry, you know?<eos> And... and all I can think of to say is...<eos> You sure look pretty after a 5k run.<eos> Do you know how long a 'k' is?<eos> Because I did not.
We're a family.<eos> Still, most people don't come that close to violence and remain unscathed.<eos> You seem to be handling it rather well.<eos> I don't have a choice, Detective.<eos> Your employees do.
One of those chairs shaped like a giant hand.<eos> You know? And I think... yeah... it would just fit through.<eos> Do we have a match on your dating app?<eos> Actually, yes.<eos> Yes, we do.
Set up a meet.<eos> I need her to sign some paperwork.<eos> Hey, how did things go with Tariq the other night?<eos> He didn't show.<eos> Ghost did.
After hearing your conversation this morning and knowing how much you miss the kids, it seemed like the right thing to do.<eos> I had good intentions.<eos> I appreciate you taking care of Tariq's record, but you should ask me before you go over there.<eos> I don't need to ask for your permission, Jamie.<eos> Oh, yes, you do.
If a member of the House Intelligence Committee chooses to share information with me, he's at liberty to do so.<eos> Our conversation was in confidence.<eos> I don't feel comfortable with this.<eos> The Congressman is just as frustrated as you are, and he spoke to me because he wants to help.<eos> And so do I, General.
See, Hassan, this type of behavior... this suggests to us something we call "avoidance and transference".<eos> It's what makes me think you're lying.<eos> Of course he's lying. Look at him.<eos> If you hadn't seen the Carsons, why didn't you just tell us?<eos> I did!
It's what makes me think you're lying.<eos> Of course he's lying. Look at him.<eos> If you hadn't seen the Carsons, why didn't you just tell us?<eos> I did!<eos> I did!
Never mind, Dylan. Okay.<eos> All right, bye.<eos> You need me to break you out of here?<eos> I can totally do it, I mean, I've studied how to do it.<eos> No, I-I don't.
And you flip all of them.<eos> They should all reboot.<eos> Got it.<eos> Once that's done, you power up the cannon. - The breach should stabilize.<eos> - And what if it doesn't?
Every black girl that went to college likes Drake.<eos> He just really gets us.<eos> I'm not a dumb bitch!<eos> I never said you were.<eos> No, you didn't.
Is the killer a simple man with a family pushed to breaking point.<eos> Suffice to say that discovering their identity has brought me no pleasure.<eos> None at all.<eos> - The killer pleads self-defence?<eos> - They do.
Your kiln had exploded.<eos> You thought you were going color-blind.<eos> I just wanted to give you a win.<eos> So Kenny Loggins never even saw my painting?<eos> No, he did!
For what?<eos> Some Health Department thing.<eos> I don't know.<eos> _<eos> How you doing, Lex?
Jim banks, EIS.<eos> You take the lead. Not sure who these people trust less, doctors or cops.<eos> Atlanta PD.<eos> You speak English?<eos> Yes. I do.
- WOMAN:<eos> Open up! - Today...<eos> We're getting out!<eos> Your job was to find a spot where they would not see us taking the child.<eos> And they didn't!
Who says I'm trying to look prettier?<eos> Maybe I want to look smart or kind or funny.<eos> You like him, don't you?<eos> Maybe.<eos> Do you?
Wait, what?<eos> She's working with the chief.<eos> - What?<eos> No. - Yes.<eos> No. That doesn't even...
Son, I found him.<eos> - I found Leo.<eos> - That's great, Dad.<eos> You know I never doubted you.<eos> Sure you did.
You said I should start a life here, right?<eos> And Zoom's over there, and we're over here, so there's nothing to worry about.<eos> There's always something to worry about.<eos> Okay, well, you said Barry and them are good people and I should get to know them.<eos> - I did.
And you know a lot about yams.<eos> Oh, sexy!<eos> And... ..you make me feel... ..better about myself.<eos> I like that.<eos> Yeah, so do I.
Even before all this happened, I was changing and he was staying the same.<eos> - He wants us to have kids.<eos> - Now?<eos> I don't know, but I don't even want to think about kids.<eos> Of course you don't.
What do you want?<eos> Well, I wanted a wife who wasn't a lying, cheating sack of shit, but I guess that's impossible, so...<eos> I'll settle for an explanation.<eos> I want to know why you think I owe you anything.<eos> You don't.
I can help.<eos> What do you know about guns?<eos> You aim and squeeze and your target dies.<eos> How do I know I can I trust you?<eos> You don't yet.
So, assuming we can get him face to face, why doesn't he just arrest us?<eos> Because if we don't come back, our cell releases incriminating photos of Sabine, and she'll be shot for treason.<eos> - What photos?<eos> - I told him we had photos - of her fraternizing with me.<eos> - But we don't.
The midwife betrayed you.<eos> What made you so cruel?<eos> Why would you bring a child into this world?<eos> Don't you know?<eos> Oh, you don't, do you?
Start by repairing Hartley's gauntlets.<eos> That's about as good a first step as any.<eos> - I got some parts for it.<eos> You don't know how to stop a Time Wraith?<eos> None of us do.
So, what do you think?<eos> I love it all.<eos> Oh, I am so glad.<eos> So, why does it look like you actually don't love it?<eos> I really do.
So, why are we at the opening of... what is this?<eos> ... the NuTunes Music Fest?<eos> Obviously you didn't see Gawker this morning.<eos> Oh, the Jennifer Jones post?<eos> I did.
Yeah, I was, okay?<eos> But then those texts just popped up, and they were not even the worst ones.<eos> Yeah, but you still sent them to Gawker.<eos> Well, Stacey deserves to know the truth.<eos> Yeah, she does now.
Not when your first book was only somewhat successful.<eos> I can't afford to take another year off to write something on spec, and I don't know how to get another deal without an agent.<eos> Maybe I should give up.<eos> Maybe I don't have another book in me.<eos> Of course you do.
Yeah. It's a little bit extravagant, don't you think?<eos> Not to mention a blatant disregard for public safety.<eos> _<eos> - I lo... I love it so much.<eos> - Of course you do.
That's her.<eos> Oh, why is she licking the bagels and putting them back?<eos> I don't know. I wish that there was some answer that I could give you to that question that made sense.<eos> Well, don't they say that all press is good press?<eos> Yeah. Do they really?
Did you have a date?<eos> Of course not.<eos> When was the last time I had a date?<eos> But you said you had plans.<eos> I did.
Kidding!<eos> Believing.<eos> Hi, Adam.<eos> Hey, little one.<eos> How you doing?
She's 14.<eos> He's a father-figure to her.<eos> They, um, have a relationship.<eos> We don't.<eos> They do, but we, uh, don't.
Let me try something.<eos> Listen to the sound of my voice.<eos> You love prison.<eos> You want to go back to prison.<eos> No, I don't.
Okay.<eos> And look at that.<eos> I thought this was going to be hard, but it turns out ning up a date is easy.<eos> Don't I need your number or something?<eos> Yeah. No, yeah, definitely you do.
You telling me you've been hauling this secret around for 18 years?<eos> Never said anything to anybody?<eos> That's right.<eos> You don't believe me, Gil?<eos> No, I do.
Yeah.<eos> People love a good roped ass.<eos> - Hmm. - A well-roped ass.<eos> Yeah.<eos> My ex-wife sure did.
I think it's fine.<eos> I don't like the figure of the fig.<eos> It's key that we choose a tree we have here.<eos> If we stick to shooting the spot here under a tree.<eos> We do.
[maracas rattling]<eos> They sound amazing, baby.<eos> - Dad.<eos> - Yeah. - Did you get to see the ashes?<eos> - Yes, I did.
I want him to see me on my feet. For him to know that I've beat the count.<eos> Round two.<eos> You really think he's the devil?<eos> You saw what he did to me.<eos> Yeah, I did.
He is a false prophet.<eos> If we don't stop him, the devil will reign for a thousand years.<eos> You really believe that?<eos> That that man is the devil and that you have to stop him, no matter what?<eos> Yes, I do.
What can I help you with? - Philip Jessup.<eos> - [Door closes]<eos> Wish I had something.<eos> Look at that.<eos> Now you do.
- She's thinking about it.<eos> She'll say yes.<eos> My point is I might have to go to church so I can atone for my sins. Mm.<eos> You have to believe in God for that.<eos> Or maybe you do now.
Stop.<eos> Fine.<eos> You're welcome for saving your relationship.<eos> I thought you stopped drinking.<eos> I did.
So, you want to change your life, or are you happy just to stay Annalise Keating's bitch?<eos> Frank.<eos> Just tell me.<eos> We found her.<eos> Well, Oliver did.
I guess this is supposed to prove she was the shooter, huh?<eos> Well, 300,000 tweets say yes.<eos> The department hasn't even confirmed the victim yet. Ugh.<eos> Louise likes her.<eos> Of course she does.
I don't understand.<eos> I don't think I ever have.<eos> - I know.<eos> - Harry!<eos> Jimmy does.
Thank you for that.<eos> It ain't my fault, or my problem.<eos> For the record, you do see that you're doing wrong, though?<eos> I don't need your help.<eos> But if I hypothetically did...
Tad's dead.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> I'm a big note taker.<eos> He was on a spiritual quest around the world to find himself.<eos> Sadly, he did...
You're not going anywhere.<eos> God.<eos> I'm sorry you missed your plane.<eos> You like your new job?<eos> - Yeah, I do.
Where are you taking her?<eos> That was the last time I saw her.<eos> They sent me on assignment that night.<eos> It wasn't till I got to bangkok that I heard rumors about them trying to turn a Hexenbiest into a warrior, but nobody told me if it worked.<eos> It did.
- You talked to Jerry? - Yeah.<eos> Hey, you... you don't happen to have a corkscrew on you, do you?<eos> Me?<eos> No. No, I don't... that's... he does.<eos> We do at our house, but not...
And don't talk about this to anyone.<eos> The sons of Tal Jiza will become soldiers in the Army of the Caliphate.<eos> I thought this wasn't my fight. I was wrong.<eos> Come back, okay?<eos> If you don't...
You... you don't know me, okay? And I've been working on myself, so I'm gonna let that go, even though you're saying something about my boys.<eos> It's about your boys all right.<eos> It's about your boys sucking.<eos> Who says that? !<eos> I just did!
Fair enough.<eos> John is quick to invoke your father. But he's not the one most like Robert.<eos> Here's your money, Dad.<eos> How did you pay?<eos> I didn't.
- I could get them information about the campus... entrances, exits, how many guards.<eos> The more they talked about this attack, the more I knew what I was doing was wrong.<eos> But when I started questioning them, they tried to kill me and I got away.<eos> They never cared about me.<eos> No, they didn't.
But when I started questioning them, they tried to kill me and I got away.<eos> They never cared about me.<eos> No, they didn't.<eos> I do.<eos> Your mother does.
Now, you would think that these brilliant legal minds would know how to bluff. But I could spot their tells from my apartment.<eos> A nervous knee, a finger twitch.<eos> Handler didn't blink... just like you.<eos> It's true the world doesn't know where my son is, but neither do you.<eos> Only I do.
They didn't say anything.<eos> Well, they don't know anything.<eos> Well, they know about beasts, so...<eos> But DHS doesn't.<eos> Only Hill did.
What now?<eos> I saw wagons filled with those barrels on a road that doesn't lead to Cambulac.<eos> And you know every road to Cambulac?<eos> It's my home.<eos> Of course I do.
- You're supposed to be resting.<eos> I can manage.<eos> I was just trying to help.<eos> Grace, come on, we're leaving.<eos> Gordon, don't.
We'll try not to fall off anything else.<eos> If you must, let me know in advance, I'll hold the front page.<eos> Did you just come here to tell me off?<eos> You didn't say what you're going to be doing about that Sergei story?<eos> No... I didn't.
Thank you.<eos> Did you make that dress yourself?<eos> Yes.<eos> Where did you find the pattern?<eos> I didn't.
Then, if somebody finds him, they won't be looking for us and that might buy us some time.<eos> That's... actually... a smart idea.<eos> All right.<eos> This is all I could find.<eos> I did the feet.
Well, I'm interested in reading contemporary social sciences.<eos> No, look, how do blind people read big books?<eos> They said, "They don't."<eos> Anyway, um, I'll sort it out, so thanks for your advice.<eos> They don't.
I'm screwed either way.<eos> It's not fair.<eos> Hill set you up, Braxton set you up.<eos> Come on, it doesn't matter.<eos> Yes, it does, Vincent.
The people who own it probably don't even realise they are trafficked, they probably were perfectly nice to her. The problem is...<eos> How can they not know?<eos> They don't pay 'em!<eos> No, they do!<eos> The biscuit factory does.
I left it on the doorstep with a card inside.<eos> From you.<eos> It was expensive, something I knew he'd like.<eos> Racing cars.<eos> And he did.
you have to be careful. I know.<eos> I will.<eos> But we need answers, right?<eos> Yeah.<eos> We do.
You came out of the Phoenix Stone, but you thought you were still inside of it.<eos> Everybody understands.<eos> That's pretty generous considering I just stabbed your pregnant girlfriend in the chest.<eos> Yeah.<eos> The Hellstone does a number on you.
- We'll see.<eos> - That's what you said about horseback riding.<eos> I wanna ride a horse.<eos> - I thought you wanted to learn how to make movies.<eos> - I do.
Nor should you.<eos> Those words will only mean "I'm not listening.<eos> "I'm not taking accountability, and whatever I did, I will just do it again."<eos> If you truly want to apologize...<eos> I do.
Oh, it's just a fender bender, right?<eos> Nothing too serious.<eos> I hope you're right.<eos> These things happen all the time.<eos> No, not to me they don't.
Yeah.<eos> They were... They were looking for an apartment. She said they found one.<eos> - Did they leave an address?<eos> - No.<eos> No, they didn't.
- Dr. Grey told me to come find you.<eos> - Really?<eos> Meredith actually asked for me, or did she just want Neuro in general?<eos> I... I don't remember.<eos> Yeah, you do.
It's Navabi!<eos> Open the door.<eos> N-A-V-A-B-I. Open the door.<eos> Open the door.<eos> Do it!
No, I'm upset, all right? I tried to surprise you with a nice anniversary party.<eos> Yeah, you surprised me, all right.<eos> It obviously didn't please you.<eos> I don't want to talk about this right now, Evan, it's late.<eos> Well, I do.
I'll start sorting the mail right away... discreetly.<eos> Also...<eos> See what you can find out about Mark Peterson.<eos> He claimed to have a meeting with Kate today.<eos> He did.
She was pregnant.<eos> She told you?<eos> No.<eos> But when I read about her murder, I-I realized she didn't want to give birth to a new baby till she knew that the one she gave up had everything he needed.<eos> I did.
Yeah.<eos> I wanted to adopt, too.<eos> What?<eos> I-I thought you didn't want kids.<eos> Of course I do.
He wants to shame me.<eos> Disgrace my name.<eos> Would he be justified in his quest?<eos> I want you to know who it is you're protecting.<eos> I do.
What did Plover say in the book? Come on.<eos> First of all, what's-his-name didn't write it.<eos> Plover.<eos> Christopher Plover.<eos> The girl did.
Special Agent Harris.<eos> Mrs. Finch. May I come in?<eos> Thank you for having me over.<eos> I assume if you knew anything about Brian's whereabouts, you would tell us, yes?<eos> I don't.
I should've just stayed home, like I planned.<eos> Ada, your former best friend doesn't know when to close her mouth or her legs.<eos> Does she, Ronald?<eos> No.<eos> No, she doesn't.
Look, Alison, I know that you have a business to run, but this is evidence.<eos> Which I gave you.<eos> Now I'd like my tablet back, please.<eos> We're also talking about the wife of one of my officers here. - He's got a point.<eos> - No, actually, he doesn't.
That's about it.<eos> - Well, will your friends be at the party?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> - But they don't know about you and Rebecca being there.<eos> Yes, they do.
There's a whole lot he could've done, like not frame his brother for someone's murder.<eos> I know.<eos> But you still have the gun, right?<eos> So, it's all gonna be okay.<eos> Yeah, I do.
He's pretty great, huh?<eos> He's a very... interesting young man.<eos> - You don't like him.<eos> - No, no. I do.<eos> I do.
He says it's discretionary.<eos> Okay. Well, tell that to the cops.<eos> That bullet could put away the guy who's responsible for this, so...<eos> Speaking as the person who almost got her ass sued off, I'm not diving into a difficult procedure without having any experience.<eos> Well, good thing I do, then.
And if you don't, I'm already dead, so...<eos> Can we page him again, please?<eos> Sorry about that.<eos> Something came up. Dr. Harris, I was starting to worry you weren't gonna show up.<eos> Ready to do this?
Um...<eos> Look. Do you want to know what I would do if I were you?<eos> I don't want to know.<eos> - No, I want to know.<eos> No, I don't.
♪ Okay, we're not staying.<eos> - Just be a minute.<eos> - Oh, thank God you're here.<eos> This is Will, Sean's son.<eos> - How you doing, Will?
Shut that door behind you.<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> Debbie!<eos> How'd you know I was here?<eos> I didn't.
What if it's something that used to be important back then, but isn't a very big deal now?<eos> You know? Like eyeglasses.<eos> Eyeglasses?<eos> Did you know the first pair of eyeglasses was invented in the 13th century?<eos> - I did not.
She's been nominated for the Carnegie Medal for children's fiction.<eos> Are you ready?<eos> Him and his little friend better not mess up the house while we're out.<eos> They do know that, don't they?<eos> Course they do.
They?<eos> How many more are there?<eos> More than we can survive.<eos> Do you see them, master?<eos> I do.
Alright, you naked assholes, time to pick on someone your own size.<eos> You want some?<eos> You feel that?<eos> Huh?<eos> Do you?
Veronica's family tree, likes and dislikes?<eos> Oh, you got that wrong.<eos> - Where?<eos> - "Doesn't like beef-drizzled nachos."<eos> Uh...yes, she does!
Any complications?<eos> No. Send the car.<eos> On its way.<eos> Make sure the driver has my documents.<eos> He does.
Yes, of course.<eos> He's downstairs right now.<eos> - I see.<eos> - And, yes, I said "he".<eos> - Yes, you did.
He's downstairs right now.<eos> - I see.<eos> - And, yes, I said "he".<eos> - Yes, you did.<eos> - Yes, I did.
Good evening.<eos> Please, take no aggressive action, or your friend's life is over.<eos> Mr Brock?<eos> - What do you want here?<eos> - The same thing you do, Miss Fletcher.
Itzpa serves me well.<eos> A true daughter of Xibalba.<eos> She says you have something special for me.<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, of course we do.
Keep them here, no matter what.<eos> Okay.<eos> Hey.<eos> Okay, do you remember before, when I told you that I wanted to die?<eos> I did, for a very, very long time.
Uh, that would mean that the window was closed during the murder, and opened after.<eos> Which means the break-in could be staged?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Have you talked to the building manager?<eos> Yes, I did.
I didn't even know it was a thing.<eos> Absolutely not a thing.<eos> And if it was a thing, it's over.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - How we doing?
I'm someone with no agenda apart from to help you.<eos> Someone you can talk to.<eos> I'm tired of talking.<eos> I'm sure. But it's very important for you to have someone you can feel at ease with.<eos> I do.
- Anything you...<eos> - I know all that.<eos> You have the right to an attorney.<eos> - I don't need one.<eos> - Yes, you do.
- Depends.<eos> - On..?<eos> - Ah, a lot of things.<eos> - Does Cassie know you're back?<eos> Yeah, she does, actually.
What did you tell him?<eos> I told him that I would give you the message.<eos> That you'd give me the message?<eos> Rachel, you know there's no way in hell I am ever gonna turn on them, right? - You know that.<eos> - Yes, I do.
- Up close, I could tell.<eos> - Yeah, I got that too.<eos> As if it were any of your business.<eos> - So you believe his story?<eos> - Of course I do.
We have waited a long time for our day of reckoning.<eos> Children died in LaPier.<eos> Call that justice?<eos> Our children died too.<eos> As Galen LaPier did yesterday.
Well, looks like I found her.<eos> I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> You sure as hell do. Because you planted that goddamn thing.<eos> You have any proof?<eos> No, you don't.
Look, Donna, he may not be my enemy and you may not be my enemy. But as long as we're in this trial run, I'm not trusting you with anything.<eos> That's my boy.<eos> Jessica Pearson.<eos> I wasn't aware we had an appointment today.<eos> We don't.
I don't care.<eos> All right?<eos> I need your help.<eos> Mike, you are asking me to perjure myself and I don't even know who you are.<eos> Yes, you do.
Your Honor...<eos> Mr. Specter is within his rights.<eos> Mr. Kirkwood can take the stand.<eos> How did you know he'd testify?<eos> I didn't until just now.
- Yeah, so were you.<eos> - You were great.<eos> She was better.<eos> Everything she said was true and the jury knows it.<eos> No they don't.
I don't know, Donna, but I can't afford to be wrong about this.<eos> Then let me as you a question:<eos> Why aren't you talking to Dr. Agard about this?<eos> - How do you know about her?<eos> - Because I do.
Should either of you betray the other, they will destroy your families.<eos> You'll want some time to think it over.<eos> I do hope you see the merit in my proposal.<eos> We do so love a wedding.<eos> Yes, we do.
You'll want some time to think it over.<eos> I do hope you see the merit in my proposal.<eos> We do so love a wedding.<eos> Yes, we do.<eos> Yes, we do.
I do hope you see the merit in my proposal.<eos> We do so love a wedding.<eos> Yes, we do.<eos> Yes, we do.<eos> Yes, we do.
- Affirmative.<eos> Yet you turned down admission.<eos> Did your "human emotions" play a role in that decision?<eos> No sir.<eos> They did not.
A large faction on Tellar Prime argues against our government's stance on this matter.<eos> And I, for one, am part of that faction.<eos> I believe one of your greatest human writers once said...<eos> "A lady's 'verily' is as potent as a lord's."<eos> That he did, sir.
Yeah, I'm... I'm not gonna pretend it isn't.<eos> You been to see your mama?<eos> I-I hear she's got financial troubles. No.<eos> No, you, remember what that was like.<eos> I do.
Yeah.<eos> Leslie should've settled this thing a long time ago.<eos> There are a lot of us who think there need to be changes.<eos> But the school board is split on Leslie, and she's got a lot of donors who like her.<eos> A lot of people don't.
What I feel...<eos> Do you feel guilty about anything else?<eos> You know how, um... my mom gave me up once?<eos> I know why she did, but I, um, never really got it.<eos> Now I do.
Really?<eos> Yeah, you're... Hey, you're both beautiful women.<eos> For your ages, you're both beautiful women.<eos> And, you know, if I get snippy with you sometimes, it's just because I don't think you like me. - Oh.<eos> - Oh, no, I don't.
The what?<eos> Your wife was almost two months pregnant, Mr. Jacobs, despite her tubal ligation.<eos> You didn't know, did you?<eos> No.<eos> I didn't.
So you killed her?<eos> We had a deal.<eos> I miss something?<eos> You already close another case?<eos> As a matter of fact, Detective, you did.
Absolutely.<eos> I'm gonna step out for a bit.<eos> Mr. Caputo, did you hear about last night?<eos> The white girl is all kind of messed up and Crazy is even crazier!<eos> - I did.
And then everything dies anyway, right?"<eos> "But you just keep doing it."<eos> Washington showed me this when I started the garden.<eos> She thought I'd like it.<eos> I do.
If she deserved to die?<eos> No!<eos> No!<eos> There were conflicting reports with some key witnesses claiming she had a weapon.<eos> Man, like hell she did!
I didn't want to lose my license.<eos> Even if I had reported it, it wouldn't have mattered.<eos> There's very little follow-up in the system.<eos> You know that.<eos> Yeah, I do.
You know why.<eos> You promised.<eos> You did this to him, not me.<eos> He has a family.<eos> So do you.
You're using me to send a message to the girl?<eos> Kirsten: He was told things that I was meant to hear and then he was killed.<eos> Black Sedan.<eos> Can't make out the plates.<eos> But maybe you did, Cameron.
No.<eos> Cameron?<eos> Cameron?<eos> Please... tell me you got the license plate number.<eos> No, I didn't.
Why?<eos> Maggie: I didn't know anything about this chamber.<eos> This is your lab!<eos> How could you not know?<eos> - 'Cause I didn't.
Everything all right?<eos> Yeah, I just had after-school stuff<eos> - Like what?<eos> - Joy.<eos> He doesn't do stuff.
We'd quarrel and we'd have sex.<eos> Or as Diana would say provocatively we'd fuck.<eos> - And it works.<eos> - The guy you were coming onto all afternoon.<eos> - Until it doesn't.
- Let her in.<eos> - Actually, why not just come in now?<eos> - Okay.<eos> Whoa. Hey!<eos> - Hey, how you doing?
Go downstairs and find that safe.<eos> - You got a text about some rapist.<eos> - I really need to answer that.<eos> Please.<eos> You just did.
I didn't know if I'd ever forgive him.<eos> - But you did.<eos> - It took time.<eos> A lot.<eos> - But I did.
- We need to take another run at Jon.<eos> I already interviewed him.<eos> Twice.<eos> Most likely pitching softballs.<eos> The hell I did!
Uh... maybe, yeah.<eos> You know, she's a-an actual lawyer or whatever.<eos> You know, you do that a lot.<eos> You sort of trail off with a little insult under your breath, and you think that I don't hear it.<eos> Well, I do.
Fine.<eos> What aisle is the Drano?<eos> Do you remember when we met?<eos> Yep.<eos> I do.
I mean actually fucked up.<eos> Why do you think that?<eos> 'Cause I wanted him to die.<eos> - No, you didn't.<eos> - No, I did.
It's up to me now.<eos> My husband is gone.<eos> The Caliphate that killed him thinks that all the things he stood for are gone, too.<eos> But they don't have the power to make that happen.<eos> Only we do.
Weller's the snake, I'm the dog, Reade's the rat.<eos> And Zapata, you're the pig.<eos> - Shut up.<eos> - I didn't say it.<eos> The Zodiac did.
All right, give us the address.<eos> No one likes a tattletale.<eos> I didn't tell Camila, I swear.<eos> - This time, I won't leave a mark. - I swear!<eos> Please don't!
Exactly the same thing.<eos> Coast Guard didn't find a body.<eos> Said the current must have taken him.<eos> Her story feels off. You still don't think she's connected to Carter's disappearance?<eos> No, I don't.
How about meeting you?<eos> Clear the area!<eos> Come on, let's move out!<eos> What happened to you?<eos> I didn't...
Perks of being called a player in the story of the century.<eos> So can't take me off the grid.<eos> It's good to see you, Caleb. How you feeling, buddy?<eos> Good to see you, too.<eos> - How you doing, man?
I want order.<eos> Apologies to the court, Your Honor.<eos> Joanna Masters thought that Sadie was having an affair with her husband, Roger, but she was wrong, and so were you.<eos> I have absolutely no idea what you're talking about.<eos> Sure, you do.
Even when you make mistakes, I am always going to love you.<eos> All the hard work you did.<eos> And it is even better than I could have imagined.<eos> You really like it?<eos> Ohh, of course I do.
Wynonna's on her way.<eos> She's the best chance we got.<eos> OK, just please, please just trust me, Chrissy.<eos> Geez.<eos> OK, I do.
Well, the first thing would be to get them clear of the confined space.<eos> Out into the dry air.<eos> Yes, yes.<eos> Do you love her?<eos> Yes, I do.
Felix's real sister.<eos> Real sister, how?<eos> We have the same father.<eos> I thought you didn't have a father.<eos> Well, I didn't, but now I do.
You can't do this.<eos> I need him. He needs to pay for what he did to Niki.<eos> I know, alright?<eos> I know about Helsinki.<eos> Did Beth?
Raised by Aldous Leekie. Sent off to boarding school.<eos> Topside...<eos> Helsinki?<eos> You weren't supposed to know about Helsinki.<eos> Well, I do.
Susan's given up on LEDA.<eos> But age has dulled her ambition.<eos> You and I are still young.<eos> Don't you want to live?<eos> I do now, yes.
You all right?<eos> - Let me...<eos> Let me help you with this. - I'm sorry.<eos> I don't know what came over me.<eos> Oh, well, I do.
I just thought I was dead out there.<eos> And I got to the shore, and I just passed out.<eos> It's the bridge on Windsor.<eos> You... you know how to get there?<eos> We do.
Some crazy shit, huh?<eos> You probably think I'm a lunatic.<eos> Come on. Let's go figure out what to do with you.<eos> I didn't want to come back here.<eos> I don't...
No, look up where rainbows end.<eos> Hold on.<eos> Before we touch the computer, we need to take this course first.<eos> It's called "Mavis Beacon's introduction..."<eos> I just did a search for Cattleman's Ranch.
Thank you.<eos> I knew you'd see it my way.<eos> Enough about this.<eos> Did Batman show you my proposal for the new delivery terms?<eos> Oh, yes, he did.
That's how you know what stuff is.<eos> See?<eos> This is water.<eos> I fill it before I go out.<eos> I don't do bar prices.
You can say what Operation:<eos> Project is.<eos> All right, we can work on our...<eos> - Oh, God, did you hear that?<eos> - Of course I did.
Well, if we didn't do it when the Seahawks won the Super Bowl, why would we do it now?<eos> Good point.<eos> You know, I see you telling your daughters you love them just about every day.<eos> I do it as much as I can.<eos> - Maybe I do it too much.
I mean, they had to think that you were gonna help with this mess somehow or they wouldn't have committed so much manpower to keeping you alive.<eos> And I never felt "stuck" with you, for what it's worth.<eos> Axel.<eos> You know what I'm saying.<eos> Yeah, I do.
So, until we know where we're going or what we're doing, we can at least agree to hunker down someplace for a couple of days, yeah?<eos> Then what do you suggest?<eos> You got a bomb shelter in your back pocket?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Maybe I do.
Gina told us everything.<eos> You found her?<eos> Did you find Daisy, too?<eos> Her real name is Sheila. Sheila Woods.<eos> And, yes, we did.
Okay.<eos> You have it?<eos> Do I have... ?<eos> My schedule.<eos> Oh, sir, I-I do, but, uh...
I'm not the obvious choice, then.<eos> You and I both know that's not true.<eos> You don't talk to her?<eos> No.<eos> I don't.
No.<eos> I don't.<eos> You?<eos> No...<eos> I don't.
Tick-tock.<eos> Forgiven? Or not?<eos> Yeah, I forgive her! OK?<eos> I forgive her!<eos> No, you don't.
Disappeared the night before the trial.<eos> People say foul play was involved. Wait.<eos> How can August be a revenant,<eos> I mean, if Wyatt didn't kill him?<eos> Oh, but he did. Most definitely.
It helps you determine which risks are worth taking.<eos> I think that's something for both you and Wally to take to heart.<eos> I met your little red friend tonight.<eos> Aren't you going to ask me if I killed him?<eos> You didn't.
(knock on door) Excuse me.<eos> - Hey, Rosie, I... - Hey.<eos> Oh.<eos> I'm sorry. I didn't... I didn't know I was interrupting.<eos> No, no, you didn't. No, no, no.
Mira.<eos> Look at this place, huh?<eos> Same bar, same lights.<eos> Hasn't changed much since your father was running games up in back at those tables, huh?<eos> Some things never do.
Um, well, that's the stuff that you get to take home once the raid is done, right?<eos> We take home criminals. That's our raid swag.<eos> You better give us back that vest.<eos> Oh, come on, Villa. Now, did I ask you to return the autopsy swag?<eos> No. Did I?
See the break at the scaphoid bone?<eos> It's not a cut made by the sharp teeth of an adult pig, but by the surgical saw of a human.<eos> That hand was cut off by the killer.<eos> Why would the killer need the hand?<eos> He didn't.
You hear me?<eos> He's a hero!<eos> You really mean that, Dad?<eos> You think I'm a hero?<eos> Of course I do.
Don't... don't... don't hurt him.<eos> I'm going to give you to the count of five to tell me where the key to the boat is.<eos> - One.<eos> - He doesn't have it.<eos> Who does?
- I mean, not at this point of my life.<eos> Well, yay!<eos> Your body's working.<eos> I do know one thing, though.<eos> That... ginger tablets don't do anything for nausea.
Ugh, yeah.<eos> I tell you, if I could not get there in a minivan, then I wasn't going.<eos> - Right.<eos> - You know the drill.<eos> Indeed I do, yeah.
Every time Amy Schumer talks about her vagina, I lose my fucking mind.<eos> Do you miss your friends?<eos> I don't have any friends.<eos> I don't know if I ever did.<eos> You do now.
And do you know the name of that company?<eos> Google, right?<eos> You said it at the beginning of the story.<eos> You're right.<eos> I did that wrong.
That won't be cheap. Jeez, man.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> That sucks.<eos> So, where did you sleep last night?<eos> I did not.
Uh, Keith, Northeast Regional, again.<eos> Jack told us we would be selling directly to businesses.<eos> - He did? - Doug.<eos> I'm shadowing Keith.<eos> - Yes, he did.
I hope you can see it with new eyes.<eos> What if I can't do that?<eos> Then your son will choose between his family and the truth that they don't want to understand.<eos> I want to understand.<eos> I do.
Marjorie and I broke up.<eos> That's terrible.<eos> - Do you need a tissue?<eos> - No, I'm fine.<eos> Yeah, no, you do.
We're working as hard as we can.<eos> There's a little girl working on the problem right now, and apparently, she's incredibly smart and funny.<eos> You got it figured out, babe?<eos> Babe, I have no idea what any of this means.<eos> Heidi, yes, you do.
You look a bit tired.<eos> I haven't been sleeping much.<eos> Angie Tribeca?<eos> Nurse Lowboobs.<eos> How you doing since the coma, baby?
I think we owe you guys a trip.<eos> Always wanted to visit the postcard museum. Thank you.<eos> My pleasure.<eos> I wonder if they sell postcards in the gift shop.<eos> We don't.
Julian's safe.<eos> You'll surely sleep easy tonight.<eos> Do you like her?<eos> Bonnie?<eos> And what if I did?
Good to see you.<eos> Aye.<eos> What are you doing here, Alastair?<eos> Sal not give you my message?<eos> She did, aye.
- Yes?<eos> - Is he with you?<eos> - No.<eos> - Have you tried calling him?<eos> Obviously I did.
And.<eos> What they thought about Monsieur Duval?<eos> Did you have a good reputation?<eos> -What do you mean?<eos> -What did your colleagues about you?
Like you don't understand me or...<eos> Even believe in me.<eos> It sucks.<eos> What?<eos> Of course I do.
You just killed her.<eos> - No, we didn't.<eos> - I left my car keys inside.<eos> What?<eos> Yes, you did.
I...<eos> I don't know.<eos> Where is he?<eos> I don't know!<eos> None of us do.
They raise the value of your home?<eos> They combine elegance and efficiency?<eos> Hmm. Makes no sense.<eos> Should work.<eos> Well, it doesn't.
I thought you were upset, but then I was like,<eos> "if he's upset, then why is he getting me all these pizzas?"<eos> It was a prank.<eos> I don't get it.<eos> Nobody did.
No! No, no, no, no, no!<eos> Guess that's my exit.<eos> You didn't just now use the...<eos> Oh, God you did.<eos> You did.
I never meant to endanger any firefighters, any civilians.<eos> Not even Supergirl.<eos> So, you figured if you booby-trapped a satellite, then your Kryptonite would kill Non just in case you went to go check on it?<eos> It didn't work exactly as planned.<eos> It never does with you!
You guys were high.<eos> I said, "Oh, no." I said, "No.<eos> "We found it.<eos> "Get on a plane and get down here. We found The Light."<eos> And we did.
Why would they do that?<eos> Weaponizing alien abilities for military purposes.<eos> What do they do to humans?<eos> Does Clark know where it is?<eos> No. No one does.
I tried.<eos> There's some pretty epic force fields around those satellites at the moment.<eos> You're always 10 steps ahead, Max.<eos> I know you have a plan.<eos> Of course I do.
And all you're doing is betraying her.<eos> I was with Astra in her final moments.<eos> We forgave each other, we paid respect to our blood bonds.<eos> - She didn't want this.<eos> - Of course she did.
It'll ride the wave without anybody knowing a thing.<eos> - I have one question for you, Max.<eos> - Shoot.<eos> The earrings, how did you know I would wear them?<eos> I didn't.
Carmen was going to blow up my adoption by telling my social workers everything Brandon and I had done, and I figured if for whatever reason she didn't, - that for sure...<eos> - Rita would.<eos> Wait a minute, Rita knew?<eos> Don't get mad at Rita. She thought everything was over.<eos> Yeah, like we did.
You remember the case we handled with the alien sightings?<eos> Yeah.<eos> The missing cow ovary mystery.<eos> Never figured that one out.<eos> Well, actually, we did.
Oh, it was beautiful.<eos> Called himself El Tigre Feroz. Kind of a black tiger.<eos> You know who made the mask?<eos> Well, uh... Yeah, I think he goes to Benito.<eos> Most of the guys do.
The only thing this coffee needs to be is not vodka.<eos> You do know you two aren't fooling anyone, right?<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> Mom, everyone knows you and Steve are dating.<eos> - No, they don't.
You know what, we're having lunch.<eos> Yeah, let's say ear.<eos> Oh, well, you got to love him.<eos> Oh, no, you got to love him.<eos> I did my time.
I just want to spend time with him.<eos> I want so badly to go back to the way things were.<eos> ♪ Romantic moments you had ♪<eos> ♪ That he didn't know were romantic ♪<eos> ♪ Or maybe he did a little ♪
And, I don't know,<eos> I wanted you to be proud of me.<eos> You wanted me to be... proud of you?<eos> I didn't know you thought about me that much.<eos> Of course I do.
Okay, look, I would give you the money, but I don't have any money.<eos> Rebecca.<eos> The mayor doesn't have all day.<eos> Or maybe he does.<eos> Yeah, he probably does.
It won't last.<eos> I know.<eos> But are we just supposed to spend the time between attacks dreading the next one?<eos> Not like we have much of a choice.<eos> Maybe we do.
I know all your fantasies, Joshua.<eos> And I'm gonna make them come true!<eos> Ow, God.<eos> Why do you like this?<eos> I don't!
Morning.<eos> Good morning.<eos> You know,<eos> I really do love you, Becca.<eos> Of course you do.
- Seriously?<eos> - Yeah, baked into a pie.<eos> Doesn't it sound delicious?<eos> You love Brussels sprouts and you love Cheddar cheese.<eos> I do, yeah.
Saturday is my turn on the baking booth in the farmer's market.<eos> I remembered this morning that, oh, my God, it's the day after tomorrow.<eos> I have so many cupcakes to make.<eos> - You don't like your pie?<eos> - No, I do, yeah!
I scouted the entire area.<eos> You're wrong, Ramse.<eos> Titan doesn't exist.<eos> Zeit says that Titan doesn't exist.<eos> - It does.
She's been here twice as long.<eos> And during that time, she's had exactly one visitor.<eos> You.<eos> - No family?<eos> - She did.
That's not it.<eos> Then what?<eos> You've been walking around in a funk, and the only thing that's new with us is... what's new with us.<eos> I just want you to feel how I feel.<eos> I do.
And Green Lantern is behind the armchair.<eos> Hey, no fair!<eos> I thought we said that you couldn't use your superpowers.<eos> X-ray vision much?<eos> I didn't.
That's why you came with me, so it would get done faster.<eos> Our job was to prioritize patient need.<eos> I didn't do that because I couldn't extricate myself and my needs from the equation.<eos> Both of those patients could've died.<eos> But they didn't, Leanne.
Did you just hang up on J Law?<eos> I'm pretty sure that's against the J Law.<eos> You're out here because you lost Randy's dog, and there's a strange man standing over there, and all you can think about is Jennifer Lawrence.<eos> Did you just say there's a strange man standing over there?<eos> Oh, my God, I did.
You said that?<eos> Dude, I don't do civil cases. I told you that.<eos> I suck in court. Jesus Christ.<eos> Glad I haven't quit my day job.<eos> Okay, what do you do?
It's a bit time-sensitive, but it's a lay-up.<eos> Hold on.<eos> Look at those kicks!<eos> Did you not hear the part about time-sensitive?<eos> I did.
Yes, but they're far more intelligent than I am.<eos> Any confrontation, they'd out-debate me, out-think me and out-maneuver me.<eos> But this isn't about education or intelligence. This is about integrity and principle.<eos> Ma'am, you say you don't have what it takes to do battle with these people.<eos> You do.
- Bacteria.<eos> - How many letters are in the alphabet?<eos> - 26.<eos> Who loves you?<eos> You do.
What does EST say about death?<eos> I don't, um-- I don't know.<eos> Gabriel said that our people were with my mother when she died, that she wanted me to know that she loved me.<eos> Paige knows we love her, right?<eos> Of course she does.
Kirk's man in Cuba is protected by the military.<eos> If the military is involved, Esteban will know about it.<eos> We'll never find Esteban in time.<eos> We have no assets in Cuba.<eos> Of course you do, Harold.
It's part of the job description. But if this whole skinny-dipping thing ever even happens, you have nothing to worry about.<eos> -Easy for you to --<eos> -You're still talking.<eos> You have nothing to worry about because nobody's going to be looking at you, because all those other kids are gonna be too preoccupied with their own insecurities.<eos> But i-if they do?
Come this way.<eos> Susan.<eos> Take a seat.<eos> I caught your interview with Sally.<eos> You did?
So be honest with me.<eos> You like Governor Vargas' free-education plan, don't you?<eos> That's correct.<eos> And you want to see it implemented around the country?<eos> I really do.
That's right.<eos> I was, uh, just wondering, sir, if it might be possible for you to teach me that.<eos> I don't work here.<eos> Sorry.<eos> You... You don't?
We think it's more than that.<eos> We?<eos> Wait, who's we?<eos> His... his doctors feel this way?<eos> His entire treatment team does.
I think the President's in town or something.<eos> Miss Senate, Miss Kittridge, and Mr. Letts were all here on time.<eos> The litigant bringing the case can't be bothered.<eos> Well, if protocol seems to count--<eos> - Judge: It does!
We'll camp here tonight.<eos> You happy? But tomorrow, we're gonna fix your boot, I'm gonna get you to your kingdom, drop you off, and then I can go and rescue Isabella.<eos> All you care about is saving your precious Isabella.<eos> You don't care about me.<eos> Nobody does.
All right.<eos> You can go now.<eos> Why are you out so soon?<eos> I thought you had something serious to talk about.<eos> We did.
A very nice lady.<eos> She goes to the track every weekend. It turns out<eos> Schakowsky talks really fast, so she started recording him so she could get every word.<eos> And you have the tapes?<eos> I do.
Thank you!<eos> Any more questions, Counselor?<eos> Just one more.<eos> Didn't you tell Don Weingarten, another bond attorney, that you feel sorry for anyone who gets Alicia Florrick as an attorney?<eos> I did.
Yes.<eos> So that didn't end well, did it?<eos> No.<eos> I heard from Lucca, they don't want to settle.<eos> They don't.
You should know... I've done some really bad things.<eos> Let me out!<eos> Hurt people.<eos> You got any idea what I'm about to do to you?<eos> Yeah. I do.
Do you mind me asking how you heard about our shop? Oh, yeah.<eos> My friend, Dave Briggs, told me about you.<eos> - Do you know him?<eos> - No. No.<eos> No, I don't.
I'm late for a meeting. I got to go.<eos> You don't return calls. That's not like you.<eos> Not having any regrets, are you?<eos> I don't have anything to regret.<eos> No. You don't.
Hey, marching band, at ease.<eos> In a second.<eos> I don't like sitting down until my numbers end in an even number.<eos> And... got it. Oh, wait, no, not got it. And... got it.<eos> No, I don't.
- Yes, sir. - Move. Move, move.<eos> Move, move.<eos> Stop barking!<eos> You don't have the authority to...<eos> The hell I don't. Enough!
Well, I was, but, you know, people don't really notice.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> What'd you, um, what did you do about the... about the... about the nipples?<eos> - I had them tattooed.<eos> - Ah. I didn't do nipples, but...
When I heard she was dead, I told him I wanted out, or I'd go above his head.<eos> He told me, I'd better not talk to anyone, unless I wanted to end up like Bailey.<eos> Thank you, buddy.<eos> Now, um, what informant did you say this was?<eos> - We didn't.
That's, like, a million people. I bet you have a pet.<eos> A dog.<eos> Monty. Does Monty have a butler?<eos> No.<eos> No, he does not.
See ya!<eos> Ignore him.<eos> He's just using humor to express how... happy he is.<eos> It's okay. I know he loves me.<eos> Sure he does.
Don't you want to see your father at Career Day?<eos> No. And you hate him too, so why do you even care?<eos> Riq, come here.<eos> I do not hate your father.<eos> Yes, you do.
I'll tell you later.<eos> Thank you, T.<eos> Tommy, why'd you do that to Holly?<eos> Ghost told me what happened.<eos> He did?
Follow me.<eos> Penny, Alice, Eliot, and Janet, you are all late.<eos> Actually, it's Margo. This time.<eos> Look, we need your help, though you probably already knew that.<eos> I did.
Sends you down here like you're a fucking runner?<eos> Arrogant son of a bitch.<eos> Denise knows about Callie.<eos> What, did you tell her?<eos> Nope. Callie did in a really, really unhealthy way.
Some black ice had frozen over the night before. So, when we drove over it, my dad lost total control of the wheel.<eos> And we ended up upside down in a ravine.<eos> When we got to the hospital, I sat there for probably two, three hours.<eos> I was waiting for one of those Disney movie fantasies to come to life, where he woke up.<eos> But he never did.
I only saw what he did to Luke.<eos> What happened to Luke could have been self defense.<eos> We need to talk to Dwight.<eos> Sir. Hey, you came and saw.<eos> We did.
Meng Zhou was in our police station earlier this morning.<eos> He was pretty ticked to find out about the scam his dead buddies had been running at Willowbrook.<eos> Guess they never told him.<eos> No.<eos> They did.
- Eh?<eos> - Well... don't just shove your hand in there, right, you wanna take your time with it. Enjoy your body.<eos> Have you ever done a self-massage?<eos> Do we really have to listen to this?<eos> Yeah, we fuckin' do.
I don't agree with your premise.<eos> A clever attorney could invoke that defense to help his client avoid responsibility.<eos> It's a-- it's-- it's-- it's-- it's a legitimate legal defense... honored in courts across the land.<eos> Ever advise Borns Tech about testing cluster bombs in the ocean?<eos> I did not.
And she's just doing her job.<eos> And I'm doing mine.<eos> Does she want to win?<eos> Of course.<eos> Do I?
It's what makes this so sad.<eos> How could they have deliberated for one day?<eos> That makes no sense.<eos> Oh, did you call Gina?<eos> - No, Marva did.
We're not married to it.<eos> You don't like it, forget about it, because you're gonna love this.<eos> - Huh?<eos> - Uh, I did not say that either.<eos> Mm, actually, you did in that piece about dating apps.
I do.<eos> I do, Jo.<eos> But I'm with Charlene now.<eos> And the lawyers haven't decided who this place belongs to.<eos> Until they do...
I've got it.<eos> A.L.I.E.'s gone.<eos> Yeah. I figured.<eos> Clarke, you're not acting like someone who just saved the world.<eos> Because we didn't... not yet.
That's Irish-Catholic jedi mind control.<eos> This is tremendous.<eos> Eileen, I'd like to honor all your hard work by featuring the O'Neals in the church bulletin.<eos> So do you have a recent family photo?<eos> Of course I do.
Of course I do.<eos> Hold it up.<eos> Where's Kenny?<eos> Do you think he changed his mind?<eos> He most certainly did not!
I know, it was stupid.<eos> I just got off a 14 hour flight.<eos> I'm tired, I'm cranky.<eos> You know how I get when I get cranky.<eos> Yeah, I do, yeah, hmm.
That pair is fine, but can I get a discount?<eos> So, what did you ask her?<eos> Do you like him?<eos> And she said?<eos> Yes, I do.
Howie, you forget how much of our early dates involved you doing magic and me doing this.<eos> Fine.<eos> I had reservations about you, too.<eos> No, you didn't.<eos> No, I didn't.
Mr. James St. Patrick.<eos> Mr. St. Patrick is one of Manhattan's biggest nightclub owners.<eos> Thank you for that.<eos> Hello, parents and kids.<eos> How you guys doing?
Suffer.<eos> I'm all done suffering, Iz.<eos> I know.<eos> Yeah, you do?<eos> I do.
I have no idea.<eos> Regan!<eos> ETU's suddenly a breeding facility.<eos> I didn't see that one coming.<eos> No one did.
My parents didn't have baby pictures.<eos> I can't believe it came from McCarthy.<eos> He's a fu... monster.<eos> Briggs knows the controls?<eos> No, he doesn't.
You get the killer instinct from your parents?<eos> My parents are dead, aren't they?<eos> Truth is, we don't know much about anything about... your parents, about you, about any of it.<eos> So you don't know shit. Not about me.<eos> No one does.
Are they still alive?<eos> The humans know more than I do.<eos> The ETU has more intel on us than they've shared with you.<eos> They know exactly where your parents are, I don't.<eos> Well, who does, Jackson?
Finnerman brought her in to continue working on decoding the Hunter language.<eos> The Hunters have their eyes on Martinez.<eos> This is coming from Regan.<eos> How do we know it's not compromised?<eos> We don't.
Hunters, are reverting to your alien shells because Musa is planning a nuclear attack, and that's how you'll survive.<eos> You have no idea what you're talking about.<eos> We did well in raising your daughter for you, don't you think?<eos> By turning her against her own kind?<eos> - No. No, I don't.
Still searching.<eos> Well, that's no good.<eos> Time's running out.<eos> I'm sure Finnerman will have a contingency plan.<eos> She always does.
Milly, this is a really bad idea.<eos> How can you prove that this woman even existed?<eos> Grandpa must've hidden her body somewhere.<eos> The police will find it.<eos> Well, what if they don't?
Where have you been?<eos> Just in the village.<eos> It's quiet out, lots of people have gone to the funeral.<eos> I know.<eos> You didn't?
She could move to Morocco.<eos> By the way, I've heard of worse scenarios.<eos> [stammers] Well, Jenny... you wanted to be married though, right?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Like, you did.
I don't know what you're into.<eos> Yeah. Sometimes, yeah.<eos> Do you have to call him "Sir"?<eos> - No. - Wait, during sex?<eos> [Panda] Yeah, I don't...
I mean, I don't want anything bad to happen to them.<eos> Just don't ever wanna see them.<eos> [all laughing] The first time that Kevin ever left me alone in his apartment, I searched the entire place.<eos> - [Jenny] I love you.<eos> - I did.
If he broke in last night, then why did he pick the lock today?<eos> Why not come in the same way?<eos> I can't believe I didn't see it before.<eos> - Didn't see what exactly?<eos> - None of us did.
Caroline, what are you doing?<eos> You're dressed all wrong.<eos> Yours is a "riches to rags" story, a story we'll never sell if you go in there wearing that.<eos> I have a huge hole near the crotch in my panty hose, if that helps.<eos> It doesn't.
Hey.<eos> It's the oldest sake in the world.<eos> By chewing on rice, spitting it out, and letting it ferment, it becomes alcohol.<eos> "Kuchikamisake." Do the gods appreciate sake made that way?<eos> Of course they do.
The scar is not from Bashir.<eos> I got it when I escaped from my kidnappers.<eos> You escaped? Yes.<eos> The night that they thought you died.<eos> I almost did.
I was right about Nolan.<eos> First time for everything, right?<eos> Ah, I'm glad you were.<eos> I like a storybook ending.<eos> Who doesn't?
Hit me!<eos> Hit me!<eos> What?<eos> I'm just gonna go get that real fast over here. So, do you have a marker?<eos> Oh, yes, in fact, I do.
Every record falls in the end.<eos> Here's Bardot's file.<eos> I've assigned his instructor, Sergeant Ortiz, to be your liaison.<eos> You know Sergeant Ortiz?<eos> Yeah, I do.
And for print, we're using biodegradable ink on 100% recycled, fair-trade paper.<eos> Yes. I like all that.<eos> Tap that.<eos> Uh, don't your people use Tap That?<eos> Of course we do.
Is that you?<eos> Oh, I was, uh, photographed at the opera benefit.<eos> So funny how those things make the paper.<eos> You look great.<eos> And so does your... girlfriend?
Well, it was very nice to finally meet the famous Maggie.<eos> _<eos> Sorry, work.<eos> So, how did you know it was me?<eos> Well, I didn't at first.
Exactly.<eos> I can't believe she's gone a day and I already miss her.<eos> I know, me too.<eos> Do you think she knows how much I love her?<eos> Of course she does.
And?<eos> And... I don't know.<eos> Because you do not love him.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yes, I do.
How's your weed company?<eos> Well, we're just kinda kicking it off, but it seems to be fairly, uh, popular.<eos> Your publicist was telling me that you guys have really good weed to go to sleep.<eos> Yeah, well, I think there's some experts there, you know, trying to figure out,<eos> "This weed does this, this weed does that."
- He's saying, "Everything."<eos> [Maximo speaking Spanish] That's the whole dose you have to take.<eos> Thank you, I think.<eos> [Chelsea] I wanted to have the experience that I was reading about.<eos> And I did.
Yeah. You pulled my dad out, right?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Well... a lot of people are looking for you.<eos> I don't want to see them.<eos> I didn't, either.
Believe me, I've been there.<eos> [stirring music]<eos> I'm not trying to tell you how to grieve, okay, but you are gonna lose your job, and if that's what you want, fine. You can keep pushing everybody away.<eos> But I don't want that to happen to you.<eos> None of us do.
And what possible reason would he have to do that?<eos> Well, I don't know.<eos> Maybe these, uh, these shirts, these shoes here, oh, look at that, these magazines.<eos> I like to read the articles.<eos> Right, don't we all?
Now, run your finger along the damage.<eos> It feels like pitting.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> How does this help us find the path of the bullet?<eos> It doesn't.
Kenny's done bad things. He's paid the price, but you know, he's taking responsibility.<eos> He's reformed.<eos> He deserves a second chance.<eos> And a family.<eos> They both do.
And are you missing your sister, Her Majesty, the Queen?<eos> Not quite as much, no.<eos> Why on earth did you say that?<eos> - What?<eos> I did! And I do.
What's happening, daddy?<eos> That man is on trial because he did a bad thing to a seal.<eos> I like seals.<eos> I don't like that man.<eos> No one does.
You-you mean, right... right now?<eos> Uh, okay.<eos> How about we meet for coffee tomorrow before work at 8:00.<eos> If you show up, we talk.<eos> If you don't, then no big deal.
Victoria, the woman just died.<eos> So, I should call in a few days?<eos> Well, that's what I'm doing.<eos> Hey. How'd you sleep?<eos> I didn't.
Unhand her! Now!<eos> - In the name of the Medici! - Medici?<eos> Well, why didn't you say?<eos> Your name carries no weight here. - Medici.<eos> - And that of Albizzi does?
- And quick.<eos> It's better if we just... get wiped out straightaway than get sick or anything.<eos> You shouldn't have to think like that.<eos> Don't you think about it?<eos> Yeah, I do.
Have a good night.<eos> Aunt Vi.<eos> Blue says the police were out here looking for something.<eos> They ain't find nothing, did they?<eos> No, they didn't.
Just turn around, now.<eos> I'm sorry, ma'am. Not your call.<eos> There could be a secondary attack.<eos> - Do you really think that might happen?<eos> - It did on 9/11.
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)<eos> So unfair.<eos> She came out of nowhere a month ago.<eos> Sometimes I see her talking to herself.<eos> Oh, my gosh, you did too?
Because I just don't need all this.<eos> One of you had chicken pox.<eos> - Then don't eat it.<eos> - Who had chicken pox?<eos> - No, but I didn't... No.
Dream.<eos> You got to find out the future you're fighting for.<eos> Sometimes you got to close your eyes and really envision that shit, bro.<eos> If you like it, then it's beautiful.<eos> If you don't?
They look just like us.<eos> - You won't help my sister?<eos> - Wynonna... she's already dead.<eos> You don't even know where they took her.<eos> Sure, I do:
Tell me I'm beautiful.<eos> You're beautiful.<eos> Do you renounce Satan and all his works?<eos> Do you believe in God, the Father, the creator of Heaven and Earth?<eos> I do.
What's up, Ter?<eos> Hey, you better get over here.<eos> Hector's sister's been on the TV talking shit, and he's fuckin' losing it.<eos> All right.<eos> How you doing?
I got nothing left.<eos> You got nothing left?<eos> You smell like jail.<eos> Okay. I'll run us a bath.<eos> How you doing?
You're amazing.<eos> I made a pork loin.<eos> You take off that shirt.<eos> Say what you want, but my mother hit the jackpot when she married that one.<eos> We all did.
Moombas have been plotting against us this entire time, and you mock me.<eos> Check this out.<eos> The moombas have been injected with an explosive compound, but it only reacts to a certain kind of protein.<eos> Don't eat meat, no problem.<eos> But if they do...
I guess she agreed to it.<eos> Hmm. And then she scratched him from her witness list.<eos> Did you talk to George Darrow?<eos> The witness?<eos> No, I did not.
But she saved my life.<eos> Do you know what'll happen if people find out about her?<eos> Everything I've been trying to do for you... a good marriage, a chance to be queen... it'll all be over.<eos> But I don't care about any of that.<eos> Well, I do.
- You said he didn't see anything.<eos> He didn't.<eos> He was outside Gibson's house the night she died and now he's dead?<eos> We don't think that's a coincidence?<eos> No, we don't.
[CHILDREN SHOUT]<eos> Hey, hey, where you going?<eos> I thought we were having a picnic.<eos> I don't want a picnic.<eos> Course you do.
Uh, hello, why aren't your clothes off?<eos> Um, so, do you remember when I told you I wanted to treat us both to some - spray tans?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Well, what if instead I treat us to some light espionage?<eos> - Gabi, you didn't.
If you don't believe me, ask Melissa or the waiter.<eos> Or any of the 75 other people that were there.<eos> You got to believe me.<eos> Relax.<eos> I do.
Have any of you guys seen the guy I was dancing with earlier?<eos> So, it turns out James got off right after I left him.<eos> On a possibly unrelated note, my wallet is gone.<eos> Trains.<eos> Mr. Hastings, we did it.
Let's say I was willing to help you. And I ain't.<eos> Those tunnels are of no use to you or anyone.<eos> They were boarded up a long time ago.<eos> - Nobody knows how to find them.<eos> - Well, somebody does.
Dad, you're so funny.<eos> Could not have been more serious.<eos> All right, I have got champagne and tissues for Shea.<eos> Champagne if she got the job.<eos> Tissues and champagne if she didn't.
And why would she hire me and the Chanels?<eos> The Chanels are idiots, and she hates them.<eos> Like really hates them, hates them.<eos> I believe you got a theory.<eos> I do.
Please. I don't...<eos> I don't want to die. Please.<eos> Please.<eos> Please, I-I don't want to die.<eos> Please don't...
Mrs. Florrick, I don't want you to get too comfortable.<eos> You...<eos> What do you mean?<eos> Your husband has a target on his back.<eos> Well, anyone in public life does.
- No way you break anyone out of that place.<eos> - We know.<eos> That's why we need to get 'em moved.<eos> And you think I can move prisoners?<eos> We do.
Never mind that.<eos> Barry, Ashley tells me you're a hard worker, so we're gonna start you at the bottom<eos> - so you get the hang of things.<eos> - That's great.<eos> - Uh, what exactly do you do?
You know what? This is it! He's gone too far.<eos> Really?<eos> This is worse than shooting at us?<eos> Virgil didn't take your pig.<eos> Who did?
To find the right balance between not enough information and too much.<eos> You know, when you, when you wake up, and you're taken out of the cryogenic pods...<eos> You don't believe this.<eos> You don't believe any of this.<eos> At first, I didn't.
Bones, this is, like, two pages long.<eos> How can you do that?<eos> It's humiliating.<eos> And what's worse is that tomorrow you and I will have to have a conversation with Christine about cheating.<eos> No, we don't.
How can you do that?<eos> It's humiliating.<eos> And what's worse is that tomorrow you and I will have to have a conversation with Christine about cheating.<eos> No, we don't.<eos> Yes, we do.
Has been quite some time since we've seen one another.<eos> For business.<eos> I've had no need for diplomatic negotiations of late.<eos> So unless you have something else of an official nature to discuss.<eos> I do.
Darling, if you think you're going to get top billing over Stephen King, you're going to need more than luck.<eos> Good morning.<eos> Morning.<eos> Morning, Captain.<eos> Hey, Lanie, how you doing?
The truth is<eos> I knew what Scott wanted, but it was a chance to break new ground and... that's good for women, isn't it?<eos> Well, that's a hell of a justification for screwing over your teammates.<eos> I swear, I didn't kill him.<eos> Well, any idea who did?
Or I guess crematorium would be more accurate.<eos> Did you know Hammern recorded people?<eos> I realised that a bit too late, yeah.<eos> I haven't got time.<eos> -Sure you do!
Don't you think she wants you to say what you did?<eos> That you took her back when she got ill?<eos> She wants you to win.<eos> -She doesn't even know what's going on.<eos> -No, but if she did...
They're going to ask you about me.<eos> Ulrichsen, a comment?<eos> Why are you pulling out of this interview?<eos> My dear wife doesn't want me to drag this fight down into the dirt.<eos> She doesn't, and I don't.
Previously on Hawaii Five-O...<eos> It's not that I don't love you.<eos> I do.
Okay, so what's going on?<eos> Five-O knows about you.<eos> Yeah, well, I suppose that was inevitable.<eos> The important thing is they can't know about you.<eos> They don't.
Yeah.<eos> It went real bad? Okay, well, you know what?<eos> about it, baby, I'm sure...<eos> No, no, no, no.<eos> They just didn't...
When I make love to Victor tonight, I'm gonna be picturing him.<eos> Okay.<eos> So the thing is... I was wondering...<eos> You didn't call him, did you?<eos> No, I did not.
I'm not gonna tell Mike that.<eos> I'm gonna be an amazing mother. Oh.<eos> I knew it.<eos> I'm telling you, Mike, it broke my heart giving Birdie back to her owners, but in the end, I think she might have loved me even a little bit more than she loved you.<eos> Of course she did.
I think something's up with this spoon.<eos> Hey, hon.<eos> So glad you're home, I got big news for you.<eos> Oh, I know, uh, Frannie already told me.<eos> She did?
Okay, well, now that you've met the whole gang, why don't I take you upstairs and show you where the baby's gonna sleep.<eos> Sounds good.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> I think you dropped a $100 bill.<eos> No, I-I didn't.
Yeah, about that.<eos> There you are.<eos> Hey, check out the sky.<eos> The bartender has a theory.<eos> Of course he does.
You got to sit down.<eos> Stop the movie!<eos> Oh, this is for the popcorn my mom bought before the movie.<eos> Uh, uh, she's very generic-looking, so you definitely saw someone who looks like her buying popcorn.<eos> And she did. With a credit card.
Great.<eos> Hey, Gabby.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - Hey.<eos> Grant, hi, how you doing?
There's not enough evidence to make an arrest.<eos> I was raped.<eos> Yeah.<eos> - Don't you believe me?<eos> - Yes, I do, Kristi.
I'll just text, tell her not to forget the hand sanitizer.<eos> So did you notice anything suspicious last night?<eos> When you're focused on your work, Camille, do you notice anything else?<eos> I'm a multi-tasker, Jen. Just like you apparently.<eos> So did you?
He got out about an hour ago. That's great.<eos> That's good news.<eos> Kelly... they call that kind of blockage a "widow-maker."<eos> If they hadn't found it, Eddie could've been dead within a week.<eos> They did.
- Yes, and that's the problem.<eos> He left prison with a price on his head.<eos> A man promised to kill him if he didn't pay back $50,000 he took.<eos> - And he came to you.<eos> - Of course he did.
You know I invented the double-cross?<eos> Like, literally?<eos> Of course, I couldn't have orchestrated all of this without the lovely, talented Simmons here.<eos> She, um -- she hates you, B-T-Dubs.<eos> Yeah. I really do.
Like, literally?<eos> Of course, I couldn't have orchestrated all of this without the lovely, talented Simmons here.<eos> She, um -- she hates you, B-T-Dubs.<eos> Yeah. I really do.<eos> Yeah, they all do.
You can leave the basket there.<eos> Call the police, go, go, go, go, go, go.<eos> Would you please lock it?<eos> If I hear sirens, 'cause you just told those two kids to call the police, I am gonna cut off her nose right in front of you.<eos> - I didn't.
So many accomplishments, and still just 32 years old.<eos> Fantastico!<eos> Wow. Ay, caramba!<eos> You don't have any contacts, do you?<eos> Of course I do.
Hey, bro, so I've been thinking about our conversation, and you gotta stop worrying about it.<eos> I'm sure Riley's not having any second thoughts.<eos> Second thoughts.<eos> Who said anything about second thoughts?<eos> Well, you just did, for one.
And you don't have to if you don't want to.<eos> No, but I do want to, that's the point.<eos> It's one of my #LifeGoals.<eos> I always wanted to open my heart and soul to José Díaz-Balart.<eos> Who doesn't?
Things like that.<eos> Thought about taking the plunge myself, briefly.<eos> 'Cause I suddenly had no family.<eos> But then I punked out and headed back to good old Miami.<eos> But you do, though.
- I don't know.<eos> She wants us to come over there.<eos> Well, that's interesting.<eos> Why didn't my dad ask them for help?<eos> He did, a bunch of times.
I think there was somebody in that house, not Alec Moros, somebody else.<eos> Danny.<eos> That's crazy.<eos> I thought you didn't know where Danny was.<eos> I didn't.
When something's wrong with you, you look very old.<eos> Well...<eos> Yeah?<eos> Everyone says I've lived my life the wrong way.<eos> What do I do in times like this?
You can't tell me that it's not.<eos> You know, you have so much fu... you have so much influence. And... you are perpetuating a society that is homophobic, that is transphobic.<eos> At that point, you don't wanna hear about religious liberty. You don't give a shit.<eos> I don't give a shit, that you got your business shut down because you will not let gay people have a wedding at your venue.<eos> You just don't...
The brain... is an amazing and mischievous organ. - Mm-hm!<eos> - Er, who keeps telling me that?<eos> I know, I know.<eos> Anyway, I thought you were supposed to be a scientist.<eos> So did I.
Do you suffer involuntary spasms or hear voices?<eos> You... You helped the reverend's daughter when...<eos> - Yes.<eos> - .. she was disturbed.<eos> Yes, I did.
- Ma'am.<eos> Reverend. I don't have to tell you that this case is the highest priority right now<eos> Sergeant.<eos> You know Reverend Pembelton?<eos> Yes, I do.
And that's why today, Iran has one of the largest... Cyber armies in the world.<eos> So whoever initiated this and was very proud of themselves to see that little dip in Iran's centrifuge numbers, should look back now and acknowledge that it was a major mistake.<eos> Very quickly, Iran sent a message to the United States, very sophisticated message, and they did that with two attacks.<eos> First, they attacked Saudi Aramco, the biggest oil company in the world, and wiped out every piece of software, every line of code, on 30,000 computer devices.<eos> Then Iran did a surge attack on the American banks.
Just please, don't let this be the only thing you remember to say at my funeral!<eos> So...<eos> Yes?<eos> Did I tell you what happened at the funeral after you left?<eos> Why, no, you didn't.
Oh, boy.<eos> Hi, Mom.<eos> -You answered.<eos> You never answer.<eos> -Sure I do.
She got there before I did.<eos> I don't know what she had before.<eos> I've read about this woman.<eos> It all aligns.<eos> I did, too.
-Yes, we're better than the Cheshire Cat.<eos> -We are better, but they have suites.<eos> Big, comfy suites with soaking tubs and mini-fridges.<eos> -We hate mini-fridges.<eos> -Of course we do.
- It's yours. Take it.<eos> - I don't want it.<eos> - Take it.<eos> - I don't need it.<eos> Yes, you do!
What are you doing?<eos> - Coffee?<eos> - Ice cream? Mmm-hmm.<eos> - So you got my e-mail?<eos> - I did.
- Second thoughts?<eos> - No, you?<eos> No, no, no, no, no. I just...<eos> I have things planned.<eos> - You do?
I have things planned.<eos> - You do?<eos> How do you know?<eos> I just figured.<eos> I do, too.
- Okay, I'm a memory.<eos> Make your lunches!<eos> Have a good day at school, and I love... all of you.<eos> I didn't have the heart to tell her it was Saturday.<eos> I never did.
- Yeah.<eos> - Great.<eos> Of course he asked how you're doing.<eos> Did you tell him I'm happy to be back?<eos> I did.
Well, then let me put it another way.<eos> Is there a chance that she could live?<eos> Of course.<eos> But you need to believe that you can.<eos> I do.
Please don't take it out on this sweet little girl.<eos> You know me better than that.<eos> In a lot of ways, I think I know you better than anyone.<eos> No.<eos> No, you don't.
So good I want to crap my pants.<eos> But I guess those days are over.<eos> At least you have a sense of humor.<eos> I don't.<eos> Odell does.
The next part is the hard part.<eos> After that, they'll never recover.<eos> Elizabeth.<eos> Your feelings matter.<eos> No, they don't.
Nothing.<eos> The city of St. Louis is broke, so they shipped them back.<eos> We needed this sale.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, we did.
You know, that race... that's what started this.<eos> It was legendary.<eos> But Harley... Harley-Davidson... They didn't race in motordromes, right?<eos> Nope.<eos> I did that day, unofficially.
So maybe that's her Graphic Warning:<eos> post photos like these, you could be next.<eos> You went to this boy's funeral just to snap this photo.<eos> Sometimes I wonder what you people are thinking when you post stuff like this.<eos> I really do.
They gave me the number of some of his friends.<eos> I'll make some calls. But Jake's parents are scared and worried.<eos> They don't know any more than we do.<eos> And you believe them?<eos> Yes, I do.
Now I'd like to turn to our first question.<eos> Mrs. Florrick, did your husband ever make a deal with Lloyd Garber to have his son released in trade for political contributions?<eos> No.<eos> Mrs. Florrick, just to be clear, you answered that question.<eos> Yes, I did.
So, I have to ask...<eos> Did Diane approach you about making this an all-female firm, pushing me out?<eos> - Did Diane?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> No, she didn't.
- Why do we hve so many enemies?<eos> - Dagen, tell us about the ax men.<eos> - The ax men is Rezzik, a notorious mercenary.<eos> - He mentioned a woman?<eos> - Yes he did.
Where's the Seed?<eos> No, I mean, I really don't have it.<eos> I...<eos> Wait, you wanted me to steal the Seed.<eos> Of course, you did!
Excuse me, I didn't mean to startle you.<eos> Listen. I know you don't like me. You may have your reasons.<eos> But I'd like to have a little chat with you.<eos> We don't have anything to talk about.<eos> Yes, we do.
I don't want to lose you, Dr. Edwards.<eos> I don't want to leave here and have you not care about me.<eos> But don't you think that it's possible that I might make even more progress if I'm near the person who makes me feel complete and whole and safe?<eos> With you, and with her, I really think that I can get better. I...<eos> I really, really do.
Is that it?<eos> If I come home now, will I be in the way of your honeymoon?<eos> I don't know what you're talkin' about, Norman.<eos> It's not what you think.<eos> Okay, I did it for the medical insurance.
Is that what you said?<eos> I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> You said... you...<eos> Did you say you were a unicorn? I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> You did!
Peacemaker can't be touched by revenant hand.<eos> - But-but we-we just thought...<eos> - Don't! Ever!<eos> Think!<eos> I do the thinking... for all of us.
How's your hand?<eos> How's his face?<eos> I got him good, didn't I?<eos> Really felt like I connected. You did.<eos> You-you definitely did.
I have front row seats, a lifetime booking to her drama:<eos> crushes, affairs, breakups.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> But you've been doing this work for years. Y-you're telling me you don't believe in the work?<eos> I do.
Oh, and then there was An Arrow Through My Heart.<eos> He was a lot more manly.<eos> Oh, and then there was a time he played an alien -who didn't think he'd ever fall in love.<eos> -I love you.<eos> And then he did.
The CEO of a company should have an office that fits the title.<eos> But, Mom, this is Dad's office.<eos> I'm aware.<eos> Don't you miss him at all?<eos> Of course, I do.
Officer Shafe, you need to get out of here.<eos> You don't like that feeling?<eos> Wondering if I'm okay, if I'm coming home?<eos> Who's gonna watch after Bernadette?<eos> Well, neither do I.
- I don't know.<eos> - Her whole life?<eos> I don't know.<eos> That woman has a long road ahead of her.<eos> They both do.
What about her?<eos> She said she was in Hawaii when they took us.<eos> Some of them came here on their own, you know.<eos> People who believed.<eos> And what about the ones who didn't?
Kerry.<eos> If she does control them, is killing her a risk you want to take?<eos> I don't have an answer yet for what will end this war, but eliminating what I believe is a crucial piece of it is not what I would advise.<eos> Or do my words not hold any weight for you anymore?<eos> Of course they do.
We managed - we struggled on for 11 years after she was taken.<eos> What were we doing, just fooling ourselves that it could all just go back to how it was before she went?<eos> We got through it then because I loved you.<eos> You and Matthew and Alice...<eos> and I still do.
I wonder if you can help us.<eos> We're trying to find this girl.<eos> She might have passed here yesterdaybetween four and six o'clock.<eos> Oh, yeah, I remember her.She came in here.<eos> She did?
I'm sorry. She asked me.<eos> She begged me.<eos> It's not Matthew's fault that this happened.<eos> He knows what he's done.<eos> You both do.
I wanted to show you this.<eos> Eve came by the pool.<eos> We don't need to discuss that.<eos> We just...<eos> We just don't.
The wrong man was convicted for this crime.<eos> And, yes, I believe former Brigadier Stone knows something.<eos> And you believe this?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, I do.
And that's why we're on the planet.<eos> Have you seen it?<eos> It's bad.<eos> What? Who died?<eos> We did.
I need more practice.<eos> That's Dad's job.<eos> It was worth a shot.<eos> Got a cigarette?<eos> No, we don't.
- Uh, well, I'm really...<eos> - I think...<eos> - We gotta get going.<eos> - But thank you.<eos> - We do? Yeah, we do.
The all-you-can-eat Tattle Tail buffet?<eos> No, it's the look on your face when you finally grasp the real meaning of...<eos> - Shut up.<eos> - "Do you enjoy jazz?"<eos> Oh, my God, I actually do.
Leon!<eos> God! "Sommersby."<eos> You... where did you even get this?<eos> You don't want to know.<eos> Oh, no, I don't.
You're to open the ball.<eos> Good.<eos> You shall open it with him.<eos> Unless Mr Moffatt would object.<eos> So what if he did?
You never know why.<eos> You never know if they're gonna come after the family.<eos> Vince, Nancy being shot is an unbelievable tragedy, but to think your family is in danger, that's a bit of a stretch.<eos> Unless, you know something you're not sharing with me.<eos> I don't.
Anyway, besides, it's your turn.<eos> Can't you just call your little pretty friend?<eos> Pilar manages her sister's restaurant.<eos> She doesn't have time to pore over every detail of that contract.<eos> Yeah, dude, she does.
- Mm-hmm. - Yeah.<eos> I got in his face for, like, 30 seconds.<eos> So that's your whole thing?<eos> You think that makes her an actual suspect?<eos> Well, Twitter does.
Come on!<eos> The screw-up was yours, Mario.<eos> Do you actually buy this whole fraternity of prosecutors thing you tried to sell me?<eos> Because, oh, man,<eos> Melissa Danson doesn't.
You know, you're never gonna be a leader if you underestimate your enemies and undervalue your allies.<eos> I don't benefit from your failure, Marty.<eos> I handpicked you.<eos> I believed in you.<eos> I still do.
Listen...<eos> - Um, I think that came across...<eos> Sorry,<eos> I thought we had a scheduling meeting.<eos> Yeah, yeah, we do.
Does Pierce know who Isabelle really is? Yeah.<eos> So you told him too?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Well, Alex.<eos> Did you and Pierce... you didn't...
Calls for speculation and conclusion, Your Honor.<eos> Sustained.<eos> Inspector Navarro, um, when you observed Mr. Siletti immediately after the accident, did he appear to you to be intoxicated?<eos> No.<eos> He did not.
Objection.<eos> Asked and answered.<eos> Sustained.<eos> Did you observe the defendant drinking alcohol?<eos> Yes, I did.
A prosecuting attorney intimate with the defendant on the night of the crime!<eos> Alleged crime, Your Honor. - It's outrageous!<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Did you know anything about this situation, Counselor? No, sir.<eos> I did not.
Well, and a 30.<eos> Really, it's never too early to start planning the next three decades of your life.<eos> I couldn't agree more.<eos> You know, Liam said we'd get along and he was right.<eos> He did, did he?
_<eos> Well, I hope she's worth it, 'cause right now, she looks like a scared kid in way over her head to me.<eos> Yeah, well, don't tell the attorney general that.<eos> To wrangle this rendition, I had to make it seem like Hijriyyah held the key to Hizb Al-Shahid's entire network.<eos> Maybe she does.
Summat I can't talk to you about on the phone.<eos> Ivan got mugged. All right.<eos> What did the police say?<eos> Did you tell the police, Ivan?<eos> No, you didn't.
I get it.<eos> Hey, just... just before I go.<eos> That afternoon, did you hear Todd going on about some sweet deal he pulled off?<eos> Er, no.<eos> You didn't?
Someone's always watching.<eos> Government informers are everywhere.<eos> It's better now. Ten years ago you would just be taken off the street.<eos> At least in this country, we thought we would know who are enemies are.<eos> But we often don't, do we?
So she was telling the truth.<eos> It was lucky, really.<eos> We might only see one or two second-hand 458s a year.<eos> Mr Hamilton had been in a week earlier and said if I got one in, he'd buy it.<eos> And I did, and he did.
I'm sure you know I'm very interested in what you have to say.<eos> I come here with mutual interests in mind.<eos> I see, so this is like a goodwill visit.<eos> But you have nothing to offer.<eos> But I do.
My so-called victims were either involved with or already were part of an inferior race, and therefore, it is my defense...<eos> The 6 adults and 2 children under 10 shot to death by the defendant were human in every sense of the word<eos> - Sustained. Claiming your victims were unworthy of life because they were minorities is not a defense, Mr. Darnell.<eos> Make your point, if you have one.<eos> I do.
No, the disabling wire is checked always before it comes into court by both the DDA and the deputy.<eos> The wire was clipped.<eos> All Dwight had to do was pull it out, which he could have done through the bag.<eos> That's what I looked like from where I was sitting.<eos> Maybe deputy Simms and Rosen just did a visual check of the wire, sir.
I'll read Jordan Graff.<eos> Who is he?<eos> He is someone who is helping us regain our fatherland.<eos> Do you know this Jordan Graff, personally?<eos> Yes, I do, very well.
Yeah, and pretty soon, he's probably going to succeed, and then where will we be, Number Five?<eos> It's time to start taking desperate measures.<eos> We need to start interviewing patients.<eos> Why do you think you'd make a good Chanel?<eos> Um, I don't, actually.
Born an Al Fayeed.<eos> You are here because of what your family did to mine.<eos> My father's trying to change that.<eos> You think you know your father?<eos> You don't.
- I-I want you back.<eos> - Are you trying to tell me something or doing a Jackson 5 song?<eos> I miss having you as my partner.<eos> Do you want to tell me why you left?<eos> 'Cause you never did.
Or the first.<eos> Hey, Mom, did you call a car mechanic?<eos> Honey, the heater's broken.<eos> Why would I call a car mechanic...?<eos> I most certainly did.
- What do you mean?<eos> - My brother believes in me.<eos> And I'm starting to think that he's the only one.<eos> - Well, no, I also was just saying that I believe...<eos> - Deb does.
Oh.<eos> Should we listen to it?<eos> Don't.<eos> Dean, you don't... you don't have to.<eos> I-I did it.
You know, you have a beautiful smile.<eos> You should... use it more.<eos> Do you want to get out of here?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I do.
Their riders are stars.<eos> Now, some of them dead stars, sir.<eos> They basically make money for the manufacturers, you know.<eos> And fans love it.<eos> Everyone does.
It's a boy.<eos> Hey. Hold him.<eos> It's true.<eos> Nobody tells you that everything changes when you have a baby.<eos> Well, they do.
Well, there's no sign of a bleed.<eos> It looks like a mild concussion.<eos> What if it ends?<eos> Then I'm the woman who dated the pretty boy and it all fell apart.<eos> We done here?
Clear!<eos> - 200!<eos> - Bailey!<eos> His heart stopped?<eos> Yes, it did, but only just for a second, and then...
S-Six months?<eos> No surgery for six months?<eos> Uh, to be clear, it's a six-month suspension from the Residency Program.<eos> I'm suspended from the hospital? ! Yes.<eos> How do you...
Sometimes I need a fork, and you get it for me.<eos> And that's why you're gonna succeed in life... 'cause you get people forks.<eos> When you say you need a fork, I just say, "Why?<eos> You can eat out of your dog bowl."<eos> Who does that?
- She saved his ass.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Did he know the contract and the money came from Alice?<eos> - Unclear.<eos> - He did.
Yes!<eos> Sorry. We're not open.<eos> - Joann.<eos> - Angela.<eos> How you doing?
It's been a while.<eos> The officers that found you two in the tunnels said you were pretty well set up.<eos> I'm sure you don't want us to be bothering you all the time.<eos> - Don't you guys have better things to do?<eos> - We do.
Elaine is missing.<eos> Do you have any idea why or where she might be?<eos> You know, I always say, "Love is so hard to facilitate."<eos> Which means these women don't have valid - immigration status?<eos> - N-N-No, they do.
- R-Really?<eos> I pranked you.<eos> You believed me.<eos> I pranked you and you believed me!<eos> I did.
I saw the news.<eos> - I'm glad you're okay.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> I have time, if you needed the confessional.<eos> Actually, I don't.
- Excuse me? ! Don't think I'm afraid to punch a fellow hottie.<eos> All right, I just meant that now you have the time<eos> - to work the case with us.<eos> - You believe me?<eos> We do.
That's why the police ruled the death accidental.<eos> So he must've pushed his girlfriend down the stairs and then stood over, taken her head, and slammed it against the bottom step.<eos> According to this case file, yes. But our victim's head wound was so significant that I couldn't conclusively match it to the stair or the field hockey stick.<eos> Why use a field hockey stick when he knew how to kill her with his bare hands?<eos> He didn't.
- Did you say...<eos> - disappearing act?<eos> - No, I did not.<eos> Oh, I think I know that trick.<eos> - No. You really don't.
It's a risk I'm willing to take.<eos> I didn't know that.<eos> So you broke up with me under false pretenses.<eos> So I reject your breakup.<eos> You do?
Jane.<eos> Did you really like the chapters that you read?<eos> - Honestly.<eos> No sugarcoating.<eos> - Yes. I did.
Frankie confirmed Wayne Fellows' alibi.<eos> Found at least 12 people that said he was at the bar all night.<eos> Let's hope Maura found something.<eos> Please tell us you found some DNA, and I'll... give you 100 bucks.<eos> - I did.
He wasn't giving us anything.<eos> He wasn't ours to kill.<eos> - Dolls... - ...has nothing to do with this curse and certainly has a serious attitude problem.<eos> I don't like him, Wynonna.<eos> Well, who does?
WILLA!<eos> Hey, baby.<eos> Do you remember me now?<eos> Yes, Robert.<eos> I do.
We're losing you!<eos> D'av, you got her?<eos> Not here.<eos> Paolo?<eos> What did you do to her?
Just, please, just hurry.<eos> I'm fine, I'm fine, help Jeremy.<eos> - What is she doing here?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> - How did she...
What a jerk.<eos> Yeah, he sure can be.<eos> I'm annoyed with him, too.<eos> Did he at least tell you that I wanted to have some one-on-one time with you?<eos> No, he did not.
like...<eos> Floating on air!<eos> Dr. McCord.<eos> I did not realize you knew where my office was.<eos> Yeah, I do.
- I know! Well, HS still has nuclear material in their possession.<eos> Stopping them has to be our first priority.<eos> I get it, Elizabeth!<eos> Well, I...<eos> I do.
- He's a young kid; he's healthy.<eos> He will heal fast.<eos> you kind of liked using the giant intestine stapler.<eos> I kind of liked using the giant intestine stapler.<eos> Everybody does.
Nigel is 45.<eos> He doesn't really like to be called - Pop Pop.<eos> - Sorry.<eos> Did you hear about Grandpa's malpractice case?<eos> Yes, I did.
Well, sometimes we got to do things we don't want to do.<eos> Like you think I wanted to go on that stage and put myself on display like a piece of meat?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Yeah, I do.<eos> No, I did not.
Right?<eos> Fuck Siefert.<eos> Thanks, man.<eos> How you know I needed that?<eos> I didn't.
Alderman Becks' campaign told us one more debate was being set right before the election.<eos> Um... this is the first I've heard of it.<eos> Do you mind if we go inside to talk?<eos> I'm freezing.<eos> I do, actually.
Did you know before the divorce?<eos> Did you know before we signed those papers? - Uh...<eos> - April?<eos> I... yes.<eos> Yes, I did.
Still, no... about the baby.<eos> About the baby's future and the baby's health. Doesn't matter.<eos> - Without him.<eos> - No, it still doesn't matter.<eos> - Yes, it does.
Stop taking it out on me.<eos> Guilty?<eos> What have I got to feel guilty about?<eos> Oh, you think it's all my fault, but I never quit.<eos> You did.
I just I told her I would never intentionally do anything to hurt him.<eos> Or her.<eos> You know, and... she knows that because she knows me, but, um... sometimes you... you just have to say it.<eos> So, I freak her out by telling her I love her, and she lies to my face.<eos> Who does that?
I'm sure he's just skittish around strangers, you know?<eos> Who's a good boy?<eos> Biscuit's a good boy.<eos> I hope he has all his shots.<eos> Oh, I do.
Look at this... I'm motoring!<eos> I am answering the call of the open road. - Whoa.<eos> Stop, stop, stop, stop!<eos> - Waah! What did I do?<eos> Hey, babe. How you doing?
And you're gonna make an amazing president.<eos> And you are going to make a great First Lady. Once we lock down a more appropriate campaign hairstyle.<eos> You don't like my hair?<eos> Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.<eos> I do not.
I don't deserve this hammer.<eos> I may or may not have started the garbage chute fire.<eos> And I may or may not have tried to put it out with vodka.<eos> I don't deserve to be president.<eos> Felix does.
I see movement in that window.<eos> Get those people out of there.<eos> Life is nothing compared to heaven.<eos> We have no choice now.<eos> Of course you do.
I love it.<eos> Sam, what song will you sing?<eos> No, I'm sorry. I'm working, sir.<eos> Do you like Broadway show tunes?<eos> Of course, who doesn't?
Let's get going with the seismograph.<eos> Happy, how long is it gonna take?<eos> Not long if you don't distract me.<eos> You didn't tell her you were out on a case? Hmm?<eos> Yeah, I did.
- what's it called?<eos> - Runaway fusion reaction, and no, they're not that self-aware, it's more like a biological imperative.<eos> There, just... back up, don't let them anywhere near you.<eos> Did you see that?<eos> Yeah, I did.
- What's this?<eos> - The coordinates for where I laid Karen Morgan's body to rest. For Jeremy.<eos> He wants to visit her grave.<eos> Jeremy appreciates everything you do to protect us.<eos> We all do.
Well, too bad. A body from the Anacostia River just came in.<eos> Yes!<eos> You cheated.<eos> You like cheating, yeah?<eos> You, do you?
Yeah, just a minute.<eos> Or maybe five to ten years.<eos> So... you aren't a groupie at all, are you?<eos> I never said I was.<eos> You did.
I need to empty my trash?<eos> I would have thought that someone who's convinced that alien beings built Stonehenge would be more open to the paranormal.<eos> Daisy, I'm open as long as it has scientific basis.<eos> I mean, come on!<eos> Ghosts do not.
It's a form of encryption that allows a person to hide messages inside regular texts.<eos> You weren't looking to buy any records.<eos> You were sharing information with the competition.<eos> What do you want?<eos> Same thing that VinylVenue43 did.
People are not animals but puppets... dolls, toys.<eos> And toys are meant to be played with.<eos> I do believe a few more strokes and your toy will be dead.<eos> She deserves it.<eos> But the innocent life inside her womb does not!
I'm sorry.<eos> Mellie...<eos> I really did care about you.<eos> I cared about you, too.<eos> I still do.
You and me.<eos> No. That leaves you.<eos> I didn't grow up on an estate in Santa Barbara.<eos> I don't have $5 million sitting around.<eos> Yes, you do.
Foot it featly here and there, and let sweet sprites the burden bear.<eos> Two Christmases we now have had you home with us, Princess<eos> Alice, two Christmases since the river sprites carried you ashore to us.<eos> Do you remember?<eos> I do, Daddy Horace.
(sighs heavily) That's a shame.<eos> What are you going to do?<eos> What do you mean, what is she going to do?<eos> She has to tell Bonnie.<eos> - No, she doesn't.
Of him.<eos> Of what he could do to his own team.<eos> Or his own son, for that matter.<eos> I was scared-- why would you believe anything he says?<eos> We didn't.
Who's Eric Rawdon?<eos> He's behind this.<eos> Maybe he's your partner.<eos> If that were true, you'd have evidence.<eos> I do.
Put her in the general ward, the end bed, so she can feel the sun coming in through the window.<eos> I suspect she has leukaemia.<eos> She presented four months ago with joint pain and exhaustion.<eos> Did you consider sending her somewhere larger, perhaps for radium treatment?<eos> No, I did not.
I'll give you a clue.<eos> You have it hot when it's cold, cold when it's hot, and you serve it with a ladle straight out of a pot.<eos> It's soup.<eos> Oh, I like a bit of soup.<eos> Well, who doesn't?
With your little stick? Yeah.<eos> I just grabbed him by the 'orns and stuck it in.<eos> Right.<eos> Not sure bears have horns.<eos> This one did.
Oh, right!<eos> Yes, please.<eos> Well, erm, I don't think we need a starter. Shall we go straight to the mains?<eos> Let them have a starter if they want one.<eos> We do, yeah.
The main reason you're by yourself is so you can figure out what you want... really want.<eos> And if you're always feeling bad or guilty, how are you ever gonna know?<eos> Probably won't.<eos> I want you to thrive, Tawney.<eos> I really do.
- They're talking about the assaults.<eos> With us, Eva Carlsén. Social psychologist and columnist.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> We're all shocked by these videos.<eos> Who does this sort of things?
Why didn't you tell the police what you saw?<eos> I was scared that they wouldn't believe me.<eos> That they'd think that I killed her.<eos> Why wouldn't they?<eos> You did.
No, no!<eos> Mom.<eos> I'm so sorry I let you down.<eos> No.<eos> No, you didn't.
Well, I'm sorry, Bendek.<eos> That's out of the question.<eos> Linda doesn't know, does she?<eos> That you're leaving?<eos> Yes, she does.
He had the opportunity.<eos> You can't rule him out because he's got a bad back.<eos> I didn't kill anyone.<eos> You killed Hassan!<eos> I didn't...
My motive was love.<eos> The outcome was unfortunate.<eos> So this time, I... I want to use my reprieve to see you all happy... happily yourselves.<eos> I like this new grandmother.<eos> Mm. I do too, rather.
It's kicked.<eos> You're out of juice, huh?<eos> We've got jack on another Hand of God, and we've got even less jack on how to save Cass.<eos> If he wants to be saved.<eos> He does.
Crowley, even if we could exorcise Lucifer out of Cass, the Cage is damn near impenetrable.<eos> It took a spell from the Book of the Damned to spring Lucifer, and Rowena hid the book.<eos> And we would need both the book and her to even have a shot.<eos> Did I say this would be easy?<eos> No. I did not.
We all know that he has to go back in the Cage.<eos> Yes, when it makes sense.<eos> Amara's the big picture here now, okay?<eos> Look, in order to take her out, Lucifer has got to have the Horn of Joshua.<eos> He does her, we do him.
CQ, CQ, for shit's sake, is anybody out there?<eos> Hey, Cameron and I decided to have a weekly project meeting to streamline the swapmeet integration and we thought that you'd be a valuable addition.<eos> Yeah, sure.<eos> If you want me there.<eos> Yeah, we do.
You want to get that?<eos> No, it's fine.<eos> This is more important.<eos> Yeah, hey, we appreciate the extra attention, but don't you fellas have a receptionist?<eos> Of course we do.
But that's not right because it's not what I think.<eos> I'm sorry you couldn't keep up in the meeting.<eos> You made a promise to people that you wouldn't charge them.<eos> I didn't promise that I wouldn't ever charge them.<eos> Of course you did.
Okay, great.<eos> The big Ryan-shaped hole.<eos> Did you find any prospects last night?<eos> No, but I decided we don't need anyone.<eos> - Of course we do.
That little shit used to hide all of her favorite things.<eos> I know.<eos> She loved you.<eos> She never said it.<eos> I did once.
Everything's a total clusterfuck. How do you think he is?<eos> Why?<eos> Do you know something?<eos> Does Mossad know where he is?<eos> We do not.
Okay, don't mind me.<eos> I'm just gonna go out the passenger side.<eos> Catch a...<eos> Oh. Didn't mean to...<eos> Meant to do that.
- but I betrayed you too. - You did not betray me.<eos> Then what was all this talk about the strength of your convictions, Dad?<eos> That's what you teach boys.<eos> What, you didn't believe it?<eos> I did.
What?<eos> No, you sound paranoid.<eos> You know, I wish people would stop saying that to me.<eos> He loves you.<eos> We both do.
And the girls and I stopped being a placeholder.<eos> And we became her life.<eos> I get all that.<eos> No.<eos> No, you don't, Stefan.
Thanks for getting back to me.<eos> I'll admit, I was surprised to see you on my phone sheet.<eos> Is there something I can do for you, Damon?<eos> I have a rather lengthy list of hell stone rejects that I need killed posthaste, and I hear you have the resources to do it.<eos> I do.
If you want to talk about Stefan, that's okay, all right?<eos> I didn't have anything to say to him then, and I don't have anything to say about him now.<eos> But there hasn't been any closure.<eos> - I don't need closure.<eos> - No, I do.
Damon, did the spell work or not?<eos> ! I don't know, Enzo.<eos> I have no idea why she's not waking up.<eos> I mean, the least she could do to thank us for saving her life is just open her eyes, let us know whether or not she wants to murder us.<eos> What if she doesn't?
What's the plan?<eos> Well, Dean wants to get involved in a side story. Oh.<eos> So he can see if it sparks something in the real case?<eos> - That makes sense to you?<eos> - Hell yes it does.
Todd! What did I tell you?<eos> You said, "If it works."<eos> And do we know if it works yet?<eos> Claire? Oh.<eos> No, we don't.
You see the hair?<eos> Why didn't you give this to the police?<eos> I was... 8 years old.<eos> I thought this belonged to my little girlfriend.<eos> - - But it didn't.
You want to get the old band back together.<eos> Lennon and McCartney ride again.<eos> Well, I'm kind of Lennon and McCartney, so...<eos> But every writer needs a good editor.<eos> I did some of my best work with you, Metatron.
Chuck Shurley?<eos> He's a prophet of the Lord.<eos> I don't know how prophets are chosen.<eos> I don't want to be a prophet.<eos> No, you don't at all.
- Oh, hey! That's a nice surprise.<eos> Actually, I was gonna come by your shop later.<eos> For what?<eos> Did you hear about the new zip-line opening up at Alder Falls tomorrow?<eos> I did.
My dad is insisting I find some kind of school club to join.<eos> - And what's wrong with that?<eos> - I'm not a club kind of guy.<eos> You don't know that until you try.<eos> Oh, I did.
I made a deal with Jimenez.<eos> I gave them a piece of my Dallas operation, and in return, they will move our product.<eos> In addition to that, I want to regain market share, and in order to do so, I need to increase shipment by 30% a month.<eos> We don't have the infrastructure to move that amount.<eos> Ah, but we do now.
So let me put this simply for you.<eos> There's a saying where I come from... whoever can't hear must feel.<eos> So do it.<eos> Make me feel.<eos> Somebody already did.
Sorry.<eos> - Have you seen Frank?<eos> - No.<eos> You'll call me when you do?<eos> If I do.
Very.<eos> Too good?<eos> 'Cause Nate's too good to me.<eos> I tried to be okay with it.<eos> I really did.
Too good?<eos> 'Cause Nate's too good to me.<eos> I tried to be okay with it.<eos> I really did.<eos> I really did.
Okay, so, you confront her during her deposition?<eos> No.<eos> You confront her during her deposition.<eos> What... you don't want the automatic "A"?<eos> Yeah, no, of course I do.
Just the news.<eos> Let's eat.<eos> What? If I hacked your laptop, would I find out that you're actually reading about Wes' court case?<eos> Did you not hear me when I said that I wanted to stay in the bubble?<eos> Yeah, I did.
That's what love is.<eos> No, I think love is letting a guy stomp on your heart and still being there for him when another guy rejects him!<eos> You think that letting me cry on your shoulder is proof that you love me?<eos> - Yes!<eos> Because I do.
Every female inmate in there knows that.<eos> Every time he'd do me, he'd say,<eos> "Cry all you want, "but you're just a broke, "black crack whore.<eos> Who's gonna believe you?"<eos> I do, Charisse.
It's a reality.<eos> My guys already feel like they're under attack.<eos> Tell you what.<eos> Two counts, criminal sexual act, - in the third.<eos> - So your guys does, what, a year and a half?
I'm humiliated!<eos> I'm mortified!<eos> My professor thinks I have a crush on him.<eos> Why would he think that?<eos> Because I do!
PETER: You wanted me to steal the Seed.<eos> Of course, you did!
- It isn't like that.<eos> - And what is it like? - We made the engine.<eos> - It works.<eos> - It works?<eos> It did, until, uh, it didn't.
So you can understand why we wanted to speak with you.<eos> Can you tell us where you were the past two nights between midnight and 6:00 a.m.?<eos> I was here, sleeping.<eos> You sounded pretty serious about getting revenge against Ephraim Hill and women like Phoebe.<eos> I did, didn't I?
We have a friend in common, Morland Holmes.<eos> Oh, uh, nice to meet you.<eos> In other words, he asked me to find you.<eos> What do you want?<eos> Same thing that VinylVenue43 did.
Previously on Salem...<eos> No.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> She deserves it.<eos> But the innocent life inside her womb does not!
Conviction Integrity Unit?<eos> You think there's a chance you could get us out?<eos> Depends if our review finds significant issues with your conviction.<eos> I never touched the woman.<eos> None of us did.
How do you know she was here?<eos> - - What was she doing?<eos> - - Being questioned.<eos> Who decided to let the bum in?<eos> - - I did.
I'm in business school.<eos> I wanna be a sports agent.<eos> I'm not just some dumb girl in a bikini.<eos> No one thinks that.<eos> Lots of people do.
You're in this family now.<eos> You're gonna be seeing things, hearing things that need to stay in this family.<eos> Do you get it?<eos> Smart kid.<eos> Of course you do.
- And change my bed pan? Yeah.<eos> That would've been nice.<eos> Hey, Craig, you want to make some money?<eos> Old times' sake?<eos> No, he doesn't.
That would've been nice.<eos> Hey, Craig, you want to make some money?<eos> Old times' sake?<eos> No, he doesn't.<eos> He doesn't.
I work. I don't have anybody to watch him.<eos> His mother's not exactly available.<eos> What about all the bullying?<eos> I'm sorry, Mr. Walker, but Andre has to learn that his actions have consequences.<eos> Yeah, they sure do.
I think Gloria pretty much covered it.<eos> [laughter] [therapist] Okay.<eos> Um, Pilar, yeah, since we're on the subject, do you miss being intimate with Oscar?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, I do.
Right?<eos> Which-- which gig exactly?<eos> About when did that happen?<eos> I don't know, man.<eos> We did a bunch of those things--
Hi.<eos> Where's Cath and Lena?<eos> Oh, Lena came down with the flu that Cath had last week.<eos> Now, you and I both know that's a lie.<eos> We do.
I need to know you're not gonna do anything stupid.<eos> Are you gonna do anything stupid, J?<eos> No.<eos> I wanna believe you.<eos> I really, really do.
If you wanna tell yourself you care about this kid, be my guest.<eos> But you will do whatever you need to do to get him talking because you don't want to go to prison.<eos> I owe you big-time.<eos> - No, I was happy to do it.<eos> - No, I do. I do.
We're going to bring our military and economic support to a country that has earned it.<eos> What about the next administration? What happens when all this executive action is rolled back in January?<eos> Already writing a presidential obituary?<eos> No, sir.<eos> You did that yourself.
I feel like we're being punked.<eos> How is SECNAV allowing this?<eos> I don't know why she would, if she had a choice.<eos> Please tell me you have a plan.<eos> Actually... I do.
The times when I...<eos> I'm only saying this to you.<eos> You do understand that, don't you?<eos> He says he needs me to believe in him.<eos> And I do.
I'm only saying this to you.<eos> You do understand that, don't you?<eos> He says he needs me to believe in him.<eos> And I do.<eos> I do.
Not at all.<eos> I was delighted you came round.<eos> You can't remember?<eos> No.<eos> I don't.
But you... You treat them both separately.<eos> And then there's the third layer. And on that... ..you are capable of anything.<eos> Now is not the time for this conversation.<eos> I think you did it.<eos> I do.
Which means giving the Nazis time.<eos> I'm calling in the strike.<eos> I can't let you do that.<eos> You don't have the authority.<eos> Yes, she does.
You opened it.<eos> Did you draw your own superhero costume?<eos> No.<eos> Absolutely not.<eos> Yeah, I did.
I wanted to say that.<eos> There's our train.<eos> Loaded with enough dwarf star to punch a hole in a mountain and cut off the pass to the East.<eos> How do we stop a moving locomotive?<eos> We don't.
Wait, why does this say the body's place of discovery was Williamson when it was found on the waterfront in Leawood?<eos> The body ended up in Leawood.<eos> There was a strong current this morning, so chances are that it originated from Williamson.<eos> Somewhere near the old Prescott sawmill.<eos> - You done?
Because there's nothing you could've done.<eos> Because you don't have powers.<eos> Only room in our family for one speedster, Barry?<eos> Please just stop trying before you get yourself killed.<eos> - You done?
So what?<eos> That's that me, it's not this me.<eos> And I want to be a speedster. I...<eos> I want to be a flash.<eos> No, no, no, you don't.
That's that me, it's not this me.<eos> And I want to be a speedster. I...<eos> I want to be a flash.<eos> No, no, no, you don't.<eos> Yes, I do.
The Dominators have the President.<eos> - Hey, son.<eos> - I don't understand, Dad.<eos> No one in this family wants me to have powers. You don't.<eos> Barry doesn't.
Lots running around the city these days--<eos> Wearing a hockey mask!<eos> Hey, short fry was there, too!<eos> Thanks, Rene.<eos> Rory and I didn't, though, just for the record.
We don't like the implication either.<eos> But we can't ignore it.<eos> Simpson's killer may be one of his fellow firefighters.<eos> I don't like it.<eos> No one does.
Let me ask you a question:<eos> Did you guys actually put out any fires today, or did you just start 'em?<eos> A little bit of both.<eos> G needs a new photo for his I.D.<eos> I don't. I really don't.
Copious amounts of blood; possible internal bleeding.<eos> Bloody T-shirt. Men's extra-large.<eos> Probably used in an attempt to staunch the bleeding.<eos> Who'd you say the room belonged to?<eos> I didn't.
And, yes, they're being discreet.<eos> I looked into Rebecca.<eos> Now, she is a squared-away sailor, pays her bills on time.<eos> I mean, no one had an obvious motive to kill her.<eos> Well, of course, they didn't, right?
They sent me home.<eos> I'm fine, you know, but 'cause I have a history of mental illness, they send me home when I make one mistake.<eos> Okay.<eos> I get it.<eos> No, you don't.
Uh, I don't know why I'm crying.<eos> He wasn't really a good person.<eos> Yeah, he was still your father.<eos> I got no more family left.<eos> Yeah, you do, pal.
What's wrong?<eos> Nothing, um...<eos> Weren't you on DoubleSpeak?<eos> Uh, last minute change.<eos> Chief of staff did it.
Strange as it may sound, if she was allergic to something on the shooter's clothes, it might help us catch him.<eos> Was she having any symptoms before he grabbed her?<eos> Is it possible it was something in the food?<eos> No. She didn't have any food allergies.<eos> No one in my family does.
It went sideways.<eos> What do you want me to tell you? That kid needs to stay locked down at his place.<eos> - Thanks for trying.<eos> Hey.<eos> How you doing?
I could see you at that desk, studying, college applications. Where do you want to go? Uh, NYU.<eos> Oh, yeah, I'll bet you'll get in.<eos> Scholarship.<eos> You just need a room of your own, right?<eos> Everyone does.
Aunt Nancie and Uncle Marshall, this is Erin.<eos> She's a detective.<eos> She helped me a lot.<eos> So, Doc, how did you know the girl was gonna remember the shooter?<eos> I didn't.
It's... 2:00 A.M.<eos> Bri, you should be sleeping.<eos> I heard the nurses talking.<eos> They said I'm gonna get the transplant.<eos> Of course, you did.
This was fun and terrible.<eos> And when it got too much, we stopped.<eos> That's what this was.<eos> I miss our life.<eos> So did I.
Now, in the meantime, Nina, your social worker, is gonna come hang out with you.<eos> Okay.<eos> What's that? What...<eos> You don't like her?<eos> No, I do.
I mean, it's a three-year commitment with no pay, and this, I mean, this could be the western region.<eos> Even though it's not my dream, maybe it's where I'm meant to be.<eos> Honey, I think you should take the internship.<eos> Your mother's right. I usually scoff at dream-followin', but, er... you've got a dream worth following'.<eos> We both do.
I'll try to convince Taro to speak to you.<eos> He's the one who leaked the invoices online.<eos> Anyway, the scandal is my problem, not yours.<eos> You're not meant to know the workings of a national election!<eos> Right, and I don't, but Taro does.
-An old friend.<eos> You didn't tell him, did you?<eos> -Tell him what?<eos> -About me.<eos> No, I didn't.
Let me sleep.<eos> I heard Alex in the garage.<eos> I think he got the shotgun.<eos> You don't have a shotgun.<eos> Well, maybe we do, maybe we don't.
What?<eos> No. How do you know?<eos> He did the sex sniff.<eos> Okay, I don't know what you're talking about and I don't want to.<eos> Too late, I do.
How did the snake removal go?<eos> It was good.<eos> It was good.<eos> Ms. Karfton, you don't know us, but...<eos> Uh, yeah, I do.
- Oh, I don't care. You pick something.<eos> Well, I want whatever you want, - so we're back to you.<eos> - Well, you pick.<eos> - You. No, you pick. - No, I can't pick.<eos> - You do it.
Well, I want whatever you want, - so we're back to you.<eos> - Well, you pick.<eos> - You. No, you pick. - No, I can't pick.<eos> - You do it.<eos> - You do it.
I'm still wearing your necklace.<eos> Why I be wearing it if I didn't want to be with you?<eos> What about Mat, huh?<eos> You don't love him?<eos> No, I... I don't.
Monte knows this attorney who specializes in helping people get off the list, and that's the discount rate.<eos> Okay, how does this help you?<eos> Well, if he can get Gabe's record expunged, it's like he was never on the list and then we did nothing wrong.<eos> All right, well, I hate to tell you this, honey, but we don't have $20,000.<eos> We do on a line of credit on the house...
Hey, anybody home?<eos> Police.<eos> You were amped on adrenaline and I was lying on the ground.<eos> - Of course you thought that he still had the gun.<eos> - But he didn't.
How do you get food and supplies?<eos> The school was the town's emergency relief center.<eos> Lucky for us, it was stocked before the attacks.<eos> So do you have a sat phone?<eos> We don't.
You can keep your stupid plane. We'll find another way to get Jamie and find a cure.<eos> What he said.<eos> Did Chloe ever mention "The Courier"?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, she did, right...
Tiger team's inside.<eos> Rise and shine, asshole.<eos> Jackpot.<eos> Raptor moving in on the master suite.<eos> - Raptor, how we doing?
You know, before the quarantine was in place in St. Louis, it was just me and 115 people in a Costco.<eos> But I was able to protect them, because they wanted more than anything to be there.<eos> Not like those broken people we saw in that shelter.<eos> Back then, ‭the people wanted to fight.<eos> They still do, sir.
Elliot!<eos> You're okay!<eos> I was in the bathroom when I heard the announcement, so I panicked and hid in the tub!<eos> I can't believe you came up here to save me.<eos> Of course I did!
Hey, honey.<eos> Good Lord.<eos> There's so much less.<eos> I sold my bike today.<eos> Well, Jared and I did.
Once Holden had confessed to murder, to rape,<eos> Roland felt like that we should just cut George loose, cut all the kids loose.<eos> But before that?<eos> Before you cut 'em all loose, before Daniel broke, did you question Trey about George's claim of rape by Holden?<eos> Roland did.
Oh, it's babysitting!<eos> Oh, hey, Mom.<eos> Big problem.<eos> Have you...<eos> Did you...
He's undergone a closed reduction to pull the bones back into position.<eos> He's been sent home with his arm in a cast.<eos> Given that you're less likely to develop post-traumatic stress disorder if you don't sleep after a bad experience, maybe I should...keep you awake a wee bit longer at least.<eos> Don't you have a home to go to?<eos> I do.
I'm okay.<eos> You're my mama bear, girl.<eos> I wish I had someone in my life who cared about me the way you guys care about each other.<eos> Oh, don't.<eos> - You do.
No.<eos> We were just playing.<eos> Did I kill him?<eos> No.<eos> Peter, no, you didn't.
You cut just deep enough They pick up everything you do.<eos> I'm very sorry that this happened.<eos> Hey.<eos> Brandon didn't die? No.<eos> He didn't.
"Just forget about him.<eos> Walk away.<eos> Just get on a chopper and come to me."<eos> I told my sister to get on that helicopter.<eos> I did it.
- What?<eos> - What was she wearing today?<eos> I...<eos> I don't know. You didn't see her this morning?<eos> No, I-I did. I just, uh...
No, that is not what I meant.<eos> But that is what you said.<eos> All right, Counselor.<eos> I know what grade she's in.<eos> I do.
Love has boundaries.<eos> We know this.<eos> I tried my best.<eos> Please know that if I could've done more... I know.<eos> I do.
You think this is about me getting power.<eos> See, unlike you, I've had power, achieved greatness.<eos> This is about Jake finally stepping forward and accepting his own greatness.<eos> He doesn't want it.<eos> He never did.
- Hey, look, bro.<eos> We in Miami. Them dudes sittin' up in them Ivory Towers on Brickell?<eos> Ain't much difference between them and the dudes I know.<eos> I like it.<eos> You do?
Why tempt him to disappear his favorite assassin?<eos> If we can find Krasnov and connect him to Vikner...<eos> We'll have them both.<eos> The police know about Krasnov. How do we explain Vikner?<eos> We don't.
I think indeed he was insane.<eos> Do you know if your brother knew him?<eos> If Dag felt Helgesen?<eos> Yes.<eos> No, he does not.
I don't have children.<eos> No, not to my knowledge.<eos> It was perhaps just too much of it all yesterday.<eos> It happens sometimes?<eos> It do, honey.
Oh.<eos> Okay.<eos> Thanks to your escapades in Lisbon, we now have an eyewitness to the 1895 Courier events.<eos> It's not as if jellyfish have eyes.<eos> No, they don't.
I need to know that you are willing to do anything for me.<eos> I need to have that level of confidence in you.<eos> You don't already?<eos> How can I when you can't just trust me?<eos> But I do.
You are Costello?<eos> Good day, Mr. Abeline.<eos> Come away, miss.<eos> You heard?<eos> I did.
Call me after your wife goes to sleep.<eos> Bye.<eos> Ooh, come to Mommy.<eos> Does Donnie still not know you smoke weed?<eos> Of course he doesn't.
It was exhausting, actually.<eos> So I can't ever know how you feel, Maurice. But I know how Deborah feels.<eos> I know how she would have felt.<eos> I keep saying to myself, "It will go away soon, this feeling, "after a few months, few years perhaps."<eos> But it never does.
My supervisors called me a fraud when I told them the ARQ was generating limitless energy.<eos> I couldn't really blame them, though. Perpetual motion's a myth.<eos> Then Torus seized the ARQ.<eos> Now why take something that didn't work?<eos> Because it does.
Aw. I'm married.<eos> - Double, double toil and trouble. Fire burn and cauldron bubble.<eos> By the pricking of my thumb, something wicked this way comes!<eos> -I always thought it was "Hubble, bubble toil and trouble."<eos> A lot of people do.
Why would they do that?<eos> Because they know I know what they know.<eos> Now go away, or I'll set my dog on you.<eos> - We don't have a dog.<eos> - Yes, we do.
I mean, the level of purity-- there's an industrial process going on here.<eos> And Oahu is too small to run that kind of operation without attracting attention.<eos> See?<eos> He looks a little confused.<eos> He does, doesn't he?
They uncovered some... some deep, dark secrets about you, didn't they, Mama? Huh?<eos> You got more than one personality?<eos> Are all them personalities my mama?<eos> Look, they didn't uncover anything 'cause she didn't even try.<eos> Yes, I did.
She wouldn't do that.<eos> There's got to be another explanation.<eos> You know what?<eos> It doesn't matter.<eos> None of it does.
I don't know what to do.<eos> That's not your line.<eos> "Spurned the love of my fair queen."<eos> Spurned the love of my fair queen.<eos> So what do I do?
Gardy gordy gordy.<eos> The show must go on!<eos> Mark!<eos> Well, that went quite badly.<eos> Apparently, first nights always do.
It's true.<eos> A lot changes in a year.<eos> We did it.<eos> Yeah, we did.<eos> And a lot doesn't.
Malachi's loan-sharking and mugging scheme may have just escalated.<eos> Okay, you have no proof of this "scheme."<eos> I won't, either, as long as Malachi's the one in charge of investigating himself.<eos> You have any other theories right now, aside from these insane levels of corruption in my organization?<eos> I do.
Truth was, my parents never left me with Bort.<eos> They just left.<eos> Come on.<eos> I'll make you some fish sticks.<eos> I did.
You told Senator Healy we were crazy, but yesterday you thought an infestation made sense.<eos> Yes, but that was yesterday.<eos> It's not today.<eos> What changed?<eos> She did.
We don't have to be "dealers."<eos> We would just sell enough that we smoke for free.<eos> No, no, no, no, or you guys could do your original plan, which is to time travel.<eos> Well, we don't know if the bong works yet, so we might as well get high first anyway.<eos> No, it does work.
This is not Valencia talking.<eos> This is just me.<eos> I would like to buy you lunch.<eos> - Big man.<eos> What it do.
Ah, I knew you would not let your old partner, Hondo, rot away in this prison.<eos> Hondo, it's good to see you.<eos> Not really.<eos> You better have the intel you promised.<eos> Yes, we do.
Hey! Oh!<eos> I'm an American diplomat.<eos> We got company.<eos> I swear to God, if this doesn't work out, - I'll fucking kill Hector.<eos> - And if it does?
Do you recognize Nils Wendt here? - - Yes.<eos> What about the woman?<eos> I've never been to Costa Rica.<eos> You may have seen her in picture.<eos> - - I didn't.
I don't want to hurt you.<eos> Do I strike you as the kind of woman who needs protecting?<eos> Yes.<eos> So you have a past.<eos> So does everybody.
And other stuff.<eos> Hi, Josh.<eos> It's, uh, me, Gabi, which... you know 'cause you called me.<eos> So did you get the invite to Yolanda's birthday?<eos> I did.
Glad you could make it, Dad.<eos> I'm honored that you invited me.<eos> When Mario was born, I promised my wife that he would never be part of our thing.<eos> That we'd raise him to lead a good, honest life.<eos> And we did.
Ask your questions, Gordon.<eos> Did you see Symon at the party?<eos> Yes.<eos> - Did you talk to him?<eos> - No, I did not.
- For what?<eos> It's a surprise.<eos> Enzo!<eos> You came back to me.<eos> Of course I did.
We may have had our differences...<eos> He literally carried you to Hell.<eos> But I created him.<eos> Certainly that has to count for something.<eos> It doesn't.
Maybe I should get a catch phrase.<eos> You don't need a catch phrase. And you.<eos> Do you have anything constructive to add?<eos> Uh, yep.<eos> Yep, I do.
Like always.<eos> So I figured that if his toys started stabbing each other with a celestial blade, that maybe he might take a moment.<eos> Humans are dying because of you.<eos> Well, humans die.<eos> They all do eventually.
He never stays away for too long, right?<eos> Huh. Hey, Lucifer.<eos> So, did you splint the stubbed toe, or did you kiss it and make it better?<eos> Well, that's an interesting theory, but we don't have any evidence that Eric Cooper's the killer.<eos> Mm, actually we do.
Right.<eos> If only.<eos> Good.<eos> You came.<eos> Yes, he did.
Yeah, they're gonna kill her in there if I don't.<eos> If a judge were to declare her non compos mentis during the shooting...<eos> Wait, so, like temporary insanity?<eos> Do you know if she has any documented history of mental illness?<eos> I don't, um...
You think you can just hook up with me and then not tell me that you just got done stomping out my best friend?<eos> - That's what we doing?<eos> - I should've told you.<eos> I couldn't help it.<eos> So what do we do now?
- ♪ You the one I wanna chill with ♪ - ♪ Yeah ♪<eos> ♪ You got something I could build with ♪<eos> ♪ You say you want it ♪<eos> ♪ So show me ♪<eos> - ♪ You do ♪ - ♪ I do ♪
Mom... just wait...<eos> And don't use those videos, Jamal!<eos> I'm gonna be late for Angelo's mama.<eos> Damn!<eos> How you doing?
Man, I'm a fan, man. Yo, I appreciate you.<eos> Thank you. The purple, too. Okay, okay.<eos> And what you bring me?<eos> Okay, who is this?<eos> How you doing?
"We cannot repair what we cannot see.<eos> Our souls contain our destiny."<eos> Wait, didn't Beyoncé say something like that?<eos> Maybe, but it sounds like something Maya could have said, so you're gonna have to "Melania Trump"<eos> No, you didn't!
Listen, so far, we got nothin'.<eos> All right, no disrespect, but your cornball half-brother lives like a monk.<eos> Okay, he doesn't gamble, no drugs, doesn't really drink, I mean, it's damn near insulting.<eos> I thought we had somebody on the inside.<eos> We do.
Sorry.<eos> I hope I didn't wake you up. I-I, uh...wanted to bring you this.<eos> - You're welcome.<eos> I don't know if you drink tea, but...<eos> - I do.
Half hour it is.<eos> We have to shoot this guy, I get to take the shot.<eos> We're not shooting anyone.<eos> No, of course not.<eos> Just... if we do.
It's just that...<eos> Fate brought us together today.<eos> You believe in fate, don't you?<eos> - I believe in fate. - I do.<eos> I really do.
So I need something specific.<eos> Something you've actually seen.<eos> I don't want to get in trouble.<eos> You don't know what it's like in here.<eos> Actually, Nate, I do.
Well, you know, I'm canceling that card.<eos> Mm, I'm gonna need you to hold off on that.<eos> So what, you expect me to pay her charges?<eos> Tony, do we have any petty cash laying around?<eos> Uh, yeah, we do, actually.
Morning, Helen.<eos> Hi.<eos> Maybe it's time you and I sit down, talk about this killer you're looking for.<eos> - I thought we had an understanding.<eos> - We did.
I had to delay Bella's cremation to get a rape kit.<eos> - There's no basis for...<eos> - Forensics found semen. The sample's already on the way to the lab.<eos> How did you get an autopsy approved for a suicide?<eos> I didn't.
Well, at first, I thought it was some kind of "Star Wars" spaceship.<eos> - It's actually a camera. - Yeah, it's a Polaroid.<eos> Whoa.<eos> You like taking pictures, right?<eos> Yeah, I do.
What are you doing?<eos> We'll cover it up.<eos> Help me. Get some big rocks.<eos> - Did your mom have any pills?<eos> - Yeah, she did.
The interview process requires a polygraph, and if you have anything you don't want to come out, maybe...<eos> I got nothing to hide.<eos> We blew it, Philip.<eos> Why did you think that I would lie about a gun?<eos> I didn't, not at first.
- I don't know.<eos> I guess I thought if I didn't say anything then maybe it never happened.<eos> You know, maybe she never jumped.<eos> Does that make any sense?<eos> Yeah, it does.
The bees.<eos> This is their home... rain or shine.<eos> Yes, let's talk about bees, instead of the execution you just carried out in Yonkers.<eos> I didn't lay a finger on Professor Vikner.<eos> Who did?
Okay... "NCIS" is my all-time favorite show.<eos> - Since the very beginning. Especially since you're on it.<eos> They should have you on it more, though, don't you think? I do.<eos> Can we take a picture?<eos> No, I don't really...
The woman I live with keeps elastic bands on a door knob in case they come in handy.<eos> Who does that?<eos> Karen or Beatrice?<eos> You once told me that you liked sitting in a parked car in the rain.<eos> Well, who does, which you?
Why didn't you tell me?<eos> Because I didn't know if I could trust you.<eos> That's bullshit.<eos> Because... you liked me and I didn't want you to stop.<eos> Well, I didn't.
Really? Good.<eos> Good.<eos> I brought you guys some wine.<eos> I know he doesn't drink. I didn't know...<eos> - No, he doesn't, but I do.
Wicked.<eos> I mean, I'd rather not run but...<eos> So take the sedan, if you like.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I do like.
That's... What accent is that?<eos> - It's Italian.<eos> - Oh, really?<eos> - That's what she said!<eos> - Nope, that didn't
- It's Italian.<eos> - Oh, really?<eos> - That's what she said!<eos> - Nope, that didn't<eos> - do it, either.
People don't think there's a process to being happy.<eos> So what do you want?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I mean, I guess I just want a chance to find out.<eos> Who doesn't?
Say, what time is it?<eos> In fact, I'm late. Can I borrow your watch?<eos> Okay.<eos> Oh, hi. Can you just sign this for us?<eos> How y'all ladies doing?
Why did I ask?<eos> I know how much...<eos> Ziva... really loved you.<eos> And I need to know that you know that, too.<eos> I do.
Just out of curiosity, Jess, why couldn't you marry me?<eos> Oh, I don't know.<eos> Come on, Jess. You know.<eos> No, I don't.<eos> Yes, you do.
I wanted him to have a plan for his life and not keep his money in a box in his closet.<eos> And... he wanted me to not care about those things.<eos> That's not so bad.<eos> I mean, who really has a plan for their life?<eos> Who does that?
He has made his way through enormous difficulties.<eos> He has never been happier, and that is too precious to risk.<eos> What about me?<eos> I don't care about you!<eos> No one does!
- Stop!<eos> Mrs. Collins!<eos> The joys of breakfast al fresco.<eos> That's Italian, you know.<eos> Oh. Well, of course you do.
Mainly so that if anyone gets in your ear, you can tell them to mind their business.<eos> Indeed.<eos> Although I might need some more information to form an entire picture.<eos> Well, you know how young Harry's moving out to the Polettis' for a while.<eos> Yes, I do.
I bear a portion of the blame.<eos> For Anna. Rose is simply the tip of the iceberg.<eos> She's what brought it to a head.<eos> Do you see no hope?<eos> Anna doesn't, more to the point.
For instance, the noble Eskimo sets himself adrift on an iceberg.<eos> Mm, he's so smart.<eos> You love this smart, smart man.<eos> You love his jiggly body and square face.<eos> You really do.
Sang-min?<eos> I'm listening.<eos> I can't hear you clearly.<eos> Do you hear me well?<eos> I do. Don't you?
W-What is this... method...?<eos> Well, the laws of medical confidentiality prohibit me from going into details, Tim.<eos> Suffice to say, that not every Tom, Dick and Harry can be made privy to the procedure, for obvious reasons.<eos> You do trust me, don't you, Tim?<eos> Yeah, of course, of course I do, Mr Christie, yeah...
Four can be my backup.<eos> He's a better pilot.<eos> Gear up.<eos> If it makes you feel any better, I think she's just doing this so I'll be complicit in the deal.<eos> It doesn't.
They all showed up, just like you wanted.<eos> I guess I'll just have to find somewhere else to put my lips.<eos> They're not labeled.<eos> How do we know which breaker controls that giant room?<eos> We don't.
- I'd like to remain anonymous.<eos> I'd hate for this to get back to me.<eos> But something very strange has been going on here at the old horse stables on Route 6.<eos> - You know the place?<eos> - I do.
The whole point of coming to these smaller firms first is so that you can work out the kinks before we take it to the big guns in Boston and New York.<eos> I thought it went pretty well last night, don't you think?<eos> No, I think they were all underwhelmed.<eos> Hey, I read the room as I see it.<eos> You did fine.
- Don't say it.<eos> - What?<eos> - I don't know, but don't say it.<eos> - Outer... I'm just<eos> - Don't.
You're such a naughty boy.<eos> Ooh, you're such a bad boy.<eos> (pants) Does that feel good?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yes, it does.
He'll be making a lot of money.<eos> Just raking it in, drinking cognac and playing golf, and being on various boats.<eos> What?<eos> I just want to hear you say that you're happy for your brother.<eos> - I did.
- Yeah.<eos> - Hey, Ella?<eos> Yes, Thomas?<eos> Did you get that washing out of the machine?<eos> - No, I did not.
Hold on.<eos> Look what I got you.<eos> I got this just for you.<eos> I know you want it.<eos> Yes, you do. - No.
It's quite possible that her marriage will still go ahead.<eos> No doubt you did your best to prevent it.<eos> No doubt I did.<eos> So does she love George, then?<eos> No, she does not.
Okay.<eos> Well... good night.<eos> You want to come by for a night cap?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, I do.
For my family, but I never send them.<eos> It's good to forget.<eos> What do you want to forget?<eos> Why don't you stop?<eos> Why don't you?
Now, we hope you like our tent.<eos> We think the great thing is that because it roams around the world, we get a different view out of the big picture windows every week.<eos> So this week, obviously we've got the high desert of California.<eos> - Next week, who knows?<eos> - I do.
We can talk about business.<eos> Let me know when you grow a sack of nuts.<eos> - Really?<eos> - Listen, I believed in GenCoin, Izzy.<eos> - I still do, but not like this.
- Okay. - My dad's here.<eos> - Nick.<eos> Hey, did you meet Benedict yet?<eos> - No. - Hey, Benny Blush.<eos> How you doing?
Valencia.<eos> - What do you do there?<eos> - Small business loans.<eos> What, he didn't... he didn't tell you all about it?<eos> - He did. - Yeah.
Excuse me.<eos> You need to get out of here now!<eos> I tr...<eos> I tried to do the right thing.<eos> You always do.
- Shit!<eos> - I know.<eos> I've been in your spot.<eos> How you pay your rent?<eos> He doesn't.
- I know.<eos> I've been in your spot.<eos> How you pay your rent?<eos> He doesn't.<eos> His girl does.
It changed the way you think and feel.<eos> You tried to help me before you knew I could be trusted.<eos> Why?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I do.
Ugh. I'm calling because I have some great news.<eos> Well, at least I think it's great, and I hope that you do too.<eos> I'm sure I will... what is it?<eos> Well, Fergus just called.<eos> Of course he did!
And you?<eos> You'll be allowed to serve out this tour.<eos> You'll never get another chance to command troops in the field<eos> Like you have that kind of juice.<eos> I don't.
What secret?<eos> That meeting Jackson in Uwei as a young man wasn't a coincidence.<eos> That you knew Robert Oz long before you met his son.<eos> Robert told you that?<eos> Actually, you just did.
I feel like, uh... there's a dam inside me about to crack wide open... and there's nothing I can do to stop it.<eos> Mitch, your father, and the Shepherds... they're working on a solution.<eos> I don't know, Abe. Even if they do figure it out, there's no guarantee that the serum will work.<eos> It will work.<eos> Yeah, well, what if it doesn't?
It's not super-noticeable.<eos> I'm kind of a hairless wonder.<eos> - Ohh, ohh, do not say...<eos> - Hairless wonder.<eos> - Ohh, you did it again. - Again.
Do you want to fool around?<eos> I don't.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - No, I...<eos> No, I-I do.
Did you find everything you needed today?<eos> Uh, yeah.<eos> Not in a global sense, but yeah.<eos> Do you have a club card?<eos> Oh, man, I do, but not with me.
Was.<eos> I don't follow baseball much anymore.<eos> Yeah, but still, you got to love watching the Yanks get slapped around, right?<eos> The Yankees?<eos> Who doesn't?
Just take it.<eos> It's fine.<eos> Hey, what are you doing... Hold on.<eos> But I need my laptop.<eos> No, you don't.
You know, I thought it was a good idea when Charlie pitched it.<eos> But now that they're gone.<eos> Aw, honey, don't worry about it.<eos> Charlie knows what he's doing. He does?<eos> Sure, he does.
If he'd said that 1,000 years ago, the church would've hung him for heresy!<eos> Okay, Mom, well, I think you are tremendously overstating what happened here today and being quite irrational.<eos> No, I am not.<eos> Okay, well, I think you are.<eos> No, you do not.
If you're skinny, it means you need to lose weight.<eos> Every woman knows this.<eos> Well, she's from Argentina.<eos> She doesn't have the same references.<eos> Yes, she does.
Take the peonies.<eos> She doesn't want 'em, 'cause they're not sorbet.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Would you like a sign?<eos> Yes. Yes, I do.
I cut down to two glasses a day.<eos> Well, there's an AA rule I haven't heard.<eos> How does phone sex still even exist?<eos> Well, not everyone has a computer.<eos> Yeah, they do.
I'm cool with us being friends.<eos> Well, I'm not.<eos> What are you saying?<eos> I'm saying that, when you first came here, I thought you were the hottest guy I'd ever seen.<eos> And... I still do.
Put the knife down, Amy.<eos> Listen to him.<eos> You don't want to do this.<eos> No.<eos> I don't.
She burrows under my skin like a fucking tick.<eos> Evil.<eos> My God, and the years I wasted, broken up over her.<eos> I don't know you.<eos> Sure, you do.
Hey, come here.<eos> Come here.<eos> - I want it back.<eos> - Fuck.<eos> You do too.
South Side Young Professionals.<eos> Get your hands off my washer!<eos> Thief!<eos> Guessing you didn't tell her yet.<eos> No, I did. A couple of times.
You know that thing they say about how you're supposed to sleep when the baby sleeps?<eos> That's a lie!<eos> Babies don't sleep.<eos> - I'd like to sleep.<eos> - At least my baby doesn't.
There's only one way to do this thing.<eos> If we take down Pryce, then we, the cops, could lose a chance to take down Tyrell, - and Tyrell is scum.<eos> - Oh, it's OK.<eos> Maz, this is Jay.<eos> Oh, hey, how you doing?
_<eos> Is that "Infinite Jest?"<eos> There's no way he's read that whole book.<eos> - Yes, he did.<eos> - No, he didn't.
Cute.<eos> One of my girls called me a loser yesterday.<eos> Oh, man.<eos> I'm sure she didn't mean it.<eos> Oh, no. She definitely did.
My sister's house, okay?<eos> I'll give you a ride.<eos> What's the alternative.<eos> Unless you have some kind of magic car-fixing robot.<eos> You don't, though.
Come on.<eos> Yeah.<eos> You're not going to have to worry about that shit anymore.<eos> You brought the cat.<eos> Well, of course I did.
I really have been doing a lot better.<eos> But then I heard about you and Chan.<eos> And... you had a drink?<eos> No, no.<eos> I didn't.
Okay.<eos> Okay.<eos> Yeah.<eos> No. She doesn't weigh herself, remember?<eos> Of course she does.
Did Dad say something?<eos> No.<eos> I was looking through his medicine cabinet.<eos> Levodopa?<eos> Yes. He does.
You know, "Thank you so much.<eos> This is yours as much as mine and it's the whole team."<eos> So I cried that day, for sure.<eos> Let's go here.<eos> All right, how we doing on the dessert?
Maria Rita, let's go.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> I was choosing a photo for Rosario.<eos> Do you miss her?<eos> So much, just as you do.
- Hi.<eos> I love you.<eos> Should we get you some water?<eos> - Isak doesn't want to make out with me.<eos> - No, he doesn't?
Prez is backing up the money truck.<eos> It's going to be tough to say no.<eos> Would Annie go with you? Uh...<eos> Does she know?<eos> Yeah, she does.
I know this because I spent 10 years in the British Special Forces.<eos> Wow!<eos> He already said that.<eos> What was that like?<eos> What sort of things did...
I want to take my time.<eos> Get a good look at you.<eos> You like to be in charge, do you?<eos> Maybe.<eos> Well... so do I.
I mean, why did you invite him?<eos> We bumped into each other on the quad, and he seemed rather lonely, so...<eos> I'm taking his class.<eos> Did I tell you that?<eos> - You didn't.
So just try to enjoy it, okay?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Come on.<eos> Mom did not say that.<eos> Yes, she did, man.
I mean, think about it.<eos> We don't know anything about who we're trapped here with.<eos> You know what?<eos> You're right.<eos> - We don't.
Are you sure you checked it?<eos> No luck on my end.<eos> Please tell me you guys found a movie?<eos> - We did. - Ahh.<eos> You did?
Meat, stay back.<eos> All right, listen, we're gonna keep you out of sight, all right?<eos> 'Cause if they knew you were down here... they'd eat you.<eos> And you don't want to be eaten, do you?<eos> No, you don't.
Why did he leave?<eos> Was he afraid?<eos> He said he's tired of killing.<eos> If I may ask... did you talk to Genny?<eos> - I did.
Never a fan of the eggy bread.<eos> No, Granny.<eos> It's a place. And its Count has quite the reputation.<eos> Why would he want to meet with us?<eos> He doesn't.
Edmond, we can explain everything.<eos> The Queen's our friend. She's changed.<eos> She doesn't want you to do this.<eos> That's where you're wrong.<eos> She does.
- You ready to go again?<eos> - Yeah. - I'm not gonna spell it out.<eos> - All right.<eos> Hamish.<eos> No, man, we-- we just did it.
That's weird, 'cause here you are.<eos> You must be one very unlucky motherfucker...<eos> Or you're not telling me the whole truth.<eos> But I will find out.<eos> I always do.
She's counting on me to get justice for our family.<eos> That's not going to happen if I get locked up for something I didn't do.<eos> That's why I need you to believe me.<eos> You have to believe me.<eos> I do.
I was up all night.<eos> I needed something, or I'll never finish these paintings in time.<eos> You need to keep a clear head.<eos> Now more than ever.<eos> We both do.
That's why it'd be a shame if... with everyone's eyes on you, you got this all wrong because of your bias against my sister.<eos> Bias.<eos> What could I possibly have against your sister?<eos> I don't even know her.<eos> No, you don't.
No.<eos> You offered 4022 your assistance.<eos> Many times, but he was afraid.<eos> And do you think this excuses his actions?<eos> No, I don't.
I've already told you, I'm with Child Protective Services.<eos> Do you have a warrant to be here?<eos> A court order of some kind?<eos> No. This is, an informal meeting, but if you want me to leave...<eos> Yes. I do.
FBI, my ass.<eos> Who are you people?<eos> Blondie over there can't be much over 20.<eos> And the technology beefcake carried in on his shoulder doesn't exist.<eos> Well, obviously, it does.
Thanks.<eos> Who's that you're with?<eos> A friend.<eos> Kinda looks like a cop car.<eos> Yeah, it does a little, doesn't it?
Show me more.<eos> There are no more.<eos> Those were the last remnants of him.<eos> I loved you so much.<eos> He did.
By repackaging your original upload in order to bypass the damaged areas in your host brain.<eos> It really is brilliant.<eos> How does this process not lose information?<eos> Oh, it does.<eos> Of course it does.
They would've. It's a very tight-knit community.<eos> Enough.<eos> Can I just say for the record that at all times Dr Millar acted in the best interest of the patient.<eos> No, you cannot. What if something had gone wrong?<eos> It didn't.
I'm sorry about your team.<eos> I haven't given up just yet.<eos> There's no way they can do the mission with so few personnel.<eos> All those people are gonna die.<eos> They already did.
- And you're okay with that? Yeah.<eos> Why wouldn't I be?<eos> Because you're the person who paid to have "Head Flight Attendant" embroidered on your uniform.<eos> I did not pay to have it embroidered.<eos> I did that myself.
Whatever, it's nice.<eos> And she goes, "It's stuck," right?<eos> And I just said, "Hey. How'd it get there?"<eos> - You did not say that.<eos> - I did, I did...
You don't have the real show?<eos> Nobody does.<eos> It was unrecordable.<eos> Just get this clear. This isn't something you heard about? You actually saw it in 1988?<eos> We all did.
That's understandable.<eos> I mean, it's jail, for God's sakes.<eos> It's a shock to the system.<eos> No one ever expects to wind up here.<eos> Well, actually, I kind of did.
Did she say where they were going?<eos> No. They were in and out pretty quick.<eos> What did she buy?<eos> Do you remember?<eos> Yeah, I do.
What are you doing to junk's stuff?<eos> Whoa, whoa, whoa, we're just trying to keep us all alive.<eos> Are you the sumbitch killed skinny?<eos> No, I didn't kill skinny. I liked skinny.<eos> Not as much as I did.
Okay?<eos> They're leading us right to the Moondog.<eos> It's the only way forward.<eos> - Yeah, you trust that?<eos> - Yeah, I do.
I swear to God.<eos> Anyone who thought they were coming back... came back.<eos> You think you're gonna die anytime soon?<eos> Honestly?<eos> I don't. Yeah.
When?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Sometime less than the next 12 hours and more than the next 30 seconds, say.<eos> I presume you want to leave now.<eos> No, I don't.
No. I thought you were gonna wait for me.<eos> She said she was gonna wait for me.<eos> Did you call her "Booty?"<eos> Yes, I called your mother "Booty."<eos> Everybody in the AF did.
- Dreamy.<eos> Hey, kid. - Hi.<eos> Oh, great cameo.<eos> Loved you flailing around on stage. - You saw that?<eos> - The whole world did, sweetie.
Cops I work with think they were deluded, but I know they're wrong.<eos> Problem is I can't explain why they're wrong.<eos> Who cares?<eos> The police don't matter.<eos> Who does?
It sucks.<eos> So negative, Ray.<eos> You haven't even seen the place.<eos> No, JJ said it.<eos> Of course you didn't, did you, sweetheart?
You're leaving a lot of ass on the table.<eos> I'm gonna miss having someone else around who cares about astronomy.<eos> But, dude, you're my wingman.<eos> If you're not talking me up, I'm not sure I'd get that Sophia at that party last week.<eos> IâI did.
So whatever it is that has you all chill and totally okay with dying here, I want in.<eos> I want to do your drugs.<eos> Buddy, drugs are for expansion, not escapesion.<eos> You do not want drugs.<eos> Yes... I... do.
Thanks, babe.<eos> Next question.<eos> Eleanor.<eos> Given what you know about the people who've been brought here, the lives they've led, do you think you belong in the Good Place?<eos> No, I don't.
No, I kissed you first.<eos> Yeah, I didn't exactly stop you.<eos> How could I even do this to Barry?<eos> I mean, he's so good to me and he loves me so much.<eos> He really does.
People want to know. Over here, Mike. Right here.<eos> Okay, so last week wasn't exactly the start we expected from Ginny Baker.<eos> I'm still driving the bandwagon here, but... after that rough debut, let's hope it's a little better...<eos> Evelyn, I want to be alone.<eos> No, you don't.
Well, these things always have a way of working out.<eos> You've had a turnaround.<eos> What are you doing over there?<eos> Well, you know how we couldn't compare the fingerprint on the syringe with Eddie Harp's fingerprints 'cause we didn't have them?<eos> Now we do.
- She's my cousin. - I called her to come get me.<eos> - Asha, I'm so sorry. I cannot let you do this.<eos> I heard J.P. on your answering machine.<eos> Your restraining order worked. He... He said he's sorry.<eos> Of course he did.
No, but, uh, I got to ask you some questions that aren't gonna be too much fun.<eos> Were you aware that your husband might have been unfaithful?<eos> Yes.<eos> Sheriff, I knew who I was marrying, but I loved him anyway, no matter what.<eos> I still do.
It's possible.<eos> In fact, um... I may be, uh, kind of responsible for the threat on his life.<eos> What did you do?<eos> Nothing, really. Just, um... Well, I may have threatened the head of the Irish Mob... to his face.<eos> You did not.
If Oscar were guilty, I wouldn't be here. - I'd be with him.<eos> - Ask him about the traffic cam.<eos> If he's innocent, how do you explain the video footage that places Oscar's car at the scene?<eos> Does this video footage capture the image of the driver?<eos> No, it does not.
That's impossible.<eos> I think you guys both might have had some kind of hallucination.<eos> Five, come in.<eos> - Hey, did you find Two?<eos> - Yeah, we did.
That is the beauty, Joe.<eos> No.<eos> You saved my life.<eos> Please tell me it matters.<eos> Of course it does, Joe.
Your parting gift is going back to the maximum security hellhole you came from.<eos> No way.<eos> You don't have the power to make that happen.<eos> You're right, I don't.<eos> But my friend at the SEC sure does.
You know, when they brought "Godot" to America, it opened in Miami in this dinner theater.<eos> It was billed as the laugh riot of two continents, and it bombed.<eos> So then they put it on for prisoners in Sing Sing.<eos> People said it wouldn't work. They wouldn't get it. It was too highbrow.<eos> Of course, they did.
ONLY THE RIGHTEOUS HAVE NO FEAR<eos> I finally triangulated Murphy's signal.<eos> He was transmitting from Spokane.<eos> Washington? That makes no sense.<eos> And anything else does?
But I feel horrible about what happened that night, and for your information, the guy that I hit is fully recovered right now, and I'm still in here paying for this shit.<eos> Break out the champagne, Louis.<eos> That house in the Hamptons is gonna be yours into 90 days.<eos> - They accepted my offer?<eos> - That they did.
Sutter goes down, Mike gets out.<eos> - Holy shit.<eos> - I know.<eos> And don't tell me Mike still doesn't have anything for you.<eos> No, he doesn't.
I'll make it happen.<eos> Louis?<eos> Do you have a second?<eos> Actually, I don't, Donna, because I'm going on the most important date of my life tonight, and I have no idea where I'm taking her.<eos> Yes, you do.
Wasn't part of the deal.<eos> I don't give a shit.<eos> I'm tired of you threatening me, so if you even want a chance of getting out of here early, you're gonna do something for me.<eos> And by the way, it's too late to tell Kevin that I've been informing on him.<eos> I already did.
The Flash pestering me does not encourage my success.<eos> So we do have something in common.<eos> Yeah, but Flash is right.<eos> You need to be done.<eos> - Done in one more minute.
Rule number two...<eos> You're on an island with two tribes.<eos> Oh, Jesus.<eos> Does the prosecution have any questions for the witness? Does frontotemporal dementia diminish intellectual capacity, or moral clarity?<eos> No, it does not.
And why is that?<eos> Frontotemporal dementia robbed him of that capacity.<eos> He could no more force himself to do the right thing than a man with a severed spinal column could force himself to walk.<eos> And does Dr. Kushel know what's wrong with him?<eos> - In my view, he... - Fucking right I do.
- Well, don't be.<eos> Not about that.<eos> You can know the difference between right and wrong and still not be able to stop.<eos> That's what you said.<eos> Yes, I did.
Sean claims he wasn't in the house.<eos> But Sean doesn't have an alibi.<eos> From 11:30, when we confirmed he left the restaurant, to 2:05 when he arrived at the strip club.<eos> And Zach doesn't have an alibi either.<eos> No, actually, he does.
She was there posing, looking at you?<eos> Thought, "Maybe she wants to have sex with me?"<eos> Right?<eos> Do you think so?<eos> Yeah, Charlie, I do.
I dated her for a whole semester. She thought I was an exchange student from Italy.<eos> It was the best sex I ever had.<eos> Yeah, well, that whole foreign thing works with, you know, a certain niche audience.<eos> This guy thinks he's pretty clever, huh?<eos> So does this guy.
Makes it, like, 1,000 times more potent.<eos> It's killing people all over Chicago.<eos> Hey, Sarge.<eos> I heard Mouse came looking to get a felony dropped so he could re-enlist.<eos> And if he did?
Yeah, I get it, but...<eos> Manny already signed a complaint.<eos> She's gonna have to do a night in the lockup.<eos> But there's got to be something that we can do.<eos> We did do something, Kim.
Just can't stop picturing it.<eos> I don't think you have to be alone to be lonely.<eos> Dad always taught me that.<eos> Did your father tell you that one of my pieces has gone missing?<eos> He did.
Good luck getting a pair of these babies in "Ma-nai-la."<eos> You know, I... I think he means well.<eos> He's... he's just... he doesn't unders...<eos> It's not like I don't love America.<eos> I do.
You mean after seeing a man hanged?<eos> As well as can be expected, I guess.<eos> Oh, man.<eos> Who invited Jessica Rabbit?<eos> Algeria did.
Thought you were going to India?<eos> I am. I'm just saving up.<eos> KENT SNORTS Obviously doesn't want to go, then.<eos> Obviously.<eos> Yeah, fucking do, actually.
I'm not supposed to be small, and everyone's always acting like there's no problem.<eos> "You can be anything you want to be."<eos> No, I can't!<eos> I can't even be the one thing I'm supposed to be, ya know?<eos> Of course I do.
I remember one time...<eos> You're seeing their faces, aren't you?<eos> Everyone else... what's wrong with them?<eos> - Why don't they see it?<eos> - I do.
I don't think you'll do that.<eos> Flying isn't one of your special talents.<eos> I'm opening a door for you, Mr. Reyes, both literally and figuratively.<eos> And in return you want...?<eos> Same thing you do...
I need cold, hard, scientific facts to back up our case during this debate.<eos> I can put together a PowerPoint on, um, Inhuman genetics, biology, sociological impact...<eos> Yeah, here's the thing. I think it might be better if I literally had what's in your head... in my head.<eos> Even S.H.I.E.L.D. doesn't have that kind of technology.<eos> Oh, sure it does.
Well, the first part is like you said.<eos> The fire, the chase, the shooting.<eos> But what I remember most is feeling like I screwed up... that because of me, you were going to die.<eos> We both were.<eos> We didn't.
Okay.<eos> Admittedly, Ray got a little weird.<eos> - A lit...<eos> - And don't say, "He got a lot more than that."<eos> - Well, he did. - Yeah, okay.
Admittedly, Ray got a little weird.<eos> - A lit...<eos> - And don't say, "He got a lot more than that."<eos> - Well, he did. - Yeah, okay.<eos> He did.
But we found these among the most recently uploaded files. ...I mean demolished.<eos> You can see the construction going on over there.<eos> To build airstrips and radar stations, they pulverize the coral and pave over it with concrete, destroying it forever.<eos> She seems like good people.<eos> Yeah, she does.
If you carry on, you could be liable to prosecution.<eos> - We understand, officer...<eos> - Are you serious?<eos> - Do you know what he did?<eos> - Rob, don't.
I was... trying to decide what to wear, and then I realised it doesn't bloody matter.<eos> Adam doesn't give a damn whether I wear the stupid dress or the skirt or the...<eos> He doesn't give a damn whether I go to his funeral at all.<eos> Maybe not.<eos> But I do.
Well, I have seen the place about a dozen times, but let's make it official.<eos> Right.<eos> You brought the Pope.<eos> I brought the Pope.<eos> Well, the Second City First Committee did.
Oh, last Friday, why?<eos> Let me guess.<eos> Scored a little blur, some eye candy, maybe took in the conjoined-twins freak show down on Fifth.<eos> What do you want?<eos> The same thing you do.
What do you mean?<eos> What if you were having a dream, and in that dream she was married to another man?<eos> I'd know it was a dream.<eos> What if it was actually true? That she had a husband?<eos> She didn't.
Dad.<eos> I mean, he had the hardest job in the world, you know, um, things coming at him from everyone and everywhere, but you know, still, he was always there for me.<eos> Um, and now...<eos> I have some very big shoes to fill.<eos> Yeah, we both do.
Have you?<eos> And I guess I should just come right out with it.<eos> I have decided to go with Aaron.<eos> I'm sorry? I know you have misgivings about Aaron.<eos> Hell, so do I.
I'm just being nice.<eos> Let go.<eos> You want it rough, all you got to do is ask.<eos> Come on, baby, you know you want it.<eos> You do.
Let go.<eos> You want it rough, all you got to do is ask.<eos> Come on, baby, you know you want it.<eos> You do.<eos> You do.
There's no way he lived through that.<eos> This video features the same teenager as several that preceded it.<eos> Obviously, his family brought in their old film to Stone Post for digitization.<eos> So I doubt they knew what they had.<eos> Aaron obviously did.
- I get it.<eos> - Not that I don't appreciate the offer.<eos> I do. It's just...<eos> I don't see myself working in TV.<eos> Yeah, well, who does?
That guy out-punted his coverage."<eos> Nothing to see here, folks.<eos> We're all good.<eos> Just two regular people.<eos> Nothing to do with baseball whatsoever.
Thank you.<eos> - I win.<eos> - You cheated.<eos> - I know your game, little girl.<eos> - I did not.
Uh, the president is busy meeting with his advisers, and, um... working up a strategy.<eos> Can you be any more specific?<eos> Uh... not really.<eos> - But the president does have a strategy?<eos> - Of course he does.
It's just... with you Rosewoods, favors often give birth to secrets, and the last time I did one of you a favor, it... it... It didn't go so well.<eos> This is gonna be very different.<eos> O...kay.<eos> So Rosie knows about this favor?<eos> No, he doesn't.
Hi. What's the emergency, Mr. Schott?<eos> Is she drunk?<eos> Mon-El took me to happy hour.<eos> - Of course he did. - He knows how to drink drinks.<eos> Of course he does.
I want her to stay here with me.<eos> You know what she said when she got home last night?<eos> "Everybody needs to stop lying to me.<eos> I'm not a baby anymore."<eos> Of course she did.
Like, um...<eos> Gina and Mike and their turbulent relationship.<eos> Kind of gives Gina motive.<eos> Well, she didn't buy a gun. But Rob had a gun collection and he was dealing steroids.<eos> All the top players on their team did steroids.
You should have read them all, and with care.<eos> In this last one, he states he'll never send these letters to that woman because he's married to God.<eos> Do you have any evidence that they were mailed?<eos> Any envelopes with canceled stamps?<eos> No, no, I don't.
- Should I call the doctor? - No, no, no, it's nothing serious. It's over.<eos> Are you certain you don't want me to call the doctor?<eos> All better now.<eos> Do you believe in God?<eos> I... yes, I do.
With fists.<eos> Like men.<eos> Yes.<eos> Nick hated Doug.<eos> They all did.
I see you're celebrating.<eos> Yes, well... I'm in the midst of driving a pirate-shaped wedge into the middle of the Charming clan.<eos> Care to join me.<eos> Do you remember... your old lessons?<eos> Why, yes, I do.
Why almost die in Syria when we could be out there right now almost dying in a hurricane?<eos> Oh, there's the woman my family forced me to marry.<eos> Every second we're in here is second we're not risking getting electrocuted by downed power lines.<eos> We'll see you guys later.<eos> Wha... we do funerals. Wakes, shivas, too.
I don't see Dominique as much of a reader, but I thought she would at least get through a Tintin.<eos> Finger.<eos> -I don't think so. Oh, come on.<eos> You don't need to stay for long, just long enough to let her know we're thinking of her, if she cares.<eos> -She does.
♪ Previously on BrainDead... ♪<eos> ♪ Previously on Gunsmoke... ♪<eos> Oh, I like him.<eos> - You do?
It.<eos> And, uh, set up a press conference for me for tomorrow.<eos> Senator, do you still trust me?<eos> Do I...?<eos> Of course I do. - Why?
I'll just...<eos> Laurel Healy.<eos> Miss Healy, this is Senator Red Wheatus.<eos> Do you recognize my voice?<eos> I do.
- I don't know.<eos> - ‭Oh, God.<eos> Don't tell me you think we should let the CIA handle this?<eos> No.<eos> - But you do, though?
Better not affect your performance in the field today.<eos> I feel great.<eos> I don't want to hear a thing about, you know, your tight calves or your chafed nipples.<eos> Well, then you definitely don't want to hear about my rectus femoris.<eos> No, I do not. Mmm.
You should hear what she talks to just me about.<eos> Ooh! Who the hell is Andrew Hartsfield?<eos> I hope he's not that weirdo at the gas station.<eos> Hey, did she tell you we're doing the zombie run together?<eos> Of course, she did.
You want some?<eos> Uh, you're really going to have caffeine in front of me when I'm trying to get my life back on track?<eos> Uh, okay, let's pretend you do have a problem. I do.<eos> You don't.<eos> Yeah, but I do.
That's my old training officer.<eos> Well, he took a pretty bad blow to the head.<eos> The EMTs are cleaning him up now.<eos> H-Hey, Roger!<eos> - How you doing, buddy?
- Trust me.<eos> Let's say 149.<eos> Damn it, Riggs, giving Ned money wasn't part of the plan!<eos> Uh, in fairness, I didn't have a plan.<eos> Yes, we did.
R-R-Rojohn.<eos> Rojohn.<eos> Look, every person on a crew has a role.<eos> I'm guessing yours is breaking things, moving heavy objects, maybe grunting from time to time?<eos> He does a lot of grunting.
Did it work?<eos> I...<eos> I'm so sorry, Wyatt.<eos> - It was a long shot.<eos> - Do you...
Oh, nice.<eos> I have a beach house, too.<eos> You never told us you had a beach house.<eos> Uh, no.<eos> No, I did not.
We'll identify the issue and stop it from happening again.<eos> Yes, we're anxious for you to begin.<eos> Well, let's get crack-a-lackin'.<eos> My Happy needs her sleep.<eos> Before you do, a few things:
"Did you just find out American Girl doesn't make clothes in adult sizes?"<eos> No.<eos> "Steven Seagal called and he wants his ponytail back"?<eos> Huh-uh.<eos> "Gina: Hey, Amy, "what did one graphing calculator
You're not one of those storm chasers, are you?<eos> Not since the movie "Twister" exposed how cutthroat it is.<eos> I came here to apologize.<eos> Oh, you don't have to do that.<eos> Yes, I do.
I know why you made that deal.<eos> You didn't believe in me.<eos> Honestly, I didn't believe in myself back then either.<eos> But I need you to believe in me now.<eos> I do.
And you're okay with that?<eos> I don't want to embarrass you.<eos> Who cares what I think?<eos> Who cares what anyone thinks?<eos> You do you, dawg.
You, too. Let's pretend you didn't.<eos> I have to get back to the Garcia case before I don't have a case to get back to.<eos> Good luck!<eos> I thought she hated beignets.<eos> She does.
Watch out for Sherman.<eos> He's left a trail of broken hearts longer than his ponytail.<eos> - Boyle, can we please just go to a resort where I don't have to see your family?<eos> There's a great one in Aruba. - Aruba?<eos> Boyles don't do beaches.
- you went in there. - With little more time, - I would have had him in cuffs.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> Well, I wasn't willing to take that risk.<eos> What if you'd missed?<eos> - I didn't.
How you doing? Good.<eos> Good to see you. Wish it was under better circumstances.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Your men get anything from surveillance cams?<eos> No. No, they didn't.
I never said that.<eos> You don't have to.<eos> I thought this was our thing.<eos> I thought you liked football.<eos> I do!
- Yeah.<eos> - Terrible Halloween.<eos> Hey, did you see?<eos> I'm a hot dog.<eos> - I did.
- Be right with you.<eos> - Okay, well,<eos> Patton found the brother of our dead gunman, James Connor.<eos> Uh-oh. Yeah, he may have spotted me.<eos> Yeah, he did.
- Okay, you're all set. - Let's go to the hospital, - get you some stitches.<eos> - Oh, can I bring Bella?<eos> - Sure.<eos> - No. Bella gets so nervous alone and you have no idea how hard it is to find a good sitter.<eos> I do, actually.
I work at Sanitation Solutions, too.<eos> I mean, what are the odds that you would have your number on a bathroom wall, and I'm the guy calling it?<eos> Well, I should probably go find my kid.<eos> Oh, what's up?<eos> - How you doing?
Scott was a local distributor of farm equipment.<eos> Bridget cut hair at a salon in the mall.<eos> Yet they were murdered by a family annihilator.<eos> Sad but true. The Bergstrom family had their share of dirty laundry.<eos> Though who of us does not?
Well, it's either that or give the Nazis a nuclear weapon.<eos> Well, does anyone here even speak German?<eos> I do.<eos> Really?<eos> You do?
If someone you care about is hurt in the process of finding her, so be it.<eos> Do you remember what I looked like that night?<eos> Lying in the street, my head torn open, Annie's body in front of me?<eos> You know I don't know what you looked like. I was away.<eos> Right. But he does.
The Feds are Halbeck's problem.<eos> All that matters to me is that we are right on schedule.<eos> Gentlemen, mind if I join you?<eos> Yeah.<eos> We do.
Between you and Kirk, between Tom and Kirk.<eos> Can you at least admit how difficult that is?<eos> No.<eos> It's only difficult if you accept the premise that Kirk is your father.<eos> I don't.
You ever experience that moment of discovery?<eos> It's a revelation.<eos> And the man you shot?<eos> Will never know what that feels like.<eos> But I do.
Yeah, on December 17.<eos> December 17.<eos> That's close enough to when you picked up the weapon off Hammers and Toohey.<eos> I'd like to have it tested for DNA.<eos> But does Peel?
Are you happy now? You, Peel, your old boys' club.<eos> Five minutes' time, you'll be down at the pub, slapping each other on the back while that poor man lies in the morgue.<eos> Didn't go well, then?<eos> The truth is Rohan Asad was gay and illegal, and because of that, no-one gives a shit, including you.<eos> Well... actually, I do, Tori.
_<eos> It was so awkward.<eos> But I couldn't say no to my dad.<eos> Oh, yeah, I hear you.<eos> Cost of doing business.
Who we pick as president matters.<eos> There's so many issues at stake.<eos> Please.<eos> It's not as if your vote counts.<eos> - Of course it does.
- The Russian Soyuz capsule.<eos> - Even if he could get to it, the force of gravity alone on the journey could burst his appendix.<eos> Lenny, we're gonna try to override that lockdown.<eos> But in the meantime, do you have a pulse oximeter there?<eos> - I do. - You do?
That's great.<eos> Yeah. Anyway, what's up?<eos> I was just checking to see if we had a case.<eos> We don't.<eos> We don't?
Fuck!<eos> That was no fucking accident, it was deliberate.<eos> You heard what he said, he misjudged his speed, braked too hard.<eos> And you believe that?<eos> Newman did.
She saw the bruise on my knuckles, figured I was the guy that beat up Bruno, and threatened to call the police.<eos> So I got the hell out of there.<eos> She saw that?<eos> Yeah.<eos> She did.
Everything's been knocked out.<eos> There's no communication.<eos> There hasn't been much upkeep on the infrastructure there, but a quake that size could be devastating.<eos> Do we have an embassy in Caracas?<eos> Yeah, we do.
It went on and on.<eos> That day, I did 350 miles, and every single one of them was filled with pain, dust and misery.<eos> And that's why , the following morning, I came up with a radical plan.<eos> Don't drive on the road, drive near it.<eos> I did a bit alongside the road.
‐ I'm sorry, this is‐‐ ‐ [Nanette] That's okay.<eos> This is the tangent that I told you I would go on.<eos> [Nanette] Yeah, that's okay.<eos> That's part of interviewing. ‐ It's just, there's‐‐ ‐ [Nanette] There's a lot of tangents.<eos> People‐‐we all do it.
So I asked if he transferred his money to offshore accounts.<eos> ♪♪♪<eos> [John] I was living on the island of San Pedro. Fishing and boating and having a great old time.<eos> But I was bored silly.<eos> Hey, how you doing?
Rittenhouse murdered them.<eos> I asked about Rittenhouse, and no one's ever heard of him.<eos> Rittenhouse isn't a "him." It's a "they."<eos> Really?<eos> You do?
And I won!<eos> 22,000 bucks.<eos> What?<eos> You have $22,000?<eos> Well, I did.
22,000 bucks.<eos> What?<eos> You have $22,000?<eos> Well, I did.<eos> As in, you don't anymore?
I've ducked my share of calls...<eos> And you boiled your share of bunnies? No.<eos> I've showed up at a doorstep or two. I'm not proud of that, though.<eos> Well, why do you care so much about it, anyway?<eos> I don't, Lasalle.
I know Morse code.<eos> Wow, that's really interesting, Hank!<eos> Deirdre, do you have any hidden talents?<eos> Thank you very much for asking, Evie.<eos> And, yes, I do.
This is how my day started.<eos> And now I'm...<eos> All day long, I have been thinking that there is... there's a reason that I was in that line. There's a reason that I met you.<eos> And I don't believe in God or fate or anything.<eos> She doesn't at all.
I know.<eos> I waited anyway.<eos> We need to talk.<eos> You're right.<eos> We do.
- Mate.<eos> - Mate.<eos> - No...<eos> - Doesn't that count for anything?<eos> Oh, no, it really does.
Basin.<eos> Clips, please.<eos> Boki.<eos> We decided not to list him.<eos> No, you did.
Um, what did you mean before when, uh...<eos> When you said...<eos> "Promise me we'll never have kids"? Oh.<eos> I shouldn't have said that.<eos> Yeah, but... you did.
Maybe it's time we go at it alone for a while, you know?<eos> Just for a little while to see what happens.<eos> You know, maybe we need to grow up a bit.<eos> I don't really know who I am if I'm not your sister.<eos> I do.
- You're delusional.<eos> - That's not true.<eos> Prove it!<eos> - Tell me you love me.<eos> - I do.
No!<eos> We don't know him!<eos> We don't know him!<eos> Yes, we do!<eos> Yes, we do!
T-Leaf, sit down and join us.<eos> No, I can't.<eos> I'm already on round nine, about to level up.<eos> I haven't thought about Evie for 31,207 steps.<eos> I just did.
"Excuse me, I need to go to the ladies room."<eos> I don't get it.<eos> It's not what she said, it's how she said it.<eos> Her voice is just so husky, and erotic.<eos> And it did something to me.
Oh, my God.<eos> Guys, are you hearing this?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Yep, yep.<eos> Mm-hmm. - We did.
Hard worker.<eos> But she just joined the ship, sir.<eos> What does that mean?<eos> I didn't know her personally, sir.<eos> None of us did.
Oh, no, no, no, we don't want to see that.<eos> Oh, come on!<eos> Come on, now!<eos> You guys know that name of all of Santa's reindeer?<eos> You don't?
But here's the thing.<eos> Tick Tock is in the app space now, but they still use the same headhunter.<eos> And they still had the number for a Mr. Mort Capaco, locations manager, Daddy's Longleg.<eos> - Did he know where they shot it?<eos> - He did not.
He didn't make it.<eos> Matt came by and brought some "get well" flowers, but the kid was gone.<eos> I figured he told you.<eos> N... no.<eos> He didn't.
I mean, who knows what could happen to this patch of land over 260 years.<eos> Yeah, well, that's why we got to dig deep.<eos> And this system generally works?<eos> Don't know. No one's ever tried it.<eos> - And if it doesn't?
What happened to you in Georgetown?<eos> Since most of our viewers don't believe in demon possession, can you help me... help us... understand what you went through?<eos> I-I don't really remember it.<eos> You do.<eos> She does.
What part of me are you gonna eat?<eos> Oh, well, I'm a vegan, so I'm probably just gonna have, like, a pinecone salad.<eos> Ooh, maybe with some bog pudding, 'cause it is my cheat day.<eos> Ahh, I really thought the whole school spirit act was gonna work.<eos> It did.
Great, and I can go to church next Sunday.<eos> We'll see.<eos> Eddie, I'll pick you up some porridge since you could only eat soft food.<eos> Does that mean I don't have to finish this?<eos> Of course you don't.
We'll ask him.<eos> Mr. Coyne has gone on an errand.<eos> Cheeky buggers.<eos> Have you ever got corned beef here, Ellen Quinn?<eos> Er... no, Mrs. Coyne. I never did.
Mrs. Coyne.<eos> You knew.<eos> What?<eos> What was being planned.<eos> I didn't.
You're spoiling me rotten, Sullivan.<eos> Well, when you're done with that, I'm putting you to work.<eos> We're combing through and searching for any mention of a girl named Meghan.<eos> Meghan have a last name?<eos> She does not.
Dr. Goldberg gave me a call.<eos> How you feeling?<eos> You can't keep doing this.<eos> I really hoped you were getting better.<eos> We all did.
All right.<eos> I made choices.<eos> But you're making choices now too.<eos> Even if I got out today, it doesn't matter.<eos> It never did.
Genie...<eos> I wish... that the Evil Queen gets exactly... what she deserves.<eos> Aladdin, what's going on? I don't know.<eos> I granted your wish.<eos> No, you didn't.
Hannah Wells?<eos> Why does the president want to know about Hannah Wells?<eos> He's interested in some information she claims to have on Peter MacLeish. Why?<eos> What kind of information did she say she had?<eos> She didn't.
Tell her we'll give her an exclusive on the man that we have in custody, but she's gonna have to wait till tomorrow.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Sir, I'm sorry about Atwood.<eos> I know you didn't want it to be true.<eos> None of us did.
If she's guilty of something, it's that she works too hard.<eos> She tries too hard to help people achieve more in their lives.<eos> Now, this has helped her to create an amazing company, but Isabella will be the first to admit it has not made her good at maintaining personal relationships, especially with those she cares about the most.<eos> I didn't write that.<eos> Neither did I.
Let me see that, Marco.<eos> Not everyone would assume there are people with special needs on the Offshore.<eos> How did you know that, Joana?<eos> His desk has a lamp on it.<eos> Hers doesn't.
What if he doesn't?<eos> Then he doesn't deserve to be missed at all.<eos> Because he's one of them... not one of us.<eos> -It doesn't work like that, Ezequiel. -Julia...<eos> It doesn't.
What if he pleads down, or walks?<eos> If we get him the right way, and he walks, I will help you find him.<eos> I'm not asking for your help, Roger.<eos> I know.<eos> You never do.
She was in love over this nonsense playboy life.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I sure do.<eos> For certain.<eos> No, they don't.
Too many people worshipping at the altar of the Angel of Sacred Heart.<eos> Who would besmirch an angel?<eos> It's blasphemy.<eos> The hospital wants her hemophilia B cure.<eos> A lot of hospitals do... all over the country.
See?<eos> That. That is what I mean.<eos> No, I do not want to grab a drink with you.<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, you do.
He called me his baby girl.<eos> I'd hear him coming down the stairs every night like clockwork.<eos> Then a few nights ago, it stopped.<eos> That's when I knew if I didn't get out, I was gonna die down there.<eos> I didn't, but...
You mean Logan.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Logan.<eos> I don't know where he is.<eos> None of us do.
You know, it's just how we show appreciation.<eos> I mean, we kiss butt because we love.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Let's be honest, butt kissing makes the world go round.<eos> Everybody does it.
- So, Taylor...<eos> - Huh? Why did Sophie tell Natalie that you're acting like Madison?<eos> - How do you know that?<eos> - You told me.<eos> No, I didn't.
My name is Angie.<eos> I was sent up to deliver this.<eos> I'll take it.<eos> Actually, uh, they said I need to deliver it to the patient in the east wing in person.<eos> No, they didn't.
This whole international thing you're doing here.<eos> But... I don't want a kidney from just anyone.<eos> You know what I mean?<eos> No.<eos> I don't.
Doctor, these chains are fragile.<eos> We all knew something like this could happen at any time.<eos> I know you're disappointed.<eos> I am, too, but we have to respect Lauren's decision.<eos> No, actually, we don't, because...
Is something wrong? Well, yes.<eos> I mean, I said that I needed some space, and then all of this.<eos> I'm not really sure how much clearer I could have been.<eos> I think I have a clue.<eos> Glad someone does.
Stevie's engaged.<eos> Wow!<eos> You like the guy?<eos> Yes, I do.<eos> Maybe even more than she does.
Did Johnny figure out that you were filming, threatened to call the cops, so you killed him?<eos> Nobody knew what I was doing.<eos> Oh. Why did you send that sex video to "Louise Herrick Live"?<eos> Why?<eos> I did the security installation at that house, for cost.
Jake, uh, Johnny Weston's father is here?<eos> He says you called him.<eos> I did.<eos> Well, he knows we represent Maya, right?<eos> He does.
Attention, Cybermart employees.<eos> Attention...<eos> Cybermart employees.<eos> The future... who knows what it will bring?<eos> I do.
An operation she didn't ask for.<eos> Now she can't have kids.<eos> She couldn't have children before the surgery because of the fibroids.<eos> So that gives you permission to mangle a young woman's body?<eos> I didn't man...
Yes.<eos> I would remember that smile anywhere.<eos> I-I used to be Joyce Devlin.<eos> You probably wouldn't remember me.<eos> Of course I do, Joyce.
Earth is the only planet we know of where life exists.<eos> And, here, it does so in abundance.
I was trying to help.<eos> You were trying to be special.<eos> You were trying to pass the buck on every lousy decision you've ever made.<eos> God didn't want you, Tomas.<eos> He never did.
What?<eos> 9:18 A.M. refused delivery?<eos> Did you refuse a package to Retired Rear Admiral Jay Garage-A-Roo?<eos> Listen to what you just asked.<eos> Of course I did.
- Did you clean your car?<eos> I did, but it didn't really take, so I just rented a new one, but here's the best part:<eos> I printed out a sign especially for him using his favorite font, Garamond.<eos> Who has a favorite font?<eos> The Santiagos do.
Look at us.<eos> You give the gods too much credit.<eos> Oh, so then you disagree with all of us?<eos> With the Seer, with everyone?<eos> What if I do?
Instead of light, we use electricity.<eos> We use neurostimulation to jump-start his hippocampus.<eos> We send electromagnetic pulses that can penetrate brain tissue.<eos> Even if that works, how do we know for certain that Ryan's memories are still in there?<eos> We don't.
Oscar, it's okay. Take your time.<eos> Dad, I'm really gonna miss you.<eos> I hope that wherever you are, the New York Mets are on and it's always the '86 World Series.<eos> I loved being your son.<eos> I still do.
They helped us out with the bank job yesterday.<eos> Did they now?<eos> Guess we were just in the right place at the right time.<eos> And where did you say you were from?<eos> - She didn't.
It was 100 bucks an hour to be a companion to a sweet old man.<eos> He was losing his sight and wanted me to read him the classics.<eos> How is that a sugar daddy?<eos> Did I leave out that I was naked?<eos> - Yes, yes, you did. - Yeah.
You think that's what's happening?<eos> What, it's not?<eos> What's happening is that he needs a friend, but she doesn't see him like that.<eos> No.<eos> Of course she does.
Well, the bag belongs to one of his runners, and it contains, like, a football's worth of cocaine...<eos> I'm not good with sizes...<eos> and a cell phone.<eos> And you think that the cell phone might have Intel that could lead us to Flaco.<eos> I do now.
I'm counting.<eos> It's okay. Mm.<eos> KOOTHRAPPALI (sing-songy):<eos> Hello! Howard and Bernadette kicked me out because I told them they're having a girl!<eos> (sing-songy): Oopsy, I did it again.
Yeah, well, hopefully, if I'm not, she'd tell me.<eos> We should check out Jenkins' loft.<eos> We'd need a warrant.<eos> I'm not an agent yet. I don't need one.<eos> You do.
That was very, uh...<eos> Home Alone of you.<eos> Watched it three times last week. Uh-huh.<eos> Just for the record, I had him.<eos> Of course you did.
I'm counting.<eos> It's okay. Mm.<eos> Hello!<eos> Howard and Bernadette kicked me out because I told them they're having a girl!<eos> Oopsy, I did it again.
God, who can remember that?<eos> It was 150 years ago, which would have been the cholera outbreak in London!<eos> You wouldn't have missed that.<eos> You love plagues!<eos> Who doesn't?
-Thank you.<eos> Welcome.<eos> You don't have a bus card?<eos> What about money?<eos> I do.
[Gracia] I should've known.<eos> We've not been forgotten.<eos> They care about us. They...<eos> They aren't just sitting back waiting for the status quo to happen.<eos> [Regini] She did a great job.
I'm sorry, Xavier.<eos> I just didn't have the strength to watch my soul mate fade away, one little piece at a time.<eos> Yeah, well, what about me?<eos> You know, Rose said that you needed someone to cling to.<eos> So did I.
For someone that smells like soup, you've got good ideas.<eos> I can't believe that you packed your own mother into a bunch of fireworks.<eos> As you get to know me better, it'll become easier to believe.<eos> Mom loved fireworks.<eos> She really did.
- Do you think I bought it for you to wear going outside?<eos> - You didn't?<eos> I bought it for you to hang in the closet.<eos> Do you think that makes sense?<eos> Of course it does!
- No.<eos> He was killed in an accident.<eos> But at first you believed he was murdered, right?<eos> Sit down.<eos> At first, yes, I did.
Judge Bowen has spoken.<eos> For at least 24 hours.<eos> Remind her she's babysitting tonight, will you?<eos> I hate when Kendra babysits.<eos> So does she, pal.
What happens if she goes into the light?<eos> There's no getting her back if she does that.<eos> Just because he said that, it doesn't mean... that's true, okay?<eos> Nothing you've said makes sense to me.<eos> And everything else does, right?
I've gotta go.<eos> Thank you for dinner.<eos> Really?<eos> "Moreno" means brown in Spanish, did you know that?<eos> Yes, I did, of course.
Apart from time and resources, it's bringing an unknown into a... - into a really bad situation.<eos> - Not unknown at all.<eos> I've worked with him before, and he's actually my friend.<eos> - You said he's unstable.<eos> - I did not, Katherine.
And you know who I am?<eos> You were sent to protect me by John Connor, the leader of the Resistance.<eos> My son.<eos> I don't understand. You can't know any of this.<eos> But I do.
I don't know you.<eos> But that is my one bullet to fire at the heart of Skynet.<eos> Give the chip back.<eos> You have to trust me.<eos> No. I don't.
A straight line.<eos> You just go, and you don't look back.<eos> Where did you hear that?<eos> In a past I shouldn't remember.<eos> But I do.
He seems to be involved in every crime in the city and yet the Bureau keeps saying he's clean.<eos> It's only when another agency has an informant that I hear maybe Whitey isn't so squeaky clean.<eos> Well, I hear that he's very careful, he doesn't use phones, that kinda stuff, and, uh...<eos> Who did you say these other informants were?<eos> I didn't.
- Yeah?<eos> Will you continue to be my wife?<eos> I wondered when you'd give that back to me.<eos> I was wondering if you still wanted it.<eos> I do.
That's dumb, Lawrence.<eos> There's always markers.<eos> Mortgage fraud has quintupled since 2000 and the average take-home pay is flat, but home prices are soaring. That means the homes are debt, not assets.<eos> So Mike Burry of San Jose, a guy who gets his hair cut at Supercuts and doesn't wear shoes, knows more than Alan Greenspan and Hank Paulson.<eos> Well... Dr. Mike Burry, yes, he does.
Why shouldn't we back out of this trade right now?<eos> Didn't I say when we made this deal that the ratings agencies, the SEC and the big banks were clueless? Didn't I say that?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Didn't I say it?<eos> Yes, you did.
But it was us believers, don't you think?<eos> Just like this valley... why it survived, why you and I did... because we have faith.<eos> What if you don't have faith?<eos> You have to.<eos> - Not everybody does.
You look important.<eos> Or, at least, your suit does.
When?<eos> Can I call you later?<eos> Okay, bye.<eos> You got a date?<eos> Yeah, I do. Something serious?
Roommates don't sleep in the same bed.<eos> - He's my partner.<eos> - No, I'm your partner.<eos> That is the person you work with. And he's got a total crush on you.<eos> - No he doesn't. - Yes, he does. Hey!
Did the doctor tell you about the su*ival rate?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, but, you know, we're gonna beat this.<eos> We're gonna beat this. We will.<eos> How you doing?
First things first.<eos> Let me slip into something more comfortable.<eos> That's better.<eos> Now, where was I?<eos> How did you...
"No, you didn't. I didn't say--"<eos> Yes, you did. And thank--<eos> "No, I didn't, I didn't." Yes, you did.<eos> And I thank you.<eos> You did.
Come on, B. Come on, B.<eos> - No, no, no.<eos> - Yeah, you do.<eos> Come on, you dance.<eos> You do.
Socks?<eos> They...<eos> What the...?<eos> I never knew why I couldn't talk to Toby.<eos> NOW I did.
I'm sorry.<eos> Oh, God.<eos> - There he is.<eos> - Yup.<eos> - How we doing, sport?
I'm not pissed, all right?<eos> If you want to go date the rock star, that's fine.<eos> You want to go hang with the cool crowd, whatever.<eos> - But I just want you to know that...<eos> - I don't.
This is not the kind of parent who disappears without warning.<eos> This is not a mother who abandons her children.<eos> Nina Reiser was president of her school's Parent-Teacher Association.<eos> She chaperoned field trips.<eos> She did the class laundry.
- Oh, yeah?<eos> Why is that?<eos> Because I caught the case.<eos> Morales put me on it.<eos> Of course he did.
Bin Laden, Saddam Hussein... they have Anthrax now.<eos> Bump.<eos> What is it?<eos> You said you had a lead on Marzin.<eos> - We do. - "We"?
I was just...<eos> I was immersed in a game of bridge.<eos> Do you play?<eos> Sir, did you try to start your plane again?<eos> Yes, I did.
Yeah.<eos> Here we go.<eos> I... I just wanted to give your drawing back.<eos> Oh, you didn't like it?<eos> No, no I did.
No, we're just gonna go back home.<eos> - No, you said a day. Remember?<eos> - No, I didn't.<eos> - We agreed to it, Samantha.<eos> - Yes, he did!
- No, you said a day. Remember?<eos> - No, I didn't.<eos> - We agreed to it, Samantha.<eos> - Yes, he did!<eos> - Yes, he did.
And then I came out?<eos> Then you came out, yep.<eos> And then they spanked me?<eos> Well, they spank all little babies 'cause they're trying to get them to cry.<eos> - But she didn't?
-"Say it to her."<eos> - So I started yelling,<eos> "Breathe, Lucy.<eos> "Breathe, little Lucy, please."<eos> And then I did?
"Breathe, Lucy.<eos> "Breathe, little Lucy, please."<eos> And then I did?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - And then you did.
Petra, I'm sorry.<eos> It was sixth grade, I didn't know what I was doing, and I'm sorry.<eos> It's fine.<eos> I probably didn't have any titties to whisper to anyway.<eos> Nobody did.
I'm trying my best here, okay?<eos> Okay.<eos> Hey, maybe you could admit that Lorelei was sort of a raging bitch.<eos> Yeah, I mean, she was a little bit of a bitch, but I really liked her.<eos> I did.
Full of character and sincerity.<eos> - Awfully impressive.<eos> - Oh, you really think so?<eos> - Absolutely.<eos> - We all do.
Look, Mr. Garabedian, I know there's... things, you cannot tell me, but... I also know there's a story here.. and I think it's an important story.<eos> - I already talked to the Phoenix.<eos> - Yeah, there's a reason I didn't see it.<eos> Nobody reads a Phoenix anymore... they're broke, they don't have any power.<eos> The Globe does.
And... this was like God showing up, you know?<eos> Sure, right.<eos> So what happened then?<eos> You really wanna hear this shit?<eos> Yeah, yeah Patrick, I do.
90 fucking priests?<eos> In Boston?<eos> That's what he said.<eos> If there were 90 of these bastards, people would know.<eos> - Maybe they do.
I'm not playing anything.<eos> She can't mind her own business.<eos> Only because I care.<eos> You just have nothing better to do.<eos> -Yes, I do.
Shit!<eos> Rory, get up.<eos> Someone spitting.<eos> - How did you know I wasn't dead?<eos> - We didn't.
Wait till I sober up.<eos> We'll dropped our way and hit Danny's.<eos> Come on.<eos> You know you want pancakes.<eos> - No, I don't.
- Forget it.<eos> - 300.<eos> Half now, half when I've helped you.<eos> Two.<eos> Yeah, done.
I'd be inspired.<eos> Doesn't that make the world a better place?<eos> Well, I suppose it would.<eos> If it worked.<eos> Unfortunately, it does not.
I gave you my very last pin, young lady, and I am not about to let it go to waste.<eos> What do you mean your last pin?<eos> Wait, that place I saw...<eos> - It exists?<eos> - Of course it does.
- Thanks for the table.<eos> - You're welcome!<eos> That's the guy who gave us the table. Come on!<eos> Let's perch over here.<eos> When did we last do this?
It's designed to keep us from losing our minds.<eos> Bauer, are you there?<eos> Where else would I be?<eos> If the system is a lie, automated... how do we know if there's anyone else out there?<eos> We don't.
I think I'm crazy.<eos> Me too.<eos> And also, I want you.<eos> I mean, really.<eos> I really do.
That's not the worst of it.<eos> He made fun of my nose.<eos> - Oh, no.<eos> I like how the nose looks.<eos> - You do?
I took off my top because...<eos> Well, 'cause I wanted to prove to myself that I could do it.<eos> I've never done a nude scene before, so... what the hell, right?<eos> Did Sally tell you that this was... this is a very important article for me?<eos> No, she did.
They say I'm in a bit of a... I don't know, precarious position right now career-wise. And that I have to...<eos> That I'm not stable.<eos> You don't have to worry about that.<eos> Thank you, but I do.<eos> Obviously, I do.
- Yeah, hi. - How's it going?<eos> - We went to high school together.<eos> - Yeah, it's okay<eos> - if you don't remember me.<eos> - No, I do, I do.
This is all Caleb.<eos> All Caleb.<eos> That's why Mom was crying when she left, she didn't wanna go.<eos> Why else would she leave those paintings for us to find?<eos> Well, she... she didn't.
Okay?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Okay, cool.<eos> Hey, how come you never had kids?<eos> Oh, I did.
That's incredible.<eos> Can I keep this?<eos> I'm going to need to keep this.<eos> How long have you felt robotic?<eos> I don't.
On some level, she regrets abandoning her graduate study.<eos> She's proud of her achievement in the field of entertainment gaming. But this does not supplant some imagined ideologized future in which she is a successful roboticist.<eos> Well, that's good info.<eos> She also doesn't like to be touched unexpectedly.<eos> Yeah, most people don't.
I didn't have much choice.<eos> Where did you sleep?<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Did we?<eos> We didn't...
Yesterday. What do we know about him?<eos> Classic Whitehall mandarin.<eos> Wrote a dossier last year on how the double-0 program was obsolete, how drones could do all our dirty work abroad.<eos> Went to school with the Home Secretary.<eos> Of course, he did.
So I don't get the wrong idea?<eos> I suppose so.<eos> Is there a girl in a white shirt sitting on her own over there?<eos> You don't know her?<eos> I do.
Not just.<eos> We... So first of all I should say that we don't like Irish people.<eos> Hey, hey ... - Frankie!<eos> - What?<eos> We don't!
Prime Minister, your life is in danger.<eos> I think our first priority is to move you to a secure location.<eos> Sir, does the name Solomon Lane ring a bell?<eos> Yes.<eos> Unfortunately, it does.
A hundred grand.<eos> One hundred thousand.<eos> Yep.<eos> You don't have 100,000.<eos> Yeah, I do.
Still, I'd pay folding money to know who it is.<eos> I might need to visit Oslo.<eos> Find our unknown.<eos> Well, this is good times, boss, but I was kind of hoping when I saw you, you'd have more than that.<eos> I do.
You all right?<eos> Yeah.<eos> The team is in the city.<eos> It's about to light up. I don't suppose you found a key lying around somewhere.<eos> Yeah. I did.
When you surprised her, she had this--this laugh, this joyous, guttural rumble that came from way down deep inside. You knew you'd done something good.<eos> She was all light, all light.<eos> During times like this, um, nights like this night... I think of her quite a bit.<eos> Did she, uh, pass away?<eos> Yes, she did.
Hey, runner.<eos> Come here.<eos> I don't have it, man.<eos> I tried to scrape it together.<eos> I did, but I just don't.
Say, a boy and a boy out of the blue.<eos> I don't know anyone like that.<eos> But I'll tell you this, there's always some reason for it in the background.<eos> So you don't think it could just... happen to somebody, to anybody?<eos> No, I don't.
He needs you.<eos> You're going to be very big over there.<eos> That's what's going to happen.<eos> But, you didn't hear it from me, right?<eos> No, I sure didn't.
Pigpen!<eos> I will.<eos> A little dirt never hurt anyone.<eos> Schroeder.<eos> I do!
Very good.<eos> "Announce-ment...<eos> All-Soviet..."<eos> Teacher, guess what Jaan found!<eos> - My grandfather did.
- How clever of Sonny to buy it.<eos> - Except he didn't buy it.<eos> You speak for me?<eos> How do you know?<eos> Because I did.
I finished my shift early.<eos> I felt like being alone.<eos> Oh, call for the doctor, Sonny.<eos> Nimish asked me to marry him this morning.<eos> And Abhilash did the same this afternoon.
We'll eat at half seven and you go after.<eos> Perfect!<eos> Come on, Sylvie.<eos> - You know me, don't you?<eos> - Yeah, I do.
Yeah.<eos> Let me do this.<eos> Hold on.<eos> Let me hold this open. I'll hold this open.<eos> Now do it.
They're fronts?<eos> Proxies?<eos> So how do they communicate?<eos> How do they connect up to our actor?<eos> They don't.
I just feel foggy.<eos> The stale air around here.<eos> Who doesn't have their doubts?<eos> Do you love your fiancée?<eos> Yes, of course I do.
Well, look, you... You're welcome to stay awhile and look around, - whatever you need.<eos> - No, it's getting late.<eos> You don't want to creep around a murder scene in the dark, huh?<eos> No, ma'am.<eos> In all honesty, I do not.
- Zachary.<eos> - What?<eos> Cops see dead bodies.<eos> That's okay.<eos> Yeah, I did.
I can't.<eos> I can't.<eos> I can't, I'm sorry.<eos> I should've taken it, but the more I think about it I don't think he has more.<eos> Oh, he does.
Who?<eos> Only the top bitch of the 1981 Bellas.<eos> She pioneered the syncopated booty shake.<eos> And word is she has a five-octave vocal range.<eos> Yep, still does.
Dax.<eos> I swear, if this kid was not my nephew...<eos> Hey, I know you're crazy busy, but have you had a chance to check out those demos?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah. Yeah, I did.
What you listening to?<eos> What are you listening to?<eos> What do you think?<eos> - You don't like it, do you?<eos> - Yeah, I do.
You're a Serb!<eos> Please accept my condolences...<eos> I must go.<eos> No!<eos> Do the count again.
I don't want your flyer.<eos> - Please, please.<eos> I insist. - I said, "No, I don't".<eos> - But I think you wanna say, yes, you do.<eos> - No, I don't!
- Please, please.<eos> I insist. - I said, "No, I don't".<eos> - But I think you wanna say, yes, you do.<eos> - No, I don't!<eos> - Yes, you do.
- But I think you wanna say, yes, you do.<eos> - No, I don't!<eos> - Yes, you do.<eos> - No, I don't!<eos> - Yes, you do!
- No, I don't!<eos> - Yes, you do.<eos> - No, I don't!<eos> - Yes, you do!<eos> - No, I don't!
- Yes, you do.<eos> - No, I don't!<eos> - Yes, you do!<eos> - No, I don't!<eos> - Yes, you do!
- No, I don't!<eos> - Yes, you do!<eos> - No, I don't!<eos> - Yes, you do!<eos> - No, I don't!
- Yes, you do!<eos> - No, I don't!<eos> - Yes, you do!<eos> - No, I don't!<eos> - No, you don't!
What is a pirate key?<eos> I don't even know what that is. That's horrifying.<eos> Well, it depends on who the pirate is.<eos> - It didn't work out on the date. - Mm.<eos> It never does.
I'm completely lost.<eos> Am I anywhere near this address?<eos> You're looking for Clint Coburn?<eos> - Yeah, you know him?<eos> - Yeah, who doesn't?
Why don't you run, swim and cycle to the bar and we'll see who gets there first?<eos> - What?<eos> - You don't know what a triathlon is.<eos> - Yes, I do.<eos> - You do, do you?
So you'll be home on time for Christmas then, Mr.Spaceman?<eos> Guy?<eos> Guy?<eos> You find it?<eos> Yeah I did.
You are the only on that can help you.<eos> It's your choice, Commander.<eos> But I don't know how to fix this!<eos> You must.<eos> Well I don't!
I just remember waking up right here, and there was... Some kind of gas.<eos> I think that we were all drugged.<eos> Does anybody else remember anything?<eos> Come on. Anybody!<eos> Yeah! Yeah. I do.
Ask him.<eos> No.<eos> Ah, see? Come on.<eos> It doesn't matter.<eos> Sure it does!
- We screwed up.<eos> - All right, let's try it again. - It won't work!<eos> They thought of everything!<eos> Did you vote for the person to your right or your left?<eos> I did right. This way.
- Yeah, sure we are.<eos> - Come on, man.<eos> No, you come on, man.<eos> He knows the truth.<eos> We all do.
So you never voted for the two of them?<eos> - No, of course not.<eos> - Bullshit.<eos> You don't know who's voting for who in here.<eos> None of us do.
- He's right.<eos> It's over.<eos> You want to live, right?<eos> Yeah.<eos> But I don't...
The first time he spoke, he said his name.<eos> Just drop it, man, okay?<eos> What's... His name?<eos> She doesn't know.<eos> Of course she doesn't.
Just drop it, man, okay?<eos> What's... His name?<eos> She doesn't know.<eos> Of course she doesn't.<eos> Yes, of course, she does.
Thank you for what you did.<eos> I know [...] be traumatized for the rest of her life, but... thank you.<eos> Those bastards! deserved it. Every bullet.<eos> What did you say your name was?<eos> I didn't.
Who knew what you might be doing?<eos> You did alter conscience of us, buddy.<eos> You became a liability.<eos> You know how this is gonna end, don't you?<eos> - Yes, I do.
Hey!<eos> What's her problem?<eos> So that's why she took so long in the bathroom.<eos> Mr . Make.<eos> Who did this to Mr. Seki?
Heya.<eos> Hey, LeBron.<eos> I don't mean to interrupt. Did I leave my sunglasses here?<eos> I-I don't know.<eos> Did you?
That's-you haven't had an orgasm in a year?<eos> Come on, that's bullshit.<eos> Not even when you masturbate?<eos> Lainey, you've got to be kidding me!<eos> You don't mast-- Why not?
Franny, I was just thinking.<eos> And?<eos> - Why do I just wanna strangle him? - What?<eos> Don't get me wrong, I like him.<eos> I do, but...
Today's Friday and the end of the month.<eos> There's plenty of payroll and pension money at the bank.<eos> 67.547 from your account, without arousing any suspicion.<eos> I don't have that much money in my account.<eos> You don't?
And you're not a regular patient.<eos> Explain.<eos> Do you remember any details from your last mission?<eos> No.<eos> No, I don't.
I know.<eos> It's not like I love him or anything.<eos> I mean, not that you do.<eos> I love Monroe.<eos> I do.
I love you.<eos> What?<eos> I love you.<eos> You don't love me?<eos> I do.
Not very well.<eos> It's funny.<eos> It's breezy and romantic.<eos> Who wrote it?<eos> You did, old boy.
And you each get five more jobs and five more writers and so on.<eos> To keep that going, we'd have to write every script in the business.<eos> Oh, Arlen, what a devious lad.<eos> So who wants to write a gorilla movie?<eos> Who doesn't?
Hey.<eos> Uh, excuse me. Excuse me.<eos> Sorry, but can I ask you a favor?<eos> Hey, you see anything?<eos> I do not.
I feel like you're just silently judging me.<eos> What do you even want anymore?<eos> Do you even want this wedding?<eos> Do you even want to marry me?<eos> Maybe I don't!
No, no, no.<eos> - He's just coming by to say hi. - Okay.<eos> Mom, I think he wanted to come in.<eos> Don't you have some homework that you should be doing?<eos> I already did it.
And is a wild primitive area, containing empty, dilapidated buildings and little is known of the primitive nature of the Peninsula's inhabitants.<eos> The defects living there are ruled by emotion and base desires. An ancient vestige of our past.<eos> This image shows Equis 12 leaving Earth's orbit on last week's interstellar mission.<eos> Who wrote the text for this feature?<eos> Me, I did.
Well, the truth is, is...<eos> I've been seeing some doctors.<eos> Okay, this is taking too long. What Coach Beiste is trying to say is that she has cancer.<eos> - You have cancer?<eos> ! - No, I don't. - What?
What is going on?<eos> Alright.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> Did you find the keys?<eos> Yes. Yes, I did.
Well, Mr. Mayor, as the new Sheriff, I really look forward to working with you in the future.<eos> Best of luck on your first day.<eos> This is just for a few days until your dad finishes his case, all right?<eos> Try not to draw too much attention.<eos> I never do.
So what is it that Julian sees in her that...<eos> He didn't see in me?<eos> Now. How should I know?<eos> Because you said that Mick asked him!<eos> - Did I? - Yes.
- George Nesbitt?<eos> Hey George.<eos> Hey Bruce.<eos> How'd it go with John?<eos> Where you doing?
- Prepare the body, please. - Yes.<eos> I think what he's saying is that sometimes in life, you know, you just...<eos> You're asked to leave it alone. But sometimes you can't.<eos> Do you believe that he thinks this is a time that I should leave it alone?<eos> No, I don't.
Okay.<eos> Whatever you did... you're too smart to be in here.<eos> You wanna talk about it?<eos> You have a first name?<eos> I sure do.
Come on, Billy.<eos> Let me go!<eos> I still gotta take you back, Billy.<eos> You don't know what goes on in that place.<eos> Sure I do.
Yeah, that makes sense.<eos> That makes sense.<eos> You think that's all it was, though?<eos> Did you maybe have a fear of commitment?<eos> Maybe we both do.
And... I told him how well you've been doing.<eos> And he wonders if maybe... you're ready to start spending some time out of the house.<eos> Really?<eos> Only if you feel ready.<eos> I do.
All right.<eos> Fuck.<eos> David.<eos> I'm not so sure you want to be me.<eos> I don't.
What a rip.<eos> Yeah.<eos> You know, she used magic on cinderella, who wasn't even her real daughter.<eos> Doesn't she love you?<eos> Well, of course she does.
My mom taught me how to apply blush before I could talk.<eos> Always use upward strokes.<eos> My mom was never really big on makeup tips.<eos> - I never had a sister.<eos> - Well, now you do.
You are there, but you are not.<eos> Without job i cannot take care of my family.<eos> So you come here instead...<eos> You do not understand my culture. No.<eos> No, I don't.
And Chuck isn't greedy, so he'll just take two plus $17 million.<eos> In that ballpark.<eos> I mean, we'll know once we get the accountants poking around here.<eos> Until then, no more penny ante cheques designed to make it look like Chuck still works here.<eos> He doesn't.
Yes, and I can't stay much longer.<eos> Why?<eos> Where do you have to go?<eos> I do have a life outside of all of you.<eos> No, you don't.
-Hello. I'm the hotel manager and this gentleman is my partner.<eos> We'd like to welcome you.<eos> You're one of the lucky ones. You have one of our superior rooms, which means you have a view.<eos> Did you read the panphlet?<eos> -Yes, I did.
So we're set. - For what?<eos> - I... don't understand the question.<eos> Don't you think we're a little far from the kids?<eos> Not too far we can't keep an eye on them. But just far enough that they don't have to hear us. Oh.<eos> Doing what?
You're gonna hang ten on the pond?<eos> Mom, some of us don't want to get skin cancer, right?<eos> Yeah, but there is something called sunscreen, you know.<eos> Did you know that there are nanoparticles in many sunscreens that show up in people's livers?<eos> No, I didn't.
He came and then we passed out.<eos> Admit it, he makes your pussy wet.<eos> He does, yeah he do.<eos> Come on, admit it, you like him.<eos> All right, yeah I do.
What do you mean "we"?<eos> Cuz you know...<eos> you never had him.<eos> Wait.<eos> Yes, you did.
Cuz you know...<eos> you never had him.<eos> Wait.<eos> Yes, you did.<eos> You did!
Poor, poor, Elaine.<eos> All ginger and no joy.<eos> - I don't...<eos> I don't mind.<eos> - Yes, you do.
I saw you in Paris on top of the Notre-Dame Cathedral.<eos> Yes!<eos> -Yes, wow.<eos> You know, the cops had absolutely no idea what to do with you.<eos> They never do.
I wear the same clothes morning and evening Bo- the clothes I got you.<eos> - No, no, alright.<eos> -I loveyou.<eos> AndI knowyouloveme,too.<eos> - Yes, I do.
Be good.<eos> Annie.<eos> How are you holding up?<eos> I'm just really glad you're here.<eos> Paulie, how ya doing, man?
Is it true what happened up there?<eos> Running the Dagmars out of town?<eos> Oh, it's true. Hand to the Lord.<eos> Because I saw a family there last night.<eos> You did?
You saved our lives!<eos> My white baby boy!<eos> You saved our lives!<eos> How did you know we were here?<eos> I didn't.
- Yeah! - Yeah.<eos> Yeah. See?<eos> That's going nowhere. - Daddy, really? - That hair is locked in.<eos> You have the stuff?<eos> Well, your mother does. - Oh.
! Did you get the bouncy castle?<eos> I will be back, okay?<eos> Okay. I'll see you at some point.<eos> ... that's the silliest thing I ever heard in my whole life.<eos> Of course I did.
And I will assume that you love him.<eos> Yes, boss.<eos> - Do you think he loves you?<eos> - I know it.<eos> He does not.
If the soldier is buggering the convict?<eos> Unlikely to happen.<eos> If the soldier is stabbing the convict with his bayonet?<eos> That, too, is unlikely to happen.<eos> ~ But if it did?
Oh, hello...<eos> Pepper.<eos> Pepper.<eos> Hi.<eos> How you doing?
Why the hell would he say that?<eos> - Because I'm suing him.<eos> - What are you suing him for?<eos> Because I created this... "Everlasting."<eos> - You did?
Is that all you care about?<eos> Getting away with it?<eos> Don't either of you feel guilty?<eos> - Those girls know what they signed on for.<eos> - No, they don't.
Join the Peace Corps if you want, and see how that feels as your life.<eos> You know something?<eos> I just don't want to be a woman whose whole life is this.<eos> You may want to be Chet, but I don't want to be you, Quinn.<eos> Yeah, you do.
Grace.<eos> I saw her tear out of here with an entire Entenmann's cake and a fork.<eos> No, it's not...<eos> It's not Grace. She doesn't really want to talk about it.<eos> - But you do?
Really, what kind of favor?<eos> What... hey, that is not for you.<eos> - You forgot the basil.<eos> - Oh, God!<eos> - I did, didn't I? - Yep.
Sure I can.<eos> I spent a month in the outback with nothing more than a blanket.<eos> Haven't you heard? They build us tough in Australia.<eos> You never told me why you moved there.<eos> No, I didn't.
... taste your fear.<eos> You're perfect, the one...<eos> It's like some sick and twisted love letter to you.<eos> They don't love you.<eos> Not like I do.
- 21.<eos> So Jessica tells me that you hail from Pittsburgh.<eos> - What part?<eos> - Polish Hill. - Do you know it?<eos> - No, I- - I don't.
I know it.<eos> He arrived just before you did. And he told me what you did.<eos> After he invited you into his home, trusted you to assist his son and daughter, and you flagrantly violated that trust.<eos> Sir, I don't know what he told you, but...<eos> Yes, you do.
Not true.<eos> It's the fabric and the tailoring.<eos> I saved a Balenciaga from my cotillion days.<eos> I'll get it and I'll show you.<eos> Of course she did.
For your 20th, it's meant to be China.<eos> Men should never pick out jewelry alone.<eos> Gus already has something kind of like this.<eos> Wally does, too.<eos> All the guys do.
And Kerouac was looking down this hole.<eos> A fissure.<eos> Yeah, a fissure, I suppose you'd call it, like a narrow, narrow crack in the rock.<eos> D-Do you remember that one in Scotland?<eos> - Yeah, I do. - Yeah.
- Hello, Lena.<eos> Hope you've got your speech prepared. I want to hear nice things about Kate on Saturday.<eos> So, I hear you don't want to go to the Crawley's lunch.<eos> I don't mind if you don't, but I wondered why.<eos> I just don't.
It's cyclical. Come on.<eos> It's like a... A wound just heals just enough, and then we rip the scab off of the fucking thing.<eos> It didn't have to go this way, Marty.<eos> - I mean, I really wanted to...<eos> - No, but it did.
- Hold on.<eos> Jane Finn's hairpin.<eos> Where did you learn that trick?<eos> Girl Guides.<eos> Everyone did.
That's what she was trying to tell us.<eos> She knew we had her book.<eos> Whoever it was that did this had worked it out, too.<eos> Only, they hadn't read my bee book. You didn't, either.<eos> I did, in the end.
But so many lost their lives, you know, and it's easy to see them as just an extension of Joe, but I don't even recognize that name... Sherry.<eos> The more I really think about it, there's only a handful of names that I do remember.<eos> Joe carroll turned those people into killers.<eos> But their lives, their families should still matter.<eos> And they do.
There isn't anything I wouldn't do for you.<eos> We stick together, and we can see it through, 'cause... you've got a friend in me.<eos> Is that the song from Toy Story?<eos> He loves that movie.<eos> I do.
Is this like a solo contract?<eos> Why do you look so surprised?<eos> You deserve it.<eos> Do you know how many artists take years to get to this place?<eos> Some never do.
None whatsoever.<eos> You were good friends with professor Stoddart?<eos> Well, yes-- good friends.<eos> Do you think their deaths are connected in any way?<eos> No, I don't.
You were good friends with professor Stoddart?<eos> Well, yes-- good friends.<eos> Do you think their deaths are connected in any way?<eos> No, I don't.<eos> You don't?
"I'm sorry"?<eos> That's completely unacceptable.<eos> I really like him, Dad!<eos> He does not love you!<eos> Yes, he does!
I still can't believe she hasn't called.<eos> They probably don't have phones in Agloe.<eos> She has a cell.<eos> How do we know that she's even still in Agloe?<eos> I just do.
Will you come with me to Wessex?<eos> No, Earl Ingstad.<eos> Why not?<eos> Don't you want to win renown?<eos> Of course I do.
Don't you want to win renown?<eos> Of course I do.<eos> But someone has to remain and look after all your territories, and all of your interests here.<eos> I believe you trust me to do this.<eos> I do.
I've been headed here, like a freight train.<eos> I couldn't have known then where all this was gonna end up.<eos> I didn't know why he decided to come back.<eos> I didn't know then what he's running from .<eos> None of us did.
No!<eos> Texas.<eos> Please don't! No!<eos> Stop, stop!<eos> Please don't!
Texas.<eos> Please don't! No!<eos> Stop, stop!<eos> Please don't!<eos> Please don't!
Stop, stop!<eos> Please don't!<eos> Please don't!<eos> Ugh! No, no, no!<eos> Please don't, no!
- Anyway, Evita would like to interview you.<eos> Really?<eos> She actually wants to interview somebody from the real world?<eos> Yeah, she knows you're this really important local politician.<eos> - She does?
Really?<eos> She actually wants to interview somebody from the real world?<eos> Yeah, she knows you're this really important local politician.<eos> - She does?<eos> - Well, of course she does.

Joey, your father left 25 years ago!<eos> I'm a sexual being!<eos> Did you really think I went out and played canasta every Friday night?<eos> Yes!<eos> Yes, I did!
And then they stole their land.<eos> Is that, right?<eos> Yeah, so we gave them casinos.<eos> Mrs. Zeldis told you this?<eos> No, John Frye did.
- Uh, actually the guys are gonna give me a lift.<eos> - Come on.<eos> I swear I'm not I'm not skipping.<eos> - You believe him?<eos> - Actually, I kind of do, weird.
- David: Oh my God.<eos> - Stevie: (Whispers) Relax.<eos> Twyla: Can you put yourself down?<eos> Alexis: Oh, okay, who wants a shot?<eos> Because I do.
Just for tonight, because I'm so sad.<eos> Move over, you silly woman.<eos> Hey, dude.<eos> Hey, did you know your uncle knows all about construction?<eos> No, I didn't.
Although, judging by the smell of you, she's been here already.<eos> Oh, it's only a bit of Old Spice.<eos> Got to keep the standards up now.<eos> ~ Did you get the letter, about my lady friend?<eos> ~ Yes, Dad... I did.
The boiler has died from inattention.<eos> I may yet suffer the same fate. PATSY:<eos> Oh, Delia. You don't want to end up in some... filthy hole, living cheek by jowl with a lot of students. FRED:<eos> Did you get the letter about my lady friend?<eos> Yes, Dad, I did.
- He was delighted.<eos> He had no sense of your intention.<eos> He never saw it coming... because he believed me... because I acted like everything was the way it always was.<eos> Because he had never suspected otherwise.<eos> No, he did not.
Boss, he saved us.<eos> He gives our lives meaning.<eos> We have to hold out until the recession is over.<eos> Masaru got a problem.<eos> But so do we all.
I mean, i hear it's coming back in style, anyways.<eos> No, i mean, insane thinking i can get away with this.<eos> Do i really want to trade My dignity, wisdom, and self-respect For another chance at my 20s?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, you do.
What?<eos> Polly Pockets.<eos> So do I!<eos> It's too bad we don't have any here that we could play with.<eos> We do!
I am going to stay at my cousin's in Riverdale.<eos> When she steals her kids' Ritalin, she's really fun.<eos> So I'll see you kids in two days. Good luck.<eos> Ugh! Oh, you're looking at me like I have cooties.<eos> You don't, do you?
We are not gonna let her kill this buzz.<eos> We're gonna go out and celebrate tonight.<eos> Thad and I will take Josh and you out to dinner.<eos> Oh, no, no, you don't have to do that.<eos> Yeah, we do.
I thought somebody abducted you.<eos> Baby, why you always got to make jokes at my expense?<eos> You know I'm sensitive.<eos> 'Cause deep down, I know you like it.<eos> I really don't, though.
Yeah, I am fine.<eos> - Did you get the marmalade?<eos> - Yes, yes. Yes.<eos> Yes.<eos> I did.
- Yes, sir.<eos> - There it is again. That's twice.<eos> Come with me.<eos> Thank you. I owe you one.<eos> Of course you do.
- Okay, go.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Can you find somebody else who did what I did?<eos> - You mean on Labor Day? - I didn't say that.<eos> Yeah, you did.
- Okay, I understand.<eos> I understand.<eos> - No, you don't.<eos> - Yes, I do.<eos> No, you don't, Gary.
Well, I grounded flights, and I diverted federal funds to the wrong state.<eos> I don't remember you pitching that as a possibility, Tom.<eos> Sometimes you have to gamble.<eos> Unfortunately, our horse did not win.<eos> No, it certainly didn't.
- Yeah, I had to let her go.<eos> - Yeah, she went crazy. - Yeah.<eos> - So you don't have a campaign manager?<eos> No, no.<eos> We do, yeah.
(VOICE MAIL) Memo deleted.<eos> I fucking hope not.<eos> Do you solemnly swear the testimony you are about to give is the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?<eos> So help me God.<eos> - Yes. - I do.
So help me God.<eos> - Yes. - I do.<eos> - I do.<eos> - I do.<eos> - Yes, I do.
And then when the nausea passes, give them back to me.<eos> Okay.<eos> Before you go back there, you need to know, he may not look exactly the way you remember him.<eos> I don't want to see the body.<eos> I really don't, actually.
I didn't come.<eos> - That wasn't good for you?<eos> - Oh, Jesus. You know that I loved you so much.<eos> I loved you too.<eos> I still do.
"A," I didn't know you were from coral gables.<eos> And "b," it's not the shelter, man, it's the kids.<eos> Yeah, they're trans children of the corn.<eos> I get it.<eos> No, you don't.
Well, it is Halloween.<eos> What are you playing?<eos> Oh, just something I've already beaten about 15 times, I just haven't gotten the perfect score yet.<eos> Here I am thinking you're shaming me by working on the weekend.<eos> Well, I sort of did some work.
Yeah, yeah.<eos> By the way, your girl...<eos> She's a tough one.<eos> You know, when I fall for someone, I fall hard, and I think I might have scared her.<eos> Yeah, you did...
Not really, but you're totally missing the point.<eos> Of glasses?<eos> So how was your lunch with Tim?<eos> Oh, and by the way, you heard the "oh, no" thing.<eos> - I did.
You thought Gerhart was gonna turn so you sent us away knowing that he would come after us.<eos> You sacrificed us for Krampus to save your selfish old ass!<eos> Oh, please, please, now calm yourself.<eos> You don't know the forces that you are playing with.<eos> Yes I do.
Where's the sibling?<eos> She ate it.<eos> So, the paddock is quite safe, then?<eos> We have the best structural engineers in the world.<eos> Yeah, so did Hammond.
I've been working for two years on an application for those Raptors.<eos> They can hunt and kill that creature.<eos> But your program was to test their intelligence.<eos> Yeah, it was.<eos> And we did.
I'll dose her down to make it last, but if her vitals drop, you're gonna have the mother of all lawsuits on your hands.<eos> I'm gonna have the mother of all divorces on my hands if I don't get out of here soon.<eos> I promised my wife I'd take her to the met tonight, some Christmas Eve art thing.<eos> Just go in the corner.<eos> Not in here, you don't.
- You know. Anal.<eos> - Okay- Firstly, I don't want to know what you think forth base is, all right? But I'm going for the music pages.<eos> Dude, fucking stop.<eos> Don't you give a shit about anyone but yourself?<eos> - No, I don't.
Seeing as how you're in an underground dwarven citadel, it looks as if it has nested hinges, which are...<eos> - Oh...<eos> Brodie!<eos> - Told you they'd be okay.<eos> - No you didn't.
I've read your books.<eos> - Have you?<eos> I think I like the first one best.<eos> I guess everybody did.<eos> Everyone did.
Fiancé. Wow, that is one of those words that sounds strange if you say it a lot.<eos> Or even once.<eos> So, you need help salvaging the meal?<eos> - Oh. - I kid.<eos> Of course you do.
All right.<eos> I'm having so much fun right now.<eos> I never want to go home!<eos> I don't have a home!<eos> Shh! Yes, you do!
Hoping is bullshit.<eos> You see, you have to act.<eos> You can't believe it was moral, what you did.<eos> - You don't think that it was moral?<eos> - Of course I do.
- (SCOFFING)<eos> I won't say anything.<eos> But I...<eos> I believe that you think you did something morally worthwhile.<eos> - I did!
Correct.<eos> If you'll accompany me, we shall further appreciate...<eos> I think the...<eos> I didn't get it at all.<eos> You didn't?
I should have sent them to the country.<eos> Liz wouldn't have let them go.<eos> Anne cried every time you were away.<eos> Did she?<eos> Anne did?
Right about the same time that you moved onto my block.<eos> And we started walking to school together.<eos> Yeah, we did.<eos> We did.<eos> He did good, pigeon.
Well, get onto the store, see what costs £344.<eos> Xbox or iPad.<eos> One-nil to the overgrown schoolboy!<eos> That cash transfer to R Synnott, - how do we know that's Ryan?<eos> - We don't.
Xbox or iPad.<eos> One-nil to the overgrown schoolboy!<eos> That cash transfer to R Synnott, - how do we know that's Ryan?<eos> - We don't.<eos> We don't.
Get me out.<eos> - What is this?<eos> - I just liked the picture.<eos> The colors...<eos> Don't you?
I mean, it wasn't a battle.<eos> I wasn't fighting him and he wasn't controlling me.<eos> I made him stronger, and he made me stronger, and it was better than the best heroin, the best ecstasy, better than any dick I've ever had.<eos> Hazel, I-I don't need to know that...<eos> Yes, you do.
Putting aside my disdain for the injection of witchcraft into a conversation that was previously tethered by logic and reason, no, I don't think that's what's happening here.<eos> Yeah, you're right.<eos> I'm way more upset than she ever was.<eos> Look, even if this knot were to somehow untangle itself, even if he were to jettison her, make a host of sweeping promises to you, hop on a white horse, gallop to your place with a truckload of roses--<eos> - even if he did all that... - Mm-hmm.
Okay, cop, cop, cop, cop, cop.<eos> - What--?<eos> Put a plug in it.<eos> Are you serious?<eos> Sorry. All done here, Officer.
They want to copy it, the president is terrified.<eos> No one in the company knows the formula.<eos> The production is done in a sealed machine and the server is locked in a sort of vault.<eos> How do you get in?<eos> You don't.
We're not equipped for containment.<eos> We expected to observe and take samples.<eos> Well, what if you had the right equipment?<eos> Coast guard won't be back for two weeks, so unless you have a helicopter hidden somewhere...<eos> No, we don't.
- We need to get out of here.<eos> - Not until I get my bag back, and Mother.<eos> How are you gonna do that?<eos> You have no idea where Alan is.<eos> I do now.
I'm still listening to their phone conversations, and it's not a shipment of drugs.<eos> They're carrying three million dollars to Bogotá, and if two guys from the DEA stop that car,<eos> Pablo is going to hang you by the balls.<eos> - You don't have 65, Poi.<eos> - Yes, I do.
Signed, "Death to Kidnappers."<eos> Please!<eos> Please, let me go.<eos> - Hurry up!<eos> - Please, don't!
Connie and I took advantage and began adoption proceedings.<eos> The war had left many orphans.<eos> One... we could do something about.<eos> Oh, you like the pink ones, don't you?<eos> Yeah, you do.
There's no difference between boarders and skiers.<eos> We're all just people with wood strapped to our feet, sliding down a mountain.<eos> I have a dream that one day we will not be judged by the size of our board, but by what we do in the pow-pow.<eos> Because the snow doesn't care who we are.<eos> It does not.
They are not my bosses, Val.<eos> Hey. "Val"? Can't you call me "Mom"?<eos> - I can.<eos> - Much obliged.<eos> Done.
- Yeah.<eos> I just want to sit here till it's over.<eos> I've listened to this about 500 times, and every time, it's like it's so slow,<eos> I feel like it could stop.<eos> But it doesn't.
- Connie.<eos> - Not even his own kid.<eos> This thing we've been doing, please, I'm so sorry if I've been leading you on, but it's got to stop.<eos> Do you understand?<eos> Do you?
- What?<eos> - Stop. Let it go.<eos> Five-year-olds get slapped all the time, and they heal.<eos> - They do not.<eos> - They do.
But I should.<eos> I really should.<eos> You're the most beautiful man I ever met, but...<eos> I just don't want this.<eos> I don't.
What, to have a kid?<eos> Well, it's only gonna get harder, but no. No, it's not your last chance.<eos> Well, listen to me.<eos> I don't know how to be a mom.<eos> Anouk, nobody does.
- We're leaving.<eos> - Sam, we have to go.<eos> Uh, yeah!<eos> - How do we know Alice isn't here?<eos> - We don't.
I could use a précis.<eos> - "Précis"...?<eos> - It means 'recap'.<eos> I know what it means.<eos> Since when does Sam?
I'm not getting anything.<eos> You wouldn't do anything stupid, would you?<eos> Based on recent experience?<eos> I know how badly you want to get Andy back.<eos> We all do.
Everything you do will fall short to what I've built up in my head.<eos> Well, maybe it would be easier if you didn't ask for presents that were impossible to get.<eos> I've seen a baby tiger.<eos> I know they exist.<eos> They do.
Gone from here.<eos> You are quite the fighter.<eos> You haven't even begun to see me fight!<eos> You don't have any control over your body.<eos> I do.
We killed you.<eos> With your help, I'll get what I need.<eos> A great woman taught me this spell.<eos> You don't have any control over your body.<eos> I do.
She might adopt him.<eos> She phoned this morning, you were snoring.<eos> It's good to have more options.<eos> Since the Russian doesn't want him.<eos> - He doesn't?
Got to be strong now, Chloe.<eos> Nice and strong for your dad.<eos> Please don't.<eos> Please don't hurt me.<eos> Please, please don't.
It's nice, eh?<eos> What?<eos> I wanted to show you how it fits.<eos> - You like it?<eos> - Do you?
Hot. Good.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I would have mailed you your cup, but I didn't know where you were.<eos> Well, you knew I'd be back.<eos> No, I didn't.
Go on, get it down you.<eos> We're gonna meet Mr. Korsky and his boat.<eos> The one who didn't come last time?<eos> It was a misunderstanding.<eos> What if he does it again?
- No.<eos> - Good, that's good.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> She says she doesn't have a relationship with sheriff Andersson.<eos> (Eric) So she doesn't.
You saw them at it?<eos> Your mother and these men.<eos> Did you like watching?<eos> No.<eos> You did.
At the very least.<eos> I'm sorry, this is a fascinating narrative... but I don't see it's much help to us.<eos> It's the hidden language of the demon.<eos> It must have a purpose.<eos> Not everything does.
This is but one evening.<eos> Mr. Gray is being a proper host to a new guest, that's all.<eos> You're smarter than that, Miss Ives.<eos> I wanted her to have life.<eos> Now she does.
I've never loved anyone else.<eos> Never.<eos> You think you can come in here when I'm all disoriented and say the things I wanted you to say to me two years ago and make me run away with you?<eos> I said it to you 10 years ago and I'll say it again.<eos> I do.
"All these kind words.<eos> "They've made up for what has been a truly rubbish day, so thank you,<eos> "and there's to be an election to take my place.<eos> "Now, come on, Pagford, "did you think I wouldn't have something to say about this?<eos> "Of course I do.
Up!<eos> You can do one exam. Ah...<eos> Maths.<eos> Tell them you want to sit maths.<eos> But I don't.
"Leslie Knope is an absurd idealist whose political leanings are slightly to the left of Leon Trotsky."<eos> So far, so accurate.<eos> "If we were to work together, she would undoubtedly drive me insane, and it is possible that we would murder each other."<eos> You forgot the last sentence.<eos> No, I didn't.
Are you trying to have it all?<eos> That question makes no sense.<eos> It's a stupid question. Stop asking it.<eos> Don't ask it. Do you miss your kids while you're at work?<eos> Yes, of course I do.
It's not easy.<eos> I have a few tricks up my sleeve.<eos> Like if someone's droning on about their stupid life, I just pretend something really horrible will happen to my child if I don't listen.<eos> That's not gonna work for you 'cause you don't have a child.<eos> - Yes, I do.
I just wanted on that yacht party so bad.<eos> Oh, the one where Suge Knight pushed your friend overboard?<eos> No, that was a different one.<eos> Hey, dad.<eos> How you doing?
She's safe.<eos> It'll take 100 witches to break the cloaking spell.<eos> I would've said the same about mother finding you, and yet a flock of starlings later, and here we are.<eos> He won't let them get to her, Nik, but you need to remain calm.<eos> Our brother doesn't do calm.
Do you want to know yours?<eos> It's Handel. It's lovely.<eos> Tonight, I'll make up a dream for you.<eos> Do you know when you'll die?<eos> I don't.
Plus, she's already done, what, two years?<eos> Yo, it's all good.<eos> It's all good.<eos> I actually thought he loved me.<eos> And he probably did, Daya.
Waited for three hours to get hugged. But then Seamus said he felt sick.<eos> Said it was from the sun and the chia pudding, but I'm pretty sure he just got impatient.<eos> I could have used that hug.<eos> I don't know why I didn't stay.<eos> Yes, I do.
He has a right to have a relationship with her.<eos> You're leaving me for Hank.<eos> He's doing really well for himself.<eos> They made a big chunk of change on that Warner's deal. - He has ambition.<eos> - And I don't?
There's no nuance.<eos> Well, sure.<eos> You should know. I mean... you do know what a vagina smells like.<eos> Right, sweetie?<eos> Obviously, I do.
That's fantastic.<eos> You think so?<eos> I mean, I hoped you'd think so. I just wasn't sure.<eos> I do.<eos> I really do.
Oh, who is that?<eos> Bonnie. Ah. She stay in town or she go visit her family?<eos> Nah, her family's messed up.<eos> What do you care?<eos> I don't.
Don't -- don't do this. I swear I'll do anything you want.<eos> Just don't -- don't do this.<eos> I love you. I want to marry you, and you want to marry me.<eos> No.<eos> No, I don't...
Oh, God.<eos> I have a lot of FSU law friends who did.<eos> - Yeah? - Yeah.<eos> Miami, D.C., Houston.<eos> I did my third year summer in Dallas.
- Hi.<eos> Yes.<eos> - It's about work.<eos> - Oh, the project's dead. - I thought Susannah talked to you.<eos> - She did.
- Good. Thank you.<eos> - Because I already said yes.<eos> - Oh. Now, come on, quick.<eos> Fuck-me-in-the-buttime before someone else rings that fucking bell.<eos> - So, you guys doing all right?
That's just so not what I want.<eos> - Good. We want the same thing.<eos> - Exactly.<eos> And you asked me if Jon knew about all the... the little things.<eos> Well, he didn't.
When Jake and Milo came by earlier, did they give you the skinny on the sex party?<eos> Is that why you wanted to go down there? Can you put little Ted down, please?<eos> He's very fragile.<eos> He's already lost an eye.<eos> No, they didn't.
And if it works out, then you have to be the first person at that window on opening day.<eos> But you need to start thinking about someone else first instead of me.<eos> He's a great fucking guy.<eos> And I really liked seeing you come out of his door with a big wreath on it.<eos> I kind of did too.
It's so violent.<eos> Life is violent.<eos> It is.<eos> I didn't think so before.<eos> But you do now.
Thank you.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> If this feels that good when we're not really here, what's it gonna be like when we are?<eos> You came back.<eos> Yes... I did.
Because i had a vision of you as a zombie, Chasing a man through an alley.<eos> You were about to rip open his skull.<eos> He was killed in a dui accident, wound up here. I ate his brain.<eos> Until the vision, i thought i was the only one.<eos> Yeah, until, like, three seconds ago, so did i.
I'm sure this whole experience has soured you on us, but... you know, and just because Power 4 Life wasn't the right fit for you in helping you achieve your goals doesn't mean you should use that as an excuse to, you know,<eos> Hey, you know, I've been watching your videos on YouTube.<eos> Yeah.<eos> And you make it seem like you believe all this shit, you know.<eos> Of course, I do.
- Has there been an incident? - No.<eos> We're here on an historic inquiry.<eos> Do you remember finding a credit card belonging to REC Imports?<eos> You'd have been, what, 16?<eos> I do, indeed.
Abigail, my flame-haired beauty.<eos> A little early for the tavern, isn't it?<eos> Actually, I find that alcohol shortens the day considerably.<eos> You Adams men think you're so charming, don't you?<eos> Indeed, we do.
I'm doing what we set out to do.<eos> No, you're not.<eos> You want to keep making money, don't you?<eos> You want to keep living that privileged life of yours.<eos> Yes, of course I do.
- Please, my Lady, if I can explain...<eos> - I saw you at Joffrey's wedding... bowing to the king.<eos> Neither of us wanted to be there.<eos> - Sometimes we don't have a choice.<eos> - And sometimes we do.
It was the end of my whole high school era.<eos> I wanted to be there, and whatever guilt or mixed up emotions I had about Matty shouldn't have been keeping me away.<eos> - [murmuring] - [giggling] Hey, T, we gotta get back to school for the prank.<eos> What?<eos> No, we don't.
We are not... Executing anyone.<eos> Don't ever suggest it again.<eos> That sort of thinking doesn't belong in here.<eos> People die now, deanna.<eos> They do.
I'm sick of playing defense.<eos> So you're just gonna take on all of them?<eos> Yeah.<eos> We've got to get out of here.<eos> You do, i don't.
I sent them away.<eos> I don't need them. I need you.<eos> Something terrible has happened to your cousin Roger.<eos> Dad, you're... You're confused. I don't have a cousin Roger.<eos> Woman: Oh, yes, you do.
What do you mean "danger"?<eos> Jimmy, why would you say that?<eos> What?<eos> You said the family might be in danger.<eos> I did? I...
I don't wanna press charges.<eos> We talked about this.<eos> You want to press charges.<eos> No.<eos> No, I don't.
I knew it!<eos> Finally, someone believes me!<eos> Why do you believe me?<eos> I heard the details. Your story makes sense.<eos> Of course it does!
- No one you know.<eos> - Debs, I'm not gonna be here tonight.<eos> - So?<eos> I don't need a chaperone.<eos> - Yes, you do.
- Ben Barnes is hardly Deep Throat.<eos> - He's confessed to abusing his power... to keep some of the richest, privileged sons of Texas... from getting their asses blown off in Vietnam.<eos> Ms. Mapes. Don't you think it's possible, just possible... that some of those fine, young... "privileged men, as you call them... got into the National Guard on their own merit?<eos> No, sir.<eos> No, I do not.
But he seems pretty harmless.<eos> Corey something. I don't know his last name.<eos> Does he know your last name?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, he does.
Yeah...<eos> belongs to Boz Shepherd.<eos> Did you happen to see who was driving it today?<eos> You want me to say it was Boz.<eos> And what if I did?
Yeah, we've got him at the crime scene.<eos> An eyewitness I.D.'d him about an hour ago.<eos> Which means either our witness is lying or you may have been confused about this morning.<eos> Someone saw him at the baseball field?<eos> Yes, they did.
How's he doing?<eos> Doctor said he's gonna be all right.<eos> You really love him?<eos> He's an idiot most of the time, but... yeah.<eos> I do.
We could have put that guy away, but now... now he's back out there.<eos> Because he didn't do it.<eos> You know, I thought we had each other's back.<eos> Yeah, same team for the first time.<eos> I did.
You know the girl.<eos> She's probably working on one of her lists.<eos> She wants everything to be perfect before she walks through the door.<eos> Yeah, you think?<eos> Yeah, I do.
Mr. Tucker says you didn't have the best routine and that you've been acting silly and eating bad snacks.<eos> - That doesn't sound like you.<eos> - I just had a little taste.<eos> Mr. Tucker thinks that Maggie would be better off training with him.<eos> - I do.
Give her to them?<eos> For Kira.<eos> That is not your bloody decision, S, is it? !<eos> Does DYAD know about this?<eos> Did Cal?
I mean, I've caused you nothing but problems since I got here, so I get it.<eos> Pretty much.<eos> Fuck.<eos> - Why do you even care?<eos> - I just do.
But I think it would be comforting.<eos> Buddy... No, it's okay.<eos> What?<eos> When I lost my own father, I didn't have any friends to help me through it.<eos> You do.
I care!<eos> Oh, wait, no, I don't.<eos> Good luck, Raj.<eos> You know, I thought our friendship meant more to you.<eos> So did I.
You're gonna be on Skype; they're not gonna see your legs.<eos> Well, I'm gonna go put on some pants just in case.<eos> But I have to say, this is very freeing.<eos> Add a belt and I'll take you someplace nice.<eos> Done and done.
Okay, I don't know when I became the mother to three lazy teenagers, but it stops today.<eos> You guys are cleaning the kitchen, top to bottom.<eos> Hey, I don't even live here.<eos> Yes or no, do you have clothes in my laundry right now?<eos> I do.
We need to talk.<eos> You call the cops?<eos> What?<eos> Philadelphia P.D. Did you call them?<eos> - Y... yeah, I did.
Do you like to sail?<eos> - I love to sail.<eos> - I do, too.<eos> I think we're going to be very happy, you and I.<eos> I do, too.
Stop running.<eos> There's no justice in the world. Not unless we make it.<eos> You loved your family. Avenge them.<eos> How do we get through there?<eos> We don't.
In something greater than ourselves, I mean.<eos> The gods, destiny.<eos> Do you believe there's a plan for this world?<eos> No.<eos> Neither did I.
I don't fight for the crows.<eos> We're not here to fight.<eos> We're here to talk.<eos> Is that right?<eos> You and the pretty crow do a lot of talking, Tormund?
I'm lickin' the walls.<eos> He looks nice, though, he looks really nice.<eos> Hashtag, get naked!<eos> Yeah, no-one says ' "hashtag'" out loud, not any more.<eos> They do. My friends do.
They expect it!<eos> This isn't about you, Freddie,<eos> I just think I think men like fucking women from behind so they don't have to look at our faces.<eos> Seriously?<eos> I do.
But I think there's a chance.<eos> Are... Are you actually going out?<eos> We're sort of... circling.<eos> But he wants more, I think.<eos> I do.
What for?<eos> You know.<eos> We had all that time, and...<eos> - We had brilliant times.<eos> - Yeah, we did.
Funny thing is... that's what drove him away in the end.<eos> How d'you mean?<eos> Long story.<eos> But I liked him.<eos> I really did.
- Yes, all good, thanks. Hello.<eos> - How's the project?<eos> What was that?<eos> You had to do a project, you worked late, you had to get it finished by the weekend?<eos> Oh, the schedule, I did it, yes!
Tony, were you working on the car, or were you out riding around in it?<eos> Tony was telling us that it's just you at home. - Is that right? - Yes.<eos> My wife and I, we recently separated, so I know how hard it is...<eos> No, no, it's, uh, different.<eos> We didn't...
Let me tell you where we are.<eos> We've got a witness who can put a car on the scene of a homicide, and we've got somebody who can put you in that car.<eos> We've got credit card and I.D. belonging to the vic in your possession.<eos> - I didn't kill nobody.<eos> - Who did?
We've got credit card and I.D. belonging to the vic in your possession.<eos> - I didn't kill nobody.<eos> - Who did?<eos> Why they got to shoot me?<eos> Who did?
D-did... did he... Did he deal drugs?<eos> - What? - Did... I mean, 'cause...<eos> No, but they're saying things about Matt. They're saying things about him, and I need to know.<eos> He had some grass around.<eos> Everybody does.
Come on in.<eos> Hey, Callie? Robert's here.<eos> You have a beautiful home.<eos> We like it.<eos> So does Callie.
- Hi, Gracie.<eos> - Do you know where Carson's class is?<eos> Urn... they might be in room 4.<eos> Okay, let's go to room 4.<eos> How you doing, Pal?
These carvings, I recognize them from the Tales of Atlantis I read as a girl.<eos> It sunk into the ocean, but its people were saved by the magic of the King's trident which turned them irreversibly into creatures of the sea.<eos> That's a fairy tale.<eos> I believe you.<eos> Well, of course he does.
- "Show me."<eos> So just give me the answer, and then I'll say sh...<eos> You know what, go ahead and do it.<eos> Just go ahead and do it, then.<eos> - Do what?
All he needed was an introduction to Lobos.<eos> Oh, shit.<eos> He asked to come to the Lobos meet.<eos> He wanted me to take him.<eos> Of course he did.
He's moving crates from one place to...<eos> Will you just listen to me? All right?<eos> Excuse me, sir, uh, do you work here? - Yeah.<eos> - Please, don't stop your work.<eos> They never do on TV.
- Oh.<eos> - No.<eos> - Has he not said it?<eos> - Because I'm telling you, he just...<eos> - He does. No.
We researched how to disappear.<eos> The library kind of became a command center.<eos> But how did you get birth certificates? I called people and said i was government, Told them there was a fire,<eos> In order for us to re-register them and... Most people didn't. But...<eos> Some people did.
Come on. [ sighs ]<eos> I need your bag.<eos> [ sighs deeply ] So... Where you living these days?<eos> [ chuckles ] you actually care?<eos> Yeah, i actually do.
I know.<eos> I was in court.<eos> What are -- is everything okay?<eos> Nick, how did you know that this was my car?<eos> I didn't.
Taking a train to vancouver?<eos> I'm not taking the train. Look, i only told you about the offer to give you an out.<eos> Giving me an out.<eos> I don't want an out.<eos> I never did, okay?
Yeah, I know.<eos> It's a miracle that you survived us.<eos> You must be some superhuman kid.<eos> You know how much your mom and I love you.<eos> Yeah, I do.
Hey. Nice ruffles.<eos> Yeah, the things we do for love.<eos> Yep! The things we do.<eos> So how'd it go last night?<eos> Well, it didn't.
Oh, and I broke up with Davis 'cause I still love you.<eos> Good night.<eos> George, do you think what we had, that we'll... find it with other people?<eos> No.<eos> No, I don't.
- Do you have news about our case?<eos> - I do, in fact.<eos> But before we get to the nitty-gritty, I think we should chat about your deal.<eos> We told you, there will be no deal.<eos> You did, didn't you?
Sovereignty is absolute power and authority.<eos> Exactly.<eos> Which is who I am-- your king.<eos> It's America, brother.<eos> We don't do kings.
Exactly.<eos> Which is who I am-- your king.<eos> It's America, brother.<eos> We don't do kings.<eos> Oh, we do.
- You are OK.<eos> Please don't do this.<eos> Please.<eos> Please don't.<eos> Please don't.
I didn't tell you that I went down to the station earlier 'cause I didn't want you to worry.<eos> Little late for that.<eos> Why does she keep wanting to talk to you?<eos> I mean, she can't seriously think...<eos> She does.
Woah fucked!<eos> Bring it down!<eos> Come on!<eos> Hold on!<eos> Hey, how you doing?
Her final words, what were they?<eos> She said that you would come for me.<eos> There would be nowhere I could hide.<eos> She didn't deserve to die.<eos> No, she didn't.
- That happens all the time.<eos> - Not this time.<eos> How do you know?<eos> Clearly, I have a source that knows more than you.<eos> Most sources do.
Two Chivas, neat.<eos> Cubans.<eos> Smuggled in.<eos> I thought you might appreciate the irony.<eos> I do.
Don't forget, she has a national profile after the Walker investigation.<eos> Truth and justice personified.<eos> If the leadership wants to redefine the party, she's--<eos> No one with this little experience has ever been a real contender since Ross Perot, and at least he had the money.<eos> So does she.
I've never had anything but his best interests at heart.<eos> You don't care about Robert.<eos> You wanted to sideline me.<eos> So you actually think you have a shot at this office?<eos> Yes, I do.
I love this place.<eos> I love, like, old, Italian-y places.<eos> If you, uh, go in the bathroom, there's a gun behind the toilet.<eos> (opera playing in background) Do you wanna have a sleepover tonight?<eos> Yeah, I really do.
I don't know.<eos> But I do know that if we move in together, nobody is gonna love anybody anymore, guaranteed.<eos> You know this.<eos> Don't you know this?<eos> Yeah, I do and...
He'll give up and that's the end of it and most of the time you don't even have to do that, but sometimes you get in their face hard, you know?<eos> Hard, fast.<eos> I never give a shit if they're winning or losing, we're going to a Knicks game, world's most famous arena, it's gonna be cool.<eos> Yeah.<eos> How you doing, pal.
Okay, can we just...?<eos> Okay.<eos> Hey, wait a minute, what is that?<eos> No, no, no, you need this.<eos> No, I don't.
Why did you come here?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I really don't.
How'd it go?<eos> Kid's a dream.<eos> She's easy.<eos> And you better stay that way.<eos> How you doing, sweetie, huh?
That argument you won today against the restraining order... the judge was never gonna grant that.<eos> Schweikart is throwing softballs. And he's gonna keep on throwing them over and over.<eos> We'll be busy swatting them away, we'll never spend time on the actual case.<eos> This case will span years. And we don't have the capital to carry it forward by ourselves.<eos> We simply don't.
But we keep it in our back pocket.<eos> Michael Corrigan?<eos> They're going to release him when we visit.<eos> You made a miracle happen.<eos> We did.
God!<eos> What's going on?<eos> How you doing, hmm?<eos> How's it going?<eos> How you doing?
- Well, you're getting an abortion tomorrow.<eos> - No.<eos> - Yes.<eos> - I love him.<eos> - You don't.
Sorry, guys.<eos> And... ¶ oh... ¶<eos> Oh, my god, sam, you hear it, too?<eos> Yeah, is it like a high-pitched ringing But only in your left ear?<eos> Because yes, i do, all the time.
We... we can't do that.<eos> 'Cause we're Ruke or Layna or whatever the hell we are.<eos> And no offense, but I respect your right to call off the wedding.<eos> The least you could do is respect my right to be extremely pissed off about it.<eos> I do. I do.
Layla took full responsibility for her actions.<eos> No charges are being filed.<eos> She didn't say where she got the pills?<eos> Says she brought them from home.<eos> She did?
So is that... is that really what you wanna do?<eos> Sing professionally?<eos> Yeah, it is.<eos> Because I know what your mom thinks about it.<eos> Yeah, the same thing all of you do.
It's love.<eos> Don't you get that?<eos> This is how it has to be. I made up my mind.<eos> Well, you don't get to just make up your mind...<eos> I do...
This is how it has to be. I made up my mind.<eos> Well, you don't get to just make up your mind...<eos> I do...<eos> I do, Rayna.<eos> I do.
Caleb!<eos> - [Laughs]<eos> - Hey. Why didn't you call?<eos> I wanted to surprise you.<eos> Well, y... you did.
Hey, after that interview, I'm happy to let the music do the talking.<eos> I gotta say, I'm still really disappointed about that Jade St. John concert.<eos> I wish we could go...<eos> Mom, I told you, I already had plans.<eos> Yes, you did.
See you at the office.<eos> You with.<eos> Disrupts this you?<eos> That our guy just jumps out the window.<eos> - Yes it does.
There are flowers there. The lilies.<eos> She is at the boathouse.<eos> There are flowers there.<eos> You promised to help me.<eos> I did not actually.
A partnership track.<eos> Done.<eos> And one more thing.<eos> Bring it in.<eos> Not done.
Okay.<eos> That's real nice.<eos> You got the smiley one.<eos> Well, did somebody say, "drinks on Brody"?<eos> I did.
Don't make plans for me.<eos> All right.<eos> I have a lot of work.<eos> Look, I know I told you not to complain, but that doesn't mean I don't want to hear about it.<eos> But you really don't.
- Oh, please.<eos> - Lyla...<eos> Talk about why you two hate each other exactly.<eos> I don't--we don't hate each other.<eos> - We don't.
Let me think...<eos> What was it?<eos> That's it.<eos> A palm house. You built a ballroom.<eos> Mr. Tom Gerrard did anyway.
Our architect's Mr. Gerrard.<eos> Well, that's what I remembered.<eos> Well, it's a simple mistake to make.<eos> And surely, he corrected you when you addressed him?<eos> Oh, I didn't.
Founding father Eustace Ballard laid the first brick of foundation himself.<eos> I can show you a plaque carved in wood from Mr. Ballard's outhouse.<eos> Okay.<eos> Did I mention Ballard was also a minister?<eos> Yeah, you did.
Depends on what?<eos> Chunky chocolate, Taffy bits, marshmallows?<eos> You... you don't know if you like that stuff?<eos> - I know I do.<eos> - Course you do.
Repeat.<eos> Word of advice:<eos> Sometimes it can take centuries to figure it out.<eos> When did people stop hurting you?<eos> They didn't.
Then why gamble with your daughter's life?<eos> - Because I had no choice!<eos> - More games.<eos> I had no choice because I do not have the cipher.<eos> Samara does.
I hope you're wrong.<eos> We can't reject the truth when it is revealed.<eos> He's insisting that we move him somewhere safer.<eos> He knows where I am.<eos> Who does?
Why?<eos> No, we need paramedics.<eos> No.<eos> Parents, we should call the parents, actually.<eos> - Okay, did they--
Hello?<eos> Oh, my goodness, you gave me a fright!<eos> Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to.<eos> Didn't you hear me calling?<eos> No, I didn't.
Is that why you've done it all in the first place?<eos> - Was that your game?<eos> - Hey, this isn't a game.<eos> I got feelings for you, Harry. As much as just said so as did you about me.<eos> I certainly didn't.
No.<eos> I can't.<eos> My father... tended to Secretary of State Seward on the night Lincoln was shot.<eos> Did you know he was attacked, too?<eos> I didn't.
You're a man now.<eos> And you'll need to be as I have good reason for having you here for a talk.<eos> You do?<eos> You noticed your mother struggling at dinner.<eos> Yes, I did.
So what are you going to do?<eos> I will talk to the teachers and remind the students about our zero tolerance...<eos> Why should you talk to all of the students?<eos> - We don't know who it was.<eos> - Yeah, we do.
He said he did.<eos> I can't stall the adoption process forever, so...<eos> You like them?<eos> Babies?<eos> Yeah. Doesn't everyone?
Take a look.<eos> Oh, Robert, come on. Shoo!<eos> You're not allowed to see.<eos> They don't want me here.<eos> Of course they do!
I understand.<eos> Listen, Danny... you either run, or you talk to the feds and face the music.<eos> See you back at the house.<eos> Did he say where he was?<eos> No, he didn't.
I'm sorry to hear that.<eos> I heard you were involved.<eos> Jim'd blame me for the weather if he could get away with it.<eos> When I met your daughter I didn't really understand why she was so afraid of you.<eos> Now I do.
Ships scraping hulls in the night.<eos> But why would you do that?<eos> Same reason you did, I suppose.<eos> Did he tell you?<eos> No, his wife did.
Shall we go inside?<eos> No. We can not go in.<eos> -Broren is at work.<eos> -It does not matter.<eos> Yes, it does something.
I can't believe Nina's just a body now.<eos> It kind of always was just a body, but top-shelf all the way.<eos> - Hey, man, have some respect.<eos> - I have extreme respect.<eos> And so did most of the basketball team.
Yeah. ~ Amazing.<eos> This is Frank.<eos> I'm Becky.<eos> It's just me and the wife can't work out how we know you.<eos> Well, you don't, actually.
Well, you convinced him to look into my case when he didn't want to, didn't you?<eos> This is different. We don't take cases like this.<eos> Maybe, but I believe a man who can convince Harvey to hire someone who never went to law school could convince him to make an exception for this.<eos> What?<eos> No, he didn't.
I'm glad.<eos> What's on your mind, Jessica? You don't seem--<eos> I know you told Scottie about Mike Ross.<eos> How'd you know?<eos> I didn't till just now.
If we push him now, Shane's toy solicitor is only going to scream undue pressure.<eos> Let's wait and see.<eos> And if Kieran wakes up, there's your witness.<eos> What if he doesn't?<eos> What if he doesn't?
The people move so fast, it's scary, I can't go back out there.<eos> Just take a moment, OK?<eos> Do you want to stop?<eos> No.<eos> No, I don't.
You want to knock years off your jail sentence, then, Gazelle, I'm begging you, talk to me.<eos> There's just one last question, which people will ask behind your back, so allow me to say it to your face.<eos> Did you know?<eos> Come on, you must have known.<eos> Course you did.
The way to his heart is through tenderness and love.<eos> Way to his heart?<eos> I am King!<eos> I don't need to woo my blood!<eos> Yes, you do.
Take him the ring! He'll know if what I say is true.<eos> Who is your mother?<eos> Aethra from Troezen.<eos> How do you know my mother, Medea?<eos> I don't.
How do we know it's not a trap?<eos> For heaven's sake, of course it's a trap.<eos> The question to ask is whether we can turn Lykos's trap to our advantage.<eos> How do we know the message is even from Prince Lykos?<eos> We don't.
But perhaps they misjudge him.<eos> So, what do I hear of his latest venture?<eos> The venture is small, so overheads will be low.<eos> Without Reath, supply to the markets will fall, so the price of copper should rise.<eos> And if it doesn't?
- Hi, Erika.<eos> How are you?<eos> Nice to meet you.<eos> Evie, Michael, introduce yourselves.<eos> - How you doing?
I know you were in the Swat Valley.<eos> The same place that those Special Ops soldiers delivered 10 million in cash to a warlord named Massoud.<eos> I know that you robbed them and I know that you executed them.<eos> ETHAN: And you think I'm capable of that?<eos> Yeah. Actually, I do.
That is a fantastic idea, 'cause the whole place has just been falling apart since you been gone.<eos> In fact, you should probably head over there right now.<eos> There could be a fire.<eos> - I mean, who knows?<eos> You don't. - All right. Well, well, well.
Listen to your new song, Greta.<eos> Feel it in your heart.<eos> Feel it in your body.<eos> - I don't want this.<eos> - Yes, you do.
Feel it in your heart.<eos> Feel it in your body.<eos> - I don't want this.<eos> - Yes, you do.<eos> You do.
I didn't talk to him.<eos> Dave, I can get your phone records.<eos> I can see who called here and for how long. I thought you said you weren't a cop, right...<eos> Did he say where he was going?<eos> - Mr. Hodiak, I don't...
- Germans are not so uptight about nudity.<eos> - Mm. This is not about nudity, OK?<eos> This is... This is about decency. It is about privacy.<eos> If you were so concerned with privacy and decency, why did you look?<eos> I did not.
- Mm. This is not about nudity, OK?<eos> This is... This is about decency. It is about privacy.<eos> If you were so concerned with privacy and decency, why did you look?<eos> I did not.<eos> Yes, you did.
I need a doctor in here!<eos> I need help.<eos> I need a doctor in here!<eos> I need a doctor in here!<eos> - Do something!
I need help.<eos> I need a doctor in here!<eos> I need a doctor in here!<eos> - Do something!<eos> - Sir! Do something!
And what's going on?<eos> People working for their homes, for their neighborhoods.<eos> They want to keep what they have.<eos> And you really think that building a couple hundred units of public housing is gonna wreck those neighborhoods? (SCOFFING)<eos> Yeah, I do.
- It has been a real honor to serve six terms.<eos> - Oy vey.<eos> Thank you so much.<eos> You gave it one last run, Angelo.<eos> - I did, didn't I?
That's his business.<eos> This isn't.<eos> Did they find George's car?<eos> No.<eos> No, they didn't.
Your code is Amantha's birthday.<eos> I don't think anyone here knows who Amantha is, Mother.<eos> You remember?<eos> 08-11.<eos> You do.
And... your life... Is mine.<eos> I'll go. Oh.<eos> You should tell your mother that Hakeem is performing at Laviticus.<eos> She'll try to sabotage it.<eos> Already did.
You're a big... muscle-y distraction, and we need that right now.<eos> Look, our warrant is for Constance, remember?<eos> And when it comes down to it, she's the one we need to save.<eos> How do you think the others will react when they figure that bit out?<eos> No idea. Neither do you.
So your profile says you're into gardening.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, it's just something I used to do with my mom.<eos> I should probably know what these are, but I have no clue.<eos> I definitely don't.
-Good.<eos> Yeah. How are you?<eos> Good. I'm good.<eos> I'm gay now. In case my mom didn't tell everybody.<eos> She did.
-Yeah?<eos> -I did that.<eos> Happens to everybody.<eos> Right?<eos> Does it?
Did you know Tom was yours?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Um, I have no business asking that question.<eos> It's okay.<eos> I didn't...
What?<eos> Why?<eos> He told you who I am?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, he did.
Enough!<eos> I'm ready to talk, but only to your captain.<eos> I'm ready to talk.<eos> Let him go.<eos> Amos. Do it.
They were calling to see if anything was missing.<eos> And since they had to ask, it means that they didn't give it to anyone.<eos> Which means that Mars isn't working with the OPA or trying to take control of Ceres.<eos> They didn't destroy the Canterbury.<eos> Then who did?
Yeah, for himself.<eos> LOPEZ: The only thing I see here is an incoming ship.<eos> One you can't even identify.<eos> How do you know they're coming for Naomi?<eos> We don't.
They told me he knew exactly how to cut me.<eos> They said it was surgical.<eos> He wanted us to live.<eos> He left us to die.<eos> But we didn't.
I knew.<eos> It was the best moment of my life, a moment of epiphany... that made me famous... and then ruined me.<eos> In haste and the heat of ambition, the Questura nearly destroyed the young man's home... trying to find evidence.<eos> - He doesn't leave evidence.<eos> - No, he doesn't.
I do feel closer to Hannibal here.<eos> God only knows where I'd be without him.<eos> He left us his, uh... his broken heart.<eos> How did he know we were here?<eos> He didn't.
He knew exactly how to cut you.<eos> They said it was surgical.<eos> He wanted you to live.<eos> He left us to die.<eos> But we didn't.
What Burt and Carole were talking about earlier, and these last few months without you have been really...<eos> I love you, Kurt.<eos> I mean, I love you, I-I do, I...<eos> This is crazy, this is crazy.<eos> And I don't...
Like I said, he's up in Sleepy Eye.<eos> Take a look at that grinder, will ya?<eos> It's making a funny noise.<eos> Jeez, hon. Where's your coat?<eos> Hon, did...
- Amazing.<eos> - Oh. Yeah, and I just, you know, I want to be the best me I can be, ya know?<eos> Constance:<eos> Good for you. What did ed say when you asked him?<eos> You didn't, did you?
Uh... sure.<eos> And also, do you mind telling me what the hell you're doing in Houston?<eos> It doesn't matter now. No, I think it does matter.<eos> I just drove 14 hours to get here.<eos> No, it doesn't, okay?
Three years ago?<eos> And since then?<eos> We are in love.<eos> Yes, but when do you see each other?<eos> We don't.
What else is new?<eos> Kol told me that you guys were working on a weapon to use against him.<eos> Rebekah heard that it was a dagger, one that would work even on Klaus.<eos> I need to know if you finished it.<eos> - And what if we did?
What are you doing here?<eos> Ha ha! Well, I mean, that's a loaded question for me, but you seem to be exactly where you supposed to be.<eos> Are you sure you can do this on your own?<eos> Don't remember asking for help.<eos> No. You didn't.
Just hear me out.<eos> You told me that we were in danger.<eos> You even told me who was after us.<eos> But what you didn't tell me is why.<eos> Yes, I did.
A really big favor.<eos> Last time you asked me for a big favor, I had to loan you my helicopter.<eos> Don't need your helicopter.<eos> I need your jet.<eos> Well, Oliver does, but both of us.
How could you stand by his side?<eos> Because of the threat of the League.<eos> We have to work with him.<eos> I don't have a choice.<eos> Yes, you do.
That's why I love him.<eos> I didn't know... about you and my brother.<eos> Yeah, well... It was complicated.<eos> But I did love him.<eos> Despite everything, I still do.
Happy birthday.<eos> - Making today a happy day and no feeling blue.<eos> - I love you baby!<eos> For everything you are to us, and all that you do.<eos> I do.
That is my impossible request.<eos> That is the insane thing I push for but then reluctantly give up in favor of what would actually break this deal... My nuclear submarine.<eos> Did he mention my sub?<eos> Mm-hmm, he did.<eos> Yes, he did.
Something that gives a sense of the man...<eos> Selfie from the daughter.<eos> Taken and posted on social media about 20 minutes before death.<eos> Well, he looks happy enough, doesn't he?<eos> They both do.
If he was, I had not picked up on it.<eos> Mm. So you went into the system and falsified the checks?<eos> He said he'd done it, just hadn't had time to log it.<eos> - Do you still believe that?<eos> - I did.
- What?<eos> - Don't try to understand 'em.<eos> I know what I'd kill for and what I'd die for.<eos> You served.<eos> You do too.
It has nothing to do with you.<eos> No, no, no, but it does!<eos> (scoffs) I get that you had to do what you think is right, But you could at least feel bad about it.<eos> You just massively derailed my career And you don't even care, do you?<eos> Yeah, you don't.
That was excellent.<eos> I knew you could do it.<eos> Good job, bud!<eos> Oh, I-I'm sure I mentioned it.<eos> - You didn't.
No, I just meant it... as a joke.<eos> I feel good here with you.<eos> You do?<eos> Can I say something stupid?<eos> I do it all the time!
It's never been fair.<eos> You always get what you want.<eos> Then you act like it's normal.<eos> Like reality doesn't count.<eos> And it never does.
Deservedly.<eos> Thank you, Alex.<eos> I like this new man.<eos> - Did you see that?<eos> - Yes. I did.
I would think, "I get it. You're upset, but don't be crazy.<eos> Don't act crazy."<eos> There's nothing crazy about believing no one cares as much about my son and what happened to him as I do.<eos> The police don't.<eos> The lawyers don't.
- Get out of my face!<eos> - Do you have a reasonable chub?<eos> - No! Let's see it!<eos> Prove it!<eos> - He does.
Dr. Murray was obsessed with data.<eos> He wanted to prove to the medical community that they were wrong, That he had the answer to curing all disease... with sound.<eos> I know. It seems crazy, but that's what I saw happening.<eos> - Everyone got better.<eos> - But then someone didn't.
What happened?<eos> Bo, your hand.<eos> Nyx is gone.<eos> The bracelet worked.<eos> No. It didn't.
- That's a really nice offer, but I wanna go where I'm wanted.<eos> And if you call them, then it's not about me.<eos> I should go wash my hands before I dig in to these potato skins.<eos> Jane, we have to convince her to let me make the call.<eos> - No, we don't.
Hi.<eos> Surprised I could get a ZoGo at this crazy hour.<eos> You guys still taking the online coupon?<eos> Hey, what'd you say your name was again?<eos> I didn't.
Let's just say I'm really good at reading people.<eos> Look, the point is... if this Maestro is so great maybe he can help you too.<eos> I'm okay, I'm fine.<eos> How did you know I don't like being alone?<eos> Because nobody does, not all the time.
No. No, it's not-<eos> - Well, yeah, it's gonna be a little weird, I guess.<eos> Listen, I have a question for you.<eos> Did you ever talk to my brother about you and me'?<eos> No, I didn't.
And you can do the same, Leland.<eos> Do you know what it's like to lose someone?<eos> To have them just snatched away from you?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, I do.
Which is why... you should be calling Wade right now.<eos> I just tried, but he's still not answering.<eos> So I don't believe in marriage.<eos> You know, my parents... theirs was a complete sham, so why would I?<eos> - Because Wade does.
And the police got to his money before you could.<eos> You know, Russ, I'm a little insulted you think I'm stupid enough to shoot a guy with my own gun and then dump the gun with the body.<eos> Well, who knew that you owned a gun? And who had access to it?<eos> And who knew your aliases?<eos> In answer to all three of those questions... she did.
He's a person, not some object for you to have your scientist experiments on.<eos> They're your scientists, too, Claire.<eos> They work for all of us.<eos> This isn't some underground, mercenary operation. This is the sovereign, federal government of the United States of America trying to protect our children from a threat that we don't fully understand.<eos> But Sean does, Wes.
He said it would just make her worry.<eos> Mm.<eos> Did you happen to get a look at the guy at the door?<eos> No.<eos> I didn't.
- Yeah. Where did the whole crystal ball thing come from?<eos> - Gypsies, real gypsies.<eos> - Oh. And crystal ball is used... It's a technique called scrying.<eos> - And it's been used...<eos> - A guy did that to me in college.
I just hope this guy can get all these Troubles the hell out of me.<eos> Howdy.<eos> We heard that we might be able to find someone here, uh... a healer.<eos> This look like a hospital to you?<eos> No, it doesn't.
That is bullshit.<eos> No goddamn way that's the same snowflake!<eos> Respectfully, yes it was.<eos> So wait, you think like five winters ago, a snowflake fell to the ground, and, like, melted, then evaporated and shit, went back up to the sky, then turned back into the same exact snowflake,<eos> Yes, I do.
In June last year, just after the Queen was crowned, your son Lord Montague and your son Geoffrey Pole dined with Lady Mary.<eos> Two weeks later, they dined with her again.<eos> I wonder what they discussed?<eos> I'm sure you do.<eos> Actually, no, I don't.
You.<eos> I produced this voice.<eos> But it's a huge step forward.<eos> We have a name now.<eos> We do?
One player.<eos> How's it going, Victor?<eos> It's a good thing I don't pay you by the hour.<eos> Got molasses in my ass, boss.<eos> How we doing?
Is it the best deal?<eos> Hell, no. But you and I both know you need a lifeline.<eos> That's what Stern is offering, a lifeline.<eos> You sign one of these?<eos> Yeah, I did.
I don't know, boy.<eos> I don't think them other kids like you.<eos> I don't think anybody does.<eos> Who the fuck wants some lanky loudmouth pissing in their ear, huh?<eos> Your mother sure didn't.
Again, rude.<eos> It's family money. Passed down from my father.<eos> But money isn't everything, Bart, Especially when you don't have anyone to share it with.<eos> You don't have any family?<eos> I did once, but not anymore.
I pay you to do!<eos> What have you told him?<eos> I've told him nothing, Ma'am.<eos> I believe he mentioned reading an old journal of Malcolm's. I assumed you gave it to him in an attempt to reveal the truth, as you said you would.<eos> I did no such thing.
I don't...<eos> I don't know his first name.<eos> Richard.<eos> - You know him?<eos> - Oh, yeah, most around here do.
Eat it, you little bastard.<eos> My mom wanted me to be a butcher, you know that?<eos> Oh, not the butcher story.<eos> I said, "No, Mom, I want to be a lawyer." I don't remember what I said next.<eos> No, you never do.
This again?<eos> Answer the question.<eos> What are you hiding?<eos> You don't trust me?<eos> No, I don't.
I resent that.<eos> Will you tell us The proposal story again?<eos> You don't want to hear that again.<eos> We done told it so many times.<eos> Aw, yes, we do! Please! Please!
Uh, no-- when we first met, i never thought i'd see you again.<eos> I thought you were spoiled, And i thought you were a brat.<eos> W...<eos> Yeah, well, i thought you were a jerk.<eos> I still do sometimes.
It-it just, it-it doesn't matter that we-we want to be together?<eos> It doesn't matter that we have, like, we have great chemistry?<eos> It doesn't matter that i love you?<eos> Did you just say that you love me?<eos> Yes. I did.
Into both of us.<eos> Into the firm, the whole damn thing.<eos> But once you told me manson was out, I took some steps.<eos> Padded the paychecks of a couple slobs at missing persons to call me in case anyone asked about that poor girl's file.<eos> This morning, someone did.
Do you have family here with you?<eos> Just my father and brother Amram.<eos> Amram's your brother?<eos> - You know him?<eos> - Yes. Everybody does.
My Christian name is Leo.<eos> Really, it's Lionel, but everyone calls me Leo.<eos> Does Marian call you that?<eos> I noticed you were talking earlier.<eos> Yes, she does.
You disgust me.<eos> Meanwhile, the King is bouncing another man's child on his knee.<eos> Your morality will not stand, Musketeer.<eos> ~ How do we know you won't betray us?<eos> ~ You don't.
"Uncle Marc"?<eos> Yeah, he's not technically your...<eos> Fine.<eos> I don't see why you have a problem with him.<eos> No, I don't.
How many more times do you want me to say it?<eos> No, but you can clearly see that I sent it, right?<eos> And when a text doesn't go through, you get that little red exclamation thingie,<eos> - which, as you can see...<eos> - You did not.
Because there was nothing to tell.<eos> Plus, he's not much of a talker... until he starts talk about Vivian, then he lights up.<eos> I'm telling you, April, this man loves his wife.<eos> Well, then don't worry, they'll get through it.<eos> And what if they don't?
Oh.<eos> [Inhales deeply] He died, didn't he?<eos> That old love of yours.<eos> Tom.<eos> Yes, he did.
You can't not know.<eos> You either like someone or you don't.<eos> All right.<eos> Oh. Is there a reason?<eos> I just don't.
The truth is, we did kind of try.<eos> A few years ago, I went off birth control, but then I got sick.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> It is what it is, but I have always wanted to be a mother, and I think I'd be a pretty damn good one, too.<eos> So do I.
I've got no genetic material in the mix.<eos> That's not what I think, and you know it.<eos> This baby was conceived out of love by all of us.<eos> It's as much yours as it is mine... if you want to be a part of its life.<eos> I do.
Yeah, I saw that.<eos> Oh, God, I just... Oh, baby, I think after everything that's happened, I-I... really, I just want to attack life.<eos> - You know?<eos> - Yeah. You want to talk about what's happened?<eos> No, I do not.
I did that! Well, I took it.<eos> It's a big hit, actually, should you want to start dating.<eos> Anyway, this guy's anecdote was about his fatty lipoma.<eos> - I don't know what that is.<eos> - Oh, I didn't either.
Bring the cursor up to the blue button and three, two, one, click it.<eos> Did you get it?<eos> Did you get it?<eos> !<eos> Yeah! The whole world did.
- It scratched Prince.<eos> Throw another stone and I'll sew a doormat with your mop!<eos> It's a chihuahua.<eos> And the cat surely has both rabies and the plague.<eos> Clearly you do, too.
-Mike, okay?<eos> But she likes you.<eos> And she trusts you and right now, you got her in heat.<eos> Mike, my job is to get that woman to trust me.<eos> Which she only half does.
Especially as the police have arrested two men.<eos> They were present, their testimonies could clear you.<eos> Clear him?<eos> Did you know this, Mr Moreau?<eos> No, I didn't.
I adored her.<eos> She was carrying your child.<eos> I...<eos> - I didn't know.<eos> - What if you did?
I thought that Kim said she found a home for him.<eos> - Hi, buddy. - Yeah, she did.<eos> With me.<eos> But Kim gets visitation rights.<eos> Of course she does.
Carl, you did great.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Yeah, thank you.<eos> S-so, you guys have boyfriends, or...<eos> Yeah, we do.
I-I don't want us to hate each other.<eos> Yeah, me, neither.<eos> We both went mean pretty quickly.<eos> We just have to find a way to stay friends during all of this, you know?<eos> Yeah, we do.
You make me sick.<eos> Oh, you're a Grimm again?<eos> I don't know what you are, but you know what's wrong.<eos> I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> Yeah, you do.
- Colette says you hate her.<eos> I love your mother.<eos> Does she love you?<eos> Yeah, I think, you know, in a way, yeah.<eos> Sure, yeah, she does.
No, it's not Kat.<eos> Hmm.<eos> This is a really nice office.<eos> Yeah, I thought you would like it.<eos> I do.
All the time.<eos> Dad?<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> Who wants ice cream?<eos> I do.
I'm not working the warrant, Joe.<eos> You can leave.<eos> I just need this.<eos> Well, now, that's gonna be a problem.<eos> - Because so do I.
W-Why, why?<eos> I tell you.<eos> No!<eos> You got provisions ready to move?<eos> Yes, we do, sir.
Oh, Dave... Dave...<eos> Can you take me back to my room?<eos> Sure, sure.<eos> So, does Molly want a bedtime story?<eos> - Yes, I do. - Mm.
Still trying to get ahold of her.<eos> Find her.<eos> Was that Frank again?<eos> - It doesn't matter.<eos> - Yeah, it kind of does.
You're angry, you lash out, you use people.<eos> But only because you don't know better.<eos> Been alone so long you don't know what it means to love someone.<eos> And here is a boy who so clearly loved you.<eos> He still does.
- Teen offenders with multiple arrests...<eos> - Why Rebecca's DNA... - The photos of Sam to pin the murder...<eos> Wes...<eos> I don't have anything.<eos> Michaela: Of course you do.
You're angry, you lash out, you use people.<eos> But only because you don't know better.<eos> Been alone so long you don't know what it means to love someone.<eos> And here is a boy who so clearly loved you.<eos> He still does.
Are we a bad couple for going at it like that?<eos> - I mean, we went ballistic.<eos> - Face it, babe.<eos> We're both strong-ass cups of tea who do not like to back down.<eos> - No, we do not.
More scotch?<eos> - Oh, thank you.<eos> - All right.<eos> I told you that Lance and I were engaged.<eos> Of course I did!
I lost the moral high ground once I bought a jet ski in his name<eos> - and ruined his credit.<eos> - You own a jet ski?<eos> Technically, he does.<eos> Or did.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.<eos> No, but I'm serious.<eos> How are you doing?<eos> I can't believe Bow told you.<eos> Ha. Of course she did.
Carl comes, too.<eos> No women for Carl.<eos> No women for Carl.<eos> Where'd you find another bottle of Curaçao?<eos> I didn't.
Listen, your mom was thinking maybe we could go to the dance together.<eos> - Oh, I don't know what...<eos> - So you already have a date?<eos> Not really.<eos> Well, you do now.
No, I want that shit you've been holding for me.<eos> - Still got it after all these years? - I just might.<eos> Let me go see.<eos> Your mama got the best ass in New York City.<eos> Always did.
Call Holly a bitch again.<eos> Go ahead.<eos> Tommy, alls I'm saying, man, is you're about to do Julio and do me over some broad you don't trust.<eos> - I trust her! - You don't.<eos> No, you don't.
And between us and that building are a hundred Turks intent on separating us from our limbs.<eos> That is assuming those vile killing machines don't shred us before then.<eos> Just so you know... Bad news was all you.<eos> How do we get past those soldiers?<eos> [DA VINCI) We don't.
You my girl. You ain't supposed to be kissing no damn India chick, and you know that.<eos> So, if it was a dude, it would've been all right?<eos> I'm not saying that. You got a sidepiece too.<eos> - Hakeem got a sidepiece?<eos> - Yes, he does.
Hey.<eos> I gave you that advice because I care.<eos> Look, I can't force a relationship between us, but... I think you do know I love you, don't you?<eos> Let me think.<eos> I don't.
Wait!<eos> Connie, wait!<eos> Why?<eos> Why don't you believe in us?<eos> I do.
I think he is right.<eos> You should call the police.<eos> Hey...<eos> I saw it on television.<eos> Everybody did.
Go to Rebecca's.<eos> See if you can be of use.<eos> Thought I'd have seen you a couple of days ago.<eos> Word of the mine must not have got to you.<eos> It did.
Fiona will have told them.<eos> They're as disgusted by me as you.<eos> Not me.<eos> I have not the sex that pleases you.<eos> You do.
Or no deal.<eos> Are you all right?<eos> I'm okay.<eos> How long have you known Fish Mooney?<eos> I don't.
- So what is it?<eos> Well, it's a hood.<eos> Thought it would, uh, you know, spice things up.<eos> When did we start wearing hoods?<eos> - We didn't.
You're lying.<eos> I'm gonna let you go now, and you're going to sit down and have breakfast with me.<eos> Come on.<eos> No!<eos> So I do it the hard way.
Jim, I do so love our give-and-take relationship.<eos> But it's starting to feel a bit one-sided.<eos> Fine.<eos> I'll owe you a favor.<eos> You already do.
When was this?<eos> -Almost nine years ago.<eos> - About a year before the first murder... He was working his way up.<eos> Why didn't you go to the police?<eos> I did.
For all of us.<eos> Well, I hope I didn't blow my chance to work on Lola one day.<eos> After that little RC version you built for me, I'm genuinely considering it.<eos> Although, I couldn't figure out how to make it fly.<eos> It doesn't.
Sir, the crate is empty.<eos> My worst fear has come true.<eos> We have to assume they were all taken at the same time back in the '40s.<eos> Does that mean Hydra has them?<eos> And if Hydra doesn't, who does?
Take the cadaver to the lab.<eos> Compare him to the other samples.<eos> Hail HYDRA.<eos> I told you I'd put our family back together.<eos> Yes, you did.
Debbie, no, this is terrible. Now we're actually taking money away from them. Let me just...<eos> No, wait, wait, wait. Maybe our luck has finally changed.<eos> W-What are you doing?<eos> The double streets along with a quad bet and one straight up on 17. What?<eos> My sorority did a lot of casino nights.
- Deep in their ship, under lock and key.<eos> - For now.<eos> - Sounds like somebody knows something we don't.<eos> - Jiaying, this doesn't concern him.<eos> - Yes. Yes, it does.
His own wife, my husband.<eos> He destroyed my family.<eos> Why didn't you tell the detectives five years ago?<eos> Do they know what we're talking about?<eos> We do.
I was close.<eos> If I had known what he was before I told him about Theo and Patty, I never would have told him.<eos> I'm not going back in that house.<eos> Something killed Raymond. Yeah.<eos> Something did.
We're Ghost Seekers. It's what we're supposed to do!<eos> I never thought any of this was really real.<eos> Well, now we have proof that it is, and you want to run away.<eos> Yes.<eos> I do.
All right.<eos> Oh, by the way, there's a patient asking for you, bed seven.<eos> Hey.<eos> I don't know if you remember me.<eos> No, of course I do.
What did you say?<eos> I said yes.<eos> I said I wanted to marry him.<eos> And then I told him about what happened when he was away.<eos> You did?
Look, if you're gonna kill me... Go ahead.<eos> I probably deserve it, but... Leave innocent people out of it.<eos> I have no intention of killing you, Mr. Stark.<eos> I am going to make you suffer.<eos> Please don't do this.
Killed who?<eos> My dad.<eos> They paid him to lose against Creel. But...<eos> But I wanted him to win.<eos> So he did because of me.
Oh, my boy's a liar now, huh?<eos> He say it, or not?<eos> - Speak up when I'm talking to you.<eos> - He said it.<eos> No, I didn't.
He say it, or not?<eos> - Speak up when I'm talking to you.<eos> - He said it.<eos> No, I didn't.<eos> My dad did.
You see the news?<eos> Everything's changed.<eos> Fisk has gotten out in front of being dragged into the spotlight.<eos> My editor thinks he's the Second Coming.<eos> Hell, the whole city does.
Is this about the extension?<eos> Let's speak outside, yeah?<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> - How do you know you did everything?<eos> I did everything.
She already spoke Greek.<eos> Whatever happened to her?<eos> She was smokin'.<eos> Man, it didn't work out.<eos> When does it ever with you, buddy?
If you say "it's complicated," I will punch you in the face.<eos> It's personal!<eos> It's personal, okay?<eos> Okay... okay, it's personal, I get it.<eos> Really don't.
- Oh, my--oh, God!<eos> - Oh, is it--is it bad?<eos> Yeah.<eos> So you never had the VIP tickets, huh?<eos> No, bud, I didn't.
Now then...<eos> Where did your son and queen go?<eos> I'm afraid I don't know.<eos> He doesn't know.<eos> None of them do.
Come here, babe.<eos> Shh. It's okay, Phoebe.<eos> You know, Will seems like a solid, very young guy.<eos> - He is.<eos> - He does.
She's 20 points behind the other two.<eos> But the sexism thing?<eos> And going after Dunbar's kids?<eos> - It seemed quite desperate.<eos> - She did do some damage to Dunbar.
Okay, back to ones. Still rolling.<eos> - Why?<eos> Why?<eos> - You said "moina."<eos> - You sure did.
_<eos> And Jane realized exactly what had happened.<eos> Did you tell the writers to act like they liked my idea?<eos> Uh... are you enjoying your new job?<eos> Rogelio, did you?
And Jane realized exactly what had happened.<eos> Did you tell the writers to act like they liked my idea?<eos> Uh... are you enjoying your new job?<eos> Rogelio, did you?<eos> Yes, I did.
_<eos> I'm just saying... our first case together.<eos> And the last.<eos> And we caught the bad guy!<eos> We definitely did.
Really?<eos> Yeah.<eos> No response yet but...<eos> I think it's good.<eos> I really do.
You got to raise her.<eos> Don't you want that for Rogelio?<eos> I mean, if he wants it...<eos> - More children?<eos> Of course I do.
Of course.<eos> Do you think they'll last?<eos> Jane and Rafael?<eos> 'Cause I don't think they will.<eos> Deep down, I-I don't.
Are you nervous?<eos> A little.<eos> You know I hate needles.<eos> I just need to have faith.<eos> And I do.
Right.<eos> Dad is considering going to Mexico.<eos> How does that make you feel?<eos> You know.<eos> No, we don't.
You have a shaman?<eos> Yes. Uh...<eos> I went to an ashram a few weeks ago.<eos> I know, I know, I know it sounds silly.<eos> No. It doesn't.
I just have this order, you know?<eos> Date, engaged...<eos> Get married, then have a baby.<eos> And just because this baby thing happened first, I don't want to throw out the whole order.<eos> Or rather, I do.
And maybe for the better.<eos> Maybe it's time your life changes, too.<eos> I mean, you don't want to live here forever, right?<eos> In grandma's house?<eos> - No, I don't.
Seems pretty conservative, though.<eos> Okay, consider my source.<eos> I'm getting fashion advice from Mrs. Purple Doc Martens.<eos> I don't have Purple Doc Martens.<eos> Yes, you do.
Becca, look. You called off your wedding to Sean, not to mention a week in Aruba, and that's fine, 'cause it's your life.<eos> But do you really have the right to change the course of other people's lives?<eos> Lolly, I am not planning on ruining anyone's life here.<eos> I'm just... I just need to know if he felt the same...<eos> That thing that I did.
Okay.<eos> For most people, it's all about sex, but not me.<eos> I prefer to spoon. For hours.<eos> Do you like to spoon?<eos> I do not.
I can take down his dirt bag brother too.<eos> You didn't do that alone, remember?<eos> How are any of these guys going to protect me?<eos> They don't know. They don't know what Mardon's capable of.<eos> All right, well, lucky for you, your friends at S.T.A.R. Labs do.
Are you okay?<eos> We were so worried.<eos> What happened?<eos> How did you escape?<eos> I didn't.
Until he uploads another video, it's gonna be tough.<eos> This psychopath has the capability to destroy the city.<eos> Hey, I said tough, not impossible.<eos> Barry, we'll catch him.<eos> We always do.
I'm sorry.<eos> I'm not mad at you.<eos> It's just...<eos> You miss him, right?<eos> Yeah, I do.
Come on.<eos> - Wherever they're taking us we're here.<eos> Ferris Air?<eos> I thought this place got shut down.<eos> It did.
~ I don't want to talk to you.<eos> ~ Cos DI Hardy's here?<eos> ~ Was I not clear?<eos> ~ Don't you want to put your side of the story?<eos> ~ No, I don't.
Did you enjoy yourself, lying in there?<eos> It's not my husband in the dock.<eos> ~ I suppose you knew all along.<eos> ~ No!<eos> Of course you did.
~ You wanna what?<eos> I'm not ready to stop.<eos> In fact I'm just getting going again.<eos> ~ You don't want to end on a loss.<eos> ~ No, I bloody don't,
And I haven't heard from him in a few days.<eos> I tried calling his phone this morning, but the number's been disconnected.<eos> Have you called the hospitals?<eos> Checked with friends, relatives?<eos> I... I did all of that.
But at least it's a chance.<eos> And, in success, he'll be able to undo whatever it is they did to him.<eos> I'd envy that.<eos> I guess I got to learn how to live with it, huh?<eos> We both do.
And help the deaf, so it's a two-fer.<eos> I'm not home. AJ:<eos> No, no, no, no.<eos> We need a third.<eos> Of course you do.
Or at least make it to Dana's window without having to be rescued by firemen.<eos> You know, you really need to stop climbing things.<eos> Look, all I wanted was to be seen as your boyfriend, not some little kid.<eos> No one thinks that.<eos> Of course they do.
Everyone likes music.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> I think Pops is right.<eos> How can he actually not like music?<eos> Some dads just don't.
Absolutely.<eos> Now, don't misinterpret my advice again.<eos> Don't be hurtful. Just be funny.<eos> I 100% got it.<eos> But I didn't.
It's basically the worst thing you can say about a dude.<eos> Not to me. Everyone is always trying to be funny or cool or someone they're not.<eos> The last thing I want is to be with some clown.<eos> I just want to be with you.<eos> Or at least, I did.
Are you gonna tattle on me, too?<eos> But I... get back to class, or you're grounded.<eos> What do you mean, the car's already been reported stolen?<eos> The question is, how did you know it was stolen?<eos> I didn't.
- I luh you.<eos> What?<eos> I luh you.<eos> - What? - You heard me.<eos> I really didn't.
We're black.<eos> When did he start believing that immigrants should go back across the border, that evolution doesn't exist?<eos> ! - They should.<eos> - What?<eos> And it doesn't.
That he's probably in Jamaica surrounded by a brood of bastard kids.<eos> And you don't believe her?<eos> Your dad's gone, he's gone.<eos> It doesn't matter why.<eos> Sure it does.
He's cool.<eos> I already told him all this shit anyway.<eos> Oh, yeah, yeah, we had a great talk on the drive over.<eos> He says you guys are with Tigerhawk Security?<eos> He did, huh?
I should have.<eos> But I didn't have any information that would've helped.<eos> It was a no-win situation.<eos> I really wanna believe you.<eos> But you don't?
I'll need help getting him out.<eos> Getting him out?<eos> Miss Borden, I really must go.<eos> Listen, you have secrets.<eos> So do I.
~ Improve his time-keeping.<eos> ~ His bad breath in the mornings...<eos> Oh, please, Shamshad, I'm trying to eat.<eos> ~ Sita needs to know all about.<eos> ~ No, she does not.
If you can't control yourself, please go indoors.<eos> Tuck in, love.<eos> Anyway, it's all booked.<eos> Did I tell you the Mclellands and the Rowses are travelling with us right up to Tilbury?<eos> Yes, you did.
SPEAKS IN NATIVE LANGUAGE<eos> ~ You...?<eos> ~ No questions.<eos> Who?<eos> Who did?
Thank you, sir. [Laughing] Okay.<eos> Wow, that means a lot.<eos> Thank you. All right, who wants to see the Texas skip?<eos> Yeah!<eos> Yeah! I do!
You just need time to...<eos> I did things in the line of duty, horrible things, but I have never wanted to kill an innocent woman.<eos> Do you want to kill her now?<eos> - No. God, no.<eos> - No, because you never did.
I don't even know what the hell I'm looking for.<eos> Anything that points to where Antoine might've gone.<eos> Airline receipts, train schedules.<eos> Won't find any of that if someone grabbed him.<eos> No one did.
It's not my fault.<eos> See, I hate that.<eos> I want everything to be my fault.<eos> Good or bad. Means I have some control.<eos> - You don't.
There's only one that can help Luke.<eos> I just don't want him to wake up alone, not knowing what's happening.<eos> I don't even know what's happening.<eos> It's asking a lot, and you don't know me, but...<eos> Sure I do.
I don't think you should, either.<eos> What's going on with you?<eos> Been bailing on meetings and then when you do show, you never talk.<eos> Your enthusiasm for the program never waxes and wanes?<eos> Sure it does.
Let me guess.<eos> You were a cheerleader, and he was the star quarterback. Ha!<eos> Ha ha! I used to get high behind metal shop every day, and Daisy honey trapped her teachers into giving her As.<eos> How do you guys know Marisol?<eos> Oh, we don't.
I'm sorry. This is all my fault.<eos> I thought I was protecting you.<eos> I wanted to believe him.<eos> I loved him.<eos> I still do.
I don't get it.<eos> Why would they just leave like this?<eos> I don't know, Alan.<eos> Wait.<eos> Yes, I do.
My lawyer believed I would be released.<eos> Then orders from the Defense Department arrived, and I ended up in this hell hole.<eos> Defense Secretary Richards has to be the one who's behind this.<eos> You believe I'm innocent?<eos> Yes, I do.
I didn't do anything.<eos> I'm just trying to piece together what occurred... What you saw, what you were thinking, that kind of thing.<eos> I understand. It just gets a little confusing sometimes.<eos> Of course.<eos> These things always do.
Yeah. You can go anywhere.<eos> You can go to Tulsa or New York or anywhere.<eos> What's in Tulsa?<eos> You told mother?<eos> Amantha did.
- Do you see yourself as having a temper?<eos> Do you think you have trouble controlling your impulses?<eos> Sometimes.<eos> Did you kill George Melton?<eos> I did not.
Sometimes it's like you had something special with somebody, and it's... it's hard to make those feelings go away.<eos> That's exactly what I'm saying.<eos> Hey, so she didn't want me back.<eos> At all.<eos> Oh, she... she didn't?
What do you want, Cromwell?<eos> Well, I hear that she's telling people that if the King marries Lady Anne, he has only a year to reign.<eos> I just wondered who was controlling her.<eos> She may be a simple country girl, but she has a genuine gift.<eos> She does, doesn't she?
Well, Barton told her she'd be Queen of England.<eos> I repeat my comment.<eos> You don't believe in her visions, then?<eos> I don't.<eos> She does it for attention.
I haven't got the proof I need.<eos> This, to my mind, is evidence of malpractice but it doesn't actually prove anything.<eos> Geoffrey Inler says he burned the proof seven years ago.<eos> Do you believe him?<eos> No, I don't.
How did you find out about that?<eos> I'm a detective.<eos> Nah.<eos> Nothing could ever make me hate Scottie.<eos> Well, somebody did.
You wanna talk about it?<eos> Walter never wants to talk about work.<eos> Well, we're just... We're fixing to do something tomorrow and I don't think it's a good idea, but the boss is one of these...<eos> Well, you trust him. You know that.<eos> I did.
Then that is what you'll do.<eos> Who knows why they chose 15 years, but things had got a whole lot better.<eos> I got a place at MIT, graduated, and got a job in astrophysics.<eos> Mom got clean and looked younger than ever before.<eos> In fact, everyone did.
So, saddle up.<eos> What does this guy Peterson have on you?<eos> Why do you ask?<eos> Because you're acting like he has something on you.<eos> He doesn't.
Angela, i think we should prepare to go for an arrest warrant on egan.<eos> I want you to work with knox and swear out an affidavit with the judge.<eos> Saxe will go apeshit.<eos> Saxe will handle lobos if we get him.<eos> You do egan.
Turns out I could only save one of us.<eos> I pick me.<eos> So you're completely done with Tommy?<eos> You don't care what happens to him?<eos> No, I don't.
- Your "Being" doesn't exist.<eos> Realized that when I was 10 years old.<eos> Prayed for him to heal me.<eos> He never answered.<eos> Yes, he did.
It wouldn't matter if Bosch had backed your story.<eos> You think the forensics came back in your favor?<eos> You think they found GSR on his hands?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> They didn't.
It's gonna be all fancy, and you love fundraisers.<eos> Um, I...<eos> What?<eos> Brenna, I know before I left, we were thinking my parents would forget about what happened and they wouldn't care if we saw each other.<eos> But they still do.
And again, I am sorry we couldn't go back to my place.<eos> My lazy landlord is finally fumigating.<eos> It's okay.<eos> I just hope that my mom doesn't come home.<eos> Or actually, maybe I kind of do.
All right, well, I'll go to the show tonight.<eos> It's our wedding. One of us should be there.<eos> And since you're at your bachelorette party, Frankie and I will go and make sure that the band is right for us.<eos> - Okay, if you really want to.<eos> - Of course we do!
It's my last night in town and I don't wanna find her...<eos> Yeah. Of course.<eos> Wow.<eos> Judging from all this food, looks like I better go put on some sweats.<eos> How you doing, kid?
- What do you want?<eos> Pictures.<eos> ♪ ♪<eos> Henrietta, I need your help.<eos> You do.
Simmer down. I have my own bedroom.<eos> Well, this is all very beautiful, but when do we get serious?<eos> Don't make the mistake of thinking we're not.<eos> We did not come all this way again to go back empty-handed.<eos> No, we did not.
An eye for an eye, I say.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Anyway, this is a conversation for another time.<eos> But speaking of government, did you know that Simon was class president?<eos> Oh, yeah. Yeah, I did.
Okay, I'm sorry, man. I'm just...<eos> I'm frustrated, and I'm hungry, and I'm cold. It's okay.<eos> I-I understand.<eos> Wait. Wait, doesn't the hospital have supercomputers?<eos> Yeah, they do.
He's still following us. We stick to the plan.<eos> At least we know he's after us and not our friends.<eos> Till death do us part, right?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Till death do us part.
My parents, they, uh... they didn't romanticize their wedding the way yours did.<eos> Oh, well, you know, everybody's different, you know?<eos> Doesn't mean they didn't love each other.<eos> No, I know.<eos> And they did.
And they did.<eos> It wasn't until it hit me that we might not get a real wedding that I realized that I might want one.<eos> Do you?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, I do.
Henry will now explain.<eos> We're working on the Aaron Brown murder.<eos> I believe he stopped here minutes before he was killed.<eos> Somebody did knock on my door that night, but why would Aaron want to come see me?<eos> He didn't.
Over time, however, one learns that the choices of those we love are impossible to control.<eos> You'll write... every day.<eos> Every day? Come on, mom.<eos> [Chuckles, sniffles] I love you so much, Abraham.<eos> Henry: We both do.
Having trouble narrowing down a place?<eos> No, it's just, things are...<eos> Well, they're moving so fast.<eos> And... you're afraid you don't like him?<eos> No, I-I-I'm afraid that I do.
They're all yours.<eos> Sheriff.<eos> Think I just found something.<eos> I think we're going to love it here, Abraham.<eos> I really do.
I already told you, you fucking priss.<eos> You're fucking nothing to me.<eos> I don't fucking want you.<eos> I don't want to come with you to fucking Bristol.<eos> I never did.
Must be intimidating, having a brother in the political spotlight.<eos> It's not that.<eos> He, uh, inherited my father's Southern charm, so everybody loves Lyman.<eos> But you don't?<eos> No, of course I do.
Yeah, but... But I've never seen this before.<eos> It was in the kitchen in that folder.<eos> Kate's folio.<eos> Look, I don't even know what it means.<eos> I do.
Thank you.<eos> Thank you all for coming in.<eos> This should only take a minute.<eos> Have any of you seen her?<eos> I did.
- It'll only take a moment.<eos> Oscar told me about the rift between you two.<eos> I hope you had a chance to reconcile.<eos> I don't know.<eos> Maybe we did.
-It'll only take a moment.<eos> Oscar told me about the rift between you two.<eos> I hope you had a chance to reconcile.<eos> -I don't know.<eos> -Maybe we did.
I have always had terrible luck with friendships.<eos> A lot of my female friends have either gotten married or hated me.<eos> Terrible luck. And last night, when we were on the stairs,<eos> I just felt like we had a real connection.<eos> - We did, right?
Let's say you're right, that the Russians did come in this way.<eos> How did they get in the basement?<eos> Security's posted at the service entrance.<eos> They must've found another way in.<eos> How you doing?
But only one was involved in the slaying of the judge's wife.<eos> We think both were guilty for Novo, though.<eos> Which would more easily explain the crucifixion.<eos> Both suspects have to die?<eos> [Shafe] They did.
- Also, the entirety of their recent stumbles with Homicide, with Intersite, with the very decision to pursue video instead of more pioneering applications.<eos> This was all rooted in human error, which is why I found it prudent to secure Hanneman's shares, his voting rights, and most critically, his board seats.<eos> Right.<eos> Russ has two board seats.<eos> He did.
Maybe you should've stolen a blueprints from that sociopath mother of yours, since she runs the place.<eos> Your mother is using Micah and his powers to-- to control every single bit of information out there.<eos> We don't have much time.<eos> So, unless you have a better way to break in, that is the plan.<eos> I do.

And put an end to this scourge once and for all.<eos> They'll never see it coming.<eos> In Otranto, the Turks anticipated our every move.<eos> How do we know this time will be different?<eos> We don't.
She could always do worse.<eos> Alright.<eos> Yeah, what's up?<eos> - We need to talk about Mom.<eos> - Do we? Yeah.
- Sir?<eos> - Come in.<eos> Close the door.<eos> We have a formal complaint from Tactical alleging that we have a leak.<eos> Maybe we do.
- Come in.<eos> Close the door.<eos> We have a formal complaint from Tactical alleging that we have a leak.<eos> Maybe we do.<eos> Maybe they do.
We're covered now.<eos> Listen, I... I should go.<eos> We'll be fine.<eos> - I'll talk to you later.<eos> Hey, buddy, how you doing?
Leave the books.<eos> Who cares?<eos> Did you tell dad I was helping Jo get stronger?<eos> Is that why he's pissed?<eos> Of course you did.
Sir Galavant will fight the first match.<eos> I can tell you want to bail.<eos> I'll give you five seconds to bail.<eos> I don't want to bail. - I do.<eos> - You do?
Does the name Willem Sassen mean anything to you?<eos> He's Dutch and was an SS war correspondent.<eos> After the war, he was Peron's press agent.<eos> But now the political situation in Argentina isn't so rosy, he's got money troubles.<eos> Who doesn't?
-Are you worried that the stranger will be ugly And/or a creep and/or a catfish?<eos> The stranger will think that you are ugly and/or a creep?<eos> -Yes.<eos> -Are you nervous about having bad breath?<eos> -Well, you don't.
A shipment.<eos> A bust of the king commissioned from a Miss Patience Wright in London.<eos> But I don't have it.<eos> I...<eos> I never did.
Come on!<eos> What's happening?<eos> What's wrong with him?<eos> Hey, Travis.<eos> How you doing?
I live in Ronkonkoma.<eos> And you came by yourself?<eos> I was supposed to meet a girlfriend.<eos> (Benson) Supposed to?<eos> So you didn't?
Lenny Simmons is a free press crusader.<eos> (Amaro) You, on the other hand, are just Scott Russo's cleaning lady.<eos> He's really worth 20 years in jail?<eos> I swear I don't have the footage.<eos> LMZ does.
I'll help take care of you, dad.<eos> I can do stuff around the house.<eos> You'll see.<eos> Don't you want me?<eos> Of course I do.
- Merry Christmas, brother. - Dude!<eos> You saved me, man!<eos> You saved me!<eos> Well, I wouldn't go that far.<eos> No, all right, I totally did.
He's, um... He's... He's not coming.<eos> - I told you.<eos> - Why isn't he coming?<eos> Daddy's not coming, Daddy's not coming.<eos> I didn't, um...
You can't compare it.<eos> Well, weren't they about his age when they started running numbers for Mr. Dolan?<eos> That was different.<eos> We didn't have a father around.<eos> Yeah, but James does.
See if he has any clue what this job's about.<eos> I'll leave it to you three to make the call.<eos> And don't worry about my contract with the old man.<eos> We gave him a shot, if it doesn't work out, then as my dear, old grandmother Octavia used to say,<eos> How you doing, kid?
What Charles P. Thompson?<eos> The Anzac legend?<eos> My very own flesh and blood.<eos> Well, he never had any kids.<eos> No, but his sister, Dorothy, she did.
You can stop here.<eos> Why here?<eos> This is where she died.<eos> My beautiful little girl.<eos> We both did.
So you just got there?<eos> Okay, she just got there.<eos> Good.<eos> Well, how many centimeters is she?<eos> You don't... okay, good.
You love working here.<eos> I can make money.<eos> It's just for a little while. And we'll work here together as well.<eos> I think we can do it.<eos> You do?
How's it going, fellas? - Hi.<eos> - Hi.<eos> How you doing?
Well, because that's just what I was taught, and...<eos> You were also taught that assault is against the law.<eos> Or do you think it's legitimate to go around hurting people?<eos> No, sir.<eos> I do not.
You're looking for him?<eos> Well, I was hoping he could...<eos> Write me a happy ending.<eos> But that book seems to have great power.<eos> Oh, it does.
- No, no, this has nothing to do with ... And anyone who tells you, that does not ?<eos> It was for this who? away from me.<eos> You do not know com '? live with me, Bego? To me endured for years ... and worth more?<eos> - I can not lose the family I have left.<eos> - No, no, nothing to do with your family.
Honestly, I think you got off pretty easy on this one, John.<eos> Yeah, I can live with tennis as a one-time thing.<eos> It'll get Billy off Theresa's back, and I get to whoop some ass on the court.<eos> Oh, I love cocky Johnny.<eos> Yeah, you do.
You are to me.<eos> You know, I am going to go and put this beautiful necklace on right now.<eos> Oh, you outdid yourself, padre.<eos> Come here.<eos> You sure did, padre.
I appreciate it.<eos> You know, those candles don't work unless you put $3 in them.<eos> Oh, yeah?<eos> You have change for a 5?<eos> I do not.
I'd take him back in a heartbeat.<eos> So you don't care that he's pretentious, as long as he knows he's pretentious.<eos> He's really cute, John.<eos> - If you like blonds.<eos> - Well, I do.
Mailman never crossed your mind?<eos> I like the shorts idea, my head's too big for a safari hat.<eos> I'll be right back, I'm gonna run to the restroom.<eos> Hang on, you got a pass?<eos> As a matter of fact, I do.
Of what?<eos> She got herself a job as a dancer at a local hula company.<eos> Sounds innocent enough, except for the part that it's a front for an escort service.<eos> They're running a joint investigation right now with the P.A.'s office.<eos> They do.
Yo, yo, yo!<eos> - The pizza party?<eos> ! - Oh, my gosh, Eddie.<eos> You won?<eos> No, Cindy Horowitz did.
Well, my money's on the fact that these two have a history together.<eos> Reddington, Braxton-- they're planning something.<eos> Whatever it is, you're going to find out.<eos> Oh, we don't have authorization.<eos> You do now.
Plain and simple, we kill him before he kills us.<eos> Hello.<eos> Carter.<eos> - He heard.<eos> - I didn't.
You don't have to do this.<eos> Yes, I do, or someone else will get hurt.<eos> Someone whose life still matters.<eos> No, your life matters. No.<eos> No, it doesn't.
In all the pictures, I had these huge chipmunk cheeks.<eos> - I was like...<eos> - That's so cute.<eos> Yeah, it's good, though, 'cause, um, it'll make more room in my mouth, right?<eos> No, I, I didn't...
Yeah, it's good, though, 'cause, um, it'll make more room in my mouth, right?<eos> No, I, I didn't...<eos> I didn't mean, um, blow jobs.<eos> Although, if that is true, that it would make more room in my mouth.<eos> I didn't do them.
Lord Byron.<eos> That's a fancy name for a snake.<eos> Yeah, it looks more like a Paul.<eos> Listen, I didn't name it.<eos> My pretentious douche bag ex-boyfriend did.
I'm going to get absolutely snozzelled.<eos> Well, this is leading towards something dangerously misguided.<eos> We'll see how she likes taking care of me for a change.<eos> You probably don't want to get to "Level Two Jimmy drunk" around all these people.<eos> Or maybe I do.
Stop.<eos> Stop.<eos> Stop.<eos> Don't.<eos> Please don't...
Okay, well, I didn't do it, okay?<eos> You're my alibi.<eos> How?<eos> You know damn well why I didn't go and meet her.<eos> Yeah, unfortunately, I do.
If you're here, maybe you get my number.<eos> Miss Pierce?<eos> - You hacking into the Pentagon?<eos> - Yep.<eos> Careful, they don't do WikiLeak documentaries on brothers.
It is, thank you.<eos> Take a trip to historical Coach-town.<eos> Lunch will be provided.<eos> I don't eat yesterday's bread.<eos> Yes, you do.
'Cause I don't want you to think I'm, like, a bad guy.<eos> Oh, what do you care what I think?<eos> We barely know each other.<eos> I don't know.<eos> I just do.
I have a meeting with my editor right after this. - I can't be late.<eos> - Understood, Mr. Solloway.<eos> If you cooperate, this goes quicker.<eos> Do you even want custody of them?<eos> Of course I do.
She's beautiful.<eos> Oh, isn't she, though?<eos> Everybody says she looks like Alison, but to me she looks like her daddy.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, she does to me, too.
The Man's mama wore that very dress the day she got married.<eos> Ain't it beautiful?<eos> It's real pretty.<eos> You wore it when you got married?<eos> We all done.
There-there was, there was a man and he was trying to tell me something.<eos> I need, uh, something to write. A pen and paper.<eos> Here we go.<eos> We have an address.<eos> Oh, yes, we do.
- I've got a gun in my hands.<eos> - Donnie!<eos> You brought a gun to a drug deal?<eos> - What, are you crazy?<eos> - Of course, I did.
No, don't apologise.<eos> Don't do that.<eos> What's it said to you?<eos> Simon has had nothing to do with this.<eos> Yes, he... Yes, IT does!
You look after yourself.<eos> Bye-bye, baby.<eos> She's your sister, you know that, don't you?<eos> You will think of her as your sister.<eos> Course I do.
I didn't really expect you to come all the way over from Manchester tonight.<eos> Oh, I'm delighted, I told you.<eos> It's... very kind of you.<eos> Well, we need to see what we can do, don't we?<eos> Yes, we do!
Because he feels guilty.<eos> Look, Gary, no-one thinks you did it out of malice.<eos> Well, maybe. I dunno.<eos> Maybe he SHOULD feel a little bit guilty.<eos> Yeah, well, he does.
Hey, how are you?<eos> You come here often?<eos> I know you guys are just sticking up for Justin, but my dad raised me himself.<eos> I don't really have a choice.<eos> No, you do, actually.
At the time Everett was shot, your paintball team had just split up.<eos> Was there anyone who could account for you, just before the body was discovered?<eos> Make no mistake, Harris.<eos> We're gonna catch whoever did this.<eos> Not if I do first.
This is your way out.<eos> If you get caught, you will be killed.<eos> Why are you helping me?<eos> Because I never had a choice.<eos> Now you do.
He was waiting for us when he showed up.<eos> Reporter called him, told him Stokes is gonna skate on Arthur's murder, told him about this place.<eos> So, Delacroix was waiting here for him this morning.<eos> Popped him when he came downstairs.<eos> Harry, don't.
It's Scottie.<eos> Oh, shit.<eos> I know.<eos> Scottie doesn't do favors like this and I don't have any leverage on her.<eos> Yeah, you do.
I'm here because I want to be here.<eos> You see? That's sweet.<eos> But how can I ever believe a word you say?<eos> I want to know if you ever thought once to tell me the truth about Mike.<eos> No, I didn't.
I'll take them.<eos> Course you will.<eos> Cheers.<eos> Now no-one will see me coming.<eos> Well, I did.
- Who?<eos> - Black Benny?<eos> Jakey, don't make me try to throw a drink at you again.<eos> Mm, I don't want you to do that.<eos> - Nobody does. - Mm-mm.
I was coming up this way anyway.<eos> Why?<eos> Uh, there's a horse I wanted to look at.<eos> I thought you lost the ranch.<eos> Yeah, I did.
I know.<eos> I'm sorry, who are you?<eos> Look, I'm just here to help.<eos> And how did you know Alice?<eos> I don't.
No, it's, um, it's an ear infection and a chest cold, and this is my life.<eos> This is what it looks like now.<eos> Well, that question you were asking before about, do I want to be involved in my daughter's life?<eos> Yeah?<eos> Of course I do.
And when Raylan comes back with my keys, we're gonna make the change, and it's nice in there.<eos> I got an air freshener smells like a mocha latte.<eos> - You hear that?<eos> - Uh, no, I di...<eos> Yes, I did.
I like everything that just happened except that you let Azmorigan live.<eos> That'll be a problem for me later.<eos> I think you have a problem now.<eos> You don't have the credits you owe us, do you?<eos> In fact, you never did.
There's something familiar.<eos> I feel... Cold.<eos> I think I know who it is.<eos> Back on Lothal I felt something.<eos> Kanan did too.
And Dennis was on top of her trying to take her clothes off.<eos> What did you do?<eos> Well, I pulled him off of her, and I told him to get the hell out of my house.<eos> You called the police.<eos> No, I didn't.
I'm sorry, what was that?<eos> I couldn't hear it over the sound of your shirt.<eos> As General Manager of Manion's, I expect you to respect my wishes and address all questions and comments.<eos> "Why doesn't Manion's offer vegan options?"<eos> Oh, it does!
Richmond was a woman whose daughter was doing a double at a burger joint, when she threw fry oil all over some loudmouth customers.<eos> No history of vience. She just lost it.<eos> Like Jason.<eos> Rebecca asked mom if Fry Girl drank Max Rager.<eos> She did.
Minx has the same thing Henry does.<eos> Oh, I'm sorry.<eos> She have a fever?<eos> It's not just her.<eos> They all do.
Thanks.<eos> Hello?<eos> You referred a case to me!<eos> Oh, so you took it?<eos> Yeah, of course, I did.
We can walk down the street holding hands.<eos> If I take a job tricking people into buying things they don't want.<eos> Do you enjoy billboards and commercials, Miss Perry?<eos> You mean shill-boards and con-mercials?<eos> No, I don't.
Yeah, I heard there was no paintball. I heard it was banned.<eos> Well, you can't believe everything you hear.<eos> Okay, you just asked if I heard something and now you're invalidating the whole.<eos> Do you know why I beat you, Todd?<eos> Seriously, you don't?
No?<eos> Well, that's your problem.<eos> I love you, Abed.<eos> Do I know how to be a good wedding guest?<eos> Yes, I do.
That's what we did last year. Ugh!<eos> We're treating him like a leap-year baby. Sue's birthday...<eos> that's coming up, too!<eos> Oh, seriously, why do we have two birthdays so close together?<eos> We didn't.
We didn't.<eos> Brick, listen...<eos> Um, I don't even know if you're aware of this, but, um, it's come to my attention that it's possible we might have missed your birthday.<eos> Oh, you did.<eos> You definitely did.
If I were a man...<eos> Oh, come on.<eos> you never would've... This is about two people trying to run a law firm.<eos> This has nothing to do with sexism.<eos> Like hell it doesn't.
She's a paralegal on his defense team named Juliana Barnes.<eos> She visited him in jail more often than anybody else, frequently alone, and she recently paid off 100 grand in debt.<eos> We got to talk to her.<eos> Do you like ironing?<eos> Most people don't.
Hail to the chief, y'all.<eos> Say hello to the new sixth grade president.<eos> I'm the Abe Lincoln of Abe Lincoln middle school!<eos> Looks like our good luck continues.<eos> Sure does.
There, that's settled.<eos> Thank you.<eos> - Do you believe him?<eos> - Yes.<eos> I do.
I want you to do what you've done here for the rest of the city.<eos> No interference.<eos> I call the shots, end of story.<eos> - You work for the German.<eos> - I did a job for him once.
But he does have a brother named Curtis.<eos> A firefighter who lives on Staten Island?<eos> You probably don't want to waste your time with this.<eos> I think you may be onto something.<eos> You do?
Hmm?<eos> After dark?<eos> If the professor suggested that, you'd lock him away in here.<eos> We don't have a choice.<eos> Yeah. I do.
- I know every shortcut in town.<eos> - You're actually going through with this?<eos> You're gonna blow up a New York City subway station?<eos> I thought you liked architecture.<eos> I do, Doc.
Right, they got uh,<eos> Silver Angel vs. the Robot Assassin.<eos> No, no, how about the Silver Angel vs. the Rage of the Witch?<eos> Ooh! Hey, and that one, there's this part right where, where this crazy bitch is about to light this little boy on fire, right?<eos> And Angel, he does this backflip, and just... just bah!
- Was it Mom? - I don't know.<eos> I wasn't there.<eos> Nora saw her.<eos> - Tell him, Nora.<eos> - I already did.
No, thanks!<eos> No, thanks.<eos> Did you hear me ask,<eos> "Would you care for some pineapple?"<eos> No, you did not.
Oh my god, then she never has to hear it!<eos> Why would you not want her to hear it?<eos> Because I'm a human being who can experience shame?<eos> Look, I've been racking my brain trying to figure out a way to make this less awkward when I see her, and now I don't have to.<eos> Yes, you do!
You think because you got a... a lab in Baltimore and six planes with the cure that everything's in hand?<eos> The world is in chaos.<eos> There's a lot more to do.<eos> And that crew is trained to do it, with or without me. - They need you.<eos> - And they don't?
Son of a bitch.<eos> I need a cigarette.<eos> Come on.<eos> Since when did you start smoking, Dr. O'Connor?<eos> I didn't.
You're with him!<eos> I knew that you were back then.<eos> But it ended.<eos> You told me it ended.<eos> - It did.
Oh, no need to apologize. I shouldn't have sprung it on you like that.<eos> Oh, no, no, no, no.<eos> It had just been a really emotional day.<eos> The big "I love Ben" announcement.<eos> And you really do, right?
Malory?<eos> Thoughts?<eos> You do not want to know my thoughts.<eos> I do, Ken.<eos> I much very do.
Yeah.<eos> Why didn't you say something before?<eos> It's not some tragedy.<eos> And calculus is hard.<eos> Conor does shitty all the time.
- When does Napier land?<eos> - An hour.<eos> I'm very worried about this.<eos> I hardly ever have business on this side - of the building anymore.<eos> - Well, you do today.
You better get used to me.<eos> What else?<eos> Well, yesterday I met a man, brown hair, short, seems to be in charge of running numbers.<eos> Got a name?<eos> Matter of fact I do.
And hurry, my shift starts in ten minutes.<eos> Sorry.<eos> So how long has that thing between you and Scotty been going on?<eos> What the fuck do you care?<eos> I don't, really.
Maybe you just don't want to take responsibility for her anymore.<eos> 'Cause I don't agree with you?<eos> No, because we fucked her up, and you just don't want to admit it.<eos> Helen, don't you have any memory of how you were at her age?<eos> Yeah, I do.
- I'll go get it right now.<eos> - No, it's closed.<eos> Noah, do you want to listen to your baby's heartbeat?<eos> Do you even want this baby?<eos> Of course I do.
Anyway, stick with me here, little outside the box.<eos> As Alison, Sasha Grey.<eos> How hot would that be?<eos> You know who she is, right?<eos> No, you don't.
At the end of the day, he'll call it like he sees it.<eos> Well, perhaps my route has some practical applications that are escaping you at the moment.<eos> Not long ago, I received a telegram from you inquiring about the Hatchites.<eos> I responded that I didn't know their location.<eos> I did.
No, no, no...<eos> The whole time you've been saying no, you've been nodding yes.<eos> I... I don't like Jack?<eos> I... I don't like Jack.<eos> I... I don't.
Are you on something, or...<eos> No, I'm not on anything, I'm just--<eos> I'm just-- What you're saying<eos> - makes me happy.<eos> - It does? It does.
You can't do that.<eos> - You can't just walk back in.<eos> - Please, just listen.<eos> I get it, OK?<eos> I didn't before, but I do now.
Look at Leo.<eos> He'll die, too.<eos> You were made for him.<eos> - He didn't want me.<eos> - He does now.
He wants Beatrice.<eos> I'm not her.<eos> No, you're not.<eos> She didn't have a choice.<eos> You do.
You were the last one in the tunnel today.<eos> Yes.<eos> That special book, the one on my desk, you didn't see it, did you?<eos> No, mother, I'm sorry.<eos> I didn't.
There's a thing inside you.<eos> Your cure will come with the number three.<eos> I didn't know where you were.<eos> You knew I'd be back.<eos> No, I didn't.
Where are you going?<eos> Well, I have to get you a ring.<eos> I already have one.<eos> You need one for you.<eos> I do?
Well, I have to get you a ring.<eos> I already have one.<eos> You need one for you.<eos> I do?<eos> You do.
The hearings are in three days.<eos> Well, I think I can come up with something if...you both want me involved.<eos> No, no, this is -- this is not your problem. Wait a minute.<eos> Dennis tells me you have one of the trickiest and most devious minds he's worked with.<eos> He did, did he?
God, yeah, I... I imagine that's a pretty lonely life.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, no, I... I imagine it is.<eos> Women... women seem to trust you.<eos> They do?
♪ Am I beautiful ♪ - Clear.<eos> - ♪ Even at my ugliest, you always say ♪<eos> We found Rentman's tree house, uh, a bunker under, uh...<eos> Who knows?<eos> I do.
Just one game.<eos> How about that shower now?<eos> Okay.<eos> I see you.<eos> Yeah, I do.
You're in my wheelhouse.<eos> I know you from somewhere.<eos> My name is Jamie Nelson.<eos> You defended Rick Allen grace.<eos> Yes, I did.
No, not since Walt was killed.<eos> She says she saw him a week and a half ago, made him dinner, everything seemed normal.<eos> I mean, Terry, Kaleb and Walt liked each other, you know?<eos> Did you ever hear about them ever having problems?<eos> No, I really didn't.
Come on, man.<eos> What?<eos> I said, "come on, man." It don't got to be like this, man.<eos> What?<eos> What the hell you doing, man?
But should we head back and truffle up our dinner?<eos> We could, or... I know a fantastic hot spring about 15 minutes up the road.<eos> We could hike.<eos> Oh, well, we don't have our bathing suits.<eos> Neither did Adam and Eve.
You both may go.<eos> I need to speak with your high priest.<eos> And the lesson is, don't play politics unless you're good at it.<eos> This coin... It has two heads.<eos> It does, doesn't it?
Medicine?<eos> Those are the kinds of things an army needs.<eos> Yeah, for an invasion.<eos> We have to stop it.<eos> Yeah, of course we do.
The same day Jay Butler disappeared.<eos> Did you know that because of all the pollution, the bass are changing sexes,<eos> - Oh. It's about time.<eos> - You did not know that.<eos> - Yes, I did.
- Oh, it's from Winston. - Hmm.<eos> "I'd ri..." Oh, Winston's the naughty.<eos> Yeah.<eos> - God, I love cowboys.<eos> - Who doesn't?
Yes.<eos> Yes, it is.<eos> And Dr. Moore is quite engaging.<eos> We used to enjoy the occasional anthropology lecture, didn't we?<eos> We did.
There was a meeting ... me, Maura, Mom.<eos> And Mom has decided that she should move in with me so that you can live with Maura.<eos> That works.<eos> - No, no, no!<eos> It does not!
What you say cannot fit in this room.<eos> When I was 14, my best friend, uh, Carice Jaquard... she lived next door.<eos> And one day, she didn't show up for school.<eos> So on my way home, I thought I would stop by, see if she wanted to know what the homework was.<eos> Mnh, she didn't.
Up until then, he was...<eos> He broke my heart.<eos> Oh, Maura.<eos> So he... begged me not to say anything.<eos> I didn't, to anyone.
And all three of Duke's rivals are gonna be there.<eos> We slip backstage using Duke and catch them off guard in their own turf? - Mm-hmm.<eos> - Hey.<eos> Want to go undercover?<eos> Yes, he does.
- I really liked that big guy.<eos> - Well, maybe it's time to get one like him.<eos> Oh, Kiki got ruled by a Rottweiler when she was a little kid.<eos> She doesn't like big dogs.<eos> - Yeah, but you do.
- Well, maybe it's time to get one like him.<eos> Oh, Kiki got ruled by a Rottweiler when she was a little kid.<eos> She doesn't like big dogs.<eos> - Yeah, but you do.<eos> - I do.
- It's not.<eos> - Yes, it is.<eos> Because you've been left alone, unsupervised with way too much free time, for far too long.<eos> - I don't need to be supervised.<eos> - Clearly you do.
She's not bad really, Gerald.<eos> Got a bit of a temper - watch out for the right hook.<eos> - Chump.<eos> - Really, I hope you find happiness.<eos> I really do.
You're not wearing shoes.<eos> Where are you shoes, Nick?<eos> Honestly, I threw 'em at a squirrel.<eos> - Everybody's waiting for you. - I can't go into the bar.<eos> I don't shoes on.
We should go.<eos> - I'm gonna take you to the clinic, okay?<eos> - Okay.<eos> You see that flower in there?<eos> Yeah, I did.
Sorry, it just popped out.<eos> You also said I was a cheater, for the record.<eos> And a lot of people think<eos> Dr. L and I do have a very palpable chemistry.<eos> No, they don't.
They can be very tedious.<eos> Mindy... uh, meet my girlfriend, Grace.<eos> Did I not say "girlfriend" earlier?<eos> No, you didn't.<eos> But I didn't either.
Okay, first question.<eos> Let's start with the personal...<eos> Alicia? Your law partner recently pleaded guilty to a drug charge.<eos> Mr. Prady, do you have a question for Alicia about this?<eos> I do.
Staying there. Shaw is Winthrop's partner.<eos> So, you worked with my dad in Seattle?<eos> - That's right.<eos> - Then you must know Julie Finlay, too.<eos> Yeah, I do.
But that's not why you asked me here.<eos> No.<eos> I thought we should talk about the campaign mixer and... you know...<eos> You know?<eos> No, I don't.
I'm safe.<eos> No one needs to know.<eos> This is a business relationship.<eos> If this has become something else in your head... maybe you're grasping at something you never had.<eos> I did, though, didn't I?
How?<eos> On what?<eos> I don't know, but we cannot take that with us Until we know more about it.<eos> How do we know it'll work on the espheni?<eos> - We don't.
You think the same applies for us?<eos> Maybe.<eos> When this thing snatched our new formula Back into its capsule, It suddenly became non-lethal.<eos> How do we know this does not disrupt the ingredient Lethal to the espheni?<eos> We don't, not yet.
Anything for friends.<eos> Your mother's rocking the baby, humming "Chattanooga Choo Choo"...<eos> Honey, Lisa lapped up every last drop of that ice cream--<eos> Did you know she was going to do that tonight, throw Bill at me in that way?<eos> You did.
Or you would have stayed.<eos> But-- but I'm alone.<eos> I am all alone.<eos> I don't know what to do now.<eos> I don't...
I wasn't looking for a solution.<eos> - I was looking for an answer.<eos> - To what? Whether or not it could be done...<eos> Whether I could do it-- we could do it.<eos> And we did.
This is Nora Everett.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I can't seem to find your file, Miss Everett.<eos> Do you... do you remember what year you participated in the study?<eos> I didn't.
Well, so happy that you're enjoying your time as a tourist, but starting tomorrow, I need you back in your business suits.<eos> We are beginning the next phase of scent research.<eos> We don't have another round of scent research.<eos> No.<eos> We do.
Take whatever route you'd like"?<eos> The man drove us through Brooklyn, Bill.<eos> Ah, so what if he did?<eos> It was worth the extra $2 to get a view of that skyline, don't you think?<eos> No, I don't.
- Oh, why's that?<eos> Surely she would like a trip to New York, wouldn't she?<eos> Yes, but we do have three children at home.<eos> Do you have pictures?<eos> I don't, no.
- if that's what you prefer.<eos> - Do not threaten me, sir.<eos> - Johnny, I need you to go to y--<eos> - I'm sorry. It's okay. It's okay.<eos> You didn't do anything wrong.
Danny told me. He-- he told you...<eos> He always tells me.<eos> We've been through this before.<eos> Did you think you were different?<eos> They all do.
Just the check, thank you.<eos> Right away, monsieur.<eos> So, I have to ask.<eos> How exactly did you expect things to go tonight?<eos> Just the way they did.
I need to show you something that could be a problem.<eos> Morning Joe did the exact same story I produced for the health segment tonight. Read it.<eos> - That is odd.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> MSNBC did your fecal impaction story.
Walter, I have a question for you.<eos> When you shave your head, do you use a straight razor or clippers?<eos> 'Cause I tried using a straight razor and I took big chunks out of my scalp and there was blood everywhere.<eos> But when I look at your scalp, I don't see any nicks or cuts.<eos> So how do you do that?
- Okay. - Fuck.<eos> Hello, Officer.<eos> Just having a little seat belt problem.<eos> You didn't see that red light, sir?<eos> Yes, I did.
I really appreciate you rearranging your day like this. - I know it's a pain. - Hey.<eos> Comes with the territory when you are married to a real superhero.<eos> I'll make it up to you tonight.<eos> - I promise.<eos> - You always do.
The business of my happiness.<eos> Now get out.<eos> Oh, you're here to find The Author, aren't you?<eos> So she told you.<eos> Of course she did.
Tell me... who are we?<eos> You're my parents.<eos> I'm the product of your true love.<eos> You taught me how to be a hero, you taught me how to believe in hope.<eos> And I do.
I see him.<eos> I hear-- i hear his voice.<eos> He was my brother, above all else.<eos> And i loved him.<eos> So did i.
It seems an age ago, that night in the alley When you came to my aid.<eos> Thank you for being a trusted friend.<eos> A loyal servant.<eos> What i did not know that night Is that you did not need my aid.<eos> Yes, i did, as i do now.
Now, are there any stupid questions?<eos> Okay. So, you showed me some things.<eos> I wanna bust Royalle as much as you. But Wolfe is evil.<eos> - Do you believe in evil?<eos> - Yes, I do.
Okay.<eos> Really late, if this thing that I have been trying to make happen actually..., uh..., you know, happens.<eos> Okay.<eos> Whatever you think about my job, it is the only thing that is keeping a roof over our heads right now.<eos> And when Zora does well, hon', we do well.
She was.<eos> Something more developed?<eos> Alex, I'm so sorry.<eos> I didn't know.<eos> - Son, we really didn't. - Just...
If you knew about me, you woulda taken care of me.<eos> And Jude.<eos> I know that.<eos> And it's not that I don't love you.<eos> I do.
It's your lawyer.<eos> Oh, well, that was quite an afternoon, wasn't it?<eos> Yeah...<eos> I just hope you know that everything that Robert does, he does out of love for you.<eos> I do.
An FBI agent?<eos> Said the FBI was looking for two fugitives who escaped Cumberland the night before.<eos> If something happened to Eugene, it's got to be one of them. Don't you think?<eos> This agent he spoke with... is there any chance your husband got a name?<eos> He did better than that.
Her heart's in the right place.<eos> So, what was he upset for?<eos> I thought he never wanted it.<eos> Well, no.<eos> He didn't.
Her date. On Valentine's Day.<eos> It weren't a date as such.<eos> It were him.<eos> How long did it go on?<eos> It didn't.
What we need here are some back-channel negotiations.<eos> I think we need front-channel negotiations.<eos> You should go to Texas and meet with your former boss.<eos> Should we order some dessert? I hope they still have that strawberry savarin.<eos> And they do!
But we can put it somewhere.<eos> If we touch anything, that's tampering with the evidence.<eos> Evidence that could convict Ali. And me.<eos> And I don't have a good alibi.<eos> Yes, you do.
Hanna, these pageants aren't just about being pretty anymore.<eos> Pretty isn't the point.<eos> Judges don't give out crowns to living lollipops.<eos> You need to have an opinion about the world we live in.<eos> I do.
I can't be sitting in Spanish conjugating verbs.<eos> I really need to talk to Cyrus.<eos> You think we're going to find "A" through Cyrus?<eos> You're lucky if you can even find Cyrus.<eos> I already did.
Maybe not, sir.<eos> Look, let me work on something.<eos> I'll get back to you.<eos> How long do we wait?<eos> We don't.
I was wondering if you might find the time to meet with me.<eos> I have an urgent matter to discuss.<eos> Okay, what is it? It'd be better to talk about that in person.<eos> Well, you know, I'm in the middle of a shift, um... and you didn't mention your name.<eos> No, I didn't.
[Whispers] I don't know.<eos> [Whispers] Oh! That sounded like the word for "the."<eos> This is madness.<eos> You know what'll impress mom and get us up on the fridge?<eos> - No, obviously I don't!
So you're not the least bit jealous?<eos> I'm not the jealous type.<eos> That's not what she told us.<eos> She said that you were possessive and controlling.<eos> She did?
Croissy, perhaps?<eos> A committed Anglophile, even rumored to like the food!<eos> Henriette will go.<eos> Your pardon, Sire, did you say ...?<eos> Indeed I did.
And then when I got there she told me there was no point me being there if her mother wasn't.<eos> So.<eos> ~ She said that?<eos> ~ Did she?<eos> ~ Caroline did?
Because... yesterday morning, before you turned up... .. he asked me to marry him.<eos> And then, God knows how many hours later, I'm in bed with you.<eos> Because I'm stupid and flaky and I'm fed up of being those things!<eos> ~ You don't want to marry him.<eos> ~ Don't I?
~ Don't I?<eos> I asked you to marry me.<eos> More or less.<eos> Well, what if I did want to marry him?<eos> ~ What if I do?
I asked you to marry me.<eos> More or less.<eos> Well, what if I did want to marry him?<eos> ~ What if I do?<eos> ~ You don't.
More or less.<eos> Well, what if I did want to marry him?<eos> ~ What if I do?<eos> ~ You don't.<eos> I do.
Well, what if I did want to marry him?<eos> ~ What if I do?<eos> ~ You don't.<eos> I do.<eos> I do, actually.
♪I don't want it if ya gonna throw it up in my face♪<eos> I wouldn't believe everything that I read.<eos> I saw that you were a devoted husband and father.<eos> Did you hear about that injunction that Beretti slapped me with?<eos> I did.
I remember something like that.<eos> I don't... It might've slipped my mind.<eos> I read a magazine article and it called you "The future of empire."<eos> You believe that?<eos> 'Cause I do.
Answers.<eos> Dude, I'm not gonna buy a pot.<eos> We're not married.<eos> Mm-kay, you know what time it is?<eos> Because my hoodie does.
It was strange. He was distracted, paranoid. He kept looking around.<eos> Tried to talk to him about it, ask what was going on but he just changed the subject.<eos> I got to say, when I left, I was a little worried about the guy.<eos> He talk about seeing anyone else here?<eos> No, he didn't.
I watched Dede coddle Mitchell when he was afraid of the dark.<eos> Till he was seven, he'd only blink one eye at a time...<eos> Gave a lot of girls a very wrong idea.<eos> Manny, you don't want to do this right?<eos> No, I really don't.
Please, Jay, let that poor baby off the toilet.<eos> Okay, new plan... we leave him on the throne till he conks out, then we dunk his hand in a bowl of warm water...<eos> That's crazy.<eos> You know that you can't rush these things.<eos> You did it before with Claire and with Mitch.
I know.<eos> Right.<eos> You're not the only one that's been given a second chance.<eos> Look, I... I don't believe in that "destiny" crap,<eos> I-I just don't.
A gentleman.<eos> Wow.<eos> I think that's the first time that anyone has ever used the word "gentleman" to describe me.<eos> Well... that's 'cause they don't see you.<eos> But I do.
- It had a hole in it.<eos> I was soaked.<eos> So you have all the same memories?<eos> Yeah, Lucas and Lucy, they share the same neural programming.<eos> - They all do.
And from my seat, that's the best that you can do.<eos> Evil is still evil, General.<eos> Even when it's lesser.<eos> She thinks I killed her husband.<eos> Molly does.
So you enlist my ex-wife to manipulate me?<eos> Don't play that game, Molly.<eos> I'm not playing games.<eos> Now, you believe in that vision just as much as I do.<eos> What if I do?
I'm sorry?<eos> Forgive me, Jesus.<eos> And what is the nature of your sin?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Yes, you do.
Ah, yes, please.<eos> Hermann wore me out.<eos> Oh, he will do that to you.<eos> I don't think I have any, actually.<eos> - Oh, yes you do. - Oh.
Know what?<eos> I suggest you take a look at the original articles of 1783.<eos> Should either side be victor for ten successive years, they claim ownership of the land in perpetuity.<eos> ~ Did you know about this?<eos> ~ No, I didn't.
And we just didn't know it.<eos> We should be pirates, not farmers or watchers or judges.<eos> Connie.<eos> You don't even know who I am.<eos> Yes, I do.
We got our heads so far up our asses that, Rosie,<eos> Rosie, I don't recognize you.<eos> Hell, I don't recognize myself.<eos> But you, what, you think you're the only mother in the world?<eos> I do not.
Talk to me.<eos> I'm your best friend? That's interesting, because best friends don't sell each other out.<eos> What did I do wrong?<eos> You told Rosie that I have pictures of the slap.<eos> But you do.
You told Rosie that I have pictures of the slap.<eos> But you do.<eos> Yes, and I don't want to be brought into this.<eos> You sold me out. You never should have said that.<eos> But you do.
Because he thinks you stayed in town to help out, buy groceries.<eos> He thinks all you're doing is errands, not, you know, me.<eos> And have I been helpful with the groceries?<eos> If you know what I mean.<eos> Yes, I do.
This is a crime scene.<eos> I won't touch a thing.<eos> Your boyfriend has a lot of nerve.<eos> He's not my boyfriend.<eos> And yes, he does.
I'll give you a lift.<eos> Thanks, but I'll drive.<eos> The generators are Kryptonian-designed.<eos> They not only power the building, but provide a shield that makes it virtually impenetrable.<eos> My God, even the rumors about this place don't do it justice!
Everything's gonna be okay.<eos> I'm here, buddy.<eos> Thanks, Jack, you're my best friend.<eos> You want some more of that? - No.<eos> - He does.
These passages you quote, Agent Aubrey, they pale next to the real message that Jesus brought to us-- understanding, compassion and love.<eos> I am not God, Agent Aubrey.<eos> It's not for me to judge.<eos> I hope you're telling the truth, Pastor.<eos> I really do.
We can't let him get control of the Mind Stone!<eos> I still have more than enough power left to keep your pathetic team at bay!<eos> Hawkeye!<eos> My armor needs those things!<eos> Not as much as I do!
No!<eos> Yes. Midge "hey edie, "let's me and you blow pam's boyfriend arn<eos> Behind the goddamn grain elevator" olerud! You had a boyfriend named arn?<eos> Well, he didn't know I liked him, but--<eos> Midge and edie did.
Mm-kay.<eos> Ooh, and who also has a poopy diaper.<eos> [gasps] great bacchus plateau, It works!<eos> What?<eos> What does?
It happens.<eos> This was the whole reason for the hunting trips and the jet skis, trips to Bali and stuff.<eos> I said to her, "babe, if it's just gonna be us, let's make us an adventure."<eos> But she really wanted a baby.<eos> We both did.
Sylvia Swann was killed there last night.<eos> What?<eos> At the Stones?<eos> - You don't think...<eos> - No, I don't.
Now we slide.<eos> What?<eos> And the other two.<eos> How did you get out?<eos> The same way the killer did.
I began house-to-house enquiries, starting with Wenlock Dip, home of Sir Jeffrey Greensleeves.<eos> Our Justice of the Peace.<eos> - You know him?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Not as well as Sid does.
First of all, John Mayer said that.<eos> Gandhi said, "The British are coming," and that's how he got independence for India.<eos> Okay, I don't doubt you think that's true.<eos> Speaking of extraordinary Indian people, Mindy, I believe if you put your mind to it, you can have a fit pregnancy.<eos> - Oh, do you?
Yes.<eos> You had mentioned that you needed help with the encrypted files on your laptop.<eos> I did?<eos> You did.<eos> I did.
No, it's doodle.<eos> Gross, you took a dump on my floor?<eos> No, Brooke, it's your doodle.<eos> It's okay, it's totally normal. It happens to everyone.<eos> Not to me, it doesn't.
That bitch!<eos> Hey, there you are.<eos> I've been looking everywhere for you.<eos> Uh, it turns out the dress doesn't fit.<eos> None of this does.
He broke his collar bone and shattered his arm.<eos> His athletic career is shot.<eos> Scholarships gone.<eos> Did you see Jenny push him?<eos> No one did.
So you replaced me?<eos> It doesn't work that way. You can't replace a child, and I looked for you for years, but the foster records, they were incomplete.<eos> They were never, ever able to tell me where you were.<eos> You looked for me?<eos> Of course I did.
What'd you do?<eos> Nothing, but I have a plan to get Michelle back.<eos> We have to make her vulnerable.<eos> We have to take away her family.<eos> You already did that.
We did, and we found both those things.<eos> $1500 and an eighth of marijuana which coincidently was the exact amount that you bought from my friend Phillip last week.<eos> Imagine that?<eos> Phillip is a drugged-out liar.<eos> Well, I don't about that.
Only god knows what she's been through.<eos> You haven't been able to identify her yet?<eos> No, she doesn't match any of the other cases.<eos> I think I know who she is.<eos> You do?
I don't think you're treating them right.<eos> Now, they can't heal you, but they would heal you if they could.<eos> And if they could trade places with you, many of them would do that.<eos> Yeah...<eos> And do anything for you without any waver.
It's personal. I know.<eos> And... since they determined that it had nothing to do with the deaths and since nothing like that has ever happened again, then there's really... there's no reason<eos> I get it. for us to go get this...<eos> I get it.<eos> I do. I...
Why's that?<eos> He thinks Redmayne was in my column and then he wasn't.<eos> After he spoke to you.<eos> - That happens.<eos> - Yes, it does.
He always whistles when we're on jobs together, and when people's air conditioners are broke, the last thing they want to hear is some guy whistling.<eos> That's true.<eos> That totally makes sense.<eos> Darrin, I don't want to marry you.<eos> You don't?
What are you doing?<eos> If you can find me, so can he.<eos> You can't keep running.<eos> I don't have a choice.<eos> Yes, you do.
So this gives us the advantage, okay?<eos> Liam thinks that he is playing me, but in reality, I will be playing him.<eos> Look, just trust me, okay?<eos> Trust us.<eos> I do.
Really.<eos> It's fine.<eos> I'm fine.<eos> I just needed to know.<eos> And now I do.
Hard to bring up something I barely remember.<eos> I found a parking spot, but it was up on the hill.<eos> I'm good, babe.<eos> Jan, you know my sister-in-law Claire, right?<eos> No, I don't.
Now get out. My 2:30's here.<eos> Okay, pay attention, Darlene.<eos> Here is my cheerleading uniform, a comprehensive tutorial on how I like to wear my hair, my favorite lip gloss, shoes, and... oops!<eos> I accidentally put in two types of eyeliner, but since you're my mom, I'm sure you'll know which one I prefer to use.<eos> Of course I do, honey.
The pulling, how did you do that every day for two years?<eos> Are you ready?<eos> See you later, best friend.<eos> (Jenna) You want to know the best part about knowing who I was?<eos> That Matty did too.
Well, you should've made her cut the Microloans program.<eos> Dude, I begged her.<eos> Burke was just looking for a reason to humiliate your boss.<eos> She handed it to him.<eos> Former boss And, yes, she did.
I can't.<eos> She booby-trapped it.<eos> We open this, an alarm will notify her.<eos> We have no other way in.<eos> Actually, we do.
What? !<eos> Are you kidding?<eos> I need to get closure on this, Gwen.<eos> I don't expect you to understand.<eos> Good because I don't.
Not related at all.<eos> And you might have been wondering,<eos> "did I just see them kissing?<eos> Is that what was happening?"<eos> No, I didn't.
Bad day on the job, my dear?<eos> Half of England wants me gone.<eos> Only the Catholic half.<eos> Well, the rest don't want Mary, but they certainly wish I were a man.<eos> Of course they do, especially your privy council.
It'll be a pleasure.<eos> No problem. But first, we should take care of a little business.<eos> Oh, yeah, of course.<eos> So you said you had more pictures.<eos> - My client does.
♪ Those are just some of the guys ♪<eos> ♪ There are lots of other guys. ♪<eos> It was awful.<eos> I didn't even get to go to my high school prom.<eos> But my mom did.
Well, I believe shame is the worst thing a parent can teach their children.<eos> I want my children to be joyful and frank and adventurous.<eos> Like you.<eos> But if parenthood - is something that doesn't interest you...<eos> - No. It does, actually.
That was my yearbook quote.<eos> I just got hired at a new restaurant that's opening under the High Line Park in Manhattan, and they are looking for another day pastry chef.<eos> I only have a year of pastry school and I was stoned for, like, a year of that.<eos> I don't know if I have the skills.<eos> [chuckles] Oh, girl, you don't.
Well, drive it about.<eos> You can drive it on the road.<eos> ~ That goes on the road.<eos> ~ Yeah, but you can drive a tractor on the road<eos> ~ or one of those massive cranes that do 8mph.
Hey, at least your obsession with "Tank Battle" paid off.<eos> My coder monkeys said you came by, that your time-stamp fix was genius.<eos> Oh, yeah, yeah.<eos> I took a little break from work, so...<eos> Oh, sure, you did, sexy beard.
Take the week off.<eos> Need I remind you, Mr. Reese, his number has come up.<eos> Which means that his next target may escalate beyond any simple crime.<eos> Or one of his previous targets is coming back for revenge.<eos> - How you doing, boy?
Last month, they scanned all my devices. They're clean.<eos> I know.<eos> Which is why I didn't come to you right away.<eos> I wanted to confirm it.<eos> And I did.
That... could be a problem.<eos> I'm sorry, detective.<eos> I can't let you remove the astronauts.<eos> I don't have that kind of authority.<eos> - Well, then, who does?
Okay, did you call Lena?<eos> Yeah, she's not answering.<eos> It's okay.<eos> We'll find her.<eos> Jack, what if we don't?
What are you doing all the way out here?<eos> Did you hear our news?<eos> Did Peter tell you?<eos> Matthew and I are having a baby.<eos> No, he didn't.
Both phones went straight to voice mail.<eos> Danny told me that he was going off the grid. He wants to spend time with Amber. They turned their phones off.<eos> That explains why I can't ping their location.<eos> - He say where he was taking her?<eos> - No. No, he didn't.
Want to bet?<eos> Faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen.<eos> Whatever that means.<eos> So, you really believe that people rise from the dead?<eos> Yes, I do.
To me, the bar, the level I wanna reach as far as the shape I'm in, I just want it to be so that if you find out that I died, you ask "What happened?"<eos> That's all.<eos> I want you to wonder what happened.<eos> I don't want it to be like, "Oh, he died?"<eos> Oh, yeah, well, sure. Sure he did.
So I just sit there and listen to...<eos> And then she comes out.<eos> "I don't-I'm tired of this.<eos> I don't want to go anymore."<eos> Good, don't.
It's about the power...<eos> The power to make people believe anything you want.<eos> Ruining you was among his greatest accomplishments.<eos> So you want the world to hate me.<eos> Conrad did.
I don't mean to brag, but I really bring it with construction workers.<eos> I mean a man that you can marry and have kids with and have this for yourself.<eos> I don't want this.<eos> Okay.<eos> I don't.
Oh, you got to be kidding me.<eos> God...<eos> Guy gets stabbed; I thought we'd have at least a week of peace.<eos> Hey, Cap!<eos> How you doing?
"Or die."<eos> It's option B, baby.<eos> Your fondest wish come true.<eos> I don't want to die.<eos> Hey. Sure you do.
I do!<eos> I'm the one who has to spend all weekend doing paperwork because of your dumb stunt.<eos> But...<eos> Terry loves paperwork?<eos> - No, Jake, I do not.
And then mom expanded my vocabulary with her colorful collection of curse words.<eos> I'm glad I came.<eos> My God. Even with the windows down, I can still smell it.<eos> Sue, I thought you didn't bring your "poo-pourri."<eos> I didn't.
- We didn't know that.<eos> That's why Jews can't stand us Christians, that's why they killed Christ.<eos> And that's why I can't stand them.<eos> - Do you know what I do with pork-haters?<eos> - We don't.
- Me, having a Gypsy here?<eos> - Yes.<eos> I tell him I'm a nun and he takes off my habit...<eos> - I don't have any!<eos> - Yes, you do.
It's like oatmeal.<eos> It...<eos> Sustains you.<eos> Darlene, do you take lynn to be your lawfully wedded husband?<eos> I do.
Sustains you.<eos> Darlene, do you take lynn to be your lawfully wedded husband?<eos> I do.<eos> Lynn, do you take darlene to be your lawfully wedded wife?<eos> I do.
Yeah, I don't really understand it either.<eos> If you're serious, you just gotta go talk to her. I can't.<eos> I'm done putting myself out there.<eos> I'm done taking chances. What are you talking about?<eos> Done?
Adds a certain something to the room.<eos> Every wall needs nipples.<eos> So a guy knows where to look.<eos> Thank you for telling me to do this, Caroline.<eos> She did?
There was an early Votan race, one that predated the rest of us. One that called the shots for a very long time.<eos> Congratulations. You found yourselves an honest-to-goodness Omec.<eos> Omec?<eos> I've heard the name, but I heard they died out.<eos> Supposedly they did.
I had my suspicions.<eos> Why didn't you say anything.<eos> You didn't ask.<eos> I had no idea this technology even existed.<eos> It doesn't, officially.
They got in their shuttle, flew back to their ship, and they jumped.<eos> No.<eos> They wouldn't just leave me.<eos> [ROOK] They didn't have a choice.<eos> For the moment, at least, neither do you.
Why wait?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Maybe they weren't thinking straight, or Five scared them off, or maybe they have some other agenda.<eos> But how is this possible?<eos> We did a full top to bottom sweep.
Number Five, truth or dare?<eos> Truth.<eos> Number Five, does your vagina have teeth?<eos> That's insane.<eos> No, it doesn't, Chanel.
Well, I found this old talking board in the basement.<eos> Those things don't work! Yes, they do.<eos> Didn't you see the movie?<eos> The movie Ouija?<eos> No! No one did!
Why do you think the Devil let me live?<eos> I don't know.<eos> But I still think we should call the police. What will that do?<eos> I mean, all Denise is gonna do is arrest Zayday again.<eos> You guys didn't, um...
Killing Lieutenant Kutzler's first Medal of Honor nomination.<eos> I have no idea what you're talking about.<eos> The packet was routed through your chain of command in 2012, Admiral.<eos> Then it must have got lost in the shuffle before it reached my desk.<eos> Because it never did.
How are you keeping from getting pregnant then?<eos> Well, all shoots, they don't come inside you.<eos> Even if it looks like it on camera, they don't.<eos> They always do...<eos> They always do it on you, instead of in you.
- Mine was.<eos> It was just a "he came on my stomach" type thing.<eos> Today I did two cream pies, but all I did was just...<eos> I thought they gave you extra for that. Didn't they? -Yeah.<eos> Yeah, they did. Yeah.
What happened?<eos> Uh, Frank had a drinking problem.<eos> He got punchy with Karen, like literally, an argument ensued and ended up with Karen having her throat slashed and Frank with a bullet in his head.<eos> I am guessing they had a child?<eos> They did, indeed.
Hi, honey. (Joe) Have you met the new waiter?<eos> I love him. He's my favorite.<eos> If I did men, he would've been done by now.<eos> Hmm, so you think you're pretty.<eos> Well, I do too.
To get the nanny dismissed, to keep your hold on the king.<eos> I would like to say that.<eos> I would.<eos> I wanted catherine to suffer. I wanted henry to suffer.<eos> They did.
I would never hurt Emma.<eos> She was super generous.<eos> And she'd be super pissed if, after giving you a huge donation, she found out that you were full of it.<eos> Yeah, maybe you killed her to keep your cover from being blown.<eos> - I didn't.
- 9:00. You changed it to 10:00.<eos> - I never sent that.<eos> - Well, it's from your phone.<eos> - I never sent that.<eos> - Well, someone did.
- I never sent that.<eos> - Well, it's from your phone.<eos> - I never sent that.<eos> - Well, someone did.<eos> Yeah, someone did.
So, that bag is clothes. That bag is diapers.<eos> The cooler is breast milk,<eos> - which obviously needs to go in the...<eos> - Where do you buy breast milk?<eos> You don't, Archer. You...
- I'll find a sitter.<eos> Lana, relax.<eos> I won't drink while you're gone.<eos> - I take this very seriously.<eos> - Well, or at least Woodhouse does.
This was a good idea, Hunt... a master class in neurosurgery.<eos> This is gonna put Amelia Shepherd on the map. Mm.<eos> Unless it fails.<eos> It won't.<eos> If it does...
I'll send Cornelius to collect.<eos> We're to lavish money on Tiberius, the man who expelled thousands of our people from their homes in Rome on a whim?<eos> How far will you go to keep Rome happy?<eos> We don't have the money.<eos> We don't, no.
I don't want it to happen again.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> I'll keep her from harm.<eos> Your husband doesn't know about your faith?<eos> He does.
I can't believe you.<eos> This could be the end of the temple.<eos> How can you stand by and...<eos> How can you not want Jesus to return?<eos> I do.
This could be the end of the temple.<eos> How can you stand by and...<eos> How can you not want Jesus to return?<eos> I do.<eos> Of course I do.
I need help.<eos> Juliette.<eos> I didn't know you were here.<eos> You told them?<eos> No, I didn't.
So when Johnny OD'd on blow two years later...<eos> Which I warned you about.<eos> The "I don't want to die anonymous" verse of Sex Drugs became the fan base's mission statement.<eos> They didn't want you to die anonymous.<eos> Who does, right?
Come and sit down and talk to me.<eos> Have you heard from Violet?<eos> No.<eos> It don't matter.<eos> Course it does.
No, I'm not saying that.<eos> So you want to stay with mom? Yes.<eos> Does mom want to stay with you?<eos> I hope so, Grant.<eos> I really do.
I enjoyed the speech, Jim... and if you're ever on the lecture circuit,<eos> I'll be sure to get some tickets for me and my friends, but as for tonight, I'm getting kind of hungry.<eos> We have a deal or not?<eos> Nah.<eos> We do not.
And don't even try and tell me that those were hard-nosed Electro-City DA,<eos> Pamela Needlehoffer's lips kissing my lips, those were Katie's lips, A.K.A. your lips.<eos> The only reason that I said that I was acting was because you said you were acting first!<eos> - No, I didn't!<eos> - Yes, you did!
I-I took my vows barefoot in front of the earth goddess...<eos> So that I could be connected to the soil and everything cosmic.<eos> Do you still love him?<eos> [Scoffs] As if.<eos> Yes, you do!
I did not bet that bird, chuparlo.<eos> Yes, you did, mi General.<eos> 8 pesos.<eos> How is it you have 8 pesos to bet with?<eos> As a fact, I do, Excellency.
It's the mother lode... Santa Anna's treasure.<eos> You snakes weren't gonna tell me about it?<eos> Well, why should we?<eos> We found it.<eos> Lucky for me, so did I.
Expose his unholy affinity for savages.<eos> (Baker) Yes, he's the greatest curse that Providence in all its wrath has sent to our country.<eos> Sullied the reputation of countless women, abandoned two wives.<eos> If the people truly knew him as we do...<eos> But they do.
He bought a gun because he was terrified of her, And yet he went to visit her the day his wife went missing.<eos> Maybe sophie found out about them and tried to expose him.<eos> The problem is, If he's not behind the kidnapping, We don't have any other leads, an it's...<eos> Till the deadline. And we don't have any way to contact the kidnappers.<eos> Maybe we do.
Think of everything that happened that led us to this moment.<eos> Oh, see, that...<eos> I'd rather not.<eos> I know you don't want to talk about my relationship with Alan.<eos> No, I don't.
Where would I write my novel?<eos> You're writing a novel?<eos> Well, when I finish my screenplay.<eos> Do you not want to live with me?<eos> No, of course I do.
Warmer in the water.<eos> What was that?<eos> What was what?<eos> I just felt something. I don't know.<eos> I did, too.
- No.<eos> - Get it on your iPad?<eos> - No.<eos> Then how come you don't want it?<eos> Because I don't.
~ Crocodile's ear.<eos> ~ It's hairy.<eos> ~ Crocodiles do have hairy ears.<eos> They don't even have ears.<eos> They do.
You heard a voice in your head, and you left a newborn baby in a cold, empty car park.<eos> Church car park.<eos> You left me... at night... in the middle of winter.<eos> I could have died.<eos> But you didn't.
Yeah.<eos> But they'll heal.<eos> I am learning how to handle things.<eos> But how am I gonna know you're OK?<eos> You don't.
Yes, it is.<eos> Is this Alvin?<eos> Yes.<eos> I didn't know he wanted to be cremated.<eos> He didn't.
and he's got to be great in bed.<eos> But he's also sweet and someone I'd want to have my children with, someone I can trust.<eos> That's a tall order.<eos> Where you gonna find someone like that?<eos> I did it once.
Especially after last weekend when I went to see your dad upstate during his book tour.<eos> I have a feeling I'm not gonna want to hear too much more about it.<eos> Our time together is so special.<eos> Exhausting, really, if you know what I mean.<eos> We do, we do.
♪ For the first time in my life ♪ ♪ I see love ♪<eos> Hey, hon.<eos> Did you make a doctor's appointment?<eos> Put that down, and I'll tell you.<eos> No, I did not.
Maybe they went home, smoked a joint, watch Judge Judy and had a great time?<eos> ~ What do you want to do?<eos> ~ Do you mind if we don't talk about it any more?<eos> ~ It's not going to happen.<eos> ~ But if it did...
The new guidance counselor I was telling you about.<eos> She doesn't seem so bad.<eos> She's got everybody brainwashed about the SATs tomorrow.<eos> Did you decide whether or not you're taking them?<eos> - No, mom, I didn't.
- Joe is a fucking idiot.<eos> No, Joe's not a fucking idiot.<eos> Joe hired me to bring in big money players, protect the wealth, and capitalize on the success of men in a world that, with all due respect, Mr. Anderson, you don't know anything about with the exception of when you watch the Red Zone Channel<eos> Monetize my friendships is what Joe's been preaching to me from the moment I walked in the door, and I always thought that that came directly from you.<eos> Everything does except the bad shit.
Yeah, that's so not cool.<eos> Max, Caroline, we'll stop making the shirts.<eos> Ash, I never said that.<eos> Ah, no, Kemberly.<eos> I did.
You were out late.<eos> Hey.<eos> What's all this about?<eos> I just wanna say that I love you.<eos> Because I do.
McGee hasn't pinged my phone yet?<eos> Actually, boss, yeah, I-I did.<eos> Really?<eos> You didn't tell us? Well, I didn't know if he'd want me to.<eos> I don't.
About the birth?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I don't know.<eos> It's about Alex?<eos> I don't...
What?<eos> Chavez has an exemplary record with the Bureau.<eos> Five years ago, she was given the FBI Award for Meritorious Achievement.<eos> Got an address?<eos> I do.
We're going to need fire.<eos> Dude. You need to answer your phone.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> I just... I came to see if, you know, you needed any help.<eos> No, I don't.
How many was it?<eos> ~ 14 of them.<eos> ~ 14?<eos> ~ Don't pretend you didn't know!<eos> No, I-I didn't really, actually.
We need a break. - Martha--<eos> - No, um...<eos> I can't take it.<eos> Everyone at work knows that I'm lying.<eos> - No, no, they don't.
So, when you couldn't get at me... you went after the thing I loved.<eos> Oh, come on, Walt.<eos> Martha had cancer.<eos> She was already dead.<eos> Now, what did I do?
- Walt!<eos> - Ferg.<eos> That's nice.<eos> Where'd you buy this from?<eos> I didn't.
I was on duty.<eos> I, uh, heard over the radio that a kid had just shoplifted a cellphone from a store on Ambrose Street I'm driving on.<eos> About 10 seconds later, I see him walking.<eos> How do you know it's the same kid?<eos> I don't, of course, not at first.
I think that's maybe something that Carter should know.<eos> I'm just wondering why you never told me about what happened to your mom.<eos> I'm sorry I didn't tell you, but it wasn't because I didn't trust you.<eos> - I don't want you to think that.<eos> - No, I don't.
Yeah, that would be good.<eos> Max and Taylor?<eos> I'm behind.<eos> Last I heard, Max and Taylor were way over and Ofe had it bad for Taylor.<eos> He did, but, yeah,
Yeah.<eos> When?<eos> I don't know, soon.<eos> Sorry, I... didn't mean to make you feel guilty.<eos> Well, you did.
But wait a minute!<eos> Love to, can't, got a pussy to break.<eos> Well, that backfired.<eos> Or did it?<eos> Yes, yes, it most certainly did.
I'm sure Mom and Dad would like to see you, too, if you want to make the drive over there.<eos> You really want me to come?<eos> You're not just saying that?<eos> Don't be stupid.<eos> Of course I do.
Excellent.<eos> It's getting harder and harder to maintain my sunny disposition, Smithers.<eos> Oh, you're always my ray of...<eos> Shut up.<eos> Dad, what does that do?
Wow, Africa.<eos> I had a good friend who really wanted to go there.<eos> So, uh, you speak English there?<eos> I speak five languages.<eos> Nobody does.
It's in the writing. Mm-hmm.<eos> I've come across this character... brilliant man, handsome. I mean, almost beautiful.<eos> Uh, born in England, studied at Oxford.<eos> As did I.<eos> No, you didn't.
Be a cop, get married and be a dad.<eos> Yup, that's why I love you. You're a simple man with simple needs who's simply adorable.<eos> Carl, Molly doesn't want to have kids anymore.<eos> Wait, what?<eos> Of course she does.
Okay?<eos> We're in this together.<eos> Yeah, but what if we can't have a baby?<eos> I just need to know that you want to.<eos> I really do. Okay!
~ Happy birthday.<eos> SHARON SQUEALS<eos> Wow. I haven't had a birthday gift in a few years, you know, that...<eos> I can open, with paper and all that, so, I don't even care what's in here.<eos> Aw. Actually I do.
Hey!<eos> - Hey, Buster!<eos> Get your hand out of there.<eos> What'd I tell you about eating other people's food, huh?<eos> How you doing?
Well, that's okay.<eos> You don't have to talk.<eos> You can just listen.<eos> Yeah, we know that... you're not the shooter.<eos> Of course you do.
Not talking about it.<eos> I'm focusing on my future.<eos> Tomorrow, I will make a lasting second impression via my lifelong passion for baton.<eos> You don't have a lifelong passion for baton.<eos> Uh, yeah, Amy, I do.
A sexually confused girl who... wants to go to college.<eos> So you're not a lesbian either.<eos> I don't know.<eos> I'm sorry I don't have everything figured out<eos> - like you do.
Told you last time I saw you I'd get out of the slammer.<eos> We need to know how to remove the Mark of Cain from Dean's arm.<eos> He's gone nuclear!<eos> Who knew the Mark was so toxic?<eos> Actually, I did.
- What are you talking about?<eos> Your dead pledge, Caroline, her mommy was your pledge master back in the day.<eos> - Treated you like crap, I'm guessing.<eos> - I don't recall.<eos> Oh, of course you do.
Tactical error on my part.<eos> Which we will be discussing later at length.<eos> - Yes, sir.<eos> - However, at the moment, if that's true, we don't know how to get to the heart.<eos> No, but with Ariel, Prospero does.
And then what, huh?<eos> Jenkins?<eos> Tell me you got a plan "B."<eos> Yes, uh, Mr. Stone.<eos> I do.
A-and I remember Charlene.<eos> Funny and tough and loving Charlene.<eos> Do you, uh...<eos> Do you remember me?<eos> Of course I do, Flynn.
Spells, witches, ghosts.<eos> I fought a tentacle monster.<eos> It's a weird gig.<eos> How do you use it? This magic?<eos> We don't.
Stop, stop, stop, stop.<eos> We said we were doing this.<eos> We have to see it through.<eos> I don't know why I feel this way.<eos> - We just do.
Not visible until this very moment.<eos> Sound familiar?<eos> "Jenkins, the key is in your Guardian's name."<eos> You don't have a Guardian.<eos> Of course I do.
- I read about it on a blog. - Oh.<eos> I like having a boyfriend who tries new places.<eos> Oh, your place looks great.<eos> You must have one hell of a decorator.<eos> I did.
- If they had guns, they'd be using them.<eos> - Did you hear me? We have to get to the armory before they do.<eos> If we keep moving, this might work.<eos> You don't have to kill people.<eos> - Of course we do.
All that cash.<eos> All that cash?<eos> That's what you remember?<eos> So about that thing. I went to see a guy, um, who I thought might know something about Warner's murder.<eos> - And did he?
We've spent two of our five days on it, and we still don't have a name, so we think it's time to consider--<eos> What?<eos> Going after Forstman for whatever he did to you 12 years ago.<eos> - You told her?<eos> - Yes, I did.
I don't date much.<eos> I was involved with an agent in the office a couple of years ago-- Chris Amador.<eos> Yes.<eos> I think I was more involved with him than he was with me. But I'm sure you know what happened with Agent Amador.<eos> I do.
Maybe I died.<eos> He doesn't know. Or maybe I... abandoned him.<eos> He doesn't know.<eos> I lived most of my life here, Nina, but I never knew anyone who would do something like this.<eos> I did.
- He was shot twice in the back.<eos> That could be very traumatic for you.<eos> I'm a rip-the-band-aid-off fast kind of girl. I can handle it.<eos> You need time to adjust.<eos> You do, I don't.
When you're in a stitch, and you're waltzing around some dead person's memory, it is my job to keep you safe.<eos> I know what I signed up for and I know all the risks.<eos> All the risks?<eos> No.<eos> You don't.
Had dinner with Chief Tiberg st night.<eos> Is that right?<eos> Yeah, our kids do Tae Kwan Do together.<eos> He said... said you came to see him.<eos> I did, yeah.
Sure he does that here.<eos> He'll come out of the closet when he's good and ready.<eos> To be honest Deb, we have tried stuff.<eos> Books, and watching Dr. Bill.<eos> We even did a mediation thing with the priest.
Michael Jackson.<eos> Modern.<eos> Anyway, I hope you consider me worthy of... "Danse Haus." Yah!<eos> Oh, shit, I totally forgot to press record.<eos> Oh, no, you... you did, really?
Well, that's very inspiring, senator Ross.<eos> But the truth is, if confirmed, you will be one horrible tragedy away from the presidency.<eos> With your lack of experience, how do I know that you're prepared to protect us against Russia or the North Koreans?<eos> Simple.<eos> You don't.
I didn't tell her that, but she's right.<eos> I want to be Cyrus Beene's husband, and I want to be a journalist, but I don't want to be "Cyrus Beene's husband, the journalist."<eos> I want to be married to you, but I don't want anyone to think that I'm your lapdog.<eos> - Does that make sense?<eos> - Of course it does.
Well, then why did you tell me about it in the first place?<eos> Because I wanted you to tell me not to take the job because I'm your daughter!<eos> You know, the thing behind the mirror that you... trim your nose hairs with?<eos> Don't you even care if I stay or go?<eos> Of course I do.
You said, "the streak is alive."<eos> No!<eos> No, I said, "freak."<eos> I said, "the freak is alive."<eos> No, you didn't.
I don't want to know.<eos> Bottom line... you're on tink time now.<eos> And that means no smoking, no texting, no sexting, no mexting...<eos> Yeah, that's Mexican texting, where you write stuff in Spanish so you think I won't understand.<eos> But yo do.
She's convinced that she's being watched.<eos> It was about the break-in?<eos> Nice outfit, Soto.<eos> Liked it better when you wore it yesterday.<eos> Oh, I did?
Yeah, guys, mind your own business and finish your homework, will you?<eos> Come on.<eos> We haven't been out in months. What do you say?<eos> Do I really have a choice?<eos> No, you do not.
- Hey, Moose.<eos> Sorry to interrupt your lunch.<eos> Who's this guy you're bringing down here?<eos> We work together.<eos> - We never done it like this before, Vince.
My Uncle's pissed at you, Vince.<eos> First you arrest Sergio and then you threaten to arrest him?<eos> Well, he was breaking the law. Very funny.<eos> Look, I love your Uncle, but he's always trying to slip shit past us, and very often he succeeds.<eos> This time, he didn't.
(sighs) Marge, do you ever worry that you made a giant mistake in your life?<eos> Oh, um... I need a little context.<eos> Not drinking beer has given me the clearness of mind to realize drinking beer is bad.<eos> I've got to undo what I've done.<eos> Hey, how you doing?
I mean, what if this is the beginning of the end?<eos> roommates in college and... and houses next door to each other.<eos> Best friends forever.<eos> Don't you want that anymore?<eos> Yeah, I do.
roommates in college and... and houses next door to each other.<eos> Best friends forever.<eos> Don't you want that anymore?<eos> Yeah, I do.<eos> Of course I do.
Could... could I use your phone?<eos> I... I saw that your light's on.<eos> You know, I'm sure you're busy, but, uh, if you wouldn't mind, it would just take a minute.<eos> Don't you have a... a cell phone?<eos> I do, but I...
I'm a criminal.<eos> Criminals are notorious liars.<eos> Everything about me is a lie.<eos> You must have known how strange all of this was.<eos> Of course I did.
Breakfast for dinner.<eos> My favorite.<eos> So, um, mom, I have something for you.<eos> Oh, do you guys hear something?<eos> 'Cause I don't.
I want to go on a copper-mine tour.<eos> I-I don't think they have that here.<eos> Hayley, everywhere I've ever vacationed has a copper-mine tour -- New Mexico, Utah, Nebraska.<eos> You're telling me that all those places have something that the so-called<eos> "greatest city in the world" doesn't?
- I reserved them!<eos> - Yes, I am sorry for it, sir.<eos> Oh, it is no matter.<eos> Do you have anything upon the nature of clouds, rain, atmospheres?<eos> Yes, sir. Yes, I do, as a matter of fact.
Oleg, the people at Table Two want to know what's in the veggie burger. No.<eos> They don't.
You need to get to zhulov and talk to him.<eos> Zhulov hasn't said a word since we took him down.<eos> As I recall, he told me to screw myself forever.<eos> Because you never had any leverage over him.<eos> Now, with his connection to Christoph, you do.
I bet you escaped, and now Flanders is worried sick.<eos> I should call him... after I scratch your tummy!<eos> That's right!<eos> Who likes their tummy scratched while Flanders is worried sick?<eos> You do!
Photosynthesis.<eos> Uh, Robert E. Lee.<eos> Miss Hoover, are you teaching or are you just saying anything that comes into your head?<eos> Miss Hoover, please report to the main office.<eos> You just did that in your hand!
Is that, like, the name of the main guy, like Tommy?<eos> An Gorta Mor is Gaelic for "the great hunger."<eos> - You want to hear it?<eos> - Now? No, you don't want to hear it.<eos> No, no, I do.
So do I.<eos> And Iris here is the key.<eos> Nobody gets closer to The Countess than she does.<eos> You did.<eos> We both did.
Your mama is the sick one.<eos> Only room for one in the family.<eos> Daddy, let me drive you over to see Dr. Sammy tomorrow.<eos> I can drive myself if I want to go.<eos> And I don't.
I don't need a judge to tell me whether someone's guilty or not.<eos> I know.<eos> I believe you, John.<eos> If they took the leash off me, crime would drop in this city.<eos> I truly do.
Like I was punishing the man who stole my boy.<eos> But you tried to kill yourself.<eos> Because I loved it.<eos> I loved it more than anything I've ever experienced in my life.<eos> Of course you did.
Well, isn't a good reporter supposed to, like, never reveal her sources?<eos> Even when said source decided to go all '80s and do blow at an event where I was working, and then have the nerve to get angry at me<eos> - for being pissed? ! - Okay.<eos> First, why don't we step away from the knife?<eos> Okay, the strawberries didn't do anything to you.
You know, Stiles, I came back here for Scott but I also came back for you.<eos> Someone like you.<eos> Someone who's willing to walk into the woods in the middle of the night to protect his friends.<eos> I don't have anyone like that, but Scott does.<eos> You all do.
Your hands, your feet, even just the tips of your fingers.<eos> Imagine them moving.<eos> See it in your mind and your body will follow.<eos> Sure you know where you're going? I know where I am.<eos> So do I. Middle of nowhere.
I go down on a guy I like to decide whether or not I want to sleep with him.<eos> Like, I'll do it, like, two or three times to keep him interested, and, you know...<eos> It's my system.<eos> Okay... you have a system?<eos> Yeah, of course I do.
I think she knows something.<eos> I want you there when she wakes.<eos> I want you to hear it.<eos> Happily.<eos> If she does.
That it will be all right.<eos> That the Doctor will save us.<eos> And when you say it, do you believe it?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, I do.
You kissed another woman and enjoyed her ample breasts.<eos> Yeah, I did, didn't I?<eos> You know what?<eos> I've changed my mind. I think I want to do this.<eos> No, no, no, you don't.
I'm sure.<eos> Do we... do we have to sh... share it or...<eos> I'll just hold it.<eos> I can walk!<eos> Good. Do it.
He's got a lot of pressure in his lung.<eos> If I don't release it, he could die.<eos> Can you release it?<eos> If I find the spot between his second and third rib.<eos> - And if you don't?
I bought him as a pet for Wally.<eos> Seems sensible.<eos> So when did you find Wally was missing?<eos> I didn't.<eos> My vet, Mr Hewitt, did.
I would just run away and go hide somewhere.<eos> Did your dad do anything to make up for the disappearance of your mother in your life?<eos> Did he say, "Well, now I'm going to come home more frequently"<eos> or "I'm going to change..."? He never said that.<eos> And he did not.

Toilet wine-- a lovely mixture of moldy bread, rotted fruit, and ketchup.<eos> Ketchup makes it a rosé.<eos> And, of course, heroin, smuggled via somebody's boyfriend's poop chute.<eos> In either case, you really gotta want it.<eos> And I did.
You kill me, and you'll only destroy yourself.<eos> The evidence I have against you...<eos> Will disappear, just like it did 25 years ago.<eos> You have nothing to substantiate any of this.<eos> Actually, we do.
Calling out to the Mark.<eos> I can hear it like it's alive.<eos> It wants me to use it, but not for good.?<eos> Look, I wanted it to be the answer, too, okay?<eos> I really did.
I'll issue my ruling in the morning.<eos> Die Entrechteten.<eos> Really, Aram. These misanthropes have been on my radar for years.<eos> The FBI must have some kind of file.<eos> No. We do.
I'm her boss, Trent Culpepper. Oh!<eos> Mr. Culpepper.<eos> Ha. This is my mother...<eos> Natalia. She doesn't speak English.<eos> I do, too.
Uh, no, I just can't believe what I'm looking at.<eos> - That bad, huh? - No, no, no.<eos> I just mean I can't believe that you carried your guy in on this leg.<eos> I didn't have a choice.<eos> No, of course you didn't.
If your mother knew you were in my bed, she would not be happy.<eos> A fact of which you, Claude... are well aware.<eos> Does this technique typically work for you?<eos> Pursuing a man who has already politely declined?<eos> Of course it does.
Love connections happening, y'all!<eos> Look, I don't know if I can do this.<eos> I mean, Charles seems great, honestly, but I haven't dated in a coon's age.<eos> I mean, last time I went on a date, people still said "coon's age".<eos> Yeah, they don't any more.
Cos that's what a sane man does in the middle of the night, isn't it? - You think she's sane?<eos> - According to you mate, she's fine.<eos> A little forgetful, but, other than that, fine.<eos> She actually said that she thought it was a body?<eos> Yes, she did.
Did something happen?<eos> No.<eos> Hi, Claes.<eos> - Do you know her?<eos> - Yes, I do.
Yes, all of a sudden.<eos> They've done tests, but they don't know what it is.<eos> - His autonomic nervous system isn't working.<eos> - Yes, but they don't know why.<eos> - I don't either.
You know, honey, we used to be able to talk, as mother and daughter.<eos> I mean -- yeah, when I was like 10.<eos> But now you just look down your nose at everything I do with this disdain for everything that I do.<eos> I do not look down my nose at you.<eos> Yeah, you do. You do. You do, too.
"Thou shalt not covet thy parish's choir director."<eos> Book of Peggy, chapter one, verse one, phone call to the archdiocese.<eos> We're done here.<eos> Hey, if you can't stand the heat, stay out of the box!<eos> How you doing?
Yeah, and then instead of going on and on about Marvin Gaye's dad, he's running for a napkin.<eos> Yeah, I... I don't know that these are the types of people that you're gonna throw off with a phantom booger.<eos> You know?<eos> They'll just assume you have one.<eos> Which you kind of do, by the way.
Trust me, Mr. Weber.<eos> There is no problem.<eos> Enjoy the beautiful day.<eos> She really said she wants an open relationship?<eos> - Yeah, she did.
Shake your tail feathers.<eos> I mean, I'd rather not get these compliments with my pants down, but appreciate it.<eos> Paul, you don't have to do this if you don't want to.<eos> You don't have to clown for these people.<eos> Yes, you do.
Yes, very good.<eos> But if she did suspect, why would she tell Mary?<eos> To prepare her I suppose.<eos> But, I'm not sure she did suspect.<eos> What if she did, right from the start?
"Exhausting" is more like it.<eos> At least you can have a beer after a long day.<eos> This is true.<eos> Oh, you met Pam. Yes.<eos> I sure did.
I did it for you, Teri.<eos> But there is something I need you to do.<eos> Charlie Monahan has been on stress leave for the last six months.<eos> Did you try his house?<eos> No, I didn't.
She's asking me to fluff his nutter.<eos> Yo, Nash!<eos> So... Marie.<eos> Did Joe tell you about my big new job promotion?<eos> Of course she did.
First-class.<eos> In those jeans?<eos> You got first-class tickets to Paris?<eos> Are you insane?<eos> My fingers did it.
I can testify.<eos> To bring down B613, we need to bring down Command.<eos> Command is Rowan, but Command is also Jake.<eos> - You don't give up, do you?<eos> - No. I don't.
Or less.<eos> Last time we talked, You said that, uh, were seeing someone.<eos> - I was.<eos> - You said you liked her.<eos> I still do.
Maybe even a tidal wave.<eos> Time will tell, it always does.<eos> Whatever you did for Ashildr... .. I think she deserved it.<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, she did.
All right, Max, what do you got?<eos> Well, as I suspected, the C.O.D. was blunt force trauma to the head and torso caused by the fall.<eos> But I didn't find evidence of foul play.<eos> Well, yeah, but you didn't find anything that proves that she wasn't pushed, right?<eos> No, I didn't.
Matty, you were right.<eos> I only hooked up with Collin because he was everything you weren't, including an [bleep].<eos> Jenna, listen.<eos> I have to tell you something.<eos> No, you don't.
Miss me?<eos> (somber folk music)<eos> - All the 3s have been played.<eos> - Mm-hmm. - Question is, do you have a heart?<eos> Hm, of course you do.
I saw her as I've never seen her before, as a woman in love... with you.<eos> You'd never know she suffers the torments of hell believing that you had died without knowing.<eos> Knowing?<eos> That she has always loved you.<eos> And she still does.
Yeah, I did. - And?<eos> - Nothing.<eos> Maybe there's nothing to find.<eos> - You don't believe that.<eos> - No, I don't.
She's a good friend.<eos> What?<eos> Just for you, I think there's a little truth in this big lie.<eos> Where'd you find her?<eos> - We didn't.
Martha.<eos> In her defense, I think she just wanted to get me on board with the sale, since she knew it would be unpopular with the town council.<eos> So, do you really think that tearing down Keating house is - the best option for our town?<eos> - I don't have the choice.<eos> - Sure you do.
She didn't want to wait anymore.<eos> It's, uh, not good.<eos> This project could be very good for the town.<eos> But you not talking about it is almost worse than you talking about it.<eos> I don't.
Me, I wanted a whole baseball team.<eos> It's funny how you can think you know someone when you don't, really.<eos> How about you and Jake?<eos> I loved him until the day he died.<eos> I still do.
Kick, slide.<eos> Kick, slide. Basics.<eos> Come on, man.<eos> Didn't you win a fucking Super Bowl, Greane?<eos> - Yes, I did.
He's on a quest!<eos> With a vision.<eos> I did not know that.<eos> - You have a vision?<eos> - Yes, he does.
So long as that mad man has the power to expose us, we must obey his commands.<eos> Is that poison?<eos> I'll fill a hidden needle, and inject the Omec during coitus.<eos> Why do you want me dead?<eos> Actually, I don't.
Sir, we fished an I.V. bag out of the trash.<eos> The tube still had the blood on it from when Niels ripped it out of his arm.<eos> And?<eos> Every bag prepared in the medical bay should have the patient's name, medication, and Doc Rios' signature.<eos> This one didn't.
Detective Angie Flynn.<eos> I hear you're pretty shaken up, Mr. Sharpe.<eos> Julian Stancroft. I've advised my client that I'll respond to all questions on his behalf.<eos> - You want that?<eos> - He does.
You tried to kill me, you lunatic.<eos> Okay, whatever did or did not happen was due to the fact that my family was drugging me.<eos> Former family.<eos> Victoria, please, you don't need her kind of help.<eos> Oh, the hell she doesn't.
- Fine.<eos> - We're going with you.<eos> - No. Absolutely not.<eos> - Look, you don't have a say in the matter, pal.<eos> - I certainly do.
And Abraham... he has his dark places, - no?<eos> Oui.<eos> Yeah. Perhaps someday he'll tell you about it.<eos> - So did you find Leo Butler?<eos> - Yeah, we did.
- ... that he would come?<eos> - Clementine.<eos> - Do you?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> I really don't.
Falco: Wait.<eos> What, you're not goin'?<eos> I think I'll see if Stella wants to drive up.<eos> You don't want to wear your girl out before you get there, do you?<eos> No, I do not.
- Did they hurt you?<eos> - No, no. I'm okay.<eos> Did they hurt you?<eos> - Who cares?<eos> - I do.
Lorenzo.<eos> It's you.<eos> So you two know each other?<eos> The phrase "small world" comes to mind.<eos> So does "epic understatement."
I just... I needed some time to process.<eos> I mean, 24 hours ago, I didn't even think it was possible to become a human again.<eos> But you want to be a human again.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Well, I did.
Of course I am.<eos> Come in.<eos> But I have to go.<eos> I don't.<eos> Yes, we do.
Oh, go for it, Raff.<eos> The idea is to pull the dragon's teeth-- our teeth-- one-by-one. GIBBS:<eos> How?<eos> According to your case report, a thief used social media to find her target.<eos> Dragon's Tooth does the same, but for terror. How?
Erm...<eos> Well, Tyler's, er kind of a social/political artist, I guess, is What he calls himself.<eos> But really he kind ofjust makes weird shit out of wood.<eos> - I didn't say that.<eos> - Yes, you did.
If we don't show up, they'll come looking.<eos> Is it possible I'm pregnant?<eos> I don't think so, hon.<eos> It felt so real.<eos> It still does.
What I did to her.<eos> So I just imagine something else, you know?<eos> She's out there with new parents, and they're helping her and loving her, and... the doctors are fixing her brain.<eos> 'Cause I can't live if I don't think that she has a chance, so...<eos> But she doesn't.
I'm not gonna let you hurt my baby.<eos> Have you made up your mind?<eos> Are you going to help us take down the dome?<eos> I don't really have a choice, do I?<eos> Neither of us do.
Me, neither.<eos> Not since last night.<eos> Last night?<eos> Look, I've probably said too much already, especially considering Junior outranks me.<eos> I do, too.
I worked surveillance on the dome.<eos> I've seen you go all Ted Bundy on people.<eos> I also saw how much you care about this town.<eos> You don't want to do this.<eos> - And neither does Hektor.
I don't even know why I'm defending myself.<eos> What does it matter if they think that?<eos> What does it matter what anyone thinks of me anyways?<eos> You don't care what your friends think of me?<eos> No, actually, I don't.
"maybe this is it.<eos> This is where it all ends on 37th street between a yarn shop and a falafel stand."<eos> I know what a near-death experience is, and this wasn't my first.<eos> And it's true. Your life flashes right before your eyes.<eos> And this morning, mine did.
Right here.<eos> He dropped that from prison?<eos> How?<eos> Your daddy, he has his ways.<eos> He always did.
See, now that's a move your mama can't make.<eos> That's that thing that pushes you up to that whole other level. MICHAEL:<eos> Sorry, the gallery opening's in 30, so we got to...<eos> Michael, Ne-Yo.<eos> How you doing, brother? Wow!
Uh, Lucious asked me to look into, uh, Anita Calhoun.<eos> Anika Calhoun.<eos> Anika, yeah.<eos> She doesn't work for Lyon Dynasty, right?<eos> Never did.
You in the yard, keeping them all skinny.<eos> And you in the kitchen, keeping them thick.<eos> Baddest bitches on the block.<eos> Uh, why don't we go in the kitchen?<eos> How you doing?
I'm happy to be employed in Your Majesty's home.<eos> But if I'm to be honest,<eos> I find some members of your household to be...<eos> Reprehensible.<eos> So do I.
- Do you have a good life?<eos> Mostly the classics.<eos> I just finished The Great Gatsby.<eos> "The loneliest moment in someone's life is when they are watching their whole world fall apart, and all they can do is stare blankly."<eos> How you doing, Rock Star?
- "Shake It Off." - "Shake It Off," right.<eos> "Shake It Off," I love that song.<eos> Do you?<eos> Do I?<eos> Uh, do I?
What are we talking about?<eos> I didn't kill Michelle.<eos> I've done some bad things but for the right reasons.<eos> Please, you have to believe me.<eos> I do.
I didn't kill Michelle.<eos> I've done some bad things but for the right reasons.<eos> Please, you have to believe me.<eos> I do.<eos> Y-you do?
I'm so sorry. I didn't know.<eos> How'd you get through it?<eos> There's no magic bullet.<eos> You just...<eos> You do it...
That's exactly why he thinks you did it.<eos> Is he always so circular in his reasoning?<eos> You told me that you were called to that house, that you knew a woman was there.<eos> Do you know who she was?<eos> I do.
No! No!<eos> No! No!<eos> Larry, please!<eos> No!<eos> Larry, no! Please don't!
He was both.<eos> We believe he started driving because he was digging into Zooss.<eos> What did he want to know?<eos> Mostly about Patrick's job, like if I knew about any problems Patrick had at work.<eos> I didn't.
Diamond Drive Properties.<eos> Billy!<eos> Hey.<eos> Come here, you.<eos> How you doing?
So what am I supposed to do?<eos> I need a job.<eos> Well, on that note, take a seat.<eos> Sofia, I don't need one of your pep talks that's actually a lecture.<eos> But you do.
That was a bar fight.<eos> It wasn't a bar fight, you already told Sandy...<eos> You see? He can't even remember what lies he told.<eos> - Griff, do you think you're powerless?<eos> - Of course he doesn't.
It is a legitimate national news magazine.<eos> They interviewed her. She disclosed. And I got a call from Dodds, who got a call from the mayor.<eos> So we are going to investigate.<eos> (Rollins) We don't even know who this girl is.<eos> America's Worst Crimes does.
You watch?<eos> (Brian) Heather wanted to stay and snuggle.<eos> But I was kind of done.<eos> So she just left?<eos> No, I did.
Well, today's your lucky day, because if you tell me who was in the room, you could walk.<eos> You called Cuba?<eos> It's not like I have pull there.<eos> Zach Franklin will be arrested when he returns to American soil.<eos> - If he does.
Oh, no, it's fine.<eos> You were swearing too much anyway.<eos> ~ And that was before you murdered a dwarf.<eos> ~ I didn't murder him.<eos> No, of course you didn't.
Thomas Dewey organizes a citywide raid to find Lucky Luciano.<eos> He's not in here.<eos> Luciano escapes, but for Dewey, the raid isn't a total loss, as he brings in a prostitute who works in one of Luciano's brothels.<eos> So, how do you know Lucky Luciano?<eos> I don't.
Strange bedfellows.<eos> Needless to say, you do your duty, we'll do ours.<eos> You can count on us, Your Highness.<eos> I knew you'd come to see things my way.<eos> People always do.
I didn't.<eos> I know, I know.<eos> What?<eos> How do you know?<eos> Because I did.
Why do we have to drag this out?<eos> Your son is talking to you.<eos> He's telling you what he wants.<eos> No, we don't know that he would say that today.<eos> I do.
When PJ wakes up.<eos> I'm gonna take you on a trip.<eos> Some place you've never been before. Uh-huh.<eos> Proper honeymoon.<eos> I do weekend getaways.
Not the screams in the dark, not everything breaking, but when we spoke all night until the light came in with the Dominican music from the neighbors.<eos> Kissing in the cab, in the club.<eos> Telling me your dreams about tidal waves over the phone during finals.<eos> Cramped sex in a cramped dorm room with a burning hot pipe.<eos> I do."
Yes.<eos> I did whatever he told me to.<eos> I hurt people.<eos> I spilled the blood of an innocent man... men.<eos> And I did it all in the name of the Lord.
Visions from God?<eos> Voices?<eos> In two days, we have to say goodbye to our son.<eos> No, we don't.<eos> Yes, yes, we do.
Okay, how long did these guys stick around?<eos> I closed their tab around 11.<eos> They were pretty wasted, so I called them a cab.<eos> Do you know how hard it is to get the smell of vomit out of pleather?<eos> - Thankfully, I do not.
Even if it's true, and it's not, it's not our place.<eos> Gino...<eos> He's toying with you, bella.<eos> Do you really think so?<eos> Yes, Anna, I do.
I wanted to help.<eos> I did help.<eos> We saved them.<eos> You had no obligation.<eos> Yes, I did.
Why did you ride all the way up here?<eos> Why do you think?<eos> Vice Chancellor Voske sent you.<eos> She knows you've gone rogue.<eos> They all do.
I care.<eos> I mean, you gave her to us.<eos> Did you tell Dad?<eos> No.<eos> - Jill, did you?
It's nothing.<eos> Jill's happy.<eos> - Did she take my letter?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Yeah, she did.
Until we fell asleep in each other's arms.<eos> And when I woke up, she was like this again.<eos> For some reason, the people in this town don't want me to talk about what happened.<eos> Maybe they don't believe me.<eos> Maybe you don't.
Or maybe you'd be captured and dead too.<eos> I know, to you, she's just an agent, but to me, she's my family.<eos> Does that mean anything to you?<eos> Do you have a family?<eos> I did.
On Krypton, I remember Aunt Astra and my mother always arguing.<eos> Like sisters do.<eos> And when I asked my mother why they could never get along, she said that it was because Astra didn't have faith in people.<eos> You wanted to know if I have faith in you.<eos> I do.
What is that?<eos> It's poison.<eos> It's gonna stop your heart.<eos> You said temporarily.<eos> That I did. That I did.
Hated slavery.<eos> Hated it.<eos> - Did you know that?<eos> - I did not, Senator.<eos> Well, he did.
I was pressuring her, and she ran away.<eos> And now that she's returned?<eos> That means she's ready to confess, and we can all move on.<eos> The real question is, how do you know Harper?<eos> - I don't.
They left behind all their gear and guns, and they took this... why?<eos> What's in it?<eos> I don't think it's corn.<eos> Hey, my key... do you have it?<eos> Yes, I do.
We've got to get going.<eos> I'm coming!<eos> I'm happy that Rachel is taking you on this trip.<eos> You've had a rough year.<eos> - We all did.
Please.<eos> He doesn't believe it's true.<eos> Just tell him you have it.<eos> I mean, I...<eos> I do.
- It...<eos> - Just to offer my condolences.<eos> It's just so tragic and unexpected.<eos> Just, you know, it doesn't make any sense.<eos> Well, suicide rarely does.
I'm sorry.<eos> I remember you getting a phone call and walking out the door.<eos> Well, did... Did you at least try her cell?<eos> Yes.<eos> Why don't you?
Like this.<eos> It's all in the reflexes.<eos> Now you try.<eos> Did you at least see the safe?<eos> I did, yes.
But it will not be the same.<eos> - Mrs Crawley doesn't mean that.<eos> - I'd like to think that. But it sounds very much as if she does.<eos> Did you drink at luncheon?<eos> No, I did not.
Not when she's doing what she's doing for Mr Mason.<eos> - What's this?<eos> - Daisy. - You must talk when it isn't settled.<eos> - I want to get things settled.<eos> Don't we all?
He didn't even seem to know what scripture was.<eos> Or maybe you're just looking for any excuse to find fault with him.<eos> Excuse me. Or maybe hiring someone sight unseen over the Internet was a bad idea.<eos> Do you wanna spend another year looking for a new pastor?<eos> Because I don't.
Michael!<eos> Please help!<eos> What happened?<eos> I'm okay!<eos> - Noma, who did this to you?
_<eos> Miss Hapstall, how often do you go to the Gladness Spa?<eos> Once a week.<eos> I've got a herniated disk.<eos> How we doing?
Yes, I am.<eos> And you canvassed the touchscreen voting machines<eos> - in Cook County? - Yes.<eos> And did you find any more of these hacking devices, these "man in the middle" devices?<eos> - I did. - Forty.
I missed you.<eos> He showed me the video he took from the roof.<eos> Jesus, that kid has got a world-class imagination. You know that.<eos> I saw it, too.<eos> - I did.
And my father was someone of certain importance in the community, so he went to speak to the captain and asked, "When will they return?"<eos> And the captain told my father,<eos> "Miguel, don't worry.<eos> They always come home."<eos> And they did.
It's not right.<eos> There may not be another way.<eos> There is always another way.<eos> We will keep looking. We have time.<eos> Maybe you do.
I definitely am.<eos> I... if you still want to go.<eos> So... What do you say, Louie?<eos> I say...<eos> I do.
Maggie could explain away the trip out of the country, any follow-up appointments, any pain or cramping.<eos> What if she really did book that surgery?<eos> Well, you looked at her pretty closely at the morgue.<eos> If she had had her stomach stapled, wouldn't you have noticed?<eos> She didn't.
We didn't insult your intelligence.<eos> Don't insult ours.<eos> We're here because the smugglers killed a young woman named Maggie Halpern.<eos> Now, if any of their heroin winds up in your hands, the NYPD is gonna devote all of their resources to tying her murder to you, Janko.<eos> We done here? No.
Geneva pine approached me to turn evidence. Kalinda wasn't involved.<eos> It was me.<eos> It was you? How could it be you?<eos> I gave pine what I knew.<eos> You did?
Who is Beck?<eos> Beck was Robert's best friend.<eos> We basically grew up together.<eos> I may have lost my virginity to him.<eos> Alright, I did.
I was married to the King by then - and we had a son.<eos> The heart wants what it wants.<eos> But the marriage was arranged and you honored the pact like a dutiful daughter of England.<eos> The people won't accept the idea of an arranged marriage. They love the King.<eos> And so do you.
Mum.<eos> I know Dad loved you, and I love you, too.<eos> And so does Cyrus.<eos> Do you think so?<eos> Of course he does.
He-he asked me if I took the baby.<eos> And I just... I... I lost it.<eos> We fought and...<eos> Well, you know how it ended.<eos> I do, Phil.
Yeah!<eos> And there is no extradition here!<eos> This is still the United States.<eos> Why didn't you tell me that?<eos> Dude, I did...
- We violated no copyrights.<eos> - We own proprietary algorithms...<eos> You were making it up as you went, at least admit it.<eos> - Connecting subscribers in discreet<eos> - The Source does a version of that...
Nice to meet you!<eos> Shit ...<eos> Why did you make those kinds of sounds?<eos> It means "yes" in the north of Sweden.<eos> No, it does not.
So you do love me?<eos> - What was that?<eos> - You do love me?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes I do.
I know how you feel.<eos> I've wanted this bastard for 20 years.<eos> He doesn't deserve a new start.<eos> You're right.<eos> He doesn't.
I-I know, my phone died and I mixed up the dates at the studio, I..<eos> ...actually booked time for tomorrow, not today.<eos> But where were you?<eos> You told me you were going to The Brew.<eos> I did.
I've always doubted myself.<eos> At least now we know the truth.<eos> Do we?<eos> 'Cause I'm havin' a hard time believing nobody else in this family knew about Charles.<eos> Somebody did.
Swim in the ocean.<eos> I can't get back the time I lost, but..<eos> I don't wanna waste any more of it sitting in a room having someone analyze me.<eos> I don't expect anyone to understand any of this.<eos> I do.
'Thought if you lodged a complaint about one cop' you could swap him out for someone closer to your own age?<eos> That's not what I told you.<eos> You claimed that cop insulted you. - He did.<eos> - Whoa, wait.<eos> - Who did?
There was this dark car, it was going real slow.<eos> Did the car hit you?<eos> It suddenly sped up, and... the side mirror smashed into my elbow and...<eos> I-I have to clean this up before your mom sees it.<eos> No, you don't.
Yeah, but there's nothing going on here tonight.<eos> Those guys could use our help, anyway.<eos> Hey, come on, the car's over here.<eos> Yeah, and we gotta let Command know we're goin'.<eos> No, we don't.
Do you even go to school here?<eos> No.<eos> But I bet I'll be the prettiest girl in the yearbook.<eos> You didn't tell me your name. You're right.<eos> I didn't.
- It doesn't make any sense.<eos> - What doesn't?<eos> Barmal designed her serum to block the virus from entering human blood cells.<eos> - So where did she go wrong?<eos> - She didn't.
The shift doesn't end for another 15 minutes.<eos> My husband isn't well and he'll worry if I'm not home by quarter past.<eos> Well, um... I suppose that'll have to be enough for today.<eos> Oh, I didn't know you worked here, Mrs Simms.<eos> - She doesn't yet.
- Kind of.<eos> Dr. Hamburg asked me If I wanted updates on how it goes with the recipient.<eos> I mean, I want to know if things go well.<eos> - But...<eos> - If it doesn't?
Wow, babe, you look stunning.<eos> We both do.<eos> And you know you're not dying tomorrow, right?<eos> I don't.<eos> But neither do you.
You were there when the Orea building was bombed.<eos> They wanted you to save Clifford Hawkins.<eos> They sent Karakurt to the memorial to make you think he was the threat so you would secure the Senator and infect him in the process.<eos> I don't have the virus.<eos> You do, Lizzy.
That's making a promise that you'll be there for someone. A promise I can't be sure of keeping.<eos> Best not to get into that sort of situation. I've always felt it better all round.<eos> - Come on. - What?<eos> Out there?<eos> Neither of us did very well out of our inheritance, did we?
I, Jimmy Shive-Overly, will not be some has-been's lackey.<eos> That'd be like Thomas Keller making the donkey sauce for Guy Fieri's taco burgers.<eos> No, I'm gonna write a new novel, for I am a writer.<eos> So you don't need the extra work?<eos> Well, of course I do.
...and, honestly, I was thinking about postponing the whole trip.<eos> The Nepalese government just put all these restrictions on Everest because of the whole human waste pollution.<eos> Talk about a pile of shit, right?<eos> Well, that's the problem, Gretchen.<eos> No one does.
They've sacked the Captain.<eos> You can see their point.<eos> How could they have someone in the management of the new system who thinks the whole idea is a horrible mistake?<eos> - And you support this notion?<eos> - Of course he does.
- Oh. Is the skin crispy like Mrs Patmore does it?<eos> Did you ask her advice?<eos> We certainly talked about what it's like to cook dinner for you.<eos> - Ah, I bet she had a lot to say.<eos> - We both did.
- Yes, I trust that you will give us a service that will uphold the dignified standards of your predecessor.<eos> You don't have any of those services on video, do you?<eos> 'Cause I'd kinda like to see how it's done.<eos> I mean... how it used to be done.<eos> Uh... uh... no, I don't.
That could help ID him, right?<eos> We'll see what we can find out.<eos> But it's a long shot at best.<eos> I know this seems impossible.<eos> A lot of our cases do at first.
Even before it started, our relationship was impossible.<eos> We tried to run away together, like in the movies. To leave Abuddin for good.<eos> I bribed a merchant marine from Mumbai to let us stow away.<eos> We were supposed to meet him at a café, but he never showed up.<eos> My father did, though.
Okay.<eos> Can you come by tomorrow night?<eos> Done, thank you.<eos> I really appreciate it.<eos> Not as much as I do.
When dad died, you moved back home to take care of us.<eos> When I started getting into trouble after that, you helped mom find Charton.<eos> When mom pulled me out of honor, you asked me to be your maid of honor.<eos> I thought you'd like that.<eos> I do, but...
- I am.<eos> I... I have just too much going on at home right now for me to even consider planning a trip away. So...<eos> I hope you understand.<eos> Of course.<eos> Of course I do.
What do you mean, you're not gay?<eos> Do you not like me?<eos> No, of course I like you.<eos> Do you not like me like that?<eos> No, I do.
He doesn't know for sure that's what started it.<eos> You got to keep the faith, Billy.<eos> The truth comes out.<eos> You believe me, don't you?<eos> Yeah, I do.
No, man, no.<eos> I always turn the power strip off when I'm not using it, I swear to God.<eos> You still believe me, right?<eos> You said you did.<eos> Yeah, I do.
Listen, Victoria was raped, so whoever set that fire was trying to kill her.<eos> That wasn't me, I swear, I swear...<eos> I know, I know.<eos> So do the police.<eos> They do?
I trained for four years with the most dangerous sensei I know.<eos> I can handle her.<eos> We still have to find Victoria.<eos> We don't know where she's hiding.<eos> I do.
The suspect's brother conveniently cleared your prime suspect, and you let him go on his merry way while looking for someone else to charge with murder.<eos> Dr. Halstead was cleared because he didn't do it.<eos> Interesting.<eos> Did you ask him where he was at the time Nadia Decotis went missing?<eos> No, we did not.
Now, down on all fours like the rest of them!<eos> That's right, we got ways to break your spirit!<eos> In fact, you seem like a prime candidate for The Chair.<eos> Honey, did you hear a dog scream?<eos> Yes, I did, dear.
You still have a lot of anger in you.<eos> You need to deal with a few things directly.<eos> What, like therapy?<eos> Well, if that feels right.<eos> Well, it doesn't.
I think they really like each other, but think about it.<eos> What if he does something small, like help fix another cop's mistake and then tells her about it?<eos> Isn't it her job to bring things like this to her boss?<eos> You know, I'll call him tomorrow, and if he knows about it, I'll just tell him we'll keep it between us.<eos> And if he doesn't?
He's right-- we found one there a few months ago.<eos> So what makes you think they did this?<eos> Elevated levels of Colony Collapse Disorder along the Northeast.<eos> You putting that on AgriNext, too?<eos> Everett Keck did.
I am free to go?<eos> You have suffered enough, and I am not a monster.<eos> If you ever need any more Jews to kill, you know where to find me.<eos> Yes.<eos> I do.
Neither of them ever came out on top.<eos> And no one knows why he's so obsessed with killing Superman.<eos> So, what's the plan?<eos> How do we stop him?<eos> We don't.
Not from anyone.<eos> And thank Christ for that, if this is what it does to you.<eos> You could always steal it.<eos> I'm just saying. If you wanted to.<eos> He doesn't!
We need answers.<eos> Chief, a handful of officers were dispatched to the edge of the town to deal with a situation.<eos> Do any of the officers know about the troubles?<eos> No.<eos> Not many do.
My tongue died.<eos> Oh, uh, is it feeling numb or painful?<eos> So much worse than that.<eos> And the scariest thing is I know why it happened.<eos> Oh, you do?
Like VHS?<eos> Yup.<eos> A collection of all the men and women she'd ever been with up to and including the time that we were together.<eos> Who even has a VCR?<eos> She does.
You know, things.<eos> Oh. Did you tell Victoria?<eos> No.<eos> Molly.<eos> Of course I did.
That's like asking, if a chicken laid an egg in the forest, would you hear it?<eos> I guess it was a good thing I didn't ruin your life by offering to love and cherish you till death do us part.<eos> What are you getting so mad about?<eos> You didn't want to marry me, either.<eos> No, I did. And then I didn't.
We... I think we might need to talk about something. Ah.<eos> I'm not leaving you.<eos> Croatoan's offer has to be a little... tempting.<eos> You're asking me if I want all this to be over, live behind some white picket fence, adopt a shelter dog?<eos> Of course I do.
Well, she just needs the right mentor.<eos> You know, self-belief can mean the difference between success and failure.<eos> I have to run it by the Governor.<eos> I would have thought she'd allow you some autonomy.<eos> Of course she does.
I've invited him to observe.<eos> If you don't mind, Dr. Reid.<eos> Not at all.<eos> I've finished scrubbing. You can take my place.<eos> Almost done, Mr. Powell.
Mnh. Barely feel it.<eos> Having your leg crushed by a forklift must really make pain relative. Yeah.<eos> Interesting fact... a major pain receptor in the lower leg is called the saphenous nerve, derived from the arabic word "safin,"<eos> meaning hidden or concealed, but that's actually in reference to the saphenous vein, which was kind of hidden, at least if you were practicing medicine in the middle ages.<eos> Almost done, Mr. Powell.
You always side with each other!<eos> I can't stand it!<eos> - (Door slams) - Told you.<eos> Yep.<eos> You did.
I'm sick of everyone and I'm sick of myself.<eos> I hate it here.<eos> I know.<eos> I told you, I didn't take it.<eos> Yeah, well, then who did, huh?
I knew she was a freak, but I didn't think she'd go this far.<eos> She's fuckin' demented.<eos> You believe me, right?<eos> Yep.<eos> Yeah, of course I do.
I'd walk through the front door and see you, and when you hadn't had a drink,<eos> God,<eos> I'd be so happy.<eos> But I knew it wasn't going to last.<eos> And it never did.
Well, I don't know, Mr Fletcher.<eos> Just... just... just get out.<eos> Get out!<eos> I must have missed the order for the cell toss.<eos> You didn't.
His name, Bea.<eos> I need to know his name.<eos> I need you to find out who he is.<eos> I'll find the bastard.<eos> And when I do...
What did I say?<eos> I do too much.<eos> Did I say that?<eos> Yep!<eos> You did.
A witness.<eos> Nice job, Sherlock.<eos> This was left for you at the front.<eos> Oh, you order in?<eos> No, I didn't.
Five minutes, in and out!<eos> Yeah, the one thing you don't have to explain to me is "in and out."<eos> I need help!<eos> I never said I was fast.<eos> All my high school guidance counselors did, but I did not.
Oh, I mean, you signed on for this.<eos> But you're almost done, so just suck it up.<eos> "Suck it up"?<eos> Well, you wanted my advice.<eos> No, I didn't.
Are you talking about Tucson?<eos> Just saying that's where there are other people, Phil.<eos> Carol, the only place I can't go is Tucson.<eos> I mean, do you not remember me getting, like, tackled, driven out into the desert and left there for dead?<eos> - Yes, I do, I... - No, no, no.
Pick up the pace!<eos> Coach, are you crying?<eos> You only get one cry in life, son, and this ain't it.<eos> Now run till your heart explodes,<eos> 'Cause...mine just did.
Liam's been gone less than a week.<eos> The body's still warm.<eos> There is nothing going on between me and Fisher.<eos> Huh. Okay, well, if you want my opinion on turning Liam down...<eos> I don't.
Make and model?<eos> A license plate number? We're past the point of no return.<eos> Um, black sedan.<eos> Can't make out the plates.<eos> But maybe you did, Cameron.
I don't know.<eos> Um, Laura and I have to go look at houses later this afternoon, so...<eos> What's Wrong with my house?<eos> You knew we weren't gonna live here forever.<eos> I do now.
- What about you, Abby? Any cravings?<eos> Oh, it's usually just whatever they're out of at the commissary.<eos> Oh, the commissary's a disaster.<eos> You should see the shopping list I foist on Robert when he's traveling.<eos> You do a lot of traveling, don't you, Dr. Oppenheimer?
Well, this is definitely not the weekend I was expecting.<eos> Well, I guess we shouldn't be completely surprised.<eos> His voice mail was sung to the tune of Candle in the Wind.<eos> [sighs] The main thing is he seems happy.<eos> He really does.
Oh, and the homework club is a blessing!<eos> I can do the whole day, finish off, lock up and be here at 5.30 to pick her up myself.<eos> I'm so sorry I didn't recognise you.<eos> Oh, no!<eos> No-one does anymore.
No.<eos> No blood, no shell casings, no nothing.<eos> Hey, doesn't this remind you of, uh, that sketch from "Saturday Night Tonight" where, uh, Mickey Franks plays Sherlock Holmes' wacky cousin?<eos> No, I don't watch that stupid show, bro.<eos> - You don't?
I mean, sometimes Owen plays games on it.<eos> Oh, so Owen arranged his own kidnapping, right?<eos> Of course not.<eos> I left my phone at a yoga studio.<eos> Maybe somebody did it from there.
Although Andre could juggle 'em, if anyone could.<eos> He's very deft with his hands.<eos> Stop it. Does the bullying stop when you grow up?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes. Yes. Yes, it does.
Is that me?<eos> No, I think that's the big-boned lass from the bus.<eos> PAM: This is unacceptable.<eos> Ellie has a very vivid imagination.<eos> Actually, she does not.
Gabi, it's been three days.<eos> Why is the blender still here?<eos> Well, remember when you said that if I could figure out a way to pay for the blender without using our rent money, I could keep it?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Well, I did it!
But you didn't ask my opinion. You asked me to check it for exposure.<eos> If there's one thing I've noticed about you, it's that you give your opinion whether it's asked for or not.<eos> And why does my opinion matter to you so much that you would go through all this?<eos> Your opinion doesn't matter to me.<eos> Your development does.
Should charge more for that.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Look at that.<eos> That is a peach right there.<eos> Hey, how they doing?
- I just saved your ass.<eos> - He was about to tell me everything!<eos> Where the hell are you goin' now?<eos> - I don't need your help. - Yeah?<eos> Well, Uncle Eddie did.
- Oh, yeah.<eos> - You didn't Want to know.<eos> No, I did not want to know.<eos> No.<eos> No, and now I do.
Seven years ago, I thought I would never write again.<eos> And then you walked through the door.<eos> And my whole world changed.<eos> You were right... you said I had no idea.<eos> But now I do.
Yeah.<eos> I... did you... did you...<eos> Did you talk to them?<eos> - My family?<eos> - Of course I did.
- And then what?<eos> I'll drink a lot of whisky.<eos> And then what?<eos> Do you know Marcus McDonald well?<eos> Yes, you do.
You dodged a bullet.<eos> I don't know how but... worth dinner and flowers at least.<eos> You're right.<eos> Jimmy has an alibi.<eos> He always did.
They got the stink of their owner.<eos> Cigarettes and coffee, cat piss, smell of decay.<eos> I'm looking for a friend of mine who was supposed to meet me this morning.<eos> You seen him?<eos> Y-Yeah, I did a couple days ago.
Then... and now.<eos> You've become a friend.<eos> And I haven't had many of those over the years.<eos> I enjoy your companionship.<eos> As does Boris.
Chair, stop making me drop things!<eos> Oh, I would like an oyster, please. Hmm.<eos> Actually, I changed my mind.<eos> I don't want an oyster.<eos> Oh, I do.
What's the name of that cutie?<eos> Lucien.<eos> Lucien?<eos> You named your baby Lucien?<eos> I did. Yes.
Picture it clearly.<eos> Okay.<eos> I'm picturing it...<eos> What? I said don't use magic!<eos> I didn't, deary.
Dude, what are you doing?<eos> Just making sure everything's going all right.<eos> You can't make silly faces.<eos> Sorry, I just wanted to make sure I was doing a good job.<eos> -You're doing great.
Dude, I can't believe they cut both of us out of the movie entirely.<eos> Yeah.<eos> That happened to me on The Cookout 3.<eos> The whole subplot of me beating Marquise at the pie-eating contest got scrapped.<eos> So how you doing?
Is this a bad time?<eos> Well, it was, and then you called.<eos> Is there a problem?<eos> I need to know if you meant what you said today.<eos> I did, and I do.
- Did you get a look at him?<eos> - Not right now, Hap.<eos> No, no, it's okay.<eos> Cody, did you see him?<eos> Yeah, I did.
Carla, I've got no idea - what you're going on about.<eos> - Jules, I saw you at the hospital.<eos> I know how Hap looks at something he thinks belongs to him.<eos> So does he love you?<eos> He did.
Dad knows.<eos> I had it out with him.<eos> We're done.<eos> So if your offer still stands, I'm in.<eos> Well, of course it does.
Protect your friend.<eos> I just witnessed a lovers' quarrel in the oval office.<eos> And keeping a secret like that is not gonna work for me.<eos> Honestly, I had no idea.<eos> Well, now you do.
- We were trouble. - Go on!<eos> Six bullets, just what I left William.<eos> I should've died.<eos> I should've died, not her.<eos> Well, you didn't for a reason.
We'll go get Mexican.<eos> - That's fine.<eos> - You don't want to.<eos> It's...<eos> I do.
Hey, man.<eos> Hey, bud.<eos> Hey.<eos> D-did you win your fight?<eos> Yeah, I did.
I didn't know you were gonna be there. - I've been grooming bucket for a year.<eos> - I know. And I'm this close to getting to his boss.<eos> You could've jeopardized my whole case.<eos> But I-I didn't.<eos> I didn't jeopar...
He was one of the best computer engineers they had.<eos> Then, out of the blue, he got fired. No one knew why.<eos> One day, he told me. He had leukemia.<eos> Made me swear to never tell anyone, especially my mom.<eos> So, I didn't.
Damn.<eos> If you're not comfortable with fan interactions... - Why are you going to a fan convention?<eos> - No, I... Love the fans, I do.<eos> I love them.<eos> I do, I do.
If you're not comfortable with fan interactions... - Why are you going to a fan convention?<eos> - No, I... Love the fans, I do.<eos> I love them.<eos> I do, I do.<eos> Did.
- No, I... Love the fans, I do.<eos> I love them.<eos> I do, I do.<eos> Did.<eos> Do.
You didn't have a spot for him.<eos> I was working on it. Really?<eos> 'Cause it kind of seemed like you were slow-playing us.<eos> To see if he was healthy. Is that what you think?<eos> Yeah. I do.
There's no way you fucking made that up.<eos> Hunter S. Thompson.<eos> Ah, Hunter S. Thompson.<eos> That guy knows some shit.<eos> Did.
His ideology is, uh, based on one thing: money and lots of it.<eos> He does, however, have ties to the gangs in Russia, which is what I think Callen was looking for.<eos> Uh, guys.<eos> You find him, Eric?<eos> No, but LAPD did.
If this painting is original, it's worth over $200 million.<eos> Wow. So... Yeah.<eos> Just... be careful.<eos> Looks like I owe you an apology.<eos> No, you don't.
I'd better answer.<eos> Saved by the cell.<eos> Thanks for the pep talk.<eos> I hope it helped.<eos> It did.
We're gonna look at a venue. - Good.<eos> - And then, you know,<eos> DJ, flowers, food and then get married.<eos> I found this photo booth I want.<eos> Classic, of course you did.
They denied all knowledge of him?<eos> There's no formal employment records at Cristal Kebabs.<eos> Most of it's cash in hand work.<eos> In fact, we're making assumptions he even worked there.<eos> He did.
Go.<eos> _<eos> I'm a very busy man, Thomas Graham Connor. Tommy.<eos> Call me Tommy.<eos> How you doing?
If you sign, then I can have the contract in front of us in about 20 seconds.<eos> I promise you will not be disappointed.<eos> I'm already disappointed.<eos> Look uh... if you want to just keep this, the client-account executive situation, that's... that's fine.<eos> I don't.
So I'm glad you noticed.<eos> So, does this mean you're over your little freak-out?<eos> No, I didn't fucking have a freak-out.<eos> - Yeah. - Mnh-mnh.<eos> - Yes, you did.
Married the diamond(!<eos> Hello?<eos> Sir...<eos> - .. the ship, it came down, did you see it?<eos> - Yes, I did.
- Why would you say that? - Because it's the truth, Brian.<eos> They had this fun little thing in Mexico, and she got carried away and agreed to marry him because she thought he'd be shipping off before she ever had to go through with it, and she got all caught in these wedding details,<eos> and she doesn't love him, and she never did.<eos> Jenna.<eos> She never did.
Those days are over and done with.<eos> That kind of behavior, that violent-streak behavior is no longer gonna be tolerated by me or by the police."<eos> And do you remember what you said to me?<eos> No, I don't.<eos> You don't.
- Nobody.<eos> - Except my best friend.<eos> - Yup.<eos> - Well, but not even him because that was inappropriate and he knows better.<eos> - I do.
I can walk it from here. Till we meet up with my friends.<eos> They got a car.<eos> You can ride with them.<eos> How many friends you say there were?<eos> I didn't.
I find it difficult to believe that a man as pious as Archdeacon Robinus would endanger the life of a child.<eos> Yea.<eos> But we must meet Robinus and his Rosula to find out if it is indeed a harsh truth or the delusion of a potion maker.<eos> You do not think it is a delusion.<eos> I do not, my lady.
Do you understand me?<eos> Not when it involves a coordinated attack on the high command.<eos> The Semite I brought in, the one who shot at me, did you manage to locate any members of his family?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, we did.
- they have to make me a priority now.<eos> - Do they?<eos> I'm, frankly, amazed. I mean, between touring and acting, I don't know how you do it, especially with a new baby.<eos> It's tough. It's the life of a mom. - You know it.<eos> - Yeah, no, I do.
- I did.<eos> - Yep. Yeah.<eos> I just... just, uh, panicked for a second.<eos> I thought maybe it looked like I was hitting on you.<eos> Uh, didn't till just this second.
Alex!<eos> Alex!<eos> Do you like the tea?<eos> I...<eos> Yeah, I do.
Hiding behind those monitors.<eos> - [Voice breaking] Shelby, please.<eos> - No. This morning, we said we weren't gonna make any more choices that we regret.<eos> So I hope that you can live with this, Alex.<eos> I really do.
I was just a kid!<eos> And what?<eos> You thought if you blew yourself up in the middle of the courthouse, you would show people the truth?<eos> For so long, I've been trying to realize why I've never told you that I love you.<eos> Because I do.
Get me a Tequila. Come on.<eos> Go ahead.<eos> Come here.<eos> Don't go crazy. Mid-shelf.<eos> How you doing?
Tonight we've got dinner with that woman from DeGraaf's.<eos> Roxanna Whitman.<eos> Do you know her?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, I do.
Your badass art buddies going to come rough us up?<eos> Don't underestimate people with money.<eos> 'Cause they hire guys to do what they can't.<eos> I don't got it no more.<eos> Well, who does?
Yeah, Dr. Reed's been in a real good mood since he started getting it on the reg.<eos> On the reg with Whitney?<eos> Well...<eos> She knows you're going out, right?<eos> Indeed she does, Danny.
Say we were to have another kid,<eos> Mindy would probably stop working.<eos> Oh, you don't say.<eos> I wasn't aware that Mindy wanted any more children.<eos> Oh, we do. Yeah.
- Thanks.<eos> - Yeah. - And I'm sorry that I said<eos> I know why your wife can't stand you.<eos> - You never said that.<eos> - I didn't?
Your father worked at Evil Corp before he died. That's a matter of public record.<eos> I'm not turning you in, if that's what you're thinking.<eos> I don't even have proof, and even if I did, I don't care.<eos> Just wanted to know your weakness.<eos> Now I do.
Tonight can only help you.<eos> This is a non-sanctioned fight, so even if you lose, which you won't, it's not gonna go on your record.<eos> - A loss is a loss.<eos> - Then don't fucking lose.<eos> What if I do?
For your private collection? A Renoir?<eos> A Van Gogh.<eos> Van Gogh.<eos> Which one?<eos> I once did a "Starry Night" for a gentleman in Shanghai.
We'll be heroes.<eos> I never cared to be a hero.<eos> I just wanted a... quiet, simple life.<eos> Which is what we had.<eos> Yes, we did.
And I'm still figuring out how to talk about it and when.<eos> But that's not what's happening here.<eos> _<eos> You have more...<eos> Experience than I do.
You... I know. You know, all the time, just...<eos> Mm-hm. Yeah, I know. I know.<eos> Do you?<eos> Do you know now?<eos> I do.
You could have buried them right there in your yard.<eos> Tell us, Mr. Murillo, when the New Jersey police search your home, will they find two graves?<eos> Say they do.<eos> It was self-defense, you said it yourself.<eos> I did, I did.
I won't do it again.<eos> But you have to stop this.<eos> Melinda...<eos> How'd you know that wouldn't kill him?<eos> I didn't.
- No.<eos> Happiness.<eos> This kind of happiness.<eos> Of course you do.<eos> - We both do.
I promise this will never get back to you.<eos> But the next time that bastard demands personal services, at least you'll know you screwed him a little, too.<eos> I... I, uh... I didn't know where else to go.<eos> I'm sorry. I shouldn't have come here.<eos> But you did.
But the next time that bastard demands personal services, at least you'll know you screwed him a little, too.<eos> I... I, uh... I didn't know where else to go.<eos> I'm sorry. I shouldn't have come here.<eos> But you did.<eos> You did, Frank.
It...<eos> It's possible we saw what we wanted to see. Mm.<eos> I have one last far-fetched question, but<eos> - we have to ask.<eos> - No, we don't. No, we don't.
Boonie, why don't you go down there, man?<eos> You got two kids; they'll probably give you extra.<eos> Man, I'm already on food stamps, man. Between my mom and Shalinka, I don't have enough left to buy a bag of Doritos.<eos> Well, somebody gonna have to go down there, man, or else we gonna starve.<eos> Okay, well, who gonna do it, though?
He hasn't had the injection yet.<eos> Can I help?<eos> Oh, would you?<eos> He always settles with his grandfather.<eos> Of course he does.
~ Why are you doing this?<eos> ~ To help you to see who he really was properly.<eos> ~ You were supposed to be his friend.<eos> ~ Well, I didn't know him very well.<eos> None of us did.
To do that would be to say in public that I had complete faith in him.<eos> But there are still doubts over his conduct. ~ From whom?<eos> ~ I can't go into that.<eos> If you don't speak at his funeral, you're judging him without knowing the whole story.<eos> None of us do.
Create a perimeter and keep him away from the city.<eos> I thought you were better than this.<eos> I trusted you.<eos> You don't know me.<eos> No one does.
- Yeah.<eos> - No one will.<eos> - We went through it. - Yeah.<eos> Well, we don't have like the picture-perfect bond either.<eos> No. We don't.
- Would I do something like that?<eos> Oh.<eos> Well, in that case, I'm going to have to pay you with one of Simon's notes.<eos> The people loved him, didn't they?<eos> Of course they did.
- Pleased to meet you.<eos> - Charmed.<eos> - Hi.<eos> - We know each other.<eos> We do?
.<eos> as Hjalmar Söderberg said:<eos> You must excuse me, but I almost never watch TV.<eos> I haven't seen your cooking programme.<eos> -I did a series on drinks too.
Those hot spots you see are nodules... very early signs of disease.<eos> Arthur had vulnerable blood vessels.<eos> So, what are you saying?<eos> I'm saying that, had he fired a 9-millimeter weapon, I'd see discoloration in his skin.<eos> I do not.
Hey.<eos> Have you been smoking?<eos> Mm-hmm.<eos> Did you get word from Sammy?<eos> Uh, yeah, I did.
Not here!<eos> - What is it?<eos> - It's the impossible.<eos> What made you change your mind?<eos> I didn't.
LAWYER: Mr. Tull, your therapist's testimony is coming, and when it does, your ability to cut a deal goes away.<eos> Drop this matter, and no one ever knows you saw a therapist at all.<eos> You went to see a company provided therapist, and you never told me?<eos> I didn't think it mattered.<eos> Well, it goddamn does.
No, that's not on you. That's on me.<eos> I never welcomed you to the firm, and I should have.<eos> You know, when I was a young mother, first week of school, every clay I dropped my little girl off. When I left, she cried.<eos> Friday came, I left, she didn't cry.<eos> So I did.
He showed up at the club last night.<eos> I know. He told me.<eos> Not only could he've got all of us arrested, now Brukner's hot for more antiquities.<eos> And we don't have anything like the Gudea to give him.<eos> Maybe we do.
That's why. Why she's so unbearable?<eos> That's why she's willing to drive an hour to work.<eos> She was humiliated.<eos> There's no one in our precinct who knows what happened to her.<eos> - But if they did...
Hanging around a sketchy park.<eos> I'm not buying it, Donovan.<eos> You know what I think?<eos> I think you knew him.<eos> - The hell I did.
- Like wacko strange.<eos> - Yeah. It looks crazy, but...<eos> I was desperate to get down what I was thinking, you know, to make sense of it, to not forget what I saw when I was... wherever I was.<eos> You know you didn't see anything, right?<eos> Yes, I did.
You know you didn't see anything, right?<eos> Yes, I did.<eos> No, but literally, like, you didn't see anything.<eos> No, that's what I'm saying to you is that<eos> I literally did.
You gotta get well.<eos> You gotta be ready to quit this shit.<eos> And I'm ready.<eos> I don't want to do this.<eos> I don't.
Marvellous, ma'am.<eos> All hail, Morpheus, eh?<eos> Deep-Ando, conscript.<eos> Likes to think of himself as the joker of this little group.<eos> Well, he did.
The wires, they were like snakes. - Like it was alive.<eos> - Are you okay?<eos> Yeah, it just kind of flicked over my eyes.<eos> - Did I sleep?<eos> - Yeah, you did.
"Macbeth shall sleep no more."<eos> What?<eos> Shakespeare.<eos> He really knew his stuff.<eos> They all did.
The plan already happened.<eos> The plan was Olivia Pope standing on that sidewalk and, with one word, obliterating any life she's ever known.<eos> The plan was Liv requiring the same thing of herself that she requires of her clients, standing by the one thing, following the only rule that matters to her.<eos> What is that? Do not lie.<eos> Do. Not.
The pair that were torn on one of your conference room chairs.<eos> I e-mailed you an invoice.<eos> Is none of this ringing the bell?<eos> No, sorry, I get a lot of e-mail.<eos> Who doesn't?
Yes, I am.<eos> Yeah, I really am.<eos> Well, it was a beautiful ceremony.<eos> And seeing two men married didn't look nearly as weird as I thought it would.<eos> - Really. Really. - It did to me.
You don't have to say anything else.<eos> Everything is understood between us.<eos> I will wait here for you with your son.<eos> Come back, okay?<eos> But if you don't...
- What song?<eos> - "Only You."<eos> Did your dad teach you that move?<eos> He said it always works.<eos> Did with me.
Infidels are on their way.<eos> Call up the reserves. Get every man on the parapet, and patrol every hall.<eos> And, you, give me your helm.<eos> The ladle and the caldron have special protection spells.<eos> This helmet and our friends do not.
Why would she do that?<eos> What does she need you for?<eos> From the looks of things, she's casting a spell to steal my magic.<eos> Why does she need more dark magic?<eos> I don't.
And then I spent the night at the downtown Canyon Spa.<eos> Were you alone?<eos> Uh, Mr. Weber, we apologize, but for the sake of your daughter, we need you to cooperate.<eos> You and your wife, you have a good relationship?<eos> We do, yes.
Aw. I noticed on Facebook that they were your favorite.<eos> Oh, that's so thoughtful.<eos> See, most men wouldn't know what to send.<eos> But you know what I like.<eos> Yes, yes I do.
He said he knew my dad?<eos> Yeah, they used to run in the same circle.<eos> - What was that thing you gave him?<eos> - It doesn't matter.<eos> The hell it doesn't.
Oh, I don't know.<eos> I watch TV.<eos> I eat.<eos> I like sandwiches.<eos> Who doesn't?
Then we have a deal.<eos> You wanna tell me what kind of kickback you're getting?<eos> Excuse me?<eos> You went behind my back.<eos> I didn't do anything behind your back.
You wanna tell me what kind of kickback you're getting?<eos> Excuse me?<eos> You went behind my back.<eos> I didn't do anything behind your back.<eos> I did it in front of your face.
What?<eos> Oh... Oh!<eos> I mean, uh I-if I... If I stand up straight, it, uh, goes away, doesn't it?<eos> Uh...<eos> Oh, no. It doesn't.
There, I see it.<eos> Hailey's comet.<eos> My God, so cool.<eos> Did you see it?<eos> Yeah, I did.
- Mm-hmm.<eos> - Oh, yeah. Obviously you don't have a gun.<eos> - No.<eos> - Yes.<eos> - No, we don't.
And that is how people wind up shot.<eos> That is exactly why we shouldn't have a gun in the house.<eos> Babe, I get it.<eos> And I shouldn't want one, either, especially after what just happened.<eos> But I do.
Ruby, I told you I don't like the kids eating a sugary breakfast on a school day.<eos> Since when is Thursday a school day?<eos> Besides, I have a right to spoil my grandbabies.<eos> Now, who wants ice cream?<eos> - I do!
Ha! That sounds so much worse than it is.<eos> Well, here's what happened.<eos> So, Dre had a screaming match with his dad over the fried Christmas chicken, and then we went upstairs to have our secret Christmas in the closet and our hamper Turkey, and Dre had already thrown his dirty underwear<eos> [chuckles] On top of the Turkey, so... [Inhales deeply] And then the goldfish died.<eos> She did?
When the kids and I had that great deep talk.<eos> My kids?<eos> I'm the truth fairy.<eos> Although, I don't remember talking about the Sudan.<eos> Oh, yeah, yeah, I do.
-I live outside Santa Fe now.<eos> -Oh.<eos> -[sighs] Think everyone here read my book?<eos> -I didn't.<eos> Of course you didn't.
It must sound shallow, but to be able to hold this, even through the plastic, just for a moment; it comforts me.<eos> I gave him this for our twenty-fifth anniversary.<eos> It's engraved, "To my one and only".<eos> Did you notice that?<eos> Yes, ma'am, we did.
I'll admit that.<eos> But Billy, look around the table.<eos> Move your head around and just take it all in.<eos> We are your family and we want you to feel comfortable in our home.<eos> Well, I don't.
He didn't even seem to know what scripture was.<eos> Or maybe you're just looking for any excuse to find fault with him.<eos> Excuse me. Or maybe hiring someone sight unseen over the Internet was a bad idea.<eos> Do you wanna spend another year looking for a new pastor?<eos> Because I don't.
Zoom has Linda.<eos> He's on the roof.<eos> Put her down.<eos> You like to fish with bait?<eos> I do too.
My dearest Aurora, compulsion is not my only party trick.<eos> I do not like these threats.<eos> Our continued existence depends on the Mikaelsons.<eos> We've known that since Finn and Kol died.<eos> Unfortunately, so does every other vampire in the world.
Then you have my proxy.<eos> Harvey, I talked to Alyssa Lang And there's something you should know.<eos> Let me guess, she batted her eyes, told you a sob story,<eos> And now you think she's some kind of innocent.<eos> No, I don't.
Yeah, it's all over the Internet.<eos> They keep mentioning classified documents-- are they the same ones Laura Sutton was writing about last week?<eos> One would assume.<eos> He said as much on the video.<eos> - Who did?
I'm okay.<eos> You always say that, but are you really? I am.<eos> I mean, for the time being, at least.<eos> Did you find the man you were looking for?<eos> Yeah, I did, but...
I agree, but not like this.<eos> Radical Islam must be eradicated, root and branch.<eos> My premier understands this.<eos> Bashar al-Assad understands.<eos> Only your president does not.
Why can't he be reached?<eos> Remember, this man had already been illegally imprisoned once before.<eos> One could argue that in extraordinary times the state is justified in taking extraordinary measures.<eos> I used to believe that.<eos> I really did.
I know how much our mother hurt you.<eos> But you knew I needed her.<eos> You treated me fairly, like a brother.<eos> Helped me understand that you want what's best for me.<eos> You both do.
Did you speak with Alex White or the nanny?<eos> We've already let Monica go.<eos> That's not gonna solve the problem.<eos> Well, you see, we don't have a problem.<eos> You do.
Barry!<eos> Why not?<eos> Ok, are you planning on giving me a hair sample to run forensics on in the near future?<eos> Yeah...<eos> Well, I did.
The only part I don't get is you don't even really seem to like him.<eos> It's kind of a complicated relationship.<eos> Hmm. Like most 4,000 year old relationships are, I guess.<eos> A week ago, I was a barista and I really didn't have a plan for what I was going to do with my life.<eos> And now you do?
Come on.<eos> Do it, Lily.<eos> You're wrong about so many things.<eos> I never had the courage to tell you before...<eos> But I do now.
She's loving, protective, kind.<eos> But just to you.<eos> That's fair. She does always think of me first.<eos> Maybe I'm spoiled or old-fashioned, but it's nice having that one person who doesn't need anything from you, who just loves you and thinks you're the most amazing, beautiful girl in the whole world, you know?<eos> Maybe... maybe you don't.
You two need a lesson in women.<eos> Could the lesson not be yours to learn, Rebekah?<eos> Didn't you damn one of them to eternity, viciously antagonize the other?<eos> Those lunatics actually believe the prophecy.<eos> You don't, do you?
- Eleanor.<eos> - What?<eos> Last night... you said you liked it when I said your name.<eos> - I did?<eos> - Mm-hm. - I do.
- What?<eos> Last night... you said you liked it when I said your name.<eos> - I did?<eos> - Mm-hm. - I do.<eos> I do.
Where is this coming from?<eos> I, you know, I...<eos> I thought I really knew you, and I unpacked those boxes...<eos> Honey, of course, you know me.<eos> Of course you do.
My job covers a wide range of responsibilities.<eos> You ever heard of Bankers Trust in Sacramento?<eos> Maybe you've heard of Simon Kincaid.<eos> I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> Yeah, you do.
Face it.<eos> Who I am, my neatness, my control, my ambition.<eos> You don't like me.<eos> - Don't put it back on me.<eos> - No, you don't.
- I'm hungry.<eos> - Yes. - Are you hungry?<eos> - Yes, I'm always hungry.<eos> You know I love you, right?<eos> I do.
Are you letting me go?<eos> They love you.<eos> - They do?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Everyone does.
No.<eos> No. He just left. He said he'd come back when he got things sorted out.<eos> I can't make him, I've tried. I'll find him.<eos> You don't have to do this, Luke. You don't have to get involved.<eos> I do.
Thank you.<eos> For what?<eos> For opening me up again.<eos> I wasn't even sure if my heart worked anymore.<eos> But it does.
No, I don't.<eos> I don't see at all.<eos> Well, what did you two talk about?<eos> - Outside of work?<eos> - We didn't.
Neither one less nor more real than the other.<eos> I took care of his mind and she took care of his other needs.<eos> He didn't know?<eos> No.<eos> Except he did.
Yes, that's him.<eos> Yeah, I saw his picture on the news; that's why I called.<eos> He told us that his name was Leo Parks.<eos> How do you know him?<eos> I don't.
Good to see you.<eos> Are you well?<eos> You made a gift of his own son's head?<eos> - How did this lord react?<eos> - He did nothing.
It's a fact.<eos> Look, I don't know how much longer you think I'm gonna put up with it, but you need to watch your mouth.<eos> Yeah, or what?<eos> You don't want to go there, Jack.<eos> The hell I don't.
This time it's on me.<eos> God, I'm so stupid.<eos> Amanda, don't.<eos> I believed him.<eos> We all did.
He was making very good scratch from the sales.<eos> Which probably seemed like small potatoes once he found out how much bank Nina was putting away.<eos> Yeah, with all the publicity she and April were getting, he turned it into his own cottage industry.<eos> You wondered how she paid for all the makeup?<eos> She didn't.
- I'm wearing it now.<eos> Have a sniff. - Let's see.<eos> Nice.<eos> I told you it suited you.<eos> Yes, you did.
But I'm also not ready to give up on this place.<eos> It was the future I wanted to build.<eos> I don't think mother nature felt the same way.<eos> I really cared about it.<eos> I still do...
Sisters who always believed that you were good enough.<eos> I've been thinking.<eos> Maybe we should get a lawyer, see what they would suggest we do.<eos> I've been...<eos> Doing some thinking, too, and...
I just wanted the money.<eos> I try to be a good Bali man, I get nothing. I try to be an American... it's much worse, man.<eos> Maybe I did something terrible in last life.<eos> After all this, Vin... you can't still possibly believe in karma.<eos> Of course I do.
(laughing) Man, you guys were hilarious.<eos> - Oh, thanks.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> How come you don't have your own podcast?<eos> Oh, we did, years ago.
- Frank Adkins?<eos> - Yeah. I'm Detective Griffin.<eos> This is Detective Burkhardt.<eos> You want to tell us what happened?<eos> Yeah, I do.
But when I did that, there was no one around to give me hope or tell me when I was being stupid!<eos> Fine.<eos> You're being stupid. So stop it.<eos> Right now, we have to clean up this mess.<eos> No. We don't.
"But do you want us to put a hose on you, keep you moist, so we can return you to the sea, Blackfish?"<eos> It's fucked up.<eos> And that's not how it is for the dudes at all, okay? Like, I just happened to see the movie "Zookeeper."<eos> Did you ever see that movie?<eos> Okay, if you didn't, don't, all right?
You're here.<eos> It was so quiet over there.<eos> Well, I'm a super quiet breather.<eos> Which is not why I called you here today.<eos> Which I did not...
But it's your journey, your point of view.<eos> - That was crazy right?<eos> - Yeah!<eos> Great, though.<eos> Me doing the story?
What did you do?<eos> She had a gun.<eos> What did you do?<eos> - She had a gun.<eos> - No she didn't!
_<eos> _<eos> I know you were hallucinating last night.<eos> Irisa told you?<eos> Yeah, she did.
- You've just been given an examination of your magical aptitude.<eos> - "Magical"?<eos> - We had reason to believe you possess certain... nascent abilities. - Okay.<eos> I mean, I used to think that...<eos> - And perhaps you did at one time.
How about we were supposed to be layin' low, Les.<eos> How about-- who the hell died and made you the boss, man?<eos> As I remember, you were out making a Booty call. Hey!<eos> She ain't got nothin' to do with this.<eos> The hell she don't.
I knew you've been wanting one.<eos> Quentin, this... this is so nice!<eos> - You like it?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Yeah, I do.
Shit, shit.<eos> I've got a call. - What?<eos> Do you know this?<eos> 432-Texas?<eos> I don't.
From edema.<eos> He needs dialysis.<eos> Ask them for a machine.<eos> No, we're gonna have to place a vas-cath.<eos> You ever done one before?
I know.<eos> I won't lie for them.<eos> No. We just want to know if you saw Catherine and Caleb the night Helena was killed.<eos> No.<eos> No one on my staff did.
That's nowhere near where they found her car, so if that's me on that tape...<eos> Don't you get it now?<eos> Someone's framing us.<eos> Where'd you find that footage of Caleb?<eos> I didn't.
You need to get some rest.<eos> Just try and sleep.<eos> These are her clothes.<eos> Do you have her license?<eos> I do.
Did he have something to do with your job?<eos> The one we don't talk about?<eos> Sorry. I don't mean to push.<eos> When you were an operative, how did you know when you were in too deep?<eos> I didn't.
I don't have, like, a lot of time.<eos> Actually, like, I feel like<eos> I want... want this.<eos> I want this.<eos> I do.
I see.<eos> Did he tell you why he did it?<eos> Why, money, of course.<eos> You humans, you love your money, don't you?<eos> Yes. Yes, we do.
You guys miss him too.<eos> No, we don't.<eos> Right, Stuart?<eos> [chuckles] Does the moon miss the sun?<eos> Of course we do.
That he saw a skeleton?<eos> What skeleton?<eos> "I don't know what skeleton.<eos> I didn't see it.<eos> But the patient did.
Hey!<eos> Black.<eos> Black. Pink, black.<eos> I like pink. Go with pink.<eos> Of course you do.
And what about Mateo?<eos> Mateo's involved, so, I need to do everything I can to make sure we all get along.<eos> 'Cause we're gonna be in each other's lives forever.<eos> Okay, you just said "forever."<eos> I did, didn't I?
We take a second to reorient ourselves, and then we keep going.<eos> Pliers.<eos> This tumor is attached to everything.<eos> So, that means we close, right?<eos> No, it does not.
I got to book a few hours with you later.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> 6:00 at my home.<eos> I assume you have some sort of transportation, you got a skateboard, pogo stick, big boy bike.<eos> Sure, yeah, I do, but, uh...
What are you doing up so early?<eos> Oh, nothing, just going through this old box of stuff.<eos> Does that have something to do with you seeing Trevor last night?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, it does.
Anyway, it doesn't matter.<eos> She doesn't even know that I'm here and not there.<eos> Oh, no.<eos> Yeah, she knows.<eos> Everyone does.
I came to see Kevin. Is he okay?<eos> Why was he in the gym?<eos> Did he have to get stitches?<eos> You're asking questions like you care.<eos> While, Kevin, on the other hand, does not.
Very sorry about the situation with the food.<eos> I called the grocer, and no one knows where Barry is.<eos> They just think they can do whatever they want.<eos> And I really don't care if I ever see Barry again.<eos> I really don't.
I'll open the tailgate just wide enough for you to hop inside.<eos> And you can do that?<eos> Don't you trust me?<eos> Oh, yeah, that's right.<eos> You don't.
He would deliver Mullens and the money to me.<eos> It's a hell of a stretch.<eos> Hauser was my sergeant before he was my captain.<eos> We rode for two years, you don't know him the way I do.<eos> The way I did.
We're working on a new case.<eos> Case?<eos> So, are we both cops now?<eos> I know you got your pieces of the puzzle, too.<eos> - You always do.
If our vic was doing research for his book and he asked too many questions, Milton here might have gotten suspicious and taken Dave out.<eos> Okay.<eos> He did come to my house, but I didn't kill him...<eos> I swear. - So, how do you know him?<eos> - I don't.
Yeah, this is Captain Beckett.<eos> Do we still have the seized heroin from the Vulcan Simmons case?<eos> Hang on. Let me check.<eos> Yeah, I'll hold.<eos> Yes, we do.
I-I told her to do that.<eos> Why in the hell would you do that?<eos> Well, I thought our "midnight run" stratagem needed a little twist.<eos> Trust me, guys... if this works, we're gonna have him on a whole lot more than just obstruction.<eos> What if it doesn't?
Plus, Digital's now inundated because of the bombing story, I...<eos> How does Cat do it?<eos> She's Ms. Grant.<eos> And she has you.<eos> Well, so do you.
I think I'd fight for it.<eos> I already put that behind me, Kara.<eos> I don't want to go back there.<eos> I don't want to do that again.<eos> Who does?
If you want to stop him, you'll have to cease any Neural function from his creator.<eos> You'll have to kill me.<eos> You don't have to throw your life away...<eos> The red tornado is my life.<eos> You did it.
♪ ♪<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> You just got here.<eos> Look, Steve, it's not that I don't love you.<eos> I do.
Gabriel wants me to transfer all my assets to a holding company he controls.<eos> Gabriel got away with the money that was meant to buy his freedom from the Yakuza.<eos> Without it, we're both dead.<eos> It's not that I don't love you.<eos> I do.
I gather one of our key suspects in this case is a student, Nate Hedesan.<eos> You were keeping tabs on him?<eos> Yes, and I lost him, sir.<eos> To be fair, we don't know if there's any link between Nate Hedesan and Annapurna Kinneson.<eos> Actually, we do.
"Work alone is noble"?<eos> Bit outdated, isn't it?<eos> Being noble.<eos> I'm not sure I even know what it means any more.<eos> Yeah, you do.
Won every frame.<eos> That's incredible, Sylvester.<eos> You got on a motorcycle.<eos> I told you I'd get the job done.<eos> Yeah, you did, at... at that.
Come on. Even doctor to doctor?<eos> 'Cause my B.P.'s down, got a little bit of a cold.<eos> Might be the sildenafil, which is funny.<eos> Guy who suggested it normally doesn't make mistakes.<eos> I didn't this time, either.
Definitely.<eos> Okay, now I really want to talk to the Noodle House mystery man find out who he is, and why he was fighting with Zac.<eos> Agreed. We'll ask the manager for the security footage for when Zac came in.<eos> Maybe we'll be able to spot the mystery man.<eos> Jake, we just did that.
Run, all of you! Run!<eos> Stay back, or this one dies.<eos> Let the kid go.<eos> Just put down your knife. Come on.<eos> Just do it.
I got the good stuff.<eos> I've got to be ready to go in, in case something breaks on the Sam Garper case.<eos> How did training go today?<eos> First time.<eos> Your guy did fine.
Bring the generals, and I'll bring Ukraine.<eos> I'll see what I can do.<eos> Well, Mike B's furious.<eos> He saw the picture, too?<eos> Of course he did.
Careful, Dash.<eos> More than any kid should ever have to.<eos> It was too much for too long to forget.<eos> And you want to forget.<eos> No, I don't.
She was your principal.<eos> - Really?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Does she remember me?<eos> Of course she doesn't. Nobody does.
Okay. ATF already knew that they had sold 50 pounds of the explosives to a Filipino arms dealer named Ramon Santos.<eos> I was able to get in undercover as a middleman between Santos and Madison's guys.<eos> We set up a buy, everything was going smoothly until the sale went down.<eos> Then... you saw the rest.<eos> Yeah, we did.
You went to Lisbon?<eos> Twice.<eos> I never know where I'm going or what I'm supposed to do until I have to do it, but... I mean, there are sections of H.W. all over the world.<eos> Do they pay you for this?<eos> Actually, yeah, they do.
YOUNG MAN: Hey, your costume's really cute.<eos> Thanks. I made it myself.<eos> Nice.<eos> YOUNG MAN: So how do you know Dave?<eos> I don't.
LEONARD: Buddy, I know me moving in with Penny feels like a big change, but it's not.<eos> How can you say that?<eos> Amy's gone, and you two are married now, so it's only a matter of time before you're gone, too.<eos> Okay, you don't know what's gonna happen.<eos> No, I do.
- I have to wait for Adam.<eos> Maggie's the one who helped you after the bomb went off, right?<eos> She pinkie-sweared that the baby and I were gonna be okay.<eos> I did?<eos> Of course I did.
That's why she took Mateo. Tell him to move on.<eos> Just tell him how you feel, Jane.<eos> Don't, Jane.<eos> Don't say it.<eos> Don't, really, don't!
The place next to Super Cuts?<eos> And Crown Books and Kay-Bee Toys, and a dozen other locations throughout North Jersey.<eos> He's even hinted there may be franchise opportunities for a few select close friends.<eos> You like frozen yogurt? God, no.<eos> Nobody does except for fatties and 14-year-olds.
But you didn't.<eos> That bomb was fake.<eos> That's because I knew you were coming.<eos> I just knew it.<eos> But what if I didn't?
Are you ready to talk? He's lying.<eos> Okay, so you gonna tell me more or you just gonna go out on the mystery tip?<eos> Two seconds before that agent walked into his office, Hornstock's stress level was through the roof.<eos> Then he's in there talking about fishing and watching TV.<eos> Ira Hornstock doesn't do small talk.
You like?<eos> It's my roommate's.<eos> I literally had nothing to wear until she gave me a free pass to raid her closet.<eos> I thought this was a good look for work because I wear this dress like someone's paying me to.<eos> Oh, as do I with this.
- So you sent death-threats to Terrence Van Doren and then ran his car into the Hudson with Isabel Van Doren inside.<eos> I was in bed with my wife when that crash happened.<eos> - You can ask her. - We will.<eos> Maybe one of your biker buddies wanted some highway justice, huh?<eos> They all did, but not with violence.
Because he's in advertising.<eos> Yeah, well, i hope the second thing i need to know Is something i need to know.<eos> Yeah, fozzie asked me to remind you To read the sketch he wrote for the show.<eos> [ music continues ] [ sighs ] i already read it.<eos> I did, too.
- H-unh! - I have Yolanda.<eos> I got her slippers with headlights so she can have her midnight snack in safety.<eos> Okay, wait a minute. Wait a minute.<eos> Okay, raise your hand if you have Yolanda.<eos> I did.
What, landscape designers?<eos> Landscapes.<eos> Well, you don't have to imagine how annoying it is To be held captive by some blowhard<eos> Yapping about their personal life.<eos> We certainly don't.
- Yeah.<eos> Hmm. Let me look that up in my lady translator.<eos> - What? - Boop-boop-boop-boop.<eos> Ah, look at that.. She wants a gift.<eos> - She does?
Can you give us a minute, Deadly?<eos> Kermit.<eos> You seem to be under the false impression that I want to be in this room.<eos> - Huh? - You don't know me.<eos> No one does.
We keep it loose.<eos> Murray, you need to do this!<eos> Now go up there and tell him he has a beautiful body before he believes he doesn't.<eos> And so my dad set off to tell me I had a beautiful body.<eos> Hey. Uh... How you doing?
What do you know about underground boxing?<eos> Human dog fighting. People die.<eos> You don't want to bet on that.<eos> No, no, no. I didn't bet on it.<eos> I did it.
We don't have to be.<eos> Really, Mom, I know how to do this.<eos> - No, you don't.<eos> - Ugh!<eos> Yes, she does.
Hey, so, any word on the exam?<eos> - Stop it.<eos> - You're gonna jinx it.<eos> Okay, okay.<eos> Done.
And not your partner?<eos> I should hit you upside the head right now.<eos> I'm taking you.<eos> Aww, you care.<eos> Of course I do.
He trusted you.<eos> - Hey, you Ben Forsick?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - How do you know Roxy Richards?<eos> - I don't.
I wanna talk to Charlie Volkens.<eos> You got any idea where you are, sport?<eos> You know what we do here?<eos> Asher Sutton, he has nothing to do with this.<eos> Yeah, he does.
You got any idea where you are, sport?<eos> You know what we do here?<eos> Asher Sutton, he has nothing to do with this.<eos> Yeah, he does.<eos> Tonight he does.
You can post a photo on Instagram.<eos> I don't think so.<eos> If you really had anything on us, you wouldn't be down here trying to see us naked.<eos> Oh, we've got something.<eos> Or... rather, one of you does.
Afraid you can't handle me?<eos> I'm Thanos' daughter!<eos> I worked for Ronan.<eos> Tell me you never wondered if I had something to do with the destruction of your family!<eos> I didn't, but...
Fowler's wife, Taylor, was a murder-for-hire. I figured he took off, given the suspicion that he was somehow involved.<eos> But my APB got no hits.<eos> I'd like to take a look at anything you have on him.<eos> - If you don't mind.<eos> - He doesn't.
They look so expensive.<eos> They are.<eos> We just wanted to say we're sorry.<eos> We were way out of line to think we knew what was best for you.<eos> Even though we do.
I'll meet you three on the command deck.<eos> - Kanan, they knew about Ahsoka.<eos> - I'll tell her.<eos> Did you know there was more than one?<eos> No, I didn't.
we don't encourage prostitution.<eos> Is this a sting?<eos> Because you have to show me your badge if I ask you.<eos> Boss, their show is on Channel 7... you know, with the duck.<eos> - That does the weather.
You know that.<eos> No one wants this hot potato.<eos> They disappear, we all sleep easy.<eos> My agency had plans for them.<eos> Yeah, well, who didn't?
What'd I tell ya?<eos> I'm not buying the accent.<eos> What's to buy?<eos> Russell, most people who work in a Chinese restaurant have an accent.<eos> But not all of them do, and yet all of them do.
Look at all of you.<eos> What do you want?<eos> What can you want?<eos> Do I give a damn?<eos> I do.
You know what the best part of tonight was?<eos> It wasn't just me against Earl.<eos> It was us against him.<eos> I liked that.<eos> I did too. Yeah.
And, uh... Sorry if I was a little tough on ya.<eos> You mean you treating me like a punching bag? It's okay.<eos> Really.<eos> I got baggage, too, Donna.<eos> Everyone does.
Manipulation.<eos> You only believe what he wants you to believe.<eos> Exactly.<eos> You don't know what he is like at all.<eos> We certainly do.
But I don't do it.<eos> You're a better woman than me.<eos> And if I don't deserve to die, then you definitely don't.<eos> I'm sorry you feel alone in your pain, but so do I.<eos> So does everybody.
I've got zero, zippo, nada to do with these negotiations other than cheering them on from the sideline...<eos> If you were to let it slip that you had reservations about the treaty...<eos> But I don't.<eos> I assure you, Mr. President...<eos> But if you did.
Have you ever... lied to someone's face when your back was completely against the wall to get what you wanted?<eos> Have you ever looked someone in the eye and made them think you loved them? Really truly loved them so you could take whatever it is you needed from them?<eos> I believe him.<eos> My gut says he's telling the truth.<eos> Of course it does.
I was unavailable before.<eos> You liked me unavailable.<eos> I don't know you available.<eos> She got this side of you.<eos> She did this part.
Following your tattoos got us here and got us shot at.<eos> The tattoos led to Guerrero.<eos> Why send us out here just to kill us?<eos> How'd they know we'd be in this exact spot at this exact moment - to see the derricks?<eos> - They didn't.
That's why Ross went to confront you at the sandwich shop.<eos> And when you didn't approve the Aaron Rodgers trade, he was gonna oust you as commissioner.<eos> You can't prove anything.<eos> That's when a fight escalated. You grabbed your little meat holder there and stabbed him two times.<eos> How did you...?
Thank you.<eos> Eh. Anybody could've done it.<eos> Right place at the right time. No. You put in the work.<eos> I underestimated you.<eos> Why did you do that?
I have some questions.<eos> Of course.<eos> Frank helped you, right?<eos> It's not like you and Annalise carried that body into the woods.<eos> He did.
I understand why you did it.<eos> This can't be an easy decision for you to make.<eos> Then don't make me make it.<eos> I wish I had that much power.<eos> You do.
'Cause there are those guys who, they buy a cow, and then on the side, total matador, but...<eos> But, for real, Chicago, why buy the cow?<eos> Let's be real. Why buy the cow?<eos> Because you love her.<eos> You really do.
Excuse me, I think I found it...<eos> - How you guys doing?<eos> - Oh, my god!<eos> About time, I'm sorry. I'm about to come a little late.<eos> How you doing?
- How you guys doing?<eos> - Oh, my god!<eos> About time, I'm sorry. I'm about to come a little late.<eos> How you doing?<eos> How you doing?
I just want to say... Thank you for your service.<eos> Yeah, what service are you thanking me for?<eos> Your service... It's empty if you don't know what you're talking about.<eos> You went to Kabul, right?<eos> - Yes, I did.
You get to make that choice.<eos> But so do I.<eos> Today I crossed a line I never thought I would. I'm pretty sure I broke the law.<eos> I damn well know I broke my own moral code.<eos> I did it for you.
Oh, oh, oh, okay, okay, okay, okay.<eos> - I have this reoccurring dream, right? - Mm-hmm.<eos> Where, um, I'm sick, and-and someone's taking care of me.<eos> But I've never been able to see their face. Hmm!<eos> But last night, last night, I did.
Right now, I have to go handle a bitch.<eos> Ms. Keating, did we have an appointment?<eos> I thought your schedule would be clear now that your star witness has abandoned you.<eos> Mr. Millstone and I still have to talk about that.<eos> No, you don't.
It was clever of you to use her love of sweepstakes to bring in a RAT-ed computer so you could watch her.<eos> Socially engineering and spying on your own mother?<eos> It doesn't get lower than that. Now, now, Avery Ryan.<eos> You have no idea who you're dealing with.<eos> Actually, I do, Dante Wilkerson.
Those are the people that we... People that laid on that table and depended on me to help them, to find the answers that solved their murders.<eos> I did that.<eos> Me.<eos> So I'm not staying just because I worry about you.<eos> Which I do.
I remember trying pot for the first time.<eos> Coke.<eos> I remember the first time I kissed someone.<eos> I remember that time I saw "Titanic".<eos> Ah, you did, didn't you?
You think you can talk him out of this?<eos> There's no talking. We have to hit him with everything we've got.<eos> Well, it's not his fault.<eos> He didn't want to become the Dark One.<eos> But he did because of me.
And I think that she thinks I'm great, but I need you to find out.<eos> Sure.<eos> Why don't you write her a little note... you know, the ones with the boxes that you can check... and I'll pass it along.<eos> Don't you think that sounds a little childish?<eos> Yes, it does!
- Stop it!<eos> Get your hands off me!<eos> - And so this was three years ago?<eos> That would explain why the piano teacher dropped out midway through that season.<eos> So did Graham.
- To watch our backs.<eos> - Check this out.<eos> Driving while NYPD.<eos> - License and registration?<eos> - How you doing, officer?
They were married for 60 years, had five children, plenty of grandchildren.<eos> Mm-hmm.<eos> I want the same for us, Kono.<eos> You just have to believe.<eos> I do.
Every human has a right to a safe space.<eos> It cannot be entered.<eos> Yeah, it can.<eos> Watch.<eos> Wow, how did you --
I do.<eos> And a conventional defensive strategy isn't gonna cut it.<eos> Which is why we have to be creative like them.<eos> But unless you're here to tell me that you found...<eos> I did.
Claire, Dad, this is Dr. Zanetti.<eos> Russel is being prepped for surgery right now, and she and I will perform the operation.<eos> Okay.<eos> You must have a lot of faith in him.<eos> I do.
They caught you in another lie, but...<eos> They need corroborating evidence.<eos> Right.<eos> And they couldn't have fired her unless they already had some evidence that she lied on her résumé.<eos> Did they, Kristen?
It's an ironic nickname because he's the least homosexual man you can possibly imagine.<eos> He's gorgeous and Spanish.<eos> All the women fancy him.<eos> Is he?<eos> Do they?
See, ever since I was a little boy, I wanted a dog like you.<eos> Not 'cause you could jet-ski or break-dance or deflect grenades with your paws.<eos> I just wanted a friend.<eos> And I didn't have many growing up.<eos> But I do now.
Reaper, don't do this.<eos> Yo, you better stay out the way.<eos> They killed Imani!<eos> No.<eos> No, they didn't.
I don't know how to do it. I don't know how to shut it off.<eos> Shut what off?<eos> How I feel... - Yeah.<eos> - About her.<eos> I don't...
I want a miniature version of me with matching tail rings to love and hold and name.<eos> Move it Maurice, the baby isn't gonna make itself.<eos> Go get me one!<eos> King Julien, you do know where babies come from, right?<eos> Of course I do, Maurice.
Ahem, it is Clover, Your Majesty.<eos> King Julien, this is amazing!<eos> You've found the first Pan troglodytes ever recorded on the island.<eos> Is that another word for Martian?<eos> Because then yes, I did. No, King Julien.
You know, I don't know.<eos> It just came to me.<eos> It's like the gods cracked open my head and just screamed it real loud.<eos> But, uh, King Julien, we don't have any doctors.<eos> Ah, but we do, Clover.
- Hey.<eos> - Hi. So, is this a six-month anniversary surprise?<eos> No, it isn't.<eos> - Because you didn't know.<eos> - I did.
And for the record, I only use that word when the Islanders cheat.<eos> You mean when the Rangers cheat.<eos> Okay. Thanks for letting me stay for dinner.<eos> I needed a little family time after today.<eos> No worries. I did too.
Thanks, Mama.<eos> Thank you, Pa.<eos> Merry Christmas.<eos> - Don't you like it?<eos> Yes, of course I do.
True friends do not pass judgment on each other.<eos> And if he isn't promoted and remains penniless, will you desist in seeing him?<eos> He will get his promotion, then he will call on Father officially to ask for his blessing.<eos> Fortunately, I don't need yours.<eos> No, you don't.
I thought you should know, Mr Bucket is looking for you.<eos> Here, was he?<eos> A fleeting visit.<eos> Funny he came here looking, when all the time he knew where I lived.<eos> He did?
He hadn't seen or heard from Lily all day.<eos> Is this her iPad?<eos> What's the password?<eos> She doesn't have a password.<eos> Yeah, she does.
Stella.<eos> That was her name. Stella.<eos> Does she have a last name?<eos> I don't remember that, but she used to work in the museum.<eos> But she probably still does.
He went to the FBI.<eos> He was trying to do the right thing.<eos> And it got him shot.<eos> Do you have children, Agent Gibbs?<eos> I did.
I don't even know where to begin. It was terrible.<eos> Thank you, Mr. Hodda.<eos> You were the manager of the building, though.<eos> Did you order the concrete or did the drug addicts?<eos> I did.
This is about you and you can tell me anything.<eos> You know that.<eos> I know.<eos> You know how much I love you, right?<eos> I do.
No. I can't say that I do.<eos> Do you know anything about a vigilante crime fighter who called himself "The Fog"?<eos> - The Frog?<eos> - The Fog.<eos> No, I don't.
Well, I remember.<eos> 'Cause I almost had to go back to that.<eos> But somehow, I got a second chance.<eos> Look, I deserve everything I got, you know?<eos> And in a way, Phil does, too.
Aubrey, we've noticed from your medical records that you've lost quite a few pounds over the last year.<eos> From diet and exercise.<eos> You don't have a prescription for thyroid medication, but we've known some girls to sneak their mom's pills.<eos> Do you have a prescription, Mrs. Clark?<eos> Yes, I do.
Yes, I do.<eos> I've never taken my mom's pills.<eos> The only thing I take are my vitamins.<eos> Mom, you believe me, right?<eos> Yes, honey, of course I do.
OK, yeah, yeah.<eos> All right.<eos> By the way, I have cold sores.<eos> Do you really?<eos> I didn't...
It's one of the few sports that focuses on a team of individuals.<eos> You see, the cyclist needs the rest of his team to get out in front, provide a wake, so he can draft on them.<eos> I'm not sure I follow.<eos> You want Squad Three to be the best squad in the city, right?<eos> I do.
I'm not sure I follow.<eos> You want Squad Three to be the best squad in the city, right?<eos> I do.<eos> And you have an idea, a vision, on how to make that happen, I assume?<eos> Of course you do.
Jethro, store manager.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I thought you'd be older.<eos> It says on your CV you were previously a pilot?<eos> My mum done it.
- What'd I do?<eos> - Huh. Look who it is.<eos> Hey, Officer Collins.<eos> Uh, did your son win his game?<eos> Yeah, he did actually.
New Orleans.<eos> The Big Easy... just got hard.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Well, I don't think he needed that.<eos> No, he did not.
I'll see you on the dance floor.<eos> You ought to get back there. This stuff's free.<eos> - Quiet all around!<eos> - I hate to admit it, but Olyphant's got something.<eos> Yes, he certainly does.
Wow.<eos> And that's why I slipped rat poison into your drink earlier.<eos> And you're going to be dead... any minute now.<eos> So you want me to die?<eos> Yes, I do.
- My tits hurt.<eos> - Get over here.<eos> They hate us here.<eos> We're scum!<eos> No, they don't.
You wouldn't know anything about that, would you?<eos> No, not at all.<eos> You have to be kidding me.<eos> Kidding?<eos> No, we don't do that.
Hey, uh, quick question-- are we sure this coffee was made this week?<eos> We found new DNA evidence that places you in the hotel room where Boyle was killed.<eos> Well, that makes sense, since I stayed there for a week while my house was being tented.<eos> We can play this however you want, but you're not going anywhere until you tell me why you killed Boyle.<eos> I didn't. Then who did?
No, I didn't... I didn't say "bus locker."<eos> I said "bus lockers," plural.<eos> He wanted to put it all over town.<eos> You don't have it.<eos> You never did.
We don't have that kind of time.<eos> Well, there's no work around.<eos> We don't have enough info on him to narrow him down.<eos> You know what?<eos> Maybe we do.
Hello.<eos> We were just looking for something.<eos> Yeah, I... I... I lost something.<eos> - I don't think we'll ever find it, do you?<eos> - No, no, I don't.
You've got an interview on Tuesday.<eos> Jeez, any more revelations?<eos> Just go along and do the interview.<eos> It'll be good practice. And if you don't get it, nothing lost.<eos> - And if I do?
I supported your parents and the messages they beamed out against the Empire.<eos> It was part of the reason I was accused of treason and sent to prison with them.<eos> I do remember.<eos> Then you know what happened to them.<eos> Yes, I do.
- Yeah, uh, Gigi, I think...<eos> - She's beautiful.<eos> Everybody says she looks like Alison, but to me, she looks like her daddy.<eos> You know what?<eos> She does to me too.
If she wrote a check, it's her money.<eos> What kind of married people don't share a fucking bank account?<eos> We're not married.<eos> I thought you had a kid together.<eos> We do.
You love me. We got a kid together.<eos> Let's stop making things so difficult for ourselves.<eos> Let's get married and settle down, be happy, be normal, raise a family.<eos> Isn't that what you want?<eos> Yeah, of course I do.
All right, we need to make a plan for what to say if the cops have questions.<eos> Well, I was thinking we would just tell the truth.<eos> Or we stick as close to the truth as possible.<eos> All right, first they're gonna ask - if we had permits and security.<eos> - Which we did.
Your own kid's involved.<eos> You wouldn't take the chance lying to the DA.<eos> Did Carter ever tell you I kidnapped her?<eos> Twice.<eos> Yeah, she did.
I know you did.<eos> I guess I didn't want to need anyone.<eos> Carter, I understand you wanting to take care of yourself after everything you've been through.<eos> It's really tough to need people.<eos> But I do.
I guess I didn't want to need anyone.<eos> Carter, I understand you wanting to take care of yourself after everything you've been through.<eos> It's really tough to need people.<eos> But I do.<eos> And I do, too.
Arrived a couple hours ago.<eos> Originated from Shanghai.<eos> We checked the manifest-- four containers are missing.<eos> How'd they get past security?<eos> They didn't.
I'll be right there waiting.<eos> Okay?<eos> It's gonna be fun, everybody.<eos> Hey.<eos> How you doing?
Okay, first of all, I don't believe that.<eos> But more importantly, we do not care about the weed, okay?<eos> You don't?<eos> No.<eos> We don't.
It means something.<eos> Not to my generation.<eos> You know how us millennials are.<eos> But you know what, if it means something to you, that must mean that you care about Bruce.<eos> Maybe I do.
I gave him the friggin'<eos> Hope Diamond to give to her! That's a $350 million diamond, Carol. He gives her this stupid piece of medical equipment?<eos> It's so cold and impersonal. And I'll tell you this much. I am done trying to help this turd.<eos> I set him up for the victory and he just tinkles on it. - I'm so done with him.<eos> Just done, D...
The whole Internal Affairs investigation.<eos> I... was trying to protect you and trying to protect NCIS, because... because John Quinn didn't kill Boyle. I did, and I did it to protect Tiffany.<eos> I know.<eos> What do you mean you know?<eos> No, you don't.
You're white.<eos> So what?<eos> Black dudes are cool.<eos> You ever seen one naked?<eos> I do all the time.
- I ain't buying this piece of shit. - What the fuck is this?<eos> Jesus, Chuck, what in the hell is wrong with all these TVs?<eos> [stammers] I don't know, Dad.<eos> We never had a problem with these before.<eos> Well, we sure as shit do now!
The Greek spirits of pain and suffering.<eos> I liked that.<eos> You also liked his plan to "KSR" Lucy Van Gaal.<eos> I did.<eos> I still do.
They were out less than 15 minutes.<eos> Is that a good or bad thing?<eos> It means the jury was swayed powerfully, but I have no idea if it was by the judge's instructions.<eos> Madam foreperson, do we have a verdict?<eos> We do, Your Honor.
The Bible?<eos> Well, that's exactly what it is.<eos> We're recording an audiobook of the Bible.<eos> Your agent not tell you?<eos> No, she didn't.
Did you find the other us in time?<eos> I couldn't get to me, but I found you.<eos> I told him to look for Goldenmire.<eos> - I just hope he listened. He was really off his face.<eos> - Oh, so do I.
- No, it's not the same-- I mean, between you and me, yes, but between normal people, it's not the same.<eos> It's something else.<eos> Maestro Rivera, he asked me to go back to Mexico and take his place.<eos> - You accepted?<eos> - No, I did not.
(Man) No, we don't.<eos> Okay, you don't.<eos> Just got to town this morning.<eos> But y'all know how I earn a living.<eos> (Man) No, we don't.
Thank you for that offer, Neon Joe.<eos> We will take it under advisement.<eos> Uh, he-yump. You make up your mind, you let me know.<eos> Y'all know where to find me.<eos> (Man) No, we don't.
Heard about your little exercise videos.<eos> Interesting choice of charity, victims of police violence.<eos> Yeah, so?<eos> Now, why do I got a sneaky feeling that all the proceeds are going to a certain mom of a particular kid that just happened to be killed dead in a hoagie-related whoopsie-doodle?<eos> So what if it does?
And he worked out a plan to get me out.<eos> But Eddie got to Dan first.<eos> But I spoke to Dan.<eos> Yeah, Dave.<eos> But you did... Not me.
You know, do you really wanna start again?<eos> A new career at your age.<eos> You love being a copper.<eos> I used to.<eos> No, you do.
Painkillers.<eos> Deep Heat.<eos> Thanks.<eos> So how do I find Eddie?<eos> Same way Daniel did.
And I know he wants Jules Hope but that's not gonna happen.<eos> You're with Jules Hope?<eos> You better star making sense.<eos> Now, I don't know where Eddie is.<eos> No-one does.
I've met a lot of interesting people, a lot of people that are similar to Steve.<eos> But I've never met somebody as cold-blooded... as him.<eos> To think what he did to that girl. Sit and think about that for a minute.<eos> - Think about her family.<eos> - Oh, I do all the time.
That was my understanding.<eos> [Buting] And they did that because they thought, "Well, if the victim had been killed here, perhaps her blood would've soaked into those cracks," right?<eos> I assume so.<eos> Did you find Teresa Halbach's DNA on any of those swabs?<eos> No, I did not.
- Yes. - No DNA of Teresa Halbach's.<eos> - Correct.<eos> By the way... in all of this evidence that you've tested, all of it, did you ever find any DNA of a gentleman named Brendan Dassey anywhere?<eos> - In all of your tests?<eos> - No, I did not.
- No, I did not.<eos> Not one shred, right?<eos> - No, I did not find his DNA.<eos> - And you had his profile.<eos> Yes, I did.
That's correct.<eos> And that is the occasion when a key was found, right?<eos> That is my understanding.<eos> [Kratz] Did you believe that either Lieutenant Lenk or Sergeant Colborn had an opportunity out of your eyesight to plant that key there?<eos> - No, they did not.
- Did you see him do it?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - No, honestly, yes or no, did you see him do it?<eos> Don't lie about it.<eos> If you did, good.
- Yeah.<eos> - No, honestly, yes or no, did you see him do it?<eos> Don't lie about it.<eos> If you did, good.<eos> If you didn't, good.
I don't know, any of this.<eos> Everything.<eos> Everything? What's the point?<eos> I mean, I sure as shit don't know.<eos> Neither does anybody else, okay?
Shit.<eos> Jesus.<eos> You know what'll happen if the word gets out that I'm with you again? Right?<eos> You know.<eos> I do, yeah.
Jesus.<eos> You know what'll happen if the word gets out that I'm with you again? Right?<eos> You know.<eos> I do, yeah.<eos> I do.
- Okay. I will.<eos> Boom, down low.<eos> This hand comes here, this hand catches the ankle. Lay your back into the guy, scoop with this leg, catch both knees, put your arm through. There's your cross ankle, all right?<eos> Nice and tight.<eos> Do it again, all right?
Walter!<eos> I...<eos> Don't think of a reason to say no, 'cause I've got a million reasons to say yes.<eos> - I know it makes no sense.<eos> - No, it doesn't...
Hey, baby. Killer party.<eos> It's a happening.<eos> So where's your stuff?<eos> We decided that this would just be Walter's show.<eos> Oh, "we" did?
I didn't think so, 'cause that's crazy.<eos> That's...<eos> What?<eos> Nothing.<eos> - You did!
James, you look at me a lot.<eos> I look at all of you.<eos> I look at all of you. You're sitting right in front of me.<eos> You're sitting right in front of me.<eos> Not like that, you don't.
Nice of him. And you.<eos> Great arrangement.<eos> - You used to laugh at my jokes.<eos> - No, I didn't.<eos> - Yes, you did.
You gotta go.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah. I'll talk to you tonight.<eos> Hi.<eos> How you doing?
Well, best get on with it, eh?<eos> Connory Slaughter...<eos> #Alpha dog... leader of the pack, do you take this bitch for... well, tonight, basically?<eos> Angelina Timmins, owner of the only bar in town... do you take...<eos> #Uh, Deke... she does.
Which you are not.<eos> Yet.<eos> Which I'm not yet.<eos> - Hey, James.<eos> - Hey, Val, how you doing?
No, I'm not going to say it.<eos> No.<eos> I'll see you at the office.<eos> Did you see that?<eos> Actually, I didn't.
Your full of shit. Now get down on your knees.<eos> - Get down on your knees!<eos> - Damien. - There's a problem. - What?<eos> The number didn't come through?<eos> No, it did.
Shift's over, Jer.<eos> - Jerry.<eos> Fiona.<eos> You said I should come by Accounting sometime.<eos> - I did?
It's the best music to ever grace God's green earth.<eos> Did that hurt? Was that hard?<eos> Did you hear that?<eos> She likes him, okay?<eos> - No, no, no, she doesn't.
Did that hurt? Was that hard?<eos> Did you hear that?<eos> She likes him, okay?<eos> - No, no, no, she doesn't.<eos> - Yes, she does.
She's Tracy's old friend. Oh, ho-ho...<eos> it's a possibility.<eos> Yeah, maybe not, no.<eos> So did you hear that Ella is coming up for the weekend, too?<eos> Yes, I did.
Thanks.<eos> I promise, tomorrow I'll take you to the park.<eos> But I'm in a mad rush today.<eos> I will be back very soon.<eos> Hey, man, how you doing?
Call the BarTemps.<eos> I did already.<eos> Super Bowl. We always use them.<eos> - So what do you need me for?<eos> - I don't.
Are you married? Why?<eos> Are you trying to pick me up?<eos> - Well, marriage is hard goddamn work.<eos> - Yeah, they don't tell you that when you're registering at Crate and Barrel, huh?<eos> No, they do not.
Cage, you've seized control of the Omega' ability to reset the day.<eos> - How' that even possible?<eos> Perhaps this organism' only vulnerability, its only vulnerability is humanity.<eos> Regardless of that, you control the power now.<eos> Just as I did in Verdun.
- To failure.<eos> - Absolutely.<eos> - Is this tour of Dublin over?<eos> - If you want.<eos> And if I don't?
You're gonna wear out the spring coil.<eos> The calibration is very sensitive.<eos> Yeah... so this is what I'm dealing with.<eos> What did you tell him?<eos> I didn't.
Once the final life was given, the prayer was spoken aloud and witnessed. And then those 12 disciples who sacrificed themselves were granted eternal salvation. And the chosen one was reborn.<eos> I mean, you know, this is early Christian mysticism.<eos> This pre-dates even the Vatican.<eos> And do you really believe this stuff?<eos> I did, yes, once.
Could you tell me precisely why you're blocking my efforts?<eos> Dr. Brookner.<eos> There are now other investigators.<eos> This is no longer only your disease, though you seem to think it is.<eos> Oh, I do, do I?
- Rose... you're so brave and strong and bold.<eos> Sadly, you'll have many other opportunities to kill Strigoi.<eos> You lied about your feelings for me.<eos> Yes.<eos> I did.
But it says it's straight on.<eos> Well, what do you want me to do?<eos> Do you want me to turn around?<eos> It's up to you.<eos> No, please, don't do that, OK?
I've been thinking about it for a while.<eos> Imagine how cool it'd be to go somewhere where no one knows you, where no one knows who you are.<eos> You could even create a new personality!<eos> - Don't you like your personality?<eos> - Yes, I do!
Oh, my God, I wonder what it is.<eos> - It's just a book.<eos> - God, you just told her.<eos> It's okay, we like books.<eos> No, we don't.
Walking where? For how long?<eos> I started out on Main Street, and I put in an application at Arby's.<eos> I don't want to work there, but my mom said that I can't afford to be picky.<eos> It's not so bad.<eos> I did it myself.
Am I under arrest or anything?<eos> Do you remember the honeysuckle?<eos> Remember that time I tried to make honeysuckle soda and sell it from a stand like lemonade? Mm-hmm.<eos> I do.<eos> I sure do.
- Gally?<eos> - Don't.<eos> He's been stung.<eos> We can't leave.<eos> We did.
Oh.<eos> Huh.<eos> Deaf and dumb, part of my job.<eos> How do I reach you?<eos> You don't.
Some smart-ass named Bigfoot.<eos> He seemed less concerned with Glen's murder than Mickey Wolfmann's disappearance.<eos> But he's a fan of yours all right.<eos> Said you might be able to help.<eos> Did he now?
But, like, the job that you have right now, like, is it something that you actually want to be doing?<eos> You know what?<eos> It can be fun.<eos> But do I love it?<eos> - You don't. - No.
I wondered how it felt to float like him.<eos> And for many nights to come, I would float above the darkness of my life.<eos> Did being the most luminous object in the galaxy justify sacrificing all earthly cares?<eos> I decided... fuck it.<eos> It didn't.
I gotta figure out what I'm gonna do with Harry.<eos> Of course I wanna save him. You know?<eos> I wanna save him because he's my best pal.<eos> And what if my blood works?<eos> But what if it doesn't?
And right on the bottom:<eos> "New England Glass company." What a great find.<eos> Guys, you wanna head upstairs to my office?<eos> Judge Warren caught it. You know him, sir?<eos> Yes, I do.
Objection.<eos> Argumentative.<eos> Let him finish.<eos> You see a man that you hate, and minutes later... you've altered your route... and both you and that man are on the same road at the same time... only you're in your car with his blood on it... and he's in a ravine with his kidneys ruptured and his back broken... and you don't remember hitting him?<eos> I do not.
Yes, I can.<eos> Where do you think she comes from?<eos> You think she has a family?<eos> Yes.<eos> She does.
What the hell, man?<eos> It's sad what you're trying to do. It's embarrassing.<eos> All right.<eos> I hate Mossi.<eos> Everybody does.
Is it confusion?<eos> Is it doubt?<eos> Is it questions?<eos> I got questions.<eos> We all do.
We play with it.<eos> That's right.<eos> And he was a good man.<eos> He was a really good man, but I don't know what he believed in.<eos> None of us did.
Hey, dude, you don't want...<eos> You do not want to get him pissed off.<eos> I wanna get him pissed off,<eos> - you pissed off, and fuck her.<eos> - No, you don't.
I don't care!<eos> I don't care!<eos> I mean, Dawson, do you want this?<eos> Do you want me?<eos> I do.
I don't care!<eos> I mean, Dawson, do you want this?<eos> Do you want me?<eos> I do.<eos> I do.
Hi, it's me, it's Amanda.<eos> I was hoping maybe we could talk.<eos> A lot of things have changed since I last saw you.<eos> And well, I just... I want to say I love you.<eos> I do, Dawson.
- Is that them?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - You can actually see them.<eos> - I told you this would work.<eos> He did it.
I don't have any money.<eos> I want you to stake me.<eos> Stake me, and I'll get your money.<eos> Why did you see Frank?<eos> I didn't.
- No. No, not at all.<eos> - That's not what I meant.<eos> - I got it. - Sir..<eos> - No, I got it.<eos> I do, really.
You pay people to load it, you pay off the cops.<eos> That's a lot of people.<eos> That's why you're here. You know everyone here, don't you?<eos> Someone has to stay there in Morocco until we return with the money.<eos> What if they don't?
What happens if I get a divorce?<eos> I think we both know that you'd never be able to come back here and... Your children would suffer the most. They are heirs to a European throne, Grace.<eos> And add to that the fact that you would have been a failure as a Princess.<eos> I don't want to say no to the movie. I don't.<eos> Well, don't.
Hey, you're gonna be great.<eos> Good luck.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Hi.<eos> How you doing?
And she call hospital for your husband, okay?<eos> Quit moving.<eos> You think you need my help, Ava?<eos> Do you need anybody's help?<eos> You don't.
You've been lying to me this whole time.<eos> You knew my husband was dead?<eos> And you tried to have me killed?<eos> You need to go.<eos> Please don't do this.
Everything.<eos> WembIey. What is this?<eos> The jellyfish commercial that you wanted.<eos> You said they were erotic yet deadly, Iike women. I never said that.<eos> -Yes, you did. -No, I didn't.
You've got the numbers all colored in your head.<eos> You can't resist because my love's got a half a life.<eos> One by one is seven, seven times.<eos> And the dealer whispers into your ear, you better bet it all. Ooh.<eos> You do the long division in your head.
You hate me.<eos> But yet you're desperate to be me?<eos> You want that role but you're not gonna get it.<eos> You don't even have the chops!<eos> I did...
That's a big thing in your book.<eos> Trying your best.<eos> It's supposed to give people major points.<eos> I don't know that girl anymore, son...<eos> Not that I ever did.
The way is clear The light is good<eos> I have no fear Nor no one should<eos> The woods are just trees The trees are just wood<eos> I sort of hate to ask it But do you have a basket?<eos> Yes, we do.
Here.<eos> Have a look.<eos> Turn it over.<eos> - Oh, I see you do know my name.<eos> - Indeed I do.
There is no loop. All right?<eos> There's me doing my job, you doing yours.<eos> Your job is to coach the team I give you.<eos> They do it different in Dallas?<eos> Yeah, they do.
Let God strike ya dead if ya don't!<eos> Lord strike me dead if I don't!<eos> Let's give it up for the cast of Great Expectations!<eos> Did you see her Grab my hand at the end there?<eos> Yeah... I did.
So I says: once more won't make any difference, then.<eos> You see the light go out in their eyes...<eos> - And you become God!<eos> - No you don't!<eos> No you don't.
- What's this one for?<eos> - Nothing!<eos> Nothing, nothing.<eos> What?<eos> I didn't...
- Let's try it again.<eos> Mr. Dunne, from what I understand, you and your wife had some bumps.<eos> Yeah, we had some tough years.<eos> I lost my job.<eos> You both did.
Want to go to the movies?<eos> I'll break your motherfucking legs!<eos> Break your legs!<eos> What?<eos> How you doing, Mr Nice Plant?
- Mm? You should be proud of your work - in the autopsy room.<eos> - Mm. I will never again be able to look at a boggy prostate - without thinking of you.<eos> - You're sweet, Woody.<eos> Do you think maybe you should tell your real daughter about what happened?<eos> Already did.
Oh, look.<eos> I found absolutely nothing over here.<eos> After you.<eos> Oh, no.<eos> I don't do first anymore.
At warfare. You know good memory, afraid of nothing.<eos> I want to be your friend.<eos> I don't need a friend.<eos> Yes, you do.<eos> Everybody does.
Un...bel...ievable.<eos> I'm telling you, man.<eos> - Galgo? - Yes, sir.<eos> I think I know why your team let you go.<eos> You do?
November 20th, 450 francs.<eos> There's no end to this.<eos> You owe me ten thousand francs, and you must begin to pay.<eos> - But I have nothing to pay you with!<eos> - Oh, but you do.
There's been a series of burglaries in the area all over the last six months.<eos> All still open.<eos> Now you don't talk to me, it's all on you, boy.<eos> Well, you know, I ain't got nothing to do with that.<eos> - Well, any idea who does?
Take some initiative and get these assholes in line.<eos> All right.<eos> Count seems to be good.<eos> Hey, Catfish, you could do me some help up here right now.<eos> How we doing up there?
No.<eos> No, the voices... they didn't tell me things.<eos> They told my mother things.<eos> So, you don't hear voices.<eos> Your mother did?
That's not real though, is it?<eos> That's just pretend.<eos> It is.<eos> I did want to take you back.<eos> I did.
It is.<eos> I did want to take you back.<eos> I did.<eos> But now I don't.<eos> I really don't.
! - What?<eos> - You shot Stephen! - Well, no.<eos> No, I didn't.<eos> - You fucking shot my husband!<eos> - No, I didn't.
You promised you would.<eos> I started but it's not so easy.<eos> She seems so much happier here.<eos> -Does she really have to know?<eos> -Yes, she does.
-Yes, she does.<eos> You have to tell her she's your child, Quirke.<eos> You owe it to her.<eos> All right.<eos> -I'll do it now.
More time at home.<eos> I understand the hours you got to work, But even when you're here, you're not here.<eos> I get it.<eos> I do.<eos> I do.
I trusted you!<eos> You are like a brother to me.<eos> And now, you wanna shoot me?<eos> Things change.<eos> But people like you never do.
I was only trying to help? Who says I need fixing?<eos> Jamie, what is this?<eos> That's mine.<eos> I didn't mean to take it.<eos> - I didn't...
Yeah.<eos> I think... yeah.<eos> - I think she'd...<eos> - She wanted that.<eos> - Yeah, she did.
- What do you reckon?<eos> - I reckon salsa's for pussies.<eos> - Isn't that what you said?<eos> - Did I?<eos> Oh, yeah, you did.
- Big news, ball bag.<eos> - What?<eos> When you were at home last night making love to your hand, guess who went disco dancing with the sexually-frustrated lady boss.<eos> - Who?<eos> - Me. I did.
It's too late, buddy. I've already cleaned it myself.<eos> Please, shut the door, I have an appointment.<eos> I love it.<eos> No kidding?<eos> I really do.
Sir, please raise your right hand.<eos> Do you solemnly swear to uphold the rules and regulations - set forth by T.B.R. Code 7286?<eos> - I do.<eos> Do you accept that any diversion from your mission parameters will result in immediate court martial? And if convicted death by lethal injection.<eos> I do.
Of course not.<eos> "I'm getting calls about a transvestite wreaking havoc in the streets."<eos> Yeah, I got it under control.<eos> I just arrested him.<eos> -"You did?"
Trust me?<eos> Do you trust me?<eos> Do you trust me?<eos> Say it.<eos> I do.
Cheers.<eos> Mike?<eos> Hey, honey.<eos> How'd you get in?<eos> I didn't.
Mr. McKinley, is there anything we can do to help?<eos> No, thanks.<eos> - Did you bring cake?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Yes we did!
- Oh, yeah.<eos> - We should film it.<eos> - Too bad we don't have a camera though.<eos> - What?<eos> - You do.
I'd stick his pictures in the window.<eos> And sell 'em, all of 'em.<eos> For two or three shillings apiece on occasion.<eos> Do you have children yourself, Mr Turner?<eos> I do not, Mrs Somerville.
No one is getting hurt, so is it really a crime?<eos> Yeah, well...<eos> I guess that's something to think about. What do you think?<eos> You think it's a crime?<eos> No, I don't.
Gets worse.<eos> We found a bag.<eos> It belongs to Greg Forsythe.<eos> - Didn't he go to school with Heather?<eos> - Yeah, John, he did.
To me, this is a wildly, wildly awkward thing.<eos> I don't know what he has in mind.<eos> You must understand, this is between you and him.<eos> You have your own relationship now.<eos> We do?
- I'm just tired.<eos> Why aren't you singing my song?<eos> Do you...?<eos> - Do you not love me anymore?<eos> - Rose, of course I do.
I never...<eos> And now that somebody actually wants me, now you wanna act like a wife.<eos> - It's a little late.<eos> - You didn't want a wife.<eos> - I did! - You didn't.
-I would be surprised.<eos> -So what about you?<eos> -What about me?<eos> Don't you ever get lonely?<eos> Who doesn't, Rose?
-I,assumed you knew.<eos> -Mal.<eos> You came!<eos> Just seeing if the old tuxedo still fits after all these years.<eos> Well, it does.
For God's sake! What is it now, Quirke?<eos> People are starting to worry about you, you know that?<eos> I spoke to Patrick Ojukwu this evening. -He confessed to performing an abortion on your sister, April, in her flat.<eos> I thought you should know that.<eos> -But then you already do, don't you?
Let's go tell dad.<eos> We'll send mom for a formal anatomy scan when she's more stable.<eos> What if she doesn't recover?<eos> We work for and pray that she does.<eos> But if she doesn't?
Well, it-it hurts under the pit a bit.<eos> Let me take a look at it.<eos> Hey, speaking of saints, you know a... a doc named Selena?<eos> Works out of a drop-in on Gerrard?<eos> No. No, I don't.
I want our boy.<eos> ♪ but that's just my see-through heart ♪<eos> They're giving me the physostigmine?<eos> Yep, and they're just gonna keep giving it to you until something happens.<eos> And if it doesn't?
Musicians get it a lot.<eos> A buddy of mine had to quit the London Symphony because his hand just stopped working.<eos> Well, I don't have focal dystonia.<eos> Good.<eos> - Because if you did...
Excuse me?<eos> I know you'll take precautions.<eos> Of course, but... you're saying my insurance company won't find out I have hep "C"?<eos> You don't.<eos> John Smith does.
Um, guys, this is kind of like a deathbed confession.<eos> I can't see your father lying about this.<eos> It's never lying to him.<eos> He thinks if you dream hard enough, dreams come true.<eos> They did that one time.
HOW ARE YOU HANDLING ALL THIS?<eos> TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH, I FEEL LIKE WE'VE GOTTEN THE RUNAROUND.<eos> I DON'T KNOW IF THAT HAS TO DO WITH LIABILITY<eos> OR MALPRACTICE, BUT THINGS LIKE THIS DON'T JUST HAPPEN.<eos> UNFORTUNATELY, SOMETIMES THEY DO.
Went down 25,000.<eos> So I tried to be scarce.<eos> Fall off the radar a minute.<eos> I tried to avoid these pricks.<eos> Honest to God, I did. I did.
Yeah!<eos> Oh, come on, come on!<eos> Yeah, yeah, yeah!<eos> You like me fucking you, don't you?<eos> I do.
Well, at the very least, this will be a good way to spend my last night alive, right?<eos> Albert.<eos> What?<eos> Do you trust me?<eos> Yeah, I do.
Now I spend every fucking minute praying to be somebody else. Somebody I'm not!<eos> Anybody-<eos> Just put the gun down, Ed.<eos> She doesn't love you anymore.<eos> You don't, do you?
What you wanted.<eos> Now I spend every fucking minute trying to be something else, something I'm not.<eos> Just put the gun down, Ed.<eos> She doesn't love you anymore.<eos> You don't, do you?
God.<eos> That sounded bad.<eos> I just don't get why everyone takes everything so personally.<eos> I know. It's like that time that guy I dated thought we wrote a song about how he sounded like a bike pump in bed.<eos> We did.
I don't know why guys are grossed out by it, though.<eos> - It's just blood.<eos> - I don't know. My boobs feel so huge, though.<eos> Do they look bigger to you?<eos> Yeah, they do.
- No.<eos> - We had troubles.<eos> No, I understand.<eos> I don't think you do.<eos> No, I do. I do.
I can't do this.<eos> This fucking sucks.<eos> Why?<eos> I thought you liked it.<eos> No, I do.
Really? I'm assuming you have a little more time, you interrupting bastard.<eos> Interrupt me in the middle of my eulogy. You're supposed to be dead.<eos> But when the scientists from the future... come to my house with robot eyes... and they tell me to try them on...<eos> I'm gonna tell those scientists to piss off, because... because Gus, I don't even want to see a world without you.<eos> I don't.
And that's your answer, "Omnis cellula e cellula."<eos> "Life comes from life."<eos> I'm really not in the mood.<eos> You don't want an explanation?<eos> No, I don't.
You know it's better.<eos> Fuck ratings.<eos> I don't care about ratings.<eos> Well, that's easy to say...<eos> I don't.
You think...<eos> Everyone can tell? No!<eos> No, you're doing great.<eos> But I totally get what you're going through.<eos> You do?
Is that what just happened? - Mm-mm.<eos> - Then where's my fucking money?<eos> I just seen you with that faggot.<eos> So I know you got some. No, I don't.<eos> I don't.
Perhaps I can.<eos> - I'm coming.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> I don't want that.<eos> Nonsense, of course he does.
Well, let's not get carried away.<eos> You.<eos> Is there a problem, Captain?<eos> She doesn't have your page.<eos> Flint does.
Wherever he picked them up,<eos> I mean, I won't lie. However we left it, he had some moves.<eos> He knew a few Cis from his narco days.<eos> They knew these parts, put us in touch with some names, people to talk to.<eos> How we doing, boys? Hey.
Which indicates you think I'm too thick to realize that y'all are trying to jam somebody up.<eos> You're on to something new.<eos> So Cohle didn't want to give it to the task force.<eos> Did you?<eos> No, I did not.
Translation?<eos> "Bring the box."<eos> "Bring the box"?<eos> Where did you learn mandarin?<eos> I didn't.
F and G's beach."<eos> Oh, God. I carved that.<eos> Well, I helped.<eos> Actually I didn't do all that much, I was only small.<eos> - Frazer did most of it.
Yet, I mean, you and Sophie stayed in contact for months, and never questioned her age.<eos> You kept on asking about young models for an exhibition you were doing on the loss of innocence.<eos> Sure.<eos> Well, I put it to you that you're lying to us, and that you DID believe that she was 13.<eos> No, I didn't.
Especially when it's genuinely dangerous.<eos> Just for God's sake, don't do it for me, or for Tony or anyone here.<eos> We understand. We know what happened and frankly, we're pretty amazed you're even here.<eos> So if you want to do it for you then do it.<eos> If you don't, don't.
Maybe he'll give something up.<eos> How are we going to buy some time?<eos> The case against him has fallen down.<eos> The minute Nelson finds out...<eos> What if he doesn't?
You're hungry?<eos> Yes, I'd like the soup.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I want to call the kids but there's no signal.<eos> I already did.
Get out, get out.<eos> You're not supposed to see me tonight.<eos> Come on, I mean, that is a dumb tradition. You don't believe it.<eos> No, no, I don't believe it.<eos> Oh, shit, you do.
You're not supposed to see me tonight.<eos> Come on, I mean, that is a dumb tradition. You don't believe it.<eos> No, no, I don't believe it.<eos> Oh, shit, you do.<eos> Okay, I kind of do.
We need to try more new things, like weekends away in places like this.<eos> - You think so? - Mmm-hmm.<eos> It makes me excited about us again.<eos> Do you feel it?<eos> - I do.
Talking exists, doesn't it?<eos> Come on, Hidayet.<eos> How many times did we talk?<eos> How many times did I tell you?<eos> I did, didn't I?
But I couldn't take the easy way out like you.<eos> What easy way out?<eos> Maybe you should think about it.<eos> You went a bit too fast.<eos> I didn't.
- Who's judging? I was saying... - That's no good.<eos> I maybe didn't express myself right.<eos> I meant something else.<eos> - Levent, you said it wrong.<eos> - I didn't.
You know what you've done...<eos> Over the years, little by little and by parts?<eos> You managed to make me hate myself today.<eos> You see that?<eos> You did.
Good.<eos> Now, just give me my money so I can get out of here.<eos> Hey.<eos> What you say your name was?<eos> I didn't.
♪ this must be how it feels to fly ♪<eos> ♪ I'm on Cloud 9 ♪ I'm on Cloud 9<eos> ♪ this must be how it feels to fly ♪<eos> ♪ I'm on Cloud 9 tell me this gets easier.<eos> It does.
I never ask anything of you.<eos> This I must insist on.<eos> Tell me you understand.<eos> I understand.<eos> - How we doing?
Your previous commander, Sholto.<eos> Previous commander?<eos> I meant ex.<eos> "Previous" suggests that I currently have a commander.<eos> Which you don't.
So, clearly he believes<eos> I'm a Dr.ug addict and no serious threat.<eos> And of course, because he's in town tonight, the letters will be in his safe in his London office while he's out to dinner with the Marketing Group of GB from seven till ten.<eos> How do you know his schedule?<eos> Because I do.
I've not been murdered YET.<eos> Balance of probability, little brother.<eos> If the bullet had passed through you, what would you have heard?<eos> The mirror shattering.<eos> You didn't. Therefore...?
Do you have sweeteners?<eos> In the drawer.<eos> Which?<eos> The one with the hoover bags.<eos> Sorry, I still don't...
Do you need a place to plug in your vibrator?<eos> How dare you?<eos> Turn that music off, Mary.<eos> You seriously like this?<eos> You seriously don't?
No, I didn't. I absolutely did not.<eos> How did you expect I'd react, Maeve?<eos> You just told me you had a fantasy that doesn't involve me!<eos> No, what?<eos> Yes, it does!
No!<eos> Oh, no, no, no, darling, that's not what I meant.<eos> Oh, my God, you are so fucking beautiful.<eos> No, I want to be raped by you.<eos> No, you don't.
We beat it.<eos> No, it's bullshit.<eos> Dr Barnes said she hasn't seen you in weeks.<eos> I never said I went to Dr Barnes.<eos> Yes, you did.
Hey, Debs.<eos> I'm pregnant.<eos> What?<eos> I thought you just said you're pregnant.<eos> I did.
Sure, he even declared it.<eos> But he bought an Opel Rekord.<eos> They paid well in Vietnam, I bet he didn't declare all of it.<eos> It doesn't prove anything.<eos> Sure they did, but not that well.
Nothing.<eos> I'm a Polish army officer.<eos> MPs should be with you, and the patrol commander should be the rank of major or higher.<eos> Do you have your ID?<eos> Yes, I do...
These episodes illustrate the universality of the conquest ethic and the uniqueness of the American response to it.<eos> Slavery existed all over the world.<eos> The Egyptians had slaves.<eos> The Chinese had slaves.<eos> The Africans did.
- Of course.<eos> What's that?<eos> It's a cassette.<eos> - They don't exist anymore.<eos> - Yes, they do here.
Okay.<eos> DAVE:<eos> And what are we gonna name you, huh?<eos> You need a name?<eos> Yes, you do.
- Sarah, what happened to you?<eos> - Don't, don't touch me. - Sarah...<eos> - Don't touch me.<eos> - Sarah.<eos> - Don't.
The waves that turn everyone into a psycho killer.<eos> But what he probably didn't tell anyone... is it can also super heat their soft tissue at his command.<eos> Valentine selected his chosen few to get the countdown warning... but he had to be sure they didn't blab to the wrong people beforehand.<eos> How does this help us right now?<eos> It doesn't.
Right but the pseudo, I mean, you do have it...<eos> Oh, I've got it, partner... but here's the thing... if I tell you where it is now what's to stop you... just putting a bullet in me?<eos> Well, I can think of a long list of things, Russell... but number one would have to be the fact that... I don't even have a fucking gun.<eos> He doesn't have a gun.<eos> Well, you do now.
Oh, I've got it, partner... but here's the thing... if I tell you where it is now what's to stop you... just putting a bullet in me?<eos> Well, I can think of a long list of things, Russell... but number one would have to be the fact that...

Skyler... uh...<eos> I think I've been hallucinating.<eos> Or maybe I am now.<eos> But just tell me what you remember...<eos> The same thing you do.
- It seems so unfair.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> You ever go to her house?<eos> Me?<eos> I did, yeah.
Like a forest creature in a cartoon.<eos> Father Doug! He's over here!<eos> He's over here! (WHIMPERING)<eos> Doug!<eos> Nigga, please, don't. MEGAN:
Holy cow, that was close.<eos> You did it!<eos> You killed Herzog?<eos> I can't believe that that actually worked,<eos> Of course it did.
- I'm not going back to limbo.<eos> - No, you're not.<eos> You said we're linked, I'll take you with me, I'll leave you there.<eos> - You don't know what I can do.<eos> - Oh no, I do.
I'm bleeding to death, you fucking idiot.<eos> Shut the fuck up, Liam!<eos> You might as well kill me right now 'cause I'm not giving you any of my fucking money.<eos> Do you still love him?<eos> You do.
And I need your help translating the Aramaic.<eos> Wait a minute.<eos> Did you go to Iran?<eos> It doesn't matter who went there, George.<eos> You did, didn't you?
It's weird, right?<eos> I know, but it's kinda good-weird.<eos> I like it.<eos> Well, he must have seen a lot of stuff.<eos> He did.
No. I don't have a TV, but that sounds cool.<eos> Do you have a cellphone?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Does it have GPS?<eos> Yes, it does.
You don't have to be afraid of me.<eos> I wouldn't dream of embarrassing you to make you look bad in front of your daughter.<eos> Listen, Elliott.<eos> I wanted to be here last night.<eos> I did.
He's changed.<eos> And he just wants to be with his baby.<eos> He doesn't want to be with his daughter, Rowena.<eos> That's the problem.<eos> You do, he doesn't.
You can't just ask me out for a private chat.<eos> What do you think that's telling her?<eos> You don't want me there?<eos> She doesn't want you in there.<eos> Of course she doesn't.
Just don't leave it to the last second.<eos> David responds to negotiating time.<eos> Who wants a negotiation?<eos> He will.<eos> I don't.
- Yeah.<eos> ___<eos> Here is fine.<eos> - You live up there?<eos> - I did.
-Welcome.<eos> -Thank you.<eos> -How do you know Curtis?<eos> -Um...<eos> I don't.
I was worried you might remember me.<eos> Of course I remember you.<eos> And I spotted you way back.<eos> I spotted you at Aldgate East.<eos> -You did not.
If you see him, tell him she's 90 right away.<eos> Good point.<eos> Do you have a... a card?<eos> Oh, yes, yes. Of course.<eos> Of course, I do.
You spend your life waiting for your parents to come back and make it all right. But they don't come back.<eos> It's not all right.<eos> You have to somehow move past them.<eos> You have to somehow convince yourself that you don't need those people.<eos> Because you don't.
Are you gonna arrest me or what?<eos> No, I'm not gonna arrest you.<eos> Then stop following me.<eos> Why did you say that you didn't recognize Ellie Ford?<eos> - Because I didn't.
Well, after tonight, I was gonna take you to go find her... but you did the hard part for me.<eos> Oh, you should've seen her face...<eos> - ...right when she died. - Oh, my God!<eos> Daniel, I didn't bring her to you!<eos> Yes, you did.
Right, yeah.<eos> Um, I think this went quite well.<eos> Sorry about that.<eos> You don't happen to have a mint, do you?<eos> I did...
You sound like my father.<eos> I think that was an insult.<eos> You see, my father believed that the law spoke for all men, even a black janitor.<eos> You just have to have faith in the system.<eos> And he did.
I'm older than you were when you got married.<eos> And what about you?<eos> What do you think about me marrying Alex?<eos> I don't have an opinion.<eos> Of course you do.
I'm your kid.<eos> You're always telling me what a big baby I am.<eos> Well, you are.<eos> You really like it, don't you?<eos> I do.
He's the only prisoner.<eos> Leave him to us.<eos> I'm sorry for you, René But it wasn't him.<eos> - You don't care!<eos> - I do.
No way.<eos> Take the blame.<eos> You're the one who dropped us in this shit.<eos> No way! What, you think you can get away with it?<eos> Yeah, I do. Yeah.
God damn it!<eos> What the fuck is this?<eos> Please tell me you have a map in your bag.<eos> - I never needed a map.<eos> - Oh, we do now.
(Laughing) Okay, yeah.<eos> But you have to understand.<eos> I didn't have all the love and support that Ben has.<eos> I didn't have an incredible, selfless mother who would do anything for me.<eos> Well, who does really?
Um, so I uh...<eos> I don't know how to say this, really. Um...<eos> Say what?<eos> You know that I care about you a lot, right?<eos> Yeah, of course I do.
Close Radley?<eos> Once and for all.<eos> Did you hear that?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I did.
You're gonna be transferred. There's nothing I can do about it.<eos> You're still the chief of police.<eos> You've never left me out there, not for one day.<eos> You know you have to do this.<eos> No, I don't.
Wherever she goes, shadow her.<eos> Hey.<eos> I know I shouldn't, but I feel kind of bad for Dr. Roman.<eos> Don't feel bad for her.<eos> But I do.
She's completely age-appropriate.<eos> Why' you jealous?<eos> Fuckin' -A, I'm jealous.<eos> You see that body?<eos> No, of course you did.
You have something to say to him, right?<eos> This is very important...<eos> Jonas wants to get the code.<eos> - Sorry.<eos> - He does not.
He got used to it.<eos> Do you think he did it?<eos> No.<eos> Oh, he hated the little twat, sure.<eos> But who didn't?
And for you.<eos> I almost forgot.<eos> I have one more gift.<eos> I don't need a squire.<eos> Of course you do.
I know how hard it is, Sam, believe me.<eos> When you told me about Bran going beyond the Wall, all I could think about was getting my strength back so I could go and find him.<eos> I wish I could have convinced him to come back with me.<eos> I tried.<eos> Really, I did.
- Ripping!<eos> Whoa, whoa, whoa! Drip, what the heck is the matter with you?<eos> You nearly took off the guy's canopy!<eos> But Blackout said it was okay to go, dude.<eos> - I did?
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Drip, what the heck is the matter with you?<eos> You nearly took off the guy's canopy!<eos> But Blackout said it was okay to go, dude.<eos> - I did?<eos> - He did?
If I had tits like that, it would not have taken me till I was 18 to get some dick.<eos> Shelby, did you bring my black shoes?<eos> I don't have them.<eos> Yes, you do.<eos> No, I don't.
Lucas Goodwin.<eos> From the Herald.<eos> He must have been working with Zoe.<eos> How much does he know?<eos> No more than she did.
Killing redskins more your line?<eos> You know nothing about it.<eos> Whole Indian nations pacified into nonexistence, what don't I know?<eos> How do you know I was in the Indian wars?<eos> I didn't.
But I don't think she'll stay there.<eos> They never stay, do they?<eos> Where do they go?<eos> You know.<eos> Do I?
They never stay, do they?<eos> Where do they go?<eos> You know.<eos> Do I?<eos> Of course you do.
Harmless, of course.<eos> Something any girl would do.<eos> I told myself it was no more than mischief.<eos> But I knew it was more.<eos> Of course I did.
From the seance?<eos> It's actually Evelyn Paul, from Brighton.<eos> - Preferable.<eos> - Yes. But the clients do so enjoy the legerdemain.<eos> Who doesn't?
Who dressed me?<eos> Sembene and myself.<eos> Did you make the tea then?<eos> What?<eos> No. Sembene did.
Am I missing anything?<eos> Lord, are we ever getting out of this house?<eos> Do you know why I must go to Africa?<eos> I don't care.<eos> Yes, you do.
Drink it all up.<eos> That's a good boy.<eos> Bad apples, Morse.<eos> Every barrel's got 'em.<eos> The same 'bad apples' that did for George Aldridge.
You know your mum wasn't attacked until everyone had gone home.<eos> So...why Donnie?<eos> I mean, why would he do a thing like that?<eos> They didn't want me there.<eos> Who didn't?
He said that?<eos> He wasn't trying to hide it.<eos> He said he saw her at 5am.<eos> He doesn't sleep so well this time of year.<eos> Who does?
You wouldn't be too bad if you made a bit of an effort, but...<eos> Really?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Quite the little lady.<eos> If you did something thing with your hair.
What is it?<eos> What's wrong?<eos> Sally didn't turn up at school.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> Of course she did.
- It's an acting appointment. - Mm.<eos> - You didn't answer my question.<eos> - An audition.<eos> Rath said that there was a small part that I might be good for.<eos> Oh, Rath did, did he?
Why didn't you say something sooner?<eos> 'Cause you're pretty cute when you're angry.<eos> All right. Okay, then.<eos> Hey, you like barbecue?<eos> Who doesn't?
Really, hmm.<eos> Olivia Thompson said they let you go.<eos> No, I moved on.<eos> Did you ever get a call back for that Budweiser commercial?<eos> Sure didn't.
Well then. That's fine.<eos> She's a whore.<eos> - She would want me.<eos> - For 50 Euro.<eos> She does it for 25 euros.
Oh, do you know? That's really quite fortuitous.<eos> It's been a week since Ian started penicillin.<eos> But his phlegm's so thick he can't seem to cough it up.<eos> He needs to be in hospital.<eos> They both do.
035...<eos> Put a three.<eos> It doesn't work.<eos> It'll cost a fortune!<eos> - lt does work.
We're a mess.<eos> I tried to scratch your eyes out.<eos> -She send you?<eos> -No.<eos> Nobody did.
-Well... that's the most sensible thing she's ever said.<eos> Go on, eat your food, mother.<eos> Yes?<eos> -Did my... mother send a letter today?<eos> -Why yes, yes she did.
- He's with his mother, OK?<eos> - You're responsible for that boy.<eos> You don't understand, Viv.<eos> That place changes you, OK?<eos> It does.
-lt doesn't qualify anybody. -No.<eos> So what if she has a foundation or something like that and fights forthe preservation of the Amazon Forest?<eos> Men don't like perfect women like that.<eos> -l agree.<eos> -They really don't .
-Let's change the subject. -Right.<eos> But that taught me a lesson:<eos> life is the greatest miracle! Whatever way it presents itself.<eos> You know, Dona Sonia, I like that.<eos> -You do?
Eli Stein, The Sword Of Israel, your father.<eos> That's quite an inheritance.<eos> Well, I hope you'll recognise that it's precisely because of what we've chosen to do with it that I'm here today.<eos> Do you have close protection, Lady Stein?<eos> Yes, I do.
He's so full of shit.<eos> I didn't think you'd ever have to know.<eos> Well, just don't say you didn't have a choice.<eos> I didn't, Nessa.<eos> You did.
- Bye-bye!<eos> - Bye, Denise.<eos> Bye.<eos> Did young miss pass her driving test?<eos> Yes, she did.
It'll be a PR disaster.<eos> Peeping Tom Vodka.<eos> I am gonna have to go and talk to Nate and see if he has any additional footage that he hasn't shown us.<eos> I told you we make a great team.<eos> We did.
Please don't touch me.<eos> Oh, no.<eos> Oh, no.<eos> Oh, no.<eos> Please don't.
Oh, no.<eos> Please don't.<eos> Please, please don't kill me.<eos> Please, please, please.<eos> Please, please don't.
Please don't.<eos> Please, please don't kill me.<eos> Please, please, please.<eos> Please, please don't.<eos> Please don't.
Whoa,whoa,whoa. We'vealready gota dealin place.<eos> Judith: Well, that was with my son.<eos> Every day your cocaine pipeline isshutdown, It costs you millions.<eos> Let'snotquibble overcrumbs.<eos> How you doing?
Whoa, whoa, whoa. We've already got a deal in place.<eos> Judith: Well, that was with my son.<eos> Every day your cocaine pipeline is shut down, it costs you millions.<eos> Let's not quibble over crumbs.<eos> How you doing?
You wanna explain this to us before we call the police?<eos> - I'd love to hear this one.<eos> - I don't remember this at all.<eos> You don't remember this happening a few hours ago?<eos> No, I do not.
What?<eos> It's nothing, my lady.<eos> You wouldn't be screwing your face up like that if it was nothing.<eos> Don't want to offend, my lady.<eos> Truly, I don't.
And that's what you decided...<eos> to leave it in there inside of me like s-some sort of...<eos> ticking time bomb, Frank?<eos> I didn't decide.<eos> Your husband did.
Then you've washed up on the right island.<eos> Oy!<eos> I've never heard such talk, not from a lady.<eos> You disapprove?<eos> I most heartily do not.
However, in this case, the observation wants for accuracy, since apparently I'm in a position to do you a great deal of good.<eos> Indeed, but not for long.<eos> My lady Selima believes it would be quicker to torture from you what we need.<eos> So I understand.<eos> I, myself, do not.
Yeah, dogs eat in the kitchen.<eos> Y-You know, you're eating mostly horse hooves and tallow, right?<eos> You cool with that?<eos> Oh, and the ones that fall on the floor, you just eat those up, too, huh?<eos> Oh, yeah, yeah, you do.
There's no time like the present, Krull.<eos> - What are you doing?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> - Really needed a "me" day.<eos> - You did, did you?
- I know.<eos> - Wasn't a social hour.<eos> - Listen, listen.<eos> What if I told you I know how we can get out from under our current financial crisis?<eos> I do too.
Hanna: Just call me later, okay?<eos> Okay.<eos> Dad.<eos> How did you know I'd be here?<eos> I didn't.
She's upset.<eos> She loves him.<eos> Well, she said she didn't.<eos> And you believe that?<eos> He did.
That's nonsense.<eos> We should go there.<eos> It could have answers for what's happening.<eos> The dome doesn't have answers.<eos> Yes, it does, Dad.
What?<eos> I gave away my get out of town free card to someone who needed it more than I did.<eos> Ali, who needs more help than you do right now?<eos> It doesn't matter.<eos> It does to us.
You acted like you were better than some first-time author nobody had ever heard of, even though you were probably still in college.<eos> I wrote my number in it, twice.<eos> I really honestly don't remember meeting you.<eos> Sorry, but I remember you now.<eos> Oh, of course you do.
It's lonely and sad and the faculty have turned on me.<eos> The last few weeks have been so hard for you. Whose cat is this?<eos> It's my cat.<eos> - We don't have a cat.<eos> - Apparently I do.
We began by hating one another. I think we're coming back down the other side now.<eos> That's a very potent image. You should write it down and use it.<eos> I came up with it on the silent, excruciating drive over here.<eos> - I'm glad you approve.<eos> - Oh, I do, indeed.
You?<eos> Keep it down, Garza.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Remember when you were in the rebellion and you convinced your commander to run a flanking move and everybody was captured except you?<eos> Do you?
Any plans? We thought we might travel somewhere ethical, an Aboriginal... cave.<eos> That's a shame.<eos> I'm going to Splash Planet.<eos> It looks brilliant.<eos> It does, doesn't it?
What are you doing in here?<eos> What do you want from me?<eos> Just some answers.<eos> Why did it take you so long to change your mind about wanting her?<eos> I didn't.
It's to help her poop.<eos> She's backed up.<eos> Why didn't you tell me?<eos> - You don't wanna hear about my bathroom.<eos> - Of course I do.
And when you do tell me, you just watch my face.<eos> Patrick... ..I'm not sure I'll be telling you anything.<eos> Nothing feels as it should.<eos> My cycle - or the lack of it - suggests I might be expecting.<eos> But nothing else does.
You built a 10,000-year-old weapon powered by that stone, and you just sent Neil out to go turn it on?<eos> No, what you should be asking is how did they access the materials?<eos> How did they even know the power of that stone?<eos> How did they know that it had to be built in a lead deposit?<eos> - How did Th...
Okay?<eos> You owe it to yourself for always taking the easy way out.<eos> I am taking the easy way out because I chose a career... that you and her just don't approve of?<eos> I like my job!<eos> I do.
Mr Grove?<eos> I presume you know.<eos> Unless I pull myself together I'm out on my ear.<eos> The chief doesn't want that.<eos> None of us do.
Why did you come back from America at all?<eos> You should either stay out there or be here and try to make it up with him.<eos> Gordon, it's very complicated.<eos> Do you still love him?<eos> Yes, I do.
So you could try and change my mind?<eos> You're my brother.<eos> And this is my country!<eos> Everybody has a choice, George.<eos> Yes, they do.
They left and went to Berlin.<eos> I followed them.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> Why couldn't you accept them being together?<eos> I did, finally, but...
So there's your story, Mr Edwards.<eos> I thought you might be interested.<eos> Yes, I would be willing to meet you.<eos> Well, why don't you come to the house?<eos> Don't you?
Lady Diana Manners.<eos> Tittle tattle.<eos> My readers want real news.<eos> We can't run it till he's had right of reply and I don't know where he is.<eos> I do.
First I'd... get the jar and put it up to my nose... ..and breathe in.<eos> Do you remember how we used to make jam and chutney with mother? Our life of crime, Mr Selfridge.<eos> Robbing orchards. Ah.<eos> I hope you didn't get caught.<eos> Like I did.
Right now, I would.<eos> I haven't seen Braxton since his dog lunged at Elena.<eos> Word is, he was coming up here to have it out with you.<eos> His dog's still missing. His dog never showed up.<eos> Neither did he.
I know somebody put you up to it.<eos> Somebody's paying you.<eos> Nah.<eos> No way.<eos> You do your taxes?
Who says I'm gonna kill her? You do.<eos> Time and time again.<eos> Hm.<eos> You're right.<eos> I do, don't I?
Look. The thing is, I'm not a very good teammate, Ross.<eos> I get ahead of myself.<eos> And the more you do to try to help me, the more nervous I get about messing it up. - I don't care.<eos> You can mess up all you want.<eos> - Yeah, you do.
Just say 6:00 to 10:00 and maybe a prayer that you catch the monster who did this.<eos> Two dead kids stuffed into suitcases.<eos> Sound bad enough to justify some overtime?<eos> And... and how do you intend for us to break this news to the mother?<eos> I don't.
Honey, you want me to call the Captain for you?<eos> - I have no problem doing that.<eos> - No!<eos> - Okay.<eos> - Hey, how you doing, sweet thing?

Might want to back up.<eos> I know standard procedure's to confiscate his armor, But skull may have it booby-trapped.<eos> (growls) I'll get it off him.<eos> (growls) Didn't I just say not to do that?<eos> I did, right?
In a sense, yes.<eos> There's no escaping it.<eos> It is an unfortunate situation.<eos> Our agreement with France has all the obligations of a formal alliance.<eos> -No, it doesn't!
We're all tired, Spencer.<eos> Figure it out, so we can get on with our lives.<eos> No matter who gets hurt.<eos> You're all the time talking about wanting the answer.<eos> Maybe you do, maybe you don't.
And she says Frederik was furious about the museum.<eos> - There was a hell of a lot of trouble.<eos> - I was at the funeral too.<eos> You can't get a better family than John and Lise.<eos> They did everything for you.
- What if he doesn't have a single krone?<eos> Emil has used other people's money his entire life.<eos> Let him fend for himself.<eos> - He needs the money.<eos> - He always does. Signe!
- Long time no see.<eos> I'm not sure it's a good idea, turning up out of the blue like this.<eos> Alice said the door was always open.<eos> - I'm pretty sure she never said that.<eos> - She did.
They just really liked your music and didn't know how to express it.<eos> - You like movies? - I do.<eos> - You do?<eos> - You like... you like Robert DeNiro?<eos> - I do.
Is it?<eos> Alejandro can treat me like the help.<eos> I don't care.<eos> But you... I thought I mattered to you.<eos> Of course you do.
Nicely done.<eos> If it wasn't for your speech, the integration program and your father's work would've gone down the drain.<eos> You wouldn't have given up on integration, though. No.<eos> But I'm only interested in programs that work.<eos> Thanks to you, this one still does.
When's your birthday?<eos> February 23rd.<eos> Ha! February has no 23rd.<eos> You... (grunts) (grunting)<eos> Yes, it does.
- I love Mindy Kaling.<eos> She's terrific.<eos> - Right, but she holds back.<eos> She'll go there, but she doesn't go all the way there, you know what I mean?<eos> I definitely do. She just never...
He wakes up early to get papers and muffins.<eos> He watches foreign films with me and does all the voices.<eos> He explains the universe so that black holes sound cool, not scary.<eos> - You don't want to see me. - No, she does.<eos> She really, really does.
Exactly.<eos> I don't get it.<eos> You didn't even care about the play.<eos> Well, but here's the thing.<eos> I did. I always did.
I don't get it.<eos> You didn't even care about the play.<eos> Well, but here's the thing.<eos> I did. I always did.<eos> I do.
She has 30 days to change her mind, right?<eos> She still has two days left.<eos> Well, it's not just about the date.<eos> Does she have a job, a place to live, money in the bank to support the child?<eos> And what if she did?
No!<eos> Because, down here, we get to do what we please. Right?<eos> Take him.<eos> Take him down!<eos> - Sarge, I don't... - No!
I'm sorry, it's just, uh... My son, he's quite picky and he needs the meal number to be a prime number and there to be a prime number of prawn balls. And, um, if he had nine balls it wouldn't be a prime number and number 48 isn't...<eos> Isn't a prime...<eos> Is it?<eos> Is it? I don't know.<eos> Yes, I do.
Almost everyone on the camp speaks English.<eos> It is expected of us.<eos> You speak it very well.<eos> Thank you.<eos> So do you.
Shouldn't you be upstairs?<eos> I should have lent you the money.<eos> It doesn't matter.<eos> Probably wouldn't have had enough for a TV anyway.<eos> Uh, yeah, I do.
I should have lent you the money.<eos> It doesn't matter.<eos> Probably wouldn't have had enough for a TV anyway.<eos> Uh, yeah, I do.<eos> Well, I did.
Okay, so, they both had marks, just like the hot trainer at Rollz.<eos> But she was skinny... and alive.<eos> And just recently lost a ton of weight.<eos> When I asked her about the mark, she... she clammed up, got all embarrassed.<eos> So, I did some checking.
Look, amigo...<eos> I know this is all looks nuts, but I found it.<eos> Love and a family?<eos> Who cares where that comes from?<eos> I do.
I had to make myself ready to die fo them?<eos> I know. I know.<eos> No, you don't. You don't know.<eos> That's the problem, you don't know.<eos> None of you do.
She and Jasper had a thing going on the side.<eos> Selling.<eos> Yeah, I heard about that.<eos> All right, I know Jasper.<eos> Everyone does.
She was... She was on edge.<eos> Nervous.<eos> I'd say very nervous.<eos> Did she give any reason why she wasn't in contact with her own team?<eos> No, she didn't.
Same story as the ambush - stolen vehicle, cloned plates.<eos> He's the go-between - you get him, you get the killers, you get the police officer they're working with.<eos> You never saw a face in the hospital?<eos> No.<eos> Only Georgia did.
Well, I...<eos> It must've been pretty obvious something was going on.<eos> You didn't ask where this cash was coming from?<eos> No.<eos> Why not? I just didn't.
Will you tell her about me anyway?<eos> That's what I thought.<eos> It's not that simple.<eos> She has a father.<eos> Damn right she does!
It's a gift.<eos> You better take that with you, too.<eos> Take it where, Kerwin?<eos> Take it where?<eos> They finally did it.
This thing with paying CJ and not telling you... It was wrong on every level and I can--<eos> Totally, I admit it now.<eos> Can you please come out here and talk to me?<eos> You don't want to hear what I've got to say.<eos> No, I do.
Uh, Cardiff finds out, then both of us would be on the street.<eos> Apple, IBM, they have the market sewn up.<eos> Plus, you got Commodore, Tandy, Texas Instruments.<eos> I'm sorry, but you missed it.<eos> We all did.
Answer honestly.<eos> This is for legal record.<eos> False answers put you at risk of perjury, you understand?<eos> I'm sorry, you have to answer "yes" or "I do."<eos> Oh, yes, I do.
No proof.<eos> And I will not be leaving this desk until you do.<eos> We've got all day, so chop—chop.<eos> - Nobody said anything about hiding who we are.<eos> - Yes, they did. You.
Where the bloody hell did you get that?<eos> - I don't know why you're so het up.<eos> They're going in the morning.<eos> Well, this strike matters to you two, does it?<eos> Of course it does.
"Considering"?<eos> Sometimes people can surprise you, that's all I'm saying.<eos> I never had a problem with it, Sian.<eos> Well, I'm glad to hear it, because this is Joe and he's gonna be sleeping in our house.<eos> How do?
I don't know how it got so fucked up.<eos> You have to fucking believe me, man, you have to believe me.<eos> - Fuck you.<eos> - I didn't have a fucking choice, man.<eos> - I didn't.
Could be fun.<eos> At least something different.<eos> Come on, you want to show these two lovely ladies a good time, don't you?<eos> But then, I thought you said we couldn't go there.<eos> I did.
We just got married.<eos> It doesn't change who you are.<eos> You love what you do.<eos> You don't want me to be here?<eos> Of course I do.
Are you?<eos> No. But I'm clocking two of your pavement artists right now.<eos> You've had me in a floating box since I left Angel's Bluff.<eos> Weatherly didn't know.<eos> The president still doesn't.
I love the idea that betting relaxes you.<eos> It did until you showed up.<eos> Look, I've been thinking about you a lot.<eos> I was hoping to find you. I don't know where you live.<eos> Very few people do.
Why? No.<eos> - I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.<eos> I didn't mean to scare you.<eos> I...<eos> I didn't.
That's not a motto.<eos> But it does need to be said.<eos> Let's talk about your appearance.<eos> Now, we've got a weight issue In this general area here.<eos> We do.
Um, I guess, I just needed to ask you again...<eos> Why I stayed away?<eos> And I know that I might not have the right...<eos> No, that's not true.<eos> Of course, you do.
You know, I was gonna leave that cell on my 18th birthday, get sick and die in my own piss and vomit.<eos> Look at me!<eos> I don't have any memories of touching my dad's hand, or what my mom smells like.<eos> You told me that a relationship between a vampire and his maker was special.<eos> - Yes, I did!
And that's the reason that I came back.<eos> There has to be more than just blood between us!<eos> You wanna know why I went after Josh?<eos> Yes.<eos> I do.
Let's go.<eos> Andrew...<eos> Is Emily OK?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I really don't.
No, you can fix this!<eos> This is your chance!<eos> You can change things!<eos> - You really think that?<eos> - Yes! I really do.
Fifth grade, you get every dirty detail.<eos> Do you know how embarrassed I was To get a call at my arraignment For my behavior during the pub crawl<eos> My son placed on his art teacher? I didn't mean to make her pregnant.<eos> I just hate art so much.<eos> Oh, everyone does, son.
Do either of you actually know what Thinman is?<eos> No.<eos> We just play Supernaturalists on TV.<eos> We have no idea what we're doing.<eos> Of course we do.
Why don't we just leave that here?<eos> We talked about this, and we decided that --<eos> No.<eos> In all fairness, we didn't decide.<eos> You did.
Like yours?<eos> Do we have the same now?<eos> Thank you.<eos> - Do you like them?<eos> - Of course I do.
Mom's not in there, nothing's in there,<eos> Mom's gone.<eos> Do you believe in God?<eos> The God who sees all, knows all.<eos> I do.
Wondering why do I remember?<eos> I do not have a car.<eos> He made me an errand to me.<eos> Barry? , Got me what I asked for?<eos> Yes, yes, I did.
BOY (crying): Mommy... I want Mommy.<eos> (boat motor chugging)<eos> You'll see your mother again.<eos> I really believe that.<eos> After today, I do, too.
Okay?<eos> I...<eos> I didn't know that.<eos> Did you know that Agent Bellamy has gone over my head and gotten a federal court order to open the tomb?<eos> I did.
I'm sorry I troubled you, Maggie.<eos> Uncle Henry.<eos> Mr. Langston.<eos> I hope it was worth it.<eos> So do I.
The school is in the saloon?<eos> It's the only place big enough to hold our children, Miss Thatcher.<eos> We had requested a mature, experienced teacher, someone who would not shrink from the challenges that Coal Valley presents.<eos> I realize I'm perhaps not what you expected, but I assure you I am acquainted with the most modern teaching theories, the superintendent of schools did tell you what happened here?<eos> No, he didn't.
Someone else.<eos> You know, when your father and I first announced our wedding, Brandon, I was so nervous.<eos> A free spirit like me, marrying a policeman?<eos> How was that ever gonna work?<eos> But it did.
I know Lieutenant Dunn is in charge here...<eos> The bodies were discovered over here, sir.<eos> Did you discover the bodies, Lieutenant Dunn?<eos> No, Commander.<eos> Detective Jensen did.
Wait.<eos> Did Kapp Security work the steel mill demolition site?<eos> Frank, if they worked security at the steel mill demolition site, then it is definitely him.<eos> That's how he found where to hide the bodies.<eos> Did Krogh?
So, what did he do?<eos> Your "perfect child" must have done something wrong.<eos> - What was it?<eos> - What does it matter?<eos> Miss Lucinda did violence on him.
That smells good.<eos> If you invite him to eat with us, I'll kill you.<eos> - We have to talk.<eos> - No, we don't.<eos> We really, really do.
Did she have something on him?<eos> I'm not sure what it was, but yeah.<eos> She had something.<eos> Of course, mom couldn't really tell anyone because Nick saw her push Dahlia off the bridge.<eos> We both did.
Wait...<eos> - Wait... - We just got ditched.<eos> Yeah, I think your daughter just stole him from me.<eos> - Hi.<eos> - How you doing?
Jenna, the equipment girl, may I have your ballot, please?<eos> - I get a vote?<eos> - No, you don't.<eos> You're just the team's bitch-slave.<eos> Actually, you do.
Pass me the beetroot.<eos> With Sister Julienne's permission, I'll make myself a sandwich.<eos> Of course.<eos> What I want to know is does Nurse Lee say when she's coming back?<eos> No, she doesn't.
Beg your pardon?<eos> Here are your district patients for today.<eos> I know Nurse Noakes will be relieved to have your support.<eos> Sister Julienne, you know that I came to Nonnatus House specifically to enhance my midwifery.<eos> I do.
Now he said this at a very young age before Dota ever came along.<eos> And I thought, well, you know, he's going to grow out of it.<eos> He's going to get sick and tired of sitting there in front of that computer and playing.<eos> Never did.<eos> Never did.
Look, I'm sorry I screamed at you before.<eos> It's just...<eos> I get scared. And I need to know you want me here.<eos> Oh, I...<eos> I do.
It's just...<eos> I get scared. And I need to know you want me here.<eos> Oh, I...<eos> I do.<eos> I definitely do.
How are you?<eos> These men, they said they want to kill me?<eos> They said they would burn your building down with you in it, so, yeah.<eos> You believe him?<eos> Yeah, I do.
Absolutely not.<eos> No.<eos> Janine, you have to know I didn't want this.<eos> You wanted a baby.<eos> We both did.
To see her for...?<eos> A private matter.<eos> It's perfect, then.<eos> Did Olivia happen to mention I'm storing pennies in heaven to aid my cause with Anna?<eos> No, she didn't.
They wanted to send us on a wild goose chase.<eos> Why sacrifice such hugely valuable intel to do it?<eos> Sarah: I agree.<eos> They had the resources to sabotage Lakenheath, to devastate us.<eos> No, they didn't.
It's just a car you wanted to do, isn't it?<eos> Something like that.<eos> Christ, be careful with it!<eos> Where did you say you were from?<eos> I didn't.
Excuse me.<eos> Just what the hell do you think you're doing here, Secret Service?<eos> This is where the FBI works.<eos> Agent Finley, I thought I made it clear you are not working this.<eos> Yes, Agent Dunn, you did.
We tracked it to the Pakistani Embassy.<eos> The President's son could be in that building.<eos> SWAT should be on scene.<eos> - You hear what Olsen said?<eos> - Yes, ma'am, I did.
- I like her.<eos> - I like her more than I've liked any other girl before.<eos> - Think it's love?<eos> I've only told one other girl that I loved her, and that did not end the way that I expected it to, so...<eos> - Yeah, they don't always.
I'm trying to get rid of you.<eos> We don't need to talk anymore, okay?<eos> You've made your choice.<eos> Yeah, but that doesn't negate our life together.<eos> Of course it does.
Ripping each other's clothes off.<eos> Kill me now.<eos> - Why? ! This is amazing.<eos> - I'm sorry, does it not seem like I left my jewelry at his house in a childish ploy to see him again?<eos> Yeah. No, it totally does. 100%.
No, I did not.<eos> Why not?<eos> Seriously?<eos> Harry, I got a camel... A real, live, leaf-eating, cud-chewing camel.<eos> I did lanterns instead.
Yes, and he wants to be a family again.<eos> He walked out on us.<eos> Why would you expose Esme to a man like that?<eos> - Reagan's father isn't alive anymore. - He will do her... - This is the only grandfather she has.<eos> - ...exactly what he did to us.
I'd like to propose a-a toast to the brilliant woman who I'm now going to be spending the rest of my life with.<eos> What happened between us...<eos> It was meaningless sex.<eos> Why do you want me to touch you again?<eos> - I don't.
What happened between us...<eos> It was meaningless sex.<eos> Why do you want me to touch you again?<eos> - I don't.<eos> - You do.
Uh, he's, uh, watching TV.<eos> Pops!<eos> Pops, come on, man!<eos> - You didn't tell me she's diabetic.<eos> - I did.
My... my patient was in critical condition.<eos> I'm sorry. Couldn't have taken one night off?<eos> No, I'm a doctor.<eos> Of course... you know that. I can't take a night off.<eos> My parents don't.
Come on.<eos> Come on.<eos> Move over.<eos> Come on, I don't have enough space.<eos> - Yes, you do.
- However...<eos> The political capital needed to effect a change of such sweeping...<eos> However, your informed opinion...<eos> - I don't recall precisely...<eos> - Of course you do.
- I'd like to bring my veterinary pathologist, Doreen Boyle, up to speed on this.<eos> I think she could be a big help.<eos> - Alan, this is progress.<eos> - It has to work in the rats first.<eos> - And if it does?
Did you see Doreen yesterday?<eos> Just in passing.<eos> Did she say anything?<eos> About her research? - Any breakthrough she might've had?<eos> - No, she didn't.
- You need a lawyer.<eos> I don't need Mom.<eos> Or you.<eos> Does Dad know I'm here?<eos> - Of course he does.
Besides, I've got a system.<eos> No, systems don't work. Okay?<eos> Trust me.<eos> I've seen them all.<eos> This one does. Rush?
A safe haven<eos> The path.<eos> For the moment... I'm gonna let her go with you, all right? But you're responsible for her.<eos> If anything happens to her, you answer to me, do you understand?<eos> - Yeah, I do.
Do we have the resources?<eos> I'd have to run the numbers, anticipate fluctuations,<eos> - consider different models...<eos> - Your best guess.<eos> We do. For a moderate stockpile.
He's gonna get away with it, isn't he?<eos> Yes.<eos> He is.<eos> - Take an iced tea if you have any.<eos> - We don't.
I can have a briefing ready in five minutes.<eos> Don't bother.<eos> I had Seth do it.<eos> He doesn't have security clearance.<eos> Well, he does now.
You're not coming with me.<eos> After all the nonsense this quest of yours has put me through, how could I not?<eos> I heard you.<eos> I had faith that you still thought of me.<eos> You do.
I had no idea of this, okay?<eos> You know what? I don't really care who knew what when. All right?<eos> I'm out of here.<eos> I didn't mean it to go like that.<eos> - Don't.
Yeah.<eos> I...<eos> Sure.<eos> I mean, I think so, yeah.<eos> Yeah, yeah, so do I.
You're angry.<eos> Good. You should be.<eos> You're finally realizing what I knew all along.<eos> Savi doesn't deserve you.<eos> She never did.
Paul, who is after you?<eos> You like when people need you.<eos> Dom doesn't need you. He just loves you.<eos> Savi doesn't deserve you.<eos> She never did.
Savi, Karen, April... do I tell them what I have planned?<eos> 'Cause Janet's got me freaking out, man, and I just want to make sure that, you know, Joss' key people show up.<eos> Yeah, well... I-I-I think if you really want it to be romantic, you know, um, effortless for her, do not tell them. [Chuckles]<eos> Her ladies cannot keep a secret to save their lives, but they... they will show up for her.<eos> They always do.
I never would have wrestled.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Uh, look. I know it seems like I don't care about a lot of the things you do.<eos> I know you do, dad.<eos> No, really, I don't.
My name is Bedelia Du Maurier.<eos> You're Hannibal Lecter's therapist.<eos> What's that like?<eos> I've heard so much about you, I feel I almost know you.<eos> You don't?
Thank you, Dr. Chilton.<eos> Your witness.<eos> Dr. Chilton, Will Graham spent his time catching murderers for the FBI.<eos> You don't see a contradiction between that and your description of a coldblooded killer?<eos> No, I do not.
Previously on Hannibal...<eos> Who stitched him into the mural?<eos> - You have an idea who that might be?<eos> - I do.
- Beauregard.<eos> He was pretty chatty.<eos> So you had a good day?<eos> Yeah, yeah.<eos> I did.
I hear Stallone sings in this one.<eos> Is there nothing that man cannot do? No!<eos> He's Rambo!<eos> He's Rocky!<eos> He doesn't do country music.
Drink this.<eos> Lieutenant!<eos> Lieutenant, no!<eos> She doesn't belong to you.<eos> You both do now.
- Gracias.<eos> - You're welcome.<eos> Good. So you're headed to the vault. Right.<eos> Lucille, do you have the stockings?<eos> Yes, I do.
Wait a minute, you follow my Instagram? Yes.<eos> And if I have to look at one more picture of Monty in his sunglasses, I'm going to have Eric crash the account.<eos> Check.<eos> Selfie... gone.<eos> How you doing, Ehsan?
Yes, I did.<eos> Good.<eos> There's no surveillance.<eos> We're clean.<eos> Sisters really did well for themselves.
Goodbye, Laura.<eos> I'm so glad you're eating again.<eos> Man, we keep saying how bad Tommy is at this, but maybe he's better than all of us. I know.<eos> I know.<eos> I did it all wrong.
It's all very technical.<eos> I was taught to serve tea cakes.<eos> If you needed assistance deciphering a restaurant menu, then I'd be your girl.<eos> Everett, I tried.<eos> No, no, no, yeah, you did.
That doesn't sound like teamwork, Ders.<eos> I'm taking a leadership role, okay?<eos> - You can't spell it without "Ders".<eos> - You can't spell "it" without "Ders"? I-T.<eos> I just did.
What's that?<eos> Freedom, Agent Burke.<eos> All right, stop.<eos> Look, this could be a setup. We don't know what's in there.<eos> - I do, evidence.
Someone could end up dead.<eos> The caller got her name and number secondhand.<eos> We could send someone undercover to meet him.<eos> If he knows what she looks like, he'll bolt.<eos> - But if he doesn't...
Peter, I'm in.<eos> A bad guy wants to hire a bad girl to do some really bad stuff.<eos> I'm the best person in the division to keep that from happening.<eos> - You know that.<eos> - I do.
One eggs? Two eggs?<eos> No, no.<eos> I'm... I'm not hungry.<eos> - Do you not want to be here?<eos> - No, no, of course I do.
You want me to come over?<eos> That depends.<eos> Do you like strawberries infused with cognac hand dipped in dark chocolate?<eos> Strawberries and cognac? Can I come?<eos> You already did.
I waited all day for that.<eos> What are you looking at?<eos> I rarely see you in uniform.<eos> You like a man in uniform?<eos> Who doesn't?
All this time, it was right in front of me, and I never saw it.<eos> No one saw it. Where is he?<eos> I spoke to him this morning after they found Tetazoo.<eos> Did he tell you where he was going? Yeah.<eos> He did.
Then you've washed up on the right island.<eos> Oy!<eos> I've never heard such talk, not from a lady.<eos> You disapprove?<eos> I most heartily do not.
However, in this case, the observation wants for accuracy, since apparently I'm in a position to do you a great deal of good.<eos> Indeed, but not for long.<eos> My lady Selima believes it would be quicker to torture from you what we need.<eos> So I understand.<eos> I, myself, do not.
But remind me, Ed, who was it exactly who elected you commodore, eh?<eos> If I remember rightly, it was, um... It was you, yourself.<eos> He woke up one morning, and he thought, "oh, commodore."<eos> That has a merry ring to it."<eos> And so it does.
You imagine so?<eos> Truthfully?<eos> Don't get yourself into harm's way again.<eos> What do you mean "again"?<eos> I never did it once.
Missed a spot.<eos> Ooh! Oh. I love a good fire.<eos> Oh!<eos> That's ironic, isn't it, you know, since you left me to burn alive in one?<eos> Didn't we already do this?
I'm not saying you don't deserve it.<eos> Besides, your birthday isn't until next week.<eos> That's what makes it a surprise.<eos> Yeah, I don't think Bonnie would want a big party for her birthday.<eos> Of course she does.
We need his blood for the spell.<eos> Wait a second.<eos> Tessa didn't need my blood when she linked me to Silas.<eos> Good for her.<eos> We do.
That is how much control you have over me.<eos> And I'm still here.<eos> That's how much control you have over me.<eos> This has to end.<eos> It just did.
Well, probably in your purse.<eos> No, it's not.<eos> You know how sometimes, honey, you take a couple dollars out of my purse and you forget to tell me?<eos> Maybe you took it by mistake?<eos> I did not.
- Got it.<eos> - I love your blog.<eos> Well, thank you. Thank you very much.<eos> - I didn't know you read it.<eos> - God, everybody does.
It's 8:15.<eos> I think I lost my balance.<eos> - Lulu, you need to knock.<eos> - Oh, sorry. This sheet says Dan has to be tested every two hours to make sure his head is working.<eos> It does?
I don't even know what that means.<eos> Or silence is a way to control the people who love you.<eos> And you think your wife is trying to control you?<eos> Yes.<eos> Oh, yes, I do.
- Did they have boyfriends?<eos> - No.<eos> Is it true they wanted to leave town?<eos> - Who doesn't?<eos> - I don't.
I'll call you when I hear back.<eos> You're protecting him.<eos> What?<eos> You don't know how things work around here.<eos> Yes, I do.
Um, Callie's changing.<eos> Cool, thanks.<eos> Sorry about that stupid judge. How'd Jude take it?<eos> He was pretty upset, but he definitely understands why I don't want to find this Robert guy.<eos> He does?
I just wanted to say goodnight, and I love you. And call your dad, please, he misses you.<eos> Uh, did he tell you... that Dani's moving in with him?<eos> Danni's moving in?<eos> No, he didn't. It's his life, though I still don't understand why he didn't break up with her, but that's... none of my business, right?<eos> He did.
No, he's not under arrest.<eos> He's just talking to me.<eos> You don't legally have to be in there.<eos> But if Norman wants you in there anyway, - that's fine with me.<eos> - No, I-I don't.
- How long?<eos> Probably a couple of days.<eos> We don't have a couple of days, buddy.<eos> How do you even know if the cops even know anything?<eos> Well, maybe they do, maybe they don't.
So more than $100?<eos> Probably more than your annual salary.<eos> Though I have a car stereo probably costs more than you make, so that ain't sayin' much.<eos> That's a lot of money for a gun that probably doesn't shoot.<eos> The hell it doesn't.
Above a college bar.<eos> And then there's the kid in Florida.<eos> She's fine with her mother.<eos> Yeah, but shouldn't you and her be tryin' to make it work?<eos> We did.
Can you... got to use a glass.<eos> Come on. Seriously.<eos> They're all dirty.<eos> So you like her?<eos> Yeah, I do. Yeah, I really do.
This is the unflushable turd that is left in the can for the next person, e.g. me.<eos> The toilet's still broken, FYI.<eos> Has POTUS gone nuts?<eos> We can't have a crazy president.<eos> In Italy they do.
I can't!<eos> Yes, she's really, really into it.<eos> What's wrong?<eos> - You look like you killed a hooker.<eos> - No, I didn't. Um...
I'll just get her out.<eos> Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.<eos> - What are you doing?<eos> - I'm just gonna help you.<eos> Yeah, don't.
Okay.<eos> Tyreese could have made it, Sasha.<eos> We don't know if anybody got out.<eos> No.<eos> We do.
I just talked to your uncle.<eos> - He's having a meeting with Gloria.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> Did he tell you about Dinaskyu?<eos> He did.
I know that my track record is shit... but I really do love you.<eos> Yeah, well, I hate you.<eos> No, you don't.<eos> No.<eos> No, I don't.
Something much more dangerous.<eos> It's a prototype earthquake machine.<eos> Oh, holy God.<eos> Why would Turner want to destroy the city?<eos> He doesn't.
But you know there was another reason for my reticence.<eos> You're afraid the people will learn that Robert wasn't her biological father.<eos> I managed to get through a criminal trial without the truth coming out, but political campaigns tend to be a bit more adept at extracting skeletons from closets.<eos> But no one else knows.<eos> Someone does.
How he defiled that girl.<eos> He's a showman, nothing more.<eos> All Thackery wants is a goo-goo-eyed puppy, and he has that in you.<eos> How he treats you.<eos> How they all do.
Going off on Lee Berman, that arrogant ass.<eos> Well, I'm sure you could tell him whatever you wanted, and he'd actually listen.<eos> You would think so, yes.<eos> Yes, you would, but it doesn't work that way.<eos> - Why doesn't it?
He wanted to show me a fox den.<eos> He wanted to head into the woods, but I didn't want to come.<eos> - But you didn't mention that before.<eos> -I did. - No.<eos> -Yes, I did.
Sorry. I had a rock-hard one in there.<eos> You know this is a pageant, right?<eos> In which we, the judges, will be ranking young ladies based on their poise, elegance, and talent.<eos> And this young lady has all of the above.<eos> Well, of course she does.
Don't believe I can, we're gonna be busy.<eos> I'm asking Voodoo to dinner.<eos> Italian.<eos> Voodoo?<eos> Um... uh, Bri, Voodoo doesn't really do dinner dates with guys.
That's so cool. To be able to say "dumbass" and stuff like that.<eos> Kazuki. Do I look like someone who had an abortion?<eos> Don't know why they've been saying stuff like that about me behind my back. I didn't have an abortion.<eos> You have to believe me, Kazuki.<eos> Of course you didn't!
- Yeah, there is.<eos> - I want you to understand.<eos> - I do, I understand.<eos> I ran into Shelby this morning, and she explained the whole thing.<eos> Oh, boy. She did, huh?
Do you remember meeting us yesterday at the faculty event?<eos> Yes. And as I recall, you were asked to leave.<eos> Do you remember telling us that you thought Mason was insane?<eos> I never said that.<eos> And didn't you... what?
This is why I have to bug all of the offices.<eos> Now let's get back to the fair.<eos> Lily, when you told me about your project on the bus, I thought it sounded good.<eos> I thought you could win.<eos> - Yeah, we both did.
Oh, I don't like that bed.<eos> Too many lumps.<eos> Maybe you should get a new bed.<eos> Actually, you know what?<eos> I always did like this couch.
I-I can't believe you got a prosecutor to take part in the con. It's not a con.<eos> It's a sting.<eos> Sting.<eos> The prosecutor doesn't know that this is not real.<eos> The Attorney General does.
You know, you really should mend things with your son.<eos> All this anger, this bitterness, this resentment that you're bottling, it's ruining both your lives.<eos> Stop now.<eos> You do not dictate the agenda here.<eos> Who does?
Oh, my God.<eos> You noticed my glitter lotion? Yeah.<eos> Oh, look.<eos> It's on me, too.<eos> At least somebody did.
Well, we found something that belongs to you.<eos> Where'd you get that?<eos> Over at the Fishing Camp.<eos> You know it, don't you?<eos> Sure you do. No, man.
We have two minutes to access the security door.<eos> Shall we?<eos> Lizzy, I know this must be very difficult for you, but we can't both lead.<eos> How did you know about Omaha?<eos> I didn't.
What difference does that make?<eos> That woman died.<eos> I'm the one who has to live with this.<eos> No, Arturo.<eos> You don't.
I got to come clean on this.<eos> You know what else has to come clean?<eos> Garbage Island.<eos> Don't you still want to do your report?<eos> Of course I do!
Well... it was in the line of duty.<eos> Oh, is that what you call it?<eos> Yeah, I had to save the world.<eos> Have you seen how high these things are?<eos> - Yes, you did.
- Bad jokes!<eos> - Bad audience!<eos> - People that don't know comedy!<eos> - I know comedy!<eos> He does, Jim. He really does.
And it's usually when I'm mad.<eos> Why do you want to know so bad?<eos> Well, 'cause last I checked we were dead-broke and we don't have a place to stay, so I was thinking maybe your little spooky routine might be able to hustle us up some options.<eos> You want to do something wrong.<eos> - No, I don't. - Yes, you do.
No, there's not, I'm gonna have to ask.<eos> Gives him a motive, doesn't it?<eos> Absolutely.<eos> He might know.<eos> Guys normally do.
Ran his own business.<eos> Exports, I think.<eos> Certainly lorries in there somewhere.<eos> -Do you have an address?<eos> -Yes. I do.
Exports, I think.<eos> Certainly lorries in there somewhere.<eos> -Do you have an address?<eos> -Yes. I do.<eos> I do.
I couldn't stand it.<eos> I'd end up... ..going mad.<eos> Do you not like your own company?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, I do.
All yours.<eos> -Who grassed me up?<eos> -Who do you think?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I genuinely don't.
-So who?<eos> -Someone responsible.<eos> Someone who knew Stella needed reassurance.<eos> And here's Billy thinking he's got nothing left to lose.<eos> He does, doesn't he?
-Someone responsible.<eos> Someone who knew Stella needed reassurance.<eos> And here's Billy thinking he's got nothing left to lose.<eos> He does, doesn't he?<eos> He does.
A couple of hours drive, max.<eos> So, yeah, maybe six-ish.<eos> So not really "most" of Tuesday, is it?<eos> Did I say that?<eos> Yeah, you did.
Why are you taking care of me?<eos> You found me at the bottom of that ravine.<eos> Fixed my knee.<eos> What the hell are you doing?<eos> Please don't do this.
Well-played, Your Majesty.<eos> You laid waste to everything.<eos> Not everything.<eos> Her castle still stands.<eos> Of course it does.
It seemed the most non-stalkery way to speed things up.<eos> I do love that end table.<eos> That's a start.<eos> I do love you. You know that, right?<eos> Yeah, I do.
Including a child?<eos> What do you know about that?<eos> I saw the way you grabbed Roland back there.<eos> Clearly, you have the touch of a mother.<eos> I do.
Told me what?<eos> The truth about us, Regina.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> How do you know my mother?<eos> The same way you do.
Either way you'll forget everything.<eos> Here's option three.<eos> You tell me why you kidnapped me.<eos> I don't know why you are here.<eos> Seriously, I don't.
Rachel, come on. I said I didn't want to get between you two.<eos> What?<eos> Let's just say that you kicking ass for him isn't the reason you got the day off.<eos> I thought you had law school today.<eos> I do right after this.
Seems like something else is on your mind.<eos> He doesn't just want to work together.<eos> He wants us to keep seeing each other.<eos> And you don't want to risk the one to have the other.<eos> No, I don't.
And I told you, they're coming after you whether you like it or not.<eos> And the difference between me and them is they want to tear your company apart, and I want to keep it together.<eos> You don't have the resources to do that.<eos> Yes,<eos> I do.
The plan is shock and awe.<eos> If we rush a tender offer, we won't have enough leverage to force people to vote with us.<eos> It's fine to have shock and awe when you're the only one in the game. But Walter Gillis knows we're coming and he got himself an ally.<eos> How do you know that?<eos> Because I do.
I guess that means you've decided which relationship you want us to have.<eos> I have.<eos> But it's not what you might think.<eos> If you still want the job, it starts tomorrow.<eos> I do.
Look.<eos> Remember when I said two years ago... We had to concentrate? Us all to Swedish House Mafia<eos> I do not know whether we then used drugs.<eos> We need to focus our subsequent and our solo things have to give.<eos> Yes, you did.
He's brilliant and ego-maniacal and has done more to thwart the rule of law than you and I will probably ever know.<eos> He's a monster.<eos> And he's powerful.<eos> And he thinks he doesn't have a weakness.<eos> But he does.
- Yes.<eos> Will you sign your book for me?<eos> Absolutely.<eos> - Uh, how do you know my work?<eos> - I don't.
You needn't fear.<eos> How could you?<eos> You knew what he was doing.<eos> Or you helped him!<eos> Of course I did.
And it's not like you were abducted by aliens.<eos> And someone did see Zoe later:<eos> Drake.<eos> And you believe him?<eos> Yeah, I do.
It is so cold! My fingers shrank, and now my ring won't stay on.<eos> Did you find out why the heat's not working? Yes.<eos> Yes, I did.
- Don't say anything.<eos> - Okay. It's not that you're more likable.<eos> Just apparently Aunt Winifred is a New York-ist.<eos> You know, somewhere I have about eight billion retorts to that, but, um, right now I got my own Wilkes problem.<eos> That you do.
I'm not sure that research backs Cecil up, but...<eos> (clears throat) Look at that Zoe Hart, just schmoozing with my little Harley.<eos> After how she ruined his birthday.<eos> - Hey, do you like root beer floats?<eos> - Cecil does.
You look clammy.<eos> No, no, I'm-I'm fine.<eos> Um... but you, however, you just look...<eos> Have I mentioned your teeth?<eos> Uh, you did, yeah.
- A little piece of advice.<eos> Take it one snag at a time.<eos> Something I've learned on this job Is you never know when things are gonna... Change.<eos> Artie, I thought we stopped it.<eos> - We did.
Aye, sir.<eos> It may not be prudent to beam aboard an unknown lifeform, Captain.<eos> But you said vital signs are erratic.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> I did.
Some habits... die hard.<eos> You're right about one thing, Lolani.<eos> Everyone has the right to be free.<eos> I wish it didn't matter what happened on that ship but...<eos> Unfortunately it does.
And EMCON Alpha-- Keep us in the dark about what was going on at home.<eos> There's an unmanned refueling station off the coast of France.<eos> If we operate at trail shaft, we should just make it.<eos> How do we know they have enough fuel to get us across the Atlantic?<eos> We don't.
Thank you.<eos> Thanks very much for your business.<eos> Hey.<eos> I didn't think you were coming in this early.<eos> Neither did I, but good news.
- Nerd punch!<eos> - Aah. Lesson four... fighting.<eos> But I didn't learn lessons one through three yet.<eos> Maybe you did, maybe you didn't.<eos> - I didn't. - Or did you?
- But I'll work on it.<eos> And maybe in a year or so... I will.<eos> You know, um... I never finished college, so I could always apply.<eos> Don't ruin the hug. Okay.<eos> Hey. How you doing?
I'm growing too fast.<eos> You're growing too fast?<eos> Where? I-it's all in the note.<eos> You really expect me to believe your mother wrote this note?<eos> Yes, 'cause she actually did.
I sort of always imagined myself a lone wolf in this foxhole, but...<eos> Scooch.<eos> Okay. Why don't you sell me on Kate?<eos> Well, I have a degree in marketing, uh, just as soon as I finish the last three credits.<eos> And most recently, I did the books and marketing over at the federal bar.
Wait.<eos> Your last name's Lefrique?<eos> Okay. Hey.<eos> Lisa, do you take Malik to be your lawfully wedded husband?<eos> I do.
Okay. Hey.<eos> Lisa, do you take Malik to be your lawfully wedded husband?<eos> I do.<eos> Malik, do you take Lisa to be your wife?<eos> I do.
They're tough... especially when the victims are kids, but, you know, at least Vanessa's alive.<eos> It just doesn't make any sense.<eos> So you want the good guys to win.<eos> I want the bad guys to get what's coming to them.<eos> Well, sometimes they do.
I can't even hear a band.<eos> It sounds like everything has been done on a laptop.<eos> Well, I like some old-school stuff.<eos> A little Bob Marley.<eos> Of course you do.
- Exactly! You know, you're the only person that I've told.<eos> I tried to tell Emmett, but then got totally sucker-punched when he told me about his new girlfriend...<eos> Mandy.<eos> - Why should that matter?<eos> - It doesn't.
What's she doing here?<eos> - She's come to beg me not to fight her.<eos> Did she tell you where she keeps sneaking off with Liam?<eos> No.<eos> She didn't.
You stay here.<eos> Tyreese.<eos> Sometimes we have to kill them.<eos> I know that.<eos> But sometimes we don't.
Thought you might like to see a friendly face.<eos> Thank you, but I think I've got it covered.<eos> And there's not a evil preacher teaching Spanish lab.<eos> Well, you never know.<eos> Actually, I do.
- Well, I think... I deserve a glass of wine after that, don't you?<eos> - You want white?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Thank you. - Does everyone have a glass?<eos> - Yes, we do.
No, ma'am.<eos> Not that I can remember.<eos> Hmm.<eos> Well, I guess there are not very many around here that remember my father.<eos> I do, of course.
I'm not going to back away from what I think is right.<eos> And the people out there, they need this to happen.<eos> And so do the people down here.<eos> I need you to have my back.<eos> I do.
- Who can blame her?<eos> - Did she say anything else?<eos> Where she might be going?<eos> Anyone else she was seeing later that day?<eos> No, she didn't.
Fuck you, then.<eos> Hi. Uh, my name is Gomez Pugh with Root Cola.<eos> I was told that you might hangar a biplane that does promotional banners?<eos> Yeah, uh-huh, yeah, yeah, we're looking to do some non-conventional advertising.<eos> You do?
Stop talking to her, okay?<eos> Did you read what's in here?<eos> Depends, would you be mad if I did?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Then nope, I didn't.
Yeah, but I wore 'em better.<eos> Uh... you know whose clothes I just love?<eos> Jennifer Lawrence's.<eos> Did you say Jennifer Lawrence?<eos> Sure did, yo.
- Does none of that matter?<eos> - It does matter.<eos> I'm very grateful.<eos> So why don't you wanna be with me anymore?<eos> I do.
I'm Vikram's widow and my name's on the policy.<eos> Yes, yes, initially it was.<eos> But Mr. Desai made some changes.<eos> You didn't know.<eos> Uh, no, I didn't.
You were feeling a little... Guilty, yes.<eos> Because of what I said.<eos> Okay.<eos> Open your eyes.<eos> You didn't.
Like, mustard and pickles.<eos> Did you get to have your meeting today?<eos> Yeah, I did.<eos> He, thinks I've got a real shot at Huntington Memorial.<eos> Of course you do.
Faster, before I kick your ass!<eos> You don't eat them?<eos> - I don't eat what?<eos> - The eggs. You shell them and don't eat them.<eos> No, I don't.
Her chauffeur says there's nothing wrong with the car that he could find, so there's a mystery.<eos> She's here to see you.<eos> I don't know what she wants.<eos> Don't you?<eos> Because I do.
She just wants someone to understand her and accept her for who she is.<eos> I mean, no one wants to be alone.<eos> So where can I find this guy?<eos> You already know him.<eos> Everybody does.
Hey, about that... boss never told me how you found out about that.<eos> None of your fucking business how we know.<eos> As long as you work for us, this is how it goes.<eos> We don't have a problem, do we?<eos> No, we don't.
"You said I wanted to challenge you in 2016.<eos> "The truth is, I don't.<eos> "You said I wanted the presidency for myself.<eos> "The truth is,<eos> "I do.
What are you doing?<eos> This girl is not what we signed up for. We're not doing this.<eos> Ross: I'm not trying to make you feel bad.<eos> - I'm just saying...<eos> - Good, 'cause I don't.
You're telling me that you really don't know?<eos> No!<eos> I was messed up that night. I don't remember anything.<eos> I don't even remember getting messed up.<eos> Maybe you didn't.
They've got a shot.<eos> They seem to really love each other. For all the right reasons.<eos> Oh, um... Speaking of boyfriends, Pi's letter of recommendation.<eos> He did get the deadline extended, right?<eos> - No, he did.
Where's Hayley?<eos> He doesn't have her.<eos> Please. I know you don't trust him, but you know I wouldn't lie.<eos> He doesn't have her.<eos> Someone does.
What did you say?<eos> - What?<eos> -Your... daughter?<eos> - I didn't say that.<eos> -Yes, you did.
Dude. How are you still single?<eos> It's just hard to meet girls in this city.<eos> Dude, you gotta know someone you can set me up with.<eos> You know what?<eos> No, I don't.
Okay, seriously, Brick?<eos> Now you're taking on the whole world's problems?<eos> Can't we just sit and enjoy our dinner?<eos> Sure, if you want to live in denial.<eos> We do.
I knew you were a professional.<eos> - Professional?<eos> - Scarf, coat.<eos> But you do not have the gun.<eos> Actually, I do.
It just... seemed like you... didn't really want to go.<eos> I didn't.<eos> McGee!<eos> I thought you really liked her!<eos> I did.
I didn't.<eos> McGee!<eos> I thought you really liked her!<eos> I did.<eos> I do.
I have... Someone.<eos> Congratulations.<eos> You know, it's great, Mom.<eos> You deserve to be happy.<eos> - Everybody does. - Yeah.
You're not!<eos> Oliver...<eos> This is your phone.<eos> What do you want?<eos> Same thing you do, Oliver.
All that stuff about living with regret, looking at yourself in the mirror, blah, blah, blah.<eos> So you heard that?<eos> The whole thing.<eos> Then I guess that means you heard me say me and you ain't there yet.<eos> Hey. Hey, boys. How you doing, boys?
We should have stayed in Sherwood.<eos> I wish we'd never set eyes on that damn looking glass.<eos> Getting involved with magic... that was the start of all our trouble.<eos> Anastasia and Will... we already had all the magic we needed, right?<eos> That, they did.
Careful.<eos> If I didn't know better, I'd say you were trying to steal that.<eos> Let go of my hand, mate.<eos> You know Alice trusts you.<eos> You don't.
You don't know anything about my mother.<eos> Don't let her get in your head. She's poison, this one.<eos> If Jafar knows we're here, why would he send you?<eos> He doesn't.<eos> And he didn't.
It's good to see you again, pal.<eos> This makes sense.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> How did you know where to find me?<eos> We didn't.
How could you say that?<eos> I don't know...<eos> I got all confused when you said "honestly".<eos> Look, do I think that you are talented and that you are beautiful?<eos> Of course I do.
- Hey.<eos> You don't remember me do you?<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> - I just made an ass out of myself.<eos> - No, no, no. I... I do.
- I know, freaky deaky, right?<eos> - But how?<eos> - True love conquers all.<eos> - That doesn't make any sense.<eos> Yes, it does.
- Oh, you moron.<eos> - What? Why am I a moron?<eos> Because if you pick Penelope Cruz too, And the day happens to come where you both meet her And you hit it off, you get to have a threesome!<eos> - Even I know that.<eos> - Oh, I didn't...
- And do you, Theresa Kelly, take this man, Tommy, to be your lawfully wedded husband, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah?<eos> Yes, Johnny, I do.<eos> If there is anyone amongst you who knows of any reason why Theresa and Donny should not be joined together...<eos> Speak now or forever hold your peace.<eos> Oh, I do.
Oh, my God.<eos> Do you know who's at the top of my mom's gross sex list?<eos> Howie Mandel.<eos> Wait, your mom has a gross sex list?<eos> Yeah, my whole family does.
It doesn't make you feel like you're on your period.<eos> Midsummer Night's Dream!<eos> Did you tell them?<eos> Tom, how do they know I'm on my period?<eos> They don't.
Midsummer Night's Dream!<eos> Did you tell them?<eos> Tom, how do they know I'm on my period?<eos> They don't.<eos> Okay, well, they do.
Did you tell them?<eos> Tom, how do they know I'm on my period?<eos> They don't.<eos> Okay, well, they do.<eos> We do.
Why?<eos> I...<eos> Just think I have really bad morning breath.<eos> You don't... you do.
You are carrying a child indigo ...<eos> Well, if the seer said ...<eos> It's good.<eos> Yes, being the father of Jesus Christ is not so bad!<eos> Do not do that.
It's that one there, I believe.<eos> Oh, God.<eos> This whole place is ass-backwards, Dewey.<eos> You know that?<eos> How you doing, sweetheart?
It's just not in my DNA to, like, go off.<eos> Senator, a moment ago...<eos> Let's just switch gears...<eos> You said that your behavior toward that soldier in Afghanistan was unforgivable.<eos> - No, I didn't.
But they won't be able to cover everything up, since I leaked some vital information to Internet bloggers, and the New York Times picked it up.<eos> - Sneaky you.<eos> - That's how I roll. - I like that.<eos> - But by the way, how did you know that that guy was wearing a bulletproof vest?<eos> I didn't.
Do it!<eos> Thunderbird Three, back to base camp.<eos> It's over.<eos> OK. Now... Now how do we plan whatever it was that you were just saying?<eos> - I don't...
_<eos> Uh, have you, uh,<eos> - checked the hall closet?<eos> - _<eos> I did.
That would be great. Thank you.<eos> Hey, Jeanne.<eos> Have you heard?<eos> My transfer finally came through.<eos> No, I didn't.
Come on, Barney. I'm desperate.<eos> Okay.<eos> Um... let me find some plastic gloves.<eos> You used gloves when you felt yours?<eos> No, I did not.
How'd you get that name?<eos> _<eos> Look, I don't know what happened between you and your dad, but I trust him.<eos> I know.<eos> I did, too.
So do I.<eos> Ingrid.<eos> What?<eos> This doesn't make sense.<eos> Of course it does.
We don't kill innocents.<eos> The mate's not innocent. They're collateral damage.<eos> We'd be saving lives, and it could take weeks, tracking them down. We don't have that kind of time.<eos> Look, just... tell me where you saw the Mandragora.<eos> I didn't.
When I first found out I was a witch, I brought my aunt Wendy back from the dead.<eos> It was impulsive.<eos> And I did it for all the right reasons just like you.<eos> But what I didn't know was that by doing it, someone I loved had to die.<eos> And they did.
I don't want to kill him yet.<eos> The venom will paralyze him for a couple of hours.<eos> It's enough time for us to find out his plans.<eos> Only problem is, we don't know how to find Tarkoff.<eos> Or maybe we do.
I know the carnage it took to bring me here weighs heavily upon you.<eos> You were always... a gentle child.<eos> I love you.<eos> I love you, too, Grandfather.<eos> Of course you do.
It's standard.<eos> I'm... a little... overwhelmed.<eos> - God, you must hate me.<eos> - No.<eos> No, no. I don't.
Get inside!<eos> Tunc evanescunt ostium!<eos> I'm not bleeding anymore.<eos> Told you I knew we'd make it.<eos> No, you didn't.
Did you know Kyle well?<eos> No, ma'am, I can't say I did.<eos> Do you like being here?<eos> The Academy's taught me how to be disciplined, courageous, serve the greater good, to be a man.<eos> Yes, ma'am, I most certainly do.
I like to know all the details of a story before I tell it.<eos> Jack told you what Conrad did to his family?<eos> Yes.<eos> - How did you know?<eos> - I didn't.
Which means she lied to the police.<eos> You look so beautiful.<eos> It was a like a real-live fairy tale.<eos> You've gotta remember something.<eos> I don't.
The point is, you need to go get slapped in the face by a bunch of gullible chicks Barney banged.<eos> I'm a friend of Barney Stinson. Ooh!<eos> I'm a friend of Barney Stins... I-I'm-I'm a friend of Barney Stinson. Aah!<eos> I'm so sorry. I thought you said you were a friend of Barney Stinson.<eos> I did. Ooh!
Right?<eos> Sit, please, Paul.<eos> I'm in need of a new monitor.<eos> You have a monitor?<eos> She did.
Unless you don't want her anymore.<eos> Of course we want her.<eos> It is not a question of whether we want Callie.<eos> It is... it is whether she wants us.<eos> - She does.
But I really think we need to break up.<eos> If you're interested in using me as sperm donor, I'm in.<eos> If you wanna use Timothy, I think we should get together, all three of us, talk about it.<eos> The lawyer would like to know if you two would like to see your father first.<eos> - Oh, we don't.
Of what?<eos> Of being here whenever you need my shoulder to cry on.<eos> What about when I need you?<eos> What about when I needed to talk to you the other day and you just blew me off?<eos> I didn't, I...
North Park.<eos> Now the lawyer spoke to your father, and he has agreed to sign away his parental rights.<eos> That's good.<eos> But the lawyer would like to know if you two would like to see your father first.<eos> Oh, we don't.
- And I have to see him.<eos> 'Cause we both have to be there at the test, to make sure that nothing gets switched or whatever.<eos> I know you didn't want to know anything about him.<eos> Guess I don't have a choice.<eos> Some people do.
- Great show.<eos> - You were awesome!<eos> It was amazing, really.<eos> But we have to go.<eos> We do?
My dad thinks Jude is gay.<eos> That's why I can't spend the night at your house anymore.<eos> I see.<eos> - Did he say that to Jude?<eos> - No. But I did.
You're totally gonna get it.<eos> What about you?<eos> How was your dance auditions?<eos> Did you guys find your girl? Oh, yeah.<eos> We did.
But I guess since Cole identifies as a boy, that means Devonee's...<eos> - Don't ask me.<eos> - Does Rita know?<eos> There's lots of underground stuff going on right now that Rita doesn't know about, or at least she pretends she don't.<eos> - Um, how many chairs did Rita?
- What does that mean?<eos> I can't find one family that wants me. You got two.<eos> The Quinns?<eos> They don't want me to live with them.<eos> And even if they did, I...
Make sure you tag it, too.<eos> How did you get in here?<eos> I've been in here for a long time.<eos> It walked right to that evidence crate like it knew where it was going.<eos> Not like. It did.
Um... there's a guy.<eos> What guy?<eos> There's a guy I owed a favor to, and he wanted me to do something for him.<eos> I tried to get it done.<eos> I really did.
How many there gotta be in this state?<eos> We don't have the time to figure it out.<eos> - There's gotta be a lot of them.<eos> - The truth is I don't know how to narrow the search.<eos> I do.
We're ready for you.<eos> I didn't mean to fall asleep.<eos> Sorry.<eos> That's okay, but we only have the studio for another 40 minutes, so if you want to lay something down...<eos> Yeah, I do.
This is too damn big to just shove down and deal with later, Rayna. Talk to me.<eos> - Tea?<eos> - No, I don't want tea. I want you to talk, all right?<eos> If anybody understands how complicated your relationship with Lamar was, it's me.<eos> - You don't.
You got to watch her grow up.<eos> It's not the same.<eos> You know that's not the same, Rayna.<eos> You ever sing her to sleep? Mm-hmm.<eos> I never did.
Thank you for that, and for saving me from that maniac.<eos> He was just trying to kill Owen.<eos> Where is Owen?<eos> How did he disappear?<eos> He didn't.
What's happened?<eos> Right.<eos> I apologise for leaving you in the lurch.<eos> Well, you've got to go.<eos> Of course you do.
♪ Land of the myrtle and... ♪<eos> Dooley?<eos> Sister Haynes!<eos> You remember me.<eos> Of course I do.
They wouldn't be after us if this wasn't real.<eos> This is my chance to tell a story that really matters.<eos> I love you, Ben.<eos> Do you love me?<eos> Of course, I do.
What is your point, sir?<eos> That protection was always in your blood.<eos> Makes me wonder... how far would you go to protect Gabriel?<eos> Do I need a lawyer?<eos> Yes, you do.
A handle.<eos> What a revolutionary idea.<eos> So it's still a piece of shit copy of a boring box?<eos> Joe, she gave the binder to IBM.<eos> You did what?
Come here. Hey.<eos> - Oh, Jesus.<eos> Let me get that for you.<eos> Did you get the medication?<eos> - I did, I did.
Come on, brother.<eos> Hey! Look who made it.<eos> - Hey!<eos> - Hey!<eos> How you doing, ugly?
He thought I wanted to get back together, but I just wanted to take the power back. So I used him this time.<eos> It was awesome.<eos> Because, let's be honest, there's no sex like ex sex.<eos> I wouldn't know.<eos> Well, I didn't before this.
- Of course it is, but there is no one more capable of rising to the occasion than you.<eos> Trust me.<eos> I really hope you're right, because right now it...<eos> Doesn't feel like it.<eos> Hey. Good morning, kiddo. How you doing this morning?
You wouldn't even let me come to my own brother's funeral.<eos> You know why I did that.<eos> You know what?<eos> I don't want to dwell on the past anymore.<eos> I don't.
But you hurt my feelings because...<eos> I don't know.<eos> I felt like we had a thing.<eos> I did too.<eos> "Did."
He'll be back in Boston in five hours, done and done.<eos> - I can't do that to him, Beth.<eos> - Can't you though?<eos> All you do is talk about how much you miss him.<eos> I do, but...
Just checking in before you go to sleep.<eos> Oh, and don't panic if you hear an alarm in the middle of the night.<eos> We have your bed set to alert us if you get up.<eos> Every time I get up?<eos> Yes, and sometimes when you don't.
This Mr. "Steak Very Rare," Mrs. "Wouldn't This Wallpaper Look Good In Our Den?"<eos> I just had you up against the wall in our bathroom.<eos> That doesn't exactly qualify us for the cover of The Saturday Evening Post, does it?<eos> Did you like that?<eos> I did.
But as long as I'm yours and you're mine... That's enough for me.<eos> Uh, dinner is in 15 minutes.<eos> You were saying something about Hendricks?<eos> About his, uh, not wanting Negroes in the study?<eos> Hendricks doesn't.
It may be the only fun of the night.<eos> Bill certainly has had a lot lo drink tonight.<eos> I think Bill may have lost his mind.<eos> Yes.<eos> I do, too.
Why not?<eos> - Virginia? - Yes?<eos> You got any plans tonight?<eos> Not at the moment.<eos> Well, you do now.
If there are other witnesses, why are you talking to me?<eos> Because most of them are coloured folks.<eos> The few white witnesses won't talk, and the police aren't about to start an investigation based on the testimony of a bunch of negroes.<eos> So if you did see something...<eos> I didn't.
And after the first time?<eos> Uh, the-- the pain was lessened.<eos> But then once I realized that the circumstances were inappropriate--<eos> Does he know who I was with?<eos> He does.
I admit that.<eos> But... but this is the way back.<eos> I'm broken, and you're the one... you... you're the only one who can fix me.<eos> So, you consider the relationship to have a higher purpose now?<eos> I do.
I'd be dead if it weren't for you.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Kira, you must know something about Anton.<eos> That's why they tried to kill you.<eos> I don't.
Kate Renner?<eos> How could she know about...<eos> It was decades ago. Burton Delaney.<eos> - Mary, you couldn't possibly believe...<eos> - Oh, but I do.
What?<eos> Where are you going?<eos> - I'm done for the day.<eos> - You saved somebody's life man.<eos> No, no, that doctor did.
You're James St. Patrick.<eos> You know, I tried to run a background check on you, and no one in the nightlife world seems to know who you are.<eos> I was expecting a fat Irish guy.<eos> Well, I hope I can meet your other expectations.<eos> I do, too.
Where's he gonna go?<eos> Why do you care all of a sudden? I'm riding with you.<eos> I got a right to know.<eos> Okay, why don't you tell me about how you shot a guy?<eos> Which you did, right?
I gotta get back on shift.<eos> I'll drop you off at Nicole's.<eos> She'll take you till Mom's off.<eos> Nah, I have to go to school.<eos> No, you don't.
It's not far, it's not far.<eos> Shit!<eos> That's Johnny Appleseed!<eos> You know him?<eos> Everyone does.
Dude, hey.<eos> I owe you a big apology, man.<eos> I had no idea who you were before and I read all this coverage about your company online, and I was like, "Hey, Pied Piper!<eos> "I met this dude! He came into the store "and told me my parking app was fucking awesome!"<eos> I did?
I made a mistake.<eos> I wanna make it right.<eos> Just like that?<eos> Do you want me here?<eos> Of course, I do.
I'll bet you didn't know he still has a baby tooth.<eos> Ooh, is it the one that's cold-sensitive?<eos> I know, and he can only drink from his left side.<eos> (laughs) Well, I'll bet you didn't know he was an amateur magician.<eos> I didn't.
You could have...<eos> Come here.<eos> [Remy] What about the current mayor?<eos> [Olivia] He doesn't use this office.<eos> [Luke] Nobody does.
Sweet Randi Jenkins. You're beautiful on the inside.<eos> Not that one.<eos> I'm so glad we're friend again.<eos> Oh, no, not that poor, unstable girl. Excuse me, excuse me, coming through.<eos> Hey, everybody! How we doing here today?
I... I just wish I knew more.<eos> I know where he kept the adoption papers.<eos> He told me he was hanging on to them in case you ever...<eos> Do you want to find your child?<eos> Of course I do.
Friday night.<eos> You're on.<eos> Come on.<eos> Let's get you home.<eos> So he did it out-of-state.
No, but coming back to your place, it just feels so...<eos> I really like you, Rico, but I'm just not ready.<eos> Yeah, o... okay.<eos> It's okay. I mean, I don't want to have sex with you.<eos> You don't?
Demons have been known to speak backwards.<eos> Just to up the creep factor.<eos> Isolating the audio...<eos> Let's see if this works.<eos> Indeed it does.
Come on.<eos> How are you feeling, Mr. Clarke?<eos> It says here you have appendicitis. Is that correct?<eos> Do you mind if I check, please?<eos> They did that already.
Oh, my God, that's them.<eos> Who?<eos> Do you seriously have no idea who that is?<eos> Do none of you read the show choir blogs?<eos> No, Blaine, we don't.
Well, that's too bad.<eos> Because as a friend, I would tell you that... Los Angelicos does not have the manpower or the firepower to take on the Metas.<eos> But I do.<eos> I don't need your help.<eos> SAM: But your community does.
You get this product back in the US. You go back to working for Hot Rod.<eos> How does that sound right about now?<eos> I think we're good with that.<eos> I'm guessing that don't apply to me.<eos> No, cousin, it does not.
Where is he?<eos> I spoke to him this morning after they found Tetazoo.<eos> Did he tell you where he was going?<eos> Yeah.<eos> He did.
And of course, you made fun of me, because you were supposed to be strong. But I saw how much you wished it was you.<eos> And that's probably why we never hung out after that, 'cause you were embarrassed that I saw that.<eos> And you think I'm the same. You think that I killed Lana. I get it.<eos> You didn't have to drive all the way out here to tell me that.<eos> But I don't, Trent.
Okay, I'm sorry.<eos> I shouldn't have even bothered to...<eos> I didn't think you were a junkie, I just needed to know what it was.<eos> Do you think I gave you AIDS?<eos> - Oh, you did.
- Right. What's your original name?<eos> I don't remember.<eos> Really?<eos> Well, do you remember the address of your childhood home?<eos> Yes, I do.
We should buy you some clothes now.<eos> - Why do you hate my shirt?<eos> - You don't listen.<eos> - Oh, I listen.<eos> - No, you still don't.
That's how the city survives.<eos> Founding law.<eos> "For the protection and good of all, gates are inviolable."<eos> We have a right to leave.<eos> We all do.
Let's talk.<eos> What do you want to chat about?<eos> The weather?<eos> How I slept last night?<eos> 'Cause I didn't.
The weather?<eos> How I slept last night?<eos> 'Cause I didn't.<eos> Not much, anyway.<eos> That about does it for me.
To feel that kind of rejection from your -- your father makes you feel like, um...<eos> It made me feel like there was something wrong with me... No...<eos> Something, uh...<eos> Something bad, unlovable.<eos> I still do.
I need any details you can give me about that box Nolan has hidden in his house.<eos> I'm hiring someone to go in there and get it.<eos> I can do it.<eos> Or do you not trust me?<eos> Of course I do.
Emily's recovering in my house, and I need every bit of leverage I can get against her before she recovers her memory.<eos> Memory of what?<eos> You didn't shoot her.<eos> No, I didn't.<eos> Daniel did.
Wait. I...<eos> We've known each other a long time, Gary.<eos> You're hurting.<eos> I know that. A lot of folks know that.<eos> Yeah, do they?
But these past weeks, that faith has been replaced with certainty.<eos> I am here for a reason, as are you, as is everyone aboard this ship.<eos> You are here to lead us, And we are here to follow, to execute your vision.<eos> I don't have a vision.<eos> You do.
I thought I knew my son, too.<eos> Emma tried to warn me that he needed help.<eos> Small things... I didn't listen.<eos> Mrs. Clark, do you think we're reunited with loved ones after death?<eos> Yes, I do.
Contact!<eos> Danny, do it!<eos> You rocked it, man!<eos> You really rocked it!<eos> We did it, sir.
What is it with you and having opinions?<eos> Well, you got to have an opinion.<eos> No, you don't, Jim.<eos> No, you don't.<eos> Yes, you do.
Open the door!<eos> [Groaning]<eos> [Mark]:<eos> Once he sees us, he'll come around.<eos> What if he doesn't?
I always knew you were capable of murder, but mass murder?<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> You're telling me you know nothing about the outbreak in Puerto Rico?<eos> NARVIK A. You don't know about that?<eos> Of course he does.
And you must be the child thief!<eos> Tulok, no!<eos> - We came to help these people.<eos> Sergio says you don't have enough snowmobiles to evacuate.<eos> Now you do.
It was soaked in Jenna's blood.<eos> I just wanted it off me.<eos> Did you tell Detective McCandless the shirt was in the closet?<eos> No.<eos> I didn't.
Have been for 27 years.<eos> So you work for Holland Knox?<eos> Yes. I used to work for his predecessor Wes Tarkington.<eos> Jamie: And when you worked for deputy chief Tarkington, did you ever see a copy of a statement of complaint submitted by my client Lee Anne Marcus?<eos> Yes, I did. Jamie:
Objection.<eos> Argumentative.<eos> Sustained.<eos> You best have a point, Mr. City Attorney.<eos> I do, Your Honor.
Is that a yes or a no?<eos> I interviewed a private pilot who claims you are convinced that Joe Carroll was trying to get on his plane.<eos> Why would he lie about that? I don't know.<eos> Maybe he was trying to lie his way into your next book. We both know the truth doesn't matter to you.<eos> Yes, it does, Ryan.
Well, my parents, they're out of town as of an hour ago, and people miss class all the time.<eos> It's not like-- Yeah, that's true.<eos> Do you want me to say?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, I do.
And then mine.<eos> So we drank together, we took drugs together, we played with each other sexually, - you gave me your gun...<eos> - You took my gun...<eos> Your forced me to tie you up, but we never had sex together,<eos> - did we?
I think he's got a gun.<eos> Okay, call it in. I'll back up his partner.<eos> No, I'll go! I'll go.<eos> Wait, you saw a gun?<eos> Partner did.
- So he made it?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Except one of the bullets hit his spine.<eos> Doctors don't know what that means yet.<eos> Yeah, they do.
Since that night, I've been struggling to reconcile how doing everything right could lead to such a horribly wrong result.<eos> And yet... If I were in that situation again, I'd do the same thing.<eos> And do I regret it?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, ma'am, I do.
Nothing.<eos> She was assaulted two nights ago.<eos> Oh, right. Yeah, yeah.<eos> She tell you that?<eos> No, a doctor did.
Come check this out.<eos> This is surveillance from that security camera at the entrance of the roller coaster repair yard.<eos> Ted enters alone at 8:47 P.M.<eos> Did anyone enter prior to that? No.<eos> But about 15 minutes later at 9:04 P.M., someone does.
And since the coke's in the shape of a Poppin' Fresh costume and taint sweaty, I'm taking off another 50.<eos> The hell you are!<eos> Can I finish? Can I finish?<eos> Since Ramón gave his word that you people wouldn't bring any guns...<eos> Hey, we didn't, not even my underwear gun.
You have to press the button.<eos> The what?<eos> You dated Burt Reynolds!<eos> They don't have the coke, lickbag!<eos> We do! Right here in the Trans Am!
Okay.<eos> Oh, that's really funny.<eos> Thanks, Cyril.<eos> I-I think we needed that.<eos> We did.
You just need a little more rest.<eos> I think your family should probably leave.<eos> I'm sorry, what?<eos> I thought you guys should go.<eos> Yeah, so did we.
I'm not much of a cat person.<eos> You know, you look into a dog's eyes, and you can see its soul, and you look into a cat's eyes, and you see a soul thants wto kill you in your sleep.<eos> But there would be no cuter way to go.<eos> Do you want to rip my throat out?<eos> Yes, you do. Yes, you do.
What?<eos> Why? Why?<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> I need a manager who cares about me as much as about what me can do for him.<eos> I do, Goldie, very much so.
Shall we?<eos> Get me a refill.<eos> I like when you order me around.<eos> I'm serious.<eos> I do.
Look, I'm not one to preach to anybody, but last year, after my injury, when things went South, the reason I made it through is because I went to Dawson and asked for help.<eos> The doctor was sure it's a temporary thing.<eos> The cobwebs are gonna clear up.<eos> You hear what I said? I need to know you heard what I said.<eos> I did, yeah.
We talking before or after the accident?<eos> Chief Boden.<eos> Oh, no, no. Please call me Wallace.<eos> Um, I heard you had a cabinet needed fixing.<eos> [Laughs] Oh, yes, I do.
Well, it seems to me the problem with the world is that fools and fanatics are always so full of passionate certainty.<eos> I'm in no hurry to count myself among them.<eos> What about ghosts?<eos> Do I believe in them?<eos> Do you?
Now we got an entire network meeting and you're gonna go deal with some bullshit at the club?<eos> They're shutting the club down, Tommy!<eos> We wash more money up in there than we do at every other front we got combined.<eos> You want me to just fuck this off?<eos> - Hell, yeah, I do.
Yeah, and I'll help.<eos> Hey, don't you go nowhere.<eos> All right, I'm just gonna say it.<eos> I like her.<eos> Actually, I do too.
Then why didn't she close the door?<eos> Because...<eos> Because she knows you're watching her.<eos> She does not.<eos> Of course she does.
No, she couldn't.<eos> Not alone, anyway.<eos> The only other exit is by the windows.<eos> But there's only two sets of keys, and Charlotte didn't have either of them.<eos> Who did?
It's a bear.<eos> We're talking ortho, plastics... you need, what, five surgeons total?<eos> - Reycraft...<eos> - Look, you know what Charles de Gaulle said.<eos> No, I don't, and neither do you.
You know the terms of our clinical trial...<eos> Any implant removed from participants becomes the sole property of Sabian Medical Devices.<eos> What, is that the only reason that you wanted to conduct the autopsy... just to get your prosthesis? (sighs)<eos> If there is a design flaw here, I want to know about it, and I want to get it fixed.<eos> - Yeah, we all do. - (chuckles) Okay.
Jules, what's going on?<eos> I didn't know how to tell Trav and Laurie that they were pregnant, because I didn't know how they'd react.<eos> But they're doing so great-- I mean, pretend-marriage great-- that I thought, "Well, this is exciting news!"<eos> So how do you deliver exciting news?<eos> You do it with a party!
Stop!<eos> Can't you see you're in the Escarfail case again?<eos> And now Bénady? 2 murders!<eos> I don't give a damn if she dated an older guy, unless it relates to Pascale or Elsa!<eos> Does it or not?
What if we advertise?<eos> Put an ad in Craigslist, one of those local business things?<eos> Yeah, we can get some meth heads to hand out flyers and shit.<eos> - And pay them how?<eos> -We don't.
Sometimes you get your heart broken.<eos> Sometimes nothing changes at all.<eos> But sometimes...<eos> Just sometimes...<eos> Everything does.
Why hide your knackers under a skirt for the rest of your...<eos> Maybe there is a man under that dress after all.<eos> I wouldn't put it past that one.<eos> Not normal, is it?<eos> All that celibacy does funny things to a man.
-Just tell me...<eos> -I must ask you to leave.<eos> -..how long have you been there?<eos> Just talk to me. Don't say anything to anybody, will you?<eos> Please don't.
I-I'm very grateful to you all for coming today.<eos> However, I do not share my uncle's view.<eos> I hold no ill will toward the North Koreans who captured me.<eos> I had no right to be in their country in the first place.<eos> -None of us did.
-You never loved me.<eos> -Ah, the penny drops!<eos> -It was all an act.<eos> -Of course I loved you.<eos> I still do.
You're unbelievable.<eos> She just took you on a weekend trip to wine country for your birthday.<eos> I know, and then, she brought up horoscopes.<eos> You don't have a caring bone in your body.<eos> Yes, I do.
There's not enough drama in your own life, so you had to meddle in mine.<eos> No, that's not it at all.<eos> Look... my mom's a recovering alcoholic, so I know what it's like.<eos> You're scared that if anybody finds out what's going on, you might never get her back, so you keep lying to yourself, hoping it'll get better.<eos> But it doesn't.
I didn't mean to scare you at the pool earlier.<eos> I was telling you the truth.<eos> I don't remember what you said.<eos> And I don't care.<eos> Yes, you do.
Let me guess... off the charts.<eos> I really can't discuss my findings.<eos> Last week?<eos> But she called here this morning.<eos> In fact, she did, yes.
Did you track down whoever Madison was seeing?<eos> As far as I can tell, she wasn't seeing anybody.<eos> But these are her financials.<eos> - What kind of high-school kid has financials?<eos> - Madison does.
Blake, I've had it up to here!<eos> I'm sorry, Mr. Blake, I told he can't come in here!<eos> Jesus Christ, Amy.<eos> Ed, did she say you couldn't come in here?<eos> - Yes, she did.
My wife's working late, I'm on daddy duty.<eos> But you're ready for this, right?<eos> I just need to put my precious babies to bed with a story.<eos> The ebony falcon needs to read go, dog, go.<eos> Yeah, he does.
(brandon) whew!<eos> 'sup?<eos> Good workout. You know, it's weird I never worked out with you before.<eos> What'd you say your regular gym was?<eos> I didn't.
But don't worry.<eos> We're gonna be just fine.<eos> - 'Cause you know what I got? - Hmm?<eos> Motivation.<eos> And now so do you.
- Well, that was a good score.<eos> - With a bad mark. You only went after that guy 'cause Big Jim kicked Dad out of Houston.<eos> You made it personal, and that's why you blew it.<eos> No, I blew it because I didn't have the right boxman with me.<eos> Well, now you do.
And Kyle knows that.<eos> I am doing everything that I can to help you, Detective.<eos> As I told you that I would.<eos> Did you see the girl?<eos> One of my boys did.
So you ambushed him? No.<eos> We asked him a few questions.<eos> We're conducting a murder investigation, Colonel.<eos> - I thought you wanted to help.<eos> - I do.
Every time I've ever opened the door, the only thing I've gotten back from you is that disappointed, shitty look of yours.<eos> You don't know me.<eos> You have never known me.<eos> That's the problem.<eos> No one does.
She touch you, Kyle?<eos> - She feel you up? - Enough...<eos> She never touched me.<eos> She always wanted me to touch her, okay?<eos> Did you?
as a favor to me?<eos> Sure thing.<eos> Uh, do you have a safe place to stay for the time being, ma'am?<eos> Yes.<eos> She does.
We both were.<eos> W-what's going on?<eos> Y-y-you said something about Val?<eos> Yeah, just that she hates me now...<eos> - Everybody does.
Actually, I hated it.<eos> I don't know anything about classical music.<eos> Well, you certainly picked it.<eos> I mean, you probably thought, you know, "Good old Beethoven,"<eos> Yeah, I did.
Will they survive?<eos> Who cares?<eos> Looks good from here, Private Hill.<eos> Yes, dude, you passed.<eos> Damn right I did.
Like a...<eos> Like a firefly.<eos> Security system wasn't triggered.<eos> Then how did they get in?<eos> They didn't.
What's next?<eos> You gonna join the Yearbook Club?<eos> Just trying to do something nice. Why?<eos> Who cares?<eos> He does.
I don't know.<eos> Is that going to just get more people hurt?<eos> Maybe.<eos> I don't think guns work on them.<eos> Then what does?
I really think I should tell them.<eos> They're going to want to know the story.<eos> The whole story.<eos> I really think they should know.<eos> Yes, I do.
Should all four of us be going to the same place?<eos> Where else has Stiles been showing up?<eos> School, the hospital.<eos> Okay, hold on.<eos> We did this already.
- What? - Hmm?<eos> So I am thinking about dinner. Your favorite, TacoFino.<eos> I'll buy if you pick up. Ooh!<eos> You had me at "Taco". I had you at dinner.<eos> You did.
I promise you'll never have to leave your home.<eos> Never.<eos> Is that... how you know 20,000 Leagues so well?<eos> Did he read it to you, too?<eos> Yeah, he did.
I have no idea.<eos> Hey.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Do you mind telling me what the fuck is going on?<eos> Actually, yeah, I do.
Well, I suspect I don't have much time left on this Earth, but whatever time I do have,<eos> I know I want it to be better than this.<eos> So you have a plan?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yes, I do.
We do have a few questions to ask you, though, okay?<eos> There were, uh, cinder blocks in your car, as well as a coil of rope.<eos> And your trunk was lined with plastic. Did you know that?<eos> I-I'm sorry, I don't know...<eos> But no, I-I didn't.
He says, "is Camomile a vegetarian?<eos> No, I'm not gonna say that.<eos> Well, come on. What is he saying?<eos> He knows another way that you can get some protein in you.<eos> He did that, not me.
- Who? - Rumplestiltskin.<eos> That's what this is about?<eos> You're jealous of me?<eos> You still don't realize what you had.<eos> You never did.
Shelby won't sell you Fancie's 'cause your dad tried to sabotage her cabaret.<eos> 15 years.<eos> Goes a lot deeper than nooks and crannies.<eos> That's why I know what you're gonna say next.<eos> No, you don't.
Called me a Mexican?<eos> You're doing it again.<eos> I'm bending over backwards to not be racist right now.<eos> All right. Well, what did he say when you told him I wasn't Mexican?<eos> I didn't.
I found a way to keep you safe.<eos> Stopping time isn't gonna keep him safe.<eos> It's gonna keep you both trapped.<eos> You have to believe things are gonna turn out for the best.<eos> What if they don't?
- Do not say the Time Capsule.<eos> - The Time Capsule! Come on.<eos> You said it.<eos> You said it.<eos> Yes, I did.
I wouldn't put it past them.<eos> You don't half talk a lot of rubbish, Alfie.<eos> See you don't stay out too late now.<eos> You know me.<eos> Yes. I do!
Why would you even think that?<eos> Because... I'm different.<eos> People think I'm strange.<eos> No, they don't.<eos> You do.
I would love to accommodate you, Mr. Richards. Give me a reason to.<eos> I'm not the only one the FBI will be interested in.<eos> If they take me, they take Jacob Langston, too.<eos> Do you really think that I care what happens to that little freak of nature?<eos> Maybe not... but he does.
Eliminate the threat.<eos> The graves of Asgard's enemies are littered with men who underestimated Sif.<eos> Do not make the same mistake.<eos> You do not know her.<eos> No, I don't.
Hmm?<eos> I'll drive you, you can Uber back.<eos> I didn't even say we were going.<eos> Yeah, I know you didn't.<eos> I did. Huh?
Which is what? "Vampire" in-<eos> - Romanian.<eos> Now, take away the cape, the fangs, the accent.<eos> He's a predator, a leech, a blemish. And I know it's hard to believe, but-<eos> Even I didn't at first.
- There she is, my beautiful daughter.<eos> - Hola, Mama.<eos> Dr. Martinez, this is her third incident.<eos> I understand. But please, she loves it here.<eos> I do not.
- He won't live long.<eos> - Good.<eos> - Alex. - You didn't even know him.<eos> What?<eos> What? And you did?
You're cute.<eos> Black or camo?<eos> Fiona, hi.<eos> Did you not get your last check?<eos> No, I did.
Vincent?<eos> Well, it looks like you have little fans everywhere in America now.<eos> Don't you, Mr. Keller?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, I do.
But I'm a profiler.<eos> I was so focused on who he had been that I couldn't see what he had become.<eos> I know what that's like.<eos> Okay, you got to go.<eos> Yeah, I do.
It'll make you do the craziest things.<eos> Guys, what if they're married?<eos> Let me help you with your coat.<eos> Your wife mentioned you two were looking to have a good time tonight.<eos> Ah, she did, did she?
His partner in crime.<eos> Now, how do you think he dealt with that?<eos> Do you recognize any of these women?<eos> How many times are we gonna go through this?<eos> No, I do not.
I'm flushing out my system.<eos> I'm gonna recharge, so I'm ready for the right man.<eos> And until then, I'm putting my mind and body and my soul into fiance's.<eos> And listen, I know that you want to be more of a silent partner now...<eos> Yes, I do. Very much.
Well, then, I hope the open house goes well, 'cause it sounds to me like it's best for both of you once you move on.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I've been horrible, haven't I?<eos> He drives me crazy, but I don't want to see him suffer.<eos> I don't.
I don't think you're cardiac material, but you have improved leaps and bounds as a surgeon, Alex.<eos> Okay, perfect fit.<eos> Like a 6-4-3 double play.<eos> I didn't know you liked baseball.<eos> Oh, I don't.
So, are we gonna go with Sam?<eos> I think.<eos> You?<eos> Does he look like a Sam to you?<eos> He does, yeah.
- I think I like Maura.<eos> - You can't like Maura.<eos> - Why not?<eos> Because it's Maura, that's why.<eos> - You did.
I'd lose time.<eos> They said I did it, but in my heart, I know I didn't.<eos> After the fifth appeal, I gave up.<eos> You finally figured out no one believes you?<eos> Someone did.
- I get it. I really do.<eos> But I'm glad Maldonado put us together.<eos> Am I really the reason that you want to stay on the force?<eos> I... uh, no, I never said that.<eos> To the interviewer you did.
I think you should probably call me Sergeant Perez.<eos> Aw, come on, little budget Jessica Alba.<eos> It's girls' night!<eos> She needs a nickname.<eos> - No, I don't. - Yes...
Uh, Bob?<eos> I think your coffee machine's broken.<eos> How did your book meeting go?<eos> Yeah, does Bridget Ellis really want to publish your novel?<eos> Yes, she does.
Neal!<eos> He's in big trouble.<eos> You had the ball, you were almost to the end zone, and then on the 1-yard line, you grabbed the knife and stabbed the ball.<eos> - Hey, leave him alone.<eos> He did okay.
I'm sure Katie can explain this.<eos> And you think she'll tell the truth?<eos> - Yes. I trust our daughter.<eos> - Oh, and I don't?<eos> I don't, actually.
Ok.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I was... really trying to help.<eos> Well, at least no one knows.<eos> - Ana does.
I would give anything to take it back, to make things right.<eos> Anything?<eos> Yes... anything.<eos> How am I supposed to trust a man who no longer believes in love?<eos> I still do.
Come.<eos> My lord, are the mechanisms ready?<eos> No.<eos> Oh, I thought for a moment you'd said, "no."<eos> I did.
I wish you the best of luck, Your Excellency.<eos> He is a fine general.<eos> Thank you for this promotion, sir.<eos> - I pray I do you proud.<eos> - As do I.
She's got to know how to end them.<eos> Mara created The Troubles?<eos> Yeah, I thought you knew.<eos> I just figured Vince or Nathan would have told you.<eos> No, they didn't.
Like Gabe, for example. What do you mean, "like Gabe"?<eos> Well, you know he's leaving, right?<eos> Not, like, for good. He's just leaving the precinct.<eos> He didn't tell you?<eos> No, he didn't.
Except for you.<eos> You are the kindest, most ethical person I've ever met.<eos> Okay, I'm a, I'm a happily, happily, happily...<eos> Oh, I don't want you to leave your wife.<eos> You don't?
You listen to me, bubba.<eos> You left because you had to.<eos> And I have to believe, deep down, Big Max knew that.<eos> Do I know you?<eos> No, you don't.
Well, well, look who we have here.<eos> You had no right to kill that man.<eos> He was a good man.<eos> - You had no goddamn right.<eos> - Oh, actually, I do.
Listen, Arlene, do not say anything to him, all right?<eos> - I'm on my way. - Okay.<eos> So... -...should I use this on you?<eos> How much does it say to use?<eos> It doesn't.
No, she was not.<eos> She was one of the good folks.<eos> Did you get the son of a bitch that did it to her? Mm-hm.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, I sure did.
We are royalty.<eos> Dwarves have an innate fear of us.<eos> Maybe because we killed so many of them in the past.<eos> I just realized that if you're always watching did you know I was infecting Bill when he was feeding off of me?<eos> I did.
Really?<eos> Oh, it's not my house. It belongs to my father-in-law.<eos> Your father-in-law's Bruce Butler?<eos> Yeah. You know him?<eos> - Yeah. Well, who doesn't? - Oh, right.
He believed in me until I could believe in myself.<eos> You have to trust him, Robert.<eos> I want to.<eos> All you have to do is believe in him.<eos> I do, I do, but--
Okay.<eos> She just went upstairs to use the bathroom.<eos> Everybody take your positions.<eos> Come on.<eos> How you doing?
She was stabbed 67 times with a meat fork.<eos> Listen, when you start working and you have to pay bills of your own, we'll see how quick you are to snub your nose at a bargain.<eos> I can see why you never open your mouth, Graeme. Don't blame him.<eos> He thought you'd already told me.<eos> - Why didn't you?
You won't even know I'm here.<eos> Now... where were we?<eos> Are you okay?<eos> Oh, you heard that?<eos> Yeah, we did.
The reason we couldn't find her is because she hasn't used her maiden name in over 20 years.<eos> So Guy Ingram and Burns' wife were gonna run away together.<eos> Burns must've found out and made sure that didn't happen.<eos> All right, how do we get to Sally Ann?<eos> We don't.
I know, but you need my dad more than me to figure out who the witch is... to save the town.<eos> You need to do this.<eos> I've never done anything like that before... not that big.<eos> Do it to save you and Henry.<eos> Do it.
I found him... but I was too late.<eos> He's gone, Henry.<eos> [voice breaking] He was a good man, and he would have been a great father.<eos> There's one thing I need you to know about him... he was a hero.<eos> [chuckles, sniffles] You did.
He's agreed to let me co-write a book about him.<eos> Oh, I'm going to mention you two boys in the acknowledgments.<eos> Um, not now, Stanton, but thanks.<eos> Besides a paid witness with an obvious financial interest to Mr. Infeld, do you have anyone who can testify to the devious, reckless sexual encounters they've had with Stanton Infeld over the years?<eos> We do not.
That sucks.<eos> We have lost our way.<eos> Has a fire? Then we can see, where the flame moves.<eos> I 's lighter.<eos> Did you also 's joint?
- Number 12, sperm bank.<eos> - See number 11.<eos> Some sheik named "Fahid Ahmed Habib" or whatever, is getting a brand-new set of lungs. - Government flew him in.<eos> - We get the newspaper?<eos> Sheila does.
Maybe.<eos> Come by.<eos> Find out.<eos> He doesn't deserve to go out like this.<eos> No one does.
- Fuck.<eos> - I want to watch Steve Harvey!<eos> - That doesn't matter.<eos> - Yes, it does.<eos> No, it doesn't.
Wow.<eos> Anyway, my point is, I've never met a more upstanding, conscientious, and loquacious young woman.<eos> So, you think I'll be okay? I do.<eos> I do.<eos> I really do.
So everyone's leaving?<eos> I wish I had known this before I served the good bacon.<eos> You did not serve the good bacon.<eos> Shh! Don't you have a tiny dress to buy?<eos> Yes, we do!
Okay, run, run.<eos> Come on. Come on!<eos> She looks so happy.<eos> She does.<eos> Oh, she really does.
Hey.<eos> That was the coffee shop.<eos> A barista saw the whole thing go down. A woman walked up to Justin outside and started yelling at him.<eos> - You get a description?<eos> - I did better than that.
Last time, all it took was me believing in magic and kissing Henry.<eos> Since I've been back, I've done both and nothing.<eos> It's the belief.<eos> Henry... he needs to believe.<eos> In this new life... he doesn't.
Come on, Hildy, DNA.<eos> You know what, mark?<eos> I actually believe you.<eos> You do?<eos> Yeah, I do.
It's like a diamond...<eos> So many facets, beautiful from so many angles.<eos> The way the bay lurks at the end of every street.<eos> I was hoping you'd like this spot.<eos> I do.
I'm never gonna be a cop, Mom. Just so you know.<eos> What do you say, D-Hop?<eos> The lawyer said I shouldn't talk to nobody without him.<eos> Okay, well, what if, uh...<eos> What if I do all the talking and you do the listening?
An actor?<eos> A dancer?<eos> If you really want to be a star, you came to the right place.<eos> You want to ask me some questions?<eos> Yes, sir, Mr. Kirch, we do.
Put plaid with plaid and plaid and plaid.<eos> I think plaid on plaid is a great thing.<eos> Monochromatic plaid.<eos> Did I not say this just the other day?<eos> Yes, you did.
But this is special pudding.<eos> Yes, made with a special ingredient.<eos> - Mm-hmm.<eos> Well, I don't want it.<eos> Of course you do.
- He kicked ya out, didn't he?<eos> Haskell?<eos> Did you tell Phil you didn't go through with it?<eos> No. I didn't have the balls.<eos> And now... Neither does he.
Wait a sec, I'm getting a text.<eos> It's from a guy named Mel.<eos> You slept with a Mel?<eos> Maybe you slept with a Mel.<eos> Maybe we both did.
So I gave you clean clothes, stuck you in a cab, and sent you on your merry way.<eos> That's it?<eos> That was my crazy night?<eos> I got the dry heaves outside of South pacific?<eos> Yeah, well, next time, do it outside Jersey boys.
Listen, I was wondering when we were gonna get some of the drivers.<eos> We need to start end-to-end testing as soon as possible.<eos> I'm working on the OS expansion. What?<eos> Who told you to work on that?<eos> Cameron did.
Debbie!<eos> - Any luck?<eos> - Not yet!<eos> Uh, yes, I'm looking for a Cabbage Patch Kid.<eos> You do?
- Later.<eos> What does this dream represent to you?<eos> It's Emmanuelle, obviously.<eos> I saw a real future for us.<eos> Everybody did.
No.<eos> I do make a dead sexy zombie.<eos> No, you don't, Shawn.<eos> You don't make a sexy zombie!<eos> You don't!
Maybe up the road.<eos> There's another site beyond the roundabout.<eos> Past the roundabout? Yeah.<eos> Have you no car with you?<eos> I do, yeah.
Have to go home.<eos> Did Paulie say anything to you?<eos> What d'ya mean?<eos> About a rat?<eos> After The Zoo he did but..
Will I see you later?<eos> I've a few things to do but I'll be back after.<eos> Thanks babe.<eos> What, do you not believe me?<eos> No, I do.
'Cause you're a father now, and you have responsibilities.<eos> I know.<eos> Shortly after your wedding, I had some of my miners kick your ass.<eos> You remember that and what I said?<eos> Yeah, I do.
Irisa?<eos> I can't believe I shot her.<eos> Ah, Tommy's got a hard head.<eos> You missed Irisa.<eos> No, I didn't.
Why?<eos> Why what? Why did she tell you that?<eos> I don't know.<eos> make me feel better, I guess.<eos> And do you?
Hey, I love you!<eos> I love you, too!<eos> Bonnie, what is going on?<eos> I thought we had something special.<eos> Yeah, Brad, we... we do.
I love you, too!<eos> Bonnie, what is going on?<eos> I thought we had something special.<eos> Yeah, Brad, we... we do.<eos> We did.
I'm working on it.<eos> Not as hard as you should be.<eos> I think you're a really good player, but you could be great.<eos> You really think so?<eos> Yeah, I do.
Hey, there's my legal eagle.<eos> How did it go?<eos> Does your dad still think you're a lawyer?<eos> Yep. (Laughs)<eos> Yep, he does.
Okay, you are telling me.<eos> Come on, hello.<eos> Look at that, yeah.<eos> This is fun. Thank you so much but Ms. Jensen and I have some important business to handle.<eos> No, we don't.
From the Book of Revelation.<eos> We're too late.<eos> I fear the prophecy was correct.<eos> I cannot see the sword because I do not know myself.<eos> No, you do.
I...<eos> I didn't even want to do it.<eos> It was Dave's dumb idea.<eos> Doesn't matter.<eos> Of course it does.
The creature is drawn to those who hide desire in their heart.<eos> Hey, I, no, I'm...<eos> I'm grateful, you know?<eos> She saved my life.<eos> As you did hers.
I know you're confused, but I can explain this, pal.<eos> This is on you.<eos> No.<eos> Aidan, no.<eos> Don't do this!
How?<eos> We're not sure.<eos> He was found lying on the beach early this morning.<eos> Does his mom and dad know?<eos> Yeah, they do.
I'm relying on you to catch them.<eos> I promise you, Beth.<eos> I promise.<eos> He did know, didn't he, that I love him?<eos> Of course he did.
- I wish I was still friends with Micah.<eos> He gets to take an extra bag because of his wheelchair.<eos> Okay, can you stop for a second?<eos> Why don't you want me to chaperone? I don't know.<eos> I just don't.
W-what if he doesn't come?<eos> Hey.<eos> Buddy, it's okay.<eos> Someone is coming.<eos> But what if they don't?
Ah.<eos> A friend. Someone who became a friend.<eos> So there's hope for me?<eos> I... I don't know why I trust you.<eos> But for some reason I do.
You're next.<eos> That's easy!<eos> - Yahtzee!<eos> Do you have any kings?<eos> Yes, I do.
I know they all think you can, but if you die, you are the life force of the clan.<eos> Without you...<eos> - I will not fail.<eos> - I wish I had your strength and conviction.<eos> -You do.
They're primal, alphas.<eos> I gave you my reason for not making a move these past few months.<eos> What, pray tell, is theirs?<eos> They don't have the stake.<eos> Well, then who the hell does?
I wouldn't do that, and I didn't hurt anybody.<eos> I know the difference between right and wrong.<eos> You know that, right?<eos> I don't know, Henry.<eos> But I do!
Are you ok?<eos> - I am.<eos> I wasn't sure this was what I wanted, After everything.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - But I do.
So, I trust that you will keep my office in the loop if there are any significant developments.<eos> Is that clear?<eos> Of course.<eos> Sir, I didn't... I didn't know you had a sister.<eos> Oh, well, now you do.
After you were told this, you met with Judge Kluger.<eos> To discuss his book at lunch.<eos> Did you tell anyone either in person, or on the phone?<eos> - No! - Did you text or e-mail?<eos> No, I didn't. I... I...
Wipe it.<eos> Show me.<eos> You bitch.<eos> You said you would keep me alive!<eos> No, I didn't.
Thank you, Sister.<eos> Goodnight.<eos> Don't forget to say your prayers.<eos> Oh, of course.<eos> I always do.
Sir.<eos> Eddie, I'm so embarrassed.<eos> I made a complete fool of myself.<eos> No-one minds.<eos> I do.
George, my boy, he can't talk.<eos> He was hit in the head.<eos> I don't think he sees me.<eos> Doesn't know I'm there.<eos> Of course he does.
The same house where you were arrested.<eos> Did you know Jaco Tillens before coming to France?<eos> No, and any nurse here could have treated him or his daughter.<eos> Yes, but any nurse didn't.<eos> You did.
Rebecca, I need to leave for a while.<eos> could we talk later?<eos> Mom, I have four paintings to finish, so, you know,<eos> I wish that I'd known you were coming by earlier.<eos> But I didn't, so...
Dress like one of the characters in the book and do a lame presentation like a million other kids.<eos> What do you want, Brick?<eos> Do you want to go the safe route, or do you want to be an innovator, a trailblazer, a rule breaker?<eos> !<eos> I do.
!<eos> No, uh, but if you don't want to --<eos> No. No, no, no, no, no.<eos> I do, I do, I do.<eos> I definitely, definitely do.
What did my face ever do to you?<eos> You told my sister you were gonna take her to prom, and then, like, you just cancel on her last minute?<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> She has like a million dates.<eos> No, she doesn't, Darrin.
He's doing his best to find out what happened to the donor information.<eos> I want you to know we both understand how important this is.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Did you have a chance to look over the speech I sent you?<eos> Yes, I did.
- Did you sign up for the lottery?<eos> - No.<eos> I was going to, but then... that scientist, Dr. Lennon, came on TV last night, and she said that things are gonna get better.<eos> So I figured I'd wait.<eos> And do it the right way.
That's what she does.<eos> She has a problem.<eos> I don't need to tell you what the stakes are here.<eos> That's right, Alan.<eos> You don't.
I don't need to tell you what the stakes are here.<eos> That's right, Alan.<eos> You don't.<eos> But if she did hear our conversation...<eos> She didn't.
So come on, where do you think you come?<eos> I really hope I haven't humiliated myself too much.<eos> No, you haven't humiliated yourself, because you went out there, which is brave enough, and you drove around in it, which is very marvellous and you looked determined.<eos> Like one of those schools where everyone's a winner.<eos> You did... 1... 49... 4.
- What's next?<eos> - Uh, next.<eos> Next... we drill.<eos> [drill whirs] Yes.<eos> April: How you doing, Dr. Shepherd?
I think it means "John."<eos> Crazy Ira and the Douche from 93.7 FM, the Groove.<eos> Leslie, do you believe that this new slogan will integrate Pawnee and Eagleton into one cohesive city?<eos> Wow, that's a very thoughtful question, Crazy Ira.<eos> Yes, yes, I do.
- Yes.<eos> You did do that, right?<eos> You didn't somehow get the email addresses for every person who voted for the "Stick up the butt" slogan and then write each of them a personalized heartfelt email telling them to do the right thing and vote for a real slogan?<eos> Are you crazy?<eos> What a crazy talk you just did with your funny words.
You in the toy business?<eos> Inventor.<eos> You know the Finger Faddle?<eos> Oh, God, my kids used to play that game for hours.<eos> Some still do.
Wow.<eos> Okay.<eos> That's exactly what Antoinette said was gonna happen.<eos> Yeah, fucking Antoinette.<eos> Of course she did. Yeah.
I'll do a matrix of their cell phone, e-mails, credit cards; see if their paths crossed anywhere.<eos> Where is DiNozzo?<eos> He was trying to hook up with his father.<eos> Gibbs said you have something for me.<eos> Yes, I do.
Would you take that hat off?<eos> When Bodeen was on his game, it was a great life.<eos> Until it all came crashing down around him.<eos> I wonder how he paid his rent.<eos> He didn't.
They're in love.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Does your mom know what she's in for?<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> - She does.
- And I don't care.<eos> - Oh, is that how he put it?<eos> Because I seem to remember it fairly differently.<eos> - Did he tell you I left him?<eos> - Yeah, he did.
- You go right ahead.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> I just wanted to make sure that you had all the numbers on the "sanctuary states."<eos> Oh-- oh, yes.<eos> Yes, I do. Yes.
Okay.<eos> Mm-hmm. Maybe you should tell my husband that. 'Cause he was... he was the one that was so into me doing this therapy thing, and really, he's the one that...<eos> that needs to be here. His mother... I mean, she's controlling, overbearing, manipulative...<eos> So you don't get along with her?<eos> No, I do not.
I think you're becoming president of the United States!<eos> - (ALL CHEERING)<eos> - Yeah, we rule.<eos> - What?<eos> - Or you do, in fact.
Has President Meyer spoken to the president of Iran?<eos> I'm not able to answer that.<eos> Otherwise I'd have to have you killed. (LAUGHS)<eos> MALE REPORTER: Does the president believe this is a moment for levity? Uh...<eos> No, she does not.
I'm not able to answer that.<eos> Otherwise I'd have to have you killed. (LAUGHS)<eos> MALE REPORTER: Does the president believe this is a moment for levity? Uh...<eos> No, she does not.<eos> Does not.
You know what?<eos> They should be called "Dans."<eos> Well, that was an awkward Cabinet meeting.<eos> Leanne Carr knows I definitely tried to fire her. She found some fucking energy now.<eos> How we doing with the office move, Sue?
What?<eos> We've gotta go back to DC. - Why?<eos> - You got the oath wrong, ma'am.<eos> You didn't say "preserve."<eos> - Yes, I did.
And I can help.<eos> I need payback.<eos> And how do we know this isn't a trick?<eos> How do we know you're not zombified right now?<eos> You don't.
So, why did you do it?<eos> To see.<eos> To see what?<eos> If it mattered.<eos> Well, it does.
It's three carats, baby.<eos> I want you to know I appreciate the talent.<eos> This is my girl, Bridget.<eos> Hi.<eos> How you doing, snowflake?
Oh, there are so many exciting areas:<eos> - Black holes, dark matter...<eos> Leonard was telling me about dark matter, but I didn't really understand it.<eos> Don't feel bad.<eos> Neither does he.
Hi, and welcome to the Sutter Farms family of products.<eos> From industrial cleaning solvents to our delicious baked goods, we're there for you.<eos> If you have a question or comment, press 1.<eos> If you have an idea for a new Sutter Farms product, press 2.<eos> As a matter of fact, I do.
In case you were wondering, I passed on J.P.'s offer.<eos> He made an offer?<eos> - Yeah, but it wasn't good for us.<eos> Yeah, we do have a partnership here, Allen.<eos> Yeah, yeah, we do.
Captain.<eos> Aren't you cute?<eos> You can mail me my wallet.<eos> We didn't know what happened to you, Bloom.<eos> Now you do.
All right, never mind on the hot-air balloon idea.<eos> I got a lot more where that came from.<eos> Hey, did you figure out what to do with Dawson's dad?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I did.
I think I'm really falling for him.<eos> Don't commit to anything until you've seen his penis.<eos> Trust me.<eos> Chloe, did you get that bottle of water I asked you for?<eos> Yeah, yeah, I did, actually.
He's got sort of a working-class touch, which is something that's valuable, and we should listen to it.<eos> I printed a copy of the speech from the "G" folder.<eos> Why does he have access to the "G" folder?<eos> I don't even have access to the "G" folder.<eos> Yes, you do, Mike.
I printed a copy of the speech from the "G" folder.<eos> Why does he have access to the "G" folder?<eos> I don't even have access to the "G" folder.<eos> Yes, you do, Mike.<eos> We all do.
- It's...<eos> - 5:02.<eos> MEREDITH: If the phone rings, everything changes.<eos> Suddenly, you're a superstar.<eos> If it doesn't...
I should hope so.<eos> I was there the day he got his diagnosis.<eos> And although small, there is a risk of superinfection by mixing his strain of the virus with yours.<eos> Knowing this, do you still wish to proceed?<eos> I do.
It's encrypted, NSA level.<eos> I know.<eos> And we have it and you don't. Mm-hmm.<eos> Does that amuse you?<eos> Yes, it does.
- No.<eos> - You texted you got the cash, right?<eos> Amber, Beth Ann's my best friend.<eos> It was easy for me to say "yes" to that text.<eos> - Why did you?
Tell Dr. Bailey to go ahead and start without me. I'll be there as soon as I can.<eos> They asked for you.<eos> I just need to hear it again.<eos> Tell me that you think this is the right idea.<eos> I do.
There are dog-sitters on every street corner just waiting to be called.<eos> Those are homeless people.<eos> There are teenagers in this neighborhood that would pay me to look after an adorable dog like Wendell.<eos> - We'll find somebody.<eos> - Yeah, and what if we don't?
- Oh, I get what's going on here. Yeah, you're tired and cranky because the scary man made you go for a run.<eos> Mommy would never do that. Oh, no she wouldn't.<eos> Oh, no she wouldn't.<eos> I think even the dog thinks that what you're doing is annoying.<eos> No, he doesn't.
Mommy would never do that. Oh, no she wouldn't.<eos> Oh, no she wouldn't.<eos> I think even the dog thinks that what you're doing is annoying.<eos> No, he doesn't.<eos> Oh, no he doesn't.
How late?<eos> I... you can make that shit for me another night.<eos> Another night?<eos> You like having me around, huh?<eos> Yeah, I do.
Okay.<eos> Thank you.<eos> What are the odds?<eos> My God, Tommy.<eos> - How you doing, Angie?
Thank you for doing this.<eos> I want you to like him.<eos> He makes me happy.<eos> You cooking, it says a lot.<eos> Angie, how you doing?
Ghost took back his loyalty, so now it's time for you to do the same.<eos> I want to change my life for you.<eos> I don't want to break up your marriage.<eos> You like having me around, huh?<eos> - I do.
Does this?<eos> I'm all yours now.<eos> And soon I'll be totally free.<eos> Told you I'd come through.<eos> You did, and you did.
The police? - What did they...<eos> - Nothing.<eos> A copper sniffed about, so I gave him a show.<eos> I got rid of the poison yesterday, and they got Ezra banged up for it.<eos> Do the police...
I'm sorry, Ms. Kaswell, but Mr. Hanson is right.<eos> I don't deny there is a harm here, but the defendants have not breached their duty to the children.<eos> If anything, Mr. and Mrs. Biltman fraudulently represented themselves to the production company.<eos> And the production company would have a claim against them.<eos> But, unfortunately, you do not.
I raised my son as a single father.<eos> It's not easy but there are rewards.<eos> Mr. Sadler, I, um... never mind.<eos> No, no, speak your mind.<eos> So few people do with me nowadays.
- The last one, I wore a condom.<eos> - Yeah, and you screwed it off.<eos> - I didn't screw it off.<eos> - You did screw it off.<eos> Your vagina, like, - Yes, you did.
- No.<eos> Don't.<eos> - Yes. Do.<eos> - Don't.<eos> Don't. - Yes.
What are you saying?<eos> I don't think you have a problem with my choice of gift.<eos> I think you have a problem with my choice of recipient.<eos> Do you think Scottie would even be here if it wasn't for me?<eos> No, I don't.
We were trying to find a cure.<eos> And we failed.<eos> You never cared about the money.<eos> The only money I cared about is the money to find the cure, and we don't have the resources.<eos> Pryzen does.
yet, you say the man who holds the secret is dead.<eos> are we certain we can trust her?<eos> i'm not so sure the servant is loyal.<eos> i used to think your stubbornness a virtue.<eos> and you don't any longer?
I'm sorry...<eos> Jess can go first if she wants to go first.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> I do, I do.<eos> - Of course you do.
Yeah, all right.<eos> He's interesting.<eos> George III.<eos> Depends... whether you find mental illness intriguing or not.<eos> I do.
Lots of times. And those times did you move into her place and dress up in her clothes?<eos> In case you didn't notice, I lost my day job.<eos> Onto brighter things.<eos> Do you like what I've done with the place?<eos> I do.
In case you didn't notice, I lost my day job.<eos> Onto brighter things.<eos> Do you like what I've done with the place?<eos> I do.<eos> I really do.
Hey, that's not who you are.<eos> I saw you watch those bomb victims die.<eos> You care. You can't help yourself.<eos> Don't tell me who I am. You do not know me.<eos> Of course I do.
Why?<eos> Because that's what you do.<eos> When you love someone, and you know they're the one, you make a commitment. Forever.<eos> You don't want to marry me.<eos> Yes, I do.
Let me help you understand.<eos> Your sister was having an affair with my wife.<eos> This is not the right moment.<eos> Which is why I forced Stahma into killing her.<eos> Please don't do this.
Leslie, don't cry.<eos> It's not that great.<eos> It doesn't even look like you.<eos> Or, actually, you know what?<eos> It kind of does.
No. Come on, you started it, what does that mean?<eos> Okay, fine.<eos> I sent you flowers.<eos> We spent the night in a hotel together, but you act like nothing ever happened and I don't like it.<eos> You don't.
I think I deserve more.<eos> I think I deserve an answer from you.<eos> Did that mean anything to you, or didn't it?<eos> Okay, you really want to know?<eos> Yeah, I do.
Just take a little bit of digging. We can put them away for a long time.<eos> Yeah, I still wished I could have done more, though.<eos> That's the old you talking. The one that used to take the law into his own hands.<eos> I like the new you better.<eos> Oh, you do, do you?
Okay, you want honesty?<eos> You may think that Vincent has changed, you may even believe that he actually has, but I used to be what he is, and I know sooner or later, he is going to hurt you...<eos> Gabe and you will be sorry! Gabe, please.<eos> The only thing I am sorry about is that things didn't work out between us, because I cared about you.<eos> I still do.
You could get on that.<eos> Just sign that, and you could be back on peds.<eos> Yeah, I'm not signing that.<eos> I have a twin?<eos> You did... in utero. Oh, gross.
- Can't plan a cry, Maura.<eos> - I'm not planning it.<eos> I'm just narrowing down the window of its arrival.<eos> And it occurred to me today that ... that we need to talk about our last wishes.<eos> - No, we don't.
Okay, you said he was going swimming?<eos> It's not always about race, pal.<eos> You seen many swimming pools in this neighborhood?<eos> Does Kenny know how to swim?<eos> - No, he doesn't.
Well, Mr Picker, what I mean is...<eos> If I die in this hotel room, it'll be like you decided to bury the rest of that dope right alongside me.<eos> Tell me about yourself, Mr Crowder.<eos> - She speaks.<eos> - I do.
And how do they end up here?<eos> Well, follow me.<eos> If we think, which we do, that Lester, on the day of the murder, got bullied by Hess and then met Malvo at the hospital.<eos> Right. And hired Malvo to kill Hess.<eos> Which he did.
He's got the eye of the tiger.<eos> Your word is... succedaneum.<eos> We got this.<eos> He knows this one.<eos> He does?
It was about making things right for a friend who died.<eos> He was really intense.<eos> I believed him.<eos> Did Logan tell you who this friend was?<eos> No, he didn't.
So... We cut a deal.<eos> What kind of a deal?<eos> Five million for the tape.<eos> What kind of kid has $5 million?<eos> DK does.
Brody!<eos> What's up, man?<eos> Does Mansfield know you're using his office?<eos> Does Mansfield know I'm using his office?<eos> No, he does not.
Sometimes you know right away.<eos> Oh, you have an eyelash.<eos> Sometimes it doesn't take more than a look.<eos> You're right.<eos> Sometimes it doesn't.
Sir.<eos> Potato chips?<eos> Why don't we have any potato chips in this house?<eos> You don't want potato chips.<eos> No, I do.
- And that was it, huh?<eos> Pretty classic case of "he said, the Russian guy said."<eos> Well, no doubt the prosecution over here is gonna make the suggestion that your mind starts playing tricks on you when you get older.<eos> But your 85-year-old mind wrote this, correct?<eos> Yes, I did.
I'll let you know when I have what you need.<eos> Oh, well, when will that be?<eos> 'Cause as I do my part to keep Pascal on his heels by besting him in business, you seem more interested in abandoned midtown buildings than the task at hand.<eos> Well, I have other interests that don't involve you.<eos> Not right now you don't.
And this is the place.<eos> This is where I was conceived?<eos> That's right.<eos> Thought nobody's catch you, didn't you?<eos> My mama did.
Sit down.<eos> I hear Ellie's out of the woods.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Two of you able to talk?<eos> Yeah, we did.
- Mom. - I keep a box in the bathroom downstairs here and I don't count.<eos> And if you need help getting the pill, I...<eos> Mom, Tank and I broke up.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> Gosh. How you doing?
And you might want to clear your browser history next time.<eos> - Tank.<eos> - Just so I know, was it the army guy who lied about cheating on you?<eos> Or was it Emmett?<eos> Who actually did.
Please, come, sit down.<eos> - You have a lovely home.<eos> - Not really, but thank you.<eos> So... you want to adopt a baby.<eos> Yes, we do.
Reginald, you did a great job making it so I couldn't get out of it, but you should have picked a better case to trap me in.<eos> Because we both know that my independent analyst will come up with anything that I want him to say.<eos> Did you hear what he just said?<eos> I sure did.<eos> And if you did, and I did... Maybe it did.
And James May, you shall cross it first.<eos> Why am I crossing it first?<eos> Because I just said, "James May, you shall cross it first".<eos> He did, he said that.<eos> I did, didn't I?
Just go, please.<eos> I'm getting you out of here.<eos> No.<eos> Oh, no.<eos> No, I don't...
I would have guessed thyme.<eos> Google "Rosemary."<eos> Should I click on "Rosemary Clooney" or "Rosemary's baby"?<eos> Ooh, I love babies.<eos> Ooh, babies and puppies! Do babies and puppies.
The cops can trace that shit.<eos> You're gonna get busted, Jill.<eos> Your dad already knows you took it.<eos> - Did you tell him I took it?<eos> But he does.
You changed your hair.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Do you like it?<eos> Kind of needed a change.<eos> Of course you did.
Um, well, I haven't seen it and I have a meeting.<eos> But...<eos> Ah, there he is.<eos> How did you know he'd be in here?<eos> I didn't.
No means no, asshat.<eos> I need to get back to work.<eos> I might still need your help, Shaw.<eos> Did you not hear anything I just said?<eos> Yeah, I did.
I... I will always need you.<eos> Good.<eos> I used it right.<eos> So, you read my book?<eos> Of course I did.
You're cute, you're flirty and... Started that like there were gonna be three things.<eos> I don't have any experience in sales.<eos> Unless you count the bikini car wash I did in high school. But you already made me take that off my résumé.<eos> This job is a lot like being a waitress, except instead of pushing the fish tacos 'cause they're about to go bad, you're just pushing our antidepressants before the FDA finds out they may cause rectal bleeding.<eos> They do?
Are you leaving?<eos> Uh, well, since my house is empty,<eos> I thought I would go there and catch up on work. Right.<eos> Um...<eos> Before you do...
Rayna, what are you doing here?<eos> Are you okay?<eos> I-I'm fine.<eos> They said you hit an I.E.D.<eos> No, the first Humvee in the convoy did.
Well, it's unlikely that he met anybody in prison on the Upper East Side.<eos> Wait a second.<eos> His last defense attorney. She lived near Sutton place.<eos> You found me.<eos> I did.
I have to rule it a cuppi.<eos> Circumstances undetermined? He shot himself.<eos> He forced her to play Russian Roulette.<eos> We heard it over her radio. You did.<eos> I didn't.
Yeah, family place, I'm afraid. Oh, okay...<eos> Two ginger ales then. And I'll... I'm gonna use the bathroom.<eos> Free with the meal. Right.<eos> That's the...<eos> Hey, how you doing? Oh, hi.
She talked about a place called Tilling, where she had a Queen Anne house.<eos> Why, what about her?<eos> I need to escape Riseholme, Georgie, and her house will be my retreat.<eos> Elizabeth!<eos> Sweet Evie, how-de-do?
Well, I'm sorry - there's nothing "po" about that.<eos> Yes, and isn't it unfortunate, because I hope you haven't forgotten that you promised to come in that very night -<eos> Thursday, isn't it?<eos> - and play piquet with me?<eos> No, I didn't.
Because of a heroin overdose, a massive heroin overdose.<eos> I know that he was found with a needle in his arm. I know it all.<eos> Well, good for you.<eos> It must be nice, knowing it all.<eos> I myself do not.
He received a package at this table today.<eos> I better not have been the subject of this meeting.<eos> Course you were.<eos> Doesn't matter.<eos> It does...
Yet you and that foul bitch mistrusted me.<eos> And much worse for you, you underestimated me.<eos> But killing the Samhain, do you have any idea what you've done?<eos> The question is not whether I understand what I have done, but whether you understand what you must now do.<eos> I do.
It's gonna be very good for your immune system in New York.<eos> [Sighs] You think there's any way he'll come to the concert tonight?<eos> I don't think so, Will.<eos> Now, listen, I know you see me as an easygoing, super-chill, - free-spirited woman.<eos> - I do not.
Deb!<eos> We're never going to see the Weavers again, are we?<eos> With the time change, they'll be dead by the time we back to Zabvron.<eos> I don't want to go, husband.<eos> I don't, either.
She wasn't always the confused woman you knew.<eos> Do you ever see her?<eos> - Like in a dream?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I did... yesterday.
Smile for mommy. Can you smile for mom?<eos> Now, you be a good boy for Rose while mommy's at work today, okay?<eos> I love you.<eos> I do.<eos> I do. Yes, I do.
I decided to give the baby up for adoption.<eos> - I'm kind of liking these people.<eos> - Jeff and Suzanne Taylor.<eos> Bonnie: So... you want to adopt a baby?<eos> - Yes, we do.
And there's nothing to be ashamed of.<eos> I can't go to prom 'cause I can't stop farting.<eos> That's what that is.<eos> All right, well, we can fix this.<eos> - How we doing in here?
Do I know you?<eos> I was hoping.<eos> Who am I?<eos> I don't know why I trust you?<eos> For some reason I do.
These damn things won't let me shut 'em down.<eos> - It's even messing with our phones.<eos> - Got every available I.T. helping Ms. Sciuto, and not one of them knows what the hell it is.<eos> We know one I.T. who does.<eos> Or did.
Look, I know what you're doing.<eos> You can't make up your mind, so you want me to make it up for you.<eos> But I don't want someone who's with me for the money.<eos> I want someone who's with me 'cause they want to kick some ass. - And if you want to take this job right now, I will negotiate in good faith.<eos> But you don't.
Maybe.<eos> What was the something else?<eos> Mike got a job offer.<eos> And you don't want him to do it.<eos> No, I don't.
Something has to be done here.<eos> Forensics found nothing at the ravine, nothing at the church.<eos> So even with your confession, you may just walk.<eos> - I don't care.<eos> - Oh, yes, you do.
He was trying to be... apologetic.<eos> Is it okay if we don't talk about him?<eos> I think at this point we both know who he is.<eos> Yeah.<eos> We do.
I mean... (Laughs) it took months to figure out how to work my way into being his roommate.<eos> To kill him.<eos> - You wanted to kill him for revenge. - No.<eos> - Understand... that's not what I said.<eos> - Yes, you did.
No, there's... no, I just wanted a fresh start.<eos> Like I told Danny, like I told everybody.<eos> That night in the woods, you saw... everything.<eos> Why didn't you tell us?<eos> I didn't...
There's a complication with the hard drive.<eos> I don't like complications.<eos> This one involves Skye.<eos> We had three teams try to hack it, but she programmed it to erase all data if anyone other than her attempts to access it.<eos> Of course she did.
Didn't we jettison that to the sun?<eos> Yeah, but Fitz has the specs on it.<eos> - On the hard drive.<eos> You need me to decrypt the hard drive.<eos> The team does.
He's never gonna forgive me...<eos> Ever. Not that I deserve to be forgiven, but...<eos> Well, now, come on, now.<eos> Everybody deserves to be forgiven.<eos> Not Jeff. Jeff doesn't. But everybody else does.
- It meant nothing?<eos> - Nothing.<eos> That almost makes it worse.<eos> Does it ever mean anything to you?<eos> Yes! Yes, it does with you.
Did I miss my date?<eos> How did this happen?<eos> Well, a couple years ago, I went through a survivalist phase and I bought a manual and built a booby trap.<eos> No, how did you wind up in it?<eos> Same way you did.
It's stress.<eos> You're upset because Wade is leaving.<eos> No, I'm not.<eos> Yes, you are, because you love him.<eos> No, I don't!
And then you had to watch him date your cousin... which proved that he had changed and he had grown up, and it killed you.<eos> Because... guess why. You...<eos> love him, Zoe.<eos> No... I... don't.<eos> - Yes, you do.
Because... guess why. You...<eos> love him, Zoe.<eos> No... I... don't.<eos> - Yes, you do.<eos> - I do not!
Tell them I was British intelligence.<eos> He also made it very clear that you two would be caught in the crossfire.<eos> We can take care of ourselves, you know that.<eos> You don't know these men, Sherlock.<eos> Not like I do.
- Did you do something to him?<eos> - But he liked it.<eos> He doesn't know what you are.<eos> I do.<eos> I do!
State of Hawaii became the proud owner of that when you threw me in here.<eos> Well, that's because your problem was trying to diversify.<eos> You should've just stuck with selling surfboards instead of going to the guns.<eos> Warden says you got something for us.<eos> I do.
There is something wrong with the way that I am built.<eos> I-I can't, uh...<eos> I can't just enjoy happiness like regular people, you know?<eos> You don't think you're being a little hard on yourself?<eos> No, I don't.
Oh, Ben, the things you don't know about me could fill an adult bookstore.<eos> I can't believe I'm gonna ask you this, but... will you be my wingmom?<eos> Wait.<eos> For the first time in history, a son actually wants his mother's opinion on who to go out with?<eos> Yeah, I do.
That wasn't just any bimbo!<eos> That's the bimbo I told him to go out with to make you jealous!<eos> Wait, why would he want to make her jealous?<eos> - Because he likes her!<eos> - He does?
Yeah, what else?<eos> - And sweet.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> - Did I say sweet?<eos> - Yeah, you did.
Really?<eos> You couldn't have told me you changed your mind before I got on the subway like this?<eos> I realized I had to do it for Emma.<eos> Do you know how long it takes to explain to a transit cop why you've got a rubber chicken in your pants?<eos> Actually... I do.
High-level government officials, including Senator Ross Garrison, were named in the report.<eos> Senator!<eos> Senator!<eos> Does this massive surveillance system exist, Senator?<eos> It does not.
Take him with you, tituba.<eos> One's too few, and three's too many.<eos> Your eyes... So filled with want.<eos> The hard part's not getting what you want, child. The hard part's knowing what you want.<eos> But I do.
Mr. Bray, we're scientists.<eos> Hopefully, we're not ruled by hysteria, fueled by ignorance.<eos> You're fighting for your life.<eos> Yeah, but while I'm here, I want you to think that I'm living it well.<eos> I do.
They said, four months ago, you sold pot to some of your customers, and it didn't get them high.<eos> Because her plants were truly medicinal.<eos> That's why you didn't go back for the rest of her grow.<eos> You have no proof of this.<eos> Yes, we do.
Buy some hot dogs<eos> Sure?<eos> Even the cook realized it was a bad copy.<eos> - I don't have that Berni.<eos> - Yes, you do.
I don't want to have to fire you for being late.<eos> I'll appeal and tell them why.<eos> Mm-mm, up, up... (groans)<eos> (groans) Not sure I told you... my parents are coming to town.<eos> No, you didn't.
I want to be with you.<eos> Look at me.<eos> I want to be with you.<eos> I don't believe you.<eos> Yes, you do.
Jones has and he agreed to help.<eos> I understand-- the CIA has left a bad taste in your mouth.<eos> Trent Kort-flavored, right?<eos> How do you know Trent Kort?<eos> Don't.
Yes, it is.<eos> I do not have a housing crisis.<eos> Not that she has a housing crisis.<eos> Then why does she need the funds?<eos> She doesn't.
I goofed around a lot, especially with Teri in the office.<eos> Truth be told, I sometimes put my own needs in front of Jane's and that was wrong.<eos> I'm sure she forgives you.<eos> I'm also the one who told Jane that you'd think she was crazy if she claimed to be Deb and that if she ever hoped to get you back, you'd have to fall in love with her as Jane.<eos> And I did.
Cheers.<eos> Ms. Bingum, I rushed right over.<eos> What's going on?<eos> I spoke with your son's best friend, and he said that Dean was taking a supplement called Power Blast.<eos> He didn't do drugs.
But the truth is, it's really about so much more than that.<eos> It's about the way we choose to live our lives.<eos> It's about limitations and possibilities.<eos> Now, do I personally believe in Sasquatch?<eos> No, I don't.
She's green.<eos> I don't think we should just put her in with random skank.<eos> You said Zen Dolls, right? That's right.<eos> I know somebody who works there.<eos> Or did.
We are blowing out Madison's candles.<eos> No.<eos> Listen, I don't care that you're her father.<eos> Madison doesn't want to talk to you.<eos> Because she doesn't.
I-I-9-9-R-C.<eos> There is no caller by that handle at this location.<eos> Over.<eos> Mr. Turner, we need to talk.<eos> No, we don't.
Melissa.<eos> This is Rogan, Shaina, and Xeni.<eos> My brother Geoff is in your infirmary.<eos> I'm told you have diesel to trade.<eos> Well, yes, yes, we do,
It is helping.<eos> I feel so free.<eos> Do you know what it's like to have sex with a woman who never wants to see you again?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, I do.
You hardly wanna get married looking like a melted candle.<eos> Like a what?<eos> Oh, god.<eos> So, do ye no remember anything of your own wedding?<eos> - As a matter of fact, I do.
Well, I brought you lunch, but it looks like you already had dessert.<eos> That was nice.<eos> Are you gonna put that in the showcase?<eos> June doesn't want you in the showcase.<eos> And she never did.
Hello, malachi.<eos> It appears that trouble has found me.<eos> It looks like you could use a friend.<eos> I have friends.<eos> Oh, not in here, you don't.
Please. Don't.<eos> Please stop.<eos> Please. Please.<eos> Please stop.<eos> Don't.
Because you were with them when they found the body.<eos> Well, I was with some of them.<eos> What are you...<eos> You don't even live here.<eos> Well, sure I do.
She caught me sneaking out of Victoria's room last night. In my home?<eos> You did it in my home?<eos> Not all of it. Some of it was in my car. Aah!<eos> I don't want to know!<eos> I kind of do.
I don't... I've never done this before, okay?<eos> I've never lived with someone before.<eos> I'm not used to accepting stupid... wooden bars and stuff like that.<eos> You always say that things will work out.<eos> But what if they don't?
Well, thank you.<eos> That info is very helpful.<eos> You know, I had to counsel Lucas' mother.<eos> She felt terrible guilt about his death, and she said his wounds ran very deep.<eos> Indeed, they did.
I'm married to a Brewster.<eos> Moses?<eos> Moses, do you still have it? - What? - You know what I mean.<eos> The petition.<eos> You do, don't you?
And Jordan studies dance.<eos> Wow, you can kick that high.<eos> Did you see that?<eos> What that giant step back for feminism?<eos> Yes, I did.
I laid all the groundwork for the Ghost Killer case.<eos> I know, but you know... you know how you and Cam got into it, last time, on this one.<eos> What about you?<eos> Do you think that I'm the best person to investigate this case?<eos> Of course I do.
You are not to touch the rema...<eos> The third finger on the right hand has an avulsion fracture on the superior aspect of the distal phalanx.<eos> The fingernail has been ripped off, just like every other Ghost Killer victim.<eos> Did you not see this?<eos> Yes, I did.
If he'd just given me that chance, trusted me, maybe he'd still be alive.<eos> I found footage of the fight that Brian got into outside Madame's Apple.<eos> I thought the club didn't have any security cameras.<eos> They don't.<eos> But the convenience store behind the club does.
Would you like some champagne?<eos> 'Dear Lord, I'm such a fool, I'm such a fool.<eos> 'What have I done?<eos> 'Did Nigel see Ellie and me?<eos> 'He did, didn't he?
That's completely not true. Really?<eos> Really?<eos> Em, how could you think that?<eos> I don't.<eos> I don't, Dad, please.
Of course, if you ask your husband, Both of us are deranged. Ha.<eos> I can't even imagine.<eos> Look, you're so vulnerable now.<eos> Anyone who seems to have answers--<eos> Yeah, but no one does.
Henry!<eos> It's more than you deserve.<eos> Are you sure you want to be playing this game?<eos> If you overplay it, if he loses patience with your displays, you won't like how it ends.<eos> The two dead girls before you didn't.
Captain america: We've been running scans for trace signatures Of the tesseract, but modok has<eos> Not sure what our next move is.<eos> Without you or sam, we're flying blind.<eos> Thirty miles due west of winslow, arizona.<eos> How did...
I wanted to leave alexander nevelsky in the past.<eos> It was an immoral life.<eos> That's why I fled.<eos> I knew when I met you That my life would be saved.<eos> And you did.
But you have yourself a good day...<eos> Maryellen.<eos> How do you know my name?<eos> Well, you told us.<eos> No, I didn't.
Well, you're welcome, by the way.<eos> (Gasps) So long, Swedish fish.<eos> I think I will miss you most of all.<eos> No.<eos> - Hey, how you doing?
What's goin' on?<eos> (whispering): This woman says she's my mother.<eos> No, no, no, I'm still here.<eos> I thought his mother passed away when he was little.<eos> So did he.
Maybe.<eos> Maybe not. Then what am I gonna do?<eos> What if I can't manage on my own?<eos> You sure as hell don't want to take care of me.<eos> I don't.
All right, so I'm just gonna mark that as a "yes" for 627 Racine.<eos> What did you want to be a cop for anyway?<eos> You think people would respect you more?<eos> Well, let me let you in on a little secret.<eos> They don't.
Is that who hurt you? Aw, is that who hurt you?<eos> Your mommy hurt you?<eos> What happened?<eos> You don't know me.<eos> Oh, now I do.
- How the hell did it get there?<eos> - That's where I left it.<eos> - You took my car?<eos> - Don't accuse me like that.<eos> Yes, I did.
I'm sorry, it's finished!<eos> I'm...<eos> I hope you find what you need.<eos> I...<eos> I really do.
Always came in together.<eos> You wouldn't really notice them unless they spoke to you.<eos> One of them had a beard, or a goatee.<eos> The other one smiled a lot.<eos> He did all the talking.
Sister Monica Joan has arranged the figurines in what she calls "conversational groupings".<eos> What in the name of goodness is the Angel Gabriel going to say to the ass?<eos> Dr Turner telephoned from Astor Lodge.<eos> He says until the matron is officially replaced, we must have a qualified midwife in place round the clock.<eos> ~ Oh, he does, does he?
Is this some kind of joke?<eos> Played on us by the universe.<eos> Looks like her, huh?<eos> - That doesn't make any sense.<eos> - And the dome does?
Did you see Dante kill Ana Escobedo or not? !<eos> - Answer me!<eos> - No!<eos> Okay?<eos> I didn't!
Yes, those dirty Russians.<eos> They got me again this morning.<eos> I'll never forget you.<eos> I needed a little excitement in my life.<eos> Mm, don't we all?
I can't believe this.<eos> Why'd you get so drunk?<eos> You're lucky that Chief went easy on you, otherwise you'd have gone straight to prison.<eos> Why did you beat your child?<eos> Who did?
Don't take him from me again!<eos> Please, God, give him a second chance.<eos> Let's get him to the OR!<eos> I swear to God, Toph, I thought he was gone.<eos> We all did.
They haven't even started on the transmission station... but we have enough fuel if the rest of San Antonio doesn't show up.<eos> - We need Topher back.<eos> Where is TC?<eos> - He was in the OR.<eos> Heather, did...
- If you guys are game...<eos> We can't... Mags and I have to go talk to people.<eos> - Yeah. - All right, well, I wanna come, guys.<eos> Do you guys want me to come maybe?<eos> - We do not.
For the rest of my life, I'm gonna be wishing I could get in that DeLorean and go back in time just before it happened and then not do that.<eos> Okay, well, you would have to take the DeLorean back even further, because we haven't been happy for, like, a long time.<eos> Right, McFly?<eos> But you found me, so... Obviously, that means that you must have some feelings left for me.<eos> Yeah, of course I do.
Oh, yeah, right!<eos> Now I remember!<eos> I figured you would.<eos> Uh, you may also remember, we kind of had a moment.<eos> Yeah... we did, didn't we?
What business did you say you were in?<eos> I didn't, Reverend.
Well, we don't want your lot here anymore.<eos> The horses are ruining everything.<eos> Really? Ruining what, exactly?<eos> What business did you say you were in again, Mr Mottershead?<eos> I didn't, Reverend.
Like, I built Pied Piper and you can see it but I can't really describe to you what it is even though I kind of know where I'm going.<eos> You do realize we quit working on our own apps to work for you, right?<eos> Shouldn't you more than "Kind of know where you're going?"<eos> Because that's basically what the CEO does.<eos> I do.
Holy...<eos> What the fuck am I doing?<eos> I can't go like this to the meeting.<eos> Jared. I have no vision.<eos> Yes, you do.
- Yang. - Mm?<eos> I gave a patient a stem-cell transplant using deactivated h.I.V. as a viral vector in order to cure his scid.<eos> I did so against his parents' wishes.<eos> Did it work?<eos> Damn right, it did.
Or, as the prison print shop calls it, "certificate of copulation."<eos> - You are a hypocrite.<eos> - What? You are telling these people that they're ready to function in the outside world, but then you won't even hire one of them.<eos> If you don't believe in Jack, you don't believe in this program.<eos> Of course I do.
I really appreciate all the money you've given me every month.<eos> It means the world to me.<eos> - Well, you're welcome.<eos> - But... you're a cheapskate, Charlie.<eos> You just did it again!
Cruz, listen to me.<eos> Welch thinks you screwed up.<eos> Who cares?<eos> He doesn't know you.<eos> But everybody at 51 does.
So we should practice our first dance right now.<eos> Whoa, now?<eos> No, now wouldn't be a good idea.<eos> - We don't even have the music, sweetie.<eos> - Oh, well... Now we do.
- No cameras. No mics.<eos> - Did they hire you?<eos> The Watchers.<eos> Yeah, they did.<eos> They do.
- Did they hire you?<eos> The Watchers.<eos> Yeah, they did.<eos> They do.<eos> Yeah, they do.
I need a break from being the dead kid's sister.<eos> And it's like I'm buried under it, and I know that you can't understand that.<eos> We do understand.<eos> - Right?<eos> - Yes, yes, yes, we do.
Come on.<eos> Danny.<eos> Go home.<eos> But-- go to bed.<eos> Don't do anything.
I thought nothing was a surprise to you.<eos> Is that what you came here for, to make fun of me?<eos> What do you want?<eos> Prove to me you're for real.<eos> I did already.
There must be some part of you that's sick of having a secret.<eos> Keeping a secret like that's exhausting, weighs on your heart.<eos> Hey!<eos> Oh, at least you love me.<eos> Yes, you do.
I'm not wearing that either.<eos> Mr. Barber, you offered a deal, yes?<eos> Yes, we'll drop obstruct for a plea on vandalism.<eos> For which you have no case.<eos> - We do, actually.
Oh, shut up, Brian.<eos> We were here first.<eos> Yeah, Brian, go read in your own room!<eos> I don't have my own room.<eos> Yes, you do.
Guys, this is so not right.<eos> Babe, just... please, just talk to me.<eos> I thought we had a relationship built on trust! Okay, squeeze over.<eos> Just gotta get in here.<eos> We do.
Gay or straight?<eos> Straight.<eos> Wait. Why would you ask me that and not him?<eos> Don't we get one phone call?<eos> Yeah, we do.
Damn it.<eos> Keep looking.<eos> Did you know Catherine was with him?<eos> No.<eos> I didn't.
Who would she have written that to?<eos> What's up, Jason?<eos> I just saw what you delivered.<eos> Your dad asked my mother...<eos> Yeah, well, my mother didn't.
Okay, it's only a matter of time before she runs out of whistles and start tearing our balloons and say Aria killed Shana.<eos> - Okay, whistles? - Aria, stop.<eos> Okay.<eos> Mona does not know about Shana.<eos> Then who does? Who?
Congrats, chaperones!<eos> With your help, tonight is going to be... unforgettable.<eos> I didn't sign up for this.<eos> No, you didn't.<eos> None of you did.
Is that Nev?<eos> It might be.<eos> Nevison Gallagher?<eos> -Yes.<eos> -How you doing, Nevison Gallagher?
You sit with your child at the end of the day and you're exhausted and you don't even know what you did.<eos> And everything you do seems wrong.<eos> It's hard to accept that those are the definitions, but they are.<eos> I'm sorry you had nothing to live for.<eos> I did.
It doesn't work at all.<eos> I mean, if you're a god, why didn't you know the truth about my father?<eos> You didn't even know you were a god.<eos> Admit it, you have no idea where we're going.<eos> Yes, I do.
I'm so sorry you have to go through this.<eos> - I don't know what to do, Mom.<eos> - Oh, sweetheart.<eos> Shh, shh, no, no, no.<eos> Shh-shh. Oh, baby, nobody does.
I've seen 'em.<eos> Walking around with their guts in their arms like dirty washing.<eos> Hold that gun up and do it!<eos> Fucking do it!<eos> Do it!
Why didn't you tell me that in the first place?<eos> Because I knew how excited you were to go to Mexico.<eos> I don't think Mexico's in the cards anymore, not if you're seeing your mom.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Don't.
You were going to fleece me for all you could and then run from your crime.<eos> The story you told about being disenfranchised from your family, it all makes sense; they weren't your family at all.<eos> Did you murder him? No.<eos> No.<eos> I did not.
I was executed shortly after my surrender.<eos> Jack: This. (tapping)<eos> What is this nail polish?<eos> You never wore nail polish.<eos> But you do now. Amy:
Actually, I didn't.<eos> - Right. Because none of this is real, right, Gabe?<eos> Look, I'm not doing this story.<eos> I don't believe Vincent's a beast, or that they even exist.<eos> Well, they do.
Ilya!<eos> Ilya!<eos> Ilya!<eos> Ilya, stop it.<eos> You done?
Why are you meeting with an Espheni behind our backs?<eos> Because... He's a part of me.<eos> It's who I am.<eos> What do they really want?<eos> The same thing I do, the same thing we all do... peace.
There was a framed picture of that guy in Annabel's apartment.<eos> And look at the timecode.<eos> Ten minutes after Annabel left the elevator.<eos> - When does he get back on? - Well...<eos> - He doesn't. - Aha.
Damn you!<eos> You were our mother.<eos> There's people around here who never even met theirs.<eos> You understand... the pain of being rejected by your own mother?<eos> Of course you do.
I have an obligation to-to protect you, protect your career.<eos> You have a destiny, written in the stars, to be a star.<eos> You're gonna win an Oscar one day.<eos> Do you really think so?<eos> I do. I do.
Hey, answer me this.<eos> Who's gonna go for a big-dicked, three-titted woman like you?<eos> Doctor says it's just extra-large lady parts.<eos> All cosmetic.<eos> He gonna do a surgery, and poof,
Trust me, they'll drift off peacefully.<eos> It's like putting down a sad puppy who's been hit by a car.<eos> We're doing these girls a kindness.<eos> But I like puppies.<eos> Of course you do, you sweet, innocent boy.
- Hey, Yolanda!<eos> How are you on this perfect, beautiful, angel-like morning?<eos> Someone's either on a sugar high or a "got them some sugar" high.<eos> Well, I know I don't usually talk about my personal life at work because I didn't have one, but...<eos> I do now!
That's why they've been spying on me.<eos> That's why they've been watching me all day, every day!<eos> For months!<eos> And you think I don't know!<eos> Well, I bloody do!
I'm sorry if she's lonely.<eos> I'm sorry she wants a child, but she can't have ours, and that's flat!<eos> You're not being reasonable.<eos> Just now, I thought she'd taken her.<eos> I did, truly.
Cora.<eos> You said what you think, and you have every right to do so.<eos> Tell me, does Edith seem very distracted to you?<eos> I'm not sure I'd notice.<eos> Well, she does to me.
Withdrawn.<eos> Nothing further.<eos> Ms. Silmas, you mentioned integrity as if...<eos> Well, as if you had it.<eos> I do.
You do the math, junior.<eos> Ilona was your best friend, and you were supposed to take the trolley that day with her to the beach.<eos> Did you go?<eos> No.<eos> Uh, ilona did.
What do you mean?<eos> Well, there's the part of you that's here with me right now.<eos> And there's another part of you that just belongs to you.<eos> I don't think I have that part.<eos> Of course you do.
I'm gonna ask you one more time.<eos> What did Molly tell you this morning?<eos> You think she knew about this?<eos> Oh, I think it's possible you did, too. No.<eos> No, I didn't.
Oh, my God.<eos> Well, I guess we have to hang out because obviously the universe wants us to!<eos> - Yeah, maybe... - You should put a little... tour of Stockholm inside of me... for me.<eos> Today, if you have the time.<eos> I do, before my... my b... my major show.
Parsa gave up Hansur as his second in command during my interrogation.<eos> Hansur evaded our roundup, but today he showed his face.<eos> On behalf of the Brotherhood, he released a video claiming responsibility for the break.<eos> Thought you said he didn't have the funding to pull this off.<eos> They don't.
Well, she's missing and my friend wants to find her, see if she's okay.<eos> When did the Roundhouse become your personal investigation resource?<eos> The intelligence officer who monitors that database reports to the commissioner every time he sees a red flag.<eos> Like why is a vice cop looking for investigative information on a homicide that's none of his business?<eos> Nothing to do with his caseload.
You'll find a connection whether one exists or not.<eos> Isn't that how it works?<eos> Next you'll be telling me I walked out of here and did it.<eos> ~ You know who did it, though, don't you?<eos> ~ Course I do.
They were all being held against their will, working for Tino.<eos> Okay, as for now, we got the mom on running an unregistered day-care center.<eos> Any chance Tino's girls testify?<eos> The lives they've lived, they think Tino is looking out for them.<eos> - Ellie doesn't.
Actually, I'm not sure about having children 'all around us'.<eos> How many are you planning on, Mr Bates?<eos> You nearly missed me.<eos> You never told me you were going.<eos> Who did?
Or the better off you'll be?<eos> I changed my mind.<eos> Play some goddamn music.<eos> No, I'd rather talk.<eos> We hardly do any of that.
Why do we say such stupid things to each other?<eos> Because you forget to think.<eos> But it doesn't matter.<eos> And your mum knows that you didn't mean it.<eos> She does?
Because you forget to think.<eos> But it doesn't matter.<eos> And your mum knows that you didn't mean it.<eos> She does?<eos> - Yes, she does.
But it doesn't matter.<eos> And your mum knows that you didn't mean it.<eos> She does?<eos> - Yes, she does.<eos> Yes, she does.
Ooh, you don't want to go and live there.<eos> They never bathe.<eos> That's not true.<eos> I heard they don't have showers in their houses.<eos> Of course they do.
Okay, anyone else need a drink? No, just me?<eos> All right.<eos> I'm sorry. Do I have "hate me" written on my forehead?<eos> She doesn't hate you.<eos> And if she does, so what?
Her one incredible godmother.<eos> That's me.<eos> Her two one-of-a-kind grandparents.<eos> - Oh, we love you.<eos> - Yes, we do.
You are one spirited little lesbian.<eos> - Who said I'm a lesbian?<eos> - No one.<eos> Not... no, not me.<eos> Not anyone. No one did.
Nothing about me is normal.<eos> Why am I even here?<eos> Because I'm connected to some egg?<eos> And no one even knows where it is.<eos> Actually, I do.
It just sucks.<eos> Oh, it really, really sucks.<eos> You have no idea.<eos> And the worst part is, I'm not even supposed to do this.<eos> Do what?
Somebody always starts crying.<eos> You didn't start crying, did you?<eos> Nobody cried.<eos> But every time I looked at Jenna, she was staring at me with this super intense look. Like she really wanted me or something.<eos> Yeah, of course she did.
Where did what go?<eos> The golden arrow!<eos> Tuck!<eos> You took it?<eos> Of course we did.
You sound as if you don't approve.<eos> I approve. As long as you're not making... her unsettled.<eos> You don't know her name, do you?<eos> Sarah, please.<eos> Of course he does. Daisy.
Abraham, let's get out of here.<eos> I will not give up the ship.<eos> Hold up.<eos> - We gotta go.<eos> No, we don't.
I'm tryin'.<eos> When we were out by the car... what if I didn't show up?<eos> I still don't know.<eos> You don't have to.<eos> You don't.
There's a bridge.<eos> Some days, I don't know what the hell to think.<eos> Good thing we skipped breakfast.<eos> How did we get here?<eos> We just did.
Their alibi's cooked. Oh, yeah.<eos> And Donnie definitely got the guns.<eos> Mm-hmm. Agreed.<eos> But I don't think they killed for the property. - You don't think so?<eos> - I don't.
The judge has three girls.<eos> Henry doesn't have any family.<eos> That's bad.<eos> So you gotta spin some bullshit about how Henry's got ties to the community.<eos> He does.
But if an inmate makes the request himself... then I'm required to run their request up the flagpole.<eos> Feel-good drugs?<eos> Feel-less-bad drugs, maybe.<eos> You get what I'm saying?<eos> I do.
-and find out what's going on. OK.<eos> -What, so that's...<eos> -Yep.<eos> Did you go to the H-MIT briefing in Halifax this morning?<eos> I did, yes.
The thing is, Nevison...<eos> The thing is... I may be wrong...<eos> I may be wrong, but the thing is... ..I think I might know who these people are.<eos> -Did you see anything? -No. No.<eos> I-I didn't.
-Still, we knew that.<eos> -200.<eos> -Whatever.<eos> -I should've said three.<eos> Yeah, but you didn't.
Something we can agree upon.<eos> I know God loves you, Daniel.<eos> You said that before.<eos> Or was it Jesus who loved me?<eos> They both do.
Do I have no chemistry with women? No!<eos> All women burn with jealousy when they see me.<eos> In another words, I'm a charm full of jealousy. Femme fatale.<eos> If you're not drunk, then you should go see a shrink.<eos> I already did.
Isn't there anything I can help you with?<eos> It's all done.<eos> Not that.<eos> About your abilities not working.<eos> It...did work.
I think we're making some real progress.<eos> - Okay. Good.<eos> Hey, ladies, welcome to my intervention.<eos> - Hi, Todd.<eos> How you doing, Todd?
Beckett: Gary duffin.<eos> You're no stranger to rooms like this.<eos> But this time it's different.<eos> This time, your only option is to give me answers.<eos> And what if I don't?
The Ross Supremacy.<eos> Emily's still taking pictures, but as far as the party signage goes, a "Happy Memorial Day" will do.<eos> The house doesn't need a name, Nolan.<eos> Says the girl who doesn't know which one to use for herself.<eos> I do.
Hartley, Hunter, Idaho.<eos> - What's the word?<eos> - In his office.<eos> - Director requests an audience.<eos> - No, the man doesn't do requests.
Abracad-ouch.<eos> Well, it's great having Alex home, huh?<eos> So great.<eos> You don't think that she's the reason why we --<eos> No. No, I do not.
Two hours rehearsing with Rosa?<eos> Cam, what is going on with you?<eos> We just had the most romantic year ever, planning our ceremony, the wedding, the honeymoon, and I'm just worried if we let this go, we'll never get it back.<eos> Well, that doesn't all just end.<eos> It did once.
What? I signed up for this little adventure under the countenance of strong and decisive leadership, but now, lo and behold, that leader is now gone, and the man currently residing in his skin clearly has no fuckin' idea what is happening in there.<eos> When we did this last night... what did I say I wanted?<eos> You said it was time to end it.<eos> I don't want to hurt her.<eos> Oh, yes, you do.
Vietnam.<eos> Third marine division.<eos> I'll get your bags for you.<eos> Justine said you're looking for a place to stay.<eos> - She did?
I will cover whatever you wont!<eos> I don't know, but I would imagine a few more weeks in the hospital and some kind of physical therapy at home.<eos> Honey, the S.A.T. is today.<eos> That doesn't matter.<eos> Of course it does.
I made the team! Whoo!<eos> Yes!<eos> Oh, my goodness!<eos> - That's so exciting!<eos> - Of course you did. - Yes!
What's that I smell?<eos> Is that fear?<eos> Is that vengeance?<eos> Is that that special cologne I told you never to use of mine?<eos> I just did one spritz.
Yeah, well, I can see why you think he's perfect.<eos> Oh, please.<eos> I just want what's best for our son.<eos> Who wants to meet the tickle monster?<eos> I do!
- You're sure he's in here?<eos> Well, he promised me he would tell me if he went anywhere.<eos> I don't know where else he would be.<eos> - Dad.<eos> - Okay, we already did this.
That's not funny!<eos> I wanted to see if daddy fucking loved me.<eos> - Get out of here.<eos> - Do you fucking love me?<eos> - Yes, you do, you little bastard.
I'm showing girls how to put on makeup.<eos> Oh...<eos> See? "Makeup by Zo-Zo"?<eos> I don't use bronzer because I have good skin.<eos> But my third best friend, Michelle, doesn't.
Man, look.<eos> All black people don't know one another.<eos> Do you know Rupaul?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I... I do, actually.
- It's not fair!<eos> You know what? I'll give you the key and you can come down and watch yourself.<eos> Just don't use the stove again.<eos> I don't wanna go to Newark.<eos> - Nobody does.
I do.<eos> I think it's sexy.<eos> No, you don't.<eos> Yes, I do.<eos> I really, really do.
I need you to sign these papers.<eos> What are they?<eos> Loan papers for the new house.<eos> I don't want it anymore.<eos> Yes, you do.
I look like shit!<eos> You really don't.<eos> Come on. I don't want my fucking photo taken!<eos> All right?<eos> I just don't.
The first time I opened my in-box, I had six messages.<eos> I was convinced that they were encrypted communiqués from government agents.<eos> I freaked out and turned the damn thing off.<eos> I guess I never understood why computers scared you so much.<eos> Yeah, well... now you do.
I'm calling the cops.<eos> You have everything in the world!<eos> Can't you just find it in your heart?<eos> Yeah, I have an intruder on my property.<eos> Yes, I will.
- Okay, wait, wait, wait, wait.<eos> - Are you right-handed, or left-handed?<eos> - That won't come up.<eos> - Well, it could come up.<eos> - It won't!
Can we not go there right now?<eos> Tomorrow night is the weekly staff meeting.<eos> The entire Radley crew is held hostage in a room for an hour and told to smile more.<eos> Even if no one in the hotel sees her the security cameras will.<eos> No, they won't.
He came in the office, and Dockery's guy thought it was a robbery.<eos> Stuck a knife in him.<eos> Dockery took the body.<eos> What happens if somebody comes looking for him?<eos> They won't.
Well... we can manage it... together.<eos> You really should go.<eos> Wait.<eos> OK. What... what do you want from me?<eos> I'll... I'll... I'll...
Oswald, you and I will rule this city together.<eos> OSWALD: Yes.<eos> But first, I have to kill Ed Nygma.<eos> He has to die.<eos> MOONEY: Oh, he will.
And if future you never creates these time remnants, then Savitar himself is never born.<eos> Precisely.<eos> But I saw him. He didn't disappear.<eos> - Not yet.<eos> - But he will, Joe.
On the 9th, a train ticket to Naples and a photo of her... inside a bar in Naples, date stamped on the 9th.<eos> On the 10th, restaurant receipts in Naples, and on the 11th, a new inter-railing card, stamped and dated with her photo in Naples.<eos> I'm taking my wife home now.<eos> I love you very much.<eos> .. and I always will.
Yankee inspectors will never know.<eos> Green, that's a pretty good ruse.<eos> Guess signing that oath wasn't such a bad idea, after all.<eos> What's your father know of this?<eos> Not a word, and he won't.
- That I couldn't keep!<eos> Not after everything I lost.<eos> I was just as broken as Joe was!<eos> - I don't care.<eos> - You will!
Damon, don't.<eos> See you in hell, Cade.<eos> No, Damon.<eos> Yes.<eos> You will.
I keep telling myself they're fine.<eos> They've only been gone...<eos> 6 weeks, 2 days, and 10 hours.<eos> We'll find them, castiel.<eos> We will.
Before all this happened, I was a cut-rate political flack in an embarrassingly unprofessional relationship with my boss.<eos> I don't know why it's me. And I don't know why it's you. But I know that we are destined for something here.<eos> Something great.<eos> Well, I wish I had your faith.<eos> You will.
Danny Nasiri had a good life, a loving family.<eos> I don't believe a kid like that would self-radicalize.<eos> Why do people from Ferguson, Baltimore, and Milwaukee burn down their own neighborhoods?<eos> I honestly don't know.<eos> And you never will.
I'm sorry, I should have stuck up for you more.<eos> All those years.<eos> I've decided to apply to the War Office, to do my bit.<eos> They probably won't accept me but...<eos> Of course they will, Toby.
Oh, sorry.<eos> Just assumed. Wild nights, dinners in bed, you know, thought you were newlyweds.<eos> - We're kind of the opposite, actually.<eos> - Uh-huh. We don't even know each other's name.<eos> And we never will.
No, Mom!<eos> No!<eos> Sweetheart, it's all right.<eos> If you don't love Kevin yet, you will.<eos> We all will.
The Baudelaire children will be destroyed,<eos> - and their fortune will be mine.<eos> - Rats! You and your ridiculous comrades will be swept away.<eos> - We'll see about that.<eos> - Yes, we will.
- Oh, that's great.<eos> Oh, we're gonna be besties.<eos> Hi.<eos> Where's Josh?<eos> Uh, he'll probably here really soon.
They pollute our air, they make us sick, they promise us jobs that never come.<eos> I am done begging for scraps at my own table and I know that you are, too.<eos> The parade is our chance to show them who we are.<eos> How angry we are.<eos> And tomorrow... we will.
'Cause I know you.<eos> You don't run away.<eos> But you can't just pretend everything's fine.<eos> It was a weak moment, it won't happen again.<eos> It won't.
They have to be broken in other ways.<eos> But make no mistake... they have to be broken.<eos> Many inmates have tried to make a fool of me over the years.<eos> None have succeeded.<eos> And none ever will.
I am a Freemason, yes.<eos> This city.<eos> This does not exist, does it?<eos> No.<eos> But it will.
Previously on "Blindspot"...<eos> I got the chance to start over again.<eos> Now, you will too.
I'll call you later.<eos> Bye.<eos> Liar.<eos> I hope your friends back home appreciate the contraband.<eos> They will.
And the we found his body staged under a bridge in Tijuana.<eos> Clara, Simmons, see what you can find from the abduction site.<eos> Mae, you and Ryan come with me.<eos> No, I can't show my face out there.<eos> Then you won't.
- Monty, I...<eos> - It'll be light out soon.<eos> That bunker gives us a chance for a future.<eos> I hope you'll change your mind.<eos> I won't.
You can't operate without my authority. Ever.<eos> I feel I've earned your trust and respect.<eos> Now go home, get some rest and think about whether you agree with that.<eos> If you do, I'll see you in the morning.<eos> If not, I won't.
I care and I'm not going to apologize for that.<eos> - The boy's woke.<eos> Come find me later.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Yeah, I'll...
- She deserves to die.<eos> - No, don't do this!<eos> Do you remember our troubles the last time an outsider was killed up here?<eos> Do you want those troubles to come back?<eos> Because they will...
Right, so, no pressure at all.<eos> Hey, you've got this.<eos> Trust me, I've seen what you can do.<eos> That's right, we got this.<eos> Yeah, we'll... just...
You look wonderful.<eos> - Leonard!<eos> - Sorry.<eos> ..and forsaking all others, keep thee only unto him so long as you both shall live?<eos> I will.
I'm so happy it's you.<eos> You'll let her know?<eos> Know... know what?<eos> That Regina's okay.<eos> Yeah, yeah. Of course... course I will.
I...<eos> I guess I was a little aggressive about this thing with my boss.<eos> I may have said a little too much.<eos> It'll work out.<eos> Yeah, it will.
You're just gonna take the evidence and ride off into the sunset, and hope that Wyatt doesn't come looking for you?<eos> Yeah. Sounds good to me.<eos> Too bad, 'cause it's not gonna work.<eos> Oh, it's gonna work all right.<eos> No, it won't.
I never said I was.<eos> You're not getting any information on a child in the system, even if she was your sister.<eos> You killed him!<eos> - What if they come looking for us?<eos> - They won't.
Say it!<eos> - Just trying to help.<eos> - Get out.<eos> What if they come looking for us?<eos> They won't, okay?
The destruction of a Time Lord, however, is a particular honour.<eos> This technology is precisely calibrated.<eos> As you can see, it will stop both hearts, all three brain stems, and deliver a cellular shock wave that will permanently disable regenerative ability.<eos> I know how it works.<eos> You certainly will in a moment.
- Would you like a piece?<eos> - Oh, no, no thank you.<eos> Clearly, I hate gum.<eos> - I'll take some.<eos> - No, she won't!
"No, not that one... that one!"<eos> And all I hear the patients say is,<eos> "Ow! That's my tongue!"<eos> Okay, but, like, so, I find someone who's willing to hire me, then I show up on my first day, and... how will I know what I'm supposed to do?<eos> ! Oh, you won't.
If I'm being honest, what worries me is NCIS solving the case.<eos> I know how horrible that sounds, but this is what's given Laura the strength to keep fighting. Uh...<eos> I'm not ready for what happens once she gets that closure.<eos> It's selfish, but, uh, I was hoping for more time with her.<eos> Well... you will.
I know you are.<eos> But what happens when I'm not here for you anymore?<eos> Forgetting about your dad was bad enough.<eos> But what happens... when I forget who you are?<eos> You won't.
- Excuse me?<eos> Look, the committee is just gonna have to wait.<eos> In two weeks, it's gonna be over anyway, and you're gonna be on the wrong side of this thing.<eos> - Well, we'll see.<eos> - Yes, we will.
We're together again.<eos> - There is a cure that works. - It worked on you, at least.<eos> - I have to know what you did.<eos> - I'll tell you.<eos> - All of it. - You will, Vilma.
It's on me.<eos> I promise I'll get us tickets for next week.<eos> All right?<eos> I gotta go.<eos> I will.
How'd it go on your end?<eos> The night that Fred Kirby disappeared, nobody saw anything.<eos> So, a few people heard a loud bang around midnight. So, whatever happened here, maybe they finished it with a gun.<eos> Anybody find any slugs or casings?<eos> No, and they won't.
I fucking know better than any of you!<eos> - We're not saying you don't know, Al.<eos> - Then stop pointing the finger!<eos> I haven't forgotten her, okay.<eos> I never will.
- What? Eddie gave Zoe plain old tap water.<eos> But he thought it was the real thing, didn't he?<eos> Aren't you going to cop shit for nicking this?<eos> What if Flynn finds out you swapped it for water?<eos> - He won't.
Be ready.<eos> Don't you post that anywhere.<eos> Please. Jaz won't see it.<eos> She's not on anything.<eos> Well, someone will.
So you're just gonna let him die?<eos> I'm sorry, Doc.<eos> It's outta my control.<eos> I'm just gonna get one of the villagers to give us a ride.<eos> - No, you will not. - You...
- You're going to go back to Claire.<eos> You're going to leave Lola alone.<eos> And you're going to do it today.<eos> And if I don't?<eos> You will.
Uh, actually, sir.<eos> If anybody's to blame I...<eos> Sir, I lost my focus.<eos> It won't happen again.<eos> No, it won't.
Well, thank you.<eos> We will. Good, that's great.<eos> I'll see you up there. Good.<eos> Well, you say we'll be there and on time.<eos> Sweet. I will. -Yeah.
Just the right amount really.<eos> No need to look back. Just keep flying.<eos> FASTER!<eos> - I'll take that!<eos> - No, you won't!
Put it down!<eos> I'll fucking kill her! I swear to God.<eos> No, I'm just kidding.<eos> Put the gun down.<eos> No, but seriously, I will.
Maui!<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Finding you a better way in!<eos> - We won't make it!<eos> - Yes, we will!
So these men will probably try to sell him to someone else.<eos> And then there will be some talking, you know.<eos> Oh, my God, Fahim.<eos> They're gonna kill him.<eos> No, they will not, Kim, inshallah.
Look ridiculous.<eos> Look like Rod Steiger.<eos> No.<eos> Yes, I will.<eos> No, you won't.
A simple exchange of information.<eos> Julie Mao was one of ours.<eos> I want to find out what happened to her just as much as you do.<eos> You think a man like Filat Kothari deserves to walk free?<eos> Because he will.
No.<eos> I've always wanted to go to Paris, more than anywhere in the world.<eos> I promise I will take you to Paris for our honeymoon.<eos> Now... will you marry me?<eos> I will.
I've always wanted to go to Paris, more than anywhere in the world.<eos> I promise I will take you to Paris for our honeymoon.<eos> Now... will you marry me?<eos> I will.<eos> I will, Ali.
How's your mother's jaw?<eos> Better.<eos> And your father?<eos> No one's seen him.<eos> And no one will.
Never.<eos> You in the church, if you have an Englishwoman in there, send her out now!<eos> Give up our hostage?<eos> Not likely.<eos> We'll rather...
I won't do it now.<eos> In fact, I think I'd better hide it.<eos> I don't want them finding this at the embassy.<eos> Don't worry about it.<eos> They won't.
It's time to go to bed, you've got school tomorrow.<eos> I'm not going back to that shitty school.<eos> What was that ?<eos> He'll be back.<eos> No, he won't.
Unleash the hounds, sweetie.<eos> That's how you talk in front of your daughter?<eos> Oh, I think we know how to be parents.<eos> She's a baby, "A." She doesn't retain any of that shit.<eos> Well, yes she will.
_ _<eos> I suspected the cause straight away, but I took a moment to recall the 18th century term for diabetes.<eos> I believe she has... Sugar sickness.<eos> And can you tell whether she will recover?<eos> She won't.
There was joy in her heart... before we shoved her back in that box.<eos> You haven't met her?<eos> Not yet.<eos> You'll see.<eos> You will. You really will.
A tracker device.<eos> Sounds like them.<eos> We need you to cut it out.<eos> I don't want to get involved.<eos> - But you will.
_<eos> You wait outside 'til lawyer gets here.<eos> Hey, you know our system, you know it can take forever to resolve legal problems.<eos> Oh, I have no legal problems.<eos> - You will.
Poltergeist.<eos> I... I thought I wasn't allowed to see it.<eos> I changed my mind.<eos> As long as you don't have nightmares for a week.<eos> No, I won't.
Well, as you can feel, or remember feeling, I've obviously put Rand into a great deal of pain.<eos> Now, he's not dead.<eos> Not yet.<eos> But that can change.<eos> And will.
I don't know, whatever the hell it is you do here.<eos> Lesbian lifestyle blog.<eos> We have a lesbian lifestyle blog?<eos> We do, and you're right.<eos> She won't.
I live with my mother.<eos> But this is gonna work, and when it does, I'll have much, much more.<eos> And I'll give you a million.<eos> - I don't want your money.<eos> - I really will.
Daphne, hey, hey, all right?<eos> Maddie made her choices, and that is not your responsibility.<eos> You did exactly what you should've done, all right?<eos> What if something bad happens?<eos> It won't.
You don't have to know how.<eos> Just have faith that you will.<eos> Well, we found our way back to each other, didn't we?<eos> Yes, we did.<eos> Sweetie, you will, too.
When did this happen, Drew?<eos> Chicago, right?<eos> October 17, 2014, at 6:31 p.m.<eos> I remember exactly.<eos> I always will.
Hannah.<eos> She may look like a woman... but she's just a child.<eos> Ignorance, Mr. Lockhart... is the great enemy of science.<eos> I wanna see Pembroke.<eos> And you will.
Walk through fire, battle demons, whatever it takes.<eos> I have to get my mom back.<eos> I can't... I won't lose her.<eos> You won't.<eos> We won't.
I love you all here.<eos> I do.<eos> And I'd have to kill for you.<eos> And I can't.<eos> I won't.
I know you do.<eos> But you are strong because of it.<eos> You are stronger than him, and you will get through it.<eos> Because things are changing there, and it can't last like this much longer.<eos> It won't.
It was my first big SCU event, and I was nervous and excited and distracted.<eos> Jenna, I'd like you to meet Peter and Kelly.<eos> This is the girlfriend we've been hearing so much about.<eos> Oh, don't believe all the hype.<eos> I won't.
Now you know how I feel every time you do something stupid.<eos> - Bombs in a tornado?<eos> - It worked, didn't it?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Maybe this will, too.
It doesn't mean he's gonna lose his own.<eos> You're right.<eos> But how's he gonna admire me?<eos> I don't have anything prehistoric to put my gum in.<eos> You will one day.
That is a metaphor, darling.<eos> The killing that comes your way, that ain't.<eos> Do you understand what you raise in me, Matthew?<eos> - If this absurd plot of yours fails...<eos> - It won't.
Come on, come on, come on!<eos> Lydia, don't look at them, okay?<eos> Don't try to scream.<eos> They'll take you, too. Just do not look at them.<eos> I won't.
Damn it, Fitz.<eos> Your friends are very persistent.<eos> They keep fighting us, forcing us to move, wasting valuable time.<eos> If it happens again, there'll be no absolution.<eos> It won't.
I never knew you were an orphan, too.<eos> Well... now you know.<eos> - Does Lenny know?<eos> - No.<eos> And he never will.
Are... are you there, Norman?<eos> - Yes, I'm here. - I'll...<eos> I'll bring it.<eos> And will, uh, the sheriff, your stepfather, be joining us as well?<eos> No... no, he will not.
- One batch, two batch.<eos> Penny and dime.<eos> They're gonna pay.<eos> Every single goddamn one of 'em.<eos> They will.
- And how you repay him, by plotting and scheming to betray him.<eos> But it ends here.<eos> Then your Master will never get the nuke.<eos> Oh, yes.<eos> He will.
We owe them.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Hey.<eos> Let's make her pay.<eos> We will.
We take Paris immediately.<eos> There's nothing to stop us.<eos> Will they love you, cousin?<eos> I hope so.<eos> Of course they will!
Unfortunately, your salary will be deferred, and your 20% investment is also frozen.<eos> Are you serious?<eos> I mean you do realize that I put my entire future in your hands.<eos> - If this doesn't work out...<eos> - It will.
There's not a woman alive, but she wants better than that.<eos> I will love her children as my own.<eos> I will be a mother to them all.<eos> Wilt thou love her, comfort her, honour and keep her, in sickness and in health, and forsaking all other, keep thee only unto her, so long as ye both shall live?<eos> I will.
You'll find all the knowledge and supplies that you'll need for your journey.<eos> Pull this off and you're homeward bound.<eos> Look, you said it was a day's hike.<eos> Why would we need all this shit?<eos> Maybe you won't.
That's why he's trying to kill her by blowing up your office.<eos> And setting you up to take the fall.<eos> You think you have enough proof to build a case against him?<eos> Maybe. But DHS isn't gonna believe anything I found.<eos> Yeah, but maybe he will.
You at Graydal?<eos> Ready and waiting.<eos> Okay, good.<eos> Hey, don't forget about the guard just in the tunnel entrance, okay?<eos> I won't.
We couldn't identify her - through collateral contacts.<eos> - (glass breaking)<eos> - Psychosis is pretty elaborate.<eos> - Very. Mood stabilizers and anti-psychotics had no effect.<eos> - This one will.
And I'm not going to get in trouble for violating hospital rules.<eos> God, what a baby.<eos> You are so ungrateful.<eos> Oh, go fuck yourself.<eos> I will.
It's plugged in by your side of the bed, where it always is.<eos> My brain's crying out for the morning coffee.<eos> Over this way, Mr Tarl.<eos> We'll find her, Ivy.<eos> We will.
You shouldn't go.<eos> But I can't stop you.<eos> They'll see you.<eos> No.<eos> They won't.
From a district with an empirically high applied demography value.<eos> I don't know what you're saying, but you keep doing that math stuff, Kent, no matter how much anyone makes fun of you, okay?<eos> Yes, ma'am.<eos> All right, listen. Karen has got to get those ballots admitted, right?<eos> She will or she won't.
- Can I help you with anything else?<eos> - Get me a date for tonight. Make that three dates.<eos> Who knows when I'll get another night off?<eos> I do.<eos> And you won't.
Oh, no. It worked out, 'cause, apparently, she was buying 'em for you.<eos> Who wants a cookie?<eos> Bonnie.<eos> Ooh, I'll have a cookie.<eos> No, I won't.
Suction on the shower caddy gave out.<eos> Well, we both had a good run.<eos> All right, thank God.<eos> Look, don't move, I'll get it.<eos> Oh, the hell you will.
(laughs) That's great.<eos> And look at you, sitting in Sheldon's spot.<eos> You know, I don't even get to sit there.<eos> Yeah.<eos> And you never will.
- You want to do it now?<eos> - I have to go.<eos> Again?<eos> What should I say if they wake up?<eos> They won't.
We don't have a minute to waste, Millicent.<eos> Let's go.<eos> All right, here we go.<eos> All right, if you want to, y-you go ahead.<eos> I'll just...
Hey, it's not complete failure.<eos> While we have not solved your scar situation yet, we have discovered an astonishing variety of tropical alcohols.<eos> I'm afraid he can't come to the phone right now.<eos> Nope.<eos> Nope, he never will.
Where's the sword?<eos> That was an amazing escape.<eos> I take back all my insults about your driving.<eos> She'll follow us.<eos> Of course she will.
Special bullet melts the brain nice and neat, but we wanted to see if you were one of us, you know, struggling in the dirt.<eos> Go on, now.<eos> Show us what you got, yankee.<eos> You're gonna like it.<eos> You'll... you'll...
Understands our minds.<eos> - I'm sorry I couldn't save him.<eos> - So am I.<eos> The cottage will still be here if you want to come back.<eos> We won't.
And if I can tell you one thing, they're all crazy.<eos> And you know, I- - I've never--<eos> I've never been with a, you know, close to a-- to a singer.<eos> I don't know why.<eos> Maybe you never will.
Yeah, I do.<eos> Romero still there?<eos> He moved out.<eos> You... you haven't told Norman about him yet.<eos> I will, honey.
I still do.<eos> But not in that way.<eos> No.<eos> So the good news is, you don't have to stay here because you're worried about me.<eos> I won't, then.
Oh, she did a test?<eos> She didn't need to.<eos> She should have a test.<eos> Put it this way, buddy I'm not exactly going to be having kids of my own.<eos> Well, buddy for a somewhat different reason, I probably won't, either.
I call it unforgivable.<eos> Does your daughter feel the same way?<eos> Children can't be used as weapons.<eos> So, Megan knew nothing about her father's infidelities.<eos> No, and she never will,
Want to be a tax lawyer now?<eos> Hadn't thought of that. That's a good idea.<eos> I never saw this kitchen finished.<eos> Neither did Daniel.<eos> Well, maybe he will one day.
I have never been ashamed of you, never.<eos> Or ashamed of yourself, then.<eos> It will not affect in any positive way what I am, or what I will be, and especially what I might have been.<eos> I can't abandon you, honey.<eos> I won't.
"I will."<eos> "I will have."<eos> "I would."<eos> "I would have."<eos> "I will not."
"I would."<eos> "I would have."<eos> "I will not."<eos> "I... will not have."<eos> "I won't."
What does the Mink get out of this?<eos> You used to slip some cash once.<eos> Do I look like I got cash on me?<eos> Will you talk to him then?<eos> - - Of course I will.
A message?<eos> Caraquet.<eos> I spelled it out in rocks.<eos> You think your friends are gonna be able to spot a town name that you wrote on a roof?<eos> Yeah, they will.
I'm here for the drive.<eos> I'm sure you have someone on board Who'll be able to confirm it's genuine.<eos> I gave you the device.<eos> I held up my end of the deal.<eos> And so will I.
Yeah, but I used your gun to shoot private Collins.<eos> Apparently, he walked in on your attempted illegal appropriation of WMD for your own personal gain.<eos> I got 6 men out there who'll testify to that.<eos> No one will ever believe your story.<eos> I will.
But you should know that I consider you an invaluable part of my team.<eos> Thank you, Governor.<eos> Really, I appreciate it.<eos> You know as well as I do that Ferguson will not stop.<eos> So, neither will we.
We gonna make it.<eos> How are you, Acke?<eos> - - The kids who beat me...<eos> What if they come back?<eos> - - They will not!
Sometimes you can be really far down the road, but you still have to follow your heart.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> I love you, Jane.<eos> I always have.<eos> And I always will.
He wanted to destroy you.<eos> I begged him not to.<eos> I asked him to send you to Hell instead.<eos> I did it because I love you, son.<eos> And I always will.
You may have Sergeant Taylor under the thumb, but sufficient fuss could see an investigation at levels well above his.<eos> And no proof to back it.<eos> But a highly circumstantial case.<eos> Has George seen this?<eos> He will, soon enough.
Is that a name?<eos> Stop them coming.<eos> Please, you must stop. Okay.<eos> I have child who is scared.<eos> I will.
Well, you aren't telling Dad.<eos> Absolutely not.<eos> Mmm... No.<eos> Mum, ab-so-lute-ly not.<eos> No, I won't, all right?
Abe.<eos> You're really doing this.<eos> Yes, I am.<eos> Has he said anything about Robert Oz?<eos> No. And I won't.
Ciro, if they go, we'll lose the best money-making spots.<eos> This fuck up can really cost us.<eos> She left the shop keys, she's not back and doesn't answer her phone.<eos> - You have to find her, Luciano.<eos> - We will, Prince.
This plan's fine.<eos> So who's going?<eos> Well, we've got three pods.<eos> - I'll take one.<eos> - No, you won't.
V did it.<eos> V?<eos> - Where did she go?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> And neither will you.
Come with me or I will kill more.<eos> Who else did you kill?<eos> Can we use it?<eos> No, it has to be Charles.<eos> And he won't.
Who's "they"?<eos> The mayor, the county commissioners.<eos> They're petitioning the governor to have me temporarily suspended.<eos> And then, uh, if I lose my case...<eos> - You won't.
My babies!<eos> We gonna get the boys back, I promise.<eos> Please, please just let us go.<eos> We will go back to California and no one will ever see us again.<eos> No, they won't, sweet meat.
You forget whose child it is you're carrying.<eos> He will have a mark on his head by virtue of who he is, and if you want what's best for him... you will come back to me.<eos> Threats won't make me love you again, Rumple.<eos> No.<eos> But necessity will.
Incredibly, their mirror jurors still think she panicked.<eos> All right, I got it.<eos> You think he has it?<eos> Not quite.<eos> But he will.
So you can't just run down the clock.<eos> Game's gonna start eventually.<eos> Well, then we should get started, because you've been asked to talk to me about last night, and I've been asked not to leave until you do.<eos> So, I'm... I'm just supposed to talk about my darkest secrets and my deepest fears, and all that?<eos> You will.
I thought it was just for show.<eos> My star player Dwight has been living with us ever since his father was transferred to an army base in Florida.<eos> He's doing his part for our country, so I thought I could do my part for our team.<eos> Who's to say who the bigger hero is.<eos> I will.
You're a loose end.<eos> Look, here's the deal, Doc... You either face this, or you pray to God that he lets you go back to being who you were.<eos> You think he'll do that?<eos> No. I don't.<eos> Good, because he won't, ever.
Let me remind you, dearie, that Rumplestiltskin takes children, not the other way 'round.<eos> There's nowhere to hide from me, dearie.<eos> Whatever you're doing, the Mother Superior won't let you get away with it.<eos> That wingless glowworm won't stop me.<eos> None of you will.
It's very important to me.<eos> Isabella...<eos> Isabella will apply to the Process.<eos> And she will pass.<eos> She will.
- Back pocket!<eos> Go get your stuff. Oh, my God.<eos> How long has he been doing that to you?<eos> What if they come looking for us?<eos> They won't, okay?
Now, there was a time... when I would have done almost anything,<eos> I would have locked myself away... to keep Rindy with me.<eos> But what use am I to her... to us, if I'm living against my own grain?<eos> So that's the deal.<eos> I won't...
Sarah?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, Sarah's good.<eos> Will you call her that for me?<eos> Yes, I will.
I'm supposed to be asleep.<eos> Your mom just started working.<eos> She'll be out there for hours.<eos> What if she comes back?<eos> She won't.
- Oh, fuck off.<eos> Sorry, Tyler.<eos> All right. - Bye.<eos> Call me later.<eos> - I will.
You don't.<eos> How do I know you won't copy and distribute that information?<eos> We just gonna have to trust each other, good buddy. Simple as that.<eos> - I'll need proof before I show up, anyway.<eos> - So will I.
Alright, easy.<eos> - I appreciate your concern, Superman!<eos> Fly away.<eos> Just breathe will you. Okay?<eos> Will you?
Me and Mom are going to church.<eos> Do you want to come with us?<eos> Ain't nothing for me there.<eos> If Mom will let me, will you take me to the lake later?<eos> Sure I will.
Because I killed her.<eos> She died at my hand.<eos> By this very blade.<eos> - (GASPS)<eos> - As you will, too.
He needs to go to the hospital.<eos> No hospitals.<eos> Are you crazy?<eos> He'll bleed to death.<eos> No, he won't.

The rest is on your shoulders.<eos> Thank you, Senator.<eos> Tell the president I'm doing this out of respect to you.<eos> Frank's still on my shit list till I beat him in the general.<eos> I will.
!<eos> No, we will never again see you in such pain.<eos> It will not die.<eos> ~ They have all died.<eos> ~ This one will not.
But, darling, I would be lying if I said there wasn't some concern.<eos> What is this concern? Who is concerning?<eos> Toni mentioned that she might be willing to go with Claire tomorrow t... to save your ankle after "Rubies."<eos> The public comes to see me.<eos> And they will in "Rubies."
With suits and gear, that's another 500?<eos> Ditch the life support, don't need it.<eos> And we'll get Mark to wear his EVA suit, for the whole trip.<eos> Wait a second. If he's in his EVA suit... how is he gonna operate the controls?<eos> Well, he won't.
That is wonderful.<eos> I want all departments on this.<eos> Of course.<eos> I do not want to lose this book.<eos> And you won't.
That makes sense.<eos> You see how they feel for one another. Why choose between them?<eos> They will not rule in any case.<eos> - Then who will, Ragnar Lothbrok?<eos> - You will.
Cheerie-bye.<eos> Goodbye, Uncle. Say hello to Scotland for me.<eos> You'll look after my gardens for me, won't you?<eos> Keep them safe, till I come back, eh?<eos> Yes. Yes, I will.
They're not your family, they don't care.<eos> But I do. And I want you to show them who you really are.<eos> You are the most powerful witch of all.<eos> I don't even have my powers yet.<eos> But you will.
Thou shalt always protect the company.<eos> I want Dan to survive this.<eos> Why wouldn't he survive this?<eos> If Dan feels like this is corporate positioning, he won't do it.<eos> He won't for me.
I want Dan to survive this.<eos> Why wouldn't he survive this?<eos> If Dan feels like this is corporate positioning, he won't do it.<eos> He won't for me.<eos> He will for you.
Previously on Power...<eos> Mrs. Stern, I have good reason to believe that Simon's been skimming from the clubs, hiding assets.<eos> There's proof, I can destroy him in this divorce.<eos> - You said you had documentation?<eos> - I will.
You have to tell her.<eos> I'm not ruining her childhood.<eos> I'm not telling her her whole life has been a lie.<eos> All right, I'll tell her.<eos> I will. - (phone beeps)
And shut the door on your way out.<eos> This is ridiculous.<eos> It's impossible.<eos> I will not leave until we part friends.<eos> I will not.
I do feel I-I owe you an apology.<eos> Your apology can wait.<eos> Virginia, I-I just didn't know how else to prove to you that Dan Logan is not what he seems.<eos> I do not want to talk about New York.<eos> Then we won't.
Guard: Eyes front, Harper.<eos> I told you, eyes front.<eos> My instincts are to keep my head on a swivel.<eos> Won't happen again.<eos> No, it won't.
Baby.<eos> Well, here's the good news.<eos> If you choose to stay, it'll be rent free.<eos> Will he agree to that?<eos> He will.
He takes care of me... like you used to.<eos> Okay, I just want you to be happy, so...<eos> Cyndee Sandy Pokorny, will you...<eos> Yes!<eos> Oh! Of course I will!
Don't go!<eos> Maybe it won't happen again.<eos> I was asleep and then the crashing was over there.<eos> I was only doing it so you'd believe me.<eos> And now you never will.
We're gonna see each other again?<eos> Are you kidding?<eos> You're gonna need a restraining order.<eos> No.<eos> No, I won't.
Come on.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Now, we'll... drag them both off into the woods.<eos> What if somebody finds them?<eos> Not up here, they won't.
Move along.<eos> Stop.<eos> It's mental.<eos> - May we know why we're here?<eos> - You will soon.
Maybe.<eos> But would you forgive me if something went wrong?<eos> Oh, yes.<eos> Of course.<eos> And it won't.
Jane's just changing now, so... you can go, I'll give her a ride home.<eos> Oh, I'll just wait to say good-bye.<eos> I'll tell her you said good-bye. You can go.<eos> It's okay. I'll wait.<eos> Of course you will.
Oh, I can't.<eos> I'm on a cleanse.<eos> Course you are.<eos> All right, we'll see you guys later.<eos> - Okay. - Yes, you will.
Um, why is Dave Kim here?<eos> We needed a crew, and he said he would work for free if he could stand close to you.<eos> Classic love story -- pop star falls for roadie.<eos> That's never happened in the history of music.<eos> Oh, it will.
One day at time. Isn't that what they say?<eos> So, I was just up at the hospital, and the nurse there told me you've been going up there every weekend.<eos> Yeah, she's just not responsive.<eos> I mean, her body's healing, but they just can't say when she's gonna regain consciousness.<eos> Or if she will.
I've tried it about a dozen times. It won't open.<eos> Maybe 13's the charm.<eos> Give it a try.<eos> Okay.<eos> I will, but...
I can see why Simon wanted to take it from you.<eos> Your information checked out.<eos> With proof I can destroy him in this divorce.<eos> - You said you had documentation?<eos> - I will.
- How was your day?<eos> - Not very good.<eos> I'm sure it's not as bad as you say.<eos> Mr Henderson will understand.<eos> No, he won't.
Your son's a hero.<eos> Your son is a traitor.<eos> - History will determine that.<eos> - No, sir.<eos> [Halpert] Court-Martial will.
Exactly... just like night.<eos> Wow!<eos> Amazing!<eos> I'll take them.<eos> Course you will.
Somewhere between pulp and literature.<eos> Excuse me, I'm just trying to get through, thank you.<eos> Much more attractive in person, don't you think?<eos> Will you tell Noah this is supposed to be my party?<eos> I will.
You can't last forever.<eos> And he'll die.<eos> - Everybody dies.<eos> - But the world will never know you existed.<eos> You will.
A pretty dress?<eos> Wouldst thou like to live deliciously?<eos> Yes.<eos> Wouldst thou like to see the world?<eos> What will you from me?
Not on the first visit.<eos> It's been so long since anyone's touched me like that. I know, but--<eos> What if this is the only erection I ever get?<eos> I may not have another chance.<eos> You will.
This is a monastery in the Himalayas.<eos> I stayed there years ago... when I was lost, troubled.<eos> And the monks helped me in ways that proved to be very...<eos> I don't need any help.<eos> But maybe I will later on.
Peruse the inventory, make your pick.<eos> As soon as Charlotte swoops in to seal the deal, we swoop in.<eos> Billy Soto looking fly.<eos> Shame you don't get to see me in action working my magic.<eos> Oh, but we will.
Maybe building the dam was a mistake.<eos> No, I don't think we were all meant to die.<eos> It was an accident, and out of it came a dam that saved the town and holds twice as much irrigation water, so...<eos> But what if it were to break again? It can't.<eos> It won't.
Special jobs in strange places.<eos> You'll be dead for everyone, including Blanca, your wife.<eos> You must be very powerful.<eos> These people love their executions. - It surprises me they'll cancel this one.<eos> - They won't.
It would be beautiful.<eos> We would all reach holiness!<eos> Penetration!<eos> Do you think anyone will come looking for me?<eos> No one will.
And, sorry, curfew is on. Halloween, canceled.<eos> Girls, it's okay!<eos> Look, we'll just hang out and play charades!<eos> No!<eos> No! We won't!
Like the chosen one thingy?<eos> Stop acting high!<eos> No, wait!<eos> Wanna go home with us?<eos> I won't.
Hatori?<eos> We never hanged out since then.<eos> I'm definitely sure... that a call from him will come for me tomorrow.<eos> First thing, tomorrow...<eos> A call from Rita will...
Like what?<eos> What happens in the diner stays in the diner.<eos> Are you kidding?<eos> The whole point of the dinner was we would have more to talk about.<eos> And we will, just not about last night.
What is your name, Señorita?<eos> Emily West... native New Orleans.<eos> You may go with Colonel Almonte to answer his questions, or you may remain here and answer mine.<eos> Well, I believe I'd like to get to know His Excellency better.<eos> And so you will.
I reckon he can wait here shackled till the firing squad come.<eos> We ain't gonna wait.<eos> He already run off when he weren't gonna be executed.<eos> No, no, no, no, gentlemen, gentlemen, please. I will wait for 'em.<eos> I will.
I would think it would be obvious.<eos> Typically each side must prove that the other has something to lose by continuing the conflict.<eos> Allowing two British parties to bloody each other further wouldn't be good for either of us.<eos> I'm sorry, have you seen any blood?<eos> Nor will you.
There's grace, a rhythm... An elegance.<eos> Oh, okay.<eos> I got shushed, but the purple prose is fine. Shh!<eos> She is gonna pull it off, though, right?<eos> Yes. Yeah, she will.
A story to save a town, and a puppet from a nightmare.<eos> You see, you've just seen the world through the eyes of a storyteller.<eos> The mighty armies of the Mire -- brutal, sadistic, undefeated.<eos> Even I believed the stories.<eos> But after today, no-one will again.
I know you think you're helping me...<eos> I am helping you.<eos> You'll see.<eos> - I don't see.<eos> You will.
Nick was actually really nice to me.<eos> Surprisingly decent.<eos> Well, that seems like a story worth telling.<eos> I don't know what to do.<eos> You will.
So, tell your wife and your president, we don't back down.<eos> I will convey your message, Mr. President.<eos> But to be honest, I have no idea what you're talking about.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> They will.
They're on their way,<eos> (Sarah) what if those guys come in before they get here?<eos> Upstairs, behind all that stuff in mom's closet.<eos> But if they find us up there...<eos> They won't.
By killing him, I have done the Azawad Liberation Movement a favor.<eos> So now what?<eos> Now we wait to see if you live or die.<eos> Pray they find him and he has this flash drive you say is so valuable.<eos> They will.
I don't know about that.<eos> All I know is, the Major that contacted me is missing, and I expect to be next.<eos> The least I can do is try and clear my conscience.<eos> Might take that into account when I get to hell.<eos> They won't.
If you go as quickly as you were presumably going when you hit him...<eos> I didn't hit him, Doctor.<eos> I found him lying in the middle of the road.<eos> You'll need someone to hold Boris while you drive.<eos> I will!
That's why we're running away.<eos> To be left alone.<eos> Yeah, and fuck me !<eos> - Not for long, till it calms down.<eos> - It will my ass !
I don't want to go through life always worried about what's around the next corner.<eos> And I don't want my kids to, either.<eos> - Your kids? - Yeah.<eos> What happened to Steffan can never happen again.<eos> - It won't.
For an eternity.<eos> I lost everything, over and over again... until I agreed to give them what they demanded... submission.<eos> Soldier no more.<eos> I stand before you.<eos> Broken to your will.
It just came, like, pouring out of me. I posted it at 3 A.M. this morning. It's already gotten 10,000 views.<eos> I didn't put your name in it, but I did put your cell phone number.<eos> Your business is gonna take off.<eos> I don't have a business.<eos> You will now.
So, what do I do?<eos> You tell Alex that we'll take the deal.<eos> I mean, Cody will understand.<eos> No, no, man.<eos> She won't.
They meaning us and not you.<eos> How you should leave us behind if we can't keep up.<eos> Glenn is out there risking his life for you and for everyone else and I'm still here, so I don't know what the hell you're talking about.<eos> Things are gonna get worse and then we'll see.<eos> Yeah, we will.
- What?<eos> - And if that happens, we'll never have to deal with her again.<eos> Well... so you won't be my manager, either?<eos> No.<eos> I won't.
And such a kind face.<eos> May I have a better look?<eos> Like an angel.<eos> Although I will have wings someday.<eos> Of course you will...
- It's okay.<eos> Just stay-stay back.<eos> What is that?<eos> - I'm pulling over.<eos> - Like hell you will.
Yes, yes.<eos> That as well.<eos> Please do give her my best.<eos> I shall include her in my prayers.<eos> I will.
I'm dealing with it.<eos> Well, when you've "dealt" with it, perhaps you'll take the time, to read my proposal.<eos> I haven't got the time, to read anything !<eos> Not even my own newspaper.<eos> So, when will you?
I was wrong, to blame you for what you did.<eos> You were going to do it eventually, I see that.<eos> It was a stupid mistake.<eos> And it will never happen again.<eos> Of course it will.
I can help you find a name if you want.<eos> When I grow up will you take care of me.<eos> Then we'll have a bird, for then Mom will be dead.<eos> Mom won't die.<eos> Well, someday, she will.
We're not just royalty.<eos> We are more than an alliance.<eos> We're different.<eos> We love each other.<eos> And we always will.
This was my fault.<eos> I'm the one who's going to fix this.<eos> By using dark magic to add a memory wipe to the curse.<eos> But you won't like where it leads.<eos> Or worse... you will.
- Stand clear.<eos> - You have no idea what's coming.<eos> - What are you talking about?<eos> Stand clear.<eos> - And you never will!
He didn't have a problem, apparently, Much to my surprise,<eos> And, uh, I'm a-- I'm a sausage man.<eos> You know, for me, I--I just wanted to stick to my guns And--and be the sausage man who I am,<eos> And I just didn't want to turn my back On the sausage community.<eos> I won't.
Time to go.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> How did they find us?<eos> They didn't.<eos> And they won't.
Okay, looks like your total comes to $37.98.<eos> Would you like to give a dollar to help feed hungry kids?<eos> Yes, I would like to give a dollar.<eos> You want to give a dollar?<eos> Yes, I will.
And that is what you must remember as you move ahead in this life.<eos> Move ahead?<eos> I don't know how.<eos> I'm confident that you will find a way.<eos> Maybe not today or tomorrow, but you will, Mary.
George Bligh and his bastard Jew.<eos> Be realistic.<eos> - Don't say that.<eos> - Why not ?<eos> Everyone else will.
I thought about what you said on the phone the other day, and... He could've been suicidal.<eos> Anyway, after you called, I started poking around.<eos> He had a beer fridge, and I found this in the freezer.<eos> I don't know what to make of it.<eos> Maybe you will.
Hey!<eos> Now you're making me mad.<eos> Get him, Drax.<eos> I have no quarrel with this man.<eos> But you will.
Really? How'd I do?<eos> Good!<eos> I have no maternal instincts whatsoever, do I?<eos> Well, no. Oh.<eos> But you will!
Okay, let me... let me try.<eos> Really good.<eos> We might make a big mess again.<eos> Mmm, that daddy's gonna be cleaning up. - Yes, he is.<eos> - Yes, he will.
Instagram, Snapchat, Vine.<eos> Everyone's on notice.<eos> Well, my phone's already blowing up.<eos> I just have to make sure people have a good time when they show up.<eos> Which they will.
- Back so soon? - Hey.<eos> - How was the show?<eos> - Don't ask.<eos> Okay.<eos> I won't.
Werewolf pubes.<eos> Now, I shall be coming door to door over the next couple days to retrieve pubic hair samples From each and every one of y'all up in he-yump.<eos> So if you could please do me the favor of having a dirty curly at the ready, preferably clean, I'd appreciate that.<eos> He-yump.<eos> Gentlemen pallbearers, if you will.
Yes.<eos> Yes, Amphitryon, at long last I will tell you.<eos> He was not my son, I know it!<eos> - Do not dare deny it!<eos> - I will not.
Come here.<eos> Come on, look at this window.<eos> We can see the side yard too, OK?<eos> We'll... we'll put one man on the back porch, one in the front, and we'll see anyone coming.<eos> Not after dark, we won't.
I think there' something wrong with your suit.<eos> Yeah. There' a dead guy in it.<eos> [ALL LAUGHING]<eos> Hey, watch your back out there, sir.<eos> No one else will.
I mean, there can't be too many places that fit that description.<eos> Training' over.<eos> I'll see you tomorrow.<eos> We don't even know where we're going.<eos> We will soon enough.
Here.<eos> Here.<eos> Here.<eos> If they reach town, it's the end of us.<eos> They won't.
There's got to be a way out.<eos> Macha, please, please?<eos> You don't understand.<eos> If she doesn't sing her song, she'll die.<eos> So will you, and your son, and all your kind.
Well, I can't go back to Hot Dog Castle right now 'cause things just got very unpleasant there.<eos> OK?<eos> Well..<eos> - Don't go faster, Ellie.<eos> - I won't.
- Whose side are you on, Francis?<eos> - There are no sides, Ray.<eos> Now, there's the protocol office, the chamberlain, the aide-de-camp and of course your lady-in-waiting, Madge, the Prince's inner circle.<eos> Now, you must know exactly where to place each of these individuals in the pecking order because almost every single one of them makes a profession to flatter and deceive.<eos> You won't.
Forgive me.<eos> You are my son...<eos> I need you to listen...<eos> You didn't tell Caesar about the guns we found?<eos> Neither will you.
'Mi casa' 'Es su casa.'<eos> Deep breath now, Havana.<eos> Breathe.<eos> What if she comes to the house?<eos> She won't.
You just want to crawl inside that young vagina and hide from the world, but you'll be disappointed.<eos> She has no experience, no endurance, no training, no muscle.<eos> - You'll hate it.<eos> - Mm.<eos> - You will.
His pictures look as if they were painted by somebody born without hands!<eos> Mr Haydon, what is your quarrel?<eos> What principles have you applied other than those that I gave?<eos> - Mr Haydon, please lower your voice.<eos> - I will not, sir!
And they'll let me move in on the 15th.<eos> Well, where is it?<eos> It's like a half-hour away.<eos> We're not going to see each other again.<eos> Of course we will.
With time, the legend grew disproportionately.<eos> People were undoubtedly exaggerating, as they usually do.<eos> The only thing that is known for certain is that all who tried to find this earthly paradise got lost on the way.<eos> Father, why can't I have a dog of my own?<eos> You will, Inge.
Scarlett, it's not gonna work.<eos> George.<eos> I can't.<eos> I won't go without you.<eos> I won't.
Everybody knows that guy deserved it.<eos> - But, seriously, I'm sorry.<eos> - It's alright.<eos> You know, I'm gonna land on my feet.<eos> - Oh, you will.
The entitlements.<eos> Raising the age of eligibility to 67.<eos> Your people will never go for it.<eos> They will if the leadership does.<eos> And the leadership will.
Why?<eos> Why do you want her?<eos> Why does everyone want her?<eos> So nurturing, isn't she, Sir M?<eos> Gentlemen, if you will.
How?<eos> Pleasure boating with the Shah of Iran and some centerfolds flown over by Flooze Magazine.<eos> Reza, the Shah?<eos> He's got no pull with OPEC. - He has no power.<eos> - He will soon.
Did you take care of him?<eos> Oh, just making sure, this was the white one, not the colored fella?<eos> The man who struck me, yes.<eos> He is no longer.<eos> God willed it.
- Family photos.<eos> One of my projects is to put together a Kitteridge family book for the kids.<eos> Be nice for them to have that, don't you think?<eos> Well, maybe for Christopher's child, but I'm not sure it'll mean much to your other two.<eos> Sure it will.
- Yes... because you can't seem to take no for an answer, someone very important to me got the wrong impression, cost me a great deal.<eos> Mr. Ewing, I'm so sorry.<eos> I promise it won't happen again.<eos> You're right.<eos> It won't.
Yeah, you'll find her no problems.<eos> - Will I?<eos> Jahmazing.<eos> - Are you some kind of moron?<eos> Of course you fucking won't.
I've done the paperwork.<eos> You get it sent off.<eos> And then, one way or another, we'll soon know for sure.<eos> Yes.<eos> We will.
Are you insane? This is not what God wants.<eos> Don't you see it?<eos> Open your eyes and wash the sins out.<eos> I can't.<eos> I won't!
I've just been killing time. Waiting for you to come back.<eos> There's nothing wrong about us.<eos> We're not even related.<eos> I don't ever want to lose you again.<eos> You won't.
I haven't been home in a long time, so...<eos> - We're looking forward to seeing them all back here soon.<eos> And wish Jonathan a happy Christmas from all of us in Dulais, will you?<eos> - Of course.<eos> Of course I will.
But at our house we are the best.<eos> You know this.<eos> For me it's enough that you just consider it.<eos> Would you consider it?<eos> Yes, I will.
We're not gonna kill a child.<eos> Agent Callen, why don't you ask your partner what we should do.<eos> We'll take her with us.<eos> If she slows us down-- and I want you to understand this-- you're trading her life for Kensi's.<eos> She won't.
Whoa, hey. What are you doing?<eos> 30m! -<eos> This is the only picture I have of you.<eos> You don't need a picture of me.<eos> You never will again.
And after the show, he will go to the lost and found and try to take it back.<eos> That's when we get him.<eos> Nice.<eos> Unless he doesn't try to take it.<eos> Oh, he will.
Nothing.<eos> For being Dad.<eos> For saying things like "Seriously, bedtime."<eos> You let me know if you need anything.<eos> I will.
And I think it's good that we clear this up.<eos> Anyway, uh, I imagine it's a difficult time.<eos> Ethan must be taking the breakup badly.<eos> He can't understand it.<eos> Well, he will...
Yes. Um, I can't not tell him.<eos> I mean, I could not tell him.<eos> Is that what you're getting at?<eos> No, you're saying tell him.<eos> Oh! Which I will.
If you insist...<eos> Hurry UP! Despica-portion!<eos> This should do it. Noby! Shizuka is here!<eos> It'll make Shizuka hate you.<eos> So will everyone else too.
And now it's Olympia, whatever that is.<eos> Somebody's got to be making progress somewhere.<eos> It's not true what you said...<eos> That no one would miss you.<eos> I will.
No, I'm not sure, 'cause I'm not sure about anything.<eos> Something just fell out of my body, so I gotta go deal with that, and you need to deal with me dealing with that.<eos> Well, you do what you got to do, girl.<eos> All right, well, maybe I'll talk to you soon.<eos> You will.
Alison.<eos> Me?<eos> No, thank you.<eos> I'm gonna sit this one out.<eos> No, you won't.
So, I'm sorry for how I've been acting lately.<eos> I know you've got these plans for us, and... Me going out on Luke's tour is messing that up.<eos> But, uh... I don't want you to have any more doubts about our relationship.<eos> Layla Grant... ♪ I love that boy... ♪ Will you marry me?<eos> [Voice breaking] Hell yeah, I will!
I love you.<eos> Love you, too!<eos> Right back at you.<eos> All right, you girls need to go to bed.<eos> - All right? - No, we won't.
Like what?<eos> We can't catch them now.<eos> We are surrounded by your ancestors.<eos> They will slow Wirepa down.<eos> I won't.
We can't catch them now.<eos> We are surrounded by your ancestors.<eos> They will slow Wirepa down.<eos> I won't.<eos> You will.
It's not who I am?<eos> You don't know who I am!<eos> - Yes, I do.<eos> - Well, I don't know who you are.<eos> Yes, you will.
You don't know who I am!<eos> - Yes, I do.<eos> - Well, I don't know who you are.<eos> Yes, you will.<eos> We will.
If I see this glass empty again, I will be very - unhappy.<eos> - Perish the<eos> - Now, then.<eos> Who'd like to go first?<eos> All right, then I will.
What am I gonna do, Stuart?<eos> All I know is how to be married.<eos> Kinda envy Tommy.<eos> At least he knows who he is.<eos> And you will too.
It's weird.<eos> - And if she dies, she won't... she won't even get to do that, let alone hold her grandchild.<eos> We'll... It'll be OK.<eos> Whatever happens, we'll figure it out.<eos> We will.
Actually...<eos> Milo, when you left the store yesterday, Dylan and I started talking about how jealous you seemed, and we wondered if you were picking up on something, so we lit a communication candle, talked it out, and realized that we're still in love.<eos> Dylan, will you marry me... Right here, right now?<eos> Yes!<eos> I will!
You think you deserve this more?<eos> - Prove it.<eos> - We're on the same side.<eos> Prove you're worth more.<eos> - No, I won't.
We can not remain seated here.<eos> We need to find an exit or we will die of thirst miserably!<eos> Stop it out at this Death chatter!<eos> We do not die!<eos> - Yes, we will!
We need to find an exit or we will die of thirst miserably!<eos> Stop it out at this Death chatter!<eos> We do not die!<eos> - Yes, we will!<eos> - No, we will not!
Why are you doing nothing?<eos> I do not want to!<eos> Do not do it!<eos> Lie quietly and close your eyes. If you zappelst, it will only hurt you.<eos> No, I will not, no, no!
Your grandpa.<eos> He broke his nose.<eos> He grounded us for three weeks.<eos> And, sweetie, you know... It got less scary.<eos> And all of this will too.
But this... this is our only chance.<eos> Think of our baby.<eos> Think of being a mother.<eos> Our child will never know its father.<eos> Of course it will.
We need to go.<eos> They're almost here.<eos> We're at the coordinates you sent, sir.<eos> But we can't get a visual on the targets.<eos> You will.
And just tell Gemma you know me.<eos> She'll give you a good rate, okay?<eos> I'll do that. Thanks.<eos> - Maybe see you around.<eos> - Yeah, maybe you will.
Karim's starting his evening shift so he can't come. I just want someone to be there.<eos> I don't feel very well.<eos> I'm just a little bit worried.<eos> Will you come with me? Yeah.<eos> 'Course I will.
- I'm fine with what I have.<eos> - Okay, cool.<eos> Well, I'm just gonna leave it there in case you change your mind.<eos> We are down the hall if you need anything.<eos> I won't, but, uh, thanks for the Chinese.
Hey, kid, I paid for that, I expect to see that eaten.<eos> First glance, I'd say, a shotgun.<eos> Eat it, God damn it.<eos> Will you not come?<eos> - No, Drake, I will not.
- How dumb do you think...<eos> Mike, stop talking!<eos> So, where am I on the driving rotation?<eos> Um... y-you're like the alternate in case we need you to drive.<eos> - But we won't.
Yes. A child died here.<eos> What tourist is gonna want to come to Gracepoint with all those tents front and center, hmm?<eos> We ought to march over there and pull them down ourselves.<eos> Though first, I will have one more bourbon.<eos> Oh, no. You won't, actually.
Not Bracken's guys. Not now.<eos> And how about Donovan's guys?<eos> He'll have cops up there.<eos> There's no way we're getting near that place.<eos> We will.
You and me both.<eos> That's why I came to you.<eos> I need resources, I need information.<eos> I don't even know you.<eos> You will.
But thanks for the vote of confidence.<eos> Aunt madi had unintentionally touched a nerve in dad.<eos> As crazy as he was about Allison, he just wanted to be the guy she was dating, not the blind guy she was dating.<eos> There were people who dad let take care of him...<eos> Ow. An inner circle, if you will.
No.<eos> Father says girls have no need to learn to read.<eos> He would read the only book worth reading and read it to me.<eos> And then, one day, he would find the right man to take over the job.<eos> God's will.
- HE WAS RIGHT THERE!<eos> RIGHT WITHIN MY GRASP!<eos> NOW GONE!<eos> I'll not rest until the Master is destroyed!<eos> And now, neither will he!
Mmm, and it all belongs to me... And whomever I marry.<eos> Well, just the other day I was saying to my husband... Oh, did I say husband?<eos> I meant, father.<eos> I don't have a husband.<eos> Perhaps I will someday.
To the ferry would be nice.<eos> Cedar cove?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Just do me a favor and do your job, make sure the feds hold up their end of the deal.<eos> Yeah, they will.
No, not Jeb.<eos> If there were more Jeb Cosgroves, the financial crisis would never have happened.<eos> He proved that you didn't have to be horrible...<eos> I'll interview the pretty widow.<eos> Of course you will.
Got some human organs, some torture devices.<eos> All those are for sex.<eos> Well, sometimes you need to push the envelope.<eos> So, what happens when that tox report comes back and I can link you to the poison?<eos> You won't.
Can you do that?<eos> - So here we are again.<eos> - No. You said that I would never have to make this call.<eos> - You don't have to.<eos> - And I won't. I won't, David.
- Where is she?<eos> - She's safe.<eos> I understand.<eos> I think I understand.<eos> But the people of Vega won't.
And if they're not?<eos> If the DNA is right, and you put the wrong man-- an innocent man-- on death row?<eos> Then I will find the right man, Conrad, and I will just have to live with the rest of it.<eos> You're not the only one who'll have to live with it, D.B.<eos> This lab will.
Wendy, I can't get the TV to work.<eos> Okay, buddy.<eos> All right. Let's see what's going on.<eos> Let's go see.<eos> Okay, I will.
How the heck can he be?<eos> Buy yourself a nice funeral, your dirty pussy.<eos> Is it available here, ladies?<eos> - What do you want?<eos> - That all men will:
As you wish.<eos> Do you have any weapons?<eos> Why?<eos> You'll need them.<eos> We both will.
Eat your broccoli.<eos> Martin's been secretly taking self-defense courses, and now he's beating up Nelson. Hi-yah!<eos> His fat fists are a blur.<eos> I've never seen moves like that.<eos> And never will again.
- How long have you been out here?<eos> - We landed last week.<eos> - You seen any Germans yet?<eos> - Not yet.<eos> - You will.
Mack, I love you so much.<eos> I cannot go back out there and watch you die.<eos> I'm not gonna die.<eos> Yes, you will.<eos> We all will.
God, we get it, Marla.<eos> Gluten.<eos> But if you want to make a movie, and you're ready to work...<eos> I am.<eos> I will.
He will.<eos> He's a good man.<eos> I'll never meet someone as good as Bobby to share things with.<eos> ~ Oh, come on...<eos> ~ I... I won't, Cilla.
Alf, could you really beat Richard?<eos> Well, she said that he was a sprinter, so let's make it an endurance event.<eos> You got it, Wikus, I'll design it myself.<eos> I'll call it "the Master Race".<eos> We probably won't.
- It's a joke, but-- - Sure. - But yes, um...<eos> - Mm-hmm.<eos> I know--I do know that things have been slow here, but obviously, things are gonna pick right back up.<eos> - Yeah, we think so.<eos> - Yeah. Oh, they will.
I can call off the hit men 'cause Elizabeth North is already dead.<eos> Please be joking.<eos> Please have good news.<eos> A source close to Elizabeth tells us she keeps a secret apartment under an assumed name at the Findley.<eos> A love nest, if you will.
-So, this is their<eos> -Well, it's quite interesting, 'cause I've never driven an S1 before.<eos> And I've not driven a Cooper S, so...<eos> So it'll be a voyage into the unknown.<eos> -Yes, it will.
Boss, I'm sorry I'm late.<eos> I couldn't hear my cell.<eos> It won't happen again, boss.<eos> You're right, McGee.<eos> It won't.
I had my reasons.<eos> There was no way out.<eos> I hate you!<eos> You swore you'd always love me.<eos> And I always will.
Rodney needs to watch it.<eos> I like him, Russell, I really do, but I worry that...<eos> Hell, he might be safer over in Iraq.<eos> Well, do you mind not telling him I brought you that, please, and if he don't bring the rest of it,<eos> I will on my next payday.
And when time came at last for King Erik to sleep he took crown and seed with him for permanent keep."<eos> JACK'S FATHER: "And as the king's bones slowly crumbled away truth became legend."<eos> Or so people say.<eos> What will happen when the giants come back?<eos> They won't, son.
The doctors don't know what she took, so we just have to wait.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I guess I'm an old romantic.<eos> I always hoped that when I finally said "I love you" to someone... she'd say the same thing back.<eos> - And that someone will.
Then it happened.<eos> I saw it all.<eos> She loved me. I know it.<eos> It's not fair what happened to her. And the same thing could happen to me.<eos> It won't.
For real.<eos> You can put your stuff in here.<eos> I don't have any stuff.<eos> Well, don't worry.<eos> You will.
Maybe next time?<eos> Anyway, I did what all bad gamblers do I borrowed more and played for higher and higher stakes hoping that my luck would change.<eos> And when that didn't happen... ...I panicked.<eos> To various people invariousways I am in for money I don't have.<eos> Never will.
It's okay.<eos> You're gonna have beige grandkids that are bilingual.<eos> We'll see about that, won't we?<eos> We will see about that.<eos> Yes, we will.
Will you pin it on me, Mama?<eos> Red.<eos> I might have known it would be red. It's pink.<eos> I can see your dirty pillows.<eos> Everyone will.
Let's have a story, naughty, naughty.<eos> What if they don't find her?<eos> They'll find her.<eos> Yeah, but what if they don't?<eos> They will.
See, see all the criminal activity happening in my trunk right now!<eos> Open the trunk, sir.<eos> - Open the...<eos> - Open the trunk, just open the trunk.<eos> - So I'll just... Oh!
I quit.<eos> Get back to work.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> This ever happens again...<eos> It won't.
- Can I have one?<eos> - Go ahead.<eos> Another thing.<eos> Quit smoking.<eos> Maybe this way he will, too.
It'll slip away bit by bit.<eos> Well, I hope you're wrong... ..but you're probably not.<eos> Of course, we don't have Louis' side of the story.<eos> - l still haven't heard from him.<eos> - Perhaps we never will.
Let him keep it for now.<eos> At least we know where it is.<eos> And besides...the key is useless without its counterpart.<eos> And what if Da Vinci obtains that?<eos> He won't.
I'm not gonna let that happen again.<eos> I can find him.<eos> I promise I'll find him.<eos> I promise.<eos> I will.
You picked a real psychopath.<eos> They've tied a total of six murders to him and his mother.<eos> They still haven't found camila, right?<eos> No.<eos> But they will.
Yes.<eos> I'm with someone else now.<eos> You know that.<eos> But I feel an infinite tenderness for you.<eos> I always will.
No. We don't.<eos> But honestly, Tinny, I'm -- Was- - I was a bad person, who has done in my past some very bad things.<eos> I don't care.<eos> I'm gonna miss you.<eos> Me too. I will.
Tyler, don't worry.<eos> I'm sure I'm gonna like your friends.<eos> Of course you will.
It's kind of serious.<eos> He gave her a promise ring.<eos> It won't last.<eos> It might.<eos> It won't.
And you'll say 'Yes, sir. '<eos> No fuckin' way.<eos> Yes, sir!"<eos> I won't say that!<eos> - Yes, you will. 'Yes, sir!
You arrogant bitch, you judge her before even seeing her!<eos> That was her choice.<eos> Good day.<eos> - Will she see me?<eos> - No. No, she won't.
- It's your fault, Klara.<eos> - No.<eos> - Bobo?<eos> - I'm never going to get a guy.<eos> - Of course you will.
Someone here asked me if I kept my stained clothes.<eos> How did that make you feel?<eos> Like I wanted to go home.<eos> But I don't have a home anymore, do I?<eos> You will.
OK, I'm going.<eos> - But not as long as you keep glaring at me.<eos> - Back off. Come on guys, back off.<eos> - Good. Do so then. Go.<eos> I will.
Call me Ivan.<eos> Are you crazy?<eos> Ivan Anatolivich Fontanov, like the old days.<eos> I never called you Ivan Anatoli in the old days.<eos> Well, you will now.
Just a feeling, I guess.<eos> Right.<eos> A feeling.<eos> I'll see you tomorrow.<eos> No, you won't, actually.
It's been radio silence.<eos> Really?<eos> - What about Grace?<eos> - No. And she won't answer her computer.<eos> Nobody will.
Lots of reasons.<eos> This place.<eos> It's never going to accept people like us.<eos> Never ever. It will. We'll make them change.<eos> No, it won't.
I mean, what would you say, anyway?<eos> We meet up and hug. So what?<eos> You tell your dad and... he won't understand.<eos> You tell people what we've been doing, they won't understand.<eos> No-one will.
She deserves a bit of fun, but you're so off your face you don't care.<eos> Toni, you're off your nut, aren't you?<eos> You've got to help me.<eos> You supplied her? What if it gets out?<eos> It won't.
It's too busy.<eos> And I love my scarf. Thank you.<eos> Does it go with the outfit?<eos> I don't know. I don't care.<eos> Well, your friends will.
Where's your dad?<eos> He walked out of Keystone, he walked back from Michigan.<eos> He'll be back.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Of course he will.
And that's after he sent thugs out to scare us.<eos> Well, the question is, is there anything else, anything I don't know?<eos> If that ain't enough, Sheriff, then there's nothing.<eos> He'll have his reckoning someday.<eos> Just like you will, just like I will.
How'd you find out -- organized crime tip?<eos> Organized wife tip.<eos> She has access to the guest lists for these types of things.<eos> She's not gonna be there, is she?<eos> Yeah, she will.
I am what you have made me.<eos> More soldiers return.<eos> They pry wood and beams searching for vermin.<eos> If we stay, will they not find us?<eos> They will.
Sir...<eos> I don't like to ask, but...<eos> Why are we even going there?<eos> They won't take me.<eos> They will.
I'm lucky you're here with me.<eos> Yeah.<eos> And I'll get through it.<eos> I'll get back on track. They won't even find out I was using.<eos> Yes, they will.
Yeah. This town's lousy with magic.<eos> Now you should go.<eos> If Neal suspects anything, it's gonna make everything we have to do that much harder.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> He won't.
Believers.<eos> People that know that magic is real.<eos> And that it doesn't belong in this world and are willing to do something about it.<eos> This little quest of yours to cleanse the world of magic... It's not gonna work.<eos> No, of course it will.
My family got to Texas.<eos> They're, uh waiting for me.<eos> Well, then you have to get back to them.<eos> I want you to know I love you, Aaron.<eos> I always will.
We will get him.<eos> He's a bad guy, and we will get him.<eos> We just have to do it the right way.<eos> Okay.<eos> Yeah, we will.
They're negative, make them positive.<eos> I can't have children.<eos> What does Vivian say?<eos> I haven't told her yet.<eos> I will, of course.
I need you, Christine, I want you and I... I can't imagine my life without you. I don't want to...<eos> I just want to spend the rest of my life with you by my side.<eos> Christine... will you marry me?<eos> Yes.<eos> Of course I will.
Yeah.<eos> - Do you have an e-mail account?<eos> Isn't it the best?<eos> Are you gonna miss your American family?<eos> Yeah, yeah, I will.
So we'll... we'll never know?<eos> It needs to unfurl on its own,<eos> Anonymously, Where the world can't interfere.<eos> And if she's carrying what we think, You will know.<eos> We all will.
You say you want peace.<eos> Your so-called road to peace is splattered with our blood.<eos> Call us the Crimson Resistance.<eos> We don't know when death will come.<eos> Neither will you.
Call us the Crimson Resistance.<eos> We don't know when death will come.<eos> Neither will you.<eos> The people we love were taken from us, and we never had a chance to say good-bye.<eos> Neither will you.
Gates will see.<eos> I don't care.<eos> I can't believe this is happening.<eos> We're gonna find her, Castle.<eos> We will.
I don't...<eos> I-I need to have more time.<eos> Maybe we can do that sometime, you know, someday.<eos> How will I know if you made it?<eos> You won't.
Shall we get on?<eos> -You only have one computer, is that correct?<eos> -Yes.<eos> But I don't see what that's got to do with what happened to that woman.<eos> You will.
Unless you don't think you'll need a bathroom.<eos> - Then I guess...<eos> - I'm gonna need a bathroom.<eos> Right.<eos> Of course you will.
No, I am.<eos> Really.<eos> I'm sure Victor would... Oh, we'll see.<eos> I love you, Richard.<eos> I always will.
Tanya, why is Sam on the coffee and off the Cointreau?<eos> I think he's going to airport.<eos> He's going to the airport.<eos> Will you talk to her and make sure she comes out at half-term?<eos> Yes. Course she will.
Ah, Jack.<eos> I wanted to thank you for allowing us the use of the tavern.<eos> Yeah, sure, but you'll have to excuse me. I'm running late.<eos> Actually, we were hoping to discuss involving you with the campaign in a more official capacity.<eos> Our very own, uh, "Joe the plumber," if you will.
Things were hard.<eos> Very hard.<eos> Philip must be excited about your family growing.<eos> I haven't told him.<eos> I will, of course.
♪ Where the teardrops<eos> ♪ Banished<eos> I'm sneaking off.<eos> I wish I knew why.<eos> You will.
So what are you gonna do?<eos> I'm gonna be honest with my mom.<eos> Tell her that I don't want to sit next to Uncle Rod at Thanksgiving this year.<eos> I can't.<eos> I won't.
For all the good it does. Yes.<eos> - Are you French? - Yes.<eos> Oh!<eos> I'd love to go to France again.<eos> But I never will.
Annie Wilson, will you marry me?<eos> Oh, my God, are you serious?<eos> Yeah.<eos> And it's romantic as hell, and I'm not taking no for an answer this time.<eos> Yes. Yes, I will.
If we act together, we are stronger.<eos> So the FBI has Officer Mantel's body?<eos> No.<eos> You do.<eos> Or you will momentarily.
Their purpose is to delay the passing of the Ten Hour Bill, a bill that merely seeks to ensure that no child works more than ten hours a day.<eos> Our children know nothing but work and suffering from Monday morning to Saturday night.<eos> The cruelties inflicted upon them, the long hours they work, would disgrace a West Indian plantation!<eos> We shall have the Ten Hour Bill!<eos> Yes, we will...
The tassels are made out of their hair.<eos> The harness, their sinews.<eos> The very oil with which the wheels are greased is made of infants' blood!<eos> 'We shall have the Ten Hour Bill! '<eos> 'Yes, we will, yes, we will! '
You've been to hell and back. I know how important this is to you.<eos> I owe you.<eos> We all do.<eos> - As long as we get the real bomber.<eos> - We will.
She will tell her story, and make the rest of the world believe it as well.<eos> As long as they remain in that bubble, we'll continue with business as usual.<eos> Nikita's too smart.<eos> Your illusion won't hold.<eos> Yes, it will.
Do you want to hear this?<eos> To be honest, I normally would never come here.<eos> But things have changed in my life.<eos> The spirits say, if you're asking Whether or not the cancer will kill you, Their answer is...<eos> No, it will not.
No.<eos> Yes!<eos> Where-where are the woods?<eos> Well, I'll tell you what... I'll drive you there myself.<eos> - Ha! - Yes, I will.
Do you have to?<eos> My father keeps a scrapbook on me.<eos> He Googles me every morning.<eos> He's gonna understand.<eos> - He will.
It's our only chance. We just did a Houdini act get get away from that guy.<eos> Kamali's the only man who knows where the antivirus is, Scott.<eos> Without a cure, Martinez and everyone at that base who's infected is dead, and if we can't contain it there, who knows how many more?<eos> That "far, far better that that I do" shit might work on him. Doesn't work on me.<eos> So what will, Scott, what will?
Now I want to go into that list of buyers again, see if one of them has a registered .22.<eos> Please, I got people from the City Council calling me, diplomats from the State Department.<eos> It's like half the traders on wall street bought one of those cars.<eos> We're done. I can't go to this kid's father and tell him we have the guy who murdered his son. I can't do that.<eos> Then I will.
Except for the delay, nothing has changed.<eos> The key players remain in position to execute the plan.<eos> Except now the Secret Service is investigating.<eos> Now you tell me what happens when they discover that Dr. Sanders is responsible for the blood thinner.<eos> They won't.
- Hmm... wise man.<eos> Let's begin.<eos> A blindfold?<eos> Please, I've came so far to see your petals in bloom.<eos> And you will, you will.
Yeah.<eos> We both got secrets we don't want getting out. I mean, I could tell everyone that Lexie is Audrey and that you knew all along.<eos> The guard will come for you. You want that?<eos> The guard will come for both of us.<eos> Yeah, and they'll...
I'm sorry, you're going to have to go to the end of the line.<eos> No, sweetie, the end of the line.<eos> I'm guessing we're not going to have time to see Santa today.<eos> What if we don't meet her?<eos> We will.
Actually, no.<eos> It's a very, very bad thing.<eos> You're a fool not to run.<eos> Silas will find you.<eos> Or he won't.
He hasn't killed anyone in months.<eos> Both answers are still no. Jack!<eos> If this is about what happened between us...<eos> Nothing happened between us.<eos> And nothing ever will again.
I know ... a-and remember that one time I wouldn't stop picking my nose and so she ... she put that dog cone collar on me?<eos> She cannot find out about this.<eos> Wait.<eos> Wait.<eos> She won't!
You're stronger than the rest of them.<eos> -Stronger than he is. -(struggling)<eos> It's not me you want to fight.<eos> Batman:<eos> No. No, I won't!
I'll run it back.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Want to tell me who it is that needs restraining?<eos> I need to know what you're doing, Tara.<eos> You will.
It's kind of the whole objective, actually.<eos> You see my point?<eos> You should know, I find post hoc negotiation... distasteful.<eos> Such a shame you won't get to see what your works have wrought, doctor.<eos> But soon, everyone else will.
Joss, I never laid a hand on either one of y'all.<eos> No! I'd just find you asleep on the kitchen floor cradling a gun, with our son in the next room.<eos> Well, that's not gonna happen again.<eos> You're right.<eos> It won't.
We have just as much right...<eos> I have laryngitis today.<eos> And I need everyone to quiet down.<eos> Your Honor, if we could call a witness to the stand to speak to the defense's lies?<eos> No, I won't.
Kangchi is wrong for you.<eos> You never should have gotten close.<eos> He can turn human with the Book of the Nine.<eos> Then his destiny will change.<eos> So will the Venerable's prophecy.
You would trust this Circe after all she has done?<eos> You would be lucky to return with your life.<eos> Then we have to find another way.<eos> Do not worry my love, for you are everything to me... ..and I will not lose you.<eos> I will not.
Will it definitely come up?<eos> They're meeting for a big chat, JP.<eos> Ooh, big chat.<eos> No-one likes a big chat.<eos> Still, maybe it won't.
I could never be mad at that guy.<eos> He says my favorite word twice in a row.<eos> Now, I'm gonna go talk to your father and get him to bring back the Christmas Carnival.<eos> Peter, I don't think that's gonna work.<eos> Sure, it will.
Okay, then shut up.<eos> You can have the Asians back, but I wanna negotiate my own terms.<eos> That is so cute.<eos> Now shut your silly little mouth, or you will never see Fred again.<eos> In fact, no one will.
.. In sure and certain hope of resurrection to eternal life.<eos> What will you do now, ghost of John Trenchard?<eos> I will stay in the village I should never have left. And I will marry the only woman I have ever loved.<eos> If she'll take me?<eos> She will.
Do you remember when we kicked the shit out of Ryan?<eos> I liked that.<eos> That was mad.<eos> Why don't you come back to school?<eos> Maybe I will.
You got what you wanted!<eos> But you can't have it all.<eos> I warned you, damn it! I did, but you never listen!<eos> Do what you want, but I can't do this to your father!<eos> I won't!
Do you hear me?<eos> I have my own private movie.<eos> You will never finish this film without me, and you know it.<eos> Do you understand what I say?<eos> You will never...
- You want her?<eos> Then give me what I was promised.<eos> You did your job well, now keep your word.<eos> - He'll kill us both. - Shut up.<eos> - He will.
- I'm going to work for my father.<eos> - Do not do this!<eos> Do not give up!<eos> But you?<eos> When will the next flashmob?
You're pregnant?<eos> How could you do that?<eos> Uh, I don't really have a choice.<eos> You think it'll make a difference?<eos> Of course it will.
My God!<eos> I know.<eos> It's Swiss. We've been here four hours.<eos> If they keep losing, he'll have an attack.<eos> We all will.
Kali what are you staring at?<eos> Hurry up and get Ashatai!<eos> Oh God!<eos> What happened, Lachi?<eos> Nothing yet, but something sure will!
- This is pure torture.<eos> - What a feat!<eos> Now there's penalty shootout.<eos> It's hard, but there is hope.<eos> Who will not?
This is just kind of thing you wanna build?<eos> Oh, I would be very proud if I'd done this.<eos> Did you always wanna be an architect?<eos> Ah, you'll laugh if I tell you what my ambition is. What?<eos> No... no, I won't.
So what was it like there?<eos> Big, lots of buildings.<eos> I got a bit lost.<eos> We'll figure it out.<eos> -We will?
And as crazy as this all has gotten,<eos> I know why you did everything.<eos> Because I love you.<eos> And I love you.<eos> I always will.
♪ The hands of time... But I'm hoping this new medication does the trick, because if it's physical, I'm sick.<eos> But if it's in my head, I'm just crazy.<eos> You're not crazy.<eos> Well... Maybe you're a little crazy, but I still love you.<eos> And I always will.
Look, they'll be happier with you guys.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - Okay.<eos> And as soon as Nathan comes home you'll be a family again.<eos> And he will, Haley.
That baby turns into a little girl just as fast.<eos> - So maybe you're - - Don't say it.<eos> Look, if that kid's yours -<eos> I said don't say it!<eos> Fine. I won't.
I would like for you to eat the steak and the foie gras.<eos> I really would.<eos> I can't do that.<eos> You can...<eos> But you won't.

What's the occasion?<eos> I just thought we've got all this fine china and good crystal;<eos> - But it's for company.<eos> - We never have company.<eos> But we will.
Go on, sign it.<eos> Okay.<eos> Has everybody signed?<eos> No, you're the first.<eos> But they will.
No, I'll teach you.<eos> I mean...<eos> If you want me to help you, I'm happy to.<eos> - Holly, would you please help--<eos> - Yes, I will!
Go live your life.<eos> Live it without me, because there is no place for us together.<eos> And fill your heart with love for someone else...<eos> Someone who can love you the way I never have.<eos> The way I never will.
- What?<eos> I don't.<eos> Yeah, well, you might someday.<eos> You're right, McNally.<eos> Maybe I will someday.
Dead man's soul should not see the reﬂection in the mirror.<eos> It's bad.<eos> You really believe in all that bullshit?<eos> If you don't believe in it, uncover it.<eos> I will, too.
Matthew Stone.<eos> I can't believe it.<eos> This guy's bigger than Steve Jobs.<eos> A lot of people are going to feel this loss.<eos> At least one person won't.
We get enough crap as it is.<eos> King, I'm... I'm Hank Odum.<eos> I know.<eos> That name... it means...<eos> And it won't anymore.
It's not before now.<eos> It's now now.<eos> Understand?<eos> Not now.<eos> Well, maybe Dr. Crosetti will.
- Yeah, so lawyer down.<eos> You know what?<eos> We're gonna see you in court, man.<eos> - See you there.<eos> - No, we will.
You are surely not in love with Christopher Tietjens?<eos> You mustn't be.<eos> He's a married man.<eos> But when he comes home, he will make me his mistress.<eos> Or he won't.
Then he finally saw me in that way.<eos> And now you want to mutilate me.<eos> Doug, I really think that you...<eos> He will leave me, Dr. Reid.<eos> Maybe not right away, but he will.
Mmmm. You know what?<eos> I hope to God that when we die, our "work product" doesn't flash before our eyes.<eos> But for some of us, that's all we have.<eos> All right, if she releases all future claims...<eos> She will, she will, all right?
- I order Mr. Sorrento returned to Italy.<eos> I just thought that we had some kind of future together.<eos> - I'm so sorry.<eos> - Will you take this man to be your lawfully wedded husband?<eos> I... I will.
I got scared today.<eos> I actually got scared.<eos> I mean... some numb-nuts knocks me down, and all I can think about is losing what I never thought I'd have... so from on, I will ride the desk, all right?<eos> And I will even try and like it.<eos> No, you won't.
- How can you tell?<eos> - Not bad.<eos> - That is only the first wave.<eos> - We'Il handle this.<eos> - No, I will.
If you do me one and watch where you're dripping.<eos> Isaak Sirko.<eos> What about him?<eos> Call off the 24-hour surveillance.<eos> Like hell I will.
- You didn't. Who did?<eos> - There's no way--<eos> - Meredith, he was your father.<eos> You probably both said a whole lot of mean things to each other, but you loved him and he loved you.<eos> More than Otis ever will.
Come on kid.<eos> Leave that, come inside.<eos> - I'll be right there.<eos> I knew it that you'll come.<eos> - Of course I will.
What happened?<eos> You forget about me?<eos> Something came up.<eos> It won't happen again.<eos> No... It won't.
And then I told her about the tumour.<eos> Don't say anything.<eos> Of course not.<eos> Well, unless they do.<eos> No, they won't.
I-I know you're frustrated.<eos> And me too.<eos> I'll call you tomorrow during my study break?<eos> Yeah. Okay.<eos> No, I'll...
Mom, did you tell him yours?<eos> We've been very honest with each other.<eos> Well... It's a good start, I guess. We'll talk.<eos> We'll talk after school.<eos> We'll... hmm.
Emily, there are a lot of people who don't want this trial to proceed.<eos> Dangerous people. My mother died when I was a baby, and my father has been the only family I've ever known and they slit his throat.<eos> They are going to have to kill me if they want me to give this up.<eos> Well let's hope it doesn't come to that.<eos> And it won't.
Oh, Christ, I'm not worried about my chair catching on fire.<eos> Look, sir, can you just get us a better table in general? Unfortunately, no.<eos> We're fully booked tonight due to a Groupon deal.<eos> Oh, that sounds excellent. We'll have one of those.<eos> No, we won't.
Hold me.<eos> I swear, I don't know if I'm feverish or freezing.<eos> Oh, please, tell me everything's going to be all right, Kevin.<eos> Even if it won't.<eos> Even if it won't.
Well, Avery's got a gig at the 5 spot.<eos> You should come.<eos> Bring anyone you want.<eos> Uh, yeah.<eos> Yeah. I'll... I'll...
Maybe a tagger saw something... or the unsub left his mark.<eos> My son.<eos> You've been so brave.<eos> I have no fear.<eos> You will.
We steer a little bit of his paycheck into a quiet little slush fund.<eos> He can do whatever he wants with it.<eos> And if he were using this slush fund to binge on his favorite bad habit, where do you suppose we might find him?<eos> I rented an apartment in Tribeca under the name of the dummy corp.<eos> Yes, I will!

I understand.<eos> But time is running out for us.<eos> I'm sorry but we have to do this soon.<eos> You'll wake up.<eos> You will.
Because I have just as much incentive to figure out who set that fire as you do.<eos> Someone clearly wants to frame me, someone who has waited a long time for me to get out, but would prefer that I stay caged up in that cell.<eos> And you might know who that someone is?<eos> I'm offering my services.<eos> As a... arson investigator... if you will.
There.<eos> Will that convince you?<eos> Convince me again.<eos> And don't say, 'If we ever have any.'<eos> Because we will.
Yeah, that's not gonna happen.<eos> Todd...<eos> Seriously, just-just drop it.<eos> Okay.<eos> I will.
Hello.<eos> I used to live here, you know.<eos> The Lamptons.<eos> Do you remember them?<eos> Your Mum and Dad will.

Steve, what if I were to tell you that you could help bring D.B. Cooper to justice?<eos> What do you mean?<eos> What I mean is, how would you like a job?<eos> And that I will well and faithfully discharge the duties of the office, so help me God.<eos> That I will well...
Have you contacted his wife?<eos> I'm gonna see her tomorrow morning.<eos> She hasn't seen him in over 15 years.<eos> I need to know what happened to him, Bones.<eos> You will, Booth.
What have we here?<eos> Ah, gold.<eos> All this taxed from the poor so that the rich can get richer.<eos> It simply will not do.<eos> Oh, yes, it will.
"Hank, our Missy came home to us with a few broken bones.<eos> We get to live with our daughter.<eos> The monster who left her there has to live with himself."<eos> No.<eos> I won't.

Briggs reportedly escaped during a prison open house, an event that will most likely be canceled in the future.<eos> No, no!<eos> I can't believe it.<eos> Oh, don't worry, Joe, they'll get him back.<eos> No, they won't!
I was a stupid child when I said those things.<eos> Life with you could never be boring.<eos> Blair Cornelia Waldorf, will you marry me?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, I will.
I guess I'll see you in a couple weeks.<eos> Yeah, I'll see you there.<eos> We've all been there.<eos> It usually happens first few months after being on the job.<eos> But you will.
No, we're fine.<eos> Okay, I'll think about it.<eos> Okay.<eos> You will?<eos> I will.
- You were not h... okay.<eos> This is not a punishment, but go upstairs, please.<eos> Victor and I need some alone time to work on this.<eos> I'll do this later.<eos> No, you won't, Victor.
I've planned this out with extreme precision.<eos> Your arrival today has thrown everything off.<eos> It was just four minutes.<eos> I'll tell you what, it won't happen again.<eos> No, it won't.
No.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> We brought the tree all the way down.<eos> It has to look perfect on Christmas morning.<eos> Carlos, it will.

Weird.<eos> So can one of you take me to the library?<eos> I feel like reading about Peru.<eos> No, brick, sorry. Can't.<eos> Actually, won't.
At least it's not mine.<eos> No, it's not mine, either.<eos> Someone is trying to frame us.<eos> I don't know anything about it.<eos> Well, we will soon.
I'll wait.<eos> Don't.<eos> You having any second thoughts about the shooting?<eos> Not really.<eos> You will.

She called me up, and told me the good news!<eos> And she'll call you up, too. Of course she will.<eos> Oh, no.<eos> She won't call me.<eos> Sure she will.
Well, if it gets the people round here what they need, I'm not proud.<eos> I thought I'd won Mr Carne round but he really savaged me tonight, didn't he?<eos> He's the past and you're the future, and he knows it.<eos> He knows things have got to change.<eos> And with this new housing scheme, by God they will!
What help?<eos> Our neighbours are all hiding in their little estates.<eos> They have mass said every day to pray that I'll be enough to satiate the soldiers.<eos> There's not going to be any help.<eos> Yes there will...
But so young.<eos> Where is your master?<eos> He will come for me.<eos> And if he does not?<eos> He will.
Thank you.<eos> So I'll give you a call later.<eos> - OK.<eos> - OK.<eos> I will.
If my husband were sleeping with Mary, she wouldn't be on my guest list.<eos> Jackie puts up with it.<eos> She must figure if it's inevitable, she might as well make it convenient.<eos> Mrs. Kennedy, will the President be returning?<eos> No, he won't.
Yeah, well. Let's just see who they call, shall we?<eos> All this just to find Andy Dixon?<eos> - He was there.<eos> - What if he's got nothing to say?<eos> Oh, he will.

To do what?<eos> To authorize a surveillance package.<eos> To tap his phones, wire his house, follow him wherever he goes.<eos> David will never sign off on that and you know it.<eos> Of course he won't.

Um, see, the thing is, a friend really screwed me over and...<eos> And I was supposed to take my senior year off and motorcycle through South America, but some skinny Beverly Hills brat told my parents I was growing pot, so, uh...<eos> I'm going to need the place more than you.<eos> So I guess we're just going to have to see who gets it.<eos> Hmm, yeah, we will.

I've never met you.<eos> So I'm asking you to leave, all right? She's drunk, I'm taking her right now.<eos> No, you need to go right now.<eos> - Just--don't touch me.<eos> - No, now I will.
So it's a lie.<eos> Of course it's a lie.<eos> But it doesn't matter, because everyone believes it and now I've been branded a slut.<eos> I know it feels like the end of the world, but it's a rumour and it'll pass.<eos> No it won't.
I spent the entire night debauching myself through acts I never thought I would be capable of.<eos> I had to choke down my inherent morality and remind myself that I was doing it for the greater good, although I did catch myself having some fun at Charlie Sheen's place.<eos> You know, he's nice, and he parties hard.<eos> By morning, I was confident I had rendered my soul totally worthless.<eos> A reverse grinching, if you will.
Now it's our turn.<eos> Who will cover us?<eos> Don't be a simpleton, Merlin.<eos> They haven't found the cargo.<eos> They will.

Let alone use it.<eos> So it is not something to be afraid of,<eos> It is if you have Uther as your guardian.<eos> If he found out, he'd have me killed.<eos> You won't.
So, if you want to be a singer , You have to go !<eos> Who do you feel is in here ?<eos> Go to your cousin in Milan , from my son .<eos> . Do you know how many possibilities are there?<eos> . No, uncle , I will not .
It won't stop.<eos> That didn't work.<eos> Go on, then. Drive it out.<eos> It won't drive out.<eos> It just won't.
Almost got me.<eos> Almost got me, Douglas.<eos> We'll get him next time, won't we?<eos> Yes. Yes, we will.<eos> We will.
Yes, Bubu and I will marry.<eos> -But ...<eos> -No, but no.<eos> I love her and we married.<eos> Yes, we will.
Mmm-mm.<eos> How's aggressive workin' for ya?<eos> Shut up.<eos> - No one's talking.<eos> - No, they won't.
I love it. Absolutely the...<eos> You know what?<eos> The night was so great, This makes this even harder to say.<eos> - Can you not get that?<eos> - I will not.
- And stay with me.<eos> - And marry you?<eos> - And marry me.<eos> Wilt thou have this woman to thy wedded wife? To live together after God's ordinance, - in the holiest state of matrimony?<eos> - I will.
If you give me just a little wider smile.<eos> Oh, shut up, Harvey.<eos> So how's this going to work, Mr. Shine?<eos> I have absolutely no idea.<eos> But it will.
I'm sorry.<eos> I just can't be around her when she's gone like that.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I know she may end up dying lighting herself on fire with a lit cigarette but I can't.<eos> I won't.
- I saw that.<eos> Oh, man.<eos> We've been living in perfect marital bliss for three weeks.<eos> I don't want to lose what we have here.<eos> Then we won't.
You can never lose control in a hostile environment, whether that's a television studio or a battlefield.<eos> Understood?<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> It won't happen again, sir.<eos> No, it won't.
- That's true, you did.<eos> - Well?<eos> Well, I do what I want.<eos> - I don't want to talk about it.<eos> - Then I will.
So your dad's got the big "C," huh?<eos> Sorry to hear about that.<eos> Yeah, well, it's just in his colon.<eos> - No big deal, he'll get better.<eos> - Yeah. Sure he will.
There you go.<eos> Now, you just wait till she comes back though.<eos> She's not gonna come back, Grandma.<eos> Well, we'll see.<eos> Yeah, we will.
Where's Walter?<eos> - At home.<eos> Things can't go on like this.<eos> Something has to happen.<eos> Something will... everywhere.
Should have failed her a few more times.<eos> Should have known.<eos> Adieu, Agent Walker.<eos> It was a real pleasure, Agent Montgomery.<eos> Well, I'll, um...
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, it's barely morning.<eos> Just hold up.<eos> I know you're excited, your adrenaline is rushing and your heart rate is pumping just like you got a big case and this is a hot crime scene.<eos> Dad, I just want to see what Santa brought me.<eos> And you will soon enough.
Including appearing in court?<eos> And managing client relations, yes.<eos> OK, then, welcome to the case.<eos> Mr. Michael will appreciate having a senior partner on his team.<eos> - As will Molly, sir. - Who?
Everyone needs secretaries.<eos> Soon as I'm earning, we'll get a proper place.<eos> Just you wait, Mum.<eos> - What if it never gets better?<eos> - Of course it will.
Sure, be right down, boss.<eos> Abby's lab.<eos> I've barely had a chance to finish unpacking this stuff, let alone processing it.<eos> I don't have anything for you.<eos> - You will.
This is first-degree murder.<eos> That is life in prison. I will never survive that.<eos> Josef already has a lawyer working on your bail.<eos> It won't come to that.<eos> No, it won't.
Cos you are just their bitch.<eos> - Lenny's gonna go mad!<eos> - Screw Lenny.<eos> - What if he finds out you're keeping him alive?<eos> - He won't.
I'm guessing that's our girl.<eos> All right, Ronnie, nice work.<eos> Come on down.<eos> Kick down the door, go in guns drawn, badges out, noelle's gonna know it was the police to the rescue.<eos> And so will her big pa.
Martha, you don't know what you're doing.<eos> I won't!<eos> Martha, come back here.<eos> Do as I'm telling you!<eos> I won't!
You like boys or girls?<eos> Girls, dawg.<eos> Girls?<eos> Go with my friend.<eos> You'll like.
- he knows what he's doing.<eos> I could keep asking them.<eos> I can keep asking them and asking them, but the thing is, is that... they are never gonna let you have that heart.<eos> Yes.<eos> No, no. Yes, they will.
-You didn't knowabout the alzheimer'S.<eos> -Sam,I promised her.<eos> When she dies,she dies in my arms--not with strangers,in my arms.<eos> She's the love of my life.<eos> I will not putthe love of my life... in a home.
All I have is the financial aid.<eos> How am I supposed to do this after the baby's born?<eos> I wanna go to law school.<eos> You know, I wanna have a life.<eos> You will.
Take it!<eos> Stop it!<eos> We'd kill each other for nothing.<eos> please understand, Miss Kotono.<eos> No, I won't !
Why shouldn't you?<eos> Can you... imagine what their lives will be like now?<eos> How scared and lonely they'll be?<eos> But... whatever happens, I'd rather live.<eos> Perhaps you will.
Che? He say 'e don't think you got no money.<eos> Money, si, si, sens'altro!<eos> Yes!<eos> Yes! You got it now, but will you have it when rent day comes?<eos> Yes, he will, Mr Pancks.
-I came from Blönduós.<eos> No...when are you due? -Oh.<eos> I'm such a mongo.<eos> They'll come in 2 weeks.<eos> -Who will?
I know.<eos> Like you always will be my son.<eos> Forgive me, please forgive me.<eos> - I think you should go.<eos> - Yes, I will.
Me, of course!<eos> For spring!<eos> Oh, of course.<eos> You'll prove it, huh?<eos> Yes, I will.
Patience.<eos> - Now ?<eos> - Patience.<eos> - I'll just go to my dorm.<eos> - No, you won't.
Who?<eos> The Greeks.<eos> Dimitri left them a copy of the map before we left.<eos> Yeah, and what if they decide not to come, Jeff?<eos> Then somebody else will.
Il-yeong!<eos> That's it!<eos> Attack me once more!<eos> No!<eos> I won't!
Something in the universe loves the entity that is me.<eos> I will choose to call this something "God".<eos> A singular spark that dwells in the soul of every living being.<eos> If you look inside yourself, you will find this spark too.<eos> You will.
What if it's them?<eos> I'm not an expert, but I don't think scarecrows knock.<eos> I brought you this.<eos> Hold it.<eos> - I won't.
- For the King, I kill.<eos> - The King's finished.<eos> The Sheriff, Prince John and the Black Knights, they'll win.<eos> Robin...<eos> Not today, they won't.
I mean, he was trying to kill us.<eos> We can't prove that.<eos> This is bad, Gaby .<eos> Oh, when people find out we were on that boat with him, it...<eos> Maybe they won't.
So think about it.<eos> My offer's still good.<eos> My interview is on wednesday.<eos> I haven't even gotten the job yet.<eos> You will.
- Yeah, well, I hope you're right.<eos> - I know I'm right.<eos> - Well, I hope so.<eos> Time will tell.<eos> Yes. It will.
# But think that now you're engaged #<eos> # We're drifting apart #<eos> # And who am I to say #<eos> # That love will last?<eos> # # It won't or it will #
I am one of them, honey.<eos> I'm glad that the flight was canceled, so now I can tell you I want you to go.<eos> I don't want to go without you and I love you.<eos> Now will you go?<eos> No, Ari, I won't.
Studio 60 is a restaurant with a good location.<eos> Give him a couple of days-- he'll come back.<eos> No, he won't.<eos> Danny.<eos> No, he won't.
Do you remember Dr. Suresh?<eos> He is working really hard to find me a cure.<eos> And when he does, I'll get better.<eos> Yeah, but what if he doesn't?<eos> He will.
Damn it, her DNA's already programmed in the system.<eos> She reprogrammed the coordinates.<eos> She could be anywhere now.<eos> She'll be found.<eos> No, she won't.
Let's not forget about the beautiful flowers.<eos> One of which is already dead.<eos> Honey, I just want to be able to move on from this<eos> - knowing it's not gona happen again.<eos> - It won't.
No, you weren't. You couldn't be.<eos> There's a reason we have rules.<eos> If every doctor did whatever his gut told him was right, we'd have a lot more dead bodies to deal with.<eos> It won't happen again.<eos> Yes, it will.
YOU GOT A JOB?<eos> SORTA.<eos> THE LINE BETWEEN "SORTA" AND "YES" DON'T MEET IN THE MIDDLE.<eos> DO YOU HAVE A JOB?<eos> I WILL.
SORTA.<eos> THE LINE BETWEEN "SORTA" AND "YES" DON'T MEET IN THE MIDDLE.<eos> DO YOU HAVE A JOB?<eos> I WILL.<eos> SHE WILL.
Let me check one moment.<eos> This is so slow.<eos> Is he going to show up?<eos> Of course.<eos> Of course he will.
Who will go $400?<eos> Thank you. I have $400.<eos> Do I have $500?<eos> $500?<eos> $500, who will.
You know, they're frakking machines.<eos> Shoot one down, they just build more.<eos> Still in school.<eos> Never thought I'd get out here in time to get a shot at them.<eos> You will.
There's a prophesy about that child, Mr. Scoresby.<eos> She will decide the war which is to come.<eos> War?<eos> I ain't heard rumor of any war.<eos> You will.
Wait till Dad sees you.<eos> Sees me?<eos> He never notices what I wear.<eos> In 20 years, he's never even said to me, "nice muumuu" or nothin'.<eos> Now he will.
$400.<eos> Stupidity.<eos> Then nine years later they come back.<eos> I got a feeling I'm coming back too.<eos> Yes, you will.
Of course not.<eos> Why?<eos> Why do you need to do this?<eos> Why?<eos> Because nobody else will.
- He will.<eos> - And if he doesn't?<eos> - He will,Jess.<eos> - What if my dad doesn't find us?<eos> - Goddamn it, he will!
Well, I don't know what that is.<eos> - But, Charlie.<eos> - Yes, sir.<eos> If I see one fucking Star of David on a crate...<eos> You won't.
- What?<eos> It's still recording.<eos> This is all set.<eos> You'll never get it through the door.<eos> Sure I will.
My backlog of open cases doesn't mitigate the fact... that your client tried to kill his brother-in-law.<eos> A golfing accident.<eos> Phil... your client owns one golf club, no golf balls... and the accident happened in a stairwell... of an after-hours, illegal gambling hall.<eos> I'll see you in court.<eos> Well, I won't, but someone from this office will.
I wanna help ya.<eos> I can get you sleeves on all Manning's people, the ones that hurt Monroe.<eos> The ones that killed his family.<eos> The law failed him.<eos> We won't.
He'll not be coming back, will he?<eos> I think he's meant to be on his own, dear.<eos> Not Crusoe. I meant Daddy.<eos> No, love.<eos> He'll not.
Am I clear?<eos> I tell you the truth, it is you who don't believe me!<eos> - Tell me which one is the true truth!<eos> Tell it to me!<eos> - Sure I will.
But before doing that, I forced myself to stop seeing her.<eos> Soon enough, I realised the excitement existed only in myself.<eos> It was my need to feel.<eos> You suffer, because you think the pain of losing her will never pass...<eos> But it will, Son.
An assault on who?<eos> Assad.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> We don't even know where Assad is.<eos> We will.
Just go with the detective.<eos> Answer his questions.<eos> Don't panic.<eos> - What if those men call?<eos> - They won't.
The transport buses are starting to arrive.<eos> Good.<eos> By the time my jailed brothers are boarded on the aircraft, it will be too late for the Americans to realize what's happened.<eos> We still don't have the component.<eos> We will.
She wanted to ruin me.<eos> She said so.<eos> I lost control of my temper For one second,that's all.<eos> I wonder if the police Will see it the same way,john.<eos> No,we won't.
- I was just about to.<eos> - Lorelai.<eos> Grayson's only needs a 2-hour heads up.<eos> At least do you have a program for me to approve?<eos> Uh, not yet, but I will.
I am giving these to you in pristine condition, and I expect that that is how they will be returned.<eos> Do not cut them up or put glue on the back.<eos> I will do my best.<eos> I will return them in the condition in which they were received. See you at the shower.<eos> Oh, no, you won't.
As you expected, she didn't... appreciate my thoughts on La Grenouille.<eos> She still thinks of him as a prime suspect.<eos> - So do I.<eos> - Yes, but you listen to my perspective, and I have no doubt that your mind would change if the facts were to change.<eos> And the Director's won't?
Then I suggest you beat the bomb squad to the entrance and human-wrecking-ball your way in before anyone can see you.<eos> Perfect timing,macgyver.<eos> You're gonna need those pawsto call wes.<eos> The phones won't work this deep in the tunnel system.<eos> Mine will.
Lily is gonna kill me!<eos> Look at me!<eos> She's not gonna want to marry me like this.<eos> That's crazy.<eos> Of course she will.
Principal Turner.<eos> Look, if you suspend her, I think you're really making a big mistake.<eos> I'm sorry, I don't mean to barge in like this but... Shut up.<eos> Chase, I love you for this, really, but, shut up.<eos> We'll...
- I gotta see the movie.<eos> - Not gonna happen.<eos> Walsh won't even let Rubinstein see it.<eos> He understands that at some point everyone's gonna see it, right?<eos> At some point, everyone will.
First of all, 8 years are 8 years while "forever" means a prison, second thing, don't mention the situation with my family!<eos> They are still waiting for the only one satisfaction of their life:<eos> Have an educated son.<eos> I am going to break up with you, you'll see!<eos> Soon or later I will.
- Fine, where's your car?<eos> - I don't have a car.<eos> Is it ok for you...?<eos> - Will you take me to the seaside?<eos> - Yes, I will!
I'm what they call "working deep cover."<eos> That's why, like I said, - You gotta keep the secret.<eos> - I won't tell.<eos> - You better not!<eos> - I won't!
- Tugce, Captain found Gokmen.<eos> He says we'll be here just a little longer<eos> - Don't you worry about us.<eos> We'll see you soon.<eos> Of course we will.
It's not.<eos> Want to get a CT scan at our hospital?<eos> I'm fine.<eos> Be careful. Something might happen again.<eos> It won't.
I'm gonna get an x-ray of my whole body.<eos> Maia's it!<eos> Maia's it!<eos> - I'm gonna get you, Amy!<eos> - No, you won't.
- What's that?<eos> - Job applications.<eos> - You already have a job.<eos> - Yes,I do.<eos> Soon,you will,too.
I thought you were my friend!<eos> I am.<eos> What... the fuck is...?<eos> You know when the doctor says it won't hurt?<eos> Well, this will.
It's not.<eos> I mean, I thought that it was, but this is not about her.<eos> This is about me.<eos> I love you, Lucas.<eos> And I probably always will.
Victory hangs in the balance.<eos> But they're wrong.<eos> - The battle goes on without them.<eos> - My brother, he could die without me.<eos> Maybe he will. Maybe he won't.
Mr. Magoo?<eos> Oh, gosh, he was a great man.<eos> Um...an inventor.<eos> Really?<eos> An entrepreneur, if you will.
It's there.<eos> Now we just need to find a fetal heartbeat.<eos> You see it?<eos> Now they just have to find the heartbeat.<eos> They will.
At what point will an Aluminum transport tank bleve And what does that stand for?<eos> Bleve.<eos> That's boiling liquid expansion Vapor explode and aluminum<eos> Bleves it... it won't.<eos> Steel will.
Just so you know...<eos> I'm not really into the whole bondage thing.<eos> Well, I hope we get a second date.<eos> I really do.<eos> We will.
No, because I know the pendant.<eos> Well, you're wrong.<eos> Because I will.<eos> Yeah.<eos> But you won't.
Let's start from the beginning.<eos> We're two strangers in a hotel room.<eos> Who goes first?<eos> - First at what?<eos> -Then I will.
It's called sensory depravation.<eos> It's not going to work !<eos> You hear me, you son of a bitch ? !<eos> It's not going to work !<eos> Yes, it will.
They put the Saint on the trawler and then take her around... so she blesses the whole sea.<eos> It's a great celebration.<eos> My father always used to take me.<eos> Will you take me too?<eos> Course I will, in spring.
--He says no.<eos> --Oh, no one's going to believe him.<eos> They're out for blood.<eos> He's not going to get a fair shake.<eos> Yes, he will.
But they've been finding some damn strange stuff... down in that hole... in the last couple of weeks.<eos> Carvings and such.<eos> I think... something came out of that mine.<eos> Something that... never died.<eos> And never will.
Don't do this to me.<eos> Tristan, we've made shore.<eos> What if she's a hag?<eos> Or she simply won't have me?<eos> She will, Brother.
You see... I have waited a long time to prove myself.<eos> And I've been given the opportunity of a lifetime.<eos> And I intend to show the world exactly who I am... and what I can do.<eos> I must not fail.<eos> You won't.
- You have to go in the car-<eos> - I will not go in the car seat!<eos> Yes, you will!<eos> - You will go in the car seat.<eos> - No, I won't!
Finish it.<eos> Finish it.<eos> - I don't know how it ends.<eos> - You do.<eos> You will.
Will you deliver Spain from bondage?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I'm trying. I don't know how.<eos> You do.<eos> You will.
I'm trying. I don't know how.<eos> You do.<eos> You will.<eos> You do.<eos> You will.
Fine.<eos> All right, well, you know I won't give up.<eos> I'm not the woman that just walks away.<eos> Now, I will find out the truth.<eos> I will.
Congratulations.<eos> I'm really proud of you.<eos> But?<eos> But I thought we was gonna start a family.<eos> We will, baby.
What injections have they been giving her?<eos> You'll have to ask the doctor.<eos> They give her what she needs.<eos> I'll ask right now!<eos> I will!
And based on your information, I then threw her out.<eos> - Did she commit suicide?<eos> - No. It was surely murder.<eos> - Do you have a suspect?<eos> - We will soon, Your Highness.
I think I forgot to sign that.<eos> Ask me about it again tomorrow.<eos> Congratulations, Rawlings.<eos> And don't ever do that again.<eos> I won't, sir.
What happens if he gets hurt?<eos> What if he's killed? Could you live with that, Mrs. Jones?<eos> I worked for Ian Rider nine years.<eos> I didn't know about any of this. But I warn you, if anything happens to Alex...<eos> It won't.
Mom!<eos> One more stretcher over here.<eos> It's just her.<eos> Is she gonna make it?<eos> Yeah, she will.
But, to them, you'll become a legend.<eos> The one who gave his life for them.<eos> How about you let her go, and I let you live out your life?<eos> How about I make you my "weyotch"?<eos> I'll never will you my power.
- Sorry.<eos> - It's all right.<eos> Look, aside from forgiving all of Pip's awful faults, what exactly would you like to do for the rest of your life?<eos> Oh, you'd laugh.<eos> No, I won't.
But I couldn't get my feet to move.<eos> It was dark in there.<eos> And the music was loud, but I saw his face.<eos> And I recognized his voice as clear as day.<eos> And so would all of you.
He's, uh, Pa?<eos> Little House on the Prairie?<eos> - Never watched that. - Mmm.<eos> People also tell me I look like Rachel Maddow, which I take as a huge compliment.<eos> I would.
And thoughtful.<eos> The kind of person you see and think,<eos> "I just wanna be around you."<eos> Maybe I'd like him.<eos> Yeah, maybe you would.
I don't think I can take this.<eos> That guy hits really hard.<eos> Do you have any, uh, any, like, cyanide or ...<eos> - Cyanide?<eos> Why would I ...
Princess.<eos> What a coincidence, that is my favorite game.<eos> Except, when I do it, it is called Playing Queen.<eos> Would you like to play Queen with me?<eos> I would, very much.
You could dispel them.<eos> Well, what if Meg came back?<eos> Do you have information about where she is?<eos> No, I just... I just thought it might help.<eos> Of course it would.
Yeah, the old guy? The guy that would never suggest we wait?<eos> Yeah. If you're him tomorrow, I'm gonna hate myself.<eos> I would, too.<eos> Except I'd be him.<eos> So, I wouldn't.
You know, we did meet once before, Mr. President.<eos> At a dinner, during the 2012 convention.<eos> - I tried to introduce myself to you...<eos> - You don't remember, do you?<eos> - Why would I?
I don't wanna be a dick about it.<eos> I don't care.<eos> It's fine.<eos> You don't care that your girlfriend left you for this genius?<eos> I would.
Care about people's problems so much?<eos> A lot of the people here were customers in my shop.<eos> So that means that if I were selling the right thing at my store, they'd all want to talk to me?<eos> It certainly would get you noticed more.<eos> Yes, it would.
America's number one doggy daddy.<eos> Would you care to do the honors?<eos> Would I!<eos> Uh, that's what I asked.<eos> Would you?
Alright, look.<eos> We faked it because it's real, okay.<eos> There really is something happening here, guys, in these woods.<eos> - And that make sense to you?<eos> - Everyone would.
Okay, you don't have to defend me.<eos> You're such a loser.<eos> I'm sorry, what did he say?<eos> What?<eos> - Well, I would...
You're wasting your time.<eos> There's no power.<eos> I don't get it.<eos> Why go to the bother of bringing it in when you can't turn it on?<eos> They wouldn't.
- Oh no?<eos> - No.<eos> I was eighteen and it was the Marines.<eos> And I would made a damn fine one too.<eos> Of course you would.
- Yeah, and he's gonna kill your parents.<eos> - Like he said, it's a choice.<eos> Us or them.<eos> They would want us to save ourselves.<eos> Wouldn't your parents?
Dr. hale?<eos> Is he not on the floor?<eos> I don't know where to find him.<eos> No, you wouldn't.<eos> But alas, I would.
And then there's your jig.<eos> - Leonard, yeah.<eos> - Yeah, that's right.<eos> So we--we'd like to-- I'd like to deal quickly.<eos> Of course. Yeah, of course you would.
Is... is that a tiara or a crown?<eos> You don't like it?<eos> No, I do! - You know, I would!<eos> - You would?<eos> - I would! Of Course!
No, I'm not.<eos> - Yeah, you are.<eos> - No...<eos> Not just anybody would have sent me that letter.<eos> - Sure they would. - No.
Yeah, I kind of like it here.<eos> Kevin Whitfield's condolence book.<eos> Hey, you don't have mine, do you?<eos> I'd like to see who came to my funeral.<eos> No, you wouldn't.
- Excuse me.<eos> Lieutenant, I think you took some photos out of the murder book before you gave it to me.<eos> And I'd like them back.<eos> No.<eos> You wouldn't.
Oh, lost a few pounds.<eos> I mean, you look different than you did when you were standing over here.<eos> There's something weird about the light.<eos> Aside from the fact it casts a cooler hue, you'd never know there's a tiny little spy camera in there.<eos> Yes, I would.
I am gonna spend so much time with you.<eos> Except for tomorrow.<eos> I have to work a double shift.<eos> Would you mind watching him for me?<eos> Absolutely I would.
I asked her to be my first lady.<eos> Um... wow. Where did, uh, where did this come from?<eos> I'm in love with her, as it turns out.<eos> You'd probably feel the same thing if you weren't married.<eos> Anyone would.
Jeez, since when are you the buzzkill? I thought that was Dana.<eos> Yeah, that was really out of character, Matt.<eos> Maybe I'm a shapeshifter.<eos> You are not. I'd know for sure.<eos> Dana wouldn't.
And to think I didn't even want to hire you.<eos> The one time I don't have my hanky.<eos> You want to... Watch TV?<eos> - Just for a few minutes?<eos> - Yeah, sure, I would.
There'll be no alcohol, but you can have fun without it.<eos> Umm, Patty and I aren't going this week.<eos> We're going to see a movie instead.<eos> Well, I'm sure Dolores would enjoy a movie just as well.<eos> I would, very much.
- I don't really want to say in front of everyone... think I might jinx it, so...<eos> I can't! I'm sorry.<eos> Then don't.<eos> Look, maybe what we do is...<eos> God! It really would, though.
We could start our new lives together and live here as a couple.<eos> We could get matching robes that say "Hers" and "Hers."<eos> I could finally wear all those vests that I love.<eos> You'd probably miss your stupid husband, though, right?<eos> Yeah, I would.
I was practically in love with her.<eos> In love... you loved her?<eos> I mean, we had this affair with each other when she first started working for me.<eos> It just didn't last very long, and it was obviously highly unprofessional.<eos> And I wouldn't...
I mean, what the hell is he thinking with this?<eos> I really... h-h-he's, you know, a free spirit.<eos> Yeah, that's one way to put it.<eos> You two are still friends, right?<eos> - I wouldn't exactly...
Then you get sick.<eos> I can't imagine that turned her into Florence Nightingale all of a sudden.<eos> Leo, I'm married.<eos> I get it.<eos> Any man would.
Is that Danish?<eos> Is that like Swedish?<eos> Wouldn't you like to know?<eos> Yes, Jornatha.<eos> I would.
You here to talk about Anderton Software?<eos> Because your 24-hour Liberty Rail pass is up.<eos> Then I guess it's a good thing that just came in the mail for me.<eos> Maintenance records showing they replaced the heat sensors on all of their trains within six weeks after the derailment. Now, why would they do that if they never failed a safety test?<eos> They wouldn't.
Gonna do something for your, uh... for your deal, I guess.<eos> That's nice.<eos> Just her way.<eos> I'd like to help finish the kitchen before I leave, Ted.<eos> I really would.
Okay.<eos> Sorry. And to be a single mother...<eos> It's no cakewalk, but I would help you.<eos> Everyone says that.<eos> But I would.
Deep Web user?<eos> What was their handle?<eos> I don't remember that kind of thing.<eos> I would tell you if I did.<eos> I would.
- What am I to tell people?<eos> President's in town?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> You think they'll believe you?<eos> - No, Joe. They wouldn't.
We broke up.<eos> Turns out it's really hard to maintain the intensity that you get with Internet communication.<eos> You wouldn't know what I'm talking about there.<eos> - It's a whole new thing.<eos> - Actually, I would.
Well, when Dr. Isles ran your victim's prints, it alerted us.<eos> The victim's on an international criminal database, so we've been after him for a while.<eos> - Great.<eos> - Name's Yuri Yevtushok, though he has a lot of aliases.<eos> I would, too.
Uh, well, it's off... in theory.<eos> In theory?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Would you like to go?<eos> I would...
What's happening?<eos> I have issues.<eos> What kind of issues?<eos> If I told you, you wouldn't like me.<eos> Nobody would.
He's still feeling the effects.<eos> Okay.<eos> Miss Saltire, would the prosecution consider accepting some sort of compromise, pleading this down to violation?<eos> It would go on his record.<eos> My client would not, not under any circumstances.
Are you sure about that?" "Oh, let's try it." "Okay."<eos> When he was given boring, traditional recipes, you can't change them because the recipe says like this. He didn't like that at all because he was...<eos> It was choking him and you could see it, it was choking him.<eos> The people who went to school with him, they say,<eos> "Oh, Magnus, I wouldn't...
Cal.<eos> Hey, man, I-- she's just really worried about me.<eos> Cal, I swear.<eos> I swear, man. I would never hurt--<eos> I would never--
I believe I have the support of my whole team.<eos> But you had a personal relationship with Detective Flynn, correct?<eos> That was a long time ago.<eos> So, you wouldn't say she enjoys special consideration, even, uh, unintentionally?<eos> No, I wouldn't.
This is the guy.<eos> - Come on, Castle.<eos> - No, this is the guy.<eos> That guy looks nothing like Chuck Norris.<eos> He would with a beard.
Okay. Um, it's like if... if you, Ms. Nixon, were to call Mr. Travis fat.<eos> I-I don't think anyone...<eos> did you just call me fat?<eos> No.<eos> No! No, no, I would never...
I had a future, and it didn't involve, chainsaws, and shotguns, and demons, and I just wanna, I wanna see if I can find that guy again.<eos> Do you think you could help me?<eos> I don't know. Maybe?<eos> I'd like that, Amanda.<eos> I really would.
I wouldn't count on that.<eos> Yeah, it's okay.<eos> Where is it?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Then who would?
But... I don't think that it would be a good idea.<eos> Look, I-I know we're on a time-out right now a-and...<eos> But tomorrow's our anniversary, and I just can't bear the thought of spending it without you.<eos> I would love to.<eos> I really would.
He's putting out feelers.<eos> If you could go to his house for the holiday...<eos> I mean, would I like to go to the Chan's?<eos> Would I like to be surrounded by the unconditional love of a hundred Filipinos?<eos> Of course I would.
[ Snaps fingers ] This next exercise will teach us how to communicate our needs in a constructive and non-threatening manner.<eos> We do that all the time.<eos> Very constructively communicated.<eos> Would one of my couples like to help me demonstrate for the rest of the group?<eos> Yes, we would.
Yeah, well, didn't have the hair for disco.<eos> - What about you?<eos> - Yeah, love it.<eos> - Really?<eos> - Who wouldn't!
A woman lives there too, but you wouldn't think so.<eos> First of all, you are a man of God. You should be a model to your community.<eos> Shouldn't you be neat and tidy?<eos> Who is he? Do I know him?<eos> No, you wouldn't.
No, women.<eos> But I'm talking about my teenage daughter. And I'm not trying to tell you what to wear or anything.<eos> I'm just trying to understand it.<eos> Well, who told you you had to understand?<eos> Why would you?
Dude, I'm kidding.<eos> Of course you are.<eos> So what... what makes your blow jobs so killer?<eos> Well, wouldn't you like to know?<eos> - I would, yeah.
- She was great.<eos> Firm.<eos> - Good.<eos> You really didn't watch?<eos> Why would I?
No doubt, a little part of him was relieved when the baby was gone and he didn't have to marry.<eos> You were never meant for marriage, Aramis.<eos> That was clear even then.<eos> You wouldn't have been happy.<eos> With you, I would.
Who knew that was an option?<eos> Well, thanks for stopping by.<eos> Is Mr. Spence here?<eos> - I'd like to see him, too.<eos> - Of course you would. But...
I'm not even sure a doctor could help with this.<eos> I was thinking maybe your blood.<eos> The reverend told me not to give you any more blood.<eos> I don't care what he said.<eos> He wouldn't either.
Shh. I'm a cop and I smell the pot.<eos> Do not shush me, Willie Nelson.<eos> Mike, unless you can sit here like a grown-up and not complain constantly, go wait in the lobby.<eos> You'd like that.<eos> Yeah, we all would.
Right?<eos> They look like they're actually worried that the rhythm is gonna get them.<eos> It's nice to talk to someone who's as confused about this stuff as I am.<eos> If you and I got together, we'd never break up, would we?<eos> No, we wouldn't, Reggie.
- Julie.<eos> - He's a good doctor.<eos> You know me, okay?<eos> You know that I would never let anything hurt Rosemary ever.<eos> What, and I would?
Oh, my God, he's totally a Shane.<eos> So let me bounce this off you - guys...<eos> - What say we don't launch this giant nerve gas missile at, uh... where did you say you were launching it?<eos> Wouldn't you like to know?<eos> I would, actually.
And the truth is, things are looking pretty bleak at the office for the man you see before you...<eos> Myron.<eos> Um, well, would you like to come in and watch "Showgirls"?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, I would.
Hmm. I could improvise a device.<eos> I could have James Balfour's clock-making tools repurposed.<eos> You'd open my skull with clockmaker's tools?<eos> If you'd have me do so.<eos> I most certainly would not.
I was trying to protect her.<eos> But she didn't want your protection, did she?<eos> She was always very honest.<eos> You know, she said I'd pay for it.<eos> That we all would.
What I wanted... to say to you... is that nobody should have to go through what you went through.<eos> Nobody.<eos> And if that guy shows up here again, I'd say it to his face.<eos> I'd like to see that.<eos> I really would.
But that rang hollow.<eos> You're a pal.<eos> So you think that Stahma...<eos> She wouldn't dare.<eos> No, she wouldn't.
- Anyway, he says that you have to get Luke to sign his rights away before the adoption can go forward.<eos> How could I do that?<eos> Luke's dead-set against it. Hmm.<eos> Would you mind if I talked to him?<eos> Yes, I would.
20 years ago.<eos> Belonged to Chuck Thomson... the, uh... flight school pilot that crashed the day the dome fell.<eos> Looks like it's been sitting around a while.<eos> Does it fly?<eos> It'd better.
Uh, actually, that's go-kart fumes, and you'd know that if you would ever employee appreciate us every once in a while.<eos> All we want is an entire day where you thank us with go-karts and maybe a cotton candy machine and may... I was thinking maybe, like, the goo goo dolls could perform, and I could sing Iris with them onstage.<eos> - Yeah. - Personally,<eos> I don't want the world to see me, 'cause I don't think they'd understand.<eos> They wouldn't.
Look for a corrugated garage door and then see if you can spot the van.<eos> Bennie, get rid of these four.<eos> I wouldn't do that if I were you.<eos> I'm just saying...<eos> I wouldn't.
Somebody. I don't know, I can't remember.<eos> Well, who were you with?<eos> -Well, you wouldn't know 'em.<eos> -Try me.<eos> Well, you would.
He was naked in front of children.<eos> No. My husband.<eos> Bow, we got to do something.<eos> And I'm sure even Dre would admit that he acted like an idiot.<eos> - Would, Dre?
- You're reading?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Yeah, with the dog and the night-time and the curiosity and, like, the incident and the dog of it all.<eos> I'd love to talk way more about it sometime.<eos> - You would?
Whoa, you know what this is, Dana?<eos> This is a big none of your business.<eos> Stop snooping.<eos> Except, I mean, this is probably a present for me, so future Dana technically already owns this, and she wouldn't mind if I take a peek. Would you, future Dana?<eos> [Robotic voice] No, I wouldn't.
His bedtime nuggets, of course.<eos> I completely forgot.<eos> Hey, Kevin, would you like some bedtime nuggets?<eos> - You know what?<eos> - I would.
How could you let her do this to me, Finch... tranq me like I'm some kind of animal?<eos> It was for your own good, Ms. Shaw.<eos> You are no longer safe from Samaritan's gaze, and you wouldn't listen to reason.<eos> He's right, Sam.<eos> You really wouldn't.
What's wrong with you?<eos> RYAN:<eos> Come on, man. How many people outside of the mafia ever get to swear Omerta?<eos> I think it is an experience of a lifetime.<eos> Of course you would.
Santa thinks that will be a mouthful to say every time you want to get Santa's attention.<eos> Fine.<eos> Nick, I'll go with Nick.<eos> Santa does not understand why Colonel Baird hates Christmas.<eos> The real Santa would.
I don't trust people who don't drink.<eos> Have a cigarette.<eos> you're okay?<eos> João still loves to smoke.<eos> He would.
Is it because Jewel's mother is a horse, Darl?<eos> Is that why he went away?<eos> That's part of it.<eos> Hey, Cash, you want me to tighten this?<eos> If you just would.
Fan of Baja, California, huh, Lloyd?<eos> Oh, uh, yes, well, um, I'm a bit of a geography nut.<eos> With this new phone, I can dial up maps from all over the world.<eos> Uh, would you like to see Swedish Lapland?<eos> - Boy, would I?
- Did you do something to her? - No.<eos> Why didn't she like you?<eos> She thought there was something between us.<eos> She thought that?<eos> Why would she?
She's a fine woman.<eos> In what way?<eos> Every way.<eos> You like her?<eos> What man wouldn't?
I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> You burned me with your cigarette.<eos> Does that sound like something a man would do to his little girl?<eos> I don't believe it.<eos> No one else would either.
Well, her new boyfriend.<eos> She said...<eos> Well, she reckons it might for be the best.<eos> In case it causes arguments.<eos> Which it would, so...
34-22-34.<eos> Show him.<eos> Mrs. Spears, how long have you been a resident here?<eos> 44-44-44, wouldn't you say?<eos> -I wouldn't, no.
Sancorp does not want a pro-nuclear businessman in the White House.<eos> The market is shifting toward natural gas anyway.<eos> But Tusk wants to stall that shift or reverse it.<eos> Vice President doesn't have that kind of influence.<eos> This one would.
Whatever your pride dictates, I shan't hold it against you.<eos> You know I'm not staying, right?<eos> What?<eos> And continue your journey to profound professional satisfaction?<eos> Why would you?
What did she say to you?<eos> Miss Claudette?<eos> No, Alex.<eos> Wouldn't you like to know?<eos> Yes, I would.
But the point is you could believe in God.<eos> But I don't.<eos> Yes, but if Jesus were to show up in your office right now, you'd believe in him, wouldn't you?<eos> - No.<eos> - Yes, you would.
They're pure sophistry.<eos> Large groups of people cannot keep secrets.<eos> My hobby is conspiracy theorists.<eos> I adore them.<eos> As one would a barmy uncle.
I'm afraid you're wasting your time.<eos> I can't help you.<eos> All you boys can do now is make things worse for yourselves.<eos> If I were you, I'd drop my gun, lay down on my tummy, and put my hands behind my head.<eos> - You would?
What about Jane?<eos> I don't think he has anything.<eos> But he'd tell you if he did.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, he would. Okay.
What, then?<eos> Say, imagine, we might, you and I, walk into a chophouse on the Commercial Road and in that chophouse we... lay our hands up on the shoulder of the man the world made The Ripper, know him unequivocally for that killer, what would we do?<eos> There is what I would like to do. And there is what I am permitted to do.<eos> And so instead of pinioning his head to the wall through his eyeball, we would show him our irons then go about the process of proof.<eos> We would.
I know, right?<eos> It's like Chutes and Ladders. Yup, zoom.<eos> Here we go.<eos> Well, that wouldn't be the most rational move.<eos> No, no, it wouldn't.
You could put the McLaren or the Bentley Mulsanne on it, that would be fantastic on a stamp.<eos> I mean, the French wouldn't do a stamp that had an old bloke on a bicycle and a stripy T-shirt with some onions, would they?<eos> That's what that is!<eos> The Germans wouldn't do a stamp with a half-track just outside Warsaw.<eos> Exactly. No, they really wouldn't.
So just how did you unlock the map?<eos> I did what Pan asked.<eos> And just who are you, Swan?<eos> Wouldn't you like to know?<eos> Perhaps I would.
What is that?<eos> Oh. It's like a Moroccan cigar, except you don't use as much upper body strength.<eos> A reverse bat cave is my favorite.<eos> - I love a King Henry.<eos> - Yeah, you would.
You're a long way from your condo in South Florida, Gregorek.<eos> Hear the weather's great down there in the winter.<eos> Is that your off-season?<eos> - I like the sunshine.<eos> - Who wouldn't, after a few months in the sewer?
- You thought that was harmless?<eos> I checked the data stream.<eos> It didn't seem like anything you and I hadn't already put out there, Skye.<eos> And I traced the account where the money came from to make sure it wasn't some evil corporation. It was just an eco-research lab.<eos> - Otherwise, I would never ...
Full of rejects and roaches.<eos> And that's why you moved back home?<eos> I like living in a house better. Is that a crime?<eos> You like having a backyard?<eos> Who wouldn't?
I had to free you from me and the only way that I could do that was to have another drink inside me.<eos> I have lied to you, yes.<eos> But you tell me, if you can tell the truth, would it have been a better life if you'd stayed with me than the one that you've had?<eos> No.<eos> No, it wouldn't.
I have a suspect, some evidence.<eos> The person who told me about the suspect, the person who gave me said evidence...<eos> I don't trust him.<eos> How would you proceed if you were me?<eos> I wouldn't.
And yet you're here?<eos> How bout your Dad?<eos> He says I have to help him in the garage after school for a month.<eos> Huh, like I mind!<eos> Man, who would?
And that wasn't enough?<eos> No, I just didn't want it to suffer.<eos> And you wouldn't call some guy pounding her head with a 20 pound rock 'suffer'?<eos> No...<eos> - You wouldn't?
I see.<eos> My bay the girl breezed this morning...<eos> I was wondering if your guy Jenkins would like to ride him.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> We sure as hell would, sir.
You know, colleen called it a long time ago.<eos> So, you're saying there's a chan-- no.<eos> I wouldn't 'cause you already did.<eos> But I could.<eos> But I wouldn't.
I cannot watch any more.<eos> Constable Noakes, would you like to take Nurse Browne to the pictures on Friday evening?<eos> I...<eos> Simple question. Yes or no.<eos> Yes, I would.
Most kings grew up as princes. They spend their whole lives preparing for the crown.<eos> I was raised to be Lord of Winterfell.<eos> I was raised to be a proper little lady, to play the harp and dance the latest steps and recite Valyrian poetry.<eos> I'd like to hear you play the harp. No.<eos> No, you would not.
- Not to you?<eos> You been there, Jim?<eos> No!<eos> I'm a married man, Hitch.<eos> You would, though, wouldn't you?
I had a bad day.<eos> I lost a patient and... and...<eos> Normally, I would...<eos> Tell you about it.<eos> And I would... I would, um...
That's why you're reluctant to give us your DNA.<eos> You were afraid we were gonna connect you to Fred.<eos> Like I told you, he attacked me.<eos> I'd like to believe you, Dwayne.<eos> I really would.
I would if I could.<eos> Hey, man, maybe you could help me out.<eos> Yeah, look, I don't know, man.<eos> It'd piss her off if I did, you know?<eos> Yeah, it would, wouldn't it?
st somewhere where, you know, the spoon and the fork are two separate things. Of course.<eos> I mean, what was I gonna do, take you to Taco Bell and bowling?<eos> You wouldn't like that.<eos> Would you?<eos> No, I would not.
No, listen to what I'm telling you-- I can't give my approval.<eos> The deal's a day away from being signed-- three years.<eos> I have approval over my executive producer.<eos> - You would think so, wouldn't you?<eos> - I would, yeah.
I'm so happy I could help you grow.<eos> Tariq, I'm sor...<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> If I could go back and change what I did...<eos> I would.
I'm sorry.<eos> Would you say that to a woman?<eos> By starting to get physical, she loses the right to say "Stop"?<eos> You would never say that.<eos> No, I wouldn't.
Do you like it here?<eos> I do, sir.<eos> Then you'd like to remain at your post?<eos> It is a simple enough question, Denise.<eos> I would, sir.
I don't know!<eos> You little runt, are you going to pull a stunt like that again?<eos> I don't know what you're going to make of yourself like that.<eos> Do you know?<eos> Why would you...
Why take a chance?<eos> It's not what you think.<eos> That's a pile of crap.<eos> If I told you, I could go to prison.<eos> Yeah, you probably would.
You put up with me when I was barefoot guy.<eos> Boy, nothing like a beer with the fellas, eh?<eos> Peter, would you mind putting on some shoes?<eos> Oh, you mean foot prisons?<eos> Yes, I would.
Carpe diem.<eos> This one's strawberries and apples.<eos> But she's Ralph's property.<eos> I mean, whether or not "shotgun" would hold up in a court of law, that's for the lawyers to decide.<eos> It wouldn't.
Do you live alone?<eos> Umm... sort of.<eos> It's actually not to far from here.<eos> I'd like to see where you really live.<eos> No you wouldn't.
There were so many better ways for Bobby to spend that money.<eos> I mean, he could have, say, put it all in a pile and set it on fire.<eos> You didn't let him down.<eos> If I did, it would kick major ass.<eos> No, it wouldn't...
We both have to work. Winter, too.<eos> And what do I do?<eos> Be alone my whole life?<eos> Stay here with me. Wouldn't you like that?<eos> Yes, I would.
Tomorrow we'll go to Camelot to see this Guinevere.<eos> Morgan, I'm sorry.<eos> She's still outside.<eos> I tried to move her, but she wouldn't go.<eos> Of course she wouldn't.
To begin with, I'll need a single shipment from you of 200 kilos, on account.<eos> You know how much that is worth to me?<eos> Three million at 15 grand a kilo.<eos> But I'm willing to pay you back at 20, which would create an extra ã1 million on that shipment.<eos> - As it would a fourfold increase in your debt.
Do as your Doctore commands.<eos> Yes, Dominus.<eos> Come. Let us see what is between your legs.<eos> The Gaul winces from spear...<eos> As he would from my cock!
Please.<eos> Please, just tell me what's going on with you.<eos> - You wouldn't underand.<eos> - Try.<eos> - You wouldn't.
Yay!<eos> That was the German-est thing I've ever seen.<eos> I'm so glad you like it, Chris.<eos> Would you like to try?<eos> Oh, boy, would I? !
She's the last hostage.<eos> She's merely the airport shuttle driver.<eos> Mr. Black is a zealot.<eos> He believes harming innocents is evil, so why keep the driver for last?<eos> Why would...
I'll give you either, A, I panicked or, B, I just really wanted to hear your voice on your message.<eos> I kind of like both options.<eos> So seriously, would you like to have coffee with me again?<eos> Yes.<eos> Seriously, I would.
Don't I?<eos> I suppose I have a bit more make-up on there.<eos> And more hair.<eos> I'd say it was bigger, I wouldn't say there was more hair.<eos> I would.
It's just that most kids we pick up at the time of night aren't just out walking.<eos> It's usually for drugs or something like that.<eos> Well, you don't know Chloe.<eos> It's just sometimes other people see things that parents don't...<eos> Or would rather not.
Then he'd stop.<eos> You know, I have a friend in the Suffolk College Media Department... she might be able to arrange something like that.<eos> But wouldn't that be cruel?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, it would.
Dr. Elliot. He's in charge of medication.<eos> - It must be him.<eos> - Why would Elliot want Bethel to stay insane? That doesn't make any sense.<eos> He's the one who put Bethel on the original dose, why would he wanna reverse the process?<eos> He wouldn't.
I'll expect you shortly, Daniel.<eos> Don't let my mom rattle you.<eos> Intimidation is practically a sign of endearment with her.<eos> I'd hate to be on her bad side.<eos> Yes, you would.
That's great.<eos> Listen, Allie, um...<eos> I was wondering if sometime you might want to--<eos> Yes.<eos> I would.
And never stood a chance.<eos> You were the sexiest girl that I'd ever seen.<eos> It was a damn good bra.<eos> My mother's risk bore a reward.<eos> And maybe mine would too.
So I'd like you to go with me.<eos> And I hope you don't think I'm being a jerk because I'm being totally honest with you.<eos> And since you and I were girlfriend and boyfriend for years, you think you could possibly go with me, for old times' sake? As a friend?<eos> Yeah.<eos> You would?
And remember, this is a rescue mission.<eos> I heard you.<eos> So don't charge in there all crazy, machine-gunning everything in sight.<eos> When have I -- I'm sure you'd love it - if Sterling were killed in some huge crossfire.<eos> - Wh-? No I wouldn't!
I panicked, and I ran to that car with those boots on.<eos> Well, why didn't you tell me?<eos> I really couldn't say anything.<eos> You'd never forgive me.<eos> Of course I would.
Ellie...<eos> Ellie, look at me.<eos> You know, if I was found dead, it would look like I'd killed myself, wouldn't it?<eos> Don't don't talk like this.<eos> It would, though, wouldn't it?
Everyone should think that its my baby.<eos> And you will say so.<eos> Where on earth does something like that happen?<eos> will they believe us?<eos> Of course they would. Why wouldn't they?
Three people died making their escape.<eos> A fourth, an employee who may have been involved has been killed.<eos> - By Northmoor security?<eos> - I didn't say that.<eos> No one would.
His boss wants me dead.<eos> I only hope it's quick when it happens, you know?<eos> Like with him, I mean...<eos> I mean, I almost wish that it would just happen now, you know?<eos> So I wouldn't...
Which is what?<eos> Sleep till noon and hang out at the mall?<eos> Shut up.<eos> What, you'd do it for me?<eos> Yeah. I would.
Sir, I actually don't think you're in any position to make that call.<eos> I was the U.S. Treasury Secretary, I'm in some position to make that call<eos> Letting our imaginations run away with us is exactly what we were told us to do in your freshmen address.<eos> I would suggest that you let your imaginations run away with you on a new project.<eos> - You would?
I dunno.<eos> OK, but...<eos> Would you like to?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, I would.
You must avoid the defeated..."<eos> Shit!<eos> "... like you would the plague".<eos> You dropped this.<eos> "... like you would the plague".
It didn't work out.<eos> As for the v.A.T. , my accountant stuffed up. That was all.<eos> I'm getting it sorted.<eos> But a nice big insurance claim should help a lot.<eos> Yeah, it would.
Yeah, right, cos I'm sure they're listed in the local small ads.<eos> Actually, Rowena, it's erm... funny you should say that.<eos> Dr Belisarius says he last saw Willard mid-afternoon.<eos> I suppose an alibi'd be too much to hope for.<eos> Of course it would.
We should not hate someone or fight.<eos> We should do right always.<eos> And we should listen to the old words and remember Leonard.<eos> If anyone else has something to say...<eos> Oh, I would.
Okay.<eos> We thought that Samsonite is this very rare element, this mythical substance, the hardest on earth, and we see an adventurer leaping through a cave.<eos> Is this a substance much like bullshit?<eos> I thought we could drop one off the Eiffel Tower, with a countdown, like the moon shot and show how it doesn't break.<eos> -But it would, wouldn't it?
Upright or grand?<eos> Well, it's not Elton John's piano.<eos> It's mine. Upright.<eos> My guess is it would, yeah.<eos> It would?
Oh! Good.<eos> I'm eight for 26 this month.<eos> Yeah, I think I'll pass. But you guys enjoy your extra 21 seconds.<eos> Bet if I could make you understand why this is such a cool thing, we'd still be together.<eos> Mm, yeah, no, we wouldn't.
- I'm seducing you, Mr. Anderson.<eos> - Well, don't!<eos> I thought you'd like it.<eos> I do.<eos> I would.
- Yeah.<eos> And if you've ever spent an entire day in a deer blind, you know that you do not want to open those.<eos> You should see your dad.<eos> How would that help the case?<eos> Oh, it wouldn't.
Uh, Jimmy Ford for Bridgette O'Hare.<eos> It's a gift.<eos> Hello?<eos> Ronin Donnelly, I worked for your father for 30 years.<eos> I wouldn't...
That was a good night.<eos> Best night since I've been here. - Yeah?<eos> - I'd do it again, you know?<eos> Whilst I've been in this part of the world, there's not many things that have happened that I'd say, "I'd do that again."<eos> But that, I would.
He skipped the campground after we left, but we found this on her computer.<eos> Blue-eyed all-American jihadi terror cell.<eos> With enough explosives to take down the Staples Center.<eos> If they know what they're doing.<eos> Walker would.
I could not... Stop myself.<eos> I get it.<eos> But he murdered a dozen people, and he was planning to kill more.<eos> Look, deep down, nobody minds what you did.<eos> Father Jensen... He would.
If you found millions of dollars of gems in the street?<eos> Give 'em back.<eos> Oh, come on, guy.<eos> You wouldn't keep some?<eos> Why, would you?
Hey, Hani... you still lik' Seung-Jo... huh?<eos> Aft'r all that dissing he's given to ya, you still have it fo' him?<eos> So, that's lik' ya like that kinda pretty boy styl'?<eos> No! Never!<eos> Why would I?
- Married.<eos> Well, it would depend on who it was, of course.<eos> - Would it?<eos> That's interesting.<eos> - Well, of course it would.
–Hello.<eos> I had an exam.<eos> That's good.<eos> Would you like to have some lunch now?<eos> I would.
He lasted longer than any of the others.<eos> I had to amputate my finger where he bit it.<eos> The little bastard.<eos> Why?<eos> Why would...
Our lives are devoted to the pursuit of truth.<eos> Bones, you can't go around telling everybody what's on your mind even though it's the truth.<eos> Okay, look, what if you and I were going out, right, and you were, you know, taking forever to get ready and you came out in this dress, and I told you I didn't like it. What are you gonna do?<eos> I'd reevaluate, change, or ignore you.<eos> Of course you would, Bones, good answer.
- Why do you say that?<eos> 'Cause I've been ripped off before.<eos> That wouldn't happen with me.<eos> - No?<eos> - No, it wouldn't.
You can make all the mistakes you want, with, god-willing,<eos> b., I've been looking everywhere for you.<eos> I know that was rachel that sent the "gossip girl" blast.<eos> I'm sorry I didn't believe you.<eos> Why would you?
There is a knife in your brain.<eos> -Right, yeah.<eos> -By some miracle, you're still alive.<eos> If you're gonna get stabbed in the head, you picked exactly the right spot, but, then...<eos> -...you would.
On one of our early dates,olivia took me to the cloisters.<eos> She loved the architecture there and the history.<eos> It's where we fell in love.<eos> Spreading her ashes there is what she'd want me to do.<eos> Like hell she would.
What's this?<eos> It's John Locke's suicide note.<eos> I...<eos> - I didn't know.<eos> - Why would you?
Paulie.<eos> His name was Paulie.<eos> He was just three years old.<eos> He'd be about your age.<eos> Yeah, he would.
Girls, I'm telling you, are not into the flashy stuff.<eos> They just want it simple, classy, like James Bond.<eos> All right, fine.<eos> Would James Bond use a cane?<eos> No, he would not.
If we don't cut this deal, then... her murderer could walk.<eos> It's your case, Booth.<eos> What I want doesn't matter.<eos> To me, it does.<eos> And it would to Sachi.
She had help.<eos> Can I just say, this was really exciting.<eos> You know, when they first asked me to run this project, the subject of maternal feelings came up.<eos> You see, I used to have a daughter.<eos> She'd...
But look, lady, he's the crazy one, pointing his shiny little piece at us because we said we liked his car.<eos> What kind of a compliment did you pay his vehicle?<eos> She means, "how did you tell him you liked the car?"<eos> I just said, you know, "I'd look real good driving that cadillac around."<eos> - 'Cause I would.
- I get real nervous before...<eos> - No, that's just a... lip gloss.<eos> Back in the old days, Sue used to blow me.<eos> But these days, she likes them younger... and balder.<eos> - Hey, would you... - OK.
We don't have to keep hiding all the time.<eos> It'd be nice for a change, huh?<eos> Yeah, it would.<eos> Jackie, Mr. Everett's in the OR and I feel like if we had done more than give him clean clothes and a meal tray the last time, maybe he would still have his foot.<eos> He wouldn't.
Your Majesty, I'm sorry.<eos> - There's no way he could...<eos> - That is really bad.<eos> He does not know that you are supplying it.<eos> He'd better not.
You, Don, have been standing on someone's shoulders.<eos> We brought you in, we nurtured you like family, and now's the time to pay us back.<eos> You can't go any further on your own, Don.<eos> Would you say I know something about you, Don?<eos> I would.
Well, Paige is our flower girl, and she needs petals to strewn.<eos> How much do I owe you for these?<eos> Oh, consider it my contribution to the wedding.<eos> Now that we're having the ceremony in malibu, maybe you would like to come to the wedding.<eos> Would you...
If you asked me to do you a favor I would say yes.<eos> I wouldn't expect any money in return.<eos> - I would do it out of the goodness of my heart.<eos> - Really? - You would do me a favor out of the goodness of your heart?<eos> - Of course I would.
