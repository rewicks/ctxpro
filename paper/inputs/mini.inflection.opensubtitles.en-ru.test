- Can I help you?<eos> - I'm looking for someone.<eos> You been here before?<eos> My friend had some mech work done here.<eos> Industry stuff.
What are you doing to me?<eos> I'll run the standard synaptic. Upload your data on the raid.<eos> Find out exactly what Kuze told you.<eos> You know what he told me.<eos> The truth.
But you're confusing me.<eos> "Don't move, you asshole." "On your knees, you son of a bitch." Which is it?<eos> You have three seconds to comply!<eos> You're not good at this.<eos> One!
But if you need a fifty of Purple Urkle, I am not the girl to ask.<eos> Okay, Cage, follow me.<eos> I'll introduce you to your ground team.<eos> - Thank you, Becky.<eos> - Of course.
Did I ever leave?<eos> Shit.<eos> Spotted our clown.<eos> Easier than expected.<eos> Drinks all around.
"Today's the day you die."<eos> I'm touched.<eos> Can I have my jacket, when you get a sec?<eos> Then a man comes along, tells me a story about a drought in California.<eos> About skateboards and swimming pools.
And when Becky locks in his exact location, we make our move.<eos> What about you?<eos> How did you get roped into all this?<eos> I tagged a skyscraper and got a year in jail for it.<eos> Jail?
Uh, yeah, I confess, I had my doubts.<eos> That's for talking shit about my friend, Gibbons.<eos> Xiang!<eos> Get on your knees!<eos> On your knees!
Get on your knees!<eos> On your knees!<eos> Hands!<eos> Hands!<eos> On your knees, now.
The Kepps.<eos> - Bina and Jerry Kepp.<eos> - Right.<eos> And I'm Walter, just a successful businessman who just likes to read his favorite book.<eos> That one.
How does a guy who...<eos> After two years, you break up with me over text?<eos> "Good luck with your future endeavors"?<eos> Were you firing me?<eos> What the f...
So you could just stand awkwardly in front of another table.<eos> Oh, okay.<eos> Thank you for the clarity of that.<eos> That was bracing, so thank you.<eos> My pleasure.
It was not a table of honor.<eos> I have a bag of dope in my room.<eos> Room 115 for the dope in case any of you feel that a bag of dope would be fun to do.<eos> Not you.<eos> And not you.
You're a pothead.<eos> You got a table with a lot of your friends<eos> Waitin' for your ship to come in<eos> Folks like me on the job from nine to five<eos> Concierge, please.
Folks like me on the job from nine to five<eos> Concierge, please.<eos> Hi.<eos> Um, can you tell me when the next ferry arrives?<eos> In about 30 minutes.
Not on my beach, Arian!<eos> He saved my nana's life.<eos> I ever tell you about that?<eos> Every time he jogs by.<eos> Literally, every single time.
Absolutely. And we still<eos> - don't give a fuck.<eos> - Don't give a fuck.<eos> Yeah. Okay, that ocean out there has riptides that'll tear your little mangina in two.<eos> My mangina?
And if you need some extra motivation...<eos> - Looking at it right there.<eos> - Hey...<eos> You okay?<eos> Help!
He's reckless, he's insubordinate. Come on.<eos> Which is why we can afford him.<eos> The guy's only here because he took a plea deal.<eos> A plea deal?<eos> For what?
Thank you, C. J.<eos> Thank you.<eos> So get out there, kick ass and make us proud.<eos> Go, Baywatch.<eos> On your mark.
- Ma'am, stop it!<eos> I can't save you if you're being a dick!<eos> - Where are the other two?<eos> - "Other two"?<eos> Shit.
- No, it's not your fault.<eos> - No, Ted.<eos> - Why, why, Ted?<eos> - Why you, Ted?<eos> Why?
Is anyone there?<eos> I hear you!<eos> Get to the front of the boat!<eos> We're coming!<eos> Help!
C.J.!<eos> Okay, guapo.<eos> If you want me, you can have me.<eos> But rápido because the boat is on fire.<eos> - Some other time. - No...
Are you all right? Can you hear me?<eos> No, I'm not okay!<eos> Help!<eos> Please!<eos> Help!
Can't believe Leeds is doing that shit during the day.<eos> Yeah. That takes balls.<eos> Holy shit.<eos> It's like Breaking Bad in there.<eos> Yeah, dude, Breaking Bad.
You leave me no choice.<eos> You're done.<eos> I want you off the beach.<eos> I'm putting Brody in charge.<eos> No way.
Jason Bourne ain't got shit on me!<eos> If I could please have your attention.<eos> By this time tomorrow, the expansion of the Huntley will be official.<eos> But for now, let's enjoy the caviar, the champagne and the fireworks.<eos> Cheers.
Buongiorno.<eos> Signore.<eos> There's a story about that cat.<eos> It was the custom amongst those building houses such as this to... To seal a cat within the walls as a protection against evil.<eos> A dead cat?
There's a story about that cat.<eos> It was the custom amongst those building houses such as this to... To seal a cat within the walls as a protection against evil.<eos> A dead cat?<eos> No.<eos> Not dead.
He's waiting.<eos> But he's waited long enough.<eos> Surely that is clear to anyone.<eos> When he speaks, where will you go?<eos> To the next place.
I... I think you know what it is I ask.<eos> If I have offended you, I apologize and ask that we forget the matter entirely.<eos> Your work here will be unaffected.<eos> Look at yourself, how beautiful you are.<eos> Your left leg forward.
Your work here will be unaffected.<eos> Look at yourself, how beautiful you are.<eos> Your left leg forward.<eos> Your hand.<eos> Yes, your hand.
I must speak to Jakob.<eos> Jakob.<eos> The boy will speak when the time is right.<eos> Help me.<eos> Help.
What?<eos> This is why I deserve some public recognition for making shit like that happen.<eos> Maybe someone should give me a ribbon. Like the ones that you used to have hanging on your wall, Sammy.<eos> Remember?<eos> From horseback riding?
I mean, not since the third grade.<eos> Better get started then. I haven't much time.<eos> Because I wanted to.<eos> Juliet, I need to talk to you.<eos> For a second.
There is nothing wrong with you.<eos> Don't let anyone tell you that there is.<eos> This is just a blip.<eos> Your life will change, Juliet, if you just hold on...<eos> For one more minute.
I think she's disappointed in me.<eos> No, it's just she's all desperate and needy.<eos> She can tell when someone doesn't love her.<eos> Not the dog, stupid.<eos> Who, Claire?
Fuck, no.<eos> You see?<eos> Now, that is pure Wilson.<eos> Here's to you, Claire.<eos> And to you, Coop!
Yeah.<eos> How come you're so quiet?<eos> Oh, well, I...<eos> Some of my best times with my mom were spent, um... not saying a word, just... just sitting together in the same room... feeling... the connection.<eos> Like a chemical thing.
You staying out of trouble?<eos> Yo, Wilson!<eos> Wassup, man?<eos> Hey, man.<eos> Wassup, hippie?
He would accept surrender.<eos> Hold the crown.<eos> And hold it steady.<eos> Drink their blood!<eos> War!
Loose!<eos> There will be no more killings. There will be no more purges. Am I clear, brother?<eos> Now leave me.<eos> Peace?<eos> For a while.
Well, they get treated the same as the man they hide.<eos> Would they, now?<eos> Not sure you're too welcome here, mate.<eos> You're in safe hands now, no need to worry.<eos> In the back room, now.
Hands on the hilt, stupid.<eos> Oi, both hands.<eos> I said, both hands.<eos> Right, ten digits round the blunt bit. Give it a tug.<eos> Left foot, right foot.
You've got the wrong man, sire.<eos> I was born in a brothel, on a bridge in Londinium.<eos> The sword can only be drawn by Uther Pendragon or his direct heir.<eos> You felt it, didn't you?<eos> The power.
What's going on?<eos> Father, you're scaring me.<eos> I love you very much.<eos> Come on!<eos> Charge!
You going for a swim, Melissa?<eos> This is the Doctor.<eos> Have a party for him every year.<eos> Celebrate.<eos> To the Doctor.
A rogue transmission, most probably.<eos> Your helmet must have picked it up because you were so far out... past our communication buffers.<eos> Is there audio, Mother?<eos> Collating.<eos> A moment.
Let's move.<eos> - Come on, guys.<eos> - Air feels good.<eos> Faris, have you got me?<eos> Yeah. Loud and clear.
My God.<eos> Stay down.<eos> Help me!<eos> Hold him!<eos> What the fuck!
You have symphonies in you, brother.<eos> I was designed to be more attentive and efficient than every previous model.<eos> I superseded them in every way, but...<eos> But you are not allowed to create.<eos> Even a simple tune.
Maggie's gone.<eos> I'm so sorry, Tee.<eos> We tried to help her, but we didn't make it.<eos> Tee?<eos> Copy.
Walter.<eos> Walter.<eos> Not quite.<eos> What do you believe in, David?<eos> Creation.
This way.<eos> Tee, let's choose our ground.<eos> We'll bring it to us.<eos> Where?<eos> My turf.
How did you get out of that plane?<eos> There's not a single scratch on your body.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Thank you.<eos> For what?
That tomb is what led us to Ahmanet.<eos> I think she is the princess in the legend.<eos> The hieroglyphics said that she murdered her father.<eos> - Murdered?<eos> - Along with his child.
Oh Nick.<eos> You did this for me?<eos> Yes.<eos> I have made so many many mistakes.<eos> But not this time.
You're grounded.<eos> - Grounded?<eos> No, not grounded!<eos> - What?<eos> No way!
What's going on in here?<eos> Well, all right.<eos> Have you ever seen something so beautiful?<eos> Every day, Smurfette.<eos> Every day.
Now all I want to do is touch it.<eos> At this pace, Gargamel doesn't stand a chance.<eos> Look.<eos> If we follow this river, we'll be right on course.<eos> Right on course.
Help!<eos> All right.<eos> We're still on course.<eos> Double-time it, Hefty.<eos> Help!
She's the best at that kind of thing.<eos> Right, Stormy?<eos> That means "yes."<eos> Have you ever seen a rainbow?<eos> What about a double rainbow?
Trust us, he's a goner.<eos> Stormy, why don't you do a little recon?<eos> Check things out.<eos> And leave you here with these four?<eos> No way.
With as much as you've seen, can you rule it out?<eos> The criminally insane don't need magic as an excuse.<eos> I recommend spending more time on the streets instead of flying over them.<eos> He's even friendlier than they say.<eos> Bollocks!
I didn't put the symbols in there for the GPS to find it.<eos> I wanted the House to come to us.<eos> She can't hold it. Do something.<eos> There.<eos> Into the House!
Come on, fellow.<eos> Eat a piece of fruit?<eos> Here it is.<eos> We've got to get out of here.<eos> One more second.
Take a nap, young man.<eos> Well, you too, young man.<eos> Do not let the omelet touch the fruit, She loves them separately.<eos> Do you do this every day?<eos> - Every day.
Save my life?<eos> You ruined my fucking life, Mark.<eos> You ruined it!<eos> Now you're ruining my fucking death, too!<eos> Thanks a lot, Amigo.
A man who'd done nothing to me.<eos> Cunt just looked at me the wrong way in a moment when I was thinking of you.<eos> I've been thinking about you for 20 year.<eos> When you robbed us.<eos> Your best mates.
I always promised myself that one day...<eos> Come on, Rent Boy.<eos> Not like you to be so shy.<eos> I remember my first day at primary school.<eos> My very first day.
- Bonjour!<eos> Bonjour!<eos> There goes the baker with his tray like always<eos> The same old bread and rolls to sell<eos> Every morning just the same
- No!<eos> I'll come back!<eos> I promise!<eos> Forgive my intrusion, mademoiselle... but I have come to escort you to your room.<eos> My room?
- That's it.<eos> - That's it.<eos> Yes, that's it.<eos> This way, please.<eos> To the east wing.
No one hits like Gaston<eos> Matches wits like Gaston<eos> In a spitting match nobody spits like Gaston<eos> I'm especially good at expectorating<eos> Ten points for Gaston!
Gently, Master.<eos> The girl lost her father... and her freedom in one day.<eos> Yes, the poor thing is probably in there, scared to death.<eos> Exactly.<eos> Just a minute.
Be our guest, be our guest<eos> Our command is your request<eos> It's been years since we've had anybody Here and we're obsessed<eos> With your meal<eos> With your ease
No! No!<eos> No!<eos> Please don't go!<eos> It's dangerous!<eos> Oh, my!
Think of the one place you've always wanted to see.<eos> Now find it in your mind's eye.<eos> Then feel it in your heart.<eos> Where did you take us?<eos> Paris.
I'm afraid it's my turn to leave.<eos> We're together now.<eos> It's gonna be fine.<eos> At least I got to see you.<eos> One last time.
You're going to have a great time.<eos> Can I borrow your camera?<eos> Yeah, but... if you drop it, you got to go down and get it.<eos> What are we doing, Kate?<eos> - Smile.
It kind of takes your breath away.<eos> How deep do you think it goes?<eos> I have no idea.<eos> Wave to the camera.<eos> Cheese!
- It's so good.<eos> Where are you all headed? - Uh...<eos> Oregon.<eos> - South Dakota.<eos> Well, Oregon and then South Dakota.
You stay out this shit, Mehar.<eos> Technically, this is occurring during school hours, so I cannot stay out this S-word.<eos> There is contraband in here.<eos> Who does this belong to?<eos> Him.
I couldn't believe it.<eos> He just keeps going on and on and on that he wants to fight you.<eos> I'm like, "This guy?<eos> There's no way!<eos> No way!"
It's a bloodbath in there.<eos> Holly, Ms. Monet...<eos> We all got fired.<eos> No!<eos> You, too?
Shit!<eos> Okay.<eos> Okay.<eos> What the fuck is going on in there?<eos> Just one more minute.
Let that be a lesson to you.<eos> Actions have consequences.<eos> Campbell!<eos> You want some more of this, huh, boy?<eos> Oh, shit!
Campbell!<eos> I'm never gonna stop fighting!<eos> Uh-uh!<eos> I'm never gonna stop fighting for myself.<eos> For my family, for this school!
To Julia, the woman who has brought so many stories to life as our chief online editor<eos> - now gets to have a life of her own...<eos> - Thank you.<eos> And will be working remotely in her pajama jeans and granny panties.<eos> To Julia.
Okay.<eos> But if it wasn't for you guys here at this table, Copper Mountain Brewery wouldn't be here.<eos> So, from Miguel and I, thank you very much and cheers.<eos> - Cheers!<eos> - To Copper Mountain. Yes.
How do you expect to be a mother when you can't even take care of yourself?<eos> You're worthless, Julia.<eos> You will always be worthless.<eos> No.<eos> Not this time.
I did not know you spoke my tongue, brother Ciarán.<eos> The abbot said you were far travelled.<eos> - You have seen Rome?<eos> - A long time ago.<eos> And the Holy Land?
Those are your entrance. Twisted around the arrow, like worms on a hook.<eos> Would you like to see them?<eos> You have suffered enough, brother.<eos> I can give you a quick death.<eos> A merciful death.
You are not worthy to carry the relic.<eos> There is something in you, boy ... - ... something evil.<eos> - Wait.<eos> Was there truth to what he said?<eos> About your father.
- Uh, yes, I can do that.<eos> All done.<eos> Have you got it?<eos> Charlie?<eos> A week later...
That's mine.<eos> You two take a... bus.<eos> Why?<eos> I need to concentrate, and I don't want to hit you.<eos> The Mall, please.
I met someone tonight.<eos> Same someone who's looking for the sixth Thatcher.<eos> Oh, my God, that's Ajay, that's him.<eos> What, he's alive?<eos> Yeah, very much so.
Your initiative?<eos> My initiative.<eos> Freelancers are too woolly, too messy.<eos> I don't like loose ends.<eos> Not on my watch.
All right.<eos> I'll see what I can do.<eos> But remember this, brother mine, agents like Mary tend not to reach retirement age.<eos> They get retired in a pretty permanent sort of way.<eos> Not on my watch.
Oh, God.<eos> Al, you're looking well.<eos> So you didn't get the message, Randa?<eos> - To reschedule?<eos> - For the fifth time?
There's something going on here, something that nobody is talking about.<eos> I can't believe we're doing this.<eos> Are you guys kidding me?<eos> A day away.<eos> One day away!
What did they do?<eos> Just leave him up there?<eos> What's he eating?<eos> Tang.<eos> Spam.
Weapons!<eos> Enough to kill it.<eos> Kong didn't kill Chapman.<eos> But he did kill these men!<eos> My men!
I'll see you later.<eos> THERAPIST: Is there anything you're not telling me?<eos> (CHUCKLES) No. (CLEARS THROAT)<eos> What are you looking at?<eos> Nothing.
We'll call...<eos> I'm trying to sleep.<eos> Can you stop ringing my damn phone?<eos> MYCROFT: Sherlock has left his flat.<eos> First time in a week.
Faith!<eos> SHERLOCK: You said your life turned on one word.<eos> A name can't be one word.<eos> If you were to come round asking after him, that he'd rather have anyone but you.<eos> Anyone.
FAITH: And what's that?<eos> SMITH: I need to kill someone.<eos> FAITH: Who?<eos> Who?<eos> Anyone.
You've had too much.<eos> And that's me saying it.<eos> Kill.<eos> Sherlock...<eos> -Anyone.
-But those are only the ones we catch.<eos> -Who do we catch?<eos> Serial killers.<eos> But if you are rich, and powerful, and necessary...<eos> SMITH: Anyone.
If the only thing I ever do in this world is drive him out of it, then my life will not have been wasted.<eos> Look at me.<eos> Can't do it.<eos> Not now.<eos> Not alone.
You know that, don't you?<eos> The game is on.<eos> I'll do my best.<eos> Anything you need.<eos> Anytime.
Safest place to hide.<eos> Plain sight.<eos> Mr Holmes.<eos> Culverton wants to know if you're okay going straight to the hospital.<eos> -(SCOFFS) Hospital?
Unsolved case, shoot the wall. (MAKES SHOOTING SOUNDS)<eos> Unmade breakfast karate the fridge.<eos> Unanswered questions...<eos> Well, what does he do with anything he can't answer, John?<eos> Every time.
Hello.<eos> My name's Jim Moriarty.<eos> Welcome to the final problem.<eos> You know I could arrest you.<eos> - What for?
Usually it's much worse.<eos> I might go and work in a bank.<eos> Is that a helicopter?<eos> Nah.<eos> Not in this weather.
For your own physical safety, do not speak.<eos> Do not indulge in any non-verbal signal suggestive of internal thought.<eos> If the safety of my sister is compromised, if the security of my sister is compromised, if the incarceration of my sister is compromised, in short, if I find any indication my sister has left this island at any time, I swear to you, you will not!<eos> - Say thank you to Dr Watson.<eos> - Why?
- He left.<eos> - And?<eos> Killed himself.<eos> And?<eos> His family.
You just need a big enough hard drive.<eos> - Sherlock.<eos> - Not now.<eos> - Vatican cameos.<eos> - In a minute.
- Why?<eos> - Do it.<eos> Step closer.<eos> Tell me what you remember.<eos> You, me and Mycroft.
God, that's my wife.<eos> I'm going to shoot the governor's wife.<eos> Please, no.<eos> Please, help her.<eos> In about a minute...
Which is why this is going to be so much harder.<eos> You said you liked my Lady Bracknell.<eos> Sherlock, don't.<eos> -It isn't your decision, Dr Watson.<eos> Not in the face, though.
Um, now, I'll tell you what.<eos> You've got to be really, really brave for me.<eos> Can you go to the front of the plane?<eos> Can you do that?<eos> - The front? - Yes.
Can you go to the front of the plane?<eos> Can you do that?<eos> - The front? - Yes.<eos> That's right.<eos> The front.
You killed my best friend.<eos> I never had a best friend.<eos> I had no one.<eos> Play with me, Sherlock. Play with me.<eos> No one.
I never had a best friend.<eos> I had no one.<eos> Play with me, Sherlock. Play with me.<eos> No one.<eos> No one.
This time, get it right.<eos> Tell me how to save my friend.<eos> Eurus.<eos> Help me save John Watson.<eos> Help.
Is that good?<eos> It's not good, it's not bad. It's...<eos> It is what it is.<eos> Alive!<eos> For all these years?
Three stories, five hugs, and my special song, right?<eos> You got it!<eos> Blackbird singing in the dead of night<eos> Take these broken wings and learn to fly<eos> All your life
It's okay.<eos> Daddy's here.<eos> Daddy's here.<eos> What about me?<eos> The year: 2057.
Never.<eos> Hello!<eos> It's time for my three stories, five hugs, and special song!<eos> How about one story... three hugs, and my special song?<eos> Just my special song?
There's only so much love to go around.<eos> It's like these beads.<eos> You used to have all your parents' love.<eos> All their time.<eos> All their attention.
This is my team?<eos> A muscle-head, a bunch of yes men, and a doodler?<eos> Exactly!<eos> Affirmative!<eos> Good call.
And an eyebrow ring?<eos> Seems like a little too much, Lam-Lam.<eos> How's that gonna look in a job interview?<eos> Stop it!<eos> The tape, Timmy!
Mad?<eos> You need a time-out!<eos> You're grounded!<eos> Yes, grounded!<eos> For two...
Every man has his breaking point.<eos> This was mine.<eos> Blackbird singing in the dead of night<eos> Take these broken wings and learn to fly Hey, that's my song.<eos> All your life
La, la, la...<eos> Le, le, le...<eos> No.<eos> No way.<eos> No.
What have you done to me?<eos> Stop!<eos> Get back here!<eos> No!<eos> No way.
You guys stay in the Puppy Zone, okay?<eos> Okay, bye!<eos> That's where we'll find the secret file on the new puppy.<eos> We'll never get through that door.<eos> No, not that door.
No, not that door.<eos> The doggy door.<eos> But how do we get past the guard?<eos> No, no, no.<eos> No way.
No.<eos> I've seen this before somewhere.<eos> We've gotta find something to replace it with.<eos> You're right.<eos> Like another file.
Please don't go with him.<eos> Francis Francis is trying to...<eos> Believe me...<eos> Eugenia won't take her eyes off your children.<eos> Not for one second.
That's very reassuring.<eos> Now you see them.<eos> And now, you don't.<eos> Too-da-loo!<eos> To the airport!
Oh, no, we didn't!<eos> Flower power!<eos> Pow, pow, pow!<eos> That's my boy!<eos> Poppy!
Where are you going?<eos> Fine!<eos> Blackbird singing in the dead of night<eos> Take these broken wings and learn to fly<eos> All your life
Literally, I can't reach the door knobs.<eos> Oh, right.<eos> Don't worry, Tim.<eos> We're gonna save your parents.<eos> And your company.
Who was that guy anyway?<eos> The captain!<eos> What?<eos> En garde!<eos> Heave!
20 seconds.<eos> 15 seconds.<eos> Blackbird singing in the dead of night<eos> Take these broken wings and learn to fly<eos> All your life
Best boss ever.<eos> And you guys don't always have to toe the company line, you know?<eos> It's okay to think for yourself.<eos> No, sir!<eos> No way!
Is that a true story, Daddy?<eos> Well, sweetie, that's how I remember it.<eos> But you know what I found out? What?<eos> There's plenty of love for everyone.<eos> Even me?
That's all I know.<eos> I see it within you. An unorthodox genealogy.<eos> A hybrid that seems particularly... reckless.<eos> You know, they told me you people were conceited douchebags... but that isn't true at all.<eos> Oh, shit.
How'd you locate us now?<eos> Well, even where I reside, out past the edge of what's known... we've heard tell about the man they call Star-Lord.<eos> What say we head out there right now?<eos> Your associates are welcome.<eos> Even that triangle-faced monkey there.
So after I murder my sister... I will buy a warship with every conceivable instrument of death.<eos> I will hunt my father like a dog, and I will tear him apart slowly... piece by piece... until he knows some semblance of the profound and unceasing pain...<eos> Yeah.<eos> I was talking about, like, a pretty necklace.<eos> Or a nice hat.
I only ask one thing.<eos> That your High Priestess... tell him the name of the man what sealed his fate.<eos> Taserface!<eos> Where to, Captain?<eos> Ego.
I seriously can't believe that's where your mind goes.<eos> It was just a random thought, man.<eos> I thought we were friends.<eos> Of course, I care about the planets, and the buildings... and all the animals on the planets.<eos> And the people.
Captain?<eos> What is it, Kraglin?<eos> Hey, remember that Ayesha chick?<eos> - Yeah, why?<eos> - Uh... Oh, hell!
Mama Nature's gift.<eos> A revolution in the livestock industry.<eos> And now we have a competition!<eos> One local farmer will raise the biggest, most beautiful and special one.<eos> The ultimate super pig!
Of course.<eos> So why is he coming?<eos> Paperwork?<eos> They said soccer would be on.<eos> Son of a...
Show the sash to the camera, Jennifer, and go...<eos> - Ready for the festival in New York City?<eos> - New York?<eos> Very healthy.<eos> One more sash, please.
Go wash up so we can eat.<eos> I put in this and that.<eos> Everything that's good for you.<eos> Where are you going?<eos> Seoul.
Seoul.<eos> What?<eos> I'm going to bring Okja home.<eos> Are you crazy?<eos> Seoul?
It wasn't our intention, okay?<eos> - This way!<eos> - Guys, be careful!<eos> Where are you?<eos> Me! Me, too!
Right there!<eos> Back door!<eos> Go to the back door!<eos> Hey!<eos> Back door!
Okay.<eos> I'm sorry, but this was our plan.<eos> Rescue Okja, replace the black box and let Mirando retake Okja.<eos> You want to send Okja to America?<eos> To this laboratory?
Look at this... the VCR's toast.<eos> Uh, wait a sec...<eos> Where's Old Black Man?<eos> Oh, my God. He's gone.<eos> What the hell? What?

Am I... am I free to go?<eos> Gentlemen, am... am I free to go?<eos> Harvey, you son of a bitch.<eos> Did you send the cops to my place of business?<eos> My work?
Well, we'd certainly like to help you.<eos> Would you like a room?<eos> Good meal?<eos> A drink?<eos> A little companionship?
We're watching you,<eos> Mr... Jones.<eos> We're on Lancelot Court.<eos> You don't know your address?<eos> Just a red door?
Mr... Jones.<eos> We're on Lancelot Court.<eos> You don't know your address?<eos> Just a red door?<eos> Red door.
I'm not gonna have him killed in that damn death-trap car.<eos> I told you this.<eos> Sammy looked at it, and it's fine.<eos> When?<eos> About two hours ago.
Just don't forget to call them, okay?<eos> And no more drinking and gambling.<eos> Now get going.<eos> You'll be late for work.<eos> Work.
Your car.<eos> Okay, get in.<eos> I'll drive you.<eos> Where is your car, anyway?<eos> In the car!
Off in dreamland again, huh, Dougie?<eos> Get the lead out, pal.<eos> Staff meeting starts in three minutes.<eos> - Mary. - Mm-hmm.<eos> Seven up.
Any drugs or medications?<eos> Have you taken anything?<eos> Case file.<eos> Come with me. Come on.<eos> Just a second.
You and I will have a talk.<eos> Okay?<eos> Okay.<eos> Cheers.<eos> To the FBI.
Jean Michel.<eos> Yeah, of course he loved it.<eos> Who wouldn't?<eos> What?<eos> Two.
You having fun with us, Bobby?<eos> Yeah, sort of.<eos> Go for it.<eos> We got to go back outside.<eos> Outside?
Never.<eos> You know why?<eos> Because I'm always one step ahead of you.<eos> And I always get away!<eos> Not this time.
What's up, Batman?<eos> Put this bomb in the museum.<eos> Certainly, sir.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - No worries.
Nope.<eos> Now it's snake clowns, because you put that idea in my head.<eos> - Sir?<eos> - Time for push-ups!<eos> One, two...
He needs to open his eyes and see what it feels like when you're not around. Okay?<eos> Yeah, Pippa. I couldn't put Zod in a regular prison, right?<eos> He's Zod. Come on!<eos> No, he needed to go someplace where he could never harm Metropolis ever again.<eos> The Phantom Zone.
- Mr. Wayne!<eos> - You want a picture?<eos> - That would be swell!<eos> Here we go.<eos> Party face!
- Sir?<eos> - Can I?<eos> - Of course.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - My pleasure.
Historically speaking, that is accurate.<eos> - He hasn't captured Riddler.<eos> - You know, she's right.<eos> He hasn't captured Bane.<eos> - Huh! - Or Catwoman.
Here to take that bad stuff off your hands.<eos> Wait, that's it!<eos> The Phantom Zone.<eos> The Phantom Zone?<eos> No way!
Hot-diggity-dog!<eos> Vehicle rotisserie engaged.<eos> Retrieving the Speedwagon.<eos> Atomic batteries to power.<eos> Turbines to speed.
Smash!<eos> I guess you're right.<eos> I am going up. Ding!<eos> Here comes the...<eos> Phantom Zone!
- Projector.<eos> Or there's no way<eos> - to blast these monsters...<eos> - Monsters.<eos> - ...back to the Phantom Zone. - Phantom Zone?
Talk in a really low, gravelly voice.<eos> And go it alone.<eos> Kid, don't do that.<eos> Atomic batteries to power.<eos> Turbines to speed.
Freeze, Clayface, take this guy out!<eos> Coming through!<eos> Okay, Alfred, bring the pain.<eos> Bringing it, sir.<eos> For Queen and country!
I found my sister living in Florida.<eos> Called her up.<eos> She's still a bitch.<eos> You want me to look someone up?<eos> Anybody.
The whole family died in a plane crash.<eos> Very sad.<eos> Uh, is that the one you're talking about?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Anybody else?
Hey!<eos> What the hell are you doing?<eos> I wanted to talk.<eos> I didn't know any other way to get to you.<eos> No way.
People grew strong and tall and lived into their 70s.<eos> Then, like, 10,000 years ago, they all got hit with the idiot stick and decided to start... farming', build cities.<eos> And everything went to shit.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Not me, though.
Honor the sacrifice of Shou-Lao the Undying.<eos> Well, okay then.<eos> Just remember to have fun along the way.<eos> All right, man.<eos> - Thanks for the food.
Are you sure?<eos> Very sure.<eos> Well, you seem to have gotten away.<eos> Yeah.<eos> This time.
no.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> My mistake.<eos> too.<eos> For... for what?
I'm Danny Rand.<eos> We'll talk about it in our next session.<eos> How's that?<eos> Keep practicing your kata.<eos> At least an hour a day.
I need to have these messengered somewhere.<eos> Hi.<eos> Me again. but I was hoping we could make a trade.<eos> yeah?<eos> What kind of trade?
Your sweaty, scowly, stick-up-your-ass thing.<eos> Wow, confidence builder.<eos> I can handle Patel by myself.<eos> Sit this one out.<eos> Not a chance.
You must honor it to the letter or there will be consequences.<eos> Yeah, I... I understand.<eos> - Kneel.<eos> - What?<eos> On your knees.
- Kneel.<eos> - What?<eos> On your knees.<eos> The, uh... the glass.<eos> Kneel.
The, uh... the glass.<eos> Kneel.<eos> Scissor punch!<eos> Scissor punch.<eos> Shuffle step.
- Yeah, it's, uh...<eos> It sort of means, like, uh, an outsider.<eos> - That's what they called me.<eos> - Sounds kind of mean.<eos> Sort of cool, too.
I've seen you on the news.<eos> Talk about a riches-to-rags-to-riches story.<eos> Yeah, it's been pretty crazy.<eos> You live in this city long enough, nothing surprises you anymore.<eos> Um... one sec.
- Oh, well, um... she...<eos> - We... we don't really...<eos> She gave me a couple of bucks when I lived in the park.<eos> I see.<eos> Oh, what the...
He's in a completely different world, Joy.<eos> He lives in ours now.<eos> Thank you.<eos> To the precious Buddha, the unsurpassable teacher.<eos> To the precious dharma, the unsurpassable protection.
He lives in ours now.<eos> Thank you.<eos> To the precious Buddha, the unsurpassable teacher.<eos> To the precious dharma, the unsurpassable protection.<eos> To the precious sangha, the unsurpassable guides.
I'm telling you, he punched through solid metal with his bare hands.<eos> His hands?<eos> Are you sure it wasn't his fist?<eos> I guess.<eos> Kneel.
- I don't wanna do this.<eos> You're doing great.<eos> He's... he's focused on you.<eos> Just keep calm.<eos> Just... just another minute.
It's where my father was taking us.<eos> Oh, Ward, I thought you might be stopping by.<eos> How did you know?<eos> How did you know<eos> - about the account?
I've seen you reread that letter at least three times since we took off.<eos> The handwriting is distinctly not feminine.<eos> He'll be glad to hear that.<eos> "He" is?<eos> Presently unavailable.
It's a shame how things turned out.<eos> Well, you get to be the hero who rights the ship.<eos> No.<eos> I'm talking about you and your sister working against each other.<eos> And over what, huh?
No, be specific.<eos> What would you do?<eos> - I'd eat ice cream for breakfast.<eos> - Really?<eos> Well, and lunch. Yes, sir.
There has to be a way to kill him.<eos> There is a legend about a shepherd from the village of my great-grandfather.<eos> He made an arrangement with the Hand, just like your father.<eos> He was killed on the battlefield.<eos> More than once.
What was it like?<eos> What?<eos> Death?<eos> It was like when I was a kid... coming home from school through the snow, and... and then I'd be standing on the porch, freezing, and on the other side was comfort.<eos> But this time...
they can be unpredictable.<eos> But we've gotta do everything we can to help him.<eos> Everything.<eos> That shouldn't keep us from getting Rand back... and turning it into what I'd always hoped for.<eos> Our family's legacy.
Who's "they"?<eos> Bakuto and his group.<eos> Your sensei?<eos> Our sensei.<eos> Everyone here.
Welcome.<eos> How are you feeling?<eos> Yeah, I'm, uh... I'm all right.<eos> Thanks for showing me how to heal her.<eos> Of course.
Oh, why wouldn't I be?<eos> Uh, I came to the penthouse.<eos> There was... there was blood everywhere.<eos> I thought Gao...<eos> - Oh, not a chance.
He's just finished a call, sir.<eos> To whom?<eos> Joy Meachum.<eos> And she passed the phone off to a Harold.<eos> Harold Meachum?
Did you talk to her?<eos> Manipulating as always.<eos> Working an angle.<eos> Trying to get me to question everything.<eos> Even you.
I move that we... reinstate the Meachums... and Mr. Rand.<eos> I second the motion.<eos> All those in favor...<eos> Aye.<eos> To family.
- Just make your hand glow or whatever.<eos> - She knows about the Iron Fist?<eos> I, um... I can't.<eos> Not right now.<eos> Okay, uh... hand.
Or Bakuto's.<eos> Danny!<eos> What are they doing here?<eos> Danny Rand!<eos> On the ground!
Oh, you destroyed my family!<eos> You're wrong, Harold!<eos> The funny part is that now I'm gonna kill you.<eos> You destroyed everything!<eos> My family!
You're wrong, Harold!<eos> The funny part is that now I'm gonna kill you.<eos> You destroyed everything!<eos> My family!<eos> Your family!
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.<eos> You got it?<eos> Fuck.<eos> - Fuck, man, you got it?<eos> - One second!
Stand by.<eos> Oh, God.<eos> Hey, Shane.<eos> We're going home, buddy.<eos> About fucking time.
His family won't even recognize him. Is that what you want, Ize?<eos> You should just answer my questions.<eos> All right, all right.<eos> So, tell me about Dean's scope.<eos> Oh, fuck.
You fucking was trying to hit me.<eos> No.<eos> The water bottle.<eos> Nobody's that fucking accurate.<eos> And your antenna.
What the fuck is going on with this shit?<eos> You fucker.<eos> You psychotic motherfucker.<eos> What do you want from me?<eos> Fuck!
Be honest with me, Isaac.<eos> Is it because of Dean?<eos> Just tell me how did you know how'd you know that name?<eos> Tell me one thing about him.<eos> Just one thing.
Bite on this, you fucking Hajji bitch.<eos> Come on, show me something.<eos> Send it, bitch.<eos> Fuck.<eos> Fuck.
Ize.<eos> I just want to have a conversation with you, Isaac.<eos> Why are you trying to get yourself killed?<eos> Isaac, are you there?<eos> Fuck.
No, no!<eos> - Captain Albright!<eos> - All due respect, Cap that's what y'all said an hour ago.<eos> Can I get an updated ETA?<eos> - ETA about an hour 20.
We all did some impressive book-cracking.<eos> Plus, you made it through a prison stint without throwing a single punch.<eos> I'm sure that was hard for a person with your...<eos> - I know.<eos> - Reputation.
Doctors are gonna tell you to stay positive.<eos> Your family's gonna tell you not to feel sorry for yourself.<eos> Your therapist is gonna tell you not to be angry...<eos> I'm already angry.<eos> At who?
Your family's gonna tell you not to feel sorry for yourself.<eos> Your therapist is gonna tell you not to be angry...<eos> I'm already angry.<eos> At who?<eos> Everyone.
Far as I know, nothing.<eos> They ghosted right after you left.<eos> If they got their hands in anything, it ain't stuff I've seen.<eos> Then who's recruiting kids out of Harlem and getting them killed?<eos> Kids?
Freeze!<eos> Danny!<eos> We have to go!<eos> Get on your knees, now!<eos> On your knees!
Time is not something I can afford to waste.<eos> Not for your benefit but for mine, I'm taking the blinds off.<eos> Try not to bite, old friend.<eos> It's undignified.<eos> Alexandra.
The money?<eos> That doesn't define me.<eos> Maybe not, but that kid is sitting in a jail cell tonight and you're not.<eos> - Neither are you.<eos> - Not this time.
You're the Hand.<eos> And I'm gonna make sure...<eos> Mr. Rand.<eos> I appreciate your candor.<eos> And your passion.
They wanted to use it to heal.<eos> But there were five heretics among them, people with darker intentions.<eos> They didn't want to heal.<eos> They wanted immortality.<eos> Power.
Determined.<eos> Mr. Rand, I'm sorry your exit from our meeting was so abrupt.<eos> You tried to kill us.<eos> Oh, them maybe.<eos> Not you.
A couple days ago, I'm the one who introduced you to Danny Rand.<eos> Yeah, and you also told me to focus on myself.<eos> Part of me wishes I had listened.<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> - For what?
Yeah, and you also told me to focus on myself.<eos> Part of me wishes I had listened.<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> - For what?<eos> All of it.
It's true.<eos> Why else would we be here?<eos> I'm here 'cause I'm a cop.<eos> Trust me, they don't give a shit.<eos> Just in case.
Twice now, she could've taken my life, but she hasn't.<eos> Why do you think that is?<eos> Your weapon is defective.<eos> Then she will be destroyed.<eos> Not on my watch.
Right.<eos> How come you didn't tell us?<eos> Wait a minute.<eos> What do you mean, "resurrected"?<eos> His ex-girlfriend.
- They want you to turn on me.<eos> Sowande wasn't lying.<eos> And how do you know?<eos> His heartbeat didn't waver.<eos> Not for a second.
We mean no disloyalty.<eos> Our goals are in alignment, as they have been for centuries.<eos> I am not so sure anymore.<eos> We must honor Sowande by continuing to fight for what he lost.<eos> Life itself.
If you'd listened instead of fighting us, you would've been around for the conversation.<eos> And I think you would've agreed.<eos> Midland Circle's suspect.<eos> Especially now that we found the hole.<eos> What hole?
I hunt the wolf.<eos> If you knew me at all, you'd know I always win.<eos> In the boardroom...<eos> Mr. Rand, I know I speak for all of us when I say how nice it is to have you with us again.<eos> This time, for good.
There's no need for explanations.<eos> What?<eos> These relationships grant us invisibility in our operations.<eos> Our back-room accords.<eos> Our political affiliations.
We are the law here.<eos> Or has New York gone completely insane?<eos> Captain, before you make any calls, I'd like to sidebar with my clients.<eos> Oh, you can do that... after I book them for obstruction.<eos> And you.
I know.<eos> What is this?<eos> I still have a key to your place, so I brought you a change of clothes.<eos> - Okay, thank you.<eos> - Anytime.
We don't have to fight.<eos> Fighting is all the Hand knows.<eos> I'm not the Hand.<eos> We've been used.<eos> Both of us.
I just came to talk.<eos> You started this.<eos> Ever since you burst into my office, my life has become one big kung fu party.<eos> I don't wanna fight you.<eos> Alone.
Drop it, or I'm dropping you.<eos> They're gonna destroy the city.<eos> Now tell me something I don't know.<eos> Once they get what they want, this place is gonna crumble.<eos> Not on my watch.
- The only way out of here is together.<eos> Danny, light it up.<eos> Now.<eos> - Remember this?<eos> - Just like old times.
Get you back up and running.<eos> Maybe.<eos> We'll see.<eos> What are you having?<eos> My fourth.
That's all there is to it.<eos> So I think the best thing to do is to find a guy who's got more money than you, like in that movie, uh, Indecent Proposal.<eos> You get a millionaire to bang her for a million bucks. She takes the money and runs.<eos> Would you sleep with her for a million dollars?<eos> No way.
Well, you know what, Frank, I'll figure it out, okay?<eos> Because I don't want my kid to grow up like I did.<eos> With some asshole dad who was never even around.<eos> You talking about me or Bruce?<eos> You!
It's not just a car.<eos> It is John Wick's car.<eos> Sir, why don't we just give it back?<eos> He killed my nephew.<eos> My brother.
He killed my nephew.<eos> My brother.<eos> And a dozen of my men.<eos> Over his car.<eos> And a puppy.
All freshly stoned.<eos> Well done.<eos> Could you do a rush order? I sure can.<eos> Where would you like to have it sent?<eos> The hotel.
How much help does it look like I need?<eos> It seems to me that the real question, Mr. Wick, is who in this cruel world of ours, is going to help you?<eos> There's a storm coming.<eos> Not just for me.<eos> For all of us.
Jonathan.<eos> Winston.<eos> Accounts payable.<eos> One one, one one, one.<eos> In one hour.
What country treasures their women?<eos> - What are you talking about?<eos> - What am I talking about?<eos> Mom, can I have a slushy?<eos> Yes, in just a minute.
W-what are you doing? Hey, w-w-what are you doing?<eos> What the hell was that, man?<eos> Wh-what, that fart?<eos> I'm just trying some new stuff.<eos> No, n-n-not the fart, no.
- I'm gonna... This is...<eos> He thinks she pops. - She's terrible.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Oh, Mrs. Kelly, Mrs. Kelly. - Mrs. Kelly, hold on. Just give me one second.<eos> - Ooh! One, two, three. - One, two three.
I will make it work, because I'm a genius.<eos> Now look at the... plant!<eos> Look at the plant.<eos> Now look at the globe.<eos> Up. Back to the plant.
The dream was to create a muscle-up energy drink - Yeah. - that gave you the power to fight like a crow!<eos> - Yes! - Men!<eos> Or women.<eos> But yes.<eos> But definitely - crow-power fighting skills.
I've seen a lot of things.<eos> A man wants to turn himself into a woman?<eos> Okay.<eos> Who am I to judge?<eos> But, really, a cat?
- Make a ton of mon...<eos> Yes.<eos> What?<eos> Hello?<eos> Goddamn it.
- Yeah, he's out.<eos> _<eos> I can't believe they have zombies on the final level!<eos> I love zombies.<eos> Ghouls, too.
- My life's the worst.<eos> You're so funny.<eos> Okay.<eos> - And cute.<eos> - Oh, son of a bitch.
Thank you.<eos> Now, let's go in this meeting and show this guy that he is making the right choice investing in the Mara brothers!<eos> You missed it, asshole. Huh?<eos> You missed it.<eos> The meeting.
Just being safe.<eos> You won't even notice they are here.<eos> Come on!<eos> - Everybody is looking at us.<eos> - Not us, you.
- Well, it is very bold.<eos> - How do you stand him?<eos> Do you know that he was an even bigger pain as a teenager?<eos> He got expelled from 4 different schools.<eos> - For brawling.
So you don't need me anymore then?<eos> We can try to find you something temporary.<eos> Could you fill in for Jack at this morning meeting?<eos> At the seniors' editor's meeting?<eos> Just for today.
Um. uh..<eos> So Anna.<eos> What do you think we should be publishing?<eos> Um..<eos> Newer voices.
How do you know that?<eos> How can I believe you, I don't even understand your need to dominate.<eos> I'm not a dominant. I'm not. The right term is a sadist?<eos> I get off in punishing woman. Woman who look like you.<eos> Like your mother.
What do I give Christian for his birthday?<eos> The boy already has everything except the sense of humor.<eos> Er.. his.<eos> His birthday. When is his birthday?<eos> Sunday.
Just turn it down. Okay.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You're shivering.<eos> I'll get you a sweater.<eos> Okay.
Yes, I did.<eos> - Your personal number!<eos> - What have I told you?<eos> - She needed it.<eos> - Every time!
- Pardon me for being human.<eos> We investigate, support services support!<eos> - Support services aren't there.<eos> - You can't do this.<eos> - Once before.
70, 80...<eos> How many men?<eos> Erm... fiftyish.<eos> There were 50 men at your party on Saturday?<eos> Yeah, at least 50.
I'm sorry.<eos> Porn!<eos> Why?<eos> It is something we're having to deal with<eos> - a lot more recently.
He's a lover.<eos> Would my mom have wanted me to go to this school?<eos> I can only guess.<eos> But I'll tell you what, she would have wanted you to have friends.<eos> Idiot friends?
It just so happens that I am good friends with the headmaster of the Oaks Academy for Gifted Education.<eos> He has always said that if I find that one in a million...<eos> And the one in a million has a $30,000 tuition.<eos> Mr. Adler, I can get your daughter a scholarship.<eos> Full ride.
And why.<eos> Oh, no! I love all my students.<eos> I don't believe you.<eos> At all!<eos> Not for a second.
Is it like the problems Mom worked on?<eos> Your mother didn't work on problems.<eos> She worked on just one problem.<eos> Just one?<eos> Her entire life?
Your mother didn't work on problems.<eos> She worked on just one problem.<eos> Just one?<eos> Her entire life?<eos> Most of it.
And on Saturday nights, we watch the UFC.<eos> The UFC?<eos> Is that...<eos> Is that Ultimate Fighting?<eos> Every Saturday.
That's what I've been calling him.<eos> That's really, really funny.<eos> Take her to the airport.<eos> Go home, Evelyn.<eos> Or Montana.
You know... I have no desire to hurt you.<eos> I hate it that we're at odds.<eos> We're always at odds.<eos> Yes.<eos> Hotel.
Until she's better than even you.<eos> But she must never know the truth... about what she is or how she came to be.<eos> Harder.<eos> You are stronger than this, Diana.<eos> Again.
Get that man!<eos> Now!<eos> If I can get these notes back to the British Intelligence in time it could stop millions more from dying.<eos> It could stop the war.<eos> War?
Now!<eos> If I can get these notes back to the British Intelligence in time it could stop millions more from dying.<eos> It could stop the war.<eos> War?<eos> What war?
Thank you for what you did on the beach.<eos> So you are here to let me go?<eos> I tried, but it's not up to me.<eos> I even asked them to send me with you..<eos> Or anyone.
Today you are my greatest sorrow.<eos> Should you have told her?<eos> The more she knows, the sooner he will find her.<eos> How long until we reach the war?<eos> The war, which part?
Probably because they're together.<eos> No... No..<eos> We're not together, I mean, in that way.<eos> This way.<eos> To the war!
Thank God! You're not dead!<eos> Hurray!<eos> I did think you're dead till I got your call, you know?<eos> He's been gone for weeks.. Not a single word.<eos> Very unlike him.
Besides Now I see your attention is elsewhere.<eos> Enjoying the party?<eos> I confess I'm not sure what it is we're celebrating.<eos> A German victory, of course.<eos> Victory?
- Get away from me!<eos> I understand everything now.<eos> It isn't just the Germans that Ares has corrupted.<eos> It's you too.<eos> All of you.
After everything I saw, it can't be!<eos> Can not be!<eos> They were killing each other.<eos> Killing people they cannot see. Children...<eos> Children!
Olena went to pick her up, to bring her back.<eos> Are this address and contact number correct?<eos> And are there any other family members we should inform?<eos> - No<eos> - Nobody?
My instincts told me that you wanted Jason.<eos> You wanted a big alpha sex bloke.<eos> A sex bloke?<eos> Yeah!<eos> A strong man.
How?<eos> Race for it.<eos> I already own it, bro.<eos> Not that car.<eos> Mine.
Neutralize their shooters, and then move on to our objective.<eos> There's two things I want you to keep in mind.<eos> Number one, I chose you for this squad because you are the most fearsome warriors on the planet.<eos> And number two, you go out there, you do your job, and you take 'em down.<eos> Everyone.
Before you judge the man, remember, you're breathing right now because he saved your life.<eos> You just gonna let her bump your shoulder like that?<eos> I'm just saying, that was a little aggressive.<eos> What you gonna do, email her?<eos> Check.
I thought his father should give him his first name.<eos> I'm sorry, Dom.<eos> There's nothing to be sorry for.<eos> Whatever happens, just save our son.<eos> Your son.
And theoretically' if you know the right people who know the right patterns...<eos> You can fly right through the blind spots completely undetected.<eos> So you know where Dom is headed?<eos> Yeah.<eos> New York.
Something about this whole thing that just doesn't add up to me.<eos> Well, that would be the same kind of funny math that says a DSS agent who has a Silver Star for valor stole an EMP.<eos> Sound familiar, huh?<eos> You want to give me a hand?<eos> On three? Yeah.
I'll take the shortcut!<eos> Look out!<eos> Watch those people!<eos> Big Sexy coming' through!<eos> Not this time, Dom.
Gates are open.<eos> Let's get this party started.<eos> EMP is recharging.<eos> How long?<eos> Sixty seconds.
and I wanna thank you all for never turning your back on me.<eos> You wanna meet them?<eos> All right.<eos> Everyone, meet Brian.<eos> To Brian!
When you first came back, you told me you loved me.<eos> There is no us.<eos> I'm investigating the sinking of a sloop called the Cornwallis.<eos> I want you to write an account naming Sir Stuart Strange as the man who organised the loading with slaves.<eos> For the safe.
You are forgiven.<eos> Take the helm.<eos> Aye aye.<eos> She's a good old girl.<eos> America, then?
And my father's debts amounted to a sum total of £215 and 17 shillings.<eos> Behold, £215 and 17 shillings.<eos> Mr Thoyt will pay each one of you exactly what you are due, but you will form an orderly line.<eos> You will form an orderly line.<eos> Orderly!
They can't kill you, but they will crucify your name... and crucify all those around you.<eos> But I don't keep anybody around me that doesn't deserve what they get.<eos> Does that include me?<eos> Yes, that includes you.<eos> Only half a man.
Just when I think it's empty, I hear a tiger roaring inside it.<eos> I want you to bring the trunk with my father's belongings tomorrow.<eos> I thought you might have gone.<eos> You mean you waited?<eos> For me?
Why don't you just fix the roof?<eos> Because a canvas sheet would protect the powder perfectly well and be much cheaper.<eos> And you think she's beautiful?<eos> Who?<eos> The actress.
Go away, Winter.<eos> I'm not scared of you.<eos> What are you scared of?<eos> Of who they say you are.<eos> The African devil.
You have no God, certainly no country.<eos> What do you have?<eos> Powder.<eos> When will you deliver?<eos> Tomorrow, at midnight.
Nothing.<eos> I strongly suggest you to continue to see nothing.<eos> Move!<eos> What's this?<eos> Cholera.
Mount up.<eos> We have him, men.<eos> Hurry up.<eos> Keep moving!<eos> To the heath!
You're among them now, aren't you?<eos> The ones who used to sing to me.<eos> Was it my hand...?<eos> Brace!<eos> God's sake.
For crime... it is.<eos> I have an alternative suggestion.<eos> In.<eos> I have a use for you.<eos> For the safe.
- Come on, Temple!<eos> Hello.<eos> I've been looking for you.<eos> I want her to forgive me.<eos> For what?
Only Atticus delivers.<eos> She's only ever taken one coach.<eos> Why?<eos> Because tonight she stabbed the Duke of Richmond.<eos> For what reason?
It is.<eos> How did you get inside?<eos> The hole in the fence over there.<eos> How far in there did you go?<eos> About 15 or 20 feet.
Dougie, it's 5:30. Where are you going?<eos> You've got the check, don't you?<eos> Yeah, you're all set.<eos> Where you taking him?<eos> Santino's.
Thank God Gordon stocks the plane from his own wine cellar.<eos> No, you'll be the one to tell her.<eos> Ignore the strange man.<eos> - Here's to the bureau.<eos> - To the bureau.
No, you'll be the one to tell her.<eos> Ignore the strange man.<eos> - Here's to the bureau.<eos> - To the bureau.<eos> To the bureau.
Yep.<eos> I'm in.<eos> I'll brief you in detail in the morning.<eos> To Tammy and the Blue Rose.<eos> The Blue Rose.
I'm in.<eos> I'll brief you in detail in the morning.<eos> To Tammy and the Blue Rose.<eos> The Blue Rose.<eos> The Blue Rose.
How are you? Hanging in.<eos> I will have the usual.<eos> Okay.<eos> - Get that right up for you.<eos> - Thanks. Yeah, no problem.
And just cheese.<eos> Who ordered just cheese?<eos> Idid.<eos> It's all old business, Chad, from long before your time.<eos> Up the mountain.
We're supposed to check the furnace.<eos> You wait for the delivery.<eos> Don't forget to sign the invoice.<eos> I'm gonna go check the furnaces.<eos> Bloody Mary.
Me too.<eos> But I was hoping you'd consider swapping the barn for your old room?<eos> Fine.<eos> You win.<eos> But just this once.
- Now?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> You could just leave the cart outside.<eos> Coffee?<eos> At this hour?
You're gonna be okay.<eos> - I think I'm dying here.<eos> - No, I won't let that happen.<eos> Toby, can I kiss you?<eos> Just one last time.
I was at the stables this morning with Toby.<eos> Well, maybe you can convince him to stay for a while.<eos> Yeah, I think I'd like to try.<eos> - Thanks again.<eos> - Of course.
I will not go, Tëm.<eos> Comrade Colonel would not let walk?<eos> Zadolbali have their orders.<eos> Though it would be sent somewhere.<eos> On a business trip.
Comrade Colonel would not let walk?<eos> Zadolbali have their orders.<eos> Though it would be sent somewhere.<eos> On a business trip.<eos> Jupiter!
Helps!<eos> Come on, come on, come on.<eos> Faster.<eos> Turn on the light.<eos> One, two...
Thank you.<eos> Sfotkatsya him, I'll kill you, you understand?<eos> Hey, wait, where are you?<eos> Zdrastye.<eos> B gyemotologiyu.
And not as a specialist in extraterrestrial cultures.<eos> - Let go?<eos> - Where?<eos> !<eos> In the rear.
Documents to present, then go wherever you want.<eos> What are you talking this obdolbyshem?<eos> Gruzi ego come on.<eos> Arms!<eos> Second.
You're in the army, Haritosha?<eos> - I did not serve.<eos> - So tomorrow, you go to the border.<eos> Homeland guard!<eos> On the submarine.
Cool that.<eos> Previously, there generally no one steamed.<eos> Now all just talk about us.<eos> These...<eos> Journalists complete.
Change is necessary.<eos> Do not worry.<eos> (Video) - will kill you all one by one.<eos> You mark my word!<eos> Everyone!
Tëm Che do?<eos> - Collect all.<eos> - Yeah...<eos> Yes...<eos> All...
To her.<eos> All go.<eos> Let's go to.<eos> We Roos in a garden walk.<eos> All my life together.
It means so.<eos> Listen to me.<eos> You are there on the spot.<eos> Act as he sees fit.<eos> Under my responsibility!
I can't find where to plug it into the television.<eos> I'm sorry, Mr. President.<eos> I'm afraid I don't know a whole lot about technology.<eos> I'm sure I could have somebody come by and take a look at it for you.<eos> Fuck it.
Just a heads-up so you can prepare yourself mentally.<eos> It's a big one.<eos> Meetings the next day.<eos> Then we got the night free.<eos> - And then to Berlin.
Shit.<eos> Right, I should do that.<eos> What room am I in again?<eos> - 517.<eos> - What?
I mean, there's nothing out there.<eos> I'm just not quite clear what it is you're trying to control there.<eos> Apart from nothing.<eos> You see this map, Frank?<eos> This one, hmm?
I don't mean to be rude, Mr. President, but it is imperative that you begin to take a leadership role here.<eos> We cannot win this thing alone.<eos> Without your active involvement, our presence here will never be anything more than a foreign occupation.<eos> This is your war.<eos> For your country.
- Give me your fucking gun!<eos> Ortega!<eos> What's going on up there?<eos> What the fuck's going on up there, guys?<eos> Cover!
- Such a good show tonight.<eos> What do you think she's gonna do with her advantages?<eos> I don't fucking care.<eos> Ah, and look who's here.<eos> Hey, twice in one week.
Uh, I just got tickets for Madonna tonight.<eos> - Wanna come? - Mmm.<eos> - Madonna, really?<eos> - They're free.<eos> - What time?
Excuse me, Tim.<eos> Hello.<eos> Uh, I was wondering if there was any chance of getting out a little early tonight.<eos> - We've only got, like, five pages left.<eos> Eh, sure enough.
But, you know... oh! Hold on, these are my "Hamilton" tickets. - I've seen it four times.<eos> Yes? - Mm. Okay.<eos> I'll see you in there.<eos> Here, come meet my best friend.<eos> Hey, Bill.
I'm sorry.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Your hair... no, get it out of your beautiful face.<eos> I can still call you baby-cakes, can't I?<eos> Not in public.
Don't yell at me.<eos> You know what?<eos> I'm a lady and I've never said this to anybody, ever, in my entire life, but I'm gonna say it to you.<eos> You can go fuck yourself on the head.<eos> Right on the head?
- Will you please? - What?<eos> Chloe.<eos> Abby, come on.<eos> This is so Renata.<eos> On the very first day of school?
- That is not true.<eos> - Yeah, it is true.<eos> Ed, I shouldn't have to constantly run into the guy.<eos> Monterey has 30,000 people, and I can't go to a goddamn yoga class without seeing him and her?<eos> And yoga?
- That's all you'll get.<eos> - Whoa.<eos> Yeah, Ziggy, I did come here with dreams of a certain life.<eos> You are right.<eos> Hopefully a better one.
- Hi, Tom. - How are you?<eos> - Everyone's making me angry.<eos> - I'm sorry to hear that.<eos> - Except for you.<eos> - And me.
At least as much as I can remember.<eos> We always served this when we had friends to visit.<eos> We didn't come to visit.<eos> We're looking for someone.<eos> A friend of ours.
I can't see a thing.<eos> It's got to be down here somewhere.<eos> Found it!<eos> It's remarkably similar.<eos> To what?
We broke the sword for nothing.<eos> Wait, if that was back in 1943, where's he been all this time?<eos> Douglas kept looking.<eos> He found a scientist that he thought could help him.<eos> Three of them.
And then the strangest thing happened.<eos> What?<eos> I thought I saw him.<eos> It's like something opened right there in the middle of the room.<eos> Just for a moment.
I'm not dead yet.<eos> I think they put that there to protect me.<eos> Glad to see you're obeying hospital protocols.<eos> Your daughter asked me to treat you.<eos> In exchange for what?
Looks painful enough.<eos> You know we never did have that second date.<eos> Still thinking about how to prove the Riemann Hypothesis?<eos> I'm thinking about a dead kid I met in Canaan.<eos> Dead?
Try and talk to him.<eos> Mr. Ghost Rider?<eos> Mr. Rider?<eos> We'll let you out if you tell us how to get our friends back.<eos> Everyone.
Parrish.<eos> Remember how I thought that the Ghost Riders - were scared of him?<eos> - At the party?<eos> I think that he was actually trying to communicate with him.<eos> On your knees.
Remember how I thought that the Ghost Riders - were scared of him?<eos> - At the party?<eos> I think that he was actually trying to communicate with him.<eos> On your knees.<eos> On your knees.
Hey, hey, Parrish, Parrish, stop!<eos> No!<eos> Yeah, we need to do something.<eos> Yeah.<eos> On three.
It wasn't his brain.<eos> Mr. Douglas ate his pineal gland.<eos> It couldn't have been Theo.<eos> These murders have been going on for weeks.<eos> Guys.
Tell you what?<eos> What are you talking about...<eos> Tell me about my son.<eos> Tell me one thing about Stiles that you remember.<eos> Just one.
You swipe that key card, I'll tell you anything you want.<eos> Sheriff.<eos> They are coming.<eos> One thing.<eos> Just one thing!
You ready?<eos> Wait, are you kidding?<eos> Us against five Ghost Riders?<eos> - We can take 'em.<eos> - Five of them?
I feel completely hopeless.<eos> Just, please, let me out.<eos> I can't.<eos> - Where does this take us?<eos> - The hospital.
Just, please, let me out.<eos> I can't.<eos> - Where does this take us?<eos> - The hospital.<eos> Hospital?
Theo?<eos> I'm fine.<eos> Just, just thought I was somewhere else for a second.<eos> Where?<eos> In a bad dream.
They come by storm and they take people.<eos> He's a Nazi.<eos> He wants the Hunt for himself.<eos> Everyone from the bunker has been taken.<eos> Everyone?
I can't explain it.<eos> I have to show you.<eos> Uh, all right.<eos> You guys stay here.<eos> Just in case.
Then he's here.<eos> We have to tell Scott.<eos> We should probably tell Scott about that, too.<eos> He can't take both of us?<eos> No way.
No, you were gone for three months.<eos> I was... What?<eos> Okay, if they don't let me graduate, I swear to God...<eos> - What are you looking for? - Ah! This.<eos> And him.
Or don't they listen to you?<eos> I am your leader.<eos> Obey me.<eos> Kill them.<eos> All of them.
Well, I'd have to kill an Alpha.<eos> Liam.<eos> Since you're taking over, the most important thing you can remember is that Mason is always gonna be the one who's there to save your ass all the time.<eos> Well, not all the time.<eos> Most of the time though.
You... you found her.<eos> You know this woman?<eos> Um, there was an accident, and she... she stepped in front of me.<eos> You killed her.<eos> This woman.
This woman.<eos> I tried to help...<eos> Witch.<eos> You killed the Mistress of the Eastern Woods,<eos> The Most Merciful and Stern.
I think it's time that my people are reminded what Oz used to be.<eos> Yeah.<eos> What witches... used to be.<eos> That lunatic hopes to embarrass you.<eos> Us.
From everything.<eos> I may not be his mother, but I feel what all mothers feel.<eos> - What's that?<eos> - Fear.<eos> All the time.
- Why?<eos> - Because you could hang for it.<eos> It's a black elixir, it's magic.<eos> It disturbs your true nature.<eos> My true nature?
You were right.<eos> About the Giants.<eos> I can't, bring them back.<eos> No, even if you could raise them, they won't kill The Beast Forever.<eos> Not this time.
Perhaps I should be pretty?<eos> People like pretty.<eos> I think people generally prefer nice.<eos> - Mice?<eos> - Nice!
It's all right.<eos> This man here has a grievance.<eos> You've lost someone.<eos> Her mother.<eos> My wife.
You ready to work?<eos> I don't want to forget.<eos> Not anymore.<eos> Well, what do you want?<eos> Your magic.
The Princess owns you.<eos> - You ready to work?<eos> - I don't want to forget.<eos> - Well, what do you want?<eos> - Your magic.
She should have taught you how to tell the truth!<eos> I'm not lying!<eos> I'm not lying!<eos> I don't know her!<eos> Your own mother?
Release him!<eos> No.<eos> Your men were right about me.<eos> I killed them.<eos> All of them.
- Stay back.<eos> What?<eos> Just give me the gun, and I'll answer all your questions.<eos> No.<eos> - One bullet, then.
Just give me the gun, and I'll answer all your questions.<eos> No.<eos> - One bullet, then.<eos> - A bullet?<eos> One.
- One bullet, then.<eos> - A bullet?<eos> One.<eos> As a gesture of trust.<eos> One bullet.
I did this.<eos> Roberto, what about him?<eos> You killed him, Frank!<eos> His name was Roberto.<eos> Your father.
Come on, Sylvie.<eos> Quick stop, and then we have to keep moving.<eos> Look at her.<eos> She's so free.<eos> For the moment.
You don't know what opposes you or how to stop it.<eos> I haven't known that since I got here.<eos> Why can't you just be honest here?<eos> You're afraid of what this is...<eos> Us, me...
We were born to fly.<eos> There's no way out.<eos> I've been looking for months.<eos> How often do they check on you?<eos> Twice a day.
Twice a day.<eos> So they can get in here?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Sometimes there, sometimes here.<eos> Sometimes this wall.
Then don't come back until you are.<eos> Where is your baby's father?<eos> Murdered by the Wizaed.<eos> The Wizaed?<eos> Why?
Just rip it...<eos> Rip it out of me, please.<eos> You must do that.<eos> Take my life.<eos> Hers.
The wizard has oppressed the magic that is your birthright...<eos> Its seeds sown into the fabric of this land.<eos> No one can take that away from you.<eos> Fight with me to rise again.<eos> To emerald city.
But this time, it's the truth.<eos> And the truth will do us both some good here.<eos> Karen Chapman was hurt... Because I wanted her dead, because I sent my men to kill her in Kansas.<eos> I thought she was gonna return to oz.<eos> For Jane.
- Sheriff called again.<eos> Needs you to come down to the station and make a statement.<eos> - I don't know what to tell him.<eos> - Just tell him the truth.<eos> - The truth.
I think it's dinnertime.<eos> Let's get you something to eat.<eos> What should we make?<eos> Pizza.<eos> No, not pizza again.
Um, well, I...<eos> I just... - I thought...<eos> - Well, maybe we could swing by afterwards.<eos> How late will the party be going until?<eos> 3:00.
There will be wine waiting for you.<eos> We're gonna go work on our noseslides now.<eos> - Bye, Daddy.<eos> - Bye.<eos> All right, outside.
When they started following you, everybody else got burned.<eos> In your name.<eos> Happy fucking Easter.<eos> No...<eos> A word.
I want to hear you fucking say it, so say it.<eos> Wednesday.<eos> Fuck that guy.<eos> Why?<eos> Why me?
They can have it back when they pray for it.<eos> Do you believe?<eos> I believe.<eos> What do you believe, Shadow?<eos> Everything.
My Dad's claim to fame.<eos> He was beat by Jesse Owens in the qualifying round for the Berlin Olympics in 1936.<eos> Those were the ones where ...<eos> - Owens won in front of Hitler.<eos> Yes, what a moment, what a moment.
I come here only to share bread and information.<eos> What you choose to do with the latter is entirely up to you.<eos> Already he's spitting on my rug.<eos> Just a few moments of your time, while my man here helps the ladies prepare a delicious meal I'm sure.<eos> For old times' sake.
Her husband works for the railway, she's at home alone all clay...<eos> Oh, this one for sure.<eos> What do I owe?<eos> Coffee and omelet, 2.50.<eos> One second.
Coffee and omelet, 2.50.<eos> One second.<eos> We're all going to die.<eos> You will, having a shot for breakfast every day...<eos> Not every day.
You alright?<eos> How you doin'?<eos> - No!<eos> - On the floor!<eos> On the floor!
Anything, ask if we're okay...<eos> Sorry, I'm on edge.<eos> I just wanted to charge my phone, I don't come to these places.<eos> What "places" do you mean, honey?<eos> This kind of bar.
This place too lowdown for you?<eos> They even took the blood.<eos> The pool of blood is gone.<eos> Look, cutie-pie, my bar's cleaner than any place you go, because it's mopped with bleach every day.<eos> Every day!
You want to open it'?<eos> - Open it and we're all screwed.<eos> - Shut up!<eos> - Ignore him, Israel.<eos> - Shit yeah...
I got a signal!<eos> What do I do?<eos> Call?<eos> - Call the police?<eos> - Not the police.
- No. No, no.<eos> - God damn it!<eos> - Let's go.<eos> - C'mon.<eos> One...
Look at them, the happy couple.<eos> If it's a boy, call him Israel, like me!<eos> And if it's a girl, Trini, like the old duck!<eos> Barn!<eos> Right in the face!
Wha...<eos> Travis thinks that he's in love with me.<eos> Everything okay?<eos> My parents want me to think about moving home.<eos> To London?
The clinic... it doesn't count.<eos> I'm not getting credit!<eos> What?<eos> My entire year was a waste.<eos> A complete waste!
- What if he takes a hostage?<eos> Marius: Don't fucking look at me.<eos> Get down!<eos> Drop it! Drop it now!<eos> On your knees!
He got through to you, huh?<eos> Sent you a warning or a little message or some code or something like that?<eos> Huh? How did it go down, Eddie?<eos> How'd he do it?<eos> Richard: My phone.
Or, you know, just throw the map away and I'll never know... or will I?<eos> You see, in case you're tempted to break the rules, understand I did make a copy of these tapes, and I left them with a trusted individual who, if this package doesn't make it through all of you,<eos> This was not a spur of the moment decision.<eos> Do not take me for granted.<eos> Not again.
You've arrived at my first house in this shitty town... where I threw my first and only party... and where I met Justin Foley... the subject of our first tape.<eos> It was just a party.<eos> I didn't know it was the beginning of the end.<eos> Justin, you were in love with my friend Kat.<eos> My only friend.
Okay, I can call you back.<eos> No!<eos> I...<eos> I mean, uh, what problem were you having trouble with?<eos> The one about the, uh... trains?
Two trains leave at different times, but when do they meet?<eos> Oh! I get it. Um...<eos> Train "A" is leaving my house in a few minutes.<eos> Train "B" is leaving your house...<eos> In 30 minutes.
It has been almost two weeks since we sat for dinner together as a family.<eos> I am nothing if not a realist, so I am proposing that we have family breakfast every day instead.<eos> We just each have to get up a little bit early.<eos> How early did you have to get up?<eos> Yesterday?
What, like in the world?<eos> Or with you.<eos> Yeah.<eos> You could drop by our office later, if you want to make a full report.<eos> Our office?
Look at our little Clay, all grown up.<eos> So, do you want one now?<eos> Oh, right.<eos> Uh...<eos> A small drip, please. Black.
And the guys already thought that we were, and I wanted to.<eos> You know?<eos> I-I loved her.<eos> And it did piss Jessica off, but not at me.<eos> At Hannah.
Drink your 40.<eos> Alex, you're up, man!<eos> Oh, yes, I love it, I love it.<eos> Freak versus geek!<eos> Time trial.
Drinking on a school night?<eos> Riding your bike while drunk?<eos> I'm sorry about that.<eos> How much did you drink, son?<eos> Just one beer.
Marcus, what are you doing?<eos> The costume contest. Two hundred bucks.<eos> Here... what are you doing out here?<eos> I heard you, man.<eos> The car alarm.
I need you to print a few for the tribute issue.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - Can you get them in time?<eos> Yeah, I'm already started.<eos> That one.
- Okay.<eos> - Can you get them in time?<eos> Yeah, I'm already started.<eos> That one.<eos> That one.
- Can you get them in time?<eos> Yeah, I'm already started.<eos> That one.<eos> That one.<eos> This candid.
Yeah, I'm already started.<eos> That one.<eos> That one.<eos> This candid.<eos> This one.
Did he know Hannah Baker well?<eos> He says he didn't.<eos> Either way, it's had such a terrible impact on everyone.<eos> Hence... you.<eos> Yes, me.
- You got a new car?<eos> - You got a new car?<eos> I upgraded the lease.<eos> It's a simple trade.<eos> - For the same payment?
Hurt who?<eos> Do you remember the winter dance, the one you deejayed?<eos> Sure.<eos> You remember that song you played, that one slow song?<eos> That one slow song?
No.<eos> I'm asking whether you knew if Hannah Baker was bullied.<eos> Why Hannah Baker?<eos> My firm was hired today by the school to defend them in the lawsuit that the Bakers have filed.<eos> Your firm?
That was really fucked up.<eos> What did you say?<eos> I said thanks for helping me.<eos> That was really nice.<eos> Oh. Sure.
You're finally gonna get what you deserve.<eos> It's about time.<eos> What?<eos> I said let me know if you need to talk.<eos> Any time.
Hey, I'll be right back, guys.<eos> Hey.<eos> Hey.<eos> Uh. What you reading?<eos> A book.
And you never know how what you do will affect someone else.<eos> Hey, Bryce, what's up?<eos> Hey, Jensen.<eos> And if that goes for me, it must go for everyone.<eos> Even cheerleaders.
Interesting.<eos> Well, I can tell you that our financial aid tends to go to students at the top of their class, with SATs above the 90th percentile.<eos> Great.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Of course.
So what, are you gonna tie me up to a tree and force me to listen to the rest of the tapes?<eos> No, we're just going for a little walk.<eos> How little is little?<eos> Just up that hill.<eos> No freaking way.
Don't get what my grade school diaries have to do with anything.<eos> Well...<eos> First, there's a bunch of gifted child drama I won't get into.<eos> The main thing is, you have to tell the truth in poetry.<eos> Your truth.
You were there.<eos> You saw her.<eos> You should publish this.<eos> Oh, no.<eos> No way.
Hope you saved some good ones.<eos> You snooze, you lose.<eos> What?<eos> What are you staring at?<eos> Ah, nothing.
I know your son.<eos> - I'm sorry?<eos> - Clay.<eos> He visited the house.<eos> And the store.
There is one more story to tell... one more bad decision... and this one's all on me.<eos> No... it wasn't the decision to go to the party.<eos> Because how could I have known?<eos> But it was the same night.<eos> That same awful night.
It doesn't matter what I say it is.<eos> 'Cause there are three people who aren't here who are likely to say whatever they want.<eos> Where are Jessica and Justin?<eos> They weren't at school.<eos> Either of them.
No one's going to believe you.<eos> People'll just laugh at you, like they always do.<eos> They won't.<eos> Hannah's truth is not my truth.<eos> No way.
Through my old neighborhood, where the houses were nicer than the one we lived in now.<eos> All the way up to the hill where the rich people live.<eos> Where you live.<eos> And from blocks away, I heard it.<eos> The music.
They won't be back for a week.<eos> So, what do you want? Like, an eighth?<eos> Yeah?<eos> Indica or sativa?<eos> Um, hybrid.
Here.<eos> Right out there.<eos> A week before she slit her wrists and died at home, you raped her.<eos> She came to my party.<eos> Mine.
Come here.<eos> No, no, no, no.<eos> No.<eos> She wanted me.<eos> Me.
Remember how side "B" was blank?<eos> Yeah.<eos> It's not blank anymore.<eos> She wanted me.<eos> Me.
It's just rust.<eos> Nah, I fucked up my hand last night.<eos> Jesus!<eos> Who'd you hit?<eos> Ah, just the wall.
Right now.<eos> Lost.<eos> I guess.<eos> Sort of empty.<eos> Empty?
Yeah, I don't feel anything.<eos> Like...<eos> I don't care anymore.<eos> You don't care about what?<eos> About anything.
Like...<eos> I don't care anymore.<eos> You don't care about what?<eos> About anything.<eos> School.
I don't care anymore.<eos> You don't care about what?<eos> About anything.<eos> School.<eos> Myself.
You don't care about what?<eos> About anything.<eos> School.<eos> Myself.<eos> The people here.
About anything.<eos> School.<eos> Myself.<eos> The people here.<eos> My parents.
Someone made this stupid list.<eos> "Best of, worst of" thing.<eos> And people have been reacting to it ever since.<eos> When was the last time?<eos> A week ago.
That's fine.<eos> Tyler, honey, it's time to go.<eos> Tyler?<eos> Are you in there?<eos> Just a second.
- we'll find them.<eos> - Sweet.<eos> We split up and put these things within five miles of the lair.<eos> Let's do this, team.<eos> Oh, man.
The King is very proud.<eos> ♪♪<eos> ♪♪<eos> Ezekiel: This is life here.<eos> Every day.
That's why I need you.<eos> I can't take them alone.<eos> We're gonna hit them with the guns first... and then the Molotovs.<eos> Then back to the guns until they're dead.<eos> Why the fire?
Oh, I know it.<eos> After, we get half of what's won.<eos> Oh, you'll get a third.<eos> And we're taking back what you just stole from us.<eos> Half.
Oh, you'll get a third.<eos> And we're taking back what you just stole from us.<eos> Half.<eos> A third.<eos> Half.
Half.<eos> A third.<eos> A third, and we keep what we stole.<eos> Half of the jars, the ones we took.<eos> One time, this time.
What about potato chips?<eos> We got chips.<eos> Number 42 makes them.<eos> Number 42 is a coding system for persons here?<eos> For the workers, yeah.
I'm Negan.<eos> Daryl isn't like you.<eos> He's... emotional.<eos> So he's either on his way home, or he's coming back here to try to kill some more of us.<eos> Mostly you and me.
You'll find out.<eos> You are gonna want to pay close attention to this.<eos> Ohh!<eos> No, no, no, no!<eos> Why?
Said pills aren't for Amber.<eos> Said pills are for Negan.<eos> That's why you wanted two.<eos> Didn't he kill your friends?<eos> Several.
You asked for a lot of guns.<eos> That's what this is.<eos> Enough to fight your fight.<eos> Us? Nearly twice.<eos> Need nearly twice.
And all that is a fairy tale, too.<eos> Don't bring that "Your Highness" shit our way.<eos> Now, I appreciate that you've been delivering, but... things have been unnecessarily tense, and that makes me unnecessarily tense.<eos> I didn't go this route for stress.<eos> No. Just the opposite.
I hear your concern.<eos> Mm. I'm not insensitive to it.<eos> - Mm. - Right?<eos> If you're having problems of that nature... come to see me.<eos> Anytime.
Sasha.<eos> That is a beautiful name.<eos> Get Sasha here a new T-shirt.<eos> I'm sorry you had to see that.<eos> Sorry 'bout the rope, too.
It doesn't matter.<eos> You can't.<eos> Go! Go!<eos> The arsenal!<eos> On the ground.
Get some people in here. Clean this up.<eos> What?<eos> You didn't actually think I was gonna let you keep this, did you?<eos> You still got a ways to go before I'll believe you're fully on board here.<eos> Baby steps.
She's lying down.<eos> I hit her pretty hard.<eos> Thanks for saving my life before.<eos> And the other time.<eos> Oh, and then the other time.
Maybe a couple others -- tops.<eos> But not you and not most people.<eos> We are gonna help solve some shit.<eos> Tuck in.<eos> Big day.
I'm gonna kill Carl, and then Lucille here, she's gonna take your hands.<eos> You can do it right in front of me.<eos> You can take my hands.<eos> I told you already -- I'm gonna kill you.<eos> All of you.
Uh, what should I pay them with?<eos> Their payment is the honor they'll feel to serve their...<eos> Wait. Who's paying me to yell at this guy?<eos> I can answer that...<eos> For money.
Goodbye.<eos> Why don't we end this game?<eos> How much do you have?<eos> Sixty thousand and small change.<eos> New deck.
- What about back pay?<eos> - In your account by morning.<eos> You know me.<eos> I must cash the cheque first.<eos> To the airport.
Red as spilled blood<eos> Wedges of cranes have flown<eos> Away o'er my head<eos> Never took they me along<eos> To far-off lands
Is that why you ended up here?<eos> I asked him.<eos> A favour for a friend.<eos> - Couldn't do any worse?<eos> - Not at the time.
It's a lot of money.<eos> - A heck of lot.<eos> - And it's just sitting there on the books which-- - Can't have that.<eos> - Okay then well, thanks for coming in.<eos> - Of course.
Still real nice.<eos> - But small, only like 10 people.<eos> - Ah but you went?<eos> - We had some meetings.<eos> - The next day.
"Give me the car."<eos> - No, that's not, that was you tricking me.<eos> - Ray.<eos> - How much did you get for them anyway?<eos> - The whole collection?
They always meet in the MS. I'm assuming it stands for Midnight Sun.<eos> Laszlo Hindemith.<eos> Geologist.<eos> Recently arrived at the, err,<eos> Research Centre.
She's in a special unit, inside FARC, on life support.<eos> They don't think there's any chance she's ever going...<eos> Dan.<eos> Dan!<eos> Help!
Child labour, mass executions, there are reports of cannibalism.<eos> Eric I, I don't see...<eos> The barman says he spoke of it.<eos> Hindemith?<eos> All the time.
- It's gone.<eos> I can see that.<eos> Then why did you ask?<eos> We think it's been taken.<eos> Like the other one.
Two days later, fully recovered.<eos> She got First.<eos> What was her name?<eos> What do you mean, what was her name?<eos> This "friend" or yours, erm.
The taxidermist?<eos> We can't be sure of that.<eos> But the taxidermist killed the geologist.<eos> We're not ruling that out.<eos> - But not the shop girl?
Let me know.<eos> If you feel yourself getting angry, just remember it's all about getting along for Abigail's sake.<eos> I'm gonna be fine.<eos> I took a little something.<eos> Just a half.
No, I'm being serious.<eos> She said if a seven-year-old can be sold to sex slavery, then no one would bat an eye if a white, rich American girl would sell hers online.<eos> - This is for real?<eos> - Look, it's not gone live yet. And we have no intention of letting that happen. Obviously.<eos> - Of course not, no.
- Was it all just bullshit?<eos> No, it's not.<eos> And I'm not gonna give you some long song and dance about how precious and sacred your beautiful body is.<eos> But it is not for sale, Abigail.<eos> Not ever.
- Hi, Ziggy.<eos> I'll be seeing you in a few hours, okay?<eos> - Okay.<eos> - Thanks again.<eos> - No problem.
Eventually, we'll need to garner support to help incite Nassau to revolt against the governor, but what we need right now is information.<eos> How many soldiers there are, what kind of sympathy exists for our cause.<eos> I know.<eos> Thank you.<eos> - What for?
And I began with the captain.<eos> I was more deliberate with him.<eos> It took some time.<eos> Then I moved to his first mate.<eos> The gun captains.
I was more deliberate with him.<eos> It took some time.<eos> Then I moved to his first mate.<eos> The gun captains.<eos> Gun crews.
Again.<eos> Again.<eos> - Heave!<eos> Heave!<eos> Him next.
And he's the only one who touched it, only one who bit it.<eos> His saliva.<eos> So, when you test it, you know that it's uncorrupted.<eos> Test it for what?<eos> Canine DNA.
- Hey, Chief, you there?<eos> - Go ahead, Tommy.<eos> The church was doing baptisms and these kids poisoned the water.<eos> You should probably get down here.<eos> On my way.
You gotta talk.<eos> Talking helps.<eos> You killed someone?<eos> Yeah.<eos> A, um... a woman.
He thinks if I go over that bridge, the magical spell that woke me from my slumber will break and I'll go back into a coma.<eos> Listen, I know Matt can get carried away, but his heart's in the right place.<eos> He's writing a book about you.<eos> He what?<eos> A book.
Burt Lurdsman.<eos> - What?<eos> - Is the name.<eos> His name. The sponsor I told you about.<eos> Potential.
What can we do for you, friend?<eos> Mr. Stussy, what a day.<eos> What a day.<eos> I was hoping to show the boys their new office.<eos> Their...
No.<eos> That's not...<eos> For information, I'm saying.<eos> See, he was my stepdad.<eos> Sort of, for a time.
Yeah, pop a squat.<eos> Can I get two beers?<eos> - You want two beers? - Um...<eos> Think I'll just have a diet pop.<eos> "Diet pop."
Suspect.<eos> LeFay.<eos> Some kinda freak accident.<eos> Air conditioner fell on him, just...<eos> Like a pancake.
There you go.<eos> Using three-syllable words again for a one-syllable problem.<eos> First, that's a two-syllable word...<eos> Let me tell you what I saw in fallujah.<eos> Men, okay?
Emmit, are you gonna...<eos> The point is, stussy lots ltd. Are in the process of securing $50 million in new loans.<eos> Now, we're gonna use that money to buy 16 more lots, after paying some healthy bonuses to the partners, of course.<eos> Sy: You're talking about doubling the size of the company in six months?<eos> -Three months.
Whether you step off the board with one foot or two, you still end up in the water.<eos> Sy: Okay.<eos> But what about the IRS?<eos> You said yourself, he's sitting in the conference room right now, going over the books.<eos> Some books, not "the" books.
Some shady dealings.<eos> Guys like your brother, fat cats, making secret moves, looking for quick returns.<eos> What do they care if a wad is legit or not?<eos> Didn't you say he was having money trouble a while back?<eos> In the crash, yeah.
I know, I know.<eos> That's not the plan.<eos> But... Thanks.<eos> Heck, you don't get where I am by sticking to the plan.<eos> - Hmm. - To new friends.
That's not the plan.<eos> But... Thanks.<eos> Heck, you don't get where I am by sticking to the plan.<eos> - Hmm. - To new friends.<eos> New friends.
Traffic enforcement.<eos> - Traffic enforcement.<eos> - Yes, sir.<eos> Gloria Burgle, Chief of the Eden Valley police.<eos> For about another week.
- Easy, son.<eos> Put the syringe down, on the floor, slowly.<eos> - He was doing something.<eos> - Quiet.<eos> On the floor.
Have you been to this place before?<eos> The bowling alley?<eos> Is that what you see?<eos> Oh...<eos> Cheers.
We're gonna visit the parole office today either way, face the hiring brother.<eos> And see if you can't track down this Vanessa who rented the apartment that lost an airconditioner.<eos> I'm thinking they might be connected.<eos> What do you think?<eos> Bigger size.
Tears, were there?<eos> She left, and took the motherinlaw.<eos> So, whatever leverage you think you have...<eos> He's gonna pay.<eos> For what?
That, plus the 10 you stole, puts it 50.<eos> My thought, then, is you should leave the state.<eos> Two hundred.<eos> And we want the stamp.<eos> For what?
Like you whack a tennis ball back and forth.<eos> Killed him where?<eos> In the den of a shithole apartment.<eos> Framed picture-puzzle in the wall, like some six-year-old, so proud, he had to hang it up.<eos> Christmas Eve.
No? Well...<eos> You got it?<eos> Yes.<eos> I have it, but I'd like to offer you something else instead.<eos> A job.
I looked in his eyes.<eos> My Ray.<eos> Who never got to say goodbye.<eos> Who you left bleeding on the floor, sadness in his eyes,<eos> your own brother.
You believe in nothing so you have nothing.<eos> You are on a path... from nothing to everything.<eos> You had something recently.<eos> You lost it.<eos> - My... my wife.
Well, let me remind you.<eos> What have you done?<eos> I can taste you on the rain.<eos> What else can I taste?<eos> War.
Very best part of memory is it's mostly about forgetting.<eos> We remember what's important to us.<eos> I wonder what'll be the first thing that drifts through your mind when you look back on this evening?<eos> Snow, I bet.<eos> Room 55.
I told you, brother, if you don't come to your parole officer, your parole officer will come to you.<eos> - Dude, I reported.<eos> - Really?<eos> That's funny because I just left the halfway house where you were supposed to live, and they told me they have not seen<eos> - your ass for a week.
I want to be an eagle.<eos> You've got one chance.<eos> You meet me in my office today at 2:00 p.m. not 2:01, not 2:03 but 2:00 p.m.<eos> Now say it back to me.<eos> - 2 p.m.
You know, I'd love to, but I got to go get that paycheck.<eos> Have them send it to you.<eos> You know, Grandma, I think I am going to have to skip lunch.<eos> I... They'll probably want me to have to sign for the...<eos> - for the check.
Because whether this baby's yours or Adam's...<eos> Come on, girl.<eos> Come on, girl.<eos> Just put it down on that...<eos> - that desk over there.
I never did say it, but thanks.<eos> For getting me off Eros.<eos> I wouldn't have made it without you.<eos> Thanks for the lift.<eos> And the cancer.
And until we do, that is too important to destroy right now.<eos> Well, I'm not keeping it on the Roci.<eos> I won't take that risk.<eos> I sure as heck don't want to share a bunk with that.<eos> - Hell no.
Here's what I see, okay?<eos> You seem kind of like a trigger-happy whack job to me.<eos> So, let me lay it on the table for you, all right?<eos> You shot my friend,<eos> like some street rat.
- I need a favor.<eos> - Of course you do.<eos> I need the transcript of a call placed between these two numbers<eos> - within 24 hours of this date.<eos> - No way.
- within 24 hours of this date.<eos> - No way.<eos> Just listen.<eos> This is a call between an FBI agent and his informant.<eos> - Definitely no way.
View's the same.<eos> Moshe chose this spot so the Arabs could see us every day and know we're never leaving.<eos> I remember that, too.<eos> That's Daniel.<eos> His 7th birthday.
That it was just a loan for travel.<eos> Sekou?<eos> Is what I say here really privileged?<eos> Absolutely.<eos> One-hundred percent?
No, tell me, how am I supposed to get out?<eos> The government has offered a plea bargain.<eos> But I'm not guilty.<eos> All that matters is if they can convince a jury you are.<eos> How long?
Unfortunately, that's not an option.<eos> Mossad can't be trusted to be even remotely objective on this, and the accusation is too serious to ignore.<eos> Well, what do you suggest?<eos> You recommend somebody absolutely trustworthy to represent US interests on the ground there.<eos> Like you, for example?
Look, Pittsburgh was different.<eos> Those were drug dealers.<eos> Those were murderers.<eos> They got what they deserved.<eos> But not Sekou.
All he keeps saying is "Just get him to take the money, get him to take the money."<eos> So it wasn't to give to a man in Africa?<eos> You can fix this.<eos> You can tell the truth.<eos> The truth?
Sure.<eos> I don't know.<eos> I'm trying.<eos> Call me if you need anything.<eos> Anytime.
You saved me.<eos> Yes.<eos> Why?<eos> What's going on?<eos> What the...
Don't you think we should've had this conversation before you did the deal with Conlin?<eos> A win is a win, Reda.<eos> Can't we just leave it at that?<eos> Maybe.<eos> This time.
- Thank you.<eos> Thank you.<eos> - Hey. We'll chat later.<eos> - Mr. Hashem, thank you.<eos> My pleasure.
Yeah, you did.<eos> - You're telling me, hey.<eos> - Real lucky.<eos> - Yeah. - No one gets out.<eos> - Mnh-mnh. - Not for terrorism stuff.
I told you, the deal was to keep your mouth shut.<eos> I never agreed to that.<eos> I never signed anything.<eos> Well, then you're opening yourself up to re-arrest.<eos> For what?
I never signed anything.<eos> Well, then you're opening yourself up to re-arrest.<eos> For what?<eos> Exposing an FBI informant, for one thing.<eos> That asshole?
- Across the street, for weeks now.<eos> I have proof.<eos> We're in! No!<eos> Move in!<eos> On the ground!
I really need to see him.<eos> Yeah, I got that.<eos> Your guy's not here.<eos> They took him straight to Bellevue.<eos> - The psych ward?
- My fault?<eos> - Yeah, your fault.<eos> - You missed it.<eos> - Missed what?<eos> This guy.
So, even if we had such information...<eos> You do.<eos> Why is the CIA asking the SVR about Israel?<eos> Not Israel.<eos> One Israeli.
Nothing's for nothing.<eos> Come on, Viktor.<eos> That isn't our arrangement.<eos> Like all arrangements, it's subject to review, surely.<eos> Not this one.
- No!<eos> Get on the ground!<eos> Get down!<eos> Now!<eos> On the ground!
Yeah, there's some psychological issues.<eos> Including violent outbursts.<eos> He hated it at the V.A.<eos> Still, you moved him into your house.<eos> No, in-into the basement.
The people.<eos> W-What people?<eos> The people who... built the bomb.<eos> What do you mean, the kid?<eos> No, not the kid!
That's what they said.<eos> But she has been, finally.<eos> And I owe it all to you.<eos> You still love it, don't you?<eos> - Victory?
No phone.<eos> Nothing.<eos> I don't get it.<eos> His phone led us here.<eos> Yeah, right to this floor.
You needed to be educated.<eos> So now I'm supposed to believe this.<eos> It was a gift from a doomed man.<eos> He wanted us to have the truth.<eos> The truth.
That's not true.<eos> Not enough to prosecute, according to him.<eos> He says that the only way to bring down Dar... is by prosecuting the breach in the Berlin station under the Espionage Act.<eos> You told them about Berlin?<eos> Weeks ago.
Where are you going?<eos> Come back here!<eos> Actually, don't consider this an interrogation at all.<eos> It's a reprimand.<eos> For what?
Vehicle's coming your way.<eos> All units, target heading up the ramp.<eos> You're cleared hot to engage.<eos> Say again, sir.<eos> Engage?
Say again, sir.<eos> Engage?<eos> He tried to kill the President-elect.<eos> Take him out.<eos> In position!
Thank you.<eos> Well.<eos> You look like shit.<eos> Apparently there's some debate as to whether I'm allowed a razor.<eos> Or visitors.
- He ran past you? - Mm-hmm.<eos> You mean he was running away?<eos> He was killed by a sniper, right?<eos> Where-- where-- where was he shot?<eos> In the back.
Joking.<eos> It was just that we all came running back in to help and there's nothing to do.<eos> Bed 3.<eos> Guy's been waiting for a plastics consult<eos> - for over an hour.
You know, one of those agencies, and, uh...<eos> Right after we reconnected, she was shot.<eos> For the first time.<eos> Hey. Hey, that's just a coincidence.<eos> Every time.
- Well, looks like you owe your resident a steak dinner.<eos> Oh, I'm a vegetarian.<eos> Oh. Then an expensive chickpea salad.<eos> Look, the fracture runs along the anterior skull base<eos> - through his cribriform plate.
You wanna gloat?<eos> It's not really my style.<eos> I prefer a quiet, self-congratulatory smugness.<eos> I wanted to apologize.<eos> For what?
But he wasn't with you when you were stabbed. No. Why did you stop strolling together?<eos> I think he... he went to prepare for a meeting.<eos> Where?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Back to his room, possibly.
[Hiccup] This changes everything.<eos> [horn tooting]<eos> -[snoring] What the...<eos> -[Tuffnut through Thunder Ear] Good...
Will you come with us, please?<eos> I can explain everything.<eos> No, no, no, I don't want you to explain fucking anything.<eos> I want you to get the fuck off my property and...<eos> What the...?
- What are you doing?<eos> I borrowed your duct tape.<eos> They would've seen it if I walked through the scanner.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Why?
No, not yet.<eos> We have a question for you first.<eos> - Just one.<eos> - You wanna know why I brought Kevin with me.<eos> My boyfriend.
He was a broadcaster in the Sydney Games.<eos> Had quite the touch.<eos> He was a decathlete back in the '80s.<eos> Medaled for Australia.<eos> Ah, yeah! Yeah, the bronze.
Thus, the confusion.<eos> So, you take no responsibility for your only son giving his life for the sins of mankind?<eos> Seems a lot to ask somebody.<eos> Then what do you take responsibility for?<eos> Dinosaurs?
So, you take no responsibility for your only son giving his life for the sins of mankind?<eos> Seems a lot to ask somebody.<eos> Then what do you take responsibility for?<eos> Dinosaurs?<eos> The Black Plague?
Dinosaurs?<eos> The Black Plague?<eos> Mount Everest?<eos> The Mona Lisa?<eos> - The sudden departure?
I only have hundreds.<eos> Give me, um... give me your cigarettes.<eos> Congratulations, Nora Durst.<eos> You are now officially my patient.<eos> Same time next week?
What are you doing right now?<eos> Where are you?<eos> I'm just hanging out.<eos> By yourself?<eos> On the anniversary?
Identity confirmed.<eos> Stop right there!<eos> Stop!<eos> Down!<eos> Down on the stairs.
- I wouldn't!<eos> - And yet here you are.<eos> Knowing full well what is inside of you, you kept moving forward towards this very room and the one person powerful enough to take it out.<eos> I think you should tell him about the book you wrote.<eos> What book?
I gave you my word. I intend to honor it.<eos> This fight ahead does not belong to you, nor to your children.<eos> I won't have you bear any more of it.<eos> Would you consider joining me?<eos> To London?
Well, take her!<eos> Yes, my love.<eos> Get up.<eos> Get up!<eos> On your feet.
On your feet.<eos> Get up!<eos> Come on, Mil, what you waiting for?<eos> Come on, get up!<eos> On your feet.
Yes.<eos> Yes, of course.<eos> Let me know when it's done.<eos> Heave!<eos> Heave!
How do you suggest we do that?<eos> I am prepared to surrender the governor's remaining forces to you... control of the fort, its guns, its magazine, the unconditional release of the remainder of your prisoners.<eos> All of it.<eos> - You're prepared to do all of that?<eos> In exchange for what?
I am prepared to surrender the governor's remaining forces to you... control of the fort, its guns, its magazine, the unconditional release of the remainder of your prisoners.<eos> All of it.<eos> - You're prepared to do all of that?<eos> In exchange for what?<eos> In exchange for the cache.
Jealous?<eos> Look, Coriolanus...<eos> I know you got your start on Sesame Street...<eos> Through!<eos> Through the old rebar.
I know you got your start on Sesame Street...<eos> Through!<eos> Through the old rebar.<eos> Over!<eos> Over the nails!
My apartment's so big, I can- - Gosh dang it!<eos> Why don't our shins have butts?<eos> I know it seems like you're just having fun, but you let someone back in your life who's-- who's bad for you.<eos> It's holding you back.<eos> Who, me?
What happened?<eos> We don't know.<eos> - We just saw him lying here.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Help!
I remember you from Taiz.<eos> Food poisoning, right?<eos> I'm never gonna live that down, am I?<eos> Andy, you saved my life today.<eos> A couple of times.
Yes. 35 millimeters.<eos> Is that enough?<eos> Yes, yes.<eos> You see what I.V. goes into him?<eos> Probably midway up his arm.
Isaac.<eos> What the hell do you want?<eos> To talk.<eos> Well, I'm busy.<eos> Just for a minute.
Please?<eos> Untie me.<eos> Khasan would never allow it.<eos> Just call the police.<eos> The police?
You're smart, Isaac.<eos> You know, I got faith in you.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Thank you.<eos> For what?
Well, welcome to your lucky life.<eos> Come with me, and I'll show you the delightful features of your home.<eos> This is the kitchen, where you may help yourselves to meals.<eos> I expect you to keep everything gleamingly clean.<eos> "Gleamingly"?
Sails!<eos> The Walrus.<eos> They escaped the harbor ahead of their landing.<eos> Change of plan!<eos> Back to the ship.
We're not leaving.<eos> If it's Madi that concerns you, we could send someone out to find her. We wouldn't be leaving her behind.<eos> Madi and Flint will either find their way back here or they'll find a place to hide.<eos> But even if they were here, we cannot retreat.<eos> Not with our numbers.
Thank you!<eos> I... will grab it for Daphne.<eos> I'm having dinner with Travis tonight.<eos> Dinners out, apartments... sounds like all you're missing is...<eos> A job?
- No, it's fine.<eos> Is everything okay?<eos> Yeah, I'm just gonna go meet Travis on campus.<eos> We're gonna carpe some diem over breakfast burritos.<eos> This early?
- Oh.<eos> - No, wait a second.<eos> Luca's already here.<eos> Why doesn't he stay?<eos> For the wedding?
I don't know what information you were privy to...<eos> I appreciate your concern.<eos> Come back when you like.<eos> I may be able to help you get back inside.<eos> Back on the council?
You know of me all I can bear to be known.<eos> All that is relevant to be known.<eos> That is to say, you know my genuine friendship... and loyalty.<eos> Can that be enough and there still be trust between us?<eos> Again.
Get the fuck up and sail.<eos> All is well?<eos> I thought I heard it.<eos> Thought you heard what?<eos> A woman.
Hernando?<eos> Hernando.<eos> - What?<eos> - It's coming.<eos> In the room.
- Yes?<eos> - Yeah, I love it.<eos> - It's ours.<eos> - It's twice.<eos> - Twice?
- It's ours.<eos> - It's twice.<eos> - Twice?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Twice.
- It's twice.<eos> - Twice?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Twice.<eos> Twice.
Maybe that's what makes it bearable.<eos> What happened here?<eos> Ihadjustgot off the train... thought about getting on another... when I saw him.<eos> Who?<eos> My father.
Do you believe in happy endings?<eos> What?<eos> I couldn't hear.<eos> Someone asked if they believe in happy endings.<eos> Miraculously, yes.
- No.<eos> Did they...<eos> Love you.<eos> Do I believe in happy endings anymore?<eos> Help!
I'm one of those silly people who believe that if you kill someone, you should be tried for it, whether you're a psychopath, a policeman or a president.<eos> You're worse than a liberal.<eos> Oh, Daya, may I have some of the Dal?<eos> Dad, the Dal... phenomenal.<eos> One second, one second.
But ultimately, all that power testifies to one thing.<eos> - What?<eos> - How afraid they are of people like you.<eos> Right now, all we can offer you is a little... invisibility.<eos> E-Death.
Cubed.<eos> Eight?<eos> Eight.<eos> I've been hoping you would come back, so I could say thank you.<eos> Why?
What do you think about the risk itself?<eos> Your life is either defined by the system... or by the way you defy the system.<eos> Wolfgang?<eos> Fear never fixed anything.<eos> To courage.
Gotta go! Gotta go!<eos> Oh!<eos> No! You idiots!<eos> No! Outside!<eos> Outside!
- But what?<eos> You were out all day, you slept on the couch...<eos> Are you mad at me?<eos> No.<eos> Or me?
If I had a good show, I'd always try and leave a little gift somewhere.<eos> - Like what? - Mm...<eos> Money.<eos> Drugs.<eos> Music.
Nomi, help.<eos> Will, it's going to be fine.<eos> The ID held up.<eos> In England.<eos> Outgoing.
- That won't happen.<eos> - Why not?<eos> Because these products are shipped to distant places.<eos> We would never risk the lives of our own people.<eos> Which places?
We would never risk the lives of our own people.<eos> Which places?<eos> Out of India.<eos> You know, like China or Africa, faraway places.<eos> Like Kenya?
You continue to impress, Officer Gorski.<eos> Wait, if Whispers wanted you lobotomized, then who stopped the surgery?<eos> The only person in BPO with more power than him.<eos> - Are you talking about...<eos> - The Chairman.
And I can't get a job because I don't have an agent.<eos> Why don't I have an agent?<eos> Because he could see what you both refuse to see.<eos> One of these days, that shit-for-brains is going to realize that dropping you was the sorriest, stupidest mistake he's ever made.<eos> Not a mistake.
I love listening to men trying to express their feelings.<eos> I think you can understand that I have thought about marrying her.<eos> Was that before or after you came inside me?<eos> Do you believe you can ever really know someone?<eos> Some people.
For what you did to me...<eos> I should have killed you.<eos> I was going to...<eos> but then I heard everyone talk about it.<eos> Us.
And her voice singing "Happy Birthday"... ♪ Happy Birthday, dear Nomi ♪ ...was the first thing I heard.<eos> It was in that moment... my sister taught me what "family" actually means.<eos> So, Tom... treat my sister well, because if you don't...<eos> - I swear I... - ...will find you.<eos> To Teagan.
Fuck.<eos> I know I'm going to win.<eos> I can smell my victory.<eos> Oh, no.<eos> - Oh. - Ha!
Wait. Hold on.<eos> Security protocol has been activated.<eos> It's not reading.<eos> I'm going to have to call this in.<eos> On your knees!
End of the line!<eos> Don't forget, rally this weekend!<eos> It's gonna be off the chain!<eos> Rally.<eos> This weekend.
Rally.<eos> This weekend.<eos> Off... the... chain!<eos> Rally around.<eos> This weekend.
Vegan.<eos> What makes you think I'm a vegan?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Everything?<eos> All of it?
Always a lovely word to hear, but I'm not some deputy anymore.<eos> Oh, no.<eos> Uh, I get that and respect it.<eos> But we both know why you're not a deputy anymore, so I am asking you to do this one for me.<eos> As a final courtesy.
What, then?<eos> I understand that we are in a temporary moment of separation and no longer in the mode of telling each other our day's events in detail.<eos> If we'd been communicating that well before, we might still be together.<eos> Are we putting that on me?<eos> Half of it at least.
For instance, if I had suddenly received a $5 million lump-sum payment the same day that my husband dropped an investigation on the man making that payment,<eos> I didn't see how that... sequence of events might appear.<eos> Is that an apology?<eos> I didn't mean to put your reputation in question.<eos> Not just my reputation.
I didn't see how that... sequence of events might appear.<eos> Is that an apology?<eos> I didn't mean to put your reputation in question.<eos> Not just my reputation.<eos> My job.
Is that an apology?<eos> I didn't mean to put your reputation in question.<eos> Not just my reputation.<eos> My job.<eos> Perhaps my freedom.
I didn't mean to put your reputation in question.<eos> Not just my reputation.<eos> My job.<eos> Perhaps my freedom.<eos> Perhaps yours.
Not just my reputation.<eos> My job.<eos> Perhaps my freedom.<eos> Perhaps yours.<eos> Freedom? Pfft.
Yeah.<eos> Come on.<eos> Thanks.<eos> You've been served.<eos> With a lawsuit.
I'm not allowed to ink clients at the shop yet.<eos> I'm just an apprentice.<eos> Yeah, uh, but apparently that doesn't mean much here.<eos> My boss is a little territorial and even if I did get her on board, I still need someone to work on.<eos> You?
Mr. Macallan, this is Deputy Director Michaels from the NSA.<eos> I'm literally in your office.<eos> I believe we had a meeting.<eos> There's been raids as far up as New York and down to the panhandle.<eos> As of now,
Yeah, do you remember?<eos> I still have a scar on my ass where my dad lost hold of his belt mid swing.<eos> - Caught me with the buckle.<eos> - Bullshit.<eos> - Which part?
Pappy Van Winkle.<eos> A lovely gesture... but I'm afraid my trainer has made me promise to abstain.<eos> You see, if I let myself get fat, then the girls will only want me for my money.<eos> Well, I'll leave you to your game then, huh?<eos> For the whiskey.
But even if he doesn't see you take it, how is he not gonna see that it's gone?<eos> Because I'm gonna switch it out.<eos> Look. He won't notice the difference?<eos> - No. He's gonna be too distracted.<eos> - By?
Boom!<eos> He fires off a shot at us.<eos> What the fuck?<eos> You know?<eos> Just one.
Knight takes rook.<eos> That's check mate in 15.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Cheers!
That's check mate in 15.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Cheers!<eos> And again.
Thank you.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Cheers!<eos> And again.<eos> Cheers!
Cheers!<eos> And again.<eos> Cheers!<eos> - One, two, three.<eos> Cheers! - Cheers!
He was going to tell Dr Amory, have you taken off the project.<eos> - That's why you killed him.<eos> - I had to. I had to kill Neilsen.<eos> She spoke to me.<eos> Through the computer, through JASON.
Alan, even great men make two or three critical mistakes in their lives.<eos> You don't get where I'm sitting by only making two or three mistakes.<eos> It's the choices you make today that will determine your future.<eos> All you have to do is say "yes."<eos> "Yes" to what, exactly?
May be bigger now. I don't know.<eos> His name's Charlie.<eos> - Charlie, huh?<eos> - I have things to trade.<eos> Valuable.
You see... you... you have a mental picture in your head, right?<eos> Of me holding you tight.<eos> And close.<eos> Oh, it was about the keys?<eos> - The keys? - Mmm-hmm.
Hello?<eos> Isn't it, like, time for dinner or something?<eos> I'm hungry.<eos> Anybody?<eos> Nothing.
Yeah, well, I get paid by the line.<eos> - I have a good feeling about this.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> Rory's gonna deliver that sample.<eos> Right to your lab.
Eighteen... Nineteen... 20 degrees Celsius.<eos> Nothing.<eos> Update?<eos> I'm gonna try a different atmosphere.<eos> Closer to Proterozoic Earth than today's Mars.
- It's gripping the glass.<eos> Okay, okay.<eos> Little sod.<eos> How hard is it holding on to you?<eos> - Like a firm handshake.
Did she close that valve?<eos> Yeah, yeah, she closed it.<eos> Okay.<eos> What other way could it get in?<eos> The thrusters.
We're off it now.<eos> Oh, come on, Zelda, for real.<eos> It feels like I haven't been back here in ages.<eos> Tell me about you. And Montgomery.<eos> And Livye.
This is going great.<eos> Let me try.<eos> Wow, swallowing has its privileges.<eos> - Wow, it looks like...<eos> - A major drought's hit.
- Yeah, we're gonna be bald as eggs.<eos> Skinheads.<eos> You... you... You just ought to ought to go to...<eos> Bent thinks you should take up salsa.<eos> Salsa, Bent.
How do you say...<eos> "My alarm clock fucked up?"<eos> You idiot!<eos> I hate my life.<eos> Allora.
Just go with him.<eos> One, two, three, cheese!<eos> Let me see!<eos> Let me see! Let me see!<eos> Just a second.
Sounds tough.<eos> - See? - Mm?<eos> You know what Italian word I love? Allora.<eos> I don't even know what it means.<eos> Allora.
You know what Italian word I love? Allora.<eos> I don't even know what it means.<eos> Allora.<eos> People say it all the time.<eos> Allora.
Look, I took a three-hour train to get here.<eos> If there's anything they can do, I'll sit anywhere.<eos> I'll sit in the dishwasher.<eos> Um, yeah, I-I'll see what I can do.<eos> Um... Allora, uh...
We don't have room.<eos> Uh, well, you can tell that was negative.<eos> Um, hold on.<eos> One more idea.<eos> Allora.
Like, this'll be the same as if you were just eating here anyway, only now both minorities will be sitting at the same table.<eos> Okay.<eos> Yes.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Allora...
Found it on Craigslist.<eos> Your accent is terrible.<eos> Bollocks.<eos> It's "bollocks."<eos> - Bollocks.
Not now, let's go.<eos> Thanks, bye.<eos> Bye.<eos> Bye.<eos> Allora...
Do you see him?<eos> No.<eos> Great job, detective.<eos> The fuck that guy kiss his phone for?<eos> Allora...
Yes.<eos> Dev! My photo!<eos> My photo! I want my photo! Dev!<eos> I'm sorry, Mario.<eos> Just a second.
And yet, knowing that, you threw me right in there anyway.<eos> Well, after the professors of Princeton, your father is a whoop and a holler.<eos> I like him.<eos> If I were the judge, I would lock you in a tower<eos> - like a princess.
Come on, now, please.<eos> Just a minute.<eos> Okay?<eos> I owe you one, by the way.<eos> For the grenade thing.
Just a minute.<eos> Okay?<eos> I owe you one, by the way.<eos> For the grenade thing.<eos> What grenade thing?
And that's what Clara Ward, a CIA officer, who was also stationed in the area, found out and shared with Senator Wilkes.<eos> Soldiers?<eos> Soldiers fight for their country.<eos> What you mean is you just follow orders.<eos> For money.
- Shut up.<eos> - Just say it already.<eos> I don't think we could have pulled it off without the new guy.<eos> What the hell.<eos> To the new guy.
Thanks for coming.<eos> Of course.<eos> Is everything all right?<eos> I owe you an apology, Asha.<eos> For what?
Thing is, Mejia wasn't even there.<eos> But his son, Miguel, was.<eos> Our friend on the train do this?<eos> Yep, while saving the life of an undercover DEA agent.<eos> Mike Hall.
- And now you know.<eos> - And tomorrow?<eos> - What about it?<eos> And the next day?<eos> And the next day?
Carlos Mejia contracted a hit on Bryan Mills' sister, so Mills could feel the same pain Mejia felt after his son was killed.<eos> Now he's hired mercenaries to bring Mills to him alive.<eos> You left out the most important part.<eos> Using Mills gives us our best opportunity in ten years to take Mejia alive.<eos> Our only opportunity.
- Your tie.<eos> How long do you think you can keep running, Bryan?<eos> A day?<eos> Two?<eos> A week?
I'm no use to them dead.<eos> - Do it now!<eos> - Let him go!<eos> He killed my son!<eos> For my sister.
He didn't open any of the photo attachments between Hodgins and me.<eos> Not that you and Arastoo do that.<eos> Or... do you?<eos> We do not.<eos> Not over e-mail.
The victim was a teenager?<eos> That's not at all consistent with the others.<eos> And he's missing the entire lower half of his body.<eos> I'm just saying, in case you missed that...<eos> little detail.
Just spit it out, will ya?<eos> I was just wondering if you were open to having another forensic anthropologist consult on the case.<eos> Booth, she wants to give Zack access to the case file.<eos> No.<eos> No way.
- What did he say?<eos> - He sold his book.<eos> Oh, that's wonderful, Miss Zelda, just wonderful.<eos> And he proposed?<eos> New York?
- Lester.<eos> Trudy!<eos> Blimey, Trude, good job they let me out for good behaviour.<eos> - You?<eos> Good behaviour?
Things are moving rather fast.<eos> In that case, she should be at the hospital or the maternity home.<eos> She was unable to make her way to either.<eos> We will assess the situation here and see what we should do.<eos> Clinical room, straight away.
That was years ago, when Mickey was a baby.<eos> And I put my own head in the oven.<eos> I never tried to pretend that was Lester.<eos> It occurs to me, Mrs Watts, that you may wish to apply for custody of your children, in which case...<eos> Custody?
I never tire of looking for the look upon your face.<eos> Is it going to be excited Pats, or happy Pats?<eos> Sad Pats or troubled Pats?<eos> But I love all of those girls.<eos> Even this one.
Any clues as to cause of death?<eos> The paramedics think he died of natural causes.<eos> He had a history of heart problems.<eos> Heart attack?<eos> Six months ago.
I believe Mayor Richards was in attendance this morning?<eos> Yes, sir, yes, he was.<eos> Then, can I ask, are you treating him with suspicion at this stage?<eos> No, sir.<eos> Quite the contrary.
Yes.<eos> We're going on a little trip.<eos> Officer Myers, I'm waiting.<eos> So... how's your morning been, Commissioner? Anything untoward?<eos> Untoward?
Here we are.<eos> Yes.<eos> To us.<eos> Yes.<eos> To us.
And I assume you want us to...<eos> Yes, I do.<eos> But, first, Dwayne, JP, I might need you to go on a little hunt.<eos> What for, Chief?<eos> A mobile phone.
You're kiddin' me, huh? Geez.<eos> Get off my partner.<eos> Come on, let's go.<eos> Thanks for showing up, Aubrey.<eos> Anytime.
In here, I am spiteful and petty.<eos> I'm sorry I lost.<eos> No.<eos> Thank you.<eos> For everything.
But you have a duty to the American people...<eos> I am going to Santa Barbara, lie on the beach.<eos> We need to talk to Fitz.<eos> What he says, how he plays this out over the next couple of days - is gonna be critical.<eos> - No. Maybe Spain.
Caribbean awaits, Robin.<eos> We got to get a move on.<eos> Look, you think you can get in, huck, to the tip line?<eos> Easy.<eos> 832 tips right here.
This is our only option.<eos> Chef said you didn't eat dinner.<eos> I'm not hungry.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> For what?
Oh, it's not my plan, boys.<eos> It's Lady Caine's plan.<eos> Did he say Lady Caine?<eos> See, 18 years ago the princess was taken from Corona, and it was because of her the king unfairly cracked down on all those he considered undesirable.<eos> Us.
Wow!<eos> They're unbreakable.<eos> Want to know the weirdest part?<eos> This is where they found the miracle flower that saved your mom.<eos> And me.
But try to follow along.<eos> This is all your fault.<eos> What?<eos> You see, after your untimely disappearance, Your father locked up every criminal in the kingdom, including a simple petty thief.<eos> My father...
I'm gonna call the police.<eos> Hello?<eos> I dug up Michael's grave.<eos> He's not in it.<eos> He...
It wouldn't, but...<eos> Let's fight back.<eos> I don't know who we're fighting.<eos> Let's go to Yemen and find out.<eos> To Yemen?
Well, I'm doing a fundraiser for my dad and I'd love to wear something new.<eos> Mona showed me some of your designs on her phone.<eos> They're terrific.<eos> Well, you should come by the studio.<eos> - Studio?
They're terrific.<eos> Well, you should come by the studio.<eos> - Studio?<eos> - Mm-hmm.<eos> Your studio.
I'll talk to you tomorrow?<eos> Oh, we never got around to discussing the menu for you and Ezra.<eos> Yeah.<eos> That's okay.<eos> Next time.
- What happened?<eos> - Um...<eos> Nicole found the book.<eos> And she threw it at you?<eos> No, at her parents...
That A.D. stopped playing games and started playing God.<eos> A.D. stole Emily's eggs from the donation bank fertilized them and then used them to impregnate Allie.<eos> - What?<eos> - God, it still sounds crazy.<eos> Guys...
I don't know why we ever bothered to go cake tasting.<eos> I don't know, should we split the last one?<eos> Uh, no, no, no.<eos> Let's, let's save that.<eos> For our first anniversary.
'And, sorry, I didn't ask first' but last week was so crazy, I just wanted to put my energy into something positive.<eos> I remember these.<eos> Your mom saved a lot.<eos> She packed everything in tissue paper.<eos> Even your baby clothes.
No, it isn't.<eos> Look, I'm not saying I don't understand why you would want him dead.<eos> But it's my job to figure out who broke the law, not why.<eos> Okay, but can't you just stop being a cop?<eos> Just for a minute.
Why'd you come back here if you already had the book?<eos> Because there's a second book.<eos> One that was done much later.<eos> It turned the idea of vengeance into a game.<eos> A game?
I've seen pictures of Caleb when he was a little kid too.<eos> I think we can make something pretty good together.<eos> It's not like making a lasagna.<eos> Okay, I'm just saying, I've been thinking about it.<eos> A lot lately.
People don't like the truth.<eos> The truth is slippery.<eos> Can't depend on it.<eos> Try it.<eos> Just for a minute.
Who would I tell?<eos> I just really wouldn't want Detective Furey to find out about this.<eos> - Alright.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - Of course.
Do you remember when these used to be our phones?<eos> Like, a million years ago?<eos> There was so much less to worry about.<eos> I'm really sorry that I involved you in this mess.<eos> Which mess, in particular?
Like, a million years ago?<eos> There was so much less to worry about.<eos> I'm really sorry that I involved you in this mess.<eos> Which mess, in particular?<eos> All of it.
- Whoo!<eos> - Alright.<eos> 'That's it for tonight, folks.'<eos> 'You want me to get next week?<eos> ' 'Same time, same place. Same feet.'
We only tossed condiments but that's so sweet of you, honey, thank you.<eos> Um, I have one more closet to tackle before we take a dinner break.<eos> Will you join us?<eos> No, actually, II really can't stay.<eos> Another time then.
You know everything in here is just a manipulative ploy.<eos> - Peter...<eos> - She'll suck you in.<eos> And before you know it, make you share responsibility for all...<eos> For what?
I would marry you right this second if we could find a bear who's licensed.<eos> Whoa!<eos> When did you pick up this habit?<eos> Well, I came prepared.<eos> Just in case.
Don't you like your pie?<eos> It's okay.<eos> Do you mind?<eos> Who you waiting for?<eos> Nobody.
I couldn't just stand there and do nothing.<eos> - Maybe she went out the back.<eos> - Not without setting off the alarm.<eos> Well, she didn't just flush herself out.<eos> Guys.
There is a part of me, though, that, wants to say I'm sorry.<eos> To whom?<eos> Well, to the only person I know who uses "Whom" in a conversation.<eos> Sorry to me?<eos> For what?
Don't ask her to explain.<eos> We've called Dr. Sullivan and she's gonna be here in a few hours.<eos> You're gonna be okay.<eos> I'm sorry, Mona.<eos> For what?
It's what's behind the eyes that counts.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Thought you should know I'm looking at your closed servers right now.<eos> I'm holding your hard drives in my hand.<eos> All your secret communications.
Eat me, Burrows.<eos> Say we're clear.<eos> I'm gonna get more guys.<eos> And you'll be running again.<eos> Not this time.
Look at me.<eos> I'm a crap house loon.<eos> Excessive need to bring the past back to life.<eos> Make it real.<eos> But enough of that.
How we doing?<eos> Better than you.<eos> Oh, thank God.<eos> You okay?<eos> Up ahead, in the next bay.
Guess who found a job, a job where no one cares if you've been publicly accused of being a serial killer?<eos> Why's Liv sacked out on your couch?<eos> Hey.<eos> So... You have a little time for some Go Fish?<eos> Maybe some Gin Rummy?
But the way that you're going, one day, you won't wake up.<eos> And I'm not going to treat you if you aren't interested in living.<eos> Good speech.<eos> If I'm going to help you, you have to agree to a few things.<eos> - What?
- Oh. - Wow.<eos> - I'm from London, originally.<eos> - London? How interesting.<eos> Did you come all this way for Dr. Beckham?<eos> By way of Jersey.
- I know.<eos> That's why Luke calls her "the unicorn."<eos> She gets her period once and gets pregnant off some guy she barely knows.<eos> I'm never having a baby.<eos> No way.
- No, that's not why the marriage ended.<eos> - There's a better reason?<eos> We are not here to defend our relationship.<eos> When are you going to come up with a different narrative, Susan?<eos> - What narrative?
- There's a better reason?<eos> We are not here to defend our relationship.<eos> When are you going to come up with a different narrative, Susan?<eos> - What narrative?<eos> - What narrative?
Ellen... be strong, okay?<eos> Hey, I'm really sorry if I got you in any sort of trouble... - Please, no, I'm sorry.<eos> I hate that... - No, no, no, it's... it's whatever.<eos> You can forget it.<eos> What a shit-show.
You think I haven't seen that thing that you do?<eos> What thing?<eos> Making sure your arm doesn't get bigger than, what, a silver dollar?<eos> Deal.<eos> Cigarette for dinner.
Come on, get it on you.<eos> Right?<eos> Okay.<eos> Now, a little bite... for me.<eos> - For you? - Mm-hmm.
I thought perhaps it'd been tampered with, so I had to look at it myself, - put my mind at rest.<eos> - And did it?<eos> You see that lot, all going off to Sophia's party, and then nothing.<eos> Nothing comes, nothing goes.<eos> - All bloody night.
The registration number.<eos> BK3?<eos> BK372. Ex-fishing boat.<eos> Yeah, who's it registered to?<eos> Michael Hogarth.
Back straight!<eos> Move!<eos> Come on!<eos> Come on! Keep moving.<eos> On your knees, now!
What's there left to say, huh, Marius?<eos> I'm tired.<eos> Of course you are.<eos> I should have killed you three years ago.<eos> All of you.
- Charlie.<eos> - Charlie.<eos> - Charlie.<eos> - Charlie.<eos> Charlie.
Later, Porter.<eos> Keep out of trouble, Eddie!<eos> [car engine starts] So where are we going?<eos> How about to Vegas with me?<eos> Vegas?
She's devoted to you, Otto.<eos> Don't be stupid.<eos> Tell her.<eos> Tell her what?<eos> The house painter.
We're not gonna die.<eos> We're still getting out.<eos> All of us.<eos> How's that?<eos> The roof?
It'll start the process.<eos> Sometimes, my friend, I can't tell which is bigger, your plans or your lies.<eos> I take that personally, you calling me a liar.<eos> And I'm gonna show you, just like the butterfly's wings, this piece of gum is gonna start a sequence of events that will finish on the other side of the world.<eos> Battery, please.
A man is not a man if he would let his family die.<eos> You agreed to help him.<eos> How?<eos> He said if I could arrange a blackout, he... he knew someone who could get him out.<eos> An American?
But this may be too late.<eos> Ramadan has begun.<eos> The guards are releasing the prisoners.<eos> Abu Ramal and his men, they'll kill me.<eos> And you.
_<eos> _<eos> _<eos> That Christian guy said you told him you'd just take him.<eos> No one else.
Understand?<eos> Planning on leaving?<eos> Right when the glorious revolution is beginning.<eos> I'm not here for political discussion, just passports.<eos> Money first.
Any chance Poseidon'll just<eos> - let us kill her?<eos> - It might come to that.<eos> We get out, where are you going?<eos> Back to my couch.
I'm sorry. It's just... I get you don't know where to turn, but I got a stake in this, too.<eos> - Mm-hmm.<eos> - Okay? This is my wife, my son.<eos> You want to get back at these guys?<eos> The university.
- You're not gonna let me get it at all?<eos> - No you have to get it yourself.<eos> Hey! Professor Keating.<eos> I, uh... I got that internship.<eos> What internship?
Keating.<eos> You're getting out of here.<eos> I'm being released?<eos> No, we're transferring you to county till your bail hearing.<eos> Up and at 'em.
Your Honor, the State's evidence to support their allegations against my client is lacking, if not non-existent.<eos> We aren't arguing the facts of this case today, Your Honor.<eos> Any effort to deny my client bail must be based on credible evidence...<eos> But the State's case is based on an anonymous source.<eos> Objection.
Thanks.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Um, I have to ask.<eos> Ask what?<eos> Keating.
Sorry.<eos> I'll get paper towels.<eos> You mad at me?<eos> A little.<eos> To Wes.
Now, this is not an interview, and if there is any exchange that I deem detrimental to my client's case, I will end things here.<eos> - Clear?<eos> - Yes.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> For what?
- Clear?<eos> - Yes.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> For what?<eos> Everything.
You're in on this.<eos> No.<eos> You should take the deal they're offering.<eos> They're gonna take her down eventually.<eos> For what?
Where's his justice?<eos> We'll see you at the grand jury.<eos> We can hit you back, Ms. Winterbottom.<eos> This office has files on everyone in Ms. Keating's life.<eos> You, her students...
Everyone's hungry for dessert.<eos> Come on.<eos> Yummy, yummy, yummy in your tummy, tummy, tummy.<eos> Who's in there?<eos> Uh, no one.
- Stop.<eos> - Stop what?<eos> Why don't you say "Hi" to your buddy Atwood over there?<eos> You could thank her for the deal she got you.<eos> - What deal?
The signature of an investigator from your office...<eos> Nate Lahey?<eos> Yes.<eos> Can you explain to the court why you would tamper with evidence this way?<eos> Objection... argumentative.
Correct, Ms. Winterbottom?<eos> Actually, we have a new witness we'd like to call to the stand.<eos> She was the other victim in the fire...<eos> Laurel Castillo.<eos> Objection...
Yeah!<eos> I will kill the girl, I swear it!<eos> No!<eos> I will say it again, there will not be any killing in this prison!<eos> Not on my watch!
I promise you... you release me, I release you.<eos> Little more, little more.<eos> Thank God.<eos> Come on.<eos> Okay, the bottom.
So much for our word.<eos> Lying to enemies. It's called Taqiyya.<eos> Take off the camera.<eos> I will show the world what happens when you screw Abu Ramal.<eos> On your knees!
Looked up to you, deferred to you.<eos> Because I always thought you had the best interests of the firm in mind.<eos> I have...<eos> Mn... You did.<eos> For a long time.
I don't give a shit about the office.<eos> So can I start looking for a tenant?<eos> Yeah. Yeah.<eos> I could've killed someone, Jimmy. Yeah.<eos> Yourself.
Well, I-i want you to send someone over to find it and disconnect it.<eos> I... Wednesday?<eos> I can't wait that long.<eos> Are you sure there's nothing sooner?<eos> Wednesday then.
Didn't give me enough to put all the pieces together.<eos> Back up, back up, back up.<eos> What did they say?<eos> Jacob?<eos> His words?
He always give you orders like that?<eos> It's complicated.<eos> I got an order for you.<eos> Load up.<eos> One more bag inside.
Yeah.<eos> Airports are worse than hospitals.<eos> And once the name kaniel outis is radioactive, they'll shoot him on sight.<eos> So another boat?<eos> Across the Atlantic?
Even admitted to lying, keeping it all from me.<eos> How you finally came clean and put it all behind you?<eos> Sure.<eos> I forgave you for the lies.<eos> Your past.
Now we have a game.<eos> He's already revealed his brother, his biggest piece.<eos> Soon he'll have to show his face.<eos> Trailer, please take him down.<eos> What the...?
We're still the good guys.<eos> - Loading credits.<eos> - Prove it.<eos> Come help me investigate that warehouse tonight.<eos> No way.
The day I let one of my officers write "vampire car"<eos> in their report is the same day I let you suck my dick.<eos> Now get dressed, go home, get drunk.<eos> Internal Affairs will interview you tomorrow.<eos> No way.
May I take your order?<eos> Uh, I'll have a pollos classic and a coffee, black.<eos> Would you like the pollos bonus size for 50 cents more?<eos> No.<eos> Normal.
Just tell me what you saw.<eos> He came in, like you said he would.<eos> He ordered the number three with potatoes and coffee, went bold with the extra salsa, And he paid cash out of his left front pocket.<eos> Uh, took his tray of food, sat in a booth on the east side of the restaurant, and put the knapsack on the floor.<eos> Where on the floor?
If chuck has a plan for this tape, I don't know what it is.<eos> At this point, all we can do is wait for his move, then act accordingly.<eos> All right, then.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Sure.
Is this it?<eos> Huh?<eos> For this, you destroyed our family?<eos> You happy now?<eos> For what? ! For nothing!
Why would you bring it?<eos> Get it and come save our asses.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - I'll cover you.<eos> On three.
What just happened?<eos> I think we've stopped.<eos> That's impossible.<eos> You're sure it's gone?<eos> Damn straight.
Miss me, son?<eos> Jace!<eos> What is this place?<eos> Looks like a Downworld prison.<eos> More like a zoo.
I...<eos> I had a right to know.<eos> I was scared.<eos> Because you married a psychopath...<eos> My father.
I'll be right back on Camille as soon as I deal with my family.<eos> We are your family now.<eos> - And what?<eos> Just supposed to forget my mom?<eos> - Your mom?
You should be looking for Camille, not your mother.<eos> - You're threatening my family.<eos> - And you're threatening mine.<eos> The longer Camille is free, the more people she kills.<eos> My people.
Not too many people know this, but... when I was living in London, in the early 1870s,<eos> I was in a bad place.<eos> No matter how hard I tried...<eos> I couldn't see my way out.<eos> Then on one particular stormy night...
But you crossed the line.<eos> I won't let Raphael suffer for your bad deeds.<eos> So this is about one little insubordinate vamp?<eos> You've sired hundreds of vampires.<eos> Your children.
Now, I know you don't have a lot of money, and, sadly, this is not something that insurance will cover.<eos> But I like you.<eos> So, I'll tell you what.<eos> I'll bring your mother back, and, as payment, you can owe me a favor.<eos> Uh, what kind of favor?
I went to see a warlock in Park Slope.<eos> Her name's Iris Rouse and she...<eos> Please, please tell me you're not thinking about doing what I think...<eos> I can bring my mom back, Jace.<eos> Our mom.
Fine.<eos> Call me when you need me.<eos> I need you now.<eos> You are going to host one of my finest creations.<eos> "Host"?
Valentine's men infiltrated.<eos> We tried to fight them off.<eos> They...<eos> They killed Magdalena and took me.<eos> Only you?
I'm not afraid of them.<eos> I've been working on my fighting skills.<eos> Oh, really?<eos> You wanna take this outside and give these fight skills a test run?<eos> Anytime.
Anybody?<eos> No!<eos> You sure we're safe up here?<eos> If I'm gonna die, it's not gonna be in this van.<eos> Not on a night like tonight.
I can destroy the soul-sword.<eos> And destroy yourself in the process.<eos> No.<eos> That's a suicide mission.<eos> No way.
Where's the city dump?<eos> Gideon, set us down as close to the location as you can get.<eos> Yes, Captain Lance.<eos> And, while you're at it, find Mick and...<eos> Grey?
They're going too slow.<eos> Shoot one of them<eos> - to move things along.<eos> - Which one?<eos> Dealer's choice.
You don't happen to have any champagne on this ship, do you?<eos> Ah, 1998 Blanc de Noir.<eos> I like beer.<eos> Gets me drunk.<eos> To Lily.
Ah, 1998 Blanc de Noir.<eos> I like beer.<eos> Gets me drunk.<eos> To Lily.<eos> To Gideon.
You truly are my daughter.<eos> Well, I am sorry about that.<eos> No, I'm...<eos> I'm the one who's sorry.<eos> For what?
BULLOCK:<eos> Jim! Jim.<eos> Someone spotted Strange.<eos> Just don't shoot any innocent bystanders.<eos> Or me.
Jim! Jim.<eos> Someone spotted Strange.<eos> Just don't shoot any innocent bystanders.<eos> Or me.<eos> Especially me.
You, Jim Gordon, you're the mons... (gagging)<eos> You're right. I am a monster.<eos> - OFFICER: GCPD!<eos> - BULLOCK: Arrest them!<eos> All of them!
The best friend I've ever had.<eos> If you love Lee, go save her.<eos> Tickets.<eos> Tickets.<eos> To our great adventure.
Oh, you know enough about it to alter what it does.<eos> Oh, I see.<eos> You want me to alter it.<eos> Well, what do you want me to alter it into?<eos> Like, a hair dryer?
Oh, I see.<eos> You want me to alter it.<eos> Well, what do you want me to alter it into?<eos> Like, a hair dryer?<eos> Or a waffle maker?
How about I sit on my ass and let you obliterate permanently from existence?<eos> How's that sound?<eos> That's your plan?<eos> Do it or you'll Reverse-Flash me?<eos> Not you.
How's that sound?<eos> That's your plan?<eos> Do it or you'll Reverse-Flash me?<eos> Not you.<eos> Her.
Fantastic.<eos> You know Savitar's gonna turn on you one day.<eos> No, he won't.<eos> A bad guy like Savitar always turns on his partners.<eos> Not this time.
I mean... with what you did.<eos> I'm sure one day, it'll hit me.<eos> In the future, which... I have again.<eos> We have.<eos> Every day of it.
But you need to keep living your life.<eos> Keep growing.<eos> Keep loving.<eos> Keep running.<eos> For me.
Oliver:<eos> He told me he doesn't want to.<eos> He's proving to me that I will destroy myself and everyone close to me.<eos> Well, he's gonna be disappointed but we are gonna put black siren back in her cage.<eos> Black siren?
He means to destroy you utterly.<eos> Your crusade was based on a lie.<eos> Make it home.<eos> Make it better.<eos> Right my wrongs.
Get them to the plane, make sure that everyone stays safe.<eos> Comms just in case something goes wrong.<eos> You mean "when," right?<eos> That's detailed satellite imagery of the island.<eos> Again, just in case.
You mean "when," right?<eos> That's detailed satellite imagery of the island.<eos> Again, just in case.<eos> What was that for?<eos> Just in case.
Serial killer.<eos> No shit.<eos> Him?<eos> Who'd he kill?<eos> Some other rummies?
Your Honor, given the late hour, I suggest we recess for the day.<eos> Court will resume in the morning with Mrs. Allen's testimony.<eos> Senor Bosch.<eos> Gracias, Gladys.<eos> De nada.
- De nada.<eos> Talk to your mom lately?<eos> We Skyped Sunday.<eos> You should make that a standing date... Once a week, Sunday.<eos> Well, her Sunday or my Sunday?
Excuse me.<eos> - Jerry.<eos> - Caught one, partner.<eos> - I'll text the address.<eos> - On my way.
You ever visit him?<eos> He wouldn't ever tell us where he was living.<eos> He was ashamed, Hal.<eos> That was just before he deployed the first time.<eos> The first time?
And I'll help.<eos> Sure, let's... let's do it.<eos> All right!<eos> So you just point me in the direction of a good caterer, maybe some place to rent a chuppah.<eos> Ooh, and a florist.
Yeah.<eos> Is everything ok?<eos> This might be none of my business, but I think she crossed a line to find Walker.<eos> Rory.<eos> What line?
I'm going to handle this.<eos> What do you need me to do?<eos> That did not take long.<eos> Anatoly, what do you want?<eos> To our imperfect union.
Anatoly, what do you want?<eos> To our imperfect union.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> - For coming as backup or for not telling anyone?<eos> Both.
Bratva get tattoos on their chest when they make captain.<eos> - What about the other thing?<eos> The Russians call him luchnik, the Archer.<eos> Does he remind you of anyone you know?<eos> The Green Arrow.
Fair.<eos> Just stop this guy.<eos> Whoever he is, he's not in the system.<eos> What if instead of tracking him, we tracked the assault weapon?<eos> Rifle.
I didn't care.<eos> It was just a necklace.<eos> But Steve, he got in front of the man and...<eos> Every time I close my eyes, I see the gun.<eos> Every time.
Think again!<eos> You have failed this city!<eos> You're under arrest!<eos> Get on the floor with your hands behind your head.<eos> On the ground!
What sin?<eos> Don't worry about it.<eos> Why don't you worry about catching Liza Warner and not because you are responsible but because she's a criminal.<eos> Let's get moving. Yo!<eos> Holy...
Thea, you should have come to me with this!<eos> And then what?<eos> We would have the same conversation we are having right now.<eos> I would've told you that she was going to out you as the...<eos> Green Arrow.
I'm not talking about your body, Mr. Queen.<eos> I'm talking about this.<eos> The mind needs rest or at least someone to take your thoughts off all the evil you face each day.<eos> Dr. Schwartz, are you prescribing me a girlfriend?<eos> Or just a friend.
Oliver, this impeachment is about punishing someone, and if you don't offer up a name, this will be the last time you're looking out that window.<eos> If the council's not gonna let me testify at the hearing, then I need to take my case directly to the public.<eos> - A press conference? - Yeah.<eos> Mind filling me in on who you're throwing under the bus?<eos> The Green Arrow.
It's detecting resonance frequencies upstairs.<eos> It's not a toy.<eos> It's a T-sphere. Wait.<eos> Every horror movie ever has basically said that you do not go upstairs at a creepy serial killer's mother's house.<eos> Help!
- Doris, please.<eos> You need to understand the truth.<eos> You have to know at some level that your husband has been keeping something from you.<eos> And police and the mayor say that you're the killer, you.<eos> On the floor.
You need to understand the truth.<eos> You have to know at some level that your husband has been keeping something from you.<eos> And police and the mayor say that you're the killer, you.<eos> On the floor.<eos> On the floor!
And police and the mayor say that you're the killer, you.<eos> On the floor.<eos> On the floor!<eos> Get down on the floor!<eos> On the floor.
Heh.<eos> Much appreciated.<eos> Yeah. I usually like my tongue lashings to be done in private, so thank you. Heh.<eos> I'm...<eos> Sorry.
I'm on Chase.<eos> You guys just focus on protecting the city.<eos> Feel free to use my apartment as your new secret lair.<eos> Where is she going?<eos> No place good.
- Did you get it?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> That is what we needed...<eos> Something that he couldn't plan for...<eos> You.
An invisible meta?<eos> Or psychokinesis, though some prefer telekinesis.<eos> I--I don't think so.<eos> Check out what the elevator's doing.<eos> Yeah, guys.
- Kind of?<eos> I'd never knocked anyone out with an elevator before, and apparently, there's a learning curve.<eos> - I need you to hear me out for one second.<eos> - You murdered someone.<eos> - Accidentally and for a good cause.
I thought you were sleeping.<eos> I couldn't sleep.<eos> I know you're upset.<eos> I know you think that I've violated some kind of trust between us, but--<eos> Lyla.
You named them?<eos> Kodo and Podo. Heh.<eos> You know, Dar's thieving little ferrets on "The Beastmaster."<eos> Let's just say a young Marc Singer was quite helpful in me discovering my homosexuality.<eos> And my heterosexuality.
- Do it!<eos> I'm sorry, Felicity.<eos> I know you hate it when I don't listen to you.<eos> Rene, pull us up.<eos> Hey, Lyla.
Ugh. Oliver, we have been over and over and over plan.<eos> I'm not that drunk.<eos> Humor me.<eos> I find boat.<eos> Fisherman, most likely.
He is going to need to lean on you more than you're going to need to lean on him.<eos> Oliver, we know, can get through anything if he has the love and support of his sister.<eos> I miss him.<eos> I miss both of them.<eos> Every day.
Taiana, I'm sorry.<eos> Your failures...<eos> I guess you made your choice.<eos> Noooo!<eos> Your guilt...
Noooo!<eos> Your guilt...<eos> Oliver, no!<eos> Your bloodlust...<eos> Your inhumanity.
This isn't real.<eos> It's not real.<eos> You're in my head.<eos> And who better than you knows the truth?<eos> What truth?
Everyone.<eos> I'll see you on the boat.<eos> Chase's helicopter flew to an abandoned airfield in Dawn Valley, Utah.<eos> Then 5 minutes later, this aircraft took off from the same field at a vector of 2-7-0.<eos> Due west.
- No.<eos> Renard did.<eos> Renard?<eos> Um... kind of looks like you were shot.<eos> Like, more than once.
Wake up.<eos> Who is this?<eos> Sean Renard.<eos> I'm coming over.<eos> At this hour?
- I'm not sure.<eos> I don't think you should be handling dead guys right now.<eos> Thanks.<eos> The death grip supposedly trades a pure soul for freedom from hell.<eos> Pure soul?
Microwave.<eos> I just got the thing.<eos> I didn't even get a chance to install it.<eos> And when was that?<eos> Wednesday.
Man.<eos> Good to see you too, Francis.<eos> What happened to your truck?<eos> I hit a squirrel.<eos> Why so much this time?
Absolutely!<eos> What do you do...?<eos> Give me your security pass.<eos> What?<eos> For your lab.
I will not have you disrespecting a fellow martian.<eos> He's got as much dust in his blood as the rest of us.<eos> Marines. Who do we fight for?<eos> Both:<eos> Mars.
Both:<eos> Mars.<eos> Who do we fight for?<eos> -All:<eos> Mars!
Theroci'sthe least ofourgoddamnproblemsnow.<eos> Let's go!<eos> You love killing belters?<eos> Fred:<eos> Diogo!
Diogo!<eos> Get these men to holding.<eos> Under guard.<eos> Diogo:<eos> Miller, too?
Well, why don't you tell me a little bit more about your journey?<eos> I was born into this, but I've never doubted it...<eos> No, no, no.<eos> I mean the big one.<eos> The nauvoo.
It learns, you know.<eos> It does something different every time.<eos> The more biomass you feed it, the faster it learns, the more it changes.<eos> So you fed it Eros.<eos> A whole station.
But I do know we need to do something.<eos> And I know i can't do it without you.<eos> We'll do it together.<eos> I take it this means you know where you want to go?<eos> Eros.
They gave the goddamn thing a name.<eos> What are we going to do with it?<eos> Stick it on the end of a torpedo, and we fire it into the sun.<eos> That is too important to destroy right now. - We'll hide it.<eos> - Where?
Back off and settle down, ya hear?<eos> What the hell?<eos> Amos?<eos> Jesus Christ! Amos!<eos> What the hell?
If Alex burned 2,800 just getting out of the donnager, we may have a problem.<eos> Fourteen-millimeter spanner, please.<eos> Where the hell do we get more when we run out?<eos> Maybe the mcrn does mail order for their stolen ships.<eos> Fourteen-millimeter.
-I did.<eos> -Great.<eos> 'Cause I'm really liking us not threatening to kill each other anymore.<eos> You threatened to kill him?<eos> Just the one time.
Give it back!<eos> Cease fire!<eos> Cease fire, god damn it!<eos> Stop!<eos> Diogo!
An extra-solar lifeform.<eos> We found your lab notes on the Anubis.<eos> Maybe you can appreciate what it is.<eos> An organism that can repurpose other life forms and use them to evolve.<eos> Into what?
I-I should have knocked, but you should have locked.<eos> Uh, it's a learning experience for us both.<eos> Chris, all right, bring it in, buddy.<eos> Give me one.<eos> One.
- Okay.<eos> - All right, ready?<eos> - All right.<eos> - Okay?<eos> - On three.
The 29th March.<eos> The day after our spring equinox.<eos> And you didn't see or hear from her after that?<eos> As a member of your coven, didn't that strike you as unusual?<eos> In your own time.
Eyes like pools of ink that could drown you with a stare.<eos> She hypnotised you.<eos> Although it didn't take you long to find a replacement.<eos> A toast.<eos> Lilith.
- To Scott.<eos> - To Scott!<eos> - And his bride.<eos> - His bride!<eos> To Zelda.
Dinesh is the new CEO of Pied Piper.<eos> Actually, just one last thing.<eos> I think you guys should call yourselves PiperChat. I'm gonna have to insist that I keep the name Pied Piper, and I won't budge on that.<eos> - Yeah, it's totally fine.<eos> - Okay, yeah.
Well, it's no good being Lord of the Riverlands if you can't celebrate with your family.<eos> That's what I say!<eos> Yes!<eos> I've gathered every Frey who means a damn thing so I can tell you my plans for this great house now that winter has come.<eos> But first, a toast!
Keep looking.<eos> What do you see?<eos> Ice.<eos> A wall of ice.<eos> The Wall.
It's a long ride back to the Reach, Ser Jaime.<eos> How may I serve?<eos> I want you to be my ranking general in the wars to come.<eos> I want you to swear allegiance to Cersei and I want you to help me destroy her enemies.<eos> All her enemies.
The secret is browning the butter before making the dough.<eos> Most people don't do that 'cause it takes up too much time.<eos> Mm, I didn't do that.<eos> You've been making pies?<eos> One or two.
She found me.<eos> What happened to you, Arry?<eos> You got any ale?<eos> - Where you heading?<eos> - King's Landing.
How can you drink this piss?<eos> When we reach Sunspear, I'll treat you to a Dornish red.<eos> The best in the world.<eos> Have you ever been to Dorne?<eos> A few times.
What happened?<eos> The night you were killed, what... what happened?<eos> Um... so anyway, we were driving, and he was upset, and so I decided to give him a little goodbye blow job.<eos> You know?<eos> One last time with feeling.
Don't imagine yours includes my lucky coin.<eos> Oh! My lucky coin, Ginger Minge.<eos> Fuck.<eos> My husband gave that coin to me.<eos> Damn his dark eyes.
Your man does, and he shouldn't.<eos> Listen, just give me my fucking coin back, yeah?<eos> Hey. There's more where that came from.<eos> I'll give you another.<eos> Just as good.
There was an accident, all right.<eos> And now finally my prayers have been answered.<eos> I do not pray to ask God for things.<eos> I pray to thank God for bringing me where I am.<eos> To this time, to this place, where...
This ain't good lighting for you, love.<eos> And a bang of benjy coming off of you.<eos> - What can I get you?<eos> - Southern Comfort and Coke.<eos> - Vodka straight.
Then Mother Church came along and turned us all into saints, and trolls, and faeries.<eos> General Mills did the rest.<eos> So what's the appeal?<eos> What's Wednesday selling at this god-fest that you've got to get a ticket?<eos> War.
Selina...<eos> I know how long you've waited to see your mother.<eos> I can't imagine all you must be feeling.<eos> She left me here, Bruce.<eos> Alone.
You think this is funny, don't you?<eos> How about this?<eos> !<eos> Hilarious.<eos> Again!
Well, I suppose I should start by killing him.<eos> Theo Galavan's dead.<eos> Oh...<eos> Who beat me to it?<eos> W-Which time?
Dance!<eos> Get him!<eos> Squash her!<eos> Get the old lady.<eos> No, the fat guy.
Bruce!<eos> I thought you were dead.<eos> Can't get rid of me that easily, can you, mate?<eos> Oh, come here.<eos> Behind you!
Thanks for coming.<eos> Like I had a choice?<eos> Oh, you'll thank me.<eos> This is gonna be electrifying.<eos> Knight to Queen 3.
Oh, honestly.<eos> They call anyone a grandmaster these days.<eos> Can we discuss why you're doing this?<eos> I've told you why.<eos> The real reason.
But you killed Penguin, and you killed Professor Dyson and the others.<eos> Why?<eos> Have you always been Foxy, Foxy?<eos> I'm not sure what you mean.<eos> All my life...
Tell me about it.<eos> A secret organization that controls all of Gotham?<eos> If that's true, somebody should tell 'em they're doing a pretty terrible job.<eos> He told you all this at the cabin?<eos> Most of it.
Jim, what an unpleasant surprise.<eos> Let me guess, do I hear a favor coming on?<eos> I've been waiting a long time for you to begin your journey.<eos> The only journey I'm going to take is back home.<eos> Back to Gotham.
People are afraid.<eos> And fear breeds hopelessness.<eos> I'm supposed to believe you care about the people of Gotham?<eos> I do.<eos> Very much.
I don't know why I let him get to me.<eos> Sticks and stones, right?<eos> Words always hurt me way more than sticks or stones.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Me, too.
The police, thank God.<eos> Keep your hands where we can see them!<eos> I didn't want to kill these people, I-I...<eos> I just lost control.<eos> On the ground, now.
And I would do it again.<eos> - He was infected.<eos> - Yes.<eos> Because Jervis Tetch wanted to punish you.<eos> You!
I just did what they asked me to, I swear.<eos> Very good!<eos> Thank you, Mr. Mayor.<eos> You've been very helpful.<eos> Helpful?
There's a question mark on your face.<eos> You can sleep in the freezer.<eos> The study speculates that widespread chemical dumping is to blame.<eos> We now go to breaking news...<eos> Hey, Pengy.
Now, I'm gonna ask you nicely, or I swear to God, you're gonna feel a whole lot of pain.<eos> Where is Bruce?<eos> Bruce is serving a greater purpose than himself.<eos> As am I.<eos> Last time!
Was planning on using it on them, but...<eos> You're gonna have to do a lot better than that...<eos> Help.<eos> Help.<eos> Help.
Then we help each other escape, together, so that we may be free to murder each other outside.<eos> Deal.<eos> What are you going to show me?<eos> The truth, Bruce.<eos> My truth.
Alfred.<eos> What's happened?<eos> It's Bruce.<eos> He's been abducted.<eos> Oh, why?
Put her in the box.<eos> I've seen the map.<eos> I know the Court has secret locations across the city.<eos> Where are you hiding the bomb?<eos> What bomb?
Jim!<eos> Jim.<eos> Someone spotted Strange.<eos> Just don't shoot any innocent bystanders.<eos> Or me.
Jim.<eos> Someone spotted Strange.<eos> Just don't shoot any innocent bystanders.<eos> Or me.<eos> Especially me.
You, Jim Gordon, you're the mons...<eos> You're right.<eos> I am a monster.<eos> - Arrest them!<eos> All of them!
The best friend I've ever had.<eos> If you love Lee, go save her.<eos> Tickets.<eos> Tickets.<eos> To our great adventure.
No, no, no, no.<eos> Please.<eos> Okay.<eos> Can I open my eyes yet please?<eos> Um, yeah, but just one second.
Jay said that your death is just one possible future, okay?<eos> So that gives us four months to figure out how to stop Savitar.<eos> I swear, on both my parents' lives, I will protect you.<eos> We can't do this alone, Barry.<eos> Hey, guys, um...
I know.<eos> - Crank it.<eos> - Three, two, one.<eos> What do you see?<eos> An empty street.
- Crank it.<eos> - Three, two, one.<eos> What do you see?<eos> An empty street.<eos> A bus stop.
- I'm in.<eos> - All right.<eos> Plunder, my man.<eos> Where do you think you're going?<eos> Right through you.
- That's nice of you.<eos> - You want a drink?<eos> - Yeah, I'd love one.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> Cheers.
Of... of love, of course... hope for the future.<eos> I don't know if I have ever met two people who are more suited to one another than you two.<eos> - To Barry and Iris.<eos> - Barry and Iris.<eos> To Barry and Iris.
Just glad I could be helpful.<eos> This is... more than helpful.<eos> I gotta work on this.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - Cheers.
- Put me down for 20 for Barry.<eos> - Joe, got to be in it... come on.<eos> - No, not me.<eos> That's a Sophie's Choice I'm not gonna make.<eos> $80 on Barry.
You can do this, Wallace.<eos> Okay.<eos> All right, all right.<eos> You can do this.<eos> All right, again.
Iris...<eos> Wally, he needs to know.<eos> Needs to know what?<eos> When Barry threw the Philosopher's Stone into the Speed Force, there was an explosion, and he was propelled to the future.<eos> The future?
You're already crafting a version of this for your book, aren't you?<eos> "Peace finally descends upon the family West."<eos> The West family, or family West?<eos> Right, it's time I get to work.<eos> At this hour?
She's not.<eos> I checked her out.<eos> Can you convince her to help?<eos> Bro, she won't say no to me.<eos> No way.
We did it!<eos> Thank God.<eos> Flash stopped the weapon.<eos> But he can't stop us all.<eos> Attack!
Don't front.<eos> You're into me.<eos> Look, Cisco, I mean, even if I was...<eos> You couldn't handle me.<eos> Bye, guys.
Man, what did we ever do to you?<eos> You took everything from me!<eos> I never asked for any of this, Joe.<eos> I am only this way because of you.<eos> All of you!
Right now, we just need to figure out where Savitar is.<eos> Yes, I think that's a fantastic plan.<eos> How are we gonna do that?<eos> - No.<eos> - One more time.
That message was received loud and clear.<eos> Now hear mine.<eos> Taking on Savitar all alone is not gonna bring Wallace back, Jesse.<eos> It's just gonna get you killed, and that, my friend, that is not happening.<eos> Not on my watch.
It was you, Barry Allen.<eos> You inspired him to be better.<eos> You inspired him to be selfless, to sacrifice himself for others, to be a hero, just like you.<eos> I'm no hero.<eos> Not lately.
I shouldn't be surprised.<eos> Us Wellses... we are forces to be reckoned with.<eos> That we are.<eos> Thank you, H.R.<eos> For what?
You're in a movie musical.<eos> So all you have to do is just follow the...<eos> The Yellow Brick Road?<eos> No, the... the script.<eos> - Oh, yeah.

Magic or tech, doesn't matter. You're not getting out of these.<eos> Maybe not.<eos> You let me go, I will tell you Savitar's greatest secret.<eos> It's the key to defeating him, the key to stopping him.<eos> - What secret?
We have to get an ambulance in here right now.<eos> H.R., grab the crash cart.<eos> Cisco, grab the oxygen.<eos> Wheel it over here!<eos> Slow and steady, over her mouth.
- Okay, give me the...<eos> Give it here.<eos> Clear.<eos> All the way, turn it up to the top!<eos> - All the way up!
So what do you say?<eos> You ready for Team Flash to take down the bad guys again?<eos> Team Flash.<eos> Team Flash.<eos> On three.
- Can't he phase or something?<eos> - That doesn't work on these guys.<eos> - Well, what will?<eos> Give me that thing in your hands.<eos> The other thing.
I was wrong to do that.<eos> If you're all willing to... try to be a family again...<eos> I think I can, too.<eos> I don't know which... which one of you to hug first.<eos> Him.
All right, I'll get to CCPD.<eos> Yeah, and we'll, uh... we'll dive in here, right?<eos> Right, team?<eos> Team Flash.<eos> On three.
I went to the future.<eos> My future self told me that he created time remnants to stop you.<eos> But you slaughtered them all.<eos> All but one.<eos> Me.
Bart.<eos> I got some friends down at the courthouse.<eos> I'm gonna go down there and see if we can delay this whole Coolidge situation, all right?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> For what?
Nothing.<eos> Oh, golly.<eos> Look at us.<eos> Just three musketeers working away.<eos> Just like old times, huh?

Where?<eos> All right, I'll come pick you up.<eos> - What is it? - Ah...<eos> Really good news.<eos> Lyla.
I know we don't have a plane.<eos> We steal a plane, okay?<eos> We'll put it back. All right?<eos> And we parachute out of the plane, and land on the roof... gotta land on the right roof, all right?<eos> And then... right down the air ducts.
I don't remember.<eos> - I love you.<eos> - I love you too, Dad.<eos> Take this for me, please.<eos> Just in case.
- Yeah.<eos> - And you snuck in here anyway?<eos> To save Iris' life, Lyla. Yeah.<eos> I'll do anything.<eos> Not anything.
- That's not fair.<eos> - It's not fair?<eos> It's not fair for you to say.<eos> Savitar tricked us.<eos> Us?
- It's not fair?<eos> It's not fair for you to say.<eos> Savitar tricked us.<eos> Us?<eos> Me.
Why don't you tell us about what brought you to the meeting today?<eos> Well, I got my brother this job...<eos> Actually, I asked for the job.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Through my connections.
I think she's ready to meet the boss.<eos> Matt, I figured something out.<eos> - About the sirens?<eos> - No, not exactly.<eos> About their toys.
And I can assure you Detective, I will never lay eyes on that flight attendant again.<eos> You sure about that?<eos> Oh, no.<eos> Jana.<eos> Always with the tragic timing.
- What?<eos> - No.<eos> There was no reason to hurt anyone.<eos> I mean, he was just a meaningless<eos> - one-night-stand. - Mm.
Great.<eos> Great.<eos> We traced the e-mail to a grad student named Matthew Hoffing.<eos> He works here part-time.<eos> Libraries.
Don't be ridiculous.<eos> You had a choice not to be so foolish.<eos> Lucifer.<eos> Well, who's to say the killer wouldn't demand her other hand?<eos> Her spleen?
Exactly.<eos> But this stuff is so strong, Dan, that it killed him anyway.<eos> I mean, we are talking designer poison here.<eos> Engineered from controlled substances.<eos> Each one just a little bit different.
Well, he's already out on bail, but the good news is, he does have an ankle bracelet so he can't get far.<eos> Detective.<eos> I'm fine. We should go.<eos> They think they can keep me down.<eos> Me!
Yeah, yeah.<eos> No, no, I'm fine.<eos> I'm fine. What were you saying?<eos> Uh... yeah.<eos> Yeah, maybe another time.
Remember what I said.<eos> My word is my bond.<eos> Dave Maddox?<eos> We need to talk.<eos> Just one moment, all right?
You can't be certain that this will work.<eos> What do you think?<eos> I think... that I followed about half of that.<eos> Do you guys do this a lot?<eos> Like, celestial planning sessions?
Quite frankly, I'd prefer to Uber there.<eos> But... look, I am doing this with or without you.<eos> Well, I'm sorry.<eos> Having spent millennia in that terrible place, I can't be part of you going back.<eos> Not even for a moment.
You?<eos> What makes you think you'd go to Hell and not Heaven?<eos> There are things you don't know about me.<eos> No.<eos> No way.
What's your name, bae?<eos> That's Kennedy, man.<eos> The party just started.<eos> Turn it up!<eos> To the next club!
But he's only doing this because he thinks that you stole his father.<eos> Dr. Freud, we figured this out a long time ago.<eos> - And what I've got, he will never have.<eos> - Yes, but there's one thing that he will take if you let him.<eos> Me.
Our concept for the video is idealized young love with you and Delphine as Lucious and Cookie, showing us what that crazy, mad love looks like.<eos> Well, team, we have a new production date.<eos> ♪ Break it down, break it down... ♪ We gonna shoot this baby tonight.<eos> - Tonight?<eos> - Tonight?
But... I guess times have changed.<eos> Here you go.<eos> Ah. Single malt.<eos> Yes, it is.<eos> To new beginnings.
Here you go.<eos> Ah. Single malt.<eos> Yes, it is.<eos> To new beginnings.<eos> Cheers.
Vote for Angelo Dubois!<eos> Okay, everybody, all y'all! Vote for Angelo Dubois!<eos> Cookie, that's against the law.<eos> Come over here.<eos> - Yes, a black man, baby.
I said, do I have a second?<eos> Cookie.<eos> Why are you firing him, Lucious?<eos> Have you even looked at this?<eos> Insubordination.
It's pretty much all we got, and ain't none of it exactly clean.<eos> Get the cash.<eos> Just give me...<eos> just give me my girl.<eos> Your girl?
I got that Freda what's-her-face out of jail for Jamal!<eos> Fraudulently, Cookie! Shh.<eos> I broke the law for your ass!<eos> The, the illegal handgun!<eos> Th-The parole violation!
I respect your business hand, you know that.<eos> It's not even about that.<eos> But I just want you to hear me out on this.<eos> Jamal brings... that other audience.<eos> A different demographic.
And, um, I guess we gon' handle this, um, Angelo stuff another time.<eos> Always trying to hold me back, saying I don't know what I'm doing.<eos> Acting like somebody gave you instructions on how to be a father.<eos> All I wanted to do was just be a father to my daughter.<eos> My daughter.
Can you feel me?<eos> I also have something for my youngest.<eos> That little podcast you did the other day... it moved me.<eos> You mean my live stream?<eos> Whatever, um...
Our family had nothing to do with whatever happened to your baby.<eos> I'm sorry, your family took $5 million from mine.<eos> So what is all this, are you... you want to humble us, you want us to bow down?<eos> - That's why y'all going so low?<eos> - Us?
!<eos> - I want my daughter, man!<eos> Welcome to Laviticus, Las Vegas.<eos> I would love to make a toast to you guys.<eos> To Charlotte.
Get off of me! I will shut this place down!<eos> Get your hands off of me! My name is...!<eos> Seems a little hectic here tonight.<eos> If you don't mind, I'd like to take a tour of the vault first.<eos> One moment, sir.
It was such a pleasure seeing you.<eos> - I can't believe all these years.<eos> - Congratulations again.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - Yeah.
No!<eos> I had my daughter long before I ever laid eyes on an angel.<eos> Wait, so...<eos> My daughter was human.<eos> Just...
A lot.<eos> Brothers.<eos> Born in Lawrence, Kansas, to Mary Winchester, deceased, and John Winchester, also deceased.<eos> FBI started investigating them back in 2007.<eos> For what?
What the...<eos> Really?<eos> !<eos> Sorry! Our fault.<eos> I...
Dean.<eos> Who's Dean?<eos> I told you, I'm fine.<eos> Dean, you forgot your own name.<eos> For a second.
Yeah, of course. I think we got our witch.<eos> What, you don't remember any of this?<eos> It's like watching myself on Netflix.<eos> That guy look familiar to you?<eos> That jacket?
Wait a second.<eos> So you can't break it?<eos> Oh, of course I could, but witchcraft this complex would take time, more than Dean's got.<eos> He's already begun to forget himself, everyone he's ever known, ever loved.<eos> Even you.
Also, it never hurts to have a Winchester owe you one.<eos> My name is Dean Wi--<eos> Winchester.<eos> My name -- my name is...<eos> My....
Aah!<eos> Hmm?<eos> "Your brother's been kidnapped by a witch.<eos> I found your stupid car and left you here."<eos> Stupid?
I was like a god.<eos> Now, should you experience any odd memories from when you were hexed, conversations, you let me know?<eos> It's blank, mostly.<eos> Really.<eos> Oh, just a second.
It's blank, mostly.<eos> Really.<eos> Oh, just a second.<eos> If you want to thank me, you can send a wee gift basket.<eos> The book.
I lost a friend.<eos> I almost lost one of my boys.<eos> And we apologize -- Shut up.<eos> Anything like that happens again -- anything -- and I will burn you down.<eos> All of you.
A buddy of mine knew him.<eos> They worked together.<eos> Once.<eos> Right, you see, truth is, your mother excepted, we've struggled to attract the, top shelf of American Hunters.<eos> Like you.
I'll make it quick.<eos> Hunting.<eos> They went hunting.<eos> Hunting whom?<eos> The Hunters.
All right.<eos> Let's get this spell going.<eos> Got it.<eos> Signum est im... Imitandum.<eos> Signum est imitandum.
That's not...<eos> People died.<eos> The old men want the Winchesters, so I made a play for Dean, and it was working until your operation went sideways.<eos> Well.<eos> Better luck next time.
Yeah.<eos> What 'bout you?<eos> You got anything there, reading rainbow?<eos> I stayed up all night, going through every book we have on demons, and it turns out we have a lot of books on demons.<eos> Anything on dagon?
And apparently, he has the head of a goat.<eos> A goat?<eos> Like...<eos> Goat?<eos> Yeah, a goat.
You gonna eat that?<eos> Guess not.<eos> Be my guest.<eos> I mean, would it kill you to order pancakes?<eos> Once?
Right.<eos> Yeah, but how is he connected to goat dude?<eos> Now that's a good question.<eos> Help!<eos> Help!
Yeah, but how is he connected to goat dude?<eos> Now that's a good question.<eos> Help!<eos> Help!<eos> Help!
Ketch?<eos> Where's Mick?<eos> He didn't tell you?<eos> He flew back to London last night.<eos> After all the...
The kids have told me very nice things.<eos> Alicia basically made them come just in case you were in peril. Well, that was unnecessary, but very nice of you all the same.<eos> Andy, can we get a couple rooms for my children and their friends? Sure.<eos> It'll just be a minute.<eos> Great.
Jerk.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Okay, you got inside my Mom's head once before.<eos> What about me? You get me in?<eos> You?
And then you make a deal with Azazel.<eos> Yeah, it saved Dad's life, but I'll tell you something else that happened.<eos> Because on November 2, 1983, old Yellow Eyes came waltzing in to Sammy's room because of your deal.<eos> You left us.<eos> Alone.
They killed the girl that he loved.<eos> He got possessed by Lucifer.<eos> They tortured him in Hell.<eos> And he lost his soul.<eos> His soul.
You're my Mom.<eos> And I understand 'cause I have made deals to save the ones I love more than once.<eos> I forgive you.<eos> I forgive you.<eos> For all of it.
They did not.<eos> ♪ Cass?<eos> Thank you.<eos> For everything.<eos> Of course.
What is that?<eos> It's a tear in space and time.<eos> Uh, and that means?<eos> It's a doorway to another world.<eos> Anoth- - What, like Narnia?
He'll close it.<eos> You sure about that?<eos> I have faith.<eos> Really?<eos> In your unborn baby-God?
You know, Cass has faith in this kid. Mm.<eos> I hope he's right.<eos> But me?<eos> I have faith in us.<eos> You, me, Mom, Cass.
Trish Winterman of West Flintcombe has made an allegation of rape against an unknown attacker.<eos> If it happened at the party, that's a long list of people to eliminate.<eos> There were 50 men at your party on Saturday night?<eos> Yeah.<eos> At least 50.
We've got to get to what she knows as soon as we can.<eos> Brief Beth.<eos> She's got to get Trish in a fit state.<eos> Tom's been excluded from school for a week.<eos> - What for?
Did you go to the party by yourself?<eos> No, I was with my er... girlfriend, Sarah.<eos> She teaches geography.<eos> And were you together all night?<eos> Not all the time.
I just remember the light on the top.<eos> As I say, I was... a bit the worse for wear, by that point.<eos> Who got dropped off first?<eos> You or them?<eos> Er...
Two.<eos> Oh, wait, yeah, before I went outside, the girls had, erm... tequila shots.<eos> Two tequila shots.<eos> Sounds a lot when you add it up.<eos> Especially on an empty stomach.
Trish told us that you two have been out for a drink.<eos> A date.<eos> You said you only knew her through work.<eos> It was once.<eos> - Why only once?
Well, I sort of assumed it was Ian.<eos> You didn't hear the person behind you before you were hit?<eos> No.<eos> No.<eos> Only at the last minute.
- No.<eos> We're not talking about anything else.<eos> No Joe Miller.<eos> No. I... I promise.<eos> Just about us.
If you think there might be trouble...<eos> What was that, security?<eos> Just looking out for me.<eos> Does she know?<eos> About us?
You off somewhere?<eos> Yeah.<eos> A little break.<eos> Just, you know, just get a bit of space.<eos> Anywhere nice?
In the Anglers with my boyfriend, Leo.<eos> - What time did you get there?<eos> - Half seven.<eos> - What time did you leave?<eos> - Midnight.
- You watched me cooking.<eos> - I haven't watched you.<eos> I don't pay any attention to what you're doing.<eos> Clive!<eos> Oh, hi.
You chose not to be a client of ours.<eos> - I'm just a woman who's angry.<eos> - With me?<eos> With the man who did this to you.<eos> But, yeah, with you, a little bit.
Now get out.<eos> Fine.<eos> No, no, no, no.<eos> Not that way.<eos> Not through my house.
Garage and home.<eos> - Ever been to Abbots Chapel?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Ever drink in The Rising Sun there?<eos> Couple of times, yeah.
had a bit of an exchange.<eos> He's naughty.<eos> And later, service was over...<eos> He was being a bit cheeky, stashed me some champagne and asked if I wanted to go for a walk.<eos> What time?
I should have looked after him.<eos> Say it was me.<eos> Please.<eos> Did you know?<eos> All this time.
Fuck.<eos> Come on... OH, FUCK!<eos> Someone's hiding them.<eos> The Shaman... and Elena.<eos> Both of them.
That's a 30-foot tower, which is a very long way for a very small person to fall, even when she's inside a cage. But if you insist.<eos> - No, don't!<eos> - Please, she's just a baby.<eos> We'll do anything, anything. Just don't harm her.<eos> Anything?
- No, don't!<eos> - Please, she's just a baby.<eos> We'll do anything, anything. Just don't harm her.<eos> Anything?<eos> Anything?
Do you... take this woman to be your lawfully wedded wife?<eos> I do.<eos> - Do you take this woman...<eos> - Man.<eos> Man.
♪ You're a tasty treat You're a tasty treat ♪<eos> The sturdy oak barrier!<eos> They've broken through it!<eos> Gerta... don't let them take the children!<eos> - Onward. To the safe house. - Hmm.
Your left ankle, sir.<eos> Don't come near me with that thing.<eos> You've been coughing germs into it all day.<eos> Oh, if you're really who the children say you are, then germs are the least of your problem.<eos> Your left ankle... please.
It's not the screeching iguana clock.<eos> It's the screeching iguana!<eos> Take the van. Make sure they follow you.<eos> - But where are you going, boss?<eos> - International waters.
Okay, he's moving.<eos> Take him.<eos> Hands behind your head.<eos> Hands behind your head!<eos> On your knees.
They're mine.<eos> Hi.<eos> Sit.<eos> So, what, you want to try and cut a deal?<eos> A deal? No.
Chuck, it's... it's Armageddon.<eos> I'm gonna throw up. Today, I kicked ass at work.<eos> Whose ass did you kick?<eos> Rhoades.<eos> Big time.
A deliberate, criminal act to injure the company. An act by...<eos> Axelrod.<eos> Yes.<eos> An attack on us.<eos> On you.
Go get your program in place and wait for my word.<eos> Just so you know, my boat's draft is too deep for this dipshit marina.<eos> Thanks for coming.<eos> You're smoking again?<eos> What the fuck?
And you are aware that pretty much all of these people are superficial assholes.<eos> No, they're not.<eos> Look...<eos> I promise I will follow you wherever you want to go when you fall in love with a guy, okay?<eos> Or a girl.
Not another word.<eos> And you have impeccable timing.<eos> Sergeant Snyder is in my office.<eos> Did you okay J. Edgar doing an off the books investigation on Gunn?<eos> On me?
Dad, it's simple.<eos> Really.<eos> Remember that PEM?<eos> Slow.<eos> Polymer electrolyte membrane.
The cell separates into hydrogen and oxygen.<eos> Zoom, zoom.<eos> So, add water.<eos> Zoom, zoom.<eos> - Just water.
Where is he?<eos> Pedestrian tunnel at the Hollywood Bowl.<eos> - Harry.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> On my way.
That's something. What do you, uh...<eos> Wh-What do you do, Miss Kimke?<eos> Uh... Well, I'm a nursing assistant.<eos> Now, suppose I came down to where you do that...<eos> Your hospital...
We get what we need, and we get out, and that's it.<eos> How do I know that you're not gonna...?<eos> You know that I will if you don't.<eos> It's karma.<eos> For Chrissy.
Hey.<eos> - Hey, honey.<eos> - What's up?<eos> So you know, I just covered for your old boyfriend again.<eos> For the last fucking time.
I'm pretty sure that's only for hookers.<eos> But no, I'm not a cop.<eos> I'll take the oyster.<eos> Hey, thanks.<eos> - For what?
- It's not funny.<eos> - Oh, fuck science.<eos> - It's for science.<eos> - Here for lunch?<eos> - Yeah, just one.
It's tingly, though.<eos> So, you're into haunted houses?<eos> I write books and blog about paranormally tainted properties.<eos> Sometimes a homeowner brings me in to assess a situation.<eos> A situation?
I actually just... just embarking on a fellowship.<eos> Um, ohh, it never stops.<eos> I should have this thing surgically attached to my hand.<eos> I'm sure I could arrange that.<eos> Just one more second.
I am a monster.<eos> I just... I'm ... I'm sorry.<eos> It's just really hitting me how much I hate him.<eos> Hate who?<eos> My dad!
Put these on your feet.<eos> Turn to the right.<eos> Turn to the left.<eos> Face me.<eos> Left hand.
Oh, yeah?<eos> When did they start paying you?<eos> Sit here.<eos> - I gotta run, anyway.<eos> - Left hand.
The disciplinary board listens to extenuating circumstances.<eos> No, Chuck knows everybody at the bar.<eos> Hell, he made half their careers.<eos> It's gonna be him and his cronies versus me.<eos> Alone.
"This is America."<eos> Here, the righteous have no reason to fear.<eos> Here, those men have no power.<eos> And when they saw that I had no fear of them, they ran like the cowards they are.<eos> Back across the border.
And why would he do that?<eos> Doesn't sound particularly brotherly.<eos> I believe it was his hope that the tainted documents would cause the client to become disillusioned with my representation and return to their previous attorney, Ms. Wexler.<eos> Which, I should note, is precisely what happened.<eos> Objection.
On its own, I knew the tape would be somewhat flimsy, but it was a start.<eos> A foundation for a more ironclad case.<eos> I suppose that Jimmy must have felt the tape was decisive evidence on its own.<eos> Otherwise, he wouldn't have broken in to destroy it.<eos> Objection.
Well, honey, if it makes you feel any better, I'm all for it.<eos> Enough that you'd come again?<eos> - We'll see.<eos> - Well... thing is, I sort of volunteered you for something.<eos> What?
What a waste.<eos> I say... put your energy into the future.<eos> Anything else... is a waste of your time and intellect.<eos> What do you say?<eos> To new beginnings.

Next!<eos> The details will all be in a letter you'll receive shortly.<eos> Mostly legal boilerplate.<eos> Now, you give that nephew a hug for me.<eos> Niece!
Please hold.<eos> Thank you.<eos> So?<eos> I took the five.<eos> Then one more.
Now, that is $3,500, all in.<eos> That is the bargain of a lifetime.<eos> I don't know.<eos> Any chance you could do it on credit?<eos> On credit?
445 bucks.<eos> You know what that leaves me with?<eos> - $100. - $104.95!<eos> For writing, directing, producing, client outreach,<eos> - sales, transpo... all of it!
Look.<eos> It puts down a texture so the kids don't slip when it gets wet.<eos> Like this?<eos> You got it.<eos> Nice and gentle.
Under my own name.<eos> - This the way you handled it before?<eos> - Handled what?<eos> The money. For Fring's other guys.<eos> Other guys?
It was laying loose in the aisle.<eos> - Somebody call an ambulance!<eos> - No, you don't need to...<eos> I don't need...<eos> Yes, an ambulance.
I don't need...<eos> Yes, an ambulance.<eos> That's a good idea.<eos> You guys have liability insurance, right?<eos> To our "Four Corners Strategy..."
Caine and company go in the bank, get whatever it is they're after, we hit 'em on the way out.<eos> And risk it going away?<eos> Or better still, we move in now.<eos> Move in where?<eos> Inside the bank.
That's good.<eos> I don't think so.<eos> - How's the Alpha?<eos> - Not good.<eos> - How bad?
Now can I have a weapon, please?<eos> Relax, we got ya.<eos> Empty.<eos> Car is empty.<eos> What the...
They're safe.<eos> You'll be relocated.<eos> I was doing good work. Was I not?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Important work.
Proud of you, Dan.<eos> Yeah.<eos> - Well done.<eos> - Finally...<eos> A year later.
It's my daughter.<eos> They have my...<eos> My daughter... my Mattie.<eos> My baby.<eos> No way!
No noise.<eos> - There's too many kids.<eos> Do it now.<eos> - Roger.<eos> Heads up. On your toes.
Hi-tech, huh?<eos> You'd be surprised.<eos> Last thing they expect.<eos> Gives you more time.<eos> To what?
I'm sorry, baby.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> What for?
You will not... Let go of the need to avenge your sister.<eos> You know, when I fired the first bullet, she looked at me, confused.<eos> Like I was some random man with a gun.<eos> So I told her, "this is for your brother.<eos> And his sins."
- Burner phones. - This guy Bob.<eos> What time did he get to the office?<eos> - 7:20.<eos> - 20 minutes late.<eos> For an emergency?
Yes, but that's not my-!<eos> Elena!<eos> Hands.<eos> Get out.<eos> At the residence now...
My god.<eos> I'm gonna go check out number 26.<eos> Call this in.<eos> Where are we going?<eos> Federal prison.
What about you? Any hidden talents?<eos> I can cook.<eos> If you don't mind me asking, you in some kind of trouble?<eos> Someone took my girlfriend.<eos> To Texas?
Said he doesn't know anything.<eos> Yeah, nobody knows nothing.<eos> - Figures.<eos> - What about their military?<eos> Our military?
Well, I'm not sure about that.<eos> They already do.<eos> What?<eos> What did you tell them?<eos> About you?
We have eyes.<eos> - Hey, Rem, wake up.<eos> - Delta, move now.<eos> Moving in now.<eos> What the...?
No.<eos> That was you on that train.<eos> Maybe I will have that smoke now.<eos> Was Tomas Vitek your only target in Montreal?<eos> Cigarette, please.
Throw away the key.<eos> Walk away.<eos> Walk away.<eos> Thank you.<eos> For what?
Moving to the shrug now.<eos> I do want to get out of Russia, yes, but I can't.<eos> Why not?<eos> Not without my girlfriend.<eos> Your girlfriend?
- Me? - You.<eos> We're going to need a safe house to debrief Tatjana.<eos> Preferably one that you and only you know about.<eos> We all have one of those.<eos> For a rainy day.
For a rainy day.<eos> Gonna deactivate the alarm system with what'll look like a routine software update.<eos> No red flags. Buys you ten minutes.<eos> Hit it.<eos> Three, two, one.
How are you?<eos> Surprised.<eos> Can I get you anything?<eos> Would you like a water?<eos> A job.
- It's rough.<eos> No, it's great.<eos> It's incredible, actually, the little snippet I heard.<eos> Is that your thing?<eos> Music?
Well, it's not the Met Ball.<eos> Hey.<eos> When do you have to let Coach Clayton<eos> - know about football?<eos> - This weekend.
Gather round, kids.<eos> Let's see who's riding the ginger stallion tonight.<eos> Oh, no way!<eos> It's clearly pointing to...<eos> The new girl.
We heard what we heard and afterwards we didn't do anything.<eos> How would we explain why we were together at 6:00 a.m. on the 4th of July?<eos> Hello, Fred.<eos> - Can I get you anything?<eos> - A job.
I mean, she must be evil incarnate if even you won't have her as a friend.<eos> And on the subject of being friends,<eos> Betty, I'm sorry I've been such a witchy-witch to you.<eos> After Polly and Jason's epic demise I was angry...<eos> At everyone.
That family is pure evil.<eos> I'm wondering if the Blossoms didn't kill Jason themselves.<eos> Sacrificed him to some dark pagan god that they worship in that insane mansion of theirs.<eos> Mom, does Polly know?<eos> About Jason?
But a lack of heart and school spirit has never been the Riverdale way.<eos> Tonight's pep rally isn't like any other we've had in the past.<eos> And we shouldn't pretend that it is.<eos> Which is why I would like to dedicate this evening to the memory of one of our brightest.<eos> Jason Blossom.
Our story would be, we went for an early morning boat ride, and the boat tipped, and capsized, and Jason drowned.<eos> In fact, we made it to the other side dry as bones.<eos> We said goodbye on the Greendale side of Sweetwater River.<eos> He promised he'd call me as soon as he was in a place where he couldn't be reached or pulled back by our parents.<eos> One month, at the most.
Okay, that's beyond irrelevant, Chuck. You're not allowed to go around humiliating girls, for any reason, under any circumstances, you jerk.<eos> Look, I get you're not a closet kind of girl, but hey, if you wanna ride the Chuck Wagon, that can be arranged.<eos> Let's keep this simple, so that your preppy-murderer half-brain can grasp it.<eos> Take.<eos> This.
And proof or no proof, book or no book, I am going scorched earth on these privileged, despicable miscreants.<eos> You wanna get caught in that backdraft, Cheryl?<eos> Call me, or any of these beautiful, young, strong, intelligent women...<eos> "slut"<eos> one more time.
What were you doing down at the river so early on July 4th?<eos> - Working on some songs.<eos> - Were you alone?<eos> I saw something at Sweetwater River.<eos> Ms. Grundy's car.
Are you doing this because you still have feelings for Archie, or...<eos> No, Veronica.<eos> We're doing this because Grundy has Archie under some kind of sexual spell, and he won't listen to reason.<eos> We're looking for anything that proves Grundy isn't as clean as she says she is.<eos> Bobby pin.
Because it's what's best.<eos> I'll pack up my things, I'll be gone by morning.<eos> It's the only piece of property in my name and not your father's.<eos> - Betty, can I get you anything?<eos> - A job.
After this kid at my school died.<eos> It's his... It's his funeral this week.<eos> Actually, the first song I wrote was about him.<eos> How many hours a day do you spend writing?<eos> At least a couple.
I'm gonna just close this, not all the way.<eos> Yeah, um...<eos> Thanks, Dad.<eos> Goodbye.<eos> Hey, good timing.
Red 32.<eos> Red 32.<eos> Ready?<eos> Hut! Hut!<eos> Other side.
I hope this isn't weird, but Jason was crazy handsome.<eos> The handsomest.<eos> Something tells me he would've liked you.<eos> Why did you invite me tonight?<eos> Why not Tina?
What if we sang I Got You?<eos> Archie, I'm a Pussycat.<eos> We're headlining the Variety Show.<eos> What if you sang with them first and then me?<eos> Just this once?
I would hate for you to let him down.<eos> I understand, and I won't.<eos> Good, 'cause if you do, he will somehow blame me.<eos> Find yourself a new Cat.<eos> Someone skinny and beautiful.
Good, 'cause if you do, he will somehow blame me.<eos> Find yourself a new Cat.<eos> Someone skinny and beautiful.<eos> But not more skinny and beautiful than you.<eos> And a woman of color, please.
Spare me the details, Betty.<eos> Just tell me how I can be of assistance to my darling nephew or niece.<eos> Okay, uh, Polly needs money.<eos> For a safe place to live.<eos> And for medical stuff.
With a doctor?<eos> That you offered to pay for?<eos> Behind my back?<eos> So that she could fix her...<eos> Her mistake?
Ethel, I meant what I said.<eos> I'm sorry, Ethel, for everything my family did to yours.<eos> It's not your fault what your dad did.<eos> And you were there for me when no one else was.<eos> More than once.
I'm not normal, I'm not wired to be normal.<eos> How many more people did you invite to this thing?<eos> No one. Inner-circle only.<eos> Did you really think you could have a party without inviting moi?<eos> Or me?
Betty, what you and Veronica did when you guys got me kicked off the football team, you ruined any chance I had of playing for Notre Dame.<eos> Hell, for any good school.<eos> I'm sorry that after you sexually harassed those girls, that there were actual consequences, Chuck.<eos> That night, I saw the real you.<eos> The dark you.
So how does your mother have it?<eos> I...<eos> Hands off, Gollum.<eos> The only way your mom could have that ring is if she or your dad got it from Jason, and he wouldn't have given it up.<eos> Not over his dead body.
The other day, she threw a brick through the window.<eos> - Is that so? - Keep talking, Hal, and the next brick I throw may not be at a window.<eos> You remember our Homecoming, Alice?<eos> Hal?<eos> Back in the day?
What can I do for you, Mayor McCoy?<eos> Well, firstly, I was wondering...<eos> - Would you walk me up?<eos> - I'm sorry. What?<eos> To the stage?
But why?<eos> What couldn't he handle?<eos> So many questions, Cheryl...<eos> Okay, who can we rule out?<eos> My dad.
I don't know if he heard something he shouldn't have, or he saw something he didn't like...<eos> You don't know what you're saying...<eos> What was Jay-Jay running away from?<eos> The business?<eos> You?
You did a bad thing, Daddy.<eos> And now everyone knows.<eos> Sheriff. Your office told me that I would find you here.<eos> You need to see this. Both of you.<eos> That night,
But for Jughead and for Betty and Veronica, Dad, it's not over.<eos> They're still in it.<eos> Big time.<eos> We're all still in it.<eos> Up to our necks.
You hated him.<eos> Don't... Don't say that, Mommy...<eos> We've always been cursed ever since the original murder when brother killed brother.<eos> Who will the Grim Reaper take next? You?<eos> Me?
Because after that, you're never so sure again.<eos> I ever tell you how I got rid of the tats on my hands?<eos> No.<eos> Hold fast.<eos> To what?
No.<eos> Hold fast.<eos> To what?<eos> Life, brother.<eos> Everything.
It was a strange thing to see, I guess, this guy doing karate.<eos> Strange?<eos> Did he seem crazy to you?<eos> - Yeah, a little.<eos> - Objection.
- Yes.<eos> - So, you yourself, six weeks before the attack, judged Mr. Wilson fit to return to society.<eos> Obviously, it's a decision I now regret.<eos> I bet Susannah Fiorita regrets it, too.<eos> - Objection.
Control your client, Counsel.<eos> And, yes, why don't we take lunch?<eos> Your lunch is at 1:30 at the Boathouse with your daughter.<eos> The smart one or the other one?<eos> The other one.
And a man gets a needle prick and you can't look?<eos> Don't make the same mistake I did.<eos> Can we leave her out of this?<eos> Whenever I went to interview him in jail, and the guards would take off his handcuffs, he'd say, "Thank you."<eos> Every single time.
Where were you...<eos> The night Danny was killed?<eos> Studying.<eos> In the stacks.<eos> Like every night.
- No.<eos> There's no way that guy stops a lacrosse player like Byron Welch.<eos> Jafar and I lived together for maybe a month.<eos> He wasn't a bad guy.<eos> Not exactly a rave review.
I mean, was any of it worth it?<eos> Thank you.<eos> I'll use a peremptory, Your Honor.<eos> You're excused.<eos> Every Sunday.
Sometimes we have to do what's necessary<eos> - No matter the conequences.<eos> - Don't you dare.<eos> That is what I am doing, Olivia...<eos> My job.
I want to thank them.<eos> I-I need to thank them.<eos> Well, all donors are anonymous.<eos> I'll ask him if he wants to see you, but there are no guarantees.<eos> Him?
So, you visiting someone or...<eos> Yeah.<eos> Ask who.<eos> Well, whoever it is, I hope they're doing okay.<eos> My mom, yeah.
In?<eos> As in...<eos> Are you gonna put me in a coma?<eos> No, no.<eos> No coma.
It's a good thing I didn't reorganize the garage.<eos> Oh, honey, I'd have you committed.<eos> You... going out?<eos> I'm going to church.<eos> On a Wednesday?
The CIA.<eos> What does the CIA have to do with anything?<eos> - I think I missed something.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> Which part?
I never said he was my grandfather.<eos> You look just like her.<eos> Just like who?<eos> Your mother.<eos> Celeste.
Of course.<eos> Her death shattered both of them.<eos> Dr. Frost was... well, imagine losing the love of your life like that.<eos> The love of...<eos> Frost's life?
- Bravo!<eos> - Nearly universal.<eos> Now, now, no more about Heywood Broun.<eos> Nobody reads the "Tribune" anyway.<eos> To Scott Fitzgerald.
- Nearly universal.<eos> Now, now, no more about Heywood Broun.<eos> Nobody reads the "Tribune" anyway.<eos> To Scott Fitzgerald.<eos> To all of you for your infinite good taste.
A hell of a career.<eos> What am I supposed to do?<eos> Just chase you around the country and live off your money?<eos> Scott.<eos> To my enchanting, entrancing Zelda.
Why, I just asked them to get another one like the old one.<eos> - Zelda, we...<eos> - We what?<eos> Never mind.<eos> One minute.
Tickets, please.<eos> Tickets, please.<eos> Thank you.<eos> A cigarette.<eos> Lighter.
Oh, Rebecca, I love you.<eos> Oh. Y-you love me?<eos> You mean you love something about me.<eos> No.<eos> You.
Trust me.<eos> I got this.<eos> You know what, this is gonna be great.<eos> Uh, you seem great, but I...<eos> Just one sec.
"Number four...<eos> Red-haired Sarcastic Mom Lady."<eos> No, no, no!<eos> You can't, you can't fire any of these people.<eos> Especially not "Red-haired Sarcastic Mom Lady."
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.<eos> Please, please don't do this.<eos> Please don't do this.<eos> Can I talk to you in private?<eos> For just one-one second, one second, in private.
We'll start over, do things the right way.<eos> Rebecca, I love you.<eos> Oh... you love me?<eos> You mean you love something about me.<eos> No, you.
Sounds like something a super secure person says.<eos> Uh, well... you don't know us, and you don't know me, and you don't know us, so...<eos> Well, you are gonna miss something great around here.<eos> My father is just about to give us a huge client.<eos> Massive.
- We don't have to stay here.<eos> - Oh, please, don't be so dramatic.<eos> You came all this way to see your facacta cousin fumble through his haftarah.<eos> And, Becky, do you know what Torah portion they gave Skyler?<eos> What?
Will... you...<eos> Wait!<eos> ... marry...<eos> Please!<eos> ... me?
Oh, no.<eos> This place is a fortune.<eos> You're my best friend, and my best friend deserves a special meal.<eos> Best friend. Mm-hmm.<eos> Cheers.
This place is a fortune.<eos> You're my best friend, and my best friend deserves a special meal.<eos> Best friend. Mm-hmm.<eos> Cheers.<eos> Cheers.
The-the wedding venue called me, and-and we got off the waiting list.<eos> Whoa!<eos> When is it?<eos> What's the date?<eos> Like, next year?
And I actually have marvelous news.<eos> I'm now getting married in two weeks.<eos> Wow.<eos> Okay.<eos> To who?
Just take your check and get out of here.<eos> I never want to see you again.<eos> Fine.<eos> You're crazy.<eos> Little bit.
Not so sweet on the eye yourself.<eos> You getting any exercise?<eos> Are we married?<eos> You hate it, don't you?<eos> Retirement.
That'sbeenmeantome<eos> I'vegotaheartfull ofstone<eos> AndI hatethemisery And I hate the misery<eos> Thenyoucamealong<eos> Intomylife Into my life
Uh, new kind of router.<eos> Come on, come on, sit with me.<eos> Come on, honey, sit with me for just a second, could you, baby?<eos> Come on.<eos> Just a sec.
Yeah, that's... that's a good one.<eos> Thanks.<eos> I'll take this.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Not a chance.
The group above the proxy and governor-general.<eos> These Blackjacks. They can get through without being stopped?<eos> They have a transponder or something in their car that lets 'em get through without any interference.<eos> My buddy got in trouble for asking them too many questions once.<eos> He...
Cream of the crop.<eos> Only way to do it is an ambush.<eos> But we don't know their base of operations. Their habits. Where they report.<eos> They're in the bloc looking for you.<eos> Well, us.
I was hoping that I'd get to meet you. Sit.<eos> Sit with me.<eos> Please.<eos> Thank you.<eos> For what?
I'm sorry.<eos> Are you talking about me?<eos> Back, back, alien foe.<eos> Lest you feel the soft kiss of my trusty blade.<eos> To the top, lads!
Can you just excuse me for a minute?<eos> Dr. Bell, come on, you've done enough.<eos> Oh, I know.<eos> I just wanted to give you your award.<eos> - My award? - Mm-hmm.
Alex Reid, wild woman, there you go.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Uh, Manny, uh... why'd you stop believing in your path?<eos> The seminary... Why'd you leave?<eos> For real this time.
- I'll show you out, David.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> Not gonna get my deposit back if you keep knocking like that.<eos> How do I use my abilities against someone?<eos> Against someone?
Such as foot size.<eos> This is 27.5cm, the equivalent to a UK size ten.<eos> Now, the footwear seized from Michael Farmer's home and belonging to him was all a UK size eight.<eos> You believe this can't be Michael Farmer?<eos> Not only that.
I was ringing that bell for ages.<eos> You need to get it fixed.<eos> It's... It's silent.<eos> It's all controlled by my computer.<eos> For God's sake.
I just need to know that he's okay.<eos> - Name?<eos> - Bram Bowman.<eos> He's been moved out of the zone.<eos> The Factory?
Will you help me find him?<eos> Of course.<eos> You got any leads?<eos> I think he's in a street gang, working for a warlord named Solomon.<eos> Oh, shit.
At least he's usually willing to deal.<eos> But we got to get in his front door first.<eos> How do we do that?<eos> Go find someone.<eos> Just like old times.
We need her alive.<eos> I'm looking for--<eos> Let him go!<eos> Easy.<eos> Son of a bitch.
The magistrates agreed.<eos> I'm telling you, they're good, clean boys, with a good, clean image.<eos> - Nevertheless... - The odd rum and coke, that's The Wildwood drink, yes.<eos> But drugs?<eos> No.
- Yeah, we looked like a bunch of ponces.<eos> Yeah, so, what is it, then?<eos> Based on this poem by Baudelaire.<eos> Oh, no!<eos> Not more nursery rhyme stuff?
The late Barry Finch. Brickie's labourer to the stars.<eos> - Cause of death...<eos> - The strangulation?<eos> Oh, he was strangled, yes.<eos> Several times.
- Gotta be favourite, sir.<eos> He hates Mrs Pettybon with a passion.<eos> They clashed live on television last night.<eos> You're assuming she was the intended victim.<eos> For now, yes.
Clear your mind of all things.<eos> Let go of all earthly attachments.<eos> Become a leaf on a river.<eos> You are drifting downstream...<eos> towards nothingness.
- Only as part of an English breakfast.<eos> So what do you expect to find... beyond the door?<eos> The infinite.<eos> Infinite possibility.<eos> Infinite love.
- You got it, man.<eos> Anything, Ken.<eos> All right?<eos> - What's your role in this, Dr Bakshi?<eos> - My role?
Come to the Coroner's Court.<eos> Tell them that men like you should be protected.<eos> Stand up like this?<eos> No.<eos> Never.
He's not going there. Not now. Not ever.<eos> And if I could've brought them all home with me, I would have.<eos> Well, that means he's stuck with us, then.<eos> Where are they going?<eos> Work.
That will improve, as you get used to them.<eos> Ready for the grand unveiling?<eos> You may have to imagine the fanfare and the roll of drums.<eos> - Thank you ever so much.<eos> - Not at all.
And, as we are no longer quite so professionally intertwined, I can see no harm in accepting your invitation...<eos> Christopher.<eos> And my name is Beatrix, but people call me Trixie.<eos> Ohh!<eos> Left foot down on the clutch.
We can finish the investigation and you will be arrested, tried, convicted, and executed for the assassination of Frankie Vargas.<eos> Or you can step down.<eos> Withdraw.<eos> Health, grief, whatever... It doesn't matter.<eos> In exchange for which...
Of every offensive thing you've ever said to me, that might be the worst because that insults my intelligence.<eos> I'm not withdrawing.<eos> For the good of the country.<eos> Remember what you so generously handed me the night that Frankie was shot, what you called the most beautiful thing in the world?<eos> America?
I was in love... with you.<eos> That's the one thing that I'm sure of.<eos> And...<eos> I love you still.<eos> And despite your anger...
Families would have my picture... hanging in their dining rooms.<eos> Little kids would tell their teachers they want to be me when they grow up... me...<eos> And not just the gay ones.<eos> I mean, every last little boy and girl in this country... would be looking up to me.<eos> Me. I.
‐ I went somewhere.<eos> ‐ I took Summer to the beach.<eos> ‐ Oh, that's fun.<eos> Where'd you guys go?<eos> ‐ Down by the river.
‐ I took Summer to the beach.<eos> ‐ Oh, that's fun.<eos> Where'd you guys go?<eos> ‐ Down by the river.<eos> So not... not really the beach.
‐ Oh, that's fun.<eos> Where'd you guys go?<eos> ‐ Down by the river.<eos> So not... not really the beach.<eos> ‐ ‐ Just down by the river. ‐ Just down by the river.
Okay. Okay.<eos> Dusan is the intimate type, likes to work close in.<eos> He seems to prefer small calibre fire arms and sharp objects to do his damage.<eos> And from our reports, he seems to really love his job.<eos> A real piece of work.
Loud and clear, Mr. Rosenberg, but we'll take care of this, I promise.<eos> - What can we do?<eos> Would you like a drink? - A drink!<eos> Everybody in this room deserves a drink now.<eos> - On the house, right?
- Mrs. Franke?<eos> - Yes.<eos> What's that?<eos> - Package.<eos> Your signature please.
Bye.<eos> Hey, are you coming in?<eos> It's probably not a good idea, but I'll call you tomorrow for Christmas.<eos> Okay.<eos> Hey, Whit...
I'm taking Trevor and Stacey tomorrow to Central Park.<eos> Do you want to come?<eos> Yeah, I'd love to.<eos> Meet us at Poet's Walk at two?<eos> Okay, two.
- Hi.<eos> Matthew's getting out of the shower.<eos> He should be down in a sec.<eos> Is Henry coming?<eos> - In a minute. - Oh.
I...<eos> Hi.<eos> Hi.<eos> Bad timing?<eos> Perfect timing.
- There are others?<eos> - I just meant kids.<eos> So...<eos> I met someone.<eos> - A woman?
Because of mistakes I made.<eos> Terrible mistakes.<eos> I would only be a distraction if I stayed.<eos> - So, where will you go?<eos> - Volantis.
Good.<eos> If you don't mind my saying, I don't think you should return to Westeros.<eos> I'm not sure you'd be safe here.<eos> Oh, I will return, dear Spider.<eos> - One last time.
I've been chained and betrayed, raped and defiled.<eos> Do you know what kept me standing through all those years in exile?<eos> Faith.<eos> Not in any gods, not in myths and legends.<eos> In myself.
It's still the right plan.<eos> - The right plan!<eos> Your strategy has lost us Dorne, the Iron Islands, and the Reach.<eos> - If I have underestimated our enemies--<eos> - Our enemies?
- Archers!<eos> - Look alive!<eos> Get tight!<eos> Get in line, boys!<eos> - Ready!
Clegane, look into the flames.<eos> What do you see?<eos> A wall of ice.<eos> The Wall.
Last time I was here, I killed my father with a crossbow.<eos> Last time I was here, you killed my son with wildfire.<eos> There's a path to the left that hugs the cliff.<eos> The guards hardly ever patrol it.<eos> Too many steps.
What's in the boat?<eos> Not more gold.<eos> - Wine? - Mm.<eos> - I like wine.<eos> - Or hams.
Dead men, dragons, and Dragon Queens...<eos> Whatever stands in our way, we will defeat it.<eos> For ourselves, for our house, for this.<eos> Who will you say is the father?<eos> You.
- You're just Clovis, a smith who's come to pay his respects before he heads off to work at the Winterfell forges.<eos> Understood.<eos> Begging your pardon, Your Grace.<eos> You survived King's Landing.<eos> Yet again.
And you need to convince the one with the dragons or the one who fucks her brother?<eos> Both.<eos> How many men did you bring?<eos> Not enough.<eos> The big woman?
I don't give two shits about wildlings.<eos> Gingers, I hate.<eos> Gingers are beautiful.<eos> Kissed by fire.<eos> Just like you.
How did a mad fucker like you live this long?<eos> I'm good at killing people.<eos> - You don't look much like him.<eos> - Who's that?<eos> Your father.
We're soldiers.<eos> We have to know what we're fighting for.<eos> I'm not fighting so some man or woman I barely know can sit in a throne made of swords.<eos> So what are you fighting for?<eos> Life.
And you need to see things the way they do if you're going to anticipate their actions, respond effectively and beat them.<eos> Which I want you to do very much.<eos> Because I believe in you and the world you want to build.<eos> But the world you want to build doesn't get build all at once.<eos> Probably not in a single lifetime.
Kill him.<eos> He turned them all.<eos> You don't understand.<eos> The Lord brought you back... he brought me back...<eos> No one else, just us.
Can't see why the Lord of Light should be any different.<eos> Milady.<eos> Milady.<eos> It's an invitation.<eos> To King's Landing.
So, what?<eos> You just gonna sit around here another week and do nothing?<eos> I never make plans that far ahead.<eos> - Hey.<eos> Another bottle here.
Always has been.<eos> I don't follow.<eos> We don't need to look for some new virus that Arias is infecting people with.<eos> The virus is lying dormant inside of everyone.<eos> Even you.
- It's fine.<eos> - No, it isn't, Robin.<eos> You get torrential diarrhea.<eos> I can just take Monday off from work.<eos> Monday and Tuesday.
- Throw them out!<eos> - Out!<eos> - Wow, oh, okay.<eos> - Oh, God, okay.<eos> To ultimate power!
- Out!<eos> - Wow, oh, okay.<eos> - Oh, God, okay.<eos> To ultimate power!<eos> Power!
Oh, don't listen to Gragdor.<eos> His bark is worse than his many bites.<eos> Make a fried calamari out of him.<eos> Okay.<eos> On three?
His bark is worse than his many bites.<eos> Make a fried calamari out of him.<eos> Okay.<eos> On three?<eos> Yeah, on three.
In the meantime, you're free to go.<eos> All right, thanks.<eos> We should think about postponing the fight.<eos> What, and make Jeb a victim of circumstance?<eos> No chance!
Juvenile assault charge got you a stretch in a proovy school.<eos> I've put all that behind me.<eos> What time did you leave the club yesterday?<eos> Six-thirty?<eos> Seven?
He thinks Hoyle can beat you on the square.<eos> And what about you, Teddy?<eos> Huh?<eos> I know you can take him.<eos> On your day.
Not by a long shot.<eos> You, you knock him in the ear!<eos> You stupid woman!<eos> You going to hit me, too?<eos> And me?
You pushed his dead body down the stairs to make it look like an accident.<eos> That took some planning.<eos> This club is my church, Father.<eos> Where would those lads be if this closes?<eos> Back on the street.
Shall we?<eos> Yes.<eos> Father, will you give us your blessing?<eos> God be with you.<eos> Presbytery?
You know, I didn't know them.<eos> I didn't even know their names.<eos> We hear he might have had a falling out with some of them.<eos> Well, that'd be news to me. Cause, he was talking about how great it was gonna be this time and how much money they were all gonna make.<eos> This time?
By what?<eos> We're very interested and we'd like to take the next step.<eos> I'm open to that.<eos> Let us fly you up for the day.<eos> A formal interview?
- Scott Anderson.<eos> Just posted this thing about the Gunn case.<eos> You're featured prominently.<eos> "Detective Bosch could not be reached for comment."<eos> Fuck him.
- What could possibly go wrong?<eos> Yeah, brilliant, right?<eos> What's that gotta do with your vic?<eos> I need some general background.<eos> - On what?
But if we know about it, Holland's people know about it, too.<eos> Let's talk to her again.<eos> I'll set it up.<eos> See you later?<eos> Rain check?
I remember that.<eos> Remember what she looked like?<eos> Late 20s, Hispanic, dark hair.<eos> High heels and a red dress.<eos> At that hour?
Where are you with your big decision?<eos> We're getting there.<eos> If we're leaving, we have to figure out Paige and Henry.<eos> Maybe we plan a trip, family trip.<eos> Europe.
How can I know what he do now?<eos> At hospital, they ask me what happen?<eos> Over and over, what happen?<eos> I say, I not know, so they give me papers to read on suicide.<eos> And depression.
Meg Mitchell.<eos> Campaign statistician.<eos> And what rating would this campaign statistician give to Frankie Vargas' birthday party?<eos> 10.<eos> A solid 10.
What's the currency around here?<eos> Currency?<eos> How do I get things?<eos> Depends what you want.<eos> Pen and paper.
Just think about it.<eos> Now, you're gonna need the right stance if you're gonna block it properly.<eos> Okay, put your... Put your left leg back.<eos> Like this?<eos> Not so much to the side.
I saw it with my own eyes.<eos> Do me this kindness.<eos> Keith Bosko.<eos> Keith Bosko.<eos> Not on my watch.
But enough to go rattle his cage.<eos> Coming?<eos> Am I invited?<eos> You can thank Robertson.<eos> Why Robertson?
That where you were Saturday night?<eos> Charter?<eos> Nah.<eos> Date night.<eos> Zankou Chicken - and then...
Three time's a charm.<eos> No.<eos> Sorry.<eos> That it?<eos> For now.
Right.<eos> They arrived Dubai April 20 of this year.<eos> Nonstop flight Jet Blue out of LAX.<eos> They returned back to the States the same way October 7.<eos> And in between?
The truth is I think I wanted to make captain more than I wanted to actually be one.<eos> But I'm happy where I am with you assholes.<eos> Where you belong.<eos> That's right.<eos> To my assholes.
Have fun with Holden 2.0.<eos> But first, turn on the damn lamp.<eos> Okay.<eos> - At least I turned it on.<eos> - Yeah, for a second.
No, no, no, no!<eos> - What?<eos> - Wait.<eos> What's it gonna be?<eos> The red pill or the blue pill?
- What?<eos> - Wait.<eos> What's it gonna be?<eos> The red pill or the blue pill?<eos> Blue pill.
- Okay. Yes, Ma'am.<eos> - Gary, are you sure that this isn't too much medication?<eos> - People think we're married.<eos> - I think it's the perfect amount. How often are you visiting?<eos> - Oh, like, twice a day.
Now that the library is officially moving forward,<eos> - I really need clarity on my role.<eos> So it's time for you to make a decision.<eos> Yes, and I think I did, 'cause I talked to you about that.<eos> - About?
Lying?<eos> About what?<eos> So are you gonna tell him why you sleep on the couch, Dad?<eos> Holden, your mom and I, we've been separated.<eos> For over a year.
Gee, thanks.<eos> What we need to do is isolate your memories of the Realm... and once your mind can make sense of everything you've experienced...<eos> I can finally get a good night's sleep.<eos> Lie on your back.<eos> For luck.
Feels like I just got here.<eos> They know who you are.<eos> They know what you're going to do.<eos> Here.<eos> For luck.
I know who you are.<eos> No, it... it was too dark.<eos> Do you remember anything physical?<eos> Height, hair color?<eos> Clothing?
So if you ever need anything...<eos> Yeah.<eos> I need a ride.<eos> I don't usually rent month-to-month.<eos> One year minimum.
I mean, maybe it's...<eos> I don't know... Maybe you need to try something new.<eos> A sales job that doesn't require that you travel so much.<eos> Hello?<eos> Uh, just a moment.
We emailed about your time working with Arthur.<eos> You look just like her.<eos> Just like who?<eos> Your mother...<eos> Celeste.
You mean your former partner?<eos> The man you built the machine with?<eos> I found the tapes... in your safe.<eos> You kept a lot from me.<eos> Celeste.
I was the guy inventing new ways to screw up.<eos> I always tried to protect him, but... bad stuff happened anyways.<eos> But now... now I've got to be here for Holden.<eos> I'm going where the universe tells me.<eos> Universe, my ass!
Charlie...<eos> You don't get to say nothin' about Charlie.<eos> We were spinning cards while you were drinking milk from your mother's heroin tainted titty.<eos> Nothin' made me happier than the day he asked me to call him brother.<eos> Me.
Where's the ace?<eos> On top of the deck.<eos> You were dealing off the bottom.<eos> All right.<eos> Okay, one more.
I need to go home.<eos> We can talk later. All right?<eos> Where should I drop you?<eos> I don't know. Sometime last night.<eos> Yeah, one minute.
- I got to go.<eos> That's convenient.<eos> - What?<eos> - Where?<eos> Uh, town.
I'm upset because my own son doesn't want to see me.<eos> Oh, no, no, I do, I do want to see you, Mom. I do want to see you.<eos> Just... not all the time.<eos> Well, how often, then?<eos> Once a week?
Oh, no, no, I do, I do want to see you, Mom. I do want to see you.<eos> Just... not all the time.<eos> Well, how often, then?<eos> Once a week?<eos> More like once a month.
Son of a...<eos> Your guest has attracted some unwanted attention, but it's contained.<eos> How contained?<eos> I put one of them in your office.<eos> My office?
Hi, Dad.<eos> Willa.<eos> I'm surprised you remembered my name... or did she have to remind you?<eos> You look just like her.<eos> Celeste.
Come on.<eos> You got to know another way out of this bloc.<eos> We could use a coyote.<eos> You know one?<eos> One.
I just need to know that if there's a knock on my door, you will look after Gracie.<eos> Of course I will, Katie.<eos> But nothing's gonna happen to you.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Oh, of course.
By a bumblebee.<eos> He's very reliable.<eos> Ma'am.<eos> Is this what you meant?<eos> My office.
- You good?<eos> I can get your bag. - I got it.<eos> Tough kid.<eos> I don't know where he gets it.<eos> From his mom, probably.
I don't think you're weak.<eos> I... I think you have a conscience.<eos> Do you have a conscience?<eos> Do you ever think of the people who are dead because of you?<eos> Every day.
What are we gonna do?<eos> We're gonna get through it... together.<eos> Can't be any more lies between us.<eos> I know.<eos> One second.
I'm on medication.<eos> Just like high school.<eos> Your dad was such a loser.<eos> He never drank. He never went to parties. He was afraid to talk to girls.<eos> - Lila. - Hey.
I'm done, too.<eos> Can I be excused?<eos> Sure, sweetheart.<eos> Thank you for dinner.<eos> Anytime.
Ally, I told you yesterday, I really...<eos> No, look, I had a... a really significant day.<eos> I was at Woodlawn and I was counseling a grieving mother.<eos> And it went so well they've offered me a job.<eos> A job?
To talk about you.<eos> When you got back to Montauk, you seemed... clearer.<eos> Seeing you, seeing you with Joanie, just brought a lot of thoughts back to me.<eos> Well, what kind of thoughts?<eos> About us.
What was that? - It's Bertha!<eos> - Who's Bertha?<eos> She's the crazy lady in the attic.<eos> You know, in the story.<eos> My musical?
- It's eight o'clock.<eos> Yeah, I know.<eos> I just need a minute.<eos> Can I have one minute?<eos> One minute alone?
I don't know how to fix it.<eos> I don't need you to fix things.<eos> Why are you still visiting him?<eos> He made some mistakes.<eos> Some mistakes?
Since when did you become such a chess expert?<eos> I play with Vik sometimes. He's been teaching me.<eos> Vik taught him.<eos> Yeah, and he taught me how to make chicken vindaloo.<eos> Chicken what?
- What good would that do?<eos> You know, look...<eos> Scott was a deeply troubled guy, and he was trying his best to hurt me.<eos> Yeah, I-I'm sorry for what happened to him, but I am not going with you to his mother's house.<eos> No way.
And you're gonna walk away.<eos> Gotta go.<eos> I cut you.<eos> Show me your other hand.<eos> The other one.
They're Secret Service, Dad.<eos> They're there for my protection.<eos> And Huck...<eos> Still conducting regular sweeps for listening devices here and at the office?<eos> Every Wednesday.
But I may exhibit an ounce of mercy when I take your life.<eos> Tough talk from someone who sat quietly in a chair waiting for daddy to come home from work.<eos> Or I could kill you now.<eos> With the gun in your holster?<eos> All three of us?
Rando psychos.<eos> Hey, don't do that.<eos> Don't make cat noises just because a woman says she doesn't like another woman.<eos> I'm just saying... you sound kind of jealous of her.<eos> Jealous?
I'll get on this.<eos> We'll track her down.<eos> You let me know as soon as you find something.<eos> Are you gonna apologize?<eos> - For what?
How many strings are attached to this offer?<eos> I'm willing to bet there's at least 300 million of them.<eos> Am I right?<eos> Well, I guess that depends.<eos> - On?
I'm willing to bet there's at least 300 million of them.<eos> Am I right?<eos> Well, I guess that depends.<eos> - On?<eos> - You.
You're not even sleeping anymore.<eos> I mean, 1600 Penn, it's just ruining all the fun, Ab.<eos> I can't wait to have you to myself again.<eos> Maybe take you on a little vacation?<eos> Perhaps a little Hawaii action?
No, we can't perform an autopsy until the Joint Pathology Center orders one.<eos> Well, what are they waiting for?<eos> - Me.<eos> - What are you waiting for?<eos> The president.
This dolt, this mannequin.<eos> It's not too late, you know?<eos> For you.<eos> For me?<eos> You.
I mean, couldn't I just be, like,<eos> "America's friend" who knows all of America's favorite karaoke songs, but is always down to duet"?<eos> Anyway, my fans have been so good to me, and I am so proud to be the next Princess.<eos> I am really hopeful I'm gonna find a genuine connection.<eos> My sweetheart.
They took him from his rightful place.<eos> Cyrus was his choice.<eos> We have to do what is right.<eos> If anyone deserves to wear the white hat right now...<eos> White hat?
We talked about...<eos> Arresting your father will solve this!<eos> The FBI needs a head on a spike.<eos> There is no way in hell I am letting you go to prison for life... when he's guilty and you're not!<eos> No chance!
Mellie Grant.<eos> What do you have to be sorry about, Red?<eos> Tennessee votes with the following result...<eos> - Mellie Grant.<eos> - All of it.
I told you!<eos> And for some reason, you find it very hard to believe that if I had to choose between you and him, you will lose!<eos> You want to stop yelling at me?<eos> You saw your father taken into custody.<eos> My custody.
You don't actually care, And I don't actually care to answer.<eos> My father was just saying that...<eos> That I appreciate the protection. And the hospitality, mr.<eos> President, But I need to go to paris.<eos> Paris?
Of course, Sir.<eos> Have the mayors been briefed?<eos> - All nine, sir.<eos> - I'd like them followed up with.<eos> Every hour, on the hour.
I know!<eos> I know I've done terrible things, but...<eos> She was my friend, and you murdered her.<eos> I was doing my job.<eos> Your job?
I know I've done terrible things, but...<eos> She was my friend, and you murdered her.<eos> I was doing my job.<eos> Your job?<eos> Your job?
You never wanted control.<eos> You don't know what control is.<eos> You are so...<eos> And she loves you.<eos> You!
Tell me about the bar fight.<eos> T-That's what that wack podcast called it, but it didn't get that far.<eos> They made it clear I wasn't welcome there, words were exchanged, and I walked away before anything really happened.<eos> And that was the last time I saw him, I swear.<eos> The next morning,
This is just...<eos> It's wrong.<eos> Abby, I don't think you should be attempting to dictate what's right and what's wrong for any of us ever again.<eos> Wait, where are you going?<eos> To my room.
And take, Nacho here with you.<eos> I knew it.<eos> I could smell the wet on your back.<eos> My fiancée invited me here in case there was trouble, and I was really hoping there'd be trouble.<eos> Back to your corner.
You'd rather put me in chains than help your own girl out.<eos> That's okay.<eos> But just so you know, if something happens to our Livvie, that's on you.<eos> ♪ Go down, Moses ♪<eos> ♪ Way down to Egypt's land ♪
That's you talking, not her.<eos> Maybe I could convince her to speak with you against her better judgment.<eos> Yeah?<eos> - What's that gonna cost me?<eos> - Answers.
People like Charlie, people like me, we're... dangerous.<eos> And how can we...<eos> How can I...<eos> Thank you.<eos> For your help today.
Mmm.<eos> You mean, like, all Earthers aren't scumbags?<eos> And some Belters are just full of shit?<eos> I didn't say it was the whole story.<eos> Just the useful part.
He says it's talking to him.<eos> What does that mean?<eos> He says there is more protomolecule out there.<eos> But Phoebe's gone. We drove Eros into Venus. - We killed it.<eos> - Apparently not all of it.
Ready?<eos> Three, two, one.<eos> Don't shoot, boss man.<eos> You got me.<eos> Just me.
Jesus, Harry.<eos> You know, we were just saying good food, good friends, - good feelings. - Yeah.<eos> Crap!<eos> It's 170!<eos> For God's sake.
- Look out, Mason.<eos> - Hey, come on, Mick.<eos> No.<eos> While Orange County deputies are trying to identify the body of a man who's washed ashore early this morning...<eos> Now Rampart?
I do not expect anything.<eos> I think you do.<eos> And I think if you're not careful, it will eat you alive.<eos> Thanks for the ride.<eos> Any time.
Things change.<eos> You're like a turtle.<eos> Your shell's where you're safe, but nobody gets under there with you.<eos> Not really.<eos> Not even me.
My name is Mud.<eos> And these... are your wellies!<eos> Do you know where Delphine went just now?<eos> Uh, to work, I think.<eos> At the clinic.
They must have locked it on their way out.<eos> - What?<eos> - It's time.<eos> He wants to see you.<eos> Me?
The fruits of nearly 200 years of Neolution science are now within our grasp.<eos> And we, here, shall drink from the fountain first.<eos> - Freeze!<eos> - Woah!<eos> On your knees, hands on your head.
Wait, come here.<eos> - Fifth one's free.<eos> - Hmm, thanks.<eos> The reviews for Kelsey's boyfriend's book are out.<eos> Ex-boyfriend.
- Yeah.<eos> - I've been to your home, it's...<eos> - Elegant, yes.<eos> I plan to Hygge it up. You know.<eos> So, Saturday, 7:00 sharp.
The Halcyon Hotel!<eos> The stories these walls could tell.<eos> The people who fell in love.<eos> The people who fell out.<eos> The joy.
I'm just not part of getting this family into this mess.<eos> Well, you did bring Lance into our lives.<eos> I need to talk to your cousin.<eos> Yeah, about his friend, Mikhail Baryshnikov?<eos> Marius Josepovich.
We have to leave right now. You go get Jacob.<eos> I won't make you deal with that one. - Thanks for that.<eos> - Well, don't thank me yet.<eos> You're still gonna have to put her back down at Taylor's.<eos> Why?
Could be tomorrow, could be another three months.<eos> Could be... Yeah.<eos> Well, I guess I'll go.<eos> I'll try to bring a.J. By tomorrow.<eos> Or Friday.
Let me rephrase that.<eos> What...?<eos> Do you know who I work for?<eos> Do you know how much I don't care?<eos> About what?
So I hear. Hmm.<eos> How do you take it?<eos> Usually alone.<eos> Thank you for making an exception.<eos> Please.
I guess I found it all stimulating enough.<eos> Hm. Normandy?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Omaha beach.<eos> By way of north Africa and Sicily.
I'm a private investigator.<eos> I'm doing some work for your boss.<eos> And apparently doing it with a fresh new take on the word "private."<eos> Can I buy you a drink?<eos> Hmm. Bottle of PBR.
Ah. Problem?<eos> Not-not when you're pulling down 25 bucks a day plus expenses.<eos> And what sort of daily expenses does a semi-private investigator incur?<eos> Bullets?<eos> Daily.
There.<eos> Plus tip.<eos> How about the tip of my cock?<eos> Stop it! So, in that scenario, would I take your penis in my hand?<eos> My mouth?
Plus tip.<eos> How about the tip of my cock?<eos> Stop it! So, in that scenario, would I take your penis in my hand?<eos> My mouth?<eos> Asshole.
Because I don't need a spirit animal, and if I did, he'd be an ocelot.<eos> Okay.<eos> Observe and report.<eos> So easy, even a cop could... wait.<eos> What the...
You're his mortal enemy, Supergirl.<eos> The person he fears most.<eos> You will take everything from him, so, this time, he will not hesitate.<eos> This time, he will protect his planet.<eos> - This time...
It's okay, I got you.<eos> I'm here.<eos> I'm here.<eos> Let's just stay here a little while longer, okay?<eos> How long?
What?<eos> Dakkam Ur.<eos> No.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> No way in hell...
So, uh, the fight between Rhea and Supergirl...<eos> Go on.<eos> Uh, Supergirl gave us an exclusive interview.<eos> - In exchange for?<eos> - A request.
On my honor.<eos> And if I defeat you, your invasion ends.<eos> You leave.<eos> Once and for all.<eos> For the Earth.
And if I defeat you, your invasion ends.<eos> You leave.<eos> Once and for all.<eos> For the Earth.<eos> For the Earth.
I felt you fall away.<eos> You needed me.<eos> I hope you didn't come out of a sense of duty.<eos> Can you stay?<eos> For a while.
That will save us ten million on this trade.<eos> This is why I need to keep you.<eos> I'd believe the same thing were I you.<eos> - Whoa! - You've been served.<eos> - With a lawsuit?
- Has it?<eos> Or did the two of you work in a separation to make Axelrod's payment more palatable?<eos> They're not connected.<eos> How long after the payment did you end your employment at Axe Capital?<eos> The same day.
And his connection to the murder weapon was irrefutable... a Marine-issue KA-BAR knife covered with his prints and DNA and Mr. Euley's blood residue on the blade.<eos> Julio, ask Dr. Morales to put together the autopsy report from Mr. Euley's death.<eos> Okay, I don't know how to explain the radio, but Ortiz could've wrapped something around the hilt of the knife, like a plastic bag.<eos> If he was being that careful, why not wipe the blade after?<eos> And the hilt.
And here's the best part.<eos> You already know how to do it.<eos> Mary.<eos> What color is the wall?<eos>  White.
You love Mary.<eos> That's what matters.<eos> That's what you have to ask yourself.<eos>  Yeah, I love her.<eos> All of her.
Martin, I'm Dr. Bell.<eos> I'm gonna take your pulse, see how your heart's doing, okay?<eos> Just... just send them!<eos> Who?<eos> Everyone!
The second we get it off, we're gonna be dealing with a ticking time bomb, all right?<eos> But right now, this is our only option.<eos> We move fast, we move smart, and we save his life.<eos> - You got it? - Yeah.<eos> On three.
We move fast, we move smart, and we save his life.<eos> - You got it? - Yeah.<eos> On three.<eos> You ready?<eos> One...
You know, it might not be a bad idea.<eos> A woman president, women's college, three hours from New York.<eos> And the fall foliage is amazing!<eos> You know what, can I just say something?<eos> Fuck Yale University.
Fuck Yale University.<eos> - Fuck Yale.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I'm not really comfortable with that kind of language.<eos> Fuck Yale University.
Hey...<eos> Go ahead.<eos> Hey, officer?<eos> Something we should show you.<eos> Just like Christmas.
But maybe he's still out there.<eos> The only thing I can hope is that he come home again.<eos> Well, you guys take care of yourself now.<eos> - And thank you for what you did.<eos> - Yes, ma'am.
Let's go cheer him up.<eos> Let's.<eos> Been waitin' for this my entire life.<eos> What do you want?<eos> The truth.
That you are a piece of shit.<eos> You're the kind of man who preys on children.<eos> And you killed that boy, BB.<eos> I'm a lot of things, Collins.<eos> Some bad and some worse.
You and your uncle liked the little boys, don't you?<eos> Now, I know you don't mean to hurt 'em, But you just can't help yourself.<eos> Isn't that right, Leonard?<eos> I got a knot in my shoulder.<eos> A little to the left next time.
Am I right?<eos> Am I right?<eos> I'm telling you right now, that running away shit,<eos> It follows you like a goddamn shadow, Sometimes in the front, sometimes in the back.<eos> No matter what...
I got it.<eos> Good.<eos> Hurry it up, then.<eos> Have a good evening, judge.<eos> What the...
I think I'm falling in love.<eos> With who?<eos> Florida.
- I didn't.<eos> - And she sold it to a chop shop.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> She needed the money.<eos> - For a boob job.
You're weird, but lovely.<eos> What I'm doin' here, what I'm tryin' to do here is important.<eos> It's probably the most important thing I ever done in my life.<eos> Who are you kiddin'?<eos> Not myself.
You don't like your book?<eos> I'd rather be outside.<eos> Why you think Leonard gave you that book in the first place?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Punishment?
One of my kids saw Ivan gettin' in the car - with some guy in the parking lot.<eos> - Goddamn it!<eos> Hey, hey, hold on, hold on.<eos> We know where he's takin' him.<eos> - The crypt!
They're tricksters!<eos> Go and do what I say.<eos> I'm-a take that shotgun and shove it up your ass.<eos> I sincerely doubt that.<eos> Down on your knees. Down.
- What is it?<eos> It's a hangover cure El and I used when we got the shakes.<eos> I amped it up with Nightshade and a couple of Ativans.<eos> Might make you a little woozy, but it could do the trick...<eos> Temporarily.
Sprinkling... shit?<eos> Shoveling, mixing, drying, hauling.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Sprinkling it on... what?<eos> Crops.
Yeah, I got a cramp.<eos> Which one?<eos> Both, actually.<eos> I feel guilty.<eos> Why?
Okay, vague.<eos> Mildly helpful, I guess.<eos> It's all I got.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Sure.
It's over.<eos> - The riot's over?<eos> - Holy shit.<eos> They're coming to rescue us?<eos> "Us"?
Where's my cell phone?<eos> I have to call him.<eos> I haven't called him.<eos> Uh, I traded it.<eos> For this.
Well, ain't that some Sesame Street BS.<eos> You get that we about to be mowed down like some lawn gnomes and it's your fault, right?<eos> You know I was just trying to get justice for... Poussey.<eos> Yeah. It stopped being about her and started being about your pride a long time ago.<eos> Down on the ground!
I'm pregnant!<eos> - Get down on the ground!<eos> Get your pregnant ass on the ground!<eos> Now!<eos> On the ground!
- I'd care.<eos> - You would be dead.<eos> Well, I guess I'm already dead to my family.<eos> I don't know who my dad is and my mom is probably neck deep in her own bucket of bleach right now.<eos> One second.
Goddamn, I wish I was high.<eos> Frieda, what do we do?<eos> We keep our dignity.<eos> Move it up, ladies.<eos> Single file.
We can see proof of the Greatest Day all around us.<eos> Where are you getting these ideas?<eos> Let's continue with the lesson, okay?<eos> Don't move.<eos> Back in line.
This is what happens when you break the rules.<eos> You answer to me.<eos> Right, one more row. Come on.<eos> Let's go!<eos> Back to work.
That's exactly what I told Nolan.<eos> But given my lowly position, who am I to deny the request of the Deputy Proxy?<eos> What did he see?<eos> I made sure to only show him the empty ones and that seemed to satisfy his curiosity.<eos> For the moment.
W-what are you doing?<eos> If I tell you what they're doing and you catch them, will you send me home?<eos> I promise I'll do everything I can.<eos> They're planning an escape.<eos> When? During our shift today.
The moment I first saw you on that bus, I knew you were one of us.<eos> What do I need to do?<eos> Our group has a tradition.<eos> Before our missions, we make a toast.<eos> To liberty.
What do I need to do?<eos> Our group has a tradition.<eos> Before our missions, we make a toast.<eos> To liberty.<eos> To liberty.
Bad day?<eos> Some good news maybe?<eos> Bram is scheduled to be released from the labor camp.<eos> When?<eos> Six months.
- Hold up.<eos> They do not put foreskins in face creams.<eos> Yes, they do.<eos> It helps bloody collagen<eos> - or something like that.
Then you better siphon some gas.<eos> Siphon?<eos> With what?<eos> How 'bout that?<eos> No way.
At least let me ask what God was doing here.<eos> Why do all men come to these dumbass places?<eos> First time is for the girls, and if they come back, it's for one girl in particular.<eos> He fell in love?<eos> With who?
Belters will never unify under Fred Johnson's flag.<eos> His days on Tycho are numbered.<eos> He says there is more protomolecule out there.<eos> But Phoebe's gone. We drove Eros into Venus. - We killed it.<eos> - Apparently not all of it.
No Belter do.<eos> You na want for fight no more then go back for your real home.<eos> Dawes gonna be fist for the Belt.<eos> Put him in the hole.<eos> Diogo!
When the Earth forces withdrew, the MCRN pushed all of their ships into the relief effort.<eos> Get back, que!<eos> He doesn't seem to enjoy being a Good Samaritan.<eos> There's no money in ferrying refugees.<eos> Or botanists.
Every time, automatic.<eos> Like physics.<eos> Eye contact, perversion.<eos> So I gave her extra chips.<eos> Every time, extra chips.
Time is the space made by our lives where we stand together, forever.<eos> Time And Relative Dimension...<eos> In Space.<eos> It means life.<eos> - Just chips, yeah?
Go and look in it.<eos> - You want me to look in a puddle?<eos> OK, I'm looking.<eos> - What am I looking at?<eos> - Your reflection.
What is that?<eos> That's me, that's my face, but...<eos> It's wrong.<eos> - Hey!<eos> - Sorry. Some other time.
Scorch marks.<eos> Interesting.<eos> Right, you.<eos> - Let's get you on the bus!<eos> - The what, the bus?
I'll tell you what it isn't.<eos> It isn't a freak optical effect... and it's following me.<eos> No, no, what are you doing?<eos> I'll tell you what, let's just pop into my box.<eos> Your box?
Seriously?<eos> But it spent ages laying around, being a puddle, what changed?<eos> Your friend.<eos> She looked into it, didn't she?<eos> More than once.
This is the most exciting thing that's ever happened to me in my life.<eos> The only exciting thing! I'm sorry.<eos> OK.<eos> Let me remember just for a week.<eos> Just a week.
OK.<eos> Let me remember just for a week.<eos> Just a week.<eos> OK, well, just for tonight.<eos> Just one night.
I believe the body's already been collected by the undertaker.<eos> How many's that?<eos> It won't do, Powell.<eos> Mrs Ethel Zacharides.<eos> Sixties.
There we are, sir.<eos> Don't worry, sir, you're gonna be all right.<eos> - Thank you, gentlemen.<eos> - Get him straight in.<eos> Straight to surgery.
But Edgar's had a very bad stroke.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> - You're still at er...<eos> Byers Hall? - What a memory you have.<eos> Hm. Well, for some things.
But there was a little bit of money went missing, and he had a diamond tie pin that belonged to his father.<eos> Hospital denied it, of course, said she must have been mistaken.<eos> Could she have been?<eos> Any case, she said someone from the hospital had written to say they'd be coming by on Friday to discuss it.<eos> On Friday?
What do I know about flying a desk?<eos> - Any word?<eos> - Perforated peptic ulcer.<eos> The operation's gone as well as could be hoped for.<eos> And Bakewell?
- Same as Bakewell.<eos> - How'd it go?<eos> - You wouldn't have enjoyed it.<eos> But he appears to have been another victim, according to Dr DeBryn.<eos> - Anything on Powell?
And he said that you'd never amount to much.<eos> You didn't even pass your sergeant's exam.<eos> You see, I was right about you, even then.<eos> When you speak to Susan, then please just give her my condolences.<eos> And your love?
Local wise woman... or not.<eos> She were hanged.<eos> Agnes.<eos> Tested and hanged.<eos> - For what?
Elliott Blake, Director of Operations.<eos> Welcome to Bramford.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - And this is your photographer, is it?<eos> For today.
Maybe.<eos> Or maybe someone's trying to tell me something.<eos> Like what?<eos> "Go west, young man."<eos> Or south.
People talk, especially in Bramford.<eos> - So he came, then?<eos> - Yes.<eos> We ate... and he must have left about 10:00.<eos> That night?
I can't even imagine what you're going through, considering what's going on.<eos> - Sean's been arrested.<eos> - What?<eos> Yeah.<eos> For murder.
We need to find out more about this.<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Okay, let's do that.<eos> Are you just... leaving me up here?<eos> All alone?
- You sure this is enough?<eos> - It's all I could get.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - Where are you going?<eos> - The spice shop.
- Right, right.<eos> - I'll take 'em both.<eos> - Okay, hurry.<eos> Oh, don't forget to keep Renard home tonight.<eos> For how long?
Crap!<eos> It's Sean.<eos> - How do I get out of here?<eos> - You don't.<eos> - In the closet.
S... Sean, if you want this to work out, we're gonna have to be spending more time together.<eos> I understand, just not tonight.<eos> Well, there are things we need to talk about.<eos> - Like what?<eos> - Well, your daughter, for one.
Well, then I better have a talk with myself... face-to-face.<eos> My loft, 20 minutes.<eos> I'll be on the roof.<eos> Renard only has one thing he can use against you.<eos> My son.
_<eos> _<eos> Smile.<eos> - Okay, we're done.<eos> - No, no, just a couple more.
- What are the Hours of Dread?<eos> - And how many are there?<eos> I don't know, it just says<eos> - "until El Cuegle is certain."<eos> - Certain of what?
Uh, longer than five years. Maybe more.<eos> We'll know more when we get the bugs back.<eos> But some of her skin was somehow preserved and hardened into a waxy shell.<eos> I took subcutaneous samples and found traces of an enzyme - I've never seen before.<eos> - Similar to anything?
Three?<eos> - Apparently, yes.<eos> - Well, congratulations!<eos> - Thanks.<eos> - Really happy for you guys.
- In Latin.<eos> - Oh, let's find out what it means.<eos> So what, does your victim look like that?<eos> One of them.<eos> Uh-oh. There more than one?
His park.<eos> I mean, come on.<eos> No wonder he donated the land.<eos> That's where he's taking the girl.<eos> - What girl?
I want you to be safe.<eos> - It's you, isn't it?<eos> - What?<eos> How... how did you get into my room?<eos> - Your room?
We're never just thinking that.<eos> But one could always hope.<eos> We know he's our killer.<eos> What are we looking for?<eos> A reason.
- Sure you're ready?<eos> If I don't get into that hotel room pretty soon, I'm gonna fall asleep in the lobby.<eos> Need a room?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Just one night?
So him and all of you are gonna pay for it.<eos> No, we're not.<eos> These are my friends and the people I love.<eos> And you are messing with a pregnant woman!<eos> Help!
Yeah.<eos> There was a mirror.<eos> I looked into it.<eos> What did you see?<eos> Me, at first.
I got kind of mixed feelings about this. I mean, I love trees.<eos> It's not a normal tree, Monroe.<eos> Yeah, but still.<eos> "I think I shall never see a poem as lovely as a..." blood-sucking Jubokko tree.<eos> Just in case.
- Do you know where?<eos> - Through the hole in the mirror.<eos> I don't think we have a lot of time left before it gets here.<eos> You think it's all mirrors Eve can't look into?<eos> Or just certain mirrors?
Big black one.<eos> "Charms and Spells."<eos> So I guess that's where that came from.<eos> And it's locked.<eos> With the dagger.
They're in a bad place.<eos> - Where are they?<eos> - The other place.<eos> What other place?<eos> Through the mirror.
Not gonna hurt you.<eos> This is a gun.<eos> I use it to... Kill bad things, like killing...<eos> Blutbaden.<eos> And, um, Hundjaeger, and... - Schakal.
And, um, Hundjaeger, and... - Schakal.<eos> - Ja, Hundjaeger,<eos> Schakal, ja.<eos> Kakenkopf?<eos> Yeah, Kakenkopf.
March 24th.<eos> Dad is just gonna help us find Nick and Eve.<eos> - Where are they?<eos> - The Other Place.<eos> Through the mirror.
We're not gonna let anybody near you.<eos> Honey, come with me, okay? Come on.<eos> I spoke to my Russian friend.<eos> They showed me the tunnel.<eos> And the stick.
'Tis almost as if to keep your mind from thinking.<eos> Whereas you, my love, think too much.<eos> If you recall, my dear, I was against you riding at all with barely a month to go before the child.<eos> - Perhaps it was a little reckless.<eos> - And not for the first time.
Elizabeth?<eos> Elizabeth?<eos> Elizabeth?<eos> Elizabeth?<eos> Help!
I'll insist we have first call on his services in future.<eos> - What other doctor is hereabouts?<eos> - Dr Enys?<eos> That quacksalver?<eos> Absolutely not.
- As you now mean to escape yours?<eos> - George is not my family.<eos> Geoffrey Charles is.<eos> I must trust him to his mother's care.<eos> And the child?
I'm a respectable country squire now.<eos> With a home, a mine, a family and a wife.<eos> I should make the most of what life has to offer.<eos> Including' me?<eos> Especially you!
I'm having a small gathering here next week.<eos> Perhaps you'd favour me with your company and that of your charming wife?<eos> We'd be delighted.<eos> Do 'ee never go to church, sister?<eos> Once a year on Christmas Day.
Francis and I used to play here when we were boys.<eos> Perhaps Geoffrey Charles will do the same with Valentine.<eos> - You fear for him?<eos> - Who?<eos> Geoffrey Charles.
Preferably not on my land!<eos> Valentine George, I baptise thee in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost.<eos> Verity will be there.<eos> And Caroline.<eos> At the christening.
I wouldn't presume to compare my small enterprise with yours.<eos> But I trust we have things in common.<eos> A concern for the conditions in which miners work, a wish to improve them.<eos> Have a care, or you'll be called a Jacobin.<eos> Like yourself?
What I say is that you will find me the names of these Methodists.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> And let us not be too hasty with our deed of gift.<eos> It may not be needed after all.<eos> Just like old times.
Since arriving here, I have made no attempt to venture beyond Roscoff, nor to act contrary to the interests of France.<eos> You act entirely against it by spending a single night on French soil without reporting to the gendarmerie.<eos> My apologies, monsieur, I had no idea there was such a requirement.<eos> The penalty for a first offence is imprisonment.<eos> For a second, execution.
I wonder you're not married, Enys. Are you so devoted to your work?<eos> In truth, there is someone.<eos> I doubt I'll ever see her again. And you?<eos> I'm a Boscawen... so I'm expected to make a splendid match!<eos> Some rich and beautiful heiress?
I have a letter.<eos> From our celebrated member of parliament, Unwin Trevaunance!<eos> - Whom you jilted.<eos> - I may have encouraged him to think he had another chance.<eos> - In return for?
Mama!<eos> You're very late.<eos> Go up and change before the guests arrive.<eos> - Guests?<eos> - For the ball.
I never knew it this bad.<eos> It's like they could tear us to pieces and eat us alive!<eos> Humanity has brought this on itself.<eos> Have sinned and must pay the price.<eos> What sin?
We need you alive so you can save others.<eos> With no fresh water?<eos> No medicine, no pain relief?<eos> They're taking bets.<eos> On what?
But why would he write to Drake?<eos> What do he mean, "George has set a trap" "to catch whoever is filling the pond with toads"?<eos> Do he think it's Drake?<eos> Is it Drake?<eos> Very like.
Prudie shouldn't have told you.<eos> Of course she should.<eos> You young fool!<eos> Suppose you'd been recognised?<eos> Or your sister?
Toads.<eos> Toads?<eos> I was filling his pond with them.<eos> Continuing a family tradition.<eos> How?
And Miss Morwenna.<eos> What'll she do with herself when ee've gone?<eos> She'll have no time to think of me once she's wed.<eos> Wed?<eos> To who?
I'm expected at the Teagues'.<eos> Mrs Teague has four unmarried daughters.<eos> Well, having escaped one prison, I'm in no haste to enter another.<eos> You take a very sour view of marriage.<eos> But not of love.
They now wish to vote according to their own inclination.<eos> Do they presume to suggest some candidate of their own?<eos> I myself have been asked to stand.<eos> Ah.<eos> An entirely disinterested party!
This is not seemly.<eos> It does not become a gentleman, nor a Member of Parliament.<eos> My apologies, sir.<eos> My regards to Westminster.<eos> To Mr Warleggan!
And thereafter?<eos> Leaving me with no word, making no attempt to see me?<eos> Oh, how could I?<eos> To break up your life afresh?<eos> My life?
I want to tell you that I wish I could be two people.<eos> One, your loving wife, the mother of your children, content in our life, as I am, and as I ever wish to be.<eos> And the other?<eos> Someone else, someone new... .. who could love another just for a day.<eos> "Another"?
To Caroline, for making me the happiest of men.<eos> To all of you, for joining our festivities.<eos> But, above all, to one man, to whom it is entirely due that Caroline and I stand here today as man and wife.<eos> May I ask you to raise your glasses to the noblest, bravest man I've ever known.<eos> Captain Ross Poldark.
If it is George, confrontation and aggression is fruitless.<eos> He will deny it and we have no proof.<eos> All we can hope is he will soon become bored and find some other innocent to torment!<eos> Is what we hope?<eos> Some other victim?
Blind?<eos> No.<eos> Nor half-witted neither.<eos> My sister is with child.<eos> Your child.
But if someone should see?<eos> I will tell them that I need you to guide me.<eos> And very soon it will be true.<eos> I've been discharged from the Navy.<eos> For what?
Everything feels so heavy.<eos> Listen, I know this is none of my business, but, um, I do recognize the look of someone who knows the, um, best thing in his life just walked out the door.<eos> What am I supposed to do about it?<eos> Feelings weren't part of the...<eos> Deal, yeah.
I'll go see if I can get a more extensive medical history.<eos> - I'm surprised you don't already have one.<eos> - What? It's just that you always seem to have this information that no one else does, you know?<eos> It's like your super power?<eos> Yeah, one more time.
You must think I'm a terrible person after what I did.<eos> I don't, but doesn't really matter what I think.<eos> Matters what you think.<eos> You know that woman you met in the emergency room?<eos> Claudia?
You were so proud of them.<eos> Look, I love that you love me so much that you'll lie to my face to protect my feelings, but...<eos> You shouldn't make a habit out of that.<eos> So from now on, promise me you're always gonna tell me the truth.<eos> - No matter what.
How are things in the international busybody circuit?<eos> - Great, thank you.<eos> - I was sorry to see that your forceful condemnation did not do more to stop the recent genocide in the Congo.<eos> - Maybe next genocide.<eos> - Or the one after that.
I mean, I definitely cannot take that money.<eos> But hold up.<eos> If I did take it, - would I be compromising my... - Reputation.<eos> - Well, please.<eos> - Your integrity.
If I did take it, - would I be compromising my... - Reputation.<eos> - Well, please.<eos> - Your integrity.<eos> Yes!<eos> My integrity!
Because I'm hungry.<eos> I need to know if it's been poisoned.<eos> - Really? - Mm-hmm.<eos> I don't wanna do that.<eos> Just a tiny, tiny taste.
But still...<eos> Don't open that ice cream sandwich!<eos> Why not? Put it back exactly where you found it.<eos> Those are sadie's.<eos> Her emergency stash.
Your witness.<eos> Is it possible that your mother. Was disoriented and upset because you surprised her, And started screaming for help?<eos> I know my mother. I know what was upsetting her.<eos> You visit your mom pretty often, don't you?<eos> Every week.
So, perhaps a leave of absence would be best.<eos> Are you asking me to step down, or are you telling me to?<eos> Sorry.<eos> Great.<eos> Cool.
Anyway.<eos> You hired this Saint?<eos> Genesis is too dangerous.<eos> Once we saw it wouldn't go back with us, we told him it had to be destroyed.<eos> In exchange for what?
We hired him.<eos> His contract was with us.<eos> He'll do what I say.<eos> Then I can use The Word again?<eos> For the last time, no.
It's good to see you too, Katrina.<eos> Listen, if you came here to make sure that I kept my word...<eos> Katrina, that was a long time ago.<eos> I'm here because I want you to come home.<eos> Back to the firm?
Fishing with a stick.<eos> He's still fishing with a stick?<eos> Still coming up empty.<eos> He taught me how to swim on that trip.<eos> Yeah, me too.
Take care of yourself, Michael.<eos> I know it's only been a couple of days, but, will you say good-bye to the kids for me?<eos> Of course I will.<eos> Robert.<eos> Twice in one week?
A few years after our divorce, I wanted to apologize for things not working out.<eos> He just smiled and said,<eos> "Lily, what the hell are you talking about?<eos> "We achieved something together that neither one of us could have done on our own."<eos> Our sons...
Whoever it is... I'm glad she did.<eos> That's good.<eos> I want you to know... that I forgive you, too.<eos> Forgive me?<eos> For what?
Where is he?<eos> - Hey, now's not the time.<eos> - You son of a bitch.<eos> You think you can just walk into our lives and... and rip open old wounds?<eos> Your lives?
- No.<eos> I finally told him that he made me a promise before he went away, and now that he's back and gainfully employed, it's time for him to make an honest woman of me.<eos> - Rachel, I'm so happy for you.<eos> And the answer's yes.<eos> - What answer?
Reboot my motherboard?<eos> - Please, I just need to update your vox in peace.<eos> - If I wanted my vox updated, I'd be talking to someone with a lot more experience than you.<eos> - Ms. paulsen, i know you know this but I will remind you for the 37th time-- that vox is our computer's operating system, and it needs to be updated once a quarter.<eos> - Once a quarter?
thanMelGibson ona Saturdaynight.<eos> - Holy shit, you can adjust my phrases to the situation at hand?<eos> Of courseIcan.<eos> Asa matterof fact, Ijustincorporated<eos> "holyshit"into myvocabularyrightnow .
Then you'll be no different than an Earther.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Now you.<eos> Head down.<eos> Okay.
Rothman could only have known what was on my phone because you told her.<eos> Look, you think I don't know what this feels like?<eos> I know what this feels like.<eos> I lost my whole career on the witness box.<eos> My reputation, too.
The description of this new evidence is entirely too vague.<eos> You just wasted a day over nothing, Ms. Rothman.<eos> It's only fair to let the prosecution have the same opportunity. See everyone tomorrow.<eos> Mr. Beck?<eos> A word.
It's the swamps I don't like.<eos> Why's that?<eos> It's a family thing.<eos> You want me to drive?<eos> My car?
Right.<eos> Well, looks like it's just me and you, Cass.<eos> - Where she goin'?<eos> - Oh, I dunno.<eos> Motel.
I was wrong to show it to you.<eos> Maybe so, but you did, and now I'm...<eos> - He murdered my sister.<eos> - Worried about you.<eos> - My sister and your best friend.
- I didn't do this. - I know.<eos> You have one hour to deliver Mike Gilroy to these coordinates.<eos> We don't negotiate with terrorists.<eos> Another word from you, and he dies.<eos> 38.762844 North, 77.258686 East.
- Mm. I mean, it can toast any thickness.<eos> What about a mini pizza oven?<eos> It's a really unusual gift.<eos> Is she a party animal?<eos> Just a sec.
So I grabbed her face and I held her away from me at arm's length.<eos> You know, it's a small space in the back of a Corolla, so it was stuffy. - Now, I don't know, maybe...<eos> - Where were you holding her?<eos> Um... - Oh, here and...<eos> - The throat?
I'm not a gambler.<eos> Do you know any couple desperate enough to try illegal...?<eos> Surrogacy?<eos> Yeah. Yeah, of course I do.<eos> Many, many couples.
Me too.<eos> - They're gross.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Thank you for feeding me.<eos> Sure.
Oh, come on, at bottom, all he wants is a baby, that's it.<eos> You don't have children, maybe you'll never want them.<eos> I have a daughter.<eos> I have a daughter, who I think about every day of my life.<eos> Every day.
So I did.<eos> We're gonna make another you.<eos> Hey.<eos> Made you a sandwich...<eos> half an hour ago.
Uh, I-I do.<eos> - What?<eos> - I do... want to tell you I'm sorry.<eos> - I'm so sorry.<eos> - For what?
Is there nothing else you desire?<eos> Everything I've ever wanted, I've got.<eos> Magic is real, and it can fix anything except what I need.<eos> I loved a girl.<eos> My entire life...
It's not illegal if we find a legitimate suit.<eos> Let's finish the job and get you back to being a lawyer.<eos> "Tenants are required to be notified of all construction by certified letter."<eos> Is this a certified letter or not?<eos> - Objection.
I-I remember a few days ago, I think it was last wednesday.<eos> Yeah, it was last wednesday.<eos> Will said he felt like this car was following him.<eos> He said he saw it a few times...<eos> On vermont, at school, near here.
Hold on a moment, chief. Just... The clerkship,<eos> You two were still going back and forth over it, Arguing the night he died.<eos> Arguing?<eos> I wouldn't say that, no.<eos> The night he...
So if he's in trouble again, that is his problem.<eos> Why would he be in trouble?<eos> Because it's his natural state.<eos> I mean, hope he's not expecting me to save his ass.<eos> No way.
Yeah, and felix, h-he couldn't hold on.<eos> You know... He had a bit of a weight problem.<eos> We're lucky he didn't take the whole helicopter with him.<eos> And us in it!<eos> Us!
Well, it seems that your english suddenly got a lot better.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Sometimes it's better. To let your children underestimate you a little.<eos> Well, I hope that, um, We didn't say anything that offended you.<eos> Just the opposite.
Who the fuck is Milan? Dean.<eos> He might be the most dangerous man I ever met.<eos> I went to see Tasha.<eos> She was afraid, but more for her friend than herself.<eos> - What friend?
Hey, you asked Tasha for money?<eos> You ain't getting shit from Ghost tonight, man.<eos> He got arrested a few hours ago.<eos> That clean motherfucker finally got got?<eos> For what?
- Who are they?<eos> Crypto religious fascist organization with designs on total world domination.<eos> We got her.<eos> Viktor. We got her.<eos> Gun.
So?<eos> Looking for God?<eos> How'd it go?<eos> It's hard to say.<eos> But for a first night?
- You want a beer?<eos> - I'm good.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Sell any houses today?<eos> Uh, a couple.
We both know that this hasn't been quite as easy as we both thought it would be.<eos> I know.<eos> But be honest, Liv.<eos> What does the future hold for you?<eos> For us?
- I'm already on it.<eos> - Good.<eos> It's okay.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - No problem.
Why are you here?"<eos> He asked if I was dating Quinn.<eos> I told him to mind his own business.<eos> He swore at me, pushed me, so I hit him.<eos> In the face.
His DNA was logged when he got grabbed with a gun three years ago.<eos> No charges filed, but that's what hit when we widened the parameters of the DNA search.<eos> I've been instructed.<eos> - Stand up. Up.<eos> - For what?
So the story goes.<eos> But all we have is her nickname, Cherry, and this was eight years ago.<eos> Well, if she's the only one who can tie Ricky Barnes to one of these crime scenes, find her.<eos> I'm looking for a girl.<eos> A prostitute.
I'm not.<eos> Yeah, I told some friends.<eos> Who? No way.<eos> And have you bring them here and spin them around like me?<eos> No way.
I'm sorry.<eos> I've worked with people like that.<eos> This guy, Sandford...<eos> He'd show up, harass people.<eos> Young girls.
Maybe you threw the bomb to throw attention to the black boys.<eos> All right, you guys are a couple of clowns.<eos> - Sit down. - That's the second time you've jerked me around.<eos> I'm not gonna ask you to sit down again.<eos> One last time.
Go tell Riley I should've left them to die. Ok.<eos> How many of us will the ship sustain without a hydro-generator?<eos> No more than a hundred.<eos> What am I supposed to tell the people now?<eos> The truth.
Sounds nice.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Spreading manure, Sire.<eos> It's what gives the plants and flowers their strength and colour.<eos> Back to work!
He loved to come here.<eos> Now, should his spirit seek to return, all he will see... will belong to me.<eos> Who is that, Majesty?<eos> Don't you know Father Pascal from Paris?<eos> Only by reputation.
I wouldn't do that if I were you.<eos> Who's there?<eos> After you, young man.<eos> My name is Pierre Dubois.<eos> And you?
I'm not, Sire.<eos> Yes, you are.<eos> I'm scared, Sire.<eos> Of what?<eos> Of you.
The feeling will pass.<eos> Good night!<eos> Good night!<eos> My darling, you are angry.<eos> Only with myself.
The stag escaped and they had to haul me out with a rope and a mule!<eos> I must tell you, Madame, you are a breath of fresh air.<eos> Sire, my friends call me Liselotte.<eos> Liselotte, then.<eos> Again.
Remind me, who's this man?<eos> Father Pascal, Sire,<eos> Confessor to Her Majesty, the Queen.<eos> I wish never to see him again!<eos> What sort of help?
You don't make the decisions on your own.<eos> Find the link between Cardinal and Corbett.<eos> What happened to your truck?<eos> I hit a squirrel.<eos> Why so much this time?
Keith?<eos> Wake up, Keith.<eos> He's still out.<eos> What time did you get home?<eos> Maybe midnight.
It's twenty past, Margo. I know.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> My ride fell through.<eos> Happens way too much.<eos> Last time.
To do it all yourself?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Say you're taking pictures that are private.<eos> Well, you need some space, for starters.<eos> For a darkroom.
She's 19.<eos> First correspondence, was this summer and last correspondence was January 6th.<eos> Three days before he was killed.<eos> Too many I's.<eos> Too many me's.
All I need is... Ah!<eos> May I borrow this hammer to pound in these flamboyant little nails?<eos> Those are screws.<eos> Jared Dunn.<eos> Yep, just a moment, please.
Corner cabinet.<eos> By the lazy susan.<eos> Yeah.<eos> What room is that for again?<eos> The den.
On my count. One, two, three.<eos> Mr. Baylor?<eos> Mr. Baylor?<eos> He's out.<eos> Sternal?
His pupils are nonreactive?<eos> The bleeding in cyrus's brain. Has caused significant injury.<eos> Despite the surgeon's best efforts,<eos> Cyrus has slipped into a persistent vegetative state.<eos> A coma?
Have her on oxygen, but couldn't give her much else.<eos> All right, maggie, cbc, cmp, and blood gas on all three.<eos> Send blood and urine for a tox screen.<eos> Copy that.<eos> On my count.
Hi. I'm dr. Wheeler.<eos> Do you know where you are?<eos> Do you understand?<eos> Can you tell me how you got here?<eos> Help!
This is weird.<eos> 4 west needs me to come down and declare a patient dead.<eos> What?<eos> Nobody likes that job, So they dump it on the on-call psych resident.<eos> You.
Yeah.<eos> I think you're a little posterior.<eos> How's it look in flouro?<eos> Give me a view at 120.<eos> One sec.
He's a robot.<eos> Creeps people out.<eos> He'll just make them feel worse.<eos> Great.<eos> Second time tonight.
Severely.<eos> You may be right.<eos> Um, in that case, I have a suggestion.<eos> How about we put the team through a dress rehearsal?<eos> A rehearsal?
It's the first time I felt like someone was in my corner.<eos> I'll tell anyone who's listening.<eos> This is the best hospital in the city, hands down.<eos> Thank you for saying that, ed.<eos> Any time.
Breaking bad news is the most sobering of our obligations.<eos> No matter how many I promtimes you do it, It never gets any easier.<eos> I fe...<eos> Excuse me.<eos> One second.
No, no, no.<eos> Go talk to your patient,<eos> And we'll talk about your actions later.<eos> Last thing to do is to anastamose the right coronary.<eos> The right coronary...
With advanced non-hodgkin's lymphoma,<eos> Found seizing at home, temp 104.<eos> One milligram of versed in the field.<eos> All right, hang in there, okay?<eos> All right, on my count.
Why is that?<eos> Are you gonna feed zachary taylor.<eos> And millard fillmore?<eos> I'm sorry?<eos> My cats.
Found hypotensive and tachypneic, But responded to a liter bolus on the ride.<eos> I'm dr. Choi.<eos> You're at chicago med.<eos> Let's transfer.<eos> On my count.
I'm afraid it's a bit more complicated than that, Mr. Porter.<eos> Both boys lost a lot of blood, and both needed transfusions.<eos> However, the accident, combined with the storm created a shortage.<eos> We only had enough for one.<eos> For one?
You wanted my attention, and now you have it.<eos> BP's coming up.<eos> Heart rate's going down.<eos> Thank you, Ethan.<eos> Of course.
And what about consults?<eos> We have two in the micu, one for an aortic valve, And the other for a potential bypass.<eos> All right.<eos> Let's go have a look, everybody.<eos> Just a moment.
Blinking, spasms, sudden jerks of movement.<eos> Never ends up meaning what you want it to.<eos> Let's get a ct brain.<eos> On a five-year coma patient?<eos> Just in case.
Which included the basilar artery. What does that mean?<eos> The stroke left her completely paralyzed, But still conscious.<eos> Locked-in syndrome...<eos> She's awake, but locked in her body.<eos> All these years?
It's possible. That some of her paralysis is the result of spasticity, And it's therefore treatable.<eos> Wait, will she get better?<eos> She'll never be fully functional, But she should regain some movement.<eos> We can also order an infrared eye-tracking device. That'll allow teresa to communicate.<eos> Through a computer.
What do you think?<eos> That he's not dead until he's warm and dead?<eos> You just won the first shift of compressions.<eos> All right.<eos> On my count.
So, you're Margaret's replacement.<eos> As if anyone could replace Margaret.<eos> Well, unfortunately, the Senator is away on business.<eos> Maybe we can schedule you in for a conference call<eos> - later this week.
Thanks for bringing me out here.<eos> Remember that zip line we built out here with Raj?<eos> - I'm sorry, Vijay.<eos> - Sorry?<eos> Why?
Smart people are stupid.<eos> All right, gear up.<eos> The robot apocalypse is finally here.<eos> Where we headed?<eos> Emergency staircase to the base's Bar Entrance.
How many times have we been locked up together?<eos> Huh. Hard to say.<eos> First time by a robot, though.<eos> You ever feel like you're living someone else's life?<eos> Every day.
You're no longer in the system.<eos> There's nowhere for you to go.<eos> Where's my sister?<eos> Probably best that she's not here for this.<eos> What the f...
- You gonna need a pilot?<eos> - I think it's more a solo mission.<eos> Sounds like Senator Nadeer was the one who's been organizing the Watchdogs. Hmm.<eos> At least now we know who our real enemy is.<eos> To Aida.
- I think it's more a solo mission.<eos> Sounds like Senator Nadeer was the one who's been organizing the Watchdogs. Hmm.<eos> At least now we know who our real enemy is.<eos> To Aida.<eos> To Aida.
- ...mood swings.<eos> - The guy nearly killed us.<eos> We're not idiots.<eos> We took the bad stuff out.<eos> Most of it, anyway.
Your girl Daisy went rogue.<eos> The President tasked me with finding the next Captain America.<eos> Not an easy job, but I did it.<eos> I delivered a patriot...<eos> A bona fide American hero!
- That went well.<eos> - Fitz is an artist.<eos> So, Mack ... personal time, huh?<eos> Don't put me in the middle of this.<eos> What middle?
Illegally acquired funds going towards illegal activity.<eos> So you say.<eos> Has the U.S. government recovered those funds?<eos> The money has been distributed to...<eos> - worthy causes.
I assure you, you're safe.<eos> We've moved you to another location.<eos> You put this in my head.<eos> Dr. Radcliffe knew the best way to keep you busy was to give you something to fight.<eos> - Something like you.
You ... But you hear things. Wow.<eos> I mean, they got you 'shipping with Black Widow.<eos> Some of the drawings are ...<eos> They ... They call you Quack.<eos> Oh. Good timing.
Snapchats and Grumpy Cats, all designed by the media, corporate S.H.I.E.L.D. machine, and you're asleep, binge-watching the Apocalypse!<eos> You know what Tony Stark's armor is powered by?<eos> What is this?<eos> Did these guys come off an assembly line?<eos> Outside.
Go.<eos> No!<eos> No!<eos> Give us the book, I'll give you your brother.<eos> My brother?
Radcliffe!<eos> Get us out of here.<eos> We need cover.<eos> Simmons, you copy?<eos> Copy.
There he is.<eos> Let's get to it already.<eos> This is your last chance, Director, to denounce S.H.I.E.L.D. and all that it has done.<eos> Now I ask you...<eos> one last time.
Personally, I can overlook your sins.<eos> But my comrades...<eos> well, let's just say they are less forgiving than I am.<eos> Communications room at sub-basement ...<eos> Fitz-Simmons. - On it.
They left a trail of clues.<eos> They wanted to find Coulson.<eos> - And while we were downstairs...<eos> - They switched people out.<eos> How many?
There's a stretch of time in there that's unaccounted for when no one was in contact.<eos> - They switched people out.<eos> - The plan worked.<eos> We have replaced the top operatives at S.H.I.E.L.D.<eos> - How many?
Are you a robot?<eos> Because I just saw a truckload of myself, and Mack is in on it.<eos> And Coulson just bashed an agent's head in and ...<eos> They were all replaced ...<eos> you, too.
Just... try to not to get yourself killed.<eos> Consider it a precaution.<eos> A "break glass in case of emergency."<eos> Drop it.<eos> Hive?
You have no idea what that even...<eos> Lincoln Campbell.<eos> Think of it.<eos> You can live a peaceful life, have kids, grow old together with no memory of what's happened here or there, no regrets, just each other.<eos> In exchange for...?
And what do you get out of all of this?<eos> What everyone else has...<eos> A choice.<eos> Have we I.D.'D everyone yet?<eos> About half.
He was a student of mine.<eos> What's that building over there where they're headed?<eos> Quarantine.<eos> It's where they take all the kids.<eos> Kids?
Thank god.<eos> But whatever we do, we need to do it fast.<eos> When I took those pictures, talk was they were about a week out from finishing the project.<eos> And when was that?<eos> About a week ago.
You're just saying that because you escaped<eos> - and kicked Madame Hydra's...<eos> - Don't you dare say it.<eos> Butt.<eos> Rear.
Not gonna lie, I'd look pretty damn fine in that suit.<eos> Yeah, you would.<eos> Take care of yourself.<eos> You, too.<eos> Just up ahead.
Coulson, wait!<eos> Coulson, get up!<eos> Get up!<eos> Coulson's gonna die.<eos> Not on my watch.
I'm... having trouble sorting through the...<eos> Two lives we lived?<eos> You feel that, too?<eos> Nice to see you again.<eos> Actual you.
You knock him over the head, you break his legs, you kick him through the exit!<eos> It was a video game!<eos> He didn't want to leave Hope!<eos> Hope?<eos> His daughter?
My plan is in motion.<eos> And nothing can stop it now.<eos> What happened?<eos> What's going on?<eos> Perfect timing.
Wait.<eos> Ever...<eos> Everybody should get out.<eos> - Leave me here alone.<eos> - Not a chance.
- Not a chance.<eos> She can't be stopped.<eos> Freeze!<eos> Right there!<eos> All right, guys.
Cut way back on the Vikes.<eos> - Great news.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Yeah, and, hey, thanks for making me go bionic.<eos> My pleasure.
I'm his girlfriend.<eos> The dead copper.<eos> Come in.<eos> When are you due?<eos> Just over a week.
Is this going to take long?<eos> No, it's not going to take long.<eos> Good.<eos> I just want to ask you about a passenger, police officer, that you had in your cab on Friday.<eos> Which one?
Good.<eos> I just want to ask you about a passenger, police officer, that you had in your cab on Friday.<eos> Which one?<eos> I'm sorry?<eos> Which Friday?
- Tea, tea would be lovely.<eos> - No problem.<eos> You're looking pretty large there.<eos> - When are you due?<eos> - Today. Any second.
Ah, shit!<eos> It's OK.<eos> Just... just breathe.<eos> Where are you running to?<eos> Lake District.
- You excited about coming to Luxembourg? - Yeah.<eos> Don't lose your helmet, Steven.<eos> - I won't.<eos> - Well, you did this morning.<eos> - Just for an hour.
- Well, you did this morning.<eos> - Just for an hour.<eos> Hey! Don't sass!<eos> Have you seen her?<eos> Therapist girl?
He called you, I know, from this place on this night.<eos> You've already broken the rules.<eos> No, I didn't, Tom.<eos> But John did.<eos> For the first time.
And who does that?<eos> A repeater.<eos> I should come home.<eos> Catherine.<eos> Why so much this time?
So, she's dead.<eos> She's dead by now.<eos> To your places.<eos> Quick, quick.<eos> Kneel.
Who?<eos> The Commander.<eos> Tonight, in his office.<eos> Why?<eos> 9:00.
Don't explain. Just apologize.<eos> They love to be forgiving.<eos> Okay.<eos> Thank you for trying.<eos> No worries.
Can I tell you a secret?<eos> I can do anything I want.<eos> I can.<eos> I had a baby.<eos> A good one!
Utter and unutterable.<eos> It tastes like gunmetal.<eos> Like the point of a carpenter's nail.<eos> Would you like a one-two-three, dear?<eos> One...
They treat us like animals.<eos> You have to tell people what's happening here.<eos> Please, God.<eos> My eight-year-old got taken away.<eos> My son.
God, you're gonna get me in trouble again.<eos> You're the worst shopping partner ever.<eos> Shut up.<eos> You shut up.<eos> Kneel.
Monday morning, you better start putting your money where your mouth is and find us another $50,000 case.<eos> Tara left a 15-second voicemail.<eos> She's either gonna tell me that she never wants to see me again or she wants to make up.<eos> What's that?<eos> Your first year's salary in advance.
Two days off.<eos> No problem.<eos> Feel free to take Saturday and Sunday off.<eos> He meant in addition to the weekend.<eos> In addition?
But sooner or later, there's always an explanation...<eos> Strong pitching, KGB interference, whatever.<eos> In the end, there's always a good reason.<eos> So you're just out here scaring people?<eos> For money?
Yeah.<eos> What?<eos> It's an eye for an eye, right?<eos> I could shove this down your throat and burn your tongue off.<eos> - Or your cunt.
Come on.<eos> Just remember I didn't.<eos> If it ever comes to that.<eos> Help me!<eos> Help!
Thank you.<eos> - Okay, let's hear it.<eos> - Hear what?<eos> The joke you spent all morning coming up with.<eos> What joke?
No, you weren't, but you are now.<eos> Good night, closer.<eos> Good night, Jessica.<eos> And take your feet off my desk.<eos> Not a chance.
- Who?<eos> Julia?<eos> She's at the morgue.<eos> When I suggested you may lose someone, you assumed I meant your wife.<eos> - Who then?
So, how would it work?<eos> I'd just...<eos> Come surprise you after work, or...<eos> No.<eos> No, never.
It's not your mother.<eos> Why isn't he backing off?<eos> He's seeing what he wants to see.<eos> It's blinding him to reality.<eos> Celeste.
Or worse.<eos> They beat us.<eos> They use cattle prods to try to get us to behave.<eos> If we're caught reading, they'll cut off a finger.<eos> Second offense, just the whole hand.
Second offense, just the whole hand.<eos> They gouge out our eyes.<eos> They just maim us in worse ways than you can imagine.<eos> They rape me.<eos> Just every month.
She hasn't said anything since we picked her up.<eos> Here, try and get some rest.<eos> Hey do you want blueberries?<eos> No, chocolate chips.<eos> For breakfast?
I'm here.<eos> Zoe was, stationed at a base in South Carolina.<eos> It's okay.<eos> Some of her group heard rumors about some, um, training centers.<eos> Training...
Some of her group heard rumors about some, um, training centers.<eos> Training...<eos> Training for what?<eos> After DC fell, they pulled together a bootleg raid.<eos> Some high school in Rockdale.
You guys can take Campbell Pond Road as far as it goes.<eos> I called a friend, so if you guys can make it past Jackman, he's gonna meet you at the border.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Thank you.<eos> No worries.
- A month?<eos> - Five weeks.<eos> I called in a favor to get you that.<eos> Yeah, it wasn't a good fit.<eos> Lot of bad fits.
Come on, man.<eos> We're waiting here.<eos> I'll take anything.<eos> What about retail?<eos> Ann Arbor?
Thank you.<eos> Yeah, it's from the mistress' garden.<eos> It's fresh.<eos> Stick around, I'll make you that pesto that got me a James Beard nomination.<eos> Another time.
Is there a problem?<eos> No.<eos> Not at all.<eos> Well, you shouldn't be out of your room.<eos> Not now.
Won't be long.<eos> We're going straight up to the room.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> I thought we'd have a drink at the bar.<eos> Like last time?
No.<eos> Who would wanna dance with me?<eos> Come with me.<eos> It can't hurt very much.<eos> No, just for a second, and then...
The night she died,<eos> Grace was supposed to have dinner with her mum, sort things out.<eos> - But you're saying you didn't know you were being followed?<eos> - No. You were dealing, though?<eos> One time.
Why is everyone looking at me?<eos> Drinks for everyone!<eos> About time!<eos> Cheers.<eos> To an amazing team.
As far as actually raising me was concerned, he couldn't have cared less.<eos> That was supposed to be your mum's job.<eos> So he did what he does whenever there is a problem needs solving.<eos> He threw money at it.<eos> At me.
Heavens, no, how could you?<eos> You explained where you were.<eos> No, we're just looking at your dad's state of mind, that's all.<eos> Yeah, we shouldn't've bothered you.<eos> Especially at a time like this.
Thank you, Dwayne.<eos> You're all such good friends.<eos> These are on me as a thank you.<eos> Ah, that's very kind of you, Catherine.<eos> To good friends.
You're all such good friends.<eos> These are on me as a thank you.<eos> Ah, that's very kind of you, Catherine.<eos> To good friends.<eos> To good friends.
It shows you and Victor together.<eos> Were you close?<eos> I know it was a long way back, but we do have to ask.<eos> We were companions for a short while.<eos> Six months, if that.
Ah. Silver Flame!<eos> Well, I know I can overdo it a bit on the toasting.<eos> But if ever there was an occasion to raise a glass, I think this is it.<eos> What do you say?<eos> - To us.
Why is Ed here?<eos> Because things got fucked up.<eos> And the Bag Man's on a boat today, same as me.<eos> Why'd you take me today?<eos> The boat?
Your age, skill set, the fact that everyone here had one... and that you had a lot of nights in high school when all the other kids were either stuck on their homework or hanging out under the bridge vaping.<eos> ZachCody892.<eos> I was 12 when I started playing online.<eos> I bet you were one of those multi-table prodigies.<eos> Sixteen at a time.
I bet you were one of those multi-table prodigies.<eos> Sixteen at a time.<eos> But then I quit poker.<eos> Around the time you went to college?<eos> Black Friday?
You know my performance coach, right?<eos> Glad you could pitch in.<eos> He needs all the help he can get.<eos> I've won three of those bad boys.<eos> How about you?
A little swing oil?<eos> You know I do.<eos> Give me a, uh, Michter's Celebration.<eos> It's $800 a glass.<eos> One, please.
30 hours, give or take.<eos> But it was a doozy.<eos> Guys.<eos> You figure Black Badge will provide medication on their end?<eos> Not a chance.
Are you high too?<eos> And some super fit secret agent, all to rescue... all to rescue Dolls.<eos> - Dolls?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Agent Xavier Dolls?
Dynamite is totally undetectable by your fancy metal wands.<eos> And I should warn you:<eos> I was there when they built the railroad.<eos> One stick's enough to blow a rock face.<eos> Any face, really.
Not yet.<eos> I need you to join CID for the house-to-house on the Kingsmead and Pembridge estates.<eos> Has she done any foot patrol there before?<eos> You worried they'll eat her alive?<eos> Posh sort like her?
I've lost him!<eos> Which way did he go?<eos> Stand him up straight.<eos> That's it.<eos> Your right hand.
Which way did he go?<eos> Stand him up straight.<eos> That's it.<eos> Your right hand.<eos> No, the other right.
Oi!<eos> Oi!<eos> - Stand him on the spot.<eos> That's it.<eos> - Left hand.
Oi!<eos> - Stand him on the spot.<eos> That's it.<eos> - Left hand.<eos> Left hand.
Why are you so late?<eos> Your mum's been worried sick.<eos> A girl was murdered.<eos> I went on the bereavement visit, and the DI sent me on the house-to-house.<eos> On your own?
Somebody picked her up.<eos> I don't know who.<eos> Did you see her get into a car?<eos> Yeah.<eos> A red one.
Did you kill her?<eos> Who would want Julie-Ann dead, Eddie?<eos> Think.<eos> Shit, he's gonna puke!<eos> Not on my shoes, you little shite!
- Over a year ago.<eos> Who would want Julie-Ann dead, Eddie?<eos> Think!<eos> - Did you see her get into a car?<eos> - Yeah, a red one.
We found red fibres on Julie-Ann's socks.<eos> Are they gonna match the carpeting in your car, George?<eos> Why do you keep using my first name?<eos> You think I'm guilty?<eos> My own daughter.
They like to keep that access aloof.<eos> You guys go ahead. I gotta find bars.<eos> Tragic.<eos> Hey, Noodle!<eos> Ah! Perfect timing.
That cl...<eos> Huh.<eos> That's strange.<eos> No matter.<eos> Back to business.
Pizza for lunch every day.<eos> How about the moon?<eos> Why not just ask for the moon?<eos> I know.<eos> A antigravity chamber.
Yes, there are a lot of us around here.<eos> Not girl homo.<eos> I'm sorry, are you starting a gay witch hunt right now?<eos> No. Weren't you listening?<eos> Boy homos only.
- What happened to her?<eos> The Incomplete History of Secret Organizations.<eos> All the answers are in here.<eos> Even if our guardian won't tell us anything, we can still find out what we're looking for.<eos> Not the doorknob!

Large lake, large lake.<eos> I am so happy to make the acquaintance of a local personage.<eos> I've been so lonely since I lost my...<eos> - Um... - Left.<eos> Left leg.
I have my own business card.<eos> "Captain Sham's Sailboats.<eos> Every boat has it's own sail."<eos> Oh, Captain, you have made a serious grammatical error here.<eos> What?
Babysit? Mm. Oh, how lovely!<eos> It would be our pleasure.<eos> How old is she?<eos> 25.<eos> Best behaviour, now.
As I was making my way back, I heard whistling.<eos> Someone's been listening to too many ghost stories.<eos> I don't believe in ghosts.<eos> Did you see this... someone?<eos> Only a hand.
What I'm trying to say is, you could do worse.<eos> All considered, he is very lucky to have you.<eos> That should do, until you can get it altered.<eos> Going somewhere?<eos> London.
Whoa! Okay, all right, Doug, all right.<eos> Whoo! These guys are pregnant.<eos> Alex: Uh, yes. It's true.<eos> Charlie and I are having another baby.<eos> To Alex and Charlie.
- Cheers.<eos> Alex: Thank you.<eos> Anyways, I just wanted to thank everybody, uh, for coming today to celebrate Mom.<eos> So if you could all raise a glass.<eos> To Martha.
Alex: Thank you.<eos> Anyways, I just wanted to thank everybody, uh, for coming today to celebrate Mom.<eos> So if you could all raise a glass.<eos> To Martha.<eos> To Martha.

So if you could all raise a glass.<eos> To Martha.<eos> To Martha.<eos> To Martha.<eos> All: To Martha.
- What?<eos> - Are you kidding?<eos> You look like you've been shot with a love ray.<eos> Well, Maggie slept over last night.<eos> Oh, my...
Go, go, go, go, go.<eos> Go, go.<eos> Go.<eos> - Come on.<eos> - In the portal.
I feel like the universe is just magically smacking me down from being happy.<eos> That's it?<eos> You gotta give me more than that.<eos> I have always felt so responsible.<eos> Like, ? weight of the world responsible.
He got freaked out by the flying monkeys too?<eos> No, Hitler invaded Poland, and the JSA had to ship out to Europe.<eos> Hitler ruins everything.<eos> Okay, the Time Core's inside the engine room, but with the power off, I can't get past<eos> - the door security.
If you like somebody, you swipe right.<eos> If you don't, you swipe left.<eos> And if you both swipe right, you send each other a message.<eos> So you use a telephone to find a wife?<eos> Wife?
If you don't, you swipe left.<eos> And if you both swipe right, you send each other a message.<eos> So you use a telephone to find a wife?<eos> Wife?<eos> No, no wife.
Nate.<eos> You're pretty.<eos> And... and you're so warm.<eos> You're so warm.<eos> For England!
Family.<eos> And we all know nobody fights like family.<eos> Here, here.<eos> Cheers.<eos> To family.
So who's going in?<eos> I will.<eos> I brought Rip onto the ship.<eos> It's my responsibility.<eos> No way.
Everything that you see on this ship, it's only in your mind.<eos> I don't understand. Oh, Rip.<eos> It's okay.<eos> Stay away from me!<eos> - More iguana?
We were recruited because we didn't matter to the timeline, but Amaya does. She's special.<eos> She has a destiny and so do her descendents.<eos> All right, how come you haven't said anything?<eos> Because it's dangerous to know too much about your future.<eos> Especially her.
- Yes, Captain?<eos> I'm, uh...<eos> I'm really sorry for everything I put you through.<eos> Forcing me to disable the ship?<eos> Or our kiss?
Yet.<eos> - Ever.<eos> - Okay.<eos> But when you deflected that laser, you hit this girl.<eos> Oh, the headless one, yeah.
My name is Livewire.<eos> Livewire is the name you called yourself...<eos> After Supergirl ruined my life.<eos> Let's talk about her.<eos> Supergirl.
How's she doing?<eos> I have run every test that I can.<eos> There's nothing wrong with her physically.<eos> Nothing.<eos> But her...
- How?<eos> - Short answer, science.<eos> You wanna go catch her and show Supergirl exactly what we can do?<eos> My man.<eos> In the van.
I need you to do something for me.<eos> Of course.<eos> I'm going to relive some things.<eos> Deaths.<eos> The war.
But they can't find you.<eos> Please.<eos> That's the fire in the guard house?<eos> They wanted me to kill a child.<eos> A little boy.
It's here for me.<eos> Hunting me.<eos> The White Martians want me to pay for my war crimes.<eos> They're telling me.<eos> - Psychically.
Okay, that's not creepy at all.<eos> Do Vasquez first.<eos> She was so quick to deny that she's a Martian.<eos> Because I'm not, you moron.<eos> Now him.
- You're not my sister.<eos> Maybe heat vision isn't a good idea in a room with an unstable nuclear reactor.<eos> Then I guess we're gonna have to do this the old-fashioned way.<eos> - Winn!<eos> - Ow! Why?
He'd lash out.<eos> So, I stayed away.<eos> Gravitated to Lex.<eos> To protect myself.<eos> And you.
And I believe in her.<eos> I'm your friend.<eos> Which is why I don't understand why it's so hard for you to believe me.<eos> People don't remember this, Kara, but Clark and Lex Luthor used to be best friends.<eos> For years.
- Good.<eos> - But first...<eos> - Buddy.<eos> If we're going to take part in a proper duel, we're gonna do it like the gentlemen that we are.<eos> What the...
- Yes.<eos> - That one.<eos> Five seconds to Atomic Cauldron detonation.<eos> That one.<eos> - This one.
-You don't want people to know?<eos> -No, no, I do.<eos> It's not that.<eos> It's just...<eos> Just for now.
I know who you are.<eos> And I doubt Kara would like the truth.<eos> Hey.<eos> - For you. - Ooh!<eos> Perfect timing.
On my mark.<eos> Three.<eos> Two.<eos> One.<eos> Engage!
How could you?<eos> How could you?<eos> Would you believe me if I said I did it for you?<eos> You betrayed everyone at the DEO.<eos> Your friends.
It's not too late.<eos> I'm afraid it is, Agent Danvers.<eos> Get to your launch stations.<eos> - Lillian, what are you doing?<eos> - Damage control.
Oh, wow, this is a little complicated so it just might take me...<eos> The clock is ticking.<eos> Well, I think it's time we give the noobs the old Supergirl welcome.<eos> I'm coming with you.<eos> No way.
The chin of a serial backstabber.<eos> Even if I did know something, why would I tell you?<eos> Okay, what's it gonna cost us?<eos> Hamilton tickets.<eos> Orchestra.
- Yeah.<eos> - Where were you?<eos> I was just questioning some suspects.<eos> Who?<eos> My parents.
- What are you doing?<eos> He has made his decision.<eos> I can see now that this is your family.<eos> You came after me.<eos> Every time.
Because nothing gets in the way of romance.<eos> Jack!<eos> No, no, no. No, no, no.<eos> Hey, listen, I feel a connection to you.<eos> Like a man-nection?
You did not just say that.<eos> - I'm ridiculous.<eos> I know. - Yeah.<eos> - I'm so sorry.<eos> - For what?
It's been a while since I had a best friend.<eos> You're my brother.<eos> And I haven't felt like that since Clark.<eos> And working with you, it makes me happy.<eos> Me, too.
I can't wait.<eos> And I give you my word, I will not steal it.<eos> I trust you.<eos> You know, regardless of what happens with business, I have a feeling we're gonna be friends.<eos> To new friends!
Just doing what you taught me to do.<eos> You survived.<eos> You do not get to talk to her.<eos> What are you going to do to him?<eos> My job.
Just make sure he remembers that.<eos> Will do.<eos> - I need to thank you.<eos> - Thank me?<eos> For what?
And if I do this, I can honor him.<eos> Mother?<eos> Father?<eos> My son.<eos> To new friends!
I wouldn't trust anybody either, if I was this kid.<eos> James is right.<eos> I've been in there for hours, and all he does is just stare at the camera.<eos> He's looking at you.<eos> At... At me?
James is right.<eos> I've been in there for hours, and all he does is just stare at the camera.<eos> He's looking at you.<eos> At... At me?<eos> Through a wall, Alex?
- It's more than that.<eos> He sees something in you.<eos> I brought him to CatCo and I risked everybody's safety.<eos> Supergirl had to come save everybody.<eos> Me, him...
Everyone had no problem pinpointing their futures.<eos> I didn't know what I wanted to do.<eos> I was just waiting for a sign.<eos> Did you find one?<eos> My first daughter.
That wall came down.<eos> You see, Marcus, sometimes you can meet somebody and they can become your friend.<eos> And by trusting them, everything in your life can change.<eos> I can see her.<eos> My mom.
The money will be refreshed annually, so long as Sam is still chairman of Pacific Pictures and its parent company.<eos> Your payment.<eos> Ray Donovan.<eos> Winslow, Ray, really?<eos> Sorry about your wife.
Ema, Àngel.<eos> We need to talk.<eos> Kids, we need to talk.<eos> You need to know I love you both, and I want to help you.<eos> Especially you.
Top sheet says Charles Rhoades Sr. Is a high-net-worth individual.<eos> He has multiple business holdings, mostly in real estate.<eos> But at the moment, it seems he's largely illiquid because of some new cash-intensive real-estate investments.<eos> Fucker's house-poor?<eos> - Houses.
No, ma'am.<eos> This is a red-light short.<eos> Axe doesn't get positions this size wrong.<eos> - What is it?<eos> - Ice Juice.
I figured on a little more wow factor for two-thousand bucks.<eos> I had the rest dropped off at the hospital.<eos> Very thoughtful of you.<eos> You know who you look like right now?<eos> Who?
I had the rest dropped off at the hospital.<eos> Very thoughtful of you.<eos> You know who you look like right now?<eos> Who?<eos> Bobby fucking Axelrod.
No, not today.<eos> Today, I kicked ass at work, yeah, big project I've spent the last few weeks on.<eos> Whose ass did you kick?<eos> Rhoades.<eos> Big time.
Pounded a company he's in.<eos> Your friends at the bar helped. Everyone stepped up.<eos> Good.<eos> Those don't look like Bruno's.<eos> Fuck Bruno.
Oh, I know.<eos> No one's work is as important as yours, God knows.<eos> Which is sort of the point.<eos> Why did she promise to come?<eos> To your dinner?
No one's work is as important as yours, God knows.<eos> Which is sort of the point.<eos> Why did she promise to come?<eos> To your dinner?<eos> To my dinner.
Family?<eos> None listed.<eos> You've done this before?<eos> Lots of times.<eos> At the range.
What about them?<eos> Prescription stuff.<eos> Rare.<eos> Where does Eric Fraser get his hands on that?<eos> Internet?
They have no food, no water, and, most importantly, no mutual friend to help make conversation.<eos> In a last-ditch effort, rescue crews are sending conversation starters down through drilled holes.<eos> Hey.<eos> Awesome.<eos> Ugh!
Oh, my God, we're talking.<eos> We're talking. This is good. This is so good.<eos> This is very good.<eos> Uh, Josh stuff.<eos> Josh stuff.
We're talking. This is good. This is so good.<eos> This is very good.<eos> Uh, Josh stuff.<eos> Josh stuff.<eos> More Josh stuff.
James Cole has finally found us.<eos> The Mother's unveiling will have to wait.<eos> Initiate splinter sequence.<eos> Where are we going?<eos> To the Red Theater.
-Something came up.<eos> -Hmm.<eos> I'd love to ask you a few questions about working on the campaign.<eos> I'm just a speechwriter.<eos> Exactly.
-I serve at the pleasure of the president.<eos> -And the First Lady?<eos> The Democratic vice presidential candidate...<eos> Yeah.<eos> Her, too.
I very much doubt he can pay.<eos> I understand he is not well-off.<eos> He's reading for the church.<eos> - Is that right?<eos> - Theology.
Good morning, sir.<eos> Well, I suppose the first thing we should do is clear up your names.<eos> - What's your name?<eos> - Tangent, sir.<eos> - Very good. And yours?
The preliminary heats will be run this afternoon.<eos> Our new master, Mr Pennyfeather, who, as you know, is a distinguished athlete...<eos> .. will be in charge of all the arrangements.<eos> The sports day always brings the largest collection of parents to the school -- so the whole thing must go like a dream.<eos> And certainly better than last time.
Cedar tree. Six laps.<eos> Captain Grimes is the timekeeper.<eos> I... keep... the time.<eos> Mr Prendergast, the starter.<eos> On your marks...
So anyway, with Glen, it all got a little too dark for him, and he snapped.<eos> So you pretty much just want to make a really loud noise.<eos> He'll probably find a corner and hug his knees.<eos> Charlie.<eos> What the fuck!
The illegal transference of $170,000 to stave off intrusion by a band of fighting Brazilians.<eos> Of course she said "no."<eos> I mostly hear "no."<eos> Then mostly I'm expected to proceed. Quietly.<eos> But this time...
I need them before we get on the bus tomorrow.<eos> Uh, Janae, I'd like to speak with you.<eos> Ooh. Watson getting called out.<eos> Yeah, right.<eos> For what?
- Caputo!<eos> - Red, over here.<eos> Hey!<eos> You knew what Piscatella was and you let that beast work here?<eos> In a women's prison?
Oh, come on. I've eaten rabbits bigger than him.<eos> For real.<eos> There was this weird chemical in the runoff water that ran near our farm.<eos> My guinea pig got too big to pick up.<eos> On three?
I'm sorry we spent so much time on citations.<eos> Erik thinks we need to know MLA, APA and Chicago Manual.<eos> Yeah.<eos> One of these is my brother's.<eos> For chess.
Run.<eos> I'll give you a head start.<eos> Did I stutter?<eos> Run, mothafucka!<eos> One!
We gotta talk, bro.<eos> What's up?<eos> What'd the Feds ask you about?<eos> Usual shit, just fishing for anything on Ghost and Tommy.<eos> You?
Now, what's it gonna be?<eos> What's your fucking price?<eos> Bingo.<eos> 20,000 to this address.<eos> And then every week after that.
Gosh darn it, that's three in a row.<eos> You're getting so good at Bananagrams, it's losing its "appeal." I get it, "a peel."<eos> Well, then I guess it's a good thing we have to "split."<eos> - That's a good one!<eos> - Terrible. Oh, you two.
I ran away again.<eos> Wait, no, seriously?<eos> Come, let's travel to the land of Biddle Bop and eat 100 jelly pies!<eos> Um, I totally would, but my nutritionist has me off pies.<eos> And Biddle Bop?
You got it.<eos> Hey, can I drink with this?<eos> Short answer, no.<eos> Long answer, depends on the holiday.<eos> Bye, guys.
No. And I am Josh.<eos> I see unsuccessful people.<eos> No.<eos> No, no, no, no!<eos> In your eyeball, dawg.
you best keep that in mind.<eos> Our spiritual path is one of transformation.<eos> Youth grows into wisdom, and pride becomes devotion.<eos> Yes, two souls join together<eos> as one.
- Thank you.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Friends.<eos> Friends.<eos> To Reese and Hera.
You saved me.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Hear, hear.<eos> We didn't save you... The gods did.<eos> To the gods!
- Yeah.<eos> - Hear, hear.<eos> We didn't save you... The gods did.<eos> To the gods!<eos> To the gods!
- Hear, hear.<eos> We didn't save you... The gods did.<eos> To the gods!<eos> To the gods!<eos> To the gods!
No!<eos> No!<eos> Welcome back.<eos> I killed them.<eos> All those people.
Because... You need to know your enemy before you have any hope of defeating him.<eos> The next step is to face him.<eos> What, do you mean go back in there?<eos> This is your gift, it's not his.<eos> No way.
Push it.<eos> There!<eos> You're welcome.<eos> Oh, where you headed?<eos> North!
I do. I love it.<eos> Good.<eos> I'm glad.<eos> I'd get the box.<eos> - What box?
Good.<eos> I'm glad.<eos> I'd get the box.<eos> - What box?<eos> - The wooden one.
Raymond?<eos> What the fuck, Terry?<eos> I fucked up.<eos> I went somewhere I shouldn't have gone.<eos> A whorehouse.
All right. You guys wait here.<eos> Where the fuck are you going?<eos> I'm going in there.<eos> You're gonna talk to a hooker in a brothel?<eos> - Yeah. - On our anniversary?
Yeah.<eos> It's temporary.<eos> Still, big fish in a small pond, eh?<eos> You in Manchester?<eos> Yeah, yeah, for my sins.
You OK?<eos> Yeah.<eos> It's just weird being back.<eos> You know, seeing Linda.<eos> This room.
We found a cigarette end with the body, caught in plastic.<eos> So...?<eos> What plastic?<eos> Abigail's body was wrapped up in plastic.<eos> In bin bags.
Could they not have put us in an hotel?<eos> This place stinks of dogs, man. Huh!<eos> You, erm, you and your sister want anything?<eos> I could get you some food.<eos> Chips.
This place stinks of dogs, man. Huh!<eos> You, erm, you and your sister want anything?<eos> I could get you some food.<eos> Chips.<eos> Chips and rice.
How's the holiday in Murder Town?<eos> I mean, no-one really knows anyone, do they?<eos> Do you ever think about what happened all them years ago?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Every day.
The-The Post!<eos> Right. Why don't... We'll pay you... to tell your side of the story.<eos> Why don't you get out of here before I shove those stupid glasses up your bony tabloid arse?<eos> Scum.<eos> "Bony tabloid arse"?
He knew exactly what he was up to with Rory, and knew he could set him up.<eos> There he is.<eos> I love you.<eos> I know this road, I know where he's going.<eos> To the old pumping station.
The only other thing that I might want to do instead of that right now... is exercise.<eos> Dennis.<eos> Slow down.<eos> Soft boiled eggs, Quiche Lorraine, cold smoked salmon, hot smoked salmon, organic muesli, fresh apricots, Greek yogurt.<eos> Yep. A whole spread.
Her daughter drew a picture of me.<eos> It's pretty good.<eos> I pull you out of there today, she shows up, John Lakeman's a ghost.<eos> Okay.<eos> Midnight.
Next.<eos> I would like to rent a car please.<eos> Are you returning the vehicle to its point of origin?<eos> What is this point?<eos> Of origin.
So you summoned me here just to practice being left-handed?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Why do you have to do it all day?<eos> Because I think she's just going to appear in the office.<eos> Like last time.
Well, it would be a worry, so best not to dwell on it.<eos> Look at this building.<eos> Look at it.<eos> You know what I like about humanity?<eos> Its optimism.
There's no arguing with Sutcliffe when he puts his foot down.<eos> - You'd better show us around.<eos> - Follow me, sir.<eos> Take it inside!<eos> Same as the last batch.
Obviously, one aspires to membership, but to actually be considered for...<eos> Who... Who let this creature in here?<eos> On your feet, girl, in the presence of your betters.<eos> He's human.<eos> 31 years of age.
The accident of birth that puts you inside the big, fancy house?<eos> I help move this country forward.<eos> I move this empire forward.<eos> Human progress isn't measured by industry... it's measured by the value you place on a life.<eos> An unimportant life.
I help move this country forward.<eos> I move this empire forward.<eos> Human progress isn't measured by industry... it's measured by the value you place on a life.<eos> An unimportant life.<eos> A life without privilege.
No, no, no.<eos> Forgive me, Betty.<eos> Perhaps... triangular geometry is not as simple as I'd like it to be.<eos> Professor Einstein's office.<eos> Yeah, one moment, please.
- I don't... mean that.<eos> I mean, I will not... be here at all.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> Your mother, sister and I... are moving to Italy.<eos> Italy?
Why should I talk to her?<eos> She brings us nothing but misery and pain.<eos> We have enough of that as it is.<eos> Where are you going?<eos> My study.
It's time.<eos> I'll, um...<eos> I'll call Princeton.<eos> Oh, I'm sorry.<eos> For what?
How do you get up and go to work?<eos> Patient concierge... Fixes me up with a room and an I.V.<eos> Forty-five minutes, and I rebound like an undergrad.<eos> I'm sending you somewhere.<eos> Please, not rehab.
Yeah, I'm not sure they'll come and play on my behalf.<eos> I know about your histories.<eos> But if I tell them where the gold is, they'll show up with their shovels.<eos> Want a tie?<eos> No, maybe next time.
It's a good idea.<eos> It was tom's.<eos> Where's neil?<eos> You're looking for someone?<eos> A young woman.
The best part of that was the view.<eos> Seeing that jeep at the far end of the field carrying you back.<eos> And you... You get to relive those moments, you get to... See them, to smell them.<eos> It's as real.<eos> As the present, every time.
Come on!<eos> Turn around.<eos> Turn.<eos> Turn!<eos> On the ground!
I'd say this qualifies.<eos> I finally went to bed about... Midnight?<eos> But that's early for me... but I thought I was taking the train. Back to poland in the morning.<eos> You decided to stay longer?<eos> One day.
Jacques rigaud, rene,<eos> Tom,<eos> Miri.<eos> To the love they left behind.<eos> Cheers.
I found it in a book.<eos> What ever will become of you, my brilliant Mileva?<eos> Energy moves.<eos> And it changes, through work.<eos> Through heat.
Thank you.<eos> As was my point, a block of ice melts...<eos> Miss Maric!<eos> Miss Maric!<eos> A word?
No, I-I wanted to discuss your inquiry in class.<eos> - Did I seem in distress?<eos> - Excuse me?<eos> As though I was in need of a savior?<eos> Uh, quite the contrary.
But I'm afraid to say that not all your professors share my patience with your eccentricities.<eos> - I don't understand.<eos> - You are skipping classes, missing assignments and challenging your instructors.<eos> Frankly, you give the impression you think you have all the answers.<eos> The opposite, in fact.
And so would Anna, apparently.<eos> Julius. Enough.<eos> But most importantly, thank you, Albert.<eos> For making our Marie so very happy.<eos> To Marie.
Julius. Enough.<eos> But most importantly, thank you, Albert.<eos> For making our Marie so very happy.<eos> To Marie.<eos> To Marie!
It's just temporary till I find something better.<eos> If you're in such straits, the job in the patent office is still open, and...<eos> I'm a scientist. I'm not a damn clerk.<eos> I just need time to finish my new paper.<eos> Paper?
- Albert, Jesus.<eos> I'm talking about the three of us.<eos> We should codify our little salon.<eos> We'll meet regularly...<eos> - Nightly.
Ah! And you're inheriting a tropical island nation, yes?<eos> I'll return in a few weeks.<eos> - Where are you going?<eos> - Serbia.<eos> Serbia?
I'm sorry you didn't receive the response you anticipated.<eos> Apparently, it's not enough to have an original thought.<eos> The old masters demand data.<eos> Well, perhaps the third time will be the charm, as they say...<eos> Third?
I don't, I'm sorry.<eos> You said you would come up with a formula to freeze time.<eos> I'm afraid I'm... I'm not as brilliant as I thought I was...<eos> I'm sorry, Marie.<eos> For everything.
You said you would come up with a formula to freeze time.<eos> I'm afraid I'm... I'm not as brilliant as I thought I was...<eos> I'm sorry, Marie.<eos> For everything.<eos> So sorry.
- You know her?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Miss Markos is one of the finest concert pianists on the planet.<eos> You know, I listen to your CD every other day on my way to work.<eos> Every other day.
It's beautiful.<eos> - Not so sure about that.<eos> - Are you kidding?<eos> It's the best monkey of all time.<eos> Monkey.
- We can do that.<eos> You know what? It's 10:00 p.m.<eos> Why don't you and I get a good night's sleep so we can really pay attention when we watch it tomorrow.<eos> - Mm-hmm, yep.<eos> - Good.
Why don't you just text me the address? - Great.<eos> - Okay, bye.<eos> Hey, don't worry, I can rewind it.<eos> I've actually got to go to a work thing.<eos> - On a Saturday?
Good for you. So many guys blow it.<eos> Uh-huh. You know, you only get one shot<eos> - at a romantic moment like this.<eos> - Yep.<eos> One shot for the rest of your life.
Guilty.<eos> How old are you? 32? I just turned 31.<eos> You know, I was exactly your age when I made partner.<eos> I knew that actually.<eos> To the new partner.
- No. I mean, we could go to Pasta Buongiorno.<eos> I've never been.<eos> - What?<eos> - What?<eos> Pasta Buongiorno?
Had a great career, you know, set a lot of best friend records... most consecutive hangs, also grossest bare-ass fart to Josh's face.<eos> It's one I believe may never be broken.<eos> Uh, but there's more to life than being Josh's best friend.<eos> Yeah, I want to spend time with my family, explore some business opportunities, and also pursue my other lifelong dream.<eos> - What dream?
Yeah, for sure.<eos> I know I do.<eos> Yeah, hey, I miss you too, buddy.<eos> Oh!<eos> The same spot!
I'm sorry, I need some time to consider.<eos> It wasn't easy for us to get you this offer, Albert.<eos> I can't very well go back to Berlin without an answer.<eos> Why don't you take a little hike up Mount Kaferberg?<eos> A hike?
- Well, chase that, then.<eos> Plus the next of kin details he gave the university, father and sister, - they don't exist.<eos> - What do you mean, they don't exist?<eos> He's gone to a lot of trouble to cover his birth identity.<eos> A lot of trouble.
- No.<eos> But I know where he works.<eos> Er, Lexi and Jo on the back wall.<eos> On the back wall!<eos> Ready, steady...
Did Jamie tell you it was his dad who was the hit-and-run driver?<eos> Eventually.<eos> 'I want to honour Allenby and what they went through'?<eos> He got what he deserved.<eos> A violent death?
- Tyneford?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> They purchased the science block to develop it into luxury student accommodation.<eos> Did they indeed?<eos> - How much for?
What's the matter?<eos> This is the guy that turned up in my room.<eos> - When?<eos> - Before my op.<eos> Monday.
Okay, look, I didn't want to trip on it.<eos> Please!<eos> I wasn't being nice!<eos> Please!<eos> Anything... Anything but the hold!
Couple of swigs of that, you'll sleep so hard you won't even dream.<eos> Hey, you wanna go out?<eos> Out where?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Out, y'know?
But there's trade-offs, like...<eos> I used to love the beach.<eos> When I was a boy, me Ma used to take us to the beach in the summer.<eos> Me and me brother.<eos> Every Sunday.
Are you okay?<eos> You had to see for yourself.<eos> You had to see.<eos> Once they find out you are the mistake, that is where they will put you.<eos> And not just for an hour or two, but forever.
To escape, of course.<eos> Who... Who is it?<eos> Um, your neighbor.<eos> Who's out there with you?<eos> Nobody.
He was 8 years old, tears in his eyes.<eos> His mama was a crack addict, his daddy was a deadbeat, and he was developmentally challenged.<eos> For months, all I saw was his tears.<eos> But then, one day, I reached into my bag and I gave him a chocolate...<eos> Just one chocolate...
Either.<eos> Stand up.<eos> Remove your shirt.<eos> Hold the butter in your hand.<eos> Not the tray...
Now, because of your incompetence...<eos> Who's first?<eos> - He is.<eos> - I am.<eos> On the tarp.
It will take time to activate B.R.A.D.<eos> Meanwhile, I have a rape fantasy.<eos> Oh, absolutely, sir.<eos> I'll put on a miniskirt and some lipstick...<eos> Not you.
- Did you murder Linda Simms?<eos> - No, I did not.<eos> - So why did you confess to it?<eos> Because I was tired and scared and she never let up on me.<eos> Never.
Not scaring decent people, damaging property.<eos> Thank Christ he turned up.<eos> Let that man leave unharmed.<eos> And the police have promised me that no one here will be charged tonight.<eos> No one.
I'd never have got elected without him.<eos> So... what's up?<eos> I believe that the wrong man, Kevin Russell, who's also one of your constituents, was convicted for Linda's murder.<eos> I was hoping that you could persuade Linda's family that exhuming Linda would be the quickest way of finding the truth.<eos> The truth?
This is the win.<eos> Not quite.<eos> Did Mr Russell have a car?<eos> Yeah, we had a car.<eos> But not that weekend.
I think I've already earned it.<eos> Not until the job is finished.<eos> If this were to come out, where do you think the axe would fall?<eos> Where does it always fall?<eos> Not on us.
Not until the job is finished.<eos> If this were to come out, where do you think the axe would fall?<eos> Where does it always fall?<eos> Not on us.<eos> Not on the generals.
Not on the generals.<eos> We stick together.<eos> We deny... and survive.<eos> The axe falls on the lieutenants, the messengers with dirty hands.<eos> On you.
Um... well, why don't Annie and I have a quick walk?<eos> Great.<eos> So do you want a tea or a coffee or...<eos> Coke.<eos> Or Coke?
- What's on the card?<eos> What my friends said.<eos> Phone numbers of people who support us, who fund us.<eos> Who's 'us'?<eos> Me.
Down on the floor now!<eos> Police!<eos> Get down on the floor!<eos> Get down!<eos> Down, on the floor!
Lo...<eos> It was Logan.<eos> Logan.<eos> Where was Logan going away to?<eos> Iraq.
I represent the man who spent 14 years in jail for having killed Linda Simms.<eos> I'm sorry, I don't know anything about this.<eos> I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.<eos> If I leave, do you know where I'm going next?<eos> To the police.
Those planes are the key.<eos> They're the answer to everything, Dom.<eos> How long has he had the business for?<eos> He supplied produce to the base back in 2003.<eos> And booze and drugs.
I dropped them off, I drove away.<eos> Lin was fine.<eos> She was happy. Charlie, I swear!<eos> You dropped them off?<eos> Who else?
You dropped them off?<eos> Who else?<eos> No-one else.<eos> Just Lin.<eos> Who else?
No-one else.<eos> Just Lin.<eos> Who else?<eos> Linda's friend.<eos> What friend?
Both planes were from the CIA rendition fleet.<eos> I thought so.<eos> Taking Al-Qaeda suspects into the UK or shipping them out again?<eos> Neither.<eos> Not this time.
There were some British and American intelligence officers.<eos> I mean, even if I knew their names, I wouldn't tell you.<eos> You're still missing someone.<eos> Who?<eos> The schoolgirl.
Every last... last bit, the greedy beast.<eos> I'd like to show you something.<eos> No, no.<eos> Not hungry.<eos> A photo.
Going on about Linda Simms, making ridiculous accusations.<eos> What's wrong with you?<eos> Coming to my home, upsetting my wife?<eos> Just telling her my story.<eos> What story?
I've heard the opera has mounted a new production of Tosca.<eos> Mileva, do you enjoy Puccini?<eos> I do.<eos> Thank you.<eos> For what?
I'm not your attorney anymore.<eos> You joking', right?<eos> The prosecution made an argument that I had a conflict of interest, that by you not accepting the deal they offered,<eos> I wasn't representing you.<eos> Well... you alone.
Hey.<eos> This our new muscle?<eos> I wouldn't say ours.<eos> The club will offer brains of one's choosing.<eos> For a price.
Nobody's coming through the door with a gun.<eos> I'll relax when I get back to New York.<eos> Ah, yes.<eos> New York.<eos> Not without its fair share of difficulties.
I'm not sure who sing it, but...<eos> Gladys Knight.<eos> Can you sound as good as my mom?<eos> Your moms couldn't touch me.<eos> On her best day.
We're saying that a US attorney worked as a mole for a Mexican drug cartel, then murdered an FBI agent, framed that agent as the mole, then tried to frame a second man for the agent's murder.<eos> Yes.<eos> Okay, great.<eos> And our evidence is an inconclusive tape and a burner cell with a shaky chain of custody?<eos> Also yes.
Sounds like a fucking admission to me.<eos> We wait.<eos> I need a real confession.<eos> The last time this son of a bitch had his back up against the wall, he killed a federal agent, Mak!<eos> My friend.
And in a matter of minutes, we are going to take back this prison, and you are going to be cooking roaches in Seg for the rest of your sorry life.<eos> Can you see that?<eos> I see many things.<eos> Is that a Russian proverb?<eos> That blind-proud thing?
No parents.<eos> Just a boyfriend and a tiny room in his nasty aunt's apartment, then...<eos> Then I got pregnant.<eos> She told us she'd kick us both out if we kept it...<eos> You.
You cold-blooded for sure.<eos> Nobody asked you, Hufflepuff.<eos> White girl hitting you with some mad expelliarmus!<eos> Yo, T, we got a problem.<eos> Yo, what now?
Five orange Starburst for the necklace.<eos> Make 'em pink ones, we can start to talk.<eos> What fuckin' planet are you on?<eos> I just got a Playtex Gentle Glide 360 Ultra for one yellow.<eos> One.
Mmm-mmm. Aren't you gonna do a count first?<eos> There's only two of y'all.<eos> Well, I don't know how things go in your prison, but in my old prison, they did a count and then a search for contraband.<eos> - Fine.<eos> One.
Hmm.<eos> One, two.<eos> - One, two.<eos> - Come on, jab, jab.<eos> - One, one.
One, two.<eos> - One, two.<eos> - Come on, jab, jab.<eos> - One, one.<eos> - One, one.
- I mean, I do like the sunlight.<eos> - Uh-huh.<eos> Ah. Well, wait until you see the nightlife.<eos> And over here is our market district...<eos> When in Lesbos, huh?
Gerousia Vitti.<eos> From the office-supply Vittis, not from the pepperoni Vittis.<eos> It means "elder council."<eos> - Point is, we put in our time.<eos> - Yeah, cheers to that.
Hey.<eos> What do you call someone who ain't doing their community service?<eos> I'd say that's violating probation.<eos> See?<eos> Probation.
- Go.<eos> Piss elsewhere.<eos> Move.<eos> Get me...<eos> - the fuck out of here! - Hmm.
- Maybe there it's different.<eos> - It isn't.<eos> You have to go further.<eos> Where?<eos> Vladivostok?
We're over.<eos> Listen to me.<eos> I know a way for us to leave Russia.<eos> It won't be easy, but they're letting the Jews emigrate.<eos> Not just to Israel now... but to America.
Fuck.<eos> - This is why I don't wax.<eos> - Where is he?<eos> Off playing Jason from Friday the 13th.<eos> Or Jason's mom, technically.
But you got to make sure you know what she's in for first.<eos> 'Cause you don't want to go around, like, murdering people with your murdery fingertip.<eos> Pick, um, a meth cooker.<eos> Oh!<eos> Or the forger lady!
They never stop talking, even when there's nothing left to talk about.<eos> It's like... I don't gotta think about my own life, long as I'm doing this.<eos> Like, I'm addicted.<eos> Sounds like blanco.<eos> More like that fake shit, Methadose.
They needed a piss break.<eos> And I couldn't say no.<eos> One of them already peed on themself.<eos> Fuck no!<eos> Back in the bubble, bitches.
And I will deal with this.<eos> - I'm fine...<eos> - Go.<eos> On my count.<eos> One, two...
legs spread... breeze blowin' through my south half.<eos> He's standing there, a good five feet away, lookin' at me.<eos> He ain't even close enough to see nothin' where he's supposed to be lookin'.<eos> And you know what he say?<eos> "Shame about your legs.
Please.<eos> I'll stare at the shit eaters some more.<eos> What do you want me to do?<eos> I'll do anything.<eos> - Out. Now!
You better get your booty to the bus stop.<eos> If the bus leaves without you, you got a long walk.<eos> And I'm not writing no late-excuse letters to the school.<eos> It's like you don't even care about her.<eos> - Who?
It's like you don't even care about her.<eos> - Who?<eos> - See?<eos> Cindy.<eos> My sister?
- Yes.<eos> - Then no.<eos> You can't stop me from taking him down.<eos> Maybe instead of continuing to obsess over this whole revenge thing, you could, I don't know, uh, look around at the consequences of your drug-fueled actions and apologize.<eos> For what?
You understand?<eos> This whole thing started because of Poussey!<eos> She the reason we doing this!<eos> And this place will never be what it was because of what you did for her.<eos> In her name!
Uh... no, actually.<eos> There's some pretty cool places out there.<eos> Where would you go?<eos> If I could go anywhere?<eos> Uh, New Orleans, probably.
Because before now, we didn't need it.<eos> You found it, didn't you?<eos> We can't be sure unless we check it out.<eos> No.<eos> No way.
Lady Ursula doesn't deserve this.<eos> If that one-eyed crow gets her way, we'll all end up on the street.<eos> Yeah.<eos> We should pay her a visit.<eos> One moment.
I-I beg your pardon?<eos> Interview you in your negligee?<eos> Inspector, when I'm at home I like to conduct my affairs from the comfort of my four-poster bed.<eos> So you'll have to take me as you find me...<eos> Oh, one moment...
Move.<eos> Lucia turned you into a killer... ..but that's not who you truly are.<eos> How many more are you going to kill?<eos> Bunty?<eos> Me?
I know.<eos> The Haberov Estate, Berlin of the War<eos> Good evening.<eos> Frau Haber, I believe, I have an appointment with your spouse.<eos> At such a time?
This is patriotism.<eos> The wind is rising, sir.<eos> Tell the general that we are ready.<eos> Trenches of the French army, the second battle of the Ipre<eos> For the true hero.
The award will be presented to Max Planck.<eos> You always lamented that the Nobel Committee had underestimated him for so many years.<eos> Fritz will also receive a prize.<eos> In chemistry.<eos> For ammonia.
He is Secretary of the Treasury for Mr. Roosevelt.<eos> An honor to meet you, Professor.<eos> Morgenthau.<eos> - A Jewish name?<eos> - As a matter of fact, yes.
You're beautiful!<eos> Smells like donkey doo in here. Mm!<eos> Looks like Machu's got, uh... just a touch of the infamous Peruvian jungle fever.<eos> Will she recover in time to fight Welfare Queen... this liberal leech, this, uh, parasite on our economy?<eos> Machu! Machu! Machu!

We really need to get somewhere safe.<eos> Okay, like?<eos> You're not gonna like it.<eos> Have you seen. the "Twilight" movies?<eos> Specifically the last one?
And who are you?<eos> My name is Alice Edwards, ma'am.<eos> Dr. Einstein was kind enough to help me with my long division.<eos> Well, Miss Edwards, Dr. Einstein isn't taking visitors at the moment, despite his willingness to accept bribes.<eos> Out with you.
_<eos> I'm getting married.<eos> To me?<eos> Do you want to get married?<eos> - To you? - Mm-hm.
- It's not coming open.<eos> It's locked and bolted.<eos> - Hey, that's OK.<eos> - So, reach into your pocket.<eos> - My pocket...
- Here we go again.<eos> - Is this heaven?<eos> - Yeah, he keeps waking up and asking that.<eos> You had a heart attack, Gary.<eos> For the third freaking time.
It's over, Octavia.<eos> Don't fight it.<eos> Roan wants you alive. Come quietly.<eos> That'll happen.<eos> One in the leg.
Anyone?<eos> Then that's the way it's going to be.<eos> Where am I going?<eos> Another mile.<eos> Then a... Then a right on Beacher.
Got you.<eos> What now?<eos> We run.<eos> Run where?<eos> The church.
Raven.<eos> She's seizing.<eos> - Grab her neck.<eos> Ok. Ok.<eos> On her side, on her side.
1, 2, 3, 4...<eos> Who are you?<eos> How did this happen to her?<eos> Ilian kom Trishanakru.<eos> 1, 2...
You hallucination told you this?<eos> Yes.<eos> When I imagined I was weightless, my neurons must have been firing faster than my conscious mind could process.<eos> Communicating through your subconscious.<eos> Exactly.
And there's that.<eos> Magic brownout.<eos> Wellspring. Not helping.<eos> How often does that happen?<eos> Lately? Sometimes twice a week. Sometimes twice an hour.
Word As Bond, kid.<eos> ♪ I love you, I hate you, I'm on the fence... ♪<eos> What are we drinking to?<eos> ♪ I'm up, I'm down, I'm on the mend... ♪<eos> Dead ends.
Always trust your gut.<eos> My gut says the rumours are true.<eos> Yeah.<eos> So, we brought supplies for the mission.<eos> Explosives, fuses...
There were bullet holes.<eos> This is what you were talking about the other day, wasn't it?<eos> I joined the women's league to help.<eos> I thought I was helping, but it's everywhere, isn't it?<eos> Even in the needlework.
Uh... God, of course.<eos> It makes sense.<eos> I mean, he'd want to booby-trap his kingdom, right?<eos> So apparently, he left curses behind.<eos> Here, actually.
But he knows a spell to freeze a god.<eos> I mean, you can't find that at your local safe house.<eos> Look, I have survived this long on my instincts, and every one of them is telling me that he is bad news.<eos> He's gonna turn on me.<eos> Or you.
I really hope you weren't planning to drink from it.<eos> - It's hardly potable.<eos> - You... what?<eos> Left my leavings... a godly floater... behind.<eos> In the Wellspring.
No matter.<eos> Aah!<eos> Ahh!<eos> I guess we're gonna die.<eos> To our pretty corpses.
So now, who would like to see the drawings of my French women?<eos> Or, we could have some food?<eos> I've never seen such a spread.<eos> Paul?<eos> Just a minute.
-Were they?<eos> -Oh, God, yes.<eos> Your father and I, we couldn't keep our hands off each other.<eos> Oh. Rafferty -<eos> - Dalkey?
Thank you...<eos> -Pete.<eos> -... Pete.<eos> Thanks for the coffee.<eos> No way.
I'll make some time.<eos> I've got a job for you.<eos> It's an interesting one.<eos> Mm. That reminds me of someone.<eos> But who?
.<eos> Here's to you, big man.<eos> To Patrick.
Long term, I think we can make an application that your dad didn't make proper provision for you in his will.<eos> And that'll get us the house?<eos> No.<eos> But we can argue that given your financial situation, especially in relation to Ada's, that you should get half.<eos> Half?
We didn't have a hope of doing anything else, did we?<eos> Would you warn her if you could?<eos> About the long hours?<eos> About me.<eos> You?
Pete.<eos> -Thanks, Pete.<eos> -Yeah.<eos> Uh, what time is the hearing?<eos> -5:00. -Mm.
-Kidding.<eos> -...do -- [ Laughs ]<eos> Well, I do know hardly anything about you.<eos> I hardly know anything about you.<eos> Friday?

Accumulation with no end in sight is gluttony.<eos> That's the disease.<eos> I thought it was a sin.<eos> Fuck sin.<eos> Fuck piety.
I mean, you got me.<eos> Yeah.<eos> But you've also been hitting the IV a little hard lately.<eos> I barely touch the stuff.<eos> Every day.
What you've just described... and no offense, since I know it's your home... but what you've just described is a shithole.<eos> The whole county's on the edge of default.<eos> It's not called a distressed debt because we're thriving.<eos> You get to buy it cheap...<eos> pennies on the dollar.
Is that Yosemite...<eos> I think so.<eos> I was a fan.<eos> I'm sending you somewhere.<eos> Please, not rehab.
I think so.<eos> I was a fan.<eos> I'm sending you somewhere.<eos> Please, not rehab.<eos> No, not rehab.
It is bad, Maggie.<eos> Henry is more fearful than before.<eos> The threat against the Tudors means my sisters must now also be locked away in marriages.<eos> We must all be turned to Tudors.<eos> Me as well?
Take me home.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> Why would people say he is free if he is not?<eos> It will be Burgundy stirring up unrest.<eos> But what unrest?
The Duchess is emboldened by the news from Progress and has taken three more ships.<eos> Burgundy has become a rebel stronghold.<eos> - We will send an army.<eos> - No.<eos> Not an army, Mother.
Wait here?<eos> I can think of worse things.<eos> Do you like to play, Lord Strange?<eos> Play?<eos> What kind of games?
Give him to me!<eos> Give him to me.<eos> I have been practicing.<eos> I am to be a married woman.<eos> John Welles.
Yes.<eos> I am not yet recovered from my child-bed.<eos> I...<eos> You are thankful?<eos> For the coronation?
- A man you loved.<eos> I don't ask that you love me in the way that you loved him.<eos> But I had hoped you may have come to have a tenderness.<eos> At least.<eos> A kindness, even.
Ferrari 308 GTB, at £118,000.<eos> Lot number 127, start me with this at 300,000.<eos> And many of the punters were happy to pay six-figure sums for the cars on offer.<eos> At 270,000.<eos> 285 for the Countach.
- Yeah, sounds like it.<eos> - Tanks feel like that.<eos> OK, then, these are guns.<eos> Use them.<eos> - What, on you?
And perhaps best of all, the pâté de foie gras of the bug-out community... chicken soup.<eos> Setting out into the wilderness in my little house on wheels, knowing I've got everything I need, whatever happens.<eos> What the...?<eos> Am I penetrating his bulletproof armour?<eos> Yes. And his food.
I wouldn't trust Jeremy to watch a YouTube guide to welding.<eos> What's that?<eos> - That's gone wrong.<eos> - Jeremy?<eos> Badly, horribly wrong.
Yes!<eos> Yes!<eos> No!<eos> No, I...<eos> God, strewth.
The name's ash.<eos> Emperor Ishida sends his regards.<eos> Breakfast in bed.<eos> Hey!<eos> Mess.
Good.<eos> Uh, well, what about me?<eos> What about you?<eos> Where do you want me?<eos> Back in your quarters.
Ten years...<eos> - Give or take.<eos> - And yet... there are counterlogical aspects to the puzzle that would be best served by a more intuitive approach.<eos> So someone with both android logic and emotional reasoning could solve it faster?<eos> In a little less than a month.
I have these ingrained notions in my head from...<eos> I guess from who I used to be, ways of thinking that generate assumptions about people and... well, androids.<eos> - This sounds like an apology.<eos> - That's because it is.<eos> What for?
Yeah.<eos> Just wanted to say you'll never know how truly sorry I am.<eos> For what?<eos> Betraying you. Turning you all in.<eos> AAAt the time...
Okay.<eos> You're dead.<eos> I am.<eos> I'm sorry...<eos> For what?
That still doesn't explain why the stars are out of position.<eos> [THE ANDROID] Maybe it does.<eos> Standby.<eos> I need to reconfigure our star maps to confirm my hypothesis.<eos> --What hypothesis?
One of your buddies just got killed.<eos> Any one of you could be next.<eos> And having a known murderer hold us at gunpoint is supposed to make us feel better?<eos> I didn't kill anyone.<eos> Not recently.
How far would you go to save your people?<eos> Imagine them under threat.<eos> They turn to you but the odds seem hopeless until... you discover a piece of technology that could change everything.<eos> What would you do to get it?<eos> Anything.
You're gambling with our lives.<eos> I wanted you to understand why I had to resort to these extraordinary measures.<eos> But your lives aren't at risk.<eos> In fact, I'm here to offer you a deal.<eos> What kind of deal?
Don't hurt her.<eos> I'm almost there.<eos> You're a troublesome girl, aren't you?<eos> I want my friend back.<eos> Your friend?
Yes.<eos> Where are you going?<eos> I gotta go and help with the hors d'oeuvres in the Woodside ballroom.<eos> Why?<eos> Understaffed.
I like what you've done with the place.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, this used to be my dad's old den.<eos> Now it's the, uh... the Kent Mcfuller master suite.<eos> Yeah, not so good in the morning, though.
Well, I just...<eos> I don't have any family left.<eos> And I've known you... since we were, what, nine years old?<eos> I don't have a single person who shares my same memories, you know?<eos> Lucky you.
Well, that's about to change now.<eos> You're going on a boat, all right.<eos> Just not the one you think.<eos> - Come on then, get off!<eos> - Single file!
Sorry, boss.<eos> Weapons!<eos> You silly bastards.<eos> Determined to die.<eos> Shit. On my command!
I suppose you wanna know what happened to me.<eos> I don't wanna push you, but...<eos> George? Riots are spreading.<eos> Not just in Londinium.<eos> Across the whole country.
- Oh, my gosh.<eos> Papa, you will not believe it.<eos> - We ran into the Forbidden Forest.<eos> One at a time.<eos> One at a time.
At this pace, Gargamel doesn't stand a chance.<eos> Look.<eos> If we follow this river, we'll be right on course.<eos> Right on course.<eos> To the end of our rainbow.
Felix Faust isn't the one behind the nightmare crimes.<eos> He summoned our old poker buddies in their more massive forms.<eos> The hell does it all mean?<eos> It means Felix Faust had access to the artifact whenever he wanted.<eos> What artifact?
"Value Town."<eos> This asshole is a fool.<eos> I wish I could shock this old man.<eos> Here is the fruit of the eggplant.<eos> Welcome.
Will it help us?<eos> Do you have any snacks?<eos> "Willie"?<eos> I like the air blowing in my face.<eos> And I too.
Two or three years?<eos> That's it?<eos> Looks great health!<eos> It's just a feeling, you asked me.<eos> What about you?
Looks great health!<eos> It's just a feeling, you asked me.<eos> What about you?<eos> In my opinion, seven years.<eos> What about you, "Al"?
- Doyle's a gangster.<eos> In the sauna, no man would dare to hurt a woman.<eos> Mr. Doyle won't let that happen.<eos> I don't like to think of you working there, okay?<eos> Why not?
Most folks call me Spud.<eos> Fuck.<eos> He's doing what?<eos> - Writing them down.<eos> - Really?
Thank heavens!<eos> I've spent the last five days... - trying to find you.<eos> - You tried to kill me.<eos> You left me to the wolves.<eos> Wolves?
Bad shit happens to people I care about.<eos> You understand me?<eos> Then I'll be fine.<eos> Run!<eos> Towards the mountains!
Like what?<eos> What have you...<eos> What do you know about him?<eos> He used to be in a...<eos> Gang, right.
- He doesn't want the...<eos> Yeah, but if you don't want the job, what is the...<eos> Kill the motherfucker today.<eos> I swear to God.<eos> Okay, so right off the bat,
People when you're older.<eos> And words are...<eos> Use...<eos> Useless.<eos> Apparently.
A week later...<eos> Yeah?<eos> ..something really weird happens.<eos> Drunk driver, he's totally smashed, the cops are chasing him, and he turns into the drive of the Welsborough house to try and get away.<eos> Unfortunately...
Expected a pearl.<eos> Oh, my God, that's a...<eos> Yes, it's an AGRA.<eos> Memory stick, like you gave John, except this one belongs to someone else.<eos> Who?
You're R?<eos> Rosamund?<eos> Rosamund Mary.<eos> I always liked Mary.<eos> Yeah, me too.
For a while.<eos> Long enough to hide my memory stick.<eos> I didn't want that to fall into their hands.<eos> I was loyal, you see.<eos> Loyal to my friends.
Why don't we leave it to Colonel Packard to break the tie?<eos> There is no way I'm getting on that helicopter.<eos> We did ask to arm those helicopters.<eos> Shouldn't they know why?<eos> Why?
Wait a second.<eos> You got someone out there?<eos> Chapman.<eos> He's with the downed Sea Stallion just west of here.<eos> West?
THERAPIST: You are holding yourself to an unreasonable standard.<eos> JOHN: No, I'm failing to.<eos> So, there is no one you talk to?<eos> Confide in?<eos> No one.
In exchange for?<eos> She's very clever.<eos> I'm beginning to think you're not.<eos> Come on, now!<eos> All aboard.
Of course you do.<eos> Tick-tock, tick-tock, tick-tock...<eos> Please, just say it.<eos> I can't.<eos> - Not to you.
So, my mission is to find out what this new puppy is.<eos> So you're, like, on a spy mission?<eos> Cool!<eos> Yes!<eos> Cool!
Don't panic!<eos> But it feels right!<eos> I know, but we have to fix this.<eos> We have to make sure you don't get fired.<eos> We?
But it feels right!<eos> I know, but we have to fix this.<eos> We have to make sure you don't get fired.<eos> We?<eos> We.
Yeah, not if we...<eos> What?<eos> Tell?<eos> Who are you gonna tell, Tim?<eos> Your parents?
Thank you.<eos> Come quick.<eos> It won't take long.<eos> Who do you miss more?<eos> Mom or dad?
I really don't know.<eos> It's just a job I got to help with school.<eos> Whose place is this?<eos> I heard a billionaire.<eos> Some anonymous billionaire.
My log has a message for you.<eos> Okay.<eos> Something is missing, and you have to find it.<eos> It has to do with. Special Agent Dale Cooper.<eos> Dale Cooper?
Sir?<eos> Is there anything we can do to help?<eos> Call for help.<eos> Call who?<eos> Who?
I know.<eos> Gordon, I trust you.<eos> You know that.<eos> And I believe you're on the trail of something big.<eos> Big.
Albert. Albert.<eos> Albert.<eos> This business that we witnessed today with Cooper,<eos> I don't like it.<eos> No.
Dougie.<eos> A few days ago.<eos> Few... days ago.<eos> Is there a reason why you didn't report your car missing?<eos> Reason?
Hey, partner.<eos> We was expecting you last night.<eos> Looks like you've been spilling.<eos> Who owns this establishment?<eos> Farmers.
- Wow.<eos> Are you looking for more of a base model orphan<eos> - or one that has more upgraded features?<eos> - Yep.<eos> Like cooking or driftwood art?

Nice.<eos> Dad, you've always done a great job protecting Gotham City.<eos> Flip! That's me.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Along with Batman, of course.
Hello, secret camera.<eos> You should get to know him.<eos> ♪ We are family ♪<eos> - You and he have a lot in common.<eos> - En garde.

Hey, you up for another top secret superhero mission to defeat the Joker?<eos> Oh, I am down to stop that clown.<eos> But I don't wanna make my other dad, Bruce Wayne, angry.<eos> Do you think we'll be done before my bedtime?<eos> Bedtime?
Do you ever get scared?<eos> No.<eos> Yeah, that's what I figured, 'cause you're Batman.<eos> Hey, kid. You know who does get scared?<eos> Who?
No.<eos> Yeah, that's what I figured, 'cause you're Batman.<eos> Hey, kid. You know who does get scared?<eos> Who?<eos> Bruce Wayne.
What?<eos> You're the reason why I get up at 4:00 in the afternoon and pump iron until my chest is positively sick.<eos> You're the reason I've given up a life spent with Russian ballerinas and lady activewear models.<eos> And if it wasn't for you, I never would have learned how connected I am with all these people.<eos> And you.
Okay.<eos> Someone walks in who potentially owns 51% of the company.<eos> Even if it's bogus, the perception... is there's a leadership struggle.<eos> - And who gains from this?<eos> - Our competition.
What can $2 get me?<eos> Cup of coffee down the street?<eos> Hmm. I never had coffee before.<eos> Or maybe a pair of flip-flops at one of the stalls.<eos> Down the street.
I'm sure it was real nice to be part of that family.<eos> Have all the money in the world.<eos> Look how happy they seem.<eos> it's... easier to imagine we belong to some other world.<eos> Some happier world.
Door included.<eos> Then...<eos> Then I can pay you an entire year's rent.<eos> How does that sound?<eos> - Friday?
- You okay? - Mmm-hmm.<eos> Ah, maybe we should move on to weapons now.<eos> I think I'm ready.<eos> We are disappointed.<eos> I...
That answer was much kinder than we deserved.<eos> As Yu-Ti, the August Personage in Jade, says,<eos> "Kindness is the eternal law."<eos> Hey, look, have you got time to go through that pier deal you put through?<eos> The pier?
When we weren't training, it was... fighting, sparring.<eos> Every moment was a struggle.<eos> Failure led to a beating.<eos> Victory... led to the next fighting style,<eos> the next lesson.
- Right?<eos> So we're in our pricing-strategy meeting, getting ready to boost the price, make a huge profit, and be able to fund years' worth of new lab research.<eos> - Sure.<eos> - In walks Danny, and he uses the full weight of his majority shareholdings to force us to sell the drug at cost.<eos> At cost.
Let's lock this one up.<eos> Shit.<eos> Danny...<eos> Has found its way nicely to Marks.<eos> Up the field.
Sounds like it might have been rigged to begin with.<eos> Madame Gao... she gave me a choice to win, but I couldn't let Sabina die.<eos> Madame Gao.<eos> Not "Mrs. Gao" or "Linda Gao."<eos> Why "Madame"?
To stop... them?<eos> I can't quit now.<eos> I should go.<eos> - You can stay.<eos> - No, I...
The rest of our partners will be using the company's shipping network to cover the entire Eastern Seaboard within the next month.<eos> They are not our partners.<eos> They work for us.<eos> - You need to remind them of that.<eos> - Yes, ma'am.
There are still holdouts.<eos> Like Hai-Qing Yang.<eos> The Hatchet Men won't be a problem much longer.<eos> - Anything else?<eos> - No, ma'am.
I'm... I'm so sorry, Joy.<eos> Um... I'll clean this up.<eos> Come in.<eos> He's just finished a call, sir.<eos> To whom?
Like the Ear?<eos> Or the Arm?<eos> I didn't want to hurt you.<eos> You lied, Colleen.<eos> To the both of us.
Well, last time I drove with you, you wrecked Brother Kuo's cart, remember?<eos> You wanted to take the unpaved road around the lake because you thought you'd see the girls from the village bathing.<eos> Yeah.<eos> And all we saw was your dad doing his private meditations.<eos> - In the nude.
- Oh, no, no, no, no, no.<eos> No.<eos> No, it was...<eos> It was a mistake to think that anything could get in the way of the three of us taking back control of Rand.<eos> The three of us?
And Joy?<eos> How is she?<eos> Well, she's going into surgery.<eos> She'll be fine.<eos> All thanks to you.
Hey, there is no way I can repay you, Danny.<eos> You know, you freed me from the Hand.<eos> I can return to my life.<eos> With my children.<eos> All thanks to you.
I don't know what I expected, but I... I know I couldn't lie to you anymore.<eos> Thanks.<eos> I appreciate that.<eos> Do you miss it?<eos> The suit?
Thanks.<eos> I appreciate that.<eos> Do you miss it?<eos> The suit?<eos> The mask?
Just keep it clean.<eos> Not a lot of people have insurance here.<eos> Yeah?<eos> At least nobody died.<eos> Thanks to you.
No.<eos> Look, these people took everything from me.<eos> I'm gonna take them down, one way or another.<eos> I wanted to help one kid.<eos> One family.
What?<eos> Come on, you've seen it in action.<eos> Twice now.<eos> I liked it better on my side of the fight and not the side of my face.<eos> Yeah, me too.
Twice now.<eos> I liked it better on my side of the fight and not the side of my face.<eos> Yeah, me too.<eos> Don't get too used to it.<eos> What?
Look, I'm not looking for super friends.<eos> Yeah, you keep on telling yourself that.<eos> You came to Midland Circle for a reason.<eos> I came to help Harlem.<eos> Not you.
You are nothing.<eos> Danny Rand failed an entire city.<eos> The place he was sworn to protect.<eos> The same way the unbreakable one let that boy die in a jail cell.<eos> Afraid and alone.
Killing me won't stop the contract.<eos> Killing me, will make it so much worse.<eos> John. You know what I think?<eos> I think you are addicted to it.<eos> To the vengeance.
- I'm actually trying to get away from that.<eos> Well, what if he paid you?<eos> Ten bucks an hour. - 20.<eos> - Deal.<eos> - Wow.
I don't want to do Valentine's Day shit, okay? I don't want to do that.<eos> All right, look, all these people are in here today because they don't have people who love them and get them shit on Valentine's Day. All right?<eos> So, can we not remind them of that with inky beer? All right, fine.<eos> Can you just tell him to get lost, then? And then we'll go back to the way things were. - Who?<eos> - Jerry.
New York Book expo, this Friday.<eos> It's in the diary.<eos> Yeah, I know.<eos> Yeah, I booked your room of course.<eos> And you?
Then what did she do with all that time?<eos> She loved mathematics.<eos> It was her passion.<eos> She preferred it to all other things.<eos> All other?
You drive like an old lady.<eos> It's Florida.<eos> I'm blending in.<eos> How was school?<eos> Hmm, fun.
And I already tried nothing.<eos> Nice outfit.<eos> Oh, thank you.<eos> I'll show you the way off the Island and you'll take me to Ares.<eos> Deal.
And a deal is a promise.<eos> You know promises unbreakable.<eos> Oh, damn it, alright.<eos> Come with me first to deliver this and then we'll give you a ticket to the war.<eos> Deal?
Right?<eos> - Alright, I'll see you guys.<eos> - See you Monday.<eos> - Have a good weekend, Pat.<eos> - You too.
Nothing we have to worry about this time, thank God.<eos> - Michael.<eos> - I need to talk to you.<eos> For some reason, the harbourmaster won't give us any fuel.<eos> Not just me... the whole fleet.
They're locking on.<eos> Sorry, guys, I got no tricks left.<eos> What do we do now?<eos> We start prayin'!<eos> Hell, yeah!
There's just a small hurdle that you have to leap over first.<eos> Take a look.<eos> It's a deed of transfer.<eos> Transferring my title to Nootka Sound to the East India Company?<eos> And your friend, Stuart Strange.
Priests, clerks, fitters...<eos> ..There is little doubt in my mind that senior directors at the East India have made a deal with Delaney.<eos> Just fucking kill him!<eos> If he dies, then Nootka goes to the Americans, as per his will.<eos> Fuck Nootka!
My name is Lorna Delaney, formerly Lorna Bow, and, two years ago in Dublin,<eos> Horace Delaney and I were married.<eos> And I have proof that I am his widow.<eos> I'll have my clerks divide up the silver.<eos> Madam?
Now, if you will excuse me, ladies.<eos> Come on.<eos> Posy for the lady?<eos> Much obliged, kind sir.<eos> For you.
- How you doing? Our new favorite insurance agency!<eos> Oh, my, God, Battling Bud, you're the man!<eos> Looks like you boys made quite a night of it.<eos> Dougie, you might want to call your wife.<eos> Wife?
So you may as well tell me.<eos> Freddie, come on, tell me the story.<eos> Come on.<eos> Well... I told the doctor.<eos> I, uh...
I don't think you've ever met Wren Kingston.<eos> Ezra, this is Wren.<eos> Wren, this is Ezra Fitz.<eos> - Hello.<eos> - Pleasure.
(Siren sounds VAI)<eos> (The sound of a helicopter engine)<eos> (TV presenter)<eos> We managed to get through to the deputy of the State Duma,<eos> Michael Poleskinu.
Meanwhile, the streets adjacent to the place cordoned off by falling object.<eos> Representatives of the Defense Ministry, have so far refrained from comment.<eos> But local residents reported that the contract to a strange ball tactical groups.<eos> Observation of the object, and are fighting helicopters.<eos> (On the radio)
- Sit down.<eos> Sit down, sit down.<eos> If Th - ori.<eos> We quickly.<eos> In the course empty.
And your this element or fragment thereof.<eos> What do you think to do?<eos> - I propose to return.<eos> - To return.<eos> Them?
Must have time.<eos> (shot)<eos> Heck!<eos> Love you!<eos> (On the radio)
We want you to make an assessment of the situation here.<eos> Travel the country, talk to people.<eos> At the end of that assessment, you'll tell us what needs to be done, how you're gonna get it done and what you need in order to get it done.<eos> - So, now...<eos> - To that end...
Killing insurgents all the while, of course.<eos> Nation building.<eos> Hearts and minds.<eos> Hello!<eos> Hello, all.
Since I've been here in Afghanistan, leading ISAF?<eos> Yes.<eos> Once.<eos> I've spoken to the president once.<eos> By video teleconference.
And our vice president.<eos> That we don't have the support of our coalition partners.<eos> And that we're drunk all over Europe.<eos> Basically, a fucking drinking tour.<eos> All over Europe.
So where are we now?<eos> Uh, St. Andrews in Scotland.<eos> - Maybe after the game we can swing by.<eos> You're kind of an asshole in Scotland.<eos> Holy shit.
- You saw them, didn't you?<eos> - You should be in class.<eos> Was it the night of the lacrosse game?<eos> You saw the lightning, the men, and the horses?<eos> Dozens of them.
Any available units, this is Sheriff Stilinski.<eos> Do you copy?<eos> I repeat, any and all units, this is Sheriff Stilinski.<eos> Respond immediately with your 20.<eos> - All units...
Like Mistress of the Eastern Wood.<eos> Most Merciful and Stern.<eos> Yeah, can we just settle this weather?<eos> Surely old-Mistress showed you the lake!<eos> And the Sharpness.
I shot him.<eos> Dorothy, he knew me.<eos> That man, he knew me.<eos> Please don't say we're going to the top.<eos> One step at a time.
Fair with you.<eos> Yes.<eos> Not so much with her.<eos> You said you would free my wife.<eos> Nahara.
What was she coming to share?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Were you acting as someone's agent when you murdered her?<eos> No!<eos> On orders?
Something in you that's broken and couldn't ever be fixed.<eos> Go to hell.<eos> How did you get those?<eos> Those were hers.<eos> My sister's.
Hey, boy.<eos> Is she...<eos> Asleep.<eos> Why are you helping me?<eos> Not you.
Wait.<eos> You don't have to do that.<eos> I do see you.<eos> I've lied to you...<eos> All of you...
It's sacred.<eos> As sacred as Ozma was, herself.<eos> Is she dead?<eos> When the Wizaed defeated the beast forever, he consolidated his power by slaughtering the king and Queen.<eos> And the Princess.
Only that I've been waiting all day to be with you.<eos> How could you be so heartless to Jane?<eos> Please, Jack, no more politics.<eos> That woman gave her life to you.<eos> To your father.
Reload with chain shot and target their canvas.<eos> Reload with chain shot! Go!<eos> Fire!<eos> Gun crews!<eos> On my mark!
Fortunately we were able to discover the plot in time.<eos> The lines are settled now.<eos> He controls the town but little else.<eos> My people have free reign over most of the rest of the island.<eos> Your people?
"I need to take your drink, sir"<eos> or "I'm gonna have to take that drink, sir," neither of which happened.<eos> So don't worry about it.<eos> I'll hold her very tight while you pour my friend here a Jack and Coke and get me another one, hmm?<eos> - Flight attendants...
My boy Chris has been missing for two days.<eos> Your son is missing?<eos> - No. Not my son.<eos> My friend.<eos> He 26.
He don't look so missing to me.<eos> - That's because we found him.<eos> Right?<eos> But Chris says he's acting real different.<eos> Different How?
Phase two is this.<eos> Mental preparation.<eos> It is basically a psychological pre-op.<eos> Pre-op?<eos> - For stage three.
Transplantation.<eos> Well, partial, actually.<eos> The piece of your brain connected to your nervous system needs to stay put... keeping those intricate connections intact.<eos> So you won't be gone.<eos> At least not completely.
Who said I died, puppy?<eos> Everyone.<eos> You were just having a bad dream.<eos> You going to miss it?<eos> Eagle Point?
Nice to meet you, Nacho.<eos> What about you?<eos> I haven't been laid in years. Besides, I'm retired.<eos> - Do you miss it?<eos> - What?
What about you?<eos> I haven't been laid in years. Besides, I'm retired.<eos> - Do you miss it?<eos> - What?<eos> The job.
- I'll stick this up your ass first.<eos> - In front of everyone, darling?<eos> Look out!<eos> You, Trini.<eos> With the others.
I got my finger ready to press "send" on some brand new gym equipment.<eos> I didn't want to get into this tonight, but I had to go another way with those funds.<eos> Wait, what?<eos> I gave the money to the Women's Swim Team.<eos> The Women's Swim Team?
Totally maxed out.<eos> Right.<eos> Of course.<eos> Um, I'm sure I'll find something.<eos> Uh, we better...
We won't do the full spread every day, but it's nice to start off right.<eos> So, how'd your project end up last night?<eos> With Tony.<eos> Fine.<eos> For history, right?
I met Jessica a couple of weeks into sophomore year.<eos> Apparently, we needed to be counseled.<eos> - Mrs. Antilly?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Me, too.
What do you want?<eos> - We need to talk.<eos> - No, we don't.<eos> We have to tell someone about Justin.<eos> Like, Mr. Porter.
- We need to talk.<eos> - No, we don't.<eos> We have to tell someone about Justin.<eos> Like, Mr. Porter.<eos> Mr. Porter? Really?
We weren't friends.<eos> Friends tell the truth, friends don't turn on each other.<eos> Hannah's a user and a liar.<eos> You can't believe anything that she says.<eos> Not a thing.
You gonna talk to her?<eos> And say what?<eos> Tell her to get her shit together.<eos> She's acting like a nut job, drawing attention to herself.<eos> And you.
- Come on!<eos> Hey! - How could you do that to me?<eos> - What did you tell him?<eos> - What did I tell who?<eos> Mr. Porter!
Uh, hey, Bryce.<eos> You live around here?<eos> Um, no.<eos> A friend told me about it.<eos> Yeah, me too.
- Yeah.<eos> Where was your help last night?<eos> Where'd you go?<eos> I had a family thing.<eos> - Family thing?
Oh, my God, don't say "expose."<eos> What if he's...?<eos> Okay.<eos> For the first time, I'm freaking.<eos> Me too.
I promise.<eos> Come on.<eos> You've got this.<eos> Sir.<eos> Madam.
I'm not sure why you brought me here.<eos> Because you've been acting like Hannah killing herself was some, like, school activity.<eos> Like just a reason to put posters up.<eos> I'm trying to help the school heal.<eos> The school?
I'm trying to help the school heal.<eos> The school?<eos> Yeah.<eos> What about you?<eos> Yes, all of us.
Who'd you get?<eos> Who'd you get?<eos> How did I match with Bryce Walker?<eos> No.<eos> Not that one.
What happened?<eos> I didn't understand it. I still don't.<eos> Yeah, well, welcome to the world.<eos> Well, I hate it.<eos> Me too.
- Don't.<eos> - Why not?<eos> Because.<eos> Well, do your folks know?<eos> About you and Hannah?
Just... have to tell the truth, okay, and you'll be fine.<eos> I'm surprised at Andy and Olivia.<eos> I'm sure they miss Anna.<eos> Hannah.<eos> Hannah, of course.
Hey, Jess.<eos> Can you do me a huge favor and grab me a slice of pepperoni?<eos> Sure.<eos> Hannah!<eos> Me too!
- I don't know.<eos> But if she's facing up to it, and we have Bryce's confession...<eos> What about going through the cycle like Hannah wanted?<eos> It's time we stop thinking about what Hannah wanted and start thinking about what she needs.<eos> And Jessica.
I didn't go.<eos> Good.<eos> Good.<eos> How did Jensen know?<eos> About... me and Hannah Baker?
Jack went to hunt Captain Flint.<eos> Chances are good you've seen the last of him.<eos> When Anne was recruiting spies in Port Royal, she met a man with an estate in the wilderness.<eos> This man found it profitable to offer his services to wealthy families with a need to make troublesome family members disappear.<eos> What families?
This is how they survive.<eos> You must know this.<eos> You're too smart not to know this.<eos> They paint the world full of shadows... and then tell their children to stay close to the light.<eos> Their light.
You must know this.<eos> You're too smart not to know this.<eos> They paint the world full of shadows... and then tell their children to stay close to the light.<eos> Their light.<eos> Their reasons, their judgments.
Pretty much.<eos> We're fightin' the fight.<eos> It's better.<eos> And if I hear one more goddamn word about Fat Joey, I'm gonna smash somebody's teeth in.<eos> Good riddance to dead weight.
I don't wanna see that.<eos> So you don't have to.<eos> But someone does.<eos> Maybe a couple others -- tops.<eos> But not you and not most people.
I hope I had nothing to do with that.<eos> Oh, God, Dad, that is not your burden to bear.<eos> I feel terrible that I misjudged you.<eos> This is gonna be good for Jerry.<eos> For everybody.
Oh, God, Dad, that is not your burden to bear.<eos> I feel terrible that I misjudged you.<eos> This is gonna be good for Jerry.<eos> For everybody.<eos> For everybody.
- Get lost.<eos> Identity papers, please.<eos> Routine check.<eos> Have a nice day.<eos> You, too.
I need to speak to Munk.<eos> Hey.<eos> How was Vuko?<eos> Cool.<eos> In fact...
_<eos> - POLICE!<eos> - SHOW YOURSELF!<eos> I want this killer found.<eos> The killer!
You talk too much.<eos> So, you can understand my confusion, given that Nassau's first king embarrassed you so thoroughly and so publicly, forbade any other crew from having you.<eos> I sincerely hope it isn't because you're still holding out for some sort of apology from Teach.<eos> Fuck Teach.<eos> Yeah, fuck Teach.
Anything we should discuss?<eos> You have enough on your mind.<eos> Let this be my concern.<eos> Have you told her, my Lord?<eos> Your wife.
Do not be afraid to lead them to it.<eos> Prepare for departure!<eos> Today is the 24th.<eos> David is five today.<eos> My son.
Heaven and Earth will disappear, but my words remain forever.<eos> But no one knows the date now when the end will be, not even the angels.<eos> No, nor even God's son.
I understand.<eos> These are hard lessons.<eos> But you know what?<eos> You're gonna thank us one day.<eos> Us?
You have helped, my metal friend.<eos> But now your service is complete.<eos> It is time to shut yourself down.<eos> I can help!<eos> Arby's?
You said regulation, and I assumed...<eos> Winnie Lopez, Saint cloud Metro.<eos> Gloria burgle, Eden valley police.<eos> And chief to boot.<eos> For the moment, anyway.
Not to forget the sons of Isaac.<eos> "And my brother esau was a hairy man,"<eos> "but I am a smooth man."<eos> Then not another peep.<eos> Corinthians, leviticus.
Female dispatcher: Goahead,Edenvalley.<eos> Yeah, I'm trying to get a message to officer Lopez.<eos> Tell her I'm heading back to the po's domicile.<eos> Have her meet me there.<eos> Willdo.
The pressure I'm under...<eos> Now this.<eos> No, we both feel it.<eos> Not knowing who to trust.<eos> Me.
♪ and everyone you meet ♪<eos> ♪ ho, ho, ho... ♪<eos> ♪ have a Holly, jolly Christmas ♪<eos> ♪ And in case you didn't hear ♪<eos> ♪ oh by golly ♪
Shoes.<eos> No.<eos> Just whiskey.<eos> Make it a double.<eos> And one for my friend.
You were surprised, is all.<eos> After what happened to sy...<eos> Your darn brother.<eos> You want me to call him?<eos> My brother?
Buddy, when I'm done with you, they'll be sponging you off the floor.<eos> Yeah?<eos> You'll be in the poor house making soup out of your dirty socks.<eos> Fuck you.<eos> Me?
Those pork chops were delightful.<eos> I...<eos> Yeah, she's a hell of a cook.<eos> I'm not sure we can trust the Jew.<eos> - Who?
Gary tells me he remembers him, that he bought a ticket nowhere near Albany.<eos> Where was he going?<eos> Bridgeport.<eos> Who the fuck goes to Bridgeport, Connecticut?<eos> Apparently, this guy.
Thank you, sir.<eos> Yes, sir, I understand...<eos> Sir.<eos> This way.<eos> Madame?
The informant is off-limits.<eos> So how do we talk to him?<eos> We don't.<eos> We'll be given written summaries of statements he made to his handlers.<eos> His handlers?
A lot can happen between now and then.<eos> I live here, Saul.<eos> You don't.<eos> And the question I keep asking myself is this... Should we pack up and leave before it's too late?<eos> All eight million of us?
It's not your most attractive feature.<eos> I'd like to keep these.<eos> Now it's my turn to say "no."<eos> The question is... what do we do now?<eos> - We?
- Yeah.<eos> - Let's go!<eos> - Yeah!<eos> - Let's go. - Okay.<eos> You okay back there?
Might even be where they made the truck bomb that went off earlier this month.<eos> General McClendon, it's my sworn duty to protect the President-elect.<eos> If you know something you're not telling me-- - I don't.<eos> - Because my information tells me Elizabeth Keane wasn't the target<eos> - of that attack. - Mine, too.
We've got multiple sources of credible bombs around the building in an interior wall - right below the suite.<eos> - Go.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Multiple Intelligence sources are reporting a credible threat against this hotel.<eos> - What kind of a threat?
- Ooh. Sorry.<eos> - Hey.<eos> I see you in here again, I call the police.<eos> Have a good day.<eos> You, too.
How many more times can we do this?<eos> Well, look who's here.<eos> You had us scared, Charlie.<eos> I, um, I would've thought you'd have been used to that by now.<eos> You in pain?
Let's talk, Kevin.<eos> I am Evie Murphy.<eos> I have started a new life.<eos> I am asking you not to tell anyone that you have seen me.<eos> Not my mother, my father, my brother.
- I needed to make sure...<eos> - Who did you see?<eos> That doesn't matter.<eos> You won't tell me, but you'll tell Laurie?<eos> Who else? Matt?
- So, you know, sir, that Ukrainian separatists have seized control of a nuclear submarine.<eos> They will be weapons hot in less than an hour.<eos> Our only option is to strike first, which is why you need to take us down to DEFCON 1.<eos> Uh, I have to make a phone call first.<eos> To who?
If Isaac doesn't make it back from this meeting, wouldn't be a lot of tears.<eos> Something wrong?<eos> No.<eos> I just, um, I had to make a phone call.<eos> To who?
You okay?<eos> I just, I don't want to be here anymore.<eos> Okay, listen, uh...<eos> I want you to go to Christine's.<eos> Christine's?
- Yeah.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Do you miss it?<eos> What?<eos> The action.
Eric?<eos> Yeah?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Yeah.<eos> M-Me, too.
Come with me, and I'll show you the delightful features of your home.<eos> This is the kitchen, where you may help yourselves to meals.<eos> I expect you to keep everything gleamingly clean.<eos> "Gleamingly"?<eos> Clean.
Time for another.<eos> Never thought I'd say this, but these make me miss the heroin.<eos> - God, I miss...<eos> - this.<eos> Me, too.
Will you answer a question honestly?<eos> As honestly as I can.<eos> Are you helping me because undermining Mandiba's control over this city is good for your business interests?<eos> The easiest decisions in this world are those where what is good for business is also good for your family.<eos> F... Family?
Carol Cumberland took a bunch of pills and slit her wrists.<eos> Why?<eos> Why was Jonas there?<eos> Are you asking me or someone else in your head?<eos> You.
Uh, maybe because you've never talked about getting one before now?<eos> You're not gonna let this go, are you?<eos> It means I'll think about it.<eos> I so needed that.<eos> Same here.
Good.<eos> I'm glad.<eos> I take it you two haven't patched things up.<eos> (sighs) I've tried, but she won't text me back.<eos> Hey, her loss.
Hey. He called me.<eos> A decision of which I grow prouder - with each passing moment. - [phone chimes]<eos> Hold that thought.<eos> What the fuck am I gonna tell Grandpa?<eos> Or Grandma?
And we'd slap him around, and we'd let him go with a warning.<eos> "Don't you ever fuckin' let us catch you on this block again."<eos> You know, that kind of shit. [chuckles]<eos> This was different.<eos> Now, this kid...
Love's very popular.<eos> The want of it.<eos> A broken heart.<eos> Where do you stand with all that?<eos> Suicide?
I don't think the coroner wanted to add to their grief, but...<eos> That would accord with what we read in her diary.<eos> So what happened to him?<eos> Sent away.<eos> Family somewhere.
You don't have to stay in Oxford.<eos> You have to make a stand somewhere.<eos> They're not going to drive me out.<eos> You two done, is it?<eos> All right for some.
Prepare for course correction.<eos> .050-niner by.076.<eos> - Remember your training.<eos> - We never trained for this.<eos> On my mark.
We did!<eos> Hold on!<eos> Come on, come on.<eos> I don't miss New York at all.<eos> Not even the people?
Hold on!<eos> Come on, come on.<eos> I don't miss New York at all.<eos> Not even the people?<eos> Especially not the people.
Ah, much better.<eos> Why are... are we...<eos> Ah, the food is tremendous.<eos> Let's sit.<eos> - You familiar?
Close your eyes.<eos> Close.<eos> Yeah.<eos> What do you see?<eos> Uh, black?
Close.<eos> Yeah.<eos> What do you see?<eos> Uh, black?<eos> Black, huh?
No, but it smells spectacular!<eos> Want a taste?<eos> Yes, ma'am, I'd love to.<eos> Can we also have a little taste?<eos> Not for you!
It's a good place to be from.<eos> No buts about it.<eos> Well, hello, there, Zelda.<eos> Hey, John Sellers.<eos> Hi, y'all.
What?<eos> F... fort.<eos> Fort.<eos> We have to get out of here.<eos> I just...
Is that what you just said?<eos> Look, I'm sorry about your sister.<eos> But they threatened to kill my daughter!<eos> My daughter, Bryan!<eos> Lianne!
- Bye.<eos> - Bye.<eos> Bye.<eos> All aboard!<eos> All aboard!
That's why he was there yesterday.<eos> He made a cash withdrawal.<eos> How much?<eos> Four million Eastern Caribbean dollars.<eos> In cash?
Yes, great word.<eos> Sorry, can I just....?<eos> ♪ I need to be right by your side... ♪ Gosh.<eos> I think I could do with a drink after that.<eos> Ah, yes, er, me too.
See these marks on the occipital and left parietal?<eos> Based on the shape and spacing, they were caused by metacarpophalangeal joints two through four.<eos> Someone punched our victim.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> In the back of the head?
Let me get this straight: you killed Ian over a bad present?<eos> Look, I thought I was getting millions.<eos> And at least I deserved to be.<eos> Who do you think came up with the idea to put A.I. into sex dolls? That was me.<eos> You...
Hey, listen, you're not going to Yemen.<eos> Stop me.<eos> You won't make it three days.<eos> We need to go through the proper channels.<eos> "The proper channels"?
Welcome to the civil war.<eos> Mr. Franklin,<eos> Ms. Sheba sent me to collect you.<eos> As-salaam alaikum.<eos> Wa alaikum as-salaam.
But please, please, let me protect you.<eos> Woman's wellness center.<eos> How can I help you?<eos> I want to cancel my appointment.<eos> I just...
Woman's wellness center.<eos> How can I help you?<eos> I want to cancel my appointment.<eos> I just...<eos> We...
But things have changed.<eos> If this snowball keeps going there is nothing I can do to help you.<eos> What snowball are we discussing?<eos> Every theory that I can come up with to figure out what happened to Archer Dunhill keeps circling back to you and Alison and your friends, especially to you.<eos> Why especially to me?
- I saw her.<eos> - When?<eos> Tonight, and she gave me the Lost Woods.<eos> - She gave you a motel?<eos> - Yeah, Ali and me.
- Come on, I know you want them.<eos> You think I haven't seen that thing that you do?<eos> What thing?<eos> Making sure your arm doesn't get bigger than, what, a silver dollar?<eos> Deal.
It doesn't seem to be useful here.<eos> That was a shit-show.<eos> - Yeah, that's what my sister said.<eos> - I liked her.<eos> - Yeah, me too.
Wha...<eos> What baron did you belong to, huh?<eos> Hassan?<eos> Jacobee?<eos> Quinn?

I told you things that I've never told to anybody.<eos> Thank you for your service, Ava, but I'll be personally overseeing this novice's training from now on.<eos> As you wish, master.<eos> Are you ready?<eos> For what?
Thank you for your service, Ava, but I'll be personally overseeing this novice's training from now on.<eos> As you wish, master.<eos> Are you ready?<eos> For what?<eos> The hard part.
You're gonna take that ad off the air.<eos> And if you play that ad one more time, I'm gonna go to the judge advocate, and we will take you down -- trespassing, false representation, stolen valor -- the whole nine yards.<eos> Seriously, for eight seconds of a TV commercial?<eos> You take that ad down, or there'll be hell to pay.<eos> That clear enough for you?
I can take you upstairs, give you immunity.<eos> You should go.<eos> Don't call me again.<eos> - Visitor.<eos> - For who?
You should go.<eos> Don't call me again.<eos> - Visitor.<eos> - For who?<eos> Her.
He was in the basement.<eos> He was unconscious.<eos> But his body was still warm, so I-I started CPR.<eos> For how long?<eos> A minute or more.
Did Sylvia play me?<eos> I take that as a yes.<eos> If she cared so much about her grandson, then why was it you who protected him and not her?<eos> And she's hurt people before...<eos> You, the baby.
We're gonna need you.<eos> I can rest when I'm dead.<eos> Well, that's what I'm worried about.<eos> Didn't know you worried.<eos> About the right things.
Boo and hoo.<eos> Besides, it's not like she's got that much time left, anyway.<eos> You're disgusting.<eos> And rich.<eos> Hey, everyone.
Apologies!<eos> That was probably more like 20 breaths instead of 10.<eos> I don't see a lot of forward folding...<eos> Come on, girls.<eos> Shame on you.
I don't see a lot of forward folding...<eos> Come on, girls.<eos> Shame on you.<eos> So?<eos> Like a charm, yeah.
We all are.<eos> Everyone.<eos> We're going to make it.<eos> It's because of you.<eos> Because of my money.
Mom, he can't.<eos> He's extremely busy.<eos> Honey, any friend of yours is a friend of ours.<eos> You are welcome at my house anytime.<eos> - To your home? - Mmm-hmm.
You're here because of me.<eos> If I hadn't fallen under Dot's spell...<eos> You're not what put me here, Clary.<eos> I have to pay for my actions.<eos> Not by yourself.
Nothing to see.<eos> It's a false alarm.<eos> Just some dumbass kids pulling a prank.<eos> All right, you have a good night, huh?<eos> You, too.
Can you raise my mother from the dead?<eos> She just died, and she...<eos> Oh, God, you poor child.<eos> Oh. I am so sorry.<eos> For your loss.
I'm trying, but the injections...<eos> I can barely generate enough magic to create your Portals, let alone a spell this complex.<eos> Then perhaps you can teach her.<eos> No, she's too young.<eos> But powerful beyond her years.
They communicate through metaphors.<eos> Morgenstern means "morning star," as in, "how are thou fallen from heaven", "O, Lucifer, son of the morning."<eos> The vision seems to be speaking of a...<eos> Demonic morgenstern.<eos> Me.
Easy, Eobard.<eos> Easy.<eos> It won't stay trapped for long.<eos> We have to go.<eos> We?
Easy.<eos> It won't stay trapped for long.<eos> We have to go.<eos> We?<eos> We...
I'm going to kill you, Oswald.<eos> There is no later.<eos> If you have something to say... now is the time.<eos> Duly noted.<eos> Oh, whatever.
6 men are dead.<eos> It's impossible.<eos> Nothing is impossible with him.<eos> Where you going?<eos> Vertolet.
So what's happening?<eos> Uh, Aaron was just helping me finish my senior project.<eos> It's a cell, kind of like the one they put me in at juvie.<eos> Are you injured or intoxicated?<eos> Against the wall!
About a day and a half.<eos> There aren't any windows or clocks, so, you lose track of time.<eos> Can't believe they're allowed to do that to kids.<eos> Yeah, they can pretty much do whatever they want.<eos> - At least for now anyway.
What happened wasn't your fault.<eos> I heard you got a few shots off.<eos> And I would've put him down, too, if he wasn't wearing body armor.<eos> Listen, weren't you dishonorably discharged?<eos> Not for my aim, Hoss.
This is--this is the only way to make sure... That I d--I don't infect everyone that I love.<eos> But we love you in return for it, Ollie.<eos> And we need you at home.<eos> Please come home to me, Ollie...<eos> To Thea, your mother.
I think we should stop using our cell phones.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I'll warn the others.<eos> Good luck.<eos> You too.
There are no such things as Copy Cat Killers in the real world!<eos> They're made up!<eos> I want this killer found. You understand?<eos> !<eos> The killer!
We nearly died.<eos> And Miller just...<eos> He got you out of Eros alive.<eos> He shot an unarmed man right in the head.<eos> An unarmed mass murderer.
The protomolecule is proof that we're not alone in the universe.<eos> And our ticket out of the limitations that bind us to these pathetic little bubbles of rock and air.<eos> If we master it, we can apply it.<eos> Apply it to what?<eos> To everything.
He'll get over it.<eos> Wow.<eos> Where is Josh, anyway?<eos> He's with Mike.<eos> Mike?
Hear, hear.<eos> Save me.<eos> My apologies on behalf of the Princeton crew.<eos> We're a bit much, taken all at once.<eos> Or individually.
Oh, it doesn't matter.<eos> The National Association for Transgender People would like to give you an award.<eos> Oh, well, that's nice.<eos> Tell them I accept.<eos> - Them?
Oh, well, that's nice.<eos> Tell them I accept.<eos> - Them?<eos> - It's "her."<eos> - Her.
Tell them I accept.<eos> - Them?<eos> - It's "her."<eos> - Her.<eos> - Him.
Monica?<eos> No. Thank God.<eos> I'm Ed Chen.<eos> Laurie put me in the good office and moved Monica down the hall.<eos> Way down the hall.
And as of now, we've got the votes... of enough key Malaysian ministers to proceed with construction, but that support is time-critical.<eos> We'd have to break ground before monsoon season or else the entire project could collapse.<eos> So, what do you think?<eos> Sorry.<eos> About what?
I came from nothing.<eos> I was sold as a slave and carved up as an offering.<eos> When I was a child, I lived in alleys, gutters, abandoned houses.<eos> You wish to know where my true loyalties lie?<eos> Not with any king or queen, but with the people.
You know what they say about grief.<eos> Next to every cemetery is a motel.<eos> Once we did it, we'd already done it, and there was no undoing it.<eos> Were you going to leave me for him?<eos> For Robbie?
Welcome to Vulcan, Virginia.<eos> Where is everyone?<eos> Everyone in this particular town is a dedicated citizen.<eos> Dedicated to one sticky belief.<eos> America.
Is he...<eos> All this from faulty railings?<eos> You're no stranger to sacrifice.<eos> They don't care enough to sacrifice anymore.<eos> - Not to me.
Had.<eos> Quite a bit.<eos> Held it in keeping.<eos> Drank my share but delivered the balance on time where it was meant.<eos> To who?
Help me.<eos> My God.<eos> Of course.<eos> He's not to be trusted.<eos> Who?
What can I do?<eos> Find me, my son.<eos> I cannot rest until I lay underground once more.<eos> He cannot be trusted!<eos> Who?
Isabella is over on the other side with us.<eos> Whispering tales of murder.<eos> Dark plots are in motion, my son.<eos> Don't trust him!<eos> Who?
Whispering tales of murder.<eos> Dark plots are in motion, my son.<eos> Don't trust him!<eos> Who?<eos> The birthday boy.
That's a bit ridiculous, seeing as how I'm standing next to you most of the time.<eos> What's up?<eos> Drop it, Jim.<eos> It's your time to die today.<eos> Not his.
1:00, my place.<eos> Are you sure about this?<eos> Of course.<eos> You saved our lives.<eos> And other reasons.
- You lied to me.<eos> - I didn't tell you the truth.<eos> - It's the same thing. - Perhaps, but telling you your mother was a con artist who'd only sought you out for the purposes of getting money from me... didn't seem like a very attractive alternative.<eos> You... and her... you both lied to me.<eos> But for very different reasons.
So, who are you now?<eos> Oh, come on, Foxy.<eos> I'm the Riddler.<eos> I've always loved the view from here.<eos> Not really a fan.
Why would you take me back there?<eos> You've never left that alley, Bruce.<eos> Not really.<eos> And for you to be able to accept what it is I have to teach, you need to.<eos> Rest.
Sorry.<eos> I just got so caught up in the moment.<eos> You know, I like the idea of an auction, Gabe.<eos> I think I'll auction you off to myself.<eos> Piece by bloody piece.
Believe me, this is the last thing I wanted.<eos> Which is why I'm here.<eos> I know my nephew.<eos> Jim won't stop until one of us is dead.<eos> Unfortunate.
This virus isn't a disease.<eos> It's the best thing that's ever happened to me.<eos> I don't need a cure.<eos> I will purge Gotham and the innocents will thank me!<eos> Their savior!
It's the best thing that's ever happened to me.<eos> I don't need a cure.<eos> I will purge Gotham and the innocents will thank me!<eos> Their savior!<eos> Their executioner.
Their son.<eos> He was not harmed.<eos> That, at least, is something.<eos> All this time, Bruce, the Court was never more than a means to an end, allowing us to maintain order in Gotham.<eos> Us?
- He had to do something.<eos> We're gonna have to give you a badge or something one of these days.<eos> Please be very careful with this.<eos> GCPD!<eos> Nobody...
I'm going to kill you, Oswald.<eos> There is no later.<eos> If you have something to say... now is the time.<eos> Duly noted.<eos> Whatever.
- Help me!<eos> When I say so, open the door, all right?<eos> Now.<eos> Flash, thanks.<eos> Two of 'em.
Why don't we stop playing games, Dr. Snow, and you tell me what you actually came for rather than accusing me of having insomnia?<eos> I actually need your help.<eos> How can I help you?<eos> Well, you're the world's foremost specialist<eos> - on meta-humans...
He...<eos> I didn't know.<eos> I'm so s...<eos> - I thought...<eos> - Sorry about that.
I respect your decision.<eos> Don't screw it up.<eos> Okay, that was weird.<eos> I guess that this means that we gotta find you a place.<eos> Me?
Don't screw it up.<eos> Okay, that was weird.<eos> I guess that this means that we gotta find you a place.<eos> Me?<eos> More like us.
No way.<eos> You've got three speedsters, an ice queen, and a guy who vibes almost as well as I do.<eos> You don't need my help to stop Grodd.<eos> Need I remind you, you're the one who brought Grodd here in the first place.<eos> Not by choice!
Anyway, I mean, what are we... supposed to do?<eos> What do you think this... Music Meister needs us to do now?<eos> Ah, there you are!<eos> You two ready?<eos> Ready for...
♪ Come running' home to you ♪<eos> ♪ And all my life I promise to ♪<eos> ♪ Keep runnin' home to you ♪<eos> ♪ Keep runnin' home ♪<eos> ♪ Home to you ♪
I'll do that now.<eos> Can do.<eos> If Savitar is a version of Barry from the future and he remembers everything that Barry does, how are we ever going to come up with a plan to stop him?<eos> What was he like?<eos> Broken.
You won't feel a thing.<eos> Okay, let's get this show on the road.<eos> The disrupter is attached to your hippocampus.<eos> So, it's ready.<eos> Okay, ready for zapping.

Right, I'm not sure what lead I'm following here, but am I supposed to let them punch me, too?<eos> What?<eos> No.<eos> I screwed up.<eos> Okay, Lucifer?
That's how Takeem keep that long-distance love hot and heavy.<eos> But you got to watch all night to get the clues and ride Hakeem's birthday train.<eos> Choo-choo! We out.<eos> It's gonna be lit.<eos> - Litty.
Cookie, get the baby.<eos> We'll take care of this in court.<eos> You see all these cameras?<eos> We gonna have every one of y'all asses fired!<eos> Shame on you.
I told you not to do this.<eos> What am I doing?<eos> The gaming commissioner is right upstairs, and you're not gonna cost us our license.<eos> Our license?<eos> As in yours and mines?
Akobel, please.<eos> Go back inside.<eos> Just...<eos> You have no business here.<eos> Me?
I was angry, and...<eos> Sam and Dean, that's not your fault.<eos> No, you were right.<eos> I should never have left them.<eos> I...
So close.<eos> Shall we end the suspense?<eos> What's that?<eos> Six in a row?<eos> Beginner's luck.
So how you holding up after the spell?<eos> That thing kicked my ass.<eos> You know, I gotta be honest.<eos> I was actually, uh, a little jealous at first.<eos> Of what?
Vampires nest in groups of 8 to 10.<eos> Victims are taken to the nest where the pack keeps them alive, bleeding them for days or weeks.<eos> We don't decapitate vampires.<eos> We irradiate them.<eos> Cool.
She say anything about her boys?<eos> As I've said many, many, so many times, we don't need them.<eos> We already have the best Winchester. Yes.<eos> But that's not your call, is it?<eos> Or mine.
Lived under our house and made our family rich.<eos> All we had to do was... Was feed it.<eos> Feed it what?<eos> Blood.<eos> Human blood.
But even dying, she was rude.<eos> So... I made her into one of my creatures.<eos> That doll has all of your mother's memories.<eos> It's her.<eos> Mostly.
Can't raise the little nipper from a jail cell now, can I?<eos> Speaking of... you know where your little pal Castiel is?<eos> Go to hell.<eos> Ooh!<eos> Good one.
Gave me time to think.<eos> You know, I've been focused for so long on keeping my job. Never realized I hate it.<eos> All those whining demons, the endless moan of damned souls, the paperwork!<eos> I mean, who wants that?<eos> You.
She's a regular.<eos> Right.<eos> Do you know her well?<eos> No.<eos> Only through work.
Had one fag break all night, a ten-minute wander in the garden and that was it.<eos> What time was the fag break?<eos> Late, er... half 11, 12?<eos> Where did you walk?<eos> Down the lake and back.
Why would you lie about what you were doing on the night a woman was raped?<eos> Look, it's daft, but I picked a fare up off the road.<eos> - What?<eos> - I know we're not supposed to.<eos> Legally.
Sarah Elsey.<eos> I work here with Ian.<eos> I'm his girlfriend.<eos> And you're now admitting to sending this text to his wife?<eos> - Ex-wife.
- No, not really.<eos> - Was he with you all night?<eos> - Didn't take my eyes off him.<eos> Whose house did you go back to?<eos> His.
Thanks, Danielle.<eos> Hiya.<eos> What can I get you?<eos> - Do you believe her?<eos> - Not a word.
- Doner.<eos> - Was the kebab shop busy?<eos> - Don't think so, no.<eos> - Do you believe her?<eos> - Not a word.
But I don't let it win.<eos> He is selfish and weak.<eos> Part of me wishes he'd succeeded.<eos> And we're left to clear it up.<eos> His family.
I'll get my hands on your fortune if it's the last thing I do.<eos> And when I have it,<eos> I will tear you and your siblings from limb to limb.<eos> Not funny, guys.<eos> Olaf?

Are there any snakes in this room that are dangerous?<eos> Well, of course.<eos> You can't study snakes and not find some that are dangerous.<eos> I have an entire cabinet full of venom samples from some of the most venomous snakes known to man.<eos> And woman.
But that's nothing.<eos> It's my random junk collection, which is private property, illegally obtained, and therefore not admissible in court.<eos> It does look like junk. But that's when I noticed this.<eos> Uncle Monty told us that he keeps venom samples in his cabinet from every venomous snake known to man.<eos> - And woman.

- No!<eos> We know where we're going.<eos> I know where you're going, too. And I'm the adult so I get to decide.<eos> - We're going to our Aunt Josephine.<eos> - To your Aunt Josephine.
Well, you've had plenty of clients right where I am.<eos> What do they tell their kids?<eos> I got no fucking clue what to say to my boys.<eos> No one ever does.<eos> At least, not in advance.
But that was this morning's price.<eos> Different kind of urgency as the closing bell approaches.<eos> Say what the more is, and I'll see if I can afford it.<eos> To help you with some personnel decisions.<eos> One personnel decision.
Hey, Rufus, wait!<eos> Rufus, wait!<eos> Rufus, wait!<eos> Rufus!<eos> Rufus?
Who's there?<eos> Who's out there?<eos> Rufus?<eos> My god.<eos> Rufus?
Doesn't mean she loves any less.<eos> Wait till your mom is asleep.<eos> If you can get Adrian to go with you... You can go for a couple of hours.<eos> No drinking.<eos> Back by midnight.
Christ.<eos> And what do you have that Jimmy doesn't?<eos> A surveillance camera I found in Gunn's apartment.<eos> And I found something else that night.<eos> - An owl.
And what do you have that Jimmy doesn't?<eos> A surveillance camera I found in Gunn's apartment.<eos> And I found something else that night.<eos> - An owl.<eos> - An owl?
Yeah, this is my city, I grew up here.<eos> A friend told me about CRT, and I thought, maybe, just maybe, it would...<eos> And I was right.<eos> Trying to help other people, it helps me somehow.<eos> At least sometimes.
Hey, Maddie, your driving instructor's here.<eos> Coming.<eos> Be a good listener, and drive carefully.<eos> Well, it's easy if your dad isn't clutching the dashboard like the plane's going down in flames.<eos> Much easier for your dad, too.
- You got a place where he can lie down?<eos> - Couch.<eos> No.<eos> Goods wants you to take him to your place.<eos> My place.
Yeah.<eos> This whole thing is a... big misunderstanding.<eos> There's absolutely no way it's going to trial.<eos> Who wants that hassle?<eos> Not me.
But he never would have used it on me.<eos> Did you feel physically threatened?<eos> My brother is a lot of things, but even he has limits.<eos> And you're willing to appear as a witness even though he's family?<eos> Unfortunately, yes.
That's great, Jimmy.<eos> Best I could hope for, right?<eos> Right.<eos> What does she want you to confess to?<eos> All of it.
Yes?<eos> I'll be right there.<eos> I want you all to go home now.<eos> You will be compensated for your full shifts.<eos> Normal schedule tomorrow.
Holy...<eos> Well, c-can I just say, sir, that you are one of the people who made the greatest generation so damn great?<eos> I salute you.<eos> A'ight, see you soon.<eos> On TV, right.
Definitely.<eos> The mining rights would be all his.<eos> Really?<eos> He called me.<eos> For obvious reasons.
Oh, of course. I remember Lauren.<eos> Good to see you again, Kim.<eos> This is Jack Sweet, our new CFO.<eos> - Oh, hello.<eos> - Pleasure.
There has been a twist in the Larry Henderson murder investigation.<eos> Apparently Mr. Henderson wasn't the faithful husband he appeared to be.<eos> That's nonsense.<eos> WPFK has learned that Larry's cellphone contained over 200 texts to this man...<eos> Alfonzo Prefontaine.
What if I were to tell you a conglomerate of bankers are about to take down the economy.<eos> That the Dow, NASDAQ, long bonds are all about to drop 80% in the blink of an eye?<eos> Total collapse.<eos> Panic on the streets. Law and order in flames.<eos> And by the way, almost certainly the end of this President.
For you, anything.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Is that tension that I sense?<eos> - In the air?<eos> - In you.
Human warmth, connection.<eos> I just killed a man.<eos> You do have a kind face.<eos> Maybe you should call your nephew.<eos> - My nephew?
They'll I.D. Her body within the next few hours.<eos> I'm just glad you all got to know her even a little bit.<eos> From a little shop on j street.<eos> I'm sorry for your loss, Christina.<eos> Our loss.
- You just did it again.<eos> - Who else have you told?<eos> - About Sangravan?<eos> About my daughter.<eos> No one.
What happened here?<eos> What just happened?<eos> Mattie!<eos> Mattie!<eos> Mattie!
I don't know you.<eos> You've never really let me in.<eos> I work for a government intelligence organization.<eos> We report directly to the president.<eos> The president?
Mejia's gone.<eos> Get me a helo.<eos> Doctor says six weeks.<eos> Finally get to spend some time at home.<eos> Me too.
He's under the impression that you can't play varsity football because I'm making you work for me.<eos> Which is odd, because you made it seem like you couldn't work for me because you were playing football.<eos> So my first question is...<eos> Who are you lying to?<eos> Me or your coach?
Which is odd, because you made it seem like you couldn't work for me because you were playing football.<eos> So my first question is...<eos> Who are you lying to?<eos> Me or your coach?<eos> Neither.
That said, I need star power.<eos> I need the Pussycats.<eos> Stay loose and limber, ladies, while I make a call.<eos> After this practice, I'll totally need a pedicure.<eos> You?
About Jason?<eos> I told her.<eos> But half the time, your sister doesn't even know what day it is.<eos> Mom, why were you so against them being together?<eos> Many reasons.
You are different than what I thought you'd be.<eos> A former It Girl from New York, made off like a fall from grace?<eos> I assumed you'd be high maintenance.<eos> Now tell me, what do you miss most about home?<eos> Only everything.
I met your music teacher last night.<eos> Yeah, Ms. Grundy?<eos> Whoa. They did not look like that in my day, son.<eos> Ah, what were you guys talking about?<eos> You.
It's the only piece of property in my name and not your father's.<eos> - Betty, can I get you anything?<eos> - A job.<eos> I can't very well have the wife of Hiram Lodge, on trial for fraud and embezzlement, balancing my books.<eos> Oh, Hiram...
But why didn't you call the cops or animal control services?<eos> It was a message... for me from the Serpents.<eos> I didn't call the police because I don't trust them.<eos> I don't trust half the people in this damn town.<eos> Just you.
Turns out they weren't local.<eos> Why are you telling me, not Fred?<eos> One of my guys says he knows 'em from a stint doing time up north, in Montreal.<eos> Pretty sure we both know who has business in Montreal.<eos> Hiram?
Why would FP fess up to something he didn't even do?<eos> Yeah, I'm not thinking about FP right now.<eos> I'd like to know why your father is stealing and destroying evidence in a murder investigation.<eos> Look, I was worried that the investigation would get back to Polly, somehow.<eos> To us.
Never come back here!<eos> Understand?<eos> Got it.<eos> He called Joaquin?<eos> Why not Jughead?
Understand?<eos> Got it.<eos> He called Joaquin?<eos> Why not Jughead?<eos> Or your dad?
Got it.<eos> He called Joaquin?<eos> Why not Jughead?<eos> Or your dad?<eos> Or a lawyer?
Our new crew.<eos> I let the Serpents go.<eos> You fired them? Why would you do that?<eos> The Mayor and Sheriff Keller are cracking down.<eos> Especially on the Serpents.
I've reconsidered something.<eos> About your song.<eos> Welcome, one and all, to Riverdale's 75th anniversary Jubilee celebration!<eos> I couldn't be any more thrilled to introduce my daughter, Josie, and her Pussycats, as they perform alongside our local hero, Archie Andrews!<eos> Hi, hi, everyone.
It all seemed perfectly normal.<eos> Yes.<eos> We did some Molly, fooled around.<eos> Clothes came off.<eos> - Consensual.
We think Jafar killed Danny out of jealousy.<eos> And Danny's DNA was on Jafar's shoes.<eos> "Finally, someone putting those Muslim..."<eos> I'll skip the next two words, but they begin with M and F...<eos> "In their place."
- That you were unhappy here. - I wasn't.<eos> Instead of leading me to believe that this was something that you wanted,<eos> Mellie, you should be proud.<eos> Is that what you tell them?<eos> "Them"?
Lovely in a ghastly production.<eos> This town has a short mAmory.<eos> She'd better find a new play quickly.<eos> Someone needs to dance with us.<eos> At your service.
- That's absurd.<eos> - I've already spoken to my colleagues at United Artists about it.<eos> You spoke to them about Paradise?<eos> Yes, because I would adapt it, obviously.<eos> Obviously.
I can't take all the credit.<eos> Fred was in town.<eos> UA Casting Department shared it with him.<eos> He went gangbusters for our girl.<eos> My girl. Oh.
Blah, blah, puka shells, blah, blah, karate, blah, blah, blah, sleeping in my old twin bed, blah, blah, intensive purposes.<eos> See, I always urge people to hang on to their receipts, because of our generous return policy;<eos> 60 days, with or without the box.<eos> Go back to Board Shorts McGee.<eos> Board Shorts, McGee...
Have you ever met a Jew before Rebecca?<eos> No.<eos> Yeah. Probably should've started with that question.<eos> I love Adam Sandler.<eos> Me, too.
♪ They just got Santa Ana winded. ♪<eos> - I had the weirdest dream last night.<eos> - You did?<eos> So did I.<eos> Oh, me, too.
What do you mean Josh is not coming to the wedding?<eos> !<eos> Yeah, uh, hold on, let me just finish.<eos> I, uh, I-I just got off the phone with Josh.<eos> The phone? !
Whoever did this knows his shit.<eos> Idon'twannamake a buck no more<eos> Idon'twannabea bumnomore<eos> Idon'twantyourspit , I don't want your hate<eos> Ineedmorethan...
Lawless.<eos> And empty.<eos> They scooped up a lot of people when they walled up the big cities, and then they have big drone walkers that break up any major settlement, so most of the survivors are scattered.<eos> Sounds like the wild west.<eos> Yeah, basically.
She got some balls on her. I give her that.<eos> Is there a plan if she actually manages to do it?<eos> If we get her out of the bloc, we can go with her.<eos> You know a way out of here?<eos> Tunnels, maybe.
I assure you that our residents were doing the best job that they could.<eos> Dr. Miller, who did you leave in charge?<eos> Dr. Sekara, ma'am.<eos> I believe she was talking to me.<eos> Sekara.
I'm just saying that maybe we don't need to call a family meeting every single time Holden leaves the house.<eos> You know, for someone who hates how people won't shut up about his brother, you sure won't shut up about your brother.<eos> You're right.<eos> So what are you in the mood for?<eos> Something... orange.
- Hi, Roz. - Why don't you guys go in?<eos> Yeah, yeah, all good.<eos> Right, then.<eos> Have a good day.<eos> You too.
- Oh... Have another.<eos> Please. I...<eos> I don't get to speak to many people besides Mummy and Reverend Golightly.<eos> Am I keeping you from someone?<eos> Your... Your wife?
No more than usual.<eos> Any news about Reverend Golightly?<eos> I've been taken off the case, I'm afraid.<eos> - Because of me? - No.<eos> Because of me.
She said she was Mrs Pettybon's assistant.<eos> She asked me what I was doing there.<eos> I said I was lost, and went on my way.<eos> The daughter, you mean?<eos> Bettina?
- Well, it's possible.<eos> But it's also possible the baby will be stillborn, or only live for hours.<eos> And we have no way of knowing which way the dice will fall.<eos> In which case, we must prepare Mrs Reed for every scenario.<eos> Even the saddest.
I can't see him, Jess!<eos> He's a stranger to me.<eos> You think that's how I want him to know me?<eos> I won't be a father like this, Jessie.<eos> Not like this.
Without the Maternity Home, many of our patients would have the choice between giving birth in damp, overcrowded housing, or a bus ride, while in labour, to a hospital where their children couldn't visit.<eos> Personally, I don't think that's any choice at all.<eos> Next question is about how you would respond to an emergency.<eos> But I think that's been established.<eos> Sadly, yes.
Oh, Phyllis!<eos> I've spent a lot of time wanting to be with someone, now I have the opportunity I'm not sure I have the gumption.<eos> Failure isn't fatal, but hesitation can be.<eos> Give yourself a chance.<eos> And him.
- Yes.<eos> - Men all like to talk.<eos> Oh, he champion.<eos> How do you like it here?<eos> Different.
How much we hate gym class, Michael Jackson, church.<eos> And then I came home, made cookies, and I did my homework.<eos> I wish this were simple, Paige.<eos> I wish... you could have a nice boyfriend across the street - and just the usual problems.<eos> - Me, too.
I'm Tyrion Lannister.<eos> - Davos Seaworth.<eos> - Ah, the Onion Knight.<eos> We fought on opposite sides at the Battle of Blackwater Bay.<eos> Unluckily for me.
Oh, I will return, dear Spider.<eos> - One last time.<eos> - My lady...<eos> I have to die in this strange country.<eos> Just like you.
Which wise man said this?<eos> I don't remember.<eos> Are you trying to present your own statements as ancient wisdom?<eos> I would never do that.<eos> To you.
I knew it would kill me or I'd kill myself before it could.<eos> Daenerys Stormborn convinced me otherwise.<eos> The only place for me is back with her.<eos> I owe her my life.<eos> Her and you.
I lost this dagger.<eos> To whom?<eos> Tyrion Lannister.
We're not.<eos> They say you killed Joffrey.<eos> Did you?<eos> I wish I had.<eos> Hmm. Me, too.
Wait!<eos> Wait for it!<eos> Spears out!<eos> - Spears out!<eos> - Steady!
Daenerys is not her father.<eos> And she never will be with the right counsel.<eos> You need to find a way to make her listen.<eos> - Who's that for?<eos> - Jon Snow.
She's even willing to suspend the hostilities if Cersei agrees to certain terms.<eos> If you want Cersei to bend the knee, you can ask her yourself.<eos> I- - I don't.<eos> And Daenerys doesn't.<eos> Not right now, anyway.
Fish hook.<eos> Some men you just can't teach.<eos> We was looking for a dwarf with a scar like that a while back.<eos> Perhaps there's some arrangement?<eos> Arrangement?
You son of a bitch.<eos> Please.<eos> I'm a businessman.<eos> I make good products available to anyone who wants to buy.<eos> And at reasonable prices.
Well, I think what the lad needs now is some RR.<eos> A crack at a title.<eos> Southern Area Belt.<eos> You will be taking on Bethnal Green's finest.<eos> Devon Hoyle?
You know, Harry didn't wanna press her.<eos> Figured she'd been through enough already.<eos> Yeah, he thought we could make the case another way.<eos> When it comes to hookers, Harry's heart bleeds.<eos> For obvious reasons.
Maybe they can find someone else to get the recordings.<eos> From Kimmy.<eos> It's not just me having a hard time.<eos> It's you too.<eos> The kids.
Now walk in your circle and keep your damn mouth shut.<eos> Walk!<eos> This better be good.<eos> I need you to get a message to Cyrus.<eos> Cyrus?
Would it be possible to get a pen and paper?<eos> Please?<eos> Feet on the line, hands through the slot.<eos> Or do you want me to tell your visitor to go screw herself?<eos> Visitor?
Don't say it if it is not the truth.<eos> - Over here!<eos> - Go!<eos> I just wanted to see you suffer.<eos> On the gate!
- Over here!<eos> - Go!<eos> I just wanted to see you suffer.<eos> On the gate!<eos> On the gate!
Well, we could stop at that diner.<eos> With the giant homemade cinnamon rolls.<eos> Don't tempt me.<eos> Please don't take this the wrong way, but regional pastor meetings aren't exactly my idea of fun.<eos> Me either.
No, no, I'm so sorry.<eos> No, it's okay, I just...<eos> Okay.<eos> You good there?<eos> - Smooth, right?
Wow! Hope that fortune cookie was delicious.<eos> My life's purpose is dedicated to preventing humankind from reaching too far, crossing a bridge that should never be crossed.<eos> You can help me prevent a catastrophe.<eos> And, Holden, when you succeed, you'll wake up in that hospital bed and you can go back to your life.<eos> Back to Butch and Sundance.
This... the same thing happened to me.<eos> There's always a clock on it.<eos> I had one day to come up with 175,000.<eos> So I... got Dockery's money, his cash out of the safe and... and, um, I-I pawned some collateral... to come up with the rest.<eos> What the fuck?
- So, how you been? - Good.<eos> I, uh...<eos> I found this youth intervention program out in Jamaica Queens.<eos> So I'm thinkin' about workin' with them.<eos> No shit, huh? Wow.
There's always been risk.<eos> Why are you giving up now?<eos> You're not afraid of losing me.<eos> You're afraid of losing.<eos> To Frost.
- Lila. - Hey.<eos> Meet my old buddy Noah.<eos> - Hi.<eos> - Nice to meet you.<eos> - You too.
About us.<eos> Okay.<eos> Well, why did you need to see my doctor?<eos> I needed her professional opinion, I guess.<eos> About what?
I don't play them.<eos> I'm busy making a president.<eos> You know we keep losing ground?<eos> They don't like her.<eos> Who?
I'm busy making a president.<eos> You know we keep losing ground?<eos> They don't like her.<eos> Who?<eos> People...
But you do understand what's at stake should you opt out?<eos> Olivia will be fine.<eos> But Sandra won't be.<eos> She walks.<eos> Sandra.
Jennifer.<eos> Jennifer Fields.<eos> I need to know everything about her.<eos> With projections for Texas and Virginia now clear, this entire election has come down to one state...<eos> California.
Hey, don't do that.<eos> Don't make cat noises just because a woman says she doesn't like another woman.<eos> I'm just saying... you sound kind of jealous of her.<eos> Jealous?<eos> Of what?
Don't make cat noises just because a woman says she doesn't like another woman.<eos> I'm just saying... you sound kind of jealous of her.<eos> Jealous?<eos> Of what?<eos> That basic 2004 pixie cut?
All I need to do is sit back and watch the Electoral College make history.<eos> Isn't that wonderful?<eos> No, it's not, because it wouldn't be fair.<eos> Fair?<eos> To whom?
Isn't that wonderful?<eos> No, it's not, because it wouldn't be fair.<eos> Fair?<eos> To whom?<eos> To the country.
No, it's not, because it wouldn't be fair.<eos> Fair?<eos> To whom?<eos> To the country.<eos> To Cyrus.
Who just up and skips town like that, right?<eos> Guess the pressure really got to her.<eos> Either that or she's finally sick. Of screwing her way through half this town.<eos> And decided to move on to greener pastures.<eos> Her loss.
Whatever.<eos> That's ridiculous.<eos> Yeah, I know.<eos> In landing position.<eos> Okay, - right on schedule.
I don't know if you've noticed, But the guy over there in the navy blue suit?<eos> He has an entire military at his disposal.<eos> Let's fight blood with blood.<eos> It's not our decision.<eos> Not our decision?
Peus bounced it off of satellites over Russia, Argentina, Australia.<eos> I've got my boys in the NSA working on it, but...<eos> Unfortunately, we don't exactly have the luxury of time.<eos> Peus could detonate another bomb at any second.<eos> These people...
I told you I was running.<eos> Dad!<eos> Dad!<eos> Dad!<eos> This way.
No, I've got more friends in the North K. than you do.<eos> I used to kill there on the regular.<eos> Get started.<eos> I never touched it, you know.<eos> The money.
About time a Belter was.<eos> See?<eos> You're already friends.<eos> One to each person.<eos> One each.
See?<eos> You're already friends.<eos> One to each person.<eos> One each.<eos> One per person.
You ran with the Five Points crew.<eos> I grew up in the Rosse Burt, too.<eos> Do you know how old you are?<eos> Nineteen, I think.<eos> Earther years.
This isn't what I want either.<eos> - Where are you taking her?<eos> - She has a research trip.<eos> I'm going to Sardinia.<eos> Sardinia?
- They don't need to know about you and me.<eos> - Do you realise what will happen to you?<eos> I have to make things right, no matter what the cost.<eos> Do you really think they'll believe you?<eos> A cocktail waiter?
Not sure where that leaves us.<eos> Fucked is where it leaves us.<eos> Especially you.<eos> - [knocking on door] - Yeah.<eos> Hey, babe?
Hey, 1933 called.<eos> They want their gold digger back.<eos> Meanwhile, I have to dip into my rainy day fund, which is barely enough to buy an extremely nice umbrella.<eos> Wait. What the...<eos> Holy shit.
I have no idea why I'm telling you all this.<eos> Or why I picked you up.<eos> I don't even know where you're going.<eos> Hopefully Long Beach.<eos> Well, too bad.
- Daxam is still there, but it's a wasteland.<eos> I wanna be a superhero.<eos> I wanna help you, keep the world spinning.<eos> I've never felt like this about...<eos> About anyone.
Be a hero.<eos> Kara's alone.<eos> Supergirl's handling Rhea.<eos> Right now, we need to help the people in that building.<eos> We?
Because although I know it wasn't a bribe, the facts line up.<eos> He would be disgraced.<eos> Removed from office, indicted.<eos> But Wendy Rhoades would be indicted, too.<eos> Indonesian?
Lucky for your mom and everybody the bomb didn't hurt anyone.<eos> And I'm really glad you weren't there.<eos> Look, I-I gotta get going.<eos> Aiden asked me to come in and work a little early to help prep<eos> - for a party...
And... congrats to you, too, Sharon.<eos> Would it be out of line for me to say how relieved I am?<eos> Not at all.<eos> Though your work may be a little bit more difficult.<eos> Fortunately,
And that is what you want for me, even now?<eos> I am to be the spoils of war?<eos> The wife of a marauding madman whose mother even murdered children just so he could snatch the crown?<eos> You knew that you would marry whichever one of them should win. This man is the victor.<eos> For now, at least.
 Yeah.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Listen, I got to go catch a bus.<eos>  Yeah, yeah, have a great evening?<eos>  You too.  All right.
You can't just say, "It'll be okay?"<eos> You want me to lie to him?<eos> Why not?<eos> You lie to everybody else.<eos> Just the criminals.
It's not a conflict of interest for me.<eos> I'm very good at my job.<eos> Is that her?<eos> Is that the lawyer?<eos> Unfortunately, yes.
I am shocked.<eos> Good luck getting your precious back from those mean hobbits, Sméagol.<eos> - Uh, Kent.<eos> - Will.<eos> I, uh...
I love women, especially my beautiful fiancée, Amy.<eos> But now it is time to focus on the issues at hand that concern the people of the state of Nevada.<eos> Let us pray.<eos> Heavenly Father, warden of eternal light, teach us to love women, but in a way that is respectful.<eos> And also, Your compassion.
So what happened between you and Chester, anyway?<eos> I grew up.<eos> He found out about my nature and threw me out.<eos> Now, you people, you like little boys, too, don't ya?<eos> "You people"?
He called it his hideaway.<eos> Said he kept all his treasures there.<eos> Silly things children come up with.<eos> Your son ever have anything at all to do with Valentine Otis?<eos> The sheriff?
Said he kept all his treasures there.<eos> Silly things children come up with.<eos> Your son ever have anything at all to do with Valentine Otis?<eos> The sheriff?<eos> The sheriff?
Illium smart.<eos> Cracker call po-po, sure as you born.<eos> That's what they do.<eos> Bad Mojo.<eos> Bad Mojo.
Got some things about this case. Been making my brain itch.<eos> I've been waitin' on you, boy.<eos> Your uncle's life work.<eos> I need to make copies of all these.<eos> Bad mojo.
Moron.<eos> You've been drinkin'.<eos> Just fix it!<eos> Some people learn the hard way, judge.<eos> And others?
Say, on a scale of 1 to 10, would you say?<eos> 2.<eos> If I'm being generous.<eos> Well, then how good of a lawyer are you?<eos> Same scale.
Say something!<eos> - Say something, God damn it.<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> That's all you got?<eos> You sorry?
All of his blood cell counts have bottomed out.<eos> Add that to the vomiting, the skin and lung abnormalities, the loss of hair--<eos> What is it?<eos> It's been a long time since medical school, but sure as hell looks to me like he's been exposed to radiation.<eos> Radiation?
Then he gives up you and everybody else.<eos> There's no good out here.<eos> He wants to talk to you.<eos> You're lucky, you know?<eos> The two of you.
- Why?<eos> Why not?<eos> You're not supposed to get involved.<eos> What are you teaching her anyway?<eos> Everything.
He saved Susan's life.<eos> Two years ago.<eos> Her heart, of all things.<eos> And as a mark of gratitude, Edgar left a major bequest in his will.<eos> - To the hospital?
Her heart, of all things.<eos> And as a mark of gratitude, Edgar left a major bequest in his will.<eos> - To the hospital?<eos> - No.<eos> To Merlyn, personally.
Rats have had a nibble, haven't they?<eos> Anyway, you haven't forgotten about tonight?<eos> Counting on you.<eos> OK, ladies and gentlemen.<eos> Ready for the next question?
- You've been unlucky in love.<eos> - Who hasn't?<eos> There's a maize field about a mile east of here.<eos> Who does it belong to?<eos> Zebulon Sadler.
You're gonna be my alibi.<eos> We were together all night.<eos> I never left the house.<eos> You expect me to be your alibi for a murder you didn't commit because you were actually murdering the person who was your alibi?<eos> Basically, yeah.
- I don't know.<eos> It felt like I needed it.<eos> Do you?<eos> Well, it saved my life.<eos> And mine.
I understand, just not tonight.<eos> Well, there are things we need to talk about.<eos> - Like what?<eos> - Well, your daughter, for one.<eos> Diana?
- Why?<eos> - I felt like I needed it.<eos> - Do you?<eos> - Well, it saved my life.<eos> And mine.
There is a difference.<eos> Well, it's annoying in either case.<eos> You know, it's been a long time since I've seen her.<eos> - Seen who?<eos> - Diana.
Okay, well, we'll call you later.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - I like the new place.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> - Me too.
Excellent choice.<eos> Sign here and here.<eos> That's it.<eos> Have a nice day.<eos> You too.
You owe me.<eos> I understand you're upset.<eos> I just... you are gonna make me captain of that precinct, or your little girl dies.<eos> I need some coffee.<eos> Me too.
You have to hurry.<eos> Help me.<eos> Where are you?<eos> I'm... I'm at the old Portland metalworks shack.<eos> 2872 northwest industrial.
I could not kill my son again.<eos> Get away from me!<eos> No, no!<eos> I'm so sorry... son.<eos> Me... too...
- No, you?<eos> - No.<eos> What if this thing isn't afraid of Grimms?<eos> You know, I kind of like you with the stubble.<eos> Me too.
You know, I just had a thought.<eos> What if the Jubokko took the Kinoshimobe to protect it from us?<eos> I don't know, but I gotta get back.<eos> I'm done for tonight.<eos> Yeah, yeah, me too.
I know, Mrs. Cutler, you sure did.<eos> And I wanna run again.<eos> Well, we can't go run now.<eos> - It's too dark outside.<eos> - Ooh, through the woods...
Yes, Brother.<eos> Truly, I am blessed.<eos> Tell Father that I'll pray for him.<eos> Morwenna!<eos> This way, madam.
- Now you can supply the feast.<eos> If you can supply the guests.<eos> I saw George outside his new bank.<eos> - Geoffrey Charles was with him.<eos> - By choice?
Do you think they will go away?<eos> I suspect not.<eos> Your wife has suffered a serious fall.<eos> You should prepare yourself.<eos> For what?
Well, some do clep me "pirate," and some "free trader."<eos> And some, less flattering' names?<eos> "Fixer, fetcher." that's what I calls it.<eos> - You wants it, I ferret it out!<eos> - At a cost.
Do I understand that Dr Enys assisted at Valentine's delivery?<eos> I'm sure we were much obliged to him.<eos> I assume he's now returned to the navy.<eos> I believe he's in the Channel Patrol, with the Western Squadron.<eos> The Western?
Naturally.<eos> Therein lies the problem.<eos> You should be aware that if you decline this role, it will be offered elsewhere...<eos> Nevertheless, I do decline.<eos> To Mr George Warleggan.
The guards have orders to speak to no-one... .. but there is one I know.<eos> He tells me there are survivors of a recent sea battle.<eos> Could he provide names?<eos> Possibly.<eos> For a price.
What would it cost him?<eos> How could it hurt him to...?<eos> Of course.<eos> He must know that you're my brothers.<eos> Judas!
And we acquire a smaller vessel.<eos> Then take the river inland, to a creek close to the prison at Quimper.<eos> Plans have changed.<eos> Ross and the men be on their own now.<eos> Judas!
By affecting Ross' standing amongst the local worthies.<eos> You must see, my dear?<eos> It is a question I feel dutybound to ask tonight at Tregothnan.<eos> Tom Harry's got wind of it.<eos> Judas!
What's happened to my husband?<eos> Did I mention I've had good news from Harrow?<eos> Geoffrey Charles is to start there next term.<eos> George has set a trap.<eos> Judas!
- Or shortly after.<eos> So Unwin has his uses, after all.<eos> - A letter for you, Miss. - Thank you.<eos> Geoffrey Charles and I are to go to Truro for Christmas.<eos> To Uncle George's?
What do 'ee think to find?<eos> This be a Godfearing, lawabiding house.<eos> You can't take that. 'Twas a gift from a friend.<eos> Drake Carne, I have orders to take 'ee to Truro jail.<eos> On what charge?
On what charge?<eos> The theft of a valuable Bible from the house of Mr George Warleggan.<eos> Bible?<eos> I've never even opened it to see what it was.<eos> Judas!
By all means.<eos> Is this not good news?<eos> Now we need not tell him of Morwenna's disgrace.<eos> It is excellent news.<eos> But not for that reason.
- My dear, what an age it's been! - Hmm!<eos> You and George must dine with us.<eos> I would have asked him today, but he left in such haste.<eos> George has been to visit?<eos> Oh, not me.
You and George must dine with us.<eos> I would have asked him today, but he left in such haste.<eos> George has been to visit?<eos> Oh, not me.<eos> My husband.
George has been to visit?<eos> Oh, not me.<eos> My husband.<eos> A social call?<eos> A private matter.
By whom?<eos> George Warleggan.<eos> And Reverend Whitworth.<eos> I can't decide which encounter was the more unpleasant.<eos> In what regard?
And Reverend Whitworth.<eos> I can't decide which encounter was the more unpleasant.<eos> In what regard?<eos> Mmm... Nothing I'm at liberty to disclose.<eos> Regrettably.
Since I intend to vanquish his nominee on election day, you'd do better to apply to Sir Francis and I.<eos> Oh, well, in that case... .. I feel sure your support would sway the decision in my favour.<eos> Erm... Lieutenant Armitage brought me a plant from his uncle's garden.<eos> It seems we share a love of flora.<eos> And fauna?
Oh, well, in that case... .. I feel sure your support would sway the decision in my favour.<eos> Erm... Lieutenant Armitage brought me a plant from his uncle's garden.<eos> It seems we share a love of flora.<eos> And fauna?<eos> Of the mangy, flea-ridden variety?
No pretence needed.<eos> Every night is our wedding night to me.<eos> Lieutenant Armitage was most attentive today.<eos> - To whom?<eos> - Your wife.
How went the visit to Tehidy?<eos> We will discuss it another time.<eos> Well?<eos> I regret I must decline.<eos> Your reason?
Well and truly, sir.<eos> That's all I need to know.<eos> Drake!<eos> Must've happened in the night.<eos> Judas!
I do not endorse bloodshed and violence.<eos> I am not that man, Demelza, I have never been that man.<eos> If you do not challenge the corrupt and unjust, then commoners will rise.<eos> You'd subdue by force, your old comrades and friends?<eos> Judas!
Why don't we just make piles based on date, Relevance and evidentiary value?<eos> Have you done this before?<eos> From prison, yeah.<eos> I filed appeals.<eos> Mine, some other guys'.
Give me a break on this one, Gar.<eos> Okay?<eos> Say you didn't see me.<eos> Tulip, if it was me... maybe.<eos> Old times' sake.
It's not a question.<eos> Why did it have to be New Orleans, huh?<eos> I knew someone would see me here.<eos> Mrs. Barbaret is probably telling Viktor right now.<eos> Viktor?
- You tell me.<eos> Why, Bert?<eos> Explain to me why.<eos> I work for the Secretary of Defense, a vapid puppet of the spineless President, who refuses to confront the increasing threat.<eos> Of Islam.
Wait.<eos> The fall?<eos> He fell?<eos> Based on his injuries, weight,<eos> And the damage to the tree,
That is so thoughtful.<eos> Um... I've been doing a lot of thinking lately.<eos> About...<eos> About you.<eos> About me.
I hear that, but with the cops around Ghost, now how long before they start looking for his kid?<eos> All the questions they gonna be asking, too many ways this shit could play out.<eos> Me? I don't give a fuck.<eos> But you can't afford to get caught.<eos> - Neither of you.
Your suffering is my suffering.<eos> That just kills me.<eos> He's pretty good.<eos> Hold on.<eos> Your, uh, last scene?
But I suppose that is exactly their point, then, isn't it?<eos> "No rest for the wicked."<eos> You don't seem that bad.<eos> Anymore.<eos> At least to me.
Thank God.<eos> I'll go and let her know her dad's still alive.<eos> She'll be thrilled.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Me too.
Moved back to Paterson.<eos> Okay, and did he ever contact you again?<eos> Yeah, he... he sent a letter of apology... to my office.<eos> And it made me nervous, so I called Sergeant Cole.<eos> Sergeant Cole?
I know this is a lot.<eos> If your dad were nervous, if he were gonna hide out somewhere, where would he go?<eos> Come on, man, where would he go?<eos> My uncle's.<eos> Not my blood uncle.
I mean, some animal tries to rape me and I'm able to pull my knife and cut his penis off, damn right I'd tell people.<eos> I can't tell if you're trying to trap me or not.<eos> I'm not.<eos> Yeah, I told some friends.<eos> Who? No way.
If you ever want to become a real cop, James...<eos> Now's the time to start talking.<eos> And who would that be good for? For you guys?<eos> For your clearance record?<eos> What about me?
Not a single person leaves.<eos> You make your decision?<eos> Give me that key.<eos> Back up, everybody back up on the wall.<eos> Back up on the wall.
What happens now?<eos> He says to come back in an hour.<eos> And... do I pay you?<eos> No, the first one's on me, my dear.<eos> Crowded.
Are you planning to wear this in the salon?<eos> What else would I do with it?<eos> Put it in a soup? Oh, and as for the bedding ceremony Might I suggest riding boots and an overcoat.<eos> What's a bedding ceremony?<eos> Exquisite, Madame.
Please.<eos> Good luck.<eos> Ladies, we're being mean. We should welcome her I'll be grateful for small mercies.<eos> She may be German but at least she's not Spanish.<eos> Good afternoon, Your Highness. Good afternoon.
Good night, Sire.<eos> Your mistress will be waiting for you.<eos> No! It is you I need tonight.<eos> When you look at yourselves, what do you see?<eos> Beauty?
But when I look at you, I see corruption, darkness, temptation, greed,<eos> There are two paths open to you.<eos> The path of punishment or the path of redemption.<eos> Redemption through light and through good.<eos> Redemption through purity.
One moment of peace you have with her.<eos> She said, "I was never in peace. I hated".<eos> She said, "I was driven by hate".<eos> Gran?<eos> Not towards you but towards other people.
Your leg okay?<eos> All of a sudden, my knee hurts.<eos> This place freaks me out even worse than school.<eos> What freaks you out about school?<eos> Everything.
Do I feel what others feel?<eos> Dr. Rhodes, one can lack empathy, but still feel compassion.<eos> Sarah...<eos> You liking psychiatry?<eos> Parts of it.
- And I did.<eos> It just took a long time.<eos> If it hadn't been for that S.H.I.E.L.D. scientist ...<eos> Wait, does that mean S.H.I.E.L.D.'s back?<eos> Unfortunately, yes.
- Then what did you do with it?<eos> I gave it to Agent Koenig.<eos> - You gave it back to Billy?<eos> - Negative.<eos> - Then who?
You're lying about something.<eos> I can see it.<eos> Based on what?<eos> My... My clothes?<eos> My accent?
The Bahrain op was a success.<eos> God, you have a sick measure of success.<eos> I'm sorry if she killed an Inhuman child, but if it saved everyone else...<eos> If that girl had been taken down in Bahrain, she wouldn't have gone on to kill all those people in Cambridge.<eos> Thanks to your friend back there,
Well, you failed before.<eos> Never forget how it felt at Cambridge.<eos> Did the Dwarfs record these people?<eos> The footage was sent straight to the Director.<eos> By request.
That's all she gave us.<eos> Beaten to within an inch of her life.<eos> Nevertheless, she persisted.<eos> Let's see if she'll open up to me. You?<eos> Why?
Denser? Not denser.<eos> Deeper.<eos> maybe here.<eos> we need to be ready for anything.<eos> On my mark.
She's not subtle, that Madame Hydra.<eos> Yeah, just look at her uniform.<eos> It's so crazy hot.<eos> I-I mean, if you're into the whole "bad girl" vibe.<eos> Not... not me.
My God.<eos> Who did this?<eos> You did.<eos> To stop him from coming after us.<eos> - Who?
Ah, thanks.<eos> Was that for me?<eos> Thank you.<eos> So are you ready for all of this?<eos> Maternity leave? Yeah.
Is that a good idea?<eos> What do you want me to do, Ted?<eos> Sit around wondering if I'll...<eos> Helen, go home.<eos> Rest...
Did you like him?<eos> Paul?<eos> And don't... don't just say yes cos he's dead.<eos> Did you really like him?<eos> Most of the time.
- Yeah. - Why don't we just zoom in on the serial number?<eos> - "Helping's" good.<eos> - It is good.<eos> - What?<eos> - On the gun.
One more thing...<eos> What happened?<eos> He took the deal.<eos> But you have to stay.<eos> All three of you.
I don't know.<eos> It's been a while.<eos> It might do you some good.<eos> - Me?<eos> - And me.
It's been a while.<eos> It might do you some good.<eos> - Me?<eos> - And me.<eos> Us.
Right.<eos> Well.<eos> Good.<eos> Nice to meet you.<eos> You too.
The boys just kept coming down into the basement.<eos> For hours, it felt like.<eos> I don't know, two, maybe three at a time.<eos> I knew most of them.<eos> From school.
Where are you posted?<eos> Commander Ellis.<eos> He can barely get it up.<eos> Where are you?<eos> Waterford.
Pull my hair like that.<eos> Caleb's your brother.<eos> I'm your mommy.<eos> Beyond the Commander's door is a place where women do not go.<eos> Not even Serena Joy.
In a gradually heating bathtub you'd be boiled to death before you knew it.<eos> Stop.<eos> Jeez.<eos> You want to kill me.<eos> Good for you.
Stop.<eos> Jeez.<eos> You want to kill me.<eos> Good for you.<eos> Good for...
I have given myself over into the hands of strangers.<eos> I have no choice.<eos> It can't be helped.<eos> And so I step up, into the darkness within...<eos> Or else the light.
While you're here, I might as well have a quick look, make sure that everything is in fighting shape for tonight.<eos> This might feel a bit cool.<eos> Just relax.<eos> You're ripe.<eos> Right on schedule.
And rose wasn't the aroma you were emanating.<eos> You're right.<eos> I was emanating awesome.<eos> You really are like me, aren't you?<eos> Unfortunately.
- How? Because you heard me, and you respected my wishes, which means instead of me listening to you as your therapist, you know, I'll be listening to you<eos> - as your... - Not therapist.<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Look at that, even when we cancel, I feel like I'm getting to know you better.<eos> Me too.
But, right, Mike, we can get all the subpoenas in the world, but they're never going to hand over a smoking gun like that.<eos> No, they won't.<eos> But I think you know someone who can get it for us without issuing any subpoena at all.<eos> Ms. cromwell, remember me?<eos> Yes, unfortunately.
We need a plan.<eos> We give him what he wants.<eos> We give up?<eos> That's your plan?<eos> No, not Frost.
How is the boy wonder?<eos> Is he still breathing?<eos> That's sort of why I'm here.<eos> I... want to help you.<eos> And him.
You know we're being stupid.<eos> It's too dangerous.<eos> No, it isn't.<eos> You could end up on the wall.<eos> But at least...
Why is this girl here?<eos> They are friends.<eos> Please.<eos> I don't care what they are. I am not moving.<eos> Putnam.
Straight up.<eos> Cool.<eos> Do you like Reese's Peanut Butter Cups?<eos> Yeah. I do.<eos> Me, too.
Watch this.<eos> You see, Ted?<eos> You enjoying Luxembourg?<eos> Yeah.<eos> For the most part, yeah. Thanks.
I need to take a statement.<eos> No, no, I don't need the fuss.<eos> There was only a couple of quid in me purse.<eos> Madam, I need to report this.<eos> Madam?
All for one, and one for Alpha!<eos> Let me hear some noise!<eos> All for one and one for Alpha!<eos> Try not to say anything or make eye contact with anybody.<eos> Especially the Latinas.
Can I get my drugs now, too?<eos> I wanna not feel this way anymore.<eos> I'm sorry, all right.<eos> You can't cheat grief.<eos> Unfortunately.
Righty-ho, sir.<eos> That policeman is wrong.<eos> Go on.<eos> She wasn't sad about her baby.<eos> Quite the contrary, in fact.
Rhodesia?<eos> I need someone to look after Bunty while I'm away.<eos> Keep her out of trouble.<eos> Rhodesia in...<eos> Africa?
You're gonna get us all home!<eos> I can't.<eos> I don't have my powers on this planet.<eos> But I will help you.<eos> All of you.
- You got me something?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Wow!<eos> For me?<eos> My very own?
It's my wife Martha's recipe.<eos> A little heavy on the rum, but, in these trying times, I believe extra rum is warranted.<eos> Martha...<eos> You're George Washington.<eos> At your service.
You're gonna wait out there?<eos> It's warm by the fire.<eos> It's warmer in the tent.<eos> If you're implying what I think you're implying, you don't think that's a little fast?<eos> Even by your modern standards?
You were just trying to protect me. Yeah.<eos> Just like you're always trying to protect me.<eos> Can we just stop trying to protect each other and go back to being friends?<eos> Because I really miss being friends.<eos> Me, too.
I can handle Mxyzptlk, but it's Mon-El who's infuriating.<eos> He has some grudge against imps.<eos> - Do you think Mon-El's jealous?<eos> - No.<eos> Of Mxyzptlk?
No, I didn't tell you that because it never works!<eos> First of all, it's hard enough to say it forward, and second of all, that guy is a motor-mouth, but he's not stupid.<eos> You should have told me.<eos> You are so hard on me, Kara.<eos> Okay, but why not him?
I know that there are lots of people who don't think that humans and aliens should mix.<eos> If we're being super honest, potentially falling for an alien is not what scares me.<eos> It's falling for anyone.<eos> Just have kind of had my heart trampled on a few times.<eos> Me, too.
I guess I did too good a job enhancing Henshaw, 'cause Cadmus wanted me to stick around, help 'em with other projects.<eos> In the beginning, I tried to escape again and again.<eos> But, well, let's just say they didn't appreciate that very much.<eos> Oh, Dad.<eos> I...
He also lived with your enemy for years.<eos> They... They forced him to keep Henshaw alive.<eos> What makes you think that they're not forcing Jeremiah to do something now?<eos> I know you're just trying to look out for us.<eos> - For me. - Mmm-hmm.
I didn't think we were meeting until a little later.<eos> Hey you.<eos> Yeah, I'm just catching up my friend, Mon-El.<eos> Pleasure to meet you.<eos> And you.
Anything happens to that bomb before you disarm it, the whole city could go.<eos> Nothing's gonna happen.<eos> Let's stop them once and for all, girls.<eos> Ready when you are, J'onn.<eos> On my mark.
If you do it...<eos> I'll understand.<eos> You are always the best part of me.<eos> No, the green wire attaches to the other green wire.<eos> No, the other green...
We've arrived.<eos> Wow! We're six seasons in and winter still hasn't come!<eos> You know, since you got fired from CatCo, your queue has gone down exponentially.<eos> Yes, well, I am fully embracing my funemployment.<eos> Funemployment.
- It's a start. - Let's go catch a thief.<eos> Yes, super friends back in the habit.<eos> - Hmm, Kara?<eos> - Sorry, sorry. - That's too much.<eos> - Mmm-hmm.
Okay, what's it gonna cost us?<eos> Hamilton tickets.<eos> Orchestra.<eos> Okay, well, we're screwed.<eos> Deal.
I'm much too dangerous.<eos> Just focus and try to fight it.<eos> I can't!<eos> Oh, no. I'm so sorry.<eos> Me too.
And I'm sorry I forced you to talk to your mom.<eos> I should have listened to you.<eos> - I was wrong. - No.<eos> You believe that people can change and you gave them a chance to do it.<eos> Like my father.
We used to be so in sync, you and I.<eos> The day we took our vows, we promised to stand by each other's side.<eos> We looked out on those that we loved most and we made a commitment.<eos> To our marriage but, more importantly,<eos> our family.
Not quite.<eos> My cybernetic core has been enhanced.<eos> I can interface with the onboard Daxamite computer system.<eos> We'll pass through undetected.<eos> Cool.
Don't touch them!<eos> Ema!<eos> Angel, we have class now.<eos> Where did he go?<eos> With his friend.
Clara.<eos> Clara, do you have any explanation regarding a certain... precociousness in the kids?<eos> What do you refer to?<eos> They seem... mature regarding certain themes.<eos> At a sexual level.
You saw them.<eos> They're nowhere.<eos> If Detective John Cardinal had the first clue about us, he would have knocked down our door already.<eos> Do you think he liked being on TV?<eos> What, the detective?
You need to see a doctor.<eos> I did.<eos> He said I'm fine.<eos> You should go home.<eos> Rest.
All right.<eos> Where is she?<eos> When is she?<eos> You're gonna want to brush up on your French.<eos> Madame!
Where is she?<eos> When is she?<eos> You're gonna want to brush up on your French.<eos> Madame!<eos> Madame!
So I think you need to get me that.<eos> John, you have a second?<eos> Um... Concerning?<eos> I'm in Human Resources, and we take that seriously here at McMillan.<eos> The human part.
- The what?<eos> - Your System Vehicle Permission Statement?<eos> I was told I just needed my current license.<eos> - Who told you that, honey?<eos> - Guy on the phone.
Uh... What was it? Emissions?<eos> Emissions Systems Standard form application.<eos> I feel like you called it five different things.<eos> Get out of my face.<eos> - Guy on the phone.
- That's way too low.<eos> - No, no, no.<eos> You pay me to train.<eos> - To train? - Mmm-hmm.<eos> In what?
Courtney's going to a science camp this summer that cost more than my dad makes in three months.<eos> How could I ever compete?<eos> I'll see ya, Miss Fowler.<eos> I don't know, you guys. I just think that we should have a little bit of fun with him, you know, like, torture him.<eos> One by one.
Nah, just transfer it to the table. What?<eos> In fact, we'll do one more round?<eos> And then we'll switch over to the pinot.<eos> - Who's drinking wine?<eos> - Uh-huh.
Hey, Chicago.<eos> Sorry?<eos> This is the executive parking section.<eos> For executives.<eos> F.Y.I., Chicago.
A wall, a real, honest wall, not made of tiny robots but made of any old iron.<eos> Every spacecraft needs... a door.<eos> Not even locked.<eos> They were expecting to live in peace.<eos> Wicked.
That's the boy.<eos> The first to wake up.<eos> Where did you get this?<eos> I'd think it's his mother's, don't you?<eos> Or his nan's.
By spring, this will be a footnote in history.<eos> That is progress.<eos> They're bringing the elephant out presently.<eos> We won't get bigger crowds than that, so make sure you're off the ice by noon.<eos> Noon?
But you're not their mother.<eos> Look.<eos> They just don't know you like I know you, and they just need a little bit of time.<eos> That's all.<eos> Me, too.
It was thought to be lost in the sands of time.<eos> - You just discovered the map.<eos> This is most exciting find in my incredible life.<eos> - Where does the map lead?<eos> - To an adventure.
- Have you got a name?<eos> - No.<eos> But I know where he works.<eos> Er, Lexi and Jo on the back wall.<eos> On the back wall!
Your son's been lying for you.<eos> You can't leave him like that, Alan, knowing you killed the lad he loved.<eos> You need to tell the truth, Alan.<eos> Not to me.<eos> To your boy.
Sure.<eos> - Next. - Come on down.<eos> So. I have this video that's unclear, and I heard, from a friend, that you could improve the picture.<eos> Like they do on the shows.<eos> The shows?
Is s... Is someone in there?<eos> I wish you'd told me how you felt sooner, Eugene.<eos> I kind of already promised myself to someone else.<eos> What?<eos> Who?
Nope.<eos> Some good stuff here.<eos> Maybe.<eos> You know, Denis is feeling better.<eos> Denis?
Some good stuff here.<eos> Maybe.<eos> You know, Denis is feeling better.<eos> Denis?<eos> Yeah, Denis.
- You hit Linda with a shovel?<eos> - Yes.<eos> And where did you hit her first?<eos> What part of her body?<eos> Her legs.
What part of her body?<eos> Her legs.<eos> You knocked her down, and then?<eos> Head.<eos> Her head.
My client needs a break.<eos> Your client needs a fucking lawyer.<eos> You knocked her down and then...?<eos> Head.<eos> Her head.
- No, I did not.<eos> You hit Linda with a shovel.<eos> What part of her body?<eos> She's showing Kevin what to say...<eos> - Her head.
Tell Yusef, when I see him, I'll give it to him.<eos> No.<eos> We need it now.<eos> I'll give it to my client.<eos> No-one else.
What happened?<eos> What did I do?<eos> Detective Greenwood, she was so certain.<eos> She started saying that she didn't need me to confess because she had all the evidence but that it would go better for me in court if I told the truth.<eos> Then at least...
- Sorry...<eos> - What was that?<eos> It's all right.<eos> I do apologise.<eos> Sorry about that.
I know that Linda lived near to the airbase where you were stationed.<eos> And I know you were transferred off that airbase 24 hours after she went missing.<eos> I know you know exactly who she is.<eos> Do you think I'd hurt that girl?<eos> Or any girl?
Come on.<eos> Trust me.'<eos> Why did you believe he didn't do it?<eos> It was more that I didn't trust the other side.<eos> At first, anyway.
The surveillance footage from Truth nightclub from the night of Greg's murder until the arrest of Mr. St. Patrick doesn't show him or anyone else placing the murder weapon in the location that it was found.<eos> It is clearly exculpatory.<eos> Clearly.<eos> And to whom did you report this information about the surveillance video?<eos> Mike Sandoval.
I went to pick up Tariq from his sleepover, and he wasn't there.<eos> Calvin said something about some girl?<eos> He left his house to go see a girl. Yeah, he called me.<eos> He called you?<eos> Why you?
Look, I don't know how to be any more clear.<eos> And whether I like it or not, we are in this shit together.<eos> This whole rolling up unannounced stuff, it's more of a Tommy thing.<eos> Man, I don't know who to trust.<eos> Still me.
He's being remanded to the MCC tonight, where he'll be held until his transfer to protective custody.<eos> So James really was innocent?<eos> He really was.<eos> I'll give him the good news.<eos> And Proctor too.
Poo!<eos> Poo!<eos> Poo!<eos> - Order in the court!<eos> Order in the court!
Those suck.<eos> - All right.<eos> - They suck.<eos> Uh, well, listen, you stay hydrated, you hear?<eos> Your mama, too.
You want out?<eos> You're gonna have to help end this thing.<eos> So, ladies, let me ask you:<eos> What do you think inspired this sudden movement for change inside Litchfield?<eos> Movement?
Come on, for real.<eos> If this is gonna go on for a few more days, you girls got to get some rest.<eos> The human body... um, starts shutting down after 31 hours without sleep, did you know that?<eos> No way.<eos> Like what?
It's always candy with you, huh?<eos> "My caramel swirl." "My mocha chip."<eos> No.<eos> No, I wasn't...<eos> I...
- Suzanne.<eos> Come on.<eos> Come on.<eos> I'm gonna take him to see the Wizard.<eos> Or a witch.
Come on.<eos> Come on.<eos> I'm gonna take him to see the Wizard.<eos> Or a witch.<eos> Or a doctor.
Come on.<eos> I'm gonna take him to see the Wizard.<eos> Or a witch.<eos> Or a doctor.<eos> Or a witch doctor.
Yo, what the fuck is this?<eos> They needed a piss break.<eos> And I couldn't say no.<eos> One of them already peed on themself.<eos> Fuck no!
Now it's, "Fuck you, inmate.<eos> I'mma fuckin' ruin your life just because I can."<eos> It's like human niceness has just gone renegade, and I don't think it's coming back anytime soon.<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> - Yeah, me too.
He's single.<eos> Have a nice day.<eos> Oh.<eos> Yeah.<eos> You, too.
And... love is pain.<eos> Merde.<eos> See?<eos> I win.<eos> Another drink?
She must be involved in some way.<eos> Found a bunch of abusive letters, sir.<eos> All ready to be posted...<eos> To who?<eos> Well anyone and everyone.
Trenches of the French army, the second battle of the Ipre<eos> For the true hero.<eos> English newspapers call the gas of Captain Haber "a cloud of death."<eos> The enemy will soon surrender.<eos> Thanks to our venerable master.
Your name will be in all the newspapers on the globe, you will be famous!<eos> Do not be stupid.<eos> I'm a scientist!<eos> They will want an interview, they want to know about your life, about your family.<eos> About me.
Your duty as a Nobel committee is to notice this difference.<eos> The award will be presented to Max Planck.<eos> You always lamented that the Nobel Committee had underestimated him for so many years.<eos> Fritz will also receive a prize.<eos> In chemistry.
I have not been the best of Jews.<eos> Before today, I had not set foot in a synagogue in years.<eos> But now, I've come to believe a university that celebrates our heritage is essential to the future of our youth.<eos> Today, I am here with you to celebrate our Jewish heritage as special and of value.<eos> Unique.
I want a girl who's real."<eos> So, I bring you in so they can see that they don't actually want the thing they think they want.<eos> Look...<eos> I do cast some experimental projects on the side, if you are open to that kind of thing.<eos> - What kind of thing?
- Maybe if I do this?<eos> - That's good.<eos> - Whoo!<eos> Did I tell you the casting director offered me porn?<eos> Uh... you?
For each action there is an equal and opposite reaction.<eos> Nuclear weapons are the obstacle to world peace, not its solution.<eos> But they exist.<eos> Well, I think the best way to ensure they're never used is to give control of them to the scientists who made them.<eos> Not the American military.
Thank God for that.<eos> What is it?<eos> Thank you.<eos> I'm sorry for your loss, my boy.<eos> My loss?
Pretend.<eos> She can't go with you to Gold Coast.<eos> She has to work, have to fuck with customer.<eos> - She has to pay back a lot of money.<eos> - To who?
Okay.<eos> Are you gonna make a campaign contribution or what?<eos> You know what?<eos> I am. Getting paid, getting laid, son.<eos> Congressman Jonah Ryan.
It's just through there.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Yep.<eos> Luna, I'm sorry about Nyko.<eos> Me, too.
Maybe it'll help.<eos> You know when you're holding your breath and there's that... unbearable feeling right before you relent and take a gulp of air?<eos> Well, imagine that feeling lasting for a week.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Yeah, well, me, too.
None of this is interesting to any of us.<eos> The point is I would say 20 extra minutes, one time offer, take it or leave it.<eos> 30.<eos> Fine.<eos> Deal.
But I do, as its Royal Ambassador, have access to its guards and its dungeons.<eos> And I'll use A to throw you in B, but help me, and I'll let you go free.<eos> I don't believe you.<eos> Your loyalty will always lie with--<eos> With me.
I've been like this for six centuries.<eos> The things that I know now you cannot imagine.<eos> That's what I want.<eos> Please, can I go with you?<eos> You?
But you already knew that.<eos> My father is very impressed. At how quickly you've picked it up.<eos> He's never met someone who can remember. More about a particular engine than he can.<eos> I've always liked trains.<eos> Him too.
- No.<eos> I guess you stopped doing that after Cheryl complained so much about her food being stolen that HR installed a kitchen security cam.<eos> The one that caught you in flagrante yogurt-o.<eos> That all started when I ate one string-cheese of Cheryl's a couple of years ago.<eos> Honest mistake.
Also, I was thinking we should have our honeymoon in my home in Corfu.<eos> Would you like that?<eos> Sounds lovely, darling.<eos> It used to belong to a little Frenchman.<eos> Napoleon.
WOMAN: All rise.<eos> Tell him I love him.<eos> Course I will.<eos> Thank you. Thanks.<eos> And you.
You're angry with me.<eos> As I am with myself.<eos> We were so close...<eos> I do not wish to hear how close you were!<eos> So close to peace.
I thought you wanted him as dead as I do.<eos> Of course I did.<eos> I do.<eos> But would you kill a man so easily?<eos> A murderer.
They say Henry is cursed by God.<eos> He brought the sweating sickness.<eos> Has anybody sent help out to the people?<eos> Some of your soldiers are changing sides.<eos> To who?
So I say you go up there, and you do what you got to do.<eos> Cut off the gangrenous parts.<eos> And then we go in with charter schools and outrage, for about $30 million. We capture the tax write-off, and those kids will be better off than their parents, or we, ever were.<eos> Before we go out, can you order pizza for the kids?<eos> Chinese tonight.
No!<eos> No, I...<eos> God, strewth.<eos> He's going surely now!<eos> Jesus!
Sadly, at this point, Jeremy thought of something to say.<eos> See that?<eos> That's the prison where Hitler wrote Mein Kampf.<eos> Yeah. Where are you going with that?<eos> Nowhere, really.
Uh, teach me something?<eos> Teach me something that I would never know in a million years.<eos> Well, I've just discovered that one of the antimatter...<eos> No.<eos> No science.
Bringing a weapon on board this station is a violation of galactic charter.<eos> So is android theft.<eos> No, we didn't steal Anya.<eos> She joined us of her own free will.<eos> Free will?
Are you alone?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, it's just me.<eos> I'm sorry we didn't have more time to get to know each other.<eos> Me, too.
Do you renounce your actions against the throne?<eos> No, I do not.<eos> I am, and have always been, loyal to Zairon's rightful ruler and his father before him.<eos> Not a... duplicitous Empress, not a pretender to the throne.<eos> Now and forever, only Emperor Ishida Ryo.
Four.<eos> Or should I call you Emperor Ryo Ishida?<eos> Just Ryo would be fine.<eos> What do you want?<eos> Straight to the point.
What's that?<eos> Another ship just dropped out of FTL,<eos> - and it's opened fire.<eos> - On the Ferrous Corp ship?<eos> On the nuke.
Torrent downloaded from RARBG<eos> What do you say we find ourselves a nice fat, juicy target and see what these babies can do?<eos> No. Priority number one is finding a buyer.<eos> We'll keep one crate and sell the rest.<eos> [Tash] To who?
Restart simulation.<eos> Simulation restarting.<eos> Don't you ever sleep?<eos> Everyone needs rest, Clarke.<eos> Even saviors.
Your friend, the one who did the study on spontaneous human combustion.<eos> Nothing.<eos> Nothing magicky, just that it usually occurs with people with limited mobility, advanced age, obesity, poor health...<eos> - None of which fit our victims.<eos> - Victims?
Nothing.<eos> Nothing magicky, just that it usually occurs with people with limited mobility, advanced age, obesity, poor health...<eos> - None of which fit our victims.<eos> - Victims?<eos> Victims?
I mean, I admit that I sometimes miss the outside world.<eos> But this place, it's protected.<eos> It's our home, like your Library protects you.<eos> You're gonna miss it, aren't you?<eos> The Library?
But this place, it's protected.<eos> It's our home, like your Library protects you.<eos> You're gonna miss it, aren't you?<eos> The Library?<eos> Your friends?
Mama wanted us to deny all that, to stay here and meditate on the same lawn, smiling every day, helping these people.<eos> This Librarian doesn't understand.<eos> I did this for us, Estrella.<eos> Don't you miss it?<eos> The world?
That thing ain't got a vac suit on.<eos> Suit up.<eos> We're going on a hunt.<eos> Everything I did, I did out of love.<eos> For Earth. For our people.
Move!<eos> So where's the old lady?<eos> I was told...<eos> It's Madam Undersecretary to you.<eos> Or just Madam.
might not fly on a movie set.<eos> Hey!<eos> I got words.<eos> I was thinking something along the lines of,<eos> "Howdy, Dude-y."
In case you missed it, I'm the boss.<eos> See, 'cause he's the boss, so he was telling himself.<eos> It's too many levels for her.<eos> Hey, um, listen, I should probably get going, but if you need anything else, you can call me.<eos> Or my boss.
Sometimes, you play the goban. Sometimes, you look across the board and you see a total lack of kiai.<eos> I know none of those words. But I feel like you're calling Lawrence Boyd a butter boy.<eos> A guilty man took a guilty plea.<eos> Closer than ever to your goal, Bryan.<eos> Which one?
I didn't recognize you with your little hat.<eos> I'm...<eos> I'm so sorry for your loss.<eos> Oh, well, I have a dozen uncles.<eos> - One less, more for the rest, right?
- Oh, my.<eos> Tom James, who is telling us about the explosive revelations in his book "Investing with a Conscience," excerpted in this month's "Vanity Fair."<eos> "Vanity Fair?" Mike, how did we not know about this?<eos> They called me a couple months ago and I thought they were trying to get me to renew my prescription.<eos> Subscription!
What do you think?<eos> yes!<eos> A funeral ceremony!<eos> - And who is buried?<eos> - Bride!
May I trouble you for another?<eos> It must be difficult with no other family here.<eos> Stiff upper lip.<eos> That's what you British say, isn't it?<eos> Not always for the best.
That... that's my other sister, Chrissy.<eos> She doesn't come out of her room these days.<eos> - She's still in mourning.<eos> - Oh, over your dad?<eos> Over Jessica.
I like it.<eos> I'm gonna like it even more when it's on the floor tonight.<eos> Is that one still breathing?<eos> All right, Ma, I'm going to karate.<eos> Karate?
And I'm closing the diner Sunday.<eos> Well, we had a good run.<eos> No, we didn't.<eos> Let's scavenge, people!<eos> Bye, y'all!
Well, I did think it was odd that he lived alone.<eos> We're taking Barbara bowling.<eos> Between the flashing lights and the fist fights, nothing's more stimulating for a baby's brain than a bowling alley.<eos> How about a book?<eos> On bowling?
The fuhrer is rumored. To make an appearance.<eos> Security will be impenetrable.<eos> Good thing I have someone on the inside.<eos> There's nothing I can do. To get you in.<eos> Invitation only.
On my way back, nursing my pain, I stopped in at a roadhouse that still served grain alcohol.<eos> That's the last thing I remember.<eos> Woke up here with a knot on my head just like you.<eos> I'm sorry to hear that, friend, but...<eos> I just...
- Supplies?<eos> - Maybe.<eos> 24 hours, I'll take care of your brother.<eos> But you give me food and gear so I can set off on my own in exchange.<eos> Deal?
- To Emily.<eos> This just in:<eos> Gotham City police report the Joker has been apprehended.<eos> Batman used a new device that tracked him by his smell.<eos> And now for a correction...
Yeah, that's right.<eos> Hey, Kenny.<eos> You're a life-saver.<eos> Ha. What do you want me to do with Uniform?<eos> Uniform?
There's one.<eos> Parks up in his car, never comes in.<eos> Still there sometimes after closing.<eos> - Did you clock what sort of car?<eos> - Nothing flash.
You were expecting someone else?<eos> - I... - I won't take it personally.<eos> You had a rough couple days.<eos> We were both relieved when your fever finally broke last night.<eos> - Both?
- anything...<eos> - I want to know what you think.<eos> I am a loyal person.<eos> I just didn't know which loyalty.<eos> To me or the flag.
Let me help you.<eos> - Hey. Your self-help guru just fired me.<eos> Guess that means I'm not getting my money back.<eos> Kidding.<eos> Her loss.
It's not even going to happen, so what are you worrying about?<eos> You know your mantra about your past being behind you, so let it go?<eos> Yeah.<eos> It's helping a lot of people.<eos> What about you?
Well, just the deceitful spirit I didn't want to see.<eos> I hear the Board has been called in to investigate you.<eos> Yes.<eos> No thanks to you.<eos> To me?
What's the matter?<eos> My chili's gone.<eos> About why you didn't want to operate earlier.<eos> Who did you make a promise to that you wouldn't do pediatric surgeries anymore?<eos> Oh. Myself.
When I was in med school, I spent a summer at an orphanage in Sudan.<eos> The place was even more awful than you can imagine.<eos> Understaffed, undersupplied.<eos> Do you know what I heard the first day I walked into the infant ward?<eos> Silence.
They're unarmed.<eos> It's a shipping truck.<eos> They think they're carrying cleaning supplies.<eos> Who are they delivering to?<eos> North African extremists.
This isn't you.<eos> You dick around with pharmaceutical prices, not war!<eos> Business is business, and thanks to my recent acquisition of Riley motors, business just got very, very good.<eos> - Zach sold to you?<eos> - And a few other members.
Why the hell would you guys do that?<eos> Long story.<eos> Things are... a little complicated up there.<eos> You take it easy, all right?<eos> Jesus!
The point is I don't know what we are. Okay?<eos> That's the truth.<eos> I don't know what I think we are.<eos> I just know that I like the fact that there's a "we" for us to talk about.<eos> Me, too.
Let's come in, rehearse the play, get out.<eos> Okay.<eos> - Great. - Great.<eos> Still really, you know, feel like you would've loved my movie recommendation, so...<eos> Your loss.
- Anyway, listen, call me.<eos> - Kevin?<eos> Uh, I know things have been weird between us, but I just wanted to say break a leg.<eos> Thank you, thank you.<eos> You too.
You are a sick old man and sick old men need nurses, William, to make sure they take their meds on time... and eat their meals on time... and don't die when nobody's looking.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I didn't mean that.<eos> I just...
I've been living with white people for a long time.<eos> Oh, my God, you're in trouble now, son.<eos> - Think you should have a taste.<eos> - Think I should.<eos> - For old times.
It was thanks to Roz Huntley's diligence we detected Ifield's involvement in one of the prostitute murders.<eos> I'd say she's earned a second chance.<eos> And my team is intent to give Michael Farmer a second chance.<eos> And we shall see which one of us is right, sir, when we have access to all the evidence.<eos> All.
'Since your previous interview, 'we've uncovered some new evidence we'd like to put to you.'<eos> For the DIR, I'm showing Ms Reznikova item reference JHF-9, showing a DIY store car park and a figure wearing a balaclava.<eos> Yes. He looks like the man who attacked me.<eos> According to your witness statement, on the evening of the 9th of March, you were set upon by a man wearing a balaclava who forced you into his vehicle and transported you to an address on the Borogrove Estate belonging to Michael Farmer.<eos> Yes, Michael Farmer.
No, no. That is not what we are talking about here, Detective Chief Inspector Huntley, as well you know.<eos> We're not mind readers.<eos> We don't know whether Michael Farmer is guilty or not.<eos> All that's expected of us as police officers is that we do our duty to the letter of the law.<eos> The letter.
- OK.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> - What's up?<eos> - I heard we didn't find any foreign DNA on Leonie Collersdale's body.<eos> Pisser.
And every minute I wanted to bang on that door and catch the pair of you at it.<eos> But I didn't.<eos> I gave up and I came here, I came home.<eos> To our house.<eos> To our kids.
We know that.<eos> - Come on, Dot.<eos> - Told. - "Told".<eos> You told someone?<eos> Someone very senior?
That was incredibly brave and honest of you, ma'am.<eos> I've got no idea how this can be happening to me.<eos> It was Roz.<eos> She's lying about everything.<eos> Everything.
- We sell canned foods, so...<eos> Anything canned under the sun.<eos> That was almost the Howard Foods slogan.<eos> My idea. I liked it.<eos> Mother, not so much.
- Yeah, but would other people know that?<eos> - Like who?<eos> My son.<eos> - He goes to Stanford.<eos> - Fancy.
Get a life, you fucking hags!<eos> How does everyone know my fucking real name?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> - What are you doing?<eos> - My hair.
Um, they took everything, except my glasses.<eos> I don't think they wanted me to give chase, as it were.<eos> But I think that I should file a report.<eos> Or something.<eos> To whomever.
- Welcome.<eos> - Can I have one too?<eos> - Oh, yeah, sure.<eos> Arthie, no one wants that.<eos> - Me three.
I did a version of Peter Pan where we couldn't afford a flying rig, so two stage hands carried me around for three hours.<eos> - How much do we need?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> $9,000.<eos> - What the fuck?
Who is?<eos> My... Me.<eos> My name is Emma.<eos> I don't need to be rescued.<eos> Well, not anymore, thanks to Captain Hook, at your service.
Wait!<eos> You don't have to do this.<eos> It's okay. I'm not gonna let him hurt anyone.<eos> I'm not going to hurt them...<eos> just you.
In "Orange," they strip-search.<eos> I am not getting strip-searched. Arizona...<eos> Bailey, you are not getting strip-searched.<eos> Sir...<eos> Against the wall.
Are you a doctor?<eos> I need help.<eos> Yes, you!<eos> Help!<eos> Well, hell.
Because it's the best piece.<eos> And it's the shiniest.<eos> There's nothing shiny in that box.<eos> It's been here since '78.<eos> Yeah, just like every other game in this place.
It's the good samaritan special.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> - Just looking out for you.<eos> You know, I, uh... I take my duties very seriously.<eos> - Your duties?
Melanie thinks you're the key.<eos> What?<eos> The key to what?<eos> Winning the war.<eos> And other things.
You know how loud the heartbeat is?<eos> Imagine you could remember being inside your mother's body, warm and blind, and then just this intense pressure, and suddenly...<eos> Light.<eos> Tell me about the book.<eos> What book?
No.<eos> It's a lie.<eos> Surely, brother?<eos> I am loyal... To the rightful king!<eos> Richard of York!
God makes you sick as punishment for your lies.<eos> Proof of treachery from their own hands.<eos> Sir William Stanley.<eos> I am loyal to the rightful king!<eos> Richard of York!
The daughter of Edward IV and Queen Elizabeth Woodville,<eos> who has just passed from this life into God's hands.<eos> Your men are here and they support you.<eos> When this battle is over you will live in peace with your families knowing that you have done your duty to your King, your God,<eos> and to your Queen.
When this battle is over you will live in peace with your families knowing that you have done your duty to your King, your God,<eos> and to your Queen.<eos> How can I thank you?<eos> Come back to me.<eos> To us.
Yes, come on.<eos> David.<eos> All right, tough girl, this will...<eos> I met your husband.<eos> Careful.
Who are you, really?<eos> I'm you.<eos> I'm me.<eos> Please.<eos> The truth.
Be honest.<eos> You miss him.<eos> Every day.<eos> And so you came up with this...<eos> Idea.
Well, that sounds wonderful!<eos> Extra Special Family Fun Appetizer for an extra special family.<eos> Mine.<eos> I'll just have a glass of water, thank you.<eos> Same for me.
Cheer up.<eos> I'm sure that if you look on the bright side...<eos> Look on your right side!<eos> Get out of the way!<eos> Uh oh?
Hey. Hey, wait. Hey!<eos> That's it.<eos> Oh, excuse me.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> - Cheese. - Oh!
He's not here, is he?<eos> The man.<eos> Only the child.<eos> But soon, the Witness will return to Titan and lead the faithful to salvation.<eos> The Red Forest.
Cole... if Ramse had killed me before you and I met, no Witness, no plague.<eos> No.<eos> This is our problem. We'll figure it out.<eos> Until then, no one can know.<eos> No one.
Sun's down.<eos> Blind as a bat.<eos> Who'd you say this belonged to?<eos> - Bugsy Seagal.<eos> - Siegel.
Blind as a bat.<eos> Who'd you say this belonged to?<eos> - Bugsy Seagal.<eos> - Siegel.<eos> Mobster, bootlegger, criminal visionary.
Ghosts aren't real.<eos> Do I have to come down there and get the damn thing myself?<eos> And sold...<eos> - Yes!<eos> - ... again to bidder 337.
- Another goddamn loop.<eos> - I don't know.<eos> We'll find out in '61.<eos> Good luck.<eos> Good luck.
A funny sod, you are.<eos> You know, if you're so learned in medicine, why don't you help me in the hospital?<eos> Be of some use to others?<eos> Alas, my travels keep me suitably useless.<eos> To none but yourself.
No, but he said it's for my own good.<eos> Hmm. That's a good sign.<eos> He wants to protect you from it.<eos> Which means he is starting to develop feelings for me.<eos> For Jane.
You don't know who you're stealing from!<eos> Bill, who are these people?<eos> - Ready? - For what?<eos> - To fly!<eos> - Oh, my God, Bill!
How'd you do?<eos> I shot Janine.<eos> Good morning, Helene.<eos> Did you get any sleep?<eos> Me neither.
How is your headache?<eos> It went away, but now it's back.<eos> Listen, before you do anything you might regret...<eos> Three vodkas, please.<eos> Yes, madame.
- Don't touch me.<eos> - Get off.<eos> She didn't know about the drugs?<eos> Unhand the reptile, Space Captain.<eos> Aw, hey, now.
Intelligence speeds the war, saves lives.<eos> We don't disagree. "We"?<eos> The brigadefuhrer and i.<eos> Who has your loyalty?<eos> Faber or your superiors?
To kill him.<eos> There was a syringe with a lethal fluid hidden.<eos> In the painting. I came to see who would retrieve it.<eos> She's been deceiving you, me,<eos> Sabine.
To stop me, you're gonna have to kill me.<eos> Come on, Bellamy.<eos> It doesn't have to be like this.<eos> Whose crazy idea was it to turn an Iva suit into an Eva suit?<eos> Yours.
As I mentioned, Senator Diaz made a campaign promise that I intend to hold him to.<eos> You what, uh, bribe them?<eos> I've been known to make the occasional charitable contribution.<eos> In exchange, my back is scratched by the good men in blue.<eos> Yours, not so much.
Raymond or whatever he's called.<eos> I think Katherine was trying to get back into his affections.<eos> Then they tailed off, and other notes were going back and forth.<eos> Other notes?<eos> To whom?
We demand justice!<eos> Set Katherine free!<eos> We demand justice!<eos> Set Katherine free...<eos> Her?
That's very good of you.<eos> About what I saw the other night.<eos> You and Ada.<eos> You know I won't tell anyone, right?<eos> Not even Mr Cartwright.
When I heard about those poor little mites suffering from polio, I thought, what a fantastic opportunity for me to clear out my wardrobe.<eos> Well, thank you very much for your donation, Penelope.<eos> Now, there's something I have to say.<eos> My goddaughter Joselyn is staying here for a few days and I do not want her subjected to your bad influence.<eos> Bad influence?
They are good, kind people.<eos> They try to control everything I do.<eos> They want me to be someone I'm not!<eos> Oh, so you told them you were attending secretarial classes when, in fact, you were getting yourself a job showing your bits to...<eos> lecherous drunkards?
Helena, you okay?<eos> Not her.<eos> Not like this.<eos> I need you to see how far dilated she is, Detective.<eos> Jesus.
Got something afoot, Felix?<eos> Colin, I've told you that you've got to stop being so perceptive.<eos> Remember?<eos> I'm expecting someone.<eos> - On the down low.
- No.<eos> - Yeah, no it's true.<eos> I, um...<eos> I had to take them away.<eos> Christ, serious?
Right here in the city, we have an epidemic of homelessness. Of homelessness.<eos> Now, some of that is connected to mental illness, but an awful lot of it is simply lack of access to things the rest of us take for granted.<eos> Thank God.<eos> I was dying for a drink.<eos> Me too.
I mean, it was a religious, community.<eos> It wasn't wasn't that weird. .<eos> Well, the girls at the salon told me that there was this group that if you disobeyed their leader, he'd make you lick the floor with your tongue.<eos> So, I mean, it's no wonder you'd get a little...<eos> A little what?
What the hell, Alex?<eos> You can't call?<eos> You can't text?<eos> What happened?<eos> For other people, not so much.
I'm so glad you're in town.<eos> Well, anyone could repair a ruptured bladder.<eos> Well, yeah, absolutely, but, um, it's just the hospital...<eos> Are you here to put a halt to this stuff?<eos> A halt to what stuff?
Well, I don't blame her.<eos> It was outrageous.<eos> You think it was the right call?<eos> I think Bailey had to send a clear message.<eos> To me.
It was outrageous.<eos> You think it was the right call?<eos> I think Bailey had to send a clear message.<eos> To me.<eos> About me.
- Okay.<eos> Her vitals look good.<eos> How are you feeling, Lynne?<eos> Any pain?<eos> Lots, thanks to you.
Every good surgeon does.<eos> It might be your worst, but... it won't be your last.<eos> What was his name?<eos> Matty.<eos> Matty.
It might be your worst, but... it won't be your last.<eos> What was his name?<eos> Matty.<eos> Matty.<eos> Matty.
Do you want to be married to me?<eos> Yes.<eos> Then why won't you talk to me?<eos> I'm not ready.<eos> For what?
Yes.<eos> Then why won't you talk to me?<eos> I'm not ready.<eos> For what?<eos> The fight.
- Maggie...<eos> - Nobody tells me what to think.<eos> Okay, good, 'cause I don't want their opinion, okay?<eos> I care about what you think.<eos> About you?
It's supposed to hit the power grid tonight?<eos> Yes, around 7:00.<eos> Okay.<eos> Tell her I'll get back to her.<eos> "Her"?
You do realize you made a joke about school shootings?<eos> Yes, but I didn't commit a school shooting, no matter how annoying my gender studies professors were.<eos> There was nothing in those contracts about what I can say and what I can't.<eos> All right, let's move on to the next issue.<eos> My issue.
Who is that?<eos> My new assistant.<eos> You want me to recuse myself?<eos> Yes, Your Honor.<eos> Regretfully.
Well, the company would rather settle these things internally.<eos> And I'd rather you call me "Mr. Diyardian."<eos> My apologies.<eos> And Mr. Gwinn stole this $70,000, according to your interrogation?<eos> My interview.
And I'd rather you call me "Mr. Diyardian."<eos> My apologies.<eos> And Mr. Gwinn stole this $70,000, according to your interrogation?<eos> My interview.<eos> Right, your interview.
It's just that I know Marissa, and she's on the ball.<eos> She's good.<eos> You'll see.<eos> Okay. This is our offer.<eos> $500,000 to Frank Gwinn.
Unless the plaintiff has anything more, I will rule on this motion.<eos> I hate losing.<eos> It was a good effort.<eos> Does this impact the class?<eos> Yes, unfortunately.
You're a clown.<eos> What's worse is you're a smart clown who occasionally has a point, a point you destroy by mixing it up with racism and misogyny you probably don't even believe.<eos> When you were little, someone rejected you or made fun of you, and now you get to be one of the mean guys, making fun of others.<eos> And you get to be the principal?<eos> Outraged?
Tell me what you want!<eos> The truth.<eos> You should be spending that on your family.<eos> How old is your boy now?<eos> David?
What've we got here, then?<eos> A pale wee man?<eos> Surrounded by the king's gold.<eos> The winds of fortune are flying today, lads.<eos> For both of us.
Oh, do you deny being seen around town with a Zabar's bag, eating bagels and whitefish and homos.<eos> It's pronounced "hummus."<eos> And I only ship in food because the mushy rings of white bread that they call bagels down here are a joke.<eos> Witch!<eos> Order!
He is with his step-mom now, so... So maybe... maybe he's not hiding something from me, but someone.<eos> Someone who knew Chet.<eos> And someone I still don't trust.<eos> What have you been doing?<eos> Oh... this and that.
So we're gonna take a mulligan here.<eos> Just as in your military unit, the NYPD... takes care of its own.<eos> So, I'm gonna give each of you the chance to thoroughly explain why you feel you are fit... for this duty.<eos> Face-to-face.<eos> Retail.
She's terrified.<eos> And determined.<eos> Cobalt.<eos> Cassiterite.<eos> Wolframite.
- Right, but maybe you should speak to my colleague first.<eos> - Hi.<eos> - I got hit by a bus.<eos> - Wow. - This place looks amazing.<eos> - Yes, thanks to Gina.
Inside a womb inside a woman... yeah, it's like a nesting doll.<eos> It's like nesting dolls.<eos> It's fascinating.<eos> Why are you here?<eos> Uh, yeah. Same.
She's over there.<eos> Did you see?<eos> Yep.<eos> What's the matter?<eos> Crowd not big enough?
I can't. I, uh...<eos> I just have to, uh...<eos> I got to make a phone call and let your mom know that you're okay.<eos> And other people.<eos> - Who?
All right.<eos> It was a gray area.<eos> Hey. So, Meredith was talking about bringing Nathan over tonight.<eos> Bringing him home?<eos> - To our house?
Stop it! You're scaring me!<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Okay.<eos> Okay.<eos> You...
You're my only chance.<eos> I will kill you all if I have to!<eos> - I can't give you... - Shoot him!<eos> If we don't get him to a hospital, he's gonna die!<eos> Careful!
Where'd that come from?<eos> I just was in the mood.<eos> Dr. Bailey.<eos> I need your help with my brother.<eos> Your brother?
- Yeah.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Inject it around the wound.<eos> How close?<eos> Right around the edge.
And I pissed on him.<eos> He never told anyone.<eos> I respected that.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I-I'm so sorry.
Seems pretty simple to me.<eos> Had a chance to put him on tape, to bury him, and you tipped him off.<eos> Don't tell me it's some sort of mistake... lack of judgment.<eos> It's a lack of loyalty, Satch, to me.<eos> - To your friend.
We all make mistakes, huh?<eos> Sorry I doubted you.<eos> I don't get it.<eos> You said it needed to be fixed, so I called cousin Mike in Jersey.<eos> Cousin Mike?
You think that'll make things better for us?<eos> I know it will, Papa.<eos> This little Munchkin went to see the Wizard, and this little Munchkin stayed at home.<eos> And this little Munchkin never lived to see the light of day again.<eos> Careful.
Would you do me a favor and give me a ring if the missus shows up?<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Appreciate it very much.<eos> Right this way.
Go on in.<eos> We've gotta get out of here. No way.<eos> We have to find out what they're planning.<eos> They'll mark you as a you know what in a heartbeat.<eos> One very slow heartbeat.
Hey! Hey!<eos> You get me out of here.<eos> Come on, come on.<eos> Come on, I need everybody out of there.<eos> Kidd!
I can not tell you.<eos> But he has to know that he was a victim of twisted people.<eos> And who does not suspect who they are.<eos> I do not believe it.<eos> What a shame.
You said you could help me.<eos> Only if you are the agent.<eos> How can you help me?<eos> Saying that I have found you.<eos> Who?
I leave you.<eos> Listen.<eos> Okay, I'll ask another to take care of your case.<eos> But if there is the lesser thing, if you are afraid... if you have an intuition and no you can tell anyone... I'm going to propose a system to warn me.<eos> No one else, just me.
Then dress up as a man.<eos> Do we accompany your boss to point B... and then goes only to point C?<eos> Yes.<eos> If something happens to your boss, will be bad for my cousins.<eos> And for me too.
But I do not know why, I I sense something happens.<eos> That has changed something.<eos> Do not you?<eos> Yes.<eos> You too?
Ricky started getting handy with his fists.<eos> She moved back in with me after that.<eos> Ricky the night watchman at Garston's?<eos> She's a good girl.<eos> Always home by midnight.
Thank you.<eos> Daniel.<eos> Hello.<eos> I hear congratulations are in order.<eos> Your engagement.
Hey. I almost forgot.<eos> I have extra tickets to tonight's performance of kabuki Shakespeare.<eos> Any takers?<eos> Everyone said no to you!<eos> Big deal.
One year.<eos> Fuck!<eos> Fine.<eos> Fine. - It's a deal.<eos> - Deal.
You should probably work on that.<eos> Hey.<eos> This is on him.<eos> Has yours...?<eos> Yours?
He could tell her suicide was staged because it had the hallmarks of tradecraft taught at the Farm.<eos> So I started looking into other suspicious deaths of high-profile individuals...<eos> Government officials, diplomats, possible foreign intelligence officers.<eos> - Where?<eos> - Worldwide.
What's this got to do with crop rotation?<eos> Er, I dunno.<eos> But space is great, isn't it?<eos> 'You're missing it, aren't you? '<eos> - Crop rotation?
Er, I dunno.<eos> But space is great, isn't it?<eos> 'You're missing it, aren't you? '<eos> - Crop rotation?<eos> - Space.
Listen, uh...<eos> Hey.<eos> It's about loyalty, remember?<eos> - To the group.<eos> - No, to me.
When was the last time they fought?<eos> I remember the morning that Margaret died, - they had a tiny fight. - Ugh!<eos> I'd barely even call it a kerfuffle... because Margaret was wearing some of Adelaide's old jewelry that Summer believed belonged to her.<eos> She made a big scene and stormed off to her uncle's.<eos> Her uncle's?
Is it your expert opinion that the DNA found in the semen in Mrs. Henderson's bed did not belong to Mr. Henderson?<eos> That's right.<eos> It belonged to Rutger Hiss.<eos> Belonged... to...<eos> Rutger Hiss.
I gave you a syringe a few weeks back.<eos> It's the last one, and we need it for Liv.<eos> Do you have it with you?<eos> I gave it to someone.<eos> To whom?
You didn't think that was relevant?<eos> If something like that had been bought to my attention, I would have presented it in court.<eos> If it does exist, then give it to me and I'll take it to the...<eos> You really think I'm going to trust you with it?<eos> A corrupt lawyer?
And if he doesn't, then what?<eos> Shoot him?<eos> That man stole a year of my life.<eos> Then you should take that witness statement to the proper authorities.<eos> Proper authorities(?
If only we had a chimney sweep.<eos> Oh, you have got to be...<eos> What an awful thing to happen.<eos> I know, you just get settled in a place and you have to up sticks.<eos> Drinkiepoos?
Drinking in the morning?<eos> No, delivers his parcel, heads back to work, never even glances at temptation.<eos> Who was the parcel for?<eos> Well, the, uh... You know.<eos> Mr Aldous Kemp?
I warned you, didn't I?<eos> But, no, you had to have your foolhardy job in Africa!<eos> Which you made me leave to come back here to save your business!<eos> Like you've spent my entire life trying to make me stay here, rather than working on my art, pursuing a career!<eos> Career? !
What do you think?<eos> Yes, it suits you - unreliable, noisy, and good at getting people into trouble!<eos> Actually, it's not mine.<eos> It's a present.<eos> For Father Brown.
You're a man of God?<eos> My whole life.<eos> You'll need him where you're going.<eos> That's enough!<eos> Into to your cells.
Let's go.<eos> Stop!<eos> Quickly, quickly!<eos> Turn right!<eos> Down the stairs!
Down the stairs!<eos> Oi!<eos> Up.<eos> Lockdown!<eos> Back to your cells!
Perhaps we're not so different, you and I.<eos> Excuse me. I've got a speech to make.<eos> A few words about our darling Luella.<eos> Now, she may not be my true granddaughter...<eos> No bloodline in sight.
Ben Stobert.<eos> Brenda Neill.<eos> It was all her.<eos> Thank you.<eos> - To beer.
Brenda Neill.<eos> It was all her.<eos> Thank you.<eos> - To beer.<eos> - To beer.
I was always into planes.<eos> I used to have those balsa-wood-rubber-band ones when I was a kid.<eos> And where we grew up, there was a... an airfield.<eos> It was small, but there was a guy there that let me work for him, and, um, he taught me how to fly props.<eos> - As kid?
We checked.<eos> But you're right.<eos> There are risks.<eos> There are real, long-term things we can offer you.<eos> And your son, too.
I guess I just... Want to feel... Like I did before.<eos> Like nothing happened.<eos> Something big happened.<eos> You went through a trauma.<eos> Trauma?
Yeah.<eos> Paige, I'm...<eos> I'm really sorry.<eos> I have to go right back out.<eos> Work?
I don't know.<eos> Out in the middle of the night...<eos> What, you think he's reporting on us?<eos> To who?<eos> His people?
To who?<eos> His people?<eos> The centre talked to them.<eos> I know.<eos> Not the Americans.
Are you allowed to trust anybody?<eos> Some people trust their wives.<eos> I didn't trust mine.<eos> I have no idea why.<eos> Well, what about your kids? Not really.
I just need your help first.<eos> She's back.<eos> She's headed west, west on 16th.<eos> Stop there.<eos> Against the wall.
There's a sudden removal of consequences when... well.<eos> Annie passed along your file.<eos> I'm sorry about your prognosis.<eos> Have you told your wife?<eos> Girlfriend or...
- Oh.<eos> Let him have it.<eos> Gilfoyle thought he was too good to work on SeeFood, and now he's about to lose a fortune.<eos> Okay.<eos> Ready for test.
So, um, it's actually good that you're here, because... you want in and we need funding, especially since no VC in town will touch us, not even Monica's new firm.<eos> So, Gavin pulls out, and you want me to be your sloppy seconds.<eos> It's always about my money, isn't it?<eos> Well, you are an investor, so what else would it be about?<eos> My idea!
Clearly, she has a lot of pent-up sexual energy, likely from working in this worm farm, so that's the angle I'm taking since I'm not allowed to have a seizure.<eos> Besides, she's going to bat for us.<eos> You should be thanking me.<eos> The CTO is on the way in.<eos> Yes, because of the technology and because of our business proposal.
VR is just a fad.<eos> Oh, Richard. I've forgotten what an envious little crone you can be.<eos> Envious? Me?<eos> Of who?<eos> Keenan Feldspar?
But, um... you know, what they say in life, "You can't always get what you want."<eos> This feeling sucks.<eos> Trust me, you get used to it.<eos> Wait. Keenan said no?<eos> To us?
I have a book for you.<eos> No, Gilf.<eos> Last night, when I was sitting out there by the smoldering husk of my palapa, - so cruelly taken away from me... - You burned it down yourself.<eos> which led me to my epiphany.<eos> This epiphany.
That's why I decided to bring PeaceFare into the world.<eos> Ah, good for you.<eos> Okay.<eos> It was great to meet you, Richard.<eos> Yeah, and you too.
- I'll talk to you.<eos> Yes. - Bye.<eos> We'll go to them.<eos> Guys, we'll go to them.<eos> - Who?
They were my ride home.<eos> - Um, yes, also it makes you high king.<eos> You can go to the rainbow bridge to be crowned.<eos> Meh, let's skip the ceremony.<eos> - On to business, then.
No!<eos> No, no, no!<eos> No, no.<eos> They kicked you out?<eos> Yeah, thanks to you.
- Get out my way!<eos> - Put it down!<eos> Now!<eos> You heard me.<eos> Against the wall.
- Put it down!<eos> Now!<eos> You heard me.<eos> Against the wall.<eos> Against the wall.
Honey?<eos> Kira?<eos> Wanna give me...<eos> Hey.<eos> She just...
And a friend of mine is doing a clinical trial next month.<eos> He's looking for candidates.<eos> You're serious?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Jesus.
I mean, I know you... you told me how they do it in Switzerland, But just... I really want to hear how you're gonna do it.<eos> I need to wash my hands.<eos> Yeah, the sink's right there.<eos> Where's your bathroom?<eos> - Down the hall.
I didn't tell you everything.<eos> I charged them.<eos> - How much?<eos> - $10,000.<eos> Jesus!
Sid Thomas-Haye.<eos> What about him?<eos> Ellen hauled me in her office to ask me all sorts of questions since he was transferred to my ward by you.<eos> - What did you tell her?<eos> - The truth.
Living in a scrap yard?<eos> Maybe he ditched it and ran.<eos> There you go.<eos> God.<eos> - Jesus.
You always remember your first time, right?<eos> We should celebrate... our partnership.<eos> Want a drink?<eos> Can I use your bathroom?<eos> Yeah, just down the hall.
Apparently, Thomas's pad in Soho was unreconstructed Hogarth.<eos> How marvellous.<eos> Not really.<eos> So, won't you miss your teaching?<eos> Hardly. All those dirty-minded little boys.
You're five minutes away, and you want me to order you a Merlot.<eos> Actually, I'm not five minutes away, but I would kill for a drink.<eos> Everything okay?<eos> Yeah, you know how we're making that big discovery push on the Pulaski case?<eos> The homicide, yeah.
Yeah.<eos> Yeah, that does sound like her.<eos> - I just saw her.<eos> - This way.<eos> Up those stairs.
You shouldn't, and that's by design.<eos> Which way am I coming from, Josh... which way?<eos> I literally just saw that rash jump on your ear.<eos> - Call a doctor.<eos> - Which way?
Which way am I coming from, Josh... which way?<eos> I literally just saw that rash jump on your ear.<eos> - Call a doctor.<eos> - Which way?<eos> Which way?
Um...<eos> There is something, but we urge you not to do it.<eos> - Tell me.<eos> - Petition the fairies?<eos> Fairies?
I... I read ahead.<eos> More than that, you... you understood the theory behind the spell, and-- and you reshaped it.<eos> Your discipline is meta-composition.<eos> You are a Knowledge student.<eos> - Knowledge?
Show time.<eos> See you later, Teddy.<eos> Whoa! Clumsy me.<eos> I just slipped and fell.<eos> Please.
'Cause I just got a call from the real consultant, and he asked when we could reschedule because he was told I had "pink eyes."<eos> Okay, look... this is our friend, Karl.<eos> Karl is the reason that we are pushing so many whistles.<eos> Nobody was buying them, okay, and we just wanted to help, and he had an alternative approach<eos> - to this whole situation. - Mmhmm.
Ooh, this seems aggressive.<eos> I'm just gonna...<eos> May I be excused to go to the bathroom?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Me, too.
Aye, please, that was funny.<eos> Besides, I was the one who broke a heel trying to keep the door shut.<eos> College is a big change.<eos> I'm just trying to keep it light for him.<eos> For him or for you?
- True.<eos> I'm sorry. One more time.<eos> - What?<eos> We didn't behave well when we were married, and I feel bad about that.<eos> Me, too.
Move!<eos> What are they doing?<eos> Where are they going?<eos> To repton, I imagine.<eos> To the boats?
I shall lead he attack on Holland.<eos> This is wonderful news, Sire!<eos> Your loyalty gives me great comfort.<eos> The question of Regent remains.<eos> Madame,
Is there any way we can see the entire museum in, like, three minutes and then go get food?<eos> What does that mean?<eos> If you're good, I'll give you a cookie.<eos> - Yay!<eos> Deal.
What does that mean?<eos> If you're good, I'll give you a cookie.<eos> - Yay!<eos> Deal.<eos> - Deal.

She did.<eos> What kind of dog?<eos> A beagle.<eos> I love beagles.<eos> Me, too.
What, you gonna violate my parole?<eos> It might be.<eos> Buckle up.<eos> Anyway, my older boy's 17, younger boy's 14.<eos> How about you?
Hey, boss.<eos> Got a report of two cops fighting.<eos> Which two of you?<eos> That'd be Officer Bryson and myself, boss.<eos> What about?
We have to prepare.<eos> For what?<eos> The sons of ragnar.<eos> The sons of ragnar will come to claim vengeance.<eos> Not upon me.
For what?<eos> The sons of ragnar.<eos> The sons of ragnar will come to claim vengeance.<eos> Not upon me.<eos> Only upon aelle.
So now we're grunting.<eos> So what?<eos> We want blood-revenge against Aelle?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Not only against Aelle.
- No.<eos> It's a truth.<eos> I just don't know what the truth is.<eos> The gods haven't revealed it to me.<eos> Not yet anyway.
Indeed.<eos> The King's thrown himself back into matters of state and the construction of the palace.<eos> Well, no doubt, he was delighted to see you.<eos> Solange, please ask the maid to prepare my bath.<eos> Of course, Madame.
And they shall pay again.<eos> Put another note under their door.<eos> I'm in no mood for tenderness.<eos> You will stand behind the hedge and you will wait for my signal.<eos> Yes ,Madame.
Two hours, Madame.<eos> You do not have two hours, you have one!<eos> Stupid girl!<eos> Go and find out at what time the King is expected to make his entry.<eos> Yes, Madame.
I kinda needed this.<eos> This just reminds me of home.<eos> - Ow!<eos> Huh, hot.<eos> - Careful.
Go after him.<eos> I'll cover you.<eos> We should have stayed at the party.<eos> Quit complaining.<eos> Uh-oh!
Is it done?<eos> Yeah, we're good.<eos> Argh!<eos> He's lying to you.<eos> About everything.
And I didn't do anything.<eos> Ooh, I want to believe you, Dino.<eos> Mrs. Murtaugh, you have known me since I was 15 years old.<eos> I would not lie to you.<eos> Not to you.
You're never this interested in how I solve the tattoos.<eos> This one points to an off-the-book program being run out of this office, so I need to know what is happening under my watch, and I need to know now.<eos> Okay.<eos> I linked the tattoo database to a secret NSA data collection program.<eos> Omaha?
Oh, I miss Paris.<eos> Do you come to Paris a lot?<eos> Yes, it's my fix.<eos> I need one shopping day every two months or I'd go mad out there.<eos> Madame.
Jimmy!<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> Why are you doing this?<eos> America needs to be punished for supporting the other side of my country's civil war.<eos> Which country?
Mr. Mayor, the beginning of what?<eos> Let's not pretend that you're not in the loop.<eos> Zombies.<eos> Bit by bit, now, the secret will leak out and we need to prepare.<eos> Oh. We?
No, no, please.<eos> R-Rufus, you have to...<eos> What do we know about this fair?<eos> Lot of stuff was invented there... Cream of Wheat, Hershey's chocolate, Aunt Jemima... how is that still a thing, by the way?<eos> - Rufus.
What I don't understand is why someone would build an airtight chamber in a hotel.<eos> The same reasons they put gas jets in the guest rooms.<eos> Someone built this place to trap people.<eos> - Who would do that?<eos> - A serial killer.
I'm all you've got.<eos> So back the hell off.<eos> This is my last recording.<eos> Give it to Rittenhouse.<eos> Rufus...
Sarah.<eos> You need to listen to her.<eos> Kira!<eos> Rachel.<eos> Ah, Jesus.
Symbolic clock face, representing a countdown to possible global catastrophe, started by some atomic scientists in 1947.<eos> The closer they set the clock to midnight, the closer we are to global disaster.<eos> Currently, it's set at three minutes to midnight.<eos> So now every clock in the world is the Doomsday Clock?<eos> Thanks to the Monks, yes.
- None.<eos> We get in the car, decide left or right, and drive.<eos> Never know where we're gonna end up.<eos> A seaside resort, a national park...<eos> An industrial pig farm.
Neither could you.<eos> And more to the point you are not sending me up there to babysit a load of smelly humans.<eos> Yeah, well, I'm afraid that's exactly what I'm doing.<eos> This is me we're talking about.<eos> Me.
We're gonna need that phone.<eos> Is that really necessary?<eos> - I'm here of my own volition.<eos> - Volition?<eos> His own free will.
If I don't deliver, it will be because she stays.<eos> We work as a team.<eos> I require her counsel.<eos> Well, you can have it anytime you want.<eos> By phone.
So a man you recently went out with has a criminal record and you didn't tell us about that?<eos> I'm sure he didn't take Theo.<eos> Was he at the party last night?<eos> No, I broke up with him, like I said, two months ago.<eos> - For what reason?
They're two of us, we could have taken you out already, but we don't want to.<eos> We're coming out now.<eos> Just put the gun down!<eos> Just want to talk.<eos> Alone.
I know him better than anyone.<eos> And I can tell you, in all honesty, he can be a real jerk.<eos> He teases me and tortures me, runs me over with his wheelchair.<eos> He told me I was adopted and my real mom was Nancy Grace!<eos> Nice.
That's how it works.<eos> He can prove my involvement, I can't prove his.<eos> Barton destroyed the recording.<eos> When this goes public, they're gonna charge you with a felony, and then every arrest that you made, including the 400 with me as your partner, is gonna be thrown out or subject to appeal.<eos> Regrettably, yes.
And, of course, one-down, "Indian national product of French-Italian agreement", is simply "of" in French, followed by an Italian form of agreement, making "Desi" a person from India.<eos> Why do you use such difficult words?<eos> Every word is chosen for its letters, Nina.<eos> For example, have a look at 18-across.<eos> 18-across:
- No, James. No, no, no.<eos> - Isn't it?<eos> A taxi in Dubai looks like this.<eos> Oh, right.<eos> Yeah, of course.
Here, in the moment of truth...<eos> I'm waiting for amber.<eos> There it is.<eos> Amber and...<eos> Forward to glory for Grand Tour!
We believe that you, and you alone, can stop them.<eos> Okay.<eos> So, who's in charge?<eos> Who do we report to?<eos> My son.
I've gone through it.<eos> Nothing out of the ordinary.<eos> Purse, pen, diary, laptop cable.<eos> And then... this.<eos> "To My Family.
- Indeed.<eos> You enjoying the book, Sir?<eos> Mmm.<eos> Very much. You liked it as well, Dwayne?<eos> Me?
It's Esther's laptop.<eos> We found it in Ms Baptiste's room.<eos> You stole it.<eos> She did.<eos> On your instructions, no doubt.
Detectives!<eos> Looking for me?<eos> How you doing, Ronald?<eos> Good. Can't complain.<eos> Me, neither.
But the Kents were your friends.<eos> You bet.<eos> It's complicated, Sean.<eos> Not to me.<eos> Not for me, either.
But if he could die knowing that the truth would not be discovered, then at least he could die with some sense of peace.<eos> He was that close to achieving it.<eos> If it wasn't for an out-of-date packet of cigarettes.<eos> Mrs Taylor, I'm afraid we will have to arrest you.<eos> I-I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.<eos> No.<eos> The truth is better.<eos> You are right, we have to escape.<eos> All of us.
You know what?<eos> I'll forget everything I know about your dad.<eos> Yes, I'll... I'll just un-know it.<eos> We can go back to the way things were.<eos> Our special friendship.
I-I wasn't sure how you'd react.<eos> And-And I don't know how you feel.<eos> But... .. well, I... .. I think...<eos> I'm in love with you and I don't want you to go.<eos> Basically.
I could pretend to be like them.<eos> I could do the job better, I could get the promotions, but at the end of the day, I look like I looked and I was what I was.<eos> Men don't like to admit that glass ceilings exist because they are the glass ceiling.<eos> Well, you just shattered it.<eos> Only by default.
Miss, stop where you are right now.<eos> Miss?<eos> We had a report of unauthorized personnel on this floor.<eos> Can you identify yourself?<eos> Ma'am?
Anyway... uh...<eos> Am I... doing the right thing?<eos> I work on the Hill.<eos> That's a long commute for a guy.<eos> For anything, really.
They were loyal to Mandalore and Saxon betrayed them!<eos> Enough!<eos> Fenn Rau's people are dead and mine are not.<eos> And I intend to keep them that way.<eos> All of them.
(ENGINES RUMBLING DISTANTLY) Mother, what have you done?<eos> You can't do this!<eos> SAXON: Yes, she can.<eos> Because she is loyal.<eos> Just not to you.
Never.<eos> But I am going to miss you.<eos> We all will.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Both of you.
We wanna upgrade to a force field system.<eos> And I explained all this in my email.<eos> Oh... now, well, it sounds like somebody dropped the ball.<eos> Who did you send the email to?<eos> - You. - Huh?
I was hoping someone would disagree.<eos> Who cares?<eos> It's going to be fine.<eos> You ladies need to grow a pair.<eos> All of you.
Buckle up!<eos> You just got a little bump on the head.<eos> You're all set to leave.<eos> We called your emergency contact.<eos> My emergency contact?
Hey, Ruby, do you want to go shopping?<eos> - Yeah!<eos> - She can't.<eos> She was suspended from school because she hit another kid.<eos> Dope!
I don't have a catchphrase.<eos> Oh. She's good.<eos> So?<eos> Let's go!<eos> Everyone on the buses!
If a meddling student.<eos> And you were brilliant.<eos> But it was 1962, and you were a woman.<eos> And what I couldn't get with brains, I bought.<eos> By fortune and fiction.
Fine, give me your phone.<eos> We never met, but you know me.<eos> I knew the previous occupant down here.<eos> Your sisters too.<eos> Sarah and Helena.
We were great together.<eos> We were.<eos> Look, um... maybe... if things with your... with your job settle and everything settles, we could... we could just check... and see.<eos> I'd like that.<eos> Yeah, me too.
- I just mean I'm pulling for you, sir.<eos> - I'm gonna be the president, and you're going to flip me those motherfucking controls.<eos> Will, come on.<eos> What do you want?<eos> - I just...
What has he done to earn the title?<eos> This is not about him earning anything.<eos> He's already getting classified memos.<eos> Why does she want this?<eos> "She"?
He's already getting classified memos.<eos> Why does she want this?<eos> "She"?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> The vice president.
-Where's Francis?<eos> -Where's Doug Stamper? And Mr. Yates?<eos> -We're following protocol, ma'am.<eos> National Security Advisor Cafferty is on her way.<eos> -Ma'am?
I'm telling you. I know third parties that have negotiated with ICO in the past.<eos> Hostages and whatnot...<eos> who may know something.<eos> But I need a line.<eos> Just a... a secure one.
Isn't that correct?<eos> We can't send you above until the threat is contained--<eos> -Open this door.<eos> -Let him out.<eos> -Ma'am?
-Ma'am?<eos> -Let the president out.<eos> Open the door.<eos> Open it.<eos> Ma'am.
You have all used me far long enough.<eos> So, the party's over, the ride's done.<eos> I respect the office too much to allow this to continue going on.<eos> That's why I am announcing to this committee and to the nation that as of 6:00 p.m. tomorrow evening, I shall resign the office of President of the United States.<eos> Order!
Dwayne's on his way back with Mr Lewis' boat.<eos> When he returns, I want it searched from top to bottom and everything logged and photographed.<eos> - Yes, sir.<eos> - When you've done that, I'd like you going door-to-door.<eos> Or boat-to-boat, rather.
- I'm sorry.<eos> - The hours sucked.<eos> Yeah, but... changing horses midstream, that's risky.<eos> Wait, so this Neville guy just shows up with how many people?<eos> A dozen, maybe more.
Just answer the question, Mr. Soto.<eos> In fact, you went there alone and stabbed him to death because the thought of Trevor and Mia together enraged you.<eos> It wasn't about Mia.<eos> It was about the Ukraine.<eos> Ukraine?
You'll have all the help you need from the police in Jersey.<eos> But first, I'm gonna go find Marcus.<eos> I know he's gonna want to say hi to you.<eos> So, what've you been up to the last two years?<eos> Bit of this, bit of that.
She got what she wanted.<eos> You should've let me give her a shoeing.<eos> You really think that would've helped?<eos> Wouldn't have hurt.<eos> Well, me.
Really?<eos> You're breaking the law right now.<eos> Oh, we're breaking the law?<eos> You did serious bodily harm to a child.<eos> Your child!
I haven't replied. N... no, I can only imagine what you must have thought.<eos> I apologize for the invitation.<eos> Apologize? Yes. I really overstepped.<eos> I... Steve and I were going over the final numbers, and I realized I hadn't heard back from you, and when I told him, he blew up.<eos> About what?
Why isn't she dead?<eos> Well, for the moment, Agent Ressler, that remains a mystery.<eos> Oh, oh, oh.<eos> I found our suspect.<eos> Good for you.
It's my burden.<eos> I am professionally obligated to listen to everything you say.<eos> Nice place.<eos> You come here a lot?<eos> Special occasions.
I was afraid I was gonna hit Avery.<eos> I froze up.<eos> Avery finally talked the guy down, but, um... well, this one had collateral damage.<eos> It bled into other areas of my life.<eos> Intimate areas of my life.
- We have a Skype date.<eos> Siobhan wants a summit.<eos> You're calling them or what?<eos> They're calling us!<eos> "Us"?
Get off!<eos> - I smell Neo shit!<eos> - Easy there, pumpkin.<eos> We don't want to harm<eos> - your cargo.
He died.<eos> Authorities have confirmed the plane belongs to Howard Hargrave, a sometimes controversial figure in the field of private military contracting.<eos> His firm, halcyon aegis, is among the largest...<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> For what?
We don't have time for that.<eos> For all we know, Murphy's on his way back from Paris right now.<eos> If there is something incriminating in here, then he might come back and get it before we can get a warrant.<eos> Jesus, Keen, you just got your badge back.<eos> Because of Reddington.
Are you there?<eos> Let's move.<eos> Perfect.<eos> Although I do think I wore it better.<eos> On my signal.
You know why?<eos> Because it feels good to do good.<eos> We've saved thousands and thousands of lives by delivering everything from basic medical care and immunizations to advanced prosthetics and sophisticated surgical procedures.<eos> Facial reconstruction, spinal fusions...<eos> Right on schedule.
Do you really want the answer to that?<eos> Do I want to know?<eos> I'm not sure, but it's our job to know.<eos> Who you calling?<eos> My sister.
This was a beauty.<eos> You sold it?<eos> I checked my records after your call.<eos> Sold it a year and a half ago.<eos> To a Bill Johns?
You sold it?<eos> I checked my records after your call.<eos> Sold it a year and a half ago.<eos> To a Bill Johns?<eos> William Johns?
- Who was he?<eos> Half a con artist living a double life.<eos> Hank, I think you got the wrong guy.<eos> Marvin, is this the man who approached you last night?<eos> You and your friend Jupiter?
Jay...<eos> Police!<eos> Keep your hands where we can see them.<eos> Get against the wall. Against the wall, now!<eos> Against the wall.
I'm sorry.<eos> Okay, Wyatt...<eos> Come on, Rufus.<eos> Stay with us.<eos> Okay, Rufus.
We're buckled in.<eos> Get us out of here.<eos> - What?<eos> - Rufus.<eos> Rufus!
Bryce Cooper.<eos> Star right wing of the '07 champs.<eos> The last Purgatory High School team to not only win the cup, but a single game.<eos> I'm gonna pass this off.<eos> To Black Badge?
- It's like he let it happen.<eos> - Or he ripped it out himself.<eos> - Where's Lucado?<eos> - Called away.<eos> On a personal matter.
We.<eos> Will. Turn.<eos> This.<eos> Town.<eos> Around!
And I see I'm not the only one who's changed.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> I was hoping you'd help an old friend.<eos> I chopped down a tree belonging to the wicked witch of the north, and she punished me by giving me a terrible curse.<eos> What?
- Okay.<eos> - Heard you need something done. - Yeah.<eos> Yes.<eos> - Um, when can you...<eos> - Not over the phone.
I don't know who you're talking about.<eos> He's not here!<eos> He's not here!<eos> He just comes in once in a while to do business!<eos> Which business?
Dilated cardiomyopathy.<eos> That's right.<eos> Shame.<eos> I'm sorry, Sam. I'm really am.<eos> Me, too.
Um, because once Jiya can pilot the Lifeboat,<eos> Rittenhouse is going to eliminate Rufus. Just...<eos> See, I have no illusions about who I am.<eos> Whatever's coming, I richly deserve it.<eos> But Rufus...
I'm just looking out for you.<eos> Well, you should be looking out for yourself.<eos> I heard everything about your new co-worker.<eos> Maxine talked about Shelby?<eos> Better me than a mediator.
But you just ruined my life and took Steven's.<eos> Why?<eos> Because he got in the way?<eos> Who'd you go to, Ma?<eos> Who, Benny?
That's a real thing?<eos> Their slogan is "We're all about dating and not the carbon-14 kind""<eos> Well, have a lovely evening.<eos> Thanks.<eos> You, too.
Who said you could use my first name?<eos> Bret, Bret, you're gonna be the toast of Las Vegas.<eos> It's the reason why you wanted to get in the casino business with Wayne Hastings in the first place.<eos> You're gonna get it right in the teeth on this one. You know that, right?<eos> Right in the teeth, great.
You did good, Savior.<eos> Thank you, Father.<eos> Welcome home, son.<eos> I've missed you so much.<eos> Both of you.
Something about some problem with somebody else's girl.<eos> He tell you whose?<eos> 'Course not.<eos> Then he'd have to explain how it was Sal the Horse's goomah and that Jimmy hit Sal over the head with a champagne bottle when they got into it.<eos> The back of the head.
If you'll have me.<eos> The game begins again tomorrow.<eos> Get some sleep.<eos> You'll need it.<eos> All of you.
You caught a whale, Riggs.<eos> Doesn't mean you get to keep him.<eos> I need to question this witness, Cap.<eos> We already have him for the Gonzalez case.<eos> Other cases.
with everyone who's contacted Kimball's phone.<eos> Nothing.<eos> These are all in-service calls and any paper generated on the warehouse.<eos> Most of the calls came from the same landline.<eos> Same woman.
Wanted to check in.<eos> - There he is.<eos> - He confessed.<eos> - Okay.<eos> To who?
Give me a break, Ronnie.<eos> Chappel's gonna end up getting somebody killed.<eos> Was I addressing you, Detective?<eos> Hand your gun and your badge<eos> - to your captain.
Where was this attitude earlier? That is an excellent question, Lieutenant.<eos> This new attitude of his feels insincere to me.<eos> Hey, it's better than before.<eos> Now, if you could upgrade your attitude...<eos> My attitude?
You're leaving?<eos> We just figured this out.<eos> I have a meeting at the White House.<eos> About?<eos> My personal business.
But now's your chance to save lives.<eos> Where would she have taken the people?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Unless she arranged another sale.<eos> To who?
Do you have an appointment?<eos> No. No, I don't.<eos> Can't you squeeze me in? Just two minutes?<eos> I'm afraid not.<eos> Not without an appointment.
And...<eos> Ta-da!<eos> What's going on?<eos> What's going on is you're ready.<eos> Ready for what?
Ta-da!<eos> What's going on?<eos> What's going on is you're ready.<eos> Ready for what?<eos> Your first flight...
Oh, is that offer for everybody?<eos> Nice try.<eos> I'm not going.<eos> Where's your bathroom?<eos> Mm, just down there.
I'll let Sheere know to wait for a time.<eos> You all right?<eos> Yeah, yeah, yeah, I gotta go.<eos> - Where are you?<eos> - Dentist.
Who?<eos> So maybe they were going to blackmail us.<eos> Ask for some money?<eos> I mean, you must have talked about us.<eos> Me.
I gotta go.<eos> This has been great.<eos> You keep writin' those words down, 'cause one of these days...<eos> you'll have more of 'em.<eos> Okay, bye, everybody!
Like it or not, I'm rooting for this.<eos> Don't you have a floor to mop or something?<eos> Oh, Whatever. Listen, I'm just saying,<eos> I'm rooting for it.<eos> Hey, Kidd?
- Uh, Earth to Clay...<eos> Seriously, both of you.<eos> Yes, we want you to throw an engagement party for us to use as a backdrop for a matter of national security.<eos> And I'm supposed to just blindly accept this?<eos> Unfortunately, yes.
The public will turn to you when the time is right.<eos> Think it over.<eos> When you find your senses, pick up your phone and say so.<eos> Who do I call?<eos> Anyone.
No, I don't want to be here.<eos> Okay?<eos> But if we don't start producing,<eos> Moody's gonna pull the plug on this.<eos> And all of us.
Look, you are the... the "Earpiest" Earp of them all.<eos> - I guess we're still fighting.<eos> - No, someone's coming up the...<eos> Do you have any idea when Doc's planning<eos> - stairs.

But I know how to call the shots.<eos> Now, the opposition would wonder if I can take them.<eos> Can you?<eos> After the year I had, I'm still here, aren't I?<eos> Not of your own volition.
Not exactly.<eos> Kindler's psychiatrist said he's made some threats.<eos> Including one towards me.<eos> Towards you?<eos> Allegedly.
I've always loved that phrase,<eos> "shadow of a doubt."<eos> It's like they let a poet write the statutes that day.<eos> But that's not really even a legal term, is it?<eos> Actually...
I, uh...<eos> I needed to pick something up in town.<eos> Wynonna, um... when the demon jumped back into me, it was different.<eos> It told me things...<eos> - about you.

He was only tryin' to help a friend... or someone who used to be his friend.<eos> I guess.<eos> I'm... I'm truly sorry.<eos> I guess the right thing for me to do now is to come clean<eos> - to your mom.

Are you running late?<eos> I'm just calling you to tell you to call me later after you talk to Shelby.<eos> I-I just spoke to her.<eos> She told me where to meet you.<eos> Just up the road, right?

What other choice do we have?<eos> Look, if we trust the wrong person, it's over.<eos> Not just for us. For the whole country.<eos> - Now, I gotta get back to my team.<eos> - Your team, or Jane?
- It's always been her plan to be the youngest captain in the history of the NYPD, but if she doesn't pass this exam, she's gonna have to wait another three years to take it again, and that'll disrupt her entire life calendar.<eos> - Is that a real thing?<eos> - It hangs over our bed.<eos> - So she's stress-braiding.<eos> - Big deal.
- Yeah, there bars on the window.<eos> - I just set up a video game system.<eos> The kid's much happier.<eos> Turns out children don't care about model trains.<eos> - Not only children.
- Gina, it's okay, you don't have to do this.<eos> - Yes, I do, because you're my brother.<eos> Isn't she great?<eos> We used to have sex, you know.<eos> Cool.

The one thing I will say, though, is, it could take us a while to get a warrant.<eos> And we know he's hard up for cash, and we also know that's his primary buyer, so we could see what this guy knows.<eos> - Both smart suggestions.<eos> - I say we do...<eos> - Peralta's.
But just remember, we are not going to jail.<eos> We didn't do it.<eos> We're innocent.<eos> Guilty.<eos> On all charges.

I gather you've had another week of successful operation.<eos> True, I suppose.<eos> The ladies can't get enough of your amputations, can they, sir?<eos> There is a matter I did want to have a quick word about, if possible.<eos> A personal medical matter.
But every bit of you hammering away at my wall of denial is what finally brought it down.<eos> So I'm here to tell you thank you... Because now I feel like I can finally move forward with my life.<eos> You're welcome, Louis.<eos> And I think that this means that you're officially ready.<eos> - Uh, for what?
What'd she say?<eos> You didn't mention anything about that in your statement.<eos> No... 'cause it didn't really make any sense.<eos> After she, um... after she attacked the guy... she started going towards the girlfriend, the one that turned on the music.<eos> - The girl, Leah, right?
I told you it was too soon to go outdoors.<eos> And I told you it was necessary to offer aid to the people.<eos> However, I was met by some of the Christian priests.<eos> Are you all right?<eos> Thanks to this man.

She says apropos of nothing.<eos> - Sorry... any ladies for Kyle?<eos> - Ladies of the night?<eos> No, I mean, I had a very interesting h-to-h with him today.<eos> Heart-to-heart.
Oh, yes, that's right.<eos> You mentioned that before, Uncle Richard, yet again.<eos> But just listen... the reason why Tilda is so great...<eos> "Tilda"?<eos> First name base?

Egypt itself was divided between two mighty brothers.<eos> Osiris, the God of Life, was the beloved king of all the lands made bountiful by the Nile.<eos> His brother, Set, ruled the far barren desert finding both strength and bitterness in his isolation.<eos> But then the time came for Osiris to crown a new king.<eos> His only son, Horus.

We cannot let fear divide us.<eos> Please give me back the Zootopia I love.<eos> Come on, Hopps.<eos> The new mayor wants to see us.<eos> The mayor?
Why did I think I could make a difference?<eos> Because you're a trier, that's why.<eos> You've always been a trier.<eos> Oh, I tried. And it made life so much worse for so many innocent predators.<eos> Not all of them, though.

- What are you doing here?<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> - [SPEAKING ARABIC]<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> Sorry.
By the time we get there, we'll know everything important about each other.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - I have children.<eos> - I assumed.<eos> Me, too.
Maybe you can tell me where is this...<eos> Fourth floor Section 41.<eos> Fourth floor!<eos> Fourth floor!<eos> Sorry.
You are here ...temporary.<eos> You're not Bill Pope.<eos> He has a gun over her head.<eos> He has a gun...<eos> On the baby.
The mountains, the trees... The birds in the trees.<eos> But they did not make you.<eos> That is why you must go.<eos> What if I live with the nilgai? No.<eos> Or the mongoose?
I could really use your help.<eos> You know, if you stuck around...<eos> I can't.<eos> I have to go to the man village.<eos> For what reason, man village?
I can make it real good for you here.<eos> Where else you gonna go?<eos> I'll go back to the pack!<eos> I'll go back to akela!<eos> Akela?
Because I don't...<eos> - Trust?<eos> - No.<eos> Your leader?<eos> Your fellow Horsemen?
Everybody spread out!<eos> Nobody leaves this barge!<eos> Rhodes, hold it right there!<eos> This contains everything.<eos> Not just Walter and Tressler, but all their dealings.
Stokes' theorem is the remarkable statement that the line integral of F along C is equal to the flux integral of the curl of F through the surface S, which we know is the surface integral of the normal component of the curl along the surface S.<eos> Up top! Up top!<eos> Layup!
Nasir Khan.<eos> Victim's name is Andrea Cornish.<eos> Spell it.<eos> 22 years old.<eos> N-a-s-i-r. - K-h-a-n.
So you did.<eos> Peace, Tribune.<eos> Have a good night.<eos> Good night.<eos> A coin for the ferryman.
Right now.<eos> Or show me the body.<eos> He must have shed the snake skin.<eos> God is not on my beck and call.<eos> God?
I was present.<eos> I helped.<eos> I know.<eos> What is that you seek, Clavius?<eos> Certainty, peace...
Let's get you a drive before you freeze.<eos> Captain, the Mayor and Chief McKelly, come down here to meet you.<eos> I can't, because it was a domestic flight!<eos> Yeah, we have no doubts, but we have to track the passengers informations down.<eos> One by one!
I'll tell you what I think.<eos> I'm just so damn proud.<eos> You were right there, with all those distractions.<eos> We did this together like a team.<eos> Thanks Sully.
Good evening.<eos> Is auntie in?<eos> Put that away.<eos> Are you who I think you are?<eos> Unfortunately.
Don't wet your knickers, it's treatable.<eos> Heroin.<eos> That stuffs addictive, it's a gateway drug.<eos> - To what?<eos> - To more heroin.
Can you zoom in on that stationery?<eos> Send the coordinates to Chilcott.<eos> You'd rather make love to a maid than me?<eos> Maid?<eos> Banu, out!
Now, Lehnsherr escaped and became the world's most-wanted fugitive.<eos> And as for her, she disappeared as well.<eos> But she has become the symbol of a new age... the face of a world that will never be the same again.<eos> You winking at my girl?<eos> Your girl?
I'm fine.<eos> Okay.<eos> Everyone, eyes front.<eos> Pi is the ratio of the conference, and when it all...<eos> Careful, O'Malley.
I'm sorry to interrupt this weird love connection, but we are in a hurry.<eos> If we do not do something soon, that asteroid will destroy everything.<eos> It seems urgent.<eos> - It is better to take you to him.<eos> - Who? your leader?
- This is not possible.<eos> - Sure it is. I have 326 years!<eos> You do not seem to have more than 275 years.<eos> We are young, happy, safe and always will be.<eos> Thanks to Geotopia!
How did you find me?<eos> Have you tasted the shrimp?<eos> Close this delicious little mouth and just listen to me.<eos> This dedicated to the man of my dreams<eos> That guy?
Mmm. You make the best pie, honey.<eos> Listen, Norman, I know it's short notice, but I could really use some help with the kids tomorrow because, well, you are not going to believe what I did today.<eos> Norman, are you listening to me?<eos> Rehearsals begin first thing tomorrow morning, so get some sleep, and dream big dreams!<eos> Dreams, dreams!
I thought that was yourjob.<eos> I know how you lost.<eos> You looked for him at 90 meters, and it cost you the race.<eos> He's got no goddamn business beating you.<eos> Who, Peacock?
So, you've been embedded before, then?<eos> Not really.<eos> We all did hostile-zone training in 2001.<eos> They taught us to open our mouths if we get mortared...<eos> That kind of stuff.
Thanks.<eos> You shaved your face.<eos> I don't hate you.<eos> I just wish you'd helped mom.<eos> Me too.
Nice to see you, too.<eos> Sorry, I'm not exactly myself this morning.<eos> That's a matter of opinion.<eos> - They brought it to me.<eos> - To you?
Well she bought me a kitten, actually.<eos> Dad, kitten.<eos> Kitten, Dad.<eos> You must have missed him.<eos> My dad?
- You can't--<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - Have a great day. - Okay.<eos> All right.<eos> And you.
Are you okay?<eos> Rachel, open the door.<eos> I have a stomach flu.<eos> Okay?<eos> I just...
Did Megan ever say anything about me to you?<eos> She loved you.<eos> She loved you in ways that people only dream of being loved.<eos> You shouldn't be here.<eos> I just...
Give them to him.<eos> Behind the jail!<eos> The Resistance are running behind the jail!<eos> The Krauts are in the square!<eos> A grenade.
Why do you ask?<eos> I should run.<eos> - No, no, no.<eos> Wait.<eos> - No, I really...
There's an exhibition soon, though.<eos> You should come.<eos> I swear to God, a fox and two weasels in the freezer and a barbecued deer in the garden.<eos> And you're saying that, pending blood results, Craig's story checks out?<eos> This part of it, at least.
Luck of the draw, old man.<eos> One was damned and one was saved.<eos> The toss of a single coin!<eos> Not me.<eos> Jesus! Bit before his time, actually.
I'll be seeing you.<eos> The item is... ..a gentleman's wallet!<eos> And now for my next trick, I require the assistance of a beautiful women and a very brave gentleman. Yes!<eos> Madame.<eos> You!
Hindus believe in the purification and reincarnation of the soul.<eos> That can never happen to Oliver now... because he has returned to this life.<eos> Instead, his soul will putrefy.<eos> You have seen her, haven't you?<eos> Myrtu.
I knew your last word would be shit.<eos> Okay.<eos> You made your point.<eos> How much is this gonna cost me?<eos> Your life.
A video game I produced.<eos> Yeah?<eos> I bet you were the cutest knight in armor.<eos> Not too shabby.<eos> Nice, huh?
Cognac?<eos> - Love one.<eos> - Same glass okay?<eos> Cognac anyone?<eos> - Me, please.
Her chicken salad gave me horrific gas.<eos> You forgot it?<eos> How can you be such an idiot?<eos> Three times I reminded you.<eos> At home and in the car.
To whom do you want us to offer safe haven and amnesty?<eos> - To Selene the Death Dealer.<eos> - The same Selene who murdered Viktor?<eos> I need no reminder, Cassius, of what she has done.<eos> Shame on you, sir.
- Thank you.<eos> Yeah. Thanks so much for letting us in.<eos> We have just about everything. What would you like?<eos> I'll take a beer if you have it.<eos> - How about you?
It'd be a belief in me, you know.<eos> I come from nothing, ma'am.<eos> Like I'm an impoverished youth, bottom barrel, and this would be my chance to, like, achieve something more with myself.<eos> - And what do you plan to study?<eos> - Politics.
Jake?<eos> I know.<eos> I'm on it.<eos> All right, blank-to-blank for Sean.<eos> Blank-to-blank for Sean.
- I'll get the charcoal.<eos> - Is this your dog?<eos> Have to get that stuff out of your truck.<eos> - Come on. - Hi.<eos> This way then.
- It is treasure.<eos> All this stuff is from the houses?<eos> Mmm-hmm. Yeah.<eos> You think they're gonna miss any of this stuff?<eos> - Who?
All this stuff is from the houses?<eos> Mmm-hmm. Yeah.<eos> You think they're gonna miss any of this stuff?<eos> - Who?<eos> - The people.
Could someone please help me up?<eos> Is that man all right?<eos> Get it out, rookie.<eos> You'll get used to it...<eos> Unfortunately.
Yeah and I saw firsthand how the hospitality industry can really bring infrastructure to communities that need it.<eos> But I also saw a lot of problems that they cause, which is why community groups need to be, involved every step of the way, and they need to be taken seriously.<eos> And?<eos> I guess I want to help facilitate that and help give them a voice.<eos> Saroo.
You go for the Aussies or the Indians?<eos> Only the Aussies, mate!<eos> Only the Aussies, mate!<eos> This is going to be interesting.<eos> Okay, Saroo...
It's One Day International (cricket) tomorrow.<eos> You can come over if you like?<eos> I meant to tell you, I fixed the tiller.<eos> Why don't we take her out? We can head up the coast?<eos> Hey, Saroo...
I'm here.<eos> So this is where you've been.<eos> I don't want you to feel, I was ungrateful.<eos> There wasn't a day, I didn't want to tell you.<eos> Saroo.
You can't take them away.<eos> You.<eos> Stay here.<eos> We need to check your diagnostics.<eos> Diagnostics?
You're clear!<eos> All right, let's go!<eos> Come on. Move, move, move.<eos> 925-H to transport control.<eos> 925-H to transport control.
So you wanna be Special Forces? -Sir, yes sir!<eos> I think Special Forces would be ashamed to call you soldiers!<eos> Am I right?<eos> Sir, no, sir.<eos> Your left.
I think Special Forces would be ashamed to call you soldiers!<eos> Am I right?<eos> Sir, no, sir.<eos> Your left.<eos> Your left right. Your left.
Do not tell truth to power.<eos> We'll hammer you.<eos> There's a new program being developed at the NSA's ops center on Oahu.<eos> You'd be going up against Chinese cyber divisions.<eos> You interested?
Thank you. IÕll have additional questions to give you in writing on that point...<eos> Okay, so uh, what I wanted to show you guys is uh, this slide I ran across while building this indexing program.<eos> And what is this?<eos> -OK, so this is data collection for the month of March.<eos> Worldwide.
Yeah, she said if she's not on her cell, I'm told I might find her here.<eos> Not anymore. - Okay well, if you do talk to her...<eos> - I won't.<eos> could you tell her Jane and Amy Brandt casting is trying to reach her.<eos> Casting?
# Crazy as they may seem #<eos> # Here's to the hearts that break #<eos> # Here's to the mess we make #<eos> # I trace it all back to then #<eos> # Her, and the snow, and the Seine #
Food's the last thing on my mind, Spencer.<eos> Okay, um, well then I'm gonna go over the Mary Drake file again.<eos> - Maybe there's something...<eos> - Alright, great.<eos> Bye to you too.
You gave me all the information.<eos> I thought that's what you wanted.<eos> What?<eos> Now, I'm very sorry that you didn't get the message.<eos> Me, too.
- I'm a seven!<eos> - Six.<eos> - Seven!<eos> Whoa, whoa, whoa. Jesus Christ!<eos> One at a time!
If I don't, we won't get to live in such a nice house.<eos> I hate this house.<eos> We're not even supposed to be here.<eos> - Go to Janet's.<eos> - Jessica's.
- He likes my dad a lot, too.<eos> Maybe they should get married.<eos> So, you know the old lady, right?<eos> - Did you believe her?<eos> - What about?
But I wanna know if I can trust you.<eos> I'm kinda getting the idea that, you know, you might not have much choice.<eos> Well, my situation is very delicate.<eos> Hey, that's where I know you from, right?<eos> The TV.
Gotta act like you're onto something, like you've been working hard.<eos> Then, day three, ask for more money.<eos> Well, she's putting a negative spin on it, but, yeah, that's the idea.<eos> Kuttner paid us.<eos> Me.
It's a dump.<eos> Fuck it, I'll show you.<eos> Holly, go to Janet's this time.<eos> - But for real.<eos> - Jessica's.
Fuck it, I'll show you.<eos> Holly, go to Janet's this time.<eos> - But for real.<eos> - Jessica's.<eos> Jessica's.
Why would she send us off on some wild fucking goose chase?<eos> Amelia.<eos> - No, like The Waltons.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> Yeah, on TV.
It seems to me I'm worth it.<eos> No doubt.<eos> I'll really count on that, coronel.<eos> Mr. Novikov has... Had a post of supervision board president and owned 8 % of shares, the so-called golden share.<eos> This way.
I'm listening to you.<eos> What will you say?<eos> A high-quality Chinese counterfeit.<eos> I hope it's not for me?<eos> No, not for you.
He underwent plastic surgery to change his appearance.<eos> He told me so himself.<eos> Let's say so.<eos> How do we prove that the psychiatrist is Salamatin?<eos> By fingerprints.
Needs must when the devil drives, Watson.<eos> Ma'am.<eos> I'm part of a campaign, you know.<eos> Huh? Campaign?<eos> Votes for women.
Why else the portentous threat?<eos> "This night you will die." But he won't follow her, surely?<eos> It's difficult to say quite what he'll do.<eos> Guilt is eating away at his soul.<eos> Guilt? About what?
I will run along behind you like some halfwit, making you look clever, if that's what you need.<eos> But dear God above! You will hold yourself to a higher standard.<eos> - Why?<eos> - Because people need you to.<eos> What people, why?
Civil war is raging in the new Republic of the Congo.<eos> But United Nations peacekeeping troops show they mean business.<eos> Here they are moving in on rebel-held government buildings in Elisabethville... capital of the province of Katanga.<eos> The world waits to see what General Tshombe will do next.<eos> Madame.
Somewhere neutral.<eos> Just the two of us.<eos> They're coming!<eos> Get ready for it!<eos> Into your trenches!
Ever see a rhino charge?<eos> That hurts.<eos> - I like it!<eos> - Me, too!<eos> Me, too.
Good for you.<eos> Y'all got jokes?<eos> Well, let's see how funny you are after we bash your heads in!<eos> Watch it!<eos> Careful!
They were all gone.<eos> The world I'd left only moments ago was now dust.<eos> You all right, ma'am?<eos> Are you all right?<eos> Ma'am?
- You're right. ...a perspective manipulator...<eos> That's a guy who's, uh, slightly shorter than Conner who he pays to stand near him at events to make him look taller.<eos> You know, back in my high school days I was in a band.<eos> You may have heard of them, called Tony!<eos> Toni!
Tonee?<eos> We broke up over creative differences.<eos> Each Tony had an exclamation point after their name, and I thought my name should have a question mark.<eos> So it would be T ony!<eos> Toni!
You've just got to learn how to ride the wave, you know.<eos> Up and down, just like that.<eos> Tony!<eos> Toni!<eos> Tone!
Take care of your family tonight.<eos> If you can give me a call, we'll have someone bring you in,<eos> - ask you a few questions at a better time.<eos> - Do you work, ma'am?<eos> What? No, why?
You all right?<eos> - It was the kid. - Yeah.<eos> Fucking GI Joe motherfucker.<eos> - I was just starting to like that kid.<eos> - Yeah, me too, my friend, me too.
My soul to heaven, my curse upon your heads!<eos> Here's for my father's death!<eos> And here's to right our gentle-hearted King!<eos> Here's to avenge beloved Somerset.<eos> Off with his head.
Some third-rate porn.<eos> I guess your men... I think they got all the good stuff.<eos> Why did you go back to Julie Mao's apartment?<eos> I'm gonna come clean.<eos> Embarrassing... But...
We're ready for the next phase.<eos> We need to get a sample off Phoebe, now!<eos> You tell anyone about this?<eos> No.<eos> Just you.
Open the door.<eos> I'm taking this one for a walk.<eos> And where's my damn hat?<eos> Hey, give me a number four, bare, in a bowl.<eos> Uh...
Hey! Yeah!<eos> Come on in. Yeah!<eos> Yeah!<eos> Awesome.<eos> Awesome. Well...
But a woman of your distinction... and with child, no less...<eos> it is just not done.<eos> Fine.<eos> I will endeavor to be sloppier in my personal habits.<eos> Oh, Madame.
The last time I had been here was during the delirious celebration marking the end of the Second World War.<eos> I had hoped to climb to the top of the Eiffel Tower, but the Nazis had closed it during the occupation, and it had yet to reopen.<eos> Now I had arrived a hundred years before it existed.<eos> _<eos> Madame?
I had hoped to climb to the top of the Eiffel Tower, but the Nazis had closed it during the occupation, and it had yet to reopen.<eos> Now I had arrived a hundred years before it existed.<eos> _<eos> Madame?<eos> Madame?
That's right, my ad.<eos> That's right, "FM".<eos> Black.<eos> You lost it?<eos> A tramp?
Same background, same schools, same society parties.<eos> But one word out of place and they turn on me.<eos> All I need is a yellow star.<eos> Why...are you Jewish?<eos> You all right, dear?
- Well then, give them more.<eos> Why? Think of the shareholders.<eos> And why not?<eos> How would you like a rise?<eos> Me?
OK.<eos> Isabel!<eos> Thank you. Thank you.<eos> Damn it.<eos> Scotty!
Isabel!<eos> Thank you. Thank you.<eos> Damn it.<eos> Scotty!<eos> Scotty!
Tell them I'll call them tonight.<eos> Talk about arrangements.<eos> Somebody should call my wife.<eos> Your, uh...<eos> Ex-wife.
It's late.<eos> Better get a move on.<eos> Hank, thanks to you,<eos> I'm gonna get to see her soon...<eos> for real.
- My plane leaves at 10.<eos> - Did you tell her I'm here?<eos> - It does not matter.<eos> I'll call Inge.<eos> Who?
My Skype's working again.<eos> - She shouldn't work so hard.<eos> - She's doing great.<eos> Come in.<eos> In your basket.
- No.<eos> Yes.<eos> This is... very healthy.<eos> You sit down. Please take notes, would you?<eos> Just a few notes.
Benjamin's making a list.<eos> Yes, I'll think about it.<eos> Go visit him.<eos> He'll be happy.<eos> Yes, on occasion...
- No.<eos> In fact, I don't think you've ever really fucked up on a job.<eos> So if you reach out to me and you say that you genuinely want my help, that you're ready to glue your fuckin' life back together,<eos> there's absolutely no way I can fuckin' say no to that.<eos> Deal?
I'm gonna try and expedite, get that cab back to your father as soon as possible.<eos> I know how important that is.<eos> We're both working men.<eos> Your lawyer tell you not to talk to me anymore?<eos> Not even casually?
Just curious.<eos> Friend of the family, or right place, right time?<eos> Right place, right time.<eos> Right place, right time.<eos> Good for you.
Thank you, Your Highness, but I came to visit you, not your trees.<eos> What, you have something against trees?<eos> Ali Khan is afraid of trees, Mr. Nakhararyan.<eos> Not exactly, but what others feel for trees, I feel for the desert.<eos> The desert?
I don't think this war is any of our business.<eos> At least I won't have to go back to school.<eos> Beautiful.<eos> When will you go and see him?<eos> My father?
Please, take these instruments inside and sterilize them.<eos> Our job is to protect the old town.<eos> Nobody gets past us and nobody fires until they get the order.<eos> Get ready.<eos> To your positions.
Come on.<eos> ( growling )<eos> ( loud thudding )<eos> ( shouting )<eos> Attack!
Cool.<eos> I'd like to give his loving parents some idea of what it's gonna cost, and to do that, it'd be helpful to know how strong a case you think it is.<eos> - Strong.<eos> - Strong?<eos> Or strong?
I got to get you outta here.<eos> Yeah, but they're at both entrances.<eos> Then I'm gonna Purge by killing you and burning this bitch to the ground!<eos> I gotta call her.<eos> Who?
Hold off on burning my body for now.<eos> That's funny.<eos> You sure that's still you in there?<eos> You all right?<eos> Yes.
I'll stay in Oldtown, then.<eos> By yourself?<eos> With a baby and no money?<eos> So if we're not going to Oldtown, where are you taking me?<eos> To my home.
You won't be here forever.<eos> You won't be an old man in a tree.<eos> But before you leave, you must learn.<eos> Learn what?<eos> Everything.
What about Myrcella's death, Uncle?<eos> Do you consider the murder of your own blood a troublesome issue?<eos> The same women who murdered Myrcella have overthrown House Martell and taken control of Dorne.<eos> We've got a lot to discuss.<eos> All of us together.
Where's your associate?<eos> The one who met with my parents.<eos> Oh, she's just... she's in court.<eos> They liked her.<eos> My parents.
But you wouldn't know that, seeing as you live in...<eos> Holland Park.<eos> Is she your boss?<eos> No.<eos> Fortunately.
- I'll be asleep when she's born.<eos> You'll look after her?<eos> - I will.<eos> - I've come to enquire about Baby Cottingham.<eos> - Baby Cottingham?
And I had to pack it in to do my national service.<eos> I spent two years in Kinloss with a Dansette with a broken needle and a pile of jazz LPs I couldn't play.<eos> And then God came calling, and he was a bit of a taskmaster.<eos> And don't get me started on girls.<eos> Nor me.
He treats me like a princess.<eos> This was his mother's house.<eos> He said no other woman would ever live here, and then he met me.<eos> And he lets me live here like the lady of the house.<eos> Me!
I've got one cable running into the delivery room -- there's a mother who still needs stitches -- and we need a working light in the ward!<eos> Doctor, Mrs Mansoor's baby's crowning!<eos> Some people have parents who do ordinary jobs.<eos> Get cranking the handle.<eos> Sooner them than me!
You can't go on like this.<eos> - She's sad.<eos> - She instills mystery.<eos> - Yes.<eos> - And melancholy too.
Gustav Meyer.<eos> It's warm.<eos> Martínez!<eos> Police!<eos> Against the wall.
I know this young brother.<eos> He'll eat five hamburgers.<eos> I've seen you do it.<eos> Now, Harlem is a community that welcomes everyone.<eos> All people.
Count down your days.<eos> [Squabbles] Man, you outta your mind?<eos> You mean to tell me... [stuttering] this cover of Rolling Stone with Lisa Bonet, and... the hair, the...<eos> the nakedness, her eyes on me...<eos> - On you?
[Squabbles] Man, you outta your mind?<eos> You mean to tell me... [stuttering] this cover of Rolling Stone with Lisa Bonet, and... the hair, the...<eos> the nakedness, her eyes on me...<eos> - On you?<eos> - On me!
Call Mr. Spurlock.<eos> Tell him we gonna need his services.<eos> - [both grunting] - Get off!<eos> - You got problems with the tax?<eos> - Holler at your man Luke Cage...
Tell him we gonna need his services.<eos> - [both grunting] - Get off!<eos> - You got problems with the tax?<eos> - Holler at your man Luke Cage...<eos> - Holler at Luke Cage...
Why do you think we're talking?<eos> This is why you need to learn how to text.<eos> You always think the worst.<eos> - What do you need, Mami?<eos> - Not me, you.
Our ride's here.<eos> Yeah.<eos> No, no, no, just come around the back.<eos> No.<eos> Around the back.
School clothes?<eos> Mama Mabel Stokes.<eos> Your old man put his hands on you?<eos> See Mama Mabel Stokes... and it would never, ever happen again.<eos> - Your point?
We have no other choice.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> - Tony.<eos> - Yes, ma'am.
Every time...<eos> You know the rule, baby.<eos> Family first.<eos> Always.<eos> Yes, ma'am.
Hope they get that bastard.<eos> He's bad for business.<eos> Well, yeah, I'm not here to talk about Luke Cage.<eos> Well, it took a lot for you to walk through those doors without your people.<eos> Chico, please.
Who's this?<eos> You tell me.<eos> Look, I saw you with Cottonmouth.<eos> I heard about your little beef.<eos> Beef?
James...<eos> Carl needs you now more than ever.<eos> How can you be here for your community and every other family in the congregation, but you're never here for us?<eos> Stay out of grown folks' business.<eos> Yes, ma'am.
This is a prewar prohibition building.<eos> There's a storage space underneath.<eos> Employees used to go down there to fool around or sleep between shifts when we had to prep a big event.<eos> So it's downstairs in the basement? Where?<eos> By the staff lockers.
All those times she brought you a cup of coffee?<eos> She brought everyone a cup of coffee.<eos> - Really? - Yeah.<eos> - Didn't she?<eos> - No. Just you.
- She thinks we're trying to get her money. - She doesn't trust him.<eos> - You gotta talk to her. - You talk to her.<eos> - Talk to her, please.<eos> - I'm gonna hand you to the head bandit.<eos> - Hello, ma'am. - Eleanor.
Who gives a fuck?<eos> She owe you money?<eos> I don't allow for that. How about you?<eos> You owe anybody money?<eos> Yeah. To my landlord.
I don't allow for that. How about you?<eos> You owe anybody money?<eos> Yeah. To my landlord.<eos> No one else?<eos> Your supplier?
I can't really go out at night.<eos> Not ever?<eos> Not even for, say, prom?<eos> Would you go with me, Charlie?<eos> I...
It's too bad.<eos> Just know this, Cartman...<eos> I'm going to prove who skankhunk42 is, whatever it takes.<eos> Everyone is going to know, and skankhunt is gonna pay for everything he's ever said.<eos> Hello, everyone.
- Excuse me?<eos> - You've fuckin' changed.<eos> Oi!<eos> Do you have any idea the shit you've put us through?<eos> Me.
- You've fuckin' changed.<eos> Oi!<eos> Do you have any idea the shit you've put us through?<eos> Me.<eos> Your ma.
Oi!<eos> Do you have any idea the shit you've put us through?<eos> Me.<eos> Your ma.<eos> All of us.
I can still see the look she gave me that day.<eos> We had to do it, it was the only-<eos> The only way was to keep her at home!<eos> Any idea where she could have gone?<eos> Family, friends?
My name is Charlotte, I'm 15 and anorexic.<eos> And my parents are a pain.<eos> No reply yet.<eos> Can we find out whose blog this is?<eos> With an international warrant.
Thinking this one's still thirsty.<eos> Not gonna die this time, Arnold.<eos> Ain't nothing gonna kill me.<eos> You can't have none.<eos> Ain't for you.
- You keep saying that, Gary.<eos> - Because it was.<eos> Held her down, did you?<eos> Forced her jaw open.<eos> Little girl like that.
Do you know it?<eos> Think so.<eos> When I take you, you'd have to promise not to tell anyone.<eos> Stuff there I wanna show you.<eos> But only you.
I don't know.<eos> What, you haven't seen her today?<eos> Not since last night.<eos> At the party.<eos> What party?
The old Sullivan's house.<eos> You know it?<eos> If I take you to them you have to promise me you won't tell anyone.<eos> I want to show you.<eos> But only you.
- Yeah.<eos> Every bloody greenie who stepped foot in the forest.<eos> - Why aren't you talking to them?<eos> Max.<eos> I, erm...
For his big night.<eos> Fergus isn't here.<eos> Yeah, I'm not looking for him.<eos> What do you want?<eos> You?
Yeah, let's go check with Renae first.<eos> Make sure Eliza had access to the car that night.<eos> No one goes inside until forensics get here<eos> We've been waiting for you.<eos> Lofty?
You can be an extraordinary doctor.<eos> I don't want that anymore.<eos> - Well, what do you want?<eos> - I want to know who I am.<eos> - The truth.
Well, here we go, boys.<eos> Here you go, stumpy.<eos> Here you go, Swede.<eos> Come and get it.<eos> All right, one at a time. One at...
For yours.<eos> And, the bodies you have piled up do not disappear when you bury them away,<eos> out of sight.<eos> And you bring death everywhere.<eos> You scared?
Credit Mobilier.<eos> Credit Mobilier is a worthless shell.<eos> I want the real thing.<eos> I want legitimacy.<eos> I...
That means we can stop it.<eos> Unlike an earthquake or a typhoon.<eos> Protecting citizens is our top priority.<eos> It's a tough decision, Sir, but to prevent further calamity your authorization is needed.<eos> Right this instant?
"I did as I pleased.<eos> You do the same."<eos> His last words?<eos> Confirm the contents?<eos> No need.
Asaka is working on details.<eos> Vehicle operation... and explosives drills have already been conducted.<eos> We're execution ready.<eos> Many thanks.<eos> No need.
That's good news for Tokyo residents.<eos> Thank god. GSDF Nerima Base, Nerima Ward<eos> Good work.<eos> The Satomi cabinet will be resigning en masse.<eos> In line with your scenario?
There's ...<eos> They will never find us.<eos> Yes, I'll ... I'll destroy it immediately, I promise.<eos> I know.<eos> You, too.
I'll give all the money I raised to the boys and girls club,<eos> - and you don't tell my mom.<eos> - I'll make you a deal.<eos> You give me all the money you made, I'll give it to the boys and girls club, and I may not tell your mom.<eos> Deal.
I've got too much to do.<eos> Kent. Didn't we talk about personal space and professional behavior?<eos> Yes, and I'm just taking your temperature.<eos> And you have a fever.<eos> Ibuprofen?
- Yep, and he entered the country on a tourist visa about a year ago.<eos> So Katrin didn't have her son living with her.<eos> It was her nephew.<eos> And if Nicky's hurt and all of his friends are after him, there's only one place that he would turn for help.<eos> Good old Aunt Katrin.
What?<eos> Yeah, well, I don't know what to say.<eos> Can I call you right back?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yep. Right back.
- So it wasn't an affair.<eos> Well, he was kind of cheating on his business partner.<eos> Yeah, he told the heiress that his partner, Park, was more interested in executive perks than in the mission itself.<eos> Our guy wanted to start over, downsize the administrative costs of the NGO.<eos> Oh. So bye-bye parties and photo ops.
Mark?<eos> Yeah?<eos> We got to withdraw from the case.<eos> They kicked it upstairs.<eos> To who?
Yeah?<eos> We got to withdraw from the case.<eos> They kicked it upstairs.<eos> To who?<eos> Detective Vannatter.
Shoot out his tires.<eos> We don't want a shootout on live TV.<eos> We're on every network in the country.<eos> What's the protocol?<eos> The protocol?
- They're not gonna love him once they see those crime - scene photos.<eos> - I have no doubt you're gonna put him behind bars, but nobody in America is gonna vote to execute O.J. Simpson.<eos> Marcia, we can't even execute Charlie Manson.<eos> Great.<eos> Now, how about some good news?
It means nothing at all without a virtuous heart.<eos> Give me two eggrolls.<eos> - Don't...<eos> - I-I'm not starting out with one.<eos> One for dad.
But let me talk about those witnesses the prosecution didn't mention.<eos> Witnesses who will exonerate O.J. Simpson.<eos> One might wonder why the prosecution didn't bring to your attention Mary Anne Gerchas. Or Rosa Lopez.<eos> Or Joe Stellini.<eos> - Or Alan Austin. Or-- - Your Honor...
No.<eos> Man, you're good.<eos> You're real good.<eos> When this is all over, you should go to work for Johnnie.<eos> Both of you!
The white jurors get better treatment than us.<eos> Okay, now, that is a very serious charge, 45...<eos> Okay, can you... just please elaborate for me?<eos> Well, like, when they took us out shopping, they gave them an hour at Target and only gave us 30 minutes at Ross!<eos> Them?
Okay, now, that is a very serious charge, 45...<eos> Okay, can you... just please elaborate for me?<eos> Well, like, when they took us out shopping, they gave them an hour at Target and only gave us 30 minutes at Ross!<eos> Them?<eos> Us? Uh...
We're very proud of them.<eos> And we stand here in front of you with our heads held high.<eos> I'd like to give Marcia the opportunity to say thank you.<eos> I first want to extend my deepest thanks to the families of the victims.<eos> To the Goldmans and to the Browns.
And only his judgment concerns me.<eos> Shall we throw him through the Moon Door?<eos> My lord.<eos> My lord, I have always been faithful to House Arryn.<eos> To your father, to your mother, and now to you.
That's all right.<eos> There are more important things.<eos> A letter for you, Lord Commander.<eos> I'm not Lord Commander anymore.<eos> "To the traitor and bastard Jon Snow.
It's been in our family for 500 years.<eos> It's Valyrian steel.<eos> Only a handful of them left in the world.<eos> It's supposed to go to my firstborn son after I die.<eos> To him.
But then, we all live complicated lives, don't we?<eos> You've brought us 100 ships from the Iron Fleet with men to sail them.<eos> In return, I expect you want me to support your claim to the throne of the Iron Islands?<eos> Not my claim.<eos> Hers.
Yes, well, I suppose that life is irregular.<eos> The archmaester will discuss these irregularities with you.<eos> In the meantime, you are permitted to use the library.<eos> Follow me.<eos> No women or children.
It has witnessed life and death on a scale impossible to fathom.<eos> Yet in order to confront its power, you must learn to control your own.<eos> How?<eos> Practice.<eos> On you?
The Ellcrys is this city's only chance.<eos> (soldier) What are those creatures doing here?<eos> The Gnomes come in peace, to fight the Demons as our allies.<eos> They've pledged an oath to the King.<eos> The true King.
How do you know my name?<eos> Your friends are in danger.<eos> What do you know about my friends?<eos> Don't trust him.<eos> Who?
That can't be the deal.<eos> That can't be it.<eos> I know it's, like, not appropriate to be standing up here in a bathing suit... but I took an Ambien tonight.<eos> I... I was supposed to go to sleep, but then he called me to come here.<eos> -I'm really sorry.
I kept her in my pocket.<eos> She was only, like, this big.<eos> Okay.<eos> Kubo, that's enough.<eos> Tiny.
We'll tell him everything he needs to know.<eos> You are the kindest, sweetest man to ever live in this village.<eos> - Uh, uh... every day, you walk around smiling and handing out coins to children.<eos> Like me!<eos> And old women.
Whether to keep us in the dark ages?<eos> Guys, I'm trying to bring us into the future.<eos> Okay, that's great, Captain Video, but while you're over there in the future, I'm here in the present trying to keep the fucking lights on.<eos> Okay, so do Status Quo make any money?<eos> - Not really.
Then we got money to bring in new acts so we can promote the shit out of them like you keep telling me you want to do, but, poor you, I never give you the firepower.<eos> Right, right, 'cause it's all about you making my dreams come true.<eos> - Yeah, right.<eos> Who's next? - The album?<eos> - On your list.
Damien...<eos> Towards the face, keep your hands like that.<eos> Open and short strokes.<eos> And so the body...<eos> The body now.
I thought you were arrogant.<eos> I did not like the way you looked at me.<eos> I am now to you.<eos> I am now accustomed.<eos> Like that earring.
You cannot stay here.<eos> You are a danger to the cause.<eos> - I seek safe passage.<eos> - To where?<eos> To the Boy Emperor, Zhao Xian.
120 meters... 110.<eos> They're our people.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> We hope they're our people.<eos> On my command.
Damn him.<eos> - He as good as called me a liar!<eos> - Come, come. Drink up.<eos> Some of us know a hero when we meet one.<eos> "To Prince Nikolai Andreyich Bolkonsky.
You want to bet?<eos> Absolutely.<eos> Okay, Frank.<eos> So if Mac and I can live here for a month, then you have to pay our rent for an entire year.<eos> Deal.
I'll take some side action.<eos> No...<eos> Tell you what. How about if they win, I'll take that California king bed for myself.<eos> Fine, and if they lose, the three of you got to sleep with the old man.<eos> Fine. Deal.
I don't know how much more of that I can take before I stab him in the neck with a broken beer bottle.<eos> - What are you smiling about?<eos> - I'm happy.<eos> - Can't I be happy?<eos> - No, not about this.
- Moss.<eos> Mind you, I think Tom enjoys the sport.<eos> Something like that.<eos> - Goodnight, Arthur.<eos> - 'Night.
Are you in or out, Charlie?<eos> Curly?<eos> - Shouldn't have killed the stag, Tommy.<eos> - Oh, shut up.<eos> - Bad luck...
We need to dig a hole.<eos> Arthur agreed to a plan with a figure of 25.<eos> 25 from 150 is 125.<eos> A third of that is... £41,000<eos> Sugar?
All of a sudden, back in the family, Ada.<eos> Eh?<eos> That's a surprise.<eos> Out of the blue.<eos> On whose orders?
I'm just a convict.<eos> Tonight's movie night.<eos> Everyone in the main hall together with the lights off.<eos> Be ready.<eos> For what?
The painting is entitled "Mad Grey Dawn"<eos> and depicted a railway explosion at the turn of the century.<eos> A minor work compared to much of the collection.<eos> Strangely, he simply defaced two much more valuable paintings in another section of the gallery.<eos> A Marché and a LaRue.
Pretty cool, right?<eos> Totally.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Listen, if you give us the coffee can and close your eyes, you'll be able to fly.<eos> Sweet.
Why are you here?<eos> Pinkney sent me a message.<eos> Wanted to talk outside of work.<eos> About what?<eos> You.
A toast.<eos> I want to thank you all for your generosity.<eos> You have welcomed Oswald into our family with open arms and open hearts.<eos> And for that, I am truly blessed.<eos> To family.
Uh, you guys have made me the happiest man on the planet.<eos> I am so grateful.<eos> I love you all.<eos> Family.<eos> To family.
You.<eos> Guess what.<eos> I knew that you knew that I knew.<eos> That's why your chair was wired to the mains.<eos> *Over the pavement and down the alley*
Is that it?<eos> You don't carry a badge anymore, partner, remember?<eos> Hmm? I think you need to grab a few items from the whammy drawer.<eos> Can you believe they let Barbara out of Arkham?<eos> First Penguin, then her?
Man!<eos> Give me Azrael, Galavan, or whoever the hell he was, over those jackals any day.<eos> You need to bring in Hugo Strange.<eos> Oh, yeah?<eos> On what charge?
You would be a wonderful addition to my staff, Ed, a wonderful addition, if you were only sane.<eos> - No, seriously...<eos> - Yes, seriously.<eos> You have been very useful, and we arrogant physicians have much to learn from a madman like you.<eos> But not that much.
Gordon and Wayne and Fox know nothing but mundanities.<eos> They have told no one the truth, because they have none of the truth.<eos> Our secret is safe.<eos> Kill them all, then continue with the evacuation of your test subjects.<eos> Yes, madam.
Charles!<eos> I just got an email from SAM-SAM.<eos> Rejected?<eos> I've never been rejected from anything.<eos> Me neither.
- Gross.<eos> Anyway, we have to work a stream of BE's on 4th Street.<eos> It's time for you to move on.<eos> It's what Jackson would've wanted.<eos> - Jason!
Sorry to say, it's very contagious.<eos> You may not want to be here, detective.<eos> - Oh, it's cool. I keep up to date on all my vaccinations.<eos> I'm immune to stuff you've never even heard of.<eos> - But not immune to braggadocio.
Of course. Get whatever you want.<eos> Oh, man, I already ate.<eos> I guess I'll just have a cheeseburger deluxe, couple slices of pie, maybe an egg cream.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - And a waffle.
- What?<eos> - Charles?<eos> Charles!<eos> Here, boy!<eos> Here, boy!
Actually, cashiers and bag boys need to be totally in sync...<eos> Shut up, Maggie.<eos> Look, man, you sacrificed 12 years of your life for the police department; you're a hero.<eos> I'm sorry that I didn't trust you.<eos> Yeah. Me too.
Yeah.<eos> When I was undercover, Jimmy "The Butcher"<eos> cut off my little toe with garden shears and made me eat it as a loyalty test.<eos> I've been through hell.<eos> Big deal.
Cultural figure.<eos> Generously supported the Federation, the Sisterhood lunch, the renovation of the Bessie Weinbaum memorial...<eos> Excuse me, are you Richard Finestra?<eos> He couldn't make it. Just... he wanted to be here.<eos> RABBI:
Hmm, sometime after 3:00.<eos> Come on.<eos> Kid's got to get more sleep.<eos> She's not gonna make it.<eos> Which kid, Debbie or the baby?
A big one.<eos> What about those two?<eos> - The black ones?<eos> - Yeah, they're cool.<eos> Tungsten.
Yeah.<eos> Yeah, I'm okay.<eos> I owe you an apology.<eos> Maybe I haven't been the best business partner.<eos> Business partner?
It's so fascinating... they're just like people.<eos> The love of animals is a different kind of love.<eos> People who don't love animals can't love people either.<eos> I know that much.<eos> Bengü!
The love of animals is a different kind of love.<eos> People who don't love animals can't love people either.<eos> I know that much.<eos> Bengü!<eos> Bengü!
Your episode.<eos> - Yeah. - Oh!<eos> I feel like you're about to blow up or something, man.<eos> Oh, I don't know.<eos> I just...
- Cut it out!<eos> - Just let me look!<eos> - It's my fucking computer!<eos> - God damn it.<eos> - Jesus. - Okay, hey.
The line is, "But are you sure we have the power to control them?"<eos> I know the goddamn line.<eos> Yeah, cut, cut.<eos> The timing's off anyway.<eos> Jesus.
Well, that's only when I'm invited.<eos> Which isn't often, to be honest.<eos> Who invites you?<eos> The second man at the British Embassy.<eos> Name?
But Freddie has a temper, as you can see. And he may come back.<eos> Well, don't worry.<eos> We'll take care of you.<eos> Would that be you and the Queen, Mr Pine?<eos> Madam.
Thank you.<eos> - Congratulations.<eos> - Congratulations.<eos> Who needs another drink?<eos> Oh, not for me.
No, he's bloody not!<eos> You're Pine, from Switzerland.<eos> - What are you doing here?<eos> - Sandy, we need to call the police.<eos> No police.
You're Pine, from Switzerland.<eos> - What are you doing here?<eos> - Sandy, we need to call the police.<eos> No police.<eos> No police.
- What's...<eos> - Dr Shimon?<eos> Drag him away from whatever Russian party he's currently at.<eos> You must have given them the fright of their lives.<eos> No police.

I'll pay for any damage done.<eos> Corky can sort the bill.<eos> Anyone you want us to call?<eos> A girlfriend?<eos> Family?
Any sign of him?<eos> - What went wrong?<eos> - Let me get this.<eos> He went off script.<eos> Way off script.
I don't know.<eos> I didn't do anything, I promise.<eos> I just deleted it.<eos> How much later did you delete it?<eos> A week?
I just deleted it.<eos> How much later did you delete it?<eos> A week?<eos> - You didn't show it to anyone?<eos> - No, no one.
Jesus.<eos> We need to get him buried quick.<eos> No one can know he was here.<eos> All right?<eos> Jesus.
It's southeast Turkey.<eos> We think it's somewhere near Kasmili.<eos> The trucks are heading towards the Syrian border.<eos> That's just over 200 miles.<eos> - Rough country.
- It's good.<eos> I got a lot of extra time, and I'm catching up on reading. I'm thinking of learning French. Parlez-vous ?<eos> I'm growing a garden.<eos> Growing kale.<eos> Kale?
Listen, uh, I would love to, uh, hang.<eos> You see how the bossman is, wants what he wants.<eos> I know.<eos> Was, um, was good to see you.<eos> You, too.
I'm a friend.<eos> Before you go, tell me about Damascus.<eos> Nothing happened.<eos> It's all right.<eos> You...
Ladies and gentlemen, keep moving, please.<eos> All other platforms remain open.<eos> I have to get approval.<eos> It's gonna be a minute.<eos> Nice, orderly fashion.
I'm... I'm... I'm begging you.<eos> - I don't know.<eos> I - gotta think Damien's right.<eos> There's an explanation for all of it.<eos> For all it?
I - gotta think Damien's right.<eos> There's an explanation for all of it.<eos> For all it?<eos> The notebook?<eos> The bird?
That is, a good deal, a very great deal actually.<eos> - How much?<eos> - 43,000.<eos> What?<eos> To whom?
I should make it clear if I were you you can't afford to be engaged to a girl with no money.<eos> You're not jealous, by any chance, are you?<eos> Me?<eos> Jealous?<eos> Of the little Rostov girl?
Not a beauty. But a prize, Boris.<eos> A prize.<eos> Best behaviour.<eos> - Prince Bolkonsky.<eos> - Madam.
She'll be out directly.<eos> You're to come with us, sir, to the Countess.<eos> No, that's not right, she's to...<eos> - What do you mean?<eos> What Countess?
Bald Hills must be defended, to the last man!<eos> Summon the militia!<eos> Give me my jacket.<eos> Not that one!<eos> The full dress uniform!
The peasants are making difficulties about the horses.<eos> You see? They know they, too, will be well-treated by my countrymen.<eos> The French will put us under their protection.<eos> Truly, Princess, it will be for<eos> - the best...
(INHALES) Gentlemen, with limited supplies and winter approaching, our position will deteriorate.<eos> Convey my compliments to all the regimental commanders.<eos> And instruct them to make ready.<eos> For what, sire?<eos> Retreat.
You didn't have to go then, you see.<eos> (WHISPERS) Love you.<eos> I love you, and now there's no one for me.<eos> But I will remember you.<eos> But not like this.
Right.<eos> - Wait.<eos> Who's first?<eos> - No, hold on a second.<eos> Shots. - Oh.
Well, here we go.<eos> To Brown and Gamby, partners in leadership.<eos> It sucks for Mr. Russell, but, oh, well.<eos> I don't drink.<eos> Not even on a special occasion?
What do you think it is?<eos> It's your new bike.<eos> Wait, what?<eos> - For me?<eos> - For you.
Oh, it'll cost you.<eos> Okay.<eos> We should discuss some sort of financial arrangement in which I...<eos> Well...<eos> Okay, then.
Don't need it.<eos> We can handle our business.<eos> Anyway, it takes hours.<eos> Collect the cash. Count it. Lie detector.<eos> One at a time.
¶ You'll hear me call you<eos> ¶ Singin' through the sunshine<eos> ¶ Sweet and clear as can be<eos> ¶ Bali Ha'i will whisper<eos> ¶ On the winds of the sea
What's wrong?<eos> You think I'm laying it on too thick?<eos> No, um...<eos> I just didn't realize how unhappy you were here.<eos> Not unhappy, per se.
Parker:<eos> He's on a five-lead now. We didn't get a twelve-lead. No.<eos> Dr. topolski:<eos> Okay, tricia, we're gonna need a twelve-lead.<eos> No EKG! No EKG. Tricia:
Shall I summon Monsieur Forez?<eos> No, I can handle it.<eos> I'll need a small scalpel, some alcohol, and cloth, please.<eos> While the tiny entrance wound had healed cleanly, the deeper wound had festered and formed a pocket of pus around the intrusion, buried in the muscle tissue where no surface symptoms were visible...<eos> To human senses, at least.
Call to him.<eos> Jamie!<eos> I don't know what he did or how he did it... But he healed me.<eos> Once more, he saved my life.<eos> Madame?
But he was provoked.<eos> As you know, he is a Scot.<eos> They are most fierce where questions of their honor are concerned.<eos> Quite so.<eos> Quite so, Madame.
And then you smash 'em in the face!<eos> You ought to practice till it's in ye.<eos> The men are coming along nicely.<eos> We should push on, join the prince with due haste.<eos> Christ.
So we'll just... we'll keep our emotions in check. Yeah.<eos> Sure. Just be like:<eos> (exhales) (all exhaling)<eos> Gentlemen, good luck to you.<eos> And to yous.
Sure. Just be like:<eos> (exhales) (all exhaling)<eos> Gentlemen, good luck to you.<eos> And to yous.<eos> And to yous all.
I'll be representing Liam McPoyle today.<eos> Well, he actually got pinkeye in his one good eye.<eos> The point is... you'll be dealing with me today.<eos> And you'll be dealing with me today.<eos> Jack Kelly, lawyer.
Your Honor, this is nonsense.<eos> Here, kitty.<eos> (mews)<eos> Here, kitty. Chase the laser beam, kitty. (gallery gasping and murmuring)<eos> Order.
Order.<eos> Your Honor, you've got a man speaking to a bird.<eos> And yet, you refuse to rule on me having to pay alimony to this cat.<eos> What is this? !<eos> Order!
It's a mockery of justice, Your Honor. This is ridiculous, and this...<eos> I said, order!<eos> (gallery clamoring) LAWYER: He's talking to the pigeon!<eos> I'm not paying alimony to a goddamn cat!<eos> Order!
It's not the bone that hurts, it's...<eos> The bile?<eos> It's better.<eos> Any nausea?<eos> A little, in the morning.
Twenty minutes.<eos> -OK, thanks.<eos> Why don't you talk to my doctor?<eos> Ask him if I really need another scan.<eos> Vlasceanu?
Thanks. The priest said he'll come around 12, but he couldn't say for sure.<eos> He doesn't know what the traffic will be like.<eos> I've my phone here.<eos> He'll call when he's on his way.<eos> What about Relu?
An old woman who wants to open her eyes!<eos> This is how you open her eyes? Upsetting her?<eos> Show some respect!<eos> -Respect for what?<eos> For this day!
You're unbelievable.<eos> Sandra...<eos> Mark my words, if you talk to her again, I'm out of here.<eos> And where will you go?<eos> Another night shift?
This is my seat! Move, I'll sit here!<eos> -Cut it out, Sebi!<eos> You're driving me nuts! Just sit!<eos> Enough!<eos> Comfy?
...then I saw for the first time that confused look on his face.<eos> He looked just as confused when I told him I got into university.<eos> But he confused me the most when he caught Relu smoking.<eos> I don't know if I told you...<eos> Relu the rebel?
Too high.<eos> You're aiming too high.<eos> Forget the rigging.<eos> Aim at his hull.<eos> At the waterline.
Just wanted you to know I... I got your back, bud.<eos> Oh, yeah, thanks, man, appreciate it.<eos> Yeah, hey, you know, I know it's cheesy, but I brought you Josh's patented cheer-up kit.<eos> Mm-hmm, sweet, could you, uh, bring it down and throw it in the hot air balloon?<eos> Hot air balloon?
Um... Get that seat!<eos> I will get that seat.<eos> - Gotta get that seat, Scotty.<eos> - That's my seat. - Nobody else touch it.<eos> - No.
Mm-hmm.<eos> So you followed the Buffett rule?<eos> (GUSTAV LAUGHS) Always, dude. 70/30, stocks to bonds.<eos> Buffet.<eos> Nice.
- You're okay.<eos> - You're okay.<eos> - Wait. Where's Scotty?<eos> BARB:<eos> Scotty!
Oh, my God.<eos> - Scotty!<eos> - He's under the moose!<eos> (STEPHANIE AND BARB SCREAM) He's under the moose!<eos> Scotty!
Whoa.<eos> But, Laird, Stephanie's right.<eos> It's up to her.<eos> It's always been up to her.<eos> Not us.
We've been married for 25 years, we have kids.<eos> You don't owe me any explanation.<eos> I can't lead a double life.<eos> It's not fair to you.<eos> Or to Karen, or to myself.
I will forget about it. Yeah.<eos> Yeah, I have to be honest...<eos> I'm in two minds,<eos> I feel sorry for you, but I'm also glad you don't have a boyfriend anymore.<eos> But by pure selfishness.
Do you remember making a confession?<eos> No.<eos> Can you provide a reasonable account of your behaviour around the time of the various alleged offences?<eos> No.<eos> Or your state of mind?
Morgan!<eos> Tranquilizers!<eos> Go!<eos> Now!<eos> Brenda.
About leaving with you.<eos> That's very sudden.<eos> Aren't you even going to order?<eos> Excuse me, could I have a gin martini, please?<eos> Of course, madam.
- That led us to Lisa Douglas.<eos> - And she led us to Kumulah.<eos> So... why are you interested in Kumulah?<eos> I'm sorry, you really think I'm going to tell you?<eos> Two boy scouts?
I don't know what the hell you think you're doing, but you may have compromised a major investigation.<eos> And I'm warning you, it doesn't stop here.<eos> Counter-terrorism?<eos> - Just had them on the phone.<eos> - What about?
- Nasdarovje.<eos> - So, they're moving in.<eos> - I don't get it.<eos> Why do you want them in your property?<eos> Those two little bastards?
Afraid.<eos> Did she speak to you?<eos> She was calling me.<eos> I think she wanted me to come to her.<eos> Towards the light.
You'll have it by tomorrow lunchtime.<eos> I'll transfer it myself.<eos> Why should I believe you?<eos> All right.<eos> Lunchtime tomorrow.
Flowers.<eos> He was the manager.<eos> He was on his way home when it happened.<eos> Um... Jenny, can you tell me anything about India?<eos> India?
- Mm! Would you like another drink?<eos> - Not really.<eos> Oh, go on. I've got another bottle.<eos> - No, no, I've got an early start.<eos> - Oh, yeah, me, too.
I was calling to wish you luck.<eos> Thanks.<eos> That's really thoughtful of you.<eos> - Have a good day, Dad.<eos> - You, too.
The perfect venue.<eos> Right after morning services.<eos> And with your family ties to Greater Page and the West Adams neighborhood...<eos> I'll save a pew down front for both of you.<eos> And your wives.
- Says he is.<eos> - Then I'm voting for him.<eos> - Doesn't mean he will.<eos> - I'll just have to roll the dice on that.<eos> Yeah. Me, too.
Harris.<eos> "Victim of the Night." R rated.<eos> Mr. and Mrs. Allen did have some mainstream dreams.<eos> Hard to leave that porn money behind.<eos> For him.
And how the killer got to and from the reef without anyone noticing?<eos> ! That as well.<eos> Although to prove it, I'm going to need some flight details.<eos> You are? I think there's a phone call we may need to make.<eos> Who to?
If you enjoy starving to death.<eos> Oh, please, Mother.<eos> The only thing you eat is cocktail onions.<eos> I simply cannot believe I let you talk me into this boondoggle!<eos> Not just me.
The only thing you eat is cocktail onions.<eos> I simply cannot believe I let you talk me into this boondoggle!<eos> Not just me.<eos> Lana?<eos> Okay, me too.
- The maids?<eos> - Th... The dogs!<eos> Oh, my God, I am so sorry... that that happened.<eos> I'll tell you who's sorry, is my flokati rug.<eos> Oh, and my worthless bodyguards.
Don't be the same feckless idiots you were when this was a spy agency.<eos> Oh, come on.<eos> Just literally yesterday, you were all so excited about your first case, and now look at you.<eos> So get off your collective ass and get me a sit-rep on my field agents!<eos> "Investigators."
I know, right?<eos> She's like...<eos> Ow! So, are you and Archer,<eos> - you know?<eos> - Unfortunately.
Hm, like five hours?<eos> Oh, that is not good.<eos> Uh, no.<eos> You're gonna want a brain scan, you know, if we don't get murdered.<eos> Which...
In case those assholes find you in here.<eos> It's our only bargaining chip.<eos> All right.<eos> But please hurry.<eos> I...
- Well, what?<eos> Well, what's the plan?<eos> To escape!<eos> Impossible! Unless we can override the controls for these panic doors.<eos> Which...
Hey, knock it off, you two!<eos> Damn it! I said knock it off!<eos> Make me. Ow!<eos> Okay!<eos> Jesus!
Oh, eat my asshole!<eos> Now what are we gonna do about the hostage situation?<eos> Oh, right.<eos> All right. My guys are in position and ready to blow the doors on your command.<eos> On whose command?
Well, a lot of it's the Brazilian.<eos> They really make you feel sexy.<eos> At least until the ingrown hairs turn me back into Bumplestiltskin.<eos> - B-ugh. - I want to double the bet.<eos> Deal.
All right, so what's the plan, guys?<eos> How do we stop Archer from hooking up with Veronica?<eos> Umm... Ooh! We could throw acid in her face.<eos> Wh...<eos> Jesus.
Would you care to tell the detectives... that I couldn't have killed Ellis... because I was busy beating your ass?<eos> I would love to.<eos> - There.<eos> See?<eos> - Unfortunately...
Which you were extremely clear about.<eos> And repeatedly, come to think of it.<eos> - But there's no clock in here, so...<eos> - What do you think... about...<eos> Mexico?
Mexico?<eos> Like, their extradition treaty, or...<eos> No, you goose.<eos> As a romantic getaway!<eos> Oh. Well, then, theoretically, me gusto mucho.
* A wishing well of crocodile cheers, sing *<eos> - What the hell, Wes?<eos> - Look, I know I'm coming across...<eos> - I'm red lighting you, for real.<eos> Okay?
Did you get any sleep at all?<eos> These are busy times.<eos> You don't need a doctor to tell you that you're working yourself into an early grave.<eos> The long hours, the... Ok, when you just called me just now, what number did you dial?<eos> Your home number.
Sorry.<eos> I'm so (bleep) nervous.<eos> - Me too.<eos> - You are?<eos> About something else.
On the attackers, and the dead And we that we have no casualties. Go!<eos> By the way, don't mention Schöll. This was very hard for him!<eos> Schöll.<eos> You're writing?<eos> In fact, to my mother. But I...
Is that too much to ask?<eos> Let's get this gala out of the way and then we can take a look at it.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Have you told anybody else about this?<eos> Alex?
He'll be all right.<eos> - RASH: So, I've got news.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> We got it.<eos> - The flat?
It's taco Tuesday.<eos> Kai.<eos> I'm sorry, Miriam.<eos> I can't legally do anything to make them release the body.<eos> Legally?
Thank you, Doctor.<eos> Uh... a moment.<eos> A prescription... for yourself.<eos> For me?<eos> Why me?
I find that... disconcerting.<eos> What's even more disturbing is what I did after work that first day.<eos> I was so exhausted, out of my mind, I... I committed a murder.<eos> Who did you kill?<eos> A cow.
And what else was I supposed to do?<eos> If I haven't written my novel by now, I'm never going to write it, you know?<eos> I just couldn't go on.<eos> So I... I visited a witch doctor.<eos> Psychiatrist.
"They"?<eos> The government.<eos> Augustus worked for them.<eos> I couldn't trust anyone.<eos> Especially the police.
It gives me the right.<eos> If my woman accuses me of fucking somebody else, well, then, I'll go fuck somebody else.<eos> If your daughter thinks I'm a rapist, then she gets raped.<eos> Nobody gets away with what you did to us.<eos> Nobody.

Nobody.<eos> Nobody.<eos> They don't?<eos> Nobody.<eos> Nobody.
Nobody.<eos> They don't?<eos> Nobody.<eos> Nobody.<eos> Nobody.
Why don't you come over to my house and then we can all have a barbecue, me, you, and Jon?<eos> Do you...<eos> I mean, do you really think that you and me could ever be friends?<eos> No.<eos> Sadly.
You're awake.<eos> Nothing gets past you, Ubbe?<eos> Are you well again?<eos> I'm alive...<eos> Unfortunately.
Nothing gets past you, Ubbe?<eos> Are you well again?<eos> I'm alive...<eos> Unfortunately.<eos> Unfortunately?
Fight me!<eos> It'll fit.<eos> It'll fit.<eos> I have come to tell you I'm going away.<eos> To your mother's?
Kara, nothing is wrong.<eos> I told you.<eos> You're safe at home.<eos> This is not my home.<eos> Earth!
Please.<eos> Where does Mom think you are?<eos> - Where did you tell her you are?<eos> - Uh...<eos> - Uncle Jeff's.
So Jaime's visiting his daddy this weekend.<eos> In Guatemala?<eos> Not his bio father, his daddi with an "I".
- A fucking condom!<eos> - Ab, this is it!<eos> This could be the key to the whole crime!<eos> This could unlock the whole thing, it's only six to... - Six-and-a-half hours old. - What?<eos> Fresh on his tail.
Fresh Lychee's, Ab.<eos> Where'd you get the corsage, Ab?<eos> I ran into my florist.<eos> "My florist," excuse me, Queen of Sheba.<eos> Okay, back to business.
Yeah.<eos> Made decent time.<eos> Did you have time to go by the other place too?<eos> I'll tell you about it when I see you,<eos> - not on the phone.
Thank you, Captain.<eos> Whatever we can do.<eos> Don't hesitate to ask.<eos> Don't smoke.<eos> Oh, good for you.
Of course.<eos> Hey, Rhodes.<eos> - Uh-uh.<eos> - Come on. One more?<eos> - One more?
We're like the Chinese.<eos> We're everywhere.<eos> I'll drop you a card.<eos> You lied.<eos> To me.
12:15 a text was sent to George Irving's cell.<eos> Sorry, partner, I let you down.<eos> So five minutes before he bought the farm, he texted an apology to his dead partner,<eos> - and then he shot himself?<eos> - Apparently.
He was dirty.<eos> Of course he had a burner.<eos> His personal cell phone is missing.<eos> He got rid of it.<eos> Any number of reasons.
Thank you. That's very kind.<eos> Whoa, what happened?<eos> Someone break the safe?<eos> Oh, no, we just had to drill a safe deposit box.<eos> Probate proceeding.
Any swollen sow can feed your children.<eos> You must raise them.<eos> You must nurture their minds to grow into a Khan and a Queen of unassailable character.<eos> Go, Mother.<eos> To your Khan.
Really?<eos> I was prepared to destroy you right from the start.<eos> But I was led off that course by those around me.<eos> Advice, I realize now... was warped and craven... and working for the other side.<eos> Your side.
How does a vessel of this size function without a crew?<eos> I don't need one.<eos> I have Gideon. Welcome aboard.<eos> I am Gideon, an interactive artificial consciousness programmed to operate this vessel's critical systems and aid Captain Hunter in his mission.<eos> Captain?
It was when one of my teammates took a tackle for me, and I knew they were gonna make sure I was safe, that nobody got to me.<eos> Watching all of you rush back to the ship, even those two knuckleheads, to take on Chronos?<eos> Made me feel the same way.<eos> I like being part of a team, man.<eos> Me too.
Then some guy comes along and tells me that being the Atom is as insignificant as an actual Atom.<eos> That's not what he said.<eos> Rip said that in his future we're nobodies, but this mission is about changing the future.<eos> I mean, if we have the power to change the world, don't you think we have the power to change our own fate?<eos> For better or for worse.
A dumb little boy you are!<eos> Yeah.<eos> Hello.<eos> So, does Cece's mom love Schmidt, or what?<eos> Which Cece's mom?
It's nice to see you too.<eos> - Tell John I said hello.<eos> - I'll do that.<eos> - So, have a good evening.<eos> - You too.
When we disagree on something, the next step isn't to do it behind my back.<eos> It makes them wonder if I can do my job.<eos> If you could've seen Paige with her, you'd understand.<eos> It was the right thing to go.<eos> For a lot of reasons.
- Yeah. Michael, that's very interesting.<eos> Hey, there Rosa; I thought these might come in handy, fresh from the supply room.<eos> Oh, thanks, Josh.<eos> That's so sweet. Hey, no problem.<eos> - Oh, Josh.
He is a very busy friend.<eos> All right, guys. This is great.<eos> We have to do this again soon.<eos> - Josh! Josh!<eos> - One at a time, one at a time!
- Josh! Josh!<eos> - One at a time, one at a time!<eos> Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. One at a time! - Guys!<eos> - One... one at a time.<eos> One at a time.
You guys are so perfect together.<eos> - It always seemed like that, but... it's over now.<eos> [feet tap]<eos> - If there's anything I can do, anything at all, just let me know.<eos> - Thanks. - Sure.
- [laughs] Thank you.<eos> - Yeah, of course. - I really appreciate all the help today.<eos> - My pleasure.<eos> It was my--no, I... actually had a lot of fun doing it, so...<eos> - Me too.
I'm psyched that my best friend<eos> Is with the girl that I... Know from work and consider a friend.<eos> He's cool with it<eos> I'm... I'm really happy for you guys.<eos> Totally cool with it
Yeah, no, that's... that's...<eos> Yeah, that's what I thought, okay.<eos> - Cool.<eos> - Cool.<eos> - Well, good night!
I thought you guys were non-union.<eos> We're in Actors' Equity.<eos> You're all Equity?<eos> If one of us is Equity, then it's an Equity production, and we're all owed Equity compensation.<eos> Even the drummer?
It was just a mistake.<eos> So... if there's anything I can do, I really just want to make things right with you.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - I like dancing with you.<eos> Me too.
That's his.<eos> He'd just bought it.<eos> Er, did he tell you HOW he made the money? No.<eos> He must've done another job.<eos> Moonlighting.
We've only been here five minutes.<eos> Your job is rubbish.<eos> Then just... go.<eos> If I go, you'll fall asleep.<eos> Thanks to you.
-Steve... -Mmm-hmm?<eos> -I have to go.<eos> -In a minute.<eos> Steve.<eos> I really, like...
That's disgusting.<eos> Do a lot of studying last night?<eos> Yeah, actually, I did.<eos> What was your test on again?<eos> Human anatomy?
Nah. Chief, you copy?<eos> Yeah, Flo, talk to me.<eos> Hey, Chief, we got a call from over at Benny's.<eos> I think you need to get there right away.<eos> Ugh, Jesus!
All happy and gay!<eos> You're dead, Wheeler!<eos> Dead!<eos> Dude, Troy peed himself.<eos> Holy shit!
I don't know!<eos> I don't know.<eos> They... they just told me to call it in and not let anybody get too close.<eos> Get close to what?<eos> The body.
Listen to me. Listen to me.<eos> The last thing in the world we need is them knowing you're mixed up in all this.<eos> -Mike is over there--<eos> -They haven't found him.<eos> Not yet, at least.
How do you know all that?<eos> He's seen it.<eos> Is there any way that you could... that you could reach Will? That you could talk to him in this--<eos> The Upside Down.<eos> Down.
Get out of here!<eos> - Jump!<eos> - Oh, my God!<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> Jesus!
- Jump!<eos> - Oh, my God!<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> Jesus!<eos> Jesus!
Now I can hear from your sister all through Rosh Hashanah what a prince her husband is.<eos> Okay, and then if he would have charged me, you'd be complaining about that.<eos> Who's complaining?<eos> I mean, you do realize the rates will go up, right?<eos> With the insurance.
Bite?<eos> Oh, God, no.<eos> I'm glad you came in.<eos> I was gonna come see you.<eos> About?
Mike Dimonda from The Journal.<eos> Sorry to wake you.<eos> I was up.<eos> I'm calling for comment.<eos> On?
Starting a capital raise.<eos> After our session, I had the sudden clarity that we were ready, that I was ready.<eos> I see it looking at you, that you're ready.<eos> But they may not be.<eos> At least... not yet.
All these rules and regulations... arbitrary, chalked up by politicians for their own ends.<eos> And these fines you're always going after...<eos> Where do they go?<eos> Who gets them?<eos> The poor?
He only told me 50 fucking times.<eos> So when does the whole empathy thing kick in for you?<eos> I did take the liberty of seating him next to you tonight at dinner, so who knows how this evening will end?<eos> I think it just did.<eos> Fuck it.
Can you let me in?<eos> No.<eos> What?<eos> I called your friend J.<eos> Julian?
Is there?<eos> I'll figure it out.<eos> I can figure it out.<eos> How are you gonna figure it out?<eos> My computer.
But, you know, give them a few years, they'll catch up.<eos> Thanks.<eos> I look forward to being mildly appreciated after my death.<eos> Who doesn't?<eos> Fuck it.
That's right.<eos> No, no, no, don't feel bad.<eos> You can call us anytime.<eos> Call us morning, noon or night.<eos> Weekends, holidays.
I was not aware those with your level of insight needed any more reflection.<eos> Dr. Ford. Always charming.<eos> What is this?<eos> Apparently, Miss Cullen and Miss Hale havea presentation forus.<eos> What about?
Doesn't look like it's been your night.<eos> Got cleaned out at the roulette table.<eos> I was talking to her.<eos> No, man.<eos> She good.
A pretty powerful someone who was less than pleased with the way the Memphis legal system handled the matters.<eos> I imagine my client was the "him" he was referring to.<eos> So, I'm supposed to just take your word for it now?<eos> Take whatever word you want, son.<eos> Mine, your wife's.
It's, like, the girl who has nightmares about Freddy lives there.<eos> Whatever, it...<eos> - You got work today?<eos> - Nah.<eos> - You?
It's like, no judgments or anything, you know?<eos> Here.<eos> Oh, okay. Um...<eos> So, I, uh...<eos> Oh, Jesus fuckin'...
You cannot be serious--<eos> -I-- No, Bill.<eos> Calm down.<eos> -Hey, I really-<eos> - I gotta--
Any more of her Christian care may just get one of us killed.<eos> Impressive for a civilian.<eos> Husband or son?<eos> Who are you here to visit?<eos> No one.
And a friendly face?<eos> Well, that's just fine, dearie, but our Union boys are entitled to proper nursing care.<eos> No.<eos> Not the Yankees.<eos> The confederates.
I'll be with him soon.<eos> Wood's syringe is an excellent device.<eos> Developed by Alexander wood, a Scotsman, and a French orthopedic surgeon called Pravaz.<eos> I was in Europe a few years back and saw Pravaz demonstrate on a spaniel.<eos> A dog?
Here.<eos> I'll hold the cup for you.<eos> Yours is the first kind face I seen.<eos> To them, all we is is the enemy.<eos> Greater the pity for them.
I serve you, my master!<eos> Damien!<eos> Red roses mean "I love you," and orange means passion.<eos> White?<eos> Purity.
And you?<eos> Never better.<eos> It's so funny us running into each other.<eos> The police we're asking me about you today.<eos> About me?
- Are you coming with me?<eos> - Not right now, but I'll come back to check on you.<eos> Are you going somewhere with her?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Unfortunately.
Credence, damn, man. That was a long time ago.<eos> I told you my sister's boy...<eos> I don't give a good God damn about your sister's boy.<eos> I'm saying who is it you're gonna hook me up with and how am I supposed to trust him?<eos> Or you?
Twice.<eos> See, now that figures.<eos> You miss it?<eos> What's that?<eos> War.
What I'm saying is the system we've been using, it's not a system that exists anymore.<eos> You've presented the problem well.<eos> Now, what's the solution?<eos> Why deal with a bunch of low-rent gun runners when you can deal directly with someone you know and trust?<eos> Yours truly.
It says here you already have the job.<eos> Yes, of course.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I'm told to report to, uh...<eos> Dr. Hale?
I'm sure you have union men to care for.<eos> The lord does not recognize uniforms, miss.<eos> God be with you, Tom.<eos> Don't trust them.<eos> Not even holy Joe.
He's working to help runaways.<eos> I'm free already.<eos> If you ever did need something, well, here I be.<eos> Hey... Now, we all could use a hand now and again.<eos> "We"?
Tell Treville what happened here.<eos> Marcheaux!<eos> Marcheaux!<eos> You don't have the authority to make these arrests.<eos> On the contrary Madame.
Different kinds of policy.<eos> Do you still have nightmares?<eos> I do.<eos> Three shrinks and a whole lot of prescriptions, but I still have bad dreams.<eos> How about you?
Didn't do much good this year.<eos> Got passed over for promotion.<eos> (EXHALES) College wasn't what I thought it was going to be.<eos> I look at Aria, Spencer, and even Hanna, it all seemed to click for them.<eos> Not for you?
This is very... unexpected.<eos> Look, it's great we caught it so early.<eos> It's very manageable at this stage.<eos> We just... We need to take it out in the next few months.<eos> - The cyst?
Hello.<eos> I'm Bernard Cohen. I'm in from Richmond.<eos> I talked to Jim about using his office for a few hours.<eos> Yes, Mr. Cohen, do you know it?<eos> - Down the hall?
I'm sorry that we had to celebrate a day early.<eos> I actually forgot Thanksgiving was on a Thursday.<eos> Give him a break. Give him a break.<eos> I like this better... my mother gets apoplectic if we're not there on the actual holiday.<eos> Or for any reason at all.

It's not too early to start a makeover of the firm's culture.<eos> What fucking culture?<eos> Big returns that beat the street by double digits year in, year out, making our investors rich?<eos> - That culture?<eos> - No... the rep.
What do we do?<eos> Ma'am, we need to be sure that when we get on...<eos> No, shut up, Kent.<eos> You already lost Nevada for me once.<eos> - "Nev-add-a."
Excellent work, Richard.<eos> Richard works for me.<eos> You have a doctorate?<eos> Two.<eos> Constitutional law and veterinary medicine,
- We are sorry, Pop. - Sorry?<eos> I don't know what's going on here.<eos> We didn't mean to come into your office...<eos> We're sorry?<eos> ...like this, with this type of energy.
_<eos> Why, yes, I did.<eos> Thank you for asking.<eos> _<eos> What loss?
I know what it's like to lose someone, to want to know why.<eos> Well, all I learned was, Paul was no hero.<eos> Why do you say that?<eos> He was under investigation for treason.<eos> Treason?
I never thought looking into Paul's death could get me killed.<eos> Arrested, maybe, but not dead.<eos> This is about more than your brother.<eos> He must've gotten close to something else.<eos> Something sensitive.
How goes your little simulated showdown?<eos> Having a little trouble with the laptop.<eos> I caught it doing something new.<eos> It's attempting to send out electromagnetic pulses, trying to connect with the whole network of Samaritan-infected devices around the world:<eos> laptops, printers, phones.
Your encryption is impressive, along with that app on your phone that modulates your voice, but what's really ingenious is the call you made to yourself in the precinct.<eos> A recording that allowed you to assume the role of a victim.<eos> Even your getaway car, registered under another alias in a spot perfectly removed from street cameras.<eos> A precaution at every turn.<eos> Evidently not cautious enough.
Haven't lost your charm.<eos> So who are you working for, again?<eos> A new company.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Sort of a jack-of-all-trades.
Unless you have something to say to me.<eos> I have played by the rules for so long.<eos> Not from where I'm sitting.<eos> No.<eos> Not your rules.
Sorry to have to tell you this, but Jessica died.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> You told me to wait for you, and say those words, and I will.<eos> He saved her.<eos> Jessica.
Figure I pay you back all at once.<eos> Don't take too long.<eos> You might miss your chance.<eos> You ready?<eos> For what?
That bad, huh?<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> I want to help.<eos> Go home, John.<eos> To your son and your wife.
Before we let all that success go to our heads, we just thought we should get together and reconnect with the fundamentals of what actually got us here.<eos> For that, I'm gonna turn it over to our resident poet philosopher of product.<eos> The rebel command of brand. He's the guru who terrifies Madison Avenue.<eos> My partner, my better half,<eos> Howard Inlet.
- You could...<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - So, three letters.<eos> - Who are they to?<eos> - Oh, not who.
I got it, I got it. I got it.<eos> Wait.<eos> Wait, I lost it. I lost it.<eos> Catch it downstream!<eos> Downstream!

- Hey, you!<eos> Stop right there!<eos> - ...that audio activity - can be detected with the right equipment.<eos> - Down here!<eos> Down the hall!
You can't just drop a bomb like that and cut out.<eos> No, I'm gonna be late for practice again.<eos> See you guys later.<eos> Uh, French, hey...<eos> Ready for the big night?
We're having a nice time, aren't we?<eos> All you have to do is convince her to come up to your room.<eos> Then you can have a nice long sleep with the window open and the ocean breeze blowing through.<eos> I'm gonna call--<eos> Who?
Five of 'em.<eos> And you need five people... at least.<eos> The movements, they... they do things we... cannot imagine.<eos> Five movements... open a... a tunnel to another dimension.<eos> Our freedom.
Wait, what have you got for her?<eos> She needs this to get to Cuba.<eos> The money for the pilot.<eos> And some letters she needs to give to Fidel.<eos> Fidel?
You know how fast you were going?<eos> Let me guess. Too fast, right?<eos> What, are you a wise guy?<eos> Let me see your license.<eos> Jesus.
Oh, sure, but, yeah, come over here.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> - Yeah, just step...<eos> As a matter of fact, if you like, what I'll do, I'll personalize it for you.<eos> Okay yeah, yeah, Trooper Mike.
- Yeah?<eos> - Yeah, just step...<eos> As a matter of fact, if you like, what I'll do, I'll personalize it for you.<eos> Okay yeah, yeah, Trooper Mike.<eos> Trooper Mike.

- He did the rips.<eos> He ripped the shit out of this<eos> - piece of paper.<eos> - No.<eos> I...
But no matter how hard you try... mistakes get made.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> Just that mistakes get made.<eos> Sweet dreams.<eos> You, too.
They've had quite enough for today, okay?<eos> Just let them be.<eos> What's going on?<eos> What do you mean?<eos> You.
Doesn't exactly make me feel great to have everyone know the reason that we're getting divorced is because you fornicated with a French douchebag 22 times.<eos> - H-hey, Dad?<eos> - Yeah, buddy?<eos> My headphones are on, but they're not... they're not plugged into anything yet.<eos> Just FYI.
The boy got himself lost, and, uh, I'm bringing him back.<eos> Whoa.<eos> Cool gun, bro.<eos> What do you guys shoot with this?<eos> Sparrows?
I'm not going back to jail.<eos> I'm better off up here.<eos> This is no place for a kid.<eos> You're going to have to go back, Ricky.<eos> To what?
I'm better off up here.<eos> This is no place for a kid.<eos> You're going to have to go back, Ricky.<eos> To what?<eos> Well, to the welfare people.
Oh no!<eos> TENSE MUSIC<eos> (GRUNTS)<eos> Man, we gotta work on your dismounts.<eos> You all good from here?
The guy's head was bashed in like a cantaloupe.<eos> - It's complicated.<eos> - What's so fucking complicated?<eos> Stop, okay?<eos> Enough. Not on the phone.
Sid, wake up.<eos> I definitely heard something.<eos> Stop.<eos> Stop.<eos> Oh, Jesus.
Ah, you know, don't do...<eos> It's not that urgent yet.<eos> You can't hear that noise?<eos> It's impossible.<eos> - Oh. - Jesus.
Every time that there's an electrical storm, the phone goes out.<eos> - Well, the line is dead.<eos> - The phone's out?<eos> Yes, the line is dead.<eos> Jesus.
You know, she's not entitled.<eos> There's this radical arrogance.<eos> It's not permanent.<eos> When she leaves, you'll put back your poster of Raquel Welch.<eos> Christ.
Maybe they can't find it, but I have an ulcer.<eos> Okay, I think we're clear.<eos> Where are we going?<eos> We're going... going to hand this off.<eos> To who?
God's not gonna punish you; you're an atheist.<eos> Yes, but if I'm wrong, we're in big trouble.<eos> You see that phone booth?<eos> At 3:00, you will enter that phone booth and make a call.<eos> To who?
That the Transpo Department promoted me out of the garage.<eos> I'm now the new driver for the head of sanitation.<eos> And to think Daddy always said you'd never amount to anything.<eos> Your daddy was just jealous of my motorcycle.<eos> And my hair.
I told those Redhats yesterday, I broke up with Andy a month ago.<eos> I'm sorry to hear that.<eos> Don't be.<eos> He was an asshole.<eos> Soda?
Nothing.<eos> Hi.<eos> Hey.<eos> Some people need our help.<eos> Who?
At Esalen for breakfast, they have six different kinds of yogurt.<eos> Not flavors, kinds.<eos> - Greek yogurt and...<eos> - Why don't we just focus on the meal that we're having right here, right now?<eos> This meal.
Go home and play with your kids."<eos> Okay, okay, okay.<eos> No.<eos> Actually, I feel a little bit bad doing it this way.<eos> Yeah, me, too.
We got scavs!<eos> Doing things... horrible things... you never thought you'd be capable of.<eos> No matter how hard you fought, you'd have to live with it.<eos> You'd adapt, transform...<eos> Evolve.
Well, it is possible that when the Messengers used our machine to go back in time, that somehow they ensured the eventual release of the plague.<eos> We need to get Mr. Ramse to talk.<eos> It is so good to see you, my friend.<eos> Jonesy and Cass, they got a real nasty beef with you.<eos> Worse than our little piece of unfinished business.
Send Railly with another injection.<eos> Our agreement was made to protect the integrity of our timeline.<eos> You... the future you... and Cassie, you're gonna make a mistake.<eos> You're gonna hurt someone.<eos> A friend.
Right.<eos> And much worse than we remembered it?<eos> Precisely.<eos> But there were other changes as well, at least from my perspective.<eos> Spearhead, for example.
You know, the road manager told me who you are.<eos> Not sure what you're worrying about.<eos> I wouldn't be.<eos> Well, you'd be surprised.<eos> At what?
Why aren't you at work?<eos> Oh, I was...<eos> I wasn't feeling well this morning. I...<eos> Oh, you okay?<eos> Oh, yes.
I've got an idea.<eos> Filmmaking isn't art.<eos> It's more than that.<eos> It's science, which is why I'm gonna beat these movie yahoos at their own game.<eos> Because of your boundless modesty?
This is a restricted area.<eos> Leave.<eos> Whatever happened to "please"?<eos> There's no reason to be rude to my wife.<eos> "My wife"...
Jack, you know Hugh Jones.<eos> Oh, sure.<eos> He came to my New York office last year, ruffling feathers.<eos> You tell him about that girl?<eos> What girl?
You can take it apart and put it back together?<eos> Uh, I hate that you even asked me that question.<eos> I will assume that's a yes.<eos> All right, let's get to it.<eos> To what?

A million people died in the Iraq war, and for what?<eos> Is the life of the average person better or worse?<eos> So right now, the resistance is just a nuisance, but if, in six months' time, all these groups coalesce around Geronimo, it's really gonna be dangerous.<eos> Do you think they can do real damage?<eos> Well, not to our visitors, but to us.
Absolutely.<eos> You just can't smoke in here.<eos> - There's no smoking.<eos> What?<eos> Happy Easter, everybody.
Unknown: Answering my questions?<eos> Yes.<eos> Unknown: Are you back?<eos> Yes.<eos> Your place?
Yes.<eos> Unknown: Are you back?<eos> Yes.<eos> Your place?<eos> Kyra's?

I see.<eos> Look, I've done some things I'm not real proud of. But I'm not that girl anymore.<eos> That's why I'm here in Nashville.<eos> 'Cause the only thing I've ever been good at... And the only thing that's helped me get through my life is music.<eos> You and me both.

Is this you we're listening to?<eos> - Did it all independently.<eos> - Really?<eos> Let's hear it for the owner of The Beverly,<eos> Mr. Deacon Claybourne!
What woman?<eos> A local escort.<eos> According to her, Mr. Bell became unresponsive after several days of consuming dangerous amounts of alcohol, pain pills, and sexual performance enhancers.<eos> Y-Y-You sure we're talking about the same guy, doc?<eos> Quite sure, sadly.
I'm your daughter's friend, and that is exactly<eos> - what she needs right now.<eos> - If you were her friend, you would encourage her to come home and sort this out.<eos> To a controlling mother and a<eos> - crazy father?
Probably... for Will.<eos> He's got nothing to lose.<eos> Unlike you.<eos> It's so hot in here.<eos> You hot?
I do my best to keep going, but...<eos> I can't even imagine.<eos> You were so good to me, flying me home and everything.<eos> Oh, it was the least I could do.<eos> And I...
Okay, okay.<eos> Stop.<eos> I am not performing tonight.<eos> But a good friend of mine is, so, ladies and gentlemen, Maddie.<eos> Hey, y'all.
I really appreciate that.<eos> Thank you.<eos> - Of course.<eos> - You have a beautiful night.<eos> - You too.
I'll head upstairs with you.<eos> Oh, they didn't tell you?<eos> Tell me what?<eos> You don't work upstairs anymore.<eos> On whose orders?
Oh, they didn't tell you?<eos> Tell me what?<eos> You don't work upstairs anymore.<eos> On whose orders?<eos> Mine.
I'm feeling better.<eos> But you should keep a little distance.<eos> Is it weird for you to be working together?<eos> Oh, me and Hannah?<eos> Me and you?
Yeah, yeah, it appears so.<eos> You know the kind of trouble you'd be into if you ever got close to a trainee?<eos> Even I couldn't save you from that.<eos> Don't be ridiculous.<eos> Another round?
Or someone who's clearly unstable.<eos> We'd like you to go to Switzerland and bring Mr. Pembroke back to us.<eos> You see... the merger cannot go through without Mr. Pembroke signing off... on certain legal matters.<eos> I don't have the relationship with Mr. Pembroke that Morris had.<eos> Fuck Morris.
The church would have been right over there... where that funny little building is now.<eos> People used to come from miles around... for the miracles attributed to the holy water.<eos> Guess some things don't change.<eos> How marvelous.<eos> Terrible thing, though.
Listen.<eos> War drums.<eos> Azgeda.<eos> You can tell it's Ice Nation from the sound?<eos> No, from them.
If we get her, the others will come.<eos> This can make it go away.<eos> Heh. Please.<eos> The key to the city of light,<eos> To your salvation and relief.
Thanks.<eos> Where are we going?<eos> To say hello to the president.<eos> Aren't you going to work?<eos> The president?
Where's Clary?<eos> And where's Jocelyn?<eos> I don't know.<eos> All I know is that I sent Clary to the police station.<eos> To you.
I'm afraid Simon's coming with us.<eos> No!<eos> No, he's not a part of this.<eos> And it'll be my pleasure to kill you unless you return him.<eos> Careful.
I just feel more comfortable with her right now.<eos> - This is Margaret, she's my nanny.<eos> - Andy.<eos> Who are we going to meet?<eos> Roger.
Okay.<eos> There's a high school around the block.<eos> Marching band practice.<eos> I like it.<eos> Me, too.
- Okay. Great.<eos> All right.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Have a good one.<eos> You, too.
- Thank you.<eos> One thing.<eos> Uh, the idea...<eos> Okay, so we'd probably be fine, but the idea, as crazy as it sounds, is actually Gus's.<eos> Gus the tutor.
Excuse you.<eos> IDs.<eos> You don't look like an Amhad Ahmed Izz-Al-Din.<eos> I'm Arab.<eos> On my mother's side.
But seriously, there is talk the Senate will send our legions out again, and this time not on a short march to Gaul.<eos> What truth to these mutterings, Sestimus?<eos> The matter has been taken up in the Senate.<eos> It seems that there is unrest in Palestine.<eos> Palestine?

So, I black out, I wake up here...<eos> And I say to myself,<eos> "Baird, you gotta stop doing this."<eos> But you're saying, actually, technically, I was kidnapped.<eos> Well, technically, yes.
They drove to Palm Springs and were married at 3:00 this morning.<eos> Will you be gone long?<eos> Today's call list to go through.<eos> No, less than an hour.<eos> Personal errand.
No.<eos> They don't know that.<eos> Did you like it... what you did?<eos> It was exciting at first.<eos> Like all new things.
Yo, I know the product, and I know the game, and now that I've seen how they work up close,<eos> I know even better how to move serious weight without law enforcement suspecting a goddamn thing.<eos> I'm gonna get you the best product at the best price.<eos> The shipments will be reliable, and they'll be on time.<eos> And not on Sundays.
But why?<eos> We love you both.<eos> That has not changed.<eos> And yes, there will be a few changes, and it's a transition for all of us, but you can always come to me if you need to talk.<eos> Or me.
No, I am riding this job all the way to higher office.<eos> Okay, Senator Sacker.<eos> That's a first step.<eos> To what?<eos> Governor?
There it is, yeah.<eos> Perfect.<eos> There really is icing on here.<eos> All right, then.<eos> Hi there.

Well, Rosita... it's not what I want.<eos> It's what you and Daryl are going to do. You're going to let us into your little complex.<eos> It looks like it's just beautiful in there.<eos> And then you're going to let us take whatever and whoever we want... or we blow Eugene's brains out.<eos> And then yours.

No Benz, no Audi.<eos> Just two identical Honda minivans.<eos> Who the fuck has two minivans?<eos> One in beige, one in... boring.<eos> Nobody.
- You drink it.<eos> Yeah, Dale?<eos> I'm gonna need Martina Slovis's contact info now.<eos> I'm here for the Stewart bachelor party.<eos> Uh, right back there.
People are burning and dying.<eos> And everyone you work with sees it happen.<eos> So you call a broker...<eos> Lincoln Chang in Jersey City... and have him short aviation stocks in the European markets.<eos> Then US hotels, shipping.
I loved it when my mom worked here.<eos> Remember how we'd get locked in?<eos> I remember.<eos> I visited her this morning.<eos> Your mother?
I just saw it on the card there.<eos> Oh, of course.<eos> Have a nice evening.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You too.
Turkey has every right to have a strong navy.<eos> The Empire needs to protect its borders.<eos> The Ottoman Empire wants its borders to stretch from the Atlantic to the Indian Ocean, and what these fellas...<eos> These Germans want your sultan to declare a holy war against the infidel.<eos> The British, the French, and the Russian.
My husband was away training.<eos> And she never turned up?<eos> No.<eos> So I drove to Chris's, see if she were there.<eos> Why not to your mam's?
I want to.<eos> Careful... there's plastic on the steps.<eos> We're still processing evidence down there.<eos> You coming?<eos> I just...
And you framed him for it.<eos> Well, we all knew he was the guy.<eos> It was just a matter of proving it.<eos> The underwear drawer... it was a nice touch.<eos> Little on the nose, but super creepy.
But if people need to know that we're okay to vote for me, I don't think I should lie and say that we are.<eos> It is a disservice to anyone who has experienced trauma and to their families and to their children.<eos> I ca...<eos> I-I'm sorry.<eos> I just, uh...
Who are you?<eos> An ally, Boris.<eos> An ally.<eos> Who needs an ally like you?<eos> No one.
An ally, Boris.<eos> An ally.<eos> Who needs an ally like you?<eos> No one.<eos> Everyone.
Uh, no, my deal was a lot more complicated.<eos> Okay.<eos> Let's go.<eos> I'll get you home.<eos> Your home?
Okay.<eos> Let's go.<eos> I'll get you home.<eos> Your home?<eos> Or Mom's?
She'll tell you.<eos> He hasn't been sleeping.<eos> Well, can you blame him?<eos> Paul was everything to us.<eos> Nearly everything.
How about a popcorn and movie night tonight?<eos> Yes, please.<eos> Good.<eos> I think a little personal time is just what we need.<eos> All three of us.
Help!<eos> Diana!<eos> If you hurt my kids, we are never speaking again!<eos> Keep the light on us!<eos> Ma'am?
But my... unique nature... left me feeling loathed and loathsome.<eos> And then I was introduced to a woman who saved my life.<eos> A mental doctor of a sort.<eos> I was skeptical but the proof is in the pudding, and here I sit before you... resplendently who I am,<eos> entirely because of her ministrations.
As you like.<eos> American Indian?<eos> Chiricahua Apache by birth and right.<eos> Are you familiar with the West?<eos> Only through the newspapers.
I think you will.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Then we'll go on.<eos> Where are we going?<eos> The dead place.
Be kind to yourself, Lily.<eos> Passion will undo the best of us and lead only to tragedy.<eos> It's ever thus for those who care so deeply.<eos> Better not to care at all, Dorian?<eos> In my experience.
And you've come freely into the dragon's cave.<eos> All of you.<eos> Brave or foolhardy,<eos> I can't say... but we shall feed well tonight.<eos> "We"?
All of you.<eos> Brave or foolhardy,<eos> I can't say... but we shall feed well tonight.<eos> "We"?<eos> All the children of the Mother of Evil.
No.<eos> You do it that way, and the Southern District declines to prosecute.<eos> Because if we did, you would dig those badger teeth and claws of yours in and fight.<eos> It would take two years, and you would go to jail, but the Southern District believes that your swift departure would be best for the justice system.<eos> And shame on you.
It's what makes you great.<eos> But today, your own words, you missed something.<eos> Somehow the idea that all the guys...<eos> I asked Mafee, and the moment he said that everyone else agreed that it was the wrong move, that it was the wrong move, I had to stick it out, had to prove that I was the difference maker.<eos> To who?

I wanna know before we go on.<eos> Grant me this indulgence.<eos> [clicks teeth] The Donnie thing threw me, to be honest.<eos> There's an empty space in the world without him.<eos> The fact that... The fact that...
That's what you were thinking about when you were young? Fuck.<eos> You chose the right line of work.<eos> I was just thinking about getting rich and getting even.<eos> Have you? Yeah.<eos> Mostly.
That even when you care about someone, you can use them for your own ends.<eos> If that is true, I don't like what it says about me.<eos> It may be true, but that's not what this is.<eos> You're punishing yourself because you're understanding You're punishing yourself because you're understanding that you didn't care about Donnie.<eos> Not really.
I'm glad that tonight helped, but don't ever fucking do that to me again.<eos> I don't think I will.<eos> [typing]<eos> [resumes typing] [keys clicking] [typing]<eos> ♪♪♪ [e-mail whooshes]
Tamara?<eos> A camp reunion seemed like the perfect way to self-soothe after my fight with Luke.<eos> I just hoped it wasn't too late to act like a kid again.<eos> I needed a return to myself, a return to home and happiness and security. A return to...<eos> Matty?
That you will heed and respect me.<eos> Otherwise... On the life of him who is dearer to me than even my own self,<eos> I do so swear.<eos> For the love i bear not only to your son,<eos> But also to you.
I'm not great at projecting authority.<eos> It's nice to talk Spanish, though.<eos> Reminds me of home.<eos> Do you miss it?<eos> Especially Sundays.
They didn't get justice for Finn.<eos> We won't get away with that again.<eos> In that case...<eos> Where are you taking him?<eos> To the new Commander.
Yeah, like that little thing you're doing with your tongue, eh?<eos> Well, maybe I learned some new tricks while we were broken up.<eos> Well, maybe I did too.<eos> Do you think I'd be good in ad sales?<eos> Honesty or politeness?
Let's get out of here.<eos> All those girls sound super trashy, by the way.<eos> I only hooked up with rich dudes with last names as first names.<eos> Hey. Here we go.<eos> - More beers! - _
_<eos> _<eos> _<eos> I know we blew it before.<eos> Totally my fault.
address and the like, you know.<eos> Medical history.<eos> Of course.<eos> I'm glad the bells have stopped.<eos> For Tennyson.
- I'm just, uh... just looking.<eos> - For a way out?<eos> Ooh. There isn't one.<eos> I mean, all the, uh... the cool stuff you guys collect.<eos> Steal.
Look where it got me.<eos> Do you wanna jump on the bike, baby?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - All right.<eos> Careful.
- It is.<eos> But at least we're not harming each other.<eos> - Simon Hallward wasn't happy with that.<eos> - He wasn't ready.<eos> - For what?
End the illegal regime!<eos> - Freedom for Rhodesia!<eos> - End the illegal regime!<eos> Simon Hallward.<eos> Asphyxia.
A man.<eos> I mean, I assumed it was a man.<eos> It usually is at that age.<eos> Your son seems fond of her.<eos> Verity.
"The best you can do is continue your mission."<eos> I believe the Lieutenant would agree.<eos> - And what is that mission?<eos> - For one, I must continue the hunt for Pandora and the Hidden One, put an end to their evil.<eos> Pandora?
You're right ...<eos> anyone can snap a person's neck.<eos> - You could've paired up with Mack.<eos> - Mack I can trust.<eos> Oh, but not me.
Then why are you sitting here?<eos> Madam, I cannot handle this old man anymore.<eos> He's here again.<eos> You go, I'll take care of it.<eos> - Okay, madam.
What if the kidnapper finds out that I've informed the police.. "then, he might do something.<eos> If you want to save the child, then the police are your only hope.<eos> I need details of the kidnapping reponed last week.<eos> Immediately.<eos> - Okay, madam.
- Okay, madam.<eos> And listen"<eos> I also want the case files of John Biswas.<eos> The 8 year old kidnapping case.<eos> Okay, madam.
I didn't understand.<eos> This pen was in that trunk as well.<eos> It completely slipped out of my mind.<eos> Look.<eos> Madam.
Send details to all the police units.<eos> - Yes.<eos> Where's Manohar?<eos> Call him.<eos> Yes, madam.
It's okay.<eos> Leave a message for him at home.<eos> The other units have already left for the location..<eos> I am going there but you stay here.<eos> - Yes, madam.
The shining sun of joy..<eos> The radiant dome of bliss..<eos> It submerged the envious glances..total eclipse!<eos> A woe unexpected"<eos> Like termite..
Did you fuck her?<eos> Shit, stop!<eos> Stay away from her!<eos> You stay the fuck away from her!<eos> From who, my mom?
Always making her pay for everything.<eos> Good times.<eos> I don't know, you made her happy somehow.<eos> She visits me sometimes in my dreams.<eos> You too?
We need to rise above it.<eos> Make clear, no matter who you support, that this sort of behavior will not be tolerated.<eos> Get me Reverend Clark and Gene Clancy on the phone.<eos> Hey, they want you out by the bus.<eos> By the bus?
Oh, I should not have given away my dog, man.<eos> Oh, God.<eos> Oh, God.<eos> Oh, God.<eos> Oh, God.
Have fun with Janet.<eos> Soon, Matty would be with me in Maine, meeting my friends, seeing my new life.<eos> It would be like worlds colliding and it was happening in only three hours.<eos> Or right now.<eos> Matty!
- What about your soccer game?<eos> - It was rescheduled.<eos> That's great... I mean, I'm sorry about your team. That must be annoying, but I am not sorry for us.<eos> God, I missed you.<eos> Just this face, these lips, these eyes.
- It was rescheduled.<eos> That's great... I mean, I'm sorry about your team. That must be annoying, but I am not sorry for us.<eos> God, I missed you.<eos> Just this face, these lips, these eyes.<eos> This.
Been here all day?<eos> Yeah, it's like two degrees out there.<eos> I'm resting up.<eos> - For the parties tonight?<eos> - No, for you.
I wasn't going to give up.<eos> Bath... bottle... book... bed.<eos> I wasn't going to break.<eos> Crap.<eos> Matty!
Well, you dropped out of school, bunny boots.<eos> If you want to be a Palos Hills mom, this is what it takes.<eos> You're going to need a Carl.<eos> So I'd consider Carl's junior.<eos> Okay, four B's.
Hey, where's your shirt?<eos> Oh, [bleep]. Where is my shirt?<eos> Quick, go out the back.<eos> Uh, uh, the German notes.<eos> Hey, Matty.
That hurt?<eos> No.<eos> I've just never been really good with needles.<eos> Oh, you'll get used to them.<eos> The injections too.
Two minutes.<eos> Be right there.<eos> Mm. God, I missed you.<eos> I missed you too.<eos> And this.
Be right there.<eos> Mm. God, I missed you.<eos> I missed you too.<eos> And this.<eos> - What work?
I missed you too.<eos> And this.<eos> - What work?<eos> - Yeah, work.<eos> Boston.
And this.<eos> - What work?<eos> - Yeah, work.<eos> Boston.<eos> Normalcy.
Amen.<eos> Amen.<eos> That was awkward.<eos> Was that speech directed at us?<eos> Not at us but...
Amen.<eos> That was awkward.<eos> Was that speech directed at us?<eos> Not at us but...<eos> Aria maybe.
But not in a place like this.<eos> Although, it... it would be fitting.<eos> A humble end for a humble beginning.<eos> Just as when you were a boy... your destiny is to be saved.<eos> Fox, anyone?
They're not here.<eos> You'd take the word of a round eye over blood?<eos> Sad, isn't it?<eos> But his words have proven true.<eos> - Whereas yours...
And do you believe it is our duty to reclaim the Holy Lands?<eos> I do.<eos> And do you believe it is our Christian duty to spread the gospel?<eos> There is no greater duty.<eos> To all peoples?
I do.<eos> And do you believe it is our Christian duty to spread the gospel?<eos> There is no greater duty.<eos> To all peoples?<eos> -Even the Saracens and the non-Christians?
And do you believe it is our Christian duty to spread the gospel?<eos> There is no greater duty.<eos> To all peoples?<eos> -Even the Saracens and the non-Christians?<eos> -Most importantly, the non-Christians.
"But if they can learn to stand together, like a bundle of arrows, -they're unbreakable..." -Hmm.<eos> Genghis can unify wolf and fox with his parables.<eos> That may take more than a parable.<eos> He hasn't breathed a word of this.<eos> Not to me.
Beginning with Professor Boardman and then with Carter, their heroism is... an inspiration to us all.<eos> And a reminder that one person acting alone can't save the world.<eos> Come back to me.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Both of you.
Chantal, our sad sack with a dead fiancé; oh, and close-up on, uh, Hot Rachel.<eos> - Quinn, stop.<eos> - That's her name.<eos> Ladies, I urge you, open your hearts to your suitor,<eos> Darius Beck!
So he's supposed to spend the rest of his career bowing to the mercy of your twat? !<eos> - Excuse me?<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> That was out of line.<eos> Your twat!
You know what?<eos> Let me just talk to Darius.<eos> - I can talk some sense... - No.<eos> This is grown-up time, all right?<eos> Way over your head.
No. N-N-N-No.<eos> Ruby, stop.<eos> You can't wear this on camera. It's a copyright issue.<eos> Watch me.<eos> Jesus.
It was me.<eos> The first black suitor.<eos> It was me!<eos> We're gonna make history.<eos> Everyone, shh.
What the hell is he doing with the camera?<eos> I'm sorry Rachel made you do that.<eos> You okay?<eos> That was amazing.<eos> Places, places.
Holy shit.<eos> So, what do we do now?<eos> We go in for the kill.<eos> Hey, Brandi. I'm here to get you ready for the date.<eos> What date?
Okay, first of all, I want to say thank you for all your hard work yesterday.<eos> I've seen some of the footage, and, uh, I'll tell you, the episode is great.<eos> It may be one of our best.<eos> And that is because of you.<eos> All of you.
Ladies, open your hearts to your suitor,<eos> Darius Beck!
Here's how this works.<eos> You tell me the truth, and then we work together as a team.<eos> Or not.<eos> You ready?<eos> For what?
Congratulations.<eos> You showed me, huh?<eos> I guess you can make this show without me.<eos> Look, Quinn, I know we're fighting about work stuff, but...<eos> Work stuff?
- Come on, man. Let me buy you a drink.<eos> - No.<eos> - How's it going?<eos> - Uh, back him up.<eos> - For you?
- We're not doing another take.<eos> - I saw images of, like, other shit.<eos> Darius?<eos> Hey, how you doing?<eos> Good, no thanks to you.
We need an answer, Darius, now on live television.<eos> - Uh... - What the hell is he doing?<eos> - Uh... - He looks like a sheep.<eos> It's called a panic attack, Quinn.<eos> Oh, please, okay.
Hey, Rachel?<eos> I thought you were gone.<eos> I was on my way back to the hotel, but I realized I had to look you in the face and ask you why are you still here with Quinn in this place.<eos> You don't get to judge me just because you're jealous.<eos> - Jealous?
We need to get him to the med bay now.<eos> Oh, gentlemen, I trust everything went according to plan at the Bolshoi?<eos> Piece of cake.<eos> Made contact with Vostok and swiped her badge.<eos> Thanks to me.
Yes, I do. If it'll even be necessary.<eos> Maybe we can go home in a week or two.<eos> We could hide somewhere.<eos> Home to what?<eos> Our life. Our home.
Like innocence and hope for mankind, I number it now amongst the lost things.<eos> Pity.<eos> I was very sorry to see you go.<eos> Been a fellow by now, if you'd stayed the course.<eos> I really...
And, for their trust, we make sure they get something back, more than they originally gave.<eos> Look, if I trust you with something guaranteed to get you what you want that's got to be worth something, hasn't it?<eos> Like what?<eos> Letting you walk out?<eos> - Not just me.

Someone said you and she...<eos> Me and Ingrid?<eos> No. Oh.<eos> We went for a drink once, when she first started night school, but it didn't go nowhere.<eos> Anywhere.
I locked up soon as the last had gone.<eos> Went to the working man's on Ward Lane.<eos> So she couldn't have got in, even if she wanted to.<eos> Someone also said that she received a phone call here.<eos> A personal call.
Strange found evidence at his hut.<eos> A pair of knickers with Sandra Jordan's initials written on the wash tag.<eos> A length of rope in his glove compartment.<eos> You could have had him!<eos> Clean and by the book.
- Mary<eos> It's Sunday Please, have some shame.<eos> I will not.<eos> - Mm. I think he's smiling over here.<eos> - At you
No more colored restrooms.<eos> No more white restrooms.<eos> Just plain old toilets.<eos> Go wherever you damn well please.<eos> Preferably closer to your desk.
You've always been honest with me.<eos> Yeah, well, everything is a little bit different now.<eos> Look, last night... it was your first night home after three months, and I was happy to let you be with your friends, but... This morning, I wanted to do something nice for your first day back at school.<eos> When I couldn't find you, it kinda felt like you were running away from me.<eos> I...
It's a computer.<eos> It's software with a keyboard terminal.<eos> I think I could figure it out.<eos> Good, 'cause we're gonna need it to run down this cell.<eos> We?
I'm Frank.<eos> This is Debbie.<eos> Did Tyler mention--<eos> Yeah, you're here to interview as a nanny.<eos> Uh, yeah.
So, do me a favor... pretend it never happened, and we'll just put this weekend behind us, okay?<eos> I'll check us out.<eos> Do you and your mother need a taxi?<eos> What?<eos> The lady.
Then you do something right for me, for this family.<eos> $4.99.<eos> Thank you.<eos> - Have a nice day.<eos> - You, too.
'Cause you're a...<eos> You've been walking in your sleep.<eos> You remember where?<eos> To the bus stop.<eos> Down to the bus stop.
She'll never walk again.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Some woman found Ms. Gordon, name of Colleen Miles.<eos> She found the, uh, victim in a state of undress.<eos> Undress?
No, I'll survive.<eos> Go after him.<eos> I want him brought in.<eos> And I want it done by the book.<eos> By the book!
Kill me.<eos> Indeed.<eos> Absolutely right.<eos> Kill him now, sister, or let me.<eos> Far kinder to him, far safer for us.
And you will help me in this.<eos> And if I am unable to assist you?<eos> What would you do to someone who came between you and your child?<eos> You're okay?<eos> Thanks to you.
What I am is clear of this place once and for all.<eos> Of my father.<eos> And you.<eos> And you let your people go so easily?<eos> My people?
And if I know anything, it is this.<eos> You are made for the day, not the night.<eos> There, sir, you are wrong.<eos> She is halfway his already.<eos> Who?
You are made for the day, not the night.<eos> There, sir, you are wrong.<eos> She is halfway his already.<eos> Who?<eos> The Dragon.
Miss Ives approached me looking for information on a creature that she believed was hunting her.<eos> A vampire.<eos> Why did she come to you?<eos> I'm rather an expert.<eos> In vampires?
A vampire.<eos> Why did she come to you?<eos> I'm rather an expert.<eos> In vampires?<eos> In death.
- Run, Søren!<eos> - Hurry, guys!<eos> What's going on?<eos> The party's over!<eos> Knud!
- No, no!<eos> - It's going to be okay.<eos> Ma'am, we're gonna take care of your baby.<eos> - What do you need?<eos> - My wife.
It's good.<eos> Uh... how much of that did you hear?<eos> Uh, enough.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Sorry too.
- I can call Malia.<eos> - No, no, no.<eos> Don't, don't call anyone.<eos> Is there anyone else we need to notify?<eos> A next of kin?
- She's gone.<eos> That's it.<eos> That's where I found the bodies.<eos> Four of them.<eos> Any available units,
Safety first.<eos> I said I'd help you find the Desert Wolf.<eos> I didn't say it was gonna be easy.<eos> The restraints are to keep you from hurting yourself.<eos> Or me.
Well, I'm open to compromise.<eos> You still got the map with telluric currents on it?<eos> Bring it to the operating theater in two hours.<eos> How desperate are we?<eos> Incredibly.
Personally, I don't think we utilize torture nearly enough.<eos> Come...<eos> Did you hear that?<eos> Come to me...<eos> To me.
You're walkin' off?<eos> Then you're cowards, then, ain't you?<eos> If this matter between two kin like you say, let 'em settle it like kin.<eos> And how would that be, sister?<eos> The old way.
Well, I'm... i have everything I need here.<eos> And, uh, thank you very much for obliging.<eos> - Well, thank you.<eos> - What day's your trash day?<eos> Wednesday.
The Turtle?<eos> How do you know about him?<eos> No...<eos> No, I've just had a lot on my mind.<eos> Patty?
Hey...<eos> What?<eos> What do you want from me?<eos> The thing most precious to the Flash... you.<eos> Patty?
Wow.<eos> The cube truck driver's name was Nick Mazzara.<eos> He has a record of petty theft and dealing drugs but nothing violent.<eos> He was a driver of a medical supply company which gave him access to hospital supplies.<eos> Like helium.
Mm, yeah, maybe he can help us figure it out.<eos> Maybe he knows who we're lookin' for.<eos> Now this is someone your age?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I...
I'm waiting for a train.<eos> Yeah, it's probably running' late.<eos> I'm going to see my grandchildren.<eos> Who are you going to see?<eos> Uh, no one.
What did you want?<eos> I wanted my brother.<eos> Stop lying to yourself.<eos> Who did you want in that moment before you buried all your secrets, before you learned how to hide from your pain?<eos> I...
Aya, how long has it been... eight, 900 years since you saw this?<eos> For the uninitiated... the charter of the Strix, written by... oh, yes... me.<eos> And it says here, it shall be my duty to uphold the tenants of the charter. Dah-dah, dah-dah, dah. Oh, this is important.<eos> "In the absence of a worthy leader, "charter shall be invoked, "and complete dominion shall be restored to...<eos> Elijah Mikaelson."
Okay, would you like me to toss you over first like a Frisbee?<eos> What else are we supposed to do?<eos> Come on!<eos> Team Sparia.<eos> Old time's sake?
You, give me a hand.<eos> Umm, your tacky, little panda bear mug it's in that box with the rest of your things.<eos> You can just take that and go.<eos> Hand.<eos> Hand.
Um, I'll give you a call as soon as I know.<eos> Okay.<eos> So, what's up?<eos> You and I need to talk about Ezra Fitz.<eos> And the book.
When?<eos> Tonight.<eos> At The Radley.<eos> - She was on her way to Toronto.<eos> - Through Pennsylvania?
'They're gonna keep chipping away at us' until there's nothing left.<eos> What did you tell the others about Ali's accident?<eos> Nothing... yet.<eos> - I wanted to talk to you first.<eos> - Why me?
Clearly, but manners costeth nothing, as my nanny used to say.<eos> Did Nanny tell you that photographs do?<eos> Which means for the duration of our arrangement you will do things my way.<eos> Good boy.<eos> Reset.
Oh!<eos> Oh, for God's sake!<eos> Begging your pardon, Madam.<eos> Goodfellow!<eos> Ma'am.
Did you take voice lessons?<eos> Move, Thea.<eos> Stay away from her!<eos> Oh, I would never hurt her.<eos> You, on the other hand...
Does beating up on your little brother give you a little thrill?<eos> I'm not proud of what I did, Andy.<eos> In fact, I'm ashamed of it.<eos> You, John?<eos> Mr. High and Mighty?
Wonder what took her so long.<eos> What was that about?<eos> Donna called it quits.<eos> Oh. I'm sorry to hear that.<eos> Yeah, yeah, me, too.
Oh, my God.<eos> ♪ I'm in love with you ♪ Whatever you're thinking of doing, you don't have to.<eos> Just let us go.<eos> We won't tell anyone.<eos> No one.
Your honor, this is ridiculous.<eos> The defendant's name is Damien Darhk<eos> According to whom?<eos> You? Oliver Queen? The media?<eos> Heh.
Their "beehavior" can be appalling sometimes...<eos> But it's a necessary evil.<eos> You see, I needed your full attention.<eos> What the hell do you want?<eos> Straight to the point.
People even worship the responsible party.<eos> This might smart a little.<eos> I'm pulling the oxygen out of your bodies, molecule by molecule, but here's the good news.<eos> I'm not going to kill you.<eos> Well, not right now, at least.
Don't you dare talk about my mother.<eos> Fine. Let's talk about the future instead.<eos> Genesis is coming.<eos> With Machin running around, we can't have another x-factor on the loose.<eos> "We"?
Probably at her house?<eos> You're hilarious, Meg.<eos> Hey, so, uh, what kind of movies do you and your friends like?<eos> Well, Ruth likes...<eos> Not her.

You'll be safe in jail, Kyle.<eos> - They can't get to you.<eos> - I've been waiting for you, Cole.<eos> I can take you to The Witness now.<eos> The Witness?
I had quite a crush on you.<eos> Really?<eos> I thought you were totally annoying.<eos> Took me a while to get a hang of the girl thing.<eos> Yeah, me too.
- Gary?<eos> - Yes, Captain?<eos> Be a dear and open the portside bulkhead, would you?<eos> Look, I enjoy a suicide mission<eos> - as much as the next person...
- And you ask him, Lyudmida Ivanovna!<eos> Let's ask the boy!<eos> "It's just that Elena Lvovna says, That we must trust our instincts.<eos> Teacher:<eos> - What instincts?
- Yes, I do not care!<eos> And be careful, Because I will not be here soon, and I can not keep an eye on you.<eos> - And where are you going?<eos> "To my Father."<eos> "To your father?"
Oh, it's too frilly.<eos> She looks like she's wearing my nanna's curtains.<eos> You're a prefect, are you?<eos> I hope you give everyone what for.<eos> - Even the boys?

And I thought you should know that.<eos> I see.<eos> How is Bella?<eos> I've, er, told Craig I'll keep an eye on his granny for him.<eos> A lot better now.
Help...!<eos> If you're here to help, I'm late.<eos> I have to get to the ferry before four.<eos> Um... I have to go away tomorrow.<eos> For work.
She says it's urgent.<eos> He's not answering his phone.<eos> I think he's...<eos> - He just left. - Left where?<eos> Yours?
Every last stitch.<eos> Of course, that was before people ordered on the internet.<eos> They say it's silk organza but you don't know it's not polyester until you've got it in your hands.<eos> I take it it would be too much to ask that you remember the names?<eos> No, sorry.
In return he was offering them something big.<eos> Nobody knows what it was but he did have a meeting with a junior fiscal called Brian McDade.<eos> Who told you this?<eos> Asha Israni.<eos> In confidence.
- Don't do that.<eos> - They know where we are.<eos> - I need to move fast, make my way up to the silo and secure the warhead.<eos> - Good luck.<eos> - You, too.
Tosh we'll find him.<eos> Sir!<eos> The woman was tested for stis and HIV.<eos> She was of no fixed abode, but she asked for the results to be sent to the person who'd brought her in.<eos> Michael Thompson.
This is what he'd have told you if he'd been here.<eos> I'm glad he found his way out of that world.<eos> I'm glad he found me.<eos> I'm sorry that we lost him for you.<eos> Me too.
You know you did the right thing by asking me to come and that's all that matters.<eos> Well, how'd it go?<eos> Yeah, OK.<eos> I-I think she felt better.<eos> - And what about you? - Oh...
What about you?<eos> Parents are gone.<eos> Cancer.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Yeah, me, too.
- Maybe I've changed my ways.<eos> - Have you?<eos> Listen, the truth is, I owe people money.<eos> How much?<eos> What people?
And yet you stayed.<eos> I am not about to let good bourbon go to waste.<eos> And you?<eos> Are you working?<eos> The truth?
Looking...<eos> "Nice-looking" I think is what you're trying to say.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Are you jealous?<eos> Of that guy?
And then just when he thinks he can't take it anymore, we'll use his frustration against him.<eos> Anyone else feeling restless?<eos> Yeah, I'm glad you said it.<eos> How about we bring this to a close?<eos> Close?
You were in the Army?<eos> - The four years after college.<eos> - Totally.<eos> She's one of the first female Army Rangers, and she could really use your help.<eos> "She"?
Mickey Shive was waiting for me.<eos> What do you think they're gonna do with it?<eos> Sell it, of course.<eos> Same as me.<eos> To whom?
He says they were together for 15 years, that he was loyal to her, but that he felt like a prisoner, being with her.<eos> He says that he could hardly stand to touch her, that she repulsed him.<eos> He says that he would have left her a long time ago, but that this woman is so fragile, so damaged that he was scared to leave her.<eos> He was scared that she might hurt herself, or him.<eos> Or... me.
Well, look at the size of it.<eos> It's enormous, isn't it?<eos> Best make $20 million, I think.<eos> - $20 million?<eos> - By Saturday?
Okay.<eos> So, how do you guys know each other?<eos> Me and Sophie?<eos> I was a total fangirl.<eos> Of...?
So we're gonna make her a better deal.<eos> - We're gonna make her feel loved. - How?<eos> She's got round-the-clock U.S. Marshals on her to make sure that Hamlin's team doesn't try and kill her.<eos> We're not getting anywhere<eos> - near Leah Wells.
- Iowa.<eos> - Oh.<eos> I give them you, and I get the beach house in Charleston.<eos> You know who they give the beach house in Charleston to?<eos> - Nobody.
We have Kelsey to think about.<eos> They're both so young.<eos> How old are they?<eos> Kelsey's 20.<eos> Tyler's 19.
And if anyone knows what's "official," it's a fish, y'all!<eos> Look, we're here on business, and you, young man, are the person we should be doing business with.<eos> So there's still a big check.<eos> It's just for Steve... my favorite boy.<eos> Our favorite boy.
And he is the Pope.<eos> Did you call for me, Holy Father?<eos> Papa!<eos> It all comes back to this in the end, doesn't it?<eos> To the mother.
God, not him, me.<eos> I looked at Spencer and I said:<eos> God, not him, me.<eos> I must have chanted those words a thousand times before they opened the voting again, like a mantra: not him, me, not him, me, not him, me, not him, me.<eos> And then, toward the end:
I'm the biggest narco around.<eos> And do you know how I became the biggest narco around?<eos> By cunning?<eos> No.<eos> By violence.
I don't want you to miss out on something that you've always wanted to do.<eos> And I wish that things were different for both of us.<eos> You know, but they're not.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Me too.
Not like this.<eos> I can't just ...<eos> I can't just say goodbye.<eos> I ... I have too much I want to say.<eos> Me, too.
I have a Labrador, yes.<eos> Get down !<eos> Yes, yes...<eos> Yes, they're very affectionate dogs.<eos> With children, but particularly with adults.
- No, you're wrong.<eos> You're wrong.<eos> They worship God!<eos> God!<eos> Our Lord!
You only popped out for a pint of milk and you were gone for a year.<eos> Thought you'd forgotten us.<eos> No!<eos> I've missed you lot.<eos> And all of this.
Possession and distribution of indecent images of a child under 18.<eos> Common sense will kick in.<eos> Safeguarding will take one look at this and throw it out.<eos> I hate to say this, but you can't repeat any of this to Safeguarding, your mum or to Taisie.<eos> I...
Well, I hope your cavalry moves fast, 'cause whoever organized this operation put a lot of time and resources into it.<eos> And they're gonna be looking door-to-door for the prize they missed.<eos> Could be only a matter of time before the bread crumbs lead them here.<eos> - I'm gonna call Beau.<eos> - "Magnum P.I."?
More than enough to buy a new Studebaker.<eos> Relax, mate. It's over.<eos> Well, is it?<eos> Who are you texting?<eos> My husband.
Tschick!<eos> Actually, I wouldn't be here if it weren't for Tatjana.<eos> Even though she had nothing to do with the whole thing.<eos> Is what I'm talking about hard to follow?<eos> Yeah, well, sorry.
Which means, sooner or later,<eos> I'm screwed.<eos> She turned me, thinking it would make Klaus run back to her arms.<eos> It didn't, so once she gets out, wherever she is, ripping my heart out will be number one on her to-do list!<eos> Whoa there.
- Uh, are you...?<eos> As per usual, our family faces a multitude of threats.<eos> The sooner you become acquainted with them, the better.<eos> - I won't have you distracted.<eos> - By Davina?
You don't have to do magic to feel it.<eos> Davina Claire. You are the best thing about being alive.<eos> You ain't mean what you said to him, so why'd you say it?<eos> Klaus kills people all the time.<eos> For rational reasons, irrational ones.
Same Mikaelson drama.<eos> One of you is trying to make peace, the other one is eyeing me like I'm a rabid dog.<eos> Well, then tell me my concerns are unfounded, Marcellus.<eos> Oh, what, I got to prove myself?<eos> To you?
Listen to me!<eos> All of you, listen to me!<eos> 'Cause we follow her to our graves!<eos> All right?<eos> To our graves!
W-w-why?<eos> Why?<eos> Where we goin'?<eos> I'll tell you on the way.<eos> On the way where? ! Sh...
You understand?<eos> Well, you know, I mean, I was raised a Christian.<eos> If his spirit doesn't rest, Wade, it's gonna come for us.<eos> For his mother.<eos> And me.
Well, you know, I mean, I was raised a Christian.<eos> If his spirit doesn't rest, Wade, it's gonna come for us.<eos> For his mother.<eos> And me.<eos> And then you, Wade.
There's some nights up there when the sky's so clear, there's more stars than you can count.<eos> The air is so sweet, can make your whole head lighter than a jug of wine.<eos> So why would you ever want to come down here?<eos> 'Cause you always gotta be ready for new wonders.<eos> Like those white things right there.
Well, this is the one time I feel more sorry for the men trying to stop the groom than the groom himself!<eos> Good luck to you, boys!<eos> Let's do it.<eos> Well, don't stand there like statues.<eos> - On your mark!
Good luck to you, boys!<eos> Let's do it.<eos> Well, don't stand there like statues.<eos> - On your mark!<eos> - On your mark!
Foster, listen to me, the only reason I came up here was to tell you one thing.<eos> Your people need you.<eos> Only the Bren'in can save us now, you understand?<eos> Only you.<eos> Wade to Dolan.
Your people need you.<eos> Only the Bren'in can save us now, you understand?<eos> Only you.<eos> Wade to Dolan.<eos> Wade to Dolan.
- Thanks.<eos> You're being released to go home.<eos> Oh. Thank you.<eos> Do you need us to call anyone?<eos> About what?
Shall I bring the dress?<eos> Of course.<eos> This chapel is very pretty.<eos> I think she'll like it.<eos> Uh, who?
Of course.<eos> This chapel is very pretty.<eos> I think she'll like it.<eos> Uh, who?<eos> My mother.
I know he is.<eos> All the kids are.<eos> We're their favorites.<eos> They need us.<eos> Who?
How? You're just gonna have to trust me.<eos> I do, more than anything.<eos> Nothing you say is ever gonna change that.<eos> Okay, but you have to trust me, too.<eos> All right.
So what are you doing down here?<eos> Don't you think you at least owe him a conversation?<eos> We had our conversation while he was Chronos, and he made his feelings about me very clear.<eos> And what about your feelings?<eos> About you?
You know I can't.<eos> But this town still needs a sheriff.<eos> Well, I'm not the law-and-order type... nor the staying-in-one-place type either.<eos> Well, we have that much in common at least.<eos> At least.
Would you believe it if I said I missed you?<eos> - No.<eos> - Smart man.<eos> Columbia education really paid off.<eos> No thanks to you.
Uh, good morning.<eos> Hey, Karen.<eos> Did you sleep well?<eos> Uh, not so much.<eos> You?
Hey, Karen.<eos> Did you sleep well?<eos> Uh, not so much.<eos> You?<eos> Me?
I know, but...<eos> - You think there's more to the story.<eos> Exactly.<eos> I mean, five different papers and not a word about the bullet he took to the brain, or his military record, or his family.<eos> Uh, his family?
But if I could dig through your files or I could check into your back issues, maybe I could figure it out.<eos> And anything that I find, anything that I can prove...<eos> The Bulletin gets the exclusive.<eos> Deal.<eos> Okay, deal.
Castle doesn't scare me.<eos> - Maybe he should.<eos> - I can take care of myself.<eos> I know... but I'd be saying it to Foggy.<eos> Or a Navy SEAL.
- Thank you.<eos> We make a good team, Matthew.<eos> Keep some pressure on it.<eos> What do you tell people?<eos> About?
The Yakuza.<eos> Actually, a ninja named Nobu.<eos> Nobu Yoshioka?<eos> What, you know him?<eos> By reputation.
It doesn't help.<eos> We can't even use his testimony because of you.<eos> It was all thrown out.<eos> I was only following your rules.<eos> - What rules?
- Why, Stick?<eos> - It's a long story.<eos> Now, what do you think you're doing?<eos> You have no right here, Matthew.<eos> Too little, too late, Matty.
Huh?<eos> So, uh, what, that's... the third time you've been in Frank Castle's crosshairs and escaped?<eos> Just lucky, I guess.<eos> Yeah, well, we both know that's a load of shit, but, you know, just in case I'm deposed one day, we'll say you're the luckiest lady on the planet.<eos> Deal?
I need to go home.<eos> I need...<eos> I need a shower.<eos> I need to eat, I need to sleep.<eos> I...
The Captain needs all hands on deck.<eos> Just why did Captain Bernier insist on confining Mr. Pimblett?<eos> What threat did he pose exactly?<eos> Well, I suppose Mr. Pimblett had become capricious, - aggressive even.<eos> - Toward Captain Bernier?
There's no way we can grab him here.<eos> Not with an army standing between us.<eos> Shh, I'm trying to listen to this guy.<eos> He gives a hell of a speech.<eos> Onward to victory!
Not with an army standing between us.<eos> Shh, I'm trying to listen to this guy.<eos> He gives a hell of a speech.<eos> Onward to victory!<eos> Onward to immortality!
Strap in.<eos> Sir, the Waverider just time-jumped.<eos> Order all available timeships to pursue.<eos> Sir, the captains aren't prepared for...<eos> All of them!
Whatever you're doing, do it faster.<eos> And... done.<eos> Now, Sara!<eos> Well, I suppose it's time to say good-bye.<eos> At least for now.
Sorry!<eos> Not you.<eos> Yes, I-I'll figure out a way into the party.<eos> It's not a problem.<eos> And-and again, I...
Just a little, you know, squabble with my bro.<eos> Nothing serious.<eos> I don't... I don't like how we left it at the auction.<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, I...
Evidence you almost destroyed.<eos> I got you the leverage you needed to crack Ronnie.<eos> You co-opted a sting operation for your own gain.<eos> And I solved another crime.<eos> Identity theft.
Yeah.<eos> You okay?<eos> Yeah, I'm fine.<eos> But we should talk.<eos> About everything.
Padre, does this not bother you?<eos> What can I say?<eos> I love this song.<eos> You sure you're gonna be okay in here, Father?<eos> This? Oh, absolutely.
Maybe she's The Spider.<eos> Ooh, black widow, then.<eos> Lovely. Wait.<eos> She's giving it to someone else.<eos> To Connor.
We may have more questions for you.<eos> Well.<eos> Isn't that a coincidence?<eos> Boy returns home, and, conveniently, his pops drops the next day?<eos> Lucky bastard.
Well, I was his inside woman, and now I'm yours.<eos> Why is it that sometimes I'm immortal... and other times I'm all too human?<eos> It appears that you make me vulnerable.<eos> Colligitur hoc sacrificare adulescentulam virginem magna atque magnifica.<eos> Lucifer!
I thought she knew me.<eos> I thought I knew her.<eos> And now you don't trust her anymore?<eos> Oh, it's just this whole immortality thing.<eos> Uh, for some reason,
Yeah.<eos> And, uh, as you can see, the Devil does indeed wear Prada.<eos> Wow, thanks, brother.<eos> Yes, disastrous with those trousers, though.<eos> Oh, what the hell?
And he's breaking into song.<eos> Why-why are you enjoying yourselves? !<eos> Tim is dead!<eos> Shame on you.<eos> And shame on all of you.
That photo was from a few days ago.<eos> The school would be almost finished by now.<eos> Unless it was never built.<eos> Unless the money the foundation raised went somewhere else.<eos> Or to someone else.
Where are you going?<eos> Lucifer thinks I abandoned him.<eos> I need to find him.<eos> So you're-you're brothers?<eos> Unfortunately.
Well,<eos> Detective Espinoza,<eos> I... didn't know you had the stones.<eos> No more Detective Douche?<eos> Well, not today, at least.
Shelley, Prometheus Unbound.<eos> In this room, I've created things that have enabled people to live in ways they never imagined.<eos> Changed the world.<eos> All that means nothing now.<eos> Because of you.
You're from Mars?<eos> You're from Krypton.<eos> But why stay hidden?<eos> I'm trying to make the world a safe place for everyone.<eos> Humans and aliens alike.
(SIGHS) My wife and daughters<eos> burned.<eos> I escaped.<eos> I survived.<eos> To my great shame.
Who's got Indigo?<eos> It was Barry's, but nobody's gonna cover them now.<eos> They just finished the new album.<eos> - I liked the first one.<eos> - You and nobody else.
- What movie?<eos> - The...<eos> "The Godfather."<eos> I didn't care for it.<eos> No, no, me either, really.
You go home.<eos> So how was your dinner with Margaret? I...<eos> I left early.<eos> - Really?<eos> - On her advice.
She was a friend of Mother's.<eos> Let's just say she rules the roost in that family.<eos> You didn't have to do all this.<eos> You really didn't.<eos> That poor boy...
What we got out of Hungary?<eos> I gave my share away.<eos> There are hundreds of thousands arriving in Israel every year with nothing.<eos> Anna's share of our family fortune went to Reggie.<eos> And now Kitty.
I've done something wicked.<eos> And I've never felt more alive.<eos> I put a guinea on Devil's Banquet.<eos> Sidney, it won.<eos> 33 to one!
She died anyway, and Price walked.<eos> Do you really believe that the same person who killed Eric also murdered this Tamika and her baby?<eos> Well, you might be the best person to answer that question.<eos> Plus, you did all the work on Emile.<eos> Emile Fisher?
- No. No. - You used it to kill Tamika and her baby, and you put it in his church to frame Reverend Price.<eos> No! No, no, no!<eos> I already went over this bullshit about where I left the UZI with the detective that picked me up from Solano, okay?<eos> Detective?<eos> What detective?
Well, we look at people who've been shattered and different as less than.<eos> What if they're more than us?<eos> What?<eos> Do you believe them?<eos> Your patients.
- Trusted?<eos> How can you trust someone who stabs their best friend in the back?<eos> I did not stab you in the back.<eos> Please, you're just running against me because you're jealous I'm not living in your shadow anymore.<eos> Lexi:
Sometimes my music.<eos> Well, there you go.<eos> It's probably a sign, huh?<eos> - I'm sorry that got so ugly.<eos> - Me too.
And when I find them, they'll be sorry because I will punish them in ways that I haven't even dreamed up yet.<eos> Therewillbe nofurtherdistractions toourB.L.A.A.R preparation.<eos> The microphone is on the Fritz, sir.<eos> You may wanna wrap it up.<eos> I...
And that's a way of saying that someone is in trouble.<eos> I don't know what's going on with Rafe.<eos> He didn't even try my candied bacon tarts with goat cheese ganache.<eos> Ooh!<eos> More for me.
I think it's the opposite of stupid.<eos> You know, Picasso once said,<eos> "everything you can imagine is real."<eos> I like that.<eos> Yeah, me too.
I know what you mean.<eos> I'm starting again.<eos> I haven't felt like this since Ludlow.<eos> Are you gonna get on with it or make speeches?<eos> Not another peep!
Shackleton and Hayward can be in the region in a matter of days.<eos> I appreciate that, sir, but those ships need to be in Japan, investigating the possibility of the virus mutation.<eos> And a larger presence here may draw attention, and it could be counterproductive.<eos> I need a lower profile.<eos> You?
I understand you have seniority over her, but I cannot afford to lose you running combat right now.<eos> You think I made the wrong call...<eos> Not contacting the CO when I sensed there was trouble in Vietnam.<eos> That... was a difficult decision.<eos> 50/50 in my book.
Resistance?<eos> We were just trying to keep it simple.<eos> Helping smugglers is a few days in jail.<eos> Helping your kind is a bullet in the head.<eos> Madame...
Just look, we have your money!<eos> You see?<eos> I won't be able to spend it - hanging in a German jail!<eos> - You let them go...<eos> - Madame, please!
What?<eos> Now in three weeks, the Allies are mounting an operation on the coast of France.<eos> I've already told the others, but what they don't know is what it's really about.<eos> Why wouldn't you tell them?<eos> Why just me?
The owners of this place?<eos> I got to be honest with you, kid.<eos> I have no idea where they are.<eos> No more bras!<eos> No more bras!
AA?<eos> Look, I can assure you I'm-- 90 meetings in 90 days at the Alcoholics Anonymous chapter of your choosing.<eos> You'll also perform some form of community service...<eos> Come on.<eos> ...not of your choosing.
She'd gone abroad.<eos> - That's what you said.<eos> - I lied.<eos> I didn't want to publicize our private life.<eos> Fortunately,
You're very alike.<eos> - He's very thirsty.<eos> - Ah, sorry!<eos> To Élise.<eos> Better not, in your condition.
Oh, shit!<eos> He heard everything!<eos> So there was no leak.<eos> We gave him everything!<eos> Shit!
He heard everything!<eos> So there was no leak.<eos> We gave him everything!<eos> Shit!<eos> Shit!
Jackie's crazy, right?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, I know.<eos> She told you about Kyle?<eos> Uh...
- Let's go.<eos> Come on, come on!<eos> Angel, come on!<eos> Move, move!<eos> To the car!
It'll be small and tactical, but you're going in there with a team.<eos> Good luck, Mr. Fet.<eos> And to you, Councilwoman.<eos> - Good hunting.<eos> - You too.
- Hi.<eos> I'm looking for a Captain Rogers?<eos> - Uh, I guess just over there.<eos> - Right over there?<eos> - At the table, yeah.
I got no desire to save D.C.<eos> Yeah. I got that.<eos> Well... best of luck to you, Fet.<eos> Yeah.<eos> You too.
Yeah.<eos> You too.<eos> Another double.<eos> I got it.<eos> - Another for me.
According to reports, you're having trouble holding battle lines.<eos> Not true.<eos> - We're making progress.<eos> - Where are you making progress?<eos> All throughout Manhattan...
- She left town with her mother.<eos> You didn't go with her?<eos> Wasn't invited.<eos> - Sorry.<eos> - Yeah. Me, too.
Imagine - you're Marcus Knight.<eos> You've put a load of money in a safety deposit box, and you know you're going to prison.<eos> What are you going to do with the key?<eos> - Give it to someone for safekeeping.<eos> - But who?
Find anything yet, JP?<eos> Seven points of comparison.<eos> That's admissible in court.<eos> Who does the fingerprint belong to?<eos> Neil Jenkins.
And last night?<eos> - Er, stayed in.<eos> Went to bed early.<eos> - On your own?<eos> Yeah, sadly, yes.
- Yes.<eos> But he's got exceptional hearing.<eos> Whatever works.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Madam.
The Inspector was really getting into it, you know, putting on one DVD after another.<eos> I just fell asleep!<eos> She's laughing.<eos> But that's a good sign.<eos> Er... not always in my experience.
Our daughter is dead.<eos> Who are these people?<eos> They are from Paris.<eos> For sale.<eos> For a very good price.
Where's my King?<eos> You start!<eos> I'm going to ask you once more, why have you really come here?<eos> I made someone a promise.<eos> Who?
You start!<eos> I'm going to ask you once more, why have you really come here?<eos> I made someone a promise.<eos> Who?<eos> A girl.
To me!<eos> Throw it!<eos> Here!<eos> Give it here!<eos> - Not to him.
- Not to him.<eos> - No, you...<eos> Higher!<eos> My turn!<eos> To me!
I'm sorry.<eos> I can't do that.<eos> Have you ever had feelings of wanting to harm yourself?<eos> Others, sure.<eos> But myself?
- And then get the Board...<eos> Listen to him.<eos> You're alive.<eos> You're not dying.<eos> At least not today.
Where are we going?<eos> Well, you choose, Otto.<eos> I have redundant labs in Kosovo, Senegal, Oman.<eos> I should have let her die.<eos> Who?
- Relax.<eos> - I'm a friend of Mary's.<eos> - Oh, are you?<eos> And where exactly on the Venn diagram of Ms. Goodwin's life does your circle overlap with hers?<eos> The Venn...?
You'll find Duke Davis dead in his plane.<eos> He was killed by his son, who's in an ambulance.<eos> An accomplice is cuffed and in a hangar.<eos> I'll make the report after I pursue another lead.<eos> Why the Goodwin house?
You can't shoot a man for listening to God, can you?<eos> You guys have a plan?<eos> Way out of the country, place to lay low?<eos> What the hell's that got to do with my rights?<eos> You in a lot of pain?
Duval, come to the bar with me.<eos> Let's get another round, huh?<eos> Anybody want a drink?<eos> Um, just a beer.<eos> Yes, a beer.
Hey, we need to talk about the money.<eos> The usual place.<eos> Okay, thank you. I'll be right over.<eos> Otto, I need a surveillance system for an area that's too heavily wooded for a drone.<eos> With the biometrics?
Oh, we didn't order dessert.<eos> Rote Grutze.<eos> You and your husband were kind enough to be our guests last month.<eos> If you enjoy this special offering, please tell your husband.<eos> And others.
- Were you able to sleep?<eos> It doesn't matter.<eos> Working will help.<eos> - Understood.<eos> - You?
Everything you witnessed went to Section 9 to evaluate.<eos> You know, the scan... also turned up the number of glitches.<eos> They've been getting worse.<eos> Since when?<eos> Since the deep dive.
You killed 98 innocent people?<eos> No, I didn't kill anyone.<eos> You wouldn't be here.<eos> You wouldn't exist if it weren't for those experiments.<eos> Experiments?
You're gonna piss me off.<eos> What's it like down there?<eos> It's cold and dark.<eos> Just a million miles away.<eos> No voices.
What's it like down there?<eos> It's cold and dark.<eos> Just a million miles away.<eos> No voices.<eos> No data streaming.
It's cold and dark.<eos> Just a million miles away.<eos> No voices.<eos> No data streaming.<eos> Just... nothing.
This group is lethal, and they don't care who or what gets in their way.<eos> I was hoping you'd be interested in headlining the next fight card.<eos> Seventy feet across, 90 feet down.<eos> Three inches of security glass?<eos> No rope.

Agent Clearidge worked closely with Gibbons.<eos> She'll handle support for the operation.<eos> And I bet a guy like you needs a lot of support.<eos> What are you?<eos> Like 220?
No. "Safe" isn't in my vocabulary.<eos> Touche.<eos> You are Xander Cage.<eos> Anything you need, Becky can source it within the hour.<eos> Except for any sort of illegal drugs.
Oh, you're pissing up the wrong tree, Cage.<eos> I came looking for you, remember?<eos> Yo, asshole.<eos> We gonna have problems?<eos> Oh, no problem.
Pin 'em down!<eos> Damn! I'm out of bullets.<eos> You got any?<eos> No.<eos> Nothing.
No.<eos> Nothing.<eos> I'm empty.<eos> - We go on three.<eos> Wassup?
Oh. Smile!<eos> Hey, just something for you to think about.<eos> Me to you.<eos> You're welcome.<eos> Um, what the fu...
You're right.<eos> Yeah.<eos> You're right.<eos> It's none of my business if you cheated on me with her.<eos> What?
No.<eos> She doesn't want to dance.<eos> Maybe I should have a word with her actual father?<eos> He's not here.<eos> Same with mine.
We don't, because we don't know anything about her.<eos> She's temperamental.<eos> She hasn't had a drink and now she's puked up mini hotdogs.<eos> Do none of you care that that girl is obviously pregnant?<eos> What? Huh?
You want me to call Mr. Manny on these people?<eos> I have a confession to make.<eos> I'm not actually a successful businessman.<eos> I was in prison because I stole<eos> $125,000 from the father of the bride.
$125,000 from the father of the bride.<eos> It was not a table of honor.<eos> I have a bag of dope in my room.<eos> Room 115 for the dope in case any of you feel that a bag of dope would be fun to do.<eos> Not you.
Who else would've wanted that?<eos> You asked my father if you could.<eos> You renamed the family diner after yourself.<eos> That was your idea.<eos> What?
And not just on his face.<eos> But, yeah, otherwise, I'm all fine so just let me know when you want to start the intercourse.<eos> What?<eos> What?<eos> What?
I can't not be in love with you.<eos> You screw up all the time.<eos> But so do I. Way worse!<eos> Great toast, folks!<eos> Goodnight!
It's a permission slip.<eos> Literally.<eos> "Dear Mitch,<eos> "I am pleased to write you on behalf of Mr. Matt Brody."<eos> - Right. Well, no free passes. - Yeah.
What you need is to understand that if you're going to be on this team,<eos> - you got to earn it.<eos> So, why don't we start this whole thing over, just like gentlemen?<eos> Where you from, One Direction?<eos> Iowa?
Did that really just happen?<eos> It did.<eos> He slapped me.<eos> Yeah. His hands were soft and supple though,<eos> - like a woman.
It did.<eos> He slapped me.<eos> Yeah. His hands were soft and supple though,<eos> - like a woman.<eos> No offense.
- Really?<eos> Yeah, absolutely.<eos> I was stuck in a woman for hours once.<eos> Couldn't get out.<eos> - Totally the same, yeah?
It's cool. She won't mind at all.<eos> Thank you so much.<eos> This is really cool of you guys.<eos> No problem.<eos> What the fuck?
Wait, Leeds did say there'd be an open house tonight, right?<eos> Yes, she did.<eos> And we're all going.<eos> What'd you find on Chen?<eos> No criminal record.
And we're all going.<eos> What'd you find on Chen?<eos> No criminal record.<eos> No fetishes.<eos> No weird photos.
I'm going in.<eos> - All right.<eos> - Tell me what you see.<eos> Hair.<eos> Lots of hair.
Okay. My bad.<eos> Except for there's no fucking such thing as "lifeguard pursuit"!<eos> Police do pursuits!<eos> When you do it, it's just some guys chasing some other guys.<eos> - No offense.
If I was a man, you'd call me "driven."<eos> - No! - Let's go, boys.<eos> You have to listen to me!<eos> Have a nice swim.<eos> What the fuck?
Honey. As usual, I have to do everything myself.<eos> - Mitch!<eos> - Don't bother.<eos> He's dead.<eos> - Because of you.
- Mitch!<eos> - Don't bother.<eos> He's dead.<eos> - Because of you.<eos> - Of course because of me.
My skill comes through experience, and a certain, um, sensitivity. Sensitivity.<eos> You have no children of your own.<eos> No. Hmm.<eos> Your son. He prefers English?<eos> His mother.
I think he understands that.<eos> Enough.<eos> Sit down.<eos> Now you may go.<eos> Good night, Jakob.
We've been under her spell too long, not only Jakob, all of us.<eos> Forgive me.<eos> I can't.<eos> No, Jakob needs you.<eos> For him.
What do you mean?<eos> Where is she?<eos> She's dead.<eos> On the day of Malvina's funeral, she put stones in her pockets and walked into the lake.<eos> Verena.
All right, back to Sisyphus.<eos> What's his character like?<eos> Does he learn from pushing that Boulder, and it...<eos> Hey. Val-a-gram delivery.<eos> Happy cupid day.
-Sorry.<eos> It was an emergency in the tribulation.<eos> A minor laserjet explosion.<eos> Val-a-gram delivery.<eos> - Happy cupid day.
Here.<eos> Hold this.<eos> Okay.<eos> Okay.<eos> Twelve dollars?
They know that pet owners are all damaged and neurotic and we will... happily throw our money at the most nonsensical crap just to... buy a little affection.<eos> Yeah. Yeah, no shit.<eos> No shit.<eos> Oh, shit.<eos> What the fuck?
I spent so many years hating you and now I can't even remember why.<eos> I guess it drove me nuts that I was such a fucking mess... and nothing I did ever scared you away.<eos> Well, you remember this?<eos> Yeah.<eos> 29 stitches.
Yeah.<eos> How old?<eos> They're six and fifteen.<eos> Why?<eos> Oh, nothing.
Oh, brilliant, Watson!<eos> Definite college material.<eos> What are you gonna major in, brain surgery?<eos> So, Claire, have you been thinking about school yet?<eos> Fuck, no.
I want to hear this.<eos> I just need to finish this email.<eos> I mean, I feel like I'm fading into oblivion while... everyone else is scampering to keep up.<eos> Fifty years from now, there won't even be the slightest trace of my existence.<eos> Nothing.
Where do we stand, Mercia?<eos> We're down to the last men of the right age, and still no one has pulled the sword.<eos> Now put the bird back in the aviary, Catia.<eos> There's a general restlessness among the people.<eos> More incidents.

Now, come on, kid.<eos> You're cooking dinner.<eos> What is it that Vortigern cares about most in the world?<eos> Killing you.<eos> Apart from that.
I know the man that supplies brandy to the palace.<eos> Shipment first of the month.<eos> All right, Dan. Wine or brandy? - Brandy.<eos> - Open the doors.<eos> What a waste of brandy.
All right, Dan. Wine or brandy? - Brandy.<eos> - Open the doors.<eos> What a waste of brandy.<eos> But doesn't it make the palace burn well?<eos> 10,000 boys.
You silly bastards.<eos> Determined to die.<eos> Shit. On my command!<eos> I'm going down the hole now.<eos> After you.
Where do you get a jacket like this?<eos> Makes you walk different.<eos> Get you a hundred jackets like that.<eos> How long you lived here?<eos> About two weeks.
So happy to meet you.<eos> Where do you find it?<eos> When you're young, it's not always easy to know what is the light.<eos> - I don't understand either.<eos> - Except for you.
Did we meet before?<eos> - Did we?<eos> - I've seen you before.<eos> - Where?<eos> - Lots of times.
Because you promised to build a log cabin on a lake.<eos> This was his favorite.<eos> A man of taste.<eos> Straight up.<eos> No ice, no water, no chaser... No shit.
She's close.<eos> A little jump. Few weeks.<eos> Wouldn't even have to go back into hypersleep.<eos> And how long is it going to take to get to Origae-6?<eos> Seven years, four months.

We're a colony mission.<eos> Really?<eos> How extraordinary.<eos> How many colonists?<eos> Over two thousand.
Damn frustrating, I'd say.<eos> You disturbed people.<eos> I beg your pardon?<eos> You were too human.<eos> Too idiosyncratic.
I just thought we were gonna find...<eos> This was gonna be our new home.<eos> And we've lost five...<eos> We lost five crew members.<eos> - Because of my decisions...
Among living things.<eos> I was badly injured on our mission, you see.<eos> She put me back together.<eos> I'd never known such kindness.<eos> Certainly not from Mr. Weyland.

It's for farmers and that.<eos> Dudes who need to tend to the livestock.<eos> It's not for junkies who need to score.<eos> So that was me.<eos> No job, no money.

Should last another 30 years, they said, but... they didn't say what to do with those 30 years.<eos> Two or three, fine, I'll take that.<eos> I can cope with that.<eos> I can think of enough things to do to piss away what remains.<eos> But... 30?

I'm sorry, Franco.<eos> Don't fucking move.<eos> I did steal the money, but they shouldn't have been surprised.<eos> I mean, we stole from all sorts of people.<eos> Shops, businesses, neighbors, family.

Where is Belle?<eos> The beast took her and she...<eos> There are no such things as beasts.<eos> Or talking teacups.<eos> Or magic!
Oh, I could sing<eos> Of the pain these dark days bring<eos> The spell we're under<eos> Still it's the wonder of us I sing of tonight<eos> How in the midst of all this sorrow
I'll tell you when you're older.<eos> Okay, I'm older!<eos> Chip... You are a one.<eos> What are you reading?<eos> Nothing.
Okay, I can fix this.<eos> Beautiful!<eos> But something is missing.<eos> Oh, yes.<eos> The finishing touch.
Yes, it is.<eos> I could try to pick the lock.<eos> After all... it's only gears and springs.<eos> But I would need... something long and sharp.<eos> Like that.
What happened?<eos> It's my fault.<eos> He got bored.<eos> He actually said that? Yeah.<eos> Kind of, more or less.
Kind of, more or less.<eos> And then I thought if I came on this trip and I came away with you, and I had fun and I showed that I could be fun, somehow he would come back, but...<eos> Come on. - What?<eos> - Come on, we have to get dressed.<eos> - For what?
Adios.<eos> I'll see you tomorrow.<eos> Sí.<eos> Adios.<eos> Buenas noches.
It's okay, they're gonna come and get us.<eos> Read me your air.<eos> Um... um... it says 80 bar.<eos> At this depth, that means we have about 20 minutes, tops, before you run out.<eos> What about you?

Someone has come along.<eos> Alert.<eos> Alert.<eos> Hey, uh, you need a hand?<eos> Ready?

A week, that is.<eos> You best stay where you are, pal.<eos> I'm the law out here.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> What in high...
Look...<eos> This place.<eos> Okay?<eos> Your nurse, she read too many stories, you understand?<eos> Too many stories!
And now I've got 20 students running out of a classroom in a panic.<eos> Students telling me that Neil's desk has been smashed to pieces, presumably by a fire ax, and you're telling me that you haven't seen anything today?<eos> Yeah.<eos> How about you, Strickland? Huh?<eos> Nothing?
You know how when you do one of these and you're like, "Oh, my God."<eos> And then your hands are flying in front of your face, and, like, that can look like chopping.<eos> But you were right there.<eos> He had the best view<eos> - of his own seat.
My car's already fucked up!<eos> But we have to put our foot down on the car, sir.<eos> - Off my car!<eos> - Okay, okay!<eos> What the fuck!
Are you fucking kidding me?<eos> Yeah, because you know what I don't do?<eos> I don't swing axes at the students.<eos> Yeah, that's a little bit of a step too far, I think.<eos> But not for you.
- Yeah.<eos> - All right.<eos> Go to sleep.<eos> Go to sleep.<eos> Nighty-night.
- All right.<eos> Go to sleep.<eos> Go to sleep.<eos> Nighty-night.<eos> Nighty-night.

So here's to our brewery!<eos> The best in the West.<eos> Watch.<eos> She won't even take a sip.<eos> Too many calories.
You look tired.<eos> I'm not.<eos> I'll take you to see Dr. McKee.<eos> A good dermatologist is your best friend and it is time for you to pull yourself together and get a new David.<eos> For your sake, and for Lily's.
David's gonna hear about this.<eos> I'm sure.<eos> That was beneath you.<eos> I'm gonna be in trouble.<eos> Me, too.
Hey, Mommy's gonna be okay.<eos> Okay.<eos> You ready?<eos> Okay, nice and slow.<eos> Ready?
Brother Ciarán?<eos> This is unwise.<eos> After Judas betrayed Christ, the apostles sought to replace him<eos> Matthias from Bethlehem was chosen.<eos> After the death and resurrection of our Lord,
That was a long time ago, Diarmuid.<eos> I was just a boy. A little older than you.<eos> No.<eos> No, there was never peace.<eos> Not here.
No.<eos> No, there was never peace.<eos> Not here.<eos> Nor anywhere else in the world.<eos> Not since the fall.
Your duty is to obey.<eos> Brother, there is a great war being fought all around us.<eos> Our enemy is the devil himself, and in this war.<eos> He waits a life time and an eternity for a single moment of weakness.<eos> Such as yours.
Helped them escape the trial.<eos> I served the Church in the best way of my ability.<eos> My conscience is clear.<eos> What else do you wish to know, boy?<eos> Nothing.
That is now the official version, the version anyone we want to will see.<eos> No need to go to the trouble of getting some sort of official pardon.<eos> You're off the hook, Mr Holmes.<eos> You're home and dry.<eos> OK, cheers.
"Because," said Death,<eos> "I had an appointment with you tonight..." "in Samarra."<eos> If this gets any better, I'm going to get two knives.<eos> Pays to advertise.<eos> So, what about Moriarty, then?
Yeah, Charlie Welsborough's the son of a Cabinet Minister, so I'm under a lot of pressure to get a result.<eos> Who cares about that?<eos> Tell me about the seats.<eos> The seats?<eos> - Yes, the car seats.
Sorry, what?<eos> Yes, well, you know how it is.<eos> All you do is clean up their mess, pat them on the head.<eos> Are you two having a little joke?<eos> Never a word of thanks.
I just...<eos> I'll...<eos> I'll just, um... Ahem.<eos> Now what's wrong?<eos> Not sure, I just...
Now what's wrong?<eos> Not sure, I just...<eos> By the pricking of my thumbs.<eos> Seriously?<eos> You?
The merchant goes to a different city and is perfectly fine.<eos> Goodnight, Mycroft.<eos> Then he becomes a pirate, for some reason.<eos> Keep me informed.<eos> Of what?
There was an old lady found dead in a sauna.<eos> Oh, yeah?<eos> How did she die?<eos> Hypothermia.<eos> What?
The right sleeve of your jacket, plus the formaldehyde mixed with your cologne and your complete inability to stop looking at your watch.<eos> Have a good time.<eos> I will.<eos> Trust me, though, she's not right for you.<eos> What?
So, how does that help us?<eos> What?<eos> Toby the hacker?<eos> Toby's not the hacker.<eos> What?
Hang on, Mary's better than me?<eos> Well, she is a retired super-agent with a terrifying skill-set.<eos> Of course she's better.<eos> Yeah, OK.<eos> Nothing personal.
Well...<eos> He's handy and loyal.<eos> That's hilarious.<eos> Hmm. Is it too early for a divorce?<eos> Oh. Barnicot's house, then.
Passed out again.<eos> It's no fun when they pass out!<eos> We'll come back later.<eos> What would he do if he knew, huh?<eos> About the English woman?
I glanced at it but I prefer to hear it from you.<eos> Why?<eos> Because I'll know the truth when I hear it.<eos> There were four of us, agents.<eos> Not just agents.
How many more times, Mr Sherlock?<eos> Hmm, maybe it's because I'm not familiar with the concept.<eos> Oh, hi, Mary.<eos> What concept?<eos> Happy families.
Oh, hi, Mary.<eos> What concept?<eos> Happy families.<eos> Nice trip?<eos> How the f...?
Yes.<eos> Uh-huh. You said it was your initials.<eos> In a way that was true.<eos> In a way?<eos> So many lies.
I didn't want that to fall into their hands.<eos> I was loyal, you see.<eos> Loyal to my friends.<eos> But they took me, tortured me.<eos> Not for information.
I was loyal, you see.<eos> Loyal to my friends.<eos> But they took me, tortured me.<eos> Not for information.<eos> Not for anything except fun.
I promise you,<eos> I haven't the foggiest idea what all this is about.<eos> You wound up AGRA and all the other freelancers.<eos> I haven't done any of the things you're accusing me of.<eos> Not one.
I haven't the foggiest idea what all this is about.<eos> You wound up AGRA and all the other freelancers.<eos> I haven't done any of the things you're accusing me of.<eos> Not one.<eos> Not. One.
It's like that old story.<eos> I really am a very busy man.<eos> Would you mind cutting to the chase?<eos> You're very sure of yourself, aren't you?<eos> With good reason.
AGRA too.<eos> Or so I thought.<eos> My secret was safe.<eos> But... apparently not.<eos> Just a little peace.
He says...<eos> John said if you were to come round asking after him, offering to help...<eos> Yes?<eos> He said he'd... ..that he'd rather have anyone but you.<eos> Anyone.
Washington notified the Viet Cong and North Vietnamese today that the withdrawal...<eos> Sir?<eos> Chapman.<eos> You need anything, sir?<eos> All good.
Isn't shooting a mapping mission a step down for a photojournalist?<eos> The right photo can help shape opinions.<eos> And win you a Pulitzer.<eos> Okay, Captain Conrad.<eos> What about you?
Isn't it odd the most dangerous places are always the most beautiful?<eos> I'm trying to take a long-exposure photograph, but my flashlight broke.<eos> Try this.<eos> Thank you.<eos> - Royal Air Force?
I didn't.<eos> I don't.<eos> You just said you woke up.<eos> I stopped lying down.<eos> Alone?
I don't.<eos> You just said you woke up.<eos> I stopped lying down.<eos> Alone?<eos> Of course, alone.
Go to the police.<eos> They're really excellent at dealing with this... complicated sort of stuff.<eos> Tell them I sent you.<eos> That ought to get a reaction.<eos> Night-night.
What's in it for you?<eos> We must be careful not to burn our bridges.<eos> SHERLOCK: Do you know why I'm gonna take your case?<eos> Because of the one impossible thing you said.<eos> FAITH: What impossible thing?
Don't you dare make jokes.<eos> Don't you dare!<eos> I was terrified.<eos> A cup of tea!<eos> Oh, for goodness' sakes!
Really?<eos> I correctly anticipated the responses of people I know well to scenarios I devised.<eos> -Can't everyone do that?<eos> -How?<eos> Except the boot.
Why would I be faking?<eos> Because you're a liar. You lie all the time, it's like your mission.<eos> I have been many things, John, but when have I ever been a malingerer?<eos> You pretended to be dead for two years!<eos> -Apart from that.
You can make more, if you like.<eos> Anytime you like.<eos> Has it occurred to you, anywhere in your drug-addled brain, that you've just been played?<eos> Oh, yes.<eos> -For an ad campaign.
You're welcome.<eos> Right.<eos> Here he comes. The internet tech.<eos> You all know Sherlock Holmes.<eos> Oh, and Dr Watson, of course.
-Poison?<eos> (LAUGHING) Drearcliff House.<eos> Remember that one, John?<eos> (EXHALES) One murder.<eos> -Ten suspects. -Ten. Yeah.
You're looking for a murderer in a tiny social grouping.<eos> Um, Mr Smith.<eos> Um, I'm just, uh, wondering maybe this isn't a suitable subject for the children. Nurse Cornish.<eos> -How long have you been with us now?<eos> -Seven years.
Um, Mr Smith.<eos> Um, I'm just, uh, wondering maybe this isn't a suitable subject for the children. Nurse Cornish.<eos> -How long have you been with us now?<eos> -Seven years.<eos> Seven years.
Come along.<eos> MARY: The game is on.<eos> Do you still miss me?<eos> Speaking of serial killers, you know who's my favourite?<eos> Other than yourself?
Saheed, isn't it?<eos> Saheed. Yes.<eos> -How long have you been working here now?<eos> -Four years.<eos> Four years.
-How long have you been working here now?<eos> -Four years.<eos> Four years.<eos> Well, that's a long time, isn't it?<eos> Four years.
Four years.<eos> Well, that's a long time, isn't it?<eos> Four years.<eos> Okay, everyone.<eos> -Five minutes?
You know what he did?<eos> He built a hotel, a special hotel, just to kill people.<eos> You know, with a hanging room, gas chamber, specially adapted furnace.<eos> You know, like Sweeney Todd.<eos> "Without the pies."
-Sherlock, what was he doing to you?<eos> Suffocating me.<eos> -Overdosing me.<eos> -On what?<eos> -Saline.
Utter, utter cock.<eos> Heard you the first time.<eos> How does that open?<eos> Screw the top.<eos> -Two weeks ago?
Go and solve a crime together, make him wear the hat.<eos> -You'll be okay for 20 minutes?<eos> -Yes, yes.<eos> Sorry, I wasn't thinking of Rosie.<eos> -No problem.
He's fine.<eos> So, you're off now, I won't see you for a week?<eos> Just spending it at home.<eos> Unless she calls.<eos> The PM.
My private number.<eos> Why would I need that?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Maybe you'd like a drink sometime.<eos> Of what?
Why?<eos> Conclusion three.<eos> You are terrified of her.<eos> You have no idea what you're dealing with.<eos> None at all.
Then what happened?<eos> Musgrave.<eos> The ancestral home where there was always honey for tea.<eos> And Sherlock played among the funny gravestones.<eos> Funny how?
Look at the violin.<eos> It's a Stradivarius.<eos> It's a gift.<eos> - Who from?<eos> - Me.
When I tell you to use it, and I will, remember what happened this time.<eos> What if I don't want a gun?<eos> The gun is intended as a mercy.<eos> - For whom?<eos> - You.
And the driver's asleep.<eos> No, I understand, but...<eos> Where did you come from?<eos> Where did the plane take off?<eos> My nan's.
Glasses, glasses.<eos> Nathan wears glasses.<eos> Evans was shot from 300 metres.<eos> Kickback from a gun with this calibre... would be massive.<eos> No cuts, no scarring.
Coffin.<eos> Problem, someone is about to die.<eos> It will be, as I understand it, a tragedy.<eos> So many days not lived.<eos> So many words unsaid.
There's no questioning who has to continue from here.<eos> It's us.<eos> You and me.<eos> Whatever lies ahead requires brain power, Sherlock.<eos> Not sentiment.
Her Christmas treat.<eos> Five minutes' conversation with Jim Moriarty five years ago.<eos> What did they discuss?<eos> Five minutes' conversation,<eos> unsupervised.
He was so excited.<eos> And here we are, the end of the line.<eos> Holmes killing Holmes.<eos> This is where I get off.<eos> Five minutes.
Yes, I know.<eos> Well, I'm sorry about that.<eos> We must have got cut off.<eos> How long was I away? Hours.<eos> Hours and hours.

Cookies are for closers.<eos> Let's have another show!<eos> No, Teddy!<eos> How about a hug?<eos> No more shows!
No more shows!<eos> Boss?<eos> There's plenty of love to go around.<eos> Go to sleep!<eos> Nighty-night.
God, this is so humiliating.<eos> God, this is so humiliating.<eos> Wait until Mom and Dad hear this.<eos> Hey, Templeton, what you got there?<eos> Nothing.
You wouldn't.<eos> Say bye-bye, baby!<eos> You're fired!<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Nothing.
I'm the Baby Jesus.<eos> No!<eos> You see, I'm more middle management for the company.<eos> The company?<eos> What company?
They can't see us or hear us.<eos> We're, like, virtual and stuff?<eos> Yep.<eos> You mean they won't feel this? Nope.<eos> Or this?
You did.<eos> But after normal babies get their pacifiers taken away... you forget all about Baby Corp.<eos> How come you're not normal?<eos> A few of us, the best of the best... are selected for the...<eos> For the ultimate honor.
They're stealing all our love!<eos> Just like you did to me.<eos> Exactly.<eos> And if this keeps up... there might not be enough pie left for babies.<eos> No pie?
Just like you did to me.<eos> Exactly.<eos> And if this keeps up... there might not be enough pie left for babies.<eos> No pie?<eos> No pie.
Make it a third time.<eos> Wait!<eos> I think I've seen one here.<eos> Smead manila, pressboard edges.<eos> About 50 ounces.
But I don't have a quote for this!<eos> You did it!<eos> No!<eos> We did it.<eos> And all without your training wheels.
Get down!<eos> Don't cry.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Please don't cry!<eos> 20 seconds.
Don't cry.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Please don't cry!<eos> 20 seconds.<eos> 15 seconds.
There are two types of beings in the universe... those who dance, and those who do not.<eos> Mmm-hmm. I first met my beloved at a war rally.<eos> Oh, God.<eos> Everyone in the village flailed about, dancing.<eos> Except one woman.
Idiots!<eos> Well, that's what you get when Quill flies.<eos> Ow! We still have a Sovereign craft behind us.<eos> Our weapons are down.<eos> 20 clicks to the jump!
It's not ripe.<eos> Come on, Zylak.<eos> You can do this.<eos> Yes!<eos> 15 clicks to the jump!
Yes!<eos> 15 clicks to the jump!<eos> Come on!<eos> Keep going!<eos> 10 clicks!
That was awesome!<eos> Yes!<eos> Look at this!<eos> Where is the other half of our ship?<eos> My ship.
I wanted to experience what it truly meant to be human... as I set out amongst the stars... until I found... what I sought.<eos> Life.<eos> I was not alone in the universe after all.<eos> When did you meet my mother?<eos> Not long after.
And you're not a flea?<eos> I'm a flea with a purpose.<eos> I help him sleep.<eos> What were you about to say to Drax before I walked out?<eos> Nothing.
At that time, I was a Federal Express man.<eos> What the hell you doing, boy?<eos> I could tell by how you talked about him... this Ego is bad news.<eos> We're here to save Quill.<eos> For what?
What the hell you doing, boy?<eos> I could tell by how you talked about him... this Ego is bad news.<eos> We're here to save Quill.<eos> For what?<eos> Huh? For honor?
I could tell by how you talked about him... this Ego is bad news.<eos> We're here to save Quill.<eos> For what?<eos> Huh? For honor?<eos> For love?
You are not friends.<eos> You're right.<eos> We're family.<eos> We leave no one behind.<eos> Except maybe you.
What is it?<eos> It's called a Zune.<eos> It's what everybody's listening to on Earth nowadays.<eos> It's got 300 songs on it.<eos> 300 songs?
What?<eos> I'm going to bring Okja home.<eos> Are you crazy?<eos> Seoul?<eos> In the middle of the night?
Screen these people, okay?<eos> M-U-N-D-O!<eos> Excuse me!<eos> Excuse me!<eos> What the...
We'll visit the production facility later tonight.<eos> Get all the execs there, even the ones on vacation.<eos> Put all the pigs into production.<eos> - Even the best super pig?<eos> - Every last one of them.
I mean, look, this may be a little bit touchy for me to say, but, uh, you know, black people... They have a lot more opportunities these days.<eos> Well, we did have a black president before the orange one.<eos> Yeah, but that doesn't mean there's not problems.<eos> I mean, what about the whole, like, Black Lives Matter thing?<eos> Uh, well, sure, no, good point.
I'm sorry. I've been working constantly for 30 years, okay?<eos> All right. Okay, yeah.<eos> So... Well, anyway, we just reunited a family, and we're gonna, Yeah.<eos> We're gonna leap. We're gonna leap now.<eos> Yeah, right now.
Are you taking this case?<eos> It's yours, Dave.<eos> Just here to help.<eos> Any luck with the missing body and head?<eos> Nothing.
The...<eos> You could...<eos> We could...<eos> This is the most wonderful... horrible day of my life.<eos> Of my life.
Yes, and as I've said many times before, Gordon, I can never repay you enough for that kindness.<eos> Agent Tammy Preston has the stuff, Denise. I know.<eos> I know.<eos> I'm speaking more as a woman now than as the chief of staff of the entire.<eos> Federal Bureau of Investigation.
Sometimes ahead.<eos> Sometimes behind.<eos> Sometimes to the left.<eos> Sometimes to the right.<eos> Except on cloudy days... or at night.
And as soon as this thing moved, it disappeared.<eos> Forensics?<eos> The bodies were violently mutilated, but no prints, no DNA, no fibers.<eos> Completely clean.<eos> Nothing.
Now, when you get to work, call them and set up a time and pay them their 50 grand, okay?<eos> Then we'll be free and clear.<eos> Okay, Dougie, you're acting weird as shit.<eos> Just don't forget to call them, okay?<eos> And no more drinking and gambling.
$425,000.<eos> Four hundred twenty f...<eos> And you're trying to tell us that you weren't in on this?<eos> How much did that man win, again?<eos> $425,000.
I know.<eos> If you don't help her now, it's gonna get a lot harder to help her later.<eos> We both know that tune, don't we?<eos> How much money did we get?<eos> - Aw. - $72.
And how many is that?<eos> This would be the 16th time.<eos> Sixteen hits in, what, 25 years?<eos> And where'd this one come from?<eos> Police.
Can you get him for me?<eos> I'd be happy to wait.<eos> Harry.<eos> Where the hell they got ya?<eos> Oh, no kidding.
Uh, just wanted to talk to you about a few things.<eos> Oh. Right.<eos> W... Get some rest.<eos> I'll check in later.<eos> No, nothing urgent.
Don't worry about it.<eos> Just get rest, and... and, Harry, do me a favor.<eos> Beat this thing.<eos> All right, brother.<eos> Later.
That must have been from your end?<eos> I'd like to see the prints, please.<eos> Where did you lift them from... A crime scene?<eos> No.<eos> Off the body.
We don't know.<eos> How old was this man?<eos> Late 40s.<eos> When did this man die?<eos> Within the last five or six days.
His house.<eos> By the time we checked it out, it belonged to some girl from Ipanema.<eos> Looks like the man we met in prison.<eos> The man we met in prison.<eos> Ten minutes.
Are you upset with me, Diane?<eos> What do you think?<eos> I think you're upset with me.<eos> When was the last time we saw each other, Cooper?<eos> At your house.
Joe McCluskey.<eos> What do you want?<eos> I want a car.<eos> Cheap rental, if you like.<eos> For myself and Ray Monroe.
How's that, boss?<eos> It's real good, Hutch.<eos> All right.<eos> I want you to kill a warden within the next two days.<eos> A warden?
So you can't think of any reason why someone would try to kill him.<eos> Not off the top of my head.<eos> Of course, in the insurance business, folks have been known to hold a grudge if things don't go their way.<eos> It's usually about money, Bushnell.<eos> Pure and simple.
Pure and simple.<eos> Nobody needs more reason than that.<eos> So what's his background?<eos> How long has he been with you?<eos> Twelve years now.
What are you smiling at?<eos> I know how to open that.<eos> My dad brought one home one night.<eos> You having fun with us, Bobby?<eos> Yeah, sort of.
Black.<eos> All important movies start with a black screen.<eos> And music.
Tree pose.<eos> Hey, Batman!<eos> Barbara!<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Nothing.
Sure, sure, sure.<eos> Hey, listen. Thank me later, but I just happened to be in the hood. And I figured that you could probably use the...<eos> Wait a minute.<eos> Are you having the "57th Annual Justice League Anniversary Party"<eos> - without me?
Batman's life lesson number two.<eos> Vigilantes don't have bedtimes.<eos> Yes!<eos> So, what's the vigilante policy on cookies?<eos> Unlimited!
Trying to assess whether you are bad.<eos> Ugh! Your whole thing screams "bad guy."<eos> Oh, yeah. I'm a really bad person.<eos> But with vulnerabilities.<eos> Who, me?
Ugh! Your whole thing screams "bad guy."<eos> Oh, yeah. I'm a really bad person.<eos> But with vulnerabilities.<eos> Who, me?<eos> No way.
You want us to smite him?<eos> Well, yeah, yeah, yeah.<eos> You want us to make the rivers of Gotham City run red with his blood?<eos> Oh, that's...<eos> Oh, no blood?
Batman and the Joker.<eos> What do you say?<eos> You had me at shut up.<eos> How are your abs, bro?<eos> Too much flab, not enough ab.
Only way to get rid of 'em is with your piss.<eos> Or... or the blood of a she-goat.<eos> Uh, that's hard to find around here.<eos> What?<eos> Oh, nothing.
What?<eos> Oh, nothing.<eos> It's just, uh...<eos> I'm guessing people think we're pretty much alike.<eos> - Special creatures.
Now that is so not okay, my friend.<eos> Sorry, buddy...<eos> Thanks, but I, uh...<eos> I wasn't asking for money.<eos> Uh... whatever.
- Are you okay?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> He never touched me.<eos> He just said he wanted to talk.<eos> Same thing as before.
I don't need the hassle.<eos> I could teach a couple classes.<eos> I mean, that's what I was asking when I was talking about work.<eos> I'd be cheap.<eos> No hassle at all.
And this is your home.<eos> I know.<eos> I'll be out in 72 hours.<eos> That what they tell you?<eos> 72 hours?
Look... it's for his own protection as well.<eos> The man needs help.<eos> I think Rand would be happy to set up a... neighborhood improvement donation... to be spent however you choose.<eos> Move your damn car!<eos> How about this?
I can assure that he gets the long-term help that he needs.<eos> Heather!<eos> Special delivery.<eos> What is it?<eos> From Joy Meachum.
The Meachums are trying to bribe me.<eos> They got plenty of money.<eos> You gonna sign the papers?<eos> Are you dangerous?<eos> To them?
You gonna sign the papers?<eos> Are you dangerous?<eos> To them?<eos> Very dangerous.<eos> And to me?
You see, the tiger form uses internal force, and not external strength.<eos> So it's not necessary to use charging momentum.<eos> Which lowers the risk of moving in.<eos> You're working too hard.<eos> Too much external force.
Was I wrong?<eos> To turn down $100 million?<eos> It may have been the smartest thing you did, other than coming to me.<eos> You are worth billions, Danny.<eos> Not millions.
We're doing something unusual and I can't have you screwing it up.<eos> Am I that big a problem?<eos> You've got a nice smile.<eos> Use it.<eos> Just as an experiment maybe.
Silence your inner voice.<eos> Draw strength from your center.<eos> Go slow at the beginning.<eos> Come on.<eos> What the hell?
And, frankly, this is starting to creep me out.<eos> Meet Kevin Kennedy.<eos> On life support following an auto accident for over a year.<eos> He weighed 185 and has O negative blood.<eos> In 30 minutes...
You, uh... really went above and beyond last night.<eos> Thanks.<eos> You want to tell me what's so important about this pier?<eos> It's just an acquisition we need.<eos> For the future.
All right.<eos> Place your bets!<eos> Fighters...<eos> I don't wanna have to call an ambulance, huh?<eos> - For him?
You have no idea how long I've been waiting to hear that.<eos> So, wait.<eos> How are you still alive?<eos> I was diagnosed with cancer.<eos> Uh, lung, pancreatic.
Then embrace your destiny.<eos> Well, I can't.<eos> Not if I'm stuck in the courts trying to get back in Rand.<eos> Drop all litigation against our friend here.<eos> No more roadblocks.
Ease into things.<eos> For most of these people, you are a hostile takeover.<eos> Okay.<eos> Yeah, sure.<eos> No problem.
- There are approximately two million...<eos> - Hey, what is this?<eos> Pricing strategy for a new drug we patented.<eos> This will hit market in Asia, Africa,<eos> South and Central America, even Eastern Europe.
Wasn't he stalking you?<eos> - It was a misunderstanding.<eos> - Right.<eos> I guess being a millionaire covers a multitude of sins.<eos> Billionaire.
He's head of the Yang Clan Company.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> The Yang Clan Company.<eos> It's a front.<eos> - For what?
- A snake?<eos> - It's not a snake.<eos> It's the symbol for Shou-Lao the Undying.<eos> The Undying?<eos> From K'un-Lun.
You think I'm proud of that?<eos> Come on.<eos> It is what it is.<eos> First time I fought in the cage... I convinced myself it was just about the money.<eos> For my students, for my dojo.
Do you want us to call her?<eos> My daughter.<eos> They have her.<eos> Who has her?<eos> The Hand.
- Come on.<eos> Do this tomorrow.<eos> This can't wait.<eos> Fine.<eos> No more bullshit.
If I defeat them, they'll meet my demands.<eos> You've done this before?<eos> In K'un-Lun, yeah.<eos> Not against the Hand, but in order to advance and rise through the ranks, I challenged and was challenged in return.<eos> Many times.
You can't.<eos> This is for me only.<eos> - Danny...<eos> - I've been doing this for 15 years.<eos> But not against the Hand.
I serve only myself.<eos> Prepare to disappoint your master.<eos> And who do you serve?<eos> I serve the one who called me here.<eos> Without question.
Prepare to disappoint your master.<eos> And who do you serve?<eos> I serve the one who called me here.<eos> Without question.<eos> Without doubt.
- Danny?<eos> - Hey, I'll be there, okay?<eos> You really need to take better care of yourself, Danny.<eos> This room has terrible feng shui.<eos> Too many angles.
Yeah, there's a warehouse in Brooklyn.<eos> Gao's been running a lot of our trucks through there in the past few days.<eos> It's possible this may be the manufacturing plant.<eos> - That's where she'll be keeping Radovan.<eos> - Who?
I came to warn you.<eos> The Hand knows who you are.<eos> Claire, too.<eos> I can handle myself.<eos> What about Radovan?
- I always knew.<eos> Did you really think it was that easy to steal millions of dollars from the company and not get caught?<eos> Come on, I thought I raised you smarter than that.<eos> Who do you think's been keeping your transactions hidden from the accountants?<eos> Or the SEC?
What are you talking about?<eos> What are you even doing here?<eos> Where's Dad?<eos> I think you should sit down.<eos> Oh, for Christ's sake.
What?<eos> He ran out of chia seeds?<eos> You don't wanna go in there.<eos> Why?<eos> Because of me.
I don't want you guys in any more danger.<eos> The Hand thrives on fear.<eos> I can't keep running.<eos> I have to do this.<eos> For Louisa.
The Hand thrives on fear.<eos> I can't keep running.<eos> I have to do this.<eos> For Louisa.<eos> For myself.
But the other part wants to stay for me.<eos> For what I achieved.<eos> I earned my position.<eos> I'm not gonna just walk away.<eos> Not without a fight.
I see.<eos> I know that a lot of effort went into drafting the initial agreement, so I would be willing to accept a significant... decrease... to make it worth your while.<eos> Interesting.<eos> Did you have a number in mind?<eos> Thirty million dollars.
I realize... that you will have to eat some crow... with the rest of the board.<eos> So... I would be willing to compensate you for that.<eos> How does half a million sound?<eos> I don't know what to say, Ward.<eos> How about yes?
We didn't used to be like this.<eos> One day, you just put up a wall, and I never understood why.<eos> Did I do something?<eos> I was protecting you.<eos> From what?
Wendell.<eos> Wendell Rand.<eos> This, uh...<eos> This is my son's office.<eos> Ward.
- Hey.<eos> Look, I know that secrets... secrets and lies have... they've taken a toll on our family.<eos> They've almost ruined us, but...<eos> I want a future free from all of that.<eos> For you, for me... for all of us.
This is where I came when I first returned from my grandfather's in Japan.<eos> What is this?<eos> A monastery?<eos> A school?<eos> Uh, a bit of both.
I'm guessing you can see me.<eos> Well, I'm glad you're finally getting what you deserve.<eos> Punishment is so juvenile.<eos> And quite boring, I might add.<eos> Not for me.
No, Joy, it's not like that.<eos> But it is.<eos> And you know it.<eos> You remember the promise you made?<eos> No more lies.
- You were gone, Danny.<eos> There one moment, then nothing.<eos> You failed us.<eos> And for what?<eos> For what?
For what?<eos> What do you have to show for abandoning us?<eos> I have the truth about what happened to my parents.<eos> And you want to take them all on?<eos> Without the Fist?
- with a completely different mystery man.<eos> - Davos.<eos> - You mentioned that.<eos> - He's from K'un-Lun.<eos> The monastery?
Especially when one of them has the Iron Fist.<eos> I just want to make sure we're all on the same page here.<eos> We are talking about having Bakuto arrested, right?<eos> No.<eos> No more traps.
I just want to make sure we're all on the same page here.<eos> We are talking about having Bakuto arrested, right?<eos> No.<eos> No more traps.<eos> No more interrogations.
Wait.<eos> What do you mean, "giving to the Hand"?<eos> Bakuto!<eos> After everything you have taught us... how could you betray the Hand?<eos> Nothing?
What sort of a relationship do you have with her?<eos> Davos, relax.<eos> This is Colleen Wing.<eos> You're Davos?<eos> From K'un-Lun?
I...<eos> Let's just go so we can talk, okay?<eos> - Where are we...<eos> - What's the problem, Ward?<eos> No problem.
It's nonsense, really, but it kept us in line.<eos> Nobody wanted to be captured by him.<eos> So what?<eos> You want your own personal Sack Man?<eos> Oh, not just mine.
There's so much I don't know.<eos> Here it is.<eos> Gao?<eos> They left you here?<eos> No food?
Here it is.<eos> Gao?<eos> They left you here?<eos> No food?<eos> No water?
It's no mystery why you're such a poor Iron Fist.<eos> You don't understand your own path.<eos> Your chi is so polluted with guilt, yet you refuse to face it.<eos> - And what should I be guilty of?<eos> - The death of your parents.
- Bullshit.<eos> - Joy...<eos> Information is power, right, Dad?<eos> You have been telling me that since I was a little girl, so I don't believe for a second that you didn't keep<eos> - something for yourself.
I'll go around the back.<eos> Stop right there, ma'am.<eos> Stop!<eos> Hey! You looking for me?<eos> Guns.
I'm sorry it all came down to this.<eos> Thank you for... being here.<eos> Despite everything, this is... still my father's body.<eos> And I didn't want to do this alone.<eos> Any news from Joy?
Despite everything, this is... still my father's body.<eos> And I didn't want to do this alone.<eos> Any news from Joy?<eos> No.<eos> Nothing.
Where are you from?<eos> No.<eos> Listen, I don't know shit about you, so why don't you go first?<eos> Me? There is nothing to say.<eos> No story.
Whatever, man.<eos> It's an interesting choice of words.<eos> And yet I disagree with you, bro.<eos> The war's not over.<eos> Definitely not for you.
I ain't talking about fucking Dean with you, you dirty fucking Hajji.<eos> If I were you, I would start talking, Isaac.<eos> Tell me about Dean.<eos> What's the obsession?<eos> - What the fuck?
That's what I think about your fucking wall.<eos> You're hiding in the shadow of Islam.<eos> No, I'm hiding in the shadow of fucking death.<eos> I'm in the fucking shadow of death.<eos> Nice try.
No, I'm hiding in the shadow of fucking death.<eos> I'm in the fucking shadow of death.<eos> Nice try.<eos> That's got to be a 20 mag.<eos> So all the guys...
He's 30 feet up in the trash somewhere!<eos> I don't fucking know.<eos> I'm sorry, man.<eos> Give me max plus four!<eos> Six mils right!
- Your Honor, we would like a recess.<eos> - No need.<eos> I'm done.<eos> I think he is, too.<eos> $11 million!
Detective Knight.<eos> Took long enough to get here.<eos> Got here fast as I could, Captain.<eos> Well, the room was paid for in cash.<eos> No records downstairs.
Stick.<eos> We have so much to talk about.<eos> - Are these necessary?<eos> - Standard protocol.<eos> Nothing personal.
- Standard protocol.<eos> Nothing personal.<eos> John Raymond, the body we found in your office slash apartment.<eos> Malcolm Ducasse, your friend being interrogated down the hall.<eos> And Jessica...
I'll die before I let him join your army.<eos> You think I want him to fight for me?<eos> He's a weapon.<eos> You're a monster.<eos> What else?
I know enough.<eos> And I know privilege when I see it.<eos> You may think you earned your strength, but you had power the day you were born.<eos> Before the dragons.<eos> Before the chi.
- Man, would you wake up?<eos> They're watching everything.<eos> They got eyes and ears all over.<eos> And the longer you talk to me, the worse it looks.<eos> For the both of us.
It must be the Hand.<eos> I'll get you the address from the directory.<eos> Thank you.<eos> We hit tonight.<eos> After hours.
You know, he'd been bringin' me these since he was eight years old?<eos> At first, I didn't know how he was paying for them.<eos> And then I realized he was using his lunch money.<eos> He said it was worth it... to keep the dream alive.<eos> How 'bout some cookies?
You okay?<eos> - Now, or in general?<eos> - Both.<eos> Well, I'm alive.<eos> You?
Well, I'm alive.<eos> You?<eos> Just getting back into the world.<eos> - From where?<eos> - Prison.
- What do they want?<eos> - Immortality.<eos> They want power and influence at every level across the world.<eos> And I think they want me.<eos> - For your money?
You had no choice in returning from death.<eos> I realize that.<eos> But I hope you understand that this is the life you were chosen to lead, as a weapon against our enemies.<eos> If you do not fulfill that role... you're of no use to the Hand.<eos> Or to me.
You know nothing of the power of the Hand.<eos> You are mice who fell into a well.<eos> Believe me, this will drown you.<eos> What do you want with our city?<eos> Your city?
What, have you been there before?<eos> Yeah. Um, last year, when I was investigating the Hand, the, uh, trail led me to a construction site, which is now Midland Circle.<eos> Uh, there was a hole there.<eos> Hundreds of feet deep.<eos> In the middle of New York?
You are right again.<eos> Less you know, the better.<eos> What are you gonna do, get rid of the body?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Something like that.
I used to have a partner.<eos> We had an office.<eos> And?<eos> Now we don't.<eos> You ready?
And you think his target was Midland Circle?<eos> Maybe.<eos> Actually, I think this is it.<eos> - You think?<eos> - Ninety-nine percent.
Maybe.<eos> Actually, I think this is it.<eos> - You think?<eos> - Ninety-nine percent.<eos> Ninety-two percent.
- Wasn't the mob.<eos> - Sorry.<eos> Who are you?<eos> - He's a lawyer.<eos> - A what?
I think.<eos> He said something about crane pose and centering his animal.<eos> Then I tuned him out.<eos> Anima.<eos> - What?
- No.<eos> Whatever this is, it's at the bottom of the hole.<eos> There's something under Midland Circle.<eos> - How you feeling?<eos> - Never better.
You took my case, I took yours.<eos> I just think we'll work better together if we trust each other. Don't you?<eos> That is the nicest thing you've ever said to me.<eos> Yeah, don't get used to it.<eos> So much smoke.
That is the nicest thing you've ever said to me.<eos> Yeah, don't get used to it.<eos> So much smoke.<eos> What is this stuff?<eos> Eh, little of this, little of that.
Some place called Midland Circle.<eos> 44th and 11th Avenue.<eos> - Midland Circle.<eos> - That was the epicenter.<eos> Of what?
Perhaps you have found your family.<eos> Ten stories left.<eos> Give or take.<eos> Anyone waiting for us?<eos> Yeah, about 30 of 'em.
It's not.<eos> It's the job.<eos> Danny... uh, wanted to say that he has connections... at this hospital, and it's a...<eos> It's a state-of-the-art kind of place, so...<eos> "Connections"?
Hmm. What is this?<eos> What are you doing there?<eos> - This? Oh, this just - Yeah.<eos> improves the chances of conception.<eos> Of what?
Where is it?<eos> There's no eggs here.<eos> - Where are your eggs?<eos> - Dee, where are your eggs?<eos> Dee, eggs!
Sir, why don't we just give it back?<eos> He killed my nephew.<eos> My brother.<eos> And a dozen of my men.<eos> Over his car.
This is what you agreed to, Jonathan.<eos> Do what the man asks.<eos> Be free.<eos> Then, if you want to go after him, burn his house down, be my guest.<eos> But until then...
You're thinking about it, aren't you?<eos> You're counting exits... guards...<eos> Could you get to me in time?<eos> How would you do it, I wonder?<eos> That woman's pen?
There was a time not so long ago in which I considered us as friends.<eos> I still do.<eos> Yet here you are.<eos> What brought you back, John?<eos> A marker.
Loose ends?<eos> Yeah...<eos> You're not having a good night, are you, John?<eos> Gentlemen!<eos> Gentlemen!
I think you are addicted to it.<eos> To the vengeance.<eos> Welcome to Reflections of the Soul at the New Modern NYC.<eos> No wife.<eos> No life.
Shush, shush, shush, shush, - they're about to open!<eos> - Why do we have to shush?<eos> Oh, guys!<eos> I almost forgot. Do not go near the pool drains, no matter how good you might think they feel on your butt.<eos> - What?
One of these little stinkers yours?<eos> My son.<eos> This one here?<eos> Mm-hmm. - Oh, yeah, he's adorable.<eos> You?
Can I please have $20?<eos> Well, I think you can get something to eat for a lot less than that, hon.<eos> Dad! I'm hungry, I'm starving, and you haven't given me any money.<eos> Yeah.<eos> What the hell?
- All right, let's go, let's go. - Okay.<eos> - All right, all right. - Okay. Here we go.<eos> This should be good, right? Oh, that's great.<eos> - That'll do it.<eos> - Oh!
There you go. She's abusing my mom, man.<eos> It's clear as day, but what's really interesting is what seems to be happening right here in the live feed.<eos> Oh. You want to sleep.<eos> Well, I'll sleep you.<eos> - Uh... what the hell, man?
- Yeah... - We're just watching our moms to figure out what the situation is.<eos> Wh... I mean, it could be a show, but, I mean, you're right.<eos> It's-it's not a show.<eos> Yeah, well it certainly looks like you're trying to make a show, and I think it's a good idea, and I think you should put me in.<eos> - Why?
Hey, come help me out, I'm stuck.<eos> Not now, Deandra.<eos> Oh, by the way, none of the stuff you're doing is playing.<eos> Except for the fart stuff.<eos> What fart stuff?
Skinny, big tits!<eos> New evidence is suggesting that all this science inside one crow's egg can scientifically make your breasts larger.<eos> Watch the enzymes enlargify your breasts.<eos> Want to hear more about it? The sci...<eos> Aah!
It's not for women!<eos> It was never made for women!<eos> But it'd be great if women also drank it.<eos> The dream was to create a muscle-up energy drink - Yeah. - that gave you the power to fight like a crow!<eos> - Yes! - Men!
It was never made for women!<eos> But it'd be great if women also drank it.<eos> The dream was to create a muscle-up energy drink - Yeah. - that gave you the power to fight like a crow!<eos> - Yes! - Men!<eos> Or women.
You see, Dee and I had a deal. I give her money for coffee every morning on the way to work.<eos> And she's instructed to give a very generous tip to the cashier, Cassie.<eos> "This is from my boss, Dennis."<eos> Now, this establishes both generosity and authority.<eos> Possibly a little dominance.
- Uh... - That goes to Frank.<eos> I know it's steep, but you did go through three arbiters, and you've been here 17 hours.<eos> - Yeah. I'm exhausted. - Yikes, yikes.<eos> What's-what's it add up to there, Frank?<eos> $9,986.
- Yeah.<eos> - But we got to fight fire with fire, and Charlie and I refuse to be defeated by this.<eos> We're gonna win this war.<eos> What war?<eos> - The war on women!
- But we got to fight fire with fire, and Charlie and I refuse to be defeated by this.<eos> We're gonna win this war.<eos> What war?<eos> - The war on women!<eos> - Women, man!
- Smell good? Everything poppin'? - All right.<eos> - Look good? - I don't know. What do you think?<eos> - You like how it smells? - It looks good.<eos> - And you can't see any of the blood.<eos> - Okay, good.
- Wow, Dee, that was dark.<eos> - That's like the darkest thing you've ever done.<eos> You know what that was? - That was your rock bottom. - Yeah.<eos> - Yeah. - Hmm.<eos> - Whatever.
- Everything is "Jerry" out of you mouth.<eos> - Hey, hey, hey, uh, Ch-Charlie, I need a new keg.<eos> - This one's tapped, buddy. - Yeah, give me a second.<eos> Like, if Jerry jumped off a bridge would you jump off it, too?<eos> - Guys, guys... - Which bridge, really?
- He wants us to "mop up the yuck puddle."<eos> - Oh! Of emotions.<eos> Of what?<eos> - It's a metaphor.<eos> - For what?
I don't know why you're so excited about this goddamn thing.<eos> There's never anything insi...<eos> What is this? It's a gift.<eos> I got it for you.<eos> For me?
No punishments.<eos> No rules.<eos> No punishments.<eos> And..<eos> no more secrets.
no more secrets.<eos> I can do that..<eos> You want a...<eos> What do you call it?<eos> A vanilla relationship?
This is spiky.<eos> I like it.<eos> I'll call you tomorrow.<eos> Okay.<eos> Good night.
Kiss me.<eos> What do you want Anastasia?<eos> I want.. all of you.<eos> Why do you think you waited?<eos> - For sex.
Everything okay?<eos> And now thankfully I'll be handing off my speaking duties to our master of ceremonies Mr. Newman Paul.<eos> Hungry?<eos> Now you know what those silver balls do.<eos> - 15 thousand dollars.
And now thankfully I'll be handing off my speaking duties to our master of ceremonies Mr. Newman Paul.<eos> Hungry?<eos> Now you know what those silver balls do.<eos> - 15 thousand dollars.<eos> - 15 thousand dollars..
- 15 thousand dollars..<eos> Going once, going twice...<eos> That's a great start, Ladies and Gentlemen. Now lot number 2, a weeks vacation.. At a luxury Chalet.<eos> Let's start the bid off at ten thousand dollars.<eos> - Ten thousand.
That's a great start, Ladies and Gentlemen. Now lot number 2, a weeks vacation.. At a luxury Chalet.<eos> Let's start the bid off at ten thousand dollars.<eos> - Ten thousand.<eos> - Thank you ma'am.<eos> Ten thousand dollars.
- Thank you ma'am.<eos> Ten thousand dollars.<eos> I didn't know you had a place in Aspen.<eos> I have a lot of places.<eos> Seventeen Thousand.
I have a lot of places.<eos> Seventeen Thousand.<eos> Seventeen thousand dollars, thank you, sir.<eos> Eighteen?<eos> - Eighteen thousand,
That was, you know, when somebody talks, and the other person listens and you resolve an issue.<eos> - That's how it works.<eos> - It's crazy. Isn't it?<eos> - Good night Anna.<eos> - Good night Hanna.
He talks about you all the time.<eos> He cares about you.<eos> Don't lie.<eos> Tell me what you have that I don't.<eos> Nothing.
- Yeah. She scared me.<eos> But you scare me more.<eos> Seeing you like that with her.<eos> I will never be able to give you that.<eos> Kind of submission and obedience.
Ah, it's a long story.<eos> What's going on?<eos> What do I give Christian for his birthday?<eos> The boy already has everything except the sense of humor.<eos> Er.. his.
Late this afternoon, the helicopter was an Airbus helicopter H130. Is there anything we can do?<eos> And Christian only 27 years old had extensive flying experience.<eos> Alright bye.<eos> One of Seattle's youngest billionaire has grazed the charismatic head of Grey enterprise holdings.<eos> a multi-national conglomerate..
Come with me.<eos> There is something I need to show you.<eos> Last time we came down here. I was over your shoulder.<eos> Oh yeah.<eos> After you.
- Yeah.<eos> Could explain why she's reluctant to talk about it.<eos> Does anyone else have keys?<eos> Erm... Annie, a neighbour two doors down.<eos> Er... also Cath, my mate.
I think I walked.<eos> From where you woke up, at the party?<eos> But you don't know where that was exactly?<eos> It was by the water.<eos> What sort of water?
Wait.<eos> Do you hear that?<eos> I'll take a look down there.<eos> - Anything?<eos> - No.
I don't know.<eos> We didn't keep tabs on final numbers, we were just telling people to pitch up if they fancied it.<eos> Roughly?<eos> 70, 80...<eos> How many men?
We didn't keep tabs on final numbers, we were just telling people to pitch up if they fancied it.<eos> Roughly?<eos> 70, 80...<eos> How many men?<eos> Erm... fiftyish.
Very British.<eos> Do you mean, British in demeanor or... - No.<eos> Like she's...<eos> - She's from England.<eos> From England.
Thank you.<eos> Now can I say something I wanna say?<eos> Sure.<eos> Before they ruined it, Justin's zoo was the best art project.<eos> By far.
An Apple?<eos> It's a MacBook, darling.<eos> Top of the line with the Retina Display.<eos> Hey, you know who else has a Retina Display?<eos> Fred!
Things I know you'll find really challenging. Yes.<eos> But sadly, it's a school night and there's homework to do.<eos> What a surprise though, right?<eos> Say good night to Grandmother or Evelyn.<eos> Good night.
Just out of curiosity, Fenway, that's a tough ticket.<eos> Where do you get yours?<eos> My husband has season tickets.<eos> And how long has he had them?<eos> 30 years.
Mutually approved.<eos> Just hear me out.<eos> Tampa.<eos> I insisted, and they agreed.<eos> No more than a half an hour from your front door.
So you are here to let me go?<eos> I tried, but it's not up to me.<eos> I even asked them to send me with you..<eos> Or anyone.<eos> In Amazon..
No you wouldn't.<eos> Why not?<eos> They came to the conclusion that man are essential for procreation but when it comes to pleasure Unnecessary.<eos> No.<eos> Goodnight.

I know what you can and will succeed...<eos> It is what you're put on this earth to do.<eos> Something, it come to me last night.<eos> A different type of gas.<eos> For you.
I also speak Chinese, trickster.<eos> Can you recite Socrates in ancient Greek?<eos> Oh, you're done.<eos> Where is Charlie?<eos> Voila!
- Me?<eos> - You hungry?<eos> Yes.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Eight pence please, sir.
I found it!<eos> Did you find Ludendorff's operation?<eos> No. No, but I located him.<eos> And oh, lucky you, he's only a few miles away At German High Command.<eos> The German High Command?
Do you have dancing on Paradise Island?<eos> Oh, dancing, yeah of course.<eos> These people are just... swaying.<eos> Okay, if you're gonna be fighting the God of war I might as well teach you how to dance, you poor thing.<eos> Alright, probably without the gun.
You know nothing of the gods.<eos> Herr General.<eos> Enjoy the fireworks.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> - Out of my way!
Ideas, inspiration for formulas weapons but I don't make them use them.<eos> They start these wars on their own.<eos> All I do is orchestrate an armistice I know they cannot keep in the hope they will destroy themselves.<eos> But it has never been enough.<eos> Until you.
Look at this world.<eos> Mankind did this, not me.<eos> They are ugly filled with hatred weak Just like your captain Trevor.<eos> Gone and left you nothing. And for what?<eos> Pathetic!
We'll just make it normal for him.<eos> Jake, I think you just need some time to focus on you.<eos> Because if we keep living like this I think we'll just keep hurting each other and, you know, we'll get to a point where I don't know if we can fix it.<eos> So we're gonna do this for Samuel.<eos> And for us.

All in the hands of cannibals.<eos> Crunching. Little bones.<eos> Crunching.<eos> On a more positive note... tonight's Blood Aurora display could be a beauty.<eos> Until for one brief whisper.
Ingrid!<eos> What the hell are you doing...?<eos> Someone's... there's been a terrible accident!<eos> The blade threw him in the air.<eos> Which side of the road?
It's been bent out of shape.<eos> And no identification on the victim?<eos> We have no idea who the dead man is.<eos> No.<eos> None.
So, your intel was spot-on.<eos> That Damocles 7 EMP weapon that went missing in the Gulf? Arms dealers from the Liberation Front have it in Berlin.<eos> Shit!<eos> This thing can wipe out an entire electrical grid in a major city.<eos> No lights, no power.
Oh, I already got one.<eos> Hey, Dom.<eos> Hey, Hobbs.<eos> I got a job in Berlin and I need a favor, brother.<eos> No problem.
Family.<eos> No, it's not.<eos> Not if you're being honest<eos> It's the 10 seconds between start and finish, when you're not thinking about anything.<eos> No family, no obligations.
You want to see the old Dom?<eos> Watch.<eos> Bitch.<eos> Don't, don't.<eos> Sweet dreams.
Dom's gotta be either working with them or making a trade, because no one would be this insane to hit this place without a damn army.<eos> I wouldn't be so sure about that.<eos> Speak of the devil.<eos> All right, Dom, you're one step closer to that family reunion.<eos> 400 meters to base.
There's a sea lock at the opening of the bay.<eos> We get there firs! And close it, we can stop the submarine from escaping into open water and disappearing forever.<eos> I've got the location.<eos> It's 10 miles southwest.<eos> Ten miles?
They should have invited you.<eos> To the wake, at least.<eos> Serving stew in the backroom, to hell with that.<eos> In all of this dirty city, there is no-one that I can trust, do you understand?<eos> Apart from you.
You're a Delaney.<eos> Tell you what... You get me an address, and I will get you payment in the form of a banker's draft.<eos> - How much?<eos> - Enough.<eos> Good day.
he leaves me no choice.<eos> - I'm going out.<eos> - Good.<eos> I'm tired of these empty threats you keep bandying around.<eos> Empty?
The balance of your father's mind was, well, unstable... but you have no such excuse.<eos> Now, why don't you just open the fucking envelope?<eos> Mmm?<eos> Hmm...<eos> Good day.
You have four hours.<eos> Brace?<eos> I'm going out.<eos> I need to see someone.<eos> From Mr Delaney.
Come on, shift it!<eos> Everyone else, you heard the man, off the streets!<eos> Quickly!<eos> Yes?<eos> From Mr Delaney.
Damn thing!<eos> Beg your pardon.<eos> So what's this for?<eos> To keep things safe.<eos> What things?
Give me back my horse.<eos> What's the biggest thing you saw?<eos> For my files - my book about the world.<eos> What's the biggest thing you saw in Africa?<eos> An elephant.
Human kindness.<eos> An ant.<eos> Was he a company man?<eos> I'd say he wasn't East India.<eos> More from up Leadenhall.
You're mad to have even come here.<eos> We are an angry nation.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I'm counting on it.<eos> Good day.
There he is!<eos> Shame on you!<eos> Let the man through!<eos> Where's the money, Delaney? !<eos> Gentleman!
He's already haunted.<eos> Come.<eos> Be sure of this, Delaney!<eos> That legacy is your death sentence!<eos> Out of my way!
"and yet, we would have each other and be together."<eos> That kind of thing.<eos> Do you possess any other documents of his?<eos> I have letters.<eos> Other than letters?
Don't leave me!<eos> No, please!<eos> You will answer to God for this.<eos> Probably. And for the many other evil tasks I have carried out for the King of England.<eos> And the Prince Regent.
They stopped laughing out there.<eos> That's good.<eos> That's a good thing, Godders.<eos> James.<eos> For God's sake.
We should bill the King.<eos> - She's back, yes?<eos> - Aye.<eos> How does she seem?<eos> The same.
Now, shut for the evening.<eos> You're busy tonight.<eos> Right, a request to hire men and boats to collect barrels from the Prospect of Whitby pub and ferry them up the Fleet River to Hampstead.<eos> Barrels will contain... whores' urine.<eos> And that of the customers.
You can have her as part of the deal.<eos> Part of our second offering.<eos> So why don't you just take her?<eos> Just take her with you.<eos> No more hiding.
I know I will have my satisfaction.<eos> I declare it!<eos> I challenge James Delaney to a duel.<eos> At dawn... to the death.<eos> To the death.
No lack of faith in either party, but I need payment in advance.<eos> On my instruction, the duellists will take up position at the points.<eos> Anyone firing à I'outrance will be fair game to be shot.<eos> You will duel to first blood...<eos> To the death!
On my instruction, the duellists will take up position at the points.<eos> Anyone firing à I'outrance will be fair game to be shot.<eos> You will duel to first blood...<eos> To the death!<eos> To first blood.
I can only assume that your second is a Company man.<eos> Since he failed to load a ball in your pistol.<eos> Dear God!<eos> It would appear that my life is more precious than yours.<eos> Good day.
Running by the window.<eos> Out there on the foreshore.<eos> Stopping the river traffic and searching every barge going east.<eos> You see, Miss Bow, last night there was a robbery.<eos> From the East India Arsenal.
Every year, July 10th.<eos> July 20th is the anniversary of the sinking... Of the sinking of the sloop The Influence.<eos> Not the ship's real name, of course.<eos> Its name was changed and papers altered when it took on human cargo in the port of Cabinda.<eos> 280 souls.

It is my belief that some very powerful men in London were involved in an illicit shipment of slaves for personal profit, were complicit in the deaths of those slaves and in the subsequent concealment of the facts.<eos> And you believe that those men are senior directors within the Honourable East India Company?<eos> Yes, I do.<eos> Well then, Mr. Chichester, I have some good news for you.<eos> From the Prince Regent himself.
A commission is not the King, so they can't subpoena, so you will deal with it and treat them with disbelief.<eos> They have appointed some educated blackamoor to prepare the evidence.<eos> Now, you take your coat off, go into your office and you write to him.<eos> Offer him "full and unfettered co-operation"<eos> on behalf of the Honourable East India.
Help yourself to breakfast.<eos> It's been two days.<eos> Why are you not looking for him?<eos> We had words.<eos> What words?
The chlorate is still there, it's just sleeping.<eos> "For the purpose of preventing contagion."?<eos> I saw you... and you saw something at the pond.<eos> What did you see?<eos> Nothing.
I strongly suggest you to continue to see nothing.<eos> Move!<eos> What's this?<eos> Cholera.<eos> Cholera?
Possibility one... reason.<eos> Possibility two... Witchcraft.<eos> Leave this body where it will be found.<eos> You can keep the heart.<eos> Goodnight.
I need... a ship.<eos> Maybe have a fuck first.<eos> Find a ship tomorrow.<eos> Why don't you find a captain and you take him upstairs and slit his throat, and I will take his ship?<eos> No captains.
Please...<eos> For your widowhood.<eos> Now...<eos> I have work to do, so please excuse me.<eos> - No fires within these walls.
I put an end to his pain.<eos> You did him... a kindness.<eos> I killed him!<eos> You came back too late!<eos> For both of us.
And you're a British citizen?<eos> German by birth, British by marriage.<eos> And you?<eos> I'm from Dulwich, sir.<eos> Dulwich?
We have Delaney, we have Nootka, we have the China trade.<eos> We have opium, tea and powder.<eos> He'll be cut to pieces.<eos> A piece each, gentlemen.<eos> Gentlemen.
The King gets the land.<eos> You get the tea trade.<eos> You got lucky with a whore, Stuart.<eos> Well, there was an element of fortune.<eos> And an element of God's grace.
When she was sick.<eos> Sick?<eos> For the purpose of restraint?<eos> No.<eos> For her own protection.
I received a letter from Delaney this morning.<eos> I suppose you would call it a pincer movement.<eos> He says he's happy for the Nootka trading post, the smoke house and the tanning factory to be incorporated into the territory of the British Crown, but only if we give him a monopoly on the trade in smoked sea otter pelts from...<eos> Vancouver coast to Canton.<eos> Canton?
And the fucks are at it again!<eos> Fuck you who betray the people you were elected to help!<eos> We're sheep to these monsters, and they don't give a shit!<eos> We grow our wool, and just when we're getting warm, they come along with their electric clippers and shear our wool off, and we're just naked, screaming little fucks!<eos> No wool for us!
There's fire where you are going.<eos> Hawk, There's fire where you are going.<eos> Okay, margaret.<eos> Good night, hawk.<eos> Good night.
We're supposed to get some coffee, But I don't think that's a good idea.<eos> Coffee?<eos> I would like some coffee.<eos> Maybe some warm milk.<eos> For the cat.
I think you're right, dougie.<eos> And this is interesting.<eos> The mitchums just called me, Wanting to have a personal sit-down with you.<eos> Now, normally, I wouldn't put one of my agents Into the ring with guys like this,<eos> This 30-million-dollar check.
Here's to the pie that saved your life, dougie.<eos> And our money.<eos> Candie.<eos> Candie.<eos> Another piece of pie for our friend.
Find the car key.<eos> Get the car key.<eos> Get the car...<eos> Get the goddamn car key!<eos> What?
Yeah.<eos> I'll let you know if, uh... if I hear from him.<eos> I'll let you know if we have more news.<eos> Thanks, Frank.<eos> For Harry.
Uh, where do you want it set up?<eos> W-what?<eos> Sonny Jim's new gym set, courtesy of the Mitchum brothers.<eos> And the car, too?<eos> Mitchum brothers.
Tell him how it works, Muddy.<eos> Real simple.<eos> This man is our boss... 'cause no one can beat him at arm wrestling.<eos> Imagine all the men who've tried.<eos> Many, many.
He was dressed as a guard, but I'd never seen him before.<eos> Put it on... ring finger, left hand.<eos> Now... you know what I want, Ray.<eos> You want the coordinates I got from Hastings?<eos> Rather, his pretty secretary, Betty?
Maybe you're one of them bull dykes.<eos> Yeah. Come to think of it, you look kind of like a bull dyke lesbo.<eos> You like to eat cunt, huh?<eos> I'll eat you.<eos> What?
Just don't go in that nut place.<eos> Fuck you. Who said I would anyway?<eos> Nice sweater.<eos> Where'd you lift that?<eos> It'sPaula's.
But, seriously though, after all this group has been through I don't think marriage is going to be that hard.<eos> That's because you haven't had kids yet.<eos> This is our first time out in months.<eos> Exactly, which is why you and I should go back to our room.<eos> Goodnight.
- Wow.<eos> Babe, we should go too.<eos> Guys, yeah.<eos> Call it a night too.<eos> Goodnight.
You remember how we got out of there?<eos> You know, Pam didn't drink for a year after that.<eos> - Forget I brought it up.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Cheers.
You know, Pam didn't drink for a year after that.<eos> - Forget I brought it up.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Cheers.<eos> - Cheers.
Charlotte Drake, I will be calling you.<eos> And I'm not going to wait three days.<eos> I'll ring you tomorrow.<eos> Enchante, mademoiselle.<eos> Au revoir.
I saw him.<eos> So I do not see a problem.<eos> Ready to rescue the princess from the tower.<eos> From the west came the dense layers of the object.<eos> Now just to the north of Finland.
Look there.<eos> You understand, the devil knows what this piece of iron.<eos> And here's good news.<eos> With you will go to the deputy parliamentary group.<eos> - What? !
End communication.<eos> (On the radio)<eos> - I conduct surveillance.<eos> (Sniper) On the position.<eos> We empty.
Dad?<eos> And what will happen to us now?<eos> In the city curfew.<eos> After 9 years of age, one does not go anywhere.<eos> After high school, once back home.
Come on, bunt ago.<eos> - Yes Wait, wait.<eos> Right now, there still will be.<eos> Nits.<eos> As the house at home.
- Yes, what are you doing, I - the grave.<eos> - Tomb no Wi fi and 4G.<eos> Chick, cigarette butts.<eos> (I screamed in terror)<eos> No heat, no radiation, no heat.
Fewer questions will be.<eos> You do not know what to say?<eos> I do not know - smile.<eos> It helps real.<eos> Something like that.
We do not care right now for perimeter does not get there.<eos> Tell me the name of his father's military.<eos> Normal person are you?<eos> One week all in Moscow, has a corruption scheme Mutish?<eos> Before the night without options.
Better?<eos> - Che drive?<eos> - In place of the stand.<eos> - From another galaxy?<eos> - From this.
Here, many of its lost!<eos> I have a brother, cousin.<eos> Son of a hospital.<eos> Thank threshold.<eos> From a nine.
..<eos> First-twelfth.<eos> First-twelfth.<eos> We've got people.<eos> Many people.
You've done Che, Yul?<eos> I'm done?<eos> Maybe you've done?<eos> Minutes of the protective space defense.<eos> Missile Defense.
- Order which it was?<eos> - Ready-to-use.<eos> - So get ready.<eos> - There is.<eos> - Neither of the application.
Small ship study.<eos> With me you can talk.<eos> She is...<eos> She will live?<eos> Not for long. 70 or 80 Earth years.
This war's been running eight years now.<eos> President Obama, as you know, is drawing down troops in Iraq to refocus our attention on Afghanistan.<eos> Henry Whelan was a good man, he meant well, but he just wasn't getting the job done.<eos> Now, given your reputation and your formidable drive, our hope is that you're the man who will get the job done.<eos> First things first.
But it's a war that cannot be won by the virtues of our unassailable military might and power alone.<eos> This war will be won primarily with the unassailable might and power of our ideals.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah.<eos> - Forty thousand?
- Forty thousand?<eos> - I'm afraid so.<eos> God damn it.<eos> What did we tell you?<eos> No more troops.
Yes, sir, I agree.<eos> It's very important.<eos> - Yes, it is.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - A what?
Wrong.<eos> This dinner is for Afghanistan.<eos> We are here tonight because we're at war in Afghanistan.<eos> And you got the goddamn gall to kick the only Afghan in the room<eos> - off my goddamn table?
Shoot!<eos> I know this is Marjah, but I'm still not quite clear as to why you're sending boys to Nawzad and Musa Qala.<eos> I mean, there's nothing out there.<eos> I'm just not quite clear what it is you're trying to control there.<eos> Apart from nothing.
Sorry to wake you.<eos> We have a problem.<eos> That Rolling Stone article came out, and it's not good.<eos> Sir, it says we're shit-talking our president.<eos> And our vice president.
We had a conversation.<eos> - Give me his phone number.<eos> - What?<eos> Whose phone number?<eos> This fucking Cullen fuck.
Whose phone number?<eos> This fucking Cullen fuck.<eos> Give me his fucking phone number!<eos> - I'm not gonna give you his phone number.<eos> - Why the fuck not?
'Let the children of Israel go out of your land.'"<eos> Sorry to interrupt.<eos> Kelsey, gotta ask, is this the worst disadvantage so far?<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> No question.
Or are you gonna buy something incredible for yourself?<eos> - I think...<eos> - Wait, wait, don't answer yet.<eos> We'll find out when we come back.<eos> Right after this.
Or you could buy a luxury item for yourself.<eos> With 46 advantages, you could get... ooh, mattress and pillows...<eos> Mm. A steak dinner with all the fixings.<eos> TV for a week or a warm, soapy shower.<eos> So, Danika.
Good-bye, Tim.<eos> Good luck with the show.<eos> Morning.<eos> - What?<eos> - No, nothing.
- They're free.<eos> - What time?<eos> - And they're her seats, so they're probably really good.<eos> - Whose seats?<eos> - Madonna's.
I did not... I wasn't... that wasn't... that was n...<eos> I did not... You... you... you w... you heard me. I was just asking...<eos> That's our show.<eos> Remember to follow us live online 24 hours a day, and be back here tomorrow night... - Six. - when we'll be one step closer to finding out<eos> - Jessica. Good night!
You hear me?<eos> I said, "Hey."<eos> I heard you.<eos> Yeah, where are we on my fucking window?<eos> Uh, nowhere.
Here's the thing.<eos> It seems like we have a chance to get out of here at a reasonable hour tonight, for once.<eos> I say, we grab it.<eos> Just because you two have some kind of plans.<eos> Not just us.
What do you do?<eos> Oh, just bookkeeping, so... most definitely an "under," too.<eos> When I grow up, I'm gonna run a massive label.<eos> Do you have plans?<eos> No.
I'll see you in there.<eos> Here, come meet my best friend.<eos> Hey, Bill.<eos> How you been?<eos> - Madeline!
You know, I work at the theatre, and whenever we go into production, we hire freelance accountants, so I'll ask them if they have anything for you.<eos> You're... so nice. Thank you.<eos> This is Monterey.<eos> We pound people with nice.<eos> To death.
Career-wise.<eos> Okay, well, let's just finish that analogy.<eos> Let's not leave Bonnie out of this.<eos> Her little cup just runneth over with happiness, doesn't it?<eos> With no college degree at all.
- Good morning, Maddie.<eos> - Hi, Tom. - How are you?<eos> - Everyone's making me angry.<eos> - I'm sorry to hear that.<eos> - Except for you.
- Everyone's making me angry.<eos> - I'm sorry to hear that.<eos> - Except for you.<eos> - And me.<eos> - And you guys.
- Hey. - Hey, Ed.<eos> - What's up?<eos> Love the look, especially the mirror.<eos> It's... you got to respect a man who has his own back.<eos> Well, standard stuff.
So much so, I find myself fantasizing that somebody will come along one day and say or do something to me that'll offer me the chance to redeem myself.<eos> You've always treated me quite well, Nathan.<eos> It's too bad.<eos> Too bad.<eos> What?
Great.<eos> Let's do it.<eos> We need to break into the faculty storage room.<eos> To save the whole town from Ghost Riders?<eos> No problem.
Of course.<eos> Scott, open the door, you're a werewolf.<eos> I'm trying.<eos> What the hell is wrong with this place?<eos> Lenore?
What makes you think this is gonna work?<eos> You took Josh's power.<eos> You can do it.<eos> Here we go.<eos> Hey, what the hell?
It was here when we moved in.<eos> That was 18 years ago.<eos> Lydia?<eos> What is it?<eos> Nothing.
Like I said, there's nothin' here.<eos> You're not even looking.<eos> You can't just poke around and expect to find a supernatural train station.<eos> Do you hear that?<eos> - Nothing.
Hauptmann?<eos> It's them?<eos> Yeah.<eos> And judging by the sound, we don't have a lot of time.<eos> For what?
- Probably not.<eos> - Definitely not.<eos> You guys aren't hoping I'm gonna be the optimist, are you?<eos> So, how cold does this thing get?<eos> Cold enough for a Hellhound.
It's working.<eos> This looks fresh.<eos> It's from Stiles' Jeep.<eos> It must have just left.<eos> Without his keys?
Attention, all passengers.<eos> The train will be arriving in 19 minutes.<eos> Okay, we're running out of time.<eos> - Mason. You always know where he is.<eos> - Yeah, except for right now.
There are hundreds of waiting rooms in this train station which apparently now also serves as a high school library.<eos> - It's impossible.<eos> - We can try.<eos> Where do you get this implausible optimism?<eos> Definitely not from my father.
Ugh. Your toto looks hungry.<eos> My toto?<eos> "Toto" is "dog" in our language.<eos> Medicine..<eos> For my head.
Sorry to keep you waiting.<eos> You should have sent someone ahead.<eos> I did.<eos> Well, you should have sent someone else.<eos> So many soldiers here...
There's rumors of magic.<eos> If it were magic, it wouldn't be yours, would it?<eos> The rip in the sky?<eos> No.<eos> No magic here.
Sir, this was magic... strong enough to kill a cardinal witch.<eos> Glinda ..<eos> No.<eos> But there is only one man to blame.<eos> 20 years ago...
My world.<eos> Hi, sir, my friend is dying, and I need some medicine.<eos> Do you know where I can find any?<eos> Medicine, uh... doctor, pharmacy.<eos> For him.
Who you keep locked up.<eos> Why do you think I live in a town with no name?<eos> A place on no map?<eos> It's to protect him.<eos> From what?
Why do you think I live in a town with no name?<eos> A place on no map?<eos> It's to protect him.<eos> From what?<eos> From everything.
Numbers and patterns and theorems... they're beautiful.<eos> As beautiful as magic.<eos> Would you like to join me for the funeral?<eos> I hear it's quite a show.<eos> Out of my way.
Would you like to join me for the funeral?<eos> I hear it's quite a show.<eos> Out of my way.<eos> Get off of me!<eos> Out of my way.
Why does he want me dead?<eos> Because the Wizard wants you dead.<eos> - How did they get up there?<eos> - I'm told they climbed.<eos> 200 feet?
Because the Wizard wants you dead.<eos> - How did they get up there?<eos> - I'm told they climbed.<eos> 200 feet?<eos> Without ropes?
They're possessed by magic.<eos> What're they doing now?<eos> Speak!<eos> It's a ritual.<eos> For what?
What're they doing now?<eos> Speak!<eos> It's a ritual.<eos> For what?<eos> Suicide.
Fire.<eos> How long did it take to come?<eos> When the two moons became one.<eos> - Well, that's in...<eos> - Eight days.
I'll go myself.<eos> Well, I should at least be by your side.<eos> You still need counsel.<eos> Yes...<eos> Just not yours.
We only want to help you.<eos> You're alone in this world, yes?<eos> Afraid.<eos> Without options.<eos> Without purpose.
Dorothy.<eos> Dorothy!<eos> - Seen a girl?<eos> - None by here, no.<eos> Anything amiss at all?
Tip?<eos> How?<eos> Is that really you?<eos> I don't know who I am because of you.<eos> Because of me?
Our mistress will be so pleased with me.<eos> She won't mind the mess one bit.<eos> Where's your mistress?<eos> How long have you had her?<eos> Less than a day.
The ones our sister died with.<eos> If secrets were kept, they were kept from me, too.<eos> And what of your own?<eos> I harbor no secrets.<eos> Especially from you.
That's where I stabbed you before you went down.<eos> I've done some bad things and now I have to answer for them.<eos> I don't want to hurt you too.<eos> I need you to promise me:<eos> No magic.
I've done some bad things and now I have to answer for them.<eos> I don't want to hurt you too.<eos> I need you to promise me:<eos> No magic.<eos> No magic.
Because you are more valuable as my ally.<eos> Perhaps the same is true for Dorothy.<eos> The Mother Witch lives!<eos> And is breeding witches.<eos> For Glinda!
Why mix?<eos> The vegetables?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I guess it's what makes a good stew.<eos> The more the merrier.
She loves me just as much, and I love her.<eos> Do you have a mother?<eos> You'll find her someday.<eos> But until then, you're not alone.<eos> Sweet dreams.
Stay, Toto.<eos> We've come to see the Witch of the North...<eos> Sent by Elizabeth of the Wizard's High Council.<eos> Glinda knows me.<eos> Not this one.
Please... my sister...<eos> Do you feel her inside you?<eos> What does she command?<eos> A message.<eos> For you.
Soldier, move away from the gold.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> The destruction is coming.<eos> Currency to protect my family.<eos> Yours too.
You will never have your revenge.<eos> I finally have what I care about most.<eos> Emerald city, the throne, that's what you want.<eos> That's why I gave you my sister's powers!<eos> Not for your own petty indulgences.
Her words were false.<eos> I want nahara free too.<eos> And I have the power to do it.<eos> What do you want from her?<eos> The stone giants.
To stop glinda permanently.<eos> It took magic to raise them, and the wizard doesn't have any.<eos> But nahara does, doesn't she?<eos> I want her to raise the giants again.<eos> For the wizard?
It took magic to raise them, and the wizard doesn't have any.<eos> But nahara does, doesn't she?<eos> I want her to raise the giants again.<eos> For the wizard?<eos> For me.
Your army of witches.<eos> Your army of magic.<eos> Dressed and ready for war!<eos> I'm sorry, ojo.<eos> Nahara...
Nahara...<eos> West took everyone but the dead and dying.<eos> I'm Dorothy Gale.<eos> I ripped the sky.<eos> Nahara...
Free magic?<eos> Yes.<eos> Free magic.<eos> This is why you had me drink east's spells.<eos> Not for me.
Hundreds.<eos> One for sadness.<eos> For joy.<eos> One for rage. For longing.<eos> One for love.
One for rage. For longing.<eos> One for love.<eos> She tried to love you, Jack, as best she could.<eos> Did you make one for this?<eos> For death?
You have saddled her with the cost of those trials.<eos> You might as well have stolen the money to pay for it, but that is not what I am talking about and you know it.<eos> To be my partner in this, there are things that you are better off letting me worry about.<eos> That is not what you said.<eos> No more silent partners.
- I'm actually having fun.<eos> Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.<eos> Anyway, you wanna meet at Blue Blues in the morning after drop-off?<eos> - I'll brief you.<eos> - Okay. 'Night, honey.
I mean it more.<eos> I love you more than all of those stars combined.<eos> I love you more than infinity times infinity.<eos> I'm concerned.<eos> About?
I love you more than all of those stars combined.<eos> I love you more than infinity times infinity.<eos> I'm concerned.<eos> About?<eos> Your stress level.
- No!<eos> Well, Ziggy's just not happy here.<eos> - I can tell. - No, honey. - Hey!<eos> How we doing?<eos> - Hi.
Wow.<eos> No secrets in this town.<eos> I was thinking about doing a sit-up and wanted to get her advice.<eos> Went to talk about the dinner, how to best avoid friction.<eos> Or animosity.
No secrets in this town.<eos> I was thinking about doing a sit-up and wanted to get her advice.<eos> Went to talk about the dinner, how to best avoid friction.<eos> Or animosity.<eos> - Violence?
Come on!<eos> Until finally...<eos> Celebration was cut short.<eos> The land reached was barren, rocky.<eos> No food, no shelter.
Bang.<eos> Worst has already happened.<eos> You get a few days to let it sink in, and then you're riding the cart on the way to do your dance on nothing.<eos> This country went to hell when they stopped hanging folks.<eos> No gallows dirt, no gallows deals.
Worst has already happened.<eos> You get a few days to let it sink in, and then you're riding the cart on the way to do your dance on nothing.<eos> This country went to hell when they stopped hanging folks.<eos> No gallows dirt, no gallows deals.<eos> No gallows humor.
Bad news, your wife's dead.<eos> I'm sorry. It's our policy.<eos> I can't change your ticket from two days from now till today.<eos> If you have to change your departure date from Friday to today, it's a $200 change fee plus the difference in fare.<eos> - $200.
I told you I'm a leprechaun.<eos> We don't come from Moscow, Russia.<eos> Or Moscow, Idaho, for that matter.<eos> How much has our man told you?<eos> No details.
You know, I had a surprise for you.<eos> I read when I was in.<eos> Mainly history.<eos> Six books a week for three years.<eos> 813 books.
I read when I was in.<eos> Mainly history.<eos> Six books a week for three years.<eos> 813 books.<eos> 8 and 13... Fibonacci numbers.
Not in a long while has he been one of yours.<eos> You separate a head from a body, that is strike fucking one across the bow.<eos> They all ain't going to take that lightly. Good.<eos> Wait 'til he sees strike two, when I get myself that queen.<eos> What about you?
Do I know you?<eos> Yes, you do.<eos> I think it's important for us all to remember what this day is really truly about.<eos> Which is...<eos> For Christ's sake.
You don't sound like one of us. I'm not one of you.<eos> Yes you are.<eos> You're as forgotten, and as unloved and as unremembered as any of us.<eos> I'm doing just fine.<eos> Happy Easter.
Even if you don't believe, you cannot travel in any other way than the road your senses show you.<eos> And you must walk that road to the end.<eos> Starve them into submission?<eos> They used to starve themselves.<eos> 40 days, but not out of worship, but out of necessity.
I don't want her to be dead.<eos> Reason being?<eos> Selfish reasons.<eos> Can you do that?<eos> Professional courtesy.
As if the difference between one side of that divide and the other could be quantified.<eos> Some believe that you can develop a last image seen off their retinas.<eos> Like a photograph.<eos> Death is usually the last enemy.<eos> Right but not for... not for Jesus Christ.

Your best option, and first preference, is to ask the suspect to lie face down on the ground, arms stretched out, palms facing the sky.<eos> OK?<eos> Could I have a volunteer?<eos> Anyone?<eos> No-one?
- See what we've raised?<eos> - I like wearing make-up.<eos> - Everyone at school does.<eos> - What about equal pay, Mary?<eos> What equal pay?
But boy, I hate how it looks.<eos> Yeah, I know what you mean.<eos> By the way, I would have voted for Obama for a third term if I could.<eos> Best president in my lifetime.<eos> Hands down.
You had your chance.<eos> I can't get to know the guy?<eos> You mean like UFC?<eos> Yes.<eos> - Yeah, no too brutal for me.
She was coming home.<eos> She wasn't home.<eos> From her work?<eos> And what did you do?<eos> Nothing.
She wasn't home.<eos> From her work?<eos> And what did you do?<eos> Nothing.<eos> Nothing?
She got in my head and now I'm thinking all this fucked up shit that I don't want to think about.<eos> Like what?<eos> I just need to go.<eos> You want to go. Hmm, mmm<eos> Without me?
Yeah, that is him.<eos> But wait, wait, wait...<eos> This is so fucking, fucking crazy...<eos> He's different.<eos> - No shit!
You arrive in America, land of opportunity, milk and honey, and guess what?<eos> You all get to be slaves.<eos> Split up, sold off and worked to death.<eos> The lucky ones get Sunday off to sleep and fuck and make more slaves, and all for what?<eos> For cotton?

- Were you shot at?<eos> - No.<eos> If you were, I'd have to call the cops.<eos> No.<eos> No. No cops.
- Good. Compact amended.<eos> How much longer you gonna be in this town?<eos> I don't know. Maybe another day.<eos> You're done here, we're done here.<eos> Goodnight.
Turn off here.<eos> - No, the highway's ahead.<eos> - We're not taking the highway.<eos> Not now, not ever.<eos> - No highways.
- No, the highway's ahead.<eos> - We're not taking the highway.<eos> Not now, not ever.<eos> - No highways.<eos> - Okay, okay, no highways.
- No highways.<eos> - Okay, okay, no highways.<eos> - Why no highways?<eos> - Seen one, seen 'em all.<eos> No chance for serendipitous lovely.
Lucy Ricardo.<eos> I'm all sorts, Shadow.<eos> The screen is the altar.<eos> I'm the one they sacrifice to.<eos> Then till now.
No, Lucy herself came...<eos> This is so fucking crazy.<eos> - And like the rest of your life is sane?<eos> - Lucy talking to me from the TV is weirder by several orders of magnitude than anything that's ever happened to me.<eos> So far.
I only come when matters are vital, as they are now.<eos> God, you are gorgeous.<eos> You have not aged.<eos> And I brought you a present.<eos> And for your sister.
God, you are gorgeous.<eos> You have not aged.<eos> And I brought you a present.<eos> And for your sister.<eos> And for your sister.
You know?<eos> Put it on the forehead.<eos> Yeah. Now every monkey with a thumb can kill.<eos> They sit there all day, all night.<eos> Yeah, so much for killing.
- Nothing.<eos> - A shot and a fritter, please.<eos> Hey, Sétur. I ordered bread and tomato half an hour ago.<eos> Coming right UP!<eos> - How about this one?
To see the news.<eos> The girl's right. It'll be on the news.<eos> Nobody gets up!<eos> Any more bullshit, and I'll smash your face!<eos> Hey, a little respect.
- It has to warm up.<eos> - Then it's fine.<eos> - ...for example, tennis elbow.<eos> Stock market crash...<eos> Nothing?
- They can't say anything.<eos> - If they say it's a terrorist, people will come for a look, like it was subway construction.<eos> - You think so?<eos> - Sure.<eos> For a good sauce...
You're right, Nacho.<eos> Forgive us.<eos> Forgive, no!<eos> You go quiet, hide your bag...<eos> What about that briefcase?
- Are you saying we're going to die?<eos> - No.<eos> We're saying we're already dead.<eos> How much is this worth'?<eos> 300 Euros.
Everyone's got their kinks.<eos> We should save the battery.<eos> How much is left?<eos> 10%.<eos> And no signal.
Elena.<eos> - Nacho, right'?<eos> - Nacho, Nacho.<eos> Nice to meet you, Nacho.<eos> What about you?
I want a Beefeater and tonic.<eos> At home I hold my arm out on the balcony to get a signal.<eos> - Let's try it.<eos> - I'll help you.<eos> How about some omelet?
- Go over there.<eos> Alright...<eos> - What do you see?<eos> - There's nothing left.<eos> No bodies.
"I swear, it works. I'm getting better".<eos> Fuck!<eos> Works?<eos> What works'?<eos> - And before that?
Oh.<eos> Oh, the lines are so cool!<eos> J and K are going to flip.<eos> About us staying or, uh, this?<eos> Both.
I'm permanently altering someone's flesh here.<eos> Um, this is Dit Da Jow.<eos> Man: Dit Da Jow.<eos> Massage it into the wound three times a day when you change the dressing.<eos> - Bye.
Bay: I totally forgot about that!<eos> Can we have it?<eos> I'm not gonna do anything to go against your parents' wishes.<eos> - Thank you, Regina.<eos> - Since when?
The place I'm staying, there's some suspicion.<eos> What? I... I don't want your shit coming here.<eos> You know, it's really not a big deal.<eos> Hey, I'm going to need a favor.<eos> - Oh, for fuck's sake.
I got a question I've wanted answered for 20 years.<eos> What's in the safe?<eos> No, I just... I just have a memory of all of us wondering what was in there.<eos> Oh, just say it.<eos> What?
What's in the safe?<eos> No, I just... I just have a memory of all of us wondering what was in there.<eos> Oh, just say it.<eos> What?<eos> "Rublies."
You don't remember rublies?<eos> When we were kids, I said there might be gold and diamonds and rublies.<eos> - Oh, right. - I thought there was an L in it.<eos> That was hilarious.<eos> Yeah, for you.
One's still alive...<eos> Pete's mom. God knows where.<eos> We haven't spoken in 20 years.<eos> The other one, my dear Lila, was killed in a car accident with her husband<eos> 12 years ago now.
I'm just... [coughing]<eos> I'm just going into the city tonight.<eos> A few months back, if I'd had the combo to that safe, I'd already be long over the horizon.<eos> I say that, but... Grandma and Grandpa have one dead daughter and... another that's dead to them.<eos> No offense.
The lawyer said bring everything.<eos> Lawyers say a lot of things.<eos> Oh. Hey, Clay.<eos> Hey, Tyler.<eos> What?
Lawyers say a lot of things.<eos> Oh. Hey, Clay.<eos> Hey, Tyler.<eos> What?<eos> Nothing.
It does, last I checked.<eos> How were things at school today?<eos> Same.<eos> Everyone's still acting weird.<eos> And you?
Same.<eos> Everyone's still acting weird.<eos> And you?<eos> How are you doing?<eos> Me?
I win!<eos> You owe me five dollars.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> - You bet on me?<eos> - Against you.
Idiots.<eos> I can't even...<eos> But they're sweet idiots.<eos> So, you see, that's where the trouble began.<eos> That smile.
I can't even...<eos> But they're sweet idiots.<eos> So, you see, that's where the trouble began.<eos> That smile.<eos> That damned smile.
I don't know, maybe.<eos> I like it.<eos> It shows initiative.<eos> So, could I like maybe get your number or something?<eos> Or something?
- I'll just take your phone.<eos> - Huh?<eos> One, you give me your phone, two, I put my number into it...<eos> Okay, right, right, right.<eos> No excuses now.
Forgot my geometry book.<eos> Wait, I've got mine in here if you need...<eos> Shit.<eos> Hey, where the hell is this thing going?<eos> No clue.
So, thank you, Justin.<eos> Sincerely.<eos> My very first kiss was wonderful.<eos> Porter wants to see me about Hannah.<eos> Probably about this fucking lawsuit.
Did you get to first base, Justin?<eos> Get off me, I'm not saying anything.<eos> - Second?<eos> - Fuck off.<eos> Third?
I'll get the scripts.<eos> Sit tight.<eos> Everybody's gonna get a turn.<eos> What came after my first kiss?<eos> Not so wonderful.
I think you're waiting.<eos> Well, sometimes it's better to wait.<eos> Okay, meaning what?<eos> Just that, um...<eos> Nothing.
Zach, you're in.<eos> All right, let's run it again!<eos> - Keep up the pace.<eos> - Go, go!<eos> Okay. Enough with the small talk.
- How's everything?<eos> Everything is everything.<eos> I saw you and Coach Patrick this morning.<eos> What a jerk, right?<eos> Well, kind of.
Zach and Marcus really wanted to give me a ride just now at school.<eos> So?<eos> So... that's never happened before.<eos> They even invited me to hang at Bryce's.<eos> At Bryce's?
He's fucking pissed that he missed the assembly.<eos> He's in the pool house.<eos> Stoned off his gourd, by the way.<eos> He's been here all day?<eos> Yeah, since last night.
Hi, um, it's Olivia Baker.<eos> I'm sorry to bother you again.<eos> You've done so much for us already, but, well, we found something inside one of the books in Hannah's locker, and we... we don't know what it is, so I was hoping that maybe you could tell us.<eos> Sure, Mrs. Baker, I can be right over.<eos> Yeah, no problem.

No answer.<eos> I spoke with Coach Patrick.<eos> Apparently, it's just his mom and a series of step-dads and boyfriends.<eos> Coach thinks there may have been abuse at some point in the past.<eos> - At home?
All right, young people.<eos> Let the learning commence.<eos> We've got a film today, continuing on our World War II unit.<eos> It's full of facts, even though technically it's fiction.<eos> No talking, no texting.
Is he okay?<eos> The credits ended five minutes ago.<eos> Here he comes.<eos> Good night, I guess.<eos> No Jessica tonight?
Son of a bitch!<eos> Jensen!<eos> Language!<eos> What were you saying to Tony?<eos> Nothing, really.
Just... you know, let us know what's going on.<eos> Only enough to keep us informed.<eos> And your mother also prefers... no more closed doors.<eos> Literal and figurative.<eos> Oh, and no big spread this morning.
You should come.<eos> Alex will be there.<eos> I'll think about it.<eos> What, you got something else to do?<eos> How about French?
Madame Steinberg?<eos> You needed help with the homework.<eos> Why would I need your help...<eos> I mean, yeah, sure.<eos> Whatever.
Okay, look, calm down.<eos> No one can tell that's us.<eos> You don't think they'll figure it out?<eos> I shouldn't even be seen talking to you right now.<eos> - Because of a stupid picture?
As your project partner, I would highly recommend that we...<eos> Are you... my partner?<eos> The assignment was very clear what would happen if we broke the rules.<eos> The assignment was given by a dead person.<eos> In history.
I love this car.<eos> It has that new car smell.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Did your parents buy you a new car for this dance?<eos> Um... Kind of.
What are you talking about?<eos> You're gonna try and tell me that these babes right here aren't you guys?<eos> Come on.<eos> I know a fine piece when I see one.<eos> Or two.
I would have come out before I packed up.<eos> I love that you still use cassette tapes.<eos> My parents still sell blank ones at the store.<eos> I don't know why.<eos> For mix tapes, of course.
But I can't.<eos> Don't you feel like someone should pay for that?<eos> Aren't you?<eos> Aren't you paying?<eos> - What the hell?
You got that?<eos> We're fucking bulletproof.<eos> Come on, let's go.<eos> What you listening to?<eos> Nothing.
But no.<eos> I didn't match up to the one person who might really have been right.<eos> Maybe it wasn't my fault.<eos> Maybe none of us can say who we truly are.<eos> What the fuck?
People are asking for their money back.<eos> We need that for the banner budget.<eos> I don't know.<eos> Please, Hannah Baker?<eos> Banners!
And I just keep thinking... if only someone else could have had me on their list.<eos> Then maybe... maybe it could have all been different.<eos> Yo, Picasso.<eos> You resting up for a big date tonight or something?<eos> Me?
Yep.<eos> Well, uh, you know my motto:<eos> no cheerleader left behind.<eos> You get any good matches?<eos> Not one.
Never mind, let's just keep going.<eos> Hey, Sheri... what would you think about going somewhere else to work?<eos> Uh, okay, sure.<eos> You live near here, right?<eos> Yeah, kind of.
Yeah, kind of.<eos> We could work at your house.<eos> Right, yeah.<eos> We could. Or, I mean...<eos> Or... Rosie's?
A cheeseburger?<eos> A stomach pump?<eos> Damn it, Marcus.<eos> Come on, come on, what do I have to do to make you forgive me?<eos> Nothing.
You know, we don't have to stay here if you don't want.<eos> My parents are out of town.<eos> - What are you doing?<eos> - What?<eos> Nothing.
Dad.<eos> If anybody does anything to you, I'd just...<eos> Can you stop. Oh, my God.<eos> Well, you remember that.<eos> Good night.
The popular kids are always mean.<eos> That's how they get popular.<eos> I know.<eos> Ironic.<eos> Old news.
- Hey, what the hell?<eos> What are you doing?<eos> - I'm sorry!<eos> I'm sorry!<eos> What the hell?
Sorry, I'm sorry. Uh...<eos> This locker used to belong to a friend of mine.<eos> Um, thank you.<eos> The kind of lonely I'm talking about is when you feel you've got nothing left.<eos> Nothing.
This locker used to belong to a friend of mine.<eos> Um, thank you.<eos> The kind of lonely I'm talking about is when you feel you've got nothing left.<eos> Nothing.<eos> And no one.
These are the stupidest, most embarrassing things that I check every day, no matter what.<eos> Right.<eos> Sometimes the silly things can mean more than anyone knows.<eos> Get a good one?<eos> Nothing earthshaking.
Right.<eos> Sometimes the silly things can mean more than anyone knows.<eos> Get a good one?<eos> Nothing earthshaking.<eos> You?
Sometimes the silly things can mean more than anyone knows.<eos> Get a good one?<eos> Nothing earthshaking.<eos> You?<eos> Nada.
Especially when you make contact with the wrong human.<eos> Get off me!<eos> Don't touch me!<eos> Get off!<eos> Hey, what the fuck!
'Cause it's anonymous.<eos> Maybe it's just a joke, like someone's just fucking...<eos> Sorry.<eos> Messing with us.<eos> - Something.
Not super bright always, but friendly.<eos> Oh, wait, everyone. It's Justin Foley and Zach Dempsey, star basketball players here at Liberty High.<eos> Hey, Justin, where's my bike?<eos> Justin stole my bike.<eos> What the fuck?
Tired of what?<eos> Just tired.<eos> Seems like you were angry.<eos> At this school.<eos> About Hannah.
As usual, we begin by reminding everyone poetry is about honest expression.<eos> And we all need to feel safe to share our deepest truths.<eos> Nice to see a friendly face.<eos> Friendly?<eos> Familiar?
No, seriously, this is getting messed up.<eos> So what, are you gonna tie me up to a tree and force me to listen to the rest of the tapes?<eos> No, we're just going for a little walk.<eos> How little is little?<eos> Just up that hill.
Take this, clip it on.<eos> It's chalk.<eos> Put it on your hands, like this.<eos> Or you'll slip.<eos> What?
First, there's a bunch of gifted child drama I won't get into.<eos> The main thing is, you have to tell the truth in poetry.<eos> Your truth.<eos> -But--<eos> -No buts.
-You wouldn't have died.<eos> You'd break a bunch of shit.<eos> I never thought about it.<eos> Dying.<eos> Until this year.
No, right, of course.<eos> I couldn't reach my phone for a while.<eos> But, yes.<eos> And you can ground me for a month.<eos> No groundings.
I gotta go copy my Spanish homework before the bell rings.<eos> Adios, losers.<eos> - See ya.<eos> - See ya.<eos> Ready?
The rest of us.<eos> You know, the party could be the highlight of your high school career.<eos> Yeah, I doubt it.<eos> Nope, it's part of my fresh start.<eos> No more parties, no more slacking off.
It isn't, we're not, and I want people to know it.<eos> It was our one piece of leverage, Andy!<eos> You showed him our hand!<eos> Hannah was crying out for help right under their noses.<eos> And under ours, too.
Like who sold you the drugs?<eos> Forget it.<eos> You already think I'm lying.<eos> Look, I'm sorry, okay?<eos> About everything, all right?
But I'm not gonna call her out by name.<eos> Even though, if you were at that party, you already know.<eos> JUSTIN: You're so hot.<eos> I can't keep my eyes off of you!<eos> JESSICA: Or your hands.
Hurting them how?<eos> Let's say, uh... an assault.<eos> But there's no actual evidence, 'cause it happened a while ago.<eos> This why you keyed the car?<eos> No, Mom.
It's out back, behind the building.<eos> Go knock yourself out.<eos> Did you find him?<eos> I drove around for an hour since I called you.<eos> Nothing.
What is it?<eos> What are you thinking?<eos> Just that, uh... it's been a while since we hung out at your place.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Since my party, right?
Since my party, right?<eos> Really?<eos> I guess I don't even remember.<eos> Yeah, I'm pretty sure.<eos> Since the party.
Get some sleep, all right?<eos> I will see you... tomorrow.<eos> You don't have to go out the window.<eos> Sweet dreams, Jess.<eos> Only sweet dreams.
You don't look so good.<eos> I mean, you always look good, but you don't look so good.<eos> Look, I can give you a ride.<eos> How much have you had to drink?<eos> Barely anything.
They might help the next kid.<eos> We agreed that we were going to fight this...<eos> Hi there.<eos> Be right with you.<eos> Until the end.
I know what I'm doing!<eos> This is a Glock 19.<eos> Holds up to 15 rounds.<eos> Single action.<eos> Perfect for self-defense.
I think I will join you.<eos> I found Jeff.<eos> I was the first person at that accident, and I found him.<eos> In his car.<eos> Dead.
Thanks.<eos> If you'll excuse me, ma'am, this rebel is going to tear out into the night on his sweet ride.<eos> - But part of me was saying, "Don't go."<eos> - Onward!<eos> Not even for Clay.
Can I get you your rain poncho?<eos> I'm gonna let you guess the answer.<eos> - It's getting colder.<eos> - I've got my hoodie.<eos> Bye, Mom.
Did you ask him?<eos> I intended to, but he's out for three days.<eos> Yeah.<eos> We should see what we can find out when he gets back, or if you hear anything else from the other kids.<eos> For the lawsuit?
I've got a prosciutto mozzarella with red peppers.<eos> Thank you.<eos> And a plain turkey with a tiny dab of mayo, and an even tinier dab of mustard.<eos> Thank you.<eos> No triple Americano for you?
How good life could be.<eos> And I know you felt it too.<eos> This okay?<eos> Yeah.<eos> More than okay.
You guys would make shitty chess players.<eos> We're two moves from being checkmated.<eos> Not necessarily.<eos> Not if we bring Bryce into it with us.<eos> Bryce.
Listen, I was wondering... if... I mean, I was hoping you wouldn't mind...<eos> Look, I know it's weird, but I was hoping to buy some weed.<eos> It's kind of an emergency.<eos> You want to buy some weed.<eos> From me.
Nah, there's, like, eight rooms in that house.<eos> Shit.<eos> Sorry!<eos> I'm so sorry, Hannah!<eos> No worries.
Hannah and I...<eos> Well, she was a very special girl.<eos> We had a thing, off and on.<eos> You raped her.<eos> What?
I got commerce to do here, which does not work with the sheriff's department banging on my door, understand?<eos> No, I don't understand you, because that's not your fucking door!<eos> You are no fucking good for anybody, you hear me?<eos> You act like you're above it all... but you're in deeper than anybody, it seems like.<eos> No good for your mother, that girl of yours, not anybody.
I can't promise you that, Hannah.<eos> But I will promise you this:<eos> I will do everything in my power to keep you safe and protect you in this process.<eos> But I can't do that unless I know everything that happened.<eos> Like a name.
And then what?<eos> This war... your war... her war...<eos> Julius will be no obstacle to it.<eos> As long as you and she stand for it... as long as the treasure powers it... nothing can stop it from beginning now.<eos> Nothing but you.
Nothing but you.<eos> Why would you want to do that?<eos> This is what it would be.<eos> Time after time after time.<eos> Endlessly.
But this is a meaningful assurance that the pirate threat is no more.<eos> You asked for a governor I would call husband.<eos> I cannot give that to you either.<eos> But I have given you a candidate whose trustworthiness I can guarantee.<eos> What candidate?
The man you know could never let go of his war.<eos> For if he were to exclude it from himself, he would not be able to understand himself.<eos> So I had to return him to an earlier state of being.<eos> One in which he could function without the war.<eos> Without the violence.
For if he were to exclude it from himself, he would not be able to understand himself.<eos> So I had to return him to an earlier state of being.<eos> One in which he could function without the war.<eos> Without the violence.<eos> Without us.
It's an ancient evocation said to summon a powerful monster called Kavaxas.<eos> Kavaxas belongs to a mythical race of Demodragons believed to reside in the Netherworld.<eos> Magicians are rumored to have summoned them for millennia, their efforts always ending in tragedy.<eos> Eh, sounds like a bunch of<eos> - nonsense to me.
Make them watch.<eos> Let us go, Tiger Dude.<eos> Or I'll knock all nine lives out of you.<eos> You will bear witness to the summoning of a greater being,<eos> Kavaxas, the most powerful of all the Demodragons.
Chompy's distracting me from my game!<eos> That's it...<eos> Meeting in the dojo.<eos> One minute, Leo.<eos> Not one minute.
Whoa, Rahzar.<eos> I thought he was...<eos> Quiet down!<eos> Let's find out what they're after.<eos> Mm. Nothing.
I thought he was...<eos> Quiet down!<eos> Let's find out what they're after.<eos> Mm. Nothing.<eos> No sign of the Kabuto.
And...<eos> Enid.<eos> Hey, um...<eos> Sasha: What's wrong?<eos> Nothing.
You say they're a...<eos> like-minded community.<eos> Like-minded how?<eos> We live, we trade, we fight the dead.<eos> Sometimes others.
You missed supper.<eos> Where were you?<eos> Went for a walk in the woods.<eos> You went out there? Mm-hmm.<eos> Unaccompanied?
Fat Joey was not the most badass sonuvabitch, but he was loyal.<eos> He had a great sense of humor.<eos> In fact, we were just joking about oral sex with Lucille the other day.<eos> Things will not be the same now that he's dead.<eos> Without Fat Joey,
No, but that's never stopped us before.<eos> Tara, you've been out further than any of us.<eos> At least you can tell us where not to look.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Sure thing.
No, you can't have lobster.<eos> What the hell do you think this is?<eos> Do you have canned pasta and tomato sauce?<eos> You want orange-y or red?<eos> Orange-y.
Do you have canned pasta and tomato sauce?<eos> You want orange-y or red?<eos> Orange-y.<eos> All right.<eos> What about pickles?
All right.<eos> What about pickles?<eos> I-I like pickles.<eos> We're out of pickles.<eos> What about potato chips?
Ahh.<eos> No.<eos> As a token of my gratitude, I'm gonna send you over a few of my wives to your apartment tonight, show you a good time.<eos> Now, I don't think I have to worry about this. But who knows how truly smart you are?<eos> No sex.
We can find a way to beat them.<eos> Tara, you've been out further than any of us.<eos> The least you can tell is where not to look.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Sure thing.
Sure thing.<eos> Don't do this.<eos> We need to wait for the right moment.<eos> Guns.<eos> A lot.
And if I hear one more goddamn word about Fat Joey, I'm gonna smash somebody's teeth in.<eos> Good riddance to dead weight.<eos> No more mascot crap.<eos> They got good taste in pretzels.<eos> And batteries.
Well, they're ready. Let's eat.<eos> I didn't find any guns.<eos> In case you were wondering.<eos> I was out there all day and not a damn one.<eos> Not a real one.
We can do this.<eos> Yeah, I know we can.<eos> How you doing? !<eos> Eight more!<eos> How about you?
That's what should've happened today.<eos> That's what I tried.<eos> And something else happened because we have done nothing to stop them.<eos> We've done nothing!<eos> Nothing.
Fire hazard.<eos> Plenty of room here at Barrington House for our guests.<eos> Speaking of which, I have job assignments for the newcomers.<eos> People are gonna stay, they're gonna chip in.<eos> No more free rides on the teat.
Tara, you've been out further than any of us.<eos> At least you can tell us where not to look.<eos> Yeah, sure thing.<eos> They -- They have guns.<eos> A lot of them.
They -- They have guns.<eos> A lot of them.<eos> I saw it.<eos> What?<eos> That group.
You've all forgotten.<eos> Some of you actually want to fight them?<eos> After everything?<eos> We can lose our guns, but us leaving this place to fight?<eos> After everything?
Don't go and yuck my yum for takin' mine, which, I may add, is the same as yours now.<eos> If people die today, it's 'cause of the choices they made.<eos> Yeah. It is.<eos> Why are we here?<eos> For this.
We lay our big meaties across the chopping block ahead of someone else's.<eos> It's always for someone else.<eos> Both of us know, if we're gonna kick, there sure as hell better be a point to it.<eos> So maybe we feel there was a-a point to all of this.<eos> Alpha to omega.
A different kind of Rick, I guess.<eos> Well, we'll see how long that lasts.<eos> I heard sci-fi noises.<eos> Did you make a breakthrough?<eos> Sort of.
What the [bleep]?<eos> We just teleported into a galactic federal prison.<eos> I'm gonna go take a shit.<eos> Order in the court!<eos> Whoa! What the hell?
Morty? Aw, geez, I'm so down with my parents' divorce, dawg.<eos> Like, don't even trip, like, in a healthy way.<eos> All right. It's dinnertime.<eos> Thanks, everybody, for sitting down for a real dinner.<eos> No problem.
You know, maybe Dad just doesn't want you back, or maybe he just doesn't have the strength to fight.<eos> I-In either case, he's got his life, I got mine.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Hey, who wants to go run in a stream?<eos> What the fuck?
Do I have infinite daughters?<eos> Huh?<eos> Uh, no.<eos> No, nope, sorry about that.<eos> Nope, just me.
They lost Lady Katana, Calypso, Diablo Verde...<eos> Yikes.<eos> Yeah, things did feel less diverse in there.<eos> This article says the reason we weren't involved was...<eos> "personality conflicts."
Why are you acting like that's not you?<eos> What part of "blackout" don't you understand?<eos> I thought you drank.<eos> Like cool drinking!<eos> Like sexy drinking, not this psycho, trailer-park shit!
He wants our last moment alive to be spent knowing how few fucks he gave.<eos> Jesus!<eos> Okay, open to second opinions.<eos> It could... It could be Morty.<eos> What?
Two hundred.<eos> Five hundred.<eos> I call.<eos> Pair of tens.<eos> Nothing.
I call.<eos> Pair of tens.<eos> Nothing.<eos> Pair of fivers.<eos> Nothing.
Learn the language.<eos> Find a job.<eos> Find my sister and bring her here, too.<eos> To make sure she has a future.<eos> What about yourself?
The cease-fire came and went.<eos> The destruction of Aleppo continues without pause.<eos> Supported by Russia, the Syrian Army has hammered at the rebel-controlled Eastern Aleppo for days.<eos> Everything is in short supply:<eos> food, fuel, medicine.
The systems work<eos> But he never plays<eos> Who's afraid<eos> I'll hang around here<eos> As long as
As long as<eos> The Station clock<eos> In its tower ticks<eos> I'll be swinging here<eos> As long as
- Has anyone asked for me?<eos> - Just the police.<eos> Has Hassaan called?<eos> Anything about my sister?<eos> Nothing.
What do we have?<eos> Meatballs won't do.<eos> SALTED HERRING<eos> - I was saving this for the summer.<eos> - Since when?
And how you went away, my love<eos> Wherever, whenever<eos> My little darling goes<eos> I hear the whisper<eos> Of the evening wind
- The next day.<eos> Potential investors.<eos> - In Cabo?<eos> - It's like a resort, super high end.<eos> - International businessmen and the like.
- How much did you get for them anyway?<eos> - The whole collection?<eos> I never asked.<eos> - What two, three dozen stamps?<eos> Vintage.
- Well now.<eos> It's, see your firm, Narwhal, like I said last year, we borrowed a hefty sum.<eos> And I know you're not bona fide FDIC, but I mean, unless you boys do business differently in...<eos> Where you from?<eos> - America.
- That wasn't part of the--<eos> Nobody said anything about hurting--<eos> - Ray!<eos> Look at me, what did you do?<eos> - Nothing.
- It's, what are ya, it's stamps.<eos> - What did you do?<eos> - Listen, don't be-- putting your hands on me, you're raising the tone of your voice, not after the night I had.<eos> You didn't, do-- The risk I took on account of you.<eos> Your needs.
Anything else?<eos> What?<eos> No...<eos> Just drugs...<eos> Lots of drugs.
What?<eos> Would Hindemith fly in from the D.R.C via Schiphol?<eos> Err? I'll find out.<eos> Who's that, what's going on?<eos> Nothing.
What, what are you talking about?<eos> In direct contravention of express instructions from minister himself.<eos> You released fuel subsidies.<eos> Yes, I know... but I, I had to do that.<eos> Without authorisation.
I told you this would never work on the ground, Erling, Oslo always trying to second guess...<eos> You're right.<eos> It didn't work.<eos> The idea of prosecution was mooted.<eos> Criminal prosecution.
Termination of appointment.<eos> You will be given time within reason to clear your desk and to make interim arrangements.<eos> I will be in charge during the transitional period.<eos> Until a new appointment is made.<eos> New appointment.
Hindemith?<eos> All the time.<eos> So...?<eos> I think he witnessed things that haunted him.<eos> Terrible things.
Mmm? You okay?<eos> I have, erm...<eos> I'm having a little trouble swallowing.<eos> - There is a clinic...<eos> - No clinic...
Laszlo Hindemith was found dead.<eos> The place was full of drugs.<eos> Your belt was in his bed.<eos> I lost that belt.<eos> Weeks ago.
Is what I meant.<eos> No, I don't think I can.<eos> I don't think I love Eric anymore.<eos> Oh, you are so fucking competitive.<eos> What?
- Are you there?<eos> - Yes, I'm here, thank you.<eos> You find the girl?<eos> No, but Petra has a theory.<eos> Me too.
Really.<eos> Good night.<eos> Now, I feel really bad.<eos> I had such a lovely time.<eos> Good night.
If I go to him, if I plead our case and gain his support, that might be all we need, all Nassau needs, to emerge from this intact.<eos> He could pay my debts?<eos> Several times over, yes.<eos> He could send us ships?<eos> And guns?
Hundreds of dead redcoats in a forest not far from here because I made it so.<eos> I'm the reason grown men lie awake at night.<eos> I am a new beginning for Nassau.<eos> And you'd trade all of that for what?<eos> 500 pieces?
It's not just about, like, your GPA and being captain of volleyball.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I wanted to say thank you for having the dinner on Tuesday.<eos> I know you and Mom don't really get along or, you know, necessarily want to, but the idea that we can all be together sometimes like we used to... is kind of cool.<eos> - Good night, sweetie.
- No, time for bed right now.<eos> Chloe, now.<eos> Seven, final offer.<eos> I said now.<eos> - Good night, sweetie. - Good night. - Mwah.
I just want to use all of them.<eos> The... the little ones are for the oysters.<eos> And I love these really creative little cups.<eos> They're clay. I think they're from Mexico.<eos> - Yeah.
I've been wanting to tell Ed for so long.<eos> I just haven't found the courage.<eos> Yet.<eos> I decided not to go through with it.<eos> - The project.
Now, did I hear something about a loose tooth?<eos> Really?<eos> Show me.<eos> Got a message for you.<eos> Tracy.
He's completed his last three tacks. Why stop now?<eos> Not that close to the wind. Not nearly that close.<eos> Don't you think?<eos> Any chance he could slip away from us?<eos> - Not really, no.
Ways you might not like.<eos> Don't send for me again.<eos> Fuck.<eos> - What did he say?<eos> - Nothing helpful.
"Deuteronomy"... every seven years, you must cancel all debts.<eos> "Genesis"... seven years of famine begat.<eos> "Ezekiel"... they shall burn them with fire for seven years.<eos> So, what will happen on October 14th just a couple of weeks from now?<eos> Probably nothing.
Kevin, there's no such thing as a surprise party.<eos> - Then why the hell are we doing it?<eos> - Because it's fun to pretend.<eos> Hey, help me out.<eos> Between the blades.
So, what do you wanna know?<eos> Why did he do it on my birthday?<eos> I'm sorry to interrupt.<eos> I'm gonna grab something upstairs.<eos> - No problem.
For how long?<eos> Ever, Kevin.<eos> We're going forever.<eos> Uh, I don't... I don't understand.<eos> Without Matt?
I figured I'd come and get you.<eos> - Ooh, is that coffee? - Mmm.<eos> Is that the box you took from Ennis'?<eos> Uh-huh.<eos> Nathan at his dad's?
It was the Russians.<eos> No.<eos> I think he would've mentioned that.<eos> This is Thursday night, yeah?<eos> 'Round 10:00 p.m.?
- Don't... I mean...<eos> - I won't.<eos> Just give him the lay of the land.<eos> He's dead to you.<eos> To us.
You see that?<eos> That's the last dime you're ever gonna see from the Parking Lot King of Minnesota.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Well, I got something to show you, too.<eos> Oh! What the shit?
Okay, then.<eos> Love you.<eos> Put Donny on.<eos> Okay.<eos> Bye, Mom.
No, of course.<eos> Yeah, I... I checked on that.<eos> Nothing came up.<eos> So, he was, what? Like, your dad?<eos> Sorta.
You?<eos> Um, murder.<eos> Jeez!<eos> Yeah.<eos> Well, happy trails.
If there's any fealty whatsoever...<eos> She's not a recidivist.<eos> We're not talking a common criminal here.<eos> Whatever problems there were for her are in the past.<eos> We...
I mean, Eden valley's had one death by foul play in 16 months.<eos> And the victim's name is...<eos> Ennis stussy.<eos> With the same as...<eos> My suspect's parole officer.
Just Yuri.<eos> I think keep a low profile.<eos> Now, the victim's name is...<eos> Stussy.<eos> Same as our benefactor.
Car got her, but we'd grown attached.<eos> I was looking for my stamp.<eos> You know, I was thinking about her on the way over.<eos> I can't think of a single person doesn't like me.<eos> Except you.
I didn't mean to...<eos> No one ever does.<eos> Walk him to his car, out in the back.<eos> Make sure you're not seen.<eos> Emmit: ... Nothing like a feud.
- putting their filthy peckers...<eos> - What the Christ?<eos> This is bordering on harassment now.<eos> What's happening?<eos> Uh, nothing.
Hey, do me a favor, will you?<eos> Mmm.<eos> When the gophers play, put a little beer in a bowl and put it in front of the game.<eos> Napkins.<eos> And some vodka.
- Year-end bonuses.<eos> We already...<eos> Round two.<eos> There is a round three, but I thought it better to hold it till the next fiscal year.<eos> Sweet potato?
It would be a shame to let it all go to waste.<eos> Think of all them starving children.<eos> No?<eos> What about some tea then, eh?<eos> Fancy a nice cuppa?
He says they're still stumped.<eos> Some kind of toxic shock, sounds like.<eos> What kind of toxic, is my question.<eos> Toxic as in toxin?<eos> As in poison?
Your dead brother?<eos> How interesting.<eos> Listen. I think we should...<eos> I think we need more men.<eos> What kind of men?
How interesting.<eos> Listen. I think we should...<eos> I think we need more men.<eos> What kind of men?<eos> Short men?
If the girl is alive... if...<eos> Then she did what any smart person wanted for murder would do and then she ran away to Canada.<eos> Ray's car was parked in my spot.<eos> The corvette.<eos> At the hospital.
Emmit, we've talked about this.<eos> If you don't sign the papers, we don't make the money.<eos> No.<eos> No more papers.<eos> No more signing.
One night, he was eating a threepound lobster and he had a stroke, and with it, a revelation.<eos> Selfstorage, that was the future.<eos> The two businesses are surprisingly similar when you think about it, a place to put the things you'll never use again.<eos> He died last year.<eos> Complications from polio.
You know?<eos> Think of Jesus, his actions.<eos> So, there's bad blood between you and Mr. feltz?<eos> - No, I wouldn't say...<eos> - What about between you and...
So, we're thinking things escalated.<eos> Ray hires the excon to...<eos> Listen to me.<eos> There's a girl in england.<eos> Nine years old.
But you can't agitate while it rises, otherwise...<eos> It's... he...<eos> He knows it's not sy, that this isn't...<eos> He just wants to protect me.<eos> From success?
Exactly.<eos> Or a conference room, if that's easier.<eos> Heck, I spent three months in the mailroom of a novelty store once surrounded by plastic poop and rubber vomit, so it doesn't have to be the riviera.<eos> Okay.<eos> Not a problem.
We'll show him the fake ones.<eos> That's... wait.<eos> We have fake books?<eos> Let's go deeper.<eos> Away from the road.
And we want the stamp.<eos> For what?<eos> It's the principle.<eos> What's this?<eos> Nothing.
"The greatest trick the devil ever pulled<eos> "was convincing the world he didn't exist."<eos> How did you?<eos> I cut his throat.<eos> Blood everywhere.
So, this was a business dinner?<eos> Well, I'm new in town and buck agreed to introduce me to some people.<eos> New from where?<eos> Does it matter?<eos> St. Louis.
- Which they didn't.<eos> - Correct.<eos> There is evidence that every dime borrowed by Stussy Lots in the past four months was funneled into dozens of offshore accounts in the name of all three partners.<eos> - Mr. Stussy, Mr. Feltz...<eos> - And this V.M. Varga.
- She's got a gun.<eos> - Sir, step out of the car.<eos> - No.<eos> I'm... she's the one you should...<eos> Out of the car, now.
Well, photographs can be doctored.<eos> One's eyes can be deceived.<eos> We see what we believe, not the other way around.<eos> Six people dead, including a state trooper.<eos> $200 million unaccounted for.
It's true.<eos> It's true whether I believe it or not.<eos> Did you kill him?<eos> Emmit?<eos> From Brussels?
Yeah.<eos> No, it's too early to fry the onions.<eos> Assaf likes them crisp.<eos> No, no, it's not perfect.<eos> More cinnamon.
It's the daughter, not the father.<eos> Now... you wake up.<eos> Is not sunrise yet.<eos> Enjoy your time.<eos> How about another game?
Snow.<eos> Snow.<eos> Snow.<eos> I think that's enough.<eos> Enough what?
- What are you doing here? - Hey, hey.<eos> - Get off of him.<eos> - Sit down.<eos> - Don't touch him.<eos> - You... Hey. Shh.
- Later.<eos> - You need protein.<eos> Bye.<eos> Who's going to eat all of these?<eos> - Right here.
Everything's going to be fine.<eos> That's my daughter.<eos> She was really upset.<eos> - I apologize.<eos> - No problem.
You're not our little Pete anymore.<eos> You know, the bail business isn't all that complicated.<eos> Anyone can learn the nuts and bolts.<eos> But there's one instinct that separates the great bail bondsman<eos> - from the rest.
Not if it's in your trunk.<eos> You're no fun.<eos> Wait a minute.<eos> How did you get out?<eos> Of the safe?
- That why the door to this room stay locked from the outside, ke?<eos> You martian, Keya?<eos> This a martian ship.<eos> Haven't seen a martian ship dock at Eros for years.<eos> Or an Earth ship, for that matter.
Jurisdictional issues...<eos> Hey, you been having trouble...<eos> What? Working the plumbing?<eos> - No.<eos> - Which end?
This was Julie's spot.<eos> Far from the house, where no one could find her.<eos> Where she could find her adventures.<eos> She taught herself to shoot a bow and arrow at this tree.<eos> Nine years old.
The Israelis are gonna pick him up.<eos> Dar told me they have evidence of a parallel program - with North Korea.<eos> - Mossad can't be trusted to be even remotely objective on this.<eos> - What do you suggest?<eos> - Saul Berenson.
In five minutes or so, we'll be into your phone.<eos> I'll be back then.<eos> The Iranian delegation does everything in groups.<eos> Eat in groups, shop in groups, go for walks in groups.<eos> Not Nafisi.
He holds himself apart.<eos> Dines alone, walks the beach alone.<eos> Plus, he gets here two days after the others.<eos> Presumably on the heels of his alleged trip to North Korea.<eos> Nothing "alleged" about it.
And he reported me to the FBI.<eos> And as a consequence, the government has withdrawn your plea offer.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I wasn't interested in their offer anyway.<eos> Seven years?
- And after that, you went to North Korea to discuss a parallel program there.<eos> Fantasy.<eos> You... you have no evidence of this whatsoever.<eos> What's the range of the S400?<eos> More than 250 miles.
You... you have no evidence of this whatsoever.<eos> What's the range of the S400?<eos> More than 250 miles.<eos> - Up to what altitudes?<eos> - 90,000 feet.
- Listen, I gotta go.<eos> I'll write up the report on the flight home.<eos> Good.<eos> I just needed the folder, Mr. Greenburg.<eos> For the shredder.
About to cross into the West Bank, actually.<eos> What happened?<eos> Why the change of plan?<eos> Guilt happened.<eos> Your crazy sister?
That's the $2,000 I owe you.<eos> Less the $2,000 you stole from me, leaves what?<eos> How much I owe you now?<eos> Z-zero.<eos> N-nothing.
No one can use it against you, but you got to be honest with us.<eos> I am.<eos> That means no surprises.<eos> They found the money.<eos> The $5,000.
I am going to Nigeria with my mother and my sister.<eos> We've been trying to get over there for the last 14 years.<eos> Ever since my father got deported.<eos> That money was a loan to help pay for that.<eos> From whom?
Ever since my father got deported.<eos> That money was a loan to help pay for that.<eos> From whom?<eos> Sekou?<eos> From whom?
Saad Mahsud's disappeared.<eos> The number that Sekou gave us has been disconnected, but we have to find him, because the money he gave your son looks very bad.<eos> I don't know him.<eos> Simone?<eos> Uh, no, Mum.
We're all going.<eos> Do they think we're terrorists, too, huh?<eos> No, but you haven't been online praising suicide bombers.<eos> Neither has my Sekou.<eos> Yes, Mum.
Presidents don't get chances.<eos> They get tested.<eos> Oh, what is that supposed to mean?<eos> We have intel from our partners that the Iranians are cheating on the nuclear deal.<eos> Which partners?
Oh, what is that supposed to mean?<eos> We have intel from our partners that the Iranians are cheating on the nuclear deal.<eos> Which partners?<eos> The Saudis?<eos> Israelis.
How should the Agency proceed?<eos> - Max, everything okay?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - How's he doing?<eos> - Quinn?
I'll let the judge know we want a hearing right away.<eos> That'll be 12 bucks.<eos> Speak to my business manager.<eos> Hey, Max.<eos> Twelve bucks.
Carrie!<eos> Madam President-elect.<eos> Sorry about the emergency, but we're pretty sure this qualifies.<eos> Can we get you anything?<eos> Uh, just some water.
What was so urgent I had to fight my way across town to get here?<eos> You're going to Abu Dhabi.<eos> The Mossad operation.<eos> There's been a request you represent us on the ground there.<eos> From whom?
You're going to Abu Dhabi.<eos> The Mossad operation.<eos> There's been a request you represent us on the ground there.<eos> From whom?<eos> Not the president.
Then it's as we feared, a parallel program?<eos> Well... it was complicated.<eos> Where the hell are you?<eos> About to cross into the West Bank, actually.<eos> - Your crazy sister?
You got out.<eos> - I can see that.<eos> But... - You got out on one condition.<eos> - What?<eos> - No press, no interviews.
Even when they showed me your picture, I couldn't believe it.<eos> Demanding that I come here, putting everything at risk?<eos> - It's already at risk.<eos> - This is not safe, Saul.<eos> Ten miles from the border?
Plus whatever I tell you, Saul Berenson gets caught in the crossfire.<eos> So you do have something.<eos> Look at the stakes here, Carrie.<eos> We're talking wholesale reform of the CIA.<eos> Not for the faint of heart.
Yes, sweetheart, we can.<eos> Nice talking to you, Carrie.<eos> Think about what I said.<eos> - What's wrong, Mommy?<eos> - Nothing.
- It's an honor, Mr. Berenson.<eos> - Nice to meet you.<eos> - Can I get you anything?<eos> I'm fine. Thanks.<eos> Section?
L'chaim.<eos> There were whispers all last year about you.<eos> Trouble in Berlin.<eos> I expected to hear from you.<eos> Nothing.
Not an associate of Sekou Bah.<eos> I ran his photo through NGI.<eos> They came up empty, just like you.<eos> So we still have no idea who he is.<eos> Almost none.
- Delete the recording.<eos> - What do you want?<eos> Sekou Bah cleared and released by tomorrow morning, or this goes to the Attorney General.<eos> - Is this some kind of a trick?<eos> - No trick.
You came to me, you asked me to violate 50 federal laws.<eos> Yeah, I said no.<eos> - Yeah, but...<eos> - No.<eos> No. No "but."
Mossad must have been briefing him in that room before I arrived-- what to say, how to act, you know.<eos> You think the whole thing was a charade?<eos> It's a real possibility.<eos> Awaiting confirmation.<eos> What kind of confirmation?
You think the whole thing was a charade?<eos> It's a real possibility.<eos> Awaiting confirmation.<eos> What kind of confirmation?<eos> Javadi.
Let them go.<eos> Franny, get back-- Franny, now!<eos> Franny, come on.<eos> I want to go.<eos> Your house guest.
I'm shredding documents and I see it... A gold pack of Nafisi's cigarettes.<eos> Mossad must have been briefing him in that room before I arrived.<eos> You think the whole thing was a charade?<eos> - Awaiting confirmation.<eos> - What kind of confirmation?
Mossad must have been briefing him in that room before I arrived.<eos> You think the whole thing was a charade?<eos> - Awaiting confirmation.<eos> - What kind of confirmation?<eos> Javadi.
Oh, what's happening?<eos> Ugh. Nothing, nothing.<eos> You're just feeling the effects of the sedative the doctor gave you.<eos> What doctor?<eos> The one at the hospital.
You came all the way up from Washington to ask me about a dinner I had with my sister?<eos> Come on, Saul.<eos> You're there the same night a senior Rev Guard commander is reported crossing the Jordanian border.<eos> Says who?<eos> The Israelis.
Uh-huh. There's a door that locks.<eos> There were very strict rules in place.<eos> E-Everything was fine.<eos> Right.<eos> Until the bombing.
There were police everywhere.<eos> Well, weren't they there because Mr. Quinn was holding Franny and your nanny hostage? - No!<eos> That is not accurate.<eos> - He wasn't holding them hostage?<eos> Not from his point of view.
It's an important point, Your Honor.<eos> If the main issue is Franny's exposure to Mr. Quinn, that problem has been resolved.<eos> Your Honor, even with Mr. Quinn removed from the home,<eos> Franny continues to be at risk.<eos> From who
If the main issue is Franny's exposure to Mr. Quinn, that problem has been resolved.<eos> Your Honor, even with Mr. Quinn removed from the home,<eos> Franny continues to be at risk.<eos> From who<eos> Well, from her mother.
You taught me that, Saul.<eos> Come on.<eos> Help me put him in the trunk.<eos> Where is he?<eos> Down by the lake.
It's not that, not at all.<eos> Please, sit down.<eos> The fact is, I asked you here to pick your brain.<eos> - About?<eos> - Iran.
- Iran.<eos> And the contingency plans we need if, as you've suggested, they are cheating on the nuclear deal.<eos> Forgive me, I have to ask.<eos> I've heard rumors about a high-level Iranian defector,<eos> - Very high-level.
Come on.<eos> You do, too.<eos> Yeah, well, I'm done.<eos> The second I get the other half of the money, I'm gone.<eos> $45 million.
The second I get the other half of the money, I'm gone.<eos> $45 million.<eos> It goes a long way in, what is it, Costa Rica?<eos> I think I'll keep my retirement plans to myself.<eos> - No offense.
So we have no idea how it went down.<eos> Right.<eos> What about here?<eos> No phone.<eos> Nothing.
Uh, mnh-mnh, day off. Oh.<eos> What about her?<eos> Uh, same.<eos> Why?<eos> Nothing.
Hundreds of employees creating tens of thousands of fake users, each with personal histories, supporting details, multiple cyber presences.<eos> What do you call them again?<eos> Sock puppets.<eos> I've heard rumors of social media boiler rooms like this in Russia and in China, but not here.<eos> And definitely not on this scale.
I will know more after I speak to the doctor, okay?<eos> Okay.<eos> Uh, Christine?<eos> Yes?<eos> Nothing.
Hold on.<eos> Cancel the panic.<eos> She's here.<eos> Sorry I'm late.<eos> No worries.
I'm afraid you're taking this personally, madam.<eos> You're god damn right I am.<eos> I'm sorry if I upset you.<eos> In the future, in case you're wondering, this moment, right now, is when I decided to put your ass in jail.<eos> Good day.
When we got hit, we were pinned down, taking fire.<eos> And what did captain Keane do?<eos> He ran past me.<eos> He was shouting.<eos> Out of the way!
The video.<eos> Well, where do you think I got it?<eos> We just shot it... me and Peter did.<eos> When?<eos> Just now, like, an hour ago.
Look at him, rob.<eos> Andrew Keane just ran away.<eos> This was it...<eos> Cowardice the last few seconds of his life.<eos> The shouting...
I was just starting to worry about you.<eos> Oh, the traffic was impossible.<eos> Finally had to get out of the cab and walk.<eos> My apologies.<eos> Not at all.
Well, I guess it's better than being called a bitch.<eos> You've sat down with a few Presidents, I imagine.<eos> - Three or four.<eos> - Any of them face anything like I'm facing right now?<eos> Not like this.
Copy that.<eos> Clear.<eos> Sir, I thought you might want to see this.<eos> When was this taken?<eos> 30 seconds ago.
Sit, sit.<eos> We're not going anywhere.<eos> Not now anyway.<eos> Is there a problem, Saul?<eos> No, no problem.
I was hoping for the same reason I am.<eos> I sincerely doubt that.<eos> We did some good work together.<eos> What's wrong with wanting to preserve that?<eos> Nothing.
Well, I need some straight talk now.<eos> That's why I'm here.<eos> As far as you know, is there a concerted effort to get me to withdraw my support for the nuclear agreement?<eos> Undoubtedly yes.<eos> By whom?
Move, move, move!<eos> We're taking too much fire!<eos> This is where it gets good.<eos> We got two down!<eos> Out of the way!
We got two down!<eos> Out of the way!<eos> Get out of my fucking way!<eos> Meet Andrew Keane, the only son of the President-elect.<eos> Out of the way!
Then why not ask him about it?<eos> He'd rather I didn't know.<eos> Can you get into his computer?<eos> No.<eos> Not even for Quinn?
Not mine, anyway.<eos> Well, they're out in the open now, thanks to you.<eos> Excuse me, ma'am.<eos> - The protest has grown in front of the hotel. We can go in the back.<eos> No, the front.
Tell me about it.<eos> What is so special about February 7th, huh?<eos> That's the first time I got shot.<eos> That's why it's so funny.<eos> "February 7, 2014."
There's gonna be somebody I can talk to to...<eos> Yes, of course.<eos> I'll find someone.<eos> She didn't deserve this, okay?<eos> - Any of it.
There it is above the left renal artery.<eos> Needle driver.<eos> Ready for the surgical version of the 100-meter dash?<eos> - Whew. - 1 minute 40 seconds left.<eos> So... about that ring.
- Hey. What's going on?<eos> - I can explain.<eos> - I was following a hunch, and I think Dr. Dustiny...<eos> I mean, Dustiny...<eos> Dustin...
Hey, whoa. Oh, jeez.<eos> Come in!<eos> Am I interrupting?<eos> - No, no.<eos> - Kind of.
Name your stakes.<eos> Give me a consult.<eos> Anything.<eos> I don't have anything.<eos> What about that guy?
Genuinely happy.<eos> With a woman that I really like.<eos> And I lost a patient today... a sweet girl whose luck ran out.<eos> This isn't what arrived is supposed to feel like.<eos> Good night.
Leslie Claret. Of course. What about him?<eos> This is Leslie Claret.<eos> You are Leslie Claret?<eos> A million years ago. Founder of Galvanized United.<eos> A million years ago.
Yes.<eos> You loved being stabbed in the leg in Luxembourg? No.<eos> Not that part. What part?<eos> Just... the castles and stuff.<eos> Cold one, Leslie?
I can't... Holy shit. What...<eos> Jesus. Audrey McClaren.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Would you write the following on a page of paper for me?<eos> 77 de Champlaine.
For whatever pain he was suffering.<eos> Honey, he wanted to suffer.<eos> He settled for the pillar only after we got arrested trying to crucify him.<eos> I got one nail in before those fuckers had me in cuffs.<eos> For country, my ass.
You're jealous.<eos> That's okay.<eos> It's hard to acknowledge my genius idea.<eos> Boy, is it?<eos> - Ready?
Hey, George, listen.<eos> Tell me, how do I know the name Mark Linn-Baker?<eos> The "Perfect Strangers" guy?<eos> Who?<eos> The sitcom.
They're incinerating them.<eos> They will call you on this with a formal invitation and instructions.<eos> All you have to do is answer it.<eos> And this is a digital record of the people who have gone through.<eos> 119 testimonials.
- Yes, I can do that.<eos> - Excellent.<eos> We'll see you then.<eos> - Who was that?<eos> - Work.
I want you to get the fuck off my property and...<eos> What the...?<eos> Jesus, Florence!<eos> He wasn't coming.<eos> What the fuck?
I am Kevin, Totem of the Bush Snake.<eos> I've come a long way to find you.<eos> You're scared.<eos> I am, yes.<eos> Of what?
Buddy, they didn't take most of us.<eos> You're not alone, trust me.<eos> But that was seven years ago.<eos> Would you kill a baby if it would cure cancer?<eos> What?
Are you all alone out here?<eos> Yes.<eos> Your family's gone?<eos> Yes.<eos> On the 14th?
I knew what it was the moment it happened.<eos> The Rapture.<eos> I finally made it home the next night.<eos> I already knew the chapel would be empty before I stepped foot inside.<eos> Their Bibles...
I finally made it home the next night.<eos> I already knew the chapel would be empty before I stepped foot inside.<eos> Their Bibles...<eos> Liam's, Abigail's,<eos> David's, Samantha's,
Margery Prentiss.<eos> There's five Margery Prentisses.<eos> I need a DOB.<eos> What was her birthday?<eos> March 17th.
I was married to Kevin for 15 years.<eos> He used to look through all of our cupboards before he found the wine glasses, he has a tattoo that's misspelled, and he shits four times a day.<eos> So, I refuse, Matt, to believe that he's the goddamn second coming of Christ!<eos> What are those?<eos> For my allergies.
Hey, fuck you, Matt.<eos> - Come on, man.<eos> - Sorry. Four tickets.<eos> How long is the journey there?<eos> 11 hours.
- Sorry. Four tickets.<eos> How long is the journey there?<eos> 11 hours.<eos> Okay, okay.<eos> 11 hours.
He found peace.<eos> He thinks his daughter's still alive.<eos> That's not peace.<eos> What?<eos> Nothing.
Why don't you, uh, transform those ropes into serpents and free yourself?<eos> I don't need to do that.<eos> You're going to untie me once you get what you want.<eos> And what is it I want?<eos> My attention.
To ease their suffering even though I suffered myself.<eos> I sacrificed my happiness.<eos> - I let my family abandon me.<eos> - Why?<eos> For you!
Thomas.<eos> Doubting Thomas.<eos> When I first started hearing voices back in Mapleton, everyone around me told me I was fucking nuts.<eos> Everyone.<eos> Except you.
I threw it in a sewer grate and then went back for it.<eos> Don't tell Jill that.<eos> That's nothing.<eos> I killed her hamster.<eos> - You what?
What do you want?<eos> I wanna be cremated.<eos> You got it.<eos> No problem.
What happened is your wife fucking drugged us, talked him out of it.<eos> Now the goddamn flood's coming, and we're all gonna fucking die.<eos> - His horse is here. - Huh?<eos> - His horse is here.<eos> - What?
So, let's get assassinating, shall we?<eos> Who's the target?<eos> President.<eos> - The president?<eos> - Of the United States.
Yes.<eos> Do you know that I'm not the President of the United States?<eos> I sure do.<eos> I have a message for you from your father.<eos> My father?
Do you know that I'm not the President of the United States?<eos> I sure do.<eos> I have a message for you from your father.<eos> My father?<eos> John.
Yeah.<eos> Identity confirmed.<eos> Excellent.<eos> Now your penis, please, sir.<eos> - My what?
It's an ethical deterrent.<eos> The nuclear launch key was surgically embedded into the heart of a volunteer.<eos> In order for the president to be able to blow up millions of people with the push of a button, he has to extract that key by murdering the volunteer himself.<eos> But since I don't see that volunteer here, you can't launch shit.<eos> What?
They wanna cut me open.<eos> Do you think I don't know that?<eos> Well, if you knew that, why the fuck wouldn't you tell me?<eos> Because I'm covering my asset.<eos> - What asset?
The president is in the situation room.<eos> It's in lockdown, but the code is 6969.<eos> And please make sure you fucking kill the Secretary of Defense.<eos> - Where's the comms room?<eos> - What?
You just walk to it.<eos> You may experience nausea or discomfort as you pass by the undulating laser array while it cycles up.<eos> Do not touch the array.<eos> Step inside the event chamber, close the exit port behind you, and turn the latch to the left.<eos> Hard to the left.
Without structure, disorder is only to be expected.<eos> Now, you will begin... with men that you know and trust.<eos> And from there, you will begin to reorganize your crews as quickly as possible.<eos> Crews?<eos> With no ships?
Does anyone know where she is?<eos> All right. Grab some men. Set about finding her.<eos> She's not in the fort.<eos> She couldn't have gotten very far.<eos> And Billy?
Why are they still in chains?<eos> We freed the ones that understood we came as friends here, not as enemies.<eos> But some, it seemed, bore us ill will over some of the consequences of our victory here.<eos> You have to know, it is important to ask to repair the alliance between Captain Flint's people and ours.<eos> Important to me.
Important to me.<eos> After you fled, the pirates sent warnings to the other estates that... any violence done to the slaves in their possession for what happened here would be answered.<eos> The next morning, an answer was left by the gate.<eos> A sack filled with fingers.<eos> White fingers.
There may be ways of severing oneself in that way... sacrificing one part to save the other.<eos> I honestly couldn't find something sharp enough to make the cut.<eos> What would have been enough?<eos> I truly am sorry.<eos> For all of it.
Make it quick.<eos> I'm on a horse.<eos> Are they in the mail yet?<eos> I'm sorry, who is this?<eos> What?
Everyone just vapes each other now.<eos> And you weren't able to find time in your day to go buy a pen at one of New Jersey's many fine peneries?<eos> Yeah, I'm just too busy... hitting a floating tambourine while my other hand gets a manicure.<eos> Also, I'll have you know, I'm applying to college.<eos> Without a pen?
Titus Andromedon.<eos> I bet he's never heard of you either, lady!<eos> I mean, cool, cool. The '70s...<eos> Let's schedule him first up and, have a nice selection of pastries for him.<eos> Nothing with fruit.
A friend, but he didn't like this country.<eos> I started saying that stuff because I thought that was what he wanted to hear... just to keep talking to someone.<eos> But it wasn't real.<eos> Not for me, Drew.<eos> Never for me.
I started saying that stuff because I thought that was what he wanted to hear... just to keep talking to someone.<eos> But it wasn't real.<eos> Not for me, Drew.<eos> Never for me.<eos> None of it?
What's that look?<eos> - What look?<eos> - The look, right there.<eos> The one you get when you worry.<eos> Nothing. Nah.
Yours.<eos> How is that possible?<eos> Can you see where the file was accessed from?<eos> Yeah.<eos> A computer in your husband's campaign headquarters.
That makes us brothers.<eos> No matter what he's done.<eos> You asked me to remotely erase the memory.<eos> I ran a locate on Malik and Rashid's phones.<eos> Also their guys, huh?
Smile.<eos> _<eos> I so appreciate you coming.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> No problem.
I want to start us off on the right foot.<eos> Royo says wait till we see the product.<eos> If we're gonna sit here, do we have to watch this?<eos> I hear that.<eos> What the hell? !
We need to hit her hard, get something out of her - we can use.<eos> - Understood.<eos> I want to finish questioning her, Keith.<eos> Right now, I need something else from you.<eos> What?
Let me talk to Andy for a sec.<eos> Okay.<eos> I'll be in the conference room setting up.<eos> Andy, can you pull all the files on the Alexandria attacks?<eos> Ye, no problem.
Think about what you're doing, now.<eos> - Don't you realize...<eos> - ...at the NSA, to see if CTU...<eos> I did it for you.<eos> For me?
- Take him downstairs.<eos> - No. No, Isaac! Isaac, no!<eos> No, please!<eos> Please...<eos> Please, Isaac!
There were rumors he trained in Pakistan.<eos> That he wasn't alone.<eos> You were there with him.<eos> Tell me what you're doing here.<eos> Nothing.
That's not true.<eos> That's not true.<eos> Gabriel, this deal will net many times that.<eos> Look, I won't take a cut.<eos> Not a penny.
We'll find them.<eos> But we had them.<eos> I had them!<eos> I found them.<eos> For you.
- Khasan, no.<eos> - To the end.<eos> Khasan, no.<eos> You understand me?<eos> To the end.
No!<eos> A large explosion on the George Washington Bridge that crosses the Hudson River...<eos> This is the work of one cell.<eos> There are 14 more cells, and they must strike as one.<eos> But without the flash drive...
It's not like them to send us off on our own so unexpectedly.<eos> Certainly, I wish I could go back and change the history of the Baudelaires at this very moment rather than the descent into misery, tribulation and... dire inconvenience which will occur shortly.<eos> It only seems scary because of all the mist.<eos> It's Mr. Poe.<eos> From the bank?
Goodbye, Sunny.<eos> I hope you'll be happy here. I'll still check in on you occasionally.<eos> If you need anything or have questions, you can reach me at the bank.<eos> Well, children, before I give you a tour of your new home, aren't you going to say "How do you do?"<eos> to your new guardian?
There's only one bed.<eos> As you can see, I have provided, at no cost to you, this complimentary pile of rocks.<eos> Thoughts?<eos> Thoughts?<eos> First of all...
Remember, if you work extra hard, you get to go to the ball... room... which is even grimier.<eos> Hang on to your toothbrushes.<eos> You'll need them for your teeth.<eos> Stay here.<eos> And not a peep.
- Now is not a good time.<eos> - They're in one of their moods.<eos> They seemed so sweet.<eos> Do you have children, Justice Strauss?<eos> Me?
I meant "bed" as in "more than one bed," obviously.<eos> The plural of "bed" is... "bed."<eos> Well, I wouldn't know.<eos> I live alone.<eos> No kidding.
And I think Mom would be proud of how you made your own pasta.<eos> Maybe we can make this our home after all.<eos> Remember what Father said when he burnt the quesadillas?<eos> Yeah.<eos> "Better than nothing."
- Are you all right?<eos> - No.<eos> - This isn't.<eos> - What?<eos> Better than nothing.
There will be no resistance to their landing since...<eos> Since Woodes Rogers was the one who invited them in.<eos> How did you know that?<eos> Captain!<eos> Sails!
She's breathing.<eos> How are you?<eos> In St. Ann's Bay, we can agree that there are two 10-pound guns on the beach.<eos> And men-at-arms number at least 80.<eos> No more than 100.
Jack.<eos> I heard you.<eos> Go see what kind of surgeon you can engage for Anne.<eos> I'll... do this.<eos> What?
I'll... do this.<eos> What?<eos> It's somehow only just occurred to me how ruined we'll be if I fail to win the man on the other side of that door to our cause.<eos> No home.<eos> No cache.
I heard a story that Jack Rackham outsmarted Captain Flint to capture a Spanish treasure galleon right out from under him.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Knew him, too.<eos> And believe it or not, that story is true.<eos> What about Charles Vane?
It was a little more complicated than that.<eos> I heard... he sometimes butchered his enemies for amusement, made stew of their flesh.<eos> He was truly an animal.<eos> Stew?<eos> For what possible...
I got this job in the bag.<eos> - Sounds good.<eos> - Thanks, 'rents!<eos> Hey there, Bender.<eos> Huh?
Okay, I don't like it any more than you do, but those are the rules.<eos> And unless you have a way around the National Collegiate Athletic Association, we are stuck here.<eos> Do you remember...<eos> Richie Sutter?<eos> Pitcher for the Cards, yeah.
- Right here.<eos> In the living room.<eos> We didn't want to wait any longer and I've never wanted a big wedding anyway.<eos> And we're gonna have a chuppah with... because Lily is Jewish, of course.<eos> - Nothing fancy.
Hey. What's the line on Arsenal?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Okay.<eos> Put me down for the same as last time.<eos> Yeah, ten grand.
She's already at anchor.<eos> Looks like she's been waiting for us.<eos> It looks like she knew where to wait for us.<eos> Jesus Christ!<eos> On their rail!
You told her no?<eos> She needs for there to be a man in the governor's office, not Jack.<eos> A man of her choosing, and she wants me to be his wife.<eos> His wife? !<eos> In name only and for appearance's sake, nothing more.
A man of her choosing, and she wants me to be his wife.<eos> His wife? !<eos> In name only and for appearance's sake, nothing more.<eos> The power would rest with us.<eos> Just for appearance?
Practice.<eos> All warfare is the same.<eos> Two questions are of paramount importance... who was my opponent yesterday, and who is he today?<eos> Answer those two questions, and there is very little he can... hide from you.<eos> What?
He dragged it here.<eos> Should we fetch Mr. Hands?<eos> We should head back.<eos> You sailed with Avery.<eos> Long time ago.
- Are your men ready? - They are, my Lord.<eos> Then we move now.<eos> Ready the launches.<eos> - Any sign of them?<eos> Nor the chest, nor any trail for either.
Lay our attention on the latter.<eos> Hey, the hold's on fire!<eos> What happened?<eos> Men in the water!<eos> Launches in the water!
- I'm okay.<eos> - You sure?<eos> - Uh, I'm okay.<eos> Are you all right?<eos> Yeah.
- Oh, yeah.<eos> He'll have a beer,<eos> - and I'll...<eos> - A beer?<eos> How about this 50-year-old Scotch over there?
Yeah.<eos> International money laundering.<eos> Big scale.<eos> Oh, you're good.<eos> How big?
Jonas.<eos> Oh, my God, it's so good.<eos> Mm. She used to own a restaurant.<eos> Down in Busan.<eos> Nothing fancy.
Sir!<eos> Stop it right there! Sir!<eos> Sir, stop!<eos> Please exit the building!<eos> Ready for me?
- I'll go say hello.<eos> Be right back.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - You okay?<eos> - Yeah, fine.
Hi!<eos> Hi.<eos> Why bathrooms?<eos> How are you?<eos> Fine.
- Yes, she is.<eos> - What?<eos> Or at least I'm hoping she is.<eos> You know, Vincent mentioned that you had a few legal issues.<eos> Uh, nothing serious.
We need to know where these pictures were taken.<eos> Do you know where these pictures were taken?<eos> Um... somewhere in California.<eos> The woman in the picture was important to the story.<eos> And to him.
Go.<eos> Go clear your name.<eos> You and your imaginary friends.<eos> And when you find your brother, pound him a few times for me.<eos> - Yeah, me too. - Mm!
Best part of the week.<eos> - Sadly, we have to head home now.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Bye.<eos> - Good evening.
- Sadly, we have to head home now.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Bye.<eos> - Good evening.<eos> Bye, Mum.
- Let me guess, the sensitive brother.<eos> - Lifelong bachelor.<eos> - But at least he doesn't die from AIDS.<eos> - So he does die.<eos> Drug overdose.
This is prison for an actor.<eos> I'm trapped here not because of what I did, but because of who I am.<eos> This is painful enough to think about.<eos> But worse... is facing the idea that... there may be no way out of it.<eos> What the fuck?
But worse... is facing the idea that... there may be no way out of it.<eos> What the fuck?<eos> What?<eos> It's Lito.<eos> What the fuck?
is one of the voices in your head?<eos> - Shh!<eos> Bug! - Right.<eos> Sorry. Shh!<eos> All good.
You speak Spanish?<eos> The language of love is the Bug's native tongue.<eos> I thought that was French.<eos> Love this part.<eos> "No more lies."

Right now, all we can offer you is a little... invisibility.<eos> E-Death.<eos> If you accept this offer, there may come a day when we ask something of you.<eos> What?<eos> Nothing venal, vile or vainglorious.
That's his choice.<eos> Maybe it will work out for Sebastian, maybe it won't.<eos> What I'm going to make sure is that it works out for me.<eos> Hm. - And maybe...<eos> - Me.
Not tonight we don't.<eos> When I'm with you... all the rules... and the logic of everyday life... things that were so important to me... all go away.<eos> And all I feel... is how fast my heart beats... whenever I'm with you.<eos> Are you sure?<eos> Not too bad for a machine, huh?
- Thank you.<eos> There is a schedule of events in your packet.<eos> Okay.<eos> The parade kicks off after your address.<eos> My address?
Another visitor?<eos> Did the blockers wear off early?<eos> Take your complaint to the FDA, mate.<eos> - It's Puck.<eos> - From the lab?
But lucky you seem to already have yours, the latest ones with less side effects.<eos> Seems like somebody might have a friend at BPO.<eos> Wait.<eos> Blockers aren't gonna keep you safe forever, Riley Blue.<eos> Not from BPO.
Seems like somebody might have a friend at BPO.<eos> Wait.<eos> Blockers aren't gonna keep you safe forever, Riley Blue.<eos> Not from BPO.<eos> And not from me.
These are the last year reports from the controller general.<eos> Yeah, you can just put them there.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - You're welcome.<eos> About last night...
I know you want to tell her to fuck off, but we need information.<eos> You use blockers.<eos> Everyone does.<eos> - Where do you get them from?<eos> - My contact.
That's the most fun I've had in my entire life.<eos> That's what you told me once.<eos> Joaquin, what are you doing here?<eos> I wanted nothing to do with you.<eos> Nothing.
I imagined myself shooting the men who killed him many times.<eos> But you never did.<eos> No.<eos> Why?<eos> My mother.
No.<eos> It is a test.<eos> They need to know that I'm alone.<eos> No.<eos> Five minutes.
Lito, don't do it.<eos> Don't forget that every bite is the equivalent of 20 minutes on the treadmill.<eos> We're actors.<eos> Rejection is nine-tenths of our job.<eos> What job?
No.<eos> No.<eos> Without what lies?<eos> In the movie.<eos> Too many lies.
What are we watching?<eos> From Here to Eternity.<eos> Ooh! Scoot, scoot.<eos> - It's Stella's favorite film.<eos> - Your mom?
You mean he's gay?<eos> Exactly.<eos> Which would naturally create some complex insecurities: wanting to do and be everything that a heteronormative icon such as Burt Lancaster was able to do and be... but knowing that it was not possible.<eos> Yeah, but he's gonna do more.<eos> Way more.
I hate being... controlled and forced to make deals and compromises I don't want to make.<eos> What are we gonna do?<eos> The killers could be anywhere.<eos> We need access to the restaurant computer.<eos> How without Nomi?
We want the dirt!<eos> Everybody thinks Teagan is really nice, but it's not true.<eos> She isn't nice.<eos> She's super nice.<eos> Like, sickeningly nice.
You know, Bitta... when your father first brought me to Bombay...<eos> I was terrified of these streets.<eos> I remember the first time I went out, I got lost.<eos> It was so different from where I grew up.<eos> So busy and noisy.
I didn't have an agent at the beginning of my career.<eos> I didn't let that stop me.<eos> Hernando, please.<eos> Dani, I think Lito needs a little bit of time.<eos> - Fifty-eight minutes.
- Fifty-eight minutes.<eos> - It's not about 58 minutes.<eos> Just give me 58 minutes.<eos> Can you bring a timer?<eos> Fifty-eight minutes.
I thought about it a lot.<eos> I read the articles, both fact and fiction.<eos> I won't lie.<eos> It hurt.<eos> Especially the stuff about my sister.
Cops are shutting down the area.<eos> Oh, it's a road block.<eos> Oh, shit.<eos> Shit!<eos> Out of my way!
It's only bearable because the alternative is not.<eos> We need to talk.<eos> You've been hiding?<eos> It's difficult for me in Berlin right now.<eos> Because of Lila?
The future I hope for is the same as yours.<eos> A future where our children grow up never knowing love as a wall... but only as a bridge.<eos> Please.<eos> Please.<eos> Please. Please, no violence. Please.
- You won't stop with this.<eos> - Come on.<eos> - That was no heart attack.<eos> - Who had a heart attack?<eos> - Clemenza.
OPR.<eos> And not just here for a regular review or you would have set up an appointment.<eos> Correct.<eos> We are quite comfortable not giving advance warning in cases like this.<eos> Mm-hmm. And what sort of...
Performance.<eos> That's a loaded word.<eos> Scary.<eos> Lot of pressure.<eos> Not for me.
So I'm too young?<eos> You're getting that?<eos> Too green.<eos> It'll go to an old hand like one of you two, then?<eos> "Experienced", not "old".
Oh, the cheat was very well executed.<eos> I was about to go across the table at him.<eos> To make sure he was banned from the park, to exact retribution.<eos> But then in an instant, I saw... this was the chance to re-frame my entire approach.<eos> So instead...
Uh-huh. But...<eos> Then I become aware of a payment.<eos> A payment?<eos> That your wife received.<eos> From Axelrod.
That your wife received.<eos> From Axelrod.<eos> An account of hers that you're a signer on.<eos> Right around, uh, well, hell, right on the day that you suspended your investigation into him.<eos> $5 million.
Hey, guys!<eos> Here I come!<eos> This place gave me my first real look at how the world worked.<eos> I watched people running toward the betting window with high hopes.<eos> No plan.
Come on.<eos> Thanks.<eos> You've been served.<eos> With a lawsuit.<eos> One-hundred and twenty-seven of them.
Uh, yes.<eos> Noelle, meet Emmett.<eos> Ballsy move offering up your skin to a rookie.<eos> He says thank you for letting us use your shop.<eos> No problem.
Thank you so much for your support.<eos> It means a lot.<eos> Thank you so much.<eos> Okay, yeah.<eos> Bye-bye.
Thank you.<eos> Governor Conway and I are honored to be here with the Miller family and their closest friends.<eos> I know the VFW was a big part of Jim's life here in Knoxville.<eos> With the help of Homeland and our hotline, we think that Masterson has crossed into the southwest corner of Virginia.<eos> Scott or Washington.
I promised you and your daughter that I would...<eos> Leave her alone.<eos> Well, perhaps we should speak when you're feeling a little more up to it.<eos> I don't want to hear you.<eos> Or from you.
Promise me.<eos> All right.<eos> So... I wait for Grandma to go out on her daily rounds.<eos> I walk in. I ask Grandpa for a bond for...<eos> - For Preston James Collins III.
- We don't want any verrucas.<eos> - Hello.<eos> - One for the ladies slipper baths, love?<eos> - Yes, please.<eos> A touch more hot water, please.
I know you do.<eos> Two weeks.<eos> It's not our Joan.<eos> Not to keep us in the dark like this.<eos> Not a word.
I'm here in an official capacity.<eos> Not seen much of you since the Wessex raid.<eos> When are you gonna give me the inside story?<eos> I'm sure you've spoken to everybody else.<eos> All bar you and Inspector Thursday's daughter.
He could've injured himself earlier in the evening.<eos> Slow subdural haemorrhage.<eos> He comes for a swim, pressure builds on the cerebral cortex and good night, Vienna.<eos> Give you the definitive prix fixe once I've had a rootle.<eos> Gentlemen...
He's been going there since he was a boy, sir.<eos> A lot of his friends from school were always getting in trouble with the law.<eos> - I mean, nothing serious.<eos> - No, sir.<eos> Nothing serious.
Dr Amory.<eos> This cigarette case that you gave Dr Nielsen...<eos> It was his birthday.<eos> I just wanted to do something nice for him.<eos> Nothing more than that?
We'll have every nutcase and lunatic in Oxford to claim responsibility and no way to sort the wheat from the chaff.<eos> Tessa!<eos> Come here.<eos> This story, where did you get it?<eos> Straight from the horse's mouth.
- Go home to bed.<eos> - That long, you reckon?<eos> You could get lucky, but you're unlikely to get much back before morning.<eos> JASON will be thinking for quite a while.<eos> Good night.
Hello?<eos> Three in the..... Binsey area.<eos> Ashcourt, Ashton and Leighton-Asbury.<eos> - Well, sorry to have troubled you, Mrs Ashcourt.<eos> - No problem.
Should I go on, sir?<eos> Get down the station and type up a translation as quick as you can.<eos> Sir.<eos> Garden backs onto the Cherwell.<eos> Nothing down there but some old boathouse.
- Well, I'm a scientist.<eos> I don't go in for God.<eos> But that man was a miracle worker.<eos> Where were you last night?<eos> For the record.
- Where's who?<eos> Miss Frazil.<eos> I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> - What have you done with her?<eos> - Nothing.
He must know we've found the house in Binsey.<eos> What about the boat house where his sister drowned?<eos> - What's his motive?<eos> - Miss Palfrey he knew as a child.<eos> Same as Edison Smalls.
Something.<eos> Just get the kids and I'll see you there in a couple hours.<eos> Okay.<eos> We'll check it and be back tomorrow.<eos> No beef.
- Yeah, beat it.<eos> Two minutes.<eos> - Mom.<eos> - Bram.<eos> No contact.
Have fun storming the castle!<eos> What... what castle?<eos> Yeah!<eos> You get the credit card, and you swipe it through there, and then...<eos> Drugs!
No, but...<eos> Yo, his skin be going all gray like he's cloudy and overcast.<eos> Please.<eos> For you.<eos> Not for him.
I don't know.<eos> Didn't your assistant pack everything up?<eos> Right.<eos> Move outta the way.<eos> Nothing.
Tell the committee Pilgrim's landed on Plymouth Rock.<eos> The Mars samples are safe and sound.<eos> Copy that, Commander.<eos> Congratulations.<eos> Ready?
Minus 17.<eos> Zero degrees.<eos> Come on.<eos> Eighteen... Nineteen... 20 degrees Celsius.<eos> Nothing.
Nothing.<eos> Update?<eos> I'm gonna try a different atmosphere.<eos> Closer to Proterozoic Earth than today's Mars.<eos> Less oxygen...
Update?<eos> I'm gonna try a different atmosphere.<eos> Closer to Proterozoic Earth than today's Mars.<eos> Less oxygen...<eos> More carbon dioxide.
- Go ahead.<eos> - How do you go to the bathroom?<eos> Funnel, tube, and some suction.<eos> Everything we do on the ISS is like everything you do on Earth.<eos> Except different.
I don't hate my chair.<eos> I love it.<eos> For the sake of the anonymous genius who invented it.<eos> You're one of a kind, Hugh.<eos> Good night.
So let's all agree we made our first and last mistake.<eos> I miss my fucking dog.<eos> Good night.<eos> Dr. Miranda North, quarantine officer, 2320 UTC.<eos> After weeks of stunning growth and activity,
I've got to jump.<eos> - Kat, the tether won't reach.<eos> - I'm unclipping.<eos> - Kat?<eos> - No comments!
Good evening.<eos> We'd like a room.<eos> Where are you folks from?<eos> New York City.<eos> New York City.
John.<eos> Ellie.<eos> How are you?<eos> Good.<eos> Oh, Zelda.
I mean, what... what if he found something?<eos> What if he found, uh, a spell or a piece of, I don't know, Fillorian Battle Magic that was so strong that he couldn't do it without... - Yeah, because the... okay, the thing is, this is, uh,<eos> December, 1944.<eos> I mean, he shows up right in the middle of the...<eos> Battle of the Bulge.
Two cars... Houses... Property valuation, bills and all of that.<eos> You have pretty large pension savings, huh?<eos> And... Oh, not bad. All in all...<eos> Yes! - 2.5 for each.<eos> - Thousand?
What the hell are you doing?<eos> - Where did you find her again?<eos> - She had a website. - A website?<eos> - Yeah, to do with euthanasia.<eos> - Euthanasia?
How slowly would you like it to happen?<eos> How slow?<eos> Now, this will leave them bleeding for several hours before their eyes pop out of their heads.<eos> It's quite painful, it must be said.<eos> Meanwhile, now this one...
- Everything's going to be okay.<eos> I just need some wine.<eos> What a surprise. - When do you expect to finish it?<eos> - We found a pile of bricks. And more are on the way from...<eos> From Krakow.
It tastes perfectly cooked.<eos> Mind if I take a seat?<eos> What do you think?<eos> Who has cuter cheeks?<eos> - Me.
That's from Pino.<eos> A piece of tile?<eos> It's Black Galaxy tile.<eos> It's so black.<eos> From me.
Whiskey.<eos> I'll get you some ginger ale.<eos> I take it straight.<eos> How do you feel about free love?<eos> Free love?
- Where's the power source?<eos> - Basement.<eos> Hey, Germany, you need to listen to me very carefully.<eos> I want you to call me back on this channel.<eos> - In 30 seconds.
Good.<eos> Unlock him, please.<eos> My associate, Becca.<eos> What did you tell the police?<eos> Nothing.
Knowing what we now know from the surviving gunmen?<eos> - Which is?<eos> - I already covered that.<eos> One more time.<eos> Just for me.
- No team. This is on me.<eos> - That's insane.<eos> Just tell me you're putting your daughter in a car right now.<eos> - Okay, fine.<eos> - No buts.
You're not at Langley anymore.<eos> Mills just told him his daughter's life is in danger and he's more worried about Mills than he is about her?<eos> He's on the move again.<eos> Aah! Bryan...<eos> "K"?
Here, here, here.<eos> I'm good, I'm good, I'm good.<eos> No, no, just take on of these for the pain, all right?<eos> You really think Zack was gonna kill her, don't you?<eos> No doubt whatsoever.
Thanks.<eos> Dr. Hodgins here has got some questions for you.<eos> Zack, look at me.<eos> Angela found the e-mails that you sent.<eos> The ones in Dr. Bancroft's name.
So we've got nothing.<eos> I wanted to see how Zack was doing.<eos> Uh, it's been a couple of hours.<eos> He's been poring through the evidence like a machine.<eos> - So no admission of guilt?
- So no admission of guilt?<eos> - No.<eos> He's been nothing but professional.<eos> Calm, collected; all Dr. Jekyll.<eos> No sign of Mr. Hyde.
Draws a much bigger crowd.<eos> Although, the splat is far more indecorous.<eos> To wit, Martin Baxter's high dive of Holder Hall.<eos> Where's the trade off, then? Hm?<eos> Dealer's choice.
I worry that I'll never do anything of import, for I'm much too lazy to care whether a thing is done or not.<eos> All I truly want is to be young always, and to feel that my life is my own.<eos> Tildy says the people of New York all have different kind of accents.<eos> The likes of which she's never heard.<eos> Plenty of different accents around here.
- He speaks.<eos> - Excuse me?<eos> What do Chesterfields have to do with teeth?<eos> Dentists recommend them.<eos> For what, stains?
Oh, death is so beautiful.<eos> So very beautiful.<eos> We will die together.<eos> I know.<eos> Out of a row of Confederated soldiers...
Sister Ursula, are we allowed to know where the television set has gone?<eos> Suffice to say, it is now in a place where it will be enjoyed.<eos> I had the police call round the gym.<eos> Acting all matey.<eos> The police!
I never know whether it's cos you're clever, or cos you're just a coward.<eos> Coward?<eos> Coward?<eos> Cowards don't do this, do they?<eos> Or this.
Coward?<eos> Coward?<eos> Cowards don't do this, do they?<eos> Or this.<eos> Or this!
But they're my kids.<eos> Why should I apply for anything?<eos> Because they are your husband's children, too.<eos> You could be construed as having a history of mental instability, and he has certain rights.<eos> What about Mrs Watts' rights?
For being brusque and not telling you why.<eos> And for something else which may never happen, but if it does... .. it's going to hurt us both so much.<eos> What?<eos> I've had a letter from Hong Kong.<eos> - From your father?

The paramedics think he died of natural causes.<eos> He had a history of heart problems.<eos> Heart attack?<eos> Six months ago.<eos> No sign of any injuries or any kind of struggle.
Dying up here in the middle of the night, all alone.<eos> That's not a way to go, is it?<eos> Ah, no, JP, no, it is not.<eos> What time was sunset?<eos> Just after seven?
But he... he must've done.<eos> My thought exactly.<eos> But, yet, he didn't.<eos> Where do you keep your torches here?<eos> By the main entrance.
Stephen's death may not have been natural causes.<eos> Who might our suspects be?<eos> Megan Colley.<eos> 22.<eos> From Dublin.
Well, the speculative diagnosis, based on the fact that Stephen Langham had a heart attack six months ago, is that he died of heart failure.<eos> So, it was natural causes?<eos> Not necessarily, Dwayne.<eos> There is no actual evidence of a further heart attack having occurred yesterday.<eos> No clot, no scarring.
Calls to and from the victim's phone seem to match with friends and family.<eos> But the call list from the observatory landline did show up something.<eos> This number here has been called several times the last few nights.<eos> It's pay-as-you go, so no registered user, but look at the times.<eos> 2am, 4am.
Mayor Richards has an offshore bank account in Guadeloupe.<eos> That's why he was there yesterday.<eos> He made a cash withdrawal.<eos> How much?<eos> Four million Eastern Caribbean dollars.
I mean, the guy made robots that helped autistic kids.<eos> So he said.<eos> Guys like Ian always claim that they're trying to save the world, but the only thing they care about is selling out to the highest bidder.<eos> Do you know how many<eos> "amazing scientific discoveries"
That's one of the many benefits of growing older.<eos> We grow wiser in the process.<eos> I'm really gonna miss you, Dr. Brennan.<eos> I'm gonna miss all of you.<eos> Champagne...
I can give you until morning.<eos> I need more time than tha... morning.<eos> That's it.<eos> Tell me we found something - that links Cyrus with Mcclintock.<eos> - Nothing yet.
- You'll see behind me that a massive candlelight vigil is under way, the number of people growing by the minute...<eos> No appearance yet by Cyrus Beene or by the hospital staff, who remain tight-lipped about President-elect Vargas' condition...<eos> All we can do now is pray.<eos> We went through all 832 voicemails on the FBI tip line.<eos> No leads.
This was his plan from the very beginning.<eos> And while we're here doing nothing, he is in that Pennsylvania hospital room, launching a full-scale Presidential campaign!<eos> Huddling with advisors, reaching out to delegates, practicing his speeches!<eos> He murdered his way into the White House, and we are doing nothing to stop him!<eos> Nothing!
Then you know what you have to do.<eos> Frankie Vargas was a good man.<eos> Honorable.<eos> His family's loss is the country's loss.<eos> And yours.

Get in here!<eos> So nice to meet you.<eos> (squeaks)<eos> Um, perhaps you should refrain from the bear hugs, sweetheart.<eos> Oh, no bear hugs.
No one's expecting you to take it all in overnight.<eos> But believe me, I've been all around the world and it doesn't get any better than this.<eos> This castle, our friends, your family, each other.<eos> What else could you possibly want?<eos> Nothing.
Rapunzel, are you in there?<eos> (clears throat)<eos> Is who in there, Eugene?<eos> Huh?<eos> Uh, no one.
Hi, honey.<eos> Oh, hi Mom.<eos> You left so quickly after breakfast I... I didn't have a chance to give this to you.<eos> I know it's a little early for a coronation gift but... I thought you might like to see it now.<eos> 18th of July...

How about a date tonight, model citizen?<eos> A little well-earned love after a long time at sea.<eos> Miss Dorothy.<eos> E-mailing her undying love from Aurora, Illinois.<eos> How about this one?
Yes, Kaniel Outis.<eos> Is he here?<eos> He says, yes, the man in the picture is here and we can see him, but only 'cause we're dealing with Sheba.<eos> Why did you say that name?<eos> Because of my brother's jacket.
Look, it's late.<eos> I have to get up early in the morning.<eos> Right.<eos> - Night.<eos> - Goodnight.
Emily's afraid somebody might be holding a grudge.<eos> But that was a long time ago.<eos> And we're all adults now.<eos> - If there's a conflict..<eos> - No conflict.
You don't have to protect me from Ali.<eos> And if you thought you had to protect Alison from me well, you're not paying attention.<eos> You sure you don't mind driving me home?<eos> Hanna said Mona demanded a command performance.<eos> No problem.
I hadn't said five words to her since Jason was born.<eos> And there she was like any neighbor come to borrow a lawnmower or a husband.<eos> And she started telling me that she had a sister a twin sister, a sister I'd never heard of.<eos> And that's because she, the sister had problems..<eos> Emotional problems.
I, I couldn't stand the thought of that baby.. That child disappearing.<eos> Being swallowed up, forgotten.<eos> I spoke to Judge Kahn..<eos> Arrangements were made.<eos> And after all that..
Not until you know.<eos> Okay, so I just got off the phone with Katherine and she was raving about your dresses.<eos> You killed it, Han.<eos> I already have her committed to wear one of your pieces to an event and one of your pieces while she's out doing normal things.<eos> Not bad for a day's work.
- You have it so wrong.<eos> - I just want my life back.<eos> Okay.<eos> I wanna make something beautiful.<eos> No more snarfing, no more shovels.
No one's gonna let her subvert a hug into...<eos> It's not about that picture.<eos> She's accused you of hitting on her.<eos> - Oh, my God.<eos> - And others.
It's our home.<eos> It's-it's your home.<eos> It's the only home you've ever known.<eos> Well, it feels different now.<eos> Not to me.
- What?<eos> You don't think a chef counts his mushrooms?<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> - Sorry, I forgot to eat lunch.<eos> - No worries.
- Excuse me?<eos> - The dress.<eos> Where did it come from?<eos> - It was a gift.<eos> - From who?
We have an Uber waiting for us.<eos> I thought the police were looking for her.<eos> What is she doing shuffling around in that instead of an orange jumpsuit?<eos> It's all part of the game.<eos> What game?
Excuse me.<eos> - Hello.<eos> Hi. - Hi.<eos> - Do they lock the doors?<eos> - 7:00.
How long is he gonna put off coming home to face me?<eos> - Will you marry me?<eos> - I need a minute.<eos> Jessica had a file on each of us.<eos> Yeah, all of us except Aria.
One sniff, please?<eos> Supposed to do laundry last night but I was out following Sydney until 4 a.m.<eos> - You're fine.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Except for that giant coffee stain.
Sorry I missed the meeting.<eos> Hey, Sal.<eos> Hey, so sorry I'm late.<eos> - What did I miss?<eos> - Not much.
Yeah, last night it didn't...<eos> Didn't seem like Nicole knew that much.<eos> Doctor Rosen is just trying to help her adjust to all the changes in her life as gradually as possible.<eos> But, she knows now.<eos> Everything?
Really leaving?<eos> They want a decision by tomorrow.<eos> When you showed up here in Rosewood, I...<eos> Really thought we're gonna get another chance at this.<eos> At us.
And I don't want to feel those things anymore.<eos> - You don't have to.<eos> - I know I don't.<eos> I can just go somewhere else.<eos> Goodnight.
It's latitude and longitude.<eos> It must lead to the mystery location.<eos> When are you going?<eos> I'll come with you.<eos> After school.
- Why now?<eos> Why are you letting me see who you are?<eos> Because you're desperate and I can use desperate.<eos> You said you want out of the game?<eos> Yes, the game.
Why are you letting me see who you are?<eos> Because you're desperate and I can use desperate.<eos> You said you want out of the game?<eos> Yes, the game.<eos> - All of it.
Because I'd already promised Mary I wouldn't tell anyone she was staying with me.<eos> I was trying to keep my word to an old friend.<eos> I mean that was before.<eos> Before what?<eos> After your visit...
Yeah.<eos> Only I knew her as Charles.<eos> Fifteen years ago, I ran a camp for troubled boys and Charles was one of my campers.<eos> He was... soft-spoken, sweet.<eos> Way smarter than all the other kids.
So far, it only tells us whose turn it is.<eos> What?<eos> like "Simon Says?"<eos> Yeah.<eos> Kind of... but meaner.
Okay now, put it in your left hand give it a good squeeze.<eos> Okay.<eos> One more.<eos> This one's for me, though...<eos> Not the doctors.
- It didn't work the first time.<eos> So now you're sending body parts.<eos> What the hell is she talking about?<eos> If you don't know, why are you so freaked out?<eos> Because of the book.
Alright, we have to find something that will give us an edge.<eos> Drink some decaf, go back to the loft and wait for Emily to come home.<eos> Not much of a plan.<eos> Yeah, well, that's all I've got right now.<eos> Later.
Drink some decaf, go back to the loft and wait for Emily to come home.<eos> Not much of a plan.<eos> Yeah, well, that's all I've got right now.<eos> Later.<eos> Later.
- Yes.<eos> You saw that I was going some place and you followed me?<eos> That's right.<eos> And then you waited outside for an hour?<eos> Fifty-eight minutes.
I'm gonna get to the bottom of this.<eos> I know the police took your phone and I didn't want you to be without especially now that you're on my team.<eos> - It's not enough.<eos> - What's not enough?<eos> The phone.
Where?<eos> It's probably better if you don't know.<eos> Aria?<eos> Wwhat's goin' on?<eos> Nothing.
Alright, break time's over.<eos> Are you any closer to finding the game?<eos> Well, there is no close.<eos> I either find the location or I've got nothing.<eos> So far, nothing.
Someday, maybe we can afford nicer ones.<eos> Maybe a nicer wedding.<eos> No, it's perfect.<eos> I just thought, with everything going on right now we should do this while we still can.<eos> Plus, um...
Previously on "Pretty Little Liars.." No more messengers.<eos> No more gobetweens.
Will you join us?<eos> No, actually, II really can't stay.<eos> Another time then.<eos> So, you as ticked off as I am?<eos> About what?
No, actually, II really can't stay.<eos> Another time then.<eos> So, you as ticked off as I am?<eos> About what?<eos> About Mona.
I am.<eos> I just..<eos> I can't leave the people in it.<eos> My friends need me, and II need them and I can't walk away from my parents right now.<eos> Especially not my mom.
Tomorrow, hon, it's been a wicked long day.<eos> Some of us need our beauty rest.<eos> Could I at least show you on your laptop?<eos> I'll call you tomorrow, okay?<eos> Goodnight.
Intersection...<eos> - 1017...<eos> - Got 'em.<eos> - Thank you so much.<eos> - No problem.
You're smiling.<eos> I just, I didn't think to get you anything.<eos> You're not the one leaving.<eos> It's something for you and Alison.<eos> For Ali and me?
No wonder you didn't want her going down any more holes.<eos> Congratulations.<eos> Thanks.<eos> There is a part of me, though, that, wants to say I'm sorry.<eos> To whom?
For what?<eos> Don't you dare apologize for being with me.<eos> And don't you dare forget it, any of it.<eos> 'Cause I won't.<eos> - "To whom?"
Sure, Michael.<eos> Yeah, let's do that.<eos> Old shipyard.<eos> Warehouse A.<eos> 5:00 p.m. tomorrow.
- Mm-hmm. - World's just better minus them.<eos> Like Abu Ramal.<eos> But for the most part, you know, killing's just bad.<eos> Yeah, absolutely.<eos> Except Poseidon.
Freeze!<eos> Get your hands up!<eos> Go easy, son.<eos> How we doing?<eos> Better than you.
Hot damn it, get some gloves on!<eos> Oh, God.<eos> No.<eos> All three victims shot in the head.<eos> Very little blood.
Until another nightblood ascends, I... king roan of Azgeda, eldest son of Nia, grandson of Theo... Am caretaker of the throne and keeper of the flame.<eos> Until another ascends, Azgeda honors and will defend the coalition of the last true commander...<eos> Lexa kom Trikru, including the 13th clan.<eos> Let it be known that an attack against Skaikru is an attack against us all.<eos> From your king.
Call us if you need anything, and, um... we'll see you soon, okay?<eos> - Be good.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Not too good.<eos> Not perfect.
What you crave is the numbing of the thing that you don't wanna feel.<eos> And we give you a lot of rope here.<eos> It's scary, but only you can decide... to see what's good, to be alive.<eos> - You understand?<eos> - Kind of.
Draw what you know?<eos> - Yeah. - I hear you.<eos> Just keep it for yourself, for now, okay?<eos> Okay.<eos> Good night.
- Yeah.<eos> Emma Stone's kinda fat. Don't you think?<eos> Oh, no, I think she's just big-boned.<eos> She's, like, at least, a size six.<eos> - Anyway, 'night.
"That's when she fainted on the bus."<eos> All right.<eos> And all of my friends, they think that she's some kind of freak.<eos> - Like, a freak who killed a girl.<eos> - Because of the blog?
There goes that fucking excuse again, huh?<eos> Enter.<eos> Hey.<eos> - Hey. - Don't be all pleased with yourself.<eos> Wow.
Or, if you wanna make it legal, you can fill out a form online in about ten minutes.<eos> I was thinking "Ellie."<eos> - Ooh... - That's no good.<eos> No.<eos> How about...
The second you get boobs, it's like open season.<eos> You guys are pretty disgusting that way.<eos> We could at least have some manners about it.<eos> Not rub up against you guys on the bus.<eos> Oh, bus rubbing.
She's very interested in Olive's work and has been... a great comfort to me around your illness.<eos> And she... feels that it would be healing for the both of us if you allowed me to feed you.<eos> - It's rice milk.<eos> I made it myself.<eos> - Like a baby?
Kids loved her.<eos> Did she mention anything unusual?<eos> Any worries?<eos> Any plans to meet someone?<eos> Nothing, no.
They found her this morning.<eos> There you are, love.<eos> - Was it just you and Gemma?<eos> - Since Mam died, yeah.<eos> No other family?
I was hardly in contact with her.<eos> - Had something happened?<eos> - Not really.<eos> We were always very different.<eos> Even as kids.
Could've come to the island from anywhere.<eos> If they even went to the island.<eos> Gemma could've gone to the mainland, met her killer there, and still got washed up on Ternstone.<eos> - I assume there's no sign of this missing boat...<eos> - Nothing.
It's the same with Davy's parents.<eos> You... lose a child, you never really come back from it.<eos> So on Tuesday, you took them to their son's memorial on the cliff.<eos> - What time was that?<eos> - Er, just after lunch.
She still has her student loan stuff sent here.<eos> I usually chuck it on the desk, but I opened it.<eos> "I'm writing to acknowledge your change of name to Mrs Gemma Campbell."<eos> - They were already married?<eos> - Five weeks ago.
Any problems between them?<eos> They got on well.<eos> Only she left a message for his probation officer the day she died, saying there was some sort of issue with Tom.<eos> - Do you know anything about that?<eos> - Not at all.
He'd stand for days at that memorial if I let him.<eos> I had to walk away in the end.<eos> This was on Tuesday?<eos> You left Gareth on his own?<eos> Only for 20 minutes.
That middle section is not Tuesday.<eos> It's been replaced by footage from another night.<eos> Now get the Geek Squad onto that island.<eos> I want that missing bit found.<eos> - And Tom Jervis.
What did your missus think of your heroics?<eos> Very impressed!<eos> Three sets of prints, including yours and this fella's.<eos> You know him, don't you?<eos> - No comment.
You know him, don't you?<eos> - No comment.<eos> - Old mate of yours from Newcastle.<eos> Hobbies include bringing drugs into the UK.<eos> No comment.
- Old mate of yours from Newcastle.<eos> Hobbies include bringing drugs into the UK.<eos> No comment.<eos> Or perhaps you just pull it ashore and pass it onto the nice tourists.<eos> - No comment.
- Get Hicham onto it. What?<eos> We've got 'em.<eos> - At 2:46am.<eos> - Bull's-eye.<eos> And again at 3:37am.
They are welcome to try.<eos> Does that mean we are free to leave?<eos> Go, if you wish.<eos> No one will stop you.<eos> Out of my way.
That won't matter.<eos> Where's tilda?<eos> We parted ways. Just tell me that she's still alive. What kind of a mother do you think I am?<eos> I don't know what I think you are anymore. First you betray veil. Then sunny.<eos> Now your own regent?
No.<eos> Well, maybe a little.<eos> Because if you don't mind, I'd like to get Eddie and get the fuck out of here, all right?<eos> Yeah, well, about that, listen.<eos> About what? About...
So what do you want to do, huh?<eos> You in, or you out?<eos> What's in it for me?<eos> What's in it for you?<eos> How about this?
You what?<eos> He was a dirty cop.<eos> I had a falling out with the guy who was paying him.<eos> They drove him off the road, put two in his chest, one in his head, like the pros do.<eos> What about the tire tracks?
- Charlie.<eos> - Charlie.<eos> Charlie.<eos> No, you don't have to do that.<eos> Charlie.
No, he does, uh, retirement homes and kids' parties.<eos> I think you two would hit it off.<eos> Taylor!<eos> Taylor!<eos> What the fuck!
Thank you both for being so patient.<eos> And, Mrs. aherne, if you or Margaret ever need anything from me -- anything at all -- you can call me day or night.<eos> This is Mrs. siemasko and her daughter jenn.<eos> I'm sorry. I got my wires crossed a little. Uh...<eos> Bye. Mrs. siemasko:
Well, now do you believe me?<eos> I don't even know where to begin.<eos> But yes, i believe you.<eos> Your brother is one world-class son of a bitch.<eos> No offense. I just -
You know, guys like you -- you think you're so damn smart, and you think you don't have to play straight with anybody.<eos> The wheel is gonna turn.<eos> It always does.<eos> "A lawyer you can trust."<eos> My ass!
I'm gonna run some errands, and then I'm gonna come visit you, okay?<eos> Okay.<eos> Love you.<eos> Love you, too.<eos> Okay, no problem.
The official record... history... It says otherwise now.<eos> Now, that's scary, to think who could be behind that.<eos> Because only somebody very formidable would be capable of officially turning one man into another.<eos> It would take a genius...<eos> like Michael.
Took a wrong turn.<eos> You got your hair covered up.<eos> That's good.<eos> Finally find God?<eos> Not your God.
He said I was to give a signal exactly 24 hours before the blackout.<eos> I will pulse the power grid twice.<eos> This city may not have 24 hours in it.<eos> Bye, guys.<eos> Bye.
Infidels, the sinners, the foreigners.<eos> Praise Allah.<eos> Someone found my father.<eos> Means the escape is on.<eos> 24 hours from now.
Your brother is your business now.<eos> I have to get my family on a flight tonight - before the airport shuts down. - Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.<eos> Hold up.<eos> We need tickets, too, three of them.<eos> One for me, one for Michael, one for C.
- I don't know.<eos> Christian, Army.<eos> - Seems pretty up front to me.<eos> - Did he happen to tell you about some of the arrests he and his brother made<eos> - at their security checkpoint?
Because you're gonna have a conversation with Paul Kellerman for me.<eos> Bull.<eos> Kellerman's behind this?<eos> And you are gonna get every shred of information you can about what's really going on.<eos> 15 minutes.
No.<eos> Then who's it for?<eos> Do not say Annalise.<eos> No. God.<eos> Laurel.
Mr. Denver, may I ask why you don't want to reveal this source?<eos> We are protecting their safety, Your Honor.<eos> Well, certainly there's additional evidence you could offer the court to prove that the defendant should remain in custody until the trial, otherwise I'm inclined to set bail.<eos> Your Honor, we would ask for a short recess so that we may discuss the matter internally?<eos> 15 minutes.
A little unorthodox.<eos> Was he working as an investigator for you?<eos> I killed him.<eos> Frank...<eos> JFK... and Elvis.
Have him hack the D.A.<eos> No.<eos> He did it for Annalise once already.<eos> That was before.<eos> Before what?
Before what?<eos> He knows about Sam.<eos> How?<eos> I told him.<eos> - You what?
BonBon?<eos> You were right.<eos> They're not going to stop.<eos> Even if they charge Frank for Wes, they're just going to keep coming at you.<eos> For Sam..
They're meeting with Atwood right now.<eos> Russia.<eos> They don't extradite to the U.S.<eos> They don't like gay people there.<eos> Or black people.
Do you even care about that?<eos> Do any of you? - Laurel, we all feel bad.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Then think about what that means!<eos> And not just for you, but for Wes.
On...?<eos> If we're still good.<eos> "Good"?<eos> Well, a lot has changed since we last spoke.<eos> Yeah, well, not for me.
- You have no idea.<eos> - Asher...<eos> No, BonBon needs to hear this.<eos> 'Cause you know why I think family's get torn apart?<eos> - Because secrets.
But you already know that, so...<eos> And I have a problem...<eos> with drinking, yes.<eos> But I got other problems, too...<eos> Lots of them.
Have you tried meditation?<eos> I'll think about it.<eos> Where have you been?<eos> - Running.<eos> - For two hours?
- You are.<eos> - I never killed anyone.<eos> - Neither have I!<eos> - You hacked up my husband, dumped his body in a garbage bin.<eos> Because of Wes, okay?
They were just really worried about how I lost my mind up there on the altar.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I just... I miss him, and I know that you do, too, which is why I shouldn't have shut you out.<eos> It's just this whole situation's made me really paranoid.<eos> Of me?
I'm sorry.<eos> I just... I miss him, and I know that you do, too, which is why I shouldn't have shut you out.<eos> It's just this whole situation's made me really paranoid.<eos> Of me?<eos> Of everyone.
Have you been ingesting illegal substances?<eos> My client here is understandably upset about his boyfriend being missing.<eos> While your lack of urgency in this matter could be construed as insensitive at best but homophobic at worst, we'll ignore that if you at least let us file a missing-persons report.<eos> - When did you say he went missing?<eos> - Last night around 7:00 p.m.
Now Wes is gonna go down for Sam and Rebecca, and the two of you get off.<eos> Well, you know what?<eos> You need to grow the hell up!<eos> I'm doing this for you...<eos> Each of you...
Before the city goes to hell.<eos> _<eos> You hear that?<eos> That was the closest one yet!<eos> 100 yards!
A full pardon from the Supreme Judicial Council.<eos> But you will have to uphold your end of the bargain,<eos> Jamil.<eos> German engineering. 77,000 miles.<eos> Five liter, seven speed, V10.
Walk away!<eos> Hide in the cell block!<eos> What are you doing?<eos> The prison is done, brother.<eos> For the love of God!
Which one of you is gonna die ne...?<eos> Time to get scarce.<eos> Hey!<eos> What did he say to you?<eos> Nothing.
To feel... emotion.<eos> But that was a Photon Eradicator, Captain.<eos> You just violated Confederation Rules...<eos> You're missing another classic<eos> "Space-Heroes:
Oh! And there's a card. Somewhere in here.<eos> Ah, here!<eos> You brought the book?<eos> Um, sure.<eos> Mr. Gatwood.
Yes, well, w-would you tell her that something's come up and I'm not able to come in today?<eos> No, no need to reschedule.<eos> I'll just see her next week.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Ohh!
I was scared to death.<eos> A-A blubbering idiot, but I thought they would respond to money, you know?<eos> Pay them whatever it took to make them go away.<eos> More than they were already making:<eos> $50,000.
- risen from the dead and all.<eos> - Soon.<eos> Where can we meet you?<eos> Uh, hangar two.<eos> Right off the main runway.
Give it a push on my say.<eos> Battery's working perfectly.<eos> How far away is this garage?<eos> Only two blocks.<eos> No problem.
Read it for yourself.<eos> Okay, you want to put new eyes on this?<eos> Fine.<eos> Now that you report to me, I need you to look into the possibility that there was an insider involved.<eos> Here?
There is nobility in you, Lincoln.<eos> Hey... when I get back, I'll, I'll buy you a drink.<eos> I don't drink.<eos> But I'll buy you a drink.<eos> How about that?
It's about time I got out from under it.<eos> Internet?<eos> Shukraan.<eos> They have no clue we're watching, do they?<eos> Not at this height.
Understand?<eos> You know it's been four years since I've had air conditioning?<eos> I'm done with the heat.<eos> Kind of like it out here.<eos> No walls.
Got to laugh more.<eos> If he wants to laugh,<eos> Phaeacia's the place.<eos> I always wanted to bring Sheba; For her to see the people.<eos> No technology, no politics, no modern nonsense.
Phaeacia's the place.<eos> I always wanted to bring Sheba; For her to see the people.<eos> No technology, no politics, no modern nonsense.<eos> They know how to enjoy life.<eos> No technology?
Can you see me now?<eos> No.<eos> Take a screen capture.<eos> What of?<eos> A screen capture.
Omar, Omar.<eos> Hello.<eos> You bring Omar car, but not Omar?<eos> Omar had to go somewhere safe.<eos> Because of the war?
Hello.<eos> You bring Omar car, but not Omar?<eos> Omar had to go somewhere safe.<eos> Because of the war?<eos> Yeah, the war.
Don't just stand there and let the AC out.<eos> Come on in.<eos> What can I do for you fine folks?<eos> Linc, where are your tracks?<eos> Tracks, tracks.
What are you into?<eos> Just tell us where you're headed.<eos> 300 miles across the desert, phaeacia.<eos> Autonomous zone.<eos> No isil.
Exactly.<eos> Keep alive.<eos> You too, man.<eos> Linc, how far is it to Greece?<eos> 12 hours.
Youcan'thitcharide .<eos> Youhaveto rent thewholeship.<eos> Thebosscharges50k aleg, Linc.<eos> You want to get back to the states, it's 50k.<eos> 50k?
Where's Mike?<eos> You said that he was asleep.<eos> He is... At a friend's house, a sleepover.<eos> Okay.<eos> Which friend?
We broke up, and everything went to hell.<eos> You weren't there to stop me, so before I knew it, I was in the old hood, doing odd jobs.<eos> Odd jobs meaning what?<eos> Moving things from point A to point B.<eos> For Luca Abruzzi.
A pencil neck with insight into Scofield's plan.<eos> So you, in turn, can be the hammer.<eos> Screen-grab of the Skype transmission he sent from the desert.<eos> He routed the image through a server to this BlueHawaii guy, but it could have been secretly subrouted to another, yet unknown, recipient to use the information encoded in it.<eos> Information?
He routed the image through a server to this BlueHawaii guy, but it could have been secretly subrouted to another, yet unknown, recipient to use the information encoded in it.<eos> Information?<eos> It's actually incredible.<eos> Encrypted in the Arabic, the images are all sorts of stuff.<eos> Apparently, mundane as hell.
Chicago?<eos> I thought I was going with you.<eos> Not until you find out why you're my whip-hand.<eos> I have to go to Chicago to find that out?<eos> Safe travels.
- What is it?<eos> - Radiator.<eos> It has a hole in it.<eos> Give me your shirt.<eos> What?
Hey, you take care of that battery?<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> It finally shit the bed, But we swapped it out a couple hours ago.<eos> - Okay. - How'd it go?<eos> No problem.
What do you think you learned the most working there?<eos> Patience, diplomacy.<eos> Uh, you meet a-all sorts of people down there,<eos> A-and most are really great, really friendly, But you encounter some who are upset, belligerent.<eos> What about old folks?
Uh, you meet a-all sorts of people down there,<eos> A-and most are really great, really friendly, But you encounter some who are upset, belligerent.<eos> What about old folks?<eos> Uh, you get your fair share of them?<eos> Oh, lots of elderly drivers.
And a number we can reach you at?<eos> Okay, Dorothy.<eos> Look forward to seein' ya.<eos> You betcha.<eos> Bye, now.
But that would eventually take...<eos> Yes, it burst his suit like a balloon, and it popped him out like a missile.<eos> Well, that's a happy story. But what's your point?<eos> Okay, the Roci's built for what?<eos> - Twenty, 30 people? - Yeah.
Well,keepon looking while you prepare to blow that goddamn thing off my ship.<eos> That's an order!<eos> There.<eos> There it is.<eos> Right in the middle of the crater.
And I couldn't let that happen.<eos> Naomi.<eos> What did you do?<eos> I gave the protomolecule to Fred Johnson.<eos> Sweet dreams.
You're a Shadowhunter, just like the rest of us.<eos> I'm getting married to Lydia.<eos> Maybe you should do what's in your heart.<eos> I am your father, Clary...<eos> And Jace's.
Join me... And my son!<eos> Together, we can rid the world of the demons who plague it.<eos> You are the new breed of Shadowhunters!<eos> Jace...<eos> Clary?
Where did you get this?<eos> Under the floorboards.<eos> When I was a little kid and I couldn't sleep, I... Used to watch you take it out and cry over it in your bedroom.<eos> I used to think it was about my father, but now... I know it's about my brother.<eos> Jonathan.
What does this have to do with me?<eos> You really think love will keep you from hurting your family and friends?<eos> No matter how hard you fight it, demon blood will make you kill.<eos> It starts in a small way.<eos> Urges.
Nobody told me.<eos> That wasn't an accident.<eos> Your job is to stake out the potential targets, and catch the Circle members when they try to abduct them.<eos> We capture a Circle member, we have a shot at Valentine.<eos> And Jace.
I'm just some girl from Brooklyn who went out to celebrate her birthday and came back with a present she never wanted.<eos> And can't return.<eos> You don't want to return that present.<eos> - It's a blessing.<eos> - Not for me.
So, do me a favor and stay out of my sight.<eos> Doomed?<eos> I'm not doomed.<eos> Hey, bud.<eos> Como estas?
The answer's no.<eos> He just doesn't get it, does he?<eos> Not yet, but he will.<eos> There's one person who I know, who can convince him.<eos> Clary?
There's one person who I know, who can convince him.<eos> Clary?<eos> I made you black coffee with lots of sugar.<eos> It's not as good as Java Jones, but it'll do.<eos> Clary?
Give me the stone.<eos> Listen, Antiques Roadshow, you got all your stuff back, but Raphael still wants to kill me, and Camille is nowhere to be found.<eos> We might not have her, but at least we have this.<eos> This?<eos> From inside the serpent statue?
We may very well have the cure.<eos> Whatever we do, we need to do it quickly.<eos> Stay with Alec. I'll go find Jace.<eos> My stele.<eos> Clary?
No, it's not.<eos> Jace is too smart to leave a body laying around.<eos> Whose side are you on?<eos> I'm on the side of the law.<eos> Whose law?
The wolves can't.<eos> Just let me do this one thing for my son.<eos> You know, I made it this far on my own.<eos> I think I'll keep it that way.<eos> Still no improvement?
Torturing Downworlders is a breach of the Accords.<eos> We are aware of our restrictions on torture.<eos> We call this motivation.<eos> Are you kidding?<eos> Not even a dent?
Is this blood?<eos> Uh, yeah.<eos> Fake blood.<eos> Stage blood.<eos> For my band.
If Luke's lost control, he could be out there hurting someone.<eos> No. Luke would never do that.<eos> I mean, can you think of anywhere he might've gone?<eos> Somewhere removed?<eos> - Away from people?
- Okay?<eos> - Yeah. Let's play.<eos> - Who's Clary?<eos> Luke's kind of daughter?<eos> Oh, Clary, um...
I hid in an empty classroom until everybody left, and, luckily, I found a band uniform to wear, but, in hindsight, it probably would've been less embarrassing to just be naked.<eos> Okay.<eos> I will raise you one.<eos> I was holed up at home with... with nothing to feed on.<eos> No food.
The water only affects demonic energy.<eos> We'll be fine.<eos> But what if it's not fine?<eos> You think I have demon blood.<eos> Like Jace.
Are... are those...<eos> - You're weirded out. - Mmm.<eos> Who says I'm weirded out?<eos> You wanna know why I haven't been in a relationship?<eos> Because of this.
He's the closest thing I've ever had to a father.<eos> But since my mother died...<eos> Jocelyn.<eos> I'm so sorry for your loss.<eos> Since then...
We cannot let that happen.<eos> Sister Cleophas, I need to ask you something.<eos> When my mother died, I was given a message.<eos> An image of a rune.<eos> What kind of rune?
Do you think... maybe we're too...<eos> Different?<eos> Yeah.<eos> We're from totally different worlds.<eos> Different centuries.
I don't think obese tuna sounds any better.<eos> You know, as much as I love Tokyo and Prague, a bacon burger from the East Village isn't that bad.<eos> The world is your oyster, Alexander.<eos> - I got you something.<eos> - Me?
No, that's unacceptable.<eos> I am your only friend.<eos> It's in the bylaws. Come on.<eos> What's wrong?<eos> Nothing.
I just...<eos> I had this...<eos> I don't know, this really strange experience at the Institute,<eos> - and I can't explain it...<eos> - What kind of strange experience?
- You don't understand.<eos> - Then tell me.<eos> Whatever it is, it can't be that bad.<eos> So you're just gonna turn your back on us?<eos> On Isabelle?
- Then tell me.<eos> Whatever it is, it can't be that bad.<eos> So you're just gonna turn your back on us?<eos> On Isabelle?<eos> Clary?
- Not here.<eos> He's totally shut me out.<eos> He's not answering my texts.<eos> I don't understand what's going on.<eos> Me neither.
Wait.<eos> Will you be my Obi-Wan?<eos> Who?<eos> Obi-Wan.<eos> From Star Wars?
I'm gonna go talk to the pack.<eos> We're taking Cleo to the Institute.<eos> Luke.<eos> Why do you think women are so attracted to me?<eos> Apart from the obvious.
He's coming.<eos> I need him.<eos> Are you awake in there?<eos> Incoming sunlight.<eos> Clary?
She can't remember who I am.<eos> Yet I can't forget about her.<eos> I didn't know.<eos> Nobody knows.<eos> Except for you.
Why should we believe a word she says?<eos> It's probably just another trap.<eos> Luke, Clary, you know me.<eos> You've lied to me before.<eos> Because of the injections.
I need to keep a clear head.<eos> I'll see you soon.<eos> Alec, are you okay?<eos> We're under attack.<eos> Major casualties.
That way, no matter who touches the sword, it won't turn on.<eos> Alec?<eos> Alec?<eos> That's not bad.<eos> For a diplomat.
She wants nothing to do with you.<eos> She hates you.<eos> Doesn't that bother you?<eos> Doesn't it make you wanna change?<eos> For her?
I would never willingly let a vampire taste my blood.<eos> Do you have any idea what you've done?<eos> I saved a life.<eos> A monster's life.<eos> And for what?
I'm your son.<eos> No, you are not my son.<eos> I'm not your father.<eos> Jocelyn is not your mother.<eos> And Clary...
What's our status?<eos> The Waverider is surprisingly not destroyed, Captain.<eos> Though that condition may not be permanent.<eos> How long will it take to effect repairs?<eos> 15 years.
Angels and ministers of grace... defend us...<eos> You're my best friend.<eos> I love you, man.<eos> What did you hear?<eos> Nothing, absolutely nothing.
He... changed.<eos> Reprogrammed?<eos> The technology to alter the brain at that level doesn't even exist.<eos> Unless Rip's brain was somehow altered by impulses from the... uh... From the...<eos> - From the ship's time drive? - Uh, yeah.
It's like I should have memories that aren't there, and I should understand what this is, but I don't.<eos> Yeah, I feel it, too, it's happening right now.<eos> I'm reading this book about "Santarion Long-inises," and it's just a bunch of words.<eos> How long have the two of you been feeling like this?<eos> Since, uh... Film set.
- In theory, yes.<eos> Groovy office.<eos> It used to be yours.<eos> Come on, none of this is bringing back<eos> - any memories for you?
- to write a screenplay?<eos> - That's not all.<eos> He's writing about the Spear of Destiny.<eos> Which you had with you when you time-jumped<eos> - off the Waverider.
-Okay, well, then, what do we do?<eos> They're going too slow.<eos> Shoot one of them<eos> - to move things along.<eos> - Which one?
Considering I can kill you before you even knew I was doing it.<eos> Ah, yes.<eos> But then you wouldn't get what you want.<eos> You brought me and Damien into your little quest for a reason.<eos> Without the Medallion,
I don't like this situation.<eos> Not one bit.<eos> For one thing, Mr. Thawne has this habit of treating me like a henchman.<eos> And do you know what all henchmen have in common, Captain Hunter?<eos> No thoughts on this one?
I was explaining to Jefferson how you might be able to assist us with the, um... Research project.<eos> Uh, sort of like Indiana Jones.<eos> Yeah, sort of.<eos> You brought it to a coffee shop?<eos> Oh, well, for one thing.
We can't just storm into the bank and demand to see the deposit box.<eos> We absolutely can.<eos> We're former members of the League of Assassins.<eos> This operation requires subtlety.<eos> Not a bloodbath.
Okay, that should just about do it.<eos> And now we just have to activate the Medallion and see if Gideon can access its data.<eos> Okay.<eos> So what are we waiting for?<eos> Nothing, it...
We're gonna get you out of this bank vault, Eobard.<eos> But on one condition.<eos> You stop treating us like lackeys.<eos> You think you can stop that?<eos> Good luck!
"... Nero played and sang<eos> 'The Destruction of Troy.'"<eos> I will say this about the Court of Owls: they have style.<eos> Not to mention they've handed us the perfect opportunity.<eos> For what?
- Uh-huh.<eos> I may have a virus making me freakishly strong and mildly insane, but even I know that you were a sidekick to your brother and you're a sidekick to Barbara.<eos> So, can you send her a message for me? - Would you? - (Gilzean groans)<eos> - Your boss... - (Gilzean groans) ...tell her next time I see her, I'm gonna rip her head right off her body.<eos> Bye now.
You can't.<eos> You can't.<eos> You cannot do this.<eos> It's a small price to pay for saving the city.<eos> Yeah, for you.
They've got better things to do.<eos> What are we supposed to do now?<eos> We split up, go to the safe house, and regroup.<eos> GILZEAN: Regroup?<eos> For what?
I was gonna hit you before we got to the safe house.<eos> Play dumb when you didn't show.<eos> Leaning into your strengths?<eos> You want to know why you're always taking shots at me?<eos> The giant size of the target?
- Caitlin, I love you.<eos> - I never loved any of you.<eos> Caitlin is working with Savitar.<eos> - Caitlin is dead.<eos> - Not to me.
I don't know, but remember, he's been planning this for centuries.<eos> He wants to be a god.<eos> He must need the bazooka, and Caitlin, to achieve his goals.<eos> Anybody got any good news?<eos> Actually, uh, voilà.
Everything's barbecued.<eos> I'm gonna try to establish an up-link to the satellite.<eos> That's not good.<eos> Hey, Wally, can you reverse the polarity<eos> - on the neutron flow?
That's the problem.<eos> It's the Speed Force prison.<eos> It needs an occupant.<eos> When you freed me, we emptied it.<eos> - Without a prisoner...
Doesn't stay in one spot for very long, but, uh, I'm working on finding her.<eos> In the meantime, we need to work on a way of getting you out of here. Yeah.<eos> Well, we did that, remember, and here I am right back on the inside.<eos> -Well, John-- -no, man.<eos> No more running.
My captains warned me that you'd be a risk, an American Bratva.<eos> But I thought that you could be useful.<eos> I did what you asked me to do.<eos> I tried to blow up kovar's casino. All that you were interested in was killing konstantine kovar but not for the Bratva.<eos> For yourself, for a woman.
Well?<eos> DNA matches.<eos> Ok.<eos> So we can rule out shape shifter.<eos> What about, uh, evil twin?
What the hell's gotten into you?<eos> I been stabbed, shot at, put in a coma, had magic powers used on me, superpowers used against me,<eos> What difference does it make?<eos> All it's done is cost me my blood, my sweat...<eos> My Paul.
She--she was crazy. She could scream.<eos> Run away and call the police.<eos> Don't move, Trinity. Oh.<eos> I thought you'd be someone else.<eos> Disappointing.
You turn me over, I'll be dead before you get back to your office.<eos> I believe you.<eos> You know, when I woke up, I didn't think that I'd be pissing off one of the most powerful men in the military.<eos> Hit me.<eos> What?
It's a--it's a feel thing.<eos> Well, I feel like we're busting our asses to find new candidates, and you keep shooting them down.<eos> I promised Laurel that I would carry on her legacy.<eos> I just don't want Black Siren to be all that's left of her.<eos> Well, what about this woman?
Fine. What do you want to know?<eos> Tina Boland.<eos> She was CCPD.<eos> - What happened to her?<eos> - Nothing but tragedy there.
Yeah, and then I remembered nothing on the Internet is ever erased.<eos> Everything leaves behind a digital shadow, and I've been scouring the dark web, trying to find it.<eos> What's that?<eos> A terminal message.<eos> From who?
Yo. You know what you're doing there?<eos> Are you kidding me?<eos> I hacked all the traffic cams in my hometown on a dare.<eos> So this is gonna help us find miss loco bananas?<eos> Or Sonus.
When Oliver explained his thinking to us on this, which he rarely ever does by the way, I thought you would be more on board.<eos> How'd the last crazy recruit turn out?<eos> Evelyn did have her issues, true, but so did Rory, and Oliver channeled his vendetta into something positive, and as far as nut cases are concerned, y--<eos> "As far as nut cases are concerned" what?<eos> Nothing.
Unh! Son of a bitch!<eos> What the hell was that?<eos> Sonus--he's a meta-human, too.<eos> - How is she?<eos> - Still unconscious.
I guess I was just excited when I saw you on the dark nets.<eos> It was like--like you were returning, you know?<eos> The og GFG was back.<eos> Well, I was looking for an NSA file to exonerate an innocent man.<eos> - John Diggle.
And, Gennady...<eos> No one kills him but me.<eos> In 48 hours?<eos> Da.<eos> In two days.
No, the defense lawyer reserved their cross examination until the end of their case.<eos> - Do you think she'll get off? - Might.<eos> Can't predict juries.<eos> And you're sure she did it?<eos> Beyond a reasonable doubt.
You've been working late a lot.<eos> Prepping the Holland trial.<eos> What?<eos> What's that look?<eos> Nothing.
He's a real gentleman.<eos> She was already dead.<eos> No.<eos> Alive and well.<eos> 14 minutes from the house to the car and out the gate?
You would know.<eos> Let me ask you something, Rudy.<eos> You miss the job?<eos> Fuck, no.<eos> Not for a second.
Except you got none.<eos> When the department finally puts you out to pasture, you'll eat your gun.<eos> 40 minutes door to door in traffic.<eos> That night, that hour?<eos> Under ten.
Rudy Tafero's my bet.<eos> We've been at this for 13 months.<eos> We don't have any evidence, any witnesses.<eos> Ran the phone records.<eos> No calls.
Morning, Juan.<eos> Homicide.<eos> He's out.<eos> I used to say it as a joke, you know?<eos> Gentlemen.
You have to be really careful these days, Dad.<eos> Literally everything is on camera.<eos> Ain't it the truth.<eos> Okay, honey.<eos> Good night.
Literally everything is on camera.<eos> Ain't it the truth.<eos> Okay, honey.<eos> Good night.<eos> Good night.
Okay, honey.<eos> Good night.<eos> Good night.<eos> Shit.<eos> 50 bucks.
How goes the search?<eos> The board's split.<eos> Do we pick an insider like you?<eos> Go outside, someone with no ties to the department?<eos> No potential conflicts of interest?
- Bradley.<eos> - Richard.<eos> Congratulations, Chief.<eos> Um, a word?<eos> Gentlemen.
Now this.<eos> Take your time.<eos> I'll tell you what isn't here: His kit.<eos> Anything to do with his service.<eos> No unit patches, no challenge coins, no souvenirs, no uniform, no beret.
The first thing to consider when you're getting ready to have sex...<eos> Okay, next question.<eos> How long were you in solitary?<eos> Um, I'm not sure.<eos> About a day and a half.
You can't call a time-out for a wardrobe change when you're getting attacked.<eos> Fair enough.<eos> Okay.<eos> Here we go.<eos> You ready?
She wants you to take it down for the Open House.<eos> It's not a judgment or a reflection on you at all.<eos> It's just that the Open House is mostly for prospective families.<eos> And with attendance down after the whole Nick situation,<eos> - the lockdown...
- It's not that.<eos> I want to live with you and Isabella.<eos> I found out that, while I'm fostering AJ, you can't live with us.<eos> Why?<eos> 'Cause of your felony.
Exactly the scream I'm talking about, right there.<eos> - Mariana, where are you going?<eos> - What is going on?<eos> What?<eos> Nothing.
- You know, even princesses can learn to fight.<eos> - Agreed.<eos> But you don't teach them the same way you would teach a Marine.<eos> Fine.<eos> No problem.
Don't get any ideas, you guys.<eos> I mean, mostly it's about meeting other roadies.<eos> We share stories.<eos> We get present with the Mother.<eos> - Earth. - Mm.
- Yeah.<eos> Especially if you are.<eos> Thanks for, uh, doin' this.<eos> The guy I usually play music with kind of just broke up with my sister.<eos> No worries.
Feel like somebody died of tuberculosis in here.<eos> What's the Russian word for creepy?<eos> I was studying on the plane.<eos> Where did you find this place?<eos> Lyla.
I was studying on the plane.<eos> Where did you find this place?<eos> Lyla.<eos> This used to be an Argus safe house, and as you can tell from Amero-Russian relations, it hasn't been used much lately.<eos> Yeah, no kidding.
Recon's in position.<eos> I count 10 civilians in the Church.<eos> No sign of Walker or his men.<eos> Backstop's also in position.<eos> No activity here.
Do whatever you want.<eos> I'm not telling you anything.<eos> There are thousands, maybe millions of lives at stake.<eos> You don't want those deaths on your conscience.<eos> My conscience?
It's cool, Hoss.<eos> No, it's not cool.<eos> My daughter Laurel is gone, and I got to figure out a way to live with that which doesn't involve booze or snapping at guys that are just trying to help.<eos> You know, 10 a.m. will be here before you know it.<eos> How about another dry run?
Well, w-w-what are you doing?<eos> Hoping like hell I can figure out how to fly a plane.<eos> - What?<eos> - I can't disarm the nuke, but hopefully I can get it to a less populated area.<eos> Less populated? Wha...
In fact, it's the most popular gun in America.<eos> The land of the free, home of the incredibly stupid.<eos> We are not having this conversation now or ever, guys.<eos> Where are we with the gun?<eos> Nowhere.
My friend Tommy was a...<eos> He was one of the 503 killed in the Undertaking.<eos> Laurel Lance was my friend.<eos> Nobody respects the rights of someone to protect themselves and the people that they care for more than me, but everything in life comes with limitations.<eos> Everything.
It had this nice little backyard garden.<eos> I--I went to go fill out a lease application.<eos> I don't know.<eos> But what?<eos> Nothing.
And how do you do that exactly?<eos> It starts with the little things, like a small studio apartment with a garden.<eos> Let's get out of here.<eos> You got something?<eos> Nothing but strikeouts.
Actually, I--I disagree not about the part of it not accomplishing anything but this idea that it's not healthy.<eos> We used to talk about things as a society, you know?<eos> We'd debate and we would argue, and we would still respect each other after.<eos> Yeah. Somewhere along the line, that just became...<eos> - Rude.
We used to talk about things as a society, you know?<eos> We'd debate and we would argue, and we would still respect each other after.<eos> Yeah. Somewhere along the line, that just became...<eos> - Rude.<eos> - Rude. Yeah.
Hey! Long time, no see.<eos> What are you doing down here?<eos> Just some damage control.<eos> You have a minute?<eos> Yeah, for you anything.
I'm... I'm gonna have to think on this.<eos> Thank you for your time.<eos> Yeah?<eos> I got a GPS trace on Enzo Russo.<eos> Well, at least his cell phone.
He'll be fine.<eos> We heard shots were fired on the motorcade.<eos> Yeah, flipped our limo in the air.<eos> - Cool.<eos> - Not cool.
If this is about Susan Williams, I'm already on it. No.<eos> It's... it's about the impeachment.<eos> You said that Pandora has dirt on a lot of people, right?<eos> Well, yeah, if by a lot of people, you mean everybody, then yeah.<eos> What about councilman Kullens?
Do you know what your super power is?<eos> Computers?<eos> Empathy... big, reflexive, pure empathy.<eos> Well, maybe I'm fresh out.<eos> Because of Billy.
Yeah, but the other one is still wonky. No, no.<eos> It... it's not.<eos> It's actually tracking the rest of the visor.<eos> So let's take down this S.O.B.<eos> Without Oliver?
It also contains 40 million rubles worth of bank transfers from Kovar that Gregor hasn't disclosed.<eos> Open it.<eos> Ask him if it's true.<eos> Is this true, Gregor?<eos> 40 million rubles.
I am so glad you got in touch, though I am a little surprised.<eos> Yeah. Me, too.<eos> Well, "surprised" isn't exactly the right word to describe how I'm, um, feeling.<eos> What's the right word?<eos> Ready.
That was always the plan<eos> Did you hesitate at all when you killed him, or was he just another name you crossed off your list?<eos> If you kill me, you'll only really be killing yourself.<eos> ...4, 3, 2, 1.<eos> 145 seconds.
We have them all in custody.<eos> I am told they-- they planned to stage a gas attack in this very room...<eos> But, uh, sadly for them, even though they were successful in launching the attack... it backfired and, uh, killed every single one of them.<eos> Well, at least, uh, that's what the newspapers will report in the morning.<eos> Good evening.
Without the infrared from our body cams, we won't be able to pull heat signatures.<eos> So we won't really know how many hostiles we're up against.<eos> Also, this mask is really making my face itch.<eos> Perimeter sweep has two tangos at the back entrance.<eos> No others.
Anatoly, I can't let you steal these drugs.<eos> It's not matter of "let."<eos> I have invitation to be here.<eos> Invitation?<eos> From whom?
The Bratva aren't backing down, which means I have to stop them.<eos> John has convinced me not to do it alone.<eos> I wanted to shut all of this down because I was afraid.<eos> I was afraid that asking you to kill Chase would corrupt you more than... More than I already have.<eos> To me, the... the...
We're here for you, Oliver.<eos> Ok.<eos> Suit up.<eos> Alarms haven't been triggered all night.<eos> No break-ins.
Ok.<eos> Suit up.<eos> Alarms haven't been triggered all night.<eos> No break-ins.<eos> Yeah, except us.
Knock yourself out.<eos> Yeah, and then I'm gonna throw it up on YouTube.<eos> There won't be anywhere that son of a bitch can run.<eos> Does this mean that we're officially back in business?<eos> Aside from a few minor changes, yeah.
Delta team in position.<eos> Seems our friends are here, too.<eos> We're on site.<eos> An Argus drone confirms Adrian Chase walked into the arcade at 0900.<eos> 16 hours ago.
- Hi.<eos> Could you give us some space?<eos> Chase probably knew Agent Pierce was part of our operation in Jersey.<eos> This could be payback.<eos> Ok, Lyla.
Rene, come back--wha--<eos> Meet prisoner 38085, aka Cayden James.<eos> What are you holding him on?<eos> He's a person of interest.<eos> So no crime.
He's a person of interest.<eos> So no crime.<eos> I'm guessing no trial either.<eos> Do you have something you want to say to me, Johnny?<eos> Not right now, Lyla.
How about a celebratory club soda?<eos> I'm buying.<eos> Oh. Wait.<eos> Hold on a second, Hoss.<eos> How about something stronger?
If Oliver doesn't trust me enough to share important information and crucial information with me, what's the point of being in a relationship at all?<eos> I'm not gonna say that Oliver Queen plays great with others.<eos> - But he can still change that about himself.<eos> - Tch. - You know what he can't change?<eos> What?
Rene wasn't the only one who could clock tension between you and the missus, if that's what you mean.<eos> Right.<eos> Let me guess.<eos> You confronted Lyla about the Argus black site, and it didn't go too good.<eos> Something like that.
Do we know what caused the explosion?<eos> High levels of methane.<eos> Am I the only one that thinks this is Prometheus?<eos> No, but we need to find a way of saving our friends without blowing them up.<eos> - What about acid?
Ohh! Hey. I'm chinning and upping.<eos> - Kind of. - Ooh!<eos> - Ok. - Oh, ow. Yeah.<eos> - All right. - Ok.<eos> - You ready? - Mm-hmm.
I really, really appreciate what you said.<eos> Any of it stick?<eos> Hopefully.<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> - For what.
Who is he?<eos> According to dental records, Henry Goodwin.<eos> - Ring any bells?<eos> - No.<eos> Not a note.
Who is it?<eos> It's your father.<eos> This is Chase.<eos> Obviously he's framing our father.<eos> Yeah, but to what end?
Traces of soil with high levels of copper concentration.<eos> Yeah, I think you and I have very different ideas of what "interesting" means.<eos> Uh--well, I cross-referenced Queen Consolidated construction locations with areas in the city rich in copper, and--<eos> And you think you know where Goodwin was killed.<eos> Well, nothing concrete.
It's 2 of the 3 components that Justin Claybourne was using to weaponize tuberculosis in Lamb Valley 5 years ago.<eos> And you said Claybourne was Chase's father.<eos> He's dredging up the past.<eos> In the case of councilman Goodwin, literally.<eos> For a reason.
Cyclotrizane.<eos> But that's highly unstable, so it was banned from all domestic manufacturing.<eos> Which would make it incredibly difficult for Sampson to get his hands on in case Chase is trying to live out his dad's evil plan.<eos> Chase will find a way.<eos> - To what end?
I couldn't tell you anything even if I wanted to.<eos> Actually, I think you want to.<eos> Thea, easy.<eos> What do you know?<eos> Taiana.
Humor me.<eos> I find boat.<eos> Fisherman, most likely.<eos> Bribe them to sail here.<eos> In 48 hours?
I figured nobody would believe there was barber shop on island.<eos> Anatoly...<eos> Last time we said good-bye, it took us years before we see each other again.<eos> How about, Ne dumay plokho obo mne?<eos> How about prochnost?
Because what good is a family without a soul?<eos> You can right my wrongs.<eos> You can be better than I was.<eos> You can save this city.<eos> Heh! No pressure or anything.
Today, we took a step forward.<eos> With help from the Green Arrow and his team, the Throwing Star Killer is now behind bars and our streets are a little safer.<eos> Tomorrow we'll take another step forward.<eos> And the day after, we will take another one because it is time--it truly is time for us to leave the past in the past so that our children might inherit the Star City we have always dreamed of the way my father dreamt of a better life<eos> for me and my sister.
You going silent on me is not helping.<eos> You know, my mom's really big into intuition, like stars, signs, horoscopes, Ouija boards even.<eos> I always thought it was either stupid or ridiculous.<eos> I never really took it seriously.<eos> Until now, right?
How did you know?<eos> Like minds.<eos> Here.<eos> Something funny, nutbag?<eos> Not yet but soon.
It's okay.<eos> Is Nick dead?<eos> No.<eos> What did you do to him?<eos> - Not much.
Pure soul?<eos> I don't think so.<eos> Yeah, that doesn't really make so much sense.<eos> I mean, after everything she did?<eos> No offense.
Drew, you're putting me in a tough spot here.<eos> Okay, then you don't need to.<eos> I'm gonna give you an address.<eos> If that's where you are, don't say anything.<eos> 4046 Marks.
Five years.<eos> Any homicide rotations?<eos> Scene work?<eos> Anything?<eos> No.
Okay.<eos> See, the thing with John is two-fold.<eos> First, whatever you do, stand up to him and don't be a yes man.<eos> I'm not.<eos> And second?
No more bodies.<eos> Unless we missed it.<eos> When I first took this case, another file caught my eye.<eos> Billy LaBelle.<eos> Age ten.
Yeah. Hi. It's Detective John Cardinal.<eos> She may have been...<eos> Stir plate, gone.<eos> Grain mill, gone.<eos> Six brand new ball-lock kegs.
RCMP Staff Sergeant.<eos> To what do we owe the honour?<eos> That's what I'm trying to figure out.<eos> I mean, there's a rumour our department's under investigation.<eos> What for?
I hope we were able to provide some comfort.<eos> She wanted to believe that faith could heal her and you let her.<eos> Keep 'em.<eos> If any of those kids come through, please call me.<eos> Right away.
Of course.<eos> You look tired.<eos> You know what I need?<eos> Tea.<eos> From a Styrofoam cup.
We're trying to locate the source.<eos> No.<eos> We haven't heard anything, Detective.<eos> Are you sure?<eos> Nothing unusual?
Just us.<eos> I noticed all the skis.<eos> Well, they're mine.<eos> Three different sizes.<eos> Different conditions.
It's not snow-blindness.<eos> Pupil reactions are normal.<eos> No inflammation in the eye tissues. No engorgement or retinal ischemia. Ocular pressure is normal.<eos> The OCT and MRI scans show up no abnormalities.<eos> None.
No, the investigation is, err... is... it's ongoing...<eos> Coffee?<eos> Irish maybe?<eos> This is from me, Dan.<eos> From all of us.
Right.<eos> This is what has got to happen, this is what you're going to do.<eos> - I need you to...<eos> - Fatty.<eos> - What?
Vladek.<eos> Cou, cou, could, could you you help me?<eos> Make me whole again?<eos> Stop this thing in me? Hmm?<eos> This demon.
It's-It's, err...<eos> Pretty slapdash.<eos> There was a disaster.<eos> 1942.<eos> Near Vukobejina.
What killed them?<eos> He did.<eos> Anything else?<eos> Something about regeneration.<eos> What the fuck!
Ingrid, Petra!<eos> Stock control in the airport souvenir shop says this bag was sold by a franchise branch in Berlin.<eos> Fourteenth February, 10:31 a.m.<eos> Airport security video.<eos> February fourteenth...
-Oh, no, no...<eos> This way.<eos> This way.<eos> There's multiple pdc and rail gun impacts, but we have the panel stock here to fabricate replacements for the holes too big to patch.<eos> Oh-ho-ho!
Mostly low level tech and security types, with the exception of that one.<eos> He was in the data center.<eos> So we're going to interrogate him first.<eos> He has to know more about the protomolecule than anyone else.<eos> Not more than dresden.
And we lost 25 people because I made that choice.<eos> -There's no point in...<eos> -The point is, next time I'm gonna save 'em all.<eos> Run it again.<eos> Right from the top.
And whatever it is, it's generating a lot of heat from inside that rock.<eos> I sure as heck am not eager to find out what that is, partner.<eos> Then let's finish up and get out of here.<eos> What the heck is that?<eos> The "Voices on Eros".
Detonator safety got fried.<eos> Just, uh, can't you turn it off?<eos> No.<eos> Control panel gone. Gotta keep a finger on the button or timer start.<eos> Sixty-second reset.
We're going to use that to knock Eros right into the sun.<eos> Miller's leading a demolition team to plant explosives around the docks.<eos> Big problem, pampaw.<eos> Detonator safety got fried.<eos> Sixty-second reset.
Eros is what, 7,000 trillion kilos, give or take?<eos> Its temperature's gone up two degrees.<eos> Yeah, it's putting out...<eos> 7,000 trillion kilos...<eos> - Around ten exajoules. - Yeah.
Who's going to explain that to me?<eos> Our missiles, sir. They're flying blind.<eos> Which makes them essentially useless.<eos> Incoming strong-message from Fred Johnson on the emergency channel.<eos> Fred Johnson?
After the UN gave us guidance control, our techs were able to lock out some of the abort codes and override the drives.<eos> We scooped 'em up and brought 'em back to Tycho, inside gas freighters and ore ships.<eos> We could use some help removing the counter-measures.<eos> What are you planning on doing with them?<eos> Nothing.
I have done exactly what I said I was gonna do.<eos> But now I'm getting the feeling that you're not being straight with me.<eos> Well, I understand paranoia is a natural state of mind for a soldier.<eos> After you left Eros, with Miller, the first time... On your way back, you cut thrust for nearly five hours.<eos> What for?
Miller: Julie uncovered a plan to unleash this thing on Eros.<eos> She tried to stop it, she got infected.<eos> It was something new.<eos> A life form.<eos> Possibly extra-solar in origin.
Stupid kids with opa tatts and big ideas.<eos> I got involved in some things, and innocent people died.<eos> So I said never again.<eos> But this time it's different.<eos> After Eros?
But keep your helmets on anyway, in case.<eos> Try not to puke in it.<eos> Uh, question.<eos> What's the go-signal for the, uh...<eos> For the assault?
Uh, question.<eos> What's the go-signal for the, uh...<eos> For the assault?<eos> That will explode and turn into a door.<eos> Good hunting!
Well, it's okay. It's tricky.<eos> We'll figure it out tonight.<eos> Uh, all right, guys.<eos> Bye.<eos> What?
No, Robin.<eos> Josh isn't welcome here, and he never will be.<eos> Give it up, Luce, it's over.<eos> We'll see.<eos> - Hey.
- It's me.<eos> Come here.<eos> - Come here.<eos> It's okay.<eos> - Oh, God.
- Agua.<eos> - It's okay, baby.<eos> - Agua. It's okay.<eos> Here, here. Here, it's okay.<eos> Mmm!
And I love you unconditionally.<eos> No homo. - We love you, dude.<eos> - You the man.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - You the man, Mike! No homo.
What delicious irony.<eos> Talking of delicious, what's on the menu, Mrs M?<eos> Wild mushroom soup, roast lamb and my summer pudding.<eos> Well, we certainly put on a good spread.<eos> We?
"Rowan tree and red thread will tyne the witches speed."<eos> Oh, riddle-de-dee.<eos> In English, please.<eos> It's a charm.<eos> Against witchcraft.
Lilith Lafitte.<eos> She was a poet.<eos> Quite well known in literary circles.<eos> When did you last see her?<eos> The 29th March.
We've ruled out robbery and sexual motive, which leaves the possibility that she knew her killer.<eos> So I'd like you all to account for your whereabouts at the time.<eos> Eugene took to his bed with a migraine so I went to get willow bark for a remedy.<eos> And would these willows be in Crows Wood?<eos> By the stream.
On what evidence?<eos> Who else would murder a black-eyed witch but one of their own?<eos> Does anyone have evidence?<eos> Shall we have a show of hands?<eos> No-one?
A figure of speech.<eos> Witches' eyes are generally green.<eos> But Lilith's were dark.<eos> Like pools of black ink.<eos> Like your wife's.
Is this all for us?<eos> Uh, no. This is for the Easter Mass tomorrow.<eos> We're in the rectory, darling.<eos> The rectory?<eos> What about Tilde?
- If you'll follow me.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Here? Really?<eos> Gosh.<eos> From Mama's wedding dress.
I mean, it's no wonder kids are shooting up schools with lunches like these.<eos> When I was a kid, I ate sloppy Joes, pizza on a bagel.<eos> The only green bean I ate was a green jelly bean and I grew up to be so tall, my stupid mom had to get a different car.<eos> I will fight against green beans the same way that I fought against my deadly disease called cancer.<eos> For the children.
The only green bean I ate was a green jelly bean and I grew up to be so tall, my stupid mom had to get a different car.<eos> I will fight against green beans the same way that I fought against my deadly disease called cancer.<eos> For the children.<eos> Yeah, well, I think sometimes people forget that I was the first female president.<eos> - Before Montez.
Bye.<eos> - Adios.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Not a word.<eos> Seriously, not a word, all right?
Except with just no regulators, okay?<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - Okay.<eos> I would rather take it up the ass with the Board of Regulators...<eos> No Board of Regulators.
There's hope.<eos> You know, ma'am, you're one of only 46 people who became...<eos> Good night, Ben.<eos> Good night, good night.<eos> Good night.
I guess when I hacked together the video chat as an in-house tool, I didn't foresee that hundreds of thousands of people would shit themselves over how fucking awesome it was.<eos> I'll never underestimate my talents again.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> I'll continue to do it for you.<eos> Less talk, more work, boys.
It's like this. You're trying to date a woman, - but deep down in your heart you know you're gay.<eos> - Uhh...<eos> Deep in your soul, you know you would rather be plowing a dude!<eos> I don't... I do...<eos> Okay, what dude?
Richard is fucking with a product that is working.<eos> He should not be the CEO of this company.<eos> I understand your concerns, but is this the time that we fire Richard?<eos> Is this the moment that I become the CEO? You?<eos> Why you?
I think you guys should call yourselves PiperChat. I'm gonna have to insist that I keep the name Pied Piper, and I won't budge on that.<eos> - Yeah, it's totally fine.<eos> - Okay, yeah.<eos> Who gives a shit? - That's fine.<eos> - Terrible fucking name.
I mean, anything at all?<eos> Well... I don't want to hurt my arm patting myself on the back, but... right off the top of my head...<eos> No, I guess not.<eos> I mean, you've always been straight with me, right?<eos> Straight to the point.
It's more valuable to us now than gold.<eos> We need to find it, we need to mine it, we need to make weapons from it.<eos> Everyone aged 10 to 60 will drill daily with spears, pikes, bow and arrow.<eos> It's about time we taught these boys of summer how to fight.<eos> Not just the boys.
Of course, I can't remember a queen who was better loved than my granddaughter.<eos> The common people loved her.<eos> The nobles loved her.<eos> And what is left of her now?<eos> Ashes.
I'm familiar with Archmaester Pylos and his study of rare diseases.<eos> - Oh, you are?<eos> - Yes.<eos> And shall I tell you how he died?<eos> From greyscale.
You're abandoning your people!<eos> You're abandoning your home.<eos> I'm leaving both in good hands.<eos> - Whose?<eos> - Yours.
You're fired.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> - You are fired.<eos> - Yeah, we're good.<eos> Bye-bye.
- [together] Stitches.<eos> - Put in a body bag, right?<eos> 'Cause we will frickin' murder a snitch.<eos> - Yeah, yeah, stop...<eos> - So no snitches.
Go, go, everybody.<eos> Go, go, go.<eos> What is happening?<eos> No snitching.<eos> No snitching.
Okay, wow.<eos> Okay, you're in charge.<eos> Please let us know if we can assist you, Your Highness.<eos> Seriously, though, if we could just help, we're pretty bored and have nothing to do.<eos> Sup?
That's your drink?<eos> Best drinks have selfdefining names.<eos> Order a Manhattan, God knows what you're going to get, but you order gin and tonic, Jack and Coke, it's not just a name.<eos> How long have you been working here for, Laura?<eos> Four years, plus.
I wasn't lying when I said that I could wait for you at the time that I said it.<eos> I sort of knew that it had the potential of being a lie, but I was giving myself the benefit of the doubt that there was a version of events where it wouldn't be a lie.<eos> You were in prison, Shadow.<eos> How long did you wait?<eos> 13 months.

May I ask what for?<eos> Bank robbery.<eos> Fuck.<eos> Why, you pretty thing, you.<eos> What?
Now, Nancy, he comes at all of this from a specific vantage of the bitterly dispossessed, which normally I would take with a grain, but I have to admit, having seen the rope burns around my friend's neck...<eos> So imagine:<eos> two rural police, middle of wild turkey season, and the same company whose tech found Osama, is dropping two no-name grifters in our lap.<eos> You two have very extravagant enemies.<eos> Lawyer?
To be launched over North Korea next month.<eos> Just imagine.<eos> Lightning raining down from the sky in the form of precision guided missiles.<eos> Could you imagine?<eos> 24.9 million people.
24.9 million people.<eos> They will know your name lickety-kite.<eos> Brand rebranded, and just the start.<eos> No more stolen scraps, shortchanging, hand-to-mouth, gray hairs.<eos> No more motels and byways.
I had a whole tutorial with the Grim fuckin' Reaper, so I think I know a thing or two.<eos> It's easier to pass for the living in the dark, if I felt a need to pass.<eos> Only thing you're passin' for is dead.<eos> - Good.<eos> - Not good.
Come, please, sit, sit.<eos> Have a drink.<eos> My Soma not good enough?<eos> Wine cellar is overflowing these days.<eos> Not for you.
You could use a blood sacrifice.<eos> Why are you doing what you're doing?<eos> You got yours, I just want to make sure everybody else gets theirs.<eos> It seems like the right thing to do.<eos> For you.
To see you, of course.<eos> Why now?<eos> Why wait 11 years to see me?<eos> That's right.<eos> 11 years.
See, they believe what the papers tell them.<eos> They fear what the politicians feed them.<eos> See, they are mentally shackled, and yet, they do nothing about it!<eos> Yeah!<eos> Nothing!
Just do it.<eos> Did you think I wouldn't find you?<eos> I was headed back tomorrow.<eos> My money, where is it?<eos> 100 grand.
Was he the reason you left Gotham before?<eos> It's complicated.<eos> We have to warn your friends.<eos> Cole is not someone they should mess with.<eos> Good job, Mom.
What you call sanity, it's just a prison in your minds.<eos> 'Cause you ain't seen nothing yet!<eos> ♪ Funniest sound I ever heard ♪<eos> Three nines, and joker's wild.<eos> Four of a kind.
Hmm?<eos> Well, hang on to your hats, folks!<eos> 'Cause you ain't seen nothing yet.<eos> "Unsurprisingly, there have already been calls<eos> "for the mayor's resignation.
Why are you helping me?<eos> Because people think you like me, Ozzie.<eos> And as long as they're scared of you,<eos> I get to keep breathing.<eos> 1:00, my place.
You know what?<eos> You're right.<eos> You're gonna tell me what Dwight's planning right now!<eos> You think this is funny, don't you?<eos> How about this?
I'm on the scene now and we're reporting live.<eos> The Channel 9 news station seems to have had a hostage situation.<eos> Uh, we're not sure how many hostages...<eos> It's all here?<eos> 200 grand.
We love you!<eos> We love you!<eos> We love you, Dwight!<eos> I want Dwight taken back for questioning.<eos> So much for the big awakening, huh?
You guessed right.<eos> Bingo.<eos> What are, what are we doing? Ooh.<eos> You'll see.<eos> Nothing?
Gotham Cathedral, the zoo.<eos> All right, concentrate units on the west side.<eos> Make sure they're issued riot gear.<eos> - Any word on Jerome Valeska?<eos> - Nothing yet.
Always nice to be appreciated.<eos> And you're just going to kill me here?<eos> That's kind of disappointing.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> After all the buildup...
What do you mean?<eos> After all the buildup...<eos> You coming back to life, turning off the lights in Gotham...<eos> Killing me here just doesn't show a lot of...<eos> Flair?
You coming back to life, turning off the lights in Gotham...<eos> Killing me here just doesn't show a lot of...<eos> Flair?<eos> Hmm?<eos> Style?
I want to make things right between us.<eos> So you shift your weight to your front foot as you swing your arm forward.<eos> Just like chopping down a branch.<eos> Like, so.<eos> Easy as pie.
We'll talk later, Sonny.<eos> Too bad your girlfriend split.<eos> I don't think she's my girlfriend.<eos> Me neither.<eos> So about that money.
I had to prove my loyalty.<eos> Why would you prove your loyalty to a group that murdered your own brother?<eos> I knew they'd kill me if I didn't obey.<eos> I chose to live.<eos> Until now.
All my life...<eos> I felt like there was someone inside of me, someone stronger and... and smarter.<eos> Someone that people would fear.<eos> No one else saw that.<eos> Except Penguin?
How do you know that?<eos> You kidding?<eos> It's known as the Irish Curse.<eos> With chronic inflammation, you cannot drink.<eos> Nothing, not a drop.
What do you want me to do?<eos> That.<eos> I want you to do that, Gabe.<eos> Right. I got it.<eos> No problem.
Back to Gotham.<eos> Then we share the same destination.<eos> What are those?<eos> Acupuncture needles?<eos> Of a sort.
Yes!<eos> Oh, boss.<eos> I'd swear an oath on my dead mother's grave right now.<eos> God rest her soul.<eos> No need for anything so dramatic.
Fear and respect... management 101.<eos> No one ever respected you.<eos> We always saw you for what you really are.<eos> A tiny freak who used to hold an umbrella.<eos> Nothing more.
I gave the order to have him killed, and I deserved what I got.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> You have his strength, Jim.<eos> You can finish what he started.<eos> For both of us.
I can't take on Nygma and Barbara and the rest of them by myself.<eos> Who said anything about taking them on by yourself?<eos> Selina told me some pretty crazy stories about people she met down in Indian Hill.<eos> Said you wanted to build an army, right?<eos> Well, what about an army of freaks?
Who said anything about taking them on by yourself?<eos> Selina told me some pretty crazy stories about people she met down in Indian Hill.<eos> Said you wanted to build an army, right?<eos> Well, what about an army of freaks?<eos> What kind of freaks?
No.<eos> It can't be.<eos> I'm sorry, this ward is restricted.<eos> What happened to her?<eos> No idea.
Listen, Jim, about your uncle...<eos> Lee came into my office wanting to open an investigation into his death.<eos> She asked me point blank what you were doing.<eos> What'd you say?<eos> Nothing.
We have some unfinished business.<eos> And it turns out you are the last one who saw him.<eos> Yeah, before he escaped police custody.<eos> "Escaped"?<eos> From the great Detective Gordon?
There.<eos> You can lock it away, and once you do, you'll be free of the power it holds over you.<eos> I've been waiting a long time for this, Bruce.<eos> Together, we will make Gotham pay.<eos> No guards.
What are you talking about?<eos> You've taken everything away from me.<eos> Everything.<eos> There's nothing left.<eos> And for what?
Wayne Enterprises runs Indian Hill, but who runs Wayne Enterprises?<eos> A weapon is en route to destroy the city.<eos> I can't take on Nygma and Barbara and the rest of them by myself.<eos> Said you wanted to build an army, right?<eos> What about an army of freaks?
You gave me a purpose.<eos> That's more than most people could say.<eos> I'm glad you see it that way.<eos> When Bruce returns... people are going to die, aren't they?<eos> A lot of people.
We have to escape.<eos> There's only one way that's gonna happen.<eos> We work together.<eos> There have to be rules.<eos> No sabotage.
Thomas and Martha Wayne were leaders of Gotham.<eos> The city honored them.<eos> I honored them.<eos> He threatened exposure.<eos> What of their boy, Bruce?
Things could've gone so differently, James.<eos> We could've cleaned this town up together.<eos> But when the moment came, you stood against me.<eos> You stood against Gotham.<eos> Against justice.
Look at you... you still haven't paid for the pain that you've caused.<eos> But I guess that's the difference between the two of us.<eos> I'm willing to pay for what I've done.<eos> What are you talking about, what've you done?<eos> Nothing.
- it's gone.<eos> - Maybe Lucius took it.<eos> No, Lee has it, too.<eos> The day of judgment has come to Gotham.<eos> And to the Court of Owls.
Of course.<eos> This is a safe house.<eos> Oswald!<eos> Edward.<eos> No army of monsters, huh?
"Nero played and sang.<eos> 'The Destruction of Troy.'"<eos> they have style.<eos> Not to mention they've handed us the perfect opportunity.<eos> For what?
She's not my boss.<eos> I may have a virus making me freakishly strong and mildly insane, but even I know that you were a sidekick to your brother and you're a sidekick to Barbara.<eos> So, can you send her a message for me? Would you?<eos> Your boss... tell her next time I see her, I'm gonna rip her head right off her body.<eos> Bye now.
You can't.<eos> You can't.<eos> You cannot do this.<eos> It's a small price to pay for saving the city.<eos> Yeah, for you.
They've got better things to do.<eos> What are we supposed to do now?<eos> We split up, go to the safe house, and regroup.<eos> Regroup?<eos> For what? !
I'll see you on the train.<eos> Police!<eos> Police!<eos> Move!<eos> Out of the way!
I was gonna hit you before we got to the safe house.<eos> Play dumb when you didn't show.<eos> Leaning into your strengths?<eos> You want to know why you're always taking shots at me?<eos> The giant size of the target?
He's a real hero, Joe.<eos> Both of my sons are heroes.<eos> Julian and I were talking about your battery problem with your cuffs.<eos> We decided we'd invest in an alternate accessory.<eos> Voilà.
I don't know if I have ever met two people who are more suited to one another than you two.<eos> - To Barry and Iris.<eos> - Barry and Iris.<eos> To Barry and Iris.<eos> - To us.
- To Barry and Iris.<eos> - Barry and Iris.<eos> To Barry and Iris.<eos> - To us.<eos> - To us.
No, this is just between us, Wally.<eos> We can do this together.<eos> Do you know what I'm really gonna miss about this Earth?<eos> - I don't know...<eos> - Soap operas.
I don't.<eos> It's okay to be afraid of the future.<eos> But I won't let you die.<eos> I am not afraid to die, Barry, I'm not.<eos> Then what?
I think you're flirting with me to distract me 'cause you're afraid.<eos> My collection record is flawless.<eos> In these trials, I am undefeated.<eos> Please. Everybody's got a weakness.<eos> Even you.
Pretty ghastly, Detective, I warn you.<eos> - That's the body?<eos> - Yeah, why?<eos> Because he died less than eight hours ago.<eos> Eight hours?
All right.<eos> Let's get out of here.<eos> Anything?<eos> Aside from this body disintegrating before our eyes?<eos> Nothing unusual.
Flashpoint doesn't exist anymore.<eos> Stop you right there, BA.<eos> Flashpoint doesn't exist anymore in this universe.<eos> But in quantum mechanics, the daughter universe theory tell us...<eos> - Universe theory.
The West family, or family West?<eos> Right, it's time I get to work.<eos> At this hour?<eos> Yes, there's still one husk meta out there, and I intend to find him.<eos> Good night.
The strength that I found to stay in control... that came from you.<eos> So thank you.<eos> Well, I wasn't gonna let Iris die at the hands of Killer Frost, was I?<eos> I knew there was a good guy inside of you somewhere... one that the rest of us would like to see a little more often.<eos> Good night.
Ugh, robbery in progress at O'Sullivan Bank.<eos> You two go.<eos> Come on, let's go.<eos> - Didn't hear the news, huh?<eos> - What news?
Not yet.<eos> - I need him.<eos> - For what?<eos> Why'd you lure him here?<eos> For you.
Jesse, if... if you would,<eos> I want you to stay.<eos> - I can't.<eos> - Why?<eos> Because of your dad?
I love you.<eos> I love you.<eos> Um, so do you actually want any of this, or...<eos> Um, yes.<eos> And some of the food too.
'Cause I'm a small circles kind of guy.<eos> I wonder how the other Wells brushes his teeth.<eos> - The murderer?<eos> - I'm fascinated by the subtle differences between us, you know?<eos> - And the not-so-subtle ones.
But then H.R. noticed something.<eos> Well, at first, it was a real brain-twister, but then I remembered a quote from a renowned poet from my Earth, Alfred Yankovic...<eos> Are you talking about Weird Al?<eos> Why?<eos> 'Cause of the hair?
This isn't working.<eos> Plan B, anyone?<eos> Work!<eos> How much time does he have?<eos> 15 seconds.
We hit Jitters on the way.<eos> Got everybody something. You guys are...<eos> I thought you were on deadline.<eos> I am.<eos> You ready?
Got everybody something. You guys are...<eos> I thought you were on deadline.<eos> I am.<eos> You ready?<eos> - For you.
I've had somebody else's voice coming out of my mouth, and you were still able to see the real me.<eos> How about trusting that I can do the same thing?<eos> Sorry.<eos> I just wanted to do that, in case you changed your mind later.<eos> Quite all right.
- A second Stone?<eos> - Or maybe the Stone that we had was part of a larger piece.<eos> How about the Acolytes?<eos> Maybe they know something we don't.<eos> - Hey, what about that one guy?
He's ten steps ahead of you.<eos> There's no stopping Savitar.<eos> If I were you...<eos> I'd move up the wedding.<eos> So far... not so good.
And they won't.<eos> Ever again.<eos> Cisco.<eos> Get the breach room ready.<eos> Okay, for what?
You know that thing we used to talk to Savitar?<eos> Yes.<eos> Meet the electrode halo.<eos> So basically these two are linked electromagnetically<eos> - via Goldtooth.
Nobody messes with our Jesse Quick.<eos> - That's right.<eos> You give them hell.<eos> - You know I will. We're here if you need us, all right?<eos> - Safe travels.
Say, you realize how he got the nickname "Cutter," don't you?<eos> - No.<eos> - Because he likes to cut people.<eos> You ask me, I think he's all talk.<eos> Cisco... not Cisco.
I, um, couldn't bring myself to do it.<eos> You know, we've been through a lot these last three years, but, um... getting stuck in a musical?<eos> Music Meister... said that, you know, it could've been anything, that I created that world because...<eos> You were watching them.<eos> Because of us.
♪ Right from the start, right from the start ♪<eos> ♪ That you would be ♪<eos> ♪ Be my light in the dark, light in the dark ♪<eos> ♪ Oh, you gave me... ♪<eos> ♪ No other choice ♪
Watch.<eos> I don't know that he will, Cisco.<eos> Hey, Bar.<eos> Anything?<eos> Nothing yet.
Julian, please tell me you found something.<eos> Nothing yet, Detective.<eos> No fingerprints, no DNA, just two rather plump looking corpses.<eos> What about the stolen tech?<eos> Nothing.
You don't believe me?<eos> Let's see, 2017.<eos> How are things going with your doomed love,<eos> Iris West?<eos> Or your greatest foe, Savitar?
That was my prisoner.<eos> He was my prisoner too, and you're on my Earth.<eos> He has information that could save Iris's life, so I don't give a damn!<eos> It's because of you he's on the loose.<eos> Because of me?
I have been searching for him ever since, and he finally showed back up.<eos> Ten minutes ago, I had him dead to rights, and then your friend messed it all up.<eos> So yes, I do know what it is like to care about someone so much that you break the rules.<eos> That's why I have to find this guy, no matter what, and when I do, he is gonna pay for what he did.<eos> No more delays.
You're going with her.<eos> I'm not gonna stop her.<eos> Then you'll never find out what you want to know.<eos> I have nothing to offer you.<eos> No reprieve.
- I've tried.<eos> Believe me, I've tried.<eos> But you see, Caitlin's not the only thing Killer Frost took.<eos> No hands, no vibes.<eos> And without my powers... without you...
Especially you, Flash.<eos> More than you know.<eos> Allen?<eos> Yeah, it's me, Julian.<eos> From the past.
2017.<eos> 2017.<eos> The year it all began.<eos> I'll assume you're here for some answers then, are you?<eos> Something like that.
Caitlin?<eos> It's me.<eos> Barry Allen...<eos> - I'm...<eos> - From the past.
Why are you here, Barry?<eos> I just wanted to see you.<eos> Just wanted to see how you were doing.<eos> Now you want to know?<eos> After all this time, now?
Uh, Joe, um...<eos> I'm doing my best.<eos> What happened to us?<eos> My daughter's life was taken.<eos> My son's.
It looks a little tacky from over here.<eos> But I am old-fashioned.<eos> We told you to stay away, Flash.<eos> Yeah, well, I try not to listen to criminals.<eos> Or stupid people.
- Team Flash, back at it again.<eos> - Yeah!<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, I think this was a good first step, Cisco, but yeah, we have a ways to go.<eos> Especially me.
There is no sign of any... permanent structural damage.<eos> Then why can't he remember anything?<eos> Julian?<eos> He appears to be suffering from some sort of...<eos> - psychogenic retrograde amnesia. - ...
- What went wrong?<eos> - Everything.<eos> Barry's memory loss is starting to become a problem.<eos> It sure is.<eos> For more than just him.
It's just confusing.<eos> Hand me the girard processor.<eos> It'll help me prime his neocortical and medial frontal lobes.<eos> What?<eos> Nothing.
I don't know, Dad.<eos> You know, part of me can't help but... think that this is some sort of gift, you know... that this is the life that he was supposed to have.<eos> Maybe the city doesn't need The Flash.<eos> Hey, everybody!<eos> Happy Friday!
- What's that?<eos> - It's, uh...<eos> In order to generate enough power... to magnetize Savitar's radial field and keep him in a state of perpetual stasis...<eos> - Stasis.<eos> - ... inside the Speed Force,

How did you become Savitar?<eos> I was broken and alone.<eos> God feels no pain.<eos> All I had to do was become one.<eos> _
And it's all over the building, so you can't use your powers inside.<eos> Can we use anything else to power this Speed Force gun?<eos> - Speed Force bazooka.<eos> - Bazooka.<eos> Nothing else.
Because you know what you need to do, and when the time comes, I expect you to be ready.<eos> What is it?<eos> Barry went back in time to get Snart's help with stealing the power source from ARGUS.<eos> Power source?<eos> For what?
Iris.<eos> What brings you folk to this section of the multiverse?<eos> What's that?<eos> It's how much time we have left.<eos> Before what?
Neat trick.<eos> Was a neat trick, yourself.<eos> Transmogrifier from H.R.'s Earth.<eos> Here you go.<eos> Cisco, where to next?
- The Montgomery 3000.<eos> - Wait, is that bad?<eos> Well, we're looking at a 25-ton door that can withstand a 30-megaton nuclear blast.<eos> And aside from being completely bombproof, the Montgomery 3000 can only be unlocked by a voice-recognition system necessitating three different pass-codes from three different people, and as if that weren't already enough, the thing costs $10 million to build.<eos> 37 seconds.
- Uh!<eos> Elizabeth.<eos> Quiet.<eos> - You too, Meg.<eos> - What about you?
You've been carrying it around for weeks, haven't you? So what?<eos> It's a re-gift from Caroline.<eos> - I forgot I even had it. - You sure about that?<eos> Ever since we hit the road, something's been off.<eos> - Yeah, my emotions. - No, no, no.
Since when don't you like eggs?<eos> They're a wondrously scrumptious start to your day.<eos> Give me that.<eos> Who got you this?<eos> Maze?
It's not that, it's that you slept with both victims.<eos> We've been trying to find a connection between the two, and so far all we have is you.<eos> Well, I wish I could help you.<eos> What, you didn't get details between the sweet nothings?<eos> Quite a few, actually.
He did this thing with my Tibetan singing pot and artisan honey.<eos> It's a game I play called,<eos> "Do I make you horny, honey?"<eos> with some Vaseline and a car battery.<eos> - What?
There was no emotional connection.<eos> That was it, it was fun, but completely meaningless.<eos> - Just fun...<eos> - but meaningless.<eos> - Meaningless.
I was trying to prove that you weren't worthy of him.<eos> I see.<eos> What about the other women that you don't think are worthy of him?<eos> What'd you do to them?<eos> Nothing.
Has got me falling.<eos> Italian beans.<eos> And you want me to try this because...?<eos> This "espresso" concoction is my favorite thing about humanity so far.<eos> Well, besides sex, but...
Right.<eos> And what is it you desire, Tim?<eos> I want to build a cat sanctuary.<eos> Wait.<eos> Oh, for goodness sake.
I've decided to take things slow, for once.<eos> And why is that?<eos> Because I'm a responsible Devil.<eos> And I... well, I know what a big deal the kiss was... for the detective.<eos> For her?
let's go.<eos> Right.<eos> Right, what have we got?<eos> Meet Rick Cormier.<eos> 19-years-old.
Did you notice anything strange in the last few days?<eos> Any unusual behavior?<eos> Like what?<eos> Like someone carrying a small apothecary bottle marked with a skull and crossbones perhaps?<eos> No, nothing like that.
God put her in Lucifer's path.<eos> She's a... miracle.<eos> Granny Panties Decker? A miracle?<eos> Please.<eos> 35 years ago,
Doctor, surely you have some sensible advice.<eos> Um, he's the Devil.<eos> Nothing's really been sensible since I found that out.<eos> I will not help you get trapped down there.<eos> Not for some insignificant human's life.
Okay.<eos> Now that party pooper's gone, let's get started, shall we?<eos> So, um, what's my part in all of this?<eos> Well, you went to medical school, correct?<eos> Many... many, many, many years ago.
I'm just saying we're a little out of our element.<eos> Speak for yourself.<eos> Yeah, I noticed.<eos> Where'd you learn to pick a lock like that?<eos> My grandma.
Let's go see D-Major and his punk ass.<eos> Yeah, man, you're a genius, man. I want to add a little bit more bass.<eos> Hey, Lucious, I'm glad you're here. I need your ear on this one.<eos> You know the thing...<eos> What the hell?
It was weak.<eos> All the critics said so.<eos> Yeah, get up.<eos> None of this would've existed without me!<eos> Not those gold records! Not those plaques! Not this studio!
Here you go.<eos> She's really pretty.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Her head smells so good.<eos> Yeah, baby heads.
I know some of you out there won't be feeling this, but if you can't accept me for who I am, that's you.<eos> So now about to make it official with the man that changed my life.<eos> All right.<eos> Hey, babe.<eos> What the hell?
You not gonna want to miss this.<eos> What's this?<eos> Surprise!<eos> Baby, what's up?<eos> Happy birthday.
Y'all see that, right?<eos> My baby came through.<eos> Sometimes you got to surrender to love.<eos> - How long we been here?<eos> - 15 minutes.
- Drip!<eos> - Drop!<eos> Hey, look, y'all already know the spot on the next tour. It's Laviticus.<eos> Ain't no place like home, right?<eos> Yeah! - Happy birthday!
Does your lady know you're here?<eos> She knows I'm trying to close a very big deal... with all kinds of... opportunities for her.<eos> That's not good enough, Andre.<eos> You see, I don't ever touch another woman's man.<eos> At least, not without her permission.
Do you mind telling me what the violation is? Okay?<eos> Don't say overcrowded, 'cause I already got the head count.<eos> This club's in violation of the fire code.<eos> Fire code?<eos> What fire code?
Yeah.<eos> A party without your boy?<eos> That don't sound right.<eos> Well, it's a girls' party.<eos> Just girls.
It's a closed session, Mal.<eos> Dad, ain't nobody worried about your wack music.<eos> Look, we'll-we'll hook up on the next one, man.<eos> Make something better happen.<eos> Later, Nicky.
Dad, you could make a conscious effort to be a better man, to lead your family the right way.<eos> Mom, we could put the past in the past and just make good music.<eos> Look, in view of the... kismet, fortuitous, whatever you want to call it that just happened...<eos> I'm down.<eos> All right, Dad.
'Cause you're doing a deal with a man who's lying to you.<eos> - What's he talking about?<eos> - Inferno.<eos> Lucious is billing it as performances by all of Empire's artists, and he doesn't have Jamal Lyon.<eos> Empire's biggest star.
All you got to do is breathe.<eos> Carol?<eos> Carol, are you there?<eos> - Still nothing?<eos> - Nothing.
I know that Bella's all right. I can...<eos> I can feel it.<eos> Wow, the venue is amazing.<eos> I can't wait to see Inferno light up this space. Now, there is one thing I'd like to share with both of you.<eos> September 7, 1996.
Well, knowing Jamal as I do, I'm pretty sure this will be one of our easier conquests.<eos> Angelo, do not be smug.<eos> The Lyon family is formidable. However, I am confident about Hakeem.<eos> So, here we go.<eos> ¿Salud?
No, it's lit.<eos> Lucious!<eos> "To my friend, Lucious Lyon.<eos> "I can't wait until you come back roaring.<eos> "Best wishes
He was a warrior.<eos> He was an angel's angel.<eos> Now look how far he's fallen.<eos> How about a little coffee with that sugar?<eos> No wings, no home.
She was after you.<eos> So talk before she kicks in the damn door.<eos> Before the Apocalypse, angels, um... well, we rarely came to Earth.<eos> Yeah, uh, basically never, right?<eos> Right, except this once.
You won't, uh, care about anything anymore.<eos> You won't be human anymore.<eos> I used to dream about my daughter every night.<eos> Do you know what I dream about now?<eos> Nothing.
For what?<eos> Assault, murder, multiple counts of desecrating a corpse.<eos> The same corpse?<eos> No.<eos> Different corpses.
You need weapons?<eos> We have gear you can't even imagine.<eos> Now what I'm saying, Wally, is that you need people like us, and we need hunters like you.<eos> Now all we ask in return is that when we call, you go where you're told and you do what you're told.<eos> For the greater good.
Right.<eos> Castiel?<eos> Slow...slow down. What?<eos> Oh, God.<eos> The hell?
And who knows. When all this is over, we might even be friends.<eos> We think Sam and Dean were being held somewhere in the Rocky Mountain National Forest.<eos> Site 94?<eos> It's a government facility, off-books.<eos> Shadow ops.
Mom, how did y'all even find us?<eos> They helped.<eos> Hello, lads.<eos> They have a thermal imaging satellite that saw you.<eos> From space.
Says they pulled all this from his stomach.<eos> Mm-hmm -<eos> - Mm.<eos> Big breakfast.<eos> Okay.
Yeah.<eos> Those guys.<eos> Maybe he blew the wrong person's savings.<eos> All right, well, let's check out his clients.<eos> Which one?
Rules out a mnemonic curse.<eos> The oblivate spell wipes the memory clean over time, but it's intricate magic.<eos> I...<eos> How do I break it?<eos> Theoretically?
Uh, Agents Moon and Entwistle.<eos> FBI?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Last night, you told me your name was Springsteen.<eos> Like The Boss.
Mm.<eos> Well, we... can bring him back.<eos> Do it.<eos> Please.<eos> For me?
For me?<eos> Catriona Loughlin.<eos> The years have not been kind.<eos> Who are you?<eos> Rowena.
So...<eos> Mmm.<eos> Tell me a story.<eos> Mandy.<eos> That short for Amanda?
Yeah, I'll...<eos> I'll go with the cheeseburger.<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> Hey, what's the, uh, Wi-Fi password here?<eos> Extra cheese.
Hey, what's the, uh, Wi-Fi password here?<eos> Extra cheese.<eos> No, no. Just, uh, as it is, is fine.<eos> That's the password.<eos> "Extra cheese."
It's not a joke.<eos> All right, ramblers, let's get rambling.<eos> Lucifer has a kid?<eos> Hey, what's the, uh, Wi-Fi password here?<eos> Extra cheese.
It's all in the runework.<eos> The craftsmanship.<eos> Oh.<eos> Oh, the second gift is from myself.<eos> Personally.
He got stabbed with some kind of silver-tipped spear.<eos> It's not a spear.<eos> It's a lance.<eos> The Lance of Michael.<eos> Michael.
You don't care.<eos> All I wanted was to be left alone.<eos> But then you come.<eos> You...steal from me.<eos> And that?
Ah...<eos> Give me back what's mine, or I take it off your lifeless bodies.<eos> You've got... 30 seconds.<eos> Obviously, we got no idea what you're talking about.<eos> 20 seconds.
We irradiate them.<eos> Cool.<eos> The toys are the fun part.<eos> For obvious reasons, we don't trust the Brits.<eos> What the hell?
So there's the door.<eos> Sam...<eos> You should go.<eos> Another nest terminated.<eos> No complications.
But since we're such jolly good pals now...<eos> Jolly good?<eos> Let me just say that the Men of Letters is an excellent fit for someone with our... inclinations.<eos> "Our"?<eos> As in you and me?
You got anything stronger?<eos> Where is it?<eos> Where'd you get this?<eos> I stole it.<eos> From Ramiel.
Following orders.<eos> That's not...<eos> People died.<eos> The old men want the Winchesters, so I made a play for Dean, and it was working until your operation went sideways.<eos> Well.
If you hadn't been there tonight...<eos> Yeah, we got the kill.<eos> That's what matters.<eos> Hardly an advertisement for the British Men of Letters, though.<eos> Or my leadership.
Well, yeah, isn't that kind of their thing?<eos> Just got an e-mail from Mick.<eos> It's a case. Good.<eos> Looks like a guy named jarrod Hayes disappeared in tomahawk, Wisconsin, a week ago.<eos> No witnesses. No body.
Looks like a guy named jarrod Hayes disappeared in tomahawk, Wisconsin, a week ago.<eos> No witnesses. No body.<eos> But Mick says this place has a history.<eos> Meaning? Well, it means a lot of people go missing in tomahawk, one a year, every year, from 1898 to 1997, and then nothing until now.<eos> So 20 years?
No screwups, right?<eos> Excuse me, sir.<eos> Hi. Agents stark and martell,<eos> We're looking for daryn Boston.<eos> Daryn?
Excuse me, sheriff.<eos> You run the joint. Well, my name's on the paperwork.<eos> Pete handles the day to day.<eos> Are you still trying to chase down jarrod Hayes?<eos> Yeah, and, now daryn Boston.
Look, 'round here, parents tell their kids not to go into the woods or black bill will get 'em.<eos> He's the bogeyman.<eos> Everyone knows that the bogeyman ain't real.<eos> Sure about that? Seems like a lot of people go missing in this town.<eos> Yeah, one a year every year up until '97.
This is heaven.<eos> Wow.<eos> Right. Um, so, what's the word?<eos> You find anything?<eos> Yeah, kind of.
If you lived here, you worked at the plant.<eos> The bishops owned all the houses, all the businesses.<eos> Or they did until a few years ago.<eos> Looks like the sheriff has been selling off all of their family property.<eos> Everything, really... for the plant and the family estate.
You...<eos> You won't believe me.<eos> Try us.<eos> We're pretty open mind.<eos> My family, we...
I was in Heaven.<eos> I was working with the angels.<eos> When I saw Dagon had captured Kelly, I-I thought they could help.<eos> And?<eos> Nothing.
When you were taken, I searched for months and I couldn't find you.<eos> And then Kelly escaped on my watch, and I couldn't find her.<eos> And I just wanted...<eos> I needed to come back here with a win for you.<eos> For myself.
Is that a grenade launcher?<eos> Yes, she is.<eos> Yeah, but, uh, this is what we need right now.<eos> Witch killing bullets.<eos> And what about you? Uh, with magic.
Guess not.<eos> Let's say later, I... Hypothetically might need your Jeep to take it out for maybe a little cruise.<eos> Mm, let's not. You know, I gotta say, you did a bang up job with those two.<eos> You must be drunk.<eos> Off of wine? Not fair.
Family members, bystanders.<eos> Don't... leave...witnesses.<eos> That will be all.<eos> Paige, I need you to pull up the location of one of our assets, and I need you to keep it between us.<eos> Who?
You won't, but I'd very much enjoy it if you tried.<eos> You want to know what your mother said about you, Dean?<eos> All those long days and even longer nights out on the road, hunting?<eos> Hmm?<eos> Absolutely nothing.
Dean?<eos> Cass, is this place warded?<eos> Yes, heavily.<eos> Heavy enough to stop Lucifer?<eos> Lucifer?
What, that's it?<eos> We need more than that.<eos> Sexual offences never get the same resources as murder.<eos> The Chief Super told me I was lucky to get two.<eos> For God's sake.
DC Harford will coordinate interviewing everyone who was there.<eos> We'll also need to talk to the caterers, any entertainment suppliers, local businesses, such as minicabs who provided transport.<eos> There's another road in and out of the property, so it's possible the attacker wasn't a guest at the party.<eos> Can we get more uniform for searching the grounds?<eos> And divers for the lake?
Your party, after all.<eos> And we'll need you to give a sample of DNA.<eos> We'll be asking everyone at the party to do the same.<eos> It's completely voluntary.<eos> No problem.
You let me have a think about that.<eos> Not exactly a vote of confidence on his party guests, was it?<eos> Any names you recognise on there?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Quite a few.
You know, I don't know if we should be pushing, if Beth says she's not ready.<eos> Beth Latimer is not in charge here!<eos> Are you all right?<eos> Murder I can make sense of.<eos> Sexual offences...
No.<eos> I didn't ask.<eos> I dropped them a couple of streets from the church.<eos> - You were working all night?<eos> - Till three.
This came this morning.<eos> The Criminal Injuries Compensation Scheme.<eos> It's the cheque.<eos> With a written apology for the administrative errors that made it take so long.<eos> 5,500 for Chloe.
The Criminal Injuries Compensation Scheme.<eos> It's the cheque.<eos> With a written apology for the administrative errors that made it take so long.<eos> 5,500 for Chloe.<eos> 5,500 for us.
Don't you think you should tell me a little bit,<eos> I mean, anything about what's happened?<eos> _<eos> When did the message come in?<eos> About an hour ago.
He must know where I live.<eos> Do you think he's watching us now?<eos> Do you know what it might mean?<eos> Shut up about what?<eos> No idea.
But I made it all up.<eos> You what?<eos> Ian...<eos> - I blacked out.<eos> - Oh, for God's sake...
Was anyone home when you got back?<eos> I live on my own.<eos> My wife died 13 years back, before I came here.<eos> How long has Trish worked here?<eos> Nine years.
Down by the waterfall, under the tree.<eos> That was my place.<eos> I'd sit and no-one would notice me.<eos> I don't think we'll rent it out any more.<eos> Not after this.
I didn't get it right.<eos> I could see it in their faces.<eos> Your only responsibility is to tell the truth.<eos> Have you spoken to anyone else about the attack<eos> - other than Leah?
Oh, no, we're fine.<eos> We need to get on.<eos> Can you have her Friday morning?<eos> I've a client appointment.<eos> Yeah, no prob.
- Yeah.<eos> - Why, do you want to book us?<eos> - No.<eos> What time did you get there to set up at Axehampton House?<eos> About five.
A few bar staff.<eos> That was about it.<eos> What were Cath and Jim arguing about?<eos> Party stuff.<eos> Not enough drink, too much food.
He was in a right old mood.<eos> Looked like he wanted to kill someone.<eos> Saw him heading off into the gardens.<eos> What time was this?<eos> Half 11-ish?
Why did you come back here?<eos> Oh, for God's sake, this again.<eos> No, don't do that every time I ask you.<eos> Two years I don't hear anything.<eos> No texts or emails or calls.
Some.<eos> - How many?<eos> - Hard to say.<eos> Um, I've got a list from your controller<eos> - of the pre-bookings.
What was that all about today?<eos> How many ways do I have to say it before you hear me?<eos> - I mean, when's it gonna end?<eos> - Justice.<eos> For Dan.
All his potential, everything he could've been, gone.<eos> But you still have a family.<eos> You have two daughters who are still here, we're still living, and you are wasting what you have and it makes me so angry.<eos> - I have to make things right.<eos> - For who?
But you still have a family.<eos> You have two daughters who are still here, we're still living, and you are wasting what you have and it makes me so angry.<eos> - I have to make things right.<eos> - For who?<eos> Not for me.
Could you spare us two minutes?<eos> It's about your husband.<eos> Er, he came in to make a voluntary witness statement, erm, in relation to an investigation today and we just want to corroborate a few details, if that's OK?<eos> So how long have you been married?<eos> 16 years.
Er, he came in to make a voluntary witness statement, erm, in relation to an investigation today and we just want to corroborate a few details, if that's OK?<eos> So how long have you been married?<eos> 16 years.<eos> Wow, you got married young, then?<eos> Yeah, 19.
Least we have something to work from.<eos> Do you want to come and see this, then?<eos> Every man who was at that party.<eos> Right.<eos> Pasta.
Anyway, sorry, go on, ask what you need to ask.<eos> Erm...<eos> What time did you arrive at Axehampton house, the night of your party?<eos> Erm...<eos> Just after six.
I didn't think anything of it at the time.<eos> I wasn't gonna mention it, but...<eos> I don't know where Jim was at the end of the evening.<eos> When you say, "end of the evening"?<eos> Well, from half 11 on, till about half-past one.
That's what I'm saying.<eos> You'd have to ask him.<eos> Beth!<eos> Ed Burnett.<eos> - The farm-shop bloke.
Ed Burnett.<eos> - The farm-shop bloke.<eos> - Yeah, I remember you.<eos> Were you waiting for me to come out?<eos> Sort of.
What do you mean?<eos> I'm truly sorry... for your loss.<eos> Oi, oi!<eos> Hey. I thought it was you.<eos> - You all right?
Come and talk to me while I cook.<eos> - No agenda?<eos> - No.<eos> We're not talking about anything else.<eos> No Joe Miller.
A week or two after.<eos> She told me I should report it.<eos> I told her I didn't want to.<eos> I didn't tell anyone.<eos> Till now.
Any future jury could take a negative inference if you refuse.<eos> Aaron, can you clarify for us where you were this past Saturday night, between approximately 10pm and 5am.<eos> - I was fishing.<eos> - Where were you fishing?<eos> - Off the beach.
Aaron, can you clarify for us where you were this past Saturday night, between approximately 10pm and 5am.<eos> - I was fishing.<eos> - Where were you fishing?<eos> - Off the beach.<eos> - Which beach?
- I was fishing.<eos> - Where were you fishing?<eos> - Off the beach.<eos> - Which beach?<eos> The one next to the sea.
- What?<eos> - What fish did you catch?<eos> - Mackerel.<eos> - How many?<eos> Dozen or so.
Er... I think we have a good relationship.<eos> She seems to trust me.<eos> We're in regular contact.<eos> Is something bothering you about it?<eos> Nothing.
Do you mind if I serve these people?<eos> Oh, no, I think we're done.<eos> We'd like to ask you to come to the station to sign a statement confirming what you told us.<eos> Basically just says if you're lying you'll go to prison for perjury.<eos> No problem.
Where are you going?<eos> Where does it look like I'm going?<eos> - We're about to eat.<eos> - Not bothered.<eos> For God's sake.
I don't pay any attention to what you're doing.<eos> Clive!<eos> Oh, hi.<eos> I was just going.<eos> - Not on my account?
We've got a lot more questions.<eos> Ed Burnett, I am further arresting you in connection with the rape of Trish Winterman at Axehampton House.<eos> Katie Harford?<eos> But she's one of the group I earmarked to go...<eos> To stellar prospects. Yeah.
- I really believe that.<eos> - I'm not changing my mind.<eos> I'm not talking to the police.<eos> All I want to know is what Ed told you and what you told him.<eos> Nothing.
- Do you know how much that cost?<eos> - Yeah, I do.<eos> And we can't afford new ones so, from now on, there is no smartphone and you use the computer at the library.<eos> Where did you get that porn from?<eos> Michael Lucas.
Sleep on it. Decide in the morning.<eos> Just don't... don't give up on this place, on us.<eos> Not yet, please.<eos> Who's that?<eos> 30 seconds.
I'm sorry.<eos> What's happened to this family?<eos> Someone told me it was a formal do but when I got there, I was the only one wearing a suit.<eos> - We'll need the shoes.<eos> - By the door.
Cos he's clearly obsessed with Trish and he can be violent, but what pushed him over the edge that night?<eos> There's no background of sexual violence.<eos> That we know of.<eos> You seen this?<eos> Message from Trish Winterman?
- I didn't wanna bother Trish.<eos> I know she doesn't wanna see me but I've got a back door key.<eos> Why do you need the computer?<eos> Oh, it's got erm... PowerPoint things, slides on there, - that I need for teaching.<eos> - PowerPoints of what?
We're going to see him again later.<eos> I'm just grateful they got to him in time.<eos> What does it mean?<eos> For him?<eos> And you?
- How old was she?<eos> Dunno. 19, 20.<eos> Where did you have sex with her?<eos> In the woods.<eos> Up against a tree.
What you doing?<eos> Get off!<eos> I was trying to work out where Michael got the porn from.<eos> Here!<eos> Your computer.
You know what they're like then.<eos> Jim Atwood was wandering the grounds, sexually frustrated, with a pack of condoms in his pocket, around the time that Trish was raped.<eos> And he's still the only suspect who's ever come up with a DNA match on Trish, even if it was from when they slept together that morning.<eos> Vice is tightening, Miller.<eos> Right around Jim Atwood.
I thought if you found out about the computer, and knew that I was there...<eos> I dunno...<eos> It's a big thing, a rape.<eos> If my dad finds out about any of this, I'm out on my ear.<eos> Job, home, everything.
For the tape, I am showing Mr. Lucas exhibit number EM153.<eos> It's a telephone number.<eos> Do you know whose phone number that is, Lucas?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> For the tape, please.
Come on.<eos> Chug it back.<eos> That's it.<eos> Why do you hang out with me?<eos> Pity.
What?<eos> You felt powerful when you watched it back?<eos> Not powerful so much as...<eos> Proud.<eos> What about the women?
She was there.<eos> You were ready.<eos> You went equipped.<eos> I go everywhere equipped.<eos> And what about Michael?
No.<eos> No.<eos> It's time.<eos> To everything a season.<eos> Yeah, what about you?
It's not true.<eos> She's not sick.<eos> She doesn't need medication.<eos> She's not going to die.<eos> Petra.
Which would be to sedate someone who would otherwise wake up.<eos> Is that an opinion or an "expert" opinion?<eos> "Expert".<eos> So... it's your contention that Elena Ledesma was being kept in a coma?<eos> - Worse than that.
Why not a model, or a millionaire playboy?<eos> Why respond to the siren song that the Spanish call 'El Teatro'?"<eos> - For fame and fortune?<eos> - No.<eos> For standing ovation?
We know you're just trying to steal our parents' fortune.<eos> We're gonna prove it.<eos> Let me eat cake.<eos> Nice.<eos> Mmm.
Is it a stretch for you?<eos> Well, as an actor, I think live theater is a much more powerful medium than, say, streaming television.<eos> And how do you respond to rumors that this whole production<eos> - is nothing more than an evil plot?<eos> - Evil plot?
And you must be Sunny.<eos> Would you like a piece of cake?<eos> My sister prefers very hard food.<eos> Ah. Well, that is unusual for a baby.<eos> But not so unusual for many snakes.
What my sister means...<eos> I know what your sister means, Violet.<eos> It seems we finally found a soft food that you like after all.<eos> More on that tomorrow.<eos> - Good night, bambini.
I know what your sister means, Violet.<eos> It seems we finally found a soft food that you like after all.<eos> More on that tomorrow.<eos> - Good night, bambini.<eos> - Good night.
More on that tomorrow.<eos> - Good night, bambini.<eos> - Good night.<eos> Good night, Uncle Monty.<eos> Sweet dreams.
- No?<eos> - No.<eos> None of us are going anywhere until the police have been called.<eos> Oh, come on, man. It's just a fender bender.<eos> About Dr. Montgomery.
May I help you, ma'am?<eos> Sir. Uh.<eos> I'm Nurse Lucafont.<eos> Nurse Lucafont.<eos> From the local sheriff's department's medical examiner's office?
Sir. Uh.<eos> I'm Nurse Lucafont.<eos> Nurse Lucafont.<eos> From the local sheriff's department's medical examiner's office?<eos> From the local...
He was much, much more than appropriate.<eos> Please don't let him be our new guardian.<eos> Oh, don't be silly, children.<eos> It is quite shocking that Dr. Montgomery has died, but I'm not going to simply just hand you and your fortune over to his assistant.<eos> Not without some very thorough paperwork.
- in human history.<eos> - May I say something?<eos> If you're going out there, I'll stand by you, but I'm not comfortable bringing my children onto that dais.<eos> And I don't think yours should be there, either.<eos> No offense to either of you.
Hey, Teddy, would you go find your big sister for me?<eos> Thanks, buddy.<eos> Who the hell authorized that?<eos> You should be grateful.<eos> Grateful? !
If your father hadn't shot her, Mellie would be dead...<eos> That's not true!<eos> Enough.<eos> Do I need to remind you how much money the federal government spends every day to keep a President safe?<eos> $2 million.
You need me.<eos> I'm the Vice President of the United States of America.<eos> My approval rating is higher than the President's.<eos> I'm the widow of a national hero.<eos> An icon.
And, as you somehow know, I will be arresting and charging your client today.<eos> Then, let me organize his surrender.<eos> Let's keep it civil.<eos> No press. Bail pre-arranged. He gets to say goodbye to the wife, then we come in.<eos> No perp walk.
If it comes to that, I will be.<eos> You feel you're ready for that level of scrutiny?<eos> Do you think I am?<eos> I do.<eos> What?
Preparing to take Axelrod.<eos> Go!<eos> Go! Go!<eos> He's in the car.<eos> Out of the car! Hi.
Sorry, Nathalie.<eos> Messy garden, it is.<eos> So, Alex, any particular reason for your newfound interest in high school football?<eos> Is it a fascination with team psychology, or are you making a study of the celebration of the athlete as modern gladiator?<eos> - Yes, dad.
She doesn't understand our kind of love.<eos> Doesn't mean she loves any less.<eos> Wait till your mom is asleep.<eos> If you can get Adrian to go with you... You can go for a couple of hours.<eos> No drinking.
Not to anyone good.<eos> Unlike me, you're a nice guy, and you're never gonna be able to live with yourself if you leave us behind, 'cause, if you do, we die, and you know it.<eos> Besides, if there's something out there, how are you gonna survive taking care of a scared little freak on your own?<eos> Get us out, and we'll help you.<eos> The more the better.
No name given.<eos> A veteran officer.<eos> Mr. Anderson, do you chase down every crackpot tip that you get?<eos> Lieutenant, this came from someone in your department.<eos> Who?
The metal circle that secures the crystal on a watch.<eos> What for?<eos> Marks on Gunn's neck and back.<eos> Robertson thinks choke hold, maybe.<eos> Like old school LAPD.
So, what else?<eos> All right, I heard a thud.<eos> Right? Like... something getting knocked over.<eos> Kind of muffled.<eos> Like a gunshot?
His rapes and murders.<eos> Guess which 15th century Dutch artist painted that phrase on a table top.<eos> Hieronymus Bosch.<eos> So, what, Harry Bosch, the avenging angel?<eos> Something like that.
Take the weekend to cool off.<eos> I'm following the evidence, Bosch.<eos> I sure as hell don't want to see it buried by your friends in the department.<eos> You're on very thin ice.<eos> Not another word.
Will you relax?<eos> He didn't.<eos> So why does he keep talking to him?<eos> 'Cause he's got nothin' else.<eos> Nada.
- Cool.<eos> - No, it's... it's not cool.<eos> That's why you're gonna be waiting in the car.<eos> Dad.<eos> So much blood.
Yes. Yep.<eos> Must've really slammed it hard.<eos> Yeah, slammed the shit out of it.<eos> Be careful with these.<eos> No alcohol, no driving.
You know what?<eos> Guys like that, that's just unhappiness eating 'em up.<eos> You ought to feel sorry for him.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> No, no, not the giraffe.
One bit of good news.<eos> - The guy, the asshole who hit me... - Yeah, yeah.<eos> - He's got a record. - Uh-huh.<eos> I don't.<eos> You?
- The guy, the asshole who hit me... - Yeah, yeah.<eos> - He's got a record. - Uh-huh.<eos> I don't.<eos> You?<eos> Me?
- Oh, good. - Yeah.<eos> Your server will be right with you, okay?<eos> Sure. Okay.<eos> What did you do this time?<eos> Au contraire.
If I'm not mistaken, I'm pretty sure I screamed like a guy getting his fucking toe chopped off.<eos> I mean after.<eos> After, I was on fuckin' Jupiter with all the pain meds you guys gave me.<eos> I thought your dog ate my toe.<eos> Okay then, since.
My brother watched a documentary about Malawi one night after a party, a party where he found out that all our friends were calling us "trustafarians" behind our backs.<eos> Useless trust-fund hippies.<eos> Next morning, he wakes me up and guilts me into getting onto a plane to Malawi.<eos> So, not a lot of time to prepare.<eos> No malaria prophylaxis, no water purifier, no maps?
I'm walking down the hall going to check on some test results of a test that I did.<eos> So...<eos> - I'll see you soon.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Not weird.
Ever been married?<eos> Once.<eos> Three years.<eos> - What went wrong?<eos> - Oh, so many things.
Garth?<eos> Garth, where are you at?<eos> I'm here.<eos> I needed to get away from him... and from you, too.<eos> Me?
I'm here.<eos> I needed to get away from him... and from you, too.<eos> Me?<eos> Why...<eos> Why me?
That's it.<eos> Have a great night!<eos> You know you can wait inside.<eos> You won't want to hear it, but this is for the best.<eos> Please, Jimmy...
Whichever lucky soul at the D.A.'s office catches this, looking at an easy clear.<eos> There's a felony in there, right?<eos> That would be a cla...<eos> Go ahead, classic case of overcharging.<eos> No offense.
I have an employee who does all that now.<eos> You took away your brother's key when you hired this employee?<eos> I changed the locks.<eos> Going back to the confrontation, so I have it absolutely clear, did he strike you?<eos> No, nothing like that.
And I know... well, he... well, he's emotional.<eos> I understand, but this is more than flying off the handle.<eos> I'm not going to defend his actions.<eos> But I can't help wondering if there's not a better solution.<eos> For everyone.
No, Chuck knows everybody at the bar.<eos> Hell, he made half their careers.<eos> It's gonna be him and his cronies versus me.<eos> Alone.<eos> - Not alone.
So... what'dya think of him?<eos> I mean, speak freely.<eos> You couldn't possibly offend me.<eos> He's a bit of a prick, right?<eos> Nothing?
Nice to fix something for once.<eos> Hell, if that's how you feel, I got a leaky toilet back at the office.<eos> All right.<eos> If you ever need anything from my end...<eos> Hasta luego.
Ms. Wexler?<eos> Thank you, Mr. Chairman.<eos> You testified you've known my client for some time.<eos> How long exactly?<eos> Nearly 10 years.
You're not on the witness list.<eos> You don't have to testify.<eos> No, no, no, no.<eos> I'm not here for that.<eos> Well, what, then?
I want you to see what's what.<eos> She's not what I expected.<eos> Oh, yeah?<eos> What'd you expect?<eos> Just... not her.
Overruled.<eos> The witness can answer the question.<eos> I covered most of the walls with Foil-Scrim-Kraft insulation.<eos> I also hung a number of space blankets.<eos> Compact Mylar sheets.
Got it.<eos> So, if I had a small battery, say, from a watch or something, and I got it close to you, close to your skin, you'd know?<eos> I would feel it, yes.<eos> Can you feel more current coming from any particular direction right now?<eos> Uh, from that back wall or, uh, from over there or up through the floor?
However, as to ethical violation 16-304 (A), the State Bar's claim of destruction of evidence... it categorically did not happen.<eos> Jimmy McGill had no premeditated agenda when he entered his brother's home.<eos> - He lost his temper...<eos> - Chuck, please!<eos> - ...plain and simple.
Mr. Yalowitz.<eos> Hey, it's Jimmy McGill.<eos> Listen, for your future lawyering needs, I am taking a hiatus of one year.<eos> Will you please watch your mail for a letter from my office?<eos> Yes, Jimmy from TV.
See what he found out.<eos> Yeah.<eos> So... your father... his shop.<eos> W-where does he get his upholstery?<eos> From, uh, the distributor.
It's a big production, actually.<eos> Our usual rate is one commercial, one airing... $850, but you're in luck... today, we have a one-time special.<eos> Our Elite package. Seven commercials, seven airings for forty... forty-six hundred dollars.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Forty-six hundred dollars.
From now on, when people think guitars, they're gonna think "ABQ In Tune."<eos> When they think pianos... "ABQ In Tune."<eos> Drums, xylophones...<eos> for less than the price of that Ritchie Blackmore beauty you got on that rack, you're gonna have the whole town thinking, "ABQ In Tune."<eos> Yeah, but... but what about the time slot?
Why would you rent a toupee?<eos> Y'know, from the Toupee Store. So you don't have to maintain it.<eos> - All right. Seven and Seven.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> And an Old Fashioned.
Uh, oh.<eos> Can you, uh, start charging this card<eos> - instead of that other one? - Yeah, yeah.<eos> You got it. - Thank you.<eos> - No problem.
the instructions say he wants you to read it as soon as possible.<eos> Uh, here's what I need you to do. Call around.<eos> Find someplace special for the retirement party.<eos> Something classy, old-school.<eos> Uh, La Posada, maybe.
Here we have B-2.<eos> B-2.<eos> Well, tonight is all bingo.<eos> Here it comes.<eos> O-70. Anyone?
Here it comes.<eos> O-70. Anyone?<eos> O-70.<eos> All right.<eos> No takers.
Here's I-25... the big "I."<eos> I-25.<eos> It's B-12, like the vitamin.<eos> O-67!<eos> Anybody?
Coming.<eos> Uh, I'm missing a survey history in this one.<eos> On it.<eos> Sorry about that.<eos> Not a problem.
Whaddya say?<eos> _<eos> Yeah. Tribal police?<eos> Yeah, I was out on your property this afternoon and found a dead body.<eos> Off the old post road.
- Nice to meet you.<eos> Good to see all of you.<eos> - Have a wonderful lunch, Howard. - Mm.<eos> Sorry to hold things up.<eos> - Not at all.
Thanks again, Kim.<eos> I'll let Billy know you'll be calling,<eos> - and we'll talk tee times soon.<eos> - Sounds good.<eos> - All right.
Yo, I'm on my way.<eos> Yeah, yeah.<eos> I've got a problem I think you can help me with.<eos> I've got cash I can't spend.<eos> About $200,000.
Now, it seems to me you opened this place to solve a similar problem.<eos> And you think that solution could be applied to you.<eos> As a one-time arrangement.<eos> It would be unwise for us to be publicly associated, wouldn't you agree?<eos> Because of the Salamancas.
My boss, Mr. Mankiewicz, will be down here for the actual trial.<eos> But you are, in fact, northeastern?<eos> Yeah, I'm... I'm from New York.<eos> And your parents? They're also...<eos> Northeasterns?
But his lawyer's never tried a murder case before, and between you and me he thinks my dad's kind of a kook.<eos> Enjoy your coffee.<eos> Ooh. Maybe the guillotine.<eos> That's not a bad way to go. Quick and French.<eos> How about a good old-fashioned hanging.
Special delivery!<eos> Nailed it!<eos> We're out of everything.<eos> Oh, here's something cute in East Charm City.<eos> Oh, near the cute insane asylum?
I really hope, for your sake, you know what you're doing blackmailing my team to do your dirty work.<eos> The package will be sealed, and it cannot, under any circumstances, be opened by anyone but me.<eos> My best to Gabby and the kids.<eos> Anything?<eos> Nothing so far.
No.<eos> We wait till they come out.<eos> I need the box number that goes with this.<eos> Box 518.<eos> No phones or weapons.
Being a part of something.<eos> Fighting for something.<eos> You tell anyone I said that... Too late.<eos> Why'd you quit the army then?<eos> My sister.
There are no copies.<eos> And now that I've had time to think about it, I decided that the right thing to do is to give you and not them this tape.<eos> Maybe it'll give you the strength back to indict them and save us all from financial ruin.<eos> Bye, Tracy.<eos> Good luck.
Bye, Tracy.<eos> Good luck.<eos> Maybe it'll give you the strength back to indict them and save us all from financial ruin.<eos> Bye, Tracy.<eos> Good luck.
- If they know...<eos> - They do.<eos> They must.<eos> Then they wanna retire me.<eos> - With a bullet.
I'm just glad you all got to know her even a little bit.<eos> From a little shop on j street.<eos> I'm sorry for your loss, Christina.<eos> Our loss.<eos> Yes, yours and mine,
From a little shop on j street.<eos> I'm sorry for your loss, Christina.<eos> Our loss.<eos> Yes, yours and mine,<eos> America and Israel.
Christina...<eos> Unless I do something about it.<eos> Are you open to ideas?<eos> Ideas are good.<eos> 3:00 in the morning?
- Well, what about National Security?<eos> - Excuse me?<eos> Well, all I've heard from Riley over the last year is national security, National Security.<eos> What Ingersol's doing with Sangravan is a threat<eos> - to National Security.
This is not an exchange.<eos> It's an ambush.<eos> - Roll it up. - What?<eos> Get him out.<eos> No noise.
Have a nice day.<eos> We know you set up George salt.<eos> Got him to work early for a meeting that didn't exist.<eos> Listen, they said if people start to ask questions, not to say anything, and if I did, they would kill me.<eos> And George.
Only child of Marcus and Esme Flynn.<eos> And, apparently, reading between the lines on the emails we got from her personal computer,<eos> - now in a relationship with Bryan.<eos> - Police believe she was taken about 6:30 last night in this van caught here by an external security camera, part of a recently installed state-of-the-art alarm system.<eos> Still no word from Bryan.
Still no word from Bryan.<eos> Radio silence.<eos> All he's gonna care about now is getting her back.<eos> So we have to stop him.<eos> For his own good.
This is one of my favorites.<eos> Hey.<eos> I hope you find her.<eos> I will.<eos> Two minutes.
- Not if he gets across the border.<eos> He runs all of his southwestern shipment through you.<eos> So who else does he know down here in Texas?<eos> This image is from an FBI surveillance camera<eos> - almost an hour ago.
He's a loose canon and he's done, so tie him down before I do.<eos> You people are finished with Mejia.<eos> This is an FBI operation now.<eos> That's not your decision to make.<eos> From the White House.
Smart.<eos> Simple. Bryan's on his way to El Paso.<eos> He's gotta be.<eos> - Where is he now?<eos> - Angleton, Texas. - How far to El Paso?
I got him, go!<eos> No, no.<eos> The Mexican military are coming.<eos> - How long?<eos> - Maybe five minutes.
Boss talked to the Mexican ambassador.<eos> Said he doesn't know anything.<eos> Yeah, nobody knows nothing.<eos> - Figures.<eos> - What about their military?
_<eos> _<eos> How you doing today?<eos> Romeo, on the move now.<eos> Right behind you.
Yes, they did.<eos> And what were they doing in...<eos> Keykino.<eos> They were supposed to be meeting an Asset who had asked for our help to get him out of Russia.<eos> An Asset? From the SVR, Russia's Intelligence Service.
And what is Yuri's particular value?<eos> He claims to know the identity and allegiance of over 300 Russian agents in the United States.<eos> - And who recruited him to defect?<eos> - I did. For how long?<eos> The last 14 months.
John, this is me asking.<eos> And I know you know better than to ask me... Your big brother.<eos> Your own flesh and blood.<eos> You done?<eos> 13 years old.
A friend in German intelligence.<eos> Are you crazy?<eos> You kill FSB officers in the middle of Saint Petersburg!<eos> You think you can get away with that?<eos> For your hands.
Bye, John.<eos> Leave the kids alone.<eos> Last time I tell you that.<eos> I got two.<eos> You?
We do this by the book.<eos> We don't need another Srebrenica.<eos> Sierra, Roger. Out.<eos> - What happened in Srebrenica?<eos> - Nothing good.
Can we get some onion rings, too, please?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> My mom and I just moved here, so...<eos> - From where? - New York.
Usually, sophomores, they only play JV.<eos> This year, we've got an open spot in varsity.<eos> From what you've been showing us, well, I want you to fill it.<eos> Varsity's got longer practices.<eos> More away games.
This year, we've got an open spot in varsity.<eos> From what you've been showing us, well, I want you to fill it.<eos> Varsity's got longer practices.<eos> More away games.<eos> Yeah, bigger commitment, yeah.
Happy to help, Ms. Hermione.<eos> Unlike the rest of Riverdale.<eos> - Hmm.<eos> - What's that?<eos> A spot of good news.
I did.<eos> I definitely did.<eos> So no backsliding.<eos> No Cheryl.<eos> No Veronica and...
Jug.<eos> What's up?<eos> What's up is I saw you, Archie.<eos> In the music room.<eos> With Ms. Grundy.
I'm trying to be your friend here.<eos> Even though we're not anymore.<eos> How long?<eos> You and Grundy?<eos> Since the summer.
Those bright neon lights of Pop's keeping the darkness at bay.<eos> Giving way, as all nights must, to a morning of reckonings.<eos> We're reviewing new systems of human biology starting with...<eos> You're here for me, aren't you?<eos> Because of the autopsy?
Cheryl, truly, that's not why I came forward.<eos> Save the, "Aw, shucks" for Betty.<eos> I'm granting you one wish, Archie.<eos> Nothing is off the table.<eos> Except for my body.
Making them better.<eos> Recording them.<eos> So, you feel qualified to write songs for the Pussycats?<eos> Yeah.<eos> - For divas of color?
- Nine points?<eos> - Better than "Big girl."<eos> Seven point five.<eos> Polly's in this book...<eos> Next to Jason's name.
Betty couldn't make it.<eos> So she sent me instead.<eos> Welcome all, to the first annual Taste of Riverdale.<eos> As a lead-up to our 75th anniversary jubilee, this event proves that Riverdale truly is a town that, when tragedy knocks us down, we get right back up!<eos> Bon appetit.
A Sticky Maple of your own.<eos> Wait!<eos> What, what?<eos> Apologize for ruining Polly.<eos> - What the hell?
It's a nice dream.<eos> Where does this end, Geraldine?<eos> I have no idea.<eos> But we're here.<eos> And for me...
I mean, is there not a nice gay kid at your school?<eos> Yeah. There is.<eos> Me.<eos> All right.<eos> No cruising guys tonight.
All right.<eos> No cruising guys tonight.<eos> Okay?<eos> We both know what goes on in those woods.<eos> - Oh, my God, Dad...
Not ont for your sake, but Ms. Grundy's.<eos> Is this really what's best for her?<eos> I am gonna deal with this, but on my terms, not yours.<eos> Good day, Ms. Hermione.<eos> From the dry cleaners.
Shut the hell up, or you'll find out!<eos> I cannot believe you just threatened a gang-banger.<eos> I've dealt with worse in the East Village.<eos> I just hate when people disrespect my cinematic experience.<eos> How about a refill?
This is how my dad had his Jason Blossom murder board before it was trashed.<eos> Any leads on who did that?<eos> Or what they were looking for?<eos> Nope.<eos> No fingerprints.
Turkey on rye, hold the tomatoes, to-go.<eos> Great.<eos> Can I get a huge cup of coffee to go?<eos> I'm running on little or no sleep.<eos> Archie.
Why can't a date just be a date?<eos> What about you, Archie?<eos> How's life in a PG world?<eos> PG.<eos> Post-Grundy.
He was just, gone.<eos> I didn't even get a chance to say goodbye.<eos> That's why I think it's so great.<eos> You're all getting a chance to say goodbye to Jason tomorrow...<eos> Not all of us.
I know it's impossible.<eos> But I swear, when I put it on, it...<eos> It feels like he's in the room with me.<eos> Even though we were twins, I used to demand I have my own birthday party.<eos> Until one year, out of the blue,
Yeah. I mean, of course.<eos> Good.<eos> Actually, why don't we have the dinner at my place?<eos> It's nicer.<eos> No offense.
Beyonce is not Josephine Baker.<eos> It's an impossible target to hit, and I keep trying... - Right...<eos> - ...but he just...<eos> Anyway, what's your sob story?<eos> Nothing so glamorous.
I'm hanging on by my whiskers.<eos> You?<eos> The prospect of total humiliation in front of this entire town is terrifying.<eos> Want some company out there?<eos> More than anything.
How far did she get?<eos> What?<eos> Thank you for walking me home.<eos> I'll call you later.<eos> Goodnight.
Of course I did.<eos> You have no idea how many times I bailed that man out of jail.<eos> Son, when someone is drowning, you can try to save them, but not if they're gonna drag you down with them.<eos> I did the best I could for my family.<eos> For you.
It'll be a bloodbath!<eos> They've been the Hatfields and the McCoys since long before Polly was pregnant.<eos> Plus, I'm trying to avoid the Blossoms.<eos> If they find out your father is the one who bought the drive-in, it'll be open war.<eos> Against us?
Please, Mom, she really needs our help.<eos> Fred.<eos> You try to hire my crew on the first day of construction?<eos> Opportunity knocks when it knocks.<eos> Nothing personal.
Mom!<eos> Polly, look, Mom's here!<eos> I'm so glad you're here, and you're safe.<eos> You and the baby.<eos> Oh, Mom.
Enough!<eos> Both of you!<eos> If you believe one lie...<eos> This is why Jason is dead!<eos> Because of this hate.
It was a question that brought the wolves to Riverdale.<eos> And now, the Blossoms were circling the wagons against possible attack, from within their own ranks.<eos> Polly won't answer my calls or e-mails.<eos> I mean, I get that she doesn't want to talk to my dad, but what did I do wrong?<eos> Nothing.
Our heritage.<eos> Sounds cool.<eos> It is. Beyond.<eos> It's also incredibly exclusive.<eos> Family and inner circle only.
It's a simple thing, a little dinner, chit-chat, dancing.<eos> We would love you to attend as Cheryl's escort.<eos> You two make quite the pair.<eos> Oh, I'm honored, Mr. Blossom, really, but...<eos> But nothing.
The Ice Woman cometh.<eos> Hey, Cheryl.<eos> As a maj thank-you for coming to the maple banquet with me tomorrow, I wanted to give you this.<eos> An '84 Les Paul.<eos> In our signature color.
Cheryl's a bright girl, but the Blossom board, they're very skeptical of having her play an active role in the company.<eos> Now, someone with your stock and character by her side, tempering her more erratic behavior...<eos> You know, it's about...<eos> Creating a picture.<eos> The right picture.
Dude, come on. That's a primal betrayal.<eos> Why do you hate your birthday so much, Jug?<eos> PTSD from when I was a kid.<eos> I don't know. Things were always messed up at home.<eos> Usually because of my dad.
- I've been once or twice.<eos> Mmm, mmm, mmm.<eos> You can cut the sexual tension in here with a knife.<eos> What's up, Joaquin?<eos> Nothing.
I'm saying, if you want to go after Jughead's dad, Mrs. Cooper, I'm in.<eos> Sorry to interrupt, but I have an announcement to make.<eos> One that tangentially involves you, Betty.<eos> I'm bringing Polly to the dance as my date, and we're campaigning as co-queens of Homecoming Court.<eos> - Because why?
- We can get, um...<eos> - General Tso's chicken, scallion pancakes, vegetable dumplings, family-style.<eos> What's wrong, son?<eos> Huh?<eos> Nothing.
I thought you said she wanted me to be here.<eos> She does.<eos> I mean, it is Homecoming after all.<eos> And our families should be coming together.<eos> Right, Mom?
What's the one place in town that's open 24 hours?<eos> Hint, we were just there.<eos> - Told you.<eos> Jug, we're so sorry...<eos> About everything.
Excuse me, sir.<eos> We need to see Sheriff Keller.<eos> There's been a huge mistake.<eos> Sheriff, we need to talk to you about FP Jones.<eos> - What about him?
I'm not his legal guardian.<eos> Oh, good thing mom's a lawyer.<eos> Archie, my priority is keeping you safe.<eos> Keep me safe from who?<eos> Jughead?
- Yeah.<eos> Exactly.<eos> - Yeah. So...<eos> The Jubilee, that's for the entire town.<eos> Not just your friends.
Maybe, why do you ask?<eos> Your father and I made Fred an offer to buy out the SoDale contract, but Fred is still on the fence about it.<eos> I was hoping maybe you could talk to Archie.<eos> Maybe he could convince Fred to sell?<eos> Yeah, sure, Mom.

- It's a big place.<eos> - Yeah, let me guess:<eos> you want to go in first, bring him out, and let us make the arrest?<eos> Uh-uh. Forget it, Johnson.<eos> - Okay, well, how about an estimate?
Tapscott formed the Pan African. People's Arkestra.<eos> It single-handedly kept the Leimert Park music scene alive for years.<eos> My father listens to jazz, Harry.<eos> Me, I'm more Ozomatli or Los Lobos.<eos> No offense.

Military teaches it, mixed martial arts.<eos> Anyone can find a how-to on the internet.<eos> Or a cop of a certain age.<eos> Yeah.<eos> My age.
Cut to the chase, Jerry.<eos> Michael Slater, the guy who claims Billy confessed to him, was in and out of jail in his early 20s for petty stuff.<eos> But for the past two decades, he's been clean.<eos> Public school teacher, youth minister at church.<eos> No drinking, no drugs.
That is one tough woman.<eos> Speaking of tough women, have you and Gemma set a wedding date?<eos> She called it off.<eos> What?<eos> Over the dog?
Billy, I told you...<eos> That this isn't real, I know.<eos> And that I don't have feelings for you, but you're wrong.<eos> And I'm gonna prove to you, and to everyone, that I'm innocent.<eos> And not with a hair strand or a cheek swab.
But I can't.<eos> It's so complicated, and I don't know what to do, and I need my mother.<eos> I need you.<eos> You know the rules, Rice.<eos> No contact.
Stale beer and something nasty.<eos> That's called hormones.<eos> We're investigators from the State Attorney's Office.<eos> What's that?<eos> Like, better than cops?
I told Danny he was being crazy.<eos> He wouldn't listen.<eos> He said that Christians have been oppressing Muslims for 1,000 years, and that jihad was the only weapon the weak had to conquer the powerful.<eos> Well, I thought Islam was a religion of peace.<eos> Not to Danny.
He wouldn't listen.<eos> That's why I killed him.<eos> Jafar, you... you could've called the police.<eos> You could've called the FBI.<eos> And then what?
And if you think the only Presidential candidate left in this election is gonna get down on her knees and be a good little girl for you, The man who tried to murder his way into the oval, Honey...<eos> You better think again. Look at me, Mellie.<eos> Look at me.<eos> I had nothing to do with Frankie's death.<eos> Absolutely... Nothing.
And then you're gonna feel terrible about the chaos you will have helped create in this country.<eos> I'm not... The bad guy here, Mellie.<eos> Not this time, at least.<eos> This time, she is.<eos> 60 feet?
Would you say you have a problem with white male voters?<eos> I can make a stronger appeal to them, yes.<eos> Well, they actually still watch Baseball.<eos> And throwing out the first pitch at Nationals Park is a good way to make a strong appeal.<eos> In two weeks?
Attractive?<eos> Magnetic?<eos> - Charismatic? - Yes.<eos> But no, nothing has happened between us.<eos> Nothing.
I'm still weighing Cyrus' offer.<eos> I assumed you were, which is why in the interest of helping you reach a decision, We need to have a conversation.<eos> It's the pitch heard 'round the political world.<eos> Senator Grant's stellar strike Has raised her polling significantly Among male voters nationally.<eos> A 14-point bump among older white males?
I just need...<eos> Doesn't matter because we don't have a candidate anymore.<eos> So we pack it up.<eos> We give up?<eos> What about truth, justice, country, et cetera?
skull is mush.<eos> Okay.<eos> Pupils are fixed and dilated.<eos> Jackson?<eos> Nothing.
- Yeah, just trust me, okay?<eos> - Okay.<eos> - Sorry to interrupt.<eos> You're not interrupting.<eos> - 10 minutes.
Just do me a favor, call, and lie, okay?<eos> Oh, no.<eos> Sorry, ma'am.<eos> No... no dogs allowed in here.<eos> No flea bags!
So that nine milli weighs 33.6 ounces.<eos> He's 187 pounds. Momentum is mass times velocity.<eos> Even one bullet, 124 grains of weight in there, would lower his wrist just a tad.<eos> That thing's at full attention.<eos> At ease, soldier.
There.<eos> You're good as new.<eos> Better than new.<eos> What is it?<eos> Nothing.
Come on.<eos> This machine is a death sentence.<eos> How could you do this to me?<eos> I did this for you.<eos> For us.
I see what you did.<eos> But you are not off the hook.<eos> I mean, a driver's license is important.<eos> But that's not what's gonna get you a job making more than $10 an hour.<eos> 10 bucks?
On the windward side of the target.<eos> High voltage conductors.<eos> Duplexed.<eos> Two inch conduits pumping out 7,200 volts.<eos> More like 12,000 volts.

Wait, what do I do? Pull back on the rod.<eos> Start reeling, start reeling!<eos> - Wait...<eos> - Yeah, yeah!<eos> - Oh, my gosh!
"I pity the next book I pick up.<eos> End. Stop."<eos> It's a rare author that debuts to universal praise.<eos> - Bravo!<eos> - Nearly universal.
Last night at the party.<eos> Scott told me that you came to town with a trunk full of clothes from Montgomery, that's all.<eos> And when he suggested that you might want to pick up a few new things, I jumped at the chance to take you on your first trip to Ladies Mile.<eos> How sweet of you.<eos> Not half as sweet as Scott.
I have written a great book.<eos> I am a great writer.<eos> A writer that people will remember.<eos> And you know what they will remember you for?<eos> Nothing.
So off you go, Mr. Heywood Broun.<eos> Off into the great abyss of the forgotten.<eos> That's exactly why I didn't like your writing.<eos> You have such a gift for cliché.<eos> Good afternoon.
There's no guarantee that I'll be him.<eos> Of course you'll be him.<eos> That's the whole point.<eos> Townsend's already talked to the studio about it,<eos> - and after the screen test...

- Get your hands off me.<eos> - Let's go.<eos> Get...<eos> Get your predatory hands off my wife.<eos> And my novel.
Harvey insisted.<eos> She's a beauty, isn't she?<eos> Not even on sale to the public yet.<eos> Perfect for your grand entrance, Fitz.<eos> Or rather, Harvey's.

My God, is it only Saturday?<eos> - Scott... - Fitzgeralds, I really must be going.<eos> Zelda, my dear, you have quite a presence on the page.<eos> I spent hours with your book.<eos> My book?
- Uh, very nice to meet you, too.<eos> Tana has been so helpful, Daddy.<eos> Really a Godsend.<eos> He's from the Japanese Reliable Employment Agency.<eos> Japanese what?
I said Friday at 8:00 a.m. That's the deadline.<eos> Wait.<eos> What...?<eos> It's a deadline that Nathaniel's obsessed with because his rich daddy said it.<eos> Nothing.

I'm sorry, I gotta run.<eos> Can we reschedule?<eos> Sure, yeah.<eos> I got this. Go. Go.<eos> How about tomorrow for lunch?
I hired you because you're waywards, and one of the ways I like to give back is by being a beacon with waywards.<eos> Shed a little light on those less-fortunate.<eos> But I got limits, you get my message?<eos> I do.<eos> No light for the flippant.
What do you want from me, Ida?<eos> I want you to look at the picture.<eos> You want me to look at the picture.<eos> Yes.<eos> For what purpose?
Getting through an exclusion zone used to be hard, but now it's impossible.<eos> There's virtually no traffic since they shut down the labor camps.<eos> It's just one long graveyard shift.<eos> Like I tell Toby every day. Don't I?<eos> What about the VIPs?
I have an appointment.<eos> You must be Thomas Leffering, the new C.E.O.<eos> You're early.<eos> Yeah, I heard Bell was a bit of a shrew about punctuality.<eos> A shrew?
Okay.<eos> Okay, get him into the ICU to assess digits.<eos> Page Neuro, and I want an EEG.<eos> And monitor him regularly.<eos> - No problemo.
Todd Groaner, social weirdo.<eos> Always was. Always will be.<eos> Why do you think I dress up like other people, huh?<eos> It's because I want to escape this.<eos> From your limp?
What is this, Mr. Leffering?<eos> You tell me.<eos> It's your book.<eos> Good night, Dawn.<eos> Good night.
We better get going.<eos> He's gonna be coming back for this thing.<eos> What do you think he's got in there?<eos> Damn it.<eos> - Nothing here.
PNCd Michael Farmer. He's on the Sex Offenders Register.<eos> Bingo.<eos> Hold the line, please.<eos> Michael Farmer just clocked on for the night shift.<eos> Just too late for an alibi.
I went to visit my nan.<eos> Which would be where, please, Michael?<eos> At the nursing home.<eos> How long did you stay at the nursing home, please, Michael?<eos> Half-past seven till half-past eight.
Anything I can do, ma'am?<eos> Yes. Some of the forensics in the Michael Farmer case, I'd like them reprocessed.<eos> Sure.<eos> - I'll e-mail a list of which ones.<eos> - OK, no problem.
Just trying him out.<eos> That's funny.<eos> I always saw you as the lone wolf type.<eos> Bring her in.<eos> Happy hunting.
You look familiar.<eos> Yeah.<eos> You stabbed me.<eos> Oh yeah.<eos> No hard feelings.
Quota keeps going up.<eos> You are gonna be rolling in business.<eos> And who the hell is he?<eos> He wants to trade.<eos> What kind of trade?
Why? Why would you want to go back there?<eos> Look at his ankle.<eos> Come here. Come here.<eos> - What are those?<eos> - Nothing!
- She does.<eos> - People carrying on like animals.<eos> Quite, quite.<eos> But nothing like this before?<eos> No direct threat?
- Nine o'clock yesterday evening.<eos> Still light.<eos> If he was here, he would've seen him.<eos> A neighbour heard a car about three in the morning.<eos> Apart from that, nothing out of the ordinary.
You probably think Mummy's a bit of a crank.<eos> I'm sure she's... sincere.<eos> She is.<eos> How long has she been, erm...?<eos> Oh, erm, about four years.
Won't that be a bit minty?<eos> Oh, I don't mind minty.<eos> Thank you.<eos> For looking after Mummy.<eos> Oh... Not a problem.

What do we know about Reverend Golightly?<eos> Well, no family, ordained before the war, ministered all over the country.<eos> Any connection with Oxford?<eos> Brief spell as vicar of Saint Mary's ten years ago.<eos> Saint Mary's?
Literally.<eos> What a lyrical child you must have been, Sergeant!<eos> - Shouldn't have been fatal, though.<eos> - Not ordinarily, no.<eos> Certainly not to anyone in decent health.
I want to see what's beyond the door.<eos> There's something else.<eos> You just gotta find the right key.<eos> - Drugs?<eos> - Nothing heavy.
Infinite love.<eos> We're all just angels that fell from grace.<eos> Every one of us.<eos> There is no shame.<eos> No guilt.
How do you go about that?<eos> Pills, is it?<eos> Uppers?<eos> Downers?<eos> Nothing illegal.
Mr Spender, a few questions, please.<eos> Have you any idea where Nick might have come by this LSD?<eos> They smoke a little pot, all right?<eos> Mushrooms, maybe, but that's it, that's as far as it goes.<eos> Nothing heavy.
Nothing heavy.<eos> Dr Bakshi said he might not fully recover -- his wits at any rate.<eos> It's gonna hit any revenue you were hoping to make.<eos> God, it's not about the money.<eos> Not for me.
No. No.<eos> I...<eos> They fight, but they're family.<eos> Nobody would hurt Nick.<eos> OK, then, what about somebody outside the group?
What sex game?<eos> In Justine, de Sade's book, one character has another hang him to the point of unconsciousness.<eos> I think Nick experimented with the same idea.<eos> The thing is, all you had to do that night was wait.<eos> What?
The doctor will be here soon.<eos> Here! Your Jessie might have had her baby by now.<eos> We've got a book running at the Black Sail -- we all reckon it's going to be a girl.<eos> - Do you?<eos> - Yeah, most definitely.

I can't do this.<eos> You have to.<eos> Your carriage has arrived. I'll grab your bag.<eos> Goodbye.<eos> Safe journey.
- Oh, goodbye!<eos> - Thank you.<eos> Bye, old thing.<eos> (I love you.)<eos> Godspeed!
- Yes.<eos> Good news, Marnie!<eos> I've persuaded the council nursery to find afternoon places for Kevin and Mandy for the next six weeks.<eos> That came this morning.<eos> From the landlord.
A field in which men are not currently permitted to train or qualify.<eos> I would also like to draw your attention to Gretchen Elise Fruman, who appears to spring from somewhere called Vermillion, South Dakota.<eos> I thought an American would be a breath of fresh air.<eos> So no Americans.<eos> And no men.
And nursing.<eos> Being an Army Nurse makes you twice as particular.<eos> Miss Dyer, why did you resign from military service?<eos> It was all so... efficient, in a way that wasn't always good.<eos> Plenty of curing.
Being an Army Nurse makes you twice as particular.<eos> Miss Dyer, why did you resign from military service?<eos> It was all so... efficient, in a way that wasn't always good.<eos> Plenty of curing.<eos> Not quite so much caring.
And why it's still needed.<eos> Desperately.<eos> So... how long do we have and what are we going to do about it?<eos> They haven't given us much notice, I'm afraid.<eos> A little over a week.
I am as they made me.<eos> Who made you?<eos> What have they told you?<eos> That you were the first?<eos> The first cerebral salvage.
I see her in so many young women.<eos> On the street, in my dreams.<eos> As if she's still here.<eos> She was... fearless.<eos> And wild.
What are you waiting? Stop the music! Quickly--<eos> Stop it!<eos> Everybody, hands up!<eos> Now!<eos> On the floor!
You should be traveling the world. Hmm.<eos> I've never actually been outside the country.<eos> It almost happened after high school but I had to get a job answering phones at a car dealership and my supposed friends couldn't wait.<eos> So now I find myself thinking that this guy... You, guy seem like the kind of person who, in fact, did not have to get a job at Lukazey's Toyota and has been to Europe or some such and knows where one goes to...<eos> To what?
What?<eos> What?<eos> What?<eos> Sorry, why am I here?<eos> Not that.
What the heck crawled up her ass?<eos> Yeah, no kidding.<eos> I'd be pretty stoked if some random guy tapped my car just to get into my pants.<eos> My, my, my, my, my, my, my My angel lover Oh, Christ, I haven't done this in a long time.<eos> Me, neither.
I'm always worrying what other people are thinking and second guessing every single little thing.<eos> Well, you know, I wish I'd have started this years ago.<eos> I spent so much time pining after my ex and moping like an idiot.<eos> I'm ready for... a real relationship.<eos> Someone with a... kind heart and an open demeanor and a gentle spirit...
I looked like a fungus.<eos> So, did you hear from your mother?<eos> You know, she's run off to Australia with her N.A. sponsor.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Tucker.
- Cheers, Mike!<eos> What is this about, Jack?<eos> Rebel graffiti.<eos> A young boy.<eos> Your boy.
And they want you to! They want you to!<eos> So that he could reach the unknown.<eos> He experimented.<eos> They scare you with names.<eos> Like wickedness.
I'm not sure they'll hear you through the storm.<eos> They can be quite severe... shielding the whole planet.<eos> How long do the storms usually last?<eos> Days.<eos> Weeks.

He gave his life to save me.<eos> To bring me back.<eos> Yes, Jennifer.<eos> He found his redemption.<eos> But at great cost.
Now, let's launch this bad boy.<eos> Wait.<eos> Remember, this strange river may hold untold surprises.<eos> - We must be cautious.<eos> - Cautious.
We must make sure we always...<eos> Pay attention to the...<eos> Rate of speed of the...<eos> Okay, and we are off.<eos> Heave-ho!
I can feel the power.<eos> Check out my wizard mane.<eos> Really, man?<eos> When I'm through with these Smurfs, I'll have all the power I've ever dreamed of!<eos> Almost all the power.
Do not worry.<eos> It is only yellow warning.<eos> The red alert is the most dangerous.<eos> Can I talk to someone else?<eos> - With whom?
Partly because of your health insurance, And partly.<eos> Because it is difficult to get kidneys.<eos> Yes, everyone clings to both of them.<eos> Have you spoken to your daughter?<eos> With your friends?
Why did you answer the phone?<eos> Because he was ringing.<eos> Because you're interested.<eos> Have you become my psychiatrist now?<eos> But closer to a fortune-teller.
This is what is written.<eos> I worked for that damned company 40 years, Now they will steal our pension funds.<eos> Take it from here, I'm not hungry.<eos> Would you take him home?<eos> As an external request?
I will do, young man.<eos> See you later, Dad.<eos> I was bothering you Long ago, "Murphy".<eos> I think I deserved it.<eos> Most often.
To clap the bride and their names!<eos> I will adjust my expectations, Joey.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> I may live another twenty years.<eos> Not with college "Al".

- Well, maybe so.<eos> There must be more than this provincial life<eos> Good morning<eos> Just watch I'm going to make Belle my wife Oh!<eos> Good morning
No. No.<eos> No.<eos> Actually... yes, that's exactly what I need.<eos> - Papa, do you think I'm odd?<eos> - Odd?
Well, of course he can talk.<eos> It's all he ever does.<eos> Now, Lumiere, as head of the household... I demand that you put her back in her cell at once.<eos> What do you want to be for the rest of your life, Cogsworth?<eos> A man, or a mantle clock?
You see?<eos> There she is.<eos> Now, remember, be gentle.<eos> - Kind!<eos> - Charming!

We're leaving tomorrow before dawn.<eos> We're gonna cross the border.<eos> It's a safe haven.<eos> Same coordinates?<eos> Yes, between noon and 5:00.
I was so afraid that you wouldn't make it.<eos> - Are you okay?<eos> - What happened to you?<eos> I... I got into a little bit of a fight.<eos> With who?
- What happened to you?<eos> I... I got into a little bit of a fight.<eos> With who?<eos> You look like hell!<eos> - With another teacher.
It was an accident.<eos> It could have happened to any of us.<eos> You know how she...<eos> Tessa said that she found Lily talking to some guy she'd never met before.<eos> What guy?
We are the only salvation.<eos> The blackest of their dirt deeds bind them to us.<eos> No.<eos> No.<eos> Not to us, no.
Oh, I see, yes.<eos> Looks very... fully functioning.<eos> Is that really the best you can do?<eos> Sorry, I've never been very good with them.<eos> Babies?

Master Bun, it's not a set without him.<eos> How many more times, Mr Sherlock?<eos> Hmm, maybe it's because I'm not familiar with the concept.<eos> Oh, hi, Mary.<eos> What concept?
'Remember?<eos> And a codeword.'<eos> "Ammo," yes, you said.<eos> How's your Latin, brother dear?<eos> My Latin?
You can't get to the north end in three days.<eos> It's impossible.<eos> That's it.<eos> No way.<eos> At least not on foot.
Now, follow me, and we'll get off this rock alive.<eos> Dear Billy...<eos> I'm just trying to get home to you and your mom.<eos> You be strong, now.<eos> Much love.
A signature in human destruction.<eos> Ultimately, for full satisfaction, it requires plain sight.<eos> Additionally, serial killers are easily profiled.<eos> They tend to be social outcasts.<eos> -Educationally sub-normal.
New information, she's out.<eos> That's not possible.<eos> It's more than possible, she was John's therapist.<eos> Shot me during a session.<eos> Only with a tranquiliser.
- Keep your distance.<eos> Stay at least three feet away from the glass and all that.<eos> - Why the headphones?<eos> - She doesn't stop playing.<eos> Sometimes for weeks.
We had to try.<eos> At what cost?<eos> Happiness is a pop song.<eos> Sadness is a poem.<eos> What cost?
In return, however, she requires treats.<eos> - Last year it was a violin.<eos> - This year?<eos> Five minutes unsupervised conversation...<eos> With you.
- Last year it was a violin.<eos> - This year?<eos> Five minutes unsupervised conversation...<eos> With you.<eos> Me?

No, we're not competing.<eos> There's a plane in the air that's gonna crash.<eos> So what we're doing is actually trying to save a little girl.<eos> Today we have to be soldiers, Mycroft.<eos> Soldiers.
You've told us that our daughter was dead.<eos> Better that than tell you what she had become.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Whatever she became, whatever she is now, Mycroft, she remains our daughter.<eos> And my sister.
But I clearly remember... the baby was delivered in a taxi.<eos> What the...<eos> Tim, look who's here.<eos> Meet your new baby brother.<eos> Baby what?
What the...<eos> Tim, look who's here.<eos> Meet your new baby brother.<eos> Baby what?<eos> Brother.
Well, you need a break.<eos> I'll stay with the baby, and you...<eos> Maybe the baby should decide.<eos> Who do you want to stay with you?<eos> Daddy or Mommy?
Yes, you are.<eos> Yes, you are.<eos> Trust me, one day you're gonna get to know this little guy... and you are gonna love him with all of your heart.<eos> Just like we do.<eos> All of your heart?
Like another file.<eos> Yes!<eos> A file with the same weight.<eos> So it can be placed in the exact same position.<eos> With the exact same weight.
You're our hero.<eos> And a great big brother.<eos> We love you both so much.<eos> Both of us?<eos> With all our heart.
The cost of transgression is death.<eos> We thank you, Guardians, for putting your lives on the line.<eos> We could not risk the lives of our own Sovereign citizens.<eos> Every citizen is born exactly as designed by the community.<eos> Impeccable, both physically and mentally.
You're the one what killed those men... by leading them down the wrong path.<eos> Because you're weak.<eos> And stupid!<eos> It's time for the Ravagers... to rise once again to glory with a new captain...<eos> Taserface!
This is Sam Cooke... one of the greatest Earth singers of all time.<eos> Drax thinks you're not a dancer.<eos> If you ever tell anyone about this... I will kill you.<eos> When are we gonna do something about this unspoken thing between us?<eos> What unspoken thing?

Where have you been, Ben?<eos> Yeah, my new legally sanctioned business is tripling our revenue.<eos> Is that Mother's hat?<eos> Hello. I'd like to see Sheriff Truman.<eos> Which one?
Yeah, my new legally sanctioned business is tripling our revenue.<eos> Is that Mother's hat?<eos> Hello. I'd like to see Sheriff Truman.<eos> Which one?<eos> Which one?
He's coming.<eos> I have to get off the phone.<eos> Hi, baby.<eos> Who you talking to?<eos> Um, Jack.
Yes, Coop.<eos> I, too, have missed our good times together.<eos> Where have you been all these years?<eos> Gordon, I've been working undercover all these years, working primarily with our colleague<eos> Phillip Jeffries.
You and I'll have a talk sometime.<eos> You and I will have a talk.<eos> Okay?<eos> Okay.<eos> Cheers.
No cigar.<eos> Taking medical leave.<eos> Oh, please tell me he's still here.<eos> Is he in there?<eos> All right, towards me.
Uh-huh. Yes.<eos> What sort of things do you write about?<eos> Different things.<eos> Approximately two weeks ago, did you write an entry about encountering what you described as an alternate reality?<eos> A different dimension.
And when I take over Gotham City...<eos> Opening reactor core doors.<eos> ...Batman will grovel at the feet of his greatest enemy!<eos> Me!<eos> The Joker!
That was unnecessary.<eos> Oh, no, you can't fight Bane anymore either.<eos> Really?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Or Riddler.
Oh, no, you can't fight Bane anymore either.<eos> Really?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Or Riddler.<eos> Or Catwoman. Or Condiment King.
Fine.<eos> Who am I working with?<eos> SEAL Team Six?<eos> Fox Force Five?<eos> Suicide Squad?
SEAL Team Six?<eos> Fox Force Five?<eos> Suicide Squad?<eos> No.<eos> Me.
So... what makes you think Ward tried to kill you?<eos> Which, by the way, sounds preposterous.<eos> Your security guy came after me.<eos> With two other guys.<eos> - With guns.
It's the 21st century.<eos> We're all connected.<eos> Chodak and Tashi.<eos> And who were they?<eos> Monks.
You know how to make a vodka tonic?<eos> Well... if it's just vodka and tonic, then, yeah.<eos> I think I can handle it.<eos> I'll get it.<eos> Um, light on the tonic.
That's pretty close.<eos> He was a good kid.<eos> He was kind.<eos> If you would've told me that one day he would fight off men with axes...<eos> Hatchets.
It's Rand.<eos> Some bad people have gotten on the inside.<eos> Criminals.<eos> They're using the company as a cover to conduct their own business.<eos> What kind of business?
I don't know what's going on here, but I do know that we have a problem, and I need you in your right mind to help me figure out how to correct it.<eos> Shouldn't listen to Joy.<eos> Why are you doing this to yourself, Ward?<eos> Doing it to him.<eos> Who?
This is my choice.<eos> I don't know who this guy was or where he came from.<eos> But he could fight.<eos> I'm telling you, he punched through solid metal with his bare hands.<eos> His hands?
I've mastered everything.<eos> Not everything.<eos> What else is there?<eos> You have yet to face the most cunning opponent of them all.<eos> The Hand.
Was I supposed to let her die?<eos> What?<eos> What are you saying?<eos> Who were you talking to?<eos> No one.
Manipulating as always.<eos> Working an angle.<eos> Trying to get me to question everything.<eos> Even you.<eos> In what way?
- Oh, it really hurts.<eos> Why don't you do something to take your mind off of it?<eos> Like, explain to me where the hell you and Colleen went after I saw you get taken away at the dojo by some mystery man.<eos> And why you just showed up at my door, bleeding,<eos> - with a completely different mystery man.

- So you wanna run Rand like Gao. - No.<eos> No, not like Gao.<eos> She's all stick and no carrot.<eos> I want you in charge, because Harold has become...<eos> - Goddamn dangerous.
- What's that?<eos> A legend.<eos> Trained me. Trained Dean, too.<eos> He's coming for us.<eos> - For your bodies.
He comes back home every night at 6:30.<eos> - But lately, he's...<eos> - He's been different?<eos> Secretive?<eos> - Maybe even a little nervous?
Franklin, I need a word.<eos> See you later.<eos> How's your case load?<eos> I need you to keep an eye on something.<eos> - Happy to.
- I told you to stay away.<eos> - Mr. Raymond, trust me.<eos> Right now, I wish I'd listened.<eos> Are you working with them?<eos> With who?
You just can't help but wonder.<eos> The woman who lived in this vessel, she was lost before she came to us.<eos> She was led astray by men who were afraid of what she was, of what she was capable of doing.<eos> But destiny is a curious thing, because this vessel landed right where it belongs.<eos> With us.

He's dead.<eos> At least the last time I saw him.<eos> Finally, some good news.<eos> Who's the last one?<eos> Murakami.
We have our weapon.<eos> Let's talk about your weapon.<eos> What did you do to her?<eos> What did you do to Elektra?<eos> Elektra?
He was a member of the Hand.<eos> An organization formed by lying psychopaths.<eos> You can't trust a word he said.<eos> I understand that, Danny, but the way I see it, we only have one move.<eos> Whoa.
Thank you.<eos> I like it here.<eos> Back in New York?<eos> No.<eos> Back with you.
Your position is one of great power.<eos> But it is a burden as much as a blessing.<eos> Which is why I've convinced the others to follow your lead.<eos> You and I have always understood each other.<eos> Under a single condition.
Trust me, I'd face a dragon over Jessica Jones any day.<eos> What happened between you two?<eos> We had a moment.<eos> But we both had to go on our different paths, so we...<eos> Different paths?
You're counting exits... guards...<eos> Could you get to me in time?<eos> How would you do it, I wonder?<eos> That woman's pen?<eos> His cane?
How would you do it, I wonder?<eos> That woman's pen?<eos> His cane?<eos> Maybe his glasses?<eos> My hands.
Tapered.<eos> How about the lining?<eos> Tactical.<eos> AR-15, 11.5-inch. Compensated with an ion-bonded bolt carrier.<eos> Trijicon accupoint with one-six magnification.
Sure is..<eos> - Elena's gone.<eos> - Like gone gone?<eos> I'm done.<eos> The business, everything..
Who did this to me?<eos> Have you got your front door keys?<eos> All right, sweetheart?<eos> Do you live by yourself, Trish?<eos> Leah, my daughter.
Sorry if we're inconveniencing you.<eos> We couldn't find drag marks or footprints.<eos> You might have more luck.<eos> See if you can find any evidence of her attacker having a hiding place<eos> - near the house.
It's unclear whether her attacker was known to her.<eos> Myself and DS Miller took her to the SARC in Poole last night.<eos> We're awaiting preliminary forensics and SOCO are starting work at the scene now.<eos> - When did she report this?<eos> - Last night.
I don't know.<eos> Is it like the problems Mom worked on?<eos> Your mother didn't work on problems.<eos> She worked on just one problem.<eos> Just one?
Why are you so mad all of a sudden?<eos> I'm not mad.<eos> I'm annoyed.<eos> Not with you, dear.<eos> With that pompous ass, Shankland.
About a week before your sister took her life... what were you doing for a living then?<eos> I was a teacher.<eos> You're being modest, aren't you?<eos> You were a professor at Boston University... isn't that right?<eos> Yes, well, Assistant Professor.
And mankind?<eos> Mankind is another story altogether.<eos> What one does when faced with truth.. is more difficult than you think.<eos> I learned this the hard way.<eos> A long long time ago.
It is, isn't it?<eos> Yes, yeah.<eos> Is this what people do when there are no wars to fight?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, this... and other things.
Yes, yeah.<eos> Is this what people do when there are no wars to fight?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, this... and other things.<eos> What things?
The villagers!<eos> What they cheering for?<eos> Diana!<eos> What did they fire?<eos> The gas.
Yeah.<eos> I got one.<eos> How about we just stop them ourselves?<eos> You're talking about a Russian military base.<eos> Separatist.
You have a lot to answer for, Cipher.<eos> What you've put my family through.<eos> My mother.<eos> I'm gonna make sure that never happens again.<eos> To anyone.
You present yourself as an agent of the free states of America, like a good little sheep.<eos> But long since, you've been dangled in front of the King of England by the East India Company.<eos> Now you're scrabbling, desperate.<eos> Pulling your wool over everybody's eyes.<eos> Possibly even your own.
Felice Adventurero sold for Â£800 to...?<eos> The Delaney Nootka Trading Company.<eos> I spoke to old Grady afterwards.<eos> He said Delaney told him he was going to use the ship for trade.<eos> With whom?
Post for you, madam.<eos> I intend to begin by reading your father's last will and testament, and then I shall try to reason with his creditors.<eos> Have you decided yet what you will do with Nootka?<eos> Yes, I will use it for trade.<eos> With whom?
You have ash on your hands.<eos> Where is the maid?<eos> I sent her out.<eos> For champagne?<eos> Or potatoes?
A treaty.<eos> That is all.<eos> A treaty between my father and the Nootka Indian tribe.<eos> A treaty in which Nootka land was bought for gunpowder... and lies!<eos> Along with my mother.
Come.<eos> Mr. George Chichester, Esquire.<eos> I don't.<eos> In the day?<eos> Or the night.
You witnessed the division of the gunpowder and you heard its destination.<eos> Yes, I did, sir.<eos> And you were both being paid for your services by James Keziah Delaney himself?<eos> In gold.<eos> And silver.
They will allow no easy escape... to death.<eos> Since it is imperative that we keep you alive until after your conviction for treason, the doctor is here to help and assist Mr. Arrow, who will do most of the necessary work.<eos> Although, for some tasks, he will need helpers with strong hands.<eos> And together, they will walk you along a tightrope.<eos> A line between life... and death.
Of course.<eos> And there was I thinking that we were just brothers in arms.<eos> Didn't we share a bed sometimes in the great hall?<eos> It was torture.<eos> Exquisite.
I dreamt about killing that douglas jones fuck.<eos> I just hate him so bad.<eos> I can't wait to kill this guy.<eos> Can you last three more hours?<eos> Barely.
I haven't got a clue.<eos> She was supposed to show last night.<eos> She didn't show then either.<eos> She might be with Clark.<eos> Clark?
- Do it!<eos> - Hey. - It's okay.<eos> I got you, I got you, I got you...<eos> The plan was to be you.<eos> With Wren.
It's about Toby, isn't it?<eos> He settled for Yvonne.<eos> We both know that.<eos> And now he's free to be with his one true love.<eos> Me.
Google says China. 1976.<eos> Properly Google says.<eos> The most terrible event in human history.<eos> It occurs when it is faced with something...<eos> Unknown.

We have all lost loved ones and friends.<eos> But despite the bitterness of loss, you can not give in to anger.<eos> You can not.<eos> People have been waiting for thousands of years... contact.<eos> With an alien civilization.
Car keys.<eos> Fast!<eos> Come on!<eos> The keys!<eos> Behind me.
Put the bag down.<eos> I assume that was a joke.<eos> My name is Captain Badi Bassim.<eos> I'm here to start work with General McMahon.<eos> - Who?

Ed didn't go and he's doing all right.<eos> Yeah, but Ed studied computer engineering.<eos> Do you want to be a computer engineer?<eos> And Dad... he never went and he seems perfectly happy in life.<eos> Career-wise.
So far, the only thing I know about Canaan is where it is.<eos> That's all we need to know.<eos> Scott, Malia and Lydia are going out to Canaan.<eos> He said to go through with the plan as long as it doesn't destroy his house.<eos> What plan?
That's all we need to know.<eos> Scott, Malia and Lydia are going out to Canaan.<eos> He said to go through with the plan as long as it doesn't destroy his house.<eos> What plan?<eos> Your plan.
How do you stop the unstoppable?<eos> How is your Kampfgruppe going to stop them?<eos> Tell us.<eos> How are you going to perform this miracle?<eos> With German efficiency.
Lightning will just bounce off it.<eos> Which is the same reason it'll hold him in.<eos> If the Ghost Rider lands here, how do we get him in the cage?<eos> We have to lure him in.<eos> - Bait?
Listen, I remember something.<eos> At the start of the year, Stiles was trying to find a place for you guys to live after graduation.<eos> He said you were getting an apartment together?<eos> And I remember saying something to Stiles. Something like it's not always a good idea to live with your friends.<eos> Even your best friend.
I told you to stop doing this.<eos> And I told you to stop lifting with your back and go to the doctor.<eos> I'm fine.<eos> You went to see her, didn't you?<eos> Kare.
You wouldn't be so eager to reach that conclusion if you remembered.<eos> Enough<eos> How far along are you?<eos> Aren't they supposed to be... what's that word?<eos> Chast?
That field is heavy with dew-frost.<eos> It's going to snow tonight.<eos> That's all it means.<eos> You're here for a few days, you're contradicting my most talented councilwoman.<eos> Second most talented.
She's exactly what I'm looking for.<eos> Strong, spirited, vigorous.<eos> Come with me.<eos> You'll be treated with the utmost respect.<eos> Respect, yes.
I can't be responsible for my actions if I was not myself.<eos> Then don't come back until you are.<eos> Where is your baby's father?<eos> Murdered by the Wizaed.<eos> The Wizaed?
- But they aren't who we came for.<eos> - Where is he?<eos> The wizard.<eos> - Gone to ev.<eos> With our army.
That was it.<eos> My God.<eos> But he gave me my Ziggy, so...<eos> Have you talked to anybody about this?<eos> Like a therapist or a counselor or someone?
Are you still working for the man?<eos> I was. About that, we have a problem here.<eos> A...<eos> A problem with me? No.<eos> Not with you, you.
That's Dre.<eos> - Dre ?<eos> Andre Hayworth.<eos> Used to kick it with Veronica?<eos> - Veronica from wh...?
I'm clean.<eos> - Me too.<eos> Go on, call. It's the only phone with a signal.<eos> If you say you didn't touch him, maybe they'll listen to you.<eos> - With a handkerchief.
Look at me, look at me.<eos> You're fixating.<eos> - My clothes are burning!<eos> - Take them off!<eos> - Not in front of them!
- Kathryn!<eos> - What?<eos> You and I spent time together when you were on the road when we were their age, and Toby is living in England with his girlfriend and baby, so...<eos> That's different.<eos> All: How?
- Totally.<eos> - What is it again?<eos> - #NeverForget.<eos> What the hell are you doing?<eos> Nothing.
I'm sorry about that.<eos> Geometry with Bates.<eos> No wonder you're in a hurry.<eos> - Oh, you have him, too?<eos> - Fifth period.
How early did you have to get up?<eos> Yesterday?<eos> We won't do the full spread every day, but it's nice to start off right.<eos> So, how'd your project end up last night?<eos> With Tony.
What is depicted on the giant painting they just hung on that wall?<eos> Uh. It's a... giant bleeding man?<eos> Or squid?<eos> Or man-squid.<eos> Uh... In spring.
My dad would freak.<eos> Yeah, my mom might, but my dad's a cop, so as long as I stand up straight and pass P.E., go shooting with him...<eos> Wait, your dad's a cop?<eos> And you go shooting with him?<eos> With guns?
I'm some stupid girl who gets all worked up over a little thing.<eos> But little things matter.<eos> For instance, you never told me when you started dating Jessica.<eos> But I remember just how it ended.<eos> With your list.
You've never been a girl.<eos> It's good.<eos> We just need to work on structure, and you use the word "unique," like, seven times.<eos> If one thing is unique, the other six things should probably be, um...<eos> - ... something else.
And whatever they're offering you, they're lying.<eos> You lied to me.<eos> You lied about where you were last night.<eos> I saw you.<eos> With your brothers.
I feel I saw you guys fighting recently.<eos> Well, that's true.<eos> We're not afraid of confrontation, but at the end of the day, we always know whose side we're on.<eos> How's that history project going?<eos> With the cassettes.
Thank you, Theresa.<eos> Courtney Crimsen.<eos> What a pretty name.<eos> And what a pretty girl.<eos> With her perfect family.
I wanted to talk to you.<eos> I mean, we were in this together... weren't we?<eos> Hey.<eos> That seat's taken.<eos> Yeah, by me.
You look good.<eos> Hey.<eos> Hey.<eos> Who'd you come here with?<eos> Oh, just Courtney.
Hey.<eos> Hey.<eos> Who'd you come here with?<eos> Oh, just Courtney.<eos> And her court.
Do you know anything about any kids getting bullied at your school?<eos> Why, did someone call you?<eos> No.<eos> I'm asking whether you knew if Hannah Baker was bullied.<eos> Why Hannah Baker?
How is Zach?<eos> Well, he's just great.<eos> Every college is looking at him for basketball, but... he wants to be a marine biologist.<eos> Can you believe it?<eos> A marine biologist.
Well, he's just great.<eos> Every college is looking at him for basketball, but... he wants to be a marine biologist.<eos> Can you believe it?<eos> A marine biologist.<eos> A marine biologist.
Trust me.<eos> So that guy Brad... is he your boyfriend now?<eos> I hope he's still my boyfriend.<eos> He's been pretty annoyed lately because... I've been spending all my time with another guy.<eos> You.
Then how did it happen?<eos> I hooked up with my boyfriend.<eos> - With Justin.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> With Justin.
And under ours, too.<eos> Andy, sweetie... you don't win a chess match by giving away your strategy, honey.<eos> I'm trying to fight back here!<eos> I thought that's what you wanted.<eos> Not like this.
More cuddles.<eos> Come on, it's cold tonight.<eos> You always warm me up.<eos> How about... you cuddle with widdle Justin?<eos> Little Justin!
If it's strictly coincidental, then why is he watching us?<eos> I mean, he does take an interest in my social life.<eos> Uh-huh.<eos> So... you tutor him in academics, and he tutors you in...<eos> Girls.
I mean, he does take an interest in my social life.<eos> Uh-huh.<eos> So... you tutor him in academics, and he tutors you in...<eos> Girls.<eos> Girl.

- Reunite with Hannah forever?<eos> - Fuck you, Tony.<eos> You think you could have changed anything?<eos> What does that make you?<eos> God?
You're gonna get grease in the water.<eos> Think of it as a moisturizing spa treatment.<eos> I read that pepperoni oil reduces cellulite.<eos> I read that too, except it only works mixed with cheese.<eos> And tomato sauce.
How the fuck do you think?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Do you need to... talk to somebody?<eos> See somebody?<eos> Who?
About... me and Hannah Baker?<eos> Hannah Baker made these tapes before she died.<eos> Saying what we all did to her.<eos> What you did.<eos> To Jessica.
Hannah Baker made these tapes before she died.<eos> Saying what we all did to her.<eos> What you did.<eos> To Jessica.<eos> To Jessica?
Heh. Think you can play tricks with me?<eos> Who is this Akuma?<eos> Something familiar about...<eos> No!<eos> Shinigami!
Hattori Tatsu!<eos> You stole my Foot Soldiers.<eos> It's true!<eos> You have become one of them...<eos> A freak!
[both grunting] [panting] It's like fighting Shredder.<eos> But he's still blind.<eos> Tatsu was using you, just like the Shredder, tarnishing the name of the Foot Clan for his own glory.<eos> The Foot deserves a noble destiny...<eos> One with honor.
Okay.<eos> Follow me.<eos> Before we go in, you have a brain and a backbone, so I'm talking to you, not Gregory.<eos> Whatever you're trying to start here, another protection pact, a trade, none of it matters if we don't start dealing with the real problem...<eos> The Saviors.
That's who taught me about bombs.<eos> Survivalist, prepper-type shit.<eos> Marcus taught me about cars.<eos> He was a mechanic... and a wannabe stunt driver.<eos> And an asshole.
Then I'd outgrow them and bounce.<eos> The sex was just for fun.<eos> When the world's over, everyone should be getting their rocks off.<eos> Was that how it was with him?<eos> Abraham?
I do feel bad.<eos> I will.<eos> Tara... you don't have to.<eos> You need to cover this with a tarp.<eos> A tarp?
I will.<eos> Tara... you don't have to.<eos> You need to cover this with a tarp.<eos> A tarp?<eos> Tarp.
Say yes.<eos> Yes.<eos> They're out there, so I'm gonna be there with you.<eos> We are.<eos> Package deal.
Look, I-I'm not proud to share this, but the truth is,<eos> I just kept crawling, and it kept working.<eos> Oh, I'm glad you're okay.<eos> Are we ever going to stop paying for indulging your father?<eos> Our children, our planet, our jobs?
Drunk Rick's point is that none of you are very special or different.<eos> That's always his point.<eos> Let's just get through this as quickly as possible.<eos> Then we'll deal with the two of you.<eos> The two of us?
- But small, only like 10 people.<eos> - Ah but you went?<eos> - We had some meetings.<eos> - The next day.<eos> Potential investors.
Just saying.<eos> Y'know. Bit of background.<eos> Right.<eos> Do you want to do it?<eos> With me.
I seen you.<eos> Before.<eos> Before you was Long.<eos> Now... they say you're supposed to be a pirate king.<eos> A strongman.
You just said it's too far to outrun him.<eos> To Philadelphia it's too far, but I can make safe harbor somewhere nearer.<eos> Outrun for a day, pull him away from here, then seek shelter in a friendly port strong enough to prevent his entry.<eos> Meanwhile... the door will be open for you to reach your grandfather and gain his aid.<eos> Why you?
And one day, you are going to look back at this... probably pretty soon... and think, "What the fuck was I thinking?<eos> Why was I gonna fuck up my life like that?"<eos> Must be nice to be so right.<eos> - I'm not right!<eos> - So perfect.
We have no choice but to leave the island.<eos> No one is leaving anything.<eos> We came here to take Nassau. We leave once that is done or not at all.<eos> Take Nassau?<eos> With what army?
We came here to take Nassau. We leave once that is done or not at all.<eos> Take Nassau?<eos> With what army?<eos> Whatever slaves are still alive on this island will never fight alongside a pirate again.<eos> - Not after last night.
She and Noah are going back to Mapleton.<eos> What?<eos> Well, when?<eos> Now.<eos> Tonight.
Then we get him to take his money back and forget he ever met us.<eos> How's Stella?<eos> Yeah, she's good.<eos> You think I was too hard on him?<eos> Irv?
How's Stella?<eos> Yeah, she's good.<eos> You think I was too hard on him?<eos> Irv?<eos> Ray.
We're not... We dropped a 200-pound AC on an ex-con, and, yeah, it looks like the cover-up's working, but there's a long way to go before we're out of the woods here.<eos> What the heck?<eos> There's something wrong with your chi.<eos> The what's that?<eos> Like, your energy flow.
Here's the duck, played by the oboe.<eos> The cat, by the clarinet.<eos> The bassoon will represent grandfather.<eos> The blast of the hunter's shotguns, played by the kettledrums.<eos> The wolf, by the French horns.
I just talked to her.<eos> Which, I'm sure, was enlightening for her, but without all the proper nuance.<eos> See, I got a paper grid that lays out all the inter-related parties delineating their personal and professional relationship to the murders.<eos> It's a substantial document.<eos> "Murders," plural?
Or maybe you think I'm your conscience.<eos> How's that story, the Ghost of Christmas Past?<eos> I...<eos> You came back for a reason, I'm thinking.<eos> The gun.
Maybe we can talk about Ray.<eos> What he liked, who he was.<eos> Coconut.<eos> I like coconut cream pie.<eos> With chocolate flakes on top.
Anything I can...<eos> That patch on your coat, does it say "us marshal"?<eos> - No, sir.<eos> - Well then, we'll call you when we find out, either way.<eos> - Either?
That patch on your coat, does it say "us marshal"?<eos> - No, sir.<eos> - Well then, we'll call you when we find out, either way.<eos> - Either?<eos> - Dead or alive.
Sit.<eos> You know how I describe you when I meet with my bankers and hedge fund managers?<eos> A hero.<eos> Clear of mind.<eos> A man of singular purpose.
And tell me.<eos> How do you think that's going to play out from a strategist's point of view?<eos> Well, there's a 60% chance that briefcase is full of your dirty underwear.<eos> And since I don't see your associate, I figure he's out there somewhere watching us.<eos> Maybe even with a rifle.
Look around.<eos> Nice.<eos> There, you see,<eos> I'm guessing the wildcat regional was an amateur affair.<eos> Semi-professional.
Which is, if I had to define it, the way I feel most days.<eos> Come on now.<eos> And the other days, if I'm being honest, how I feel is...<eos> Invisible.<eos> Or not invisible.
Come on now.<eos> And the other days, if I'm being honest, how I feel is...<eos> Invisible.<eos> Or not invisible.<eos> Unreal.
Meanwhile, the whole room stinks like cheese farts.<eos> I think I know that governor.<eos> Teddy the detector, this guy was not!<eos> Who?<eos> Teddy the detector!
That's right.<eos> Well, you can guess how I feel about your advice.<eos> I'm an old spy, Madame.<eos> I trust old friends.<eos> New ones?
Simone, do you know where he is?<eos> No.<eos> But I do know him.<eos> She was seeing him on the side.<eos> All very secret.
Right there in front of him.<eos> Huggies.<eos> White wrapper.<eos> Right there.<eos> Right there, right in front of you.
He said what an embarrassment it would be if anyone found out.<eos> Well, I don't get it, then.<eos> You're saying he's the enemy?<eos> Not on this.<eos> Not on Iran.
Went downhill from there.<eos> How was yours?<eos> What happened to me?<eos> Apparently, you had a seizure.<eos> No, before that.
What happened to me?<eos> Apparently, you had a seizure.<eos> No, before that.<eos> Uh, you got into an altercation at the hospital yesterday, and we agreed it might be a good idea for you to come live here for a little while.<eos> No. Before that.
Will somebody please tell me what just happened?<eos> You got out.<eos> - I can see that.<eos> But... - You got out on one condition.<eos> - What?
Goodbye, Saul.<eos> Goodbye.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Shalom.<eos> Shalom.
Because it's the right thing to do.<eos> Because this whole country went stupid-crazy after 9/11, and no one knows that better than I do.<eos> What now?<eos> Tovah will be here in the morning.<eos> In the morning.
I'll be on the couch.<eos> Thanks, Max.<eos> I'll start installing the security system in the morning.<eos> Good night.<eos> Night.
That year, from here to here, I spent smoking meth and masturbating.<eos> What sent you into this tailspin?<eos> Can you tell me that?<eos> I was... working.<eos> Overseas.
I've gone off on vacation somewhere, off the grid.<eos> They need to reach me immediately.<eos> Do I have a favorite place I like to go, somewhere I've always dreamed of going?<eos> And then, it will get uglier.<eos> "Uglier"?
- Madam President-elect.<eos> - Rob.<eos> - Joint Chiefs are already here.<eos> - What about breakfast?<eos> Between Agriculture and Housing and Urban Development.
- Who did Dar Adal send?<eos> - Nobody.<eos> What about the guy you were talking to in the supermarket?<eos> - What?<eos> Who?
You know, the first time we were supposed to get married,<eos> I, um... well, we got into a car accident, and I ended up in a coma for eight months.<eos> And when I woke up, I could talk to, um...<eos> Dead people?<eos> Spirits.
Mm, he's clutching his abdomen.<eos> That's because she slugged him there.<eos> - Congratulations, by the way.<eos> - Why?<eos> - Fellowship Award.
Do it this afternoon. It's just... you know, doesn't show up for dinner. And he fucks up with Denon.<eos> What was the destination of the walk you were on when you were attacked?<eos> Walking.<eos> Just enjoying your beautiful sights, your castles, with my friend John.<eos> John?
What was the destination of the walk you were on when you were attacked?<eos> Walking.<eos> Just enjoying your beautiful sights, your castles, with my friend John.<eos> John?<eos> Lakeman.
Am I grasping it, Matt?<eos> Have you even talked to Kevin?<eos> I left him a few messages.<eos> He hasn't called me back yet.<eos> What about Nora?
Have you even talked to Kevin?<eos> I left him a few messages.<eos> He hasn't called me back yet.<eos> What about Nora?<eos> Nora?
What did he specifically say that leads you to believe he's delusional?<eos> Did he see something or someone?<eos> Did... did she tell you?<eos> She said he was upset.<eos> Upset about what, exactly?
To pray.<eos> Okay.<eos> Well, we'll be at the bar.<eos> If you can't find us, just look for the orgy.<eos> God speed.
I need to find some people.<eos> Five kids...<eos> Liam, Abigail, Samantha, David, and Jimmy Playford.<eos> I also need to talk to a woman named Evangeline Murphy and a man...<eos> Christopher Sunday.
- Room clear!<eos> - Go, go, go!<eos> This way.<eos> Follow me.<eos> On me.
I want her back at CTU.<eos> We'll work on her there.<eos> Okay.<eos> On my way.<eos> With me.
Please, listen to me.<eos> You can't do this.<eos> I already told you, Papa.<eos> I'm going to teach the infidels a lesson.<eos> Infidels?
I can't see anything.<eos> - Get those launches away. - Aye.<eos> - Is Flint among them?<eos> - I think so.<eos> By the dunes.
I wasn't able to say good-bye to her... so I don't know what she would've wanted me to say to you right now... if anything at all.<eos> She and I... we'd become close.<eos> So, I think I have some sense of what it might've been.<eos> She was curious.<eos> And strong.
I believe that.<eos> I trust it.<eos> Do you?<eos> I've heard you were with her.<eos> With Eleanor.
When men are motivated by steak, nothing will stand in their way.<eos> We stockpiled condiments from the dining hall for a month to make the sauce.<eos> You see some action over there?<eos> I was a 68-Whiskey in Afghanistan.<eos> Uh, a combat medic.
- Bay, wait!<eos> - I cannot believe that I was beating myself up over breaking the girl code when you blew it to smithereens!<eos> Well, wait a second, a lot happened the last year.<eos> - You were in China.<eos> - Yeah, with Travis.
She's working her way back.<eos> But we finally got her out of the wheelchair for a little bit last week.<eos> I'm so sorry I wasn't here for you.<eos> You were in China.<eos> With your ex-boyfriend.
Well...<eos> L'chaim.<eos> She was in so much pain and I wasn't there for her.<eos> So much happened while we were in China.<eos> To Mary Beth, to Emmett.
We expect leaders to take us where we want to go.<eos> The problem, it seems to me, begins when they don't.<eos> When things do not improve and yet these leaders keep expecting us to get on their bus...<eos> I think this is when leaders become something else.<eos> What?
The problem, it seems to me, begins when they don't.<eos> When things do not improve and yet these leaders keep expecting us to get on their bus...<eos> I think this is when leaders become something else.<eos> What?<eos> Politicians.
Even when he was very young.<eos> We were a family of journalists... my wife, Raoul, me.<eos> Thank you.<eos> The truth was not a thing to be hidden or denied.<eos> Not under our roof.
Come, let's go.<eos> So, Bug, where is he?<eos> Who?<eos> You said we were meeting your guy here.<eos> Not my guy, the guy.
Hello?<eos> Sebastian?<eos> Thank God.<eos> Fredrick said you were with him.<eos> With who?
You know what?<eos> This is over!<eos> I told you, it's over! I'm done!<eos> Who were you talking to?<eos> No one.
You want one?<eos> Yes.<eos> That's a very good idea.<eos> I have been thinking about a lot of things that have been going on with me.<eos> - And with us.
It's still not exactly the same... but I think it's close enough.<eos> Will it work?<eos> It should, but since I don't understand exactly what it's doing, I can't be sure.<eos> - I'm just gonna have to test it.<eos> - Oh, not alone.
They can call it what they want.<eos> Well, if you think about the last few days, what's in the air...<eos> It might not be such a bad idea for us to take it one handshake at a time.<eos> Or call it for what it is.<eos> "Home and abroad."
Yeah...<eos> Mrs. Underwood!<eos> Mrs. Underwood!<eos> Does the administration believe that the explosion was connected<eos> - with Joshua Masterson somehow?
I think I speak for the whole team when I say we're all looking forward to meeting Yuri immensely.<eos> Unless there are any further questions...?<eos> - Yes?<eos> - What does it eat?<eos> Journalists.
You all right?<eos> You don't look as though you've been sleeping.<eos> You've lost weight.<eos> You're not in love, are you?<eos> On my wages?
And when did you really last see her?<eos> Erm, shortly after you left, she dropped by, er, briefly.<eos> Where were you the night before the chess tournament?<eos> Erm... with Tessa, at her flat.<eos> And the night before that?
Be safe.<eos> - Alan Snyder?<eos> - Uh, yes.<eos> One of our Proxies.<eos> Welcome.
- The keys? - Mmm-hmm.<eos> Which, by the way, you are never going to get.<eos> Oh, yeah?<eos> Even if you have to hide them some place very private?<eos> And warm.
I press the button to give me full manual control.<eos> And if I can hold the stick, I can override the flight path.<eos> And if I hold it long enough, I can avoid reentry.<eos> You fly out into deep space.<eos> With Calvin.
Would you say, like, you're more brave or merciful?<eos> I'd say I'm neither.<eos> But I still plan to be a spectacular monarch.<eos> I hereby dub thee<eos> High King Eliot the Spectacular.
You know... I don't care for people, as a rule.<eos> I like you.<eos> You have promise.<eos> With the right control, you would be formidable.<eos> Even a worthy collaborator.
Yes, we just got a new black stone from Morocco.<eos> I mean, we call this stone Black Galaxy.<eos> You've never seen a black like this.<eos> Close your eyes.<eos> Close.
For the life of me, I don't know what you're talking about, Daddy.<eos> Scott Fitzgerald is the best man I know.<eos> He's intelligent and caring and a gentleman.<eos> And he's going to be a famous writer.<eos> A famous writer.
'Cause this bastard's no use to us dead.<eos> We need to take him alive.<eos> I'm ready.<eos> How we gonna take him?<eos> Alive.
Who's that woman sitting next to Henry Masters?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> - We'll begin by standing for "Eternal Father," which you will find on page 352 of your hymnal.<eos> Cali was my best friend.<eos> My roommate.
Yes, I did.<eos> Give me the 22 blade.<eos> Your son died holding a gun to the head of a DEA agent.<eos> My sister died defenseless.<eos> And innocent.
For the past several years, I've been allowing myself free time at night outside the sanitarium.<eos> You've been breaking out?<eos> Yes.<eos> And then "breaking" into the local library in order to read and also to access their computers so I can keep up-to-date with all my friends and colleagues.<eos> Dr. Brennan, Hodgins, Angela, and Dr. Saroyan.
- not Zsa Zsa Gabor.<eos> - Not many girls would say that.<eos> Well, you're not engaged to many girls.<eos> No.<eos> Just you.
But when they finally spoke, Stephen was regretful about the whole thing.<eos> Said he'd discuss it with her.<eos> Next thing Dr Klein heard, Stephen was dead.<eos> Stephen gave me his permission to publish with sole credit.<eos> Sole credit?
You're the only one who can answer that question now.<eos> I don't want to fix another election.<eos> Then you know what you have to do.<eos> Frankie Vargas was a good man.<eos> Honorable.
Still tight as... scales on a snake.<eos> Must have friends in high places, Bagwell.<eos> How a cesspool like you gets his walking papers I'll never know.<eos> This cesspool has been a model citizen.<eos> Model citizen.
Totally, I mean...<eos> I designed this when I was working for Claudia.<eos> I showed her and she gagged and then she gave me, like, 20 suggestions.<eos> Well, how many of them did you take?<eos> Nineteen.
It hasn't decided yet.<eos> - Hm... - Are you always up this early?<eos> Hey, good morning.<eos> - Who are you talking to?<eos> - Uh, nobody.
I'm glad you did.<eos> I can't tell you how great it is to see you.<eos> Tell me what you've been up to, I heard you're in New York working for some big time designer and you got engaged?<eos> Well, that didn't really work out.<eos> Both the engagement and New York thing.
That's some pretty spendy real estate.<eos> She's a bank teller?<eos> Well, private client banking.<eos> Her department services people with a lot of money.<eos> Like a lot, a lot.
Well, she ran this place for decades.<eos> She was special. To everyone who walked through that door.<eos> Including a shy kid with glasses.<eos> Hmm. I can't really picture you as shy.<eos> And chubby.
Fifty-eight minutes.<eos> Doesn't that seem a little odd to you?<eos> Oh, I've got a whole list of things that seem odd to me about this case.<eos> Who are you supposed to meet here?<eos> No one.
Aria would never do something like that.<eos> I saw her get a puzzle piece in the brew.<eos> It was hidden for her and she knew where to find it.<eos> I also managed to access a portion of an unsettling phone call Aria had today.<eos> With who?
It was. Yeah.<eos> Until I realized something.<eos> There's a way for me to get you out of my life.<eos> - To end this.<eos> All of this.
It's mine, free and clear.<eos> I put the deed in your name. Yours and Alison's.<eos> But why?<eos> I know what's happening.<eos> With the police.
You are using him as bait.<eos> You son of a bitch.<eos> She knows not to hurt him.<eos> You were so obsessed with Michael that you would risk my son!<eos> Michael?
Oh, I'll get Jasper.<eos> Jasper.<eos> One second.<eos> What were you doing?<eos> Uh, no... nothing.
Okay.<eos> Call us if you need anything, and, um... we'll see you soon, okay?<eos> - Be good.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Not too good.
I do it the same time every day.<eos> - What time is it now?<eos> - About half past four.<eos> There you gan.<eos> - What about the evening?
May take time, but things surface.<eos> They always do.<eos> If I knew something that could help, I'd tell you.<eos> What did he have to say for himself?<eos> Very defensive, borderline aggressive.
This was on Tuesday?<eos> You left Gareth on his own?<eos> Only for 20 minutes.<eos> He was back for the boat.<eos> And overnight?
He speaks.<eos> Do you know a way out or not?<eos> Yeah, you know what, I do.<eos> In the back of a body cart with your eyes rolled way in the back of your head.<eos> Very dead.
Oh, this is all just one big joke to you, huh?<eos> You don't like the commercial.<eos> No, no, I don't, but this has nothing to do with the comm-- well, constructive criticism is always welcome.<eos> But I didn't -- but you should realize that most people find it uplifting -- patriotic, even.<eos> No.
Paige: No, thank you for cleaning up that mess mcgill left behind.<eos> Actually, would you mind if I messenger that over tomorrow morning, first thing?<eos> I'd like to take one last look before we submit, just double-check a few things.<eos> Sure.<eos> So, tomorrow, first thing?
Hunter comes out one morning, finds these images.<eos> This is the killing I was telling you about.<eos> The victim's Harlan Gaines, Deputy Chief of the CIA.<eos> And the killer... well, you can see, it's who we call Michael Scofield,<eos> - or Kaniel Outis, or...
Alleging this conspiracy was pre-meditated.<eos> So, Wes, uh, where do I start?<eos> Wes was a really great guy.<eos> Like, really just...<eos> Good.
You realize that, right?<eos> If ISIL gets in here, we are all the enemy.<eos> Sinners, deviants... and those that locked up their leader.<eos> You will be the only guard that they catch.<eos> The noble one.
Wait.<eos> You said you'd get me out, all the way home.<eos> That was the deal.<eos> Ramal, this man follows us, tell your men to shoot him.<eos> Gladly.
Wait, who are "they"?<eos> Don't know.<eos> It was a dummy IP address, but the cell and location were correct.<eos> They couldn't hide that from me.<eos> The man himself.
Alive.<eos> They brought his eyes to me in a rag.<eos> I need you to use that on me.<eos> End my suffering.<eos> What, this?
Then wait until we run out.<eos> There are four of us.<eos> Let's just swarm him, take him out.<eos> Not out here.<eos> Not with an AK-47.
He targeted me for my skills, blackmailed me.<eos> He told me if I didn't agree to come work for him, he'd go after you and Linc, put you both in jail.<eos> And then he proved it to me.<eos> He said I could never see either one of you again.<eos> Or Mike.
No, no, no, no, no, this is not on you.<eos> I...<eos> Why now?<eos> Why did you come back now?<eos> The origami...
I just want to... Free up our minds and be open to alternate strategies, please.<eos> Meet me halfway here.<eos> I suppose...<eos> I suppose we could limit the investigators to just nighttime hours.<eos> - Nighttime.
And I promise from now on, no more lies.<eos> Okay.<eos> I have something for you.<eos> Where did you get this?<eos> Under the floorboards.
I'm bold...<eos> Adjacent.<eos> I gotta take this. "Adjacent."<eos> Garroway.<eos> Bold.
While we're increasing in numbers, we're also finding suitable Downworlders to hold on to for research.<eos> You should join them.<eos> They could use a good leader like you.<eos> I don't lead hunts for innocent Downworlders.<eos> Innocent?
I don't have enough training.<eos> And even if I did, I'm Valentine's daughter.<eos> Nobody there trusts me.<eos> For 18 years, you made me believe that I could live a normal life.<eos> This life.
And eventually she'll be gone.<eos> Sooner or later, even your memories of her will fade, whether you want them to or not.<eos> No.<eos> That won't happen.<eos> Not to me.
I don't understand.<eos> I was nine years old when my mother realized what my cat eyes meant.<eos> She couldn't live with the fact that she bore the son of a demon.<eos> So she took her life.<eos> With this very keris.
Then the guy who sold it to me lied.<eos> Okay.<eos> So none of this behavior seems...<eos> Crazy to you?<eos> Crazy?
You don't understand.<eos> I've waited my whole life to see the Iron Sisters.<eos> I can do this.<eos> The truth is, you can't do this, Isabelle.<eos> Not with a venom infection.
- Uh, her hair.<eos> Yes.<eos> - Perfect.<eos> Nurse Leigh will help you with the paperwork.<eos> Uh, paperwork?
Please come back with us.<eos> We need you.<eos> Clary needs you.<eos> You think that I don't wanna be there for Clary?<eos> For all of you?
You continue to surprise me.<eos> In good ways, I hope.<eos> I haven't had a roommate this brazen since...<eos> Well, since Casanova and I spent the night in the Doge's Palace.<eos> Casanova?
You know I get claustrophobic.<eos> I know.<eos> But I'm doing this for your own safety.<eos> I don't want to have to fight you.<eos> Me?
We don't live up to our full potential.<eos> And I do not want to be a heart surgeon.<eos> And I don't want to be a yoga instructor.<eos> Okay, guys, like I said, why don't I talk to<eos> - our time aberration?
Well, in a sense, yes.<eos> Your former partner was killed when the Oculus exploded in a blast of temporal energy.<eos> Now, if Mr. Snart was able to bond with that blast, the version of him you're now seeing could be...<eos> Um, how will I put this?<eos> - Like a time-ghost?
Do you recall how we resolved disputes within the League?<eos> Now...<eos> I suggest you choose a blade that matches that sharp tongue of yours.<eos> Excuse me for a second.<eos> Gladly.
I knew you could do it.<eos> Come on, Jim!<eos> Fight it!<eos> - Fight the damn virus! - (growls)<eos> Not my car.
I don't know if Gotham deserves saving, but I do know one thing.<eos> If anyone can save it... it's you.<eos> And in return, I believe it can save you as well.<eos> And then maybe one day, it will send you back to me.<eos> Until then, love always...
- This, Detective, is the cure for Caitlin.<eos> You're kidding.<eos> You figured it out?<eos> Not by myself.<eos> With the help of...
I don't have a home.<eos> Yes, you do, Caitlin.<eos> You do.<eos> With your friends.<eos> With me.
We should be trying to find him, making him pay for everything.<eos> Oliver: A little over a year ago, i--i stood right here, and I remarked that i wished it wasn't just the dark times that brought us together.<eos> With all the loss that we have suffered, I think it's important that we embrace the miracles, too, and that we remember they are still possible.<eos> Welcome home, Laurel.<eos> Cheers.
Just let me be, man.<eos> What's your damage, Hoss?<eos> I mean, ever since the party, you been off.<eos> You're supposed to be the happy one, remember?<eos> Like what? ! Like this?
What?<eos> What's that look?<eos> Nothing.<eos> You've been spending a lot of time with her.<eos> Her?
What's that look?<eos> Nothing.<eos> You've been spending a lot of time with her.<eos> Her?<eos> Who?
A studio apartment with a garden.<eos> You applied for the lease.<eos> I got the lease.<eos> Yes.<eos> Small steps, huh?
Drop the bow, or we will light your ass up.<eos> Fine.<eos> Son of a bitch!<eos> What do you mean they were after you?<eos> Somehow...
Haven't seen you around much today.<eos> Yeah. You know, I was just busy taking out the trash.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Sanitation?<eos> More like public relations.
Prometheus hasn't given me a choice.<eos> Um, neither did Slade Wilson or Damien Darhk.<eos> But with those guys, you didn't just pick up your football and go home.<eos> This is different.<eos> How?
You think this is about taking a vacation?<eos> We're taking over.<eos> We're taking back this city.<eos> Yeah?<eos> You and what army?
We're taking over.<eos> We're taking back this city.<eos> Yeah?<eos> You and what army?<eos> This one!
That's why you won't tell who this...<eos> Prometheus is.<eos> Of course I will, Oliver, because I want you to suffer.<eos> He calls himself...<eos> Adrian Chase.
That's one hell of an accusation.<eos> That's why I'm giving you that.<eos> And this evidence comes from where?<eos> An investigation that I've been conducting off the books.<eos> With what personnel?
Gregor is dead.<eos> As the new Pakhan, I... I have to meet with him.<eos> He will suspect something is up.<eos> I could try to talk to Galina.<eos> - To who?
And--and, I mean, he just told you this?<eos> Before I got there, he was making deal with American businessman, some secret sensitive shipment.<eos> You think it's a weapon?<eos> Kovar has many men, but not enough for a coup.<eos> But with weapon.
This is not human.<eos> Anatoly, I told you putting on this hood, it helps me direct the darkness inside of me.<eos> It worked, by the way.<eos> I know what Kovar's planning.<eos> But at what cost?
Your best men were arrested.<eos> Already out on bail.<eos> I hear they cannot wait to get revenge on vigilantes that put them away.<eos> This is between you and me, no one else.<eos> "No one else"?
He's not gonna leave the country.<eos> He isn't done yet.<eos> How do you know?<eos> - Call it a hunch.<eos> - A hunch?
The concrete councilman.<eos> Dinah's working the evidence.<eos> If she gets a lead, we make a move.<eos> How is it going with, uh...<eos> - William. - Yup.
When did you become all zen-like and well-adjusted?<eos> Well...<eos> We should celebrate that tonight as well as your birthday.<eos> I appreciate that, but I already have plans.<eos> With who?
I appreciate that, but I already have plans.<eos> With who?<eos> Please say, "not Susan Williams."<eos> Um, it... no.<eos> Uh, with Felicity.
I saw you do it, and if I didn't know it was you, I wouldn't know it was you.<eos> Hey. I'm glad to see you guys.<eos> I was worried you might be involved in this.<eos> What?<eos> In this?
If he was travelling with anyone?<eos> Well, like I say, we try to keep them fed and warm, no questions asked.<eos> I recognize you, don't I?<eos> You attended service for a while?<eos> My wife and I.
I'm not blind, I'm just mental.<eos> A psychological reaction to the wasp trauma.<eos> Wha-wha-what about if it's a physiological reaction to the wasp trauma?<eos> Well, then Doctor Adebimpe would have found a physiological explanation...<eos> With his little ophthalmoscope and his torch?
Stay inside!<eos> - Dad!<eos> - Come on!<eos> Hong.<eos> Not with the knife.
You love killing belters?<eos> Fred:<eos> Diogo!<eos> Get these men to holding.<eos> Under guard.
So is the roci gonna be okay, or what?<eos> Don't worry, we're gonna treat her like one of our own.<eos> In the meantime, you look like you could blow off some steam.<eos> I see you're from some rock, care to put the ball to the wall?<eos> Pashang,yeah!
Protogen, a subsidiary of Mao-Kwikowski.<eos> Of course, so are half the companies in the system.<eos> That's it.<eos> Fred wants me to connect Protogen to the stealth ships.<eos> And to Jules-Pierre Mao?
But I'm not looking.<eos> And by the time they can pull the strings to force me out, it'll be too late.<eos> Their family will be ruined.<eos> Their mother, the children, their children, all of them, pariahs.<eos> Outlaws.
Friend of St Mary's Church.<eos> Are you here to burn us at the stake?<eos> We're here to invite you to dinner.<eos> Friday is St John's Eve, which coincides with your summer solstice.<eos> Litha.
I have pardoned hundreds of nonviolent drug offenders, many of them adults, who never learned to read, which is a tragedy.<eos> But Sherman Tanz...<eos> And that is why I'm taking this opportunity to announce my charitable organization, the Meyer Fund for Adult Literacy.<eos> Certainly a worthwhile cause, but if we could bring it back to Sherman Tanz...<eos> And AIDS.
And that is why I'm taking this opportunity to announce my charitable organization, the Meyer Fund for Adult Literacy.<eos> Certainly a worthwhile cause, but if we could bring it back to Sherman Tanz...<eos> And AIDS.<eos> Wow.<eos> Yes, AIDS.
Okay, you know what?<eos> If you want to talk about the money thing...<eos> - Yes.<eos> - you can talk about it...<eos> - With Marjorie.
You were at Hardhome.<eos> You've seen the Army of the Dead.<eos> You've seen the Night King.<eos> He's coming for us.<eos> For all of us.
They don't.<eos> See if there's a larder.<eos> They always leave something behind.<eos> How do you think it ended for them?<eos> With death.
It's a map of Dragonstone.<eos> The Targaryens built their first stronghold there when they invaded Westeros.<eos> That's dragonglass?<eos> A mountain of it.<eos> Beneath the ground.
One or two.<eos> I can't believe you're here.<eos> Did you meet the big lady?<eos> - Big lady?<eos> - The lady knight?
And what will you be, handsome?<eos> Whatever my queen commands.<eos> He'll be my advisor, my protector.<eos> Oh, I see.<eos> Your protector.
It wasn't even about you.<eos> Yeah, why would it be?<eos> God, I thought you were my best friend.<eos> Robbie and I had a fight, you'd be the first one to know, and all the time you were fucking him<eos> - behind my back.
Oh, I'm a fine me.<eos> I just keep getting better every year.<eos> Of course you are, and that is the you that deserves to be seen incorporated.<eos> Everyone in the world gets their place.<eos> With you?
Who are you?<eos> If I told you, you wouldn't believe me.<eos> I believe in something.<eos> I saw my wife.<eos> Tonight.
Yeah, I just said I kissed him.<eos> - Put your tongue in his mouth?<eos> - Just the tip.<eos> Was it cold?<eos> And dry?
I got in trouble with the law.<eos> I had to leave or they were gonna take me to prison.<eos> I had to run and run fast.<eos> And you can't run fast with a five-year-old.<eos> Not just a five-year-old.

I had to run and run fast.<eos> And you can't run fast with a five-year-old.<eos> Not just a five-year-old.<eos> Your five-year-old.<eos> Your daughter.
Would he have killed you?<eos> Well, I can tell you this.<eos> I've never felt better in my life.<eos> Clearer, stronger.<eos> More focused.
- He's gonna bring back Jerome.<eos> - Oh, that's great.<eos> That's all this city needs...<eos> Jerome Valeska sucking air with<eos> - 50 fanatics at his back.
However,<eos> I would feel justified in giving the police enough evidence so that your little girlfriend could only talk to her mama every other Thursday through a screen for the next 40 years.<eos> So, you give Maria the money, she gives it to me...<eos> I'm out of your lives.<eos> Cash, obviously.
Each of you kept him alive.<eos> Each of you is Jerome.<eos> I am Jerome.<eos> We are all...<eos> Jerome.
Love is about sacrifice.<eos> It's about putting someone else's needs and happiness before your own.<eos> - Ed, please...<eos> - 'Cause the truth is, Oswald, you would sacrifice anyone to save your own neck.<eos> Even me.
Don't be shy.<eos> Your mother wasn't.<eos> Chop-chop.<eos> Who are you talking to, old man?<eos> Me!
I know you took my key card to Professor Strange's lab.<eos> Odd that Strange said nothing.<eos> He and I will be having words.<eos> Who else have you brought into your confidence?<eos> Harvey Bullock, obviously.
You must be very proud of yourself, Ed, thinking you outsmarted me.<eos> Well, frankly, it wasn't really a challenge.<eos> Now, you're gonna do one thing before you die.<eos> Call me...<eos> The Riddler.
I knew you could do it.<eos> Come on, Jim!<eos> Fight it!<eos> Fight the damn virus!<eos> Not my car.
I don't know if Gotham deserves saving, but I do know one thing.<eos> If anyone can save it... it's you.<eos> And in return, I believe it can save you as well.<eos> And then maybe one day, it will send you back to me.<eos> Until then, love always...
We've been calling him Jason Bourne.<eos> But then H.R. noticed something.<eos> Well, at first, it was a real brain-twister, but then I remembered a quote from a renowned poet from my Earth, Alfred Yankovic...<eos> Are you talking about Weird Al?<eos> Why?
I didn't bring you anywhere.<eos> We're inside your heads.<eos> You created this world.<eos> And we got lucky because it could have been a war movie or a... a space opera, but thanks to your love of musicals, with the countless times you watched, um, "Wizard of Oz"<eos> - with your adoptive parents...
Joe.<eos> Wally, Cisco.<eos> You all shunned me because I wasn't the true Barry Allen.<eos> I was an aberration.<eos> A disposable hero.
- Um... - Mr. Allen?<eos> Can you continue?<eos> Yes, I can... I can continue.<eos> The... uh, yes, the fires were... high-temperature accelerant fires, because the flames... were, were... very yellow.<eos> Very yellow?

- surveillance cameras.<eos> - I'm out.<eos> - Eye scans. - Nope!<eos> - Palm prints.<eos> Heat sensors. - Whoa!
Barry and Caitlin, at it again.<eos> You're not Caitlin.<eos> And I'm not Barry.<eos> You sure you're gonna go through with this?<eos> - What?
Elvis, banana.<eos> My, my, my.<eos> Getting rather violent in your young age.<eos> Yeah, what were you doing?<eos> Magic.
But only because I missed story time.<eos> Were you working last night?<eos> Uh, no.<eos> I had a little dinner.<eos> With who?
Were you working last night?<eos> Uh, no.<eos> I had a little dinner.<eos> With who?<eos> Uh, Lucifer.
So? So you sent her a threatening text.<eos> "Ditch the loser from Lux."<eos> Yeah.<eos> She said she was hooking up with some DJ named Lucifer.<eos> DJ?
What girl?<eos> The creepy weirdo.<eos> She was always in a corner of the club.<eos> She just gave this death stare.<eos> Daggers.
Any idea of how long it took the poison to activate?<eos> Well, it's hard to say for sure, but best guess, maybe 24 hours?<eos> I hope poor Ricky made 'em count.<eos> Enjoying what little life he had left with sex or friends.<eos> Or sex with friends.
Lucifer, I am so sorry.<eos> Father brought her into existence just to put her in my path.<eos> Yes.<eos> The whole thing's been a sham, Mum.<eos> Long con.
Bitch!<eos> Cheap-ass ho!<eos> What?<eos> Drag that bitch, Nessa!<eos> - Hello?
Maybe.<eos> I mean, is that such a bad thing?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I'm gonna be myself, I'll tell you that much.<eos> Just a little more polished.
- Who's Rafael?<eos> - Rafael is...<eos> Why is Shine referring to Rafael in past tense?<eos> Rafael Green was a big player in Vegas.<eos> A very corrupt, ruthless, and despicable human being.
Yes.<eos> Cookie.<eos> I have received a very coveted spot on The Grant Kelly Show tomorrow, and I would like you to be by my side.<eos> Are you proposing... that I, be on TV... with you?<eos> - On TV with me, yes, please.
Yeah.<eos> Of course.<eos> - You will?<eos> Thank you.<eos> All right.
So you can get - a tangible experience from it.<eos> Thirsty?<eos> What's up?<eos> Would you mind taking care of our guest?<eos> Absolutely.
So why would somebody want Barry dead?<eos> I mean, what, did he screw up a tax return?<eos> He's actually more of a money manager.<eos> Well, whatever he was, looks like he, uh, certainly made one hell of a... uh...<eos> Enemy?

Yeah.<eos> First action in I don't know how long, and it's like it never even happened.<eos> Ha.<eos> See, now that's comedy.<eos> Okay, whoa.
Honestly, I don't care if you live or die.<eos> But since we're such jolly good pals now...<eos> Jolly good?<eos> Let me just say that the Men of Letters is an excellent fit for someone with our... inclinations.<eos> "Our"?
Wait, what are you talking about?<eos> What you did with me, with... With Gadreel, remember?<eos> The... the grace extraction.<eos> We take the grace from the baby, from the nephilim, and then the baby just becomes...<eos> Human.

I think he thought...<eos> I had to turn him down.<eos> This was the first time I'd seen him since.<eos> And who did you talk to at the party?<eos> Everyone.
There was Cath, obviously, Jim, obviously.<eos> Er...<eos> Ian was there.<eos> I didn't talk to Sarah.<eos> Ed Burnett.
I walked a bit down the path.<eos> And then it felt like I was punched in the back of the head.<eos> Or... Or maybe hit with something.<eos> And did it feel like a fist or the flat of a hand or an object?<eos> Not a flat hand.
- Hello, you.<eos> - Hiya, Dad.<eos> I wasn't expecting to see you tonight.<eos> I need to talk to you about something.<eos> Just between us.
Someone left her a bunch of flowers, with a card saying, "Thinking of you." Unsigned.<eos> - Who does the think they're from?<eos> - She doesn't know.<eos> - When was this?<eos> - Last night.
You're still doing your time.<eos> What about the woman you raped, Aaron?<eos> Did she get a fresh start?<eos> If you're interested in the truth, the girl was as pissed as I was.<eos> Girl?
If you're interested in the truth, the girl was as pissed as I was.<eos> Girl?<eos> How old was she?<eos> - 27.<eos> - Woman, then.
- Which beach?<eos> A couple of miles east of town.<eos> Around Flintcombe?<eos> No, not that far.<eos> About halfway between there and Broadchurch.
I was civil.<eos> That was it.<eos> I saw Sarah and Ian having a barney a bit later on, actually, and then she left shortly after that, luckily.<eos> Did she talk to anyone else?<eos> Ed.
She came over to me about nine to be rescued.<eos> He's not a naturally sociable person, Ed.<eos> He just sticks to one or two people and I think she'd had enough.<eos> Martin Skittles from the pub.<eos> A few others.

It just came through.<eos> The DNA results.<eos> The swabs they took from Trish Winterman.<eos> We've got a match with one of our men.<eos> Who?
When I came round, there was something in my mouth.<eos> Like thick material, gagging me.<eos> My hands were tied behind my back and he was on top of me.<eos> He smelt of drink.<eos> - What sort of drink?
Like thick material, gagging me.<eos> My hands were tied behind my back and he was on top of me.<eos> He smelt of drink.<eos> - What sort of drink?<eos> - Spirits.
I washed them.<eos> - Never wore them again.<eos> - Have you still got them?<eos> Did you speak to anyone about the attack at the time?<eos> My GP.
Yes.<eos> I used to do the IT support.<eos> The company I worked for had the contract.<eos> - Who did you deal with there?<eos> - The owner.
I live at 19 Hazel Grove, Kingsbere.<eos> Two years ago...<eos> I was raped... and I never told anyone.<eos> It was a mistake.<eos> With Danny.
I'm so tired, Beth.<eos> I can't see anything ahead.<eos> You know, it'd just be... easier if all this went away.<eos> Do you not think you could talk to us?<eos> To me?
How do you expect me to remember that?<eos> Were you in the area?<eos> As far as I remember.<eos> I'd have been at the garage during the day.<eos> And in the evening?
I didn't realise it was a suspicious bag until I looked inside.<eos> If I did this, why would I call it in?<eos> Doesn't make any sense.<eos> How stupid would I have to be?<eos> Not stupid, maybe.
What am I supposed to do about it?<eos> Governor Odegard used to call Kim Hopperstad, he'd bring his digger out and fix it.<eos> Is that so?<eos> Do you know how many murders I have on my plate?<eos> Four...
No.<eos> I was there.<eos> I was so happy to hear your voice.<eos> With the woman.<eos> Dr. Khatri.
Hildur.<eos> What are you doing out here?<eos> I came to talk to you, Erling.<eos> I'm here to see the digger man.<eos> - Kim Hopperstad? - Hmm.
Well, I do have a section on rashes.<eos> It's right next to Chinese cars.<eos> Isn't it beautiful, boss?<eos> No, no, no, it should be delicate!<eos> Fetching!
He would know better than to let a dangerous snake bite him.<eos> I tested his blood.<eos> In his veins, I found the venom of one of the most dangerous snakes in the world.<eos> Good heavens, which one?<eos> The incredibly deadly viper.
- You mean... - Yes!<eos> A quarantine!<eos> Your turn.<eos> What?<eos> A quarantine!
But as Klaus looked down at it, seeing the way the hedges snaked to form a familiar sinister eye, it seemed to contain both secrets and danger.<eos> Secrets their Uncle Monty had promised to share... and the danger of being so high off the ground.<eos> The reptiles certainly seem...<eos> - Agitated.<eos> - Annoyed.
This is phantasmagorical!<eos> You are police officers!<eos> Do something!<eos> - It... it looks like the baby's playing. - Mmm-hmm.<eos> With the incredibly deadly viper?
Enough.<eos> Do I need to remind you how much money the federal government spends every day to keep a President safe?<eos> $2 million.<eos> That wherever I go, there's a man following me with blood.<eos> My blood.
- What does it mean?<eos> Beware, beware, God sees.<eos> Like God is watching.<eos> Watching what?<eos> Gunn.
Beware, beware, God sees.<eos> Like God is watching.<eos> Watching what?<eos> Gunn.<eos> His sins. His evil doings.
Like God is watching.<eos> Watching what?<eos> Gunn.<eos> His sins. His evil doings.<eos> His rapes and murders.
Great dads aren't easy to come by.<eos> Dr. Reid.<eos> I'm sorry. I was selfish.<eos> I just thought if he could come to the party that everything would be okay.<eos> Not like with my mom.
Just family trouble.<eos> You're married?<eos> No.<eos> Disagreement with my brother.<eos> That hardass?
- Yeah.<eos> 'Cause I don't...<eos> Why would you...<eos> Come on.<eos> This guy?
Chuck was right about you all along.<eos> He's mentally ill.<eos> What is your excuse?<eos> Enjoy your champagne.<eos> Like the other night during dinner,
You want me to steal this?<eos> Get a prescription and go to a pharmacist.<eos> - It'll be cheap.<eos> - I need those capsules empty... before they're sealed.<eos> With those exact markings.
You're like every other person in this building.<eos> Like you?<eos> You think I'm not on the books?<eos> I am.<eos> Under my own name.
What?<eos> This is a very nice office.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Seem to be risking a lot for a drug dealer.<eos> "Drug dealer"?
Yellow bananas.<eos> Green grapes.<eos> Orange... oranges.<eos> Oh, excuse me. Um, where would I find the s-soy milk?<eos> Uh, over there and to the left, just past the freezer aisle.
And risk it going away?<eos> Or better still, we move in now.<eos> Move in where?<eos> Inside the bank.<eos> Tonight?
Only way in is through the door, which you can't do without the bank's co-owner Otto Fangor.<eos> Now all we need is a cherry on top.<eos> You're enjoying this, aren't you?<eos> We can't just walk into that bank after hours,<eos> - us and Mr. Wanger.
Now all we need is a cherry on top.<eos> You're enjoying this, aren't you?<eos> We can't just walk into that bank after hours,<eos> - us and Mr. Wanger.<eos> - Fangor.
And for it to look like an iranian hit.<eos> I feel...<eos> I feel...<eos> Alone.<eos> So alone.
Are we not?<eos> Good friends.<eos> The worst two words a man can hear from the lips of a beautiful woman.<eos> Zev, you're really too much.<eos> Shalom.

Okay?<eos> He's moving to the bench by the carousel, like they instructed.<eos> - Mattie?<eos> - Oh, hey.<eos> One level up.
Dressed as a priest?<eos> According to the Brits, in transit from Poland.<eos> Francois Zola was gonna cook you dinner?<eos> - When was this?<eos> - 9:28 this morning.
Our story is about a town, a small town, and the people who live in the town.<eos> From a distance, it presents itself like so many other small towns all over the world...<eos> Safe.<eos> Decent.

- Hey!<eos> Yo, be honest with me.<eos> You work on any houses?<eos> Any private homes?<eos> Yeah, a couple.
- No.<eos> - What did you say to me?<eos> I do everything for everyone.<eos> Everything to be perfect.<eos> The perfect daughter, the perfect sister, the perfect student...
No disrespect, Dad, but I don't want it.<eos> Three months ago, you did.<eos> What happened?<eos> I've changed. Everything's changed.<eos> This summer...
I'll study with Ms. Grundy before school, football practice after school, and work with my dad on the weekends.<eos> It's going to be nuts.<eos> So long as you don't give up your passion.<eos> Now that I'm a River Vixen and you're gonna be on varsity football, I have this fantasy of us as a power couple...<eos> Or maybe even just a couple.
I'm supposed to feel with Betty.<eos> Have you felt it, though?<eos> With anyone?<eos> Yeah.<eos> This summer.
And Ethel's not lying.<eos> And proof or no proof, book or no book, I am going scorched earth on these privileged, despicable miscreants.<eos> You wanna get caught in that backdraft, Cheryl?<eos> Call me, or any of these beautiful, young, strong, intelligent women...<eos> "slut"
This is my first permanent position.<eos> Getting back to music, you're working with Archie Andrews on an independent study.<eos> Have you ever done this sort of thing before?<eos> - Yes. Last year. - Oh.<eos> With Tomoko Yoshido and Jason Blossom.

Good day, Ms. Hermione.<eos> From the dry cleaners.<eos> Ah, thank you, Smithers.<eos> And Fred Andrews is escorting me to the drive-in, so all the pieces are in place.<eos> - The drive-in with Fred Andrews? - Yes.
- Maybe.<eos> What's your point?<eos> - Look, I don't want to be locked in a catfight-to-the-death with you.<eos> That only ends in one way.<eos> Mutual annihilation.
We stopped hanging out, he wouldn't call me back, and then...<eos> Then he started selling off all his stuff.<eos> Anything he could sell for cash, he was hawking.<eos> Then I heard he was dealing drugs...<eos> What drugs?
There's always room for one more kitty in my litter box.<eos> - But Josie...<eos> - Yeah?<eos> Every now and then, I want to sing lead.<eos> Co-lead.
Well, since they shut down the drive-in.<eos> That's where I was living before.<eos> Why the hell are you not living at home?<eos> The truth is, things aren't good at home.<eos> - With your dad?
Best time of my life.<eos> You know, your dad was what is commonly known as a BMOC, Jughead.<eos> - Come on.<eos> The hell I was.<eos> - In what way?
You know, I think I need something a little harder than beer.<eos> Clifford and I were so relieved when Cheryl told us that Polly and the baby are safe and sound.<eos> And money won't be a problem, Betty.<eos> Not now, not ever.<eos> Not with us.
He needed... We needed money.<eos> To get away and to start over.<eos> So Riverdale's star football player becomes a drug mule?<eos> He went to a bar on the other side of the tracks and made a deal with some biker gang.<eos> The Serpents?
I believe you, Jughead.<eos> Honey?<eos> What did you say to Polly when you found out that she was pregnant?<eos> Did you make an appointment for her?<eos> With a doctor?
What did you say to Polly when you found out that she was pregnant?<eos> Did you make an appointment for her?<eos> With a doctor?<eos> That you offered to pay for?<eos> Behind my back?
We were sending her to the Sisters.<eos> Why wasn't that enough?<eos> Because of exactly what is happening right now.<eos> Our little girl's life is being ruined by that mistake.<eos> By that family.
The new guitar, the new suit?<eos> The Blossoms are buying you.<eos> For one night, if it helps my dad and gets me into that music program...<eos> Wouldn't you rather earn your place at that table?<eos> With your music?
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪<eos> That was haunting, Betty.<eos> Blow out the candles and make a wish.<eos> I wish it were just the two of us right now.<eos> One blow!
It's a variation on Truth or Dare.<eos> In which we own our truths.<eos> By telling it like it is.<eos> I'll start the game with Veronica Lodge.<eos> - Naturally.
I was hoping to surprise Fred with lunch.<eos> Oh, he's off-site.<eos> He's picking up some supplies from a vendor.<eos> Yeah, he told me that you were working for him.<eos> With him.
I doubt they're that stupid...<eos> We'll switch... I'll take the bedroom this time.<eos> You wanted to see if we would find anything incriminating, and we didn't.<eos> Then we'll look somewhere else.<eos> Outside or under the trailer.
- You went behind my back, Archie?<eos> - Jug...<eos> My dad just told Mayor McCoy<eos> - about your dad.<eos> - What about my dad?
Whatever Sheriff Keller is saying he found, it wasn't there.<eos> Look, we need to tell Jughead his dad's innocent. Where is Jughead?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I tried calling him. I left him messages. He's not answering his phone.<eos> In the meantime...
No, no. God, no...<eos> Then why do you think he did it?<eos> On July 11th, I got a phone call in the middle of the night from FP.<eos> Said he needed help with some clean-up job at the Whyte Wyrm.<eos> What job?
I always will.<eos> As friends.<eos> The moment you're talking about, I was seeing Betty and Jughead and I was seeing how good they were, and it confirmed how I've been feeling this last week.<eos> I want to be that for you.<eos> A soulmate?
Anyway, we had Gunn good for both murders and possibly some others we didn't even know about, but O'Shea was getting ready to run for DA.<eos> Didn't have the balls to file because it wasn't a 100% sure thing.<eos> You've been keeping tabs on a serial killer - and didn't tell me.<eos> - Never came up.<eos> And the other night?
I'm hungry.<eos> Control your client, Counsel.<eos> And, yes, why don't we take lunch?<eos> Your lunch is at 1:30 at the Boathouse with your daughter.<eos> The smart one or the other one?
You're forgetting the victim was Muslim, too.<eos> I'm good.<eos> Mr. Stone!<eos> Honor to be in the courtroom<eos> - with you today.
Isn't that true?<eos> Yes.<eos> When did you see the two men struggling?<eos> - It was around 11:45.<eos> - At night.
Previously on Beyond.<eos> Nothing will distract me from bringing you home.<eos> So what are you in the mood for?<eos> Something orange.
But it's not just about us.<eos> Was it ever about us?<eos> All our training, remembering our time together.<eos> It's all so I could go back in for... for him?<eos> For Arthur?
No, no, I don't need you to buy me a beer.<eos> What are friends for?<eos> Sorry about what happened to Kevin.<eos> He was a good kid.<eos> Good man.
Thank you, sister.<eos> He must be some kind of a genius or something.<eos> You'll enjoy that.<eos> - Shall we?<eos> - Delighted.
UA Casting Department shared it with him.<eos> He went gangbusters for our girl.<eos> My girl. Oh.<eos> How are we going to celebrate?<eos> On the rocks or on the bed?
Let's see how fast you can get it to 8.<eos> - Mr. Fitzgerald, please.<eos> - Go, go, go, go, go!<eos> ♫ In the good old summertime ♫<eos> ♫ In the good old summertime ♫
Yes!<eos> You do realize that we don't own this house.<eos> Look at this place. It's a mess.<eos> And I'm working myself to the bone.<eos> On what?
You know, this conversation takes me back.<eos> Oh, it takes me back to New York and Harvard and Yale.<eos> Mm, I'm a Stanford man myself.<eos> But, you know, I came to West Covina to search for happiness... which I have recently found in my soul mate, Josh Chan.<eos> Who?
One, two, three.<eos> In a relationship!<eos> Oh, that's so great.<eos> Let's post to Instagram.<eos> Okay, #StatusUpdate #ItsFacebookOfficial.
Good night.<eos> Mom!<eos> Got to moisturize the rest of me.<eos> What are you working on, Tim?<eos> Uh, nothing.

I got the call and I'm here to answer it.<eos> I want the cool T-shirt.<eos> Tell God I'm usually a size large.<eos> I want to become...<eos> A priest?
I'd like to commend you for... commend you for 31 years of splendid service,<eos> 27 of them as a decorated detective.<eos> I saw one of the retirement ceremonies on Channel 2... Public Access.<eos> You looked so proud.<eos> Thinner.
I knew Maya.<eos> Can I come in?<eos> I met her in a labor camp.<eos> - Where?<eos> - Outside the colony.
All shoe prints in the house matched footwear seized from the resident of the house, apart from this one.<eos> It's a boot print that doesn't relate to him or to anyone who attended the crime scene after the scene was cordoned off for forensic deployment.<eos> Someone else was in the house around the time of the offence.<eos> Why haven't you taken all this to the SIO on Trapdoor?<eos> DCI Huntley?
Would you like to order from the breakfast menu?<eos> Uh, right, um...<eos> No, I'll just have a cup of tea, please.<eos> OK, we have Earl Grey, English breakfast, peppermint tea?<eos> Yeah, Earl Grey.
Uh, right, um...<eos> No, I'll just have a cup of tea, please.<eos> OK, we have Earl Grey, English breakfast, peppermint tea?<eos> Yeah, Earl Grey.<eos> - Earl Grey.
Now, excuse us.<eos> We've got a take to shoot.<eos> I may not be able to connect you to this pot, but consider this an informal caution.<eos> All of you.<eos> Informal.
That's right.<eos> That's what he usually did if he stayed on late.<eos> - There's two more, aren't there? - Mm.<eos> What happened to him?<eos> Barry?
Look, we really didn't have much to do with either of them.<eos> Dr Bakshi.<eos> He looks after the boys.<eos> Oh, yes?<eos> In what way?
- A hypocrite!<eos> She stands on her soapbox in that harridan hat and those Hedda Hopper glasses.<eos> The woman clearly wouldn't know couture from a dog turd, and she stands there, with that pantomime horse of a vicar egging her on, spouting bile and hatred, and she has the brass neck to call herself a Christian?<eos> And what about doing anything else about it?<eos> - In what way?
The primary cause of Reverend Golightly's death was haemorrhage leading to heart failure.<eos> Natural causes?<eos> I don't think I said that, did I?<eos> - So, what caused it?<eos> - Laxative.
Cos it's an enchanted place.<eos> I can show you, if you like.<eos> So you said you've been with the group a couple of months.<eos> That right?<eos> - Band.
The one who loved me beyond all fear and all horror.<eos> So do not doubt how much your child will love you, or how little she will see of the things that worry you.<eos> What happened?<eos> She died.<eos> Along with my sister.
I want to call her Linda.<eos> After me mam.<eos> No, no, no, no.<eos> Very bad luck to have same name as dead relative.<eos> - Very bad.
‐ Nothing.<eos> I just found out my wife hates talking to me and my sister wants me to spy for her.<eos> ‐ Oh, yeah?<eos> Who does she want you to spy on?<eos> ‐ Cal.
Ask Dalton!<eos> Do you dream?<eos> What's that?<eos> Do you dream?<eos> At night.
I don't want to.<eos> It makes me sad.<eos> Please don't look at me like that, Noah.<eos> - Like what?<eos> - With all that judgment.
I was over at Pasha's again yesterday.<eos> The same car was out there, a block and a half east of the house.<eos> Not hiding.<eos> Still just the driver.<eos> - Same driver?
If he was so clever, why didn't he take Highgarden the moment your gold mines ran dry?<eos> I suppose I'll be able to ask him myself soon enough.<eos> No more learning from my mistakes, eh?<eos> How will you do it?<eos> With that sword?
Jon: She will only fight beside us if I bend the knee.<eos> Tormund: You spent too much time with the Free Folk.<eos> Now you don't like kneeling.<eos> ...Mance Rayder was a great man.<eos> Proud man.
The rules were wrong.<eos> I was doing what I was meant to be doing and he knew it.<eos> Now he's dead.<eos> Killed by the Lannisters.<eos> With your help.
The sequence is extremely close to the parasitic weapons used by the Los Iluminados cult.<eos> You think Arias might be one of them?<eos> Based on information I have now, I'm not sure.<eos> Looks like we should go talk to a real expert.<eos> Real expert?
Uh, I'm gonna put her at the West Coast relatives table.<eos> Cool, cool.<eos> That just leaves us with a spot to find for Mark.<eos> - Who does he know?<eos> - Uh, no one.
That is that.<eos> - What do we do now?<eos> Wanna take a walk?<eos> I would love to.<eos> - Oh, hey. - Hmm?
Extortion, prostitution, racketeering...<eos> Quite a list.<eos> As much as I'd like to lock him up, Dennis Nelson has an alibi.<eos> He was with his girlfriend all evening.<eos> Rita Simmons.
Why didn't you tell me the club was in trouble?<eos> It wasn't your concern.<eos> It is now.<eos> I ran up some debts.<eos> With a dubious line of credit.
Pals.<eos> Just pals.<eos> Stupid name he had for us.<eos> He had some in-country romance he was hanging onto.<eos> That her?
I envy the clarity of your mission, Bosch.<eos> Somebody's dead, and somebody did it.<eos> Not always as simple as it seems.<eos> We knew he was good for two murders and we were watching him, we busted down the door, and caught Gunn raping that girl.<eos> Red-handed.
Figured she'd been through enough already.<eos> Yeah, he thought we could make the case another way.<eos> When it comes to hookers, Harry's heart bleeds.<eos> For obvious reasons.<eos> Understandable. Absolutely.
Oh, yeah. He's always offered to help, but I always push him away.<eos> I mean, you know, I could be a little bit proud<eos> - and, uh...<eos> - Sure.<eos> stubborn.
She was his liaison, and I guess they liaised in the biblical sense.<eos> Word got back to Audrey...<eos> I just don't know how she finds everything out.<eos> Anyway, she told me, which I'm sure she enjoyed, and I kicked him out.<eos> Oh, yeah, yeah. With the suits and all that.
You and Cyrus have been close for a long time.<eos> I'm fine.<eos> It's the country that concerns me.<eos> Mm. You don't have to be stoic, Fitz.<eos> Not with me.
Shit happens in Hollywood.<eos> We've been talking to him about Billy Meadows' murder.<eos> No shit.<eos> He was a suspect?<eos> Witness.
Turn around, guy's on the ground bleeding out.<eos> Nothing you can do.<eos> Exactly what happened to our witness.<eos> You want to test my knives?<eos> In time.
What can I tell you?<eos> She showed me I.D. She signed the form.<eos> She paid the bond.<eos> How'd she pay?<eos> Cash.
I know we had something.<eos> That's what matters.<eos> It's not just about us.<eos> It was all so I could go back in.<eos> - For him, for Arthur?
Or trying to.<eos> We've been sitting here for 10 minutes and the lamp is still off.<eos> You were the one bragging about how you could help me with my...<eos> Mmm, but I'm not gonna say it.<eos> Powers!
Okay, let's... let's recap, how were you able to survive in the realm for so long?<eos> Apparently I could manipulate the elements.<eos> So now in the real world, our theory is I'm... tapping into atmospheric electricity.<eos> Our theory?<eos> Willa. I...
Son of a bitch is dating my wife.<eos> Sure you don't wanna come?<eos> Oh, I'm gonna be up late catching up on work as it is.<eos> Well, we could stop at that diner.<eos> With the giant homemade cinnamon rolls.
He said something about an old DWP tunnel.<eos> What?<eos> God.<eos> Mr. Bowman!<eos> Oh, welcome home.
I-I don't know.<eos> You can't go back to your apartment.<eos> It's a crime scene.<eos> Have you spoken to the detectives?<eos> Yeah, this morning.
There's a process in place for a reason, Alison.<eos> No, I understand, thanks for coming by.<eos> Would you mind telling us where you were last Wednesday night?<eos> He was home.<eos> With me.
I think you're giving up because we've made a mess of everything, and it's too complicated.<eos> If you leave Luisa now, you can't play the good guy anymore.<eos> Then you're an asshole, just like me.<eos> Yeah, but maybe you're a happy asshole.<eos> Instead of a miserable hero.
I mean, you loved your country, you loved your mission, you loved your fellow officers.<eos> Everything else was a liability.<eos> - That's what I was?<eos> - Yes.<eos> A liability?
I appreciate you coming over. As I already told Olivia, I'm out.<eos> No interview, no nothing.<eos> I want this to be over.<eos> You want what to be over?<eos> The campaign.
Especially me.<eos> I love that picture.<eos> Margaret told me to wait in here...?<eos> How was your lunch the other day?<eos> With the donors?
Sometimes you're not really very nice to me.<eos> I said sometimes.<eos> You know, with the stomping around and the...<eos> What are those...<eos> Opera gloves, right?
Put Fitz out of his misery.<eos> Just ask yourself why you never moved out of your apartment.<eos> Any left for me?<eos> Oof! So, this stuff explain your performance out there?<eos> My performance?
What?<eos> There's someone here to see you.<eos> Who?<eos> I won't let you be alone with him.<eos> Who?
Anything that could help save this nation in the final weeks of my Presidency?<eos> Let's go.<eos> I have no help to give, nor a desire to give it.<eos> The only desire I have is to leave, run...<eos> With my daughter.
- I don't know.<eos> But each time one arrives, he gets more and more agitated.<eos> They mean something to him, something terrible.<eos> A box?<eos> With a brick in it?
I'm a marine.<eos> I'll be fine.<eos> You know, I served with your father.<eos> He would have been very proud of you.<eos> My father?
Yeah, yeah. Beratnas.<eos> You were on Eros with him, too?<eos> And before, on that Earther Station?<eos> Yeah, yeah.<eos> With Miller too.
Do you know a Rachel Duncan?<eos> Oh, we do now.<eos> Yeah, this is a big day for all of us.<eos> - She's in seclusion with Him.<eos> - With who?
Oh, we do now.<eos> Yeah, this is a big day for all of us.<eos> - She's in seclusion with Him.<eos> - With who?<eos> The founder!
If you fall, make sure you land on your head.<eos> The preparations for this evening are nearly complete.<eos> Hopefully you'll be pleasantly surprised.<eos> What about my speech?<eos> - Your speech?
What are you doing, Mr. O'Hara?<eos> I am composing a speech for your mother.<eos> Feel free to throw in your two cents.<eos> No, I didn't mean about the writing, I meant about her.<eos> Her being...
Ah, you know his wife left him.<eos> For you, Archer, 'cause you screwed her tits off at the precinct cookout.<eos> So then she thought the two of you would get married and live happily ever after, but then you were like, "what?"<eos> Exactly.<eos> That face right there.
Yeah, senior year, I was voted class flirt.<eos> And yet, you turned down a battlefield commission to second lieutenant.<eos> Well, after class flirt, I mean...<eos> In fact, you left the army at the same rank you went in.<eos> Buck private.
I didn't know what he was gonna do.<eos>  Cal Roberts?<eos> Did he explicitly threaten you?<eos>  But now he's asked me to come to the compound to meet with them.<eos>  Them?
Andand sometimes wildly happy too.<eos> Life can be fun, a party.<eos> But it's the same loop, over and over, and endless loop to the grave, because that's what it is out there in the I. S. World.<eos> We are taught to be helpless and powerless.<eos> Helpless and powerless.
Yeah.<eos> If it's any consolation, a lot of people felt that way.<eos> It isn't.<eos> Why didn't it work?<eos> 'Tween us?
All right.<eos> Chester didn't do this.<eos> Chester may well have been up to something.<eos> Something bad.<eos> Little boys.
Real sorry what happened to you, boy.<eos> Real sorry.<eos> There's a box for every year.<eos> And this is '88.<eos> Empty.
- All right.<eos> You're worried about this, aren't you?<eos> Judy, some real bad shit gonna go down here tonight unless we stop it.<eos> You know, bossman signs off with everybody's P.O. before he hires 'em.<eos> Real strict about it.
Yeah, I know.<eos> Think we could take him?<eos> Yeah, maybe.<eos> With a big hammer.<eos> Or a cannon.
- Anything. - Mm.<eos> There's my girl.<eos> _<eos> Professor Bigby was brilliant, impatient, stubborn, and mercurial.<eos> And a 500-year-old pixie.
Guys, we rehearse these ops so that we don't run into amateur hour shit like we did back there.<eos> When I give a command, it's done in the best interest of the unit.<eos> I won't have time to explain myself on the battlefield.<eos> I just don't ever recall voting you in as chairman.<eos> Chairman?
See you tomorrow.<eos> Every time something happens like this morning, it's a reminder of what's important.<eos> Humans are stomping down other humans because nobody thinks we can beat the Raps, but we're gonna change all that.<eos> How?<eos> With your help.
Because you were involved.<eos> You're just throwing shit against the wall and hoping it sticks.<eos> This is your wife.<eos> On the subway platform... before the attack on our Host.<eos> With Broussard.
He... sat in the back, kept to Himself.<eos> Asked the band to play "Walk to the Peak."<eos> Guess it was His favorite.<eos> Other than that, He was a customer.<eos> A customer? Really?
Do you want to be?<eos> See ya.<eos> You ever get less than a first, then it's over.<eos> - You what?<eos> - A first.
Nah. This should cover it.<eos> What's that?<eos> Ooh, I found that at the back of the cupboard with all your old stuff. Just photographs of your mum.<eos> I didn't know we had 'em.<eos> Happy new term!
No, of course not.<eos> Nobody's from space.<eos> I'm from a planet like everybody else.<eos> This planet?<eos> - No, not specifically this one.
Agnes.<eos> Tested and hanged.<eos> - For what?<eos> - Consorting with an imp.<eos> And all other manner of black deviltries besides.
This warrant card is my authority.<eos> Up to the gate, sir.<eos> Beyond that, you'll need to make an appointment.<eos> - With whom?<eos> - The appropriate ministry.
Unless you've started smoking Weights.<eos> Is this what we raised you to, some bloke's fancy piece?<eos> - He's nice.<eos> - Married?<eos> Kids?
We were hoping to have a word with your husband.<eos> You missed him.<eos> He went to the plant about an hour ago.<eos> With?<eos> A white-haired gentleman and a tall man with a beard.
Off?<eos> Off how?<eos> It's, uh... not quite Renard enough.<eos> Yeah, yeah, you need to be a little more...<eos> Renard-y.
Off how?<eos> It's, uh... not quite Renard enough.<eos> Yeah, yeah, you need to be a little more...<eos> Renard-y.<eos> - More full of yourself. - Oh.
Obviously, you're here about Dr. Hampton.<eos> Do come in.<eos> Uh, get the door behind you, please.<eos> When was the last time you talked to her?<eos> Uh, last night.
Um, I went to see her at the lab around 11:00.<eos> Seems a little late for a visit.<eos> I needed her help on a project, and I couldn't sleep, so, well, I went to see her.<eos> Was she working on the project with you?<eos> No, not on this one.
And then his son was killed.<eos> What were you and your friends doing with those bodies?<eos> Were they Wesen?<eos> Were they what?<eos> Wesen.
Oh, crap.<eos> So what do we do now?<eos> You can't arrest a tree.<eos> After what it did to Rosalee, I'm fine to chop it down and cut it into firewood.<eos> With all those faces in there?
He's still in the area.<eos> We're headed back to the precinct.<eos> I'll meet you there.<eos> Where was this guy?<eos> Under the Hawthorne Bridge.
- Rosalee.<eos> - Nick.<eos> - Hank, you're okay!<eos> - Wait, you're okay?<eos> - And you.
- Be this Cap'n Poldark?<eos> - My brother, Drake.<eos> - What brings you here?<eos> - Father, sir, did send for Sister.<eos> - To what purpose?
Wheal Grace being one.<eos> I think we both know there are things which even you cannot buy.<eos> Your stepson, for instance.<eos> It would be a mistake to encourage his visits.<eos> A mistake for whom?
Myself -- out of your life.<eos> So these are my terms.<eos> You possess things I hold dear.<eos> My family mine, Wheal Leisure.<eos> My family home, Trenwith.
My dear, it is your good fortune to be unacquainted with the Nampara Poldarks, and long may you remain so blest.<eos> Ross Poldark has chosen to sever all ties with his Trenwith relations, and we feel nothing but relief at being spared his intrusions.<eos> Thank 'ee Lord for sendin' us these gifts, this food, this water...<eos> This house!<eos> By the grace of God...
Knowing them, it'll find them anyway.<eos> As it oft seems to find you?<eos> Those days are done.<eos> I'm a respectable country squire now.<eos> With a home, a mine, a family and a wife.
Well, doubtless he's found some cred'lous wench to take 'im to bed!<eos> I'm not that sorry.<eos> Involvement with Tholly always comes at a price.<eos> And I have my own connections.<eos> In the trade?
He and you must know it's barely four years since I was on trial for wrecking, riot and assault.<eos> On which charges you were, miraculously, acquitted.<eos> And two years before that, I broke into Bodmin jail and freed a prisoner.<eos> Or do you and your fellow justices regard this as<eos> "youthful exuberance"?
Freeing English prisoners will not be a priority.<eos> So I'm thinking there needs to be a more direct attempt.<eos> Involving Tholly?<eos> And Zacky and Henshawe.<eos> - Respectable family men?
How could your husband foresee that in freeing his friend, he'd liberate a man he'd never met?<eos> Well, I hope that whatever consequence come of this liberty, you'll take full advantage of it.<eos> Believe me, ma'am, I intend to.<eos> He was here?<eos> Under my very nose.
Geoffrey Charles is to start there next term.<eos> George has set a trap.<eos> Judas!<eos> Then he's walkin' straight into it!<eos> After 'em!
When you wed Francis, did you not marry for love?<eos> I married for what I thought was love.<eos> The illusion lasted barely a year.<eos> My marriage to Mr Warleggan was not founded on romance, yet it is altogether more successful.<eos> From Caroline Penvenen.
Because she belonged to Ross and closing' her will hurt 'im.<eos> So, to spite Ross, George would send 70 families into direst poverty?<eos> 'Tis about the size of it.<eos> I'm to be sent back to Trenwith?<eos> Along with Geoffrey Charles.
Especially to one who's grandfather was a blacksmith, as your nephews never ceased to remind me.<eos> Georgie, it was not your grandfather they mocked, but your pitiful attempts to deny him.<eos> That's what you never understood.<eos> This time next year we'll be harvesting oats and barley.<eos> By the grace of God.
The Iliad?<eos> At which part are you now?<eos> Patroclus has just been slain by Hector, and now there is a terrible fight about his body.<eos> For as you know, Vicar, it is of great importance to the Greeks that the funeral rites be performed in full upon the body.<eos> The body, y-yes...
And?<eos> In consideration of the very great sacrifice I would be making, to my principles, to my reputation... .. the very least I could accept is £700.<eos> I've pleaded with him, Vicar, but he says there are things I do not understand.<eos> We will need a cottage.<eos> With furnishings.

Thomas, there are people here that can help you with that.<eos> I also asked them to consider reinstating you as chief of surgery.<eos> You didn't need to do that.<eos> I told them it was ego and hubris that got you fired.<eos> Mine.
Hey, baby, how you feeling?<eos> I've been so worried about you.<eos> They called me after they found you in the elevator.<eos> Dr. Harris has been looking out for me.<eos> For both of you.
- Okay.<eos> Okay.<eos> I'm tired of being Uncle Shahir.<eos> And I want to be a father.<eos> With you.
- Oof. - You gotta be kidding.<eos> - We are, in fact, lovers. - What?<eos> - Lovers.<eos> - Lovers.<eos> With Scab Calloway?
- Immediately, I will resign.<eos> - No, no, no, let's not overreact.<eos> Just take a deep breath, Minna.<eos> You're just in the middle of what we in America call...<eos> - A difficult situation.
And it's none of your damn business!<eos> You are the defendant. You don't get to object.<eos> Well, somebody had to.<eos> Counselor, talk to your client.<eos> Happy to.
It's Cassidy's.<eos> Did something happen?<eos> - When?<eos> - Upstairs?<eos> With Tulip?
And what you're going to do is cancel whatever fancy bullshit hotel you booked, and you're going to stay the night with us.<eos> Marcus, come on, I'm at the Ambassador Suite at the Ritz.<eos> Don't think of saying no because I'm going to tell Katie and the kids that you're here.<eos> You guys offer room service?<eos> If by "room service,"
Yeah, probably to say why her rent was late, because she never paid it.<eos> But we won't know that because we don't have it in writing, which is what the court requires.<eos> Your Honor, I need...<eos> I'd like to request time to confer with my supervisor.<eos> His supervisor?
- And as quietly as possible.<eos> The Martians will, of course, be trying to find her as well.<eos> But they are at a severe disadvantage on the streets of our planet.<eos> Make sure they are stopped frequently by the local authorities and checked for proper identification.<eos> My pleasure.
Looks like he slammed into this shelf,<eos> - falling backwards.<eos> - Yeah, time of death?<eos> From the heavy coagulated blood, full rigor and complete lividity?<eos> Around 10 to 12 p.m. last night.
Preachers aren't allowed to be interested in geography.<eos> That's Catholics.<eos> I can be interested in whatever I want.<eos> So what are you interested in?<eos> God.
It's our only lead to Zahad.<eos> If whoever this leads to is good for this, you put him in the box and call me.<eos> I wanna talk to him.<eos> - Or her?<eos> - Probably him.
- Where were you holding her?<eos> Um... - Oh, here and...<eos> - The throat?<eos> Yeah.<eos> - With two hands?
Yes.<eos> I was just regarding the chandelier.<eos> Originally crafted by artisan glass blowers of Venice, from the little island of Murano.<eos> But this one is made in Pakistan with child labour.<eos> Elegance, but at what cost?
Robin, this is Paul Chen.<eos> He's going to be our chief police counsellor.<eos> - For...?<eos> - For the victims' resolution meeting.<eos> With ex-superintendent Parker.
Show me.<eos> If I had middle fingers, you know what they'd be doing right now?<eos> Start with Popper 31.<eos> Now cross your index and ring fingers.<eos> No, under the middle.
Exactly.<eos> Now, you think you can do that?<eos> Of course I can.<eos> All I need to do is continually expose it to what it's not providing and eventually the feedback loop will show it how to be more like you.<eos> In other words, awesome.
300<eos> - No.<eos> Okay, make it 350 and call it a day.<eos> 500.<eos> Not a penny less.
I'm not asking.<eos> Wedding invitations.<eos> You know, I saw one earlier this morning.<eos> Makes me want to jump over this railing.<eos> With your glass half full,
No. I never told them to do that!<eos> Told who?<eos> Felix's friends.<eos> The ones with...<eos> With the helicopter.
Sometimes it's better. To let your children underestimate you a little.<eos> Well, I hope that, um, We didn't say anything that offended you.<eos> Just the opposite.<eos> Honestly, fernando's always been...<eos> A bit different.
- Oh, my God.<eos> I'm not going.<eos> Ghost is in jail, you runnin' drug money through my shop.<eos> So what if the cops come for you next, Tommy?<eos> And then Tasha.
I'm not going.<eos> Ghost is in jail, you runnin' drug money through my shop.<eos> So what if the cops come for you next, Tommy?<eos> And then Tasha.<eos> And then me.
You killed like millions of people.<eos> I did terrible things.<eos> Here we go again.<eos> Two of your best plum cakes please.<eos> E-Extra flaky crust!
Or what?<eos> Just... don't.<eos> What happened to you, Hitler?<eos> You used to be...<eos> Hitler.
You know, you both are.<eos> I know.<eos> And I definitely bollocksed this one up though, haven't I?<eos> Where you even in danger?<eos> With Viktor?
- What does that mean?<eos> The DNA for the cigarette butt came back.<eos> It's a match for Ray Wilson.<eos> Ray Wilson?<eos> The guy with the airtight alibi?
Just drop the street act, Vince, okay?<eos> You're from Winnetka.<eos> Sit.<eos> Who did she talk to and who did she leave with?<eos> No one.
Her cell phone doesn't lie.<eos> Yeah.<eos> To talk to her ex-boyfriend.<eos> Yeah, but he's not here, so she runs into his dad,<eos> Franklin Barnes.
We found him laying beside a dumpster, missing part of his body that I'm assuming was kind of important to him.<eos> What happened, Emily?<eos> He tried to rape me.<eos> When?<eos> Last night.
Well, someone should be looking for her.<eos> K-9 unit and patrol did a top to bottom search.<eos> There's no one here but her.<eos> - She can't be more than...<eos> - Fifteen.
I'm coming with.<eos> Doesn't have to be somewhere fancy.<eos> Just some place where you can't hear the noise.<eos> Some place quiet.<eos> Empty.
Why not? It's the King's colour.<eos> Red, then.<eos> A rich crimson.<eos> Fashion will be our standard, darling, and the people will walk behind you.<eos> And me.
I understand your anger.<eos> Please! Please!<eos> Speak to His Majesty on the matter.<eos> It can not happen.<eos> Not to me!
I wish to discuss it with His Majesty first.<eos> She is a member of the nobility.<eos> Treat her as you would any other murderer.<eos> Over there, Sire!<eos> Between the trees!
I'd bring you the phone but it's mounted to the wall.<eos> It's old school.<eos> Is it,<eos> Claire you wanted to speak to?<eos> Girlfriend?
Well, don't take it personally.<eos> We're lucky to have a Toronto UC big shot showing us how it's done.<eos> Cardinal worked UC?<eos> I didn't see that in his history.<eos> Deep cover.
I would like a... an STD check.<eos> What, did you graze your penis against a toilet seat?<eos> I... I had sex.<eos> Sex with what?<eos> Female.
I... I had sex.<eos> Sex with what?<eos> Female.<eos> A female what?<eos> A female human.
Enough to get by.<eos> Something I can do for you, dr.<eos> My "sabbatical" was. A world health organization assignment.<eos> I advised nongovernmental emergency medical teams. On how best to respond and treat sods.<eos> Sudden onset disasters.
'Cause my marriage was falling apart. And I was a little bit drunk, And right at that moment, it was true.<eos> Jeff, of course, flipped out, And I mean, if you weren't there, It might've gotten ugly.<eos> And you're just telling me this now?<eos> I know. I should've told you this morning when you asked.<eos> This morning?
Self-conscious is what we're going for.<eos> You know what makes you better at this job?<eos> Being present.<eos> Being honest.<eos> Especially with yourself.
Well, then, same time next week?<eos> You know where to find me.<eos> So, given the patient's age, I was thinking a woven graft with a mechanical valve.<eos> And once we adjust for the inversa, It should be a simple plug and play.<eos> Simple?
You really don't know anything, do you?<eos> There you go, bardi.<eos> There you go.<eos> Cheers, everybody.<eos> Cheers!
Communicate?<eos> Yeah. And she'll be able to. Put together words and sentences.<eos> You'll be able to have a conversation. With your daughter again.<eos> A conversation?<eos> With my little girl?
I'd have a much better idea where she was hiding him if the Director hadn't insisted I wear a hood before going on assignment.<eos> Just awful.<eos> It's hard to breathe in those things, huh?<eos> It is nice having someone here to talk to again ...<eos> - you, specifically.
If you have a headache, I could get the acupuncture needles.<eos> No, the pills are fine.<eos> We have a problem with Agent May.<eos> She's in a better place now.<eos> No, the... the May LMD.
Help me get this table.<eos> They're about to breach that door.<eos> How's your aim?<eos> Talbot ran me through some basic training when I got this job, but I didn't think I'd need it...<eos> With the super-strength and all.
Private person, secrets?<eos> Same thing.<eos> Must be even tougher with May.<eos> If it's better to get to know each other<eos> - in tiny, slow, annoying pieces...
"How does it feel?" How much of me is me?<eos> Am I even me at all? !<eos> I assure you, the real Melinda May is fine.<eos> She's safe and healthy...<eos> and under my protection.
She's safe and healthy...<eos> and under my protection.<eos> I don't care about your assurances.<eos> You had me spy on my own people.<eos> "Your own people"!
Well, yeah, I couldn't say anything with all the Red Shirts hanging around.<eos> - Do you know what he did with it?<eos> - It is secure.<eos> I'd like to help you, but honestly, I have some trust issues.<eos> Trust?
You brought an Inhuman on my ship?<eos> She's a machine.<eos> Aida, release him.<eos> - You... made her?<eos> - With my own hands.
Agent May kept finding the edges of our simulations.<eos> That's no longer a concern, given the Earth has no edges.<eos> It's round.<eos> I understood that conceptually, we were building a world, but I-I didn't expect you would build our entire world.<eos> With slight improvements.
She saw a chance, no matter how slim and risky, and she took it.<eos> I would have.<eos> I know it's not easy to let go.<eos> To let go?<eos> Of May?
_<eos> What was the mission you were on here?<eos> May and I were sent to retrieve an 084.<eos> Years and years ago.<eos> With May?
Ugh.<eos> "Ugh"? Wow. You must really like this guy.<eos> Maybe I'm tired of dating civilians.<eos> Well... maybe if it doesn't work out with this one, you and I can talk about that...<eos> over a drink.
I sometimes wonder what it would've been like if I'd never signed up.<eos> All the loss, the grief...<eos> All my regrets are piled up after that.<eos> Could've lived like a civilian, you know?<eos> The simple life.
She's hacked into the framework.<eos> The two are inside with memories intact, trying to dismantle it.<eos> So now their deaths are required -- and easily achievable.<eos> I simply need you to find them.<eos> With pleasure.
Escape is not an option.<eos> Mack has to stay plugged in.<eos> If we wake him up, it'll fry his brain.<eos> So we need to take control of the space.<eos> By force.
Steph Curry.<eos> He's flying in and, um,<eos> I thought we'd have dinner with him tonight, me and you.<eos> Uh, I have a dinner tonight with Wayne Hastings, so no can do. - Sorry.<eos> - The casino guy?
He's flying in and, um,<eos> I thought we'd have dinner with him tonight, me and you.<eos> Uh, I have a dinner tonight with Wayne Hastings, so no can do. - Sorry.<eos> - The casino guy?<eos> The casino guy, Spencer.
Paul's been in touch with him.<eos> Asking for info.<eos> - What did Linnell say?<eos> - They were friends.<eos> Friends!
Why do they think that?<eos> There's a young girl's voice too.<eos> He's taking pictures.<eos> An SLR. Film.<eos> Not digital.
Be rude, leaving your friend outside waiting.<eos> I want to tell her that Ofglen is not my friend.<eos> That I've exchanged barely 50 words with her in the two months since I got here.<eos> I kind of want to tell her that I sincerely believe that Ofglen is a pious little shit with a broomstick up her ass.<eos> Under His eye.

Morning to you.<eos> Praised be.<eos> The Commander wants you to get more oranges, if they still have any.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> My pleasure.
Under His eye.<eos> Go in Grace.<eos> Blessed be the fruit.<eos> May the Lord open.<eos> Under His eye.

It was better than sex.<eos> Like, good sex.<eos> I always thought you were such a true believer.<eos> So were you.<eos> So frickin' pious.
They had Canadian passports.<eos> I didn't.<eos> I got caught at the airport.<eos> We tried to cross in Maine.<eos> With my husband.
You were gone a while.<eos> Sometimes we walk home along by the river.<eos> You need to be careful.<eos> By the river?<eos> With her.
Sometimes we walk home along by the river.<eos> You need to be careful.<eos> By the river?<eos> With her.<eos> Ofglen.
There's a network.<eos> Waterford is important.<eos> He's very high up.<eos> You need to be careful.<eos> With her...
Did Ofwarren seem well?<eos> Yes.<eos> But I'm afraid she might be losing touch.<eos> Well, that can happen sometimes...<eos> With the weaker girls.
Because she mentioned her wife.<eos> From before.<eos> It was...<eos> It was in passing.<eos> In passing.
Truly.<eos> Mrs. Waterford, I'm not pregnant.<eos> I got my period.<eos> When?<eos> Last night.
Boy, look at these outfits.<eos> It's a parade of sluts.<eos> Take your hands out of your pocket.<eos> Did I say run, you in the vest?<eos> Semicircle!
I offer myself humbly to His judgment, as spoken through this council.<eos> Body and soul shall I give to thee.<eos> Thank you, Commander Putnam.<eos> Go in grace.<eos> Under His eye.
You're later than usually this morning.<eos> I've been waiting for you.<eos> Donna, about the other night.<eos> I know you said you wanted more, but before you say anything... - I want to be a partner.<eos> - Partner?
Good morning, Gretchen.<eos> Have you seen Louis?<eos> I'm worried about how he's doing after last night.<eos> My guess is he's in the bullpen with his hatchlings.<eos> His hatchlings?
She killed herself.<eos> Hung herself from the ceiling.<eos> I don't know.<eos> I suppose she found her life...<eos> Unbearable.
Oh, it's so cute.<eos> And she sticks out her tongue sometimes like this.<eos> You really shouldn't talk about that stuff, Ofwarren.<eos> Hater.<eos> Under His eye.
Shall we make our way, then?<eos> Please, after you.<eos> A pleasure to meet you, Offred.<eos> Blessed be the fruit.<eos> Under His eye.
I owe her.<eos> Your mama gave me the snip a few years back after they made it illegal.<eos> It's no time for kids, you know?<eos> She zonked on something?<eos> Benadryl.
What's her name?<eos> She hasn't said anything since we picked her up.<eos> Here, try and get some rest.<eos> Hey do you want blueberries?<eos> No, chocolate chips.
How's my fair little one this evening?<eos> Fine, thank you.<eos> Up for some excitement?<eos> I thought maybe we could do something different tonight.<eos> Monopoly?
Women aren't allowed.<eos> We must be crossing the Charles into Boston.<eos> Or what used to be Boston.<eos> All clear, sir.<eos> - Under His eye.
We must be crossing the Charles into Boston.<eos> Or what used to be Boston.<eos> All clear, sir.<eos> - Under His eye.<eos> - Under His eye.
Let her be an example to you.<eos> To all of you!<eos> Bye!<eos> I want to help.<eos> With what?
Is this your blessed child?<eos> This is Angela.<eos> Well, hello there, sweet girl.<eos> Ma'am.<eos> Under His eye.
Good work, Inspector.<eos> Well done, sir.<eos> You did it. We did it.<eos> So... whatever happened to, er, Monica Ridley?<eos> Who, her?
He went into one sometimes, trying to make a point.<eos> But it never lasted long.<eos> Well, that's not the impression we have of him.<eos> I mean, he was a successful businessman, wasn't he?<eos> Strong-willed.
But it never lasted long.<eos> Well, that's not the impression we have of him.<eos> I mean, he was a successful businessman, wasn't he?<eos> Strong-willed.<eos> Ruthless, even.
Why would you take that picture?<eos> This thing with the guy, it was making me, I don't know, happy.<eos> I didn't think.<eos> I was in the... afternoon spray, I guess.<eos> What? In the what?
- Yeah, Bobo...<eos> - Waverly can suss out the trailer park.<eos> She can go<eos> - with Officer Haught.<eos> - Agent.
They should be scared of me.<eos> Forget Black Badge.<eos> Remember who the real enemy is.<eos> Who we're really fighting.<eos> Demons.
I tried to help her.<eos> Yeah, you're a real saint.<eos> What have you been up to the last 24 hours?<eos> At home.<eos> With Billy and my nan.
No, it's older.<eos> See the difference between the bruising here and the more recent marks on the neck?<eos> I'd estimate ten days old.<eos> - What caused them?<eos> - A narrow instrument with a round edge.
- Nothing yet.<eos> Can you get started on those red Jag phone calls, Jane?<eos> - Jane?<eos> - Hm?<eos> - Phone calls?
It's a disease -- addiction.<eos> Stop!<eos> - What you doing?<eos> - Checking for indented writing.<eos> Not by that ham-fisted method.
Right, you four with me.<eos> Where'd you go for that warrant?<eos> Timbuktu?<eos> Wait here.<eos> With me.
Where are the other two?<eos> A man we identified as John Bentley was killed in an explosion at the British Savings Bank...<eos> - All right.<eos> Now she knows.<eos> - Daniel Mitcham... and our colleague, Detective Inspector Leonard Bradfield.
What's going on with this guy's face?<eos> Sir, with respect, we have minutes till this thing turns ugly.<eos> All I need is a lean force, maybe a half dozen men in full gear, and your go-ahead.<eos> It'll be a quick operation.<eos> - Minimal casualties.
Thank you.<eos> I need this job.<eos> At least until I've saved enough money to get back to London, and my old life.<eos> I'm guessing you weren't a housemaid.<eos> A dancer. Hm!
"Meet me in the summerhouse, one o'clock.<eos> Bunty."<eos> I think the time has come to arrest Miss Windermere.<eos> He was the loveliest child.<eos> Sunny and good-natured.
Now we can stay like this forever.<eos> No. No, you can't.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Vicky... you still have a chance.<eos> But not with Erin.
I don't know about forever, but maybe we can just settle for the morning?<eos> We could call in sick...<eos> Maybe.<eos> I've got the black lung.<eos> The black lung.
You wanna tell me what's going on? Huh?<eos> Come on, talk to me.<eos> I am a bartender now.<eos> I've just been feeling betwixt and between of late.<eos> - Betwixt and between?
The honor is mine, Your Grace.<eos> Hey. So you're staying?<eos> Like you, I found a new home.<eos> - Like me?<eos> - With the Legends.
We wouldn't make it weird on the ship. That's not what I...<eos> I don't care about that.<eos> I've dated on the ship.<eos> You have?<eos> Who, Sara?
So you keep saying, but how do we get someone out of their own mind?<eos> Well, you have to remind him of who he truly is.<eos> All the artifacts of Captain Hunter's former life<eos> - are located in the...<eos> - The parlor.
In the meantime, when I'm not being Supergirl, I really need to focus on that.<eos> And even if I did have time to date someone, I wouldn't date someone like...<eos> Someone who... Who...<eos> - Who is...<eos> - An intergalactic bartender?
I mean I wanted to check in about us.<eos> I'm... I'm sorry I bailed on your Earth birthday.<eos> You made all those plans.<eos> I made them this morning, it's not a big deal.<eos> This morning?
Told me the truth about what?<eos> When your father and I first got together, it was the happiest time of my life.<eos> But after Lex was born, Lionel started having... an affair.<eos> I was clueless, until I went to surprise him on a business trip, only to find that he was with your mother.<eos> My mother?
- No, I'm fine, it's just...<eos> It's just James and...<eos> Lena Luthor and... It's fine.<eos> Hey! Hey, how's everything going with Mon...<eos> Um, with Mike?
Could've, should've, would've.<eos> It's a... That's a thing I heard at the bar.<eos> It's not...<eos> Yes, but I don't want to do that anymore.<eos> With you.
Tip...<eos> Seize...<eos> Kltpzy...<eos> Kltpzyxm...<eos> Kltpzyxm!
Show yourself, you smug, grand-standing dandy.<eos> Bummer sticks.<eos> It's just you.<eos> I've come to challenge you, Mxyzptlk.<eos> A Daxamite duel?
I didn't think that I'd ever see you again, my friend.<eos> Don't tell the girls, but I'm happy to see you, too.<eos> And, I am here.<eos> So, put me to work.<eos> With pleasure.
We freed them from being treated like animals.<eos> They weren't goods to be traded.<eos> There's that famous Kryptonian exaggeration.<eos> Mon-El, you remember how well your servants were treated at the palace.<eos> Just like family.
Come here and look me in the eyes.<eos> And if you can tell me that you didn't care for me, that I'm just some mark, then I will walk away right now.<eos> You...<eos> Were...<eos> A... Mark.
I'm going for full romance, here.<eos> And you have ruined it.<eos> Okay, that's very sweet.<eos> But there is no way you're getting in the way of me and bacon!<eos> And biscuits!
I can assure you we have nothing to do with this.<eos> Okay, so, if it's not you, why are you still on Earth?<eos> Because we're hoping you'll come to your senses.<eos> Do you know how long we've been searching for you?<eos> Years.
He'll have to live with that for the rest of his life.<eos> And that'll be his hell.<eos> Now, you've done a lot of bad things in your life, but you've done one thing you can be proud of.<eos> You were a father.<eos> A good one.
Great pyramids like the ones we had back home.<eos> And I suppose the humans will build them for you.<eos> If they know what's good for them.<eos> This ship is stocked with Daxam's best.<eos> The leaders, the merchants, the military strategists.
I'm a little shaken up.<eos> I could use a moment to collect myself.<eos> - Is there a restroom I could use?<eos> - Oh, yeah.<eos> - Right around the corner.
Yeah.<eos> She's great, isn't she?<eos> She'll be thrilled to hear you think so.<eos> You came.<eos> With her.
Fire at will.<eos> With pleasure.<eos> Turn it back on, Mother.<eos> I came for you.<eos> Not them.
You think you have a drinking problem?<eos> No.<eos> Have you ever been through any kind of therapy before?<eos> Yeah.<eos> My wife.
Kids, I have no idea who taught you until now. But I know you learned nothing.<eos> You don't even know how to use latrines.<eos> The latrines are dirty.<eos> I want to do planets!<eos> Planets?
Look Mona!<eos> Where did you go last night, when you ran off?<eos> Y... you said there was someone, so I went to see.<eos> - You talked with him?<eos> - With who?
Where did you go last night, when you ran off?<eos> Y... you said there was someone, so I went to see.<eos> - You talked with him?<eos> - With who?<eos> With the man.
So, I'll tell HR, and...<eos> Wait a sec.<eos> You're doing it off the chart?<eos> The chart makes it clear.<eos> And right before bonus time.
We went through that just last visit.<eos> Is there coffee I smell?<eos> It's old.<eos> Hours or days?<eos> This morning.
Yeah, saw him come in earlier.<eos> Why?<eos> Is he in, is he in some kind of trouble?<eos> He's right up there.<eos> Number four.
Those babes are totally vibing our Bozaks.<eos> I'm gonna mack the one on the right.<eos> You Cool with the one on the left?<eos> - Mike, I'm with Lucy.<eos> - Who?
I'm gonna mack the one on the right.<eos> You Cool with the one on the left?<eos> - Mike, I'm with Lucy.<eos> - Who?<eos> My girlfriend, Lucy. Hi.
- What's that got to do with it?<eos> I'd have thought that had everything to do with it, sir.<eos> Well, you'd be wrong, you disruptive oik.<eos> Do me 100 lines, and remember, next time I'll beat you.<eos> With this.
Oh. I see.<eos> One moment's indiscretion and my whole career's in doubt.<eos> If I get fired as a teacher, there really is nothing else one can resort to.<eos> Well, why don't you talk to Dr Fagan?<eos> Or one of his daughters?
Congratulations. I'm sure she's delighted.<eos> Oh, she's as pleased as hell and damn her nasty eyes.<eos> Well, I expect everything will be all right in the end.<eos> I'm sure. Why wouldn't it be?<eos> Well, between us...
Card tricks take soothing focus, time to get right, and delight others.<eos> They can be a real crowd pleaser.<eos> Okay.<eos> So I should do card tricks?<eos> Well, some wellness activity.
Anything they ask, you say, "That's a great question.<eos> But the bigger question is, what is going on in this prison system?"<eos> - Oh, he is good.<eos> - Mmm. Oh, and I personally think it might be helpful if you shared some sort of, um, relatable tribulations from your time in here.<eos> Some painful experiences, uh, injustices...
I need your help.<eos> I have a recording from a CI Greg was running off the books to collar St. Patrick.<eos> But instead, he got Egan confessing to killing Lobos with Ghost.<eos> You fuckin' serious?<eos> With Ghost?
Because he's special?<eos> He ain't like the other boys?<eos> What makes you trust him so much?<eos> Is there something you need to tell me about your relationship with St. Patrick?<eos> With Egan?
A message about-about IRAs and 401s.<eos> You can see it. You can see it, right?<eos> All I see is a girl who needs a vacation.<eos> You think I'm crazy, don't you?<eos> Hmm. Crazy adorable, maybe.
Was it this man?<eos> Shit.<eos> Um, I-I-I would like to plead the Third Amendment.<eos> You want to forbid soldiers from quartering in private homes?<eos> Uh, the 12th Amendment.
I want... I want to take care of all of you, 'cause you spent so much time taking care of me.<eos> And I can't think of a more perfect time to propose than on. Ray and Abby's anniversary.<eos> Terry.<eos> So will you do it, Maureen?<eos> In front of my family here?
I could get you some food.<eos> Chips.<eos> Chips and rice.<eos> Chips and rice and... veg?<eos> Tomato sauce.
Aye, well, some bastard took 'em.<eos> Giving me the third degree.<eos> Seeing if I had spareribs on the menu.<eos> Aye, and I'm still bloody watching you.<eos> And you!
Something doesn't feel right.<eos> Look, do you not think you're getting too close to this?<eos> I mean, I know she's an old friend, but...<eos> Up until a few weeks ago, he was a normal family man.<eos> Hardworking.
Yes, well, it pays very well but the conversation's often lacking.<eos> It's amazing what they can do now, with all this tech.<eos> I suppose you got to be smart these days to be a criminal.<eos> You just need a detective with a massive ego who's happy to bang up the wrong person.<eos> Cheers, everyone.
Not for long.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> What're you saying, Helen?<eos> I slept with someone.<eos> Adam Perrin.
You're not supposed to be here until after the Trevor Hare investigation.<eos> Yeah, I'm not here for that.<eos> I'm here for something else.<eos> I want to report a historic case of child abuse.<eos> Against who?
Please write the following for me.<eos> 77 De Champlain.<eos> Where were you between 7 and 9 p.m. on the evening of the 11th?<eos> Entertaining two Asian young ladies.<eos> In what manner?
I mean it wasn't about you, it was about how he wants to kill himself.<eos> But in it he said that there was one cool thing about where he was and that was he made friends with a guy at work named Dennis.<eos> And I looked you up on the company website.<eos> Thank you for joining us this morning.<eos> This new morning.
Show me your attachment to the perfect form, to perfection.<eos> So how are we doing, John, on this new morning?<eos> Pretty good.<eos> You know, John, I spent some time last night just... Well, pondering how I was going to respond to you this morning.<eos> On this new morning.
Tomorrow would be good. For me.<eos> Tomorrow would be bad. For me.<eos> Rochambeau?<eos> What's the nature of your work?<eos> Circles.
This woman died.<eos> There's no sign of violence.<eos> So, you know, she just died the way that humans do.<eos> Then a few more people died all at the same time, and then a lot more died just after, and then...<eos> ..the rest. Dozens.
Travelling to the past, There's got to be rules.<eos> If I step on a butterfly, it could send ripples through time that mean I'm not even born in the first place - and I could just disappear.<eos> - Definitely.<eos> - That's what happened to Pete.<eos> - Pete?
Doctor...<eos> Don't look at me like that.<eos> I'm saying you're a very good con-man.<eos> - I'm a what?<eos> - A trickster.
I...<eos> Things to do, Bill.<eos> Decisions to make.<eos> What are we doing about Tiny?<eos> - Tiny?
Things to do, Bill.<eos> Decisions to make.<eos> What are we doing about Tiny?<eos> - Tiny?<eos> - The creature.
Decisions to make.<eos> What are we doing about Tiny?<eos> - Tiny?<eos> - The creature.<eos> The loch-less monster.
No, actually.<eos> You said they were "alien"?<eos> Well, they could be native to this planet, but I've never seen them before.<eos> Have you? That's what they're called?<eos> Dryads?
Really, Fritz?<eos> You're proud of your military service?<eos> You may have changed your religion, but don't think for a second you can change your heritage.<eos> Is that how you really see me?<eos> As some sort of fraud?
Is she alright?<eos> I'm not sure.<eos> She is at the hotel renier.<eos> She was escorted by an ss officer.<eos> And his security entourage.
Now, this process, like all natural processes, is... irreversible.<eos> The ice melts.<eos> However, it...<eos> Is there something the matter, Miss Maric?<eos> With me?
Because I fight for her.<eos> Out there.<eos> But here?<eos> In my own home?<eos> With my wife?
People do.<eos> Madam Curie and I are partners.<eos> Please inform the Nobel committee that I will not accept the prize if they do not honor my wife alongside me.<eos> "The introduction of a luminiferous ether will prove to be superfluous."<eos> Superfluous!
No!<eos> You need to level with me.<eos> Okay, Dawn, listen.<eos> It's the boys...<eos> Jacob and Oliver.
Mom?<eos> Hello?<eos> Is anyone home?<eos> Looking for your mom and dad?<eos> Uh, my stepdad. Yes.
And now?<eos> I think, of all the mysteries in the universe, people are the hardest for me to fathom.<eos> But my wife is really quite brilliant.<eos> Have you been with someone in Brussels?<eos> With someone?
Can we come in, love?<eos> - What have I done? - Ah...<eos> What happened to your window?<eos> Yeah, it's smashed.<eos> - What window?
Can I ask you a question?<eos> Yep.<eos> D'ya ever think... y'know, maybe... Maybe you'd want to be me?<eos> - Nope.<eos> - Not me, exactly.
That headline's not gonna help us.<eos> The fella who wrote the article, Tony Pullings.<eos> I know the name.<eos> Know him from years ago, when he was just a photographer.<eos> Pretty good one.
That's why they let him out of prison.<eos> So you got him out.<eos> Well done, you.<eos> Miriam, who were you meeting outside, earlier this evening?<eos> My cousin.
I'm not sorry.<eos> She was a little slut.<eos> Look at her.<eos> She's ready to do that, why not the other?<eos> But with who?
Shelter in Hounslow say they can give Miriam a place by the end of the week and I'm going to ask Father Joe if he'll put Kevin up.<eos> He'll miss the boy.<eos> He's good with him, you know?<eos> Yeah, well, technically he's breaking his terms of bail by being here with you, a felon.<eos> Me? !
I'm leaking these.<eos> Emma, this isn't right.<eos> She's been a person of interest for MI5 and 6 for years.<eos> Who were you meeting outside earlier this evening?<eos> My cousin.
Weeks.<eos> Until then, we have to keep you away from Banville and your colleagues in the press.<eos> Testify about Linda and Russell and you're done.<eos> You won't come across as very admirable but at least you had the guts to own up.<eos> What about the other girls?
I just hope it makes a difference.<eos> How... How are the polls?<eos> Close.<eos> Ah, you'll be fine.<eos> Drinks?
I passed that information on to my government.<eos> It was crucial in the vote to go to war.<eos> So you're... you're admitting to this?<eos> An illicit meeting with a discredited scientist.<eos> Secret, not illicit.
But again... why are you telling me?<eos> Because I think if I add you to the story... the beautiful wife of the new Leader of the Opposition, I think people WILL care.<eos> What on earth are you talking about?<eos> You were on the base that night... Rachel... with your friend.<eos> What friend?
Because I think if I add you to the story... the beautiful wife of the new Leader of the Opposition, I think people WILL care.<eos> What on earth are you talking about?<eos> You were on the base that night... Rachel... with your friend.<eos> What friend?<eos> Her.
What on earth are you talking about?<eos> You were on the base that night... Rachel... with your friend.<eos> What friend?<eos> Her.<eos> Linda Simms.
Such a pittance won't even get Freundlich to the Russian border.<eos> They're obviously trying to deter me altogether.<eos> It's an insult.<eos> Perhaps I could introduce you to Gustav Krupp.<eos> The industrialist?
Forks in the road where he felt he chose the wrong, prong.<eos> Did Peyton mention whether...<eos> Stop. No more.<eos> Talk to her.<eos> Not to me.
That shit again. No, no.<eos> Something better.<eos> A real estate group. You would be the CEO.<eos> I'd simply be a silent partner.<eos> Silent?
All right, so listen up.<eos> Gonna make this quick.<eos> - What up, boy? - A'ight.<eos> There may be a war coming with the Jimenez cartel.<eos> With them Spanish niggas, bro?
He had a foot thing.<eos> Like high heels and all of that?<eos> No.<eos> Foot jobs.<eos> Like hand jobs, but with your feet.
On ice.<eos> They slip on ice in the movie.<eos> We need to kick him in the back of the neck.<eos> Maybe we can do that paint can thing.<eos> Or the tarantula.
How do we know... they won't be bringing the same type of mess back in here again?<eos> The new guards need to be like the ones we used to have.<eos> - You mean fat and lazy?<eos> - I mean trained.<eos> - And human.
Joe?<eos> Joe... are you giving me the silent treatment?<eos> Joe not here.<eos> Went to see giraffe lady.<eos> - Giraffe lady?
I told you she wasn't just a bossy twatwaffle.<eos> Is that you, Vause?<eos> I thought that you hated shower sex.<eos> I'm giving this one last shot.<eos> For you.
I got a real good feeling about this.<eos> Free to be me and me.<eos> Figueroa.<eos> - She could be Latina.<eos> - Or Italian.
Carry on.<eos> No, wait.<eos> I remember now.<eos> You that hostage with the heels.<eos> These heels.
Let me guess, you heard I broke up with Pavel.<eos> Go ahead and gloat.<eos> You broke up with Pavel?<eos> I thought I could change things.<eos> With some jeans.
Goodbye, slop that fills my tummy.<eos> Goodbye, Poussey...<eos> Taystee?<eos> Red balloon.<eos> Over the moon.
Negotiations?<eos> No, no, no, no, no.<eos> I did it for the deal.<eos> What deal?<eos> From whom?
No, no, no, no, no.<eos> I did it for the deal.<eos> What deal?<eos> From whom?<eos> With the guys. They, um...
Here, I will go first. Okay.<eos> My wife, she made sex with our local butcher.<eos> So I made sex with a stewardess.<eos> And then she made sex with a landscape architect, and I made sex with a history teacher, and a jazz singer, and a secretary and a waitress.<eos> No... two waitresses.
Whatever.<eos> It was all a big, fat lie.<eos> Most of the men I knew couldn't even run up a flight of stairs, let alone leap tall buildings or fly.<eos> - Maybe I should get a yin-yang?<eos> - Lame.
I miss you.<eos> I don't know what I'm doing.<eos> Shalom.<eos> I don't know what I'm doing.<eos> Shalom.
Guy sounds like a religious fanatic to me.<eos> Maybe, or maybe he was just a leader willing to do whatever it took to save his people.<eos> Look who's back.<eos> Thought you ran off with your...<eos> Girlfriend.
But you didn't?<eos> I ended it because of her sadism.<eos> She genuinely... hated people.<eos> I know I should have run a mile from her, but... ..she was so... alluring back then.<eos> So... dangerous.
He is worn with this fucking form, like a child.<eos> I would not worry.<eos> It just helps to produce gunpowder.<eos> He's working on something else.<eos> Over something awful.
We can live on, and it will disappear.<eos> Once and for all.<eos> Well?<eos> She finally agreed.<eos> But a terrible price.
- What?<eos> God, so excited. And then they put me in the year-long coma.<eos> And I would lie in that hospital bed, just feeling powerless.<eos> And then season three, I graduate to a wheelchair<eos> - with, like, a sad blanket...
Just like the big guys, but girls.<eos> Get it?<eos> Girl on girl.<eos> - What?<eos> - So, like, Hulk Hogan?
How you doing?<eos> It's a big crowd out there.<eos> Yup.<eos> At the beginning of every play, I pick something in the audience to look at.<eos> A funny shirt, a broken chairback.
Then I exorcise the trickster for you.<eos> After you pay.<eos> Thank you.<eos> $1 million?<eos> In gold.
It was destroyed by other books.<eos> "Future Movements of Magic"<eos> was written by a Polish scientist who happened to be a...<eos> What?<eos> Jew.
Hey.<eos> What's that?<eos> You remember that one time<eos> Richard and the Free Traders rewound time?<eos> - DéjÃ pizza?
I mean, I thought you were going to ride over the hilltop and take me away to live a wild life amongst the gipsies.<eos> I know what I want, so if you want to look at the menu...<eos> Yes, I already looked.<eos> You would have had to fight Julia for me, you know?<eos> The child thief. The interloper.
I called the various shelters, but until we find them permanent homes, my animals, their time's running out faster than mine.<eos> Is there no one that you can trust to help you get things up and running?<eos> I'm trying to find someone, but it's hard to do interviews from this bed.<eos> Oh. [Coughs] [monitors beeping rapidly] I-I...<eos> Elias?
You mean wage war.<eos> No, we mean button some messy shit up.<eos> Help us here.<eos> We want to make this work.<eos> Respectfully.
What on earth are you doing inside this boy?<eos> Friar Joseph, I-- I've been searching for you.<eos> I need your help.<eos> With him.<eos> This crushable little field mouse?
The things that I know now you cannot imagine.<eos> That's what I want.<eos> Please, can I go with you?<eos> You?<eos> With me?
I do.<eos> But it's more fun with you.<eos> From "The Book of Dana Wallens."<eos> "His adoptive mother christened him<eos> John Spencer Gaines."
I spoke to your old boss. At the reichsmuseum just this morning.<eos> Really?<eos> I don't know how you put up with that man.<eos> He bored me to death.<eos> In one phone call.
I thought you had.<eos> Another one with you.<eos> He's holed up with supplies.<eos> Let's collect him and get on with it then.<eos> Gladly.
Hey, you kids hear the latest on Rolf's green card?<eos> - Did it finally get approved?<eos> - I doubt it. You know how Rolf's been telling everybody that he's Austrian?<eos> Well, it turns out his grandfather was German.<eos> Very German.
The thing you should know right off the top,<eos> Cheryl was a huge gossip.<eos> - Ah... - There it is.<eos> Just the worst, God rest her soul.<eos> An absolute nightmare.
So, I wouldn't.<eos> All right, people, Kevlar up!<eos> This is not a drill!<eos> This is the real deal!<eos> With real bullets!
Hey.<eos> He's fighting the net.<eos> Not sure how much longer I can hold this.<eos> Jesus Christ, Julia, would you please just gut this guy?<eos> With pleasure.
Oh, darling, I've loved having you around the house.<eos> I can't bear the thought of you having to go back to that Welsh school.<eos> Do write to Dr Fagan and tell him you won't be going back?<eos> What else could I do?<eos> Journalism?
Where are we at with this, Meg?<eos> Do you notice anything about this film?<eos> If it was filmed with a mobile or a handheld camera, it would be wobbling or moving around.<eos> This is filmed with a decent camera.<eos> Probably a triplex system.
I bet your mum's delighted.<eos> Irene.<eos> I saw you in the style section and said, "Airbrushed.<eos> There is no way someone can run Ireland's premier..."<eos> Premier.
Bye, Lucy.<eos> Remember our first time in here?<eos> The Johnson case?<eos> We were so young.<eos> Too young.
She's evicting you because she wants Sean out.<eos> Eve, we found some evidence a while back --<eos> Eve, I'm really sorry, but Sean has been unfaithful to you.<eos> Yeah.<eos> With Ada.
Hey.<eos> So, how do you end up on a houseboat?<eos> I had to put an ocean between myself and someone.<eos> A lover?<eos> A gangster.
- Did you write this?<eos> - Course I wrote it.<eos> "The interior would benefit from some minor attention."<eos> - Well, it would.<eos> - With a hand grenade.
This is the future?<eos> Yes.<eos> You've been doing some time skipping.<eos> What happened to you?<eos> To us?
Where are we?<eos> What were you doing on that station?<eos> I was trying to stop a bombing.<eos> Kal, was he with you?<eos> Six.
[THREE] If it's that easy to steal, I might start to like it here.<eos> [THE ANDROID] I also rented us a house under Two's alias.<eos> You really think we'll be there that long?<eos> It's better to be safe than sorry.<eos> And... homeless.
[JAKE] I don't get it.<eos> Who they spying on?<eos> [BOY] It's not who.<eos> It's what.<eos> --Okay, what?
Where were you?<eos> I was just fixing a faulty relay switch.<eos> No. Where were you last night?<eos> I waited for you.<eos> Last night?
Why isn't the ship locked down?<eos> It's The Android's doing.<eos> She must have initiated a series of firewalls when she detected my intrusion.<eos> Can you get around them?<eos> Eventually.
There might be one or... One or two items.<eos> So is it tabor you're worried about or his stuff?<eos> What? No, he was my friend.<eos> My mentor...<eos> Your meal ticket.
Watch it blow up in our faces again?<eos> - We make terrible heroes.<eos> - Okay. If you're looking for a practical angle, how 'bout this.<eos> The colonies we help now will be in a position to help us in the future, if we should ever need them.<eos> Supplies, information, safe haven.
This isn't your battle anymore.<eos> And the workers have given you the power to make a deal on their behalf?<eos> We can reinforce any agreement we make.<eos> - We?<eos> - Me and my ship.
I already told you, in the alternate universe, the crew of the raza never lost their memories.<eos> I know, but I was kinda thinking the alternate me might be something different.<eos> ...Like what?<eos> ...Oh, I don't know.<eos> Concert pianist?
You never had a chance to experience the crescendo, baby.<eos> That's because I was disappointed in your pianissimo.<eos> [Three] Okay, I think we've exhausted the musical euphemisms.<eos> Can we go back to threatening each other's lives?<eos> ...Gladly.
We're losing him.<eos> How are you feeling?<eos> Tired.<eos> Confused.<eos> Sore.
I...<eos> I wish I could, I really do, but I'm down to an eighth of a tank, and I'm gonna need every drop to find my son.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Do me a favor, and just sleep on it, all right?<eos> All right.
I mean, why not?<eos> Be fun to get to know him a little.<eos> - Yeah, that's... that's really, really sweet, but we... - Me and Benson sort of have this deal worked out where we have to run that sort of thing by each other before we introduce Johnny to a...<eos> Our new...<eos> anyone new.
- Okay.<eos> I need your strength.<eos> Your restraint.<eos> Be The Light.<eos> Righteous and good.
Your restraint.<eos> Be The Light.<eos> Righteous and good.<eos> Give me your strength, your patience.<eos> Righteous and good.
Cal and I together, we're handling this.<eos>  Lately, at the center, when someone has a problem or someone needs help with anything, they come to me, and I help them if I can, and if I can't, I tell them straightup.<eos> Because they know I'll be honest with them, even when the truth hurts.<eos>  The Movement is stronger than ever.<eos> In you, clearly.
He killed Steve!<eos>  He was already dead!<eos> The moment he had cancer, it told you.<eos> It told all of us that he was a man.<eos> Just a man!
Your friends wouldn't have to say good-bye.<eos> I haven't told them... that I'm... running out of time.<eos> You don't have to be out of time.<eos> You could stay here.<eos> With me, together.
We're all Librarians.<eos> You okay?<eos> You with the family now.<eos> And you are a Librarian.<eos> Gift or no gift.
Max, that's disgusting.<eos> Oh, you're right.<eos> This isn't mine.<eos> Ah, found a purse...<eos> Under this syringe.
Please, there has got to be a way we can work something out.<eos> We'll do anything.<eos> Well, she will.<eos> I'll do over the shirt stuff.<eos> Your shirt.
You're fired.<eos> That's the worst news I've heard since you said "you're hired."<eos> There's a tug coming to swap out the toilet tanks.<eos> I am putting you two on it.<eos> As captains?
Um, I'm more than just a dusty rando.<eos> I'm his dusty ex-girlfriend.<eos> Also, well played.<eos> He has friend potential.<eos> Not helpful friend.
Not helpful friend.<eos> Just "tell you what not to wear" friend.<eos> Well, it's still early, so hopefully Randy hasn't left... oh, my God, free cookies!<eos> And cucumber water!<eos> With berries!
"Hey, you're cute.<eos> Want to see my horse?"<eos> Because a lady waits for a gentleman to ask to see her horse.<eos> I don't know what ladies you're hanging out with.<eos> Apparently none.
I have terms...<eos> A dozen laser sessions, at least.<eos> And one of them is, I don't talk about my clients.<eos> What happens in my office is sacrosanct. I don't talk about my sessions with you or anyone.<eos> Not even your husband?
Don't believe you.<eos> Because if you did, you wouldn't be asking me to snitch.<eos> Axelrod banished you. He made you a Ronin.<eos> I'm willing to bet he didn't give it a moment's thought, while you've been thinking about it every second of the day, suffering from something you've never felt before.<eos> Doubt.
Whatever you feel is best.<eos> You're seeming... shy tonight.<eos> We can't escape our nature.<eos> Enough with the Myers-Briggs, Mafee.<eos> - Cheers.
You're seeming... shy tonight.<eos> We can't escape our nature.<eos> Enough with the Myers-Briggs, Mafee.<eos> - Cheers.<eos> - Cheers.
- Cheers.<eos> - Cheers.<eos> The man here yet?<eos> - Nah, I haven't seen him.<eos> - Cheers.
You were the only person who could've told her about that.<eos> So please, tell me, what did you say to my wife?<eos> She was under the impression that our no-session arrangement came from you.<eos> I corrected her.<eos> The words.
So please, tell me, what did you say to my wife?<eos> She was under the impression that our no-session arrangement came from you.<eos> I corrected her.<eos> The words.<eos> The actual words.
And bring your wallet.<eos> You do anything disgusting with your daddy's money?<eos> Excuse me?<eos> Raucous party, orgies with buttered-up fatties?<eos> Rubenesque, please.
- What is it?<eos> - Animal testing.<eos> Aye.<eos> Ma'am, a lot of this stuff seems kind of weird, doesn't it?<eos> Weird?
Now, Amy, for the first time in a long time, - I feel like myself. - Mm-hmm.<eos> Or, you know, at least the person I'm supposed to feel like.<eos> Anyway, the only question that I do have is do you think that I can be dating someone who's...<eos> - So much younger?<eos> - No, Muslim.
Well, the important Lisa found the diary.<eos> Yes, yes, I understand. later spoke again.<eos> Soon there.<eos> Who?<eos> sister.
- Nothing, it's just...<eos> Between us, of course.<eos> - Of course.<eos> - I just found out that Sarah lets the kids see their father.<eos> - Oh, Eddie.
- How are you?<eos> - Well, put it this way.<eos> I didn't score many at the cricket, but I certainly had the runs last night.<eos> - Hospital said the symptoms resembled arsenic poisoning.<eos> - Arsenic?
She's working for him now.<eos> And to have a look at poor Bosey.<eos> He's not been well the last week.<eos> _<eos> Not in front of the vicar, Rosie.
Annie loves animals.<eos> But she doesn't love him.<eos> She'll come around.<eos> Even now?<eos> With the baby?
I haven't chicken-proofed those sinks.<eos> All right, I'm closing my eyes and then I'm coming in.<eos> Isn't he brave?<eos> So did he bravely go where no man has gone before?<eos> Under your sweater?
Now it makes sense that Earl asked me for wampum yesterday.<eos> Okay, so my mom is throwing this party at our house tomorrow.<eos> You want to meet my family?<eos> I'd love to meet them!<eos> Especially your mom.
She hot?<eos> Cause I don't like uggos, Ma.<eos> She's gorgeous.<eos> She looks like me.<eos> Just with a little more mustache.
Starting to think the Splenda packet I came out for wasn't worth it.<eos> - Hey, gorgeous.<eos> - Hello, yourself, beautiful.<eos> Bobby, great news... guess what we're doing tomorrow night?<eos> Tomorrow night?
Hey.<eos> What's up?<eos> You foxes want next?<eos> We can go shirts/skins.<eos> Skins/skins.
No one's bothering anybody.<eos> - Not a chicken doinker, so.<eos> - Really?<eos> 'Cause it looks to me like you freakin' chicken doinkers...<eos> Mega freaking chicken doinkers!
What are you doing?<eos> You should suck his neck.<eos> Hi, um, we have Molly.<eos> In this bag.<eos> Under all this shrimp.
This company needs a big idea that you haven't delivered.<eos> So I suggest you take my lead on this because I know what I'm doing.<eos> Okay, Van hired me for a reason.<eos> Yeah, because the other people didn't work out.<eos> - What other people?
I've developed a serum that could potentially undo the memory loss that accompanies the second zombie cure.<eos> The serum is completely ineffective.<eos> It won't be long before you have an episode too severe for that inhaler to help.<eos> This is the real deal!<eos> With real bullets!
Lots of them.<eos> That's great news.<eos> Yeah, but I don't recognize any of them.<eos> They're all just rando dudes.<eos> - Rando dudes into kinky-ass...
Yeah?<eos> You ready, Mrs. Underwood?<eos> I'll have a car waiting for you.<eos> So do you want the good news or the bad news first?<eos> Always the bad.
I know him. He's resourceful.<eos> Right now they're under an overhang, out of the rain.<eos> His son Peter was one of the 100.<eos> I'm doing this.<eos> Bellamy!
I'm doing this.<eos> Bellamy!<eos> Bellamy, turn around!<eos> Bellamy, what the hell happened?<eos> Bellamy.
He doesn't like to talk about that stuff.<eos> (SMACKS LIPS) Personally, I think it adds to his mystique.<eos> There's something to be said for pride in your work.<eos> I have pride in mine.<eos> My place, my girls.
(SMACKS LIPS) Personally, I think it adds to his mystique.<eos> There's something to be said for pride in your work.<eos> I have pride in mine.<eos> My place, my girls.<eos> Hmm... Like this little one.
No, that was the problem.<eos> She wouldn't tell us.<eos> Said it was no business of ours.<eos> But did you get the feeling it was friends?<eos> Or boyfriends?
I mean... she'd been coming here since...<eos> Well, forever, really.<eos> She'd been a Saturday girl.<eos> So she was working for you just prior to her disappearance?<eos> On and off.
Let's go inside.<eos> She hadn't been herself the last few months.<eos> She got really... teenage.<eos> - In what way "teenage"?<eos> - Well, unreliable.
So I used to drive into town after dark.<eos> The place was so full of life.<eos> Sit there, waiting, watching.<eos> Hoping to catch a glimpse of her.<eos> Just a glimpse...
Not on the wages he pays us, no.<eos> You prefer the village pub.<eos> That place wouldn't stay open without us.<eos> Course, you were in the pub the night Mia Hinkin went missing, weren't you?<eos> Along with your mate, Blazej Bobienski.
It's not mine.<eos> Oh, come on. Breathe.<eos> Wait. They've surrounded the house.<eos> We can still make it to the tunnels.<eos> A for effort.
We'll get there.<eos> We're doing it again, aren't we?<eos> Walking away from a battle?<eos> Leaving them empty-handed?<eos> Not empty-handed.
Just the right amount.<eos> Harper.<eos> I get it.<eos> Duty calls.<eos> Hey, hey. Hey.
Okay...<eos> We got a line on a truck transporting HMX to Buffalo this afternoon.<eos> We'll hit it here, somewhere in this empty stretch off State Route 17.<eos> - How many guard vehicles?<eos> - Zero.
This door hasn't been opened since 2015.<eos> We've got the same thing at our door.<eos> Same here.<eos> Something's wrong.<eos> On me.
She's gonna pay.<eos> You're in pretty low gear today.<eos> I been dating Nikki.<eos> - Freddy's girlfriend?<eos> - Ex-girlfriend.
Really?<eos> I thought you were...<eos> It is such an honor to meet you, Mr. Riley.<eos> Oh, my God, if I were a kid today, I... your just... your poster would just be right between<eos> Albert Einstein and Marie Curie.
Here, is this the restaurant?<eos> Yeah, this is it.<eos> I was watching for a truck over there and...<eos> Weller was sitting right in that window with a... with a woman.<eos> Who?
- That's right.<eos> - Wanna bum-rush the front door?<eos> That's fine by me.<eos> But what are you gonna do about the trip wire?<eos> - What trip wire?
Tell me what else you remember.<eos> Bladder blade and Richardson retractor.<eos> I remember the smell.<eos> What did it smell like?<eos> Vegetable soup.
It was at this booth where, uh, my ex-wife and I had lunch during our eighth grade class trip to the Statue of Liberty.<eos> And I got seasick on the ferry ride out there.<eos> It was awful, until she kissed me.<eos> Right? And that happened right here.<eos> Right here at this booth.
You both are.<eos> Which is... why I want you both in on this.<eos> I know the hostess at Bouley.<eos> - I can get us a res for dinner tonight.<eos> - Tonight?
Well, uh, maybe this'll cheer you up.<eos> - Booking agent saw us play last week. - Yeah?<eos> Wants us to be part of an East Coast tour.<eos> It's just gonna be us, couple of other great jazz bands, we're gonna be playing on actual stages...<eos> - ...to actual crowds.
We love cake!<eos> We love cake! We love cake!<eos> One, two, three!<eos> Eyes closed.<eos> Eyes closed.
You're acting like a crazy person.<eos> - What's going on?<eos> - Okay, I found out.<eos> I found out that you were gonna go on tour with your ex-boyfriend.<eos> My ex-boyfriend?
- Yes.<eos> Come on.<eos> - No, uh-uh.<eos> No, I am slinking in when the lights go down, back row, and then, when you take your bow, I'm-I'm sneaking out, successfully avoiding the entire Pearson clan.<eos> Especially Kate.
Where-where are we going?<eos> - Why are you...?<eos> - I've got to get to work.<eos> Hey, what, you're gonna leave me here with a floundering career<eos> - and a lukewarm Americano?
Oh, she's... following her dreams.<eos> No one's dreams are in Cleveland.<eos> Well, it's Cleveland, and then Boston, then New York, Trenton, Philly.<eos> She's on tour with her Ben.<eos> Her band.
You want a banana?<eos> Something to put in your stomach?<eos> No, no, I'll be fine.<eos> My God, woman packed a half a produce department in here.<eos> With instructions.
Okay.<eos> Is it possible, Mr. Haller... and I'm not a psychiatrist, so... but is it possible that this whole thing... the girl, the incident... that it's just part of your illness, a delusion?<eos> Yes, sure, fine.<eos> Well, how do you explain what happened to Lenny?<eos> Or all of them?
Excuse the state, we're in the process of moving floors.<eos> No worries.<eos> Right.<eos> How can I help you?<eos> Legal advice.
I'm ready and able, sir.<eos> Whatever it takes.<eos> Do you mind if I ask if you're having a meeting with Kate, too?<eos> I can hardly meet her for a drink, can I?<eos> An attractive young woman like that.
He pleaded guilty because he was guilty.<eos> Was it your idea not to test that out on a jury?<eos> What went on between myself and my client is privileged.<eos> So you never discussed the case with Nick Huntley?<eos> Or Roz Huntley?
- No?<eos> No, sir.<eos> This wasn't me, sir.<eos> For years, the security in this department has been watertight, fella.<eos> Absolutely watertight.
You were going to lose more than your hand.<eos> You were going to lose your arm, or your life.<eos> You did this to me... because you'd thought I'd had an affair.<eos> No, you did this to yourself.<eos> All your lies.
We'll keep you clean.<eos> I just need an opportunity.<eos> There's a library. At the far end of the south hall.<eos> Good.<eos> The other night...
He helped us. Build helene bauer's cover.<eos> I've convinced him. To offer a few. Of the museum's best pieces to be displayed in the hall tonight.<eos> In honour of the historic occasion. He'll give us access. To the art before it's delivered.<eos> And we'll use that to smuggle in a bit. Of explosive, about this much.<eos> As well as pencil fuse.
Wail in agony.<eos> Okay. Um...<eos> The men never died.<eos> She harvests them for food.<eos> Who?
Okay. Um...<eos> The men never died.<eos> She harvests them for food.<eos> Who?<eos> - Koontar, the Man-Eater...
I'm Sheila.<eos> Anything to add?<eos> No, I... I think it's pretty clear.<eos> They call me Machu Picchu, the Peruvian Fortress.<eos> Strong and proud.
All right, how about wolf lady?<eos> Oh. Oh, no.<eos> We're in a bit of a:<eos> Really?<eos> Debbie and now her?
- Aren't we?<eos> Yes, we are.<eos> - Bye. Love you.<eos> We're gonna have a good time, aren't we?<eos> Yeah, with Meemaw and Ron.
It's someone you really know, and, uh, who really knows you.<eos> - Sounds like horse was less than steely.<eos> - Oh, no.<eos> The horse was steely.<eos> Exhaustingly steely.
Yes. Walking around, checking out the city.<eos> Mr. McClaren was stabbed shortly after he says you parted company.<eos> Where did you go after you left the company of Mr. McClaren?<eos> I was expected at a business dinner.<eos> With my superior, Leslie Claret.
I failed to attend that dinner... because I'm in grossly over my head here.<eos> I was unprepared for the technical specifics of that meeting.<eos> And I spent time that evening attempting to gain footing on the narrow and obscure engineering specific to our field.<eos> After I left the company of Dennis McClaren, I walked to the Haupfhausen Western European Technical Library, and I spent time analyzing the engineering necessary for that evening's meeting.<eos> In what manner?
Sorry I came on so strong with the liar business.<eos> Sometimes to get people's attention, I have to play to my strengths which is to go a little dark, I guess.<eos> I'm not an All-American Boy.<eos> I get the Headless Horseman thing a lot.<eos> Dark grim thing.
I was going through with my cart, looking for them Mrs. Paul fish sticks and the Hungry-Man dinners.<eos> Love me the mashed potatoes in a Hungry-Man dinner.<eos> I really can't see where we would've crossed paths.<eos> - You see... - No.<eos> Right there, by the ice cream and the Puddin' Pops.
Yes.<eos> Yes, it is.<eos> Look, here's GLOW.<eos> Right between Dr. Gene Scott and a new animated show called Miyamoto Musashi.<eos> Ah. Between a nutjob televangelist and an oriental cartoon.
Then I spent all my money on... the crack.<eos> So, my husband said, "It's either me or the crack."<eos> I chose the crack.<eos> Crack should be my middle name.<eos> And also my first and my last name.
...you could order up a doctor like delivery pizza.<eos> Ew!<eos> Um, you know, I don't want to talk about it.<eos> A respected member of the community at your service.<eos> The ultimate personal touch.
Doctors?<eos> Okay, so, I have to go.<eos> - What?<eos> ! - Why?<eos> Just downstairs.
It's kind of our dynamic, you know?<eos> And we talked about how that's not healthy.<eos> High-stress, the push-pull.<eos> What did you mean, "the vapor"?<eos> - The what?
You can't.<eos> We could... hold hands.<eos> Can I be honest?<eos> It's really uncomfortable for me.<eos> Even with the gloves.
Sorry.<eos> Alaska.<eos> No, you don't play like this. Shh!<eos> I talk to myself sometimes, too.<eos> Well, not myself.
Alaska.<eos> No, you don't play like this. Shh!<eos> I talk to myself sometimes, too.<eos> Well, not myself.<eos> The... the voices.
We are a family.<eos> A happy one.<eos> Or would be, if my brother could be with us.<eos> And you? Here?<eos> With the King?
Sir Richard.<eos> Enjoy.<eos> So, you've had to dine alone.<eos> You look exactly as Mother did when our father was with his mistress.<eos> Jane Shore.
- I think we were wrong.<eos> - No.<eos> The whole approach.<eos> Treating him...<eos> like the others.
I'd catch him talking to people who weren't there.<eos> "Who were you talking to?"<eos> And he would say, "King."<eos> The dog.<eos> Your dog.
Good.<eos> Now, I want you to imagine a classroom.<eos> A what?<eos> A classroom.<eos> With a blackboard.
And he... it poisoned me, my whole life.<eos> It made me... it made me crazy.<eos> And it fed on me.<eos> To what end?<eos> Power.
- We don't care!<eos> Make sure you don't blow this.<eos> - So if you want to make it out of here...<eos> - Alive.<eos> - With both hands.
- With no tricks.<eos> - No knockout drugs.<eos> - No poison.<eos> - And no secret messages written in...<eos> - Ketchup.
Good God, no.<eos> I couldn't find a single one willing to take you in.<eos> Not after what happened to the last three.<eos> Uh, two.<eos> No, four.
Make 'em cry.<eos> Give 'em what they want.<eos> Just when you've got 'em right in the palm of your hand...<eos> You hit 'em with the goods...<eos> Your message.
Give 'em what they want.<eos> Just when you've got 'em right in the palm of your hand...<eos> You hit 'em with the goods...<eos> Your message.<eos> Your pièce de résistance.
What about Jennifer?<eos> The enemy is here, doing God knows what with this technology.<eos> If they can do what I think they can, then we have to find them immediately.<eos> When are we leaving?<eos> First light.
Hiya, scientists.<eos> Dear God.<eos> She's back.<eos> What were they?<eos> Protectors.
Cassie, this...<eos> As long as it's on your wrist... It means we'll always find our way back to each other.<eos> Wearing this... means that somehow, someway... you're always gonna find your way back to her.<eos> Sometimes I think we are just stuck in a loop.<eos> No matter what.
Just move your ass. I haven't got time to walk you through it.<eos> Suite with the light.<eos> I'm going in.<eos> Cover my rear.<eos> Whoa, whoa, whoa.
What about the kid?<eos> We know what he becomes.<eos> If we kill them, maybe he changes.<eos> Becomes something else.<eos> Something better.
We can't.<eos> - If the guardians see us...<eos> - We can't just leave him.<eos> Not with them.<eos> Not with her.
There was a time when my purpose was everything.<eos> Made me feel important even though I was being used.<eos> Well, you got played.<eos> That's not my DNA.<eos> Mine either.
We finally know where they're all gonna be.<eos> We're being pulled back.<eos> - We gotta go after them.<eos> We'll come back to this moment.<eos> Armed and ready.
Armed and ready.<eos> Stop him once and for all.<eos> Mr. Cole, your temporal signatures jumped locations.<eos> What the hell happened back there?<eos> Merry Christmas.
- Oh... - Please. Enjoy the beauty of your decadence.<eos> Ladies and gentlemen, I crave your indulgence.<eos> A moment of your time, if you please.<eos> Or, rather, a game.<eos> In three rounds.
One based on destruction.<eos> One that I have fled from my entire life.<eos> Yet, for the first time, with you, I see a life that is my own.<eos> - Miss...<eos> - Wonderfully undefined.
You lying bastard!<eos> Such craftsmanship.<eos> Such skill.<eos> Surely you could have done what I asked by now, unless you have merely enjoyed taking my money.<eos> Under the counter.
Tender words spoken by a man just years removed from picking the bones of those weaker than he.<eos> I've denied what I'm supposed to be.<eos> Vile.<eos> Lost.<eos> Lonely.
You were crying.<eos> And small.<eos> And I knew that you were...<eos> Good?<eos> Nothing.
That's what this was?<eos> Just a long con.<eos> What were you made to be?<eos> Look what they've turned you into.<eos> Weak.
Just a long con.<eos> What were you made to be?<eos> Look what they've turned you into.<eos> Weak.<eos> Small.
You better be able to do it again.<eos> 10 months ago, I went undercover at the CIA recruitment facility known as The Farm.<eos> - Undercover?<eos> - For the FBI.<eos> With your ex-husband.

I knew 'em a fair bit.<eos> Cindy and winslow were like soul-sisters. And Stan I used to see at skating practice before winslow gave it up.<eos> Where were you on Monday at 4:00 A.M.?<eos> He was in bed sleeping.<eos> Next to me.
I'm sorry.<eos> I was just a little, um, spaced out.<eos> My husband killed Stan and Cindy chen.<eos> My daughter confessed to me last night that she's been having... Relations with my husband.<eos> Her stepfather.
"Control" may be an overstatement.<eos> What we're seeing here is raw power lashing out, but you can learn to use it, take control.<eos> First we have to find your triggers.<eos> What happened right before this?<eos> Right before the fight with Philly?
We don't know.<eos> Where's Marcus?<eos> He was in the tower.<eos> We sent some people for him,<eos> Bellamy, and Octavia.
Thelonious, we can save them.<eos> O, I'm gonna need some time.<eos> Wait. What?<eos> Bellamy, they don't have t...<eos> Bellamy?
O.?<eos> Hey, O., are you there?<eos> - Bellamy, can you hear me?<eos> - Are you there, O.?<eos> - Bellamy...
May we meet again.<eos> May we meet again.<eos> Hey...<eos> Do they have her?<eos> Bellamy?
Put this back on now.<eos> Clarke?<eos> We'll wait as long as we can.<eos> Come on, Clarke.<eos> Bellamy.
But question - how did you know that the gun was up the chimney?<eos> An egg.<eos> Jackdaws nest in chimneys.<eos> 'And when I found a jackdaw egg so close to the house, 'I knew that Raymond must have cleared his out.'<eos> But why now, in this warm summer?
How much did that cost you?<eos> A rather fine bottle of Scotch.<eos> Sergeant, you are a good man.<eos> Some of my strawberry scones.<eos> Extra cream.
Well, I made that miniature.<eos> If there was a clue, I would've seen it.<eos> I don't doubt your acuity, but we all have our blind spots.<eos> What do you two think you're doing?<eos> Detective games?
If there was a clue, I would've seen it.<eos> I don't doubt your acuity, but we all have our blind spots.<eos> What do you two think you're doing?<eos> Detective games?<eos> Amateur sleuths?
Well, no, I didn't quite...<eos> You told her what?<eos> All I did was advise her to tell the truth.<eos> Sometimes, it has a way of setting you free.<eos> Free.
I mean, I know he looks tough, but he was so... protective.<eos> I agree.<eos> He was a regular at mass.<eos> I always thought him... a good man.<eos> "Good"?
Not yet.<eos> We can't prove this comes from Verity.<eos> And we don't even know what she was accusing Maurice of doing.<eos> If Verity was pregnant, surely we should be speaking to the father?<eos> Well, that piano player.
We can't prove this comes from Verity.<eos> And we don't even know what she was accusing Maurice of doing.<eos> If Verity was pregnant, surely we should be speaking to the father?<eos> Well, that piano player.<eos> Oscar?
Anything.<eos> Maurice was being blackmailed.<eos> And I need to know by who and why.<eos> I don't know who, but... ..Maurice had an arrangement with some men.<eos> Erm, customers.
Maurice was being blackmailed.<eos> And I need to know by who and why.<eos> I don't know who, but... ..Maurice had an arrangement with some men.<eos> Erm, customers.<eos> Wealthy.
Can you tell me where that lives, in your body?<eos> In my hands.<eos> They're shaking so bad, and I don't know what to do. They're shaking so bad, and I don't know what to do.<eos> Stay with that.<eos> Your hands.
It wasn't wasn't that weird. .<eos> Well, the girls at the salon told me that there was this group that if you disobeyed their leader, he'd make you lick the floor with your tongue.<eos> So, I mean, it's no wonder you'd get a little...<eos> A little what?<eos> A little jumpy.
I have to get my bus.<eos> It is so good to see Chloe. It is so good to see Chloe.<eos> I haven't caught up with her in forever.<eos> She seems... happy.<eos> Really happy.
You love solving our puzzles.<eos> And you're good at it.<eos> You're gifted.<eos> Behind all the puzzles...<eos> Well, all of science, really...
That'd... that'd be great.<eos> I guess it would help if I understood what services you performed so that I can get the amount right.<eos> I delivered the pizza.<eos> What kind of pizza?<eos> - The meat lovers.

Well, what about Riggs?<eos> Uh, Riggs, we can ask after he's done talking to your mom.<eos> Whenever he's done doing what?<eos> - Talking to your mother.<eos> - My what?
Annie and her husband never said hi, never waved.<eos> Right after they moved onto our road, they started to build the wall around their place.<eos> Not a fence... a wall, like a fortress.<eos> - They seemed a little...<eos> - Private.

But my business is making sure this hospital runs.<eos> And right now, some people are making that very hard.<eos> So, it is tough-decision time, Kepner.<eos> Congratulations.<eos> - On?
And she's about to start phase two of her program.<eos> Phase two?<eos> A resident gets to be the primary surgeon on their own case.<eos> One procedure, pre-op to post-op, start to finish.<eos> Under supervision, right?
So this should be fun.<eos> And, no, no, you won't talk to him.<eos> I have enough problems being your First Lady.<eos> Just stay out of it.<eos> My First what?
What's your name again?<eos> Hemostasis was established, and the patient was sent to post-op without complications.<eos> Dr. Webber?<eos> May I, uh... May I run something by you?<eos> By me?
Good to have you back.<eos> - Morning.<eos> Thank you.<eos> So, when I was Chief...<eos> Interim Chief.
So when are you two getting married?<eos> Mom, no! Why?<eos> There's no Supreme Court excuse anymore.<eos> Have you talked to your uncle?<eos> Who, Jax? Mm. No.
Fuck!<eos> This makes the operation seem profitable and legitimate even though no actual profit is being made.<eos> You've been working out.<eos> Yeah.<eos> With someone not me.
Do you regret not having children?<eos> Sometimes.<eos> Not often.<eos> When are the sometimes?<eos> With my husband.
- Say no, Maia.<eos> If your dad calls to talk to you, tell him you can't meet.<eos> Yeah, ready?<eos> Hold on.<eos> Whoa, whoa.
- Okay.<eos> And your parents spoke with him?<eos> Yes.<eos> Jax was there, too. Um, my Uncle Jax, he was there and-and spoke to him.<eos> To Hannigan?
Well, this is a surprise.<eos> What brings you here, Captain?<eos> It's about David, actually.<eos> I'm worried that he still sees me as... what I used to be.<eos> A pirate.
Well, mm.<eos> Lucifer, who is this?<eos> Right.<eos> Meet Candy Morningstar.<eos> My wife.
Yeah, very.<eos> I'll track him down. Nice.<eos> Well done, Candy.<eos> Well, I don't get a lot of names at my job, so I'm super good with faces.<eos> And other things.
I was fired once.<eos> But you know what I did?<eos> I just kept showing up and made myself expandable.<eos> Oh, uh, do you mean indispensable?<eos> No. Expandable.
The bassist? Why were they fighting?<eos> When weren't they fighting?<eos> I thought that Ash was gonna kick Marla out of the band that night after the gig, so I went down there to see how it went down.<eos> That's when I saw the police standing there, across the street.<eos> Over his dead body.
But then, you probably already know that, huh?<eos> 'Cause you're kind of the reason why?<eos> What?<eos> Didn't you two just go through a super bananas situation?<eos> With like, poison?
I am now, am I?<eos> - On what charge?<eos> - Ladies, he's resisting arrest.<eos> Cuff him.<eos> My pleasure.
Like, I'm sorry that my bake sale cupcakes weren't gluten and dairy free, Debbie.<eos> Joy, where were you two nights ago?<eos> Tuesday?<eos> Um, I was, I was with Mr. Taylor.<eos> Mr. Taylor?
Because you spoke to him without permission, I had to apply for a special hearing just to interview him.<eos> That'll take at least a few days, so thank you for that.<eos> Hello, there.<eos> I'd like a suite for the evening, please.<eos> Preferably one with a view.
But, um, but, seriously, um, I just... I try and see beneath the DSM.<eos> Try to remember that each one of them is a person.<eos> Yeah. I, I saw this older gentleman the other day.<eos> Long white hair.<eos> White beard.
This time, we make it together.<eos> Lucifer!<eos> Detective!<eos> Seriously?<eos> Okay, outside now.
I'll put Officer Reagan on it, since he got us into this mess.<eos> Redding, John and Carla.<eos> Nah, they're gone.<eos> When?<eos> This morning.
I got to tell you, there sure is a lot you don't know about your son.<eos> Adopted son.<eos> I... I'm not very involved that way.<eos> - And what way is that?<eos> - As his father.
Yes, the trade was clear.<eos> Funds will be wired to the Panama account.<eos> Agent Ressler, I think I have something, a way Charnquist may be planning to access the building.<eos> Surveillance imagery shows an engine room on the roof, - and it is connected to a--<eos> - An elevator.
- Are you kidding me?<eos> I kills for the pils.<eos> I'm a total pils-nerd.<eos> - What's your poison...<eos> - German or Bohemian?
I guess it's better than the way I did grief.<eos> Which time?<eos> The time with the oxy binges.<eos> I go a little dark and twisty, but then I come back.<eos> "A little dark and twisty"?
Anyway, so, I wasn't sure if Maggie was okay, but I think she's fine, and if she's fine, then it's okay for me to go to dinner.<eos> If Maggie's fine, you get to eat?<eos> - Dinner with Riggs. - Ohh.<eos> You know, I was holding off because I didn't know if she'd be okay, but I think she's fine, so I think it's fine if I go to dinner.<eos> Mm. With Riggs.
Well, it took me years.<eos> Yeah, and it'll take me years, but I have to cut the cord in order to do it.<eos> And I can't keep running every decision past gnarled Old Man Wisdom!<eos> Oh, that's how you think of me, huh?<eos> Gnarled?
I'm gonna stop you before you say something you shouldn't.<eos> This my family we're talking about.<eos> No!<eos> In surgery, we call it<eos> - "a complication."
- East, South.<eos> - Possibly in the South Wing?<eos> Four or five floors up.<eos> - That's right near the NICU.<eos> - And the CCU.
Please talk to me.<eos> It's okay to be scared about what happened.<eos> I'm scared, too.<eos> Scared?<eos> About which thing?
I write about owls, remember?<eos> You know who I was before I met you.<eos> Do I?<eos> I was dating guys in your brother's crowd.<eos> The bad guys.
By that time, I didn't even want the pudding.<eos> Let's ask Eddie.<eos> Ramon's mother-in-law just moved in with him.<eos> You got yours in your house, right?<eos> And my mom.
My dad saw the future...<eos> Ah, the future is brains.<eos> He told me that much.<eos> Did he share with you how much money he thought we could make if we only aimed bigger?<eos> Much bigger?
They engage.<eos> They pretend to care.<eos> Let's try it.<eos> Hey, partner, what did you do this weekend?<eos> Nothing.
Single bullet, close range.<eos> Small caliber...<eos> I'm guessing .38.<eos> So, what's with the fancy high-tech...<eos> Wireless headphones?
Hello.<eos> LAPD.<eos> We're here to speak to an "Owlsy..."<eos> Why are you having so much trouble with that?<eos> "Owsy."
LAPD.<eos> We're here to speak to an "Owlsy..."<eos> Why are you having so much trouble with that?<eos> "Owsy."<eos> Owlsly.
We're here to speak to an "Owlsy..."<eos> Why are you having so much trouble with that?<eos> "Owsy."<eos> Owlsly.<eos> Owlsly.
- So long as it doesn't involve punching me in the jaw again.<eos> I'm sorry about that.<eos> After five years, I found myself blaming you for the choice I made.<eos> Turns out that abandoning my wife and son, even to save the world, was...<eos> A mistake.
That's a big area.<eos> I know, but if anyone, and I mean anyone, knows where to start looking, it's this guy.<eos> "The Burden of the Purest Heart:<eos> Sir Gawain's Secret Treasure," written by...<eos> - John Ronald Reuel Tolkien.
Come with me.<eos> The spear can help us fix your messed up future and my past.<eos> Never.<eos> If you think we're gonna let you walk out of here<eos> - with the spear...
I know this may sound crazy, but doesn't it seem like there's something wrong with this world?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Rory sold out the boss.<eos> To throw in with you losers.<eos> Losers?
I just need to make a few adjustments to the core.<eos> Did you already turn it on?<eos> I-I had specific instructions from Mr. Thawne to do so.<eos> Grey, we need to talk.<eos> Grey?
Hand it over.<eos> Like a good boy.<eos> You mean a good dog.<eos> That's all I am to you.<eos> An attack dog.
The exodus of northern agricultural populations, drying out of Euphrates by Turkey. = The continuous tamping of the soil. The movement of troops.<eos> Giant sandstorms.<eos> We will use the next to make an operation.<eos> Do you know where Guillaume is?<eos> With a favorable percentage.
With a favorable percentage.<eos> It is risky, but it is now or never.<eos> It is here, in an area where the Islamic State loses ground.<eos> Is it a joint operation with the Americans?<eos> No, with the Kurds.
- Léa.<eos> Read.<eos> Will we marry them?<eos> What do you want to be when you grow up?<eos> School teacher.
Then it is not a simple hostage.<eos> No hostage is simple.<eos> Get Paul Lefebvre alive and we'll get you out.<eos> Immediately afterwards?<eos> Immediately afterwards.
I'm not used to it.<eos> - To manipulate people?<eos> - That's.<eos> And is not that funny?<eos> Not with the girl.
And my agent could not follow you until the end.<eos> You went to a clinic.<eos> Did you have an appointment?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - With whom?
You went to a clinic.<eos> Did you have an appointment?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - With whom?<eos> With the doctor.
Why do not you tell your bosses? They will know to advise you.<eos> You can not have me here closed.<eos> Okay.<eos> I would like to speak with the secretary of the cultural attache, please.<eos> Mr. Uri Rosenberg, please.
Follow online.<eos> You have to leave - right now and far away.<eos> If the Mossad discovers an agent of the DGSI will cancel the operation.<eos> And what will we have achieved?<eos> A computer program.
- Dark, because of the mask?<eos> Possibly.<eos> How tall was he?<eos> My height?<eos> Geordie's height?
Possibly.<eos> How tall was he?<eos> My height?<eos> Geordie's height?<eos> - Geordie's height.
Geordie's height?<eos> - Geordie's height.<eos> - Your height.<eos> Or somewhere... there... abouts.<eos> Nine millimetre.
We all thought it was writing impenetrable sermons.<eos> How was Guy?<eos> I saw that he was here.<eos> Do you know, he was... fine.<eos> Pleasant, even.
Seven pounds and six shillings.<eos> It's hardly enough to buy half a pipe but it's a start.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> I was thinking of joining you for a drink.<eos> With Hilary.
'Cause your nails are hitting bone.<eos> It's just, your friends are such a tight knit bunch.<eos> They joke around with each other, and I feel like the new girl who doesn't know who to sit with in the cafeteria.<eos> Well, you're in luck, because you get to sit next to the big man on campus.<eos> Me.
That's a very good question.<eos> I guess the tech gods were just speaking through me.<eos> Somehow, I knew to take the best parts of a service as substandard and crappy as HooliChat and make it...<eos> How do I put this?<eos> Incredible.
Mr. Chugtai. It appears that 33 percent of your users are under the age of 13.<eos> It's also apparent that you have no parental permission requirements in place.<eos> You're going to want to sit down for this.<eos> - Are you familiar with COPPA?<eos> - Who?
Is this how you wanna end up?<eos> No.<eos> He's a cautionary tale.<eos> Nope, not true.<eos> Not a cautionary tale.
The liquor's gotten to the little fellow, and I wouldn't listen to a word he has to say.<eos> Oh, hey, Gilfoyle. This is Mia.<eos> Are you gonna murder Dinesh?<eos> - No.<eos> - Bummer.
I'm sorry.<eos> But I know how it feels.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> I need your help, Owen.<eos> With what?
Yes, well, if you will go thinking for yourself...<eos> What do you want?<eos> I was given strict instructions to keep you at the university.<eos> - Who by?<eos> - You.
They're your replacements.<eos> The end point of capitalism.<eos> A bottom line where human life has no value at all.<eos> We're fighting an algorithm.<eos> A spreadsheet.
Iron age churches.<eos> What do you always find near churches?<eos> Women in hats.<eos> Exactly.<eos> Human settlement.
You're not answering your phone.<eos> If you must know, I dropped it in a public pool while I was making track one.<eos> Like my heart, it's over there in a plastic bag full of rice, drying out.<eos> Titus, I know you don't believe me, but Jeff and me are not doing anything bad.<eos> Who?
Like fine wines! Jesus Christ!<eos> I can't wait to get back to Chiswick.<eos> Yeah, because London piss is like sparkling water, you just drink it straight back down again. Pretty much, yeah.<eos> Well, I'm just telling you, mints in northern restaurants, they're all drenched in piss.<eos> And faecal matter.
- I spoke to him.<eos> - Your father?<eos> - Dad?<eos> - So you're telling me that, in 20 years, I'm gonna be on the job<eos> - with my daughter?
You see the potential in everyone.<eos> You told me I could be an astronaut if I studied hard enough.<eos> Me, too! We don't all want to be astronauts, Liv.<eos> The point is, you could be.<eos> Or firemen.
I thought it was going good.<eos> It was weird, I really opened up to her.<eos> But when I took her home, she just bolted for the door.<eos> I think she may be a racist.<eos> Or worse, frigid.
Not really his style.<eos> Is that all you've got?<eos> A button?<eos> I spoke to Judith Miles.<eos> Who?
Bunty, no!<eos> Police!<eos> Stay down, Father!<eos> It's me he's after.<eos> Not you.
You have released her, now you know it was John's gun?<eos> Whose gun?<eos> You are aware that withholding evidence is a criminal offence?<eos> Yes. Which is precisely why I came to alert you... after I had ministered to Grace Kemp.<eos> The atheist.
Well, I'm not going anywhere until I know that you're being properly looked after.<eos> And where is that daughter of yours?<eos> I'm not sure.<eos> Well, when did you last see her?<eos> Last night.
Inspector, may I be the one to inform Mr Bayley's daughter?<eos> I am a friend of the family.<eos> Be my guest, so long as you take this nosy parker with you!<eos> Yes.<eos> With pleasure.
Fortunately, I wouldn't have embarked on this endeavour if I didn't have a backup plan, but I'll need your help.<eos> To escape?<eos> I need something to unlock a pair of handcuffs.<eos> A key would be ideal...<eos> Or a lock pick?
Then I'll be on my way.<eos> Oh, right.<eos> Come on, Pal.<eos> Not now.<eos> Not before tonight.
Oh. You... haven't heard about his little... trip away.<eos> No.<eos> It was... a spontaneous decision.<eos> I think he just fancied a little sea air.<eos> - Sea air? - Mm-hm.
My darling Ronnie's been robbed and murdered and all you can do is beat each other to a pulp.<eos> Shame on you.<eos> Operator.<eos> Which service do you require?<eos> Police.
Born to the wrong mother.<eos> How dare you judge me, lady?<eos> This is how he chose to live.<eos> Get out.<eos> Gladly.
He had a scarf.<eos> What colour was the scarf?<eos> - Green.<eos> - Green?<eos> And white.
What colour was the scarf?<eos> - Green.<eos> - Green?<eos> And white.<eos> - And a bit red.
It's not about the sex.<eos> It's confusing when you get close to someone like that.<eos> I don't think you'd ever tell him straight out, but you might end up saying something or acting in a way that would draw suspicion, and we can't risk that, Paige.<eos> So I just can't ever have a boyfriend ever?<eos> Just not Matthew.
That was smart, him throwing the gutter balls to make Pasha feel better.<eos> He's got great instincts.<eos> Did Paige say anything about Matthew?<eos> She can't handle this.<eos> Any of it.
Love 'em to death, but I'm always happy to leave.<eos> But you must do something besides see them.<eos> I like my work.<eos> What do you do?<eos> Logistics...
I got my license when I was 16, joined the Air Force when I was 18.<eos> - In war?<eos> - Vietnam.<eos> Really?<eos> Yeah, not fighters...
We're, um, developing some new sources, and unfortunately, it takes some travel to get to them.<eos> You go separately, though.<eos> Sometimes we need to get to know different people.<eos> So, who are you getting to know?<eos> Um... a scientist...
I'm gonna head upstairs.<eos> That guy in the lab...<eos> That can't happen ever again.<eos> We'll be more careful.<eos> More careful?
Was he a logger?<eos> He worked at a logging camp.<eos> Was he a logger?<eos> He was a guard.<eos> - A guard?
Later, Seegs.<eos> Guy's a dummy.<eos> Seegs! Seegs, Seegs, Seegs, Seegs!<eos> A true right-hand man never makes love on another man's desk.<eos> Or horse.
Guy's a dummy.<eos> Seegs! Seegs, Seegs, Seegs, Seegs!<eos> A true right-hand man never makes love on another man's desk.<eos> Or horse.<eos> Or with another man's woman.
Seegs! Seegs, Seegs, Seegs, Seegs!<eos> A true right-hand man never makes love on another man's desk.<eos> Or horse.<eos> Or with another man's woman.<eos> Or horse.
Let's worry about that when we have to worry about it.<eos> - There he is.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> You want to get it now or come back at night?<eos> Night.
So, how are things going at work?<eos> Fine.<eos> Usual.<eos> You get along with your coworkers?<eos> Most of them.
You're friends?<eos> No.<eos> Has Volodya introduced you to people?<eos> A few.<eos> Men.
Why?<eos> Who were you meeting?<eos> Was that your team on me?<eos> Who were you meeting?<eos> No one!
Stolen.<eos> From us.<eos> Our agronomists are gonna be working on it for some time.<eos> Some time?<eos> Years.
I'm from Dyatkovo.<eos> You're from Sevsk.<eos> When the Nazi overran Dyatkovo we were rounded up and taken to the square in the center of town.<eos> My father was shot, along with many other men.<eos> And boys.
He's been through chemo and radiation, both of which were ineffective.<eos> Life expectancy three to four months, but he would like to check out before... and these are his words...<eos> "Shit gets real," which, of course, it will.<eos> I gave them both your number.<eos> Behind every great doctor...
We're good at that.<eos> You know, I've been thinking.<eos> I really need to quit.<eos> Killing people?<eos> No, smoking.
That's ridiculous.<eos> There's no such thing.<eos> Fucking what?<eos> Richard, a bill of this size is going to be problematic.<eos> Problematic?
Yeah, I did.<eos> So what?<eos> Well, he wasn't my friend.<eos> He was my partner.<eos> My lover.
Right.<eos> Well, that's great, isn't it?<eos> Just what you wanted.<eos> I wasn't like this before I met you.<eos> Like what?
Yeah, Nightingale.<eos> I, uh... I had some time.<eos> - I thought I'd learn from the best.<eos> - Well, we were good, weren't we?<eos> Me and your Pops.
This red truck.<eos> It's registered to a Doris Perkins.<eos> Does that ring any bells from the Nightingale days?<eos> Uh, there was a blue pickup truck.<eos> With a camper shell.
A massage parlor.<eos> And you think he made Preeda the same offer?<eos> I know he did.<eos> Preeda was sweet.<eos> A little naive.
She needs to see another face.<eos> Yeah, but you're basically asking me to, like, drop a bomb in the middle of a Norman Rockwell painting.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Just get it over with.<eos> OK.
- Right over there?<eos> Oh no, maybe with the side dishes.<eos> I'm sorry, I know it's heavy.<eos> Does that seem good?<eos> Side dishes?
As soon as my wife divorces me, I'm going back to undercover.<eos> All right, come on.<eos> Wendy is great.<eos> Yeah, Wendy's standing between me and my damn dreams.<eos> Your dreams?
Said it made her feel safer at night.<eos> She's close.<eos> How can you tell?<eos> I was a doctor, too, charlie.<eos> Well, plastic surgeon.
Room 141.<eos> Chris daniels, call 156.<eos> Chris daniels, 156.<eos> Room 141.<eos> Just before the chairs on your right.
Gourmet.<eos> You a football fan?<eos> And I don't mean that English "Footy" bullshit.<eos> I mean pigskin, cheerleader, pompon football.<eos> Troy Dixon football.
Nah.<eos> Not that deep.<eos> You lost your job, and you found out what Mary was doing, and you saw an opportunity.<eos> I mean, that's all these people are to you.<eos> A steady stream of income.
I'm trying to get high.<eos> Is this about my conversation with Mary?<eos> You talked to Mary?<eos> I did.<eos> This morning.
If we're gonna be partners, we need to share the risk.<eos> Same deal I had with Des.<eos> So you need to know how to do this.<eos> I know how to do it.<eos> Properly.
"To Flora and Michael,<eos> "in the hope the enclosed might one day hang in your drawing room.<eos> "Thomas."<eos> Who did you go with?<eos> A friend.
All this depressing junk!<eos> - Oh, that's nice. - You see?<eos> I'd really, really like to do a job like this, Adam.<eos> It's like working on a site with my brothers when I was growing up.<eos> The whole hands-on...
She's tough as granite.<eos> And you're afraid to bowl.<eos> - Fine.<eos> - How long before the dragon eats you and Quentin?<eos> - Tomorrow morning.
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, over the past several weeks, you have witnessed the prosecution launch a relentless, scathing, oftentimes personal attack against my client.<eos> And all she could come up with was baseless, worthless speculation.<eos> But speculation isn't good enough!<eos> You need facts, and the fact is that there is nothing linking my client to the death...<eos> To the death...
- Yeah.<eos> Um... hey, random question. Um, what's up with the jar?<eos> Mm, it's, um, just a gift that a friend gave me.<eos> Isn't it a little racist?<eos> Racist?
Of course.<eos> What are you looking for?<eos> Well, say you have a-- a being with an enormous amount of power.<eos> I'm looking for how someone might... you know, defeat them.<eos> How much power?
It could destroy worlds.<eos> The Tesla Flexion has only been successfully employed once before.<eos> Luckily, we're using the original equipment, left to Brakebills by the man who invented it.<eos> Nikola Tesla?<eos> No, Fred Flexion.
"To my Queen... my life,<eos> my love, pity me.<eos> Forgive me.<eos> I was tempted<eos> by the sins
And we actually leave on Sunday, so...<eos> I guess next time, right?<eos> Right.<eos> Good night.<eos> Good night.
Just don't think about the guy in the black hood that came in the back door.<eos> - Wh... - Or the bear that came in with him.<eos> I'll be right back.<eos> You come over to congratulate me?<eos> Why?
My dear!<eos> Welcome to Paradise!<eos> Go Go go!<eos> Yet again, we have set the benchmark for social intercourse.<eos> And with such aplomb!
Are you, Boneless?<eos> So, who is going to stay and farm?<eos> I would like to stay.<eos> But I have other plans.<eos> Skol.
So, who is going to stay and farm?<eos> I would like to stay.<eos> But I have other plans.<eos> Skol.<eos> Skol!
You drove a good bargain and we now have a foothold in India.<eos> All for the sake of France.<eos> How was the war?<eos> Exhilarating?<eos> Educational.
You have beauty, wit, intelligence, yet none of these have proved strong enough to retain the King's love.<eos> Only one course remains open to you.<eos> What do I have to do?<eos> There's someone you should meet.<eos> Who?
How would you characterize your marriage?<eos> My late husband was very busy with his work.<eos> He wasn't one for physical prowess.<eos> Although, occasionally, my husband seemed to find me irresistible, after I bathed in aromatic oils.<eos> Aromatic oils?
So I'll take your new one.<eos> I should reply.<eos> "I am well and will see you soon."<eos> You're more of a Dick.<eos> "Undercover.
There's a little blood.<eos> A whole lot of dirt and bird crap.<eos> That gonna be a problem for you, Scorsese?<eos> DNA is easy.<eos> - Writing, on the other hand...
This was a potential issue, so I got out ahead of it and I managed the situation for you.<eos> You "managed the situation."<eos> That's right.<eos> So my mother thought I was incapable of finding a mate, and my mate thinks I'm incapable of running my own life.<eos> Not your whole life!
Sh...<eos> Ooh.<eos> Ah.<eos> You want to decorate it tonight?<eos> Yeah, with gasoline and a match?
Maybe I don't want to win this bet.<eos> Okay, we need to figure out whether this crash was an accident or part of a deliberate escape plan.<eos> Gina, I need you manning the tip line. Ha-ha!<eos> Good luck talking to the crazies.<eos> Crazies?
What did he tell you?<eos> Well, let's find out, okay?<eos> Together.<eos> Rob, do you want to share your experience with the group?<eos> Gladly.
Is that the one who's dead?<eos> They're weird over there.<eos> The house is always dark after nine o'clock.<eos> You hear him sometimes shooting his guns in his garden.<eos> Not last night.
A dozen men have gone in this garage in the past ten minutes.<eos> What's going on?<eos> Jojo?<eos> Wahey!<eos> Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Check it out, my hot tub is filled with coffee.<eos> Grab a donut, go to town!<eos> Sponsored by Dunkin' Donuts.<eos> And the pool is filled with my favorite food:<eos> soup with little shapes in it.
Just texted.<eos> Crime stuff, she's gonna be late.<eos> - All right.<eos> - Drinks.<eos> Drinks.
Hey, buddy.<eos> Yo, dude, look, it's...<eos> Zombies are abominations.<eos> That's what we are.<eos> Abominations!
Hey. I can take you out on the floor if you want to see how we apply the powdered sugar.<eos> Oh. Appreciate the offer, but we really need to find that window.<eos> Oh, sure, yeah.<eos> I-It's this way. You know, I can tell, the two of you are living the dream, being cops.<eos> Federal agents.
- Did you cheat on her?<eos> - No! I would never do that.<eos> - Did you date one of her friends - right after you broke up? - Uh-uh.<eos> I cut off ties with all our mutual friends.<eos> Even Tommy.
Uh, I'm looking for a friend.<eos> She's gone missing.<eos> That's awful.<eos> When did she go missing?<eos> Last night.
I was laid up for six weeks.<eos> If I was human, I would have died.<eos> Right now, you'd be talking to...<eos> Come to think of it, who were you talking to?<eos> Um... My...
If I was human, I would have died.<eos> Right now, you'd be talking to...<eos> Come to think of it, who were you talking to?<eos> Um... My...<eos> Um... my mum.
It's actually better if you keep breathing, if your brain just keeps transmitting... well, nothing.<eos> That would blot out the residue false memories.<eos> What would be left of me?<eos> You'd be a husk.<eos> Completely and irrevocably brain-dead.
Yeah. Ryan was driving.<eos> How'd you get the car?<eos> Well, me and Ryan, we were all geared up waiting in our work car.<eos> We get a call from this valet we had in our back pocket, says he tagged a classic Mustang, so we track it from Tap on Rush, and we get behind this dude...<eos> Him?
I have his records.<eos> You have my records?<eos> You're not the only Ray in this family, Ray.<eos> It's color-coded?<eos> And the labels?
And our genuine hope is that Seattle will be a city filled with happy zombies.<eos> Going to PTA meetings, bringing orange slices to kids' soccer matches, making noise at Seahawks games.<eos> Of course, the human citizens of Seattle are free to leave.<eos> But we hope that you will stay and live in harmony<eos> - with your new zombie neighbors.
Assume nothing.<eos> Assumption makes an "ass" out of you, and "umption".<eos> Cardinal, one of your translators is missing.<eos> Doctor, those translators were devout.<eos> Believers.
Without hope.<eos> Without witness.<eos> Without reward.<eos> Who was your date, then?<eos> Um, Penny.
I'm the Doctor... and I beg leave to intercede.<eos> - You know my race?<eos> - I do.<eos> And I ask mercy for these primitives.<eos> "Primitives"? ! - Shhhh!
You and your Alice?<eos> Not yet.<eos> I want to have enough put by to make us comfy.<eos> And then we'll get married in that little church with the twisted spire back home.<eos> Down by the river.
We picked up your distress call and here we are to help, like awesome heroes!<eos> Yeah, we're not... we're not assistants.<eos> Ok, right, so what does he call you?<eos> Companions?<eos> Pets?
Yeah, we're not... we're not assistants.<eos> Ok, right, so what does he call you?<eos> Companions?<eos> Pets?<eos> Snacks?
We pick a good one.<eos> Our usual Saturday.<eos> And what if she just walks out and slaughters everyone just for a laugh?<eos> Well, I will be monitoring you the whole time.<eos> Me?
Our usual Saturday.<eos> And what if she just walks out and slaughters everyone just for a laugh?<eos> Well, I will be monitoring you the whole time.<eos> Me?<eos> Yes, you and Nardole.
Shuttle craft.<eos> Get junior up there.<eos> Ooh, you hit me really hard.<eos> You're telling me... I think I've still got the bump!<eos> Right. First things first...
I was down there for ten years.<eos> And then, one day... they took you to the conversion theatre.<eos> - Do you remember that?<eos> - No.<eos> Bits of it...
Yes. Also true.<eos> - For what?<eos> - Hallucinations of his dead wife.<eos> You can see how this might not be my first choice for how to spend a day off.<eos> Well, not with that attitude.
You think, Peyton will let you borrow that getup?<eos> You're dead.<eos> Who's dead?<eos> Who are you talking to?<eos> Drake.
You're dead.<eos> Who's dead?<eos> Who are you talking to?<eos> Drake.<eos> Drake?
Who's dead?<eos> Who are you talking to?<eos> Drake.<eos> Drake?<eos> Old boyfriend, Drake?
Just get here.<eos> Look I know your situation may look dire here, Stacey, but you have options.<eos> Sure, and one of those options involves you being buried alive in this overpriced box...<eos> But the other leaves you alive, and provides you with what I'm proud to say is a...<eos> Truly remarkable business opportunity.
- Where are you?<eos> - Loria.<eos> Some canyon with these purple-ish rock things.<eos> - Rock things? What...<eos> - Dicks, okay?
Yes, my... my private detective was investigating Nadine's girlfriends and boyfriends.<eos> After we separated, she was searching for something.<eos> Love, I guess.<eos> So she started dating men?<eos> More like boys.

To buy some horses so we can follow them.<eos> What, just, south? Through hostile Native American land?<eos> That's not exactly Google Maps, is it?<eos> - Well, we've survived worse.<eos> - Barely.
No.<eos> The L.A. Sheriff's Boy's Home.<eos> Assault weapons for a charity?<eos> Right, except for it wasn't an official department charity, it was a personal charity, founded by your boy.<eos> Luke Barton.
- Your fault!<eos> It was you driving, you fool!<eos> It stinks down here.<eos> God! What is this stuff?<eos> England.
'.. begins an affair with a parish priest.'<eos> What's going on?<eos> She was obsessive.<eos> She was losing her mind.<eos> Obsessive, yes.
Great, so I'm shagging the Singing Detective.<eos> So, have you made your choice?<eos> No... Can't decide between The Birdie Song and Wind Beneath My Wings.<eos> You know what I mean!<eos> Between me and Fran!
You know, I was in Homebase only this morning.<eos> Yes?<eos> No. I... I was in for a paint match.<eos> I just can't make up my mind between Elephant's Breath and Clown's Pocket.<eos> Clown's Pocket? !
Not to me.<eos> Not for me, either.<eos> Mario Hunt should rot in the prison.<eos> You can't negotiate with gangbangers.<eos> Just like terrorists.
- Er, er, Chief, I think you should know this.<eos> On the night he was killed, Charlie Taylor had booked to fly back to the Sudan.<eos> There was an e-ticket in his inbox.<eos> He was planning to leave?<eos> When? First thing this morning.
Why did you start working here after all this time?<eos> Let's say life hasn't been too kind these past few years.<eos> I heard Charlie was back at the hotel.<eos> - I came to him for help.<eos> - For money?
They were shoved to the bottom of his waste-paper bin.<eos> Thank you, JP.<eos> Three separate copies.<eos> All signed and dated by Charlie Taylor.<eos> And yourself.

- I carry it with me wherever I go.<eos> Okay, shut up real quick because I have an idea.<eos> What if Blake blows his brains out just because he didn't do what he loves?<eos> - Well... - Because we made fun of him<eos> - so much.
Yeah, I mean, same here.<eos> I mean, I've had anal.<eos> - What? - I've done...<eos> I've done anal<eos> - to someone.
- That's cool, though.<eos> You know, family time for busy musicians.<eos> They need it, too, you know?<eos> And I've been emailing their manager Mailer Daemon.<eos> - Mailer-daemon?
But my younger sister, I don't know.<eos> Where they've taken her.<eos> I am yitzhak lieberman, 33, Cook from tylice.<eos> I live there with my wife, laila,<eos> And our daughter, maya.
Okay, it's gonna be that kind of day.<eos> Okay, so who is he?<eos> Dale Reynolds, 35.<eos> Had quite a party followed by an accidental overdose.<eos> Or not so accidental.
Hey, if you wake up in a couple hours, and you think about driving home, do me a favor, don't.<eos> Okay?<eos> I cheated on my wife.<eos> What?<eos> Last night.
Friday was a year and a day.<eos> That's why I picked the date.<eos> Anna and I knew this first one was gonna be difficult.<eos> But we wanted to mark it, to remember Miranda.<eos> With family.
That's why I picked the date.<eos> Anna and I knew this first one was gonna be difficult.<eos> But we wanted to mark it, to remember Miranda.<eos> With family.<eos> With friends.
Who's Alistair?<eos> Alistair Liddell.<eos> He worked here.<eos> He was a friend.<eos> A good friend.
Like he was defending himself?<eos> Reasonable to presume.<eos> I would have, wouldn't you?<eos> And could those have been made with, like, a kitchen knife?<eos> Eight-inch blade?
He will betray you...<eos> Maybe today, maybe next week.<eos> But if you want to stay here, you need to do it first.<eos> So, what, are we supposed to just rush in, get everyone out... hostage, terrorists alike...<eos> Before the strike?
How'd you know I'd be here?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I guess I'm starting to get you.<eos> Oh, not many people do.<eos> And now, one less.
I may have something.<eos> A coded rebel message was beamed from this ship right after an off-ship prisoner was transferred to your detention block, B-7.<eos> Well, then... Shall we visit this mysterious prisoner?<eos> No, we should get the codes before we release Bridger.<eos> This way.
It's gonna be cold.<eos> - Ron!<eos> - Van?<eos> I thought you were on vacation with your girlfriend<eos> - and her son?
- Good.<eos> We will need her.<eos> I sacrificed everything for Neolution.<eos> People I loved.<eos> Perhaps even my own soul.
I think a little more than just briefed.<eos> Do you have an extra pair of socks, Raymond?<eos> After 30 years of military service, you'd think I'd arrive prepared.<eos> Oh, I'm sure someone around here could find you a pair.<eos> - Under my bunk.
-Yeah, loud and clear.<eos> I'm a little confused that you don't seem to hear me at all.<eos> Once we're solidly back in power, -we will regain our position--<eos> -That is naive. Naive is new for you.<eos> Realistic.
I'm a little confused that you don't seem to hear me at all.<eos> Once we're solidly back in power, -we will regain our position--<eos> -That is naive. Naive is new for you.<eos> Realistic.<eos> Not naive.
-I have to take this.<eos> I'm sorry. -What happens after he gets there?<eos> -To Will? What happens?<eos> -We'll be there for him.<eos> -You and General Brockhart?
Stay out of this.<eos> You and your stupid machine started this fight!<eos> You are lucky that this feelings machine doesn't have feelings.<eos> Come on, Sheldon, let's go.<eos> Gladly.
So... interesting times.<eos> How's Benjamin?<eos> He's good.<eos> We made love this morning.<eos> With all the bells and whistles.
Sphinx!<eos> Mobile surveillance system initiated.<eos> Mobile what?<eos> Use the control surface to pilot your Breathe Systems drone.<eos> Drone?
Mobile what?<eos> Use the control surface to pilot your Breathe Systems drone.<eos> Drone?<eos> No, no, no, no, no.<eos> Drone?
Don't think I've ever seen you happier.<eos> With the little miss here...<eos> I suppose we all are.<eos> But how long do you think it can last?<eos> With your job, and her down the road?
I'm, uh...<eos> I...<eos> I was a teacher.<eos> - Hmm.<eos> - Um, a good one.
- I don't think so, or no?<eos> No.<eos> Approximately how many people did you interact with in 1927?<eos> I would say about 15...<eos> To 17.
We were part of a Navy SEAL team sent there to rescue a doctor who'd been kidnapped by some rebels there.<eos> And what happened on the operation?<eos> The mission went all wrong.<eos> Dr. Carter and two of our guys were killed.<eos> By the rebels?
Remember the phone call from prison?<eos> Weckler asked Tatum, "Are they keeping you well-fed?"<eos> Yeah.<eos> He wanted to make sure she was well-fed.<eos> In brains!
Now, where are we?<eos> Where are we?<eos> Have you got it yet?<eos> Hang on, it's Tom Lewis with his wife and his son?<eos> Not just his one son.
Of course you have beaten me to the gym.<eos> You live life right.<eos> It's amazing.<eos> - Workout your legs, Jeffrey.<eos> - Not your mouth.
The truth is, I've asked someone to meet me here.<eos> That's why I've ordered extra food.<eos> Who?<eos> Someone I want you to meet.<eos> Someone important.
This is my partner, Detective Baez.<eos> The shield means that, if we ask you questions, you can trust us, okay?<eos> You want to tell us what happened?<eos> You play sports, Malik?<eos> Baseball.
We did.<eos> Then it shouldn't be weird.<eos> It won't be.<eos> But I am surprised you're dating someone like him.<eos> "Someone like him"?
Oh, that's-<eos> - I-I don't-- I-I-<eos> - No. - No, please--<eos> - Well, what do you think you're doing?<eos> Nothing-
A jar with a human ding-dong in it, dude.<eos> So please stop being stupid and listen to us.<eos> Wait a second.<eos> How big was the ding-dong?<eos> Massive.
My help was to be in the strictest confidence.<eos> The night I was poisoned, I was with people.<eos> I don't know where they are.<eos> I keep calling. I can't reach them.<eos> Except you.
I'm just saying he definitely had a motive.<eos> When did I meet you?<eos> Are you serious?<eos> Humor me.<eos> Last night.
You said something before.<eos> The truth doesn't matter, that the only thing in this world that matters is just the appearance of truth.<eos> I fear you might be right about that.<eos> Lately I find that the truth has become... so elusive.<eos> Often imaginary.
How much of yourself do you see in your daughter?<eos> Oh! Are you going to charge me now?<eos> It's not rocket science.<eos> Your problems with your daughter can trace right back to your relationship<eos> - with your own mother.
Her contact there is Dr. Nimitz.<eos> They've never met.<eos> She's expected tomorrow.<eos> But she's showing up tonight.<eos> With her assistant.
GO!<eos> - Who was he?<eos> - A child.<eos> A beautiful child.<eos> A unique genome.
No.<eos> No, they don't.<eos> Yes.<eos> They do.<eos> Not your integrity.
Yes.<eos> They do.<eos> Not your integrity.<eos> My integrity.<eos> Not your intellect.
I'll fill you in, love, but leave the children with your mum.<eos> Uh, one more thing.<eos> Virginia Coady is on the island, and I've got a feeling that didn't end well for Susan.<eos> Where is she?<eos> Beyond the arbor.
The sentiment is mutual.<eos> I've reviewed your work as a geneticist.<eos> It's impressive.<eos> Glad to be back from the abyss, and looking forward to working with you and Kira.<eos> Helena, too, soon.
- And purple.<eos> Yes!<eos> I wanted something creative and free, you know?<eos> I met this Jungian who just... lives in that place.<eos> - A who?
Yes!<eos> I wanted something creative and free, you know?<eos> I met this Jungian who just... lives in that place.<eos> - A who?<eos> - A Jungian.
Should I untuck?<eos> Would that be cooler?<eos> Donnie is perfect.<eos> I need a straight man<eos> - behind the bar.
I mean, he's so protected, it's not even funny.<eos> If he is bribing governments for citizens' genetics, then we've got to...<eos> Leave it, love, will you?<eos> Why don't you help Adele<eos> - with the snacks.
Ezra!<eos> Wie ghet's?<eos> Felix.<eos> Gentlemen, I would like you to meet my sister,<eos> Hestia.
- Shit, did you get her drunk?<eos> Do you know who S's real source was,<eos> - the one who got us to Coady?<eos> - I'm not doing this right now<eos> - with you.
I understand there's a line, agent Ressler, and that you think he's crossed it, but I disagree.<eos> Reddington insists his courier's death was part of a larger threat.<eos> And we're going to investigate it.<eos> Everything okay?<eos> With the phone call?
We actually know very little.<eos> No identification.<eos> No cell phone.<eos> We understand he had over $30,000 in us bills on him.<eos> Counterfeit bills.
No identification.<eos> No cell phone.<eos> We understand he had over $30,000 in us bills on him.<eos> Counterfeit bills.<eos> Untraceable.
I have done that over the objections of both agents I respect and superiors I answer to.<eos> So before you start telling me what is it you want...<eos> Maybe we shouldn't have gone there, Raymond.<eos> You keep putting yourself in more and more danger every year.<eos> Every day.
And you had a knife at that time?<eos> Yeah.<eos> When I came in through the kitchen, there was a thing there.<eos> That holds knives.<eos> By the oven.
Yeah, my mother told me.<eos> You as broken up about it as she is?<eos> Hey, cut her some slack, all right?<eos> He was a real prick to everyone, but he really perfected his game when it came to her.<eos> What about you?
You as broken up about it as she is?<eos> Hey, cut her some slack, all right?<eos> He was a real prick to everyone, but he really perfected his game when it came to her.<eos> What about you?<eos> Me?
That you're insane?<eos> Please, somebody just do it.<eos> Seriously, why is it that no one at this table ever wants to say grace? Linda's turn.<eos> - Linda's turn.<eos> - Happily.
Just be careful.<eos> Always.<eos> Hello, olá, and Eoh, wasseo, gamers and gamerettes.<eos> It's O.G. Pwnzr coming to you live from New York City<eos> - with your daily dose of...
I'm gonna put out a Finest Message.<eos> Looks like we got a suspect.<eos> By all means, send your bulletin.<eos> We do need to speak to Tendu.<eos> But not as a suspect.
that's not what happened.<eos> Well, Anezka seems to think it's a quite likely sequence of events.<eos> All right, look, you are right about the girls, and you're right that Tendu found out.<eos> Only, he didn't threaten me, he came to me for help.<eos> With what?
Tendu said he was gonna pay you a hundred thou?<eos> He didn't say he would do it.<eos> He did it.<eos> Paid me on the spot.<eos> In cash?
He didn't say he would do it.<eos> He did it.<eos> Paid me on the spot.<eos> In cash?<eos> Brand new hundred dollar bills.
- What about the other Jax?<eos> Whoa, whoa, wait.<eos> There's a fake version of me, too?<eos> - Ray, whoever this bozo is, kick his ass!<eos> - With pleasure.
No!<eos> No.<eos> Jefferson, no, please.<eos> Please!<eos> Grey!
- Well...<eos> - Brett, what's going on?<eos> Okay, look.<eos> I am batting about a zero with men lately.<eos> Good men, bad men, all men.
Yes?<eos> What was that alderman's name from the breakfast thing we did last month?<eos> Uh, there were 30 aldermen.<eos> The tall one with the cute hair.<eos> Cute hair?
Ah.<eos> I wanted her to blow off some steam. I just didn't know she'd have so much of it.<eos> Oh, come on.<eos> She's fine.<eos> Cheers.
Why?<eos> Hey! Hey! Over here!<eos> - He's alive!<eos> - Medics, trauma victim.<eos> Delta side in the gangway.
All right, come on.<eos> We just finished unpacking last night.<eos> Why do you want to know about Dan?<eos> Have you spoken to him today?<eos> Not since this morning.
We'd been working with Kyle and his dad.<eos> They'd come so far.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Um, did you have any issue with the tenant next door?<eos> Dan?
No, this is a private show for you, before you have to go off on patrol...<eos> Nedley figures the streets are gonna be awash with booze and urine all weekend.<eos> So it's all hands on deck.<eos> You guys need to get some more hands, so that yours can stay right here.<eos> On me.
Right, but nothing else has... happened, right?<eos> Yet.<eos> - I forgot you were head cheerleader.<eos> - And Prom Queen.<eos> Prom.
Whereas I took the path too easy.<eos> I am living... and living, and living... proof that it is not always prudent<eos> - to strike deals with demons.<eos> - Doc, we have.<eos> In blood.
I need a favor.<eos> I was wondering if you could watch Robin for me.<eos> Yeah, yeah, of... of course.<eos> I'd be happy to.<eos> I,
It's not big enough.<eos> Emma's a Princess, and her wedding is a royal affair.<eos> You want to find someplace bigger, fine.<eos> Let's go find one.<eos> Happy to.
We both did.<eos> What are you doing here? We're here to help you.<eos> You're welcome.<eos> Help me with what? Your little fairy problem which you don't seem able to solve.<eos> The blue fairy.
Mm-hmm.<eos> Who shot at you, Jeremy?<eos> Who killed Rebecca?<eos> Getting out of the life, that doesn't make me a snitch.<eos> Yeah, what about a human being?
Store owner thought the kid was pulling a gun when the kid was going for his wallet, and he shot the kid dead.<eos> Claimed self-defense, and he walked, this morning.<eos> I came at you with a full head of steam.<eos> I want to apologize.<eos> Hey.
Fine, turn around.<eos> Are you going out?<eos> You going out with Chrissy?<eos> No, I'm not going out with her.<eos> With friends, then?
Ah. You've covered my better qualities.<eos> All right.<eos> But I've never seen you like this before.<eos> How's that?<eos> Afraid.
Yeah, actually, a lot.<eos> Um... did you guys hear about the helicopter crash on Webster Street?<eos> Yeah.<eos> That was you?<eos> First on scene.
Why the hell would I go anywhere with you?<eos> Because I've disabled the security systems, and the guards still work for me. They'll look the other way.<eos> - Trust me.<eos> - I'll take my chances.<eos> With what?
You think Sasha's trouble?<eos> Okay.<eos> I'll be careful.<eos> The rest is up to me.<eos> And with this veto,
Well, small talk's what parties like this are for.<eos> You know what jeopardizes missions?<eos> Personal vendettas.<eos> - I have no beef with you.<eos> - And Alex?
Told me to flag any connections to the cartel.<eos> When?<eos> When did he tell you that?<eos> Yesterday.<eos> Early evening.
I'm here, aren't I?<eos> Unfortunately, so are you.<eos> Look, you were right.<eos> Clay's struggling, but not with work.<eos> Only you.
Maybe also likes hanging out with the higher-ups of the Estebez Cartel.<eos> - That's their number two.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> All right, so maybe he's into running drugs or weapons.<eos> Or people.
I'm so proud of you.<eos> Dad, I'm trying to tell you off, and you're ruining it with your delight and relief.<eos> Uh-huh.<eos> Interesting.<eos> Okay.
Do you really?<eos> I wouldn't say it if I didn't.<eos> Good to know it's not just me.<eos> Yeah. We're both freaks.<eos> Christmas present.
- There.<eos> Eugene:<eos> Hook Hand went on a world tour?<eos> Does no one share anything with me?<eos> No feelings, no secrets, no news?
The thing is, Felix doesn't get drunk... ever.<eos> I think it was an excuse to hack into my private e-mails.<eos> I thought you said that this guy was like family to you.<eos> I think Roarke may have dispatched him to look into me after our coup in Cleveland...<eos> And not just me.
She's trying to get you on board.<eos> On board what?<eos> Never mind, ittybitty titty.<eos> Hey, did she happen to mention if and when Doc is gonna grace us<eos> - with his presence?
Stupid Earl.<eos> What are you doing here? !<eos> I don't know what's behind door number one, but I'm pretty sure it's not a SeaDoo.<eos> I'm not leaving you alone to face...<eos> Earl?
Do you really think Prince George out there is gonna call Charlotte at the Home Office, tell them all about your secret efforts here?<eos> Promise to cut them in if she reinstates me?<eos> No, of course not.<eos> So, once again, I scratch your back and I get kicked to the curb in return.<eos> Cheers.
How?<eos> Well, it seems he sourced every waitress, bartender, doorman, concierge or owner that's crossed my path the last six months of my life.<eos> To what end?<eos> To make it look like I run with a particular crowd.<eos> Particular how?
- Fractured.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Or multiplied.<eos> - Becoming...<eos> - Legion.
You finally met Wynonna Earp.<eos> She is infected.<eos> The final one under Mikshun's influence.<eos> The Heir could be an ally.<eos> Ally?
- You're new here.<eos> You can wait your turn.<eos> Now, why don't you guys go ahead?<eos> I'll take care of this.<eos> "This"?
I came to wish you luck!<eos> Thanks, but I don't need luck.<eos> I need to use this time to get inside the competition's head.<eos> You know, psyche 'em out with some trash talk.<eos> Trash talk?
I am up to nothing.<eos> Oh, okay.<eos> Well, what's Lance up to? Lance?<eos> Oh, Lance!<eos> Nothing.
Yeah, the corvo blades.<eos> Well, she could have picked up a bow off the battlefield.<eos> What is it?<eos> Echo's gone.<eos> Bellamy.
- Hey.<eos> - That looks like the strut of a lady who just crushed an exam.<eos> - I sure did, and finished 45 minutes early.<eos> - Oh, nice, did everyone else give you dirty looks?<eos> - So dirty.
- No need.<eos> You can tell Laverne the whole story over brunch.<eos> - All right, sir, I'm sorry that I got in the middle of your family business, but I'm afraid I have to get in the middle of it again.<eos> Look, I don't talk about this a lot, but I actually have had a difficult relationship with one of my parents.<eos> - Yes, your father.
- You've been great.<eos> - Wrong, I've been a disaster.<eos> - I can't believe you would blame yourself for this.<eos> - How stupid are you?<eos> - So stupid.
The baby daddy is a Boyle cousin.<eos> It's a Boyle!<eos> Whoo! Ugh, this place smells like...<eos> Regret?<eos> Failure?
It's a Boyle!<eos> Whoo! Ugh, this place smells like...<eos> Regret?<eos> Failure?<eos> - Ketchup.
I just thought that that kind of transparency between you and I would put you in an awkward position with the league.<eos> Let me worry about what position I'm in.<eos> Fine, it's true.<eos> I'm guilty of sniffing in the tall weeds.<eos> With a short snout.
So, when you ask me why I wanna do this, my answer is because I know what guy I wanna be.<eos> What about you?<eos> I definitely don't wanna be the guy that just lets the clock run out, you know.<eos> I definitely do not wanna be the guy who just sits there while time fucking stands still. I wanna be the guy.<eos> - The fucking guy? - Yeah!
I'm actually curious.<eos> She's curious.<eos> Tell me what it is you think I'm gonna wanna hear, Spencer.<eos> I just met with the Cowboys.<eos> - Underlings?
- And are you available to meet with him?<eos> He's ready to support our efforts.<eos> Wayne, this is a meeting you are really going to enjoy.<eos> The only one on this Earth who he admires just as much as himself is Wayne Hastings, Jr.<eos> Junior.
Have I been a bad boy?<eos> Am I gonna get a spanking 'cause you know I...<eos> Just listen.<eos> I don't know if you realize this, but whenever you're between projects, you tend to get a little insecure.<eos> Oh. A little clingy.
Then I'm gonna say "thanks" because I'm not most people.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> We met Green Fury!<eos> I guess we know what you're talking about over dinner with Hannah tonight.<eos> Who?
I would go balcony.<eos> Jackie!<eos> Yeah, I was upset when Mother sent me my childhood toys, but I am really enjoying this trip down memory lane.<eos> It seems like just yesterday that I was playing with<eos> - My Little Pony.
And assuming it really does work, reclaiming Wall Maria is feasible, too.<eos> Up until now, we've had to transport a large quantity of materials and supplies.<eos> That's why the need for outposts past the wall limited our progress. But if we don't have to accommodate supply wagons we could quickly make our way to Shiganshina.<eos> What if we carried out the plan at night?<eos> At night?
Samurai...<eos> Jack?<eos> You may witness, but you cannot proceed any further.<eos> Witness what?<eos> The end.
John to the rescue.<eos> My hero.<eos> John the bloody mug, more like.<eos> Well, I'll see you in the morning.<eos> The morning?
Face painting and fruit scones and multi-neurons.<eos> How the mighty fall!<eos> I've shared a stage with Mark King, I have.<eos> Who?<eos> Mark King.
Spare key.<eos> 'I hope you're well.<eos> Justin in with you...'<eos> You're on your arse!<eos> Under the plant pot? !
Okay.<eos> There's Archer's car, the cops...<eos> Park behind them.<eos> And both of you wait here.<eos> With pleasure.
No, I meant...<eos> I know what you meant.<eos> You! You turned me into a freak!<eos> I think you might be confusing me with your personal shopper.<eos> - My what?
And also...<eos> I've lost track of time! What was that?<eos> Sounds like somebody's smashing up all your shit.<eos> With a halberd. Woooooooo!<eos> Yeah.
That could be problematic.<eos> Wynonna is in my life, Rosita.<eos> As are you, make no mistake.<eos> But it would help if there wasn't a divide between my lover<eos> - and my...
Holy shit, the seals!<eos> We need three magical seals to keep Clootie in his tomb.<eos> We tell no one else where we put them.<eos> Even each other.<eos> That way...
Time is not really my strong suit.<eos> Yeah, and you're not entirely human.<eos> Not for a while now.<eos> I was granted immortality like your friend, Doc, along with a few other perks.<eos> And some burdens.
And if you break it, and if Clootie rises, how do you propose to kill the mighty demon Wyatt himself could not put in the grave<eos> - We'll figure it out, and then we'll end the curse.<eos> Doc, we'll end it!<eos> Together.<eos> Not like this.
I am too occupied to translate whatever cryptic thing you are telling me.<eos> I just hope all this ammo isn't target practice on every guy in town who's ever looked at Wynonna<eos> - with a tinkle in his... eye.<eos> - You cannot possibly understand what I am dealing with at this time. Doc, you're still a part of this family, even if the baby isn't yours.<eos> Ohhh, poop.
Breathe, breathe, breathe.<eos> - Shit, shit!<eos> - I mean, you were... you were drunk, right?<eos> So are you sure you had sex with the...<eos> with the revenant guy?
- That's never gonna happen.<eos> - What do you think, Harvey?<eos> Do you think that's "never gonna happen"?<eos> Like I said, whatever you throw at us, we'll throw it right the hell back.<eos> With what manpower?
I haven't had me daughter fall asleep on me for a very long time.<eos> You can't tell anyone this, OK?<eos> I was in James Morecroft's flat today.<eos> He's been living with two women.<eos> - His cousins.
I-I'd never think to practice such things.<eos> The Archbishop would prefer that life in Wallachia be kept simple, Mayor.<eos> Simple.<eos> Pure.<eos> Good.
Ohh. The Bishop took her.<eos> Witchcraft, he said.<eos> They're burning her at the stake.<eos> She was good to me, your wife.<eos> A good doctor.
I do this last kindness in her name, she who loved you humans and cared for your ills.<eos> Take your family and leave Wallachia tonight.<eos> Pack and go, and do not look back for no more do I travel as a man.<eos> Ah. There. Quite a show.<eos> Drinks?
- Is it poisonous?<eos> - No, Donna, it is not.<eos> Okay.<eos> Well, I got my eyes on you.<eos> And that plant.
I called Alex.<eos> And what I did was call my law school roommate at the DOJ about the anti-trust issues raised by you merging with Gorban.<eos> What do you want?<eos> We want you to live up to the terms of the original agreement.<eos> With one exception.
He can, but I got a ton of work to do, and I'd like to get home before midnight.<eos> There's something I need to tell you.<eos> Harvey, what's going on?<eos> I've been seeing Paula Agard.<eos> And not as my therapist anymore.
I needed to tell her, and it was unfair to her, and it was unfair to you.<eos> - I never said that.<eos> - No, but you meant it.<eos> Harvey, if you're not careful, you're gonna become a full-fledged outstanding boyfriend.<eos> Boyfriend?
- I never said that.<eos> - No, but you meant it.<eos> Harvey, if you're not careful, you're gonna become a full-fledged outstanding boyfriend.<eos> Boyfriend?<eos> Boyfriend.
House of Belmont?<eos> Trevor Belmont.<eos> Last son of the house of Belmont.<eos> The Belmonts fought creatures of the night, did they not?<eos> For generations.
Oh, relax.<eos> Brian, he's got this, he's so good with kids.<eos> - And he does like to be involved.<eos> - Very involved.<eos> Almost uncomfortably involved.
It just seemed weird not to include him.<eos> Why would it be weird now?<eos> You've been divorced for over 30 years.<eos> - Well, he just broke up with Padma...<eos> - Right, right, right.
Anything?<eos> No. Nothing.<eos> Calmly, we need to evacuate the floor.<eos> Mikey, come on. It's a joke, man.<eos> Yeah, probably, yeah. But still.
Now, today I shall be finishing off an arctic stipple.<eos> - What did I just say?<eos> - Raspberry ripple?<eos> No, not a raspberry ripple.<eos> An arctic stipple.
She gave me this book, actually, by your old coach Warren Sharp.<eos> Where's my jacket?<eos> For as long as I can remember, it has been my ambition to become an Olympian.<eos> What?<eos> Olympics.
Forty soldiers capture a bunch of boys with broken shotguns.<eos> Just hang 'em.<eos> These boys, these-- these young men.<eos> They was your friends.<eos> Your cousins.
Just hang 'em.<eos> These boys, these-- these young men.<eos> They was your friends.<eos> Your cousins.<eos> Your brothers and your kin.
Don't worry. Just the generator.<eos> Maybe it's a car outside.<eos> That's not possible.<eos> I heard one earlier.<eos> Above my room.
And so, my first thought was to come here. And when I got here, Howard was closing the door. And I could see it, right there on his face, he knew something was happening.<eos> I heard a car.<eos> Right here. Above us.<eos> You heard someone?<eos> Right above us.
So, I sat with gurus... And sacred women.<eos> Strangers carried me to mountaintops to see holy men.<eos> And finally... I found my teacher.<eos> And my mind was elevated... And my spirit deepened.<eos> And somehow...
This one's got pages missing.<eos> That's the book of cagliostro.<eos> A study of time.<eos> One of the rituals was stolen by a former master.<eos> The zealot, kaecilius.
Yeah, okay.<eos> Wise choice.<eos> You'll wear the eye of agamotto... Once you've mastered its powers.<eos> Until then... Best not to walk the streets wearing an infinity stone.<eos> A what?
I demand an apology right now.<eos> You will apologize to me.<eos> I will apologize...<eos> Thank you.<eos> To my men.
I'm obligated to serve.<eos> Obligated"?<eos> What of your obligation to mother...<eos> And...<eos> And to us...
You know, are you seeing anyone right now?<eos> -Seeing anyone?<eos> -Yeah.<eos> -Just for business purposes.<eos> -Business purposes only.
So, go get us a drink.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - Not... Not with this wallet.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - With the sausage wallet.
Okay.<eos> Great talk.<eos> Bye.<eos> Just...<eos> Uh, merry Christmas.
Actually, technically, we would have a four-year-old daughter, in which case, her name would be Rihanna.<eos> What?<eos> We haven't known each other four years.<eos> No, not you.<eos> Josh.
Thanks for calling.<eos> Don't be weird.<eos> Thank you, thank...<eos> Well, are you gonna come meet her or not?<eos> - Her? - Mmm-hmm.
That was excellent.<eos> The thing about being single is, you should cherish it.<eos> Because, in a week, or a lifetime, of being alone, you may only get one moment.<eos> One moment, when you're not tied up in a relationship with anyone.<eos> A parent, a pet, a sibling, a friend.
It's about my dad.<eos> I don't like him.<eos> Why don't you like him?<eos> 'Cause he's mean.<eos> Not to me.
You know, takin' your life back... it can be scary sometimes.<eos> - Uh, no.<eos> - But I'll be there, okay? I understand...<eos> No, you don't understand what's goin' on with us!<eos> With who?
- Uh, no.<eos> - But I'll be there, okay? I understand...<eos> No, you don't understand what's goin' on with us!<eos> With who?<eos> With me and Donnie.

How was that?<eos> Not always easy.<eos> A little more than you wanted to know about yourself.<eos> And then, when I was 17... he had a heart attack.<eos> Right at his keypad.
Daddy left before I was conceived.<eos> Ever had a cigarette put out on your skin?<eos> Where else do you put one out?<eos> I was molested.<eos> Me too.
Happy Valentine's Day.<eos> Happy Chinese New Year.<eos> Year of the Dog.<eos> Relax.<eos> And Happy International Women's Day.
And Happy International Women's Day.<eos> No.<eos> No.<eos> No.<eos> Happy Lent.
No.<eos> Happy Lent.<eos> -Wade?<eos> -Sorry.<eos> Happy Halloween.
Happy Lent.<eos> -Wade?<eos> -Sorry.<eos> Happy Halloween.<eos> Happy Halloween.
More Shake Weight-y.<eos> The world needs extraordinary soldiers.<eos> We won't just make you better.<eos> We will make you better than better.<eos> A superhero.
Yeah, it's right next to the prostate.<eos> Or is that the on switch?<eos> Enough!<eos> Let us go talk to the Professor.<eos> McAvoy or Stewart?
Wait.<eos> Seriously, you actually have something in your teeth now.<eos> Enjoy your weekend.<eos> "Weekend"?<eos> Back up.
The cock thistle that turned me into this freak... slipped through my arms today...<eos> Arm.<eos> Catching him was my only chance to be hot again, get my super sexy ex back... and prevent this shit from happening to someone else.<eos> So, yeah, today was about as much fun as a sandpaper dildo.<eos> #driveby.
I'm so proud of you.<eos> Drop Bandhu off, safe and gentle-like.<eos> Kill him.<eos> And then, win Gita back... the old fashioned way:<eos> with your boyish charm.
So, you live in a house.<eos> I should have come and found you sooner.<eos> But, baby, the guy under this mask, he ain't the same one that you remember.<eos> You mean this mask?<eos> And this one.
Is that his wife?<eos> Did I ever get over losing Mr. Darcy?<eos> Was he my Mr. Right?<eos> Oh, Christ.<eos> A man of outstanding charm and charisma.
You need some good old-fashioned, lie-back-and-think-of-England bonking.<eos> And festivals are sexual free-for-alls.<eos> Like Sodom and Gomorrah, with tofu.<eos> First man you meet, you gotta sleep with.<eos> First man?
A lady is always prepared.<eos> And I always carry these in my handbag.<eos> Oh, God!<eos> You didn't use those?<eos> The vegan condoms?
Well, it seems I can always find time to save the world.<eos> But you're my world.<eos> I thought you were back with Candida.<eos> You know perfectly well her name is Camilla.<eos> Camilla.
Hello?<eos> Um, yeah.<eos> IcanW.laHeady made plans for tonight, baby.<eos> - Plans with who?<eos> - With Bob Stone.
What?<eos> I don't need it.<eos> What I do need is information.<eos> I need you to tell me everything and anything about your contact with Agent Stone.<eos> - Agent Stone?
I don't need it.<eos> What I do need is information.<eos> I need you to tell me everything and anything about your contact with Agent Stone.<eos> - Agent Stone?<eos> - Bob, your friend Bob.
What?<eos> What?<eos> Mr. Joyner, Bob Stone is The Black Badger.<eos> Phil was Bob's partner of six years.<eos> His best friend.
Yeah, kinda.<eos> You gotta be shitting me glory!<eos> No, not at all.<eos> I just thought that maybe a facing-your-own-death situation might help motivate you to clarify some of your goals in life.<eos> And, hey, between me and you,
Can I send somebody to help you change before we land?<eos> All those cameras.<eos> People will be watching.<eos> There were wanted posters everywhere.<eos> For Jack.
Ma'am, we have to go.<eos> Director Levinson... I'm gonna talk to my supervisor... and make sure you get all the money you need.<eos> What are those green lights?<eos> The ship will touch down over the Atlantic.<eos> - Which part?
If it's still there.<eos> Okay, it's getting real.<eos> It's getting real real.<eos> All right, form up.<eos> On me.
Everybody, we got one shot at this.<eos> Let's make it count.<eos> Thanks for always looking out for me, Jake.<eos> You got it, buddy.<eos> Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Look, okay, I know it's against the rules, but I can't wait anymore.<eos> I need to just feel you.<eos> Are you thinking what I'm thinking?<eos> - Just the tips?<eos> - Just the tips?
This wave's gotta crash.<eos> I can't!<eos> You're all alive and looking at me with your...<eos> With your gloves... and your little shoes and your arms and your legs!<eos> Legs, huh?
I wasn't respectful of your beliefs... and I acted like I had all the answers, but I don't.<eos> Nobody knows everything.<eos> But what I do know is that together we can fight these monsters... and take control of our own lives.<eos> Yes!<eos> Our lives and our bodies!
- Whatever we want.<eos> What do you want?<eos> Let's just say, what I want involves much more than:<eos> Just the tips<eos> Just the tips
Speak.<eos> Uh, hey, I got you that info. Gabriel Charles Welch, 35.<eos> He, uh, served three years on the force. Oh, you sure?<eos> Yeah, racked up a slew of reprimands before getting dismissed for a questionable shooting.<eos> Questionable how?
Come here.<eos> Luis, please. You're embarrassing me.<eos> Sit down.<eos> Is that yours?<eos> Happy anniversary.
Police suspect that he's fled the country and some even say with compromising documents.<eos> I have two alternatives.<eos> Either shoot myself or come clean and tell the truth.<eos> And when I say come clean, I mean with all the consequences.<eos> Absolutely all of them.
- Is it already finished?<eos> - Mike, how you been?<eos> - Skip, are we done here?<eos> - You gotta talk to Vidrine.<eos> Vidrine?
Did they run the cement log?<eos> Roger that.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Gentlemen, you couldn't perhaps enlighten me on this cement log situation, could ya?<eos> Cement log?
Or just... just us.<eos> Like just-just-just us?<eos> Uh, yeah. You know.<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> Or a group.
This is not right.<eos> You have seen the blood.<eos> She's just a child.<eos> I need not answer to you.<eos> Only to God.
My dearest Abe. I hope this card finds you well.<eos> The children and I yearn in hear your news.<eos> I do hope you wit! Visit us again soon.<eos> We should so love to see you.<eos> With admiration.
- I don't.<eos> They'll kill him.<eos> They'll kill him no matter what.<eos> The time they spend killing him, is time they are not chasing us.<eos> Careful with that.
Write down nine feet.<eos> - Steer to the rear of the palace. - Yes!<eos> Above you!<eos> - Light a grenade!<eos> Behind you!
- Yeah.<eos> Bye.<eos> Where you going looking all spruced and nice?<eos> Met someone yesterday.<eos> A nurse over at the hospital.
So why do you people keep paying attention to it?<eos> Probably because our network insists on tracking it.<eos> - Right here at the bottom of the screen...<eos> - Not sticking to the script.<eos> ...in large font all day.
I didn't even know you were sick!<eos> Although you have been looking a little...<eos> I'm not sick.<eos> ...healthy.<eos> A little healthy.
-In this...<eos> -Chitty-chitty chat-chat.<eos> -In...<eos> -Chat, chat, chat.<eos> -In the...
Come on.<eos> We can do this.<eos> Po...<eos> You taught us who we were meant to be.<eos> A father.
We can do this.<eos> Po...<eos> You taught us who we were meant to be.<eos> A father.<eos> A friend.
You taught us who we were meant to be.<eos> A father.<eos> A friend.<eos> A dumpling kicker.<eos> A lethal fighting machine.
A father.<eos> A friend.<eos> A dumpling kicker.<eos> A lethal fighting machine.<eos> A hugger.
A friend.<eos> A dumpling kicker.<eos> A lethal fighting machine.<eos> A hugger.<eos> A nunchuck chick.
A dumpling kicker.<eos> A lethal fighting machine.<eos> A hugger.<eos> A nunchuck chick.<eos> Stripy Baby.
You can't remember anything.<eos> It's probably how you lost your family in the first place!<eos> All right, look, let's just take it down a notch.<eos> Just give me the tag and-- you know something, for a guy with three hearts you're not very nice.<eos> Three hearts?
One, two, three...<eos> Four...<eos> You're welcome.<eos> Who are you talking to, kelpcake?<eos> My pipe pal, destiny!
That's-- that's a good idea?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I just thought I'd go enjoy the view.<eos> Bye.<eos> The view.
There's a lot we still don't know.<eos> We can detect them in children.<eos> Unfortunately, the screening procedure for adults is a bit more complicated.<eos> What about our kids?<eos> Yeah, what about our kids?
We leave in the morning.<eos> This is a waste of time.<eos> Go ahead and try it again.<eos> Those kids are gonna be dead before their boots hit the ground.<eos> Especially with you as squad leader.
Hi!<eos> Yes, this is Rascal.<eos> Are you and your wife ready to make the deal?<eos> Yes, Mrs. Flatts and I are very excited about it.<eos> Tomorrow night.
A land of people who dream of nothing more.<eos> - It's my turn now.<eos> - I won't fight.<eos> I love you, brother.<eos> With all my heart.
- You should know why I could not.<eos> Then, when I asked you to marry me, why did you say yes?<eos> I remember when you rode out of the desert. Impetuous.<eos> Dashing.<eos> So handsome.
He's improving.<eos> Your woman's still dead, isn't she?<eos> Shame.<eos> Such a pretty girl.<eos> Such lovely soft skin.
To live again.<eos> To be whole again.<eos> Horus mourned his parents.<eos> They had long since passed into the Afterlife. But he knew it was the wisdom of Ra that the Final Gate would remain as it had always been.<eos> An unbreakable barrier between this life and immortality.
A man with dozens of hired guns on his payroll.<eos> We know that, Turner.<eos> - Who's gonna stand up to a man like that? - We will.<eos> - But how?<eos> With what?
Come on up here.<eos> Come on, boy. Come on!<eos> It's okay, son.<eos> Now, I come here for gold.<eos> Gold.
Shot of busthead.<eos> Sorry, don't carry that kind, cowboy.<eos> Well, in that case, I'll have a double.<eos> - What's that for?<eos> - Information.
We have heard the chimes at midnight.<eos> Have we not?<eos> So what's the play here, Sam?<eos> What's the payout?<eos> Little gold?
Have we not?<eos> So what's the play here, Sam?<eos> What's the payout?<eos> Little gold?<eos> Cash money?
So what's the play here, Sam?<eos> What's the payout?<eos> Little gold?<eos> Cash money?<eos> Diamonds?
Sir, they're here.<eos> Louise Banks?<eos> Ian Donnelly?<eos> When was the last time either of you have eaten?<eos> - Last night.
General Shang.<eos> The pleasure is mine, really.<eos> Your President said he was honored to host me at the celebration...<eos> - ...but I confess, the only reason why I'm here is to meet you in person.<eos> Me?
What a surprise.<eos> Alice.<eos> Well. Welcome home.<eos> We were afraid you might never come back with our ship.<eos> My ship.
And give up on the impossible?<eos> Then who will I be?<eos> You're Alice, of course.<eos> Absolem?<eos> Absolem.
-Wait!<eos> -Just like her father.<eos> A great man, no doubt, but one touched in the head.<eos> It appears the apple has not fallen far from the tree.<eos> Absolem.
That's his muchness.<eos> That's what makes him so...<eos> Him.<eos> But he's grown darker...<eos> Less dafter.
But please keep your bewilderment brief and to the point.<eos> -Your majesty.<eos> -Nice to meet you, sir.<eos> I seek a thief of meager intellect.<eos> Her hair...
-Nice to meet you, sir.<eos> I seek a thief of meager intellect.<eos> Her hair...<eos> Yes?<eos> Yellowish.
A customer with a lovely head...<eos> Right here.<eos> What is the hat of your heart's desire, madam?<eos> Something...<eos> Feathery?
What is the hat of your heart's desire, madam?<eos> Something...<eos> Feathery?<eos> Something...<eos> Button-y?
Show your cards, gentlemen.<eos> Do you know what Comanche means?<eos> It means enemies forever.<eos> Enemies with who?<eos> Everyone.
Shoot him!<eos> Stacey?<eos> Stacey.<eos> I can hear them, telling me what they want to do to you.<eos> To everyone.
A Zealot, and that he will be subject today to the customary punishment of crucifixion.<eos> May his punishment stand as a warning.<eos> Ah, the Zealots.<eos> All they want is freedom.<eos> And at what cost?
You keep my family, and my house clean of this.<eos> Now get out.<eos> The boy?<eos> He's safe here.<eos> Safer than with you.
All I want them to do is change the job description, give everybody a chance to drive the truck.<eos> Brownie can't see that.<eos> He ain't got that much sense.<eos> How you figure he be making out with that gal, be up in Taylors' all the time?<eos> - That Alberta gal?
You ain't gonna sneak up on me no more.<eos> When you ready for me, when the top of your list say Troy Maxson, then you come on up and knock on the front door.<eos> Ain't nobody else got nothing to do with this.<eos> This between you and me.<eos> Man to man!
You just gotta get back out there.<eos> Think what you wanna do.<eos> - Estate agent, maybe. - Ooh!<eos> Yeah.<eos> Shop assistant. Catering.
- Less than 300 calories. - Mmm.<eos> What's this?<eos> Oh, it's the trip I told you about.<eos> I thought you meant Lourdes or something.<eos> "Hot tub under the stars."
Oh, look. "Five-star luxury, 24-hour room service."<eos> This isn't work.<eos> Do you really expect me to just sit here while you swan off with another man on a honeymoon?<eos> His other caregiver's coming, too.<eos> Oh, two guys.
You love them.<eos> No one could have done more than you.<eos> You have a heart as big as that castle, and I love you for it.<eos> Have you seen them?<eos> Mr. Traynor?
You have a heart as big as that castle, and I love you for it.<eos> Have you seen them?<eos> Mr. Traynor?<eos> They left.<eos> This morning.
Michelle, I want to talk about you.<eos> That you were, basically, abandoned as a child, bounced around from foster home to foster home, and that, really, you were raised in an orphanage.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> I was lucky enough to attend a beautiful, lovely elite boarding school, very much like Hogwarts, to give you a visual.<eos> And almost as magical.
Some people depend on this.<eos> Like, they don't have a car.<eos> Well, I know that.<eos> Roller-skating or roller-blading?<eos> Roller-blading.
- Good luck with your product!<eos> Oh, man.<eos> I mean, what is it, anyway?<eos> It looks like just a bunch of homemade, gluten-filled, sugar-filled, diabetes cake.<eos> With chocolate!
Mind your own business.<eos> Oh, my gosh, what happened to you?<eos> I had a fight.<eos> All right?<eos> With a big, stupid dog.
What's the matter, Maria?<eos> Maria, your face, it wears a thousand sorrows.<eos> What is wrong?<eos> Oh, I have come face-to-face with the worst thing in the world.<eos> What?
What?<eos> Oh, tell me, Maria.<eos> T ell me now!<eos> I cannot bear another moment without knowing!<eos> Loneliness.
Okay. Uh, well...<eos> We used the spoon...<eos> Hit a button on the machine on the counter...<eos> Right, and it's got those... The, uh, you know.<eos> Those blades.
I got them!<eos> Max!<eos> Remember me!<eos> I feel heroic!<eos> And handsome.
Is that what you do?<eos> Sometimes.<eos> I'm not in the future now.<eos> Not in the past, I'm right here.<eos> With you.
Like white people.<eos> Check, please.<eos> This isn't lipstick. This is a tattoo, you dumb fuck.<eos> Who are you laughing at?<eos> Who?
Aw! Thank you.<eos> Hey, who needs a bachelorette party when they have you around?<eos> - He rubbed my butt.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> But with his butt.
You play cribbage with a weasel.<eos> And he cheats like there's no tomorrow.<eos> You know what, pretty much all predators.<eos> And Zootopia's full of them.<eos> Oh, Stu.
Because this is Zootopia.<eos> Anyone can be anything.<eos> Boy, I tell him that all the time.<eos> All right, here you go.<eos> Two paws.
No, it's true.<eos> I think I was 8, or maybe 9... and all I wanted to do was join the Junior Ranger Scouts.<eos> So, my mom scraped together enough money to buy me a brand-new uniform... because, by God, I was gonna fit in.<eos> Even if I was the only predator in the troop.<eos> The only fox.
Ha-ha, yes. Superman.<eos> Yeah, but there are, uh...<eos> Therearemoreofthem .<eos> The metahuman thesis.<eos> Yes, themetahumanthesis.
How is that justice?<eos> Talk to me.<eos> Help me change it.<eos> With what?<eos> Your pen?
This is about the future of the world.<eos> This is my legacy.<eos> My father sat me down right here.<eos> Told me what Wayne manor was built on.<eos> Railroads, real estates, and oil.
No, we should be going this way if you're late.<eos> [HONKING]<eos> [MUSIC PLAYING ON RADIO]<eos> - Do you like Chicago?<eos> - Not in the winter.
I'm Dr. Hakem.<eos> Come inside.<eos> Did you do something to it?<eos> - I did a bit of investigating.<eos> - With what?
Come inside.<eos> Did you do something to it?<eos> - I did a bit of investigating.<eos> - With what?<eos> - A steak knife.
I lived in New Jersey for about five years.<eos> And then later in business school, Schwinn was one of our case studies.<eos> Mm.<eos> Interesting period.<eos> This way.
We collected fronds from the pine trees and lined the bottom with them.<eos> And he says, "Alan, what do we need now?"<eos> And I knew.<eos> We needed a needle and thread.<eos> Or... duct tape.
And I must say, when we were all settled in there, it was really warm.<eos> And you didn't have a fire?<eos> No fire.<eos> Just each other.<eos> And in the morning?
But they were wrong.<eos> They don't know me.<eos> I don't know what happens next, but this I do know:<eos> If you hurt me, I have to be worse.<eos> * C R I M I N A L *
May I say just one thing?<eos> What I saw you do today, I've never seen anything like it.<eos> I've been trying to get that honey for years.<eos> But I used my tricks.<eos> What tricks?
Outrun that volcano?<eos> You bet we can, Mr. President.<eos> What are you doing in my truck?<eos> Yeah, I can take you and your sister to Coachella.<eos> Sisters?
Get out!<eos> You were the one who pushed me into your truck!<eos> Give me my truck back!<eos> Who are you talking to?<eos> That!
Or in our town.<eos> So, that's something to thank your dad for, at least.<eos> God!<eos> Where are you going?<eos> Hey, hey.
- Have you?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Okay, come here. What is it that you want?<eos> I wanted to meet you.<eos> Everybody, really.
Well, to start with, the man you stole from last year, turns out I had invested quite a lot of money in some of his companies, so a lot of what you stole was, in fact, mine.<eos> Good news is, it's very easy for you to pay me back.<eos> I just need your skills.<eos> Owen and I were like the Beatles, if the Beatles had been...<eos> Elfin?
Good news is, it's very easy for you to pay me back.<eos> I just need your skills.<eos> Owen and I were like the Beatles, if the Beatles had been...<eos> Elfin?<eos> ...geniuses.
Either way, we're left holding a whole sack full of nada.<eos> Yeah, but they're gonna come after us as if we do have something.<eos> No. Okay.<eos> I agree that somebody got the better of us.<eos> Okay? Somehow.
Okay, hit the road, Jack!<eos> No, no, no!<eos> A lot of brain, but not enough brawn.<eos> Oh, that was fun!<eos> Cheers!
But I'll never do that again... okay?<eos> Never.<eos> Here we go.<eos> Here.<eos> Close to me, there.
Magical Congress of the United States of America.<eos> So you work for MACUSA.<eos> What are you, some kind of investigator?<eos> At least tell me you took care of the No-Maj.<eos> - The what?
What are you, some kind of investigator?<eos> At least tell me you took care of the No-Maj.<eos> - The what?<eos> - The No-Maj.<eos> No-Magic.
At least tell me you took care of the No-Maj.<eos> - The what?<eos> - The No-Maj.<eos> No-Magic.<eos> The non-wizard!
I love to cook.<eos> - You're a Legilimens? - Mmm.<eos> Yeah.<eos> But I always have trouble with your kind.<eos> Brits.
Of course I fought in the war.<eos> Everyone fought in the war.<eos> - You didn't fight in the war?<eos> - I worked mostly with dragons.<eos> Ukrainian Ironbellies.
Show me.<eos> My boy, the sooner we find this child, the sooner you can put that pain in the past where it belongs.<eos> I want you to have this, Credence.<eos> I would trust very few with it.<eos> Very few.
So, you're missing it.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Because of me.<eos> So, you close to him?<eos> Who, my dad?
Hey, what's with Gunga Din in there?<eos> - Who?<eos> - The big-eyed kid.<eos> - The kid?<eos> - Yeah, in the pen.
Talk to them yet?<eos> They took my phone.<eos> Talk to anyone? N...<eos> What do you mean?<eos> - Here. - Like, who?
A big family, someday a place in the country.<eos> Where will you find...<eos> An end of a trail.<eos> A day without death.<eos> Peace.
This friend said he was told... that the sighting was stolen by two women.<eos> They went to the tomb before dawn that morning.<eos> And found it empty.<eos> And later met Yeshua on the road.<eos> Alive.
Yes, with all the heart, I do.<eos> Do you love him?<eos> Yes.<eos> Simon,do you love me?<eos> With all my heart.
And know that I'll be with you.<eos> Always!<eos> Lord.<eos> It's not just about life eternal, but how life is lived.<eos> By the sword or by love.
I might've mentioned you couple of times over the years.<eos> "Couple of times"?<eos> I'll show him your wall, Dad.<eos> There's you as a kid.<eos> - Leg it!
And they learned it from their parents.<eos> And them from theirs.<eos> And one day... you'll sing it to your children, too.<eos> What happened to them?<eos> Your parents.
What happened to them?<eos> Your parents.<eos> They were taken from me... when I was a little boy.<eos> But they're still here.<eos> Inside.
They were taken from me... when I was a little boy.<eos> But they're still here.<eos> Inside.<eos> And here.<eos> With you.
I'll see you guys.<eos> Watch where you're going.<eos> I can't.<eos> Who are you talking to?<eos> Me.
Yes, I looked her up once.<eos> Twice.<eos> But not in a long time, all right?<eos> How did you leave things?<eos> Any hard feelings?
I have level-five clearance.<eos> Ever since the world found out about mutants in '73... there have been cults who see them as some kind of... Second Coming or sign of God.<eos> I was tracking one of them.<eos> They call themselves Ashir En Sabah Nur... named after an ancient being they believe to be the world's first.<eos> The world's first what?
Like the Four Horsemen... of the Apocalypse.<eos> He got that one from the Bible.<eos> Or the Bible got it from him.<eos> And wherever he ruled... eventually, it would end in disaster.<eos> Cataclysm.
Betshez?<eos> Where is everyone?<eos> Surprise!<eos> Happy anniversary, honey!<eos> Anniversary?
Throw it away?<eos> Look, I got people looking at me for an example.<eos> What do you mean, people?<eos> What people?<eos> Black people?
Doris!<eos> Yaaah!<eos> Where is she?<eos> Where is she?<eos> In the hatch.
- Is Eamon there?<eos> - Eamon?<eos> Hey, Eamon.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Nothing really.
Conor.<eos> Conor Lawlor.<eos> What's going on?<eos> With what?<eos> This.
Look, she was always gonna do her own thing, wasn't she?<eos> She's mad like that, determined.<eos> Where is she?<eos> She's gone to London with her fella.<eos> Last night.
I'm saying you carry an orange fucking backpack.<eos> I've seen people with actual experience make bad decisions here.<eos> So while you're outside the wire with my men, you will in no way distract them, understood?<eos> Are you asking me not to sleep with your soldiers?<eos> No, not "soldiers".

That little bastard!<eos> Oh, no, Kim.<eos> You didn't give Egg Boy money, did you?<eos> Hey!<eos> Egg Boy!
- Kim Baker?<eos> It is Sadiq.<eos> Mr. Sadiq, hi.<eos> How about an interview with Pacha Khan?<eos> Pacha Khan, the warlord?
Okay, you can think that, but we don't make fun of people.<eos> Right, dad?<eos> That's right.<eos> - We don't make fun of people.<eos> - Except christians.
Well, I am so happy that our family is together.<eos> Thanks for putting on this feast.<eos> It's all local and, um, organic and non-gmo, so...<eos> How did you kill those chickens?<eos> With an ax or a knife?
I was in Sheffield studying a veterinary course.<eos> My parents didn't call.<eos> They drove up and told me.<eos> My brother was everything to me.<eos> Protector, teacher.
But he didn't exactly say I couldn't come.<eos> And, I don't know, things have been going pretty good lately.<eos> Do you ever wonder why people kiss with their lips?<eos> I mean, why not rub ears like, "I want to hear you."<eos> Or wrists, like this.
He knows I wasn't poaching.<eos> My patch, you're selling papers.<eos> - What else do you call it?<eos> - Envy.<eos> - Envy?
I'm the one who needs to apologize.<eos> - No...<eos> - Jack, what are you doing out there?<eos> I'm talking to my son.<eos> And my grandson.
Ardsley-on-Hudson is boring and routine.<eos> It's a fucking baby factory.<eos> I wanna start my life over again.<eos> So far, I've been a rebellious teenager, lover, waitress, gallery director,<eos> nanny, and a whore.
In fact, the only time I feel like myself is when I'm running.<eos> You always felt that way?<eos> Maybe since I was about 17.<eos> Hmm. With Mac.<eos> ABDICI Mac?
Uh, well, I like to think so.<eos> So you said on the phone you wanted to tell me something about Megan.<eos> What did you wanna tell me?<eos> I saw your wife with someone on Friday morning.<eos> With who?
Where?<eos> This afternoon, when the police brought Scott baok home.<eos> She was across the street.<eos> And when she saw me, she got aggressive.<eos> Aggressive how?
I was honestlyjust trying to help you.<eos> You're Tom's crazy ex.<eos> When the fuck were you gonna tell me that, huh?<eos> And now the detective is asking if you and I are in a relationship?<eos> You'?
Oh, well, thank you for getting Abdic to point the finger at me.<eos> For getting the cops to say that you and I are fucking!<eos> How are they going, huh?<eos> You know, the sessions.<eos> With the doctor.
So we should talk.<eos> And laugh.<eos> Okay.<eos> After the war, I'm buying a ranch.<eos> With horses.
You did give blood!<eos> Good.<eos> I thought perhaps you were out with your mistress.<eos> It would explain why you were different with me last night.<eos> Different?
Piano?<eos> Don't move.<eos> Who wants some American cigarettes?<eos> Sometimes the Krauts they come to get American cigarettes.<eos> American cigarettes?
He truly lived.<eos> Sailed around the world.<eos> Fought men from every country.<eos> Lay with the most beautiful women alive.<eos> - And men.

- Yeah.<eos> - We dated, actually.<eos> But I think Ben got over me since then.<eos> So are you here by yourself?<eos> No, girls' night out.
Always thought too much.<eos> That was your problem.<eos> - Was it?<eos> - So, what have you been up to?<eos> This and that.
You can not have too much of a good thing, you know?<eos> Can you? I can't!<eos> Tony tells me that you were both at Oxford with him.<eos> - With Belborough. - Yes.<eos> For a while.
Tony Donn and my wife will confirm that.<eos> What about Thursday?<eos> Play any golf, my Lord?<eos> I'm afraid I side with those that think it's a good walk spoiled.<eos> And the evening?
Well, I had to take you 'cause the first thing you'd be doing, you'd be scuttling around and yodelling the news that you were actually seeing a giant.<eos> And then, there would be a great rumple dumpus, wouldn't there?<eos> And all the human beans would be rummaging and whiffling for the giant what you saw, and getting wildly excited.<eos> And then they'd be locking me up in a cage to be looked at with all the squiggling, you know...<eos> Hippodumplings, and crocadowndillies, and jiggyraffes.
Hello, Mommy.<eos> What you doing in here, Luce?<eos> Just playing with my dolls.<eos> And who were you talking to?<eos> Just my dolls.
You like Glenn Campbell?<eos> Who!<eos> Never heard Glenn Campbell?<eos> What's gonna happen to him?<eos> With Glen Campbell?
Who!<eos> Never heard Glenn Campbell?<eos> What's gonna happen to him?<eos> With Glen Campbell?<eos> With Jimmy.
- You said "what happened to the driver"!<eos> Reynard is dead so he can't be driving.<eos> So, Jimmy Harris asks his old friend Reggie to be the driver.<eos> And Reggie, dubble crossing bastard... Decoys us and takes the money .<eos> Whose money?

Hack into the home computers of the whole office.<eos> All the guys, at least.<eos> I want to help, but that's a major violation.<eos> I'm offering $10,000 cash in hand.<eos> Between you and me.
- Hi, Rebecca! - Hi.<eos> Michèle.<eos> Beautiful!<eos> - Evening.<eos> - Evening.
Very true.<eos> I know it's rude to invite you last minute, but I'm having a Christmas get-together tomorrow.<eos> Patrick, did you hear that?<eos> Yeah.<eos> With pleasure.
It's not a popular profession right now.<eos> It never was.<eos> - I guess not.<eos> - Well.<eos> To Christmas!
Patrick,<eos> Rebecca.<eos> Ralf.<eos> Ralf.<eos> Merry Christmas!
Rebecca.<eos> Ralf.<eos> Ralf.<eos> Merry Christmas!<eos> Merry Christmas!
Thanks.<eos> Make yourself useful.<eos> Hold this.<eos> Who the fuck are you talking to?<eos> - You.
Meth.<eos> Thanks.<eos> You're a long way from home, huh?<eos> Yeah, I do selling. Door-to-door.<eos> Door-to-door selling?
No, uh, it's a butterfly with Ivy.<eos> - Wrong!<eos> - It's a little unicorn...<eos> - No...<eos> - With a rainbow...
I'm gonna get one of those for my nephew.<eos> He's 8.<eos> He'll love it.<eos> He went to second base!<eos> With me!
- A second secret.<eos> - Exactly.<eos> So he asks his high-school girlfriend to pose as his mistress.<eos> To create a diversion.<eos> A smoke screen.
You can trust me with this -I do.<eos> I haven't trusted anyone in years.<eos> It was a welcome change when they put me on terrorism watch duty.<eos> Every day I'd go in and I'd get starting points for SIGINT.<eos> Signals intelligence.
Someone I want you to meet.<eos> Mr. Lowell.<eos> -Jim. How are you?<eos> Dorian. Allan.<eos> Welcome to the U.S.
The elevator's slow as shit, though.<eos> Jesus. -It's something else, huh?<eos> So, what deck are you working on?<eos> -You NTOC or ROC?<eos> Between you and me?
Good. - A man that's happy to be here.<eos> - Excellent.<eos> - Very easy to work with.<eos> - And you're gonna play the setlist?<eos> Happy to.
# The kind of eyes that hypnotize me through # # That hypnotize me through #<eos> # And I ran, I ran so far away # # I couldn't get away #<eos> All right.<eos> I remember you. And I would admit I was a little curt that night.<eos> "Curt"?
And we already got our first case.<eos> - Old lady in Glendale. - Mmm-hmm.<eos> Thinks her husband's sleeping with Lynda Carter.<eos> Wonder Woman?<eos> Or Lynda Carter.
Strange. Go.<eos> Get back to work.<eos> As a rule, maniacs are cruel, cynical and, most importantly, smart.<eos> Smart? Yes.<eos> With extraordinary analytical abilities.
Nothing.<eos> I have to go.<eos> -Do you want juice?<eos> -No, thanks, it's with your defectyl anyway.<eos> Diphenyl.
-Yes?<eos> Ms. Svetlova, where were you last night?<eos> At my place.<eos> Alone?<eos> With Konstantin Sergeyevich.
-All right. Follow me.<eos> -And you stay.<eos> So what were you doing in Alyona's apartment on the day of the murder?<eos> I came to get the money.<eos> Which money?
Good.<eos> The warm-up is over.<eos> -Now you're going to have a sparring.<eos> -With whom?<eos> With a strong and experienced partner.
1:15 PM.<eos> Mikheyeva was kidnapped together with lung ventilation equipment.<eos> This means they weren't going to kill her.<eos> She needed surgery, so she was probably transferred to another traumatology department.<eos> Possibly under a false name.
-You are to pass a blood test.<eos> Am I arrested?<eos> -What's happening?<eos> -You'll have to come with us.<eos> Why?
No! Please!<eos> You!<eos> A moment.<eos> When was this?<eos> Yesterday morning.
Carry on, Company Sergeant.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Company!<eos> Left turn!<eos> Quick march!
I feel like I'm back in science class.<eos> Now all we need are test subjects.<eos> Candidates that will easily fall under my command.<eos> Large in size.<eos> Low in intellect.
- Hold your fire.<eos> What are you?<eos> We're not really into labels.<eos> Some call us freaks.<eos> Monsters.
If we can send that beacon back to where it came from, and April, Casey and Vern can close that portal on our command...<eos> - Good-bye, Technodrome.<eos> - Good-bye, Krang.<eos> Team effort.<eos> Team effort.
All right, fall in, guys!<eos> It's not that bad, it's just a dumb robot.<eos> I was expecting way worse. And what would that look like?<eos> I don't know, like a mustache maybe?<eos> Evil goatee or something.
I was expecting way worse. And what would that look like?<eos> I don't know, like a mustache maybe?<eos> Evil goatee or something.<eos> It's like a chewed-up piece of gum!<eos> With a face!
But... I think we'll stick with the arrangement we've had.<eos> If you ever need us, April knows where to find us.<eos> Really?<eos> You could live a normal life, like the rest of us.<eos> Normal?
We will raise this child as our own.<eos> Ours.<eos> Yours and mine.<eos> Raised in a lie.<eos> No, with a father.
Raised in a lie.<eos> No, with a father.<eos> A living, breathing man.<eos> Not the echo of a memory that they can never catch.<eos> Not a ghost.
No.<eos> The cause can only be strengthened by your sword.<eos> I'm sorry I doubted you, brother.<eos> Will you help us then?<eos> In what way?
What was the vic's name again?<eos> Are you still here?<eos> What the fuck?<eos> You don't remember?<eos> Red Label, rocks.

I should've told you to fuck off years ago, but instead I just let you become a bigger and bigger dick.<eos> Look, I'm sorry, but I've kept you on the tour.<eos> I keep you paid.<eos> I put food on the table.<eos> With dog shit in it!

Ah, kill me with thy weapons, not with words!<eos> My breast can better brook thy dagger's point<eos> Than can my ears that tragic history.<eos> But wherefore dids't thou come?<eos> Is't for my life?
Anderson Dawes.<eos> What for?<eos> I don't know.<eos> A few weeks before she shipped out, she asked me to hook her up with a data broker.<eos> This guy.
Until then I'll just, uh...<eos> I guess I'll do my pathetic best.<eos> Before she shipped out, she asked me to hook her up with a data broker.<eos> She was hanging around some hardcore OPA.<eos> Anderson Dawes.

Of course, Mr Mercier.<eos> Good day.<eos> Signore?<eos> I'm supposed to meet the President.<eos> - Frangois Mitterrand. - This way.
But the one Sook-Hee is pitying, do you know what she says about you?<eos> She says you're too naive, if someone were to pull your nipple you wouldn't even know what it means.<eos> She says you're so pitiful, so easy to blush.<eos> So easy to manipulate.<eos> With that innocent and naive face....
Hi, Suzy.<eos> Daddy's home.<eos> Hi, Daddy.<eos> Hi, sweetheart.<eos> Hug-
And they don't know about each other, so, uh, please don't say anything in case it comes up.<eos> I won't.<eos> Do you actually have sex with these girls?<eos> Well, we don't just play computer games.<eos> With both of them?
One of the sons passed away recently, I heard.<eos> Uh, yeah, my brother Joe.<eos> Very personable man.<eos> My father passed away in 1959.<eos> A young man.
Gabriel just texted: "Tiriac, cool." And I didn't get his card.<eos> The talking part went well.<eos> It doesn't need any more work.<eos> I made good use of the space, I spent time in the room beforehand, too.<eos> And the breathing?

You said it was towards Toledo.<eos> It's real close.<eos> Listen, I wanna tell ya somethin'.<eos> And it's like a real cone of silence.<eos> Just between you and me, right?
I don't have to look at the body?<eos> No.<eos> Okay.<eos> I have to warn you, pictures like this can be kind of... gritty.<eos> Gritty?
It's good to see you.<eos> It's so annoying.<eos> I hate to sit alone, knowing...<eos> It smells like rotting seaweed.<eos> Salt water.
No.<eos> I don't know.<eos> People like, uh, you know, purebreds or, uh, really pretty cats.<eos> This is what I would call a, uh...<eos> - Ugly cat.
Jack Rackham is not stupid.<eos> Jack Rackham is not blind.<eos> And Jack Rackham is not unaware that currently there are no men working on that fort.<eos> That said, on the list of people on this island who are most concerned with seeing that fort restored, there is everyone else, and then there is one name that's... that's way at the top of it.<eos> - Jack Rackham. - Yeah.

We have to remove the radiator.<eos> Get inside.<eos> It's so heavy!<eos> What a gift!<eos> And with my allergies...
To what part of Paris?<eos> - To the mountains, in fact.<eos> - The mountains?<eos> My friend and I bought a farm.<eos> - A real steal.
I'm going to divorce.<eos> Divorce?<eos> You seemed so...<eos> I don't know.<eos> United.
- Yeah, right...<eos> Why not?<eos> I suddenly find you naive.<eos> Who will I start over with?<eos> An old man?
Your boy is in no immediate danger, this I swear to you.<eos> But between us, dear, you did conspire to kill the queen's soldiers.<eos> We both know the penalty for that crime.<eos> How will poor Dom get on without his mother?<eos> And with his breathing problem.
I foster abused birds.<eos> I'd like to put a candle in it.<eos> I still have one shot to save the store.<eos> There's a town council meeting about the stadium tonight.<eos> Tonight, eh?
- Well, I know.<eos> But from time to time, she can be a little...<eos> - Hmm?<eos> - ..flat.<eos> - Flat?
Very wise.<eos> I have several patients who observe the five-year rule, but it's no sure prophylactic.<eos> Well, from the start, Florence felt that my health was paramount.<eos> Excitement stimulates the disease. She needs rest, Mr Bayfield.<eos> Rest.
The guy's a Sikh, and he gets beat half to death.<eos> Offer them low murder, and we're done with it.<eos> Oh, my God, what the hell is this?<eos> You look like you've been going after yourself with a sharpened pencil or something.<eos> Chopstick.
What did I tell you?<eos> You made that look easy -- just like your mum when I delivered you.<eos> I wish she were here now.<eos> She'd be very proud of you, Connie.<eos> And her little grandson.
But these are wonderful days, girls.<eos> Go out there and take hold of them.<eos> You're not GIVEN opportunities.<eos> You GRAB them.<eos> With both hands.
Johnny is waiting for this baby.<eos> And I promise you, he will see it.<eos> Doc?<eos> Nothing's wrong, is it?<eos> Not with Stella?
He has your husband's smile.<eos> He does, doesn't he?<eos> I thought I couldn't bear to be on my own, thought that would be the worst in all this.<eos> But I don't feel alone.<eos> Not with little John.
I saw the bags.<eos> I'm afraid there's quite a lot to tidy away.<eos> Well, luckily that's my forte.<eos> I'm sorry, I can see that this has come as a shock and I expect you'll want some time to discuss this with your... your fiance.<eos> - In the meantime...
I must be.<eos> I don't feel it.<eos> There.<eos> I've waited such a long time to sit beside you looking at a bunch of flowers in a vase.<eos> Under the same roof at last.
Emergency Caesarean section.<eos> Anaesthetist and paediatrician, please.<eos> - As quickly as we can, please.<eos> - Look after her.<eos> Who?
Anaesthetist and paediatrician, please.<eos> - As quickly as we can, please.<eos> - Look after her.<eos> Who?<eos> My little girl.
A pair of old slippers when you should have dancing shoes.<eos> Who else would tell me stories?<eos> Tell me where frankincense came from, or the myrrh oil Christ was washed in.<eos> I'm blessed, Roseanne, with you.<eos> And now our child.
Smashing.<eos> Remind me of what kind of fitting?<eos> Brassiere... Oh.<eos> I'm here for me monthlies.<eos> Monthly what?
- See?<eos> I am nothing if not an incurable romantic. - SHE GIGGLES<eos> That sounds splendid.<eos> On one condition.<eos> What?
Afraid of what other people will think of them.<eos> And I'm afraid of so many things.<eos> But not that.<eos> He smelled of alcohol.<eos> Not beer.
These things do all get rather harder with age.<eos> Where was Jonah born?<eos> In a barge, like the others.<eos> I always liked the quiet, the being on me own...<eos> On your own?
What kind of investigation is this?<eos> Mr. Larrea, I don't care who you are in Bilbao.<eos> Here, you're just a suspect's relative.<eos> - I'll decide what I tell you.<eos> - Suspect? Of what?
Ain't that the truth.<eos> You sure they did it?<eos> People started callin' me half an hour after it happened.<eos> Shameek has always been the spark plug.<eos> And Chico... a follower.
What would have happened in my life if people gave up on me?<eos> I was no angel.<eos> No, I was a beast.<eos> -[man grunting] -[Pop] I was a beast.<eos> No two ways about it.
Across the street from a building named after one of our greatest heroes?<eos> -[gun cocks] -Yeah, a dead one.<eos> [Luke sighs]<eos> You even know who Crispus Attucks was?<eos> A free black man.
- [both grunting] - Get off!<eos> - You got problems with the tax?<eos> - Holler at your man Luke Cage...<eos> - Holler at Luke Cage...<eos> - [all] At the barber shop.
- Shit! - [musicians yelling indistinctly]<eos> [Darnell gasping]<eos> - There's nothing magical about it. - [groaning]<eos> Follow the smoke.<eos> Or the damn garbage truck.
Lot of angles, but not a full composite.<eos> I have a friend down in intel on the task force.<eos> - Maybe she could help. - Ooh! "She"?<eos> - I wanna talk to my mother.<eos> - Your mother?
-[exhales deeply]<eos> -[gasps] -I'm gonna take your boot off.<eos> -[inhales sharply] -I see.<eos> [Candace gasping] [whimpering]<eos> -Your toes? -[groans]
Salute.<eos> [laughs]<eos> You ever see anything like that before?<eos> Harlem, baby.<eos> Harlem.
We were kidnapped, and now we're free.<eos> They're not gonna expect receipts from a bunch of Ecuadorian kidnappers.<eos> - Who did I give the money to? - You didn't.<eos> You were told to leave it under a bridge because you... didn't wanna involve the police, because they told you they'd kill us. So, you just left the money for collection under a bridge.<eos> - What bridge? - "What bridge"?
- I didn't know who she was. - You're serious?<eos> I didn't know she was your wife.<eos> How do you think that makes me feel?<eos> That my wife just... - has it off with anyone? - Hardly.<eos> Just a big phony and a liar and a cheat.
Don't get ahead of yourself.<eos> Get him in there. No!<eos> Who are you?<eos> I was...<eos> Katana Girl.
I would have died in that storm.<eos> Yes.<eos> I'm sorry, but you had to see this.<eos> I followed the tiniest thread, just like my dad taught me.<eos> The smallest butterfly.
And the weapons?<eos> At that range the Sten gun should hit everything within the car.<eos> And the armed escort?<eos> We have found no pattern.<eos> Some days, yes. Some days, no.
- Please.<eos> - Hey, I said it's late.<eos> I like ice cream.<eos> What kind?<eos> Butter pecan.
Are you telling me that we're about to be voted into office, and we have no idea what the fuck we're gonna do?<eos> !<eos> Oh, geez!<eos> I think they called it<eos> "German collective guilt," right?
!<eos> How could someone think these things are bad?<eos> - 'Member Storm Troopers?<eos> - 'Member?<eos> The Commander In Chief Forum, with a Giant Douche and a Turd Sandwich.
I got you this.<eos> - What's this for? - You've to make a speech at the weddin', ...and just with your accent.<eos> I've the same accent as you.<eos> What're you laughin' at?<eos> Nothin'.
And how'd you work that one out'?<eos> I've been with the same chap the past five years.<eos> Who?<eos> Seamus McCrory.<eos> - Who?
- I have a wife.<eos> - Oh.<eos> I knew the first night I met Declan, that he was the one for Charlene.<eos> He was a kind-hearted bloke.<eos> And a nice man.
Hey, it's me.<eos> - Hiya.<eos> - So, listen.<eos> I was thinking it could be good for us to meet John Carter before the weddin'.<eos> Who?
- Hiya.<eos> - So, listen.<eos> I was thinking it could be good for us to meet John Carter before the weddin'.<eos> Who?<eos> Your boyfriend.
I think you were right about me and Charlene.<eos> You're probably right about a lot of things.<eos> I miss you.<eos> Me and her were the best.<eos> The most beautiful.
And you must switch your phone off.<eos> She was so sweet, so fragile.<eos> She didn't have money to pay, so I let her use it for free.<eos> Which computer did she use?<eos> That one.
Xavier, I'm talking to you.<eos> You all right?<eos> I juggle with my job to see him but it's as if I didn't exist. - Did you speak to him?<eos> - Sure.<eos> Like a normal person?
- How old are you, Mr Chambers?<eos> Is this one of her jokes?<eos> - Where is she?<eos> - She went to get the photographs.<eos> - What photographs?
- Then when her dad found us...<eos> - Did you fancy her?<eos> - Maybe you were just friends.<eos> - We were.<eos> Good friends.
Yes.<eos> No.<eos> Sorry.<eos> I always thought he was a kind man.<eos> Very courteous.
I'm just looking for Chloe.<eos> Did you check the back of the boy's utes? - Mom!<eos> You said that she was with Anna?<eos> Yeah<eos> Anna Macy?
I don't know ...<eos> I'm asking you<eos> She was with ... Roy's daughter.<eos> What's her name?<eos> Anna?
It's amazing what exercise will do for you.<eos> Do you do it?<eos> Kayak.<eos> Exercise.<eos> Only caution.
Deb. Do you know where the search base is?<eos> Can I get a lift up the mountain, please?<eos> All the cars are full.<eos> They're looking up at the Kettering Forest, aren't they?<eos> Same as with Gillian.
Right, I got done doing a 15 yo that looked 20 and me doing time is exactly why I didn't go near her.<eos> Still trying to clean up.<eos> - Sure you are<eos> You were up at the party on Friday night.<eos> - With me mates
This town worships you, Roy.<eos> You're their local hero<eos> Be terrible for your ... shiny and carefully managed reputation, if this got out.<eos> Wouldn't it?<eos> Especially on a night like tonight
The sort of cop that's entwined in the life of the community<eos> Men and women in the force, who make themselves integral -- to the lives of the people in their district<eos> That not only enforce the laws of the land, but involve themselves with the local footy team, fight the fires, drive the tractor at fetes.<eos> To be a county cop, you need to be a friend, a confidant and a councilor.<eos> A mentor.
- They ruined our fucking livelihoods!<eos> Pissed you off didn't they.<eos> Seeing Chloe up there at the party.<eos> Thumbing it at her dad.<eos> At you blokes.
- I ain't asking you again.<eos> - You like this!<eos> You would rather be on death's door than with Naomi and William.<eos> No, death and killing have been your only wives.<eos> Your only family.
We'll be moving on in the morning, Mr. Bohannon.<eos> I suggest you do the same.<eos> Welcome home, Mr. Durant.<eos> Home?<eos> Laramie?
Didn't you learn anything in school?<eos> I didn't go to school.<eos> The marriage of the mighty Union Pacific and the significantly less mighty Central Pacific Railroad Companies connecting at last the east and west of this great nation.<eos> Let that be a history lesson...<eos> Free of charge.
You say Campbell will pay.<eos> We just have to make that his only option.<eos> You all right?<eos> Marty was a good man.<eos> A friend.
We ride on horseback to an abandoned depot a few miles north, at the end of a defunct spur.<eos> After a time, maybe half a day, we moved again.<eos> I liked Miss Palmer.<eos> She was a good woman.<eos> A good businesswoman.
Morito, Secretary to the Chief Cabinet Secretary Without proof it's radioactive, we might end up stoking public fear unnecessarily.<eos> It's not enough of a spike to warrant evacuation.<eos> There are no legal grounds to it.<eos> It's still a matter of radioactivity.<eos> The sooner, the better.
Yeah.<eos> He just left Yokota Air Base.<eos> Foreign Ministry's in a uproar.<eos> I hear his aide made an appointment with you.<eos> With me?
Why?<eos> Kayoco Anne-Patterson, Special Presidential Envoy<eos> I read your administrations reports.<eos> I need a person I can work with.<eos> With an interesting history.
However, as army experts will remain as the backbone of the government.<eos> We have to respectfully decline your offer to remain at the center of decision-making.<eos> In place of that, we will...<eos> A US-Japan Gojira research coalition?<eos> The more knowledge, the better.
With a body like Gojira's... old radioactive waste must leave it hungry.<eos> No doubt.<eos> Crooked teeth.<eos> It can't even prey on nuclear waste.<eos> Origami.
I had to keep the world satisfied.<eos> Now Japan... no.<eos> Mankind, must coexist with Gojira.<eos> You shared the data with France.<eos> With France and the whole world.
- It's the truth!<eos> Then why were you stealing from him?<eos> The money... was just to get away,<eos> - start a new life.<eos> - With who?
What about tattoo lady?<eos> Unfortunately, there was no foreign DNA on her skin or under her fingernails.<eos> The two stab wounds were made with a double-edged blade, though the murder weapon was rather dull.<eos> And the blows were delivered with a great deal of force.<eos> - So, a man?
Unfortunately, there was no foreign DNA on her skin or under her fingernails.<eos> The two stab wounds were made with a double-edged blade, though the murder weapon was rather dull.<eos> And the blows were delivered with a great deal of force.<eos> - So, a man?<eos> - Or a very strong woman.
- Yeah?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Uniforms showing it to the neighborhood?<eos> And they just found someone who thinks the shooter lives in a nearby building with his mother.<eos> - With his mother?
And maybe you should talk to my ass!<eos> I don't like having a door slammed in my face.<eos> She is hiding something.<eos> - She was working.<eos> - On a naked man.
Me too, kid.<eos> Me too.<eos> Hi.<eos> How you doing?<eos> In a word ... feverish.
- He's coming, too.<eos> - Do you really need it?<eos> - Um, it just seems a little dead.<eos> - He's not dead.<eos> Dead-ish.
Well, thank you very much for having me.<eos> First and foremost, we should all extend our prayers to the Simpson family.<eos> You saw him?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Sunday night, about, uh, 10:45.
I did a press conference, then I filled the gas tank.<eos> Bob, they found him.<eos> O.J. is driving up and down the freeways with a police escort.<eos> He's still alive?<eos> ...in front of him.
But it doesn't matter... we got plenty.<eos> Uh, tell me about the Bahamas.<eos> Well, the couple on the island heard talk about a chartered yacht.<eos> The crew was expecting O.J. on the 18th.<eos> - The day after the Bronco?
What is he doing?<eos> No idea.<eos> I never run into Tommy D since we moved out to Simi Valley.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Simi.
Mr. Cochran has moved the court to disrupt our schedule because you threatened to leave the country, since you're being hounded by the press.<eos> I stay just for today for Mr. Johnnie.<eos> Tomorrow, I fly.<eos> So when did you make this flight reservation for El Salvador?<eos> This morning.
There's something on the TV.<eos> I think you better see it.<eos> Can't you record it?<eos> Johnnie, Barbara is on A Current Affair.<eos> With Patricia.
Riders approaching!<eos> Open the gate!<eos> This is good soup.<eos> Do you remember those kidney pies Old Nan used to make?<eos> - With the peas and onions?
And one day you walked through a graveyard and realized it was all for nothing and set out on the path to righteousness.<eos> Book of the Stranger, verse 25.<eos> You know "The Seven-Pointed Star."<eos> Septa Unella reads it to me.<eos> At me.
The High Sparrow has no respect for kings or queens.<eos> No respect for anything in this world.<eos> He has no use for the things of this world.<eos> He wants to knock them down and replace them with what?<eos> With fantasies.
He has no use for the things of this world.<eos> He wants to knock them down and replace them with what?<eos> With fantasies.<eos> With beggars in the street.<eos> With nothing.
Sansa.<eos> Lady Brienne.<eos> When I heard you had escaped Winterfell, I feared the worst.<eos> You have no idea how happy I am to see you unharmed.<eos> Unharmed?
A girl has been given a second chance.<eos> There will not be a third.<eos> One way or another, a face will be added to the hall.<eos> Oh, murdered by a boar.<eos> The great big hairy whore.
Ride for Riverrun.<eos> My uncle will talk to you and you'll know how to talk to him.<eos> What is it?<eos> I don't like leaving you here alone.<eos> With Jon?
I was afraid he'd turn you and Little Sam away.<eos> I'm not angry at you.<eos> I'm angry that horrible people can treat good people that way and get away with it.<eos> When do you have to go?<eos> First light.
She stood before the gods in the holy sept and lied.<eos> She turned a blind eye to her brother's sins.<eos> She disgraced her house, her king, and herself.<eos> Company, halt!<eos> Face front!
The Three-Eyed Raven sent for me.<eos> The Three-Eyed Raven's dead.<eos> Now he lives again.<eos> When I last saw you, you were a boy.<eos> A fearless boy.
Of course.<eos> The king mentioned that since your reunion, you haven't joined him in the marriage bed.<eos> No.<eos> You have a duty, Your Grace.<eos> To your husband, your king, your country, to the gods themselves.
We didn't know you were coming.<eos> 'Cause you didn't set a proper perimeter. You just allowed 8,000 men to approach unchallenged.<eos> Good thing we're friends or we'd be fucking you in the ass right now.<eos> Have Lord Edmure bathed and fed.<eos> Whoa, whoa.
I've come for the Blackfish.<eos> You're welcome to have him.<eos> Lady Sansa desires to take her ancestral seat back from the Boltons and assume her rightful position as Lady of Winterfell.<eos> With what army does she plan on taking Winterfell?<eos> The Tully army.
Oh, that means Amberle's...<eos> We have to assume that she's been misled.<eos> Tell me, if a force was small enough, could it reach the Henge undetected?<eos> Even if we got there, it's surrounded by magic.<eos> Dark magic.
The Druid trained me in the ways of the Order.<eos> He gave me purpose and control.<eos> And now it is my turn to do the same.<eos> I believe you to be the next Druid, Bandon.<eos> A Druid?
Then why stay?<eos> I was tired of running.<eos> And I saw a future here.<eos> One that could be negotiated.<eos> With the Trolls?
Yeah, I want to lead my own life.<eos> You won't have a life if we don't get to Safehold.<eos> None of us will.<eos> What's wrong with you?<eos> With me?
I was in this just to earn some coin.<eos> No, you weren't.<eos> Eretria...<eos> You came here for the map.<eos> Not for me.
No, you weren't.<eos> Eretria...<eos> You came here for the map.<eos> Not for me.<eos> What map?
With it, we can send this demon horde back to the Forbidding.<eos> For this to happen, we must buy them time.<eos> We must hold this line... and defend the Ellcrys at all costs.<eos> I know we can win this war because I have stood alongside your King Eventine and, as fate would have it, I now stand alongside his son,<eos> King Ander.
Oscar, guess who I just saw walking into the lobby with a suitcase, possibly returning to her husband Frank?<eos> Not a whole lot left to guess there.<eos> You did this.<eos> I may have dropped a little advice on Frank.<eos> Along with a... barbell.
Aren't we all henchmen?<eos> "Aren't we all henchmen?" What the fuck does that mean?<eos> Are you high right now?<eos> Are you on drugs?<eos> Drugs?
When he was with us.<eos> He was just like you.<eos> Like me?<eos> Yes.<eos> Strong and clever and funny and, oh, so handsome.
We listen to their tales and guide their safe return to the blissful pure land.<eos> Really?<eos> Did you speak to someone?<eos> Yes, I did.<eos> My husband.
Cursed... or "cur-sed."<eos> No comrades, no master.<eos> Not even a name or a single memory of the noble warrior I once was.<eos> You used to be a man?<eos> No, not just any man.
Of course not.<eos> We're having a grown up conversation.<eos> You're going to fight again.<eos> Kubo, just go over there and play with something.<eos> Not that!
That's how your story goes.<eos> Oh, kubo.<eos> When you're up there with me, you will be beyond stories.<eos> You will be...<eos> Immortal!
Immortal!<eos> You will be... Infinite!<eos> No.<eos> You're wrong.<eos> Not infinite.
For every horrible thing down here, there's something far more beautiful.<eos> My mother saw it.<eos> So did my father.<eos> I see it.<eos> Even with just one eye.
Sure, yeah, I could go for that.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> So to what do I owe this pleasure?<eos> Well, Corrado just wanted to touch base about this little visit that you had.<eos> From the cop.
Can stop.<eos> Okay.<eos> Physical go forward.<eos> But work also to your institution.<eos> Institution?
Probably ie cases.<eos> The result of the autopsy is still inside.<eos> You coffee?<eos> I have seen a bear.<eos> - You, at night in the snow.
80 percent of the pilots is in the army.<eos> Why this choice?<eos> I was on my 17th already become a pilot.<eos> It was like a sore thumb.<eos> Combat Pilot?
You're right here.<eos> I decide where is.<eos> Are you coming?<eos> We are going through.<eos> - Not with the rain.
You must be more his type.<eos> Has he tried to get hold of you?<eos> - Nobody arrested me.<eos> Never forget that.<eos> No, after the first tunnel straight.
- Yes. Ofiets...<eos> In the spirit of that great tomb.<eos> - No, the simple grave.<eos> If you see there...<eos> - The pink marble?
And neither are you, Byamba.<eos> You might be born of a concubine, but never disparage, or hide from your mother's blood.<eos> You never speak of her.<eos> She was Javanese.<eos> Very, very tall.
My gift to you on our own wedding day.<eos> Any man who rises to greatness will face envy from his brothers, his relations.<eos> You stand above them all, because you know compassion is the greatest shield.<eos> Have compassion for these smaller men...<eos> smaller minds.
Who did this?<eos> I did. You don't approve?<eos> As you know, I didn't think I needed an avatar. You did.<eos> Why not my creator?<eos> Why not my creator?
I did. You don't approve?<eos> As you know, I didn't think I needed an avatar. You did.<eos> Why not my creator?<eos> Why not my creator?<eos> Why not my creator?
Dennis.<eos> You okay, dude?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Who you talking to?<eos> No one.
Look, you need to get on with your life, man.<eos> That's what your daughter would've wanted.<eos> She wasn't my daughter.<eos> She was the love of my life.<eos> My sun, my moon, my dusk, my dawn.
What is with the doorbell?<eos> Somebody dying?<eos> We have a petition for you to sign.<eos> We are collecting signatures to force the police to do something about the noise.<eos> What noise?
A kid?<eos> Sure.<eos> That'd be great, and we should have a party, a... a welcome home party.<eos> Right?<eos> The whole family.
Jesus Christ.<eos> He's your brother-in-law.<eos> Tell Esme to speak to him about it.<eos> Before I start... .. I don't want you to do anything about this.<eos> About what?
He's your brother-in-law.<eos> Tell Esme to speak to him about it.<eos> Before I start... .. I don't want you to do anything about this.<eos> About what?<eos> Vicente Changretta's son.
Who?<eos> God or the King?<eos> Sometimes both, Mr Shelby.<eos> Mm. So, you met my niece already.<eos> Tatiana.
They'll have passenger lists.<eos> They can get you into the point of departure.<eos> You pick him up, and you bring him to me.<eos> Who's he got travelling with him?<eos> - His wife.
You pick him up, and you bring him to me.<eos> Who's he got travelling with him?<eos> - His wife.<eos> - What?<eos> His wife.
We need you to know...<eos> Who the fuck wants to buy 27 stolen armoured cars?<eos> - A foolish man.<eos> - And how much is this "foolish man" paying?<eos> 150,000 -- cash, diamonds and sapphires.
Sapphires.<eos> They're just a currency.<eos> Well, you know, if it was me who had all them jewels... .. I think I'd just sit with them... .. look at them... .. touch 'em.<eos> Izabella does that sometimes.<eos> Late at night.
Hello?<eos> Ada?<eos> It's me, it's Tommy.<eos> Ada, I need you to.... I need you to speak to one of your comrades and get me a meeting with someone from the Soviet Embassy... Embassy...<eos> Tonight. Your place.
Tommy has a plan.<eos> Arthur.<eos> Arthur.<eos> Arthur, come here.<eos> Shalom!
Arthur, come here.<eos> Shalom!<eos> Arthur, shalom!<eos> Alfie.<eos> Shalom.
I wasn't scared.<eos> No?<eos> What did you feel?<eos> I felt alive.<eos> Intensely alive.
Whoa!<eos> Uh...<eos> But-But I-I hope I'm not intruding.<eos> I-I just got back in town, and... thought it'd be rude not to say hello to an old friend.<eos> An old friend?
Have you killed a lot of people?<eos> I kill all kind of folks.<eos> Just about every way you can.<eos> Rich, poor, guilty, innocent.<eos> By hand, by blade, by gun.
What a shame.<eos> You held such promise.<eos> Victor said he recognized Jim Gordon.<eos> Said he was with a boy.<eos> Bruce Wayne.
If he had listened?<eos> Then he wouldn't have been the man he was.<eos> True.<eos> But he wouldn't be dead, either.<eos> Along with your mother.
So, how do you feel now?<eos> Not good.<eos> Can you be more specific?<eos> I feel vulnerable.<eos> Naked.
Sorry, 13.<eos> Let's go.<eos> You're messing with the wrong woman!<eos> You hear me?<eos> The wrong woman!
- All right, just finish taking off your totally ineffective biohazard suits and have a little rest.<eos> - Nonsense, Santiago.<eos> We just have to buckle down and work harder.<eos> We simply hit a bump in the road.<eos> - More like a mump in the road.
How did I not know any of this stuff?<eos> - Well, because you were a kid, and kids don't actually know a lot about their parents.<eos> Jake, I've dated a lot of men in the last 20 years.<eos> - You have?<eos> - A lot.
You're kidding.<eos> He's a world-renowned oboist, first chair with the New York Symphony Orchestra.<eos> Kevin and I are huge fans of Weichselbraun's work.<eos> We are what the Internet sometimes refers to as... Weichselbraun fans.<eos> Not Weichselbrauniacs?
To thank you for all you did, bringing down a drug ring, we have a little present for you:<eos> brand-new, top-of-the-line desk chairs, extra padding, with adjustable height and recline.<eos> Hey, chair!<eos> Get ready to meet your new best friend:<eos> my ass.
He's at the entrance by 7th Street.<eos> I used to hang out there all the time.<eos> Doing what?<eos> Aw! I boofed it.<eos> Nothing.
I used to hang out there all the time.<eos> Doing what?<eos> Aw! I boofed it.<eos> Nothing.<eos> Cool stuff.
Yep.<eos> Jake, can I talk to you about my wedding for a second?<eos> Need help choosing a dress?<eos> Big puffy bow in the back, can't go wrong.<eos> No to all of that.
Count me in as long as I get eight plus-ones.<eos> Guys, focus.<eos> We need to start planning.<eos> So when's the wedding?<eos> Next summer, next fall, next winter?
The important thing is, you agreed we can go and you and Pimento are best friends now.<eos> Let's do it!<eos> All right, who's up first?<eos> Party number one will be brought to you by Gina Linetti.<eos> And good times.
Guilty as charged.<eos> My favorite season has to be the third one.<eos> Everything was going right for Carrie.<eos> Her face was on every bus, her column was the talk of the town, and she met everyone's favorite furniture maker,<eos> Aidan Shaw.
There's Samantha again.<eos> Whoo-hoo-hoo! We did it! What?<eos> I'm only human.<eos> You can't always expect me to be the coolest guy ever.<eos> Coolest guy ever?
Could be because you're in prison for murder. - Nah.<eos> That's not it.<eos> - Yeah, that's not it.<eos> Before this, I used to date all my brother's friends from the mob.<eos> All dogs too.
I once had a fleet of that makeup.<eos> I came looking for Flint, not you.<eos> Where is he?<eos> He's currently being pummeled by half the British navy just beyond the horizon.<eos> The navy?
I mean...<eos> Do you know what I mean?<eos> It's really beautiful, Abbie.<eos> Do you want to fool around...<eos> with me?
[Jamie voiceover] Women's sexuality, defined by men to benefit men, has been downgraded and perverted, repressed and channeled.<eos> Anatomically, all orgasms are centered in the clitoris, whether they result from direct manual pressure applied to the clitoris, indirect pressure resulting from...<eos> Last night, I fucked Heather so hard, she came like, three times.<eos> How did you stimulate her clitoris?<eos> With my dick.
Is there any wedding stuff going on tonight?<eos> Uh, nope.<eos> You're in the clear till tomorrow.<eos> Why? Gonna watch the DePaul game with Luther tonight.<eos> Luther?
Uh, 200 each.<eos> - Four?<eos> - Right, four.<eos> Cash or credit?<eos> Uh, Visa.
Wait there.<eos> Nikolai, you're wanted.<eos> Come on.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> - Cousins?
Lord, this fire is not gonna kill me.<eos> It may knock me down, oh, but I'll get back up and I'll be stronger than ever.<eos> Thank you for bringing me Neal Gamby and Lee Russell.<eos> Oh, help us. Lord, help us do good things together.<eos> - In Jesus' name...
It's not like he followed you in there.<eos> He said he saw me in the parking lot and followed me in.<eos> Did you get a new haircut?<eos> Yes. I did.<eos> With a friend.
No, no.<eos> I was quite a mess.<eos> Well, Janelle is going through her own little messy stage right now too.<eos> She's gotten into motocross.<eos> - Motocross? - Yeah.
Bengü!<eos> Come. Come, girl.<eos> She was one of four kittens.<eos> She was the scrawniest one.<eos> And the ugliest.
They just killed me off the show.<eos> - What?<eos> They did? - Yeah, they did.<eos> - Oh, God, I'm sorry.<eos> - Bummer.
I believe Mr Roper took Mr Hamid to dinner on his yacht, sir.<eos> I'm sorry, there's a bit of a big party going on here.<eos> I couldn't quite hear you, could you repeat that, please?<eos> Mr Hamid is with Mr Roper.<eos> - Mr Roper? - Yes, sir.
Please, just tell me. I would understand.<eos> I just need to know.<eos> Freddie Hamid was just here.<eos> He said he had just spoken to the man from Ironlast.<eos> Which man?
Open the room. Go. We go.<eos> Sir...<eos> Where is she?<eos> When did you last see her?<eos> Er, last night.
Sophie?<eos> No!<eos> She was a guest at the hotel.<eos> I think she was connected to Freddie Hamid.<eos> Who?
I'm the night manager.<eos> I do hope your journey wasn't too ghastly.<eos> So, where's old Meister?<eos> Tucked up in bed, is he, with an Ovaltine?<eos> Or German porn?
I've never heard of such a name.<eos> Then how did you get hold of those certificates?<eos> They're classified documents.<eos> An angel gave them to me.<eos> With a halo.
You killed him, I suppose.<eos> To save your own skin.<eos> Yes?<eos> He was a good man, Corks.<eos> Loyal man.
Now he is lying in a ditch on a Turkish mountain because of you.<eos> Well, for his sake and for mine,<eos> I can promise you that your death is going to be a hundred times worse.<eos> Who are you working with?<eos> No one.
All right, darling.<eos> Frisky, Major Corkoran is here with some friends of Dorothy that I would like to have escorted from the premises.<eos> You and Tabby can make as much noise as you like.<eos> All right?<eos> A pleasure.
It's 11 o'clock.<eos> We're having a business meeting, darling.<eos> I thought I told you.<eos> A business meeting with Thomas?<eos> Not Thomas.
We're having a business meeting, darling.<eos> I thought I told you.<eos> A business meeting with Thomas?<eos> Not Thomas.<eos> Andrew.
Is it you?<eos> Listen, I really want to keep this between you and me.<eos> Why don't you start by just telling me the truth?<eos> What did you do with the list?<eos> What list?
I needed money, so I decided to return to modelling.<eos> While I waited for offers,<eos> I slept all day and walked all night, brainstorming about my future.<eos> This was when I met Antoine, a beautiful person.<eos> Beautiful and sad.
What about potential targets in town yesterday?<eos> They sent Eli out to get someone.<eos> Me and Denny looked into it, but there wasn't anyone within five miles of that power plant.<eos> Hey, I think I found a link between the shootings of Congressman Hill and that journalist in Virginia.<eos> Jeff Brooks, right?
I was able to access your father's travel log.<eos> He was in Megiddo when Jennings died.<eos> Why?<eos> The excavation was run by...<eos> Carl Bugenhagen, a renowned biblical scholar.
Where were you going?<eos> I'd really like to help you, but I just don't know anything.<eos> See, here's what I'm struggling with.<eos> In the last few days, you've been in very close proximity to a few, uh... oh, I don't know, what do I call 'em?<eos> Unexplained deaths?
So I keep my eyes on you.<eos> Person of interest.<eos> And I keep you here all night for questioning, kick you free when you're exhausted, and then bring you back tomorrow... and the next night, and all next week.<eos> After a while, you've got a shadow.<eos> Always right over your shoulder.
Are you threatening me?<eos> People who come after me, they don't fare so well.<eos> You've seen enough to know.<eos> Very weird stuff happens around me.<eos> Not to me.
You've seen enough to know.<eos> Very weird stuff happens around me.<eos> Not to me.<eos> Never to me.<eos> To others.
I have to celebrate.<eos> There any good bars around here?<eos> Wait, I... hey.<eos> In the last few days, you've been in close proximity to a number of...<eos> unexplained deaths?
Very little, so far.<eos> You need to purify yourself, listen to your conscience.<eos> Look at yourself.<eos> Ask yourself, are you content with yourself?<eos> With your life?
Our oldest allies.<eos> They've only betrayed us four times in the last three years, but now they're supposed to be the solution to the eternal...<eos> Stop talking politics to me, Bilibin, I can't bear it.<eos> Just introduce me to your little friend and make yourself scarce, hmm?<eos> Drubetskoy?
'Look at yourself.'<eos> Sic transit gloria mundi!<eos> 'Ask yourself...'<eos> '..are you content with yourself?<eos> 'With your life?
Sound the advance.<eos> This breach of our treaty cannot and will not be endured.<eos> Hear, hear!<eos> I will not make peace with that man unless he withdraws every one of his soldiers from Russian soil!<eos> Drubetskoy.
Yes, it is.<eos> Ah, Prince Andrei!<eos> Welcome back, Your Grace.<eos> I'm delighted to be under<eos> - your command again.
Here. (COUGHS)<eos> You have one of these, and don't say I don't treat you kind 'cause I do.<eos> You'd share it with me?<eos> Yeah, I would. Why not?<eos> And her, too.
I love you, and now there's no one for me.<eos> But I will remember you.<eos> But not like this.<eos> (sonny Yes.<eos> Yes, like this.
Tell me more!<eos> - Details!<eos> - White guy! Baseball cap!<eos> Yankees, maybe.<eos> Beard.
- Yeah?<eos> This trophy, it belongs to Kenneth Allen.<eos> I saw a bunch of these behind his desk.<eos> One was missing.<eos> This one.
Not once in 25 years.<eos> Carrie... he knows Allen.<eos> They were in school together.<eos> What's your relationship to Kenneth Allen?<eos> Ken Allen?
It would only be corporate espionage if we had signed one of your ironclad nondisclosure agreements when we came to your office, but...<eos> Since we didn't, if Carrie mentioned it to her, it would just be, I don't know, pillow talk. What do you want?<eos> I want to go in.<eos> Undercover. - What?<eos> - What? What?
I took the pictures.<eos> I dropped them off, just sending a friendly message to stay away, but that's it.<eos> You say the guy got shot this morning?<eos> I was with a friend.<eos> - Monique?
Where's the general?<eos> You don't understand.<eos> I don't know, sir.<eos> He sent me for the maps so that we could trace the route of the artillery supplies, then he just rode off with someone.<eos> A soldier?
Louis was blessed to escape your father's illness.<eos> Louis was always blessed.<eos> His mother was Marie de Medici.<eos> My mother was a chamber maid.<eos> Well, not exactly a chamber maid.
We wait until dark.<eos> If we can keep the children hidden until then, we stand a chance.<eos> D'Artagnan.<eos> Was Aramis really one of you?<eos> A Musketeer?
Now you... seem to be showing me another path.<eos> In the middle of all the danger and excitement today, you were closer to me than at any time in all my years here.<eos> I've never felt so... alive.<eos> This is what you made me.<eos> A Musketeer.
Yes, you will, darling.<eos> Time to write my own fucking story.<eos> I feel like I've been here before.<eos> We're close.<eos> Close to what?
Time to write my own fucking story.<eos> I feel like I've been here before.<eos> We're close.<eos> Close to what?<eos> Home.
It's a disappointing end to her story, isn't it?<eos> I knew Theresa well.<eos> If she had any faults, a lack of loyalty wasn't one of them.<eos> She was loyal.<eos> And careful.
She out?<eos> Good.<eos> Let's brick this bitch and get out of here.<eos> The greatest shame in life is to perish without purpose, which is why I always consume my victims fresh.<eos> Moist.
I hear she was smuggling secrets.<eos> Theresa wasn't a traitor.<eos> Everything she did was at Delos's behest.<eos> She slipped and fell while helping the board with something very important.<eos> What?
Lifelike, but not alive?<eos> Pain only exists in the mind.<eos> It's always imagined.<eos> So what's the difference between my pain and yours?<eos> Between you and me?
I loved Zagnut bars, and my sister Ellen loved Baby Ruth bars.<eos> My brother Tuggah loved everything.<eos> I don't love Halloween anymore.<eos> It was the night my mom, my brother, and my sister was murdered...<eos> With a hammer.
You look at him, you think "that's a good man."<eos> Yeah.<eos> Perfect.<eos> Cash or credit, sir?<eos> Oh, uh, cash.
Um, sorry. Before we move on. I'd like to go back to client outreach, just for a moment.<eos> Looking over these numbers, here. Really astonishing results, Jimmy.<eos> Incredible.<eos> Your last trip to Amarillo, you came back with 22 new clients?<eos> Twenty-four.

I'm just trying to offer complete information, here.<eos> Now, this one airing, it was an experiment and as such, by any measure...<eos> - ...a success. - You keep saying experiment like you're the goddamned Wright Brothers.<eos> When were you going to tell us about this experiment?<eos> Today. This morning.
Your Honor, the defense has made the very reasonable request that the plaintiffs produce their medical records, or barring that, a signed HIPAA release so that we can examine the records ourselves.<eos> Your Honor, our clients' medical records have no bearing on the merits of this case.<eos> The medical records are plainly relevant as they bear directly on our contention that the plaintiffs are not adequate class representatives.<eos> This is a transparent attempt at intimidation, nothing more.<eos> How so?
Thing's practically a computer.<eos> It's like a goddamn space shuttle.<eos> It's got like, double-sided printing, automatic stapling, you know?<eos> Met some nice folks.<eos> Guys and gals.

With everything that's happened with Enron and WorldCom, the government is extra vigilant.<eos> These days, the penalties for even the most honest of errors can be devastating.<eos> You need a sharp, young eye to catch that stuff.<eos> I mean, when you've specialized in this kind of work for decades on end, you tend to get kinda...<eos> - Stale.

I'll get to close my eyes on the journey back to the palace.<eos> But, I appreciate your concern.<eos> I ken.<eos> I reek of smoke.<eos> Mm, and cheap perfume.
- Aye.<eos> - What key?<eos> The musical key.<eos> Whoever wrote this had a diabolical sense of humor.<eos> Oh, aye, diabolical.
He is badly wounded, and the British ambassador begged for him to be allowed to recover from his injuries in England.<eos> So Jack Randall was still alive.<eos> The cat with nine lives.<eos> And thus, so was Frank.<eos> But at what cost?
What is the matter with you?<eos> Have ye got shite in your ears?<eos> Attention!<eos> Pay attention to me.<eos> File left.
Sorry for bringing you here.<eos> I want you to know, whatever happens, we're gonna get through this.<eos> I'll make sure you're safe.<eos> I'm fine, Jamie... really.<eos> About face.

Take this man in the direction he says the camp lies.<eos> If the information he gave us proves true, tie him to a tree one mile from the camp.<eos> His friends will find him there tomorrow.<eos> If what he told us is not true... Then cut his throat.<eos> Gladly.
You're playing games with me, Frank.<eos> I don't like games.<eos> You know what I like? This sandwich.<eos> It's snake meat.<eos> Snake meat?
You know what I like? This sandwich.<eos> It's snake meat.<eos> Snake meat?<eos> Huh. Is that what you people eat?<eos> Yeah, snake meat.
Would you say...<eos> Uh, you know what, I'll say it, if it's gonna help you get out of here and go to your Bible study.<eos> Oh, you don't have to mean it. Yeah, you just have to say it.<eos> Okay.<eos> And also with you.
Keep up. You know what? It's all right, it's okay.<eos> Guys, let's just... let's stop fighting, okay?<eos> No more confessions, no more tattling on each other, all right?<eos> Look, guys, let's just try to enjoy these last moments we've got together.<eos> Okay? Or these last hours.
I don't know how it happened, but I try to remain equidistant. And I feel uncomfortable when I'm being told what to believe.<eos> Maybe I'm wrong, I said to myself.<eos> But then I thought how almost the same thing happened to Galileo.<eos> Lulu...<eos> And not only to him.
You have no idea how happy people were with the low-rent housing the Party gave them.<eos> Really?<eos> -Yes!<eos> And we happily attended the May Day parade!<eos> Happily!
What do you want me to do?<eos> Beat her?<eos> Is she on drugs?<eos> -Who?<eos> Cami.
Do you have a sewing machine?<eos> What for? -Listen! I want to do this, and everytime I insert the needle...<eos> Just leave them like I put them.<eos> But a sewing machine would be just perfect. Leave them like that, with two tucks.<eos> With safety pins.
Keep it down, please, you'll wake my kid!<eos> You wanted him in.<eos> Easy with the threats! -What threats?<eos> She's my daughter!<eos> All the more so!
You were...<eos> I was fucking him.<eos> Where are you going?<eos> To inform the captain of the Gloucestershire he's about to head home.<eos> Plus one passenger.
I was distraught.<eos> I wept.<eos> But with you... I'm ruined over you.<eos> When I first met you, you were so...<eos> Unformed.
Who are you?<eos> My name is Ben Gunn.<eos> I'm the last of 13 crewmen on a slave trader captured whilst careening on the windward side of the island.<eos> I've learned 12 hard lessons from that woman.<eos> Each with the same end.
With Nassau gone, they've lost a vital supply line.<eos> We would go out on the account... hunt for them, using this place as a hidden base for operations.<eos> However, he acknowledged that he lacks the ability to ratify any such arrangement.<eos> He has authority here, but he doesn't have the final word.<eos> The queen.
They turned when they thought I was gone.<eos> So I will come back from the dead and lay claim to what I am owed.<eos> Let's say that by some miracle we could dislodge the British from Nassau.<eos> I could not possibly hope to defend it with my numbers.<eos> Your numbers?
- It has something to do with medicine...<eos> - I cannot look weak.<eos> I cannot feel weak.<eos> I cannot be weak.<eos> Not in front of my men. Not in front of your men. Not at all.
I'm gonna need you to do it.<eos> Your timing is off.<eos> I'm gonna get you well.<eos> I'm gonna bring you blood. As much as you need.<eos> Not human blood.
Is that why you've been acting out and killing those people?<eos> I had no idea that my business was dead.<eos> Oh, it's not dead. It's dying.<eos> Well, what have they done with it?<eos> Factories?
(LAUGHS) Better now that I'm talking with you.<eos> NED: Just give me the number.<eos> I'm calling him now.<eos> Let's catch some waves.<eos> - VIDEO GAME GORILLA:
He kind of reminds me of you.<eos> What?<eos> - Me?<eos> - Yes. Okay, I need you to explain that one.<eos> How?
I really don't feel like ironing while I'm on this trip.<eos> (GROANS) I'm so exhausted.<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> Take it off, baby.<eos> Yeah!
- NED:<eos> No. - We're doing it already.<eos> - We're doing it right now.<eos> - Barb! I'm doing it with my feet.<eos> One foot.
That is, that is a girl's name, right?<eos> (knocking in secret code) Piss off.<eos> Welcome back.<eos> How long ago was he shot?<eos> Yesterday afternoon.
- Kangols are a type of hat.<eos> - Okay.<eos> See?<eos> - If it's all right with you, I'd like to talk to Claire privately for a few minutes.<eos> - Oh, yeah, a bit-- a bit of girl chat.
This is about Claire and her sexual orientation.<eos> I think I have a book.<eos> - There's--there's books?<eos> - People have been unattracted to you for thousands of years.<eos> - Thousands?
I love another Scotch. Yeah. Sure.<eos> To my one regret in life that I can't play an instrument.<eos> I knew a sedated musician. Oh!<eos> Did you?<eos> Yeah. Sax player, very brilliant.
I learned too late grinding late with a few drinks.<eos> So what do you... what do you do?<eos> I work at the City Hall at the Mayor's Office.<eos> Really... in what?<eos> Public relations.
Happy New Year!<eos> Happy New Year to you. I love you.<eos> Happy New Year to you too.<eos> I love you.<eos> Happy New Year.
And the murder of Joseph Brawley.<eos> I'm bleeding.<eos> What?<eos> I'll talk to Stella.<eos> No-one else.
You'd taken your clothes off, David.<eos> "You were naked, weren't you?"<eos> "Yes."<eos> "So what did you use to strangle her?"<eos> "Just my hands, just my bare hands."
He really seemed to lack detailed knowledge.<eos> I have a good feeling about this.<eos> I can smell Spector's involvement.<eos> And when do you see Alvarez?<eos> In the morning.
He's happy for you to represent the Met, and he said he'll back us if we reopen the Alvarez investigation.<eos> That's great news.<eos> We're seeing Spector tomorrow to put the new evidence from the lock-up to him.<eos> When are you back?<eos> First thing.
My mistake.<eos> Boy, ten years I tied myself to that jackass.<eos> You know I put off taking the sergeant's exam so I wouldn't leave Carl behind?<eos> Who knows where I'd be if I never met him, you know?<eos> Sergeant?

I'd be happy to give you a tour of the facilities if you'd like.<eos> I'd actually like to meet with Dr. Cheng and Dr. ziegler.<eos> Absolutely.<eos> They're eager to meet you.<eos> And Kathy grieff.
Kathy...<eos> I haven't checked in on her today, but...<eos> As soon as you do, let her know I'd like to see her.<eos> -Of course.<eos> -And Morgan.
OK.<eos> Why do you want to be a detective?<eos> It's what I've always wanted.<eos> You did the detective course at Hendon.<eos> Top of the class.
I'm out.<eos> No, no, no. Tiana, I said temporary.<eos> It's just temporary, baby.<eos> Would it make a difference if I started sleeping with him again?<eos> Who?
No, no, no. Tiana, I said temporary.<eos> It's just temporary, baby.<eos> Would it make a difference if I started sleeping with him again?<eos> Who?<eos> Hakeem?
You are right about that. That's, that's not what this is about.<eos> You know what? They're barely good enough to even open for me.<eos> That's it.<eos> I'm surprised you wanted to come back to work so soon.<eos> Especially for her.

That's the spot where my very best friend lost his life.<eos> He actually introduced me to your mama.<eos> He damn near raised y'all when I was on the road.<eos> He risked his life for me on more than one occasion, and I risked mine for him.<eos> Except one night.
Did he tell you he's a clown?<eos> No.<eos> What kind of clown are you?<eos> Entertain... that does things in a more...<eos> - Not even with Ringling Brothers. - Wow.
I get that vibe from you.<eos> Well, don't become a hoarder.<eos> Once you do that, you'll be on that show.<eos> And that's a picture of Ronald Reagan. - Oh.<eos> - Next to a picture of me.
How nice to hear from you.<eos> I have another assignment.<eos> It's time to help the police with their enquiries.<eos> Thank you for coming in today, Mrs Mullen.<eos> And with your baby.
What's gonna happen?<eos> Gonna be okay, baby.<eos> I talked to the man himself.<eos> So you talked to him this morning?<eos> Last night.
Who signed Raynard Waits out of custody at the jail that day?<eos> I did.<eos> Who was the ranking LAPD officer at the scene?<eos> I was.<eos> - By whose authority?
- Six-L-Thirty-Four, go.<eos> Yeah, I'm gonna need a supervisor here.<eos> Bosch.<eos> Hey, you know Fire Station 109, up Mulholland?<eos> - Yeah. Off Laurel Canyon.
He was casting his next film.<eos> I gave him a lap dance and he fell in love.<eos> I did one porno for him.<eos> And then he married me and took me away from all that.<eos> To this.
Dwayne!<eos> Come on, then, these prawns aren't going to eat themselves, you know.<eos> Let's eat!<eos> So JP, doggy paddle or back stroke?<eos> Er, freestyle.
No. Just three.<eos> Are you sure?<eos> I am, yeah.<eos> Freshman year I didn't make varsity because that winter I was in the hospital for five weeks.<eos> With what, AIDS?

From what?<eos> Complications from AIDS?<eos> No, I actually-- I actually got it from one of those hilarious swirlies.<eos> Yeah, my freshman year, you two were seniors.<eos> Right before winter break.
I actually used to be the world's greatest secret agent?<eos> Oh, before becoming an unlicensed private investigator.<eos> After a brief stint as a drug dealer.<eos> Okay, let's do this.<eos> Tonight.
I'm not the asshole here!<eos> Whitney!<eos> I'm the guy with the gun!<eos> Not the asshole, with eight toes!<eos> Nine, you-

Yeah, again, it's not gonna be like some homoerotic prep-school swirlie.<eos> Yeah, they were kind of oddly sexual.<eos> Gonna just leave that there?<eos> Lana?<eos> With pleasure.
Which hole?<eos> Because yes.<eos> Albeit grudgingly.<eos> And sexually, would you say...<eos> Which hole?
Keep it down back there!<eos> I swear, if I have to pull this van over...<eos> Whoa, that kinda hurt.<eos> Is L.A. making me soft?<eos> Or... softly awesome.
Oh.<eos> Wanna go to bed with me?<eos> We could be back at mine in like...<eos> I never did anything like that.<eos> All the more reason.

If senators only care about protecting their position wouldn't that make them slaves to public opinion?<eos> Polling data puts a majority of Americans in favor of Heaton-Harris.<eos> And that's exactly why you keep losing..<eos> Well, this is actually our first crack at guns but I take your point.<eos> What point?

My mother was in a coma recently, and I wasn't able to communicate with her, either. I take it she's passed?<eos> I wish I'd had the presence of mind to think of this when she was still alive.<eos> It might've solved a mystery that I may never know.<eos> Please enlighten me, Agent Mulder, how nine years of college, three degrees, and two years at Quantico has left me such a simpleton. Not a simpleton.<eos> A mugwump.
It's actually not that far-fetched and within the realm of accepted science.<eos> Something entering the germ line, something that would be passed down hereditarily.<eos> That would be an unprecedented violation of the public trust.<eos> And now you know a bit more of the history I was referring to.<eos> For the purpose of what?

It's because the past few weeks I've been feeling lost and...<eos> Like I did when I first came to Earth.<eos> So I started fantasizing about the same things I used to back then.<eos> I chose to come back because I realized I belong here with you.<eos> My family.
It was like I hated a part of myself.<eos> Now I only hate my cankles.<eos> I need to make out with somebody.<eos> - Wham, bam, thank you, sir.<eos> - No, someone new.

Look, professional courtesy.<eos> It's my murder, I talk to him first.<eos> Up to the captain.<eos> We'll see how he wants to handle the others.<eos> What others?
No, that doesn't fly.<eos> Come on, make it official.<eos> Let me call my lieutenant, buy you onto the case.<eos> - I want to talk to him.<eos> - Her.
A brothel.<eos> I'd call it a cat house, but hey.<eos> Yeah, still waiting on details.<eos> - What time?<eos> - Uh, tonight.
It's his place, I'll reach out to Felton, let them handle it.<eos> How do people live out here?<eos> It's a fuckin' desert.<eos> L.A.'s a desert.<eos> - With an ocean.
If they didn't know that Officer Irving was undercover,<eos> I absolutely want to keep it that way.<eos> Okay then. RHD will put O'Grady and Arceneaux under surveillance.<eos> I want to talk to him.<eos> To Arceneaux.
Done worse.<eos> Chief, why am I here?<eos> I want you to work the case.<eos> With RHD?<eos> With me.
Yeah.<eos> Tell me about Tony Allen.<eos> I'm sorry, I don't know who that is.<eos> Were you there that night?<eos> - What night?
- That was La Eme.<eos> - The fuck it was.<eos> No, the fuck it was.<eos> And you know who else they brought up?<eos> This guy La Chuleta.
That's their assault against me.<eos> Number one in their complaints.<eos> If you wish to be of service to me, Latin... make yourself disappear.<eos> He's rubbing my son's defeat in his face.<eos> His defeat?
But I was led off that course by those around me.<eos> Advice, I realize now... was warped and craven... and working for the other side.<eos> Your side.<eos> You won, Kaidu... the old-fashioned way.<eos> By any means necessary.
- Not good. Teddy Grammatico actually has a long and well-documented history of failing upwards while lateral-passing the blame to other shareholders.<eos> Yeah, he's a stay-the-course guy<eos> - all the way.<eos> - Okay. I have been talking to, um, some of the influential board members.<eos> Oh... Uh, Whip Huxton.
Jeannie?<eos> - Marty? - Ye... Bold-letters dazzling.<eos> That's what we do, Teddy.<eos> - Helvetica bold.<eos> - Doug... Or Futura.
Nothing. Tommy, go out for five minutes.<eos> Virag, I sit next to Lisa.<eos> Not anymore.<eos> Flora, please move.<eos> Next to Lisa.
But the moral underpinnings of your argument are at best, at very best, extremely unclear.<eos> For the record, I think it's very gross.<eos> Thank you, okay?<eos> 'Cause I was worried I was getting, like, old and pedestrian about sex and you know I pride myself on<eos> - my sexual openness. - Mm-mhm.
Who else'd he try to kill?<eos> This politician named General Walker.<eos> So if I see Oswald trying to do that, and I can prove he's not part of a conspiracy, then...<eos> Conspiracy?<eos> With who?
Well, I figured she'd be more comfortable.<eos> It also means you got room for more.<eos> They're out there, so I'm gonna be there with you.<eos> We are.<eos> Package deal.
Er, well, did he gamble?<eos> Or could he have sold something or borrowed the money?<eos> There's one thing.<eos> A few days before he died, he went to see someone.<eos> An antiques dealer.
Tomorrow's a new day.<eos> A new day.<eos> And it may never come.<eos> I wonder if I shouldn't go to Bodmin?<eos> To what purpose?
He has a couple of friends, but, you know, the kids, they're mean.<eos> They make fun of him.<eos> They call him names.<eos> -They laugh at him, his clothes--<eos> -His clothes?
-You're not?<eos> -You are a cliché, you do realize that?<eos> You are a cliché.<eos> What with your...<eos> your grades and your band practice.
Can you show that to me, please?<eos> How's your mom doing?<eos> I don't know.<eos> How long's this stuff been going on?<eos> With the lights and, uh...
No, this is not an okay time for you to shut down.<eos> -Shut down?<eos> What... -We have to deal with this, Mom.<eos> We have to deal with the funeral!<eos> The funeral?
-That was Will!<eos> -Mike...<eos> Lucas, you don't understand.<eos> He spoke last night.<eos> Words!
Leaving town, maybe?<eos> No.<eos> No, Barb wouldn't do that, ever.<eos> She wasn't maybe upset about the fact that you were spending time with this boy?<eos> Uh, Steve Harrington?
Do not go to fourth period.<eos> It's locked.<eos> -What?<eos> -Hey, do you think you can open it?<eos> With your powers?
How long does this take?<eos> Not long.<eos> Have you been... doing this a while?<eos> What?<eos> Photography?
Thanks.<eos> Thanks for coming out.<eos> I see Will the Wise is back.<eos> What's that shooting out of his cane?<eos> Fireballs.
Been doing it for 12 years.<eos> Terry, uh, pretends like Jane is real, - like she's gonna come home someday.<eos> Says she's special.<eos> Born with "abilities."<eos> Abilities?
He's not my boyfriend.<eos> I think you better tell him that.<eos> What?<eos> Only love makes you that crazy, sweetheart.<eos> And that damn stupid.
And piss yourself.<eos> What?<eos> Was she alone?<eos> She always hangs out with those losers.<eos> "Losers"?
What?<eos> Was she alone?<eos> She always hangs out with those losers.<eos> "Losers"?<eos> What losers?
- It's here.<eos> - Wait, what's here?<eos> - Where is it?<eos> - Where is what? Whoa!<eos> - Easy with that!
I've never been, but I know you're not supposed to go with your sister.<eos> - No?<eos> - I mean... you can, but it'd be really weird.<eos> You go to school dances with someone that, you know... someone that you like.<eos> - A friend?
- No?<eos> - I mean... you can, but it'd be really weird.<eos> You go to school dances with someone that, you know... someone that you like.<eos> - A friend?<eos> - Not a friend.
- So, uh, you win?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Awesome.<eos> - Hey, Jonathan, wait up.<eos> - Uh... - Merry Christmas.
- No.<eos> No, it's, uh, it's not really a present.<eos> It's, um...<eos> Well, you'll see.<eos> Merry Christmas.
That's got nothing to do with this.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Don't even go there!<eos> OK.<eos> What about Henry Williams?
I didn't.<eos> We have you on CCTV.<eos> Why were you there?<eos> I went to meet someone.<eos> Laura Jones.
Why were you there?<eos> I went to meet someone.<eos> Laura Jones.<eos> No.<eos> Then who?
- Uh, everything all right?<eos> - He went on a bender.<eos> - What do you mean?<eos> When?<eos> - Last night.
Devon.<eos> And I'm a little bit biased.<eos> She and Nico did a play together downtown.<eos> Can you introduce me to Andy?<eos> - Griffith?
Jesus. You okay?<eos> Yeah, I'm fine.<eos> I mean, I'm a little shaken as you can imagine, but...<eos> Sweetie, I need to talk to Detective...<eos> - Voehel.
Besides, it's more fun to break the rules than to follow them.<eos> ♪ Forever young ♪<eos> ♪ I wanna be forever young ♪<eos> ♪ Do you really want to live forever ♪<eos> ♪ Forever young ♪
How is that even possible?<eos> So, what, I'm miraculously healed, and all of you... stunning people have magical powers?<eos> No.<eos> No, don't confuse me with a warlock.<eos> - A what?
So, what, I'm miraculously healed, and all of you... stunning people have magical powers?<eos> No.<eos> No, don't confuse me with a warlock.<eos> - A what?<eos> - A warlock.
Now that he's been, uh, convicted, sure.<eos> But when he had a chance to plead out...<eos> That's the past.<eos> Right now, we are trying to set something up that will allow Skip to show his rehabilitation and for him to contribute to society.<eos> By what?
Back when we started, you wouldn't have been able to recognize the motivation until long after you bought it.<eos> Well, back when we started, I was just rich, not super-rich.<eos> You know, being a billionaire... I never get to talk about this with anyone 'cause who's gonna give a shit?<eos> But being a billionaire, when you walk into a room, it's like being a woman with a perfect set of tits.<eos> Or great legs.
Like nothing's wrong.<eos> So when we tie Axelrod to bribery of law enforcement officers and obstruction of justice...<eos> We are sitting pretty in Schaefer City.<eos> This is Axelrod in jail.<eos> Real jail time, too.
The stigma.<eos> They want their kids to have a clean run at their new lives.<eos> We can provide fresh passports for all of you.<eos> No.<eos> Yes, their real names.
-Hi.<eos> There is no one in the field.<eos> Did you hear what your father did to Gudjon's father last night?<eos> Your father is crazy!<eos> -Outside the hotel.
You know, what we had was something very... something very private.<eos> - It's private?<eos> - I didn't mean private.<eos> I meant more like, uh, secret.<eos> Like our dirty little secret.
A series of awful, terrible mistakes.<eos> Starting with whatever that was with what's his name.<eos> Julian.<eos> Your lover's name is Julian.<eos> Yes, him.
Maybe.<eos> - So I was thinking that...<eos> - But doesn't it make more sense, Ted, to hold on to what you've got?<eos> Because if you lose it, then you might end up with nothing at all.<eos> Nothing.
I'm not saying that, okay?<eos> - I'm just saying...<eos> - Wait, hold it.<eos> Like who?<eos> Like who, what?
All right, so we're at an hour and six minutes.<eos> Screw it, let's call it an hour.<eos> - How do you wanna pay up?<eos> - What works for you?<eos> Cash.
All I ask is that the bastard who kidnapped my son never gets closer again.<eos> I just want you to scare him.<eos> Thank you very much.<eos> Where was Charlie the other night?<eos> With me.
Thank you very much.<eos> Where was Charlie the other night?<eos> With me.<eos> And yesterday afternoon?<eos> With me as well.
Always be distant and weird.<eos> What's the matter with you?<eos> Sorry.<eos> No, it's dealing with that.<eos> The orphan Tulip?
We are done!<eos> This conversation is over.<eos> Last word, me!<eos> - Last word.<eos> - Me.
Last word, me!<eos> - Last word.<eos> - Me.<eos> - Last word. Last word. - Me.<eos> Me. Me.
Look, we both chose the bar over other stuff.<eos> I-I could've been a lawyer, and-and you were a dentist.<eos> Were you, really?<eos> You were gonna be a dentist?<eos> - Endodontist.
I wasn't tracking him down.<eos> I wasn't always a bounty hunter.<eos> I did a stint in the Army down near Escalante.<eos> Wyatt was my sergeant.<eos> My friend.
One big difference, though... the processing power in here is way beyond what we have.<eos> It's got one drawback, though.<eos> What's that?<eos> You're under our control.<eos> Well, their control.
But now it feels like a lie.<eos> Only thing I know is whatever's out there, I'm never going back.<eos> What is it you're looking for?<eos> Lawrence is right. You could've stayed in Pariah or gone back, but you're here.<eos> With me.
We don't know how the hosts work, and I think there's something wrong with them.<eos> Ford's explanation only bolsters my hunch.<eos> The ability to deviate from program behavior arises out of the host's recall of past iterations.<eos> You're thinking there's a connection between memory and--<eos> And improvisation, yes.
It lives in the dirt, pecking insects out of the muck, consoling itself with its great beauty.<eos> Ihavecometothinkof somuchof consciousness asa burden, aweight, andwehave sparedthemthat.<eos> Anxiety, self-loathing, guilt.<eos> The hosts are the ones who are free.<eos> Free here under my control.
Hey.<eos> I-it's Joni, right?<eos> It's Scott Hunter.<eos> I served in 'Nam with your husband.<eos> A-and with Arthur.
No, you... you have not been around.<eos> I called your place and you were not there!<eos> Jesus, what are you taking?<eos> Who you here with, huh?<eos> With these two tearoom bottoms?
Please leave your name and number after the beep.<eos> I need to speak with the... is anybody there?<eos> I need somebody to pick up.<eos> - I gotta talk to someone, please.<eos> - Morning, sunshine.
Thank you kindly.<eos> What would be your expert recommendation?<eos> - How hungry are you? - Very.<eos> The biscuits and gravy are the best things on the menu.<eos> - Sawmill? - Red-eye.
What would be your expert recommendation?<eos> - How hungry are you? - Very.<eos> The biscuits and gravy are the best things on the menu.<eos> - Sawmill? - Red-eye.<eos> - Even better.
- Even better.<eos> - And steer clear of the meat loaf, but you didn't hear that from me.<eos> Loud and clear.<eos> Biscuits, some of that red-eye gravy. Cheese eggs. Scrambled if they can swing it.<eos> Okay.
Seriously?<eos> I had you down, as more of a cat person.<eos> You don't talk about that stuff.<eos> What?<eos> - Your past.
She'd write her manifestos about how technology was destroying the world.<eos> Then one day... the police came and they run.<eos> It's strange.<eos> I see her in so many young women.<eos> On the street, in my dreams.
Death sometimes just sneaks up on you.<eos> It's been a while since I played hot potato.<eos> I'm in this hospital bed.<eos> I'm barely conscious.<eos> Delirious.
I wanted to be a high school guidance counselor but instead I went to prison.<eos> You made the right decision.<eos> How did you steal all that money?<eos> Right.<eos> Yeah, well, uh...
I'm so glad you came over because I was just saying I'm so tired.<eos> Gonna head out. Oh.<eos> Okay.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Okay, so...
- Look.<eos> Mitch, right?<eos> - Lieutenant to you.<eos> - "Lieutenant"?<eos> Like in the army?
It stings!<eos> That's just the lactic acid.<eos> Actually, it's the jellyfish stuck to you.<eos> What the fuck?<eos> Oh, my God!
'Cause you're talking about them.<eos> Testing.<eos> Failed.<eos> Oh, my God. Well, we're gonna be<eos> - in swimsuits a lot, so...
I don't know, honestly.<eos> You don't know?<eos> - I grew up in a foster home.<eos> - Shit.<eos> - Three of them, actually.
Hey, guys, one more important thing.<eos> I want to introduce you to our new captain who has been running our Hawaii division very successfully for years now.<eos> The amazing Captain Casey Jean.<eos> Is it just me, or is she in...<eos> - In super-slow motion?
You will feel it.<eos> You speak very harshly to him.<eos> Braver than the others.<eos> I have some things I need to ask.<eos> What things?
My wife's family has lived here for 1,200 years.<eos> Mmm. I'm just a visitor.<eos> Alessio's family has been here for just as long.<eos> The women work here in the house. The men, in the quarry.<eos> The quarry? Mmm.
He was by the wall as if he was...<eos> Listening.<eos> Yes, I've seen him do it.<eos> In his bedroom.<eos> Also in the garden.
Listening.<eos> Yes, I've seen him do it.<eos> In his bedroom.<eos> Also in the garden.<eos> In the quarry.
Verena.<eos> Verena!<eos> Look at yourself.<eos> Not here.<eos> Not this room.
It's just we were thinking we might want to move somewhere... where we could actually afford to buy a house.<eos> Show him the pictures.<eos> Where is this?<eos> St. Louis.<eos> Missouri?
It's torture for me to see you guys, too... especially hatchet-face over here... but I need to know if you've seen Pippi.<eos> She's working at some restaurant by the lake.<eos> That's all we know.<eos> Now please... fuck off.<eos> A restaurant?
She's working at some restaurant by the lake.<eos> That's all we know.<eos> Now please... fuck off.<eos> A restaurant?<eos> What restaurant?
What's going on?<eos> What's going on where?<eos> You've got some heat on you, Arthur.<eos> Your name keeps coming up.<eos> In what circles?
What circles do you think?<eos> Now, tell me a story about a girl called Lucy, a Viking called Greybeard, and some rebel graffiti dirtying these walls.<eos> Are you writing a book?<eos> Tell me.<eos> Every detail.
Hello, boy.<eos> What are you doing out at this time?<eos> I work on the boats, sir.<eos> Out on the first tide.<eos> The boats, eh?
They'll start by telling us...<eos> If you're intending to galvanize the people of this country against the current king, there has to be a realistic strategy.<eos> Strategy requires leadership.<eos> Then they'll bang on for a while about how clever and educated they are.<eos> In the art of war, diplomacy, and chivalry.
A man of taste.<eos> Straight up.<eos> No ice, no water, no chaser... No shit.<eos> Walter?<eos> When in Rome.
All right, Ankor, let me know when you're in position, and we can get this party started.<eos> I'm in position.<eos> Contact.<eos> All good, Tee?<eos> All right.
Attention.<eos> Captain Daniels, please report to the Med Bay.<eos> Repeat.<eos> Captain Daniels, please report to the Med Bay.<eos> Jesus.
Yeah, we're not too sure about him, either.<eos> And then there's me, Papa Smurf.<eos> I sort of run this place.<eos> But this isn't a story about me.<eos> Or Clumsy.
But this isn't a story about me.<eos> Or Clumsy.<eos> Or any of them.<eos> It's about the only girl in our village.<eos> Smurfette.
You know, I think I've had enough of these flying Antipastos for one day.<eos> Hey!<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> Well, I was thinking of getting a little place out here.<eos> Just a quiet place in the forest.
- Garga?<eos> Garga-what?<eos> He's a dangerous wizard who wants to capture all Smurfs and use them for his evil magic.<eos> And he knows about your lost village.<eos> "Lost village"?
But our next group of friends is due to arrive, so it's time to bust you out.<eos> Copperfield's coming.<eos> Presto changeo!<eos> Woman in a box.<eos> In a box.
- Yeah, it's not your fault, Z.<eos> Just like everything, this is rock star Johnny's fault.<eos> I was with you when it happened, Ritchie.<eos> We were side by side.<eos> Yeah, yeah, yeah, side by side.
and what?<eos> No one is hurt only the insurance company, They will be fine.<eos> They were very quiet gentlemen.<eos> They carried out the operation very carefully.<eos> Like a dance.
Sorry.<eos> Your father will take you out of school today.<eos> Have you become a believer or something like that?<eos> I doubt that, but he realized what he was missing.<eos> Yes, this week.
I can see that coming.<eos> I don't need to wait for the fucking letter.<eos> And then three months ago, I suffered what I've been told was a...<eos> An episode of acute coronary insufficiency.<eos> Like a heart attack.
What a display<eos> What a breathtaking, thrilling array<eos> Every prince Every dog has his day<eos> Let us sing with passion, gusto, fit to bust, oh<eos> Not a care in the world
You really wanna marry into this family?<eos> So, that means... that the castle is that...<eos> No.<eos> No, it's...<eos> That way.
So, that means... that the castle is that...<eos> No.<eos> No, it's...<eos> That way.<eos> Definitely, that way.
Me too.<eos> The villagers say that I'm a funny girl... but I'm not sure they mean it as a compliment.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Your village sounds terrible.<eos> Almost as lonely as your castle.
Don't worry, Master.<eos> You'll do fine.<eos> Just stop being so nervous and tell Belle how you feel.<eos> Because if you don't... I promise you'll be drinking cold tea for the rest of your days!<eos> - In the dark.
Just stop being so nervous and tell Belle how you feel.<eos> Because if you don't... I promise you'll be drinking cold tea for the rest of your days!<eos> - In the dark.<eos> - Covered in dust.<eos> Dark and very, very dusty.
- No!<eos> - Come here!<eos> Shut up!<eos> You won't get away with this, Gaston!<eos> Oh, Belle!
- Yeah.<eos> - Right.<eos> Great. - Good?<eos> - Okay.<eos> Awesome, all right.
You don't wanna talk about that.<eos> Or the booze you're drinking.<eos> Or the pus you're wiping away from your knuckles.<eos> Or the blood I wash from your clothes.<eos> Or the fresh wounds in your chest.
This is business.<eos> They are making soldiers.<eos> Killers.<eos> These are babies of mutantes...<eos> - North Dakota.
Where...<eos> Where is my mug?<eos> Why are people always taking my mug?<eos> You know, I know we're a rough school and everything, and we don't usually have control over the students, but this is the worst I've ever seen the pranks.<eos> Really?
Are you joking?<eos> Look, man, I was in a very tight spot there, you know.<eos> Tyler really was pitting us against each other, and...<eos> After school, you gonna meet me in the parking lot, and we gonna handle this shit the primitive way.<eos> With our fists.
Wait.<eos> Did you lose your job?<eos> No.<eos> What?<eos> Oh, my God.
Did you lose your job?<eos> No.<eos> What?<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Oh, my God.
Why did you do that? - 'Cause you said, "Like how?"<eos> When he was talking about getting hit in the head.<eos> I meant, "Like how do I make a fist?"<eos> Not, "Like how do I get punched in the fucking head?"<eos> - Oh, Jesus Christ!
Since Stanford.<eos> A very long time.<eos> I always knew you were destined for great things.<eos> I just thought it would be on Wall Street.<eos> Not Main Street.
Hey!<eos> Look what I found.<eos> Great!<eos> Where was it?<eos> In the car.
I hope I'm not interrupting.<eos> Just saw a man leaving.<eos> It was a delivery.<eos> Tessa, why are you here?<eos> At our house?
"Tessa Manning, age 16,<eos> "when her father left her mother and moved in with his secretary,<eos> "Tessa became destabilized, "exhibiting obsessive, negative and occasional violent behaviors."<eos> She set fire to their house.<eos> To whose house?
I was just a boy. A little older than you.<eos> No.<eos> No, there was never peace.<eos> Not here.<eos> Nor anywhere else in the world.
Your mother wants to know if you're eating properly.<eos> 'Listen, Dad, could you do me a favour?<eos> ' - What?<eos> 'Could you just check something on my car?<eos> ' - Your car?
Oh, what are you doing?<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Come here.<eos> Have you heard of that thing?<eos> In Germany?
My name is Sherlock Holmes.<eos> Goodbye, Sherlock Holmes.<eos> You're out of time.<eos> Tell me about your boss, Moriarty.<eos> Who?
Bye!<eos> Bye.<eos> Now, you think we'd have noticed, when she was born.<eos> Hmm? Noticed what?<eos> The little 666 on her forehead.
Simple, really.<eos> We'll use explosives to shake the earth and create vibrations, helping us to map the subsurface of the island.<eos> We'll fly in over the south shore and then strategically drop seismic charges to better help us understand the density of the earth.<eos> You're dropping bombs?<eos> Mmm... Scientific instruments.
We hear you.<eos> Yeah!<eos> We're on a boat. We're on a boat<eos> - headed up north on a river.<eos> - A boat?
I stopped lying down.<eos> Alone?<eos> Of course, alone.<eos> I meant Rosie.<eos> Your daughter.
-Are you talking to her? -Piss off!<eos> (SLAMS DOOR)<eos> -So, what do you think?<eos> -Of what?<eos> -My case.
Oh.<eos> Well, no, a medical doctor, you know, not just feet or media studies or something.<eos> I'm a doctor.<eos> Are you serious?<eos> No, really.
You said it didn't the last time, and it wouldn't with Sherlock.<eos> -So who was it the last time?<eos> Who are you talking about?<eos> -Atta boy.<eos> Nobody.
(CHUCKLES) Obviously.<eos> She was real.<eos> But, I didn't mean Mycroft.<eos> I mean the other one.<eos> Which other one?
Please proceed to designated failsafe.<eos> Hold it!<eos> Wait, wait, wait!<eos> In the sand!<eos> In the sand!
She predicted the exact dates of the last three terrorist attacks on the British mainland after an hour on Twitter.<eos> That sort of thing.<eos> In return, however, she requires treats.<eos> - Last year it was a violin.<eos> - This year?
-There's a gun in the hatch.<eos> Take it.<eos> You want to save the governor's wife?<eos> Choose either Dr Watson or Mycroft to kill the governor.<eos> God.
You are a good man, and you are doing a good thing.<eos> So are you.<eos> I'll spend the rest of my life telling myself that.<eos> Please...<eos> God.
Okay, we need to talk!<eos> In private.<eos> Sure.<eos> About what, bud?<eos> About the b-a-b-e-e.
No!<eos> What's that, Lam-Lam?<eos> You want a nose ring?<eos> It's really not my scene, but who am I to judge?<eos> And an eyebrow ring?
You're gonna stay in this house with your baby brother... until you learn to get along.<eos> Great.<eos> It was my first time behind bars.<eos> The big house.<eos> The lock-up.
Yes.<eos> I'm the Baby Jesus.<eos> No!<eos> You see, I'm more middle management for the company.<eos> The company?
I think I'm gonna be sick!<eos> Swirly!<eos> There's only an hour before the plane takes off.<eos> Let's take the bike.<eos> The bike?
I'm back.<eos> What's going on?<eos> That's right.<eos> We're gonna launch a brand new puppy in every continent.<eos> In every country!
Impeccable, both physically and mentally.<eos> We control the DNA of our progeny... germinating them in birthing pods.<eos> I guess I prefer to make people the old-fashioned way.<eos> Perhaps someday, you could give me a history lesson... in the archaic ways of our ancestors.<eos> For academic purposes.
Your daughter raises her voice at me now.<eos> Mija.<eos> They say Okja was selected as the best pig.<eos> They have plans for her in America.<eos> America?
I promise... No, I pledge, to learn everything I can, everything from this situation...<eos> For more details and shocking proof of Mirando's crimes against humanity and animals, go to YouTube and search "Mirando is fucked."<eos> That's right, folks.<eos> Go to YouTube now and search "Mirando is F-U-C-K-E-D."<eos> Fucked!
Now, are those older guys your friends?<eos> Oh, yeah. That's my gang.<eos> Wait.<eos> Y-You're in a gang?<eos> Oh, not like a gang-gang, like a...
Game.<eos> What game are you gonna play?<eos> Call for help.<eos> Hello!<eos> Hello.
You broke that one.<eos> You broke it real good.<eos> Broke it.<eos> Sure did, pal.<eos> Hello!
I've got a hammer.<eos> You must see, hear, understand, and act.<eos> Act now.<eos> Friends, we all live in the mud.<eos> In the shit!
I want you to handle that...<eos> Well, surprise, surprise!<eos> It's not fixed!<eos> What's that, Doris?<eos> Dad's car.
About the age this man is now.<eos> Well, consider this.<eos> Cooper knew Briggs.<eos> Cooper was around Briggs 25 years ago, and now, Cooper shows up in this neck of the woods.<eos> On the loose in this neck of the woods.
I'm 43.<eos> Mr. Hastings, are you the author of an online journal or blog entitled The Search for the Zone?<eos> Uh-huh. Yes.<eos> What sort of things do you write about?<eos> Different things.
- Is that it?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Oh. Of course.<eos> What about the utility belt?<eos> Anything in your cape?
- In... in K'un-Lun.<eos> K'un-Lun.<eos> Where is that?<eos> It exists in another dimension.<eos> Another dimension?
But his smile...<eos> I must have had that dream a hundred times.<eos> I had a dream about him, too.<eos> When?<eos> In the hospital.
There's more at stake here than just your bills.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Hey.<eos> Are you the one who takes care of these?<eos> The gravestones?
Exactly what you said.<eos> They don't have a case.<eos> You don't seem especially happy about it.<eos> Just questioning things, I guess.<eos> What kind of things?
Let's just get this over with.<eos> Hey.<eos> If it sounded like I was prying earlier, I apologize.<eos> I'm not good at this stuff.<eos> What stuff?
The Hand's version of a challenge.<eos> Their best fighters against me.<eos> If I defeat them, they'll meet my demands.<eos> You've done this before?<eos> In K'un-Lun, yeah.
Today is Darryl's last day.<eos> He's been selected for an elite training program that comes with a full scholarship to a university.<eos> - You gonna miss me?<eos> - Nah...<eos> Mostly.
And that will make you stronger.<eos> A single arrow is easily broken... but not ten in a bundle.<eos> I came to warn you.<eos> The Hand knows who you are.<eos> Claire, too.
It's good.<eos> Danny might actually be onto...<eos> What's going on?<eos> The board just held an emergency meeting.<eos> About what?
I'm sorry to see I was wrong.<eos> You worried Gao won't turn up?<eos> It's the waiting.<eos> It's hard.<eos> About your mom...
- Maybe you should ask yourself that.<eos> Everything fell apart once you showed up.<eos> This is my fault?<eos> Yes.<eos> Mostly.
- Security's too tight.<eos> - And nobody really wants to.<eos> Are there any areas off-limits?<eos> Yeah, a few.<eos> Mostly back that way.
- What's the problem, Ward?<eos> No problem.<eos> I just wanna spend some quality time with Joy.<eos> The hospital that you sent me to recommended that I make amends to her.<eos> - Part of the whole NA business.
And not Danny?<eos> Danny?<eos> Danny is just a drug-smuggling fugitive from the law.<eos> I think we both know that's not true.<eos> Either way...
- Who are you?<eos> - Who are you?<eos> - You all right?<eos> - What are you doing?<eos> In between gigs, huh?
But I think he's with the Hand.<eos> It's a criminal organization.<eos> No telling how old they are.<eos> Nor how much influence they have. They are everywhere.<eos> In everything.
I come to you because it's important that we take care of this together.<eos> Have you told the others?<eos> Madame Gao and Sowande are ready and willing.<eos> And the other one?<eos> On his way.
Yeah, I trained him to fight a war.<eos> He decided to put on an outfit.<eos> Stop muggers in back alleys.<eos> Well, from what I've heard, you're... you're doing a good job.<eos> Past tense.
But the first person you sought out was Colleen Wing.<eos> Hmm, yes, that was our assignment.<eos> She could lead us to the Iron Fist.<eos> - And she did.<eos> In fact...
So, what do I need to know about the architect?<eos> His wife hired me to find him.<eos> He didn't tell her much.<eos> Especially not about some secret tunnel under New York.<eos> Not a tunnel.
And I know you do, too.<eos> This city is at stake.<eos> Me and you...<eos> Luke Cage and the Iron Fist... we belong out there.<eos> Together, on the front lines.
And you?<eos> You wanted more than K'un-Lun.<eos> That's why you abandoned it, isn't it?<eos> They told me all about you.<eos> About your struggle.
I'll walk you out.<eos> Hey there, um... about our mutual friend with the multiple lives...<eos> I always knew those lives would get him killed.<eos> And in the end, I actually helped him get to that building.<eos> In the suit, no less.
You guys, I'm pretty sure I'm gonna die in this banister.<eos> Charlie, what's going on?<eos> Look, I'm coming clean. We've been watching you guys, right?<eos> The presents that we brought over... they're hidden cameras.<eos> The teddy bear, the globe... all that shit.
Never moved.<eos> Never blinked.<eos> Gives me goose bumps just thinking about it.<eos> He had all the right answers, but my gut told me this guy was guilty.<eos> Of something.
- I think it's dumb.<eos> - Uh-huh. So if you were buying circus peanuts and candy sour worms and cigarettes, I think we all know what that means about the ticket in question, don't we?<eos> I don't.<eos> Do you know?<eos> - No.
You guys want to introduce yourselves? Ugh. Goddamn it.<eos> Uh, I'm Frank.<eos> I've been around the block, seen some action.<eos> I was in 'Nam for a while.<eos> Private sector mostly.
I know something that could help.<eos> You know this is not what in mind.<eos> When is the last time you went shopping?<eos> Houston.<eos> A week ago.
Turn it up.<eos> That Christian Grey and his colleague Ros Bailey have been found safe and well and at this moment on their way back to Seattle.<eos> What the hell y'all doing here?<eos> Christian.<eos> Oh my god.
Trish, is it?<eos> My name's Ellie.<eos> I'm a detective with Wessex Police.<eos> You called about an attack.<eos> A sexual attack.
Trish, after the attack, were you left where it happened, or were you transported somewhere else?<eos> I-I was left there.<eos> How did you get to the police station tonight?<eos> Walk?<eos> Drive?
There's been an allegation of rape.<eos> You're kidding?<eos> No.<eos> But... who?<eos> Oh, my God, who?
- Mark, come on.<eos> Bye, little Liz Bug.<eos> Look after your mum and sister, will you?<eos> See you Thursday, after the French exam?<eos> Yeah, cinema.
Yes, well, Assistant Professor.<eos> And what'd you teach?<eos> Philosophy.<eos> Truth and logic.<eos> That sort of thing.
It's Florida.<eos> I'm blending in.<eos> How was school?<eos> Hmm, fun.<eos> Not like regular school fun... but interesting.
Not like regular school fun... but interesting.<eos> What is this book?<eos> Discourse on Method. René Descartes.<eos> What's it about?<eos> Existence.
What is this book?<eos> Discourse on Method. René Descartes.<eos> What's it about?<eos> Existence.<eos> Existence?
Mustard gas, hydrogen based instead of sulfur.<eos> Hydrogen based...<eos> Gas masks would be useless against hydrogen.<eos> The book says, they plan to release the gas...<eos> At the front?
At the front?<eos> When?<eos> It doesn't say.<eos> Wait.<eos> In "front" of what?
Are this address and contact number correct?<eos> And are there any other family members we should inform?<eos> - No<eos> - Nobody?<eos> Not here or in your country of origin?
_<eos> We live on the one place where you are guaranteed a quiet life.<eos> The safest place on earth.
- No one respects you...<eos> - Cover.<eos> Get away from me.<eos> All right, they're not in China.<eos> Or Russia.
It may be written on deerskin.<eos> So what you're saying is...<eos> "Brace, do you have any idea where I can find ma ain death warrant?"<eos> I may need to prove to a tribunal that the land was acquired by treaty and not by conquest.<eos> Tribunal?
How would he?<eos> He was in Africa.<eos> But he often spoke of you.<eos> He was very, very proud.<eos> Why Dublin?
The Nootka Sound treaty.<eos> I may need to prove to a tribunal that the land was acquired by treaty and not by conquest.<eos> Pettifer said if Delaney wanted to trade with the Indians at Nootka, the only merchandise you could possibly use would be gunpowder.<eos> - Where the fuck are we?<eos> - My new factory.
If he stayed to eat the eggs I boiled for him... he would hear my story of last night.<eos> Soldiers in red.<eos> Soldiers in blue.<eos> Running by the window.<eos> Out there on the foreshore.
Yes?<eos> I will get you men.<eos> James...<eos> You said his name!<eos> In your sleep.
What have you done?<eos> I've killed him.<eos> Just like you said.<eos> Where is the body?<eos> In the bedroom.
In the bedroom.<eos> Are you sure he's dead?<eos> Quite dead.<eos> Sit there.<eos> - In the bedroom?
It is inevitable.<eos> Fix the roof.<eos> Gunpowder and water don't mix.<eos> Where's Brace?<eos> In his room.
You are betrayed!<eos> Two women came to Leadenhall...<eos> I know.<eos> Where are they now?<eos> A safe house.
The location of the powder you gave them.<eos> Now, if you can give me all that and what you tell us is corroborated, then... then these people won't be needed and you will await trial in the same cell that Thomas Moore occupied, with not an unpleasant view of the River Thames.<eos> So...?<eos> I will give you all the information that you request... but in return, I will need a single meeting with<eos> Sir Stuart Strange of the East India Company here, in a cell, and in private.
We grow our wool, and just when we're getting warm, they come along with their electric clippers and shear our wool off, and we're just naked, screaming little fucks!<eos> No wool for us!<eos> Freezing and hungry!<eos> In the night.<eos> In the dark.
Fuck no!<eos> Oh, they wouldn't come anyway.<eos> They're-they're too busy fucking!<eos> Fucking us at the grocery store!<eos> At the bank!
Oh, they wouldn't come anyway.<eos> They're-they're too busy fucking!<eos> Fucking us at the grocery store!<eos> At the bank!<eos> At the gas pump!
I know.<eos> What?<eos> My dream.<eos> Ah, the dream again.<eos> In the dream...
Of course.<eos> And that girl?<eos> Is she in the hospital here?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Intensive care?
I mean, you know I'm gonna tell you what's on mine.<eos> We're sinking down deep in the mud.<eos> Act now!<eos> Friends, we all live in the mud.<eos> In the shit!
What were they doing?<eos> Like, practically making out.<eos> Slow dancing and getting real close.<eos> Over in the corner.<eos> Off in their own world.
Oh, Dougie.<eos> When you didn't come home last night,<eos> I thought the worst.<eos> Look what you've done.<eos> - Seven heaven.
At first, I thought Wren was putting me on.<eos> But then he pulled out his phone showed me your picture.<eos> I still don't know why, but I started to cry.<eos> He just ran into you?<eos> At a bar?
And...<eos> We are ready for fruitful cooperation.<eos> The first step which is already laid.<eos> In the course of our assistance to your successful landing.<eos> Generally...
However, a resolution was blocked by Russia.<eos> (Coughs)<eos> She came?<eos> - Julia?<eos> - Oh, hello.
You told me you can, once in your life, and take help.<eos> Just help?<eos> You are welcome.<eos> Finally.<eos> - Good morning.
!<eos> In the rear.<eos> So. I ask, please, no offense, Colonel.<eos> We are not here on a first date.<eos> In the general case.
Comrades officers, please leave the room.<eos> All leave the room.<eos> - Who is this?<eos> - One of the possible candidates.<eos> In what sense?
I just really wanted it to happen not on your eyes.<eos> And I thought you did not ask what I want?<eos> Maybe I wanted to spend the last months of her life, by her side.<eos> Close to the only person who understood me.<eos> And not diskach camp.
A dangerous thing.<eos> 30 minutes and he'll go look wet aliens.<eos> Mmm!<eos> It's delicious, thank you!<eos> To your health.
And so, if you wanna go on pretending you can win, you're really left with no option but to try to convince the country you've invaded that you're actually here to help.<eos> He's saying the Americans are urinating in the streets, and they call us motherfuckers all day.<eos> It's motherfucker motherfucker all the time.<eos> And it's considered in our culture a very bad thing to fuck your own mother.<eos> In ours, too... in ours, too.
Do we?<eos> Look, if... if you cut the bit with the boat, it's all exposition.<eos> The boat bit's the only funny part of the scene.<eos> Hope we're not keeping things in just because they're funny.<eos> In... the comedy.
Jesus, you're pussies.<eos> Actually, with everyone's phone going off, we'd never get any work done.<eos> - And we're pussies.<eos> - And we're pussies.<eos> Anyway, so...
- How?<eos> - For, like, 30 years.<eos> Since she was like a virgin.<eos> I met her at The Factory.<eos> - What Factory?
Some costume night or something.<eos> School fundraiser.<eos> The victim's on the back terrace.<eos> - Witnesses? - Plenty.<eos> Though not a lot of clarity.
Actually, I was wrong about him but I was right about the wrong thing.<eos> Who are we talking about here?<eos> Parrish.<eos> Remember how I thought that the Ghost Riders - were scared of him?<eos> - At the party?
It's a supernatural rift, Malia, it's not the Golden Gate Bridge.<eos> I doubt we can even see it, let alone get through.<eos> This is a horrible waste of time.<eos> You promised me.<eos> On your death bed.
They're all in the lockers.<eos> They're locked away behind each one.<eos> Every memory of Stiles is in a separate locker.<eos> Scott, you're there.<eos> In the high school.
I think I'm having a panic attack.<eos> Okay. Come on. Come on.<eos> Just try and think about something else. Anything else.<eos> Like what?<eos> Happy things. Good things.
Put pressure, okay?<eos> We're gonna get you help.<eos> You're just a little septic, but I've already stopped the bleeding, so you're fine.<eos> All you need is a shot of penicillin... it's the most common drug in the world.<eos> My world.
How long have you been in the Wizard's Guard?<eos> I...<eos> I don't know.<eos> Cross stitched at the hilt.<eos> Ceremonial hilt.
I may not be his mother, but I feel what all mothers feel.<eos> - What's that?<eos> - Fear.<eos> All the time.<eos> In everything.
I'll need to find replacements.<eos> If you're looking for a career change...<eos> Magic!<eos> That I banned from Oz.<eos> Here in Emerald City!
You all right?<eos> There was a girl in here earlier.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I was gonna ask you about that.<eos> About her.
Full circle.<eos> Here. Here.<eos> Your new world awaits.<eos> I knew it was you.<eos> In the water.
Magic.<eos> I believe we were mislead.<eos> The magic we put our faith in, it didn't make us stronger.<eos> We were left to rely on others.<eos> On Witches.
You don't have to do that.<eos> I do see you.<eos> I've lied to you...<eos> All of you...<eos> About your daughters.
The crest is king pastoria's...<eos> Handed down to his daughter at birth.<eos> His daughter?<eos> The princess.<eos> Ozma.
Your father had many and that's who we'll recruit.<eos> Then let's go.<eos> What?<eos> You can't go like that.<eos> Like what?
How very maternal of you.<eos> She is just a girl!<eos> She's standing in the way of survival.<eos> Frank, you have taken everything else from me.<eos> Not this too.
- No one will see.<eos> Well, they'll hear.<eos> You know how I get.<eos> Fine, no desk.<eos> Bathroom.
It's like a triple whammy.<eos> She's in a pretty fragile state.<eos> You know, we all have baggage, Ed.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> Nothing.
But I would like to see him again.<eos> Okay.<eos> Wanna see him?<eos> - Ziggy?<eos> - Hi.
So... how about we get together tonight, and you can tell me why?<eos> OK?<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Paddy did it.<eos> Always in shades of blue.
The field of play<eos> I love it. The nearest house is across the lake.<eos> Total privacy.<eos> I know what you're thinking.<eos> - What?
I shall play black.<eos> Is good?<eos> - Is good. - Yeah.<eos> I like it.<eos> Confident.
- Four days a week, like clockwork.<eos> - You're spying on me.<eos> - I notice details.<eos> - If we're talking crap, I'd rather be in bed and you're part of my dream.<eos> - Really?
Doing this...<eos> - ...making...<eos> - Don't you believe it. At any rate, this advertising thing isn't forever.<eos> I've got plans, you know?<eos> Really?
So five years gone.<eos> Wow. In the joint?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I heard about Charlie.<eos> Not the particulars.
Bye, Clay.<eos> See you, Justin.<eos> You guys go.<eos> Whoa!<eos> No way! The bus?
Sort of.<eos> Hey, Clay.<eos> Hey, Tony.<eos> You okay?<eos> Yeah, fine.
Can I eat with you?<eos> Uh, I've got geometry homework.<eos> I don't mind.<eos> So, communications class.<eos> Really?
And, of course, they're going to learn about you, too.<eos> It they haven't already.<eos> What?<eos> Feeling paranoid?<eos> On edge?
Shoot.<eos> German.<eos> I can't be late.<eos> Uh... We should get coffee or something sometime.<eos> Monet's?
Do we look dumb?<eos> No.<eos> I mean, no.<eos> Have you ever heard of the male gaze?<eos> The...?
I mean...<eos> It made me sad.<eos> Why didn't you just tell me?<eos> Maybe I was afraid of something like this.<eos> Something like what?
- Hey, Jess.<eos> - Hey. Mrs. Antilly?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Everything okay?<eos> What, like in the world?
Or with you.<eos> Yeah.<eos> You could drop by our office later, if you want to make a full report.<eos> Our office?<eos> Monet's.
Our office?<eos> Monet's.<eos> Oh. Yeah, right.<eos> I forgot about that.<eos> The office thing.
I'm recruiting Clay for the Illuminati.<eos> You want to join? Alex, you should not joke about the Illuminati, first of all.<eos> Trust me.<eos> What are you guys talking about?<eos> Homework.
I wish there was a button to fast-forward you through all the shitty parts in life straight to the good parts.<eos> And where are the good parts?<eos> College.<eos> In New York City.<eos> Why New York?
There's nothing to be scared of.<eos> - Justin!<eos> - Uh, hey, Coach.<eos> Missed you at the pep rally.<eos> And at practice.
Clay Jensen.<eos> You do look familiar, though.<eos> You two worked together?<eos> Right.<eos> At the Crestmont.
Right.<eos> At the Crestmont.<eos> I wonder if she said anything to you.<eos> Did she ever talk to you about her experiences at school?<eos> Uh, experiences?
Shut up, wait.<eos> So the whole Justin thing was just a rumor?<eos> I totally thought you guys went to third.<eos> Nope.<eos> Just first.
You work at a high school.<eos> The school I transferred from, kids shot kids.<eos> Pants I don't know.<eos> They just... they just pulled my pants down.<eos> - In the middle of the hallway.
Hey.<eos> That seat's taken.<eos> Yeah, by me.<eos> Talk to me.<eos> About what?
Remember Strictly Ballroom?<eos> Oh, my God, I love that movie.<eos> "There are no new steps!"<eos> You lied to me.<eos> - What?
Which is exactly what we don't need right now.<eos> Well, Alex started it, but ended up getting hurt pretty bad.<eos> This was in front of the library?<eos> This was down in the street, by the tennis courts.<eos> But in the street?
That's right.<eos> Don't adjust your...<eos> whatever device you're hearing this on.<eos> It's me.<eos> Live and in stereo.
I thought you'd be here.<eos> I think I will join you.<eos> I found Jeff.<eos> I was the first person at that accident, and I found him.<eos> In his car.
You were doing what she told you to do.<eos> No, I ran.<eos> I was scared.<eos> I thought it was something I had done or something I didn't understand, because I'm this fucking loser who doesn't know anything about girls<eos> - or about life or anything.
The Bakers' lawyer got a judge to fast-track the case.<eos> The school offered a settlement.<eos> The Bakers turned it down today.<eos> Things are going to be moving quickly from now on.<eos> To trial?
"Best of, worst of" thing.<eos> And people have been reacting to it ever since.<eos> When was the last time?<eos> A week ago.<eos> At a party.
He has everything he came for?<eos> We were at the camp.<eos> They told me you brought the cache to ransom for her life.<eos> It's in the ground.<eos> Ashore.
And then what does it matter if it was true when it was born?<eos> It's found truth in its maturity, which if a virtue in man ought to be no less so for the things men create.<eos> As this relates to your question specifically...<eos> I'm sorry. Remind me, what was your question, specifically?<eos> - Long John Silver. - Long John Silver, yes.
What... What does that even mean, Tara?<eos> It means we've got the numbers to fight now.<eos> We just need to find some guns and...<eos> Do you know where we could find that many guns today?<eos> This week?
It means we've got the numbers to fight now.<eos> We just need to find some guns and...<eos> Do you know where we could find that many guns today?<eos> This week?<eos> This year?
I'll soon be dead<eos> Leave this gang behind<eos> Please buy me a fine white suit to wear<eos> For I'll soon be sleeping<eos> In the cold, dead ground
- Ah but you went?<eos> - We had some meetings.<eos> - The next day.<eos> Potential investors.<eos> - In Cabo?
- I'm sorry I just--<eos> - She's real sweet, Nikki.<eos> We're in, you know--<eos> - You meet her at work?<eos> - At work yeah.
Nobody.<eos> Could he have anything to do with the dead man?<eos> I'll find out.<eos> - How is she?<eos> - Afloat.
Drinks scotch.<eos> Lots of it.<eos> What do you know about him?<eos> Talks a lot.<eos> - What about?
Shoot you!<eos> I'm Rune Lennox's big sister.<eos> I know.<eos> I found this in Laszlo Hindemith's house.<eos> In his room.
There's a bear.<eos> Where... the playground?<eos> No.<eos> Inside.<eos> Inside?
Again.<eos> Vincent. This isn't it happening again, this isn't what your so frightened of.<eos> I know what you think.<eos> This isn't it!<eos> What?
No, don't.<eos> Shh.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> I am going to sell the Muriel for scrap.<eos> To Bergson.
I think he was watching us.<eos> Err, it's just probably routine.<eos> I bet you anything they watch all the unemployed governors and bankrupt trawlermen that pass through.<eos> You were always good at that.<eos> - What?
You brought me here.<eos> Brought you?<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> Just now.<eos> In your dream.
No.<eos> All good.<eos> What about the abdomen, generally?<eos> Never better.<eos> Generally.
Gordon, how are you?<eos> Hey.<eos> We'll... we'll talk more.<eos> What... what did you guys talk about?<eos> Nothing.
Come on.<eos> Come on.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Excuse me!<eos> in our town, okay?
What?<eos> !<eos> Wishes do come true!<eos> Mary and me were in "Huatemala."<eos> - "Huatemala"?
Yeah, she's good.<eos> You think I was too hard on him?<eos> Irv?<eos> Ray.<eos> At the anniversary party.
What they call "plausible."<eos> 'Cause if we...<eos> Look, if Irv's right, and we...<eos> Then we know.<eos> Which, in a court of law...
Some kinda freak accident.<eos> Air conditioner fell on him, just...<eos> Like a pancake.<eos> And him on parole for some pretty nasty stuff, too.<eos> Not in front of the boy.
Books under the floorboards, an unapproved trip to goddamn Hollywood.<eos> Told you.<eos> I'm paying for that myself.<eos> Not the point.<eos> Not the...
Not a literal oath, I'll give you that, but implied.<eos> For Pete's sake, it's right there in the handbook.<eos> Don't bang the cattle.<eos> First off, there's probably broken glass down there.<eos> Second...
He told his followers that he wanted to be buried there.<eos> The master of the field.<eos> His soul, he said, would bind and comfort theirs.<eos> Have you been to this place before?<eos> The bowling alley?
Something to stop the engines racing.<eos> Now...<eos> I want you to picture an island.<eos> Tropical island, somewhere warm.<eos> South pacific, perhaps.
Sure, we'll have you back.<eos> Look, I understand you got threads to pull.<eos> I'm on the job, too, in probationary guise, but, still, we're both officers of the court.<eos> Got yourself fired yesterday is how I heard it.<eos> Just now at your office.
How many partners do you have?<eos> Just how much time...<eos> Like I said, this is just a baby step.<eos> I'll park myself in an office, you know, do a few interviews, maybe look over your books.<eos> An office?
We can't...<eos> The jig is up.<eos> This isn't...<eos> He's gonna park himself in an office.<eos> An office!
-Manhunt's over.<eos> -There was a manhunt?<eos> -Yeah.<eos> For, like, 30 minutes.<eos> Real exciting.
I got... hold on.<eos> I got different facts.<eos> Maurice lefay's fingerprints-- he confessed.<eos> My guy. In the car ride over.<eos> All four murders.
- What do you sell, Mr...<eos> - Rand.<eos> Daniel.<eos> I sell accounting software.<eos> In Brussels.
Think "snow."<eos> Think "snow."<eos> - Snow?<eos> - Snow.<eos> Yeah, snow.
Not yet.<eos> This is the only country in the world that wonders what it is.<eos> You've been to a lot of other countries, have you?<eos> No.<eos> No, never, just this one.
Who's this?<eos> Your parole officer.<eos> Hi Mr. Bagwell.<eos> Are you aware we have a problem?<eos> No, no. I...
- No, I don't.<eos> - Seriously?<eos> - Seriously.<eos> You locked me in the safe.<eos> The office safe?
She's right there.<eos> She takes my hand. She tells me,<eos> "you belong with me."<eos> I'm pretty sure I don't belong here.<eos> This ship.
She's the defendant's sister.<eos> Not a credible witness either.<eos> This isn't the arrangement we made, Carrie.<eos> - What do you mean?<eos> - Our partnership.
Your Honor, Mr. Mahsud has been the key resource in several federal prosecutions.<eos> Lives have been saved.<eos> His ability to continue that important work depends on his identity remaining a closely held secret.<eos> - I need to talk to you.<eos> - What secret?
Entrapped?<eos> Are you kidding?<eos> How do you think we found this shithead?<eos> Randomly?<eos> In a phone book?
I call it a start.<eos> Come on.<eos> We got to bring up the offer with Sekou.<eos> Sir, do you know where you are?<eos> On the floor.
Can we get you anything?<eos> Uh, just some water.<eos> Thanks.<eos> It's about to get real now.<eos> Not just campaign talk.
Yeah, we all are.<eos> That's why I'm here.<eos> Stop lying!<eos> I know why you're here, and I know about the gang in Pittsburgh.<eos> - What gang?
No, I-I didn't want to.<eos> Of course.<eos> But I do now.<eos> It was in Berlin.<eos> In a barracks in Dahlem.
Ma'am.<eos> Carrie, thank you for coming so quickly.<eos> Of course.<eos> Is there a problem?<eos> Your friend Dar Adal.
We're talking wholesale reform of the CIA.<eos> Not for the faint of heart.<eos> - I know.<eos> - Your reforms, Carrie.<eos> - Your ideas.
It's meant to shock people, wake them up to what's happening in the Middle East.<eos> If somebody breaks in your home, logic dictates you do whatever it takes to get them out.<eos> You have no idea who I am, do you?<eos> I'm just some blonde lady who works with Reda.<eos> Basically.
- She's expecting me.<eos> - Just a second, sir.<eos> How did you get this address?<eos> From the e-mail.<eos> What e-mail?
Who was in the pickup, the one you drove up in?<eos> She prefers to remain anonymous.<eos> But I'm grateful to her.<eos> We had a very interesting talk.<eos> - About what?
She prefers to remain anonymous.<eos> But I'm grateful to her.<eos> We had a very interesting talk.<eos> - About what?<eos> - Our sons.
You've got the fight of your life.<eos> No one has taken responsibility for the attack, but investigators are treating this incident an act of terrorism.<eos> We should know more after - the NYPD's investigation. - Ma'am.<eos> Your ride is inbound, ma'am.<eos> - Just a few minutes away.
Well, he may not be the only one.<eos> Because afterward, I'm shredding documents and I see it-- a gold pack of Nafisi's cigarettes in a place it couldn't possibly be-- a room we used only for surveillance, a room Nafisi never set foot in.<eos> At least not while I was there.<eos> And you think...<eos> The obvious.
Mm-hmm. Yes.<eos> It was a very difficult time for us as a family.<eos> He was doing what he believed was right, and I was doing what I believed was right.<eos> When was the last time you saw him?<eos> 2007, in Baghdad.
What was it again?<eos> "The Angel of Death"?<eos> "The Drone Queen."<eos> Yeah.<eos> And in Berlin?
Carrie ordered the doctors to wake you up.<eos> She did this despite repeated warnings about the risks of the procedure.<eos> She thought you might have information on the terror cell that was plotting the attack on Hauptbahnhof.<eos> She was wrong.<eos> W-What risks?
What's the issue?<eos> There were some irregularities during his interview.<eos> Evasiveness.<eos> - About?<eos> - A one-year gap on his resume.
Shall we?<eos> - Shouldn't we wait for Saul?<eos> - He'll be in later.<eos> So, the, President-Elect told me about Dar's efforts to falsify intelligence on Iran, plus his possible role in the recent bombing.<eos> - More than possible.
Just answer the damn thing.<eos> - Hello?<eos> - Carrie Mathison?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Hi.
You know that.<eos> I don't.<eos> I got you out of lockup.<eos> So you knew where I was.<eos> In a safe place.
Well, where do you think I got it?<eos> We just shot it... me and Peter did.<eos> When?<eos> Just now, like, an hour ago.<eos> At Bellevue?
You can go right in.<eos> - Carrie.<eos> - Madam President.<eos> David and I were just speaking about you.<eos> In glowing terms.
Believe me.<eos> It was never my intention for things to turn so dark.<eos> Ultimately, I lost control of what I set in motion.<eos> You remember what Graham Greene said, don't you?<eos> About what?
It was never my intention for things to turn so dark.<eos> Ultimately, I lost control of what I set in motion.<eos> You remember what Graham Greene said, don't you?<eos> About what?<eos> The secret services.
Sorry.<eos> Fucking drop foot.<eos> At least you're up and walking.<eos> Hell of a lot better than when I saw you in May.<eos> May?
Fucking drop foot.<eos> At least you're up and walking.<eos> Hell of a lot better than when I saw you in May.<eos> May?<eos> In the hospital.
Hey, there. This is Bill.<eos> I just want to say--<eos> Hang on, Bill.<eos> Are you real?<eos> What?
Fell off the stage.<eos> Um... let's take a look here, shall we?<eos> So, Dustin, you're a... dancer?<eos> Stripper. Yeah.<eos> Down at Lumberjaxxx.
You're gonna be fine.<eos> It's not me I'm worried about. It's that girl.<eos> Could you get that for me?<eos> That could be the sitter.<eos> Other pocket.
It's not me I'm worried about. It's that girl.<eos> Could you get that for me?<eos> That could be the sitter.<eos> Other pocket.<eos> Other pocket.
Surgically speaking.<eos> Well, do I go towards them or run like hell?<eos> You stay away.<eos> Stay away from the carotid artery.<eos> Oh, God.
Well, that's fine. It's not uncommon.<eos> It's probably wise. John, throw out this week's filter floor plan and just get into the nitty-gritty of our systemized nonfiltered diffusion.<eos> Can you give us a sec?<eos> I just want to... I don't want to overstep my... I want to hone in on this with Leslie so we don't land on any unsustainable or, unavailable,<eos> sss... products along our line.
If you wanna take your money in the box with you, that's fine.<eos> Some folks worry that we're gonna run off with it while they're inside.<eos> No, I trust you.<eos> Hi.<eos> Hey.
We're authorized.<eos> They don't care.<eos> Where can we land?<eos> Tasmania.<eos> Tasmania? !
- Become him!<eos> Become him!<eos> - Become him! - Become him!<eos> Become him!<eos> - In darkest Tijuana...
Jesus, Matt.<eos> You look terrible.<eos> I'm fine.<eos> I just need to speak to Michael and John.<eos> - About what?
- It doesn't exist.<eos> - It does exist!<eos> I remember it!<eos> It had a mannequin that had this hat that made it come to life and there was a goose on a rainbow and this creepy guy puppet that, like, worked at a department store.<eos> "Today's Special."
Just stick me in the corner of the bedroom or something.<eos> - I'll get it.<eos> - No, she'll settle.<eos> Okay, I'll stuff you.<eos> On one condition.
- And yet here you are.<eos> Knowing full well what is inside of you, you kept moving forward towards this very room and the one person powerful enough to take it out.<eos> I think you should tell him about the book you wrote.<eos> What book?<eos> The romance novel.
We only talked a couple times, really.<eos> There was this dance, a Christmas dance at the high school.<eos> We just had a really nice conversation.<eos> Yeah.<eos> In the hallway.
Everything I told you about Jill and Tommy... my father.<eos> Did you move back to Mapleton?<eos> No.<eos> Still in Jarden.<eos> In our house.
Go out there and put forth the word.<eos> If Billy isn't in this room within the hour, I promise him... he will regret it.<eos> You heard him.<eos> Sails!<eos> South-southwest!
- I will see to it.<eos> - I should fucking hope so.<eos> Is everyone feeling better... now they've got that off their chests?<eos> I ask as I'm wondering when would be a good time for us to talk about Max.<eos> What about her?
Max fucked us.<eos> If it wasn't for her, we likely take Nassau whole, fleet intact, no prisoners in the fort, no fight between you and I.<eos> Instead, here we are.<eos> Now, one would think we could go a long way towards soothing all that chaos out there, and the anger driving it... if we could draw everyone together to see justice done to the one responsible for all of it.<eos> - All of it?

Get a move on.<eos> The troupe will be here at 7:00.<eos> And in the meantime, I will be up in...<eos> Can you guess?<eos> Your secret tower room?
And in the meantime, I will be up in...<eos> Can you guess?<eos> Your secret tower room?<eos> Wrong!<eos> My secret tower room.
A ringleader of the pirate militia.<eos> He surrendered himself.<eos> Said he would only speak with you directly.<eos> Speak with me?<eos> About what?
What is that?<eos> Terms.<eos> When this is through, you'll present this to your people and advocate to accept them.<eos> Every fugitive slave in your camp will receive their immediate emancipation.<eos> With one condition.
Well, you better tell them the rest.<eos> Uh... we are getting married... tonight.<eos> - What?<eos> - Right here.<eos> In the living room.
Croome may not be as dangerous as the rest of them, but in the end he's just as cold-blooded.<eos> Jonas.<eos> Oh, my God, it's so good.<eos> Mm. She used to own a restaurant.<eos> Down in Busan.
- Um, if you will please excuse me.<eos> - Sure.<eos> Hi!<eos> Hi.<eos> Why bathrooms?
Bug's been a bud for a while.<eos> We know what you did for him.<eos> When he told us about your troubles, we looked into it, shall we say... anonymously. - And what did you find?<eos> - How many languages do you speak?<eos> Seven.
- How?<eos> - We don't know.<eos> They have more money and more autonomy than any other group we've come across.<eos> But ultimately, all that power testifies to one thing.<eos> - What?
Please be careful.<eos> I will.<eos> Ma'am! He's in a meeting.<eos> This is more important.<eos> - Less humid in those countries.
When you get elected, I hope you don't forget about your friends.<eos> - You all right?<eos> - I used to feel so sure.<eos> Of what?<eos> Of everything.
What happened?<eos> Shock brought on by septicemia.<eos> We think he fell. Hurt himself.<eos> I found him on the floor.<eos> On the floor?
Especially the stuff about my sister.<eos> I admit, I wanted to run away and... let everyone forget the name Bak.<eos> But then...<eos> I think about him.<eos> My dad.
But Will's not here.<eos> He ain't fucking here.<eos> Should a man in his condition really be drinking?<eos> I found him on the floor.<eos> On the floor?
All employees will be issued magnetic ID bracelets that will be necessary for entry and exit through the turnstiles.<eos> People ask me what money can't buy.<eos> In public, I say some sort of bullshit like,<eos> "Love and its many splendored so forth."<eos> The real answer...
And if you still hope to get Wendy back somehow, I don't see how this can help.<eos> You said you had some information on that front.<eos> Wendy and Rhoades remain separated.<eos> Where is he living?<eos> The house.
Let's switch gears for a moment.<eos> Tell me about your meeting with Axelrod.<eos> The aborted settlement?<eos> No.<eos> Your private meeting.
So, I'm going through my initial round of interviews and all seems, uh, if not kosher, then at least within a reasonable bandwidth.<eos> And I'm thinking, you know, I'm just about out of here.<eos> Uh-huh. But...<eos> Then I become aware of a payment.<eos> A payment?
(door opens) Bay: Oh, my god, what's going on?<eos> Are you okay?<eos> - Uh, okay.<eos> - (soft rock music playing)<eos> About what?
Hear me out, okay?<eos> I'm not asking to work on customers, just one of my friends.<eos> In my shop, using my machines.<eos> I've done this before, dozens of times.<eos> In another country.
I didn't ask for your help.<eos> Stop trying to be the great white hope, okay?<eos> I can handle this.<eos> Oh, you mean rip off Noelle's work?<eos> No way.
Excellent, Morse.<eos> Excellent.<eos> - What's wrong with your breakfast?<eos> - There's nothing wrong with it.<eos> Just not in the mood this morning.
Our safety records are spotless.<eos> I've been here eight years, and we've never had nothing like this happen before.<eos> In 1959, nobody died.<eos> - In 1960, nobody died.<eos> In 1961...
Come here.<eos> This story, where did you get it?<eos> Straight from the horse's mouth.<eos> Morse told me at the drinks last night.<eos> In confidence.
I see.<eos> Comes to booze, Kent's a bit of an amateur.<eos> I wouldn't have said he was in a state to drive anywhere, let alone kill anyone.<eos> Binsey, you say, Tessa was found?<eos> Yes, a house out that way.
What about the boy?<eos> Alexander?<eos> No.<eos> Been there recently?<eos> Binsey?
I couldn't get a call out.<eos> What kind of engineer needs a panic room?<eos> Good question.<eos> I'm not supposed to talk about this... but I'm on a list.<eos> What kind of list?
Listen to me, Maddie.<eos> Um, I just got off the phone with Will.<eos> Something's happening.<eos> - Where?<eos> - In the city.
Which, by the way, you are never going to get.<eos> Oh, yeah?<eos> Even if you have to hide them some place very private?<eos> And warm.<eos> And wet.
Come on in.<eos> We're shocking the monkey.<eos> Trying another spot.<eos> Nothing.<eos> Not even at a cellular level.
Okay.<eos> Whitespire it is.<eos> Come on, everybody.<eos> Grab snacks.<eos> Yeah, uh, about that.
All right, you never met me.<eos> 'Ello.<eos> I'm Dev from Devonshire.<eos> I drive a Jaguar, and I live in Buckingham Palace.<eos> Buckingham Palace?
I'm simply asking.<eos> My father was a salesman.<eos> He was never much good at it.<eos> He had a talent for disappointment that made me even more determined to succeed.<eos> At what?
Known her since we were in Mogadishu together 15 years ago.<eos> Now she's sending me an emergency message from a stolen phone, calling me to one of our old dead letter drops.<eos> This from one of the best intelligence officers I know who, believe me, has never been one to cry wolf.<eos> We have eyes.<eos> In position.
Tell your buddies no heroics, Germany.<eos> Copy that, Lucas is, still on the street.<eos> We just lost the cameras.<eos> - Where's the power source?<eos> - Basement.
If ever someone was put on this planet for the sole purpose of caring for others, it was Cali Mills.<eos> We got us some tourists in town.<eos> - Where?<eos> - A block from the house.<eos> Black panel van.
Hi.<eos> - Asha.<eos> - Right.<eos> Sorry, um... I... I just wanted to tell you that Cali never stopped talking about you.<eos> - Oh. - Her war hero brother.
- I got one in the leg.<eos> I'll be okay.<eos> Went straight through.<eos> - Where are you?<eos> - Some hotel in Jersey.
You honestly think I know where Carlos Mejia is?<eos> I think you can do better than that.<eos> My only contact with the cartel is a lawyer.<eos> - Where?<eos> - New York.
I'm okay.<eos> I'm not in pain.<eos> Okay?<eos> I'm okay.<eos> Okay.
I surely do.<eos> Where is everybody, Mama?<eos> I'm here.<eos> I mean Daddy.<eos> Rotary Club.
Do you at least have money for your taxi fare?<eos> I'm asking the cabbie to stop at Ziegler's Jewellers.<eos> These got me into this mess -- they can get me out of it.<eos> Taxi fare, new locks, solicitor.<eos> In that order.
Is there CCTV anywhere else?<eos> Any other security?<eos> There's the swipe system.<eos> Swipe?<eos> On the door.
Untoward?<eos> Or just a normal morning at the office?<eos> I haven't been to the office yet.<eos> Oh. I've been doing a little digging into our mayor.<eos> The mayor?
I see us raising our children here, and our children's children, and celebrating banquets of our own in this very hall for many, many, many, many years to come.<eos> I want to ride our horses out to the Corona wall together each and every morning until we're both very, very old and gray.<eos> I love you, Rapunzel, and I want to spend the rest of our lives here together.<eos> Here?<eos> In this... castle forever?
She studied abroad her junior year.<eos> And she lives in a loft on the river in Fishtown.<eos> That's some pretty spendy real estate.<eos> She's a bank teller?<eos> Well, private client banking.
She checked into a charity gala for the Manhattan Children's Hospital two days ago.<eos> Didn't the Congressman's daughter wear Hanna's dress to that?<eos> Senator's daughter.<eos> There, look.<eos> In the corner.
That's impressive.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Seriously, I needed this.<eos> I needed to win...<eos> On an existential level.
The entire Radley crew is held hostage in a room for an hour and told to smile more.<eos> Even if no one in the hotel sees her the security cameras will.<eos> No, they won't.<eos> We thought we'd start things off with the press event here.<eos> In your book store.
- Yeah?<eos> - You need to see this.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Where'd you find it?<eos> Shower drain.
You know, don't you?<eos> If Hanna doesn't want you to know...<eos> I know this is about the death of Dunhill.<eos> Is Hanna covering for someone?<eos> - Actually...
But tonight...<eos> I'm just gonna be happy that you have found a man who loves you and wants to protect you.<eos> And I can't wait for him to be a part of our family.<eos> Mom, you're gonna have to wait 12 hours.<eos> Actually...
- No... don't.<eos> Just don't tell your parents anything.<eos> We may be a lot closer than you think.<eos> Just... just give Mona chance to figure this out.<eos> Mona?
Hanna!<eos> Mona killed Charlotte.<eos> We're gonna take her to the cops?<eos> No.<eos> Not in this condition.
Even your most mundane actions.<eos> Like the zoo.<eos> What's with you and the zoo?<eos> I had to know everything about the man who wore his plans on his skin.<eos> In plain sight, yet so mysterious.
Get ready.<eos> - All right, ready?<eos> - Mm-hmm.<eos> 280 for the pork, 350 for the buttered noodles, 125 for the buttered beans, 150 for the roll, and 50...<eos> No, 75 for butter.
Okay, kiddo.<eos> Glad you're here.<eos> I didn't mean it.<eos> I... I mean, I didn't mean for my drawings to do what they did.<eos> - What? - On Tumblr.
Keep this to yourself and I'll get you some laxatives.<eos> - I don't... I don't use...<eos> - Come on, I know you want them.<eos> You think I haven't seen that thing that you do?<eos> What thing?
Making sure your arm doesn't get bigger than, what, a silver dollar?<eos> Deal.<eos> Cigarette for dinner.<eos> - That's not gonna get you points.<eos> - Not in the mood.
- Ranger talk?<eos> Yeah. 3:30 till 4:00.<eos> Kids loved her.<eos> Did she mention anything unusual?<eos> Any worries?
No.<eos> Why, are you saying it was deliberate?<eos> Well, that's just what we're trying to find out.<eos> Did she mention any problems with her relationship?<eos> - Work?
That sounds doable.<eos> Then dumped the boat, make it look like an accident.<eos> So how did they get themselves back to the mainland?<eos> Hm? Swim?<eos> Not in that current.
- No.<eos> - I did.<eos> I watched the lunchtime boat come in while you were in the bathroom.<eos> Gemma got on and started arguing with the guy driving it.<eos> - What about?
That's not nothing.<eos> It's not against the law, either.<eos> - We need to speak to you down at the station.<eos> - I can't come now.<eos> About that footage.
Don't you wanna get out of here?<eos> Yeah.<eos> But I have to learn how to control my power first.<eos> And it's a relief to be in a place where I don't have to keep it a secret.<eos> Secret?
You finally saw the master,<eos> I thought you'd be happy.<eos> Let me guess, she didn't give you the answers you wanted.<eos> Have you been reporting on me this whole time?<eos> All of our conversations?
Take him.<eos> Take Henry and go.<eos> I love you, sunny.<eos> Take care of our son.<eos> Our son.
I'm only doing this for the money.<eos> Don't think you and I are suddenly good.<eos> You just deliver me the sheik.<eos> The sheiks are well away from here.<eos> High desert.
A man who knows your friend there more than anyone in this prison.<eos> I was in solitary with him<eos> - for years.<eos> - Yeah, so was I.<eos> But not in the cell across from him.
They're investigating Annalise.<eos> You tell them anything?<eos> No.<eos> But I might.<eos> About...?
You ruined his life.<eos> You did this.<eos> Burned this poor boy alive.<eos> Just think about the pain that he felt as he died.<eos> The agony...
I remember something else from that night.<eos> The doctors said that it would happen, that the drugs would... wear off and that I would remember things.<eos> I, uh, saw Frank... before the explosion.<eos> Where?<eos> In the basement.
You think Ingrid Peters is gonna take Keating's accusations seriously?<eos> She better.<eos> Otherwise, we'll take it to the FBI.<eos> There are bodies piling up around this woman, and you think she deserves justice?<eos> - Renee...
Is everything okay?<eos> That depends.<eos> On...?<eos> If we're still good.<eos> "Good"?
You, you're just going to die.<eos> ISIL has broken through the checkpoints.<eos> They're coming into the city.<eos> These uniforms are like targets<eos> - on our backs.
We shouldn't even be talking about this.<eos> Get off me!<eos> How are you alive?<eos> !<eos> In Yemen?
Deliver my second vehicle, and maybe I get the Phaeacians to get you a boat somewhere, to Europe, France, Italy, Spain, wherever you want to go.<eos> How's that sound?<eos> Keys are here.<eos> Left side, the red brick.<eos> First floor.
Okay, you want to put new eyes on this?<eos> Fine.<eos> Now that you report to me, I need you to look into the possibility that there was an insider involved.<eos> Here?<eos> At the State Department?
Will do, ma'am.<eos> Agent Kishida.<eos> I wasn't expecting a call at this hour.<eos> I just wanted to follow up on our earlier conversation.<eos> The situation in the Middle East?
I wasn't crazy.<eos> I caught him lying, but he-he-- oh, god, he covered it so well.<eos> He was... honest and hurt, and I bought it.<eos> Who is he?<eos> Really?
No new plan.<eos> Just get tired of looking at empty skin.<eos> Uh-huh. You know, it was those tats at Fox River that caught my eye in the first place.<eos> I had to know everything about the man who wore his plans on his skin.<eos> In plain sight yet so mysterious.
- What do you mean you couldn't see her?<eos> There's no way we could have.<eos> Oh, my God. Sara.<eos> There was no one<eos> - in the backseat?
Kim, let me set the stage for you, okay?<eos> When I went to chuck's place last week, It was like the inside of a jiffy pop wrapper, All right?<eos> There was mylar on the walls.<eos> - There was mylar on the ceiling...<eos> - The ceiling.
She's hurt pretty badly, but she's gonna pull through.<eos> It's nice to hear something positive.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Mom.<eos> About Idris...
You moved your stuff back to the boat basin?<eos> Turns out being a vampire who only drinks blood doesn't jive really well with a Jewish mother who's always trying to feed you. She doesn't remember you coming home?<eos> Seems a bit much to wipe her memory.<eos> Well, she saw me... um, in an awkward situation.<eos> What situation?
I always knew I couldn't have what I wanted... until you came along.<eos> Nothing's wrong with you.<eos> Far from it.<eos> But you're so... innocent.<eos> In some ways, but...
I would rather die than let Valentine destroy the Downworld.<eos> I need you to promise me.<eos> If Valentine ever gets to me...<eos> No.<eos> Absolutely not.
Angels are higher beings.<eos> They communicate through metaphors.<eos> Morgenstern means "morning star," as in, "how are thou fallen from heaven", "O, Lucifer, son of the morning."<eos> The vision seems to be speaking of a...<eos> Demonic morgenstern.
Magnus...<eos> I love you.<eos> I love you, too.<eos> Alaric.<eos> Oh, man.
And I just handed them over the medallion.<eos> Whoa, in exchange for Grey's life.<eos> Any one of us would have made that call.<eos> Would Rip?<eos> So much for sunny California.
I'm not a shr...<eos> You know, I think I've heard enough on that subject.<eos> Now, when did you first encounter the apparition?<eos> The ghost of Mr. Snart, when did he first appear?<eos> Back in Chicago.
You're telling me I have an antenna in my head.<eos> Well, the good news is you're not crazy.<eos> Oh, really?<eos> So, seeing and talking to Snart's real?<eos> Well, in a sense, yes.
The spear is the MacGuffin.<eos> The what?<eos> The thing in the movie that everyone's trying to get.<eos> - Well, where is it?<eos> - In the movie?
How are you feeling?<eos> Have you seen our mutual friend around lately?<eos> No.<eos> That's because you took the chip out.<eos> Well, actually...
We're now all equally dead.<eos> Oh, I wouldn't worry about that.<eos> This isn't the first scary speedster that we had to put in his place.<eos> We're gonna get you out of this bank vault, Eobard.<eos> But on one condition.
After 5 years in Hell, I returned home with only one goal-- to save my city.<eos> Today, I fight that war on two fronts. By day, I lead Star City as its mayor, but by night, I am someone else.<eos> I am... Something else.<eos> I am the Green Arrow.<eos> Previously on "Arrow"...
- Goth? - Mm-hmm.<eos> Dark hair, dark Felicity, taking on corporations and governments.<eos> It was a power trip that wasn't healthy.<eos> What's "IRL"?<eos> In real life.
Are you kidding me?<eos> I hacked all the traffic cams in my hometown on a dare.<eos> So this is gonna help us find miss loco bananas?<eos> Or Sonus.<eos> Either way--
Well, maybe I was wrong.<eos> Maybe you're my second chance.<eos> That's a lot to put on my shoulders.<eos> Well, Tina, there's something that tells me you can handle it.<eos> So about that name.
Da.<eos> In two days.<eos> The RPG that took out the plane came from over there, and the call from my son originated just west of here.<eos> Hostages could be in either place.<eos> Or neither.
Why does Chase do anything?<eos> So far, he hasn't laid out a single hoop you could keep yourself from jumping through.<eos> Maybe leaving me here was part of the plan.<eos> How'd Chase get you here?<eos> A plane.
Ohh! I love you!<eos> Oh, Oliver, I love you so much.<eos> You won.<eos> Your son has his father back, and he learned exactly who his father was just like you learned who your father was right here...<eos> On these very same waters.
Numbers say otherwise.<eos> You're a popular dude, Chief...<eos> South of I-10, east of the river,<eos> Westside, even the Valley.<eos> The Valley?
Anything to do with his service.<eos> No unit patches, no challenge coins, no souvenirs, no uniform, no beret.<eos> Just this one picture.<eos> He kept his things at The Bin.<eos> Downtown?
No unit patches, no challenge coins, no souvenirs, no uniform, no beret.<eos> Just this one picture.<eos> He kept his things at The Bin.<eos> Downtown?<eos> On Fifth Street?
Not yet.<eos> But, you know, these things take time.<eos> So if everyone involved in the accident takes the money, then Callie gets off.<eos> Hey, did you see Emma today?<eos> Uh, yeah, at school.
She seems very interested in your buns.<eos> What?<eos> I was actually just tellin' her that there's nothin' as sweet as you.<eos> Ugh! Hey, maybe you guys can date when I'm in Los Colinas.<eos> Women's prison?
Are we... good?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, of course.<eos> I was gonna ask you, I mean, are you really...<eos> - you okay?
Hoping like hell I can figure out how to fly a plane.<eos> - What?<eos> - I can't disarm the nuke, but hopefully I can get it to a less populated area.<eos> Less populated? Wha...<eos> like Havenrock?
My past doesn't have to be my anchor, and I think my past is what was... Stopping me from moving things forward with you.<eos> Looking at all this, I can understand why.<eos> What exactly happened to you on that island anyway?<eos> Things that I'm not ready to talk about.<eos> Not even this crazy tattoo?
They liked to mess around with it.<eos> I'm gonna head home.<eos> Yeah. You found a place to stay already?<eos> No. I'm, uh, just staying where you guys put me up.<eos> HIVE?
Thank you.<eos> Hey, man, my name's Rene Ramirez.<eos> I work for the deputy mayor.<eos> This is my assistant.<eos> In his dreams!
For the past 10 minutes, I've seen the same orderly pass by 5 times with an empty stretcher.<eos> Could be one of Gregor's men.<eos> At any rate, they know that you are back.<eos> Or they're just here to finish the job on you.<eos> Either way...
Really?<eos> Did you get fired today, too?<eos> What?<eos> My producer called me out on the carpet. Apparently, they received an anonymous tip that I have been plagiarizing my stories for the past two years, and my laptop is filled with incriminating evidence.<eos> Your laptop?
Disturbing souls at rest.<eos> This is how you get haunted.<eos> I feel a presence.<eos> Beta team in position.<eos> On site.
Does it involve offering up a sacrificial lamb?<eos> Either me or Detective Malone.<eos> Oliver, this impeachment is about punishing someone, and if you don't offer up a name, this will be the last time you're looking out that window.<eos> If the council's not gonna let me testify at the hearing, then I need to take my case directly to the public.<eos> - A press conference? - Yeah.
Today, I fight that war on two fronts.<eos> By day, I lead Star City as its mayor, but by night, I am someone else.<eos> I am... Something else.<eos> I am the Green Arrow.<eos> Previously on "Arrow"...
Neither is Cayden James.<eos> And you didn't tell us?<eos> I didn't think it was necessary.<eos> Where is he?<eos> At an off-books black site 12 miles away.

Well, fly home anytime you want, Anatoly.<eos> So you have irony back in America, yes?<eos> To do what I have to do, no one can know what I've been through.<eos> You mean in Russia?<eos> Russia, in Hong Kong.
Diggle?<eos> Felicity?<eos> We're ok. You ok?<eos> We're fine.<eos> A little north of pissed off, though.
Why would they take a cab?<eos> Hey.<eos> You took a cab so you wouldn't be followed, right?<eos> Two cabs, one train, and a little walking.<eos> Not in that order.
They are searching the hell out of that area.<eos> Well, that should keep 'em busy for a while.<eos> - We contacted HW.<eos> - Is anyone still alive?<eos> Not here in Portland.
- Careful.<eos> - They have found her head.<eos> - Not possible.<eos> - I fucking saw it.<eos> In a yellow bag.
Pretty slapdash.<eos> There was a disaster.<eos> 1942.<eos> Near Vukobejina.<eos> A weather station.
- Not to me?<eos> I shouldn't have lied to you.<eos> You were in so much trouble and when we brought the roof down on that glacier... lying to you seemed right.<eos> And you think I'm lying to you now.<eos> About my eyes.
Guy Molinari, what is your status?<eos> Ready for push-off on your command, Tycho.<eos> Rocinante, are you ready for launch?<eos> That's a roger, there, Tycho.<eos> On a wing and a prayer.
Just do what I said.<eos> What have we got here?<eos> Who's this?<eos> Rocinante, we got a body in an airlock down here.<eos> What airlock?
Diogo! I got a puncture, I need a hand!<eos> Dude, I got problems of my own!<eos> - Use the sealant...<eos> - I'm leaking air!<eos> In your chest pouch!
You're damn right, it will.<eos> Shall I meet them on the dock with guns?<eos> We'll start with conversation.<eos> Man : Prepare for dockingclampcapture.<eos> God!
Some sort of restraint?<eos> It's a rowan cross.<eos> "Rowan tree and red thread will tyne the witches speed."<eos> Oh, riddle-de-dee.<eos> In English, please.
I don't want to ruin my hair.<eos> Scott's corsage.<eos> Let's see it.<eos> Zelda, there's something we need to discuss, something Mama explained to me before my wedding night and I had to explain to Tilde.<eos> About your...
Scott's corsage.<eos> Let's see it.<eos> Zelda, there's something we need to discuss, something Mama explained to me before my wedding night and I had to explain to Tilde.<eos> About your...<eos> About your conjugal duties.
Let's see it.<eos> Zelda, there's something we need to discuss, something Mama explained to me before my wedding night and I had to explain to Tilde.<eos> About your...<eos> About your conjugal duties.<eos> My what?
Writing a memoir, I feel, is a debt that a president owes to history.<eos> - Amen.<eos> - Shh.<eos> And I'm doing my best to help the scholars of the future reckon with the Meyer years...<eos> Year.
You've got interviews the rest of the day, ma'am.<eos> Yeah, but you got to call Wilner at the "Times."<eos> "Indianapolis Times," got it.<eos> And "Time Magazine," let's get in touch with them because the world really needs to know...<eos> - About the gang bang thing? - Oh.
Wasn't I just so great?<eos> It was just really nice to see you out there again...<eos> - Sure.<eos> - you know, not just sitting in the house - in your bathrobe with Gary. - We played backgammon.<eos> - Or at the institution...
- Ma'am.<eos> - Yeah, that's it.<eos> All right, time to write this book.<eos> - Where were we?<eos> - First sentence.
Right now, they're sailing across the Narrow Sea, hoping to take back her father's throne.<eos> Our little brother, the one you love so much, the one you set free, the one who murdered our father and our first-born son, now he stands beside our enemies and gives them counsel.<eos> He's out there somewhere at the head of an armada.<eos> Where will they land?<eos> Dragonstone.
But I swear to you, she will pay for what she's done.<eos> And we will bring peace back to Westeros.<eos> Peace?<eos> Do you think that's what we had under your father?<eos> Or his father?
It's not even a contest.<eos> The monkey would bite the Rock's dick off.<eos> What if he wore a muzzle?<eos> Wait, on his dick?<eos> No, on his face.
We gave back.<eos> We gave them meaning.<eos> Then give it to them again.<eos> You're leaving?<eos> On a good line.
That means we know they exist.<eos> So what came first, gods or the people who believed in them?<eos> All right, so... where was all this before I met you?<eos> On the periphery, just outside, there's always a window, but people are frightened to look through it.<eos> Safer in the prison cell.
Where is everyone?<eos> Everyone in this particular town is a dedicated citizen.<eos> Dedicated to one sticky belief.<eos> America.<eos> Their America.
For five years, for 10 years, for life, you were sold to a captain and would ride his ship crowded tight as a slaver's.<eos> Off the ship you were sold as an indentured servant to the one who would take the cost of your skin out in your labor.<eos> But at least you were not waiting to hang in an English prison.<eos> And when your years of indenture were complete, you were free to make the best of your new world.<eos> Of the New World.
We're in prison, love.<eos> All we have to do is tell tales.<eos> You've told your share, I wager.<eos> I met an Indian woman there.<eos> In the Americas.
The night of Samhain, the spirits can spill freely into our world, but if you wear a disguise, like that, then they'll take you for one of their own.<eos> Horsies coming!<eos> Yes, your daddy's home.<eos> But we have to pay special mind of who?<eos> The lep...?
Horsies coming!<eos> Yes, your daddy's home.<eos> But we have to pay special mind of who?<eos> The lep...?<eos> Prechaun.
When I saw these numbers come in, I thought who better to help us capitalize on this than Margaret Hearst?<eos> The whole city... no, the whole country... watches her show.<eos> She can take you to a whole new level.<eos> Solidify your legacy on a national scale.<eos> "National scale"?
He's all yours.<eos> Let the record show that the trial of James Gordon has begun.<eos> Nathaniel Barnes presiding as judge, jury and executioner.<eos> Twinkle, twinkle, pretty doctor, how I wish I could unlock her.<eos> Here in Arkham, what a wonder.
And to the Court of Owls.<eos> Three years ago, a great crime was committed.<eos> Thomas and Martha Wayne were murdered.<eos> Their blood is on the Court's hands.<eos> On your hands.
Where's your far better half?<eos> Where you going, kitty cat?<eos> Bruce.<eos> What were you thinking about?<eos> My parents.
Will inspire some among you to join the scientific community as we strive to reach a new age for humanity.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You're very welcome.<eos> Okay, the quiche is in the oven; The beer and wine are in the fridge; And the candles are on the table.<eos> - My God.
Thank you.<eos> You're very welcome.<eos> Okay, the quiche is in the oven; The beer and wine are in the fridge; And the candles are on the table.<eos> - My God.<eos> My God. - What?
We depended on them.<eos> But with you, the roles are reversed.<eos> You depend on us.<eos> Harrison Wells was always there for me, so I guess in some weird way, I just... I want to be there for Harrison Wells.<eos> - Anyway... - Yeah.
A magician friend told me you kind of distract 'em and tag...<eos> I needed to know where she was so I could stay one step ahead of her.<eos> She is... - At the waterfront. - At the waterfront.<eos> What do you say?<eos> For Francisco?
- Sorry about that.<eos> I'm sorry, too.<eos> I'm sorry I took the smile from your face.<eos> What are you thinking about?<eos> The future.
- Wally?<eos> - I have to go.<eos> I can't let him get out.<eos> - What are you talking about?<eos> - Savitar.
Yeah, bet your ass, I do.<eos> No, I get it.<eos> I... I love it.<eos> I respect it. I'm a little worried though that, in your zeal for payback, you might be the one who ends up getting hurt.<eos> - On my Earth...
The same thing you were when you did it.<eos> Yeah, that was a mistake.<eos> One that I will never make again.<eos> Yeah, yeah, me either.<eos> Not on this Earth, anyway.
Look, J'onn, uh, I respect this whole special agent situation you got going on, but this problem right here needs someone with... green skin and sick-ass cape.<eos> Call me the Martian Manhunter.<eos> I think you'll find that J'onn's a lot more than... just a pretty face.<eos> Guys!<eos> Hello.

If I trapped him, I must've figured out who he was, right?<eos> Iris?<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Um, sorry, I was just thinking.<eos> About what?
Iris?<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Um, sorry, I was just thinking.<eos> About what?<eos> Same as you.
What are you doing?<eos> Um, sorry, I was just thinking.<eos> About what?<eos> Same as you.<eos> The future.

- Look, we could really use you.<eos> - Cisco... I mean it. Mirror Master and Top are not the only villains in the city.<eos> Barry, we don't have a Flash here.<eos> - Not anymore, okay?<eos> - Well, Cisco...
Her name's Tracy Brown.<eos> She made the Speed Force trap for me.<eos> You're telling me my ideas about the Speed Force...<eos> - I'm right?<eos> - In the future.

- Heat Monger.<eos> That is, until Flash here stopped him.<eos> What's Flash?<eos> Uh, ah, so what... what is the problem?<eos> Judge Hankerson.

You found a way to get us home.<eos> But... manipulating Lucifer and Chloe toward each other for our own gain...<eos> Your Father is the one that started all of this.<eos> We are simply bringing it to an end.<eos> On our terms.
Lucious, I wouldn't do nothing, man, I swear.<eos> Cookie, I found him! Look!<eos> Somebody posted a video on Snapchat of him and Tory Ash.<eos> They over in some dirty-ass neighborhood.<eos> Or some crack house.
I-I bumped it.<eos> No, I'm a klutz.<eos> It's okay. Look, I really need to tell you something, Angelo.<eos> Okay, but first we're gonna focus on us right now.<eos> Ooh.
Baby, Kennedy, stay right here.<eos> Hey, happy birthday, young buck.<eos> The house is packed. Think you should hang out a minute.<eos> The party don't stop for no man, you know that.<eos> All right, well, in that case...
Baby.<eos> Now her, too?<eos> Brah, this has been the worst birthday party of my life, man.<eos> You know why it's your fault?<eos> Because of lyrics like this.
I think you might be the only person that's ever played this old piano.<eos> Maybe it was put here just so I could write a song about you.<eos> That's hot.<eos> Who's it for?<eos> Nobody.
Ma, I love working with her. She's dope.<eos> It's just...<eos> I don't know.<eos> - I'm sick of you.<eos> - Sick of what, Ma?
I mean, I know... you never really wanted this.<eos> Since when is life about getting what you want?<eos> Mary?<eos> Where were you?<eos> Bathroom.
Ironic, seeing as it was made by an angel.<eos> There's only one angel Michael wanted to kill, and he wanted that son of a bitch to suffer.<eos> Ah, the magic.<eos> It's all in the runework.<eos> The craftsmanship.
Hey, we're here, Cass.<eos> We're right here, buddy.<eos> ♪ Ah, the magic.<eos> It's all in the runework.<eos> The craftsmanship.
First I've heard of it.<eos> Yeah.<eos> So tell us, what have you heard about black bill?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Black bill.
I mean, selling your soul at the crossroads kind of deal?<eos> So you guys were raised by a witch, but you're hunters.<eos> Yep.<eos> Dr. Hess wants to know everything about our "friends" the Winchesters...<eos> Their allies... their habits.
Reveal.<eos> Now!<eos> Reveal!<eos> The... The room, end of the hall.<eos> Top of the stairs.
I thought if I could put the Devil on a leash... my own personal nuke, no one would ever dare challenge me again.<eos> Yeah. That worked out great.<eos> All ended with me narrowly escaping death by hiding in a rat.<eos> Wait.<eos> In an...actual rat?
See you on the other side, boys.<eos> Aah!<eos> Well, that worked.<eos> Mature.<eos> Real mature!
- No, no, thank you, Vicar.<eos> Not into all that bullshit. No offence.<eos> Come on, Fred, playground.<eos> Yeah, come on.<eos> Porn on your phones.
- No, you didn't.<eos> - It had all your details on it.<eos> - Bollocks did it!<eos> I'm not good at that sort of stuff.<eos> What, people?
That's what you think, is it?<eos> Well, what good's it gonna do?<eos> - We owe her the truth.<eos> - Do we?<eos> Really?
Or he shagged...<eos> They shagged each other.<eos> She told me.<eos> - What was she thinking of? - Oh!<eos> Oh, my God.
- We'll need the shoes.<eos> - By the door.<eos> Why was there twine in your suit, Ed?<eos> I was working in the shop before I went to the party, catching up on things.<eos> - In your suit?
Condoms.<eos> I found them in my husband's car and with the receipt.<eos> I'm bringing them to you because I thought you should know.<eos> It's the time, you see.<eos> On the receipt.
Yeah. Leave you to settle in, give you some space.<eos> This is something we've gotta do.<eos> Miller?<eos> Do you know anything about this?<eos> All over the local social media.
Well, let's clear that up that confusion.<eos> What was it?<eos> At the party looking at Jim and Trish?<eos> Or on the road to Lyme with a passenger?<eos> Party.
That was it.<eos> Decision made.<eos> I was right, though, wasn't I?<eos> Well, you're always right.<eos> About pretty much everything.
Decision made.<eos> I was right, though, wasn't I?<eos> Well, you're always right.<eos> About pretty much everything.<eos> Not everything.
I was right, though, wasn't I?<eos> Well, you're always right.<eos> About pretty much everything.<eos> Not everything.<eos> But pretty much.
Help me!<eos> Dan... are you okay?<eos> For a while there, I could not remember anything.<eos> Oh. Everything feels like a dream.<eos> And not a good one.
Make your breathing a lot easier.<eos> Gives you strength.<eos> When was asthma diagnosed, Freya?<eos> In Tromso.<eos> Last year.
Nudism.<eos> Nugget.<eos> Nuptial."<eos> Uh-oh, gotta go.<eos> on the planet and...
The Baudelaires did not understand why they were now off toward an unknown relative instead of living with Justice Strauss.<eos> But as with so many unfortunate events in life, just because you don't understand it, doesn't mean it isn't so.<eos> Usually, our theatrical reviews are the most boring part of the paper.<eos> But I bet you little stage hogs are about to make the front page again.<eos> The front page!
Uncle Monty, I hope, once you get used to me.<eos> Monty, our parents never mentioned you.<eos> Really?<eos> Really.<eos> Dr. Montgomery Montgomery?
I decided to treat myself to some popcorn because there is nothing exciting happening in my life at all.<eos> Hey... Some popcorn actually sound delicious.<eos> I get popcorn for me, for all of us.<eos> My treat.<eos> - Really?
There are hundreds of zombies coming down from those snow banks!<eos> - ♪ They'll munch on your head ♪ - What? What's going on?<eos> And your poor mother's tutu.<eos> We've already seen this part!<eos> And in this snow bank...
- You mean... - That's right.<eos> I confronted him and threw him out of our lives forever.<eos> The authorities are on their way.<eos> And we're just leaving him there?<eos> In the parking lot?
You mean the hook-handed man who worked as my temporary secretary and broke the typewriter?<eos> - No.<eos> - Well, I've never met any others.<eos> Besides, I'm sure Count Olaf is hundreds of miles away.<eos> Or inches.
Oh, perhaps I should check on the children.<eos> Look over there!<eos> Where? What am I looking at?<eos> It's the incredibly deadly viper.<eos> In that cage?
She's next on the list.<eos> Mr. Poe, what can you tell us about your secretary?<eos> Oh, terrible disappointment.<eos> He turned out to be working for Count Olaf. Surely you remember.<eos> - No, your other secretary.
Mr. Poe, what can you tell us about your secretary?<eos> Oh, terrible disappointment.<eos> He turned out to be working for Count Olaf. Surely you remember.<eos> - No, your other secretary.<eos> - Who?
Snipers on the rooftops.<eos> Dogs on the ground.<eos> Crowdscanning tech even the conspiracy blogs don't know about yet.<eos> I can't make guarantees... But I can promise you this is the bestprotected event<eos> - in human history.
Preserve, protect, and defend...<eos> I am asking you. I am begging you.<eos> Do not shoot Mellie.<eos> Do not kill the President.<eos> Mellie?
Okay. Sure.<eos> I'll humor you.<eos> You're going to die.<eos> Tonight.<eos> Here in this room.
I've always believed that.<eos> And Luna with those blood stains on her dress?<eos> It's like Jackie Kennedy in her pink Chanel suit.<eos> Put her in the Oval, she'd be unstoppable.<eos> Anyway.
Most of it got diverted.<eos> Corrupt motherfuckers.<eos> Supposed to go for schools and sewers.<eos> Not to sound too sanctimonious, at lot of us lined up for our turn at the trough, too.<eos> How so?
- What are you talking about?<eos> - I bought it.<eos> You bought it?<eos> From where?<eos> Killer Sills'.
- If I'd known that this was gonna be...<eos> - I get it.<eos> - You know, the objective...<eos> - I get it.<eos> - Of the mission...
Like they all do.<eos> Must be something wrong with him.<eos> I'm beginning to think maybe it's me.<eos> Mnh-mnh. Okay, do you have any more paper towels?<eos> Yes. Bathroom cupboard.
Seriously?<eos> All right.<eos> Can't even dish the dirt with this guy.<eos> Isn't our business concluded?<eos> Yeah, even Steven.
She's no longer with us.<eos> She went to church every Sunday, but when the boys' choir sang, she would absolutely have to leave.<eos> Something about the frequency of their voices really did a number on her.<eos> - Well, that is a shame.<eos> - Indeed.
The first thing, I'm filing a motion to suppress that tape.<eos> The tape that Jimmy destroyed, you mean?<eos> How about we stop with the games?<eos> There's no way there isn't a duplicate.<eos> Really?
I guess they couldn't kill those for you.<eos> Well, they're not drawing much current, and they're far away.<eos> Intensity drops off with distance, per the inverse-square law.<eos> Okay, whoa!<eos> Inverse-square...
But if I do, you'll be the first person I call.<eos> Okay, ask away.<eos> You said you kept your husband's uniform.<eos> Was he on the job?<eos> On the job?
Is that what you're talking about?<eos> Kim... he had us in a corner, okay?<eos> - We did what we had to do.<eos> - But Rebecca... Everything that happened was his own fault.<eos> Everything.
No, ma'am.<eos> Nothing below the surface, like the...<eos> What... is it a drill bit?<eos> It would be the sucker rod at this point, but no, none of that.<eos> Only on the Texas side.
That was extremely uncomfortable.<eos> P-Probably almost a 9.<eos> What made it so important to talk to me that night?<eos> I'd had an incident.<eos> A very public incident.
Skylark is gone.<eos> Skylark is gone.<eos> Two for one! Two for one right here.<eos> There.<eos> Sun hat.
Step away, please.<eos> Your hands, so I can see them.<eos> I'm... I'm leaving.<eos> I don't want any trouble...<eos> Not on a college campus.
- Well done.<eos> - Finally...<eos> A year later.<eos> Have you met at this place before?<eos> - Always a different location.
- Who've died and are going to die.<eos> - You just did it again.<eos> - Who else have you told?<eos> - About Sangravan?<eos> About my daughter.
The white house.<eos> You're up early today.<eos> Sorry, I didn't mean to wake you.<eos> You know where the lid is?<eos> Clean.
Actually, I thought it was quite a bit more than just that.<eos> I am the one person who understands what you've gone through at the hands of this monster mejia.<eos> And now you're accusing me of betraying you?<eos> - Not betraying me.<eos> - So what, then?
Seven of them went to a phone in a mall in Arlington.<eos> Never gonna bring him to a mall.<eos> There's too many people.<eos> There's too many cameras.<eos> Not this one.
Where are we going?<eos> Federal prison.<eos> Taking you myself.<eos> You ever think about those who you killed?<eos> Like my son?
What? What do you mean "not today"?<eos> I shouldn't even be here right now.<eos> Where is he?<eos> You might have a point.<eos> About what?
Money talks, especially in Russia.<eos> Talk later.<eos> Stay by your phone.<eos> - Where have you been?<eos> - Bathroom.
What's going on?<eos> She's also up to her neck in debt.<eos> - Sick mother.<eos> - Where was all this?<eos> Her computer.
- Sick mother.<eos> - Where was all this?<eos> Her computer.<eos> I mean, where was the computer?<eos> Rolltop desk.
The Russian military was waiting for us on the bird.<eos> You want to really know what happened in Srebrenica?<eos> We hunted down a mole.<eos> Where did you find them?<eos> Your home computer.
What can I do for you, Mr. Andrews?<eos> Can we talk, Ms. Grundy, please?<eos> It depends.<eos> About what?<eos> Music.
We split up.<eos> We're civil.<eos> How about you?<eos> How are you holding up?<eos> Really?
Tell Veronica about your sister and my dear brother.<eos> Polly and Jason dated.<eos> I wouldn't say "dated".<eos> - It didn't end well.<eos> - In fact,
- What's that?<eos> A spot of good news.<eos> The car service found and dropped off your missing bag.<eos> Missing bag?<eos> Oh, Hiram...
Oh, God.<eos> - Once again, fate throws us together. - Hmm.<eos> So... Saturday night.<eos> Listen, Moose, you're hot. Yes.<eos> My type?
- No, I'm not taking any...<eos> And this is your way of trying to be friends with me again?<eos> The Pussycats are in.<eos> Oh, sorry, ladies, am I interrupting?<eos> - As a matter of fact...
Betty and I have been next-door neighbors since we were four.<eos> We've always gone to the same school, been in the same class.<eos> I remember in the second grade, I was having trouble reading, and my teacher, Mrs. Gribrock, told my mom and dad that I should stay back a year, to get caught up.<eos> Betty was so against us not being in the same grade that she took it upon herself to tutor me every single day.<eos> - In the second grade?
Look, I saw you guys.<eos> She's messing with you, man.<eos> And she's messing with your mind...<eos> What the hell do you know about it, Jughead?<eos> Or about me, even?
Previously on Riverdale...<eos> The story is about a town, once wholesome and innocent, now forever changed by the mysterious murder of Jason Blossom on the 4th of July.<eos> - Can we talk, Ms. Grundy?<eos> - About what?
Good, evil.<eos> Life, death.<eos> As the shadows around Riverdale deepened, the lines that separated these polar opposites blurred and distorted.<eos> "I'm guilty," Cheryl said in Biology class.<eos> But of what?
- And I was hoping you would let me go.<eos> - No, Archie.<eos> You don't get to go wherever you want, whenever you want, and damn what anyone else says.<eos> Dad, this is the first time a song I worked on is gonna be performed in front of people.<eos> On stage.
How would we explain why we were together at 6:00 a.m. on the 4th of July?<eos> - Hello, Fred. - Can I get you anything?<eos> - A job.<eos> - I can't very well have wife of Hiram Lodge, on trial for fraud and embezzlement, balancing my books.<eos> Oh, Hiram...
Just filling in for maternity, sabbatical, things like that.<eos> This is my first permanent position.<eos> Getting back to music, you're working with Archie Andrews on an independent study.<eos> Have you ever done this sort of thing before?<eos> - Yes. Last year. - Oh.
I know how much you love the Twilight, and so do I...<eos> Mr. Andrews, just give me one week to track down the person who bought the land, and convince them not to demolish a holy house of cinema.<eos> It's a big contract for me, Jug, and for my guys.<eos> Whatever they build in the place of the drive-in could mean more jobs... Yeah, in what?<eos> Some hypothetical future?
I don't teach performance.<eos> I teach song writing.<eos> I focus on craft, composition, lyrics.<eos> To even talk about your songs in a constructive way, we need to be on the same page.<eos> Like, on actual pages.
But their bedrooms, their houses...<eos> Bulldog twenty-five, on two.<eos> Bulldog twenty-five, on two.<eos> - Ready?<eos> - Break!
The story is about a town, once wholesome and innocent, now forever changedby the mysterious death of Jason Blossom on the 4th of July.<eos> The bookkeeping position at my company... It's still open.<eos> - If you're interested...<eos> - Yes, yes, yes.<eos> Oh, Hiram.
- But Josie...<eos> - Yeah?<eos> Every now and then, I want to sing lead.<eos> Co-lead.<eos> And only on the bridge.
Uh, tonight?<eos> I don't know...<eos> I'm game if you're game.<eos> On me.<eos> Anyway...
No, Vic, I can't.<eos> Sorry, Fred.<eos> Sheriff Keller told us everything.<eos> How you're hiding Polly at the Pembrooke?<eos> Better than in an insane asylum.
You did.<eos> And if you hadn't, I would've met up with Jason, and he still might be alive.<eos> Or you might've gotten hurt or worse.<eos> I was alone there.<eos> In that place.
What secrets?<eos> Let's just say that there are some things about myself that I struggle with.<eos> I trust Jughead, Mom.<eos> Of course you do. And you should.<eos> But just not with everything.
You're the last person I expected to see at my son's birthday party.<eos> Just doing my job, keeping my ear to the ground.<eos> And your tongue in the Sheriff's kid's mouth.<eos> - Did you hear anything interesting?<eos> - Actually, yeah.
No, no it's not that, Archie, it's just, um...<eos> This dance needs to be fun.<eos> And your songs, as amazing as they are...<eos> They make you wanna slit your wrists.<eos> - In a good way.
This dance needs to be fun.<eos> And your songs, as amazing as they are...<eos> They make you wanna slit your wrists.<eos> - In a good way.<eos> - In an amazing way.
It wasn't my fault, it was Polly's.<eos> She lunged at me, trying to get it, I didn't know what to do.<eos> I panicked.<eos> I thought it would be better for everyone if the ring were just gone.<eos> Down the drain.
Yeah, I'm fine. Betty, what's going on?<eos> We're here to bring you home, Pol.<eos> She's not leaving us.<eos> She chose to live here, remember?<eos> With a mentally stable family.
She's not leaving us.<eos> She chose to live here, remember?<eos> With a mentally stable family.<eos> Oh, I know all about your family, Penelope.<eos> - And the incest.
She chose to live here, remember?<eos> With a mentally stable family.<eos> Oh, I know all about your family, Penelope.<eos> - And the incest.<eos> What incest?
Mommy, that last morning, before Jay-Jay and I went to the river...<eos> Why were he and Daddy arguing?<eos> We've been over this.<eos> Your father dedicated himself to grooming Jason to take over the family business,<eos> - but in the end...
'Cause I was hoping we could...<eos> Oh, we can't sing it at the Jubilee.<eos> No, my mom already approved Astronaut.<eos> - But my song is about...<eos> - Your friends.
They will not get along.<eos> - So, you took Polly to school?<eos> - I'm so sorry, Betty.<eos> Nothing happened at school, it was fine.<eos> Fine?
Yeah.<eos> I'd love that, Archie.<eos> Earlier, your girl Vee, here, called to tell me what happened with Cheryl.<eos> I've reconsidered something.<eos> About your song.
How was Crowe?<eos> I don't know.<eos> There's something she's holding back.<eos> About Holland or herself?<eos> Somewhere in the intersection.
I haven't been back here since that night.<eos> So, you and Amy left a Halloween party at a neighbor's house, which was...?<eos> Two doors down from the corner.<eos> And she broke up with you?<eos> Yeah. Right over there on that bench.
No.<eos> Nothing more.<eos> You killed it today.<eos> That was the best redirect I have ever seen.<eos> In your three years of practice?
I'm reminded of a movie where two women drive off a cliff together.<eos> We can do this, Mellie.<eos> Do not despair.<eos> Where are you, anyway?<eos> White House.
Chart says he's a donor.<eos> Okay, let's get him on a vent.<eos> Thanks, guys.<eos> - Excuse me, sir. - Hmm.<eos> Mmm, yeah, hi.
You told me after that first surgery that we would see this through together.<eos> My hands are tied, Sally.<eos> I am so sorry.<eos> Something on your mind, Dr. Reid?<eos> Oh, just one of those days.
- Right.<eos> Well, whatever it is, I'd like to help.<eos> Okay. Um...<eos> Meet me in the storage closet by the lab in 10 minutes?<eos> - Storage closet?
Exactly.<eos> That's exactly right, Captain.<eos> One minute, you're saving a woman's life, next minute, you're picking up dog feces.<eos> Highs and lows.<eos> Sort of like a Russian novel.
Thank you.<eos> Can I ask you something?<eos> Shoot.<eos> How did Charlie know?<eos> About what?
The patient is going into cardiac arrest!<eos> We will need to recalibrate our approach, Dr. Frost.<eos> Dr. Frost.<eos> Frost was... Arthur's partner?<eos> All yours.
Um, anyone?<eos> Looks like it's just us.<eos> I can't believe you grew up in a house like this.<eos> I thought they only existed on TV.<eos> In the 50s.
Don't make me push you in.<eos> Okay, Coma Boy.<eos> Tell me a story.<eos> The... the year I went into my coma, I was supposed to visit this telescope.<eos> In Colorado.
Well, what's the point of a dress if it doesn't send a man straight to the asylum?<eos> God bless Scott for knowing something clothing.<eos> I swear, I could wear a burlap sack and Harold wouldn't even blink.<eos> When did you and Scott talk about fashion?<eos> Last night at the party.
Good, because the answer is "eh."<eos> Totally get it.<eos> But don't worry about me, really.<eos> If you need to worry about someone, worry about yourself.<eos> Me, why?
You know, you got way more out of that Scarsdale bar mitzvah than I did.<eos> It made me realize how much I like all that spiritual stuff.<eos> Like basketball?<eos> Church basketball.<eos> - At a church.
- So, you work in electronics.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Assistant store room manager. Yeah, so... uh...<eos> Um, you know, Rebecca and I were talking about Robert<eos> - the other day...
- Yeah.<eos> Assistant store room manager. Yeah, so... uh...<eos> Um, you know, Rebecca and I were talking about Robert<eos> - the other day...<eos> - Who?
Well, I can't say I remember him.<eos> Oh, wait.<eos> I do know that name.<eos> I think he had something to do with that whole Harvard law school thing.<eos> Harvard Law?
Everyone's got an opinion.<eos> And I find the murdered to be especially unforgiving.<eos> Were any of us on your mind when they gave you that plaque at the retirement party?<eos> Did any of them mention me?<eos> Or my little baby?
We could be the bait.<eos> Proxy Snyder.<eos> So, you've come back to the bloc.<eos> I have.<eos> In what capacity?
Of course.<eos> There must be a lot of sick people eating up your time.<eos> Actually... this was an old patient... a lawyer who's agreed to take you on, pro Bono.<eos> I figured you'd want some help getting the paperwork in order.<eos> What paperwork?
All I mean is, next time let's get our ducks in a row before we talk to the gaffer.<eos> You're not getting any argument from me.<eos> Sorry, ma'am.<eos> There's a DS here from East Mids, says you should know all about it.<eos> All about what?
You didn't take a bus or a train out of town at all?<eos> It was a while ago.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I might've forgotten.<eos> What about driving?
- Is that all right, DS Flynn?<eos> - Yeah, of course, ma'am, no problem.<eos> Thanks, everyone.<eos> Did I do all right?<eos> In what way?
Free country.<eos> I appreciate this may be a difficult subject for you, Jade, but I'm here to talk to you about Michael Farmer.<eos> All right.<eos> Do you mind if I ask, how did you know Mr Farmer?<eos> Just from the estate.
That is why I insisted on meeting only you.<eos> Because you'd understand.<eos> You understand what I'm thinking.<eos> Now, either the forensic investigators were silenced by Roz Huntley... .. or they're in on the conspiracy too.<eos> "Conspiracy"?
Get him out of here.<eos> - How old are you?<eos> - 20.<eos> - What did you do on the bloc?<eos> - Construction.
I don't know why they bother with the stuff.<eos> Never did anything for me.<eos> You've smoked pot?<eos> When?<eos> Up the desert.
I'll need a copy of your itinerary while you're in Oxford.<eos> Well, we'll be here, mostly.<eos> Joy will be appearing on the Almanac TV programme this evening.<eos> It's being filmed at Sierra Television Studios in Aston.<eos> In Birmingham?
Well...<eos> I was in London.<eos> I've...<eos> I have an office there.<eos> Mount Street.
It had stuck.<eos> So, you just opened her window and went on your way.<eos> What?<eos> Well, we had a drink.<eos> In the bar?
What's to figure?<eos> I'm just a policeman.<eos> Yeah, but you know that there's something happening, right?<eos> Here.<eos> In the world.
But it could have done.<eos> What's it do?<eos> It produces extreme visual and auditory hallucinations.<eos> Not usually toxic chemically, but behaviourally.<eos> - In what way?
You can spare yourself the trouble.<eos> A refund for the time I spent with Penny Reed.<eos> I came to Nonnatus House precisely because I wanted to go above and beyond for my patients, to be where I was needed most.<eos> And right now, it seems I'm needed elsewhere.<eos> In Hong Kong.
Violet's borrowed a maypole to do something with the Brownies, but the Cubs, they've gone to hell in a handcart since Nurse Mount went off.<eos> I could give a presentation with my Keep Fit Ladies.<eos> It would give us all such an incentive, and we'd draw quite a crowd with our leotards.<eos> Leotards?<eos> In a public park?
- It's lumps.<eos> You have to have one or two.<eos> - Dot.<eos> Does Eugene know?<eos> About your offer?
That's not a name we've heard before.<eos> She goes to St Lawrence's. She's in my chemistry club.<eos> And soon she'll be at your bus stop every morning.<eos> - That might cause something of a "reaction."<eos> - Honestly.
What are you doing in the city center?<eos> ‐ I asked for a transfer to work here.<eos> ‐ Oh, great.<eos> ‐ Yeah, I think it's better for me to be close to Sean in my condition.<eos> ‐ Your condition?
‐ Are you going with Cal to the auction tomorrow?<eos> I'd like you to keep an eye on him for me.<eos> ‐ I'm not your spy, Sarah.<eos> ‐ What are you guys fighting about? ‐ What are you guys fighting about?<eos> ‐ Nothing.
- Nice to meet you.<eos> - Nice to meet you.<eos> - Nice to meet you.<eos> What was that about?<eos> Current affairs.
I met someone.<eos> - A woman?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Where?<eos> - At the gym.
One could almost be forgiven for thinking that the entire upper layer of diseased skin was debrided and the underlying region treated with some sort of unguent.<eos> Don't know anything about that.<eos> I just started feeling better.<eos> I assumed it was the rest that did it.<eos> And the climate.
I wish I had.<eos> Hmm. Me, too.<eos> I was angry when I heard someone else had done it.<eos> However long my list got, he was always first.<eos> Your list?
I'll try not to.<eos> Who taught you how to do that?<eos> No one.<eos> - What do you think of her?<eos> - Who?
All we have to do is find that stuff and we can change everyone back.<eos> Like flipping a safety switch.<eos> But if you were Arias, where would you keep it?<eos> Someplace he can get to fast.<eos> Someplace secure.
Okay, well, to be honest, we're not that close.<eos> Like, I've hung out with him a few times, help the orderlies trim his nails and stuff, but never like a real conversation conversation.<eos> - But he is family, right? - That's true.<eos> - Hey, uh, cousin Mark.<eos> - Hi.
This is where it's won or lost.<eos> This is where it hurts, son.<eos> So you keep telling me.<eos> Right.<eos> On that punch ball.
Looks like she might be in trouble.<eos> Fighting for the vacant Southern Area Belt, with a record of 18 wins, two defeats and seven knockouts it's the Bethnal Green Bomber,<eos> Devon Hoyle!<eos> And Hoyle heads into the arena, looking fit, looking lean, looking mean.<eos> In the red corner...
Yes, sir.<eos> Can I help you?<eos> Detective Bosch, LAPD.<eos> I'd like to ask you some questions about William Meadows.<eos> Billy?
U.S. intelligence is reporting that Soviet armed forces were put on wartime alert shortly after the president's comments were made public.<eos> Allied forces in turn raised their readiness status.<eos> The state department insisted that the Soviets<eos> "were," blowing the incident out of proportion for propaganda purposes."<eos> But in the Soviet union...
You know, a couple guys on that line went pro.<eos> Is that right?<eos> Yep. He transferred out after the season.<eos> Uh, is he still at Wisconsin?<eos> Michigan.
Three weeks.<eos> Chief, S.E. Is retiring in six, he wants you there three weeks with him before he hands over the reins.<eos> It's the Soviet division, everything gets done right.<eos> I've been thinking.<eos> About pastor Tim.
We found my father's watch in the back of a drawer, and I wanted to come here and apologize and make it right.<eos> Okay.<eos> - I let you walk.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Under one condition:
The last two dudes who hung themselves where you're standing said the same thing.<eos> Ask me what I'm in for.<eos> I ate my sister and my mom.<eos> My dad, too.<eos> Up in Fort Collins.
Is that what you like?<eos> Is that what you... Did you do that to him before you came back to me with that mouth?<eos> Nothing in this letter was true.<eos> It was all a ruse to get Tom to recant his confession, get him back on my side.<eos> Our side.
And we still don't have a suspect?<eos> Not in the system.<eos> Never been arrested or served in the military or worked for the Post Office or taught school.<eos> I get it.<eos> Always on a bicycle?
Do it.<eos> Trust me.<eos> So when do you hear about the captain's exam?<eos> I heard.<eos> Next to last band.
How would I know?<eos> We talk English in here.<eos> Are you fucking with me, asshole?<eos> Anybody else been in here asking about this?<eos> As a matter of fact... last week.
Thank you.<eos> Students, you may begin your exam now.<eos> We need to talk.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> About what?
What does that mean?<eos> - Where is he?<eos> - What... what the hell is this all about?<eos> Holden, what happened outside the bar?<eos> In the parking lot?
Just, uh, weird dreams.<eos> Well, try and eat.<eos> You'll feel better.<eos> Hey, Luke, you didn't happen to know anyone involved in that house fire, did you?<eos> House fire?
You know, down at Helping Hands, we could...<eos> Look, Ian...<eos> I respect your hustle to try to get folks to volunteer for your charity, but...<eos> We can pay you.<eos> Like a real job.
He never once asked to see you.<eos> Lidocaine HCL, a local anesthetic.<eos> It should numb the pain.<eos> What movie did you see that in?<eos> No movie.
Funny!<eos> Not really.<eos> You're the one whose brother was in a coma?<eos> Ian's mentioned him before, here at the charity, but also in group.<eos> Group?
- Yeah.<eos> As much as you might want to, don't kill him.<eos> I hope this is it.<eos> He also works in town.<eos> Bail bonds shop.
As much as you might want to, don't kill him.<eos> I hope this is it.<eos> He also works in town.<eos> Bail bonds shop.<eos> Bail bonds?
As soon as they realize what's happened, they're gonna tear apart this bloc looking for us.<eos> We'd better go, then.<eos> Yeah.<eos> And I'm coming with you.<eos> To L.A.?
You're a bit more street smart than you look.<eos> What do you want?<eos> Our Neanderthal head of security is too dumb to see it, but rebellion is brewing in this camp.<eos> For example, the fights always break out in the loading dock.<eos> Never the bunks or the bathroom never the mess hall.

God damn it, Noah, pick up your fucking phone!<eos> Helen.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> I was in the neighborhood, and I thought I'd stop by.<eos> This neighborhood?
You okay?<eos> What's going on?<eos> Helen, come on, talk to me.<eos> Was Noah fucked up when I met him?<eos> - What, in college?
What's going on?<eos> Helen, come on, talk to me.<eos> Was Noah fucked up when I met him?<eos> - What, in college?<eos> - Yeah, freshman year.
Come in.<eos> Where were you?<eos> What?<eos> At the lake house.<eos> At Grandpa's house in... in Pennsylvania?
It's just an idea.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Clearing this place out.<eos> You getting rid of everything?<eos> Most of it.
You know, I, I used to like to be in his room after he died.<eos> In his bed, you know, surrounded by all his things.<eos> The sheets still had his smell, and I used to wrap them around a pillow and pretend I was holding him.<eos> My mom... put all of Dawn's things in a... storage as soon as she died.<eos> In a box.
Well... well, yeah, um, maybe I'll spend a few days a week up there.<eos> So this is a full-time job then?<eos> No, I-I... we haven't worked out the specifics yet, I...<eos> What about Joanie?<eos> What about her?
What?<eos> The publicist.<eos> The party.<eos> - Okay, I'm not listening...<eos> - The fucking hot tub?
Do they know who stabbed him?<eos> - Where were you?<eos> - I was with Dad.<eos> - Where?<eos> - At the lake house.
See, that's why you lost because you believe I am a predator, which is...<eos> I am your father.<eos> I am not a predator.<eos> I cannot be a predator.<eos> Not in this world.
Hello, Philadelphia!<eos> We love you, Frankie!<eos> I want to thank you for thinking differently.<eos> Thank you for thinking about tomorrow, not yesterday.<eos> About progress, not decline.

It would be nice for your daughters, Alexis and Natalie, to grow up near their grandparents.<eos> Yes. It would...<eos> Unfortunately, Edwards doesn't need another doctor.<eos> Thule Air Base, though, could use a good pathologist.<eos> Thule?
Who's presenting this woman to be joined in matrimony?<eos> I do.<eos> It's okay, Huck.<eos> I, Olivia Carolyn Pope, take you, Fitzgerald Thomas Grant III... To be my wedded wife... to have and to hold, from this day forward...<eos> For better or for worse...
I do.<eos> It's okay, Huck.<eos> I, Olivia Carolyn Pope, take you, Fitzgerald Thomas Grant III... To be my wedded wife... to have and to hold, from this day forward...<eos> For better or for worse...<eos> For richer, for poorer...

I did what I had to do...<eos> What I thought I had to do to win, and now...<eos> Now I am trapped.<eos> Fitz is free with you, and I'm...<eos> Anyway...
It's strange.<eos> I can imagine.<eos> No, you can't.<eos> What was it like?<eos> Prison?
I can imagine.<eos> No, you can't.<eos> What was it like?<eos> Prison?<eos> H-Hell.
How are you feeling?<eos> You mean after being cuffed and caged by fitzgerald grant?<eos> I mean now that you're free of those people.<eos> You're safe, dad.<eos> Safe...
Now's our time to do something, to make our move.<eos> He's not gone.<eos> My father may be safe, but he's still right here.<eos> Where?<eos> The white house?
Liv.<eos> You got a second?<eos> So we've been going through the files we pulled from Peus' super PAC.<eos> Has your father ever mentioned getting packages from them?<eos> Packages?
What do we know about this woman?<eos> Loves cats, hates democracy.<eos> I'm only half-kidding.<eos> Does she have a TV?<eos> Anything in her cell?
People in Rosemead and elsewhere are better off than when I took office.<eos> Based on the numbers.<eos> Is there something else I should base it on?<eos> Have you been to Rosemead in the past eight years?<eos> North Philly, South Side of Chicago, the D?

Not think.<eos> Know...<eos> I know you should pardon him, because he didn't do what they said he did.<eos> - And you're basing this on...?<eos> - My gut.
Because if people cannot make up for their mistakes,<eos> I would've kept my ass at home instead of coming here and risking the one thing I know I love...<eos> My freedom... to try and do something good for my daughter.<eos> Did you tell them about Sandra?<eos> Who?
The next step will be war.<eos> We lost on Ganymede, definitively.<eos> When losers seek peace, they look even weaker.<eos> A peace summit, here on Earth.<eos> On our terms.
Shit.<eos> Sorry.<eos> She... she's in Prague.<eos> I'm... I'm a sublet.<eos> Prague?
Okay, just...<eos> Oh my God.<eos> We're to get you to the hospital, okay?<eos> This is going to hurt.<eos> Oh, God.
Firefighters are...<eos> Actually, um...<eos> There's something I forgot I had to do.<eos> I have to go.<eos> By all means.
Mr. Axelrod finds the question irrelevant.<eos> Consider him aware now.<eos> The same day the U. S. Attorney ended the pursuit of said charges, his wife received a five million dollar payment from this company.<eos> Highly irregular.<eos> In your world.

- Just give it a chance.<eos> She's great.<eos> She's an artist.<eos> She's got a new show in Soho, in Queens.<eos> Actually Hoboken.
Holy crap. Julio.<eos> The radio used to house the bomb we found in Albert Luna's house.<eos> We're in the right place.<eos> I see him.<eos> My God.
Then why did you leave?<eos> Did it stop feeling that way?<eos>  I just didn't like who we were anymore.<eos>  I got married.<eos>  To Mary?
I don't know if he just bought it or what.<eos> Does that radio have anything to do with the explosion?<eos> Very probably.<eos> When were you last at your father's before today?<eos> Last week.
Are you expecting us to remember all these names?<eos> Just, um, just this one.<eos> Lieutenant Cristian Ortiz.<eos> Cristian did two tours in Iraq, three in Afghanistan, and shortly after he was honorably discharged in '05 was convicted of manslaughter<eos> - right here in Los Angeles County.
And I was in a coma.<eos> - Oh. - That seems to be going around.<eos> And when I got out of the coma, I wanted to focus on other things.<eos> Like what?<eos> Uh, like my life, like my fiancée.
Still, after a stressful day like that, I might have taken a mental health day before I picked up the scalpel.<eos> Well, then it's a good thing that you're not a doctor, because we deal with highly stressful situations all the time.<eos> I'm trying to get to the truth here.<eos> Then ask me about my patient.<eos> Not my mother.
Okay.<eos> Are you all right watching Luke for a few days?<eos> Of course.<eos> My mom's sick.<eos> Terminal, actually.
God, no.<eos> - Because my schedule... - Your schedule... is just constantly...<eos> - in flux.<eos> - fucked.<eos> Flux.
It isn't.<eos> Why didn't it work?<eos> 'Tween us?<eos> You're askin' me that now?<eos> Under the circumstances.
But I guess...<eos> If your daddy was run over by some drunk-ass teenager, 40 years might feel like 40 minutes.<eos> And you're implying that I can't preside over this case without bias.<eos> Yes, sir, I am.<eos> With respect.
That what you think?<eos> You wanna know what I think?<eos> I think you stole them shoes off that dead kid... A dead kid you know I ain't kill.<eos> And we ain't no brothers, Slack or no slack.<eos> Now...
So we are not the first Brakebills students to get into Fillory or to assume the throne.<eos> It's a great question for history class, but if The Beast gets to the Wellspring right now and sucks it bone-dry, magic dies in Fillory.<eos> - It dies there...<eos> - It dies here.<eos> On Earth.
On Earth.<eos> My God.<eos> So the Battle Magic that this student learned here, he learned from a professor named Bigby.<eos> - Have you heard of him?<eos> - Her.
So why was Battle Magic outlawed?<eos> Humans least attractive qualities.<eos> Panic and paranoia.<eos> And there were several student deaths that semester.<eos> Far fewer than the 1870s, or the 1920s, or the '60s.
O... kay.<eos> I'm wondering if maybe you could rub a little into my shoulder.<eos> Yeah, I got a cramp.<eos> Which one?<eos> Both, actually.
Uh-uh.<eos> I've been reading, and people are making, like, a billion dollars a year off of their YouTube shit.<eos> Well, that ain't ever gonna be us.<eos> At least, not in the near future.<eos> Or distant future.
Go fuck yourself.<eos> Really robbed yourself of the sympathy vote, didn't ya?<eos> Let's go, bitch, you can walk.<eos> I have an infection.<eos> Obviously not in your legs.
Is that what you want, Charlie?<eos> Good.<eos> Sir, found him.<eos> This is Westlake and 6th looking north from 6:21 A.M. this morning.<eos> - In position.
Where...<eos> It's okay.<eos> Just sip it.<eos> Where are we?<eos> On a freighter.
She sounds... nice.<eos> She died when I was a baby.<eos> Yeah.<eos> If she died when you were a baby, when did she say that?<eos> In my head.
You're safe in here.<eos> You're safe in here and you always will be.<eos> Any questions?<eos> Is this a knock-through?<eos> Well, in a way, yes.
Hey, still making eyes at a puddle?<eos> Bill!<eos> Bill!<eos> Quick!<eos> Back to the TARDIS!
Broadcasting sounds that soothe, cheer and comfort the patients and staff here at Cowley General.'<eos> And now, with the time just coming up to 11 o'clock, this is your friend Hester Fagen signing off.<eos> That's it.<eos> One pair of men's spectacles.<eos> Tortoise shell.
On Friday?<eos> - Did she say who was coming to see her?<eos> - No.<eos> - And what ward was your father on?<eos> - Fosdick Ward.
- Did she say who was coming to see her?<eos> - No.<eos> - And what ward was your father on?<eos> - Fosdick Ward.<eos> - Fosdick?
They've put him on Fosdick ward, same as Mr Bright.<eos> He's putting a brave face on it but I'd say he's rattled.<eos> He should be.<eos> Heavy mob wouldn't really try and knock him off, would they?<eos> Not in the hospital.
His wife thinks some of his things were stolen.<eos> I don't know about thieving, but...<eos> there's something not right there.<eos> Wouldn't be anything to do with Bed Ten, would it?<eos> - Why?
Why would the hospital do that if it was done and dusted?<eos> Another thing.<eos> Mr Zacharides died in Bed Ten on Fosdick Ward.<eos> Now, I know it sounds ridiculous but it has something of a dark reputation amongst its patients.<eos> What?
The parents tried to bring a case for negligence against Dr Powell, but he was cleared on the evidence of a young nurse, Clodagh MacMahon.<eos> Sister MacMahon.<eos> Dr Powell.<eos> Can you tell us about Molly Keenan?<eos> - What?
If anyone's killing patients in that hospital, it's Sir Merlyn.<eos> Is this his idea?<eos> Blame me for his mistakes?<eos> Is that it?<eos> - What mistakes?
Has Mr Bright had an injection?<eos> No.<eos> Not while I've been here.<eos> Everything all right, Sister?<eos> Quite all right.
I see you met our sexton.<eos> Curling your hair with tales of the devil walking abroad, was he?<eos> - Something like that.<eos> - He can lay it on a bit thick.<eos> Particularly with strangers.
There's a maize field about a mile east of here.<eos> Who does it belong to?<eos> Zebulon Sadler.<eos> He lives down the lane.<eos> Now, before you... Judgement.
I was off to taking it up the church jumble only I ran into Zebulon.<eos> He thought it might do for Old Job, the scarecrow.<eos> - Where'd you find Sadler?<eos> - Didn't he say?<eos> Up by Bramford mere.
- I bet that went over well.<eos> - Well, we sort of made a deal.<eos> - A deal with Renard?<eos> About what?<eos> - Nick.
I can't find them anywhere.<eos> Maybe we're looking in the wrong place.<eos> I've looked at the Babylonians and the Egyptians, and that's as far back as arithmetic, which is about 2,000 B.C., so...<eos> How do we know the right place to look if we've never seen them before?<eos> Except in hell.
- The way you move.<eos> - What do you mean?<eos> - It's a little off.<eos> Off?<eos> Off how?
Could be how our monster found them.<eos> Well, her account isn't private, so that's a possibility.<eos> I dug through some old case files and found three other kidnappings with the same M.O.<eos> Baby taken straight from the cradle by a supposed monster.<eos> - In Portland?
Yeah, it's me and Hank.<eos> - We thought you would be here.<eos> - We had a prenatal exam.<eos> - Everything okay?<eos> - Okay, okay, and okay.
- Who drew these?<eos> - Diana.<eos> - I saw them, too.<eos> - Where?<eos> In the tunnel.
It's the same guy!<eos> That's how I knew I had seen him.<eos> The book said he was immortal, right?<eos> And if he really comes up out of the ground only once every seven years, and he comes up out of the park...<eos> His park.
I keep thinking I need to be carrying that stick, and I wanna know what's written on that cloth that's wrapped around it.<eos> - Eve is here.<eos> - What?<eos> Where?<eos> In the wall.
Alpe, with an E.<eos> I got this in one of my books.<eos> According to Germanic folklore,<eos> Alpen are responsible for...<eos> sleep paralysis and insomnia.
Previously on "Grimm"... - Eve is here. - What?<eos> Where?<eos> - In the wall.
Step out, please.<eos> This is outrageous.<eos> - Yes, it is.<eos> - What is the problem?<eos> - Arms.
Dumping in the woods should not be considered a solution.<eos> Everyone who went missing went missing in the same part of the woods.<eos> Yeah, within about five square miles.<eos> Do you have that list of them?<eos> - Not on me.
No, sweetie, Daddy's just gonna help us find Nick and Eve.<eos> That would be good, Daddy.<eos> They're in a bad place.<eos> - Where are they?<eos> - The other place.
So what did she say?<eos> This is where I came through.<eos> Me too.<eos> These are the symbols that were on the cloth.<eos> And in the sky.
For something that hasn't happened yet?<eos> March 24th.<eos> Dad is just gonna help us find Nick and Eve.<eos> - Where are they?<eos> - The Other Place.
It doesn't belong there.<eos> What is this place?<eos> There's Wesen everywhere.<eos> These are the symbols that were on the cloth.<eos> And in the sky.
- All right, he needs to hear this.<eos> - I can.<eos> He's here.<eos> Where?<eos> In Portland.
Diana.<eos> I'm sorry for a lot of that stuff.<eos> Me too.<eos> I wish I'd never heard of those damn keys... or Black Claw.<eos> Or Bonaparte or this.
- You forget Aunt Agatha.<eos> - So do you.<eos> Or so she tells me!<eos> I think of her often.<eos> And you.
She is in a good deal of pain.<eos> When do you expect Dr Choake?<eos> God knows!<eos> It's hours since he was summoned to Killewarren.<eos> Killewarren?
- I ne'er was the god-fearing kind.<eos> - Nor I.<eos> But if I were, I'd pray.<eos> For what, maid?<eos> Deliverance.
Rest of the year I try and behave like a good Christian.<eos> By avoiding sin?<eos> See, I'm not that convinced about sin, brother.<eos> I think more highly of love.<eos> Of my husband, my child, my dog, my home.
We've had enough in recent years.<eos> We're looking for a little peace.<eos> In the Lord shall ye find it!<eos> In truth, Sam's flock have so swell'd already, we mus' look out a larger house of worship.<eos> Preferably not on my land!
His father's son!<eos> A true Warleggan!<eos> It's been a while since you graced our humble house of prayer.<eos> - Do you find it much changed?<eos> - In what regard?
I assume he's now returned to the navy.<eos> I believe he's in the Channel Patrol, with the Western Squadron.<eos> The Western?<eos> I trust they were not involved in this latest skirmish?<eos> Skirmish?
And yet he has, once again.<eos> How dare he?<eos> So we're in agreement?<eos> They must on no account be allowed the land?<eos> On no account.
I, George Warleggan, do swear to act as a Justice of the Peace.<eos> 20 lashes.<eos> Ross sends his brotherinlaw to encroach upon our lives yet again!<eos> - Are we never to be rid of him?<eos> - Not here, but in Truro...
Good day to you both.<eos> Captain, Captain...<eos> You find me about God's holy work.<eos> I'm sure it's much needed hereabouts.<eos> Indeed.
If we see a chance to give or take pleasure in this world... ought we not to seize it?<eos> But... surely we've no right to expect happiness?<eos> All we can do is our duty.<eos> I believe 'tis our duty to find happiness... in great things, or small.<eos> Like toads!
You've been a great friend to me, Drake, so I've brought you a gift.<eos> No, Master Geoffrey, 'tis enough to have had your friendship.<eos> You can open it later if you'd rather.<eos> I'll be offended if you don't take it.<eos> On one condition.
But... not for the likes of me.<eos> How do you do, ma'am?<eos> You're quite the young gentleman.<eos> Is Uncle George here?<eos> In London.
There is.<eos> And soon, I hope, there will be better.<eos> Am I permitted to know?<eos> Let us say that if my visit to Tehidy goes well...<eos> Tehidy?
I know my limitations.<eos> At sea I'm a passable navigator, on land an average poet and an indifferent artist.<eos> You've been sketching?<eos> May we see?<eos> By no means.
Well, ma'am, I hope we can count on your support in our newest venture?<eos> A candidate to challenge Lord Falmouth in the coming by-election has been found.<eos> Is this true?<eos> It is a fine thing for young Valentine to have an MP as a father.<eos> Indeed.
There's still Geoffrey Charles.<eos> Doubtless George'll find a way to part him from his inheritance.<eos> Judas!<eos> There was more to George's note than the news of her death.<eos> Funeral arrangements?
Judas!<eos> There was more to George's note than the news of her death.<eos> Funeral arrangements?<eos> - Not a word.<eos> - What, then?
I already won.<eos> Oh, yeah. Her, uh, her boyfriend appointed her.<eos> He's not...<eos> I won the job because I'm the most deserving.<eos> In bed.
Well, nobody helped me when I first started here, But I'm in a generous mood.<eos> Okay, pick a box, ask me questions, And then we'll figure out how to organize it.<eos> Why don't we just make piles based on date, Relevance and evidentiary value?<eos> Have you done this before?<eos> From prison, yeah.
This is from before billy and amy left the party, And this one from after he came back from gramercy park.<eos> What am I looking at here?<eos> The jersey.<eos> In the first one, it's a crew neck.<eos> And in the second one...
- What about you?<eos> What... What... What you've been up to?<eos> Good.<eos> Hey, what's up with that priest?<eos> From the bar?
Are you almost here?<eos> Because your 6:00 is in the conference room.<eos> I'm not back in New York yet.<eos> You were right, Donna.<eos> About what?
- What's this?<eos> - We're celebrating.<eos> - Louis, you know i can't have champagne.<eos> - I know, which is why we're having the best sparkling apple cider money can buy.<eos> - Well, in that case...
- I know, which is why we're having the best sparkling apple cider money can buy.<eos> - Well, in that case...<eos> What are we celebrating?<eos> - The fact that it's your first sonogram this week.<eos> - Louis, about the sonogram...
the most amazing legal secretary in the history of everything.<eos> - Benjamin, that's the sweetest thing<eos> - Okay, but you said it about yourself two weeks ago.<eos> - That I did.<eos> - In that case,
You Roma?<eos> Who Roma?<eos> There's some people on the station we need to find.<eos> Heard Roma's the man to talk to.<eos> Ah, in that case...
No, it's not the phone he figured out here.<eos> It's our successful businessman who chances nothing.<eos> Your Honor, the prosecution is asking for a continuance<eos> - based on new evidence that the LAPD...<eos> - What new evidence?
Get lost, weirdo.<eos> You seen God?<eos> Is this a joke?<eos> Hey, I'm looking for God.<eos> In a bar?
Here he fixes cars.<eos> He on the FBI watch list for a real reason? Or is he just another name they added to cover their asses?<eos> May, 2014, his cousin, Tala Zahad, blew himself up outside a Baghdad police station.<eos> - 17 Iraqis killed.<eos> - Last December,
It seems like you need to relax.<eos> I'm married... to a woman.<eos> I have a boyfriend. but he's on another continent, so... it doesn't count.<eos> And where is your wife?<eos> On another planet.
Look, what Margo said about me was true.<eos> So if--if you want to bail, now's your chance.<eos> Well, you do have questionable judgment.<eos> I mean, we're best bitches, right?<eos> For better or for worse.
Are you saying you want to hear about my night with Tara?<eos> Of course I do.<eos> Right after we make friendship bracelets and braid each other's hair.<eos> For your information, it was a magical evening, but actually, I'm here to talk business.<eos> - What business?
- I'm gonna figure out what we're going to say to that Velocity son of a bitch when he walks in here tomorrow begging for a settlement.<eos> Do you have any idea what this is about?<eos> Gretchen said that Louis had some special assignment for us.<eos> All I know is I got a rambling voicemail about Neapolitan ice cream.<eos> Neapolitan ice cream?
And his mom's a broker with a wall street firm.<eos> Why is this important?<eos> Does will ride home the same way every night, ma'am?<eos> Yes.<eos> Pretty much.
Because his family's, like, loaded.<eos> And I asked him what country club he belonged to. If he was so rich, and how come I beat him at golf last week?<eos> And he said his golf game was usually way better than mine,<eos> And that's what the texts were about, okay?<eos> Golf!
Will had a genuine desire to serve...<eos> Feeding the homeless,<eos> Mentoring at-risk boys, habitat for humanity.<eos> You name it, will did it.<eos> And his essay.
Well, is there any way this could've been an accident?<eos> I mean, the guy's a known drug dealer.<eos> Maybe he tried to drop a bale of marijuana. Out of a small plane and slipped.<eos> Yeah?<eos> But three of the victim's knuckles.
Well, the gardener may not have been flying the helicopter,<eos> But he knows who was.<eos> And he still could've had felix killed.<eos> I am an agricultural entrepreneur.<eos> And in the state of california,
But he didn't hang on for very long.<eos> Doctor?<eos> This is a picture of the victim's left hand.<eos> Please note the marks on the second and third knuckles. Antemortem bruising caused by significant fractures.<eos> In the proximal phalanges.
W-wait a minute. I don't understand.<eos> Wh... is... is he all right?<eos> What happened?<eos> It's a homicide charge.<eos> Homicide?
I think he's kind of patriarchal.<eos> What does that mean?<eos> We did a section on him in my Oppositional Gender studies class... and, like, the only women you see in all of his movies... need to be saved because they're about to get raped by, like, Indigenous Peoples or they're, like, cooking biscuits.<eos> I think John Wayne is real respectful of women.<eos> In like a patriarchal kind of way.
- No.<eos> - Hold on.<eos> Let me finish.<eos> No way.<eos> Absolutely not.
No.<eos> Just the opposite.<eos> Everything is just right.<eos> I'm healthy. Uh...<eos> Reasonably sane.
His name is Ray Wilson.<eos> And he's been stalking me since college.<eos> So Quinn, if you can. I'd like you to tell me more about Ray Wilson.<eos> We met at college.<eos> At Rutgers.
So grab Fin and get over there and talk to him as soon as you can, okay?<eos> Thanks, Rollins.<eos> Everything okay?<eos> Yeah, just, uh... just thinking.<eos> Yeah, what about?
Thanks, Rollins.<eos> Everything okay?<eos> Yeah, just, uh... just thinking.<eos> Yeah, what about?<eos> About the next chapter.
He didn't seem real thrilled about it.<eos> You guys know how it is.<eos> People always hating on the police until they need us.<eos> And then it's "how fast can you get here?"<eos> Just like on the streets, right?
The sergeant's CI had ID'd the house we stacked outside.<eos> Our sarge says, "don't bother announcing, just hit the door."<eos> Inside, there was a guy with a gun.<eos> Lawfully, as it turned out.<eos> Anyway.
I just wanna have a talk later.<eos> Ticket's yours either way.<eos> What do you want for this?<eos> I told you, I just want to talk.<eos> About what?
Madame Agathe! You mentioned an extremely important consultation... but I did not dare dream it would be here. Now, I hope you understand how vital it is that he be inspired by his time with you.<eos> I brought only the best for you, my dear.<eos> In the time of an eclipse, a deck of great power and prophecy.<eos> You'll speak only of the glories you see, nothing more.<eos> Just the light.
My soup is fresh and untainted by any tonic.<eos> His Excellency, Envoy Zweibrucken from the Palatinate, Sire.<eos> What are your terms?<eos> The initial meeting shall take place on...<eos> On sovereign territory within the Ile de France.
Mia is in a federal facility with no access to the Internet.<eos> Right, and she has never shown a proclivity for getting around infrastructure.<eos> We've only been live for two weeks, and we just cracked the top 500 in the Hooli app store.<eos> Ranked 499.<eos> Of utilities.
You guys don't need all these lights on, do you?<eos> Yes, we do.<eos> Okay. Well, that should be fine.<eos> We should be fine.<eos> Um, fine from what?
Something wrong?<eos> At 12 weeks, optimal crown chin length is 26 millimeters.<eos> Your fetal measurement is 23.<eos> Is that still within the normal range?<eos> Yes, but on the low end.
What about pregnant women with tb?<eos> The drugs knocked it down, and you know that.<eos> I'm so sick of you bringing up this work thing.<eos> I worry about you.<eos> And the baby.
I looked online at the therapies that you mentioned.<eos> I decided to try tms.<eos> In some cases, patients experience profound changes. Immediately, after one treatment.<eos> Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.<eos> Some cases.
Just try me.<eos> All right.<eos> A few hours ago, I lost a kid who was shot.<eos> Another one.<eos> So much of my work...
All right, we're moving him.<eos> Let me take a look.<eos> All right, watch your backs.<eos> How we doing?<eos> Okay.
Mr. Kellogg, I'm very sorry.<eos> We are gonna take excellent care of you, but you're gonna have to wait a little bit longer.<eos> - For God's sake.<eos> - I will be right back, and I'm gonna make you one of our first priorities.<eos> First priority. Yeah, sure.
So that we could examine you.<eos> Cut it off?<eos> You mean... It's destroyed?<eos> Yes.<eos> God.
I would.<eos> Finally.<eos> Hi, nancy.<eos> How are you?<eos> Okay.
Yeah, well, being in S.H.I.E.L.D. will do that to you.<eos> I think Simmons has been kidnapped like<eos> - three times since I've known her.<eos> - Really?<eos> Yeah, well, only twice on this planet.
Coulson?<eos> We don't know.<eos> Daisy and May are looking while I try to restore communication.<eos> And General Talbot's here... "helping"?<eos> In his own way.
Yeah, put us to shame.<eos> Sam and Billy were part of the original LMD program.<eos> Wait.<eos> Are you saying they're ...<eos> Obsolete.
This is a woman's life...<eos> the end of her life.<eos> Just give her some peace.<eos> - This is May we're talking about.<eos> - Yes. May.
- Has to be something.<eos> - Clearly.<eos> And yet, there is nothing.<eos> So, we take a bit of everything and test a bit of everything, old-school.<eos> Like in the chem lab, at our old school.
Yeah.<eos> You interrupted a rousing discourse<eos> - on pre-"Weekend" Godard .versus ... - You spend too much time as of late in your fantasyland, Doctor.<eos> I need you here.<eos> Present.
So clumsy.<eos> Everything okay?<eos> Oh, our, uh, friend here went hiking.<eos> Oh, yeah?<eos> In a dumpster or...?
It's what's in them.<eos> How confident are you about this report?<eos> No other center reported any unscheduled drops today.<eos> It has to be the patriot.<eos> Very well, then.
Calm down.<eos> At least Skye's not a prisoner anymore.<eos> Yeah, but if hydra finds her before I do, they'll march her into a public square and put a bullet in her head.<eos> Hey.<eos> Not in front of my daughter.
Wait a minute.<eos> What is this back door everyone keeps talking about?<eos> I thought we were here to take out Madame Hydra.<eos> Let me guess... no one told you about the other world.<eos> The other world?
We can afford it.<eos> Yeah, we can, if we never go out again.<eos> We're having a baby, of course we're never going to go out again.<eos> Have you spoken to the DCI yet?<eos> About what?
I'm afraid to tell you Paul's dead.<eos> You didn't know?<eos> No.<eos> It's been on the news.<eos> What news?
Accident?<eos> Car accident.<eos> Was Paul driving?<eos> No. No, erm... he was hit.<eos> At a bus stop.
Car accident.<eos> Was Paul driving?<eos> No. No, erm... he was hit.<eos> At a bus stop.<eos> Bus stop?
I'm not saying that.<eos> Well, then why was he hanging out with criminals?<eos> All right.<eos> He told me what happened.<eos> Your affair.
- See you later.<eos> - I love you.<eos> - Love you too.<eos> We need to talk about this.<eos> About what?
Is Theo inside?<eos> - He lives over there.<eos> Across the way.<eos> - That one there?<eos> - Yeah, one on the end.
- Yes.<eos> - Why?<eos> The same reason you're fighting with a 12 year old, I'd say.<eos> It's only being telecast at the one pub there.<eos> The Bishop.
- Anywhere.<eos> - Hotels?<eos> - Uh, I can't say.<eos> - I can't--<eos> Any this week?
He used his computer here six days ago.<eos> A Mr. John Tyhmens?<eos> He fights with a little kid on a website we like about Willie Nelson.<eos> He did that from here.<eos> Last week.
None of these match.<eos> I told you, it's rare.<eos> A vault?<eos> A storage area?<eos> In Osaka.
Up there with your wife and child?<eos> Livin' in peace for all eternity?<eos> No.<eos> I'll tell you where you belong.<eos> Right back in Hell.
Yeah. I was there.<eos> Call came in, ADP down at Memorial, a couple weeks ago.<eos> I pull up expecting to see some old lady in a robe, instead it's Catherine Cardinal.<eos> Nice clothes, hair brushed but not well.<eos> What kind of not well?
Blue Moon.<eos> Rhapsody in Blue.<eos> Tangled Up in Blue.<eos> Blue Oyster Cult.<eos> Blue Monday.
It's nice.<eos> It's peaceful.<eos> Private.<eos> What did you talk about when you walked by the river?<eos> Shopping.
Private.<eos> What did you talk about when you walked by the river?<eos> Shopping.<eos> - And the weather.<eos> - Shopping and the weather.
What did you talk about when you walked by the river?<eos> Shopping.<eos> - And the weather.<eos> - Shopping and the weather.<eos> Nothing else?
I just wanted to check if you were okay.<eos> I'm fine.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Except for the weird guy who just snuck into my room.<eos> Other than that...
Eyes down, girls.<eos> There was a way we looked at each other at the Red Center.<eos> For a long time I couldn't figure out what it was exactly.<eos> That expression in their eyes.<eos> In my eyes.
Hey.<eos> Hi.<eos> How are you here?<eos> They called me when your name came up, and you're on my list.<eos> List?
Change the world, even just a little bit.<eos> Just go with them.<eos> Trust me.<eos> Oh, God.<eos> Behind the tub.
Did you pull some shit to make this happen?<eos> Damn, Mike, if you can't be straight with me, this conversation ends right here.<eos> Yes, I did.<eos> Finally.<eos> Some truth in the night.
And then what happened?<eos> Then the police called.<eos> My world ended.<eos> And one month later, I got a letter from the insurance company saying Shannon lied on her application.<eos> About what?
I was thinking maybe your new office.<eos> Yeah, we could end up there.<eos> But I was thinking maybe we'd start out where I started out.<eos> - Where's that?<eos> - In the bullpen.
That proves nothing, Mr. Foley.<eos> Ah, that's right.<eos> You don't believe in demonic possession.<eos> OK then Detective, tell me, was Mr. Foley also in the lecture hall?<eos> What lecture hall?
Yes.<eos> Some women do it that way.<eos> But it should be with somebody we trust.<eos> I was thinking of Nick.<eos> Nick?
Uh, where would we go?<eos> We couldn't go to my place.<eos> Moira's there, working.<eos> What do people in the movies do?<eos> - In the movies?
- They get a room.<eos> Yes.<eos> - Yeah, they get a room.<eos> - Mmm‐hmm. Yeah, we could get a room.<eos> Some, like, um...
Ms. Tapping?<eos> Rachel, please.<eos> Ava, could you get us some coffee?<eos> Please, come in.<eos> Yeah, so, um...
I know.<eos> Writing was on the wall.<eos> These last few months...<eos> I keep thinking about that night here on the island.<eos> About Nadine.
It was when DI Charlie Hulme was here.<eos> Julie Matlock was editor of the Saint Marie Times and quite a respected figure on the island.<eos> And what was her relationship to Nadine Hunter?<eos> Nadine worked under Julie at the paper, she was a photographer, - but there were definite tensions between them.<eos> - Oh, in what way?
- Something like that.<eos> '.. but guess what?<eos> I'm still at the office. 'I'm probably going to be here another...'<eos> Something there, isn't there?<eos> In the background?
What's going on?<eos> I bought a bed.<eos> Have a look.<eos> - When did you organise that?<eos> - Last night at the bar.
What happened with Monica?<eos> I can't believe I mixed them up!<eos> Monica Ridley is the model, the one taller than me.<eos> And the other one is Monica Cannon, whose father was in the circus.<eos> - Circus?
We're not in London any more, Dad.<eos> You have to expect things to be a little different.<eos> Ah... I was going to talk to you about that.<eos> The commissioner wants to know if I would stay here.<eos> - Permanently. - Oh?
The killing?<eos> The killing.<eos> Of a man who was trying to choke you to death.<eos> Of a man who was trying to kill you.<eos> Yeah. The thing.
Does this guy work for the government?<eos> Sort of.<eos> Then he'll be at the The King Gerald.<eos> I mean, where are you staying?<eos> The King Gerald.
And lately he's... It feels like if this goes the other way and he gets passed over, his entire purpose is called into question.<eos> Meanwhile, Lonnie has been sent away, called back, and never let it derail him.<eos> He's dogged.<eos> And none of this is being colored by your personal connection to Bryan?<eos> In the past.
- Four brothers.<eos> Here comes the boom.<eos> What the hell are you doing in<eos> - my hotel room?<eos> - Your hotel room?
Now get them out of my house.<eos> One more thing.<eos> Is there anyone else who knows about this mission?<eos> About Black Badge's assignment<eos> - in Purgatory?
I'm a police officer!<eos> Are you all right?<eos> I need my inhaler.<eos> God.<eos> In my bag.
Sorry.<eos> Tennison, post mortem.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Looks like I'm on vomit duty, then!<eos> - Nervous?
Over.<eos> Before you go home, pin these to the incident board.<eos> Why do you smell of Dettol?<eos> I was at the mort...<eos> Mortuary.
I've got people on the outside relying on you, so stop messing about and get it done.<eos> Or next time, I'll take more than just your wife's purse.<eos> Right, you four with me.<eos> Where'd you go for that warrant?<eos> Timbuktu?
I'd also like to learn how to do that thing where you stand up in the water and row.<eos> Huh, what is that?<eos> - Paddleboarding?<eos> I think I'd like to do that.<eos> Whoa. In a wetsuit.
Huh, what is that?<eos> - Paddleboarding?<eos> I think I'd like to do that.<eos> Whoa. In a wetsuit.<eos> On a lake.
You got good balance there.<eos> I do. I do.<eos> I do.<eos> Hey, what's in those boxes, huh?<eos> On the bookshelf there!
- Thanks, Veronica.<eos> Viewers will recall that following the fire, the Baudelaires were sent to live with Count Olaf, a villainous actor and an active villain who has vowed repeatedly that he will stop at nothing to get his hands on the enormous fortune<eos> Let's hope so, Vincent.<eos> Coming up next, some very nice people were poisoned.<eos> But first, the weather.
Instead, there would be cloudbursts of unhappiness.<eos> Blizzards of despair.<eos> Misery in the form of sleet storms.<eos> Various cold fronts of terror.<eos> Horror.
I'm too haunted by the past.<eos> Does this have anything to do with our parents?<eos> Certainly not.<eos> It has to do with my husband...<eos> Ike.
Well, a photographer from The Post snapped me leaving the Night Bunker.<eos> The Night Bunker?<eos> ! Ghastly, I know, but sleazy is all the rage.<eos> What's worse is that I was with Tony Hartley, and now his wife is citing me in the divorce.<eos> Oh, Bunty!
Well, do you have another plan? !<eos> We both know the alternative!<eos> If you're looking for Her Ladyship, she's out in the garden, having a walk.<eos> Actually, I wanted to talk to you.<eos> About Ruby Jewel.
Bludgeoned over the head by a right-handed assailant approximately six inches taller.<eos> The victim was five foot six.<eos> Can I ask how tall you are?<eos> Five feet ten.<eos> And no doubt taller in heels.
I hid who I really was until one day when an accident forced me to reveal myself to the world.<eos> To most people I'm a reporter at Catco Worldwide Media.<eos> But in secret, I work with my adoptive sister for the DEO to protect my city from alien life and anyone else that means to cause it harm.<eos> I am Supergirl.<eos> Previously on Supergirl...
Hey, Winn, I need you to look at the people on this flash drive.<eos> They're all missing.<eos> Can you check for, uh, links between them, their histories...<eos> Are you aware that you're wearing sunglasses...<eos> Indoors?
What're you doing here?<eos> Uh, I thought you might need my help.<eos> Hey, you're bleeding.<eos> That is a red sun.<eos> Like on Krypton and Daxam.
No, I, um...<eos> There we are.<eos> I was wrong.<eos> That's what I wanted to...<eos> About?
Time travel is real, and all of history is vulnerable to attack, which is why we must travel through time to stop the spread of these so-called time aberrations and to erase their damage to history.<eos> We are a team of outcasts and misfits, so, please, don't call us heroes.<eos> We're something else.<eos> We're legends.<eos> Previously, on "Legends of Tomorrow"...
I care about you.<eos> - Well...<eos> - I get that you don't care about me.<eos> - I do care about you.<eos> - But not in the same way.
Remember me?<eos> Are you okay?<eos> I was going to ask you the same question.<eos> Look!<eos> Up in the sky!
This is ridiculous.<eos> - Is it?<eos> - You know what, Kara?<eos> I knew you that you were a little full of yourself, like, a little bit.<eos> - Full of myself?
I totally get it, yeah.<eos> Anyway, I'm really glad you're okay.<eos> And I'm really, really happy that you didn't marry that guy.<eos> Me too.<eos> Anyway...

I mean, you saw all those sound bites.<eos> You use Supergirl as your source every time you want to get something past me.<eos> You said a good reporter should always cultivate her source.<eos> Sources.<eos> Plural.
What is it?<eos> What's going on?<eos> I'm trying to decide whether I should blog my article myself.<eos> Well, what happens if you blob it?<eos> - Blog.

Okay.<eos> Something to look forward to.<eos> What do you know about quantum entanglement?<eos> - "Quantum" wh...<eos> - Polyatomic anions?
Are you saying you want Mr. Olsen to question the boy?<eos> Well, Marcus doesn't trust me.<eos> Okay? But he could trust James.<eos> I mean, out of here.<eos> In a more conducive environment.
Supergirl is dark out of mission necessity.<eos> And I got a very trusted agent on my six.<eos> We're almost there.<eos> You good?<eos> So good.
This was supposed to be my cap gain.<eos> Anyway, I-I should be apologizing to you.<eos> Fucking right. But you should really apologize to your friend, since he's the one who took the actual pounding.<eos> Dad.<eos> God.
And then we'll be out of your hair.<eos> Toxicology says Todd Curry had a, a cocktail of drugs in his system, prescription stuff, stuff a doctor wouldn't mix.<eos> No 'cause it will make you sick.<eos> You see Keith at the bar.<eos> At the bus station, either way.
You cleaned up.<eos> It's done. It was nothing.<eos> It was fluids mostly.<eos> Where did you run into him?<eos> In a bar.
But there is no 'we' Keith, so I can shoot and no one will hear.<eos> I swear.<eos> Move back or I'll kill her.<eos> I wonder if you've got the strength to do that, Keith.<eos> In your state?
- You... you didn't?<eos> - No.<eos> 'Cause I got a text from Nikhil making fun of me for crapping my pants.<eos> No, I told him about a different time - that you crapped your pants. - Oh.<eos> - The subway? - No.
- No.<eos> 'Cause I got a text from Nikhil making fun of me for crapping my pants.<eos> No, I told him about a different time - that you crapped your pants. - Oh.<eos> - The subway? - No.<eos> The tramway?
And you implied Francis especially.<eos> Well, yeah.<eos> I mean...<eos> That was a whole other thing.<eos> In what way?
- That was rough.<eos> - It went fine.<eos> It's not sustainable.<eos> I mean, what do you think?<eos> -About what?
If I don't erase my files, cover my tracks--<eos> We're a week away from the election, Mr. Macallan.<eos> - Cover your tracks.<eos> - Okay.<eos> In which case,
Or you, to me?<eos> I mean, are you my girlfriend?<eos> And when you win... does that make me, like, First Boyfriend?<eos> First Concubine?<eos> About that article...
F.<eos> F.<eos> Thank you.<eos> So you can see that she's in good shape.<eos> Seaworthy.
Now let me say a word about that.<eos> Twizzlers? Why?<eos> Well, let me list for you the number of items I've unsuccessfully had applied in the near past.<eos> Electrical cords. Stingy.<eos> Not in a good way.
I'm in Human Resources, and we take that seriously here at McMillan.<eos> The human part.<eos> Yeah. Okay.<eos> How you doing, you know?<eos> Just overall, not professionally.
Yeah. Cool.<eos> That's cool.<eos> At my other job, I...<eos> Well, you can't even get a chair.<eos> Your former job?
Okay.<eos> I see unsuccessful people.<eos> Like, when you're asleep or...<eos> When-when you're awake?<eos> Just, like, at bus stations, in the mall, or what...
Oh, well, it's tapas style, so we can share everything. It's...<eos> What do you mean?<eos> Well, they're little share plates, which is great, 'cause then you can just get whatever you want, as much as you want, and we'll just<eos> - split the bill at the end. - We-we split it?<eos> - Like, equally? - Mm-hmm.
They brought the bag in there. Yeah, early this morning. With other things.<eos> You'll be going there today for your interviews, you men.<eos> Get it back.<eos> It's got my name. It's got John Lakeman on it.<eos> On what?
A few weeks.<eos> And this is your new personnel, the man who traveled to our city for the first time on the day of the 11th?<eos> Yes.<eos> Where did he work before McMillan?<eos> The Pentagon.
What?<eos> Nothing.<eos> What?<eos> I just didn't expect you to throw it like that.<eos> In that way.
And we place them in the world.<eos> The perfect form across the world.<eos> We make circles.<eos> And all you have to care about, the only thing that you have to care about, is this one little thing:<eos> perfection.
And I'll tell you why because there should be somebody here.<eos> There should be some kind of set-up team, a skeleton crew.<eos> You're thinking.<eos> Tell me what you're thinking about.<eos> A magic haddock.
- Closely.<eos> Before, when the Vardy, the little microbots, were going to attack you, you asked me where they came from.<eos> They didn't come from anywhere, they were here all the time.<eos> What?<eos> In the wall?

He turned it off and on again.<eos> I turned it off and on again.<eos> Of course, I wiped their memories.<eos> They no longer have the faintest idea who you are and, in fact, they're wondering what you're doing in their very nice city.<eos> THEIR city?

- Does it matter?<eos> - The boy's the one with your magic wand.<eos> - Sonic screwdriver.<eos> - How is that a screwdriver?<eos> - In a very broad sense.
- What?<eos> It's all right. You can tell him.<eos> It's a drawing.<eos> Here.<eos> On his hand.
No, please, please, please...<eos> Sixpence to the waterman... If you're quite finished,<eos> I could use some help.<eos> Sonic screwdriver.<eos> Inside pocket.
Eliza, you were very ill?<eos> Yes. Yes?<eos> The doctors had, um, given up on you, but then, one day, your father brings you a present...<eos> Where did you find them?<eos> On the roof?
Yes. Yes?<eos> The doctors had, um, given up on you, but then, one day, your father brings you a present...<eos> Where did you find them?<eos> On the roof?<eos> In the garden?
Not now, Albert.<eos> - It is an unorthodox idea, but...<eos> - Please be quiet.<eos> But crazier thoughts of mine have worked in the past. Pick me up!<eos> Oh, God.
Herr Einstein, are you still too busy contemplating the secrets of the cosmos to solve this equation?<eos> Oh, no, sir.<eos> I-I've already solved it.<eos> Leave. Now.<eos> On what offense?
I don't mean that literally, of course.<eos> Everybody knows that time can't move at two different speeds.<eos> What do you want me to do? Hmm?<eos> Deem me medically unfit to finish school.<eos> For what reason?
Please.<eos> You don't even like Germany.<eos> This is not about Germany.<eos> Elsa, this is about my work, my colleagues at the Academy, our friends, my sailboat, this apartment.<eos> Our life.
I bet she's teaching you more than that.<eos> Maja, please.<eos> I've been corresponding with her mother.<eos> Everyone is quite excited.<eos> - Excited?
Well, to our understanding, her political background is quite radical.<eos> This is nonsense.<eos> May I remind you, Mr. Geist, your country has invited me, not the other way around.<eos> Yes, Professor, but you have a history of... how shall I put this... controversy, which calls into question your loyalties...<eos> My loyalties?
Where's the lucky man?<eos> In the service?<eos> Was.<eos> Killed in action, some...<eos> Beach in france.
She's. A risk to herself, and to us if she makes a single false move.<eos> You will not contact her.<eos> Is there something.<eos> She's not at the park or the church.<eos> The cafe?
Where was she taken?<eos> Tell me where she is.<eos> Please.<eos> What are you thinking about?<eos> Dieppe. You.
They will figure out where we stand.<eos> We'll get you back in time if it's safe.<eos> Now, I know that I said we'd start out small, But that was before...<eos> I knew about your promotion.<eos> And your father-in-law.
That he's captured.<eos> We'll discuss this later.<eos> You were there.<eos> In dieppe.<eos> On the beach?
Run away?<eos> Move along.<eos> Rene.<eos> We left him behind.<eos> Tom too.
Move along.<eos> Rene.<eos> We left him behind.<eos> Tom too.<eos> And miri.
Not because I will it.<eos> Because I fight for her.<eos> Out there.<eos> But here?<eos> In my own home?
What?<eos> What do you mean?<eos> I know you're spoken for.<eos> Herr Grossmann told me.<eos> About Marie.
I know I said I wouldn't ask you for anything.<eos> And what I'm about to say may sound like I am, so...<eos> This is just an offer.<eos> Be my partner.<eos> In life, in love, in endless scientific pursuit.
You openly challenged my authority.<eos> You publicly disrespected me.<eos> How am I to justify sticking my head above the grass for you when there are so many qualified alumni who have actually earned my respect?<eos> But this is my reputation we're talking about.<eos> And mine, too!
It was childish of me.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> It wasn't you I was angry with.<eos> Tell me about the girl.<eos> The Serb.
You have your eyes set on the stars, Albert.<eos> It's who you are.<eos> It's what makes you wonderful.<eos> But think about her life.<eos> Here, on Earth.
Philipp, you read the journals your name is invoked with great regularity.<eos> Of course you are right.<eos> This patent clerk in Bern for instance.<eos> He's cited both of us in a paper on...<eos> Light quanta, yes, indeed.
We think moments like these will last forever, but in fact they'll pass in a split second.<eos> It's a nice sentiment, but you and I both know that time can't move at different speeds.<eos> Unless...<eos> Unless it could.<eos> My...
Oh, maybe when we're there, we'll have to deliver babies on the other side of the bed.<eos> You know, like the driving.<eos> Okay, that was funny.<eos> - What's up?<eos> - Nothing.
What is there to talk about?<eos> I finally got the job I always wanted, and... couldn't be happier.<eos> What's a turkey?<eos> Um, from the poultry family, popular on Thanksgiving?<eos> Bowling-wise.
- Who was on the phone?<eos> - Oh, it was nobody.<eos> Khalid's just translating a hieroglyph for me.<eos> Lucy, we are so close.<eos> And yet so far.
Yeah, their meat is old.<eos> Got your bachelor party all mapped out.<eos> 6:00 p.m., party starts.<eos> 8:00 p.m., blackout drunk.<eos> 10:00 p.m., blackout drunk again.
You know I couldn't wait to get out of Germany when I was a boy.<eos> If I came back, it would only be because I want to be with you.<eos> Is that so terrible?<eos> I'd... I'd very much like to... to be something to you, Elsa, but there are other people to consider.<eos> Mileva, of course, but most importantly, your daughters, and my sons.
He just got on with everyone.<eos> That's why this doesn't make sense.<eos> Was there anyone else in his life?<eos> Did he have a girlfriend?<eos> In the first year, yeah.
Alan, where were you?<eos> I'm sorry?<eos> It's a simple question.<eos> Early hours of Tuesday morning, last week, where were you?<eos> Manchester.
With Denis?<eos> You want me to pray for him?<eos> No, Christ, no.<eos> Well, sure, if it'd help like, but that's not what I was thinkin'.<eos> What?
That was your puzzle piece?<eos> You understand they smile all the time, right?<eos> Your father is the Governor of Louisiana, yes?<eos> Has he ever been to Angola?<eos> The country or the prison?
You understand they smile all the time, right?<eos> Your father is the Governor of Louisiana, yes?<eos> Has he ever been to Angola?<eos> The country or the prison?<eos> Either.
Er, a stiff drink is what I need.<eos> I know, I'm a lost cause.<eos> Not to me.<eos> Speaking of lost causes, where is Steve?<eos> In the pub.
I didn't.<eos> There's enough here for a jury to convict you.<eos> I didn't do it.<eos> But the question is, what will they convict you of?<eos> Cold-blooded murder?
Oh, they wouldn't.<eos> Not with us.<eos> What about this sort of disruption?<eos> Imagine your child having to deal with this.<eos> - At school, in the playground?
Because he was the man taking photos of us at the school.<eos> - She didn't mention him?<eos> - No.<eos> Did she ever mention anyone pestering her?<eos> Yeah. Kevin Russell.
This isn't my case any more.<eos> But it is.<eos> We're the same in that, at least.<eos> Once we take a case or a client, they're ours for always.<eos> For better or for worse.
I know, huh?<eos> Pathetic.<eos> Do you know what happened to Linda the night she disappeared?<eos> It was supposed to be our going-away party.<eos> At the old officers' mess.
Please remain in your seats.<eos> On what grounds are you holding me?<eos> All yours.<eos> Thanks.<eos> On what grounds?
So you better have something.<eos> I do, but it's not going to help your career.<eos> Just tell me.<eos> Linda had an American boyfriend.<eos> On the airbase.
Absolutely.<eos> She was handing out leaflets and knocking on doors in the pouring rain...'<eos> Why has she changed her hair?<eos> 'Well, I did win and Laura and I are in it together now for the long haul.<eos> For better or for worse.'
Emma, what's up?<eos> I think Greenwood was right.<eos> I AM being followed.<eos> A van, two men in it, outside my house.<eos> And at the cemetery.
What would I do without you?<eos> Margot, dear.<eos> I was just congratulating cousin Albert on his upcoming expedition.<eos> Where have you been?<eos> The academy.
The kaiser has heard through diplomatic channels.<eos> Freundlich is alive, as are his men.<eos> Wonderful news. In part.<eos> They're being interned in a prisoner-of-war camp.<eos> On what grounds?
I... may have a relevant piece of evidence, something that could be used as leverage if St. Patrick turned government's witness against Egan.<eos> The only problem is, if you use it, you're gonna have to choose between your two clients.<eos> Is it a recording?<eos> I'll... meet with you.<eos> Not in public.
I'm just saying I never took him to a party.<eos> Look, anything happening with Tariq, hell, the whole the family, you run it by me first.<eos> Make sure this shit goes off without a hitch.<eos> Mr. St. Patrick, earlier you stated that Thomas Egan was a close friend, that he'd do anything to help you in your time of need.<eos> Within rea...
It's a bad relationship, Tommy.<eos> I want you to cut all ties with him entirely.<eos> For good.<eos> And that's what you brought me to Chicago for?<eos> Mostly.
I never done a fucking thing to you.<eos> You ain't got no good reason to do this to me, Jukebox, or my son.<eos> Ain't about you.<eos> It's about his ten years inside.<eos> And money.
I don't fuckin' understand.<eos> - You said you set Kanan on fire. - I did.<eos> How the fuck is he still alive?<eos> Half of him is fuckin' burned, Tommy, okay?<eos> Scarred.
- Taystee.<eos> - Poussey.<eos> Your mama did not name you Pussy.<eos> Yo.<eos> For real?
They brushed my hair.<eos> Your eyebrows.<eos> They're plural.<eos> I had three once.<eos> Back in my punk-rock days.
You mean Home Alone.<eos> No.<eos> Well, why are we even talking about this?<eos> Piscatella's not the kind of man who slips on marbles.<eos> On ice.
- Nicky!<eos> You haven't seen her, have you?<eos> Well, no, we're going through this fun phase where she can't stand to look at me.<eos> I'm probably the wrong person to ask.<eos> Into thin air.
Wait.<eos> - Good night.<eos> Dead guard?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Over in the next bed.
- Of course she is, honey.<eos> In my faith, we call it paradise.<eos> I bet you she's up there right now, having a heck of a time looking down at us, laughing about this mess we got ourselves in.<eos> Wait, so, the dead bad person is up there with her?<eos> In the paradise-heaven-better-place?
It's too much death!<eos> It's too much.<eos> And... and you're all lying, lying, lying, lying!<eos> You liars!<eos> Oh, God!
- that we actually also have a Utica. - Mmm.<eos> Yeah, it's near New Haven.<eos> Well, now, aren't you just a little bundle of Connecticut trivia?<eos> I kill at trivia night.<eos> In Connecticut.
Yeah, it's near New Haven.<eos> Well, now, aren't you just a little bundle of Connecticut trivia?<eos> I kill at trivia night.<eos> In Connecticut.<eos> Specifically in Connecticut. Mmm.
- If you want me to stay, I'll stay.<eos> - What is it?<eos> - I'm serious... - I'm...<eos> Go.<eos> I actually...
For a whole year, I'm not gonna be there to watch his little belly at night, make sure he's still breathing.<eos> Remember to wash the little folds in his neck.<eos> Take those cute photos of him with a big bowl of spaghetti, with a meatball on top of his head and... and...<eos> Now his father's not gonna be there to do those things, either.<eos> Oh, my God!
What else were we supposed to do?<eos> Crazy is scary when she crazy-crazy.<eos> She needed to shut the fuck up for a little while.<eos> Well, now she's catatonic, so I hope you're all happy.<eos> Jesus!
Over here.<eos> Stay behind me.<eos> Watch your head.<eos> "From the ashes, we will rise."<eos> Not this guy.
Just moved into the area.<eos> Finally someone in Kembleford with a little bit of spunk.<eos> But have you not heard?<eos> Lucia Morell was attacked - blinded in one eye.<eos> Really? !
We're gonna keep hitting the ad.<eos> LeAnn's got callers lined up.<eos> Are you there yet?<eos> Almost.<eos> Then back on the plane.
Right.<eos> Uh, well...<eos> All I know is what they said in their list of demands.<eos> And they believed I would be elected president.<eos> But really, why?
I felt like a million.<eos> Yes.<eos> I went back to the office to see if I had any mail.<eos> Well, what do you mean they don't match?<eos> In my home state?
Now, wait a minute, Keyes.<eos> I don't rate this beef.<eos> The turnout in Philly is lower than they're saying.<eos> - How much lower?<eos> - 30% in our key precincts.
Doctor Einstein.<eos> Georg Nikolay.<eos> I'm Elsie's friend.<eos> She mentioned me.<eos> About the committee.
About him they write in Berlin,<eos> Frankfurt, Paris, London, New York, Tokyo ...<eos> I can continue.<eos> Yes, everything is about general relativity.<eos> On relativity, politics, his hair, breakfast ...
This was but one of many pogroms.<eos> Ukraine, Poland, even Argentina.<eos> Babies ripped from mothers' arms.<eos> Slaughtered.<eos> My God.
- but I need a good secretary...<eos> - Secretary?<eos> Was that the full extent of your relationship with Miss Neumann?<eos> You mean was I intimate with her?<eos> Sexually?
Look...<eos> I do cast some experimental projects on the side, if you are open to that kind of thing.<eos> - What kind of thing?<eos> - Would you consider erotica?<eos> Porn?
I do cast some experimental projects on the side, if you are open to that kind of thing.<eos> - What kind of thing?<eos> - Would you consider erotica?<eos> Porn?<eos> Like, in the Valley?
You heard the big man.<eos> Go ahead.<eos> First up, forward rolls.<eos> - Whoa.<eos> - Just like preschool.
Go ahead.<eos> First up, forward rolls.<eos> - Whoa.<eos> - Just like preschool.<eos> Not like preschool.
It's one thing to write a letter, another thing entirely to help build a bomb.<eos> So you find a Russian girlfriend and now I have no one to speak up for me.<eos> Leo, what on Earth are you talking about?<eos> Well, they obviously suspect her.<eos> Of what?
Eliot, who are you talking to?<eos> They can't see me.<eos> I'm not technically here.<eos> I'm incepting your ass!<eos> Your head.
They can't see me.<eos> I'm not technically here.<eos> I'm incepting your ass!<eos> Your head.<eos> Your dreams.
I've always been good at math.<eos> - Hi. You okay?<eos> - Oh, shit.<eos> Yeah, I'm okay.<eos> - Okay.
On both sides, means of mass destruction are being perfected with feverish haste, and behind walls of secrecy.<eos> And now the production of the hydrogen bomb will be accomplished.<eos> If these efforts prove successful, annihilation of all life on Earth will have been brought within the range of what is possible.<eos> Outside the United States we establish military bases.<eos> Inside the United States...
You probably thought about aborting me.<eos> That's OK.<eos> I mean, you didn't, so, yay.<eos> So, do you know what you want to do?<eos> With my life?
And I'm gonna...<eos> I'm gonna have a party.<eos> - Oh, really?<eos> - In Alabama.<eos> Oh, Alabama.
She'll be here soon enough.<eos> Where are the boats?<eos> Without ALIE, there's no reason to be here.<eos> According to Thelonious' map, the lab is in the middle of the Island,<eos> 5 miles straight ahead.
People have a right to know that they're working for nothing.<eos> Is there a fire? Everything all right?<eos> Not for you.<eos> You're not on the list. What list?<eos> Attention, Arkadia.
One of the hallways is filled with mist, and there's another body in it.<eos> Jesus.<eos> What the hell is going on?<eos> Where was it?<eos> Which hallway?
Jesus.<eos> What the hell is going on?<eos> Where was it?<eos> Which hallway?<eos> This one.
It wasn't working.<eos> We'll find another way.<eos> Give us a minute.<eos> You ever seen those guys before?<eos> In the mall?
We'll find another way.<eos> Give us a minute.<eos> You ever seen those guys before?<eos> In the mall?<eos> Around town?
Something happened, some sort of misunderstanding.<eos> Clarke, if he wanted to talk, he wouldn't be coming with his army.<eos> Right, but there's only one way to get here from Polis.<eos> - I'll ride out and meet him. - Are you...<eos> No, absolutely not.
30.<eos> Fine.<eos> Deal.<eos> Is how that would go.<eos> In a nutshell.
The train station?<eos> I might be able to track oil shipments.<eos> You're gonna need some polish papers.<eos> I'll see what I can find.<eos> At the office.
You brought the map?<eos> The code word for oil is "wood by-products."<eos> I know which trains are carrying it.<eos> Based on their routes, there are two possible locations that could be refineries.<eos> Here, in czarna,
The code word for oil is "wood by-products."<eos> I know which trains are carrying it.<eos> Based on their routes, there are two possible locations that could be refineries.<eos> Here, in czarna,<eos> And one here... in ryba?
They exist right here in Seattle, right under our noses.<eos> What makes you say that?<eos> My brother Dave showed me a photo of a zombie.<eos> It was gnarly.<eos> Like him.
So, this is our little fox trap, huh?<eos> Yeah.<eos> So, you want to tell me where you hooked up with your partner?<eos> The Dirty Dozen?<eos> Ah. Fillory.
Shall we have a couple more?<eos> You don't think you ought to get back?<eos> I suppose you're right.<eos> The first days are difficult... they say.<eos> Even in the most romantic marriages.
Where are you?<eos> Jenny?<eos> Guten morgen, Paul.<eos> Don't you think she's the most wonderful woman in the world?<eos> In what way?
- Paul.<eos> What's brought you to this part of the world?<eos> Trying to get away from an architect. I'm a teacher.<eos> I tutor a boy who lives locally in a big house.<eos> At King's Thursday?
I'm going to make an order restraining The World and The World Online from any further publication or dissemination of this video either online or in print.<eos> I will reserve costs of the hearing of the action.<eos> I'm sorry I was late.<eos> I was on the phone to the minister, and...<eos> Well...
The stoning mob are gonna move on.<eos> You're a very kind woman.<eos> Let's go home.<eos> So the camera's in there?<eos> In the knob?
Let's go home.<eos> So the camera's in there?<eos> In the knob?<eos> MEG: Certainly is.<eos> On the top.
Nothing.<eos> Cold, cold, cold, cold, cold.<eos> Boss?<eos> Where are you?<eos> Morocco.
I have a medical expert to call - - Mrs. Nuala Phipps.<eos> No.<eos> I don't believe it.<eos> Ray, can you get to Roycoft's in Bride Street?<eos> In 15 minutes?
Many years ago... when I was about the same age as you are, come to think of it -- God.<eos> How odd is that?<eos> I was engaged.<eos> Then I met your mother...<eos> at a party.
I mean... these things aren't binary.<eos> I still loved your mum and respected her and all that, but...<eos> Did Mum know how you felt?<eos> Never spoken of.<eos> Not our style.
I woke up in a hotel this morning.<eos> You're living in the fucking Pierre.<eos> This was the Americana Suites, some shit dive next to Port Authority, with my ass on fire.<eos> And... I saw I had a tattoo.<eos> On your ass?
You assert that Mr. Rhoades harassed you.<eos> Off the record.<eos> Where are you sleeping now?<eos> Bobby.<eos> Suitable accommodations.
Shouldn't we acknowledge their outrage?<eos> I'd say we should tread lightly.<eos> For now, we're just asking for their patience.<eos> Okay, let's do it.<eos> Never a dull moment in this country.
The King tells me the Queen would have me wed.<eos> She wishes to draw attention from her own sister.<eos> If it would benefit the King then... I will do whatever is asked of me, but if not, then...<eos> I would sooner... Have my leave to stay at court.<eos> At court?
What name do you answer to, Edward?<eos> Why so much time on the sword?<eos> Surely comportment lessons would serve him better.<eos> He must have the rudiments of defense or he won't last in battle.<eos> Battle?
She is ill-wishing Arthur.<eos> She says he will not be king. She is wishing him to die.<eos> Don't listen to her, Lizzie.<eos> She is only on her own side.<eos> Never ours.
He said he would trust him with his life.<eos> No matter what he said or did to fool his enemies, he was a York right to his core.<eos> Then Lovell is our man.<eos> Where can we find him?<eos> York...
He is so tiny.<eos> But he is strong though.<eos> You see?<eos> Lizzie, what did you mean about a curse?<eos> Nothing.
You cannot be surprised that when he won the throne he sought to punish you.<eos> No, not surprised.<eos> He spent his life in brothels and in cow-sheds.<eos> What would he know of politics?<eos> Or pain.
You said you wanted to spend the day with him.<eos> Yeah, I said I wanted to spend time with him, and I did.<eos> You used him as a prop. Which you swore you'd never do, since that's exactly what your father did to you.<eos> We spent the morning at the park. And a reporter happened upon us because, at the moment, I am news-worthy.<eos> Finally in a good way.
- Yeah.<eos> - Shall we get on with the show?<eos> - Yeah, it's time.<eos> On with the show.<eos> In our car show this week...
It wasn't, though, was it?<eos> Cos the only thing to explode was his knackers.<eos> - Can we get on with the show?<eos> - Yes. Good idea.<eos> Because in tonight's car programme...
Why do you look so miserable?<eos> I've broken my arm.<eos> If we're gonna drive round a track, can I at least have one of those disabled knob things?<eos> - You know.<eos> - On the steering wheel?
Nope.<eos> I didn't.<eos> Fine.<eos> What do you wanna talk about?<eos> My day.
Why? I'm looking for a physics tutor.<eos> I hear he's pretty smart.<eos> Ethan's brother had him last semester.<eos> --Heard he was weird.<eos> --Weird how?
...[Solara] Ah. Okay.<eos> Well, I can take over for him, if you're interested.<eos> So, uh, where did you learn?<eos> At the monastery where I grew up.<eos> A monastery?
...Why not?<eos> ...Well, it's just... [Normal voice] ... I don't date guys whose asses I've kicked.<eos> [Adrian] Hmm...<eos> Okay, okay... Let's focus on the plan.<eos> What plan?
I was on a ship.<eos> People died.<eos> You've have to stop blaming yourself.<eos> What happened on Hyadum12 was not your fault.<eos> Hyadum12?
That was Boone... not me.<eos> Hey.<eos> So... what's going on?<eos> What's going on where, Two?<eos> Well... Here, mostly.
Well, it's a very different look for you, and I was wondering why.<eos> Well...<eos> Finally learning the truth about my origin has caused me to reconsider who and what I am.<eos> I learned I'm special, Two.<eos> In a good way.
Objection!<eos> Prejudicial.<eos> Overruled.<eos> The People intend to disprove the defendant's alibi that he was outside at the time of the murder, rollerskating.<eos> Objection! Rollercising.
This is a surprise.<eos> Yeah, come on in.<eos> My mom told me,<eos> "Never judge someone until you walk a mile in their shoes."<eos> Or in this case, skates.
Maybe stop trying to make me like you.<eos> - Fair enough.<eos> - What happened to the kids in that picture?<eos> - Picture?<eos> Oh, from the, um, the exhibit?
I found a code hidden deep within Charlene's ledgers.<eos> Charlene?<eos> She found a way to let you know where she is?<eos> No, I think this clue leads someplace else, and I don't think it was left for me.<eos> Ebb Tide manufacturing in Moose Creek, Alaska?
Nothing magicky, just that it usually occurs with people with limited mobility, advanced age, obesity, poor health...<eos> - None of which fit our victims.<eos> - Victims?<eos> Victims?<eos> Plural?
Mirror.<eos> I need to speak to Captain Martens.<eos> Come.<eos> What's on your mind, Sergeant?<eos> My dad.
We're done here.<eos> What happened to my team?<eos> You'll get a firing squad for this.<eos> Were you testing a weapon on us?<eos> On your own soldiers?
If that thing out there really is some sort of human-protocrap hybrid, then we're yesterday's model.<eos> Obsolete.<eos> We'll see about that.<eos> There it is!<eos> In the Ag Dome.
- Understood?<eos> - Not my first rodeo.<eos> Oh, "cowgirl," consider yourself a diplomatic observer on this rodeo.<eos> You served.<eos> SIGINT, back in the day.
Fine.<eos> Five minutes.<eos> Yes!<eos> What do you wanna talk about?<eos> Sex.
We have to go home!<eos> But we have to go to Texas.<eos> Randy needs me.<eos> He's saying it on his Snapchat story.<eos> Still on the movie set.
That's insane.<eos> The "This is a cry for attention" was implied.<eos> What I heard was, "This isn't enough for me," and since we can't make it work, it just... it's... it's too hard for me to see you.<eos> Yeah, yeah, yeah, I heard what you said on the movie set.<eos> In Texas?
Why don't we go try those in the Target parking lot?<eos> Ugh, I can't wait to be a mom so I can get the good cat tranqs.<eos> You know they didn't pay, right?<eos> Hey, uh... sorry to barge in, but I can't stop thinking about...<eos> Her boo-tay?
What do you think we can ask for?<eos> The maximum, what is it, ten years?<eos> Let's offer five.<eos> Lowest I'll go is 18 months.<eos> Jail time?
He said they couldn't hurt him while he was in office.<eos> He was padding it.<eos> All right, look, you can't know this, but it didn't go away when we moved for dismissal. He's gonna be deposed next week.<eos> He could be on the hook for a lot of damage... to his reputation, not to mention his bank account...<eos> Your bank account.
Why are you missing it, by the way?<eos> You don't wanna party with me?<eos> It's my sister's wedding.<eos> Rehearsal dinner on Mackinac Island in the U.P.<eos> - Michigan.
Yes, thank you.<eos> Are you sure no coffee?<eos> No, thank you.<eos> Pound cake.<eos> Seventy percent sour cream.
Let's stop for today.<eos> What's happening with my wax statue?<eos> Gary and I were able to have you placed on the replica of the Truman Balcony.<eos> - Oh! - So, it's very, very high up.<eos> - And safe.
We do need a bit more of the presidency in there.<eos> I mean, the book ends with you going off to college.<eos> That's right, yes, and the presidential stuff will be in volume two...<eos> "Meyer Ascendant."<eos> - And three... "The Meyer Year."
I slept with Tom James!<eos> - Whoa! - No!<eos> In the white-hot White House.<eos> In the Oval with your running mate? !<eos> - On a couch.
- Why?<eos> What?<eos> - He's one of those real good ol' boys and he thinks that you're a little Upper East Side.<eos> Are you kidding me?<eos> Me?
- Richard:<eos> Hey, ma'am.<eos> Ma'am, Catherine's in an ambulance.<eos> - She's having some bad bleeding.<eos> - Oh, my God, on the couch?
There's work to be done.<eos> Luckily we have some time for you today.<eos> Steve believed the sourcer should be sourced, "so clarity is ensured."<eos> - What are you really looking for?<eos> - In life?
You know, rolled-up trouser leg, white ball you're in, black ball you're out.<eos> - He's a Mason?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Enough of them about.<eos> Especially amongst my lot.
- No, we didn't see him.<eos> We were all here.<eos> You were in your room, weren't you?<eos> She was with me.<eos> At the surgery.
Let's go, Earl.<eos> All right, fine.<eos> I left my knees there, anyway.<eos> Hey, I was, uh... I was just in the neighborhood and thought I'd hop on two subways and a Citi Bike and come say hi.<eos> A Citi Bike?
Oh, sure, I see it now.<eos> Let's go to Target.<eos> And, uh, what about you?<eos> Any third dates coming up?<eos> Actually, no.
Han, I need you to flirt with Denise.<eos> - She likes you.<eos> - I got that.<eos> Her hand is on my knee.<eos> Oop, not my knee anymore.
- No, I have actual dreams.<eos> - Dreams.<eos> No, seriously, man.<eos> - I play saxophone.<eos> - Saxophone.
You know, tell him how you feel, stand up for yourself.<eos> I'm not great with confrontation, partially because I had bad depth perception.<eos> Like, I have no idea how far away you are right now.<eos> I'm right here.<eos> On second base.
Come.<eos> Hi, Dad.<eos> There's some food on the stove if you want.<eos> Where's Mom?<eos> In the living room.
What?<eos> You wouldn't be referring to a government missile silo, by any chance, would you?<eos> What gives you that idea? Your shirt.<eos> It says you worked at<eos> - a government missile silo.
- Brrrap!<eos> That's what I'm talking about!<eos> Yes!<eos> You guys suck!<eos> - Not at volleyball or penises.
Who wants to suck?<eos> What are you doing?<eos> You should suck his neck.<eos> Hi, um, we have Molly.<eos> In this bag.
Oh! Sweet lady pain's on pike?<eos> I may have visited her establishment once or twice for an investigative piece.<eos> Do you remember where you were the night of her murder?<eos> Same place I am every time you've accused me of murder.<eos> On the air.
A congressman was ducking him... and he came back to his office to find the president sitting in his chair... waiting for him.<eos> The president expects to see you within the hour.<eos> Miss Fazio can give you the specifics.<eos> -He was wearing his cowboy hat.<eos> President Johnson.
-Yeah.<eos> She sends her best.<eos> Yeah, okay.<eos> -Where's Charlie?<eos> -In the living room.
If I'd known, I would have...<eos> Would have what?<eos> It's probably nothing.<eos> I just didn't say this with the other policeman.<eos> What?
- Did you ever meet her?<eos> - No.<eos> That's strange.<eos> So when might this have been taken?<eos> Sunderland, maybe?
Is there somewhere quiet we can talk, love?<eos> - I mean...<eos> - Yeah, come with me.<eos> I heard they found a body.<eos> Mm. Burntridge Moor.
He goes after her, turns out it's Lorna.<eos> Big mistake.<eos> Sorry to interrupt, ma'am.<eos> Uniform have reported a disturbance.<eos> Brindale.
You think he killed her?<eos> No, I'm keeping an open mind, love.<eos> Why, do you think he killed her?<eos> I was with Jan the day the girl disappeared.<eos> Aye, in the pub.
- George, where are you?<eos> - Hello?<eos> George, that string of tip-offs you had, Mia Hinkin case.<eos> - You still got all that on your computer?<eos> - Aye, still on the system.
- Now, who called that in?<eos> - Erm... male caller.<eos> Rang Missing Persons three days after Mia disappeared.<eos> Witness reported seeing a girl walking along the road, 7:30pm, - on the night she was last seen. - Well, where was that?<eos> Er, just off the 629.
I just wanted to tell you how much I admired Sunny.<eos> He always inspired me and the other guys.<eos> No one would ever accuse him of saying too much, but when he went into action, it was a beautiful thing to behold.<eos> The grace ofis sword strokes, he made killing look so easy.<eos> Well, to Sunny.
He always inspired me and the other guys.<eos> No one would ever accuse him of saying too much, but when he went into action, it was a beautiful thing to behold.<eos> The grace ofis sword strokes, he made killing look so easy.<eos> Well, to Sunny.<eos> To Sunny.
Our world is at a tipping point.<eos> A war is the last thing it can endure.<eos> And if you lose the vote, a war will surely follow.<eos> It is for that reason and that reason alone I'm willing to throw my full support behind you...<eos> On one condition.
Amelia tells me I got you to thank.<eos> Anything you need, it's yours.<eos> We need fuel.<eos> And the fastest route to the wall's checkpoint.<eos> The wall?
Goodbye, Waldo.<eos> Now I remember why I married you first.<eos> What is it?<eos> I just always thought you'd die on horseback, under a big sky, wind and blood in your hair.<eos> Not in this rat hole.
I never wanted them here in the first place.<eos> But I assure you, Herr Brigadefuhrer, Fraulein Adlr has been reprimanded and relieved of her more sensitive duties.<eos> The Resistance may have had prior knowledge of the action, but they were still surprised.<eos> With the recent attacks to the trains, I had the troops rerouted to arrive<eos> - in Nadzieja by truck instead.
Berlin Station!<eos> Welcome to Germany, Dagna.<eos> Her name's Ania.<eos> What a relief to be back home.<eos> On the next X Company...
I don't know.<eos> The same.<eos> Huh. I hate to admit it, but it's actually got me thinking - about a few things regarding you.<eos> - Oh. And you still haven't answered my question.<eos> About what?
Come on, it's just a joke.<eos> This isn't.<eos> I know that.<eos> All due respect, whose hands do you think my life should be in right now?<eos> Mine.
I'm telling you, man, it's wrecked.<eos> I thought I told you to stay put.<eos> That's the thing about me...<eos> I don't stay still.<eos> Not for long, anyway.
They were headed to scrub in like an hour ago.<eos> - Oh, man! Spina bifida!<eos> - Are you okay?<eos> Me?<eos> Okay?
Yeah, this guy is all stare and no talk.<eos> I'm gonna check on Patterson.<eos> Okay.<eos> How's my son?<eos> Still in surgery.
We'll handle the key fob.<eos> We'll get the computer.<eos> Come on, honey.<eos> Hard to believe we ever lived in a place so...<eos> Normal?
What's it for?<eos> I don't know, but I recognize the letters.<eos> Riley School of Alternative Energy.<eos> The school has a hazardous materials containment system.<eos> Right here on campus.
Your obsession with the movie "Speed" has become very unhealthy.<eos> You know, Boston, I might actually miss you when you go to California.<eos> - _ - Wait...<eos> You made this?<eos> In a different life.
Take as many as you want, anytime.<eos> Each of us is vital to the building of our...<eos> Thanks.<eos> I was hoping we could talk.<eos> - About what?
We're just confused.<eos> Well, Tess asked me to teach her how to play chess, 'cause she's got a tournament at school tomorrow night.<eos> Well, I guess, technically, it's tonight.<eos> - When did you enter a chess...<eos> - Last month.
What did I say?<eos> Sophie, will you please just slow down?<eos> Leave me alone.<eos> Why don't you stop so I can at least talk to you for a second?<eos> About what?
You did not.<eos> I did, indeed.<eos> - You're Suehee?<eos> - Yep.<eos> In the flesh.
Apologies if I'm a little sweaty.<eos> That's all good in the hood.<eos> So, did Sarah tell you about our potential new wind farm client?<eos> In pre-construction, in Alberta, yeah.<eos> Calgary.
It's just one of those things, you know?<eos> Yeah, you sort of known about this for a long time, though. This...<eos> That's right.<eos> Okay.<eos> Um... all right, well, whatever.
I think that you choked.<eos> I think that you realized without the help of five takes and a laugh track, you're nothing but a 40-year-old playboy with no talent.<eos> 36 years...<eos> Doesn't matter, doesn't matter.<eos> Neither here nor there.
I hope you don't mind me asking... how's William doing?<eos> I haven't seen him lately and I was starting to get worried.<eos> I know his health wasn't all that good.<eos> Uh, William died last week.<eos> In Memphis.
I don't know, sweetheart.<eos> Put it on, babe.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I want to tell you what's been going on with me.<eos> About... my dad.
I could do worse, and, you know, honestly, I actually really get the whole girl thing.<eos> I do.<eos> But, you know, for me, I could just never get past... this.<eos> Well, for me, it's never just been about...<eos> "this."
I took a swing.<eos> You certainly did.<eos> It's excellent.<eos> Does it get easier?<eos> Uh, the writing?
It matches to Tim Ifield.<eos> Team briefing, one minute.<eos> Team briefing.<eos> Office or meeting room, boss?<eos> Incident Room.
I've told you, I don't know who he is.<eos> We'd set up an identity parade where we can show you video footage.<eos> We need a positive ID that can stand up in court.<eos> I'd have to go to court?<eos> No. No way.
Who does he think he is?<eos> A tosser, that's who.<eos> Night, Sarge.<eos> All right?<eos> All right.
[But, you know...]<eos> Anyway, I think we should find a bit of time and maybe, you know, we could discuss your future.<eos> Yeah, I'd like that, sir, thank you.<eos> I'm following the shift pattern of my undercover, but I could do a drink one night?<eos> Or in the office next week.
Faber's not going. To help us, Unless I hand over the recording of sabine first.<eos> That's our leverage.<eos> Why would we give up our only leverage?<eos> He has my son, william.<eos> Here, in berlin.
Manfred, like you said, we don't have much time.<eos> Sorry, it's all happening.<eos> Rather quickly.<eos> Which piece will hang.<eos> In the library?
Sorry, it's all happening.<eos> Rather quickly.<eos> Which piece will hang.<eos> In the library?<eos> The library?
It's right here.<eos> Now we're even.<eos> Show us we were right.<eos> Not much further.<eos> Nearly there.
Yeah.<eos> Hey.<eos> Where was my part?<eos> What do you mean?<eos> In your jerk-off space opera.
Oh!<eos> - What?<eos> - In Palm Springs?<eos> No.<eos> Here. The Valley.
No.<eos> Here. The Valley.<eos> Look, we learned a valuable lesson over the weekend.<eos> Cloistering yourself up like some 17th-century monk makes you way more fucking productive and helps you focus.<eos> - Like Olympic Village?
Look, we learned a valuable lesson over the weekend.<eos> Cloistering yourself up like some 17th-century monk makes you way more fucking productive and helps you focus.<eos> - Like Olympic Village?<eos> - Sure.<eos> Or rehab.
Who said you get to invent your own character?<eos> - Well, you didn't give me one, so...<eos> - I'm still marinating on it.<eos> I get really anxious when I feel like I'm behind.<eos> Especially in a group setting.
It's safe.<eos> You see, me?<eos> I like to push the envelope.<eos> I like to jolt people into consciousness.<eos> Like my first feature credit.
Yeah, good. A book is really gonna help save this.<eos> I am moving back in.<eos> I have been sleeping on my cousin's couch for two weeks.<eos> - I have given you space.<eos> - A couch?
- A survey?<eos> - Yes, yes.<eos> Mm-hmm.<eos> - About mayonnaise?<eos> - Yes, about mayonnaise.
I understand.<eos> And I'll account for myself honestly.<eos> You and I have met before.<eos> On my first morning here.<eos> In your parking lot.
When you, um...<eos> I'm not sure of the word.<eos> - Collapsed.<eos> - Collapsed.<eos> On the street.
She gets mad at me.<eos> She says I don't take her out enough.<eos> So... what's with the horse head?<eos> My cousin Michael is chess champion.<eos> Eighteen-and-under division. Very good.
Oh, hey.<eos> Everyone's looking for you.<eos> I know.<eos> That's why I was in the woods.<eos> The woods?
When there's no more money, it's over.<eos> So, we're canceled.<eos> Well, technically, you can't really be canceled if you haven't aired.<eos> But we're on hiatus.<eos> Open-ended.
For the fig juice.<eos> Okay.<eos> Um, I'll be right back. I'm just gonna go get a soda.<eos> So, that's the guy?<eos> In the Beemer right there?
My dad... is an... astronomer.<eos> He, was.<eos> He...<eos> He... he died...<eos> last year.
Cassiopeia...<eos> Bootes, Canis Major,<eos> Lupus...<eos> Telescopium.<eos> In the sky.
You will take her as your lady, which will at least appease the Scots.<eos> Tell me of your brother.<eos> What was he like?<eos> It was a long time ago.<eos> Another lifetime.
They know.<eos> You can't help her.<eos> Not yet.<eos> Aren't you gonna ask about him?<eos> The diver?
Found a way for us to be together.<eos> A place.<eos> Did you tell him what you found out there?<eos> Philly?<eos> Dr. Poole?
You knew.<eos> I was scared.<eos> Well, you don't have to be scared anymore.<eos> Are you... did we come here for a reason?<eos> The old house.
Good evening.<eos> We are here tonight to talk about violence.<eos> Or maybe human nature.
And on her behind, for the sake of the blind, was the same information in Braille.<eos> Mmm. Mm. Oliver Bird.<eos> Dedicated follower of fashion.<eos> Have I seen you before?<eos> At the poetry slam?
And they must have fought.<eos> Did they fight with their fists?<eos> Uh... no.<eos> They fought here.<eos> In the Astral Plane.
Hurricane Herman is over, the sailboat is working perfectly and we'll be back to Damocles Dock by morning.<eos> We're as safe as can possibly be expected.<eos> Maybe... maybe you could think back to a time when you were a little more fierce and formidable.<eos> - Where did you find this?<eos> - In the library.
Nope.<eos> Not me.<eos> Some of us got left behind.<eos> So what do you do when you're stranded in the wrong place?<eos> The wrong time?
Tomorrow you get pegged for your boss's murder.<eos> "Obscure Actress J.H. Bond Murders Theater Owner."<eos> Obscure?<eos> What happened to you in Titan?<eos> Titan?
What exactly is it you want?<eos> I've been running a long while in a single direction, forward in time.<eos> I know the feeling.<eos> Tomorrow is a poor place to hide.<eos> But yesterday?
It's hurting her.<eos> It's awful.<eos> - No one deserves...<eos> - I'm not talking about Olivia.<eos> The machine.
He's talking about their families.<eos> They're not causing the tragedies, they're taking advantage of them.<eos> Preying on the ones left behind.<eos> That's how they're finding their Faithful.<eos> Funerals.
Finally.<eos> They tell us time heals all wounds.<eos> And I believe it creates them.<eos> Tell me. For whom do you grieve?<eos> My husband.
Either an end to your pain, or a reason for it.<eos> People just want to believe they have control over their own fate.<eos> Good luck with that.<eos> What do you think, Gale?<eos> About fate?
Good luck.<eos> _<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> What you said back there.<eos> - At the cemetery.
But what is all this say about him?<eos> That he's exceptional.<eos> And damaged, and aware that he's both.<eos> But also incredibly uncertain.<eos> - Of what?
That he's exceptional.<eos> And damaged, and aware that he's both.<eos> But also incredibly uncertain.<eos> - Of what?<eos> - Of himself.
Where's Lucinda?<eos> Mr. Hockley, protect the Witness!<eos> Damn it.<eos> They've come for me.<eos> Down the hall!
But I don't know when this is.<eos> Yes, you do.<eos> It's not in the future.<eos> And I'm gonna go ahead and say it's not in the past.<eos> My present.
Only you can bring it.<eos> I couldn't.<eos> No matter how much I tried.<eos> But you... You're better than me.<eos> Every way.
Can you find them?<eos> Yes.<eos> Then proceed.<eos> Where are you right now?<eos> When?
Pepper vodka.<eos> Let me guess.<eos> Slapped anyone in a grocery store, lately?<eos> Look familiar?<eos> A certain video?
I don't think it, I know it.<eos> Open your eyes.<eos> Blaine loses his memory and just like that, all his problems are gone.<eos> He's got Mr. boss off his back, his brain business is raking in dough since there's no cure for being a zombie,<eos> And, oh...
Meaning you don't have an alibi for the time of the murder.<eos> Well, when I left Tim's house...<eos> But that's not what we need to talk about.<eos> What we need to talk about this.<eos> This baseball.
She slept with Blaine, which, first of all, ew, and second of all, I can't even.<eos> Do you think perhaps you might be reacting a bit more dramatically than usual due to your recent meal?<eos> It's actually called being supportive.<eos> You should maybe try it some time.<eos> My god!
Thank you, Frau Bauer.<eos> It means a great deal to me that you are here.<eos> For Sabine.<eos> A friend like you.<eos> At a time like this.
If you let me go and stop illegal actions in this area, I won't send anyone to harm you.<eos> Call it a cease fire.<eos> These are not German villages.<eos> You are on Polish soil.<eos> On our land.
Tom cummings. Alfred graves."<eos> I saw him in paris and poland.<eos> They left you in charge?<eos> Where is he now?<eos> Here in berlin?
We want to know where they are.<eos> Haven't seen them for months.<eos> I don't take. Pleasure in brutality, But my orders are to do what is necessary.<eos> Where are they?<eos> Probably back in paris by now.
Then you know what we're capable of.<eos> I saw you.<eos> I saw your boss.<eos> That kind of work?<eos> Not your cup of tea.
Your breakthrough. In the revolutionary discipline of synthetic oil production. Sets us free from our dependence.<eos> On fuel from foreign soils. Your formula will create. An exponential increase in production.<eos> When shall we expect production to begin?<eos> I'm still finalizing the formula.<eos> Within days, reichsfuhrer.
- Look out!<eos> Hold on.<eos> Are you ok?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> You? - Yeah.
He was a munitions expert linked to the New Martyrs Brigade.<eos> The NMB is deadly enough to rank number six on the Group Threat Index.<eos> Based in Libya, they have loyal supporters in countries throughout the region.<eos> I have documentation of attacks in 17 different countries.<eos> Yeah, but none on US soil.
Maybe somebody moved her arm before or after the photograph was taken?<eos> Either way, all I can tell you is this - that's how I remember it.<eos> Father, it's Mrs McCarthy!<eos> She's trapped, hiding from Wilbur.<eos> In plain sight.
All right there?<eos> Oh, can I help you?<eos> I was looking for something on butterflies.<eos> Butterflies?<eos> Yeah, butterflies.
And here's me thinking you're a respectable man of the cloth!<eos> Do you want to stay in here all night?<eos> Help me discover the truth and you might make last orders.<eos> All right, I'll tell you.<eos> On one condition.
Look, it's always returned within a day or so, sometimes even on the same day.<eos> Do you think someone was hiding the photographs inside it?<eos> Was Lewis pressurising you into selling the pictures?<eos> I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> Butterflies.
Either way, any jury would take one look at that thug and sentence him to hang.<eos> I'll let you know if you're needed as witnesses.<eos> Well, he certainly looked guilty to me.<eos> Perhaps.<eos> But not of murder.
When we make history?<eos> Well, I-I...<eos> - At the table?<eos> - At the table.<eos> At the table.
Yeah, well, luckily, you don't have to.<eos> I'm sorry?<eos> It's my name on the hospital.<eos> As an Avery, I officially grant us permission to make history... together.<eos> At the table.
Let's go.<eos> Ah, Helena.<eos> Let's try this again.<eos> This is more your style, isn't it?<eos> Down here in the filth and garbage.
What?<eos> Virginia!<eos> Sir, I think it would be best if you stayed here.<eos> - Do you?<eos> - In this state, yes.
What are you feeling now?<eos> Cold.<eos> Frightened.<eos> Can you tell me where that lives, in your body?<eos> In my hands.
Um... don't be mad.<eos> I'm not mad.<eos> When did you decide this?<eos> In jail. Juvenile detention.<eos> In jail. Juvenile detention.
No, no, hey. What?<eos> What is it?<eos> I want to continue my climb.<eos> Here.<eos> In the city.
Please, a perforated eardrum heals.<eos> Meaning I can do this again and again.<eos> So... answer me this.<eos> What does the FBI know about me?<eos> About my organization?
It was already bad when I first picked her up.<eos> I tried to talk her through the breathing and everything, but she just yells.<eos> - Aah! - That's okay.<eos> - Are you guys close? - Aah!<eos> Like two blocks.
I am gonna divorce my husband.<eos> Aah! No, I'm gonna kill that son of a...<eos> Big inhale.<eos> That jerk is out shopping right now.<eos> Shopping!
Because what? 'Cause he did a hand?<eos> - Are you kidding?<eos> - Then when will he learn?<eos> On another surgery... or two, or three maybe.<eos> Not on this one.
I'm so sorry.<eos> What?<eos> Why?<eos> It was me.<eos> In the other car...
What I'm saying is, the chief gives an order, you... you follow the order.<eos> You... You try to make it work.<eos> Spoken like a true soldier.<eos> Spoken like a former chief.<eos> Right on both counts.
Hey, you got a minute?<eos> Ah. Just got paged to the pit.<eos> Can it wait?<eos> I need to talk to you about this Minnick situation.<eos> What situation?
Her radiation caused some fibrosis, which made things a little tricky.<eos> I would've preferred to have waited another week.<eos> I wanted to wait two.<eos> I'm sorry. I haven't followed up on the... the thing.<eos> Dinner?
You're sure it's a met?<eos> It's right where the bile drains from your liver, so that would explain your pain.<eos> You're saying I have another tumor?<eos> No, she's saying that cells from the original tumor have traveled and grown in another place.<eos> In my liver?
Oh. Maggie went to get me some tea or something.<eos> Well, that's fine.<eos> You know, I wanted to chat...<eos> Well?<eos> ...about the clinical trial.
Thanks.<eos> Is this... the beginning of the recording here?<eos> Yeah, What-what do you mean?<eos> This is where you turned on your camera, right here?<eos> My cell phone, yeah.
I'm also afraid I would miss practicing the law.<eos> I was in the midst of the Kendall deposition, and I though, uh, my God, I love this... this is what I do.<eos> So what do you propose?<eos> That I close the case, and, um, that I stay on.<eos> In what position?
I was in the midst of the Kendall deposition, and I though, uh, my God, I love this... this is what I do.<eos> So what do you propose?<eos> That I close the case, and, um, that I stay on.<eos> In what position?<eos> This position.
So what do you propose?<eos> That I close the case, and, um, that I stay on.<eos> In what position?<eos> This position.<eos> My-my current position.
- Yeah.<eos> - Second page. - What's wrong?<eos> Someone here to see you.<eos> - Where?<eos> - In your office.
You can't get better.<eos> Your motion to dismiss is in front of Judge Kevin Drago?<eos> We've won in front of him before.<eos> Our algorithm doesn't like him.<eos> Not for this case.
We were hoping to use it at trial, but... we think we can save the court a lot of time and money if we could ask it now.<eos> - I... am enticed.<eos> - Thank you, Your Honor.<eos> Mr. Gwinn, where did you work before BMI?<eos> Various places.
How does he know that?<eos> Yeah, how?<eos> Ms. Quinn.<eos> He knows because he was here three hours ago when we argued he was a terrorist.<eos> But with what evidence?
- And did I ask you for suggestions on how to address this issue?<eos> Yes, you did.<eos> And you chose not to answer.<eos> I wasn't certain of your motives.<eos> My...
How long was I in your office?<eos> Six minutes, approximately.<eos> And you're saying that I spent the majority of that time talking about my son?<eos> Yes.<eos> Really?
- They are, Your Honor.<eos> They are.<eos> Are you going to England to implant this embryo into Mrs. Haight?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - And why in England?
They are.<eos> Are you going to England to implant this embryo into Mrs. Haight?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - And why in England?<eos> Why not in America?
Diane Lockhart is Caucasian.<eos> It just seems like it would be a public relations disaster to go after an all African-American firm.<eos> Especially to try to curb police brutality suits.<eos> We're not just after them for police brutality.<eos> Okay, what else?
I'm looking for a new place.<eos> Why?<eos> Just for a change.<eos> Change to what?<eos> A new place.
Maybe you're right that no court will allow my suit to go forward, but you could've told me that on the phone.<eos> Instead, you came over here.<eos> And you're welcome anytime.<eos> I'll see you in court.<eos> Both courts.
Police brutality is your specialty, and I'm a bona fide victim here!<eos> It's not just the black people who get brutalized.<eos> It's people like me... The misunderstood.<eos> The white billionaire wife-killer, allegedly.<eos> God.
You're up.<eos> Hard to sleep when that demon box keeps screaming at me.<eos> That's called an alarm clock.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Anyway...
Oh, look, it's Mannequin Hair.<eos> Who?<eos> I don't know his name, but he's in the other photo, too.<eos> Is that weird?<eos> What other photo?
But sadly, I don't have the time to give you the most amazing night of your life.<eos> I'm busy dealing with this impenetrable book.<eos> Mr. Morningstar, you're under arrest.<eos> I am now, am I?<eos> - On what charge?
I don't want, nor need, your help with setting up a date. I'm good.<eos> Why not?<eos> You and I are flowing, Chlo.<eos> Same page. Nope.<eos> Different books altogether.
- I'm a homicide cop.<eos> I do not go around checking on worried criminals like a nanny, Charlotte.<eos> - So if we're done here.<eos> - I heard... things.<eos> On a... onon the phone call.
This is ridiculous.<eos> Pajamas?<eos> What if Ella goes to the party?<eos> That sounds like a great idea.<eos> My God.
- a friend...<eos> - Wait.<eos> - You slept with your therapist.<eos> - What?<eos> Oonly in the beginning.
It's never gonna change.<eos> You guys must have competed over everything?<eos> I mean, he would never admit it, right?<eos> But yeah.<eos> Yeah, everything.
Did you even once think of how this affected her?<eos> Of course I did.<eos> Thought about how she might ruin everything by disemboweling my mum or castrating my brother.<eos> I meant her feelings.<eos> - What?
And you think you're it?<eos> Well, you haven't exactly been backing away from me.<eos> I told you... what happened in the bathroom...<eos> I'm not just talking about the damn bathroom.<eos> Then what?
It could be vestibular.<eos> Can you tell us who takes care of you?<eos> Charlotte.<eos> And where do you and Charlotte live?<eos> On a farm.
- Yes.<eos> This entrance way will remain closed.<eos> - East, South.<eos> - Possibly in the South Wing?<eos> Four or five floors up.
We have to prioritize.<eos> Firefighter Carroll here will be directing you to the most urgent areas.<eos> Yeah, and, uh, the woman with her arm in the air over there is Dr. Kepner.<eos> She is setting up a holding area...?<eos> Outside by Parking Lot 1.

That's pulling the covers over your head.<eos> My mom said when things get scary, you don't do that.<eos> You turn on the light so the scary goes away.<eos> Listen, your mom is right.<eos> Usually.
Job was a devout man... so devout that Satan challenged God.<eos> "Job only loves you for selfish reasons," he said.<eos> "If you take him through misery, he'll lose his faith."<eos> God accepted the challenge and took everything away from Job, let him live in despair, in pain.<eos> In hell.

I'm Bryan Hunt.<eos> Who are you?<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> What?<eos> At the hospital.
Hey, you watch this guy, okay?<eos> Why don't you believe in God, Meghan?<eos> God wouldn't let Joe do the things he did.<eos> The things you saw and heard before you began taking your medicine may have seemed very real, but they weren't. They were real.<eos> Only in your mind.
Okay.<eos> Emily Greenstreet, living the loft life, huh?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Wine opener?<eos> One of those drawers.
Emily Greenstreet, living the loft life, huh?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Wine opener?<eos> One of those drawers.<eos> One of the...
Oh, my god!<eos> Where'd you get that?<eos> I need to see it. -Sorry, police evidence.<eos> -Please, can you just show me the liner?<eos> Oh, my god.
The meter is running.<eos> An hour to talk or karaoke with.<eos> What we need is information on who might be involved in a turf war over club drugs.<eos> A party promoter was shot down yesterday.<eos> Near Seventh Street?
- I'm not afraid of the future.<eos> Whatever is supposed to happen, it's bigger than just me.<eos> - I know this is cheesy, but, um...<eos> Once you see earth from outer space, you realize how small we all are.<eos> - In a good way?
- I know this is cheesy, but, um...<eos> Once you see earth from outer space, you realize how small we all are.<eos> - In a good way?<eos> - yeah.<eos> In a good way.
'Cause, you know, I'm... I'm off duty now.<eos> You're not a janitor.<eos> Yeah, I am, man.<eos> It says so on my name...<eos> On my name tag.
"Cal"... "Caliber"...<eos> "Kalablow"... "Kalabalos"...<eos> Something like that.<eos> Do you remember what language it was in?<eos> Aramaic.
The so-called Expedition International Indian Ocean 2.<eos> For about 5 years... and under the auspices of the Unesco Oceanographic Commission... This expedition has brought together fleets and oceanographic equipment...<eos> The private sector has also supported this effort... providing your technology tip and experience... in seismic data collection depth.<eos> ... collected in the only subduction zone of the Indian Ocean,<eos> Sunda's grave.
And did you know?<eos> Later, too late.<eos> What if I had known before?<eos> Would have prevented, or collaborated, or denounced or negotiated.<eos> - In all cases...
No psychological problem.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Package delivered.<eos> I have to go.<eos> - A gift.
I'm going to introduce you to Claudine.<eos> You will explain the mission in detail.<eos> - Hello. - Hello.<eos> - Have you explained something to him?<eos> - No, above.
Or its continuation. The Mossad believes that they have never abandoned him.<eos> What is the relation with the seismology of Baku?<eos> There could be a network of seismic monitoring... among the countries of the Caspian Sea.<eos> And from Baku one could have access to the Iranian pickups.<eos> In particular, the nearby to nuclear power plants.
- Héléna Chohraganli, for example.<eos> - Exactly.<eos> It is the seismic monitoring network of the countries of the Caspian Sea.<eos> It is closed because is connected... to pickups... located in sensitive areas.<eos> Iranian nuclear power plants, for example.
If not, it's over.<eos> - Marina?<eos> - Where are you?<eos> - And you?<eos> - In my room.
I don't want to talk about it.<eos> Yeah, that's gonna be a problem, 'cause I do.<eos> I have these friends...<eos> The Durells, identical twins.<eos> One day in the schoolyard,
- We already have a deal.<eos> - That one's null and void.<eos> It was contingent upon your client telling us the truth.<eos> We have reason to believe he's lying through his teeth.<eos> - About what?
It's the shock.<eos> It does funny things to you.<eos> Er... I hope it was worth all the trouble.<eos> The American version had such lovely illustrations.<eos> Oh, my.
I put most of it in the safe out the back.<eos> - And there were two of them?<eos> You're sure?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> In all their clobber.
Alice Dunn, Frank Camber, I'm arresting you on suspicion of murder and armed robbery.<eos> Frank!<eos> There's nowhere to run, Frank.<eos> Where were you the night Walter was murdered?<eos> Church.
There's nowhere to run, Frank.<eos> Where were you the night Walter was murdered?<eos> Church.<eos> Where were you Thursday morning, ten o'clock?<eos> - Church.
Margaret thought she was pregnant.<eos> She isn't, but...<eos> Bloody hell, Geordie.<eos> The more I think about it... if it had happened, if she had been...<eos> In another life, maybe.
Shall we get started?<eos> Great.<eos> So, what do you want to do with me?<eos> Are you okay?<eos> Ah. Okay.
Uh-oh, you're book-dusting.<eos> What's wrong?<eos> Dani and I had a fight.<eos> After everything I've done for her, she doesn't want me at our TV appearance.<eos> Your TV appearance?
What's wrong?<eos> Dani and I had a fight.<eos> After everything I've done for her, she doesn't want me at our TV appearance.<eos> Your TV appearance?<eos> Her TV appearance.
They know how to torture me, don't they?<eos> Carly.<eos> You're alive!<eos> Where have they been keeping you?<eos> In a room by myself.
Glen Weller.<eos> Two points.<eos> We need one more.<eos> And after Badenweiler, where did you go.<eos> To Oslo.
Yeah, but I'm better with you.<eos> Clock's ticking.<eos> 20 minutes in Munich, and you've already got Owen a fake ID.<eos> You're just full of colorful friends.<eos> Mm-hmm, in places high and low.
No, that's just my game show.<eos> Though I did have sex with that lizard woman on the left.<eos> But, serious, you guys, I just wanted to say thank you so, so much.<eos> It's like you have my future in your hands.<eos> Your greasy, greasy, hands.
! Well, I had to see what the opera was all about.<eos> Can't let you two have all the fun.<eos> And to class up the night, I brought this.<eos> Chips.<eos> In a tube.
Going to space is exactly like camping.<eos> - Is it?<eos> - Uh, well. No.<eos> Ok.<eos> - In a way, yes.
Gyro stabiliser, magnetic boots, and gloves, onboard computer.<eos> It could run, jump, and update his Facebook.<eos> Death, where is thy sting?<eos> So...<eos> Back to the TARDIS?
But your card is not welcome.<eos> What?<eos> It is reject. Bad.<eos> Do you have perhaps other card?<eos> No, not on me.
I thought Jamie and I were in love.<eos> I thought I was the only one.<eos> To have an affair... This isn't something I do.<eos> My husband travels for months at a time on a fishing boat.<eos> On a fishing boat?
I don't mean it to be.<eos> I just want to help you, David.<eos> Which bin is it in?<eos> Well, that was barely a minute.<eos> - Which bin? !
- Thanks again.<eos> - No, thank you.<eos> And you know where we are now so...<eos> That's right, and autumn has a silent "n" at the end like column or hymn.<eos> Who?
And you know where we are now so...<eos> That's right, and autumn has a silent "n" at the end like column or hymn.<eos> Who?<eos> No, like a hymn that you sing in church.<eos> Like a funeral?
Unless prison has changed him for the worst.<eos> He kept looking at the clock.<eos> You're going to follow him?<eos> I'm just going for a nice bike ride.<eos> In his direction?
But you're coming awfully close.<eos> Did you notice a stranger at your luncheon?<eos> Stranger?<eos> A man with a scar.<eos> Perhaps a Panama hat.
Try not to get any soot in your eyes.<eos> There's something up there!<eos> What?<eos> Interesting.<eos> In what sense?
What did it say?<eos> I don't know what it means.<eos> Do you know a man called John Hammond?<eos> He worked with my father.<eos> Last year, in the East African Postal Service.
Or did you wait until later, when you went to visit him?<eos> Why did you take your gun with you?<eos> N-no...<eos> The police found it.<eos> At the inn.
Or any packaging.<eos> It's just a cat.<eos> Sweet Jesus, what on Earth are you doing?<eos> Antique hunting.<eos> In a dustbin?
Hello, Evie.<eos> Hello, Father Brown.<eos> Wherever have you two been?<eos> Penelope, you need to make enquiries about that man immediately!<eos> What man?
Penelope, you need to make enquiries about that man immediately!<eos> What man?<eos> He has been swindling people right, left and centre.<eos> Am I right in thinking you're referring to our esteemed antiques expert, Wynford Collins?<eos> Yes, your guest!
Sell them through a provincial dealer 'back here to avoid attention.'<eos> As agreed, Mr Kemp returns to England, and after hearing about thefts at the inn, you left your gun there for him to protect himself.<eos> But then something went wrong.<eos> He saw Wynford.<eos> At the inn.
And where is that daughter of yours?<eos> I'm not sure.<eos> Well, when did you last see her?<eos> Last night.<eos> In the woods.
Sometimes I'd tag along.<eos> But then mother got sick, and Mr Bayley dismissed her without a second thought.<eos> Oh, thank you.<eos> Did you hear about the symbol in the field?<eos> What symbol?
My bike's just outside.<eos> And what about me?<eos> No!<eos> No, no, no!<eos> Absolutely not!
Luella says he's a vicar.<eos> Probably never got his hands dirty in his life.<eos> I don't care who he is, son.<eos> He's got muscles, hasn't he?<eos> Plenty of them.
This is my fault, isn't it?<eos> I didn't take care of them.<eos> No one did.<eos> Who was taking care of them?<eos> - The boys.
Guv.<eos> Is this yours, Mr Davies?<eos> So you care very much for Archie and Jacob.<eos> I care for all my pupils.<eos> But the Reillys especially?
Pasha was little, hard to push ball, So I stand behind him and help give ball push.<eos> One time he go down... down Lane with ball.<eos> You remember?<eos> Another time, ball don't move.<eos> Very popular in Russia.
He's always picking at his food, while his mother is telling him what to eat, Like a baby.<eos> Back home, I ate garbage off the street most days.<eos> Other days, I never ate at all.<eos> My father died when I was six.<eos> In the war?
They just contracted us to breed Sitodiplosis Mosellana for them.<eos> How many pests have been delivered so far?<eos> We don't send the bugs.<eos> We... we send eggs.<eos> How many eggs?
Why?<eos> Do you know where they keep their tongues?<eos> No.<eos> Where?<eos> - Their head?
We... we've been out all day.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Another time?<eos> We'll hold you to that.<eos> Uh, next weekend?
How did he get here?<eos> I'm sure it wasn't a walk in the park.<eos> He's unstable.<eos> Are we talking about Mischa or Philip?<eos> The boy.
I told Tuan, um...<eos> Yeah, I got to get there.<eos> Pasha says his mother got the job.<eos> When does she start?<eos> Next week.
You don't need me anymore.<eos> You have each other.<eos> But, Philip, as long as you're here, the centre is going to continue to be concerned about you.<eos> Once they start worrying about somebody, they never stop.<eos> And now, the lab.
Hey.<eos> How was your appointment?<eos> He's, uh, got file cabinets in his office with basic locks.<eos> What'd you talk about?<eos> Mm. This and that.
You don't want to appear nervous.<eos> Okay.<eos> Where do you usually eat?<eos> I like pizza.<eos> At Armand's.
Yeah.<eos> Can you repeat what you'll tell anyone who asks where you were?<eos> I went to lunch.<eos> I got my pizza.<eos> At Armand's.
Let's go for a walk.<eos> - It's freezing out.<eos> - I know.<eos> So, what is it?<eos> Matthew?
What's wrong with that?<eos> You have no bedside manner, Mom.<eos> Oh. That's true.<eos> But... I'd do it somewhere they really needed my help.<eos> In the third world somewhere.
No.<eos> It was easy.<eos> I took the elevator from my apartment.<eos> And nobody in elevator.<eos> Nobody in hallway.
I was thinking about George Washington, but...<eos> Well, I'm sure you'll have lots of choices.<eos> So, listen, I need to tell you something.<eos> I have been offered a job with the World Council of Churches in Buenos Aires, running their interfaith mission.<eos> Buenos Aires?
That's... that's what he said.<eos> How... exactly did you get him this job?<eos> The Soviet Union has worked hard for peace.<eos> It has a lot of friends in a lot of organizations all around the world.<eos> Religious organizations?
Honestly, we're worried about her.<eos> If she's already blown, and they're using her... - My god... - Slow down.<eos> Take a breath.<eos> We don't know anything.<eos> Just like every other operation.
It's gonna work.<eos> I worked with him on the note that he's leaving.<eos> It says it's all because he hates his life here and they forced him to live in the United States.<eos> They find him, they find the note, they'll take him back.<eos> Either way...
All of it.<eos> This isn't about money.<eos> What do you want?<eos> The truth.<eos> About what?
They made me dig a hole...<eos> I used a shovel, a pail, then my hands... We threw them in like garbage.<eos> I was sixteen.<eos> I didn't know anything about world.<eos> About anything.
"The A-Team."<eos> Season one, episode 13,<eos> "The Beast from a Belly of a Boeing" airing live.<eos> You know, we're kind of like the A-Team.<eos> Through time.
I... I just got home and saw the light on.<eos> What's going on?<eos> Are you okay?<eos> - I think Naomi's lying.<eos> - About what?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.<eos> Good.<eos> Yes, you are all here.<eos> Um, I think it's probably time we all had a chat.<eos> About what?
Peter Gregory's mother's garage.<eos> That was Peter's workstation. This was mine.<eos> Things sure have changed. But in a way, they've stayed exactly the same.<eos> As we forge our new path together, we must remain focused on what's really important...<eos> Not material success or wealth, but this, the spirit of innovation...
Really? This time of year?<eos> Uh, hey, um, look, w... what are doing?<eos> Oh, just... just hanging, man.<eos> Why?<eos> You paranoid? Paranoid?
Hello, Gavin.<eos> Richard, I read your little article.<eos> What you said means a great deal.<eos> I'm sure if the situation was reversed, you'd do the same for me.<eos> Absolutely not.
The most transformative technology event in the world. Hoolicon.<eos> See you all at Hoolicon!<eos> I hope you're excited.<eos> I know "vee are."<eos> Yeah, VR.
Yeah. "Okay"? Yeah.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Dan. Danny, Dan-Dan.<eos> It's totally normal.<eos> Totally normal.
- What?<eos> - Oh.<eos> - Holy shit.<eos> Umber?<eos> - In the flesh.
And this guy... will help us keep track of you.<eos> Next.<eos> She's not a doctor.<eos> She's a sadist.<eos> In your dreams.
Don't worry 'bout me.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I completely forgot.<eos> Seriously?<eos> Your own engagement party?
Do you think I'm a criminal?<eos> What you're doing is very illegal.<eos> What's illegal?<eos> Talking to people about options?<eos> About Switzerland?
What you're doing is very illegal.<eos> What's illegal?<eos> Talking to people about options?<eos> About Switzerland?<eos> About death?
Oh, that's, erm... Oh, I can't work it out.<eos> Oh, with all this excitement, I've just got to pee.<eos> They've been on two dates now!<eos> What, to the theatre?<eos> No, to a hotel.
Uh, I'm really flattered.<eos> You know, I was just doing the gig, hosting the show.<eos> Not to me, man. Not to me.<eos> What's the craziest thing you've ever done?<eos> Ever?
Since I still can't cast, I thought you could help me out with a little locator spell?<eos> My King.<eos> Hi, Fen.<eos> Are you all right?<eos> Yes, fine.
Your husband is about to welcome another husband into his bed.<eos> You're a king.<eos> Of course you will.<eos> I gather a three-person marriage isn't normal on Earth?<eos> Not outside of Utah.
Aww! That's so sweet!<eos> I bet he stole it from somewhere really nice.<eos> - What?<eos> - You're dating a henchman.<eos> A henchman?
Our old friend the three of diamonds.<eos> Damn!<eos> How he be doing that?<eos> - Hey!<eos> - Hey.
Great.<eos> Great, man.<eos> Work's been good, yeah.<eos> I just booked a weekly job at a casino.<eos> Ooh, on the Strip?
- I know that's right. - Mm-hmm.<eos> You're both gonna be disenfranchised.<eos> - Ma.<eos> - I'm coming.<eos> Like a McDonald's?
Okay, then let's do tapas.<eos> - Tapas night!<eos> - Tapas night!<eos> - Hello.<eos> - Hi.
"Due to blizzard conditions, all MTA bus and subway service is suspended, and all non-emergency vehicles must be off roads until further notice."<eos> How can I get home now?<eos> I don't know.<eos> It's too far just to walk.<eos> And with this weather...
Okay.<eos> Buonanotte. Buonanotte.<eos> Oh, my God, she slept over?<eos> Yes!<eos> In my bed!
You have your fun with me, and you're done, and you just toss me aside.<eos> Okay, great, so if this is what you think,<eos> I just can... just have to leave because... Am I wrong?<eos> Yes, you are wrong, obviously.<eos> - How?
Plus, I got my face on a bench.<eos> What has two thumbs and is back on the EPPD?<eos> I am!<eos> Reinstated, on probation.<eos> Like middle school all over again.
He told her to go to Paris.<eos> But you can't tell them that we sent you.<eos> I used to be in control but I am losing everything, my confidence, my role in court... my place in the King's heart.<eos> He even stopped writing to me.<eos> And his bed?
Well, there's nothing for them to look away from.<eos> Copy that, Blondie-blonde.<eos> Get your house in order, man.<eos> Or what, you gonna go to the CO?<eos> With what?
I am grateful for your concern, Mother.<eos> But there is no need to pray for me.<eos> If we do not pray for your soul, daughter, then you will be damned for all eternity.<eos> If I am to hell, at least I will enjoy the company of my degenerate monarch.<eos> Judith!
Thank you, grandfather.<eos> I love you.<eos> And I you.<eos> Now, you take care of your brother for he is special too.<eos> And your mother.
Was what me?<eos> How did you do it?<eos> Did you slip poison into her wine?<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> My wife!
It messes with my head.<eos> Just a little longer, Terra.<eos> With the money from blood we'll form our own league of assassins.<eos> You and I.<eos> Together in every way.
Have you?<eos> How am I feeling right now?<eos> What the...<eos> How should I know?<eos> Excited?
No, no, no, I need to be included so badly.<eos> I'll do whatever you say.<eos> I literally have zero pride.<eos> And that's what I like to hear.<eos> Oh, Charles.
I'll make the introductions.<eos> Wait, we can't just be Europeans.<eos> - What country are we from?<eos> - What languages do you speak?<eos> French, Spanish, some Portuguese.
- Where is this guy now? - We have a BOLO out on his car, and we're tracking his credit cards.<eos> - My God! - What?<eos> We just got a hit on facial recognition for him.<eos> Where?<eos> Here, in this building.
You think I'm a control freak?<eos> Shepherd may have once had a say in your future, but, Kurt, don't let her drive you mad today by second-guessing your leadership over this office.<eos> If someone else was sitting in that chair, they might have seen Agent Boyd's program sooner.<eos> I've just been so focused on Sandstorm.<eos> And personal complications?
And...<eos> I found... this skullcap in his pocket.<eos> Was he killed in the car?<eos> Well, there are no arterial blood stains, no brain matter spoiling the interior, so, no.<eos> In the garage?
And my brother...<eos> My brother has lost our family's money.<eos> It cripples him more than the loss of his eye.<eos> How did he lose his eye?<eos> In a flying accident.
There was someone else out on the field.<eos> Who?<eos> I didn't see his face.<eos> I heard the shots and then I heard footsteps running.<eos> - In which direction?
- I'm sorry, do I know you?<eos> - Raymond Holt.<eos> - Captain of the nine-nine. - What are you doing here?<eos> - Oh, I'm on vacation.<eos> You? - Vacation.
- Raymond Holt.<eos> - Captain of the nine-nine. - What are you doing here?<eos> - Oh, I'm on vacation.<eos> You? - Vacation.<eos> - Vacation. - Vacation.
Uh, dark hair, brown eyes... she could be with a tall man.<eos> - A funny accent. - No, I'm sorry. I haven't seen her.<eos> You sure?<eos> She could be in trouble.<eos> What kind of trouble?
Although I do have this.<eos> Happy to share.<eos> Cracker Jacks.<eos> Used to love these as a kid.<eos> A kid?
The Neonatal specialist is on her way in.<eos> - Neo?<eos> - That's not what you're thinking.<eos> What are you thinking?<eos> - Nothing. Nobodies.
In times of unusual danger, that status is made official.<eos> Turmezistan, near the border.<eos> This is a disputed area - potential hot spot.<eos> The Chinese have troops here, the Russians here, the Americans here.<eos> And in the centre...
We're live right now.<eos> You can't just...<eos> We need to talk.<eos> Is that Olivia Moore?<eos> In a wig?
- Let's not.<eos> Every local station has picked up the story.<eos> Well, at least it's not just us with our wangs hanging out.<eos> We're seeing tweets that people were crushed trying to get out of the vaccination queue<eos> - at the 45th Street fire station.
- What's happened?<eos> - Well, you...<eos> You know the Vatican?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - The one in Rome?
- Well, you...<eos> You know the Vatican?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - The one in Rome?<eos> - In Italy?
No.<eos> There weren't.<eos> The TARDIS registered multiple life forms below the surface, so this seems like the best place to look.<eos> Maybe someone's been messing around with time.<eos> Like in The Terminator.
There weren't.<eos> The TARDIS registered multiple life forms below the surface, so this seems like the best place to look.<eos> Maybe someone's been messing around with time.<eos> Like in The Terminator.<eos> The Terminator?
In a sort of coma.<eos> Half dead.<eos> Why do you call him that?<eos> Man Friday?<eos> As in Robinson Crusoe?
Sir.<eos> Blimey, Sarge.<eos> This is a queer 'un, ain't it?<eos> Something to tell your kids. I mean...<eos> Martians...?
You've got lots of friends.<eos> Better ones.<eos> What's so special about her?<eos> - She's different.<eos> - Different how?
Will help with the horror to come.<eos> What horror?<eos> Mainly the tea.<eos> Where am I?<eos> Hospital.
Bottom much faster.<eos> Very fast bottom.<eos> Yeah, I don't understand.<eos> So you don't know?<eos> About what?
You're welcome.<eos> - Bye.<eos> - Toodle-oo.<eos> What was that?<eos> In the mirror?
Voga!<eos> Canary Wharf!<eos> Planet 14!<eos> Every single time, you lose!<eos> Even on the Moon!
Nice work, doctor shockterbooty.<eos> We're gonna need that phone.<eos> Is that really necessary?<eos> - I'm here of my own volition.<eos> - Volition?
Who's the evil triplet?<eos> - Louie. - Eh.<eos> Tell me everything!<eos> Um, we live with our uncle?<eos> On a boat?
Uh, yeah, you must not be in imminent danger if you're napping, wherever you are.<eos> Kidnapped, along with the entire castle.<eos> Yeah, I know, there's a crater.<eos> - Where are you?<eos> - Loria.
You know, we've got our eyes on all those Chaos Killer zombies.<eos> They've got security details, and those security details all end up at the same underground bar.<eos> That's where we found this one.<eos> Alone, wandering around.<eos> Pretty out of it.
His floor rug is missing.<eos> - It was here last night.<eos> - Okay, that's helpful.<eos> Now when was the last time that you saw Theo?<eos> About 2:00 or 2:30.
- I do. Great. Let's go.<eos> _ Hey, Gloria, it's Detective Carisi.<eos> Gloria, we need to talk to you now.<eos> Get the bathroom.<eos> Bathroom clear.
A license plate reader on a tow truck just tagged the car.<eos> It's a breakdown.<eos> - Where?<eos> - A gas station off I-95.<eos> 15 miles from here.
I'm afraid that's not possible.<eos> Right.<eos> I'm not Theo's parent.<eos> Not in the eyes of the law.<eos> Not yet, anyway.
It was the Stan Kendricks case.<eos> Zoe was the victim.<eos> But to answer your question, the entire system is rigged.<eos> Where were you last Friday?<eos> In St. Louis at a conference.
Everything all right over here?<eos> We're looking for the gentleman - that was here.<eos> - The apple juice guy?<eos> He had me bring, like, four rounds of apple juice.<eos> On the rocks.
I'm doing this while training to be a plumber."<eos> "I want to get out!" Just get out.<eos> - Shall we get on with the show?<eos> - Good idea.<eos> Because in our car show this week...
Oh, bollocks.<eos> Does BMW know we're using their car?<eos> - I don't think so.<eos> - OK.<eos> Eventually, though...
So I don't get awarded points for how quickly I do the whole thing?<eos> No, that doesn't come into it.<eos> It's all about angle, line, and how much you excite everybody.<eos> It's judged showing off, isn't it?<eos> - Basically, yeah.
Yesterday, no more than a word or two.<eos> Didn't she go to see you on Thursday, to interview you?<eos> She did and we spoke a little more then.<eos> What did she want to talk about?<eos> Oh, my writing.
And threatened to ruin it all.<eos> Esther came to see me here, yes, as I already told you.<eos> A strange girl.<eos> What did she want to talk about?<eos> Oh, my creative methods, my inspirations.
I thought I was a happily married man till four o'clock on Friday.<eos> Turns out I'm not.<eos> Roger, I'm so sorry.<eos> We had tickets for Whitesnake in June.<eos> Royal Albert Hall...
How're you getting on down here?<eos> Oh, er, no sign of the stolen items.<eos> But I did find these knives in one of the drawers, but none of them match the width of the one used to kill Mr Taylor.<eos> You check the dishwasher?<eos> - Dishwasher?
- Uh, what?<eos> Hey!<eos> - You will never Riverdance!<eos> - Let me go!<eos> - Not on this stage!
But I didn't know. That natural resources.<eos> Were employing so many women.<eos> "natural resources"?<eos> You work with obergruppenfuhrer schmidt, don't you?<eos> In the same building, but different departments.
That much drinking.<eos> He's drowning in it.<eos> I've never seen it this bad before.<eos> He should sleep on the couch.<eos> Or in the garage.
He's drowning in it.<eos> I've never seen it this bad before.<eos> He should sleep on the couch.<eos> Or in the garage.<eos> The couch.
I've never seen it this bad before.<eos> He should sleep on the couch.<eos> Or in the garage.<eos> The couch.<eos> Or the driveway.
And you know where you meet girls just like her?<eos> The best, smartest, most interesting women in the world?<eos> - Rio.<eos> - College.<eos> College.
She saw her parents shot, right in front of her, by the Nazis, when she was ten.<eos> Gosh.<eos> That's a terrible thing for a child to see.<eos> But she wasn't who they said in the papers -- and nobody bothered asking about him.<eos> Who?
Gosh.<eos> That's a terrible thing for a child to see.<eos> But she wasn't who they said in the papers -- and nobody bothered asking about him.<eos> Who?<eos> Alistair?
Alistair?<eos> Liked to put out this heroic story about himself, but he wasn't a nice man.<eos> He abused his position.<eos> Did he have enemies?<eos> Down at the plant?
In your earlier statement, you said that you left the house that night.<eos> Where did you go to?<eos> I needed some air.<eos> I checked on Marion and I went out for a walk.<eos> What time?
An hour ago, I couldn't shut you up going on about how we was partners and stuff, and now you won't even grace me with a "No, thank you" when I offer you a sandwich.<eos> So, come on.<eos> What's up?<eos> Catherine told me about your dad.<eos> My dad?
Well... at least now I know.<eos> - Humphrey?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Selwyn's just been telling me about his dancing.<eos> - His dancing?
Is he going to get away with this?<eos> I'm sorry, Mrs Martin, but we can't arrest Mr Browne for murder.<eos> Even though his actions were directly responsible for Jerome sadly taking his own life.<eos> But he will be charged with blackmail, perverting the course of justice.<eos> Manslaughter, maybe.
Because he taught the class.<eos> I'm sure that's just a coincidence!<eos> This slim volume contains all of life's lessons.<eos> You'll find many insights about dealing with a broken heart.<eos> Also the vagina.
What's this?<eos> Coming out of the sky, a man in a golden helmet is lifting the bus to safety.<eos> Hey, now, we all just saw Alex run out of here, and then...<eos> - you don't think...<eos> - About him naked?
I am a grown man.<eos> I'm not taken care of by my "daddy."<eos> Van, your father's helicopter just landed on the roof.<eos> Daddy?<eos> Here in Charm City?
- No.<eos> - And now her car's dirty from the battle.<eos> She's got to get it clean, so it's sexy, sudsy.<eos> - Where is the poncho?<eos> - At the end.
Nobody ghosts Krystal.<eos> It's difficult at first, but you get used to it eventually.<eos> All right, guys.<eos> Just grabbing this document that confirms that Len Sipp sold Blue Zone Cosmetics to a Dyad subsidiary.<eos> Just last week.
Well, they shouldn't.<eos> They sign non-disclosures.<eos> How could you sell to Dyad?<eos> They, like, product test on bunnies.<eos> And humans.
Oh, my God.<eos> She's such a klepto.<eos> Scott thinks it might be experimental.<eos> There should be some left in her floral make-up bag.<eos> Which one?
Bye.<eos> You know, you don't have to hide.<eos> It's not like this is a secret.<eos> Oh, dressed like this?<eos> Or in the little dress from last night?
Moving on...<eos> Gentlemen, we're ready for you now.<eos> I could come here today and talk about... federal sentencing disparities between crack and cocaine, which obviously are racially motivated.<eos> I'm sorry, but are you asserting that the crack epidemic is exclusive to the black community?<eos> No, not at all.
We met on a bus.<eos> She was listening to music.<eos> And I asked her to go to this church I used to go to.<eos> - Where was that?<eos> - Maryland.
What are you talking about?<eos> Someone in your administration was willing to pay a great deal of money for his safe return.<eos> Your Aidan Macallan.<eos> He's here.<eos> In the Kremlin.
First time you've been invited, I understand.<eos> I'm almost sure there's an insult in there somewhere, General.<eos> You know, Ted and I just had the most remarkable piece of red meat at a steak house out in Canton.<eos> I can't remember, do you like prime rib?<eos> - In the right company.
President Underwood? I'm sorry, ma'am, but you're needed in the Situation Room.<eos> Cathy.<eos> I wanted a moment with you before we join the rest of the team.<eos> - Oh, I was briefed on the way over.<eos> - Not fully.
I'll need to run this by my State Councilor for Foreign Affairs.<eos> I think this is a very good day for both of our countries.<eos> Yes, it is.<eos> There's an American on the boat.<eos> The Russian research vessel.
I mean, if we do this correctly, we can begin the process of dismantling ICO's network.<eos> Take him out.<eos> If the president agrees, I think it's the best thing for the country.<eos> Well, I think it would send a very clear message to ICO.<eos> -In the short term, yes, but--
I collected everything I could find about the day Doug Stamper was carjacked.<eos> Good.<eos> All right, so... where was that?<eos> Where that happened? In Maryland.<eos> Right around, um...
-Was that all?<eos> -Yes, thank you.<eos> Oh, sorry, one more thing.<eos> When did Braegher get his fourth star?<eos> Which administration?
-Yes, thank you.<eos> Oh, sorry, one more thing.<eos> When did Braegher get his fourth star?<eos> Which administration?<eos> A couple back.
Now come on.<eos> If I told you that, how can I possibly keep helping you?<eos> And don't you want me to help you?<eos> But where do we meet?<eos> - In the muck.
You tell me.<eos> No, no, no. It's not going to work like that.<eos> - You tell me what you can do for me.<eos> - I've been around your kind.<eos> Not usually at this level.
We live in a house, borrowed and temporary.<eos> Something in your eye. A look.<eos> It's changed.<eos> We're the same now, you and I.<eos> - How so?
- It's a standing commission.<eos> - For Muriel Bruce?<eos> He doesn't know who ordered them, only to send the rings - to the old Greenwood estate.<eos> - The Greenwood Estate.<eos> - In Rosedale?
Artemis, take everyone inside.<eos> - Come on ladies, let's get inside.<eos> - Are you certain it's her?<eos> Do you have any idea where Muriel Bruce was going today?<eos> Not specifically.
I happen to have a soap recipe, - that's excellent for the complexion. - Oh, wonderful!<eos> - I'd like to be the first to try it.<eos> - Where are the supplies?<eos> - I'd like to make a test batch first.<eos> - In the cellar.
I also hear that you are modest to a fault.<eos> The gossips have been out in force.<eos> Everyone has been very positive.<eos> Well... mostly positive.<eos> 'Mostly positive'.
I do!<eos> Not hard enough.<eos> Spoke to her boss.<eos> Oh, Miss Stone's doing a stand-up job under difficult circumstances, apparently.<eos> Difficult circumstances?
I can't think of a single reason why anyone, let alone us, would want to kill him.<eos> Yes.<eos> Just one last question.<eos> We found, er... this on the boat.<eos> Below deck.
- 52 years of age. Head of Acquisitions.<eos> Been at City Met for 25 years.<eos> Single.<eos> No kids.<eos> - Married to the job.
There seems to be a curse keeping me from finding my way back home, unless you have some magic that can lift it.<eos> I don't.<eos> But Pan might.<eos> Where might that demon have kept this magic?<eos> In his old camp.
When you're ready to come home,<eos> I'll be here, Lucy... with open arms.<eos> Two lefts from headquarters, 30 minutes on the freeway, and four gravel roundabouts.<eos> That should put us somewhere in the...<eos> National Park.
- You may not know this, but I fought in the Great War.<eos> - You were an ambulance driver.<eos> - I took shrapnel.<eos> You have had too much to drink.<eos> No, absolutely not.
It could embarrass the executive branch and have repercussions on our foreign policy.<eos> So, let me propose a simple remedy:<eos> Mr. Stone, hand over the video, destroy all copies, and keep your mouth shut.<eos> But this video is a critical piece of evidence<eos> - in a homicide case.
So, let me propose a simple remedy:<eos> Mr. Stone, hand over the video, destroy all copies, and keep your mouth shut.<eos> But this video is a critical piece of evidence<eos> - in a homicide case.<eos> - How so?
The gunshot residue results are in.<eos> There was no gunshot residue found anywhere on Frank Henderson's hand.<eos> That's not surprising as we don't believe he killed himself.<eos> There was no gunshot residue on Steve Thomas's hands, either.<eos> Or on his shirt or his jacket or anywhere on his clothes, in fact.
Well, I have to say, a change of scenery is very nice indeed.<eos> - There you are.<eos> - Ah, cheers.<eos> Oh, there's a pet lizard we should tell you about.<eos> - A lizard?
I could say the same thing.<eos> I'm Anson Gephardt.<eos> I work for the Defense Intelligence Agency.<eos> I'm here to place you under arrest.<eos> On what grounds?
Just- - Just keep your eyes open.<eos> Hey.<eos> Did you talk to Richard Game?<eos> No, but I think I was wrong.<eos> - About what?
248 Garfield. 3:20 PM.<eos> It says, "Come alone and wear a yellow hat."<eos> We need to get an agent to that pickup point to get into Black Mass to ID The Architect.<eos> Yeah, but whoever we send in would have to really know their stuff.<eos> Not just the programming, but the buzzwords, the culture.
- No, Hazmat's already transported her.<eos> - What are you talking about?<eos> - The Hazmat team.<eos> The Hazmat team is already en route.<eos> Oh, my God.
- She clipped my fingernails.<eos> - Your fingernails?<eos> - Yes, and... she took some blood, and she talked a bit.<eos> - What did she talk about?<eos> - Science stuff.
We can't predict all outcomes, can we?<eos> For instance, how old is Leekie?<eos> Could you have predicted that he would wind up buried underneath some random crone's garage?<eos> I must remember that you know most things.<eos> Most.
Uh, which isn't unusual for us.<eos> They're...<eos> They're, uh...<eos> Professors and they live on a houseboat, so they're pretty remote.<eos> Anyway, but...
Yeah.<eos> That's the plan.<eos> But we still don't know how many there are.<eos> Well, that's what we're gonna find out.<eos> - Right, Scotty?
- work in the new space?<eos> - Big time.<eos> - Where's Delphine?<eos> - She left.<eos> And in a hurry.
Hey.<eos> Hello!<eos> And I'd also like to thank you all for buying.<eos> - Woohoo! - And now is the part of the night where I'd like to introduce my muse in her true form.<eos> - Oh, Christ!
I'll take a mercy tap, thanks.<eos> Really?<eos> I have to admit I'm a little disappointed in you.<eos> Would you pass me that photograph at least?<eos> Not on your life.
Like I said, he's from the old neighborhood.<eos> Well, he's also the subject of an NYPD investigation.<eos> For what?<eos> Do you know where your he works?<eos> Yeah, the phone company.
Please.<eos> Okay, I want complete honesty, full disclosure, no holds barred.<eos> Agreed?<eos> First, about?<eos> My son.
That's right.<eos> How you think he is perceived out there, what the other cops and bosses think of him?<eos> You actually want us to talk about one of your kids?<eos> He's hardly a kid.<eos> Son, then.
Well, you can check my credit card bill if you'd like to.<eos> Why don't you do that?<eos> Hey.<eos> You want to tell me what's going on?<eos> With?
Do you think that's why O.G. was attacked?<eos> Excuse me, would you?<eos> Hey, where are you?<eos> Where are you?<eos> The precinct.
Significant percentage of the money athletes make is from sponsorship deals.<eos> How do we get ahold of someone from AmpVX?<eos> There won't be anyone in the New York office until tomorrow.<eos> But?<eos> In Beijing...
- Awesome.<eos> - One question.<eos> Do you still know how to ride?<eos> - Come on, riding a bike, it's like riding a bike.<eos> Wheelie.
Do you still know how to ride?<eos> - Come on, riding a bike, it's like riding a bike.<eos> Wheelie.<eos> No.<eos> Wheelie.
No... yeah, no.<eos> I'm... I'm fine.<eos> Yeah, sorry, I...<eos> I think the location of Gawain and, you know, the Blood of Christ is in the, um...<eos> Galapagos Islands.
Yeah, Rip took Gideon offline.<eos> Said something about an efficiency scan, which should've been done by now.<eos> - How strange.<eos> - Yeah, like how Nate was acting<eos> - in the library.
What's a goonie?<eos> All right, Malcolm is back in 2016, where he belongs.<eos> - In prison?<eos> - No.<eos> His crappy apartment.
Look, I got your text last night, but I didn't see it till this morning.<eos> Oh, it's nothing.<eos> Look, I know it wasn't a booty call, so what did you want to talk about?<eos> - I got a job offer.<eos> - In the CFD?
- His name?<eos> - Corey Kipton.<eos> He teaches yoga until the real estate thing kicks in full-time.<eos> So where were you this morning?<eos> On this new job.
I read too many thrillers.<eos> This is the most excitement I've had all year.<eos> Mrs. Framingham, we found the watch on a body earlier this morning.<eos> The man died in a house fire.<eos> In New York?
The man died in a house fire.<eos> In New York?<eos> My husband's travelling there on business.<eos> Is... is that where this happened?<eos> The south side of Chicago.
Perfect.<eos> How long have you been seeing Bill?<eos> Six months.<eos> He tell you what he did for a living?<eos> Finance.
Try the bat.<eos> Wait. Hold on.<eos> Hold on. The meeting was two years ago, okay?<eos> - Two years ago.<eos> D.C.
I'm sorry, Al. I love you. But someone has to stop you before you hurt more folks.<eos> You got some balls walking in here out of the blue like this.<eos> Dad died 11 years ago.<eos> Our brother... remember him?<eos> Back in '24.
Or we could, of course, just wait and hope for the best.<eos> - How bad is it?<eos> - Bullet's still in there.<eos> We got to get him to a hospital.<eos> In the '30s?
Perry Needs-to-get-an-actual- personality Crofte?<eos> Like you never snuck into the locker room<eos> - to sniff his jock strap.<eos> - Never into jocks.<eos> Now straps...
I hope that's not true.<eos> - Bye!<eos> - Bye.<eos> Yep.<eos> Totally in sync.
Why is everybody so obsessed with my fun levels?<eos> Because if something does come out of that seal, I want you at Peak Wynonna:<eos> Whisky, soaked and reckless.<eos> He's here.<eos> On the homestead?
Look, baby, I'm off in a couple hours.<eos> Can't you... entertain yourself?<eos> Wave!<eos> Not in uniform, Okay?<eos> Not in public.
Well, I mean, we know the Players and the 54th Street G's do have a pretty long history of gang warfare.<eos> How Rebecca Clark got involved, I have no idea, but this could be a retaliation hit, Sarge.<eos> Yeah, well, why don't you start by asking him?<eos> Hey, excuse me, we need to ask you some questions, Jeremy.<eos> About what?
How Rebecca Clark got involved, I have no idea, but this could be a retaliation hit, Sarge.<eos> Yeah, well, why don't you start by asking him?<eos> Hey, excuse me, we need to ask you some questions, Jeremy.<eos> About what?<eos> About her.
My dad spotted a woman, cowering with her baby. Without thinking, he ran forward to save her but he didn't see the landmine.<eos> He sounds like a brave man.<eos> Yeah, he was.<eos> Were you scared?<eos> On the bus?
I don't think so.<eos> Trajectories point to this man.<eos> Flaco Ruiz.<eos> Where's DEA on all this?<eos> Right here.
Well, the deceased, Flaco Ruiz, had come to us with information about the cartel.<eos> Agent Zigman scheduled an appointment with him to discuss terms.<eos> I was supposed to be there and got called away, last minute.<eos> Lucky day.<eos> For some.
So he was a little man?<eos> No, a real weasel.<eos> Okay, what, uh, particular kind of weasel are we talking?<eos> We talking short-tailed, long-tail?<eos> That kind of weasel.
You know, sometimes I wonder how long I'm gonna be able to put up with you, Roger Murtaugh.<eos> For God's sakes, Roger, I need to know the truth about this.<eos> What are you getting all worked up about?<eos> I'm telling you everything I know about the Raines case.<eos> Not Steven.
You've done your homework.<eos> I'm one of the few guys who waits till after college to become a goddamn bookworm.<eos> Come on.<eos> I'm here, so what are you hearing from the worldwide leader?<eos> About what?
Your brother-in-law's in a lot of trouble, my man.<eos> Look, whatever my brother-in-law's problem is, it's his problem, not mine.<eos> Okay?<eos> But for now, you two need to get away from my house and stay the hell away from my family.<eos> No disrespect,
- And?<eos> - Sorry.<eos> All three were minor matters.<eos> One involved foul language.<eos> And the other two?
And that's really all that matters right now.<eos> You understand that the purpose of this hearing is to challenge your department's refusal to release officers' disciplinary records, don't you?<eos> It is my understanding that state law prevents me from releasing them.<eos> Yeah, but you can make an exception, can't you?<eos> In certain cases.
Dayana, if you don't mind,<eos> I would love to have my old roomie back.<eos> By all means.<eos> Upstairs.<eos> Back corner.
You got the job.<eos> Congratulations.<eos> Hey, we're gonna celebrate this weekend.<eos> Actually, how would you like to celebrate tonight?<eos> In Paris.
- You talked to her?<eos> - You care?<eos> Clay, what's going on?<eos> Really, mother?<eos> In front of him?
By pressuring the jury, the judge is able to sway any fence-sitters towards voting guilty.<eos> Exactly the verdict the Collaborators want.<eos> So, you know what you need to do now.<eos> Get to that judge, ASAP.<eos> On it.
That arrangement with the city is ten seconds before the first gunshot until 30 seconds after the last one.<eos> How does the system know to record ten seconds before the gunshots?<eos> Are you saying that this thing is bugging the city 24/7?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Sort of.
You do get that I'm in a gang, right?<eos> Well, that doesn't matter.<eos> Guzman said you were gonna talk to us about it, so talk.<eos> It happened last night after me and Sherlock left the gym.<eos> Just a block from here.
He was a real gentleman.<eos> I liked his company.<eos> You sound like you were close to him.<eos> One of the nurses gave him a morphine overdose.<eos> At the hospital?
What were you doing?<eos> I don't want to talk about this any more.<eos> Found it.<eos> - Go on.<eos> Where? - In the street.
Halley's fine.<eos> You know she's at my parents' house, right?<eos> And she's having the time of her life.<eos> If you ever want to change things up, you're always welcome here.<eos> Just not in our bedroom, you dumbass.
♪ Happy kitty, sleepy kitty ♪<eos> ♪ Purr, purr, purr. ♪ That's nice.<eos> Now in German.<eos> Great.<eos> Now Mandarin.
And then she goes to the bathroom, and I know she is.<eos> Aw, that's so weird.<eos> Amy: I'm sorry, Bert, but aren't you worried she's only with you for your money?<eos> She better be. On our first date, I bought her an 80-inch flat-screen.<eos> Your first date?
He's thin and sexy like a Jewish greyhound.<eos> Yeah, that-that is the sexiest dog.<eos> And I'd like to think Howie wouldn't take a job I was uncomfortable with.<eos> 'Cause he's scared of you?<eos> Terrified.
It's always the person you least expect.<eos> I was just... Trying to get some alone time.<eos> Because I bugged you so much?<eos> No, no.<eos> Well, yes, But no.
Todd, don't panic, okay?<eos> Not to harp on the titanic, But there are solid lessons to be gleaned there.<eos> Now, you remember that string quartet. And how calm they were when the ship was sinking?<eos> Tandy, they sank with the ship and died.<eos> Yes, in the movie.
Ask for some money?<eos> I mean, you must have talked about us.<eos> Me.<eos> Us.<eos> Your son.
- Shh!<eos> Raps, I told you, we can't tell anyone about that night.<eos> Um... I think the secret's pretty much out.<eos> Yeah, yeah, everyone knows the hair's back, but if anyone knew I was the one who snuck you out when it happened, I would be sent to a convent...<eos> Literally, a convent.
This machine can analyze any substance for chemical makeup, bitopic composition, and urgu-structural integrity.<eos> - I built it myself.<eos> - Nice!<eos> If I'm right, this should tell us all there is know<eos> - about your hair.
Rematch?<eos> No.<eos> I have to get back to reading the intel report.<eos> What intel report?<eos> About the cache?
Nice of you to drive all this way, but we're pretty sure this is just a wild goose chase.<eos> We have teams going door-to-door now, testing the water, but I don't expect to find anything.<eos> Right, yeah.<eos> And where have you, uh, looked, exactly?<eos> Almost the entire town.
Someone told me it'd be a nice gesture.<eos> Okay, you're not supposed to say that out loud.<eos> Oh. Right.<eos> So, where's your boyfriend this week?<eos> Europe?
The hell you don't.<eos> The news cycle will take care of this.<eos> It's very efficient.<eos> I'm not talking about that.<eos> Then what?
Look at who you work for!<eos> Our cops can't even take a cup of coffee on the arm.<eos> I'm not a cop.<eos> What's your beloved COMPSTAT built on?<eos> Results.
What's your beloved COMPSTAT built on?<eos> Results.<eos> I show results.<eos> The end justifies the means?<eos> Not in this building.
Yet, here you are testifying on his behalf.<eos> I'm testifying to the facts.<eos> The facts of this confession.<eos> Yes.<eos> A confession, not a conviction?
You're safe.<eos> We'll find out who did this.<eos> Come on.<eos> So you've seen this woman in black before.<eos> At the creepy crawly condo.
Another seal! ?<eos> There's more than one seal?<eos> Okay, if someone moved it, it could still be on another sacred site, right?<eos> How many of those do we have?<eos> In the Triangle? Uh...
Can't shoot to kill?<eos> That's fine.<eos> I have other ways to bring the pain.<eos> I'll cooperate.<eos> On one condition.
This is the only position I feel comfortable in.<eos> Room down there for one more?<eos> You okay?<eos> No.<eos> Furious.
You know what's so strange?<eos> She knows me, but there's nothing that connects us other than our past.<eos> It's like we existed in two separate universes...<eos> Me in my crazy one and she in her...<eos> Normal one?
I just wanted to give you a heads-up that one of our journalists is running a piece on Peggy Deagle, and she says you're old friends and mentioned you quite a bit in the piece...<eos> Peggy has been gunning for me for 10 years.<eos> What does she have now?<eos> Mostly things about your family.<eos> Your childhood.
Where have I been?<eos> More like, where haven't I been?<eos> (chuckles)<eos> You were in prison, weren't you?<eos> Mostly, yes.
You think I would come all the way down...<eos> Uh, see... It w... Okay, I need help with a job.<eos> Eugene:<eos> You want my help with a job?<eos> Well, not a "job," a job.
IT?"<eos> THE OTHER GUY IS LIKE, "WHAT?"<eos> LAST TIME YOU TOOK A DUMP, DID<eos> YOU KNOW THE MOTELS ON THE<eos> INSIDE OF THAT?

There might not be another time, and I don't want to die with you thinking I agree with your dumb idea to leave.<eos> Look, if I can't do the job the way I was doing it before, I shouldn't be doing it at all.<eos> You think you can be a good agent because you feel something?<eos> Understanding, identifying with victims, that's what makes you good at your job.<eos> All yours.
I'm sorry you can't go home.<eos> Shepherd and Roman are still out there.<eos> The National Guard, they have a ten-block perimeter around this building.<eos> - You're safe here.<eos> - Safe.
I've had to pick my battles, and it hasn't always been easy, but now I have my own precinct, a precinct whose officers would never do to you what Officer Maldack did.<eos> I understand what you're saying, but...<eos> Shh. I hear Margo's squeaky shoes in the hallway.<eos> One guess as to where in Arizona she brought them.<eos> Scottsdale.
I wasn't a guy who lived in a neighborhood looking for his daughter's toy.<eos> I was a black man, a dangerous black man.<eos> That's all he could see: a threat.<eos> And I couldn't stop thinking about my daughters.<eos> And their future.
He's a mind freak!<eos> A mind freak!<eos> Okay, update on our trial prep.<eos> This is our lawyer, Samuel Miller, who, in many ways, is in charge of our defense.<eos> In every way.
I'm great.<eos> Well, I hear your mouth say that, but the rest of your head is telling a different story.<eos> Feels like the stress of the upcoming trial is starting to get to you.<eos> Oh, is this about my hair turning white?<eos> Yes, definitely.
Okay, here's how the jury's feeling from left to right, L to R:<eos> not a fan of Jake, not of a fan of Rosa, not a fan of me, bathroom incident...<eos> We get it.<eos> They all hate us.<eos> In toto, yes.
Sorry, Rick.<eos> You know what a skinny post is?<eos> Why the fuck are you throwing it so high, man, and behind me?<eos> Man, we don't even call plays at my school.<eos> What you... you in...
Maybe you're just not emotionally cut out for this, Joe.<eos> Yeah, maybe.<eos> And clearly, you're not either.<eos> I ever tell you the story about my dad?<eos> What, your real dad or your adoptive dad?
Yes.<eos> I may have lost my guidance system and my girlfriend, but I still have a colon full of yesterday's meals to keep me company.<eos> Although, thanks to your high-fiber breakfast,<eos> I'm sure that'll be leaving me, too.<eos> Really?
You gotta remember, this was the '90s and that kind of casual homophobia was commonplace.<eos> Oh, "Best Bod, Daytona Beach 1998?"<eos> What is...<eos> "Coney Island Hot Dog Eating Champion."<eos> - The same year?
Frig-a-dig, how loud were the monsters?<eos> "Monsters"?<eos> The creatures, the puppets?<eos> What you on about?<eos> What monsters?
Kayleigh, you've dialled me by accident!<eos> She can't hear me.<eos> Kayleigh!<eos> What do you work in?<eos> Promotions.
What the...?<eos> 'Are you winding me up?<eos> '<eos> 'I've told you, I'm just having a breather.<eos> 'A breather?
Maybe it's the other side.<eos> Ian and Margaret?<eos> No, they're in Buxton, they're on a retreat.<eos> - I'm drawing the curtains for them.<eos> - No, the spirit world.
- It's shagged.<eos> - Yeah. - Feel that.<eos> Christ! That's hot, in't it?<eos> Hotter than July. She shouldn't be firing up like that.<eos> - No, not at that age.
- Yeah. - Feel that.<eos> Christ! That's hot, in't it?<eos> Hotter than July. She shouldn't be firing up like that.<eos> - No, not at that age.<eos> No way!
Where'd you get your clothes from?<eos> Er, top's from New Look. Jeans are from Dorothy Perkins.<eos> - Smart arse!<eos> Where did you get changed?<eos> - In the toilets.
Ooh-hoo-hoo!<eos> - Oh, Christ, it's Litchy. Quick, get your head down.<eos> - Why?<eos> - Just get your head down. What's he going to think?<eos> - About what?
'Oh, no...'<eos> But Sky's on.<eos> There's quiche in the fridge.<eos> There's a stack of ironing.<eos> 'Oh, honestly.'
I... I mean, uh...<eos> "Lana" is fine.<eos> - I'll say.<eos> - You'll say what?<eos> - Nothing.
- Hey, how's the demotion going?<eos> - Kill me a demon already.<eos> You've been cooking drugs for Dolls?<eos> Suffice it to say, there is an effort afoot which requires a demon's blood in its purest form.<eos> Not in uniform! OK?
I have not come for anything but the...<eos> I'm partial to its homeyness.<eos> Its whimsy.<eos> Always pictured it in a bedroom.<eos> Perhaps a child's room.
Yeah.<eos> Duh! Come on.<eos> Since when do you care about cricket?<eos> But the boss man loves all sports and I want him to love me.<eos> - Professionally.
Faceless.<eos> For fun, for punishment.<eos> For food.<eos> I'm trying not to think about the reasons.<eos> Only the retribution.
We got elk.<eos> We got pronghorn.<eos> We got plenty of loons.<eos> Or I can keep you alive for weeks.<eos> And in the most glorious pain.
When we raise our lord and master, we will sacrifice your pathetic body at the altar of his tomb.<eos> You know, the only altar this boy bows to is the bar stool on hockey Saturday.<eos> Where's yours?<eos> In the house of my enemy.<eos> In a place of worship.
A widow in black that can levitate and steal faces.<eos> Not just one.<eos> You know them?<eos> There was a story my great grandmother used to tell.<eos> Two twisted spider sisters.
To give me sweet advice like that.<eos> Well, that, and to tell the mighty Harvey Specter I took his toilet bowl for a test drive.<eos> Dad...you're not doing that.<eos> You know how to suck the fun out of everything, don'tcha?<eos> Oh, my God.
Morgan....<eos> Who were you talking to in the park today?<eos> There was a woman talking to you.<eos> She was asking me about burglaries.<eos> What about burglaries?
- One of them had the other one locked in a cupboard.<eos> - What?<eos> !<eos> You can't tell anyone this, OK?<eos> - In a cupboard where?
I was just going to order some noodles if you want some.<eos> Nah, I'd better...<eos> Where you going to be at Christmas anyway?<eos> Marianne's got the girls so... home, probably.<eos> - In your flat?
- James thought it would work, too, but... - It was crazy.<eos> Regardless.<eos> You might have died in there, Morgan.<eos> Did James ever talk to you about Paula Denny?<eos> Her brother Callum?
Regardless.<eos> You might have died in there, Morgan.<eos> Did James ever talk to you about Paula Denny?<eos> Her brother Callum?<eos> Her friend...
She was good to me, your wife.<eos> A good doctor.<eos> It's not right what happened.<eos> Where are they holding her?<eos> The cathedral?
We are doing an interview:<eos> "The Redemption of a Fraudulent Lawyer."<eos> I don't want my behavior to drive a wedge between us, which means I accept Alex as name partner.<eos> For what it's worth, Alex is still coming, but not as name partner.<eos> - Really?
- So what are you saying?<eos> - I'm not saying anything.<eos> I'm just saying I think I should sleep at my place tonight.<eos> Donna, I need to talk to you about something.<eos> About what?
Before we go, I want to propose a toast... .. in the presence of these whores, to us.<eos> Because we are great men.<eos> - Yes, we are.<eos> - We are great, and we will transform medicine for the benefit of all mankind forever.<eos> In the future.
It's gotta be hard on both of you.<eos> When did this whole thing happen exactly?<eos> You said five years ago, but when?<eos> We think it was 4th of July weekend.<eos> In 2012?
Hey, you remember this guy from back then...<eos> JD? He drove that black truck, hung out with Jason and those dudes?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, JD's still around.<eos> Yeah, up in Kingston, mostly.
I see one!<eos> Who?<eos> Right there!<eos> Look!<eos> In the window.
I've been thinking.<eos> This job...<eos> What is it?<eos> I mean, this location.<eos> Out in the middle of nowhere.
Right?<eos> Most people take one look at it, walk away forever.<eos> Not Eddie Edwards, so...<eos> Garmisch Seniors Tournament.<eos> Next month.
You're quite a popular guy, Eagle-Man.<eos> Every time you turn on TV you're there.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Maybe perhaps you can tell us, what's the secret?<eos> Clothes.
You will never be Olympic material.<eos> Edwards.<eos> Push!<eos> Up and out.<eos> Up and out.
- Hurry, Samantha!<eos> How many?<eos> This group there's 40.<eos> Got another 20 at kerman's farm.<eos> Only 12 of us at that railhead at paulding.
Serena knight came home to soso in 1865.<eos> Two women...<eos> Living on one farm...<eos> At the same time.<eos> Now, normally in a court of law...
I'm gonna need your whole name.<eos> Ed-Edward James.<eos> Edward James. Edward James. Yes, sir.<eos> And, uh, you know how old you are? No, sir.<eos> No. Thirty?
Couple of days, I think.<eos> You know, it's actually kind of hard to tell with no windows or sunlight or anything.<eos> I mean, how do we get out of here?<eos> Oh, he didn't tell you?<eos> About...
You mean north Korea. Is that the crazy one?<eos> So, yeah, that one.<eos> And, uh, you know, poured all his money into this place. Took to it like his life depended on it.<eos> Which, you know, that stays with you.<eos> So...
I'm sorry.<eos> Yes. What...<eos> What publication?<eos> I'm talking about your book.<eos> Book.
That book you're holding is utter nonsense.<eos> I don't even know how you got that.<eos> I thought I burned both copies.<eos> It's on Amazon.<eos> Both hard copy and e-book.
Burn!<eos> Okay, you know what, I thought we could have an adult conversation, but apparently we can't.<eos> Erin, if you don't believe in this stuff anymore, then why were you looking for the book?<eos> A man came to see me at my work saying his building was haunted.<eos> What building?
-Downtown?<eos> -Yes, yes. In here.<eos> Okay, what was the other address you said?<eos> Polar bear on 63rd and 5th Avenue.<eos> And the one in Chelsea?
I told you what happened.<eos> Where's the car?<eos> -It's on the other side.<eos> -In Jersey?<eos> No, in the portal.
- Is that 144 Wall Street?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Yeah, I have the building right next door.<eos> You "have" the building?<eos> Like, in a Fantasy Building League?
To the wrong stuff.<eos> This is it.<eos> We can't pass "eleven."<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> Our drink number.
It's about me being sick of you just meeting guys and falling into their dick-sand.<eos> Falling into their what?<eos> Their dick-sand.<eos> It's like, every time a guy just looks at you, you just forget who you are, and...<eos> Like... "Oh!"
We go where fate takes us.<eos> Arthur!<eos> This isn't the life we planned.<eos> But it's ours.<eos> And for the first time in my life...
The worst of the worst.<eos> There's rumors, Amanda, that some of them have abilities.<eos> Well, the rumors are right.<eos> You know what the problem with a metahuman is?<eos> The human part.
Fucking Wade Wilson.<eos> Suppose I'd wear a mask, too if I had a face like that.<eos> I only wish I healed the same.<eos> Still, we'll put him out of our misery.<eos> On our terms.
He's tied up in the trunk.<eos> I'm doing as you said, DP.<eos> I plan to gut him like a tandoori fish, then dump his carcass on Gita's doorstep.<eos> I did not tell him to do that.<eos> Absolutely not.
Yep, that was a good one.<eos> Let's dance.<eos> And by dance, I mean... let's try to kill each other.<eos> Fine.<eos> Fists.
I would not have let you do that on a second date.<eos> Why not?<eos> You let me on the first.<eos> And then we'd go on a naughty weekend to the seaside, and I would prove my manliness by winning you a cuddly toy.<eos> At the pier.
And I just pretty much ignore it.<eos> You know, that sounds really unhealthy, Bob.<eos> Hey, I gotta tell you.<eos> You were the only one who helped me out that day.<eos> In the gym?
Sure. Yeah.<eos> Where?<eos> Where do you want me to meet you?<eos> I'm in the stairwell of your building, two flights down.<eos> - Stairwell?
Bottom line, are you in or you out?<eos> What are you-<eos> - In or out of what?<eos> No time for questions, just action.<eos> - In or out?
What if I'd been here or out riding in Virginia somewhere?<eos> Thank god I was with him.<eos> Why, "thank god"?<eos> Do you know what I think of history?<eos> Of history?
He says Johnson wants to talk to the press.<eos> He can do whatever he wants.<eos> We're leaving now.<eos> The casket will be closed, won't it?<eos> At the funeral?
Shh.<eos> I know.<eos> They... they handed me yellow roses.<eos> Yellow roses.<eos> At every stop.
He abolished slavery, ma'am.<eos> That's right.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Bobby, please tell them I want the books on Lincoln.<eos> About his funeral.
My mother lives in London.<eos> Maybe she made it out.<eos> Yeah, maybe.<eos> - Dad, where are you?<eos> - On my boat.
You fucking idiots.<eos> I've been there.<eos> I've seen that shit, and there ain't no way I'm going back.<eos> Wait, you've been to the Great Beyond?<eos> "Great," my asshole!
And you tell yourself the same thing that every cop sitting there tells himself.<eos> "Better him than me."<eos> If you're having a problem with this, Marcus, I'll do it. I don't have a problem taking out a cop.<eos> I'll do a cop just like...<eos> Oh, ho, ho.
So this guy's a Latino, about 30 years old.<eos> Very slight build. Local tattoos, yeah...<eos> Jeff.<eos> Captain, it's Franco. I'm on the 999.<eos> En route now.
- Fifty-fifty.<eos> Still, it's a lot of money.<eos> We brought something too. A file.<eos> - What file?<eos> - Not what file, whose file.
- You're in the money business and you have moral prejudice?<eos> Please, get to the point.<eos> I asked the wrong question.<eos> How much money?<eos> Quite a bit.
- Good evening.<eos> - Good evening.<eos> The conditions of Luis Roldan's surrender.<eos> Summarize.<eos> Two weeks from now. In Laos. Laos?
Oh, yes. Jesus.<eos> Don't forget the stamps.<eos> The next morning, you'll go back and deposit the money in another account.<eos> - Another bank?<eos> - The same one.
Initiating kill line pressure test.<eos> Bladder effect.<eos> That ring true to you?<eos> Well, nothing ever come outta Don Vidrine's mouth ever really rang true to me, but, yeah, I mean...<eos> On its face? Yeah.
Yes, ma'am.<eos> Right now we only have a couple confirmed reports of a fire on an oil rig.<eos> That's about all I can say.<eos> There...<eos> On the Deepwater Horizon?
I don't know him.<eos> You'd freaking love him.<eos> He's adorable.<eos> So are you gonna hook up with him?<eos> No, not like that.
That God is well disposed towards you?<eos> Let me set things straight.<eos> Those who deserve it, go to hell.<eos> I could tell you about hell.<eos> About its flames.
"Violence cleanses evil.<eos> It purifies the heart."<eos> Does your heart need purifying?<eos> Have you had bad thoughts?<eos> About men, perhaps?
It's a recessive gene carried down through families.<eos> Yet, many generations can pass without a peculiar child being born.<eos> And alas, peculiars have been persecuted through the ages.<eos> Hence, we live in places like this.<eos> In Wales?
It was taken.<eos> That thing killed three men before we took it down.<eos> Where?<eos> Two days ride.<eos> North, in the mountains.
Here, in this army, we fight for more than food or money.<eos> We give our lives to something more.<eos> Xin ren is our flag.<eos> Trust in each other.<eos> In all ways, at all times.
He brings us in.<eos> We get us out.<eos> Strategist Wang request your presence.<eos> As you fought, where was this stone?<eos> In my bag.
The Tao Tei overrun the city!<eos> Thousands of soldiers and innocent are dead.<eos> You're too late!<eos> Where is the captured Tao Tei?<eos> - In the dungeon!
Lynch is the one.<eos> Direct descendent of Aguilar.<eos> Everything was clear in there, for the first time.<eos> What do we all dream of?<eos> A more peaceful world.
The only response from the allied Moldovan military contact is shock, confusion.<eos> And there's anger.<eos> There's teenagers spray-painting "genocide aratare" at kill sites.<eos> - Genocide...?<eos> - "Aratare."
Look at these x-rays.<eos> They were scanning people. On a molecular level.<eos> And printing them out of condensate.<eos> It's an assembly line.<eos> Like some kind of... industrial process.
What's the difference between an artery and a vein?<eos> - What are you talking about?<eos> - The boy's accident.<eos> Arteries spurt blood.<eos> And veins?
Bleed.<eos> I think you need to practice your boy/girl dating talk at home before you come out.<eos> Yeah, I probably do.<eos> I'll give you a book if you're that interested.<eos> On dating?
I think you need to practice your boy/girl dating talk at home before you come out.<eos> Yeah, I probably do.<eos> I'll give you a book if you're that interested.<eos> On dating?<eos> On blood.
Do you like it?<eos> I made it myself.<eos> No, not particularly.<eos> But do you ever sell them?<eos> At church fairs now and again.
So, what does that mean, exactly?<eos> Well, we often see this type of repetitive chanting in children who have been exposed to trauma or persons with neurodevelopmental disorders.<eos> Neurodevelopmental disorders?<eos> Fragile-X syndrome, autism.<eos> Okay, so...
God.<eos> That's extraordinary.<eos> No, I'm sure it must've been difficult, but...<eos> I haven't been anywhere.<eos> Well, Cancun.
It was more expensive, but you could wear it to all kinds of future events.<eos> - It was an investment.<eos> - Yes.<eos> Where were you when I was in high school?<eos> Oh, North Carolina, Israel.
No, these are our administrative offices.<eos> Our quants aren't...<eos> Okay, then where is he?<eos> Is he in Mumbai?<eos> Russia?
I'm pretty sure he said his name is Li.<eos> You.<eos> Come here.<eos> Thank you, thank you for taking such good care of my son.<eos> Your son?
Now, what's all this about a Dragon Warrior?<eos> How did you know I was a Dragon Warrior?<eos> Did the universe tell you that, too?<eos> No, the poster did.<eos> And the gift shop.

You guys seem a little young, but okay.<eos> You see, kids, when two fish love each other-- and we'll stop right there.<eos> Climb aboard, explorers.<eos> I feel a migration song coming on.<eos> Oh...

- Huh?<eos> Your tag.<eos> It's missing.<eos> That why you're not in quarantine?<eos> - Quarantine?
It's too hard.<eos> I can't remember.<eos> I'm forgetting everything.<eos> I'm gonna be stuck forever in the pipes.<eos> The pipes!
- We love it.<eos> It's fascinating.<eos> In other cultures, they don't have anything like this.<eos> No, they don't.<eos> In Chinese, for example.
It's our annual summer get-together.<eos> The whole neighborhood comes.<eos> A really fun group.<eos> A lot of us work together.<eos> At MBI?
7:00 a.m. Just look for the van.<eos> Why are we meeting there?<eos> Well, so we can strategize before we take it upstairs!<eos> My buddy says the last time he saw tech like that was on a dead man.<eos> Dead man?
Where did you get an onion?<eos> - Who? Me?<eos> - Yeah, you.<eos> I got it from upstairs.<eos> From our kitchen.
Make the exchange, leave the hotel.<eos> Got it.<eos> In and out.<eos> Just out of curiosity, what happens, you know, worst-case scenario?<eos> Worst-case scenario?
- Yeah.<eos> You look good.<eos> Don't forget those pants.<eos> Reminds me of our first date.<eos> And our second.
Okay?<eos> They're too good for that.<eos> Why don't we let them go back to their world?<eos> And then you and I, we, can settle this here?<eos> Here in our world.

Where does that get you?<eos> Well, they play audio back at us from an unseen source.<eos> Audio of what?<eos> It's bits of conversation from the room, random clips of dialogue.<eos> Really, we...
You saw what we did to her.<eos> We can not go on.<eos> We must do what is right.<eos> We must do what is right for Lucy.<eos> Not for you, not for me, not for ... strange woman, but for Lucy.
Thomas Edward Sherbourne.<eos> Knuckey am the Superintendent, Police Partageuse.<eos> Roennfeldt represent Frank and his daughter Grace.<eos> Where is the girl?<eos> For the rear.

Bye.<eos> You liking it? Here?<eos> Shadow Canyon?<eos> Yeah, I guess. It's different.<eos> From Berkeley?
Hold!<eos> Please!<eos> On your feet.<eos> Please show mercy!<eos> On your feet!

Just put them in the drawer.<eos> Hi.<eos> Am I needed?<eos> DVD weather, I think.<eos> Des Hommes Et Des Dieux.
I don't...<eos> I don't want to go in yet.<eos> I just want to be a man who has been to a concert with a girl in a red dress.<eos> Just a few minutes more.<eos> So, um...
- That's because you haven't been anywhere.<eos> - Oh...<eos> So where's better than this, then?<eos> Val d'lsère?<eos> Paris.
Actually, no.<eos> I'm here to kidnap you.<eos> I'm gonna steal you and I'm gonna take you to...<eos> Where?<eos> - Rio. - Mmm.

Last Sunday, my owner feeds me a small white pill, right?<eos> I start to feel a little groggy.<eos> The next thing I know, I wake up, I'm in the sky!<eos> Wait a minute.<eos> The sky?
Boring!<eos> Give us detail!<eos> Okay.<eos> Max?<eos> Okay, well, uh...
Gavin?<eos> Jack.<eos> What happened to you?<eos> You remember those stories that Meacham used to tell us?<eos> About dragons?
He drew this?<eos> He says it's his friend from the forest.<eos> And it reminded me of...<eos> I know what it reminded you of.<eos> That one?
Dude, we have met 37 insane women.<eos> We can't bring any of these girls.<eos> Maybe dad'll just forget about his ultimatum.<eos> Why would dad forget about an old tomato?<eos> No, his ultimatum.

To me aww.<eos> Can't you see?<eos> You 're so beautiful this is real beautiful, man.<eos> You're everything I hoped for<eos> - in a little sister!

It's like birth, you know.<eos> One person enters the hospital, two people come out.<eos> Walk and talk.<eos> I'll tell you on the plane.<eos> What plane?
You look like you can get some rest, buddy.<eos> - Who you meeting here?<eos> - I'm not meeting anybody.<eos> They told me at long's you were meeting somebody.<eos> At long's?
Well, we used fans, and lights and rain machines.<eos> Obviously, all of this was reliant on us getting caught.<eos> But we needed to make sure that you would do exactly what we needed you to do once you did catch us.<eos> My brother Chase, who was technical adviser to the losing team. He taught us that it's all about blind spots.<eos> And... surprises.
I don't know.<eos> That's why I have to speak to Cody.<eos> That's not going to happen.<eos> I need to find out more about him.<eos> About his dreams.
Once you got older... you'd forget most of this.<eos> And you'd tell people the Canker ate your mommy.<eos> And as more time went by... in your mind.<eos> The Canker Man ate my mommy.<eos> In your mind, Cody.
So they're currently in alien terrain surrounded by millions of the most vicious creatures on the planet.<eos> Humans.<eos> So where would you say that a medium-sized creature who likes broad open plains, trees, sort of waterholes, that sort of thing.<eos> Where might she go?<eos> In New York City?

And then we all break out into this big dance routine, and everyone is there.<eos> And then you and I just run off into the night with the twinkling lights of the city behind us.<eos> You were a bit attractive back there.<eos> Back where?<eos> On the boat.
All right.<eos> Hey, uh, before you go, I... wrote down some song lyrics.<eos> - Really?<eos> - Yeah, it's pretty stream of consciousness stuff, but it's about this kid and a girl.<eos> In the future.
- I'm sorry.<eos> Sorry. - Piss off!<eos> Remember that we are at altitude here, so drink plenty of water while you acclimatize.<eos> Where did you learn English?<eos> At medical school.
Camera stuff.<eos> You fucking kidding me?<eos> This is an orange ruck.<eos> No, ma'am.<eos> Not on my vehicle.
No, ma'am.<eos> Not on my vehicle.<eos> The girl at the North Face store said it was, like, military grade.<eos> Well, where are you gonna hide it?<eos> Inside a fucking sunset?
They like to shoot off guns at weddings here.<eos> You get it, you're from Florida.<eos> Funny.<eos> When was the last time I saw you?<eos> Since June?
I just...<eos> I don't have one.<eos> Come on.<eos> I was at the gym after work one night.<eos> Stationary bike.
- Mary may visit me in New York.<eos> - Mm-hmm.<eos> And he's never been to Texas. Maybe we meet halfway.<eos> What?<eos> In the Chattahoochee National Forest in Georgia?
I can't be the only one that knows that's halfway.<eos> You're not seriously going to visit each other.<eos> And why wouldn't we?<eos> Oh please, you're just saying this to antagonize me.<eos> Oh, not at all.
Come on, spit it out, Mike!<eos> Yeah, um...<eos> There's been a diagnosis and... you have dementia.<eos> - Dementia?<eos> - Early on-set.
Wait a minute, Dawn.<eos> Don't you remember?<eos> I stayed at your place.<eos> I wrote you a song.<eos> # In the warmth of your mountain cabin #
It's a fucking baby factory.<eos> I wanna start my life over again.<eos> So far, I've been a rebellious teenager, lover, waitress, gallery director,<eos> nanny, and a whore.<eos> And not necessarily in that order.
The cops need a lot.<eos> Have we met somewhere before?<eos> I don't think so.<eos> And you know Megan from...<eos> Uh, from the gallery.
- I know.<eos> I've been briefed.<eos> Good.<eos> Who are you thinking about?<eos> My mother.
We confiscate them from the Resistance.<eos> I remember Marianne.<eos> I remember when I met her.<eos> It was in a café.<eos> In Dordogne.
Pierson is a global corporation with an infantry of lawyers, but with this, we can go after Denning personally for fraud.<eos> Wow, you thought this through?<eos> If you're gonna go after Denning for fraud publicly, a man worth about 8.5 billion dollars?<eos> And you're gonna accuse this man of manipulating drug trials?<eos> In a lawsuit, yes.
You need someone who isn't afraid of the wrong thing... for the right reasons.<eos> That's you?<eos> You take it all. You give it to Hill.<eos> Let him look at it, and I think you could lead a support team.<eos> Leader of the support team?
It's very... damaged, isn't it?<eos> It's the... It's the trauma to bone and tissue that interests me.<eos> Where's the deer now?<eos> In the tank.<eos> - The tank?
- Bye.<eos> Hello.<eos> - People are talking.<eos> - About what?<eos> That kid.
Morse, isn't it?<eos> - Anthony said it was.<eos> - Yes, you know Anthony?<eos> He's been my guest many times.<eos> Both here and in London.
Bogswinkles!<eos> It's a phizzwizard!<eos> I don't be seeing many of them any more.<eos> It's behind you on your elbow!<eos> No, not that elbow!
I don't be seeing many of them any more.<eos> It's behind you on your elbow!<eos> No, not that elbow!<eos> Now it's on your foot!<eos> The other foot!
"You'll bungle it up, sir, if you do it all your way."<eos> And his dad... His eyes is googling out of his head.<eos> And then his ma, she comes into the room.<eos> And his dad, he tells her.<eos> And then... so on, and so on, and so on.
You not be finding it a second time.<eos> Just look at those bubbles.<eos> I believe in the BFG.<eos> The BFG!<eos> To the BFG.
Oh, no, I'm so sorry.<eos> The gardener found all the fish dead in the pond.<eos> And all the plants are dying.<eos> Can we bury Chil and Bill in the sea?<eos> In the sea?
Already good progress!<eos> They are up to something.<eos> I mean, so our informants told us.<eos> Where would we be without our informants?<eos> Nowhere.
Who took these?<eos> Some epileptic?<eos> Yes, Helmut Newton, over here.<eos> - Yeah, there were something wrong with the ... -With the "thing"..<eos> Yes, the "thing".
You are not going to fuck up anyone.<eos> They are policemen after all.<eos> I don't want to get in to some kind of... retribution.<eos> Your Lordship...<eos> Specially not in my condition.
Come back, bastard!<eos> Help!<eos> He comes only for the weekend ... to look over his horses.<eos> He lives in town.<eos> Where in the town?
What the hell, Terry?<eos> I'm working on a case, baby.<eos> And Danny here is a star witness.<eos> As in the film, that kid who died.<eos> In what film?
I'm late, I know.<eos> Sorry.<eos> They kept me at work an extra hour.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> Okay.
Or if they do, it's a name associated with a horror story that they can hardly remember.<eos> An urban folktale from another time.<eos> And yet, in 1976, the eyes of France were trained on this street.<eos> A nation held its breath.<eos> In shock.
The real danger, Michèle, is you.<eos> Did you know about her?<eos> Yeah, I met her once.<eos> When was that?<eos> Last week.
Perhaps, yes.<eos> Thanks.<eos> I never counted. but there must be something like 20 windows in this house.<eos> It's a westerly, so let's start there.<eos> In the kitchen.
I'm the cutie of the crowd.<eos> Yeah!<eos> - What's up? - I mean, she's the rider.<eos> Like, if you're friends with her, she will make sure that you are fine.<eos> Regardless.
Jake, tell her.<eos> It happens.<eos> In Nevada, left a girl in the desert with nothing.<eos> It just happened before you came.<eos> East Texas, gas station.
- Just play with your toys.<eos> No, no, no, don't hit mate.<eos> Don't hit yourself.<eos> No no no.. Not your head..<eos> Not your head.
Does he look like a killer?<eos> No.<eos> He has the face of a friend.<eos> Who are you talking about?<eos> Captain Andor.
Sir, it's Scarif base.<eos> They're reporting a Rebel incursion.<eos> I want to speak with Director Krennic.<eos> He's there, sir.<eos> On Scarif.
-Computers.<eos> Well then, Snowden. You've some to the whorehouse.<eos> The front lines in the global war on terror are not Iraq or Afghanistan.<eos> They're here.<eos> In London.
Well then, Snowden. You've some to the whorehouse.<eos> The front lines in the global war on terror are not Iraq or Afghanistan.<eos> They're here.<eos> In London.<eos> Berlin.
The front lines in the global war on terror are not Iraq or Afghanistan.<eos> They're here.<eos> In London.<eos> Berlin.<eos> Istanbul.
Soviet Frontier.<eos> Desert Storm.<eos> And then the big new challenge.<eos> Find the terrorists in the Internet haystack.<eos> Helluva haystack.
And they'll say I endangered national security.<eos> They'll demonize me, and my friends and family.<eos> And they'll throw me in jail.<eos> That's the best case scenario.<eos> And the worst?
Yes, sorry. You wanna take a look?<eos> Might make you feel better.<eos> It's not recording, just on standby.<eos> When did this start for you? Not wanting your photo taken?<eos> Uh, probably in Japan.
Okay?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Oh, thank you.<eos> I've been thinking about what the doctor said.<eos> About less stress.
Jesus. -It's something else, huh?<eos> So, what deck are you working on?<eos> -You NTOC or ROC?<eos> Between you and me?<eos> NTOC.
FRIDAY, June 7, 2013<eos> In the abstract, you can complain about Big Brother and how this is a potential program run amok, but when you actually look at the details, then I think weÕve struck the right balance.<eos> U.S. President Barack Obama staunchly defends U.S. government programs insisting that they were conducted with broad safeguards to protect against abuse.<eos> He reached the conclusion that what was happening inside this really secretive agency was very threatening and menacing to privacy rights, to Internet freedom, to basic political liberty.<eos> Not only in the United States but all around the world.
Because I have an audition next week.<eos> I'm playing a serious firefighter. So you're an actress.<eos> I thought you look familiar.<eos> Have I seen you on anything?<eos> A coffee shop on the Warner Bros. lot.
Boise.<eos> - Boise?<eos> To Boise!<eos> You should come.<eos> - To Boise?
- It's a mask.<eos> - What?<eos> - It isn't Hanna.<eos> - What do you mean?<eos> Oh, my God.
"Appliquer Principe Et Prouve."<eos> Applied and proven principles.<eos> If Mary Drake is A.D., she's a self-taught "uber A."<eos> And she's been to more countries than your emoji.<eos> Mostly Europe.
- Go to Janet's.<eos> - Jessica's.<eos> - Which one's she?<eos> - The one with the brown hair.<eos> - Glass eye?
Because?<eos> - That would be national news.<eos> - Yeah, so?<eos> Oh, so when's the last time you were on national news?<eos> - February.
In Detroit, yeah.<eos> Three times.<eos> Really?<eos> That's where this all started.<eos> The Detroit show.
I don't know.<eos> Has the investigator asked you about something?<eos> Of course.<eos> -What about?<eos> -About cars.
-Does anyone else know what happened?<eos> -No. Tamara Ivanovna ordered not to tell anyone.<eos> So that there is no panic.<eos> Where are the CCTV records?<eos> In the server room.
A native speaker.<eos> An American.<eos> Anything new at work?<eos> Everything's good.<eos> Both at work and in private life.
Everything's good.<eos> Both at work and in private life.<eos> -How about you?<eos> -What do you mean?<eos> At work.
Probably no one.<eos> I live alone.<eos> You think I killed the guys?<eos> What were your relationships with the victims?<eos> Normal working relationships.
A dark-haired man, 30 to 35 years old, he spent a whole night in Novikova's bedroom.<eos> What do you think they were doing there?<eos> Solving crossword puzzles.<eos> That's it.<eos> In a general biological sense.
I can't remember right on the spot.<eos> Well, maybe she had a boyfriend?<eos> You'd better talk to Natasha Gaponova about it, she's the prefect.<eos> How do we find her?<eos> In the dorm.
What do you have?<eos> -I haven't heard a thank you.<eos> -What's with the voice?<eos> -What do you mean?<eos> Exactly, this.
I'll certainly look that up in chemistry textbook.<eos> We are dealing with face-painting silicone.<eos> What's that?<eos> It's used to make masks, thin and durable.<eos> Like in Hollywood movies?
You'll have tea at home. With your wife.<eos> Wow, you're on time.<eos> Doesn't look like you.<eos> -What did you want to talk about?<eos> -About your son.
This is doctor Semyonov, infectionist.<eos> I'm listening.<eos> I have information about the person performing the vaccination.<eos> Where are you now?<eos> At work.
I am listening.<eos> We have an information leak.<eos> If you say at least a word about me...<eos> Of course not.<eos> No, no.
But I'm asking you not to show it to anybody.<eos> If somebody finds out about it... that would be the end of my career.<eos> Unfortunately, the rehabilitation of patients with grave psychological traumas is often an unpredictable process, and it is hard to understand what's happening with the patient's mind.<eos> This means she won't recover soon.<eos> Hardly in the nearest future.
A paralyzed girl under a glass dome in some underground shelter?<eos> Do you believe this?<eos> Here, I was embarked on a motor boat and then fainted.<eos> I came to my senses there.<eos> -In an underground shelter?
I feel Scotland Yard has reached a new low.<eos> That's not why I'm here.<eos> - I surmise.<eos> - What was her name? The bride?<eos> Emelia Ricoletti.
She married you.<eos> I assume she was capable of finding a reason.<eos> I'll do my best to save your life tonight. But first, it would help if you would explain your connection to the Ricoletti case.<eos> Ricoletti?<eos> Yes. In detail, please.
- Please don't.<eos> - Why do you need to be alone?<eos> If you are referring to romantic entanglement, Watson, which I rather fear you are, as I have often explained before, all emotion is abhorrent to me.<eos> It is the grit in a sensitive instrument.<eos> - The crack in the lens. - The crack in the lens. Yes.
So, you see, Watson, Mycroft was right.<eos> This is a war we must lose.<eos> She was dying.<eos> - Who was?<eos> - Emelia Ricoletti.
It's a scratch.<eos> You'll be fine.<eos> You'll be fine. You'll be fine.<eos> You're fine, all right?<eos> -I'm fine.
The international community needs to realize that this type of imperialist intervention is nothing new.<eos> But we, Katanga...<eos> Sir.<eos> I want a private meeting with Tshombe.<eos> Somewhere neutral.
How many dead at Radio Katanga?<eos> Thirty, sir.<eos> This will negate a vast reserve of goodwill towards the organization and show that we cannot behave any better than any single country.<eos> Sir, these things happen in war.<eos> Not in my war.
But you allowed a massacre at the radio station.<eos> You expect me to defend that?<eos> What am I to do if a commander chooses to go in hard?<eos> You're the man on the ground.<eos> Not every square inch of it, sir.
"There are no reports of survivors."<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> The tragic death of the Secretary General of the United Nations on his way to the Congo.<eos> Everything now teeters in the balance, which has increased the stakes for the United States and the Soviet Republic.<eos> In Washington,
There's talk of a court martial for cowardice.<eos> Do it.<eos> I don't care.<eos> Not just for you.<eos> For them.
Not just for you.<eos> For them.<eos> You can have him court-martialed for that.<eos> No, it would only kick up too much dust.<eos> Anyway...
You don't have to take it from us.<eos> Take it from him.<eos> Go ahead, Vern.<eos> Tell her about the arrangement.<eos> What arrangement?
Take it from him.<eos> Go ahead, Vern.<eos> Tell her about the arrangement.<eos> What arrangement?<eos> That... Arrangement.
We'll be gods to future generations.<eos> I'll be a god.<eos> You'll be just what you've always been.<eos> What's that?<eos> A footnote.
We start over.<eos> I have been offered a post at Harvard.<eos> I was going to turn it down.<eos> Now I have a mind to take it.<eos> To Boston.
How would you describe your relationship with your stepdaughter?<eos> Not great, to be honest.<eos> Honesty is why we're here.<eos> How come it wasn't great, if you know?<eos> The drugs mainly.
- Do you like to get high?<eos> - No, sir.<eos> On your polygraph... an abnormal answer... causes the needle... to jump as high as here.<eos> Mine's beneath it.<eos> But at a greater variance than your other answers.
Yeah.<eos> He was a bright guy.<eos> Quite the young liberal.<eos> I take it you lean a little more to the right.<eos> Not this year.
What was once believed to be a deadly kidnapping perpetrated by a rogue ranger team now appears to be directly linked to none other than our very own Senator Cook, who falsely informed the ranger team that weapons of mass destruction<eos> were to be found at the temporary Costa Rican home of Alexander Hubert resulting in the young man's death.<eos> The soldiers were then tragically killed on the scene and falsely painted as traitors.<eos> Do you know what I think about a lot?<eos> Your death.
I have no brother,<eos> I am like no brother.<eos> And this word "love", which gray-beards call divine,<eos> Be resident in men like one another<eos> And not in me.
Nice to see you too, Miller.<eos> Havelock, you don't listen.<eos> I told you.<eos> I said, keep your head down, keep your eyes open.<eos> Especially in the Medina.
Should be in the Black Freighter right now, buying each other rounds, talking future plans.<eos> Try it on.<eos> Your head's big enough.<eos> We are fighting for something precious here, Miller.<eos> Sure, a fatter percentage of the docks.
All right, sweetheart, what do you got for me?<eos> _<eos> I think that'll do just fine.<eos> - You ever think about them?<eos> - Who?
You're gonna be fine, man.<eos> The mountain is a majestical place where you push your limits and you maximize your potential.<eos> No, the mountain is a place where you party, man, have fun.<eos> That's what it's all about.<eos> Yeah, like those '80s movies.
Well, sire, the truth of it is, the clans canna agree on the color of the sky, let alone put aside their old grievances and band together to fight the British.<eos> No, sire... they're not ready to hear the call of the pipes nor likely to be so for many years to come.<eos> I dare say... If that is the truth... it is one I have yet to hear.<eos> Damnable defeatist talk is what it sounds like and very peculiar coming from a supposed Jacobite.<eos> - Ooh, monsieur...
Forget about him, Daniel.<eos> Life is full of Mr Maltards.<eos> It is men like you who will build the future.<eos> - Thank you, Mr...<eos> - Everything all right?
When she sees this scene, Only then will she believe in the engagement.<eos> Then treat me as a doll.<eos> I'll also think of another woman.<eos> And who will you think of?<eos> Duchess Juliet.
You could say we had a conversation.<eos> He knew squat.<eos> Well... why the hell you talking to him then?<eos> There was a crew over in Harlem that Joey had his eyes on.<eos> In Harlem?
First you lose your wife, now your partner.<eos> Hey, I'm gonna have a little birthday party for the twins in two weeks.<eos> Bring your son.<eos> He's in Florida.<eos> Florida?
I mean, you saying total?<eos> Or you saying when they're diagnosed with this, or what?<eos> What are you saying?<eos> Tell me the fucking truth.<eos> Total.
Yeah.<eos> I mean, uh, nobody even knows where she is.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, yeah, I know. I was just curious what you thought.<eos> Anyway...
I got to go to sleep.<eos> Good night.<eos> Where are you going to stay tonight?<eos> I don't know.<eos> A motel.
Why don't you call that girl Sandy, and see if she'll come over?<eos> No, thanks.<eos> Nice try, though.<eos> Who are you going to shoot?<eos> You or me?
Go ahead.<eos> Can I have some money?<eos> Yes.<eos> So, when am I supposed to move in with Georgie?<eos> July.
Oh, when I get back home,<eos> I am gonna ride the bus every day.<eos> Manny, this is just the beginning.<eos> Every day, you ride the bus and count the minutes, hoping you'll see her again.<eos> Oh, my God.
I wish you all could have seen it.<eos> We just have to show them.<eos> What the fuck?<eos> Wait.<eos> Oh, Jesus.
Well? You guys talking shop again?<eos> Hello, dad.<eos> Hi, Spaghetti.<eos> - How are you?<eos> - Really good, actually.
The Illiescu thing wasn't exactly elegant.<eos> The next steps are clear.<eos> But please inform me if there are any more problems.<eos> Okay, I will.<eos> But otherwise...
Mr. Erdmann, we're going to the club and would love it if you join us.<eos> In.. which embassy do you work for?<eos> Translation, please.<eos> - In which embassy you work.<eos> - In the German...
In.. which embassy do you work for?<eos> Translation, please.<eos> - In which embassy you work.<eos> - In the German...<eos> Uh, in the German.
You know that part of Cleveland?<eos> Dude, I know all of c-town, better than anybody.<eos> He's got a 300-pound fool he calls a bouncer.<eos> He likes to drive a beamer seven.<eos> But not in the hood.
I wanna, you know, sit down, and I want you to give me five things, five character flaws that I can do a reboot on.<eos> - You know, a do-over on... amend my character flaws, as it were.<eos> Like, you know, I mean, just sit down and really go with candor, whether it's my fuckin' mother's fault or my father's fault, it doesn't really matter.<eos> Fuck!<eos> Oh, god.
On the TV, the shootout.<eos> Yes, but it wasn't like they say.<eos> Well, how was it?<eos> You ever been inside, reverend?<eos> In the joint?
You really want to do this?<eos> Do you?<eos> Are you prepared to marry a fallen woman?<eos> Are you prepared to stay here?<eos> This hut?
Jesus born in Texas, God up in the sky.<eos> A guy in a cave believes he's a prophet because a floating man told him so.<eos> That's some psychotic shit.<eos> - So I'm psychotic?<eos> About this? Yeah.
I promise we'll do everything we can.<eos> There's 11 stops to Hamburg and we need two plainclothes officers at every station.<eos> To officers are on the train from Randers, another will board along side Elias, and we've got to cars along the route, in case he slips past us.<eos> That's 25 plainclothes officers.<eos> True plainclothes.
Yes?<eos> We have contact.<eos> - I see him.<eos> Which car are you in?<eos> - 22.
No gang affiliation?<eos> Okay.<eos> Well, in that case, good luck to you.<eos> Let me ask you something. Where were you before you came up here?<eos> - Coffee room.
Did you hear what I said?<eos> No.<eos> Where is it?<eos> Where is what?<eos> The cab.
As what?<eos> A TV crime movie.<eos> I play a cadaver.<eos> Can you get my glasses?<eos> On the shelf.
- 5 minutes. Don't just stand there.<eos> - Something wrong?<eos> - Sorry, I look like a bum.<eos> - I spend all night outside.<eos> - Outside?
- When can we say truth is established?<eos> - That's the question.<eos> In the end, the problem is less the existence of truth, than criteria for establishing it.<eos> Distinguish between the areas where truth can be proved, from those concerned with belief, conviction, faith, but not established truths.<eos> - Like art.
We'll be back in August for our project.<eos> A new website. Thanks to Simon.<eos> He's a computer wiz.<eos> - A website for what?<eos> - Philosophy.
Write on occasional text, reread the main articles.<eos> Maybe write editorials on current events.<eos> Seen from a philosophical angle, of course.<eos> - In fact you want to hire me.<eos> - In a way.
I always insisted on making actions and thoughts compatible.<eos> - I try to practice it myself.<eos> - Yeah, okay.<eos> - But only in the private sphere.<eos> - How so?
'Swounds I should take it, for it cannot be but I am pigeon-livered and lack gall to make oppression bitter, or ere this I should have fatted all the region kites with this slave's offal.<eos> Bloody, bawdy villain!<eos> Remorseless, treacherous, lecherous, kindless villain!<eos> O vengeance!
What a... bummer.<eos> ALEX:<eos> OK. LET'S DO THIS<eos> Hey, you know where there is surf?<eos> California.
- I like homework.<eos> SHE STRAINS<eos> Still... more homework now, less housework later.<eos> You'll be able to get yourself a nice job in an office.<eos> Or a bank.
THEY LAUGH<eos> 'And so the Easter festivities ended and several new chapters began.<eos> 'In the spring of 1961, 'the sun shone, the moon was suddenly within the reach of man.<eos> 'Science was all-powerful, all medicine was good.'<eos> In first place, Belinda!
I mean, typhoid!<eos> I thought that went out with the Ark!<eos> Or at least the war.<eos> It is unusual nowadays.<eos> In this country, at any rate.
- I think everybody...<eos> - Benny, stay where you are!<eos> I don't want to hear another crack like that come out of your mouth, my girl.<eos> Benny is family and that's not how we treat family.<eos> Not in my house.
Someone told me if you have it at home, they give you gas through the cooker, and I think that's dangerous.<eos> That would be very dangerous indeed!<eos> Gas and air is completely different, and the midwives bring the apparatus to your home.<eos> What if something goes wrong?<eos> With the delivery?
Some of the old hands come with their knickers in their pockets, and don't put them on until we've finished!<eos> Linda, have you been having any spotting?<eos> What's spotting?<eos> Losing little amounts of blood, as you would at the beginning of a monthly?<eos> Only early on.
Did you drink your milk?<eos> Pint and a half a day for the calcium.<eos> Mother swore by it.<eos> And I'm fit as a flea.<eos> Even at this grand old age.
I don't want to see lung cancer as the biggest cause of death in Poplar in five years' time.<eos> - We gave you your chest clinic.<eos> - For one morning!<eos> I am talking about a clinic twice a month, for a whole day.<eos> In a larger premises.
I think we ought to go again - and take the Sunday school with us.<eos> - See?<eos> I am nothing if not an incurable romantic. - SHE GIGGLES<eos> That sounds splendid.<eos> On one condition.
It doesn't matter.<eos> - Your sleeping bag's soaking wet!<eos> - At least it's WARM wet!<eos> What are you thinking about?<eos> The children.
They're only about five feet away.<eos> What if it falls down again?<eos> It won't, I promise you.<eos> What are you thinking about?<eos> The ulcer clinic.
Sister Julienne put me on the spot.<eos> - Well, you hadn't said a word till then!<eos> - Well, nobody asked me to.<eos> And I could hardly chip in, you were talking about medicine and menstr...<eos> Menstruation.
We went to the seaside at the weekend.<eos> It was a bit blowy, but it did us all good, including Susan.<eos> And then I heard the news.<eos> The news?<eos> About Sister Evangelina.
So they were drugged when they jumped.<eos> Everything seems to indicate that.<eos> It's not her.<eos> No, it's not her.<eos> Here, on this one. And here.
No, it's not the tone I'm concerned about.<eos> Please.<eos> I'm concerned about you thinking that my sister might be a murderer.<eos> I said she might be involved.<eos> - In murder.
[Pop] They lose 65 games only to end up with the fourth pick in the draft.<eos> Did they tank that shit on purpose?<eos> Read the words, Pop.<eos> Right there on the wall.
He won't like it but I'll donate some money... anonymously.<eos> -It's all gonna be okay. [chuckles softly] -[pats arm]<eos> What?<eos> Pops is dead.<eos> A casualty of war.
[scoffs]<eos> Is that sufficient?<eos> There's enough there.<eos> You all right, cuz?<eos> With what?
It's a... it's a book on politics and the social conditions that created hip-hop.<eos> - Yeah. The Dodgers left Brooklyn,<eos> Robert Moses created the Cross Bronx Expressway, and white folks went running for the suburbs.<eos> This cat named Moynihan went and hollered at Nixon, and told the prez that maybe the inner city could benefit from the benign neglect.<eos> Benign what?
If she comes back... tell her Luke Cage came by.<eos> I need to see her.<eos> You him, huh?<eos> Your name is all over Harlem today.<eos> Not in a good way.
And indictments lead to pleas.<eos> There's always a bigger fish, a bigger angle.<eos> A slap on the wrist.<eos> Boom.<eos> Right back in business.
Criminal Spinsters?<eos> Who you callin' a spinster?<eos> I'd wear your narrow ass out.<eos> What's this about?<eos> Your cousin.
I tried to explain.<eos> I made calls.<eos> I sent letters... and he returned every last one of them.<eos> Then why let your father's last memory of you be as a criminal?<eos> A dead criminal.
Stryker!<eos> [Stryker] You left me to rot, Carl.<eos> We can work this out.<eos> [Stryker] Work what out?<eos> My life?
- Didn't Reva tell you about this?<eos> - No.<eos> That's not gonna do anything.<eos> - [Burstein grunts] - [scalpel snaps]<eos> Oh, my God.
I'm not some idiot who's afraid of blacks and Hispanics.<eos> I said "police." Where's Luke Cage?<eos> Who?<eos> Wisdom is locked up.<eos> He in C-74.
This must never happen again.<eos> Yes, Chief.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Do you have time to talk now?<eos> About what?
Oh, I'm counting on that.<eos> Is that even clean?<eos> Clean enough for a tourniquet.<eos> Who were you, a Boy Scout?<eos> Force Recon.
Okay, I'm gonna need you to pass out.<eos> -What?<eos> -I need you to pass out.<eos> I'm gonna get us out of this.<eos> -[sighs] -[Claire] Oh... Oh, my God!
And what does that tell you?<eos> He wants distance.<eos> Deniability.<eos> If this goes wrong, the blood is on my hands,<eos> -and mine alone.
Is there anything I can do?<eos> See what else Turk knows.<eos> He's in a Dumpster in an alley on 123rd.<eos> Near Mount Olivet and the shop.<eos> A Dumpster?
- England.<eos> - No, you're from England.<eos> - That doesn't count. - Yeah. Okay.<eos> - Here, then. - Anywhere other than here.<eos> - England. - Wow.
I thank them from the bottom of my heart in the name of my husband, Ian Finch.<eos> Why did you choose to sell this particular collection?<eos> Well, first of all, all the characters are extremely popular and the most rare originals around, and I just thought they would raise the highest amount.<eos> What good are plastic superheroes, when my husband, a real hero, is off languishing in God knows where?<eos> - Ecuador. - Ecuador.
It's been one hell of a week.<eos> Please tell me you're not helping Erica.<eos> - You cannot trust her. - I know.<eos> She has lied to me about so many things.<eos> But not everything.
Is that clear?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Good luck.<eos> - All good?<eos> - Good.
Four, you take enough, it makes you psychotic.<eos> Five, you lied to me.<eos> So I'm gonna ask you because your life depends upon it:<eos> What else have you lied about?<eos> Nothing.
LONDON, UNITED KINGDOM<eos> Yes?<eos> This is Jason Bourne.<eos> I need to talk.<eos> What about?
- Hey, that's enough.<eos> No, that's okay, ma'am.<eos> But, listen, if you do ever want to read one of these books... you're going to have to check it out.<eos> - What, like a library?<eos> - Exactly like a library.
The only thing they have in common is they hate Elves more.<eos> (horse whinnying)<eos> I'll keep my ears covered... just like always.<eos> You're the same as your father.<eos> Never happy with your place in the world.

- No.<eos> - Tell me.<eos> No.<eos> I don't think I'm very good at it.<eos> Sex?
I don't think I'm very good at it.<eos> Sex?<eos> No.<eos> Like meeting' people.<eos> Datin'.
- All right?<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> Came to see you.<eos> So, what's the story with your girlfriend?<eos> What?
- Directly? - Yes.<eos> Pity you have no CCTV cameras.<eos> Well, business isn't exactly booming. I can't afford them.<eos> No vehicle stopped by while you were here?<eos> No car, motorbike or scooter?
You weren't on the guest list.<eos> Was my friend invited?<eos> He wasn't invited but he went anyway.<eos> Was it him and the...<eos> when... the party?
Excuse me.<eos> We have a problem?<eos> We have some unscheduled activity.<eos> Evidently, one of your creatures is restless.<eos> In the park?
We have a problem?<eos> We have some unscheduled activity.<eos> Evidently, one of your creatures is restless.<eos> In the park?<eos> No, sublevel 83, cold storage.
So our creatures have been misbehaving, and you haven't yet isolated the bug?<eos> That's so unlike you, Bernard.<eos> Unless, of course, you have and are simply embarrassed by the result.<eos> It's the code you added, sir.<eos> The reveries.
Making a hell of a racket, though.<eos> You wanted me.<eos> Well, let this be a lesson.<eos> The lesson is...<eos> Oh, Jesus.
- It's my fault.<eos> What is?<eos> That she's dead.<eos> I found it.<eos> On the meadows.
What is?<eos> That she's dead.<eos> I found it.<eos> On the meadows.<eos> On the meadows?
I've got to send Abigail's belongings back to her parents.<eos> Why didn't you say you knew Abigail?<eos> Why didn't you just say?<eos> She spoke to me in confidence.<eos> - About what?
Alright, take it easy<eos> Where am I? What time is it?<eos> ... Maryland. ...<eos> Time is 4:48 a.m.<eos> Maryland?
Is this about Molly?<eos> No, no, no, no...<eos> Well, you've really put me in the shit<eos> I'm in Brighton, with a friend who's been ill<eos> Brighton?
Is Chloe here? - No.<eos> I've not seen her since last night.<eos> Do you know where she is?<eos> - She probably crashed at the party.<eos> Party?
Ah, I'm all right.<eos> Dane. Where are the drugs?<eos> I went round to Chloe's. Her mum wouldn't leave me alone.<eos> - They're in her drawer.<eos> - Which drawer?
Dr McKenzie?<eos> Do you still see her?<eos> No.<eos> She works at the old Women's Prison as a tour guide.<eos> The convict prison?
They are decent people.<eos> What does that mean?<eos> Max said you were talking about Dr McKenzie.<eos> - I asked her.<eos> - What?
Is that your Chloe they're talking about?<eos> Get in.<eos> Interview with Miss Anna Macy, commencing at 9:45 a.m., Tuesday the 11th of August with Senior Constable Fergus McFadden and Senior Detective Brian Dutch.<eos> Can you tell us when you last saw Chloe Holloway?<eos> At the party in the forest.
People you hardly know, they'll come around.<eos> They love it.<eos> Like vampires feeding at the grief.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> The injustice.
State Health Authority.<eos> Craig Grayson?<eos> Yeah.<eos> We need to take a team of people, up to Mother Sullivan's Ridge.<eos> First light tomorrow.
Renae, I didn't mean that.<eos> I've probably been a fool waiting all this time.<eos> Travis filled a space and now he's gone.<eos> Did it ever cross your mind, about Travis?<eos> What about him?
Welcome back.<eos> Oh, and by the way, uh, Lieutenant wants to see you.<eos> Ugh. What kind of mood's he in today?<eos> Tribeca, get the hell in here!<eos> Pretty good. Hmm.
Not...<eos> Stop with the music!<eos> I'm not looking. I'm not looking.<eos> Wow. I'm looking.<eos> Oh, my god.
Get back up on that horse.<eos> We were not meant to settle this inside a courtroom.<eos> We will settle this as God...<eos> As God planned.<eos> Here in the desert.
You got two.<eos> And then it gets bloody.<eos> Where's the money, New York?<eos> I needed the funds to cover a lumber deal in Maine.<eos> Maine?
It's like I fell asleep on a train four years ago.<eos> I had a brother, a family...<eos> Dreams of gold.<eos> But it's like I've woken up, I'm alone...<eos> In hell.
Wai-Ling.<eos> Come here.<eos> Two fifty.<eos> No less.<eos> During a plentiful harvest, maybe.
The food you're enjoying was shipped fresh in the cargo hold of my company's five clipper ships and 10 lorchas.<eos> They're sitting there waiting to be used.<eos> I don't doubt the extent of the resources at your disposal, sir.<eos> It's me you doubt.<eos> My business.
Railroad?<eos> You're that same piece of shit been poaching our workers.<eos> Simply tell me if you've seen anyone new here today... and I'll leave here immediately.<eos> You're trespassing.<eos> On private property.
Monitoring Department, Nuclear Regulation Authority, Minato Ward<eos> I have orders not to go public yet.<eos> But radiation levels in the metro area have risen.<eos> Like a leak somewhere?<eos> A reactor?
I-I can't see who's good or who's bad, and I just keep spinning.<eos> And I just keep circling, and... and then, I-I don't see the knife until it's too late.<eos> - And then I wake up.<eos> - What do you think it means?<eos> In the dream, if...
Maura... focus.<eos> - Okay?<eos> - Okay.<eos> - Tell me about... - Hmm. the tests on the edibles.<eos> - On the edibles. - Mm-hmm.
How are you?<eos> Hey, I couldn't find anyone to talk to.<eos> - Jane:<eos> About what? - Oh, hi.<eos> About what? !
- Right.<eos> Cool.<eos> - Hello, Maura.<eos> - I don't know anything.<eos> About... the case.
- More please! - Um, yeah...<eos> "His cunning and instincts are sharper than the fox.<eos> His wisdom, kind and true."<eos> - That's about me.<eos> - Korsak.
- Speech!<eos> - Speech!<eos> - Come on!<eos> I'm no expert on love.<eos> Or marriage.
Yeah, he was great at it.<eos> Our bomb squad just found another mine.<eos> - What?<eos> Where?<eos> - In the same place.
- And the hat.<eos> - Am I pulling it off?<eos> Trés chic.<eos> It's a great look for you.<eos> You and Che Guevara.
Oh, man.<eos> Hey, guys, guys.<eos> Are you sure you don't want to eat somewhere else?<eos> - No.<eos> Chin chin! - No, chin chin!
- I'll get them.<eos> - Whoa, what's-what's wrong?<eos> You guys have a movie to get to.<eos> I don't really want to get into this right now.<eos> What?
I put them in the trunk of my car.<eos> So you took them home with you?<eos> I did.<eos> Detective, where exactly do you live?<eos> Simi Valley.
Detective, where exactly do you live?<eos> Simi Valley.<eos> Really?<eos> So you took this evidence home to Simi Valley?<eos> Simi Valley.
That is correct.<eos> How long were Mr. Simpson's shoes in your home in Simi Valley?<eos> Approximately six hours.<eos> Six hours.<eos> In Simi Valley.
Excuse me?<eos> Are you accusing me of lying in courtroom?<eos> How dare you?<eos> You can't get away with lying, Mr. Bailey.<eos> Not in this case.
Objection.<eos> - Sustained.<eos> You're being a little vague, counsel.<eos> Detective have you ever heard of a Colombian necktie?<eos> A what?
I really enjoyed the depiction of you in the dining room.<eos> Nice to meet you, Mr Oliver.<eos> Danny, ragtime.<eos> So, where were we?<eos> - Crimea.
Danny, ragtime.<eos> So, where were we?<eos> - Crimea.<eos> - I mean before I bored you with war.<eos> - Politics.
She has freed the slaves from their chains and crucified the Masters for their sins.<eos> She did indeed.<eos> Her dragons are fire made flesh, a gift from the Lord of Light.<eos> But you heard all of this before, haven't you?<eos> On the Long Bridge of Volantis.
Will I be walking naked in the streets?<eos> Or will I spend a few months in the sept dungeons first to teach me about the gods' mercy?<eos> You have served your house and your king faithfully for many years.<eos> And you will continue to do so.<eos> But not in this city.
And what's wrong with you?<eos> I'm not fit to rule.<eos> We can agree upon that at least.<eos> Has the Iron Islands ever had a queen before?<eos> No more than Westeros.
Are you prepared to stand trial and profess your guilt or innocence before the Seven?<eos> There'll be no need for a trial.<eos> I confess before the Seven and freely admit to my crimes.<eos> To which crimes will you be confessing?<eos> All of them.
They all hate each other.<eos> The only thing they have in common is they hate Elves more.<eos> I'll keep my ears covered...<eos> You're the same as your father.<eos> Never happy with your place in the world.
It wasn't enough.<eos> I never want to feel that helpless again.<eos> ♪♪<eos> ♪♪<eos> ♪ In the darkness ♪

(groaning)<eos> How's your head, Princess?<eos> What do you care?<eos> (groans) - Wait, where's Wil?<eos> - Safe.
But this rift between us, I... I can't bear it.<eos> Look, you have not let me down.<eos> The world has let me down.<eos> I need you by my side now more than ever.<eos> But not on the throne.
Well, that's an exaggeration.<eos> We had a thing, but you got a little clingy.<eos> Do you know what it was like for me?<eos> Alone?<eos> In the wilderness?
And you would do so alone?<eos> Perhaps it's what we deserve.<eos> When I tell my tribe what happened to me, I will speak of your honor.<eos> In another life, we are not enemies.<eos> In another life.
Is it because you fear the Fire?<eos> Or because the Halfling still smells of her bed?<eos> Can you feel it?<eos> Yes, a strong magic...<eos> For such weak shoulders.
You need to rest, heal.<eos> The Wilderun is no place for you to be running around alone.<eos> I can take care of myself.<eos> I don't doubt that for a second.<eos> But not in your condition.
So you weren't saving me.<eos> You were going to... what?<eos> Sacrifice me to some damn Troll?<eos> No, that was before I knew you.<eos> Well, in that case...
That'll be an interesting defense to make just before God pulls the lever that sends you both to hell.<eos> That's right, there's a lever.<eos> Felix is obsessed with those neighbors.<eos> Last night, in bed, he called me Linda.<eos> And Frank.
Yeah, okay, sure.<eos> Why not?<eos> - I mean, everybody needs a spotter, right?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Even in life.
Monkey, you said it yourself.<eos> Our quest is a difficult one.<eos> A samurai, even a cursed one with no memory, that looks like a bug, could be helpful. Yes.<eos> I am certain I could be helpful, indispensible.<eos> In what way?
But your grandfather found us.<eos> His rage at my betrayal shook the heavens.<eos> Your father and his army gave their lives, allowing me to escape with you in my arms.<eos> Why does grandfather hate me?<eos> Oh, kubo.
Sword uncomfortable.<eos> The helmet.<eos> I know where it is.<eos> I saw it in a dream, beetle!<eos> A dream?
House in Connecticut.<eos> You know, fresh air.<eos> What are you doing for work these days?<eos> I'm the super here.<eos> A building this size?
- You see that?<eos> - Now, why you have to go fuck it up?<eos> Fuck this. See, Lester here, he's a real musician.<eos> You need to learn how to play a piano or a guitar or something.<eos> A kazoo, nigger.
It will be fine.<eos> I'm tired...<eos> I'd rather wait here, if you don't mind.<eos> Where?<eos> Well, right there in the hall.
But we've gone through a lot of hard times.<eos> And believe me when I say that we are now better than ever.<eos> Daughter, be more generous and more sympathetic to me.<eos> The Andalusians are here!<eos> Oh, Antia, how lovely!
But... why did he go fishing if there was a storm?<eos> The storm came in the afternoon and your father left in the morning.<eos> I am sorry to tell you this, but my husband and I We have organized a trip to Patagonia<eos> Now Bea doesn't want to come with us, She wants to be with Antia, here at home.<eos> Really?
Blessed.<eos> I knew that chicken.<eos> - What?<eos> I have seen that his neck was reversed, most recently at the farm of Chardoul.<eos> Chardoul?
The result of the autopsy is still inside.<eos> You coffee?<eos> I have seen a bear.<eos> - You, at night in the snow.<eos> In your dream.
I do not need help.<eos> But I do.<eos> Will you help me please?<eos> Pilot in the Air Force?<eos> - No, the Army.
I mean, you know, never a wedding, but he's freakin' out.<eos> - And that ring, the ring for Marnie?<eos> - Yeah?<eos> That was for his ex-girlfriend.<eos> - Clementine?
Oh, don't you turn this around on me.<eos> All you do is think about yourself!<eos> You didn't even notice that I switched up the mac and cheese.<eos> Is that what this is about?<eos> The goddamn mac and cheese?
It could help you heal.<eos> Have you listened to what she's saying?<eos> What that stupid board is actually saying? Yes!<eos> Every day!<eos> Basic things!
She started by calling me darling.<eos> An easy guess.<eos> A common term of endearment.<eos> Then said she missed me.<eos> An appeal to comfort.
Otis wasn't using.<eos> He was cooking.<eos> Cops found over 100 crystals in his toilet.<eos> His toilet?<eos> Well, the... the tank.
This is someone you will meet, today, at the Ritz.<eos> I have meetings today.<eos> You have one meeting.<eos> This one.<eos> In London.
My wife managed two sapphires and five diamonds.<eos> This is already for the killing of the spy.<eos> And down payment on future services.<eos> Now tell me, where do you keep these things?<eos> In a... bank?
No.<eos> I'm guessing that means your day was not as successful as mine.<eos> Well, depends on how you measure success.<eos> See, personally, I measure it in sapphires.<eos> - Sapphires? - Mmm.
We have to meet in places where we'd meet anyway.<eos> You should have stopped by Small Heath.<eos> I could have given you a more traditional welcome.<eos> - They want to know about ammunition.<eos> - And chains for the wheels.
I got bored.<eos> You can change what you do, but you can't change what you want.<eos> And what is it that I want?<eos> There's gonna be a vacancy coming up at Shelby Company Limited.<eos> Boston office.
Who the hell are you? What do you want with me?<eos> You've been passing information about a robbery at the Lanchester factory in Sparkbrook.<eos> Are you Tommy Shelby?<eos> I need to know the name of the person in the organisation that was giving you information.<eos> What organisation?
September she reckons.<eos> Her tits feel different already.<eos> Yeah, that's not the only thing that's gonna be different, brother.<eos> You're fucked now, man.<eos> Fucked.
Her tits feel different already.<eos> Yeah, that's not the only thing that's gonna be different, brother.<eos> You're fucked now, man.<eos> Fucked.<eos> Absolutely fucked.
Is that what you want?<eos> I don't know what you want.<eos> You have to tell me what it is that you want and then I'll know.<eos> Actually, we want to know about the robbery you're planning.<eos> Not the factory robbery.
I don't know what you want.<eos> You have to tell me what it is that you want and then I'll know.<eos> Actually, we want to know about the robbery you're planning.<eos> Not the factory robbery.<eos> The other one.
That's some plan.<eos> As you know yourself... .. the arrival of a new life concentrates the mind on practical things.<eos> Amen to that.<eos> When is the child due?<eos> September.
Amen to that.<eos> When is the child due?<eos> September.<eos> When is the robbery?<eos> June.
I didn't come here today to make a speech, but I will say this, these children are now safe.<eos> In our care, they will be safe because we are from the same cold streets as they are.<eos> And, in our care, they won't be shipped away to the colonies, or separated from kin, or made to work for men in their various ways.<eos> They will grow up here, at home, loved.<eos> In Birmingham.
I need 50 sticks of BSA dynamite, 300 yards of cable and six detonators by midday tomorrow.<eos> This is evidence, I need you to scatter it.<eos> We're blowing up a train, people are going to die.<eos> Ruben and I talked about many things.<eos> But not that.
Vienna.<eos> There's a man waiting for me.<eos> Poor man(! ).<eos> You?<eos> Birmingham.
At least there are silly games and orgasms.<eos> So let's fuck.<eos> Here?<eos> No.<eos> No, in a darker place.
I need a favor.<eos> "Nice to see you, Selina."<eos> Sorry for not telling you that I was skipping town to go to my castle in France.<eos> It's a chalet.<eos> In Switzerland.
What will they do?<eos> Instant death.<eos> Kidding.<eos> They'll be in a state of relaxed bliss.<eos> Like a dream.
I didn't know that this was Pinkney's apartment building.<eos> Why are you here?<eos> Pinkney sent me a message.<eos> Wanted to talk outside of work.<eos> About what?
Is that so?<eos> Everything points to a cop.<eos> Or someone who worked with the police, had access.<eos> You all right, Ed?<eos> Right as rain.
Can you do me a favor and take it easy on Bullock?<eos> Thanks.<eos> So... when are you coming back to work?<eos> I'm not coming back.<eos> Not yet anyhow.
- the other one's known as The Lady.<eos> - Her? She's the one that sent the assassins after you at Galavan's penthouse.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Her. You know where she's at?<eos> In the wind.
Sorry, I'm late.<eos> I did get you that salt water taffy you like, so...<eos> You'll wake her.<eos> I thought she was in Arkham.<eos> In a coma.
Strange was ready for the police.<eos> He may even have been tipped off.<eos> The only way we're gonna find out what's really going on in there... is if we break in ourselves.<eos> Break in?<eos> To Arkham?
Master Bruce?<eos> No, it's me.<eos> Where's Bruce?<eos> I don't know. He was in the city.<eos> Where in the city?
I may have a solution.<eos> The technology Strange is using to create these monsters must be very advanced.<eos> My guess is, he's using plutonium isotopes to mutate cell structure.<eos> If so, there'll be trace radiation.<eos> At Wayne Enterprises,
Oh, they are rich, I'm sure.<eos> But can you be more specific?<eos> Who controls Gotham, Jim?<eos> You've never heard of a secret council?<eos> Secret council?
Code Red.<eos> All units Pettsburg Highway.<eos> All units be on the lookout for the Indian Hill bus on Pettsburg Highway.<eos> Captain Bullock, I've got eyes on the bus.<eos> Under the South Burnside Expressway.
- Or stowed away in a lifeboat.<eos> - Or hiding in a wall.<eos> Or holed up in the engine room.<eos> Camouflaged in the shrubbery.<eos> Predator style.
He might be a drug dealer, but we have nothing on him.<eos> Quick question, guys.<eos> Why did the drug dealer never do his dishes?<eos> Because he has drugs in his dishwasher.<eos> - Dishwasher?
Saw you hadn't signed up for the blood drive yet, so I brought you the sheet.<eos> Sorry, can't.<eos> I'm... under 17 years old.<eos> Wait, you didn't sign up last year, either.<eos> Or the year before.
This envelope contains the inheritance my uncle left me.<eos> He died a year ago;<eos> he was so rich, he had a whole room in his house just to eat in.<eos> You mean like a dining room?<eos> - Yeah, but in Manhattan.
Guys, focus.<eos> We need to start planning.<eos> So when's the wedding?<eos> Next summer, next fall, next winter?<eos> Next week.
So when's the wedding?<eos> Next summer, next fall, next winter?<eos> Next week.<eos> - Next what?<eos> - Next week?
- Nice.<eos> - Let's go shoot my nephew.<eos> Gina, do you have any idea what you're getting into?<eos> We play in a league.<eos> A league.
- Well, it's still your mother, in't it?<eos> - Yeah. Of course it is.<eos> I've got this... this idea, in me head.<eos> - It's bugging me.<eos> - What?
Played horn.<eos> Ah, American big band.<eos> Does he still play, your father?<eos> He died in the war.<eos> Okinawa.
Ah, American big band.<eos> Does he still play, your father?<eos> He died in the war.<eos> Okinawa.<eos> Pearl Harbor... despicable.
Oh, yeah.<eos> Princess, Jeanette, shut it!<eos> All of the company records for the first 10 years are in here.<eos> Should probably get rid of this stuff, but it makes me nostalgic.<eos> - For Dad?
Princess, Jeanette, shut it!<eos> All of the company records for the first 10 years are in here.<eos> Should probably get rid of this stuff, but it makes me nostalgic.<eos> - For Dad?<eos> - His money.
I-I am.<eos> Father... here I am, father of the bride.<eos> Frank?<eos> Where do you want me, padre?<eos> No, absolutely not.
Look, it might not matter much anyway, because Janelle's been saying she's not really that into horses anymore.<eos> - I haven't heard that.<eos> - Yeah, man. She's actually showing - a little interest in motocross.<eos> I've been letting her take my 450 for a spin.<eos> - Safely.
You know what I mean!<eos> Yeah, good for others maybe, not me.<eos> I just don't know where a guy like me fits in anymore.<eos> There will always be a place for you in this country.<eos> Right here with this family.
Oh, look, I'm driving 200 miles per hour.<eos> How did that happen?<eos> Oh, God!<eos> Es la Virgen de Guadalupe!<eos> En mi tortilla!
- Wait, wait, wait.<eos> - Boarding.<eos> - Boarding.<eos> - I'm aboard.<eos> - Aboard.
Stop bein' a asshole.<eos> Don't you dare call me no asshole.<eos> You both are grounded!<eos> - To the hotel?<eos> - You goddamn right, to the hotel.
His boyfriend?<eos> No, his regular friend.<eos> If you keep kicking him, then you and I are gonna have to talk it out.<eos> What are you gonna talk to me about, motherfucker?<eos> My feelings.
She walks to the door and comes back.<eos> Bengü has been with us eight or nine years.<eos> She came here as a kitten... and never left.<eos> Bengü loves to be loved.<eos> Honestly.
I don't want to be involved.<eos> Thank you.<eos> So, why did you do it?<eos> Why does Jonathan Pine, respected hotelier, risk his career by snitching on his guests?<eos> First in Cairo and then here.
Yes, is Sophie there, please?<eos> - Sophie?<eos> No there isn't a...<eos> - Well, when she comes, could you tell her we're all here.<eos> At the same hotel.
You know, I never really thought you had it in you.<eos> You know what I think?<eos> I think you must care very deeply about the person you're protecting.<eos> I saw you look at him.<eos> In the casino.
Who the hell are you?<eos> - I'm Angela...<eos> - I know your name.<eos> I mean, who are you really, in the grand scheme of things?<eos> Oh, in the grand scheme of things?
- Ah, Mr Barghati.<eos> - Sandy.<eos> How good to see you.<eos> Oh, my goodness!<eos> Oh, Lord!
- Sandy.<eos> How good to see you.<eos> Oh, my goodness!<eos> Oh, Lord!<eos> Oh, Lord!
Jed, darling...<eos> Don't even.<eos> Where is everybody?<eos> Monaco.<eos> Two days of meetings.
So what's your tipple?<eos> Men?<eos> Women?<eos> Young?<eos> Old?
What's the Haven?<eos> You were in the army, weren't you?<eos> Iraq.
Sorry for being so late.<eos> My head's in the clouds.<eos> I wanted to know whether... you think it'd be possible to have... a small advance.<eos> I'll let you know.<eos> In the bedroom, kitchen and lounge, like in Paranormal Activity.
You found a job?<eos> No, no.<eos> I'm not in Paris.<eos> I'm on Groix Island.<eos> What island?
The train gets closer, closer... and bam!<eos> The train hits them and they die in their sleep.<eos> Right...<eos> I'll tell you where Simeon is.<eos> On one condition.
Get an ID on the shooter yet?<eos> Nothing.<eos> Zone six is clear.<eos> - Where's zone six?<eos> - In the power plant.
I look out for special interests.<eos> Whose?<eos> In my line of work, discretion is paramount.<eos> The key is to always maintain a presence without letting people know you've been there all along, right over their shoulder.<eos> Every step of the way.
Period.<eos> But they need an out.<eos> It's God's will.<eos> Not a strong believer?<eos> In God?
For your Demascus photos.<eos> There's been a lot of interest in your work.<eos> This says Ann Rutledge.<eos> She bought my photo?<eos> A lot of them, actually.
Next week, I'm gonna take him to the Caicos.<eos> A month of rum and sun is just what this doctor ordered.<eos> And when we get back, you can hook us up, maybe with that thing in Pakistan.<eos> We need to talk.<eos> About what?
Okay, that's a beginning.<eos> I mean, it's really obvious that the two of you love each other, and I think we can build on guacamole.<eos> Kay?<eos> I'm home.<eos> Uh, in the office.
In the future, the line between human and machine is disappearing<eos> Advancements in technology allow humans to enhance themselves with cybernetic parts<eos> Hanka Robotics, funded by the government, is developing a military operative that will blur the line even further<eos> By transplanting a human brain into a fully synthetic body, they will combine the strongest attributes of Human and Robot<eos> PROJECT 2571
Oxygen levels are dropping<eos> Brain function, normal.<eos> Cerebral salvage, ready to proceed<eos> Robotic skeleton, prepared and waiting for brain insertion.<eos> Initiate Project 2571.
Just breathe.<eos> Breathe.<eos> Good.<eos> That's good.<eos> Hello Mira.
Why can't I feel my body?<eos> Mira, your body was damaged, we couldn't save it.<eos> Only your brain survived.<eos> We made you a new body.<eos> A synthetic shell.
You're reducing a complex human to a machine.<eos> I don't think of her as a machine.<eos> She's a weapon.<eos> And the future of my company.<eos> ONE YEAR LATER
And the future of my company.<eos> ONE YEAR LATER<eos> The first artificially created memory enhancement.<eos> Sirenum training protocol is the fastest and most efficient way to develop your ability...<eos> Stronger than ever.
I've heard this speech before from your competitors.<eos> - And now Hanka Robotics serves it... - What are you doing?<eos> Look.<eos> This is what I'm talking about.<eos> Major!
Who sent you?<eos> Help me. Please.<eos> Answer me!<eos> Collaborate with Hanka Robotics and be destroyed.<eos> You okay?
Something's different.<eos> What'd you get?<eos> Why are you always thinking he's out there enhancing.<eos> Because he is.<eos> Cyber mech liver.
Hanka's running scans.<eos> Dr. Dahlin will have the reports ready but...<eos> I've been talking to the Prime Minister.<eos> He wants a full report.<eos> Togusa.
And all were senior figures in Hanka. Just like Osmond.<eos> A message was left at each of the crime scenes by someone identifying himself... as Kuze.<eos> Collaborate with Hanka Robotics and be destroyed.<eos> Collaborate with Hanka Robotics and be destroyed.<eos> Togusa.
Togusa.<eos> You and Ladriya go speak to Mr. Cutter, the CEO of Hanka.<eos> Major and Batou take a look at Dahlin report.<eos> Find out what has been recovered from the geisha.<eos> Major!
- Hey, sweetheart, want an upgrade?<eos> - Move.<eos> - I have anything you want.<eos> - Back off!<eos> - Hey, Ming!
- Move.<eos> - I have anything you want.<eos> - Back off!<eos> - Hey, Ming!<eos> - Hey, Batou!
- Back off!<eos> - Hey, Ming!<eos> - Hey, Batou!<eos> - Got your bones.<eos> - Thanks man.
Don't know.<eos> I like just strays and they like me.<eos> They like you 'cause you feed them.<eos> You got no heart.<eos> Hey, girls!
I like just strays and they like me.<eos> They like you 'cause you feed them.<eos> You got no heart.<eos> Hey, girls!<eos> Hey Gabriel!
You got no heart.<eos> Hey, girls!<eos> Hey Gabriel!<eos> Meet Major.<eos> Major, Gabriel.
You don't talk about that stuff.<eos> What?<eos> - Your past.<eos> - I don't remember much.<eos> Just fragments, bits and pieces.
Your have damaged internal systems.<eos> Maybe next time you can design me better.<eos> - How are you?<eos> - I'm fine. I can't feel anything.<eos> No you, in There.
But they'll pass.<eos> - Have you been taking your medication? - Yeah.<eos> These ones are still cycling.<eos> I had two this morning.<eos> - Sound or image?
- Have you been taking your medication? - Yeah.<eos> These ones are still cycling.<eos> I had two this morning.<eos> - Sound or image?<eos> - Both.
- Both.<eos> I see it.<eos> You made any unencrypted downloads? - No.<eos> Just delete them from me.<eos> - Consent?
I'm not sure.<eos> How do you know what's a glitch and what's me?<eos> The glitches have a different texture... to the rest of your code.<eos> I can see everything.<eos> All of your thoughts, your... decisions.
Then I have to do a deep dive.<eos> You can't encrypt during a deep dive<eos> I know.<eos> They could've left traps in her.<eos> Mag pulses, viruses.
I'll be here when you need me.<eos> - You say your friend worked here?<eos> - I said my friend had work done here.<eos> She's human?<eos> Your friend.
Batou.<eos> Can you hear me?<eos> Who did this stunning work on you?<eos> It's divine.<eos> Ladriya... guns.
Listen.<eos> No signals going in or out.<eos> Major, I'm in position.<eos> Do you copy?<eos> Beer.
Back on comms. I'm heading to the back room.<eos> I missed you.<eos> I'll meet you there.<eos> Collaborate with Hanka Robotics and be destroyed.<eos> Major?
I guess I see like you now.<eos> Don't worry, you'll get used to it.<eos> Thanks for saving my ass.<eos> Glad to see you're okay.<eos> Major?
And Dr. Ouelet informed me that you let her dive a corrupted geisha.<eos> You realize the supreme importance that Hanka represents to this government.<eos> Major is the future of my company.<eos> If you compromise your systems again... I will burn this section.<eos> Yes sir.
You realize the supreme importance that Hanka represents to this government.<eos> Major is the future of my company.<eos> If you compromise your systems again... I will burn this section.<eos> Yes sir.<eos> Mr. Cutter.
Be careful who you the threaten.<eos> I'm accountable to the Prime Minister, not to Hanka.<eos> Create your own beauty.<eos> Beauty enhanced.<eos> You human?
Can you take that off? So I can see your face?<eos> What does that feel like?<eos> It feels... different.<eos> What are you?<eos> SECURE PROJECT 2571
Another Hanka scientist has been found dead.<eos> It's Dahlin.<eos> Got it.<eos> Major this way.<eos> SECURE
It's Dahlin.<eos> Got it.<eos> Major this way.<eos> SECURE<eos> - PROJECT 2571
Don't get me wrong.<eos> I love that kid to pieces. I do.<eos> She's amazing.<eos> But when she practices that thing, it is painful, right?<eos> Why not piano?
It's a tall place, right?<eos> You don't have a child.<eos> You don't have a wife.<eos> You live alone, just you.<eos> - What? No.
The hack must have created a vacuum.<eos> Kuze's wiped his memory... and somehow installed a new reality.<eos> At least he got to believe he had a kid.<eos> What's the difference huh?<eos> Fantasy, reality...
At least he got to believe he had a kid.<eos> What's the difference huh?<eos> Fantasy, reality...<eos> Dreams, memories... it's all the same.<eos> Just noise.
We should uplink to the machine, trace the code, get a lock on his location.<eos> Do it.<eos> Don't go in there.<eos> It's too dangerous.<eos> Major
The machine's tracing his location.<eos> We got a fix!<eos> I need to see her. No Please.<eos> I know..what...<eos> We got'im.
- Go. - On me.<eos> Stay Down!<eos> Stay Down!<eos> Put it down, put it down.<eos> Grenade!
Stay Down!<eos> Stay Down!<eos> Put it down, put it down.<eos> Grenade!<eos> Major!
Defense of self!<eos> More will die... until they tell me what they took.<eos> I won't let that happen.<eos> You want to kill me?<eos> Like everyone else?
Do what you were programmed to do.<eos> What is that?<eos> I c-c-can't remember, but I am haunted by it.<eos> Do You see it?<eos> Togusa!
Your ghost is yours.<eos> Remember that. And maybe you can remember it all.<eos> Get away from her!<eos> Get down on the ground now.<eos> Major!
Remember that. And maybe you can remember it all.<eos> Get away from her!<eos> Get down on the ground now.<eos> Major!<eos> Major!
Get away from her!<eos> Get down on the ground now.<eos> Major!<eos> Major!<eos> Oh, Mira!
How many were there before me?<eos> The integrases of shelling your mind, it had never been done before.<eos> It was inevitable that we will be failures.<eos> How many?<eos> Dozens.
The integrases of shelling your mind, it had never been done before.<eos> It was inevitable that we will be failures.<eos> How many?<eos> Dozens.<eos> How many?
You wouldn't exist if it weren't for those experiments.<eos> Experiments?<eos> - Is that what I am to you?<eos> - No!<eos> No, Mira!
Where did the bodies come from?<eos> Where did I come from?<eos> Mr. Cutter brought them to us.<eos> I didn't ask questions.<eos> The harbor?
Where did I come from?<eos> Mr. Cutter brought them to us.<eos> I didn't ask questions.<eos> The harbor?<eos> My parents?
He had a.. Violent unstable mind.<eos> His cerebral connection wouldn't hold!<eos> - I tried to save him! - No.<eos> You left him to die.<eos> Nothing on Kuze yet, sir.
I just don't like it.<eos> I need you to take me back.<eos> There's more I need to find out.<eos> Sure.<eos> Dr. Ouelet...
I do not consent.<eos> We never needed your consent;<eos> Yours or anyone's.<eos> You're killing me, aren't you?<eos> Mira?
Yours or anyone's.<eos> You're killing me, aren't you?<eos> Mira?<eos> Can you hear me?<eos> Mira?
Mira?<eos> Can you hear me?<eos> Mira?<eos> This is your past, your real past.<eos> - Guards!
We have a Section 9 operative under terrorist programming.<eos> This goes public, your unit goes down.<eos> You kill her, you kill us.<eos> I'll take that under advisement.<eos> So what now?
This goes public, your unit goes down.<eos> You kill her, you kill us.<eos> I'll take that under advisement.<eos> So what now?<eos> Oh, the poor pumpkin!
I was looking for...<eos> No, come in.<eos> Yeah, come come.<eos> - Can I offer you some tea?<eos> - Okay.
I don't know.<eos> Wait, wait, wait!<eos> Will you come again to visit me?<eos> I will.<eos> Aramaki.
We've located Major on the grid.<eos> She's in the lawless zone.<eos> Air support 5 minutes out.<eos> Is the spider tank within range?<eos> Yes sir.
Air support 5 minutes out.<eos> Is the spider tank within range?<eos> Yes sir.<eos> Awaiting your orders sir.<eos> Motoko!
Yes sir.<eos> Awaiting your orders sir.<eos> Motoko!<eos> It is real.<eos> This place.
Cutter and his men.<eos> This is where they took us from.<eos> We used to sleep right here.<eos> We were like a family.<eos> All of us run-aways.
All of us run-aways.<eos> We had nothing... except each other.<eos> They took that from us.<eos> Your name was Hideo.<eos> Motoko.
They took that from us.<eos> Your name was Hideo.<eos> Motoko.<eos> That was your name.<eos> Motoko.
Hey.<eos> Say something nice.<eos> What's your name?<eos> Aramaki told me you had a name from before.<eos> Motoko.
Say something nice.<eos> What's your name?<eos> Aramaki told me you had a name from before.<eos> Motoko.<eos> Major still in there, right?
Aramaki told me you had a name from before.<eos> Motoko.<eos> Major still in there, right?<eos> I am.<eos> Mr. Cutter.
You're accused of murder and crimes against the state.<eos> I thought that it might be you.<eos> It's unwise to resist.<eos> Please.<eos> Major?
We cling to memories as if they define us.<eos> But what we do defines us.<eos> My ghost survived to remind the next of us that humanity is our virtue.<eos> I know who I am. And what I'm here to do.<eos> Major.
You know how I came up with the idea for the Triple-X program?<eos> Skateboards and swimming pools.
It's 7:30 a.m.<eos> It's lunch or dinner-time somewhere in the world.<eos> Come on, eat up!<eos> You know who does feel safe?<eos> The men in charge.
It's lunch or dinner-time somewhere in the world.<eos> Come on, eat up!<eos> You know who does feel safe?<eos> The men in charge.<eos> The world beaters.
Well, that's my pitch.<eos> I always was a better spy than a salesman.<eos> So, what do you say?<eos> I'm not a soldier, I'm a baller.<eos> My bad.
Down on the ground, now!<eos> Give me the money!<eos> Don't move!<eos> Hurry up!<eos> Goal!
One of you is behind this.<eos> And I am not leaving here until I find out who.<eos> You fight me with a book?<eos> Here you go, brother.<eos> Chapter one!
And I am not leaving here until I find out who.<eos> You fight me with a book?<eos> Here you go, brother.<eos> Chapter one!<eos> Page one!
Chapter one!<eos> Page one!<eos> Shit happens.<eos> You're late!<eos> Just in time, boss.
No.<eos> But Gibbons did.<eos> What you doing?<eos> That's loco, chico!<eos> Xander!
The world is big, but always fits in your heart. Always have it with you.<eos> Now, go, go.<eos> Go, go, go.<eos> Of course, Xander Cage can't pay the satellite company, just like a regular guy.<eos> What?
"Don't move, you asshole." "On your knees, you son of a bitch." Which is it?<eos> You have three seconds to comply!<eos> You're not good at this.<eos> One!<eos> Two!
One!<eos> Two!<eos> Okay!<eos> Come on out, Frankenstein!<eos> Gibbons!
Two!<eos> Okay!<eos> Come on out, Frankenstein!<eos> Gibbons!<eos> Gibbons?
Come on out, Frankenstein!<eos> Gibbons!<eos> Gibbons?<eos> Olly-olly-oxen-free.<eos> Wow.
Then the body armor would've been real.<eos> I don't know you, but-- I don't like to be tested.<eos> Gibbons never believed you were dead!<eos> Never stopped looking for you.<eos> Hell of a friend.
I've never seen anything like it.<eos> This group is lethal, and they don't care who or what gets in their way.<eos> I was hoping you'd be interested in headlining the next fight card.<eos> Seventy feet across, 90 feet down.<eos> Three inches of security glass?
Uh, where are you going?<eos> - London. - Why?<eos> What's in London?<eos> A ghost hunter.<eos> And possibly my fur coat.
You know, studies have proven that sexual consummation irrevocably ruins nine out of 10 relationships.<eos> Lucky for me, you love to gamble.<eos> Of course not.<eos> My friends, on the other hand, adore stiff odds.<eos> Stiff odds?
I can't guarantee it won't walk off on its own.<eos> Wheels up in 10, boys!<eos> Which means you're already seven minutes behind.<eos> Is she always this much fun, or just on special occasions?<eos> Wow.
No wonder our country's in debt trillions of dollars.<eos> Do you really need all these gadgets to get the bad guys?<eos> Oh, we don't need any of it.<eos> But it makes the catching a hell of a lot more fun.<eos> Xander Cage.
Do you really need all these gadgets to get the bad guys?<eos> Oh, we don't need any of it.<eos> But it makes the catching a hell of a lot more fun.<eos> Xander Cage.<eos> Holy shit!
This is crazy!<eos> I was at Coachella and Guns N' Roses got back together, but this is way cooler.<eos> Well, I wasn't actually there, but I, like, heard about it, you know?<eos> I'm still talking.<eos> Oh, my God.
I get started and then I can't stop and then I can't--<eos> Breathe.<eos> Take your time.<eos> I know mouth-to-mouth if necessary.<eos> Wow.
- Oh, come on. - I'm kidding.<eos> It's not like I have a safe word, or anything.<eos> It's "kumquat."<eos> Never really think about it.<eos> Kumquat.
Never really think about it.<eos> Kumquat.<eos> What about you?<eos> No. "Safe" isn't in my vocabulary.<eos> Touche.
You are Xander Cage.<eos> Anything you need, Becky can source it within the hour.<eos> Except for any sort of illegal drugs.<eos> Those, I'll have within 15 minutes.<eos> Kidding.
Okay, Cage, follow me.<eos> I'll introduce you to your ground team.<eos> - Thank you, Becky.<eos> - Of course.<eos> Kumquat.
- Of course.<eos> Kumquat.<eos> Hey, here comes the Red Bull freak show.<eos> Xander Cage, I want you to meet Paul-- Donovan.<eos> Captain Paul Donovan.
That must have been pretty cool, right?<eos> You guys must have some seriously cool stories to tell.<eos> Must've seen a lot.<eos> I wonder, how many of you have ever pulled a freestyle triple back-flip on a BMX bike before?<eos> All of you?
We don't play on bikes.<eos> Oh, you don't play on bikes.<eos> Any of you ever carve an R4 on a snowboard while an avalanche is on your booty?<eos> We're soldiers, hotshot.<eos> Not slackers.
I'm not gonna have clowns watch my back.<eos> I know I'm gonna regret asking you this, but who would you trust?<eos> You know, no one has this number.<eos> So, what are you up to these days?<eos> Me?
Get on the car, now!<eos> It was like that when I got here.<eos> Nobody gets in unless you're an X-Game participant! You hear me?<eos> That guy got through.<eos> Wassup, Nyjah?
It was like that when I got here.<eos> Nobody gets in unless you're an X-Game participant! You hear me?<eos> That guy got through.<eos> Wassup, Nyjah?<eos> Lightning-bolt and Burrito.
Nobody gets in unless you're an X-Game participant! You hear me?<eos> That guy got through.<eos> Wassup, Nyjah?<eos> Lightning-bolt and Burrito.<eos> Chad, wassup, bro?
That guy got through.<eos> Wassup, Nyjah?<eos> Lightning-bolt and Burrito.<eos> Chad, wassup, bro?<eos> Roberta.
Roberta.<eos> I'll see you later.<eos> Show him the love!<eos> Give it up for The Hood!<eos> The good, the bad, the extreme, and the completely insane.
But I will make sure to keep you safe.<eos> It ain't easy to keep me safe.<eos> Yeah, these bad boys are my favorite, too.<eos> They're called exo-gloves.<eos> DARPA's new ground combat initiative.
It's very, very breakable.<eos> Can you tell me the real reason behind the crash of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie?<eos> - Yes. - Ah.<eos> You're one of them, aren't you?<eos> Easy there, Rocky.
That's refreshing.<eos> You actually know what you're doing down there.<eos> Yeah.<eos> That's what she said.<eos> Wow.
You need something, man?<eos> Well, I heard this is a perfect place to disappear for a few days for my crew, no questions asked.<eos> Hey, Mi casa es su casa, if the price is right.<eos> Perfect.<eos> Tennyson!
All right.<eos> Enjoy this party.<eos> I like your style, man.<eos> Stay on that boat, no matter what.<eos> Adele, Nicks!
- Thank you.<eos> - You're welcome.<eos> Stay focused.<eos> Really?<eos> Xander Cage.
Really?<eos> Xander Cage.<eos> Back in action.<eos> Did I ever leave?<eos> Shit.
Drinks all around.<eos> That's him.<eos> What do you know?<eos> It's douchebag hunting season.<eos> My favorite.
Either way, somebody's getting burnt up tonight!<eos> I told you he was fun to have around.<eos> At first, I thought Special Forces.<eos> But your ink's all wrong.<eos> CIA?
At first, I thought Special Forces.<eos> But your ink's all wrong.<eos> CIA?<eos> They would send in a drone, bomb us to hell.<eos> MI6?
A little tremble would be nice.<eos> Well, considering you're one tremble away from limping out of here I'd say I'm close enough.<eos> Does this mean you're not making me breakfast in the morning?<eos> I'd say you're a couple inches off.<eos> Bit of a stalemate.
Bit of a stalemate.<eos> Not if you drop the gun.<eos> I'm not the bad guy.<eos> I don't believe in good guys.<eos> Serena?
Who's that guy?<eos> We just met.<eos> But we were getting along famously until somebody decided to interrupt.<eos> Stick to the path.<eos> Here, honey.
Unless you want to continue our foreplay.<eos> Power like that doesn't belong in anyone's hands.<eos> Just improvising.<eos> Mate, seriously?<eos> A grenade?
Can I have my jacket, when you get a sec?<eos> Then a man comes along, tells me a story about a drought in California.<eos> About skateboards and swimming pools.<eos> About a man named Xander Cage.<eos> Oh, shit.
Shit's about to go down.<eos> You ready to have some fun?<eos> What are you waiting? Stop the music! Quickly--<eos> Stop it!<eos> Everybody, hands up!
You ready to have some fun?<eos> What are you waiting? Stop the music! Quickly--<eos> Stop it!<eos> Everybody, hands up!<eos> Now!
'Cause like I said, if you take this from me, you die first.<eos> I'll take it from you dead or alive.<eos> And if you hold it too tight, I cut your arm off.<eos> Suit yourself.<eos> Leningrad.
I'll take it from you dead or alive.<eos> And if you hold it too tight, I cut your arm off.<eos> Suit yourself.<eos> Leningrad.<eos> Hi, Ivan.
And if you hold it too tight, I cut your arm off.<eos> Suit yourself.<eos> Leningrad.<eos> Hi, Ivan.<eos> Other Ivan.
Other Ivan.<eos> Ooh, bye-bye, Moscow Mule.<eos> That's another one you owe me, X.<eos> Read between the lines.<eos> Tennyson!
It happened again.<eos> Another satellite fell.<eos> Us working as a team.<eos> That's what Gibbons would've wanted.<eos> You in?
But how often do these seven men all sit in the same room together?<eos> Almost never.<eos> And if you needed retinal scans, cell phone data dumps, biometrics of all the superpowers in the world--<eos> Who would you target?<eos> Oh, shit.
Oh, shit.<eos> Who has that kind of power to actually set that in motion?<eos> Oh, you're pissing up the wrong tree, Cage.<eos> I came looking for you, remember?<eos> Yo, asshole.
Oh, no problem.<eos> How was your trip?<eos> I'm just doing the math.<eos> Oh, yeah?<eos> What math?
Air velocity divided by distance.<eos> So, when I stuff you down the toilet, search and rescue will know where to find you between China and North Korea.<eos> Keep talking shit, little man.<eos> Hold that thought, G.I. Joe.<eos> Wow.
Keep talking shit, little man.<eos> Hold that thought, G.I. Joe.<eos> Wow.<eos> Roll it back.<eos> A little more.
Hold that thought, G.I. Joe.<eos> Wow.<eos> Roll it back.<eos> A little more.<eos> More.
Wow.<eos> Roll it back.<eos> A little more.<eos> More.<eos> A little more.
Yeah, whatever, bro.<eos> ...do you think that counts as crash 199 for me?<eos> You know, officially?<eos> Officially, you're deranged.<eos> Cool.
Officially, you're deranged.<eos> Cool.<eos> We'll set up a triangulated signal tracking system around the city.<eos> And when Becky locks in his exact location, we make our move.<eos> What about you?
Gibbons to the rescue.<eos> He said a lion like me doesn't belong in any kind of cage.<eos> I got mine after I left the NSA.<eos> What about that one on your wrist?<eos> London.
What about that one on your wrist?<eos> London.<eos> 2009.<eos> I climbed the Millennium Wheel.<eos> Naked.
- Yeah.<eos> High school.<eos> Oh, no!<eos> We all have our embarrassing moments.<eos> What about that sexy one?
High school.<eos> Oh, no!<eos> We all have our embarrassing moments.<eos> What about that sexy one?<eos> This?
I'm showing activity in Pandora's Box.<eos> I can jam the signal, but only for a few minutes, so hurry.<eos> You've got to get there fast and take this guy down.<eos> Not if we find him first.<eos> Whoa! Red light!
I can jam the signal, but only for a few minutes, so hurry.<eos> You've got to get there fast and take this guy down.<eos> Not if we find him first.<eos> Whoa! Red light!<eos> Red light!
- Welcome to the moment. - Whoa, whoa, whoa--<eos> Everyone needs backup.<eos> Stop, stop, stop, stop!<eos> Stop, stop, stop, stop!<eos> Tennyson?
Go, go, go!<eos> Out of the car! Get out!<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Let's go!<eos> Wow.
Out of the car! Get out!<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Let's go!<eos> Wow.<eos> Shit.
Guys, I can only jam the signal for so long before he chooses another satellite. You have to hurry.<eos> I have a plan.<eos> Hold on!<eos> "Hold on" ain't no goddamn plan!<eos> Hi.
No, no, no... Xander, you got to get to the top floor.<eos> He's trying to engage another satellite.<eos> Hurry.<eos> Fish in a barrel.<eos> Forty-five U.S.P.
Fish in a barrel.<eos> Forty-five U.S.P.<eos> Twelve round mag.<eos> Five left.<eos> Three.
He's turned the heat up.<eos> I can't see shit.<eos> X, can't see you guys.<eos> Thermal's no good.<eos> - Right?
Easy.<eos> X, keep Chatty Cathy talking.<eos> I still don't have a shot.<eos> We made it that way.<eos> People like Gibbons and the two of you. And me.
What the hell are you talking about?<eos> I'm serious.<eos> What the hell's wrong with you?<eos> Right there.<eos> Nice shot.
Nice shot.<eos> Was there ever a doubt?<eos> Uh, yeah, I confess, I had my doubts.<eos> That's for talking shit about my friend, Gibbons.<eos> Xiang!
That's for talking shit about my friend, Gibbons.<eos> Xiang!<eos> Get on your knees!<eos> On your knees!<eos> Hands!
Xiang!<eos> Get on your knees!<eos> On your knees!<eos> Hands!<eos> Hands!
Oh, and, Serena, if you don't hear from me, remember, dial nine.<eos> X takes care of its own.<eos> You gave it back to Marke, didn't you?<eos> Nice place.<eos> Spacious.
X takes care of its own.<eos> You gave it back to Marke, didn't you?<eos> Nice place.<eos> Spacious.<eos> Expensive.
It's just never a good idea to point a gun at me.<eos> Hey, are NSA extraction teams normally armed like they're invading Fallujah?<eos> No, generally not.<eos> Watch the boys.<eos> Shit.
You and your entire team were lost in the blast along with the device itself.<eos> If the world thinks Pandora's Box is gone, then they won't know we're using it to spy on them.<eos> You're just another tyrant.<eos> No.<eos> Patriot.
You're just another tyrant.<eos> No.<eos> Patriot.<eos> Let me educate you on the difference.<eos> Xander!
No.<eos> Patriot.<eos> Let me educate you on the difference.<eos> Xander!<eos> Xander!
They say it's the last great adventure, Cage.<eos> Be sure and send a postcard.<eos> - Engines hot!<eos> - Let's go!<eos> Xander!
Be sure and send a postcard.<eos> - Engines hot!<eos> - Let's go!<eos> Xander!<eos> Xander Cage!
Find cover!<eos> Move!<eos> Get behind there!<eos> There, take cover! Okay, okay.<eos> What a rush.
Hey.<eos> I told you you got no manners.<eos> Did your mother ever teach you how to zip up your pants?<eos> Well?<eos> Serena.
I go low.<eos> I'll go high.<eos> See if I can't find G.I. Joe.<eos> Are you getting this interference?<eos> Shit.
Shit.<eos> Everyone needs backup, right?<eos> Yeah, I guess.<eos> Let's do this.<eos> Nicks!
- No!<eos> No, no, no!<eos> Listen!<eos> From now on, I make the plans, you execute!<eos> Oh, shit.
What's wrong, hotshot?<eos> No witty comeback?<eos> I just finally figured out that math problem.<eos> It's gonna take two flushes.<eos> Oh, shit.
Nothing.<eos> I'm empty.<eos> - We go on three.<eos> Wassup?<eos> Rock, paper, scissor, grenade launcher.
I'm empty.<eos> - We go on three.<eos> Wassup?<eos> Rock, paper, scissor, grenade launcher.<eos> Darius Stone.
Low-orbit freefall, no chute and big fireworks.<eos> They say it's the last great adventure.<eos> Be sure to send a postcard.<eos> I live for this shit.<eos> Shit.
The whole world gonna be looking for us.<eos> I wouldn't have it any other way.<eos> We thought we'd end with Augustus' favorite song.<eos> Wow, that's an impressive trick.<eos> What?
I love that song.<eos> And it could be a wonderful world, if we just stopped doing bad shit to it.<eos> If you wanted me out of retirement, you could've just asked me.<eos> You always responded to less subtle motivation.<eos> Now what?
Shit!<eos> Shit!
Oh, let's see how the wedding goes first.<eos> You got a letter from someone.<eos> I'm pretty surprised about it.<eos> I didn't know you knew anyone in the free world.<eos> Good boy!
I didn't know you knew anyone in the free world.<eos> Good boy!<eos> Why, thank you, Ringo.<eos> Oh, my!<eos> Oh, Ringo!
I, Francie take you, Douglas, as you are to love and to cherish to have and to hold until death do us part.<eos> Frances Millner, Douglas Grotsky, take hands.<eos> You may now kiss as husband and wife.<eos> Two miles later, we're almost there.<eos> Hi.
You may now kiss as husband and wife.<eos> Two miles later, we're almost there.<eos> Hi.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Shit.
Shit.<eos> You look good, ladies.<eos> Right here.<eos> I'll see you in there.<eos> Hi. Hey.
Hi. Hey.<eos> You're here.<eos> That's c...<eos> Why are you here?<eos> Same as you.
Okay.<eos> So it's not the same at all.<eos> Oh, my God, just...<eos> Have fun!<eos> Oh, shit.
Whether you get a girl to smile or whether she runs away, it's all good.<eos> Gotta go, someone's here.<eos> Hello.<eos> I'm Francie Millner's first nanny,<eos> Jo Flanagan.
Thank you.<eos> I'm working on that.<eos> Hi.<eos> Bina and Jerry Kepp, hello.<eos> Oh, Jesus Christ.
I'm working on that.<eos> Hi.<eos> Bina and Jerry Kepp, hello.<eos> Oh, Jesus Christ.<eos> Walter.
Hi.<eos> Bina and Jerry Kepp, hello.<eos> Oh, Jesus Christ.<eos> Walter.<eos> Hello, Roger.
Francie did.<eos> Okay.<eos> I honestly thought they wouldn't let you travel out of state.<eos> Well, you know.<eos> Hello!
I don't think we've ever been at a reception table with a nanny before.<eos> Have we, Jerry?<eos> Only very good or very bad nannies are remembered so many years later.<eos> Which one are you?<eos> You guys swingers?
Yes, it is.<eos> No, it isn't.<eos> Well, we'll see.<eos> Okay.<eos> Hello.
Yeah.<eos> No one's...<eos> My name is Walter.<eos> I can tell by your accent you must be a relation to the bride's father.<eos> Close relation?
Sorry, do I know you?<eos> Do you mind if I say something else?<eos> I'm gonna say something else.<eos> Nobody deserves a full minute of your attention unless they're giving it back to you.<eos> Oh. Smile!
Yeah, well, it was like that.<eos> Also, in order for you to know that I'd been staring at someone for a real, true minute, you had to be staring at me for a real, true minute.<eos> Also, that was a test. Which I passed.<eos> My ex-boyfriend is in there.<eos> And I...
Yeah, me neither.<eos> Okay.<eos> Okay.<eos> Not that you asked, but this is where I'm sitting so if you end up in the high teens, you know where to find me.<eos> Shit!
Okay.<eos> Okay.<eos> Not that you asked, but this is where I'm sitting so if you end up in the high teens, you know where to find me.<eos> Shit!<eos> Oh, shit.
Shit!<eos> Oh, shit.<eos> Are you feeling all right?<eos> What do you say your name is?<eos> Megan-Ann.
Oh, shit.<eos> Are you feeling all right?<eos> What do you say your name is?<eos> Megan-Ann.<eos> Megan-Ann. Okay.
Yes.<eos> Who doesn't love to read books?<eos> I do, as a normal person.<eos> What's your favorite book, Walter?<eos> Probably that one.
Today will not suck.<eos> Your nails are orange and your hair is orange.<eos> And your dress is orange.<eos> I say it's too much orange.<eos> Too much orange?
That's what I was saying, so you have to lose one of them. I meant the dress.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Where are you from?<eos> Hi.<eos> Hellomygod.
Oh, my God.<eos> Where are you from?<eos> Hi.<eos> Hellomygod.<eos> - Okay. Hi.
Where are you from?<eos> Hi.<eos> Hellomygod.<eos> - Okay. Hi.<eos> - Hi!
I'm Walter, I'm a successful businessman and I've also reached puberty.<eos> Well, terrific.<eos> I'm Eloise.<eos> So far, it's my mom on bass and me on lyrics, but it's pretty cool.<eos> Very cool.
You're the nanny. Francie's nanny.<eos> How do you know that?<eos> And you know Henry Grotsky from the diner scene, you're those people...<eos> Jesus, not the Klumps.<eos> Wow.
And you know Henry Grotsky from the diner scene, you're those people...<eos> Jesus, not the Klumps.<eos> Wow.<eos> The Kepps.<eos> - Bina and Jerry Kepp.
So, Francie, today's bride, is my oldest friend.<eos> Oh... Thank you!<eos> There's been a long discussion about what kind of table this is and you've just resolved it!<eos> She is the best friend of the bride.<eos> Well, oldest.
So when I find that something doesn't add up, I investigate.<eos> Can't help being a detective, it's just who I am.<eos> And you want to know what rank on the force my husband has attained?<eos> He manages a diner in Columbus, Ohio.<eos> That rank.
And you want to know what rank on the force my husband has attained?<eos> He manages a diner in Columbus, Ohio.<eos> That rank.<eos> Fill us in anyway, would you, on how exactly the bride's best friend ended up back here with the Klumps.<eos> Oldest friend.
I got dumped by Francie's brother, Teddy Millner, the best man.<eos> That tall drink of shit over there at table one you can barely see.<eos> God, look at him.<eos> That guy is exactly who you think he'd be.<eos> Yeah, just a selfish jerk.
Come on, El, please don't go all crazy.<eos> "All crazy"? Now what does that mean?<eos> It means you get mad.<eos> You do something big and you can't take it back and it's too late, and then...<eos> Crazy.
Yeah?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Before you ruin all this for Francie.<eos> I don't have a ferry ticket till tomorrow, anyway.<eos> Swim.
Why?<eos> I will give you 20 unhypothetical dollars if you stand up right now.<eos> All right, then.<eos> Okay?<eos> What?
I will give you 20 unhypothetical dollars if you stand up right now.<eos> All right, then.<eos> Okay?<eos> What?<eos> Honey.
All right, then.<eos> Okay?<eos> What?<eos> Honey.<eos> Shit.
I fit into this family.<eos> You never did.<eos> I was Francie's first choice for maid of honor.<eos> I was Teddy's first choice for a girlfriend.<eos> Sometimes, first sticks.
Make use of the jacket and grab us a cheese plate, would you?<eos> That's funny. Last week, I did a search history on our computer.<eos> And one of us looked up "Topless Dame Helen Mirren."<eos> Wasn't me.<eos> M-I-R-R-E-N.
You answered with a question.<eos> Why are you looking at my Facebook?<eos> Actually, with Henry Grotsky and Tom Fo.<eos> Okay.<eos> Tom Fo?
Well, Henry Grotsky owns five diners in Central Ohio.<eos> We own a diner in Central Ohio.<eos> Everyone who owns a diner in Central Ohio is Facebook friends.<eos> You'd know that if you paid attention.<eos> Tom Fo.
You'd know that if you paid attention.<eos> Tom Fo.<eos> Okay.<eos> Am I Facebook friends with Tom Fo, really, Jerry? Okay.<eos> All right.
Bina lost her virginity to a loser immigrant named Tom Fo.<eos> He was from Canada.<eos> From the province of Canada that produces the most insufferable people.<eos> That's not true.<eos> Manitoba.
Great, I'll friend my first love now.<eos> Helen Mirren will be thrilled.<eos> Renzo, pick up the phone.<eos> Renzo, pick up...<eos> Not now, big fight.
How could the person who did the table assignments have no one else here?<eos> I planned half the wedding.<eos> Okay.<eos> Table one is Francie, Doug and everyone who actually matters including Teddy Millner, the best man-child and Nikki Carmichael, the second-choice maid of honor.<eos> Table two, Francie's hideous dad... Roger?
What's happening now?<eos> Four, Doug's kooky college friends.<eos> Five, grandparents, no comment.<eos> Six, Doug's dad's military buddies.<eos> Seven, decent cousins.
The hell are we doing back here?<eos> 15 are the wedding hires including the reverend, the hairdresser, the hairdresser's colorist.<eos> And then there's three more tables until you get back here.<eos> Do you know what Francie's mother calls this table?<eos> Enough.
I gave her, her favorite toy in the world.<eos> A golden bird that she so loved, I bet she still has it now.<eos> Does that sound like a person they would put at a table of people they don't care about?<eos> It sounds like someone who was invited to a wedding because Francie's mother found out she was paying $200 a plate for the groom's nanny and wanted to settle the score.<eos> Oh, and me too.
I'm the best man.<eos> Maid of honor.<eos> Welcome for their first dance Mr. and Mrs. Douglas Grotsky!<eos> Get this party started!<eos> Hi.
Mr. Pfaffler? May I have a word with your daughter?<eos> Oh, this is not my daughter.<eos> She's just my tablemate today.<eos> Can I ask what her name is?<eos> Megan-Ann.
I thought we were gonna be murdered there for a second.<eos> Oh, my God, the lighting in here is brutal!<eos> God!<eos> My dance number is next and I cannot look like my hair just got humped by a hurricane.<eos> Hello, Carol.
Hello, Carol.<eos> I must look very different to you since the last time we saw each other.<eos> O-M-G! Oh!<eos> That's mortifying that I would forget.<eos> Nanny Jo.
Ever heard of a guy named Donny Haczyk?<eos> Yes.<eos> He's a knobhead.<eos> - He's a what?<eos> - A knobhead.
Yes.<eos> He's a knobhead.<eos> - He's a what?<eos> - A knobhead.<eos> Like a dickhead.
Why can't I just be here to reminisce on the early days of Bina and Jerry?<eos> Please.<eos> I give up.<eos> Where's Mr. Manny?<eos> Mr. Manny?
- What are we doing?<eos> - We're dancing.<eos> And also?<eos> Maybe making somebody jealous.<eos> Sorry.
How did I not just get kissed?<eos> It happens more often than you think.<eos> Uh... I'm Eloise, by the way.<eos> Who are you?<eos> Huck.
It happens more often than you think.<eos> Uh... I'm Eloise, by the way.<eos> Who are you?<eos> Huck.<eos> Huck?
I'm at the very worst one.<eos> Would you care to join me?<eos> I shouldn't.<eos> Sure.<eos> Oh, seriously?
Yeah, that's why people come to weddings. For free food.<eos> Oh, is that so?<eos> Yeah.<eos> And to meet somebody.<eos> Hello? Hello? Hey, everybody.
Save me, please.<eos> I don't know what I'm saying anymore.<eos> Maid of honor toast time!<eos> Let's go.<eos> What?
Can everybody just get out of here, please?<eos> So what do we do?<eos> What do you mean, "What do we do?"<eos> To teach that asshole a lesson.<eos> Oh, Lord.
Teddy Millner is leaving you to raise a child alone.<eos> If you even go...<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> If you even go through with the pregnancy.<eos> Okay, no.
I'm fine.<eos> Please get lost. Excuse me.<eos> Hello.<eos> Jerry Kepp. Diner associate on the Grotsky side.<eos> Hello.
You didn't tell them what you said.<eos> Wait, what did you say?<eos> What did I say?<eos> She said that we'd be ridiculous parents.<eos> No, I...
I'm ridiculous in a million ways.<eos> I am.<eos> I know that.<eos> But I can't spend my whole life disappointing you as much as I disappoint myself.<eos> Shit.
But I can't spend my whole life disappointing you as much as I disappoint myself.<eos> Shit.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Hey, stop.<eos> Teddy!
I'm sorry.<eos> Hey, stop.<eos> Teddy!<eos> Stop!<eos> Teddy!
Teddy!<eos> Stop!<eos> Teddy!<eos> Leave me alone.<eos> No, Teddy!
No, Teddy!<eos> No, he doesn't get...<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> No, we can fix this. We can fix this.<eos> No, Teddy.
No, we can fix this. We can fix this.<eos> No, Teddy.<eos> Oh! I'm sorry.<eos> I've been hit.<eos> - Shit.
Oh! I'm sorry.<eos> I've been hit.<eos> - Shit.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Oh, shit.
You two can drop by and choose something from the mini fridge.<eos> That was the worst invitation to anything I've ever received, ever.<eos> Is your room this way?<eos> Or are you just following us?<eos> Who, me?
No.<eos> I don't know, unless Uncle Roger is lurking around outside the door, I mean...<eos> Is it Uncle Roger?<eos> Nope.<eos> Hi.
No.<eos> You know, a whole table disappeared from a wedding and I bet no one even knows.<eos> We can go anywhere, do anything.<eos> The day is ours.<eos> Hello.
Hi.<eos> Um, can you tell me when the next ferry arrives?<eos> In about 30 minutes.<eos> Okay.<eos> Thanks.
No.<eos> Because it turned out she wasn't as sick as we thought.<eos> On account of the fact she didn't exist.<eos> I don't think he'd ever been married.<eos> What?
You just called him a sweetheart!<eos> He was a lovely bloke.<eos> He was always nice to me.<eos> Except for when he made me go to prison.<eos> Renzo.
He was a lovely bloke.<eos> He was always nice to me.<eos> Except for when he made me go to prison.<eos> Renzo.<eos> Yeah, what?
It's pretty dumb.<eos> No, come on.<eos> Yeah, it is. It is.<eos> My mom believed it would ever so slightly convey my sexual prowess.<eos> Clonk.
And then the spell was cast<eos> Now here we are in heaven<eos> 'Cause you are mine<eos> At last<eos> Fuck.
At last<eos> Fuck.<eos> Here, Ringo!<eos> Here, Ringo. Wonder how my daughter's gonna feel not having a dad?<eos> Daughter?
I should go back in.<eos> Tell Francie about the cake.<eos> Let's sit out for a little while.<eos> The world feels almost perfect right now.<eos> Crap!
You don't out-detective me, Bina Kepp.<eos> I came to have an affair.<eos> No way.<eos> I know you.<eos> Bina, an affair?
I came to have an affair.<eos> No way.<eos> I know you.<eos> Bina, an affair?<eos> Bina!
I should just let you know that I've got a little bit of eczema behind my knees.<eos> And, um, oh, last year I had a cold sore, but that was because Jalapeno was using my washcloth.<eos> And not just on his face.<eos> But, yeah, otherwise, I'm all fine so just let me know when you want to start the intercourse.<eos> What?
And, um, oh, last year I had a cold sore, but that was because Jalapeno was using my washcloth.<eos> And not just on his face.<eos> But, yeah, otherwise, I'm all fine so just let me know when you want to start the intercourse.<eos> What?<eos> What?
No?<eos> Was it talking about Jalapeno washing his testicles that ruined the mood? Um...<eos> Sure.<eos> How bad is it?<eos> Pot.
Did you have a chance to ask the thing I sent you over there for?<eos> Oh, yes.<eos> Denny, who's that man there, he said that there's no one registered under the name you asked about.<eos> Did you say the right name?<eos> Yeah, Denny.
Did you say the right name?<eos> Yeah, Denny.<eos> It's on his nametag. I saw it.<eos> Right. Not him.<eos> Oh, Fo, yes.
No Fo.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Sorry.<eos> God, that's so weird.<eos> Walter?
Even if it's something very private?<eos> My understanding of women seems poor right now.<eos> I'd say go with your gut.<eos> Francie doesn't even remember me, does she?<eos> Ah, those rotten kids.
Let's just watch the kid in his moment of triumph.<eos> There is something I forgot to mention the first time I arrived here, and that is that I have a gigantic penis.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> Oh, shit.
That's disgusting.<eos> This wedding is over for you.<eos> I need you to give me the phone number of somebody that I can call to get you out of here right now. Oh!<eos> So... Mr. Pfaffler said he's gonna call my mom.<eos> And the girl?
She started to cry.<eos> I think I didn't describe it appealingly.<eos> We'll work on the wording before you try again.<eos> You're coming with me.<eos> Hello, friend.
Just stay right there.<eos> Is this the guy you meant?<eos> Nope.<eos> I'm pregnant with his baby, but not the guy I'm looking for.<eos> Wow.
Nope.<eos> I'm pregnant with his baby, but not the guy I'm looking for.<eos> Wow.<eos> One cigarette break and you miss an awful lot, right?<eos> This guy?
I'm pregnant with his baby, but not the guy I'm looking for.<eos> Wow.<eos> One cigarette break and you miss an awful lot, right?<eos> This guy?<eos> That guy, this guy.
Huck something.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I know who that guy is, but his name is not Huck.<eos> No one's really named Huck anymore.<eos> Oh, shit.
Right.<eos> Okay, let's go.<eos> Come on!<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, baby
Come on!<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, baby<eos> Nice bit of cake?<eos> Oh, Nanny Jo, everybody...
Well, that's not what I thought I'd leave with here today, but it's something, so thank you.<eos> Sure.<eos> We hope it all works out for you.<eos> It'd be great if it did.<eos> Cousin Walter?
Cousin Walter?<eos> I'm glad you could come.<eos> Thank you for inviting me.<eos> It was simply amazing.<eos> Truly wonderful day.
Oh, thank you.<eos> He's such a great guy.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Sorry about being so far away from you today.<eos> No.
You look so beautiful.<eos> Thank you.<eos> And congratulations or best wishes or whatever you're supposed to say.<eos> And this was great.<eos> Bye, guys.
I don't know how you fixed this, but it really meant a lot.<eos> Well, it's been so great to catch up with you all.<eos> I hope you all got to dance to your heart's content.<eos> Do you still have the golden bird?<eos> Oh, Nanny Jo.
It wouldn't have been the same without you.<eos> Please proceed to the docks to see off Mr. and Mrs. Douglas Grotsky.<eos> What is it with you people?<eos> Teddy Millner is the sweetest child I've ever known.<eos> - Teddy!
Please proceed to the docks to see off Mr. and Mrs. Douglas Grotsky.<eos> What is it with you people?<eos> Teddy Millner is the sweetest child I've ever known.<eos> - Teddy!<eos> - Teddy!
- Teddy!<eos> - Teddy!<eos> I don't see him.<eos> Did he get on?<eos> Teddy!
- Teddy!<eos> I don't see him.<eos> Did he get on?<eos> Teddy!<eos> Teddy!
I don't see him.<eos> Did he get on?<eos> Teddy!<eos> Teddy!<eos> Teddy!
Wait!<eos> Too late!<eos> Sorry!<eos> I was wrong!<eos> What?
It's crazy! After everything.<eos> Sweetheart, you're embarrassing yourself!<eos> Shut up, Nikki!<eos> Shut up.<eos> What?
What?<eos> I can't not be in love with you.<eos> You screw up all the time.<eos> But so do I. Way worse!<eos> Great toast, folks!
The baby is a...<eos> Wait, what baby?<eos> It's a great screwup!<eos> It's this perfect screwup!<eos> What?
No, I'm the same.<eos> No, not really.<eos> The Bina I married would never cheat on me.<eos> Well, the Jerry I married...<eos> What?
No, not really.<eos> The Bina I married would never cheat on me.<eos> Well, the Jerry I married...<eos> What?<eos> What?
Is that what life is?<eos> Yeah, it is.<eos> And it's really weird that you don't know that by now!<eos> Where are we?<eos> Guys?
Well, I didn't word it right.<eos> No, you're okay.<eos> Congratulations.<eos> Hey, I got these.<eos> Room 430.
Maybe in a couple of years.<eos> Wait, really?<eos> Okay, it's booked.<eos> A few years from now.<eos> Room 430.
Room 430.<eos> I'll be there!<eos> I'll see you in a couple of years!<eos> Yes!<eos> Hey.
Oh. Then, yeah.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Is it good?<eos> Yeah, really good.<eos> Oh, shit.
Is it good?<eos> Yeah, really good.<eos> Oh, shit.<eos> What did you say?<eos> Oh, my Lord!
Can we do that?<eos> Let's do that.<eos> Goodnight, Mom.<eos> Goodnight, Teddy.<eos> Bye, Carol.
Bye, Carol.<eos> Thought you didn't have family.<eos> The evidence is mounting up against you, Walter.<eos> Renzo, your study buddy is here!<eos> Hey.
The evidence is mounting up against you, Walter.<eos> Renzo, your study buddy is here!<eos> Hey.<eos> Here's your mail.<eos> Thanks.
Renzo, your study buddy is here!<eos> Hey.<eos> Here's your mail.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Hi.
Here's your mail.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Hi.<eos> Please don't slam the door, even for that.<eos> Ringo?
Here you go, Ringo.<eos> Okay, you're sure you didn't forget anybody?<eos> I told you a million times, okay?<eos> I didn't forget anybody.<eos> Sorry.
Thank you.<eos> You're welcome.<eos> Okay, so this is the last batch of...<eos> Teddy, where's the baby?<eos> Baby.
Oh, man!<eos> Come on, man.<eos> I know, I'm sorry.<eos> It's just, you know, if you forget the baby... I'm not sure I believe you when you say you didn't forget any of our friends.<eos> Hi!
Sure, pal.<eos> Just bigger and browner.<eos> - All right, boys, get him in.<eos> - Have a good run, Mitch.<eos> All right, Steph.
You think I'm gonna forget that?<eos> All right. Well, listen, tomorrow make my pecs a little bigger.<eos> And don't cover up my front bump.<eos> You got it.<eos> Huge dick.
All right. Well, listen, tomorrow make my pecs a little bigger.<eos> And don't cover up my front bump.<eos> You got it.<eos> Huge dick.<eos> Big dick.
And don't cover up my front bump.<eos> You got it.<eos> Huge dick.<eos> Big dick.<eos> - Yo, Ellerbee. - Hey, Mitch.
No!<eos> You're looking big.<eos> I don't know how you fit in that uniform, man.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> - Hey, hey!
He saved my nana's life.<eos> I ever tell you about that?<eos> Every time he jogs by.<eos> Literally, every single time.<eos> Hi, Mitch.
I ever tell you about that?<eos> Every time he jogs by.<eos> Literally, every single time.<eos> Hi, Mitch.<eos> Flakka.
Every time he jogs by.<eos> Literally, every single time.<eos> Hi, Mitch.<eos> Flakka.<eos> Jesus.
Hi, Mitch.<eos> Flakka.<eos> Jesus.<eos> Hey, what's up, buddy?<eos> - Hey, Mitch.
That's not nice.<eos> - There are killer waves, boys.<eos> Go shred.<eos> - It's on.<eos> - Later, Mitch.
- Later, Mitch.<eos> - All right, brah.<eos> You don't want to do that, big dog.<eos> I'm an animal lover, but I will put you down.<eos> Frankie!
Kinda feel like this is your year.<eos> Stop that.<eos> Okay.<eos> Well, I'll see you at tryouts.<eos> All right, C.J.
All right, C.J.<eos> That was amazing to watch.<eos> She came up to you, she was very nice and warm.<eos> And you handled it really smoothly.<eos> - Really?
- Really?<eos> - Fuck, no.<eos> That was awkward.<eos> - It was horrible.<eos> - Fuck!
It felt like you had a stroke.<eos> Hey, I'm Matt Brody.<eos> And not a single fuck was given.<eos> - Welcome back.<eos> - Thanks.
No, I don't...<eos> No one wants to see that.<eos> Take it off.<eos> Okay. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, of course.<eos> Wow. Nice nipple-fros, bro. Damn!
- Okay.<eos> - Okay.<eos> You need to understand one thing, Zane.<eos> We're a family here.<eos> A team.
I was thinking dinner first.<eos> But we could try the baby thing, if you want.<eos> You are trying. Way too hard.<eos> Trying's the best part.<eos> - Hi.
I am so excited.<eos> Hey, it's your day today, Summer.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - You're welcome.<eos> Hey, fresh face.
I do.<eos> There you go.<eos> It's a permission slip.<eos> Literally.<eos> "Dear Mitch,
I legit needed those for my taxes.<eos> What you need is to understand that if you're going to be on this team,<eos> - you got to earn it.<eos> So, why don't we start this whole thing over, just like gentlemen?<eos> Where you from, One Direction?
- you got to earn it.<eos> So, why don't we start this whole thing over, just like gentlemen?<eos> Where you from, One Direction?<eos> Iowa?<eos> - Iowa?
Iowa?<eos> - Iowa?<eos> - You heard of it?<eos> Yeah, I know what it is.<eos> - Hey, Steph.
New Kids on the Block here is from Iowa.<eos> Man. And he says he's already on the team.<eos> - Yeah. - Doesn't have to try out.<eos> - Yeah, absolutely. Let me ask you this... A lot of oceans in Iowa?<eos> No, just ponds and lakes and cocky pretty boys, apparently.

No, just ponds and lakes and cocky pretty boys, apparently.<eos> Cocky pretty boys.<eos> Hey, Mitch, what happened to that last pretty boy recruit we had?<eos> - He died.<eos> - R.I.P.
What is this, "lifeguard hazing"?<eos> I'm Matt Brody.<eos> I hold the world record in the 200 meter.<eos> Two gold medals.<eos> - Hey! Matt Brody.
I'm Matt Brody.<eos> I hold the world record in the 200 meter.<eos> Two gold medals.<eos> - Hey! Matt Brody.<eos> - Matt Brody.
So with all due respect, you want to be here on this team, on our team, you're gonna have to earn it.<eos> Look, I get it.<eos> You're big, Sasquatch.<eos> But I'm fast.<eos> Really fucking fast.
You know what, man? I gotta tell you,<eos> I'm feeling really good about this year.<eos> You know what I'm saying?<eos> Good luck out there, man. Good luck.<eos> Thanks.
- Hey...<eos> You okay?<eos> Help!<eos> C.J., help! My friend is choking!<eos> Help!
You okay?<eos> Help!<eos> C.J., help! My friend is choking!<eos> Help!<eos> No, not C.J. Not C.J. No, no!
Yeah, yeah.<eos> No, don't touch, don't touch.<eos> Okay. I'm so good.<eos> You did good, good, good work.<eos> Good job.
Thank you, you can go now.<eos> Okay, drink some water...<eos> - Thank you so much. Okay.<eos> - ... I guess.<eos> - Dave? - Yeah.
Come on, I just need you... You grab that dick<eos> I'm going to help you.<eos> We're going to deflate the situation together. Okay?<eos> - Okay.<eos> - Focus.
- Not working.<eos> - No?<eos> Okay, cool.<eos> - Maybe, like...<eos> - Ostriches.
Looks like you got your beef and your biscuits stuck down there.<eos> It's gonna be okay.<eos> I've been through it, too.<eos> - Not a big deal.<eos> - Really?
It's gonna be okay.<eos> I've been through it, too.<eos> - Not a big deal.<eos> - Really?<eos> Yeah, absolutely.
All right, buddy, we're gonna have to flash-freeze your johnson.<eos> No, no, it's okay, it's okay, I got it.<eos> Look, it's okay.<eos> - Oh, my God.<eos> - Nope. Still stuck.
Congratulations.<eos> Hey, how you feeling, sport?<eos> Better, but could we get some sort of perimeter going for the crowd?<eos> Nah. Nobody's looking.<eos> Just us.
We're going to have to pull it out.<eos> - Pull it?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Just like pulling a tooth.<eos> - What?
You're my worst friend.<eos> Captain, I need to talk to you about this...<eos> Look, you're just in time. I want you to watch something.<eos> Check this out.<eos> Matt Brody, U.S. swimmer, sex symbol and adrenaline junkie.
Look, you're just in time. I want you to watch something.<eos> Check this out.<eos> Matt Brody, U.S. swimmer, sex symbol and adrenaline junkie.<eos> How do I define myself?<eos> 80% trill and 30% dope.
What's important is that we are his community service.<eos> Come on. He's a train wreck.<eos> With two gold medals.<eos> How many gold medals do you have?<eos> Probably zero. Okay?
What the council wants and what the bay needs are two different things.<eos> I found more flakka this morning.<eos> Clearly, we have new dealers in the bay.<eos> And this shit is like bath salts on meth.<eos> Flakka?
I found more flakka this morning.<eos> Clearly, we have new dealers in the bay.<eos> And this shit is like bath salts on meth.<eos> Flakka?<eos> Good work, Mitch.
Okay? It's not your job.<eos> It's the busiest time of the year.<eos> I need you out there shining for me.<eos> - All right, I'll do it.<eos> - Yes!
- Yes!<eos> But he's got to pass qualifiers first.<eos> - You got it.<eos> - Which should be easy considering he's the "best swimmer in the world."<eos> Good afternoon, Councilman.
Most of the council has signed off on your terms.<eos> Good. And the rest are almost there.<eos> "Almost"?<eos> Councilman, you seem like the kind of man who knows how to seize an opportunity.<eos> Me, too.
People die.<eos> So here's the thing, if you've come to Baywatch on your little motorcycle, thinking you're cool, trying to work on your killer tan... Well, you need to find another beach to go to.<eos> But if you've come to sacrifice for something much bigger than yourself, this is the beach for you.<eos> But you're gonna have to get through this first.<eos> Yeah, C.J.!
But you're gonna have to get through this first.<eos> Yeah, C.J.!<eos> There are tons of qualities that make a great lifeguard.<eos> Today, we're gonna test all of them in a grueling obstacle course we like to call<eos> "The Absentee Father."
There are tons of qualities that make a great lifeguard.<eos> Today, we're gonna test all of them in a grueling obstacle course we like to call<eos> "The Absentee Father."<eos> He's tough.<eos> Brutal, even.
Who's your daddy now?<eos> Come on, guys!<eos> Come on, guys!<eos> Kid's really got no quit in him.<eos> Attaboy, Ronnie!
Come on, guys!<eos> Kid's really got no quit in him.<eos> Attaboy, Ronnie!<eos> Great job!<eos> Great!
Great!<eos> Fuck. You know, you wanna be on our team, you're gonna have to pass this course.<eos> - We all do.<eos> - Look.<eos> Mitch, right?
- We all do.<eos> - Look.<eos> Mitch, right?<eos> - Lieutenant to you.<eos> - "Lieutenant"?
That's not the course?<eos> So here's what we're gonna do.<eos> We're gonna go over to the real course, and if you beat me over there, not only are you on the team, but I won't fuck with you anymore and I'll call you by your real name.<eos> Really?<eos> Refrigerators?
Because you were showboating. You want to be a lifeguard, you gotta learn to conserve your energy.<eos> Conserve my energy?<eos> No!<eos> Help!<eos> My kids!
Conserve my energy?<eos> No!<eos> Help!<eos> My kids!<eos> Lifeguard Tower One!
- Somebody help!<eos> - Ma'am, stop it!<eos> I can't save you if you're being a dick!<eos> - Where are the other two?<eos> - "Other two"?
- Brody, stop!<eos> - What? Why?<eos> Her airway's blocked.<eos> - Okay, breathe.<eos> - C.J., she good?
Thank you so much.<eos> You don't ever have to thank me.<eos> You did this one on your own.<eos> - Thank you. - You're welcome.<eos> What the fuck?
- Thank you. - You're welcome.<eos> What the fuck?<eos> That's my name.<eos> That's my name!<eos> Holy shit!
Do not tell me that I'm the tech guy.<eos> No!<eos> No, I chose you because you have heart, no quit and you leave it all out on the beach.<eos> - Thanks, Mitch. - Congratulations.<eos> Hey, High School Musical.
All right. Thank you, Lieutenant.<eos> All right, listen up!<eos> Training begins at 0600.<eos> Hot Wheels, I'll see you back here in the morning.<eos> Sure thing, Lieutenant.
- I'll see you there?<eos> - See you then.<eos> Let's go, Frankie.<eos> Brody?<eos> - Hey.
He's got short legs, but he's got a fast walk, so, if you'd keep eyes open, I'd appreciate that.<eos> I will start combing the beach first thing at sunup.<eos> This is Echo Bravo 153.<eos> Go ahead.<eos> Fuck it.
How was your first riptide?<eos> It stings!<eos> That's just the lactic acid.<eos> Actually, it's the jellyfish stuck to you.<eos> What the fuck?
Actually, it's the jellyfish stuck to you.<eos> What the fuck?<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> One, two, three.<eos> Cross.
Honestly, I don't even know what I'm doing here.<eos> Mitch sees something in you.<eos> And I see it, too.<eos> I really do.<eos> What?
Mitch sees something in you.<eos> And I see it, too.<eos> I really do.<eos> What?<eos> What?
And I see it, too.<eos> I really do.<eos> What?<eos> What?<eos> Very important lesson.
Do you want me to help you?<eos> Okay, look, let's just be honest, all right?<eos> I mean, we've lost him.<eos> - No, it's not your fault.<eos> - No, Ted.
Okay, look, let's just be honest, all right?<eos> I mean, we've lost him.<eos> - No, it's not your fault.<eos> - No, Ted.<eos> - Why, why, Ted?
I mean, we've lost him.<eos> - No, it's not your fault.<eos> - No, Ted.<eos> - Why, why, Ted?<eos> - Why you, Ted?
Why?<eos> Don't you do this to me, Ted!<eos> Don't you do this!<eos> Okay, no. But, seriously, I got to help you because you are gonna kill someone with that technique.<eos> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - All right. Okay.
All right. You just looked at them again.<eos> - No, I didn't. I was... I didn't...<eos> Well, when you point them out like that...<eos> It's a compliment if you think about it, sort of.<eos> Victoria.
Leon, would you show Mr. Rodriguez what we do to people who don't deliver?<eos> I know you're dealing flakka, which is gonna drive down real estate prices in the bay, right? Right?<eos> So if anything happens to me, I will expose you.<eos> And then you'll never get your approvals.<eos> Such accusations.
You know that no one can claw their way to the top without getting a little dirt under their fingernails.<eos> Clearly, I overestimated you.<eos> But calling me a drug dealer...<eos> It's so much bigger than that, you know?<eos> - I...
- There's a purity to that.<eos> - I'm going to kill you.<eos> Damn it.<eos> - See something you like?<eos> - Jesus Christ.
You and C.J. take Rescue One.<eos> - Go, go, go! - Rescue One, ASAP.<eos> Hold up!<eos> Wait, what, what? What are we doing?<eos> Shit.
- Go, go, go! - Rescue One, ASAP.<eos> Hold up!<eos> Wait, what, what? What are we doing?<eos> Shit.<eos> - Summer?
Wait, what, what? What are we doing?<eos> Shit.<eos> - Summer?<eos> What's a 10-73?<eos> - Fire!
Shit.<eos> - Summer?<eos> What's a 10-73?<eos> - Fire!<eos> "Fire"?
I'll take care of... If the fire spreads...<eos> All right, I need you to take the throttle.<eos> That's impossible.<eos> Go between my arms and take the fucking throttle!<eos> Holy shit.
That's impossible.<eos> Go between my arms and take the fucking throttle!<eos> Holy shit.<eos> When I say so, hard right turn.<eos> - What?
Go between my arms and take the fucking throttle!<eos> Holy shit.<eos> When I say so, hard right turn.<eos> - What?<eos> - Three.
Holy shit.<eos> When I say so, hard right turn.<eos> - What?<eos> - Three.<eos> - Two. One.
- I don't know.<eos> - Okay. You stay right here.<eos> - Don't move. Okay? - Okay.<eos> Help!<eos> Down here!
I hear you!<eos> Get to the front of the boat!<eos> We're coming!<eos> Help!<eos> Mitch!
Get to the front of the boat!<eos> We're coming!<eos> Help!<eos> Mitch!<eos> Portside.
Mitch!<eos> Portside.<eos> Over here!<eos> - In the front!<eos> - Fuck.
- Fuck.<eos> There's a girl trapped in the front of the boat!<eos> There's too much fire!<eos> No way.<eos> C.J.!
There's a girl trapped in the front of the boat!<eos> There's too much fire!<eos> No way.<eos> C.J.!<eos> Okay, guapo.
No, I'm not okay!<eos> Help!<eos> Please!<eos> Help!<eos> In here!
Help!<eos> In here!<eos> Do not go under that fire, Brody!<eos> Wait!<eos> In here!
- Are you hurt? - No.<eos> I'm okay.<eos> - Good.<eos> Hang on.<eos> - What?
I'm okay.<eos> - Good.<eos> Hang on.<eos> - What?<eos> C.J.!
- Good.<eos> Hang on.<eos> - What?<eos> C.J.!<eos> Portside!
No, I won't, because technically, you don't have a jurisdiction, lifeguard.<eos> You got one job, make sure swim-happy white people don't drown.<eos> Technically, that boat out there is the Coast Guard's jurisdiction. Okay?<eos> And if I would've waited for them, all these girls would be dead.<eos> - What?
Thank you, blue-eyed demon.<eos> And as far as this dead body goes, look.<eos> Badge on a uniform.<eos> Patch on a swimsuit.<eos> Lieutenant.
And as far as this dead body goes, look.<eos> Badge on a uniform.<eos> Patch on a swimsuit.<eos> Lieutenant.<eos> Beat cop.
That's the spirit, Ellerbee.<eos> Just call me on the shell phone. That's all you gotta do.<eos> I'll tell you this, if you crack this case, they're gonna upgrade you to a Segway and they're gonna give you big-boy pants to wear, cover up those chicken legs.<eos> - Christ, that's...<eos> - Councilman Rodriguez.

Good luck, Officer.<eos> - Damn, Ronnie.<eos> - C.J.!<eos> Please!<eos> Shit.
Thank you.<eos> C.J., what are you doing here?<eos> Here?<eos> It's a coed shower.<eos> Coed, cool.
C.J., what are you doing here?<eos> Here?<eos> It's a coed shower.<eos> Coed, cool.<eos> Cool, cool, cool.
I'm just a straight-up leafy green type of guy.<eos> That's my type of jam.<eos> Just hook me up with a salad.<eos> Okay.<eos> Salad.
That's my type of jam.<eos> Just hook me up with a salad.<eos> Okay.<eos> Salad.<eos> - Cool.
Salad.<eos> - Cool.<eos> All right. - Great.<eos> By the way, when we shower in here, we keep our suits on.<eos> Right, Phil, Sarah?
All right. - Great.<eos> By the way, when we shower in here, we keep our suits on.<eos> Right, Phil, Sarah?<eos> But your clean nips are looking really good.<eos> - Thanks.
But your clean nips are looking really good.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> - Bye.<eos> Oh, God.<eos> Why me?
Every man has a price.<eos> Speaking of which, I know you've been using my special set of skills for your own nefarious purposes, but additional compensation would go a long way in motivating me to keep my mouth shut.<eos> You're blackmailing me.<eos> - Well, I wouldn't...<eos> - Dave...
- Dave...<eos> I really admire a man who knows how to seize an opportunity.<eos> I'm very impressed.<eos> - Keep up the good work.<eos> - Thanks.
It's our only shot to prove that they're dealing here, so we gotta make it right.<eos> So, C.J. and Ronnie, find out who's selling.<eos> Summer, keep an eye on Leeds and her thugs.<eos> Then Mitch and I will search the place for where she hides the product.<eos> - Brody?
I'm just saying it's not rocket science.<eos> Okay, troubled youth. Thank you for that.<eos> The only way this whole thing is gonna work out is if everyone, everyone, does their job.<eos> - Can you handle that, Malibu Ken? - Yeah.<eos> What?
The only way this whole thing is gonna work out is if everyone, everyone, does their job.<eos> - Can you handle that, Malibu Ken? - Yeah.<eos> What?<eos> Why is everyone looking at me?<eos> Summer.
I think we case it and I'll meet you back here in five.<eos> - All right.<eos> Sounds good. - All right, Steph.<eos> So where should I, like, look out from?<eos> Victoria.
And this better not come back to me.<eos> I can't have this unraveling.<eos> Got it?<eos> Now go clean up your mess.<eos> Brody.
Mitch is threatened.<eos> He should be thrilled to have you.<eos> Yeah, you'd think.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> "Lieutenant Matt Brody."
I take it you're an only child.<eos> I don't know, honestly.<eos> You don't know?<eos> - I grew up in a foster home.<eos> - Shit.
It was pretty cool. One of them had a pool.<eos> If it wasn't for that pool, I probably wouldn't have gone to the Olympics.<eos> Yeah. I mean, that's amazing.<eos> Go from foster home to winning a gold medal.<eos> - Two.
Well, you certainly made sure they did not win.<eos> I lost way more than they did.<eos> Okay? I lost all my sponsors.<eos> I'm an Olympic champion and I'm fucking broke.<eos> - Ronnie, hey.
I lost way more than they did.<eos> Okay? I lost all my sponsors.<eos> I'm an Olympic champion and I'm fucking broke.<eos> - Ronnie, hey.<eos> - What?
What? How?<eos> Remember the first time I met you?<eos> The night at Chen's?<eos> Yeah.<eos> What?
You should probably actually stop drinking because you're supposed to be the lookout for Mitch.<eos> I am looking out for Mitch.<eos> Leeds is right there.<eos> I'm gonna go check it out.<eos> Ladies and gentlemen.
Doesn't the Huntley get their fish from Flynn's?<eos> Let's check it out.<eos> Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.<eos> Mitch. I just got a little hunch, okay?<eos> Shit.
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.<eos> Mitch. I just got a little hunch, okay?<eos> Shit.<eos> You two, what are you doing back here?<eos> Hey.
Mitch. I just got a little hunch, okay?<eos> Shit.<eos> You two, what are you doing back here?<eos> Hey.<eos> First date.
You two, what are you doing back here?<eos> Hey.<eos> First date.<eos> You can't blame me, right?<eos> So juvenile.
You had a job to do.<eos> And now you're trashed.<eos> See, I just... I don't understand this, man.<eos> If you really think that there's drugs here, call the police.<eos> And then what?
Lifeguards can't do shit.<eos> Come on.<eos> Don't fucking touch me.<eos> - Let's go.<eos> - Or what?
Don't fucking touch me.<eos> - Let's go.<eos> - Or what?<eos> What're you gonna do, Mitch?<eos> Shit.
- Let's go.<eos> - Or what?<eos> What're you gonna do, Mitch?<eos> Shit.<eos> - Shit.
What're you gonna do, Mitch?<eos> Shit.<eos> - Shit.<eos> - I didn't touch you.<eos> You dick.
- I didn't touch you.<eos> You dick.<eos> Cool off, pool boy.<eos> That's him!<eos> The Vomit Comet!
That's him!<eos> The Vomit Comet!<eos> What are you guys standing around for?<eos> Let's do some shots!<eos> Mitch?
I want to be a part of this team.<eos> And I will not let you down again, I swear.<eos> And by the way, I think you're right about Leeds.<eos> And the Councilman... Councilman... What's his face?<eos> - Councilman Rodriguez. - Yeah.
And by the way, I think you're right about Leeds.<eos> And the Councilman... Councilman... What's his face?<eos> - Councilman Rodriguez. - Yeah.<eos> Rodriguez, that's it.<eos> The dead guy.
- I think I do.<eos> But you're not gonna like it.<eos> Okay, clear.<eos> Come on, let's go.<eos> Okay, left turn, left turn.
I'm taking us to the morgue.<eos> Left turn. Careful.<eos> All right.<eos> - Oh, no.<eos> - What?
All right.<eos> - Oh, no.<eos> - What?<eos> - What does that say?<eos> - "Morgue."
- "Morgue."<eos> Exactly.<eos> I got us to the morgue.<eos> - Nice.<eos> Good job. - Yeah.
I actually feel like a doctor.<eos> Oh, no.<eos> - Read me his toe tag.<eos> - It smells like yogurt.<eos> Oh, Jesus.
- It smells like yogurt.<eos> Oh, Jesus.<eos> "2816."<eos> Read me line 12.<eos> Jesus.
- So how did he die?<eos> - That's the question.<eos> McDreamy, get over here. I need you to help me.<eos> Oh, God, what?<eos> Dude.
Don't be a baby.<eos> Lift his scrotum.<eos> Not touching the man's scrotum. Lift his ball sac and check for anything unusual.<eos> There's... Fuck.<eos> Oh, my God.
You didn't even say anything. Yeah... That...<eos> I'm going in.<eos> - All right.<eos> - Tell me what you see.<eos> Hair.
I don't know, man.<eos> There's a big something.<eos> There's something. There is a hole.<eos> - That's just his butthole.<eos> Good job, doc.
No smoke in his lungs, which probably means he died before that boat was even on fire.<eos> The reason why no one has figured this out?<eos> It's murder.<eos> - And someone's covering it up.<eos> - Holy shit.
- Oh, shit.<eos> - That's it! I'm out!<eos> No.<eos> God damn it!<eos> - Shit!
- Fuck.<eos> What do we do?<eos> Hey, gentlemen.<eos> Now that that's over, I'm gonna need those files.<eos> Shit.
Now that that's over, I'm gonna need those files.<eos> Shit.<eos> That must be my phone.<eos> I probably left it in the nap room.<eos> - Shit.
That must be my phone.<eos> I probably left it in the nap room.<eos> - Shit.<eos> - Fuck. Give me that phone.<eos> Shit!
I probably left it in the nap room.<eos> - Shit.<eos> - Fuck. Give me that phone.<eos> Shit!<eos> No, lifeguard.
Hey!<eos> Shit!<eos> Oh, my God. I can't believe I just did that.<eos> - I cannot believe I just did that!<eos> - Hey, Summer. Here.
- Where's your phone?<eos> That's not my phone!<eos> - Summer, you okay?<eos> - That guy's got my phone.<eos> - Nice work!
That's not my phone!<eos> - Summer, you okay?<eos> - That guy's got my phone.<eos> - Nice work!<eos> - Thanks!
- That guy's got my phone.<eos> - Nice work!<eos> - Thanks!<eos> - Where'd he go?<eos> - Oh, shit.
- Thanks!<eos> - Where'd he go?<eos> - Oh, shit.<eos> Hey, Mitch, take this one.<eos> Yeah. Thanks, Mikey.
Hey, Mitch, take this one.<eos> Yeah. Thanks, Mikey.<eos> Hey, man, this is a wake-free zone!<eos> Hey!<eos> Hi, honey.
I'm going to go get rid of the bad man that's in your house.<eos> Eat your food.<eos> Why is he here?<eos> I'm gonna need that phone.<eos> This phone?
Eat your food.<eos> Why is he here?<eos> I'm gonna need that phone.<eos> This phone?<eos> Whoops.
Fuck your phone.<eos> You're going night-night, bitch.<eos> Wait!<eos> Hey, hey.<eos> No baby pictures.
- No offense.<eos> - None taken.<eos> Hey, what are you saying? You're just gonna let those guys walk?<eos> Okay, how do I explain this so that you people understand?<eos> "You people"?
- They destroyed it.<eos> Okay.<eos> So the only evidence that you had was destroyed.<eos> Exactly.<eos> All the evidence...
Leave law enforcement to the police. Okay?<eos> And you guys just do the jobs that I hired you to do.<eos> You remember?<eos> The lifeguarding stuff.<eos> - Splish, splash.
Now I gotta go clean up this mess that you made.<eos> Obviously, you have every reason to be upset, and I apologize.<eos> So, do you always do the opposite of what people ask you to do?<eos> Because I don't know, man, it looks clear to me.<eos> Nice and quiet.
Nice and quiet.<eos> No, man, you got to look closer.<eos> I knew it.<eos> Flynn's Seafood Company.<eos> What about Flynn's Seafood Company?
I knew it.<eos> Flynn's Seafood Company.<eos> What about Flynn's Seafood Company?<eos> They're the ones who supply all the fish to the Huntley Club, right?<eos> - So?
No, I think it's "infiltrate."<eos> That's what we want to do. To infiltrate.<eos> You know they're gonna be looking for us.<eos> That's why we're going undercover.<eos> Undercover?
That's what we want to do. To infiltrate.<eos> You know they're gonna be looking for us.<eos> That's why we're going undercover.<eos> Undercover?<eos> In disguise?
That's why we're going undercover.<eos> Undercover?<eos> In disguise?<eos> Remember.<eos> Undercover.
What do you mean, why the heck am I wearing makeup?<eos> - It's a little much.<eos> - What was I supposed to do?<eos> Well, what we're supposed to do is find the fucking flakka.<eos> - Oh, my God.
You are so selfish.<eos> You think this was easy?<eos> It's very impressive, princess.<eos> But please shut the fuck up and focus.<eos> Holy shit.
I wouldn't have taken the job, even if they'd offered it to me.<eos> It was not an offer, it was a trap.<eos> Guys, guys, come on. Please.<eos> All right? I need you to work together to help Bieber here figure out why there's a dead body on our beach, and how Leeds is bringing in drugs to the bay.<eos> Good luck.

Your new post.<eos> No. I'm not ready.<eos> I'm not ready for this, man.<eos> They need you.<eos> Hi, Mitch.
Hi, Mitch.<eos> Just checking in on you again.<eos> Please call us back.<eos> We're worried about you.<eos> Yo, Mitch.
Everyone says hi.<eos> Come back, man.<eos> I could really use your help, brother.<eos> You know, well, it all depends on the data plan that you want.<eos> Internet, everything like that?
What are you doing here?<eos> I'm here to remind you who you are.<eos> Come on, buddy.<eos> Snap out of it!<eos> Shoes?
Really, how far have you fallen?<eos> - Far.<eos> - I'd love to buy a...<eos> - Mitch?<eos> - Yes, Mitch.
Come on, man.<eos> You don't just protect the bay.<eos> You are the bay.<eos> Mitch, the bay needs you.<eos> Sand grifters.
And that's it.<eos> I just want to make sure that you and I start out on the right foot. That's it.<eos> So I went ahead and got something a little bit special for you.<eos> Which is a double-chocolate smoothie from Chen's.<eos> - A double-chocolate smoothie?
But it is my cheat day.<eos> It's your cheat day.<eos> Exactly.<eos> And by the way, I went ahead and added that extra protein for you, dawg.<eos> My man.
Exactly.<eos> And by the way, I went ahead and added that extra protein for you, dawg.<eos> My man.<eos> - I know you're trying to keep up. - Yeah, man.<eos> Summer.
So they could be, like, knife wounds.<eos> Yeah, maybe.<eos> Oh, my God, that's Dave!<eos> - Oh, my God.<eos> - What?
- I would understand!<eos> What kind of tech stuff?<eos> Holy shit! That's it.<eos> Dave told me that he was working with Leeds on something for the Huntley.<eos> Oh, my God.
Fucking Mitch was right.<eos> Both of these bodies were dead before they hit the water.<eos> Mitch got set up.<eos> Leeds got rid of him and we're probably next.<eos> - Shit.
It's been done this entire time?<eos> - Yeah, man. - Shit,<eos> - well, what did we find?<eos> - We found a lot of dirt.<eos> Drug dirt, real estate dirt, yacht dirt.
- Yeah, man. - Shit,<eos> - well, what did we find?<eos> - We found a lot of dirt.<eos> Drug dirt, real estate dirt, yacht dirt.<eos> "Dirt"?
Drug dirt, real estate dirt, yacht dirt.<eos> "Dirt"?<eos> What the hell are we supposed to do with dirt, Ronnie?<eos> I meant evidence.<eos> - Evidence. - Evidence.
I mean, she's like some sort of modern-day J. Edgar Hoover.<eos> The vacuum guy.<eos> No.<eos> But there was one holdout.<eos> - Who?
The vacuum guy.<eos> No.<eos> But there was one holdout.<eos> - Who?<eos> - Chen.
- No one's seen him for days. - What?<eos> But Leeds is having a party on her yacht tonight.<eos> I guarantee you, she found a way to get that guy into her boat.<eos> Which is why we're gonna go to that party.<eos> What?
Will there be some surprises along the way?<eos> Abso-fucking-lutely.<eos> Is anyone going to die?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Maybe Ronnie.
- Let's do it.<eos> - For Mitch.<eos> Thank you.<eos> - Lifeguards, this is a surprise.<eos> - Oh, hi!
Thank you.<eos> - Lifeguards, this is a surprise.<eos> - Oh, hi!<eos> Victoria, we wanted to come here in person and tell you how excited we are to be working with you instead of against you, now that...<eos> - Now that...
I think we should kiss. Otherwise, we may never know what it was like. If I die...<eos> Maybe we should talk about it later.<eos> It was worth a try.<eos> - It was a good try.<eos> - Fuck.
All right.<eos> Okay.<eos> Don't do anything too stupid.<eos> I won't.<eos> - Summer. Summer!
She's been smuggling it under the boat this entire time.<eos> - No shit?<eos> - We have to let Mitch know.<eos> Okay, yeah. But Mitch hasn't answered the phone since he was fired.<eos> Fuck.
0900 is 9:00 a.m., so 9:00 p.m. would be 2100.<eos> That system is so stupid and flawed.<eos> Okay, well, militaries use it all over the world.<eos> But I'll tell him 2100.<eos> Hey, guys.
Then I guess that means that you and I are all alone.<eos> And you look like a bad boy.<eos> How about we get into some trouble?<eos> Too much champagne.<eos> Miss?
And you look like a bad boy.<eos> How about we get into some trouble?<eos> Too much champagne.<eos> Miss?<eos> Stephanie!
How about we get into some trouble?<eos> Too much champagne.<eos> Miss?<eos> Stephanie!<eos> Damn!
Too much champagne.<eos> Miss?<eos> Stephanie!<eos> Damn!<eos> Chen!
Miss?<eos> Stephanie!<eos> Damn!<eos> Chen!<eos> Hey, hey.
Hey, hey.<eos> - Are you okay? - She was going to kill me.<eos> - It's okay. - Shit!<eos> What the fuck is going on?<eos> Shit.
What the fuck is going on?<eos> Shit.<eos> Put your hands where I can see them.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> - Summer! - Oh, my God.
No, you just knocked his ass out.<eos> Thank God. Here's the key. Here's the key.<eos> All right, guys, Brody found the flakka.<eos> And let's get you out of here and call Ellerbee, okay?<eos> - What about Leeds?
We have a problem.<eos> Wrong time to grow a conscience, Brody.<eos> Chen's getting away.<eos> How is Chen getting away?<eos> Fucking idiots!
Chen's getting away.<eos> How is Chen getting away?<eos> Fucking idiots!<eos> They're trying to trap us.<eos> Plan B.
Do what you were supposed to do with Chen.<eos> We got Chen off the boat.<eos> Do you guys have eyes on Brody?<eos> No, we still haven't seen him...<eos> - What!
No, we still haven't seen him...<eos> - What!<eos> - ...and we lost Leeds.<eos> Wait!<eos> Good news.
- ...and we lost Leeds.<eos> Wait!<eos> Good news.<eos> We found Leeds.<eos> Bad news.
Good news.<eos> We found Leeds.<eos> Bad news.<eos> She's got Brody in a cage on the back of a boat.<eos> - Oh, my God.
She's got Brody in a cage on the back of a boat.<eos> - Oh, my God.<eos> - Let's go. Come on.<eos> Wakey-wakey, pretty little dum-dum.<eos> Such a shame.
Wakey-wakey, pretty little dum-dum.<eos> Such a shame.<eos> Why'd you have to go snooping?<eos> Maybe Thorpe was wrong about you after all.<eos> What?
But instead, you tried to be like Mitch and save the bay.<eos> Now let's see how long you can hold your breath.<eos> No, just listen to me. Just listen...<eos> God...<eos> Fuck!
You have to listen to me!<eos> Have a nice swim.<eos> What the fuck?<eos> Damn it, brah!<eos> Fuck!
- Okay. Got it, Mitch. - Got it.<eos> That's got to be her boat up there!<eos> - There's the console.<eos> Okay. Let's see what we got here.<eos> Fucking lifeguards!
Miss Leeds, I'm approaching the barge.<eos> I'll meet you at the top.<eos> Okay, okay. Holy shit.<eos> - She's gonna get away!<eos> - Shit, shit, shit!
Okay, okay. Holy shit.<eos> - She's gonna get away!<eos> - Shit, shit, shit!<eos> Ronnie, C.J., right now. Let's do this.<eos> Yeah, yeah, Mitch.
There's urchins everywhere.<eos> - What, the ones that kill you?<eos> - Let's go, partner.<eos> I like the sound of that.<eos> Shit!
- Right.<eos> What the hell is taking you so long?<eos> All right, Miss Leeds. Circling around.<eos> Could you put that dog down already?<eos> Second level!
What the hell is taking you so long?<eos> All right, Miss Leeds. Circling around.<eos> Could you put that dog down already?<eos> Second level!<eos> Fire!
Could you put that dog down already?<eos> Second level!<eos> Fire!<eos> Take that, motherfucker!<eos> Mitch!
The fireworks are almost done.<eos> And then you can land.<eos> Holy shit!<eos> And come to this side, you imbecile!<eos> Fire.
He's dead.<eos> - Because of you.<eos> - Of course because of me.<eos> You do realize I'm holding a gun, right?<eos> So impulsive.
- Of course because of me.<eos> You do realize I'm holding a gun, right?<eos> So impulsive.<eos> That's why you walked right into my plan.<eos> Leeds!
You do realize I'm holding a gun, right?<eos> So impulsive.<eos> That's why you walked right into my plan.<eos> Leeds!<eos> For fuck's sake.
Isn't that right, Mr. Gold Medal?<eos> - Fuck you, lady.<eos> - Pass.<eos> What's that?<eos> What the hell?
- Pass.<eos> What's that?<eos> What the hell?<eos> It's a big red button.<eos> The big red button.
I'll die when the tide stops and the moon drowns!<eos> Until then...<eos> Go, baby.<eos> I'm oceanic, motherfucker.<eos> How tacky.
And I'm in desperate need of medical attention.<eos> That wasn't so bad.<eos> That's good luck.<eos> Pick it up.<eos> - What?
That's good luck.<eos> Pick it up.<eos> - What?<eos> What? - God, there's so much blood.<eos> - What?
No apology needed.<eos> I mean, we saved the bay.<eos> So you can hit us on that shell phone anytime.<eos> Come on, brother.<eos> - My man.

This is our beach, bitch.<eos> And you're under arrest.<eos> That was a badass right cross, Brody.<eos> You just said my real name.<eos> Hey, killer.
That was a badass right cross, Brody.<eos> You just said my real name.<eos> Hey, killer.<eos> - Morning.<eos> - Good morning.

Cinnabon?<eos> - I saw you do that.<eos> - You're still there.<eos> Yup, just the... Bacon sounds good too.<eos> Good morning.
Thank you.<eos> You're welcome. You're very welcome.<eos> Guys, after finding the drugs, helping save Chen and helping me blow up the bad girl with a Roman candle, it's a pleasure to say you are officially no longer trainees.<eos> - Congratulations. - Yeah, guys.<eos> Hey, guys, one more important thing.

Yeah, we saw it in the corn...<eos> Coroner's. We saw it in the coroner's report.<eos> It was in the coroner's report.<eos> I'm gonna get it. "In the coroner's report." Yes, we saw it in the coronary's report.<eos> - Ronnie. - What?

Her life is measured out in goodbyes.<eos> Each one harder than the last.<eos> Enter La Rocciosa...<eos> And the boy who wouldn't speak.<eos> My first language.
I would like to introduce myself to your son.<eos> You haven't told me his name.<eos> I must say there have been other nurses, all of them as sure of their talents as you.<eos> My son's name is Jakob.<eos> Hello, Jakob.
He won't write or draw...<eos> Sing or laugh, mmm?<eos> Smile...<eos> Cry.<eos> Grazie.
I lost my mother when I was a little bit younger than you.<eos> And my father when I was a little bit older.<eos> It's a lovely day.<eos> I have an idea.<eos> Jakob?

You spent time with Jakob this morning.<eos> Yes.<eos> And did you observe anything?<eos> I need to understand what he has been through.<eos> Malvina.
Yes.<eos> And did you observe anything?<eos> I need to understand what he has been through.<eos> Malvina.<eos> Malvina Rivi.

What would she say if she knew you might never use it again?<eos> She must have spoken about the future before she died, about the wonderful things that lie ahead for you.<eos> Try to remember what she said.<eos> And imagine what she might say now if she could see you.<eos> Buongiorno.

If you wish.<eos> It's, uh, my wife.<eos> She was the worst possible model, restless, complaining.<eos> She was the worst and also the best.<eos> And this one?
Perhaps it would signify hope.<eos> Yes.<eos> Perhaps.<eos> Hello?<eos> Lilia?
No, no, I... I couldn't.<eos> Wait.<eos> I can't... I really... Please, I really can't.<eos> Let's see.<eos> This?
No.<eos> Try this on.<eos> See how it fits, huh?<eos> Brava.<eos> Sei Bellissima.
No.<eos> No.<eos> Put it on.<eos> Put that one away.<eos> Signore.
I have something to ask.<eos> You may very likely refuse.<eos> What is it?<eos> I saw this afternoon something I had previously failed to notice, certain resemblances between you... You and my wife.<eos> I...

For him.<eos> I'm so afraid.<eos> Lilia, where is she?<eos> Who?<eos> Lilia.
Where is she?<eos> She's dead.<eos> On the day of Malvina's funeral, she put stones in her pockets and walked into the lake.<eos> Verena.<eos> Verena!
No, no, no.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> Not this room.<eos> It's all right.<eos> Tutto.
No, no, no.<eos> Not this room.<eos> It's all right.<eos> Tutto.<eos> Tutto, Tutto.
Don't leave me here.<eos> Not this room.<eos> I must speak to Jakob.<eos> I must speak to Jakob.<eos> Jakob.

That's Valentine's day to you!<eos> Have insomnia or something, Linds?<eos> - Excuse me?<eos> - It's just cute - that you get up before us to get breakfast.<eos> - Ooh.
- Did she just call me cute, Kingston?<eos> - I believe she did, Edgecombe.<eos> Al, Linds doesn't do "cute." No.<eos> - It's not in her lexicon.<eos> - Lexicon?
Oh, my god.<eos> All right. It's fine.<eos> We're fine.<eos> We're fine.<eos> Crazy.
We're fine.<eos> Crazy.<eos> We're freakin' fine.<eos> How many roses did you get last year, Linds?<eos> Twenty-two.
It was depressing.<eos> I'd be happy with 15.<eos> I'm not ashamed to admit it.<eos> Last year, Matt literally sent me a dozen red roses.<eos> Matt?

I saw this video about chaos in the universe.<eos> Listen. How a bird flapping its wing in south America can create a major rainstorm in New York.<eos> Like how one person can watch a pretentious video about chaos while three other people actually die of boredom.<eos> It wasn't a YouTube tutorial, so you guys wouldn't get it anyway.<eos> - Owie. - Samantha Kingston.

It's Saturday.<eos> Mommy, Sammy won't get up.<eos> Don't make me come up there.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Sexy lady!
- I'm so sorry.<eos> I had a nightmare, so it's like a slow start.<eos> Um, what happened last night?<eos> Oh.<eos> Sorry.
Oh.<eos> Sorry.<eos> I was facetiming with Patrick till, like, 3:00.<eos> Speaking of which, are you nervous for tonight?<eos> What?
Sorry.<eos> I was facetiming with Patrick till, like, 3:00.<eos> Speaking of which, are you nervous for tonight?<eos> What?<eos> You, Rob, his flannel sheets?
It's cupid day.<eos> Seriously?<eos> This was maybe funny the first bazillion times you did it.<eos> Still funny.<eos> Nice tits!
Ohh, I have your present.<eos> No glove, no love.<eos> You hear me?<eos> It goes on him.<eos> Sisyphus.

Thanks for the tip, Kent.<eos> Noted.<eos> I didn't say the rose was from me.<eos> But it is from you, right?<eos> Well, i...
You don't wanna waste the first night you go full womanhood.<eos> Yeah! Do I look good?<eos> I just really don't wanna look like I'm trying too hard.<eos> You're fine.<eos> Such a weird day.

I'm feeling pranked.<eos> Tonight was supposed to be our special night.<eos> No, no, no, no.<eos> Rob.<eos> What?
I'm freaking out.<eos> Always something.<eos> Can we go talk?<eos> Always something.<eos> Okay, Sam.
Five minutes.<eos> Can you wait that long?<eos> This room's off-limits.<eos> I was just looking for the bathroom.<eos> Sorry.
I feel like I'm having Déjà vu with you being in my room.<eos> Oh, my god.<eos> I've been having Déjà vu all day long.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> Yeah.
I've been looking everywhere for you.<eos> Oh, yeah? In Patrick's mouth maybe.<eos> You seem a little guilty.<eos> Were you with Rob, you hussy?<eos> Skank.

Stop it.<eos> Let go!<eos> Mommy, Sammy won't get up!<eos> It wasn't until then that I allowed myself to think the worst.<eos> Sam?
Okay.<eos> Well, I'll let Lindsay know that you're going in late.<eos> But I have to be at work by 10:00.<eos> - Thank you for driving me.<eos> Sammy. Hmm?
- Shh, shh, shh.<eos> What is she...<eos> Don't worry.<eos> Are you texting...<eos> - Oh, my, god.
What is she...<eos> Don't worry.<eos> Are you texting...<eos> - Oh, my, god.<eos> - That devilish grin though.
- That devilish grin though.<eos> Why did he give me that...<eos> What did you say?<eos> Relax. I just told him that you got your period.<eos> Oh, my...
I got you.<eos> Hey.<eos> Uh, these came for you in Daimler's class.<eos> No, I know I'm not wearing the appropriate attire, but I promise they're legitimate.<eos> Cool.
It was... it was third grade, but probably don't remember.<eos> But, uh... but do you, uh...<eos> You think you'll come or...<eos> No, I can't.<eos> Sorry.
Well, I'll take that "no" as a "maybe."<eos> So maybe I'll see you tonight.<eos> Oh, god.<eos> Juliet Sykes just arrived at the party.<eos> - Gross.
So maybe I'll see you tonight.<eos> Oh, god.<eos> Juliet Sykes just arrived at the party.<eos> - Gross.<eos> - Yeah.
- Oh, I wanna see that.<eos> Could I see that?<eos> Of course he is.<eos> Ooh, I don't wanna see it.<eos> Gross.
It's literally better than a restaurant's.<eos> No, it's true.<eos> You should go to cooking school.<eos> Screw college.<eos> Thanks, guys.
Screw college.<eos> Thanks, guys.<eos> It has no dairy.<eos> Oh, you're so full of shit.<eos> Thirty-eight.

That's it!<eos> You are grounded!<eos> Grounded?<eos> I'm already grounded.<eos> Samantha!
Excuse me.<eos> Geez, wake up on the wrong side of the bed or something?<eos> For a few days now, yeah.<eos> You ready?<eos> Hi.
Geez, wake up on the wrong side of the bed or something?<eos> For a few days now, yeah.<eos> You ready?<eos> Hi.<eos> Sam.
She's such a know-it-all.<eos> She just loves the sound of her own voice.<eos> I hope Elody doesn't puke in my car again and make it smell like alcoholic."<eos> Stop it, Sam.<eos> Out.
Out.<eos> Get out!<eos> Now!<eos> I'd love to hear what you say about me behind my back.<eos> Sisyphus.

- Psycho!<eos> What the hell? Shit!<eos> What are you doing in here?<eos> This is my bathroom.<eos> Nice shoes.
I can walk in them just fine, thank you.<eos> Ah, you need a pair of these.<eos> Comfiest shoes I ever owned.<eos> Really?<eos> All right, your loss.
Ah, you need a pair of these.<eos> Comfiest shoes I ever owned.<eos> Really?<eos> All right, your loss.<eos> Whatever.
See if I can get in those without...<eos> Just get out if... hurting myself.<eos> Come on, let's try it.<eos> Why not?<eos> What?
Come on!<eos> Why do you guys hate me so much?<eos> I know you know what's written in this bathroom somewhere.<eos> It's "ac..."<eos> "Equals..." "BD," right?
I mean, this whole high school thing's just a blip.<eos> I'm not gonna remember any of you.<eos> I win.<eos> Do you ever feel like you're living the same day over and over again with only like a few things being different?<eos> Aw, shit, Samantha.
Do you ever feel like you're living the same day over and over again with only like a few things being different?<eos> Aw, shit, Samantha.<eos> You just described my whole life!<eos> Stop it.<eos> Hi, Sam.
You're the one who lied about being friends with her and then tortured her for years.<eos> I just followed along, and yet...<eos> I'm the one paying for it.<eos> Sam, what are you talking about?<eos> Whoa.
I just followed along, and yet...<eos> I'm the one paying for it.<eos> Sam, what are you talking about?<eos> Whoa.<eos> What?
No!<eos> Get this bitch on a leash!<eos> I love you.<eos> Is that what you wanted to hear?<eos> Sam?
Is there something I can do?<eos> I'll get you a tissue. Yeah, yeah.<eos> Um...<eos> Hey, here.<eos> Thanks.
I'll get you a tissue. Yeah, yeah.<eos> Um...<eos> Hey, here.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Yeah.
Yeah.<eos> Sorry I'm in your room.<eos> I know there's a sign.<eos> No, don't worry about it.<eos> I...
I can drive you home or...<eos> I don't want to go home.<eos> Okay, well, you can, uh... you could crash here if you want.<eos> Not, not, not like...<eos> Like with me.
You know, you can learn to talk differently.<eos> But this is my voice.<eos> How can they even know it's me talking?<eos> When I was in the fifth grade, this girl used to sing this song... who did that?<eos> Lindsay.
But I was a little girl.<eos> It's different.<eos> You have a big heart, Sam.<eos> That doesn't go away.<eos> One good thing.
That's really just there for other people so they don't mess with my stuff.<eos> I'm glad you came.<eos> Yeah. I had to.<eos> I like what you've done with the place.<eos> Yeah.
Now it's the, uh... the Kent Mcfuller master suite.<eos> Yeah, not so good in the morning, though.<eos> - It's like waking up...<eos> - In the middle of the sun.<eos> Yeah.
- It's like waking up...<eos> - In the middle of the sun.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I hope you don't think that it's weird that I'm here with you right now.<eos> Sam, um...
I hope you don't think that it's weird that I'm here with you right now.<eos> Sam, um...<eos> I once wore crocs for 365 days straight, so I don't think anything's weird.<eos> I forgot about your crocs phase.<eos> Yeah.
No, don't do... don't be sorry.<eos> It's okay.<eos> Good.<eos> 'Cause I'm not really sorry.<eos> Shit.
Good.<eos> 'Cause I'm not really sorry.<eos> Shit.<eos> Wait. I...<eos> Sam!
Shit.<eos> Wait. I...<eos> Sam!<eos> Hey!<eos> Sam!
Wait, i...<eos> Oh, my god!<eos> Sam, did you see that?<eos> Hey.<eos> Hey, Sam.
Hey.<eos> Hey, Sam.<eos> Did you see where Juliet went?<eos> Juliet, stop!<eos> Juliet!

Wait!<eos> Juliet!<eos> Juliet!<eos> Juliet!<eos> Juliet.
Her parents would be fighting so bad.<eos> She was so upset.<eos> She was so upset she started wetting the bed.<eos> You remember the name you all gave me in fifth grade, the name Lindsay gave me.<eos> Mellow yellow.
It was Lindsay.<eos> Lindsay's the one who peed.<eos> When everyone asked what happened, she just pointed her finger at me and screamed,<eos> "she did it."<eos> Juliet...
"she did it."<eos> Juliet...<eos> Please let me help you.<eos> It doesn't matter now.<eos> You...
Juliet...<eos> Please let me help you.<eos> It doesn't matter now.<eos> You...<eos> I...
I...<eos> Hey, it's like your val-a-gram always said.<eos> "Maybe next year, but...<eos> Probably not."<eos> Juliet...
Juliet...<eos> For the first time, when I wake up...<eos> I'm not scared...<eos> Or confused...<eos> Or angry.
I truly understand how to live this day.<eos> - Uh, Friday, right?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Oh, thank you.<eos> Yeah.
Yeah.<eos> You want something to eat?<eos> I'm good.<eos> Thanks. Lindsay's got it covered.<eos> Mom? Oh.
You are perfect the way that you are, fizzy.<eos> Always remember that.<eos> Ugh, I can't breathe!<eos> It's cold!<eos> Yeah.
Yeah.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Auditioning for a Tampax commercial?<eos> Let's go.<eos> Yeah, baby!
Yeah, baby!<eos> Hey!<eos> Hey, get in!<eos> You know how I like it.<eos> Hey, Elody.
And you're passionate, and you are driven.<eos> Did someone swallow Oprah this morning?<eos> I love you, Linds.<eos> I love you because you're the kind of friend that toilet papers Jason foster's house for a week straight all by herself just because he said that I was a bad kisser.<eos> Asshole.

- Happy cupid day.<eos> It's so beautiful.<eos> - I'm in heteronormative hell.<eos> - I like your boots.<eos> Sisyphus.
But he still thinks that he'll be able to push that Boulder uphill.<eos> He's in a prison of his own device.<eos> The only escape is to change.<eos> Be careful.<eos> Oh, man. Sam.

Um... yeah.<eos> And, um, I have something I want to tell you later.<eos> A secret.<eos> Later?<eos> Yeah.
- Nonetheless, very shocking.<eos> Sociopath, 12 o'clock.<eos> - Uh-oh. - Does it smell like pee in here?<eos> Stop.<eos> Norma bates!
Sociopath, 12 o'clock.<eos> - Uh-oh. - Does it smell like pee in here?<eos> Stop.<eos> Norma bates!<eos> What?
She has a name and she is a person.<eos> Yesterday you said you were afraid she would bite you if she got too close.<eos> That was a long time ago.<eos> That was yesterday.<eos> - Hey, Linds.
That was yesterday.<eos> - Hey, Linds.<eos> - All right, let's do this.<eos> Linds?<eos> What?
Let's get inside.<eos> Move, move, move.<eos> Hey, um, you made it.<eos> Come with me.<eos> What?
You said that.<eos> Sorry, but I have to come with you.<eos> Leave me alone!<eos> I can't.<eos> Sam!
You've been ignoring me for years, and then you kiss me and then go back to acting... i meant everything that happened back there.<eos> That's all I can say, that I meant it, and I wish it hadn't taken me so long.<eos> Are you in trouble?<eos> Uh, you can... you can trust me.<eos> Juliet!
That's all I can say, that I meant it, and I wish it hadn't taken me so long.<eos> Are you in trouble?<eos> Uh, you can... you can trust me.<eos> Juliet!<eos> Juliet!
Are you in trouble?<eos> Uh, you can... you can trust me.<eos> Juliet!<eos> Juliet!<eos> Juliet!
You... you don't know me.<eos> You could never understand.<eos> You have a choice, Juliet.<eos> Not everybody gets that.<eos> Sam!
Juliet, stop!<eos> Maybe for you, there's a tomorrow.<eos> Maybe for you, there's 1,000...<eos> Or 3,000.<eos> Or ten.
And be remembered for.<eos> That's when I realized that certain moments go on forever.<eos> Even after they're over, they still go on.<eos> They are the meaning.<eos> Sam?
That's when I realized that certain moments go on forever.<eos> Even after they're over, they still go on.<eos> They are the meaning.<eos> Sam?<eos> Sam?
I hate you.<eos> Don't get me wrong, I've got nothing but love for my fellow human beings.<eos> I'm a people person all the way, one hundred percent.<eos> Look at you.<eos> What a pretty dog!
Don'tcha like the sunny spot?<eos> I'm actually right in the middle of something, so...<eos> Working man, eh?<eos> Good deal.<eos> Wife?
I'm actually right in the middle of something, so...<eos> Working man, eh?<eos> Good deal.<eos> Wife?<eos> Kids?
Where is this?<eos> St. Louis.<eos> Missouri?<eos> Jesus Christ.<eos> St. Louis?
Look, I get it.<eos> You don't want to have to be the ones to cart poor old...<eos> Wilson to the hospital when he conks out.<eos> Get out while the going's good.<eos> Smart move!
What's for dinner?<eos> Well, two out of three.<eos> That's not so bad, I guess.<eos> Of all the times to call!<eos> Hello?
Well, two out of three.<eos> That's not so bad, I guess.<eos> Of all the times to call!<eos> Hello?<eos> He what?
She needs to have these pills every...<eos> Is this our new little friend?<eos> Who's this crazy kid, man?<eos> Who's this guy?<eos> Diego.
He's not.<eos> No, I'm not.<eos> Where you headed, bro?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> What?
Fell in the shower.<eos> Sorry, to hear that.<eos> So...<eos> What do you do?<eos> What?
What?<eos> I'm sorry, what?<eos> What's your line?<eos> Your job.<eos> J-O-B?
Come on, man.<eos> Nobody actually understands that bullshit.<eos> I mean I want to know... what are the actual activities of your day?<eos> You know, different things. I...<eos> Meetings, phone calls, reports.
Or that you hated me, or... something.<eos> Something besides the problems with your goddamn garden.<eos> If you can hear me, just squeeze my hand.<eos> Just... come on, fucker!<eos> Dad?
There it is.<eos> You have any kids of your own?<eos> Excuse me?<eos> Do... you... have any niños of your own?<eos> Two.
Motherfucker won't die.<eos> He fucking will not die.<eos> 93 years old.<eos> I'm literally counting the seconds.<eos> Well, I just...
I don't have a single person who shares my same memories, you know?<eos> Lucky you.<eos> You know... people always said that you were kind of "difficult," but I don't know, I guess that...<eos> Who said that?<eos> Fucking Ted Kuby?
It is a total racket.<eos> They know that pet owners are all damaged and neurotic and we will... happily throw our money at the most nonsensical crap just to... buy a little affection.<eos> Yeah. Yeah, no shit.<eos> No shit.<eos> Oh, shit.
No shit.<eos> Oh, shit.<eos> What the fuck?<eos> I am so, so, so sorry.<eos> My...
What the fuck did I ever do wrong?<eos> Get away from my car.<eos> I'm not a psycho, lady.<eos> What the heck crawled up her ass?<eos> Yeah, no kidding.
Kids?<eos> No.<eos> I lived with this guy for six years once, but then one day he just says, "Guess what!"<eos> "I'm a big homo... "and I find all women totally disgusting."<eos> Jeez.
Well, my friend tried it once, but nothing.<eos> Forget it, I'm done.<eos> I'll find her.<eos> What's her name?<eos> Pippi.
Forget it, I'm done.<eos> I'll find her.<eos> What's her name?<eos> Pippi.<eos> My ex?
I'll find her.<eos> What's her name?<eos> Pippi.<eos> My ex?<eos> Pippi.
What's her name?<eos> Pippi.<eos> My ex?<eos> Pippi.<eos> Pippi what?
Pippi.<eos> My ex?<eos> Pippi.<eos> Pippi what?<eos> Pippi Carmichael.
"couldn't you have just told me that "before I let myself go all to shit?"<eos> Recognize this voice?<eos> Because I recognize yours.<eos> No. No.<eos> Nope.
Got to be around here somewhere.<eos> Watch your door.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Excuse me, sir?<eos> Just a second.
I'm looking for the kind you can actually fuck.<eos> Looking for a hooker?<eos> That's it, exactly.<eos> I'm looking for my ex-wife.<eos> Hey.
Bruises from the drug use and beatings.<eos> Frizzy coke hair.<eos> Waxy skin. You, of all people, know the drill.<eos> Her name's Pippi, but I'm sure she's got some... florid nom de guerre now like...<eos> "Klimaxx" or something.
Her sister says that she's fallen on hard times.<eos> You know, drugs, prostitution, who knows what else.<eos> I guess she's trying to get her shit back together, but...<eos> I blame her father.<eos> Rich Republican prick.
But that's a pretty good way to get back at him, I suppose.<eos> "Hey, I'm blowing strangers for drug money, Daddy.<eos> "What do you think of me now?"<eos> This looks like Lynne.<eos> Lynne!
I don't get the Lynne thing.<eos> Why "Lynne"? I thought you hated "Lynne."<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Just let me get through.<eos> Wilson.
Was I wrong?<eos> What do you want, Wilson?<eos> My dad died and... Robert moved away, so I'm all alone... now.<eos> I miss you, Pippi.<eos> Yeah.
What do you want, Wilson?<eos> My dad died and... Robert moved away, so I'm all alone... now.<eos> I miss you, Pippi.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Shit.
I wasn't supposed to drink.<eos> Can this really be the same Pippi who used to... smoke and drink and curse and fart and belch?<eos> She was a disgusting pig.<eos> Well, there was never a dull moment, that's for sure.<eos> Pippi?
Well, there was never a dull moment, that's for sure.<eos> Pippi?<eos> You were the only person who ever bothered to get to know the real me.<eos> And I knew the real you.<eos> The real Pippi.
Sorry, she's a little bit overprotective.<eos> Shit, I can't believe you still live here.<eos> Oh, I know, it's great, but... you know, I can't help but think it would've been great if you just... had the baby, and then we'd... still have lived together all those years.<eos> And who knows what our life might have been like.<eos> P T.A. meetings...
Shit, I can't believe you still live here.<eos> Oh, I know, it's great, but... you know, I can't help but think it would've been great if you just... had the baby, and then we'd... still have lived together all those years.<eos> And who knows what our life might have been like.<eos> P T.A. meetings...<eos> Guinea pigs...
You're totally out of your mind, man.<eos> If you had had the baby, it would have forced us to grow up.<eos> You know?<eos> I did have the baby.<eos> What?
When I talked to you on the phone... I pictured some guy with an Army buddy on the force...<eos> He gets all his info from a blind guy on the corner...<eos> Nope. Nope.<eos> Where the hell's that goddamn file?<eos> Cocksucker!
Where the hell's that goddamn file?<eos> Cocksucker!<eos> Oh, here's what I got.<eos> "Claire Cassiday, Parker Day High School."<eos> You sure about that?
Here we go.<eos> Fish and chips.<eos> Enjoy, guys.<eos> When are you done?<eos> Wilson.
Where do you come up with this shit?<eos> Why the hell do people move to the suburbs?<eos> It's like a living death.<eos> Wilson, what are we doing?<eos> What?
I told you.<eos> I just want to get a glimpse of her.<eos> But you just saw her!<eos> Get down! Down, down.<eos> Shit.
Shit.<eos> Okay, up, up.<eos> Wilson, just let this go.<eos> No, we got to go.<eos> Wilson!
Cool it, Wilson.<eos> Jesus.<eos> We made that.<eos> Hey, it's Claire.<eos> Hi, Claire.
I'm sorry, what did you say to me?<eos> Oh, no.<eos> What did you say to me, bitch?<eos> Hey, Claire, Jenny Craig's over here.<eos> Fat-ass bitch!
You need to shut the fuck up, you little prick!<eos> Watch yourself, asshole.<eos> No, you watch it!<eos> That's my daughter!<eos> Wilson, not now!
Watch yourself, asshole.<eos> No, you watch it!<eos> That's my daughter!<eos> Wilson, not now!<eos> Bad timing!
No, you watch it!<eos> That's my daughter!<eos> Wilson, not now!<eos> Bad timing!<eos> You little son of a bitch!
Get off me, asshole!<eos> Let go!<eos> No! I'm not letting go!<eos> Let it go!<eos> Wilson!
Don't get bogged down in the details right now.<eos> We're just thrilled to finally have the opportunity to get to meet you!<eos> And if you're wondering about the lack of family resemblance... you couldn't tell it by looking at her, but she used to be a real hippo.<eos> Your grandpa wrote a well-regarded novel about Melville, and... Pippi's maternal grandfather was a famous judge in Ohio, and...<eos> Shit!
You were... glowing.<eos> I guess it was good we got to see her, right?<eos> I feel like maybe I can stop worrying.<eos> And I'll let her go.<eos> Thanks.
She certainly doesn't need any help from us.<eos> It's like she has that miserable, anguished look... like you had when I first met you.<eos> Of course, you turned out okay.<eos> In the long run.<eos> Oh, Pippi.

Of course, you turned out okay.<eos> In the long run.<eos> Oh, Pippi.<eos> Oh, Pippi!<eos> Hi, there.
No.<eos> What the hell's wrong?<eos> Hey, come on, hop in.<eos> I'll give you a ride.<eos> No, thanks.
I'll give you a ride.<eos> No, thanks.<eos> I'll get the bus.<eos> No, no, I'll give you a ride.<eos> Claire!
It's a badge of honor.<eos> However... that does not mean that you have to sit back and get reamed for four years.<eos> So is there one particular asshole?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Monika the bitch.

So is there one particular asshole?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Monika the bitch.<eos> Monika?<eos> Monika.
Monika the bitch.<eos> Monika?<eos> Monika.<eos> Now, is there like a creepy teacher or janitor or...?<eos> Mr. Naisbitt.
You see how that rhymed?<eos> That's just a bonus.<eos> No, "you blow Mr. Naisbitt's syphilitic dong "like a harmonica."<eos> Eaugh!<eos> Too far.
No.<eos> No. I'm not doing that, Wilson.<eos> Come on, it'll be fun.<eos> I haven't been there since I was a kid.<eos> Wilson!
And it is our duty to make sure that she doesn't have some major meltdown.<eos> You know?<eos> I mean, can you imagine what she's going through?<eos> No!<eos> No fucking way.
Of course I can't.<eos> Can you?<eos> She's a sweet kid with two crazy people stalking her.<eos> We're not stalking her.<eos> Wilson.
Trust me, I know.<eos> You're an asshole!<eos> Goddamn it!<eos> What is in there?<eos> Pippi?
What is in there?<eos> Pippi?<eos> Goddamn it!<eos> Calm yourself.<eos> Fuck!
You don't!<eos> You don't know shit about shit!<eos> Are you done?<eos> Wow!<eos> So cool!
Any kids?<eos> Yeah.<eos> How old?<eos> They're six and fifteen.<eos> Why?
You know, that's...<eos> Thank you.<eos> Yeah.<eos> You're a wise man.<eos> Nice cock, by the way.
Thank you.<eos> Yeah.<eos> You're a wise man.<eos> Nice cock, by the way.<eos> Pippi?
You're a wise man.<eos> Nice cock, by the way.<eos> Pippi?<eos> They grow up so fast.<eos> Fuck you!
Nice cock, by the way.<eos> Pippi?<eos> They grow up so fast.<eos> Fuck you!<eos> What a day!
Don't you have your phone?<eos> Are you kidding me?<eos> That's unbelievable.<eos> This thing has been right on time for like two weeks.<eos> Shit.
This thing has been right on time for like two weeks.<eos> Shit.<eos> Anyway, time is like, you know...<eos> Here and now is where we're at.<eos> Claire?
Shit.<eos> Anyway, time is like, you know...<eos> Here and now is where we're at.<eos> Claire?<eos> Hey, Dad.
Anyway, time is like, you know...<eos> Here and now is where we're at.<eos> Claire?<eos> Hey, Dad.<eos> Sorry.
Frisbee'd be easier probably.<eos> See ya.<eos> Bye!<eos> Watch out for the bird shit!<eos> Hey, hey, Pepper.
Did you see the way she was looking at you?<eos> Really?<eos> Magical.<eos> Oh, Christ.<eos> Fucking Polly, man.
Oh, Christ.<eos> Fucking Polly, man.<eos> Why can't she leave me alone?<eos> Delete.<eos> Bullshit.
Fucking Polly, man.<eos> Why can't she leave me alone?<eos> Delete.<eos> Bullshit.<eos> What? What?
What if I showed up with you and Claire?<eos> I was at her front door and we're all like, "This is my family, bitch."<eos> I'd love to see her face!<eos> Yes!<eos> Right?
How could anyone not love you?<eos> I bet you can't take two steps on the sidewalk without someone wanting to pet you.<eos> Oh, it is kind of disturbing actually.<eos> It's like...<eos> "Hello there, up here!
"Hello there, up here!<eos> I'm an actual human being.<eos> "I can do math and... "drive a car and cook food and do tiddlywinks... "and masturbate."<eos> I didn't know you were married.<eos> Oh, yeah.
I'm an actual human being.<eos> "I can do math and... "drive a car and cook food and do tiddlywinks... "and masturbate."<eos> I didn't know you were married.<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> Wife, kids, the whole shebang.
You're fucking crazy.<eos> Let's face it, this is pretty great.<eos> Look, even Pippi's happy!<eos> Why not, right?<eos> Fuck!
- That's terrible.<eos> Turn it off.<eos> Turn it off!<eos> Oh, God!<eos> What obnoxious drivel.
Oh, come on, chin up.<eos> This is gonna be fun.<eos> Fuck, we're so late.<eos> Stop.<eos> Oh, honey!
This is gonna be fun.<eos> Fuck, we're so late.<eos> Stop.<eos> Oh, honey!<eos> Hi.
Fuck, we're so late.<eos> Stop.<eos> Oh, honey!<eos> Hi.<eos> Hi.
Stop.<eos> Oh, honey!<eos> Hi.<eos> Hi.<eos> Hi.
Oh, honey!<eos> Hi.<eos> Hi.<eos> Hi.<eos> Hi, Will!
Hi.<eos> Hi, Will!<eos> Remember me?<eos> Of course.<eos> Wilson.
Hi, Will!<eos> Remember me?<eos> Of course.<eos> Wilson.<eos> Oh, you guys...
Of course.<eos> Wilson.<eos> Oh, you guys...<eos> Yeah, this is...<eos> Polly and Will.
And this is your niece, Claire.<eos> Oh, Claire, it's great to meet you.<eos> Come in.<eos> Please.<eos> Wow.
Oh, Claire, it's great to meet you.<eos> Come in.<eos> Please.<eos> Wow.<eos> Sorry.
Hey, Polly... you look great.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I don't mean that in a salacious way at all.<eos> I just think you look great.<eos> Thanks.
I just think you look great.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Don't you think she looks...<eos> You do, too, Will!<eos> Thanks.
Don't you think she looks...<eos> You do, too, Will!<eos> Thanks.<eos> What's the boy's name?<eos> Cooper.
And Jenny's already halfway through law school.<eos> Oh, Christ, I forgot you had another one.<eos> I totally forgot.<eos> So is she my cousin?<eos> Oh, brilliant, Watson!
You see?<eos> Now, that is pure Wilson.<eos> Here's to you, Claire.<eos> And to you, Coop!<eos> Coop!
Coop!<eos> Why Golf Matters.<eos> I feel like I'm doing fieldwork among the natives or something.<eos> We shouldn't have come here.<eos> What?
Oh, well, I...<eos> Some of my best times with my mom were spent, um... not saying a word, just... just sitting together in the same room... feeling... the connection.<eos> Like a chemical thing.<eos> You know, I always used to try to imagine what you were like.<eos> My "real dad."
Nah.<eos> You're cool.<eos> They went for a walk.<eos> Oh, God.<eos> Thanks.
You're cool.<eos> They went for a walk.<eos> Oh, God.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Pippi.
And I know that I've said some negative things about Wilson in the past, but...<eos> So, what are Claire's real parents like?<eos> Are they okay?<eos> Amazing.<eos> Super rich.
Amazing.<eos> Super rich.<eos> Super well-educated.<eos> Yeah, they got a big house.<eos> Like... way bigger than this place.
You're a fucking cunt!<eos> When you're a kid, you have all this future. This potential.<eos> But when you get to be my age, you kind of look at things in a different way.<eos> You're kind of living more in the moment.<eos> Things like this lake and the ducks...
Shit like this becomes so damn huge.<eos> Fuck you!<eos> Get away from me, Pippi! Oh, oh, oh!<eos> Stop it!<eos> Pippi!
Get away from me, Pippi! Oh, oh, oh!<eos> Stop it!<eos> Pippi!<eos> I'm getting fucking tired of this bullshit!<eos> No, Pippi!
Pippi!<eos> I'm getting fucking tired of this bullshit!<eos> No, Pippi!<eos> Oh, oh, oh!<eos> A little woodland creature.
Big drinkers, though.<eos> Big, huge drinkers.<eos> There he is!<eos> - Come here.<eos> - What?
- Come here.<eos> - What?<eos> - Get over here.<eos> - What's going on?<eos> Guys?
- What's going on?<eos> Guys?<eos> No, I didn't do anything!<eos> Wilson... I lost it.<eos> - Pippi?
Just don't say anything.<eos> Polly!<eos> It's called kidnapping!<eos> Sit down.<eos> Pippi?
Polly!<eos> It's called kidnapping!<eos> Sit down.<eos> Pippi?<eos> Claire?
What'd you say, bitch?<eos> No, I'm not...<eos> I like it.<eos> It's like an acknowledgement to a whole other generation...<eos> Hi.
A believer stuck 10 years in the shoe... is freer than any man who disdains the Word.<eos> That is beautiful, beautiful stuff.<eos> Have you always been a... God-fearing man, Pastor?<eos> I've tried to be.<eos> Oh, what a gift.
Well, yeah, I guess. I mean, at a certain point... no rational man's gonna buy into all this crazy mumbo jumbo.<eos> Let's be realistic. You got to have it ingrained... before you develop any real sense of, you know... reason.<eos> I mean, unless you... get brain damage or something.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Oh, hello, brother.
He restoreth my soul.<eos> So I grabbed this asshole by the lapels... and I said, "Look, I don't care if you are a nun...<eos> "I'm gonna fucking, shit, fucking punch..."<eos> Fuck, yeah!<eos> Wassup, bro? Hey.
Fuck, yeah!<eos> Wassup, bro? Hey.<eos> How you doing, man?<eos> You staying out of trouble?<eos> Yo, Wilson!
How you doing, man?<eos> You staying out of trouble?<eos> Yo, Wilson!<eos> Wassup, man?<eos> Hey, man.
Gave me the shits earlier.<eos> There's more pieces than there is puzzle left.<eos> Look.<eos> These are that color and there ain't no blanks in that color.<eos> Hey, Wilson!
Look.<eos> These are that color and there ain't no blanks in that color.<eos> Hey, Wilson!<eos> You got a visitor.<eos> A what?
I can't believe it's you.<eos> It's me.<eos> It's two and a half years.<eos> I never heard a word.<eos> I...
But you're here now.<eos> I am.<eos> And I have to thank you, Wilson.<eos> You believed in me when nobody else ever did.<eos> Oh, Pippi.
What did...?<eos> I just... Could you...?<eos> Did you...?<eos> Did you...?<eos> Tucker?
But we went through a lot.<eos> So... I think you'd like him, Wilson.<eos> Yeah, I'm sure I...<eos> I'm sure I would.<eos> Hey.
I'm sure I would.<eos> Hey.<eos> Maybe we don't have to be miserable forever.<eos> Maybe we could find our way to being happy.<eos> Pippi?
I don't know.<eos> Nothing.<eos> Tell me, friend, have you heard the good news?<eos> Oh, no, I'm...<eos> No, thanks.
Are you headed to school?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Oh, good for you.<eos> Good boy.
Good boy.<eos> Yeah, I'm just headed home.<eos> Just me and a mangy old dog, if she even... remembers me.<eos> That's her.<eos> Oh, sorry...
"Cyndi's Cupcakery?"<eos> What happened to the used bookstore?<eos> Is that you, Diana?<eos> It's me, Wilson.<eos> Pepper's dad!
What happened to the used bookstore?<eos> Is that you, Diana?<eos> It's me, Wilson.<eos> Pepper's dad!<eos> Hi.
You can't believe what happened to me, Shelly.<eos> Where's all your dog stuff?<eos> Well, I'm not sitting anymore.<eos> So where is she?<eos> Pepper?
You were a true friend.<eos> Every minute in your presence was a blessing and your joy over the simplest of pleasures was humbling and inspirational.<eos> You were the pride of the neighborhood, the brightener of a thousand days.<eos> To see a stranger's eyes tear at the memory of a similar pet is to know the inherent goodness of your kind.<eos> You...
To see a stranger's eyes tear at the memory of a similar pet is to know the inherent goodness of your kind.<eos> You...<eos> Urinated.<eos> Urinated... on my address book and chewed up two sofas...<eos> Three.
Three, but... in doing so, you taught us the utter worthlessness of those things.<eos> We celebrate you, Pepper.<eos> You and all your brothers and sisters in the animal family.<eos> We vow to honor and protect your kind and oppose with all our heart those... who would harm or degrade any living creature in any way.<eos> Amen.
You and all your brothers and sisters in the animal family.<eos> We vow to honor and protect your kind and oppose with all our heart those... who would harm or degrade any living creature in any way.<eos> Amen.<eos> So whatever happened with you and Francisco?<eos> Diego?
Like I never existed at all.<eos> It's horrible.<eos> I just have to...<eos> It might be George about tomorrow.<eos> Hello?
No. No.<eos> Look, he has no interest in talking to you, and we'd... just prefer if you don't call this number anymore, okay?<eos> Thank you.<eos> Who the hell was that?<eos> Wow.
Look, he has no interest in talking to you, and we'd... just prefer if you don't call this number anymore, okay?<eos> Thank you.<eos> Who the hell was that?<eos> Wow.<eos> Hi.
Who the hell was that?<eos> Wow.<eos> Hi.<eos> You look so... grown up.<eos> Thanks.
But I mean, you're just a kid yourself.<eos> Don't start with that.<eos> I get enough of that shit from everybody else.<eos> I just...<eos> A baby?
Don't start with that.<eos> I get enough of that shit from everybody else.<eos> I just...<eos> A baby?<eos> A baby.
They don't need any more stress right now.<eos> Let me just pet him.<eos> Sit tight.<eos> I'll be there in 10 minutes. Hi!<eos> Hello!
Hello!<eos> You are such a beautiful girl.<eos> Excuse me. I got to go.<eos> Wilson, she has to...<eos> Wilson!
Excuse me. I got to go.<eos> Wilson, she has to...<eos> Wilson!<eos> I really love you.<eos> Hey, dude.
Wilson, she needs to go.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> She has to leave.<eos> Wilson, she needs to leave.<eos> Wilson!
Thanks for taking care of my baby.<eos> You... did an amazing job.<eos> Yes.<eos> Um, you know, actually it's okay.<eos> Yeah, false alarm.
Yes.<eos> Um, you know, actually it's okay.<eos> Yeah, false alarm.<eos> No, I'm sorry.<eos> Thanks very much.
No, I'm sorry.<eos> Thanks very much.<eos> What are you still doing here?<eos> My mom said you were beating off.<eos> No, I...
Please?<eos> I don't think so.<eos> Please, Claire?<eos> I wouldn't be in your way.<eos> Claire?
I did say that.<eos> Before this, I was screwed.<eos> And when it was all said and done, figured I'd just die and be forgotten.<eos> A handful of ashes dumped in the ocean.<eos> Hi.
Did he not study with Mordred himself?<eos> What are you implying?<eos> I was sent to study with him by my father as a token of diplomacy.<eos> We would only seek to remind Your Majesty that it was a Mage, Merlin, who gave you the great sword.<eos> Light!
- Enough!<eos> Loose!<eos> There will be no more killings. There will be no more purges. Am I clear, brother?<eos> Now leave me.<eos> Peace?
My darling, tell me what it is.<eos> Tell me what it is, and I'll make it stop.<eos> It's okay.<eos> Untie the skiff.<eos> King Vortigern!
Come on!<eos> Run, son!<eos> Step aside for the king.<eos> Get them back to work.<eos> Sire.
Run, son!<eos> Step aside for the king.<eos> Get them back to work.<eos> Sire.<eos> Sergeant!
Get them back to work.<eos> Sire.<eos> Sergeant!<eos> Get them under manners!<eos> Still so handsome, my king.
- Open the door!<eos> - Hey.<eos> Open in the name of the king!<eos> Open it.<eos> Yes, gentlemen?
Open it.<eos> Yes, gentlemen?<eos> A turner come down this way.<eos> We're searching all houses.<eos> Whoa.
Whoa.<eos> Slow down, new boy, before you trip up.<eos> What did you say?<eos> I'm gonna take your hands for that.<eos> Sergeant!
What's this all about, Jack?<eos> What's it got to do with us?<eos> Do you have any idea who that man is?<eos> For a man who's so popular, I'm surprised I don't.<eos> Goosefat Bill.
I went downstairs, I saw the girls.<eos> Lucy was missing.<eos> Where's Lucy?<eos> - She's a good girl.<eos> - A nice girl.
That's the spoil from the boats.<eos> - Then? - Then we heard...<eos> George had trouble again last night.<eos> All right, meet me out the front.<eos> Which George?
- Then? - Then we heard...<eos> George had trouble again last night.<eos> All right, meet me out the front.<eos> Which George?<eos> King George? Angry George?
Which George?<eos> King George? Angry George?<eos> George of the Dragon?<eos> Be clear, Arthur. - Which George?<eos> - Our George.
King George? Angry George?<eos> George of the Dragon?<eos> Be clear, Arthur. - Which George?<eos> - Our George.<eos> Chinese George, Kung-Fu George.
George of the Dragon?<eos> Be clear, Arthur. - Which George?<eos> - Our George.<eos> Chinese George, Kung-Fu George.<eos> - George?
Be clear, Arthur. - Which George?<eos> - Our George.<eos> Chinese George, Kung-Fu George.<eos> - George?<eos> - Art.
They don't speak English good.<eos> They speak it better than you.<eos> Hold up, hold up.<eos> Are you sure you didn't see someone else before you saw George?<eos> Morning, Art.
Hold up, hold up.<eos> Are you sure you didn't see someone else before you saw George?<eos> Morning, Art.<eos> We saw Mike.<eos> All right, Mike.
Are you sure you didn't see someone else before you saw George?<eos> Morning, Art.<eos> We saw Mike.<eos> All right, Mike.<eos> Mike the Spike?
Morning, Art.<eos> We saw Mike.<eos> All right, Mike.<eos> Mike the Spike?<eos> Kosher Mike?
We saw Mike.<eos> All right, Mike.<eos> Mike the Spike?<eos> Kosher Mike?<eos> Which Mike?
Mike the Spike?<eos> Kosher Mike?<eos> Which Mike?<eos> You're giving me a headache.<eos> Flat-Nose Mike.
It won't happen again.<eos> I promise.<eos> You're all right, Mike. Why have enemies when you can have friends?<eos> - Where'd you put the money?<eos> - What money? - Money?
- Did he pay?<eos> - 'Course he paid.<eos> He's a good boy, that Mike.<eos> Buy some lessons in street etiquette with the change.<eos> - Change?
He'll cut 'em off and have you in chains.<eos> If we can catch you, they can catch you.<eos> If you can catch him, so can we.<eos> Should we go back to George, and the trouble with the...<eos> - Vikings.
- So what happened?<eos> Started throwing their weight about, and then Lucy got the worst of it.<eos> - Come again, George?<eos> - They hurt Lucy.<eos> - My Lucy?
- Come here. I want your opinion.<eos> Maggie represents the people.<eos> She's from one of the oldest families in England.<eos> She can tell us.<eos> Sire.
Listen!<eos> You need to get out of here, now!<eos> What are you doing, Lack?<eos> Jack's Eye was telling the truth. Those red beards are connected.<eos> So, what?
Kick the door down!<eos> - Are you ready?<eos> - Yeah, of course.<eos> Here we go.<eos> All right, fellas?
Well, when you see the king, why don't you ask him?<eos> Move along!<eos> What was that?<eos> God save the king.<eos> Bollocks.
Excuse me.<eos> Behind you, pal.<eos> Here, mind your back.<eos> Oi, pal, there's a line here.<eos> John.
We got what information we could.<eos> Got a lot of fingers in a lot of pies.<eos> Blacklegs in his pockets, too.<eos> I'll deal with this.<eos> My king...
I will show them power.<eos> I will show them strength and dignity.<eos> You will show them lies, weakness, and shame.<eos> Hail, King Vortigern!<eos> King Vortigern!
They may even hate me.<eos> I'll let them hate just so long as they fear.<eos> When people fear you, I mean, really fear you, it is the most intoxicating sensation a man can possess.<eos> A force of something almost indescribable moves through your blood and takes you over completely.<eos> King Vortigern! King Vortigern! King Vortigern!
A force of something almost indescribable moves through your blood and takes you over completely.<eos> King Vortigern! King Vortigern! King Vortigern!<eos> I understand that your actions were very noble, of defending this whore's honor.<eos> How unfortunate it was at the expense of my Viking guests.<eos> King Vortigern! King Vortigern! King Vortigern!
- Move!<eos> Move!<eos> Get the sword!<eos> Get after him!<eos> The sword!
We wanna be careful.<eos> That's a neat trick.<eos> You'll have to teach me how to do that.<eos> Put him back on his horse.<eos> Oh, hello.
Oh, hello.<eos> It's quite dangerous being one of you lot, isn't it?<eos> You're good with animals, aren't you?<eos> They have a word for that, don't they?<eos> "Mage."
Never met one of you in the flesh.<eos> I thought you'd be taller.<eos> And have a beard.<eos> You do know I can see through this?<eos> Trees everywhere.
No!<eos> Run, son!<eos> Did you see everything you needed to see?<eos> I saw enough.<eos> The Mage Tower.
Now, the sword is yours.<eos> It seems his people have been found by the Resistance.<eos> You have 10,000 men under your command for the purpose of maintaining public order.<eos> Informants have been incentivized.<eos> - Mercia...
- Mercia...<eos> - Our garrisons are patrolling the roads and searching every town.<eos> - It's only a matter of time, Your Majesty.<eos> - Mercia. The Resistance have never posed any real threat.<eos> Mercia!
You're wasting your time.<eos> I've told you they're uncrackable.<eos> See, Wet Stick, Back Lack?<eos> That's what an education gets ya.<eos> My sincere apologies, Your Majesty.
Burn his favorite palace down.<eos> How you gonna do that, then?<eos> I know the man that supplies brandy to the palace.<eos> Shipment first of the month.<eos> All right, Dan. Wine or brandy? - Brandy.
You will face it when it's worth it to you.<eos> Don't get me wrong, I look away.<eos> We all look away.<eos> But that is the difference between a man and a king.<eos> Maggie!
Well, we can't see them. And they can't see us. Hey!<eos> Maybe they thought that was luck.<eos> That could've killed us.<eos> They scream like girls, your friends.<eos> Bill?
They scream like girls, your friends.<eos> Bill?<eos> The wolf at the head of the pack.<eos> Goosefat, everything all right?<eos> - Goosefat!
You are a cunning old bastard, Vortigern.<eos> But what you fail to understand is that it's you who's fed the hangman that will eventually come for you.<eos> You're right, that's not Vortigern.<eos> But at least Mercia's here.<eos> Goosefat.
You can't shoot if it's a trap!<eos> They'll never know where that came from.<eos> You missed him anyway.<eos> I didn't miss anyone.<eos> Arrow!
That was Clarendon.<eos> You might survive today.<eos> But the noose has been tied.<eos> We need to go. Now!<eos> Now.
Wait, wait. Hey, hey, hey.<eos> Where are you going?<eos> Oi!<eos> Oi!<eos> Sarge!
Where are you going?<eos> Oi!<eos> Oi!<eos> Sarge!<eos> Hey!
Move!<eos> Move! - Move!<eos> - Move!<eos> Get out of the way!<eos> Left!
Come on.<eos> There's too many.<eos> Come on! Come on, guys!<eos> Can you make it?<eos> Over here!
We don't have time to argue, Bill.<eos> Some of us will make it out in time.<eos> Some of us won't. Well, better some than none!<eos> You go first.<eos> Mike!
Scared of the dark. Really?<eos> George, will you tell them?<eos> Sorry, boss.<eos> Weapons!<eos> You silly bastards.
Determined to die.<eos> Shit. On my command!<eos> I'm going down the hole now.<eos> After you.<eos> Blue.
We got split up, but he knows his way.<eos> - I've gotta find him.<eos> - Wait, Blue. Your dad knows what he's doing.<eos> He'll be back before you know it, mate.<eos> Blue!
- I've gotta find him.<eos> - Wait, Blue. Your dad knows what he's doing.<eos> He'll be back before you know it, mate.<eos> Blue!<eos> Blue!
Come on, Blue.<eos> You carry this.<eos> Come on.<eos> Come on, Blue.<eos> Evenin'.
Never seen him before.<eos> I usually come in later, you know, do the dishes when they're all gone.<eos> Is that the truth?<eos> Yes, sir. I'd never lie to a Blackleg.<eos> Good boy.
Is that the truth?<eos> Yes, sir. I'd never lie to a Blackleg.<eos> Good boy.<eos> So you don't know him?<eos> No, sir.
Then you wouldn't mind if I cut his ears off?<eos> They're not my ears.<eos> No!<eos> Always wanted a boy.<eos> - Argh! - You bastard!
Take the boy and...<eos> No!<eos> No!<eos> Crush the Resistance tonight!<eos> Archers!
No!<eos> Crush the Resistance tonight!<eos> Archers!<eos> Let me show you what your uncle will do if you do not accept<eos> this sword.
All right.<eos> Now, when you say we're going to take the castle, what does that mean?<eos> I thought you said you weren't gonna push me.<eos> Come on, lads.<eos> Blue!
Now, when you say we're going to take the castle, what does that mean?<eos> I thought you said you weren't gonna push me.<eos> Come on, lads.<eos> Blue!<eos> Blue!
You have won.<eos> Now, play with me.<eos> I think that sword belongs to me now.<eos> Run, son!<eos> Brother...
You created me.<eos> And, for that, I bless you.<eos> You make sense of the devil.<eos> Nock!<eos> Light!
And, for that, I bless you.<eos> You make sense of the devil.<eos> Nock!<eos> Light!<eos> Ready!
It would be my honor.<eos> Well, now that's out the way, let's eat.<eos> Why have enemies, when you can have friends?<eos> Arise, my king.<eos> King Arthur.
Help people by lifting their heads.<eos> It's not all real.<eos> I thought you had to know the right people... get close to them.<eos> The ones who could give you what you need... to get through the fence.<eos> Oh!
This is the Doctor.<eos> Have a party for him every year.<eos> Celebrate.<eos> To the Doctor.<eos> Eternity.
You had to pick one.<eos> There's one girl in a...<eos> What's your name?<eos> ♪ Well... ♪ Let's go from the top again, just 'cause I want your tongue to be three times the size it should be.<eos> Yes, sir.
Oh!<eos> Okay-<eos> But does he play out, like, make money playing and stuff'?<eos> - He does'?<eos> - Mm-hmm.
But does he play out, like, make money playing and stuff'?<eos> - He does'?<eos> - Mm-hmm.<eos> So he's a working musician?<eos> - Mm-hmm.
And how come he's letting you stay at his place?<eos> You shouldn't trust him.<eos> Why not?<eos> I just think you should be careful.<eos> Ladies and gentlemen...
I don't like it.<eos> It's all for sale.<eos> All of it... honors, titles.<eos> What do you see?<eos> Pool?
It's all just free fall.<eos> You have too much pride.<eos> I thought pride was a good thing.<eos> People aren't proud enough.<eos> Selfish!
You have too much pride.<eos> I thought pride was a good thing.<eos> People aren't proud enough.<eos> Selfish!<eos> Arrogant!
And it was beautiful, and it was difficult.<eos> And I thought I would be with him for the rest of my life.<eos> But he died.<eos> I wanted to escape from every tie.<eos> Every hold.
Let's us decide what's right now.<eos> - What do you think of this world?<eos> - It's its own.<eos> You know I felt terrible about that.<eos> Beer...
- What do you think of this world?<eos> - It's its own.<eos> You know I felt terrible about that.<eos> Beer...<eos> M'dear?
That was the first time in my life that I knew.<eos> Everything came from that hour.<eos> I wish that it could last forever.<eos> They have a beauty in their life... that makes me ugly.<eos> A joy.
- Help me. Help me.<eos> - Let me put these down.<eos> What can I get for you?<eos> - I have a condition.<eos> - Yes'?
- 'Cause my boss is watching.<eos> - Which other table?<eos> - You're gonna get me fired.<eos> - Yep, that's the plan.<eos> You...
Oh! Well...<eos> I was a teacher, but there's not many jobs around here.<eos> - What do you teach?<eos> - Kindergarten.<eos> - Oh, yeah?
- if I didn't like kids, would it'?<eos> So you like physical things?<eos> Yes.<eos> I was shy.<eos> This concert.
Yes.<eos> I was shy.<eos> This concert.<eos> Who's on first?<eos> This concert!
You don't like to say it.<eos> I love you.<eos> I'm so scared sometimes.<eos> We're wanderers, you and I.<eos> Like birds.
- Get outta here.<eos> - Come on.<eos> - You got a weird way of showing it.<eos> - Come on.<eos> - What'?
- Come on.<eos> - You got a weird way of showing it.<eos> - Come on.<eos> - What'?<eos> - We partners?
You've got... you got... you got it in the bag.<eos> I don't think that... I don't think that takes care of everything, darling.<eos> Have you seen your father?<eos> - Have I seen him?<eos> - Mm-hmm.
Not anymore.<eos> - Why?<eos> - What's the point?<eos> I met him on the street today, and he, um... said that he wanted to sign me.<eos> Wow.
How to yearn.<eos> Stay.<eos> You're casting spells.<eos> Does it work?<eos> - Mm-hmm.
Are you gonna miss me?<eos> Do you want me to stay?<eos> I can't ask you that.<eos> Well, then I gotta go.<eos> Foolish me.
Do you want me to stay?<eos> I can't ask you that.<eos> Well, then I gotta go.<eos> Foolish me.<eos> Devil.
I don't deserve you.<eos> The shame of it.<eos> Things changed.<eos> You became suspicious.<eos> Stupid girl.
Did you do it?<eos> Yes.<eos> You did what he told you to do?<eos> I wanna live a good life.<eos> Hmm?
We would express that generosity not just in this moment or on this campus, but as we have opportunity every day throughout our community and our city, around our state, even across our borders.<eos> And we will be known as a generous people.<eos> And we bless even as we have been blessed.<eos> For we ask this in Your Son's name.<eos> Amen.
Open your eyes.<eos> Right here you know.<eos> You won't die.<eos> Here I reign.<eos> King.
- Ls this your dog?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Can I say hi?<eos> - Yeah, of course.<eos> - Hi there.
What's your name?<eos> Look at you.<eos> Stuff like that.<eos> You what? What?<eos> - Like, uh, uh, house-sit.

Dying and being reborn...<eos> The light is so beautiful on your face.<eos> You have one part of your face in the shadows and one part in the light.<eos> - Are you scared?<eos> - Mm-mm.
I hear you have songs on the radio and you're meant for better things.<eos> It'd be awful to have these good times and not have life itself.<eos> I wanna meet you before you move on<eos> - and leave us behind.<eos> - Mm-hmm.
I'm scared.<eos> They play with sex.<eos> They make it cheap.<eos> Maybe you need this world.<eos> The falsehood, the show.
- She's kidding, ma.<eos> - Oh.<eos> - Oh, it was a joke.<eos> Not very funny.<eos> Cheers.
I used to think I could never be wicked.<eos> Wicked before. A long way out for me. So much to seek to be consoled as to understand, to be loved as to love.<eos> For it is in giving that we receive.<eos> It is in pardoning...<eos> - Bang.

I knew how destroyed...<eos> I was.<eos> Forgive me.<eos> In that time, did she have any medical history or medication?<eos> About her mental health issues?
I'm not doing anything wrong, am I?<eos> - By talking to you?<eos> There's something on your face.<eos> Did you get it?<eos> - Huh?
There's something on your face.<eos> Did you get it?<eos> - Huh?<eos> - Did you get it?<eos> Mm-mm.
Do you want it to...?<eos> But slower.<eos> It's a love story.<eos> Excuse... excuse me.<eos> Hey.
But slower.<eos> It's a love story.<eos> Excuse... excuse me.<eos> Hey.<eos> Hi.
Hey.<eos> Hi.<eos> Is this happening?<eos> Who was that girl I saw you with at the hotel?<eos> Just a girl.
Hi.<eos> Is this happening?<eos> Who was that girl I saw you with at the hotel?<eos> Just a girl.<eos> A woman.
Just a girl.<eos> A woman.<eos> Why you smiling?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Wow.
Wow.<eos> I don't have to tell you that kind of thing.<eos> Oh, I didn't realize there was something not to tell.<eos> She was your girlfriend?<eos> Mm-hmm.
What happened?<eos> I went out with her, and I never called her again.<eos> Did you love her?<eos> I didn't realize it at the time.<eos> Mm-hmm.
I didn't realize it at the time.<eos> Mm-hmm.<eos> Don't smile.<eos> Well...<eos> - You ready?
Every doubt.<eos> You found me.<eos> You held out your hand.<eos> I took sex.<eos> A gift.
Fight for him.<eos> If you really love him... don't let him get away.<eos> "For Mercy has a human heart;<eos> Pity, a human face;<eos> And Love, the human form divine:
Prays to the human form...<eos> Love, Mercy, Pity, Peace.<eos> And all must love the human form, in heathen, Turk, or Jew..."<eos> - Want him on your shoulder?<eos> - Mm-hmm.
And all must love the human form, in heathen, Turk, or Jew..."<eos> - Want him on your shoulder?<eos> - Mm-hmm.<eos> It was like a new paradise.<eos> Forgiveness.
Mom's gone crazy.<eos> Brother's up to no good.<eos> I won't stop loving you.<eos> I don't think I can.<eos> BV...
BV...<eos> It's complicated.<eos> There you are.<eos> I gotta go back and start over.<eos> Like a kid.
You wanna go back to a simple life.<eos> I want the same.<eos> Let nothing come between us.<eos> Ever.<eos> This.

This is not a discussion, Tennessee.<eos> The terraforming module is stable, but the connecting strut took some damage.<eos> I still need to check the vehicles.<eos> I can help... if you like.<eos> Thanks.
Open airlock 17.<eos> Open door to Terraforming Bay.<eos> Slack.<eos> Tension is at 15% down.<eos> Arming.
This was his favorite.<eos> A man of taste.<eos> Straight up.<eos> No ice, no water, no chaser... No shit.<eos> Walter?
When in Rome.<eos> To all the good people, gone too soon.<eos> May we remember them.<eos> Remember them.<eos> Chris.
All good, Tee?<eos> All right.<eos> We're clear.<eos> Reel her in.<eos> All right.
Come on in.<eos> Don't leave without me now.<eos> Permission to leave without him, sir?<eos> Welcome back, Danny.<eos> Thanks.
Permission to leave without him, sir?<eos> Welcome back, Danny.<eos> Thanks.<eos> All right, that's me done, Tee.<eos> All right.
I'm coming in.<eos> A rogue transmission, most probably.<eos> Your helmet must have picked it up because you were so far out... past our communication buffers.<eos> Is there audio, Mother?<eos> Collating.
That would be an echo.<eos> The instruments took a lot of damage.<eos> Been happening every 46 seconds ever since we got here.<eos> To the place I belong...<eos> West Virginia, mountain momma...
Mother, please track the signal to its source.<eos> Working.<eos> Source of transmission located.<eos> Signal originates in Sector 87.<eos> Right ascension 47.6.

That's one hell of a sleep cycle.<eos> Sir, I think it's safe to say that none of us are too keen... on getting back into one of those pods.<eos> Maybe we need to... take a closer look.<eos> Any objections?<eos> Okay, Ricks.
Do you understand?<eos> As your second, I need to protest.<eos> Officially.<eos> Officially?<eos> Okay, Danny.
Gonna be safe to land?<eos> Depends on what you call safe.<eos> T-minus 20 seconds.<eos> Let's let her rip.<eos> All right.

Come in!<eos> - Ledward, come on.<eos> - I can't.<eos> Almost there, you see? Straight ahead.<eos> Faris!

Perfectly.<eos> I'll explain as best I can.<eos> Ten years ago, Dr. Elizabeth Shaw and I arrived here... the only survivors of the Prometheus.<eos> The ship we traveled on carried a weapon.<eos> A deadly virus.
How many colonists?<eos> Over two thousand.<eos> Well, well, well.<eos> So many good souls.<eos> Captain Oram.
Everyone, let's set up a staging area here.<eos> There's so much here that doesn't make sense.<eos> I'll talk to him.<eos> Brother to brother.<eos> Tennessee?

I'm not surprised.<eos> Come on, sport. I'd like to show you something.<eos> I'm gonna take a break, boss.<eos> I gotta clean up, okay?<eos> Okay.
I gotta clean up, okay?<eos> Okay.<eos> Right. Don't go far, please.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Danny.
We're not going to let that happen, right?<eos> - Right? - That's right.<eos> That's right, that's right.<eos> We need your faith.<eos> Captain.

So, David, you're gonna tell me exactly what's going on... or I am going to seriously... fuck up your perfect composure.<eos> As you wish, Captain.<eos> This way.<eos> It's good to hear your voice, Tee.<eos> How long?
- Strip the extra weight?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> We'll be there, Ground Team.<eos> Great.<eos> Thanks, Tee.
I'm so sorry.<eos> As you can see, I've become a bit of an amateur zoologist over the years.<eos> It's in my nature to keep busy, I suppose.<eos> The pathogen took so many forms... and was extremely mutable.<eos> Fiendishly inventive, in fact.
Ten years on, all that remains outside... of the original virus are these gorgeous beasts.<eos> Patience is everything.<eos> From the eggs came these parasites... shock troops of the genetic assault.<eos> Waiting for a host, entering the host... rewriting the DNA... and ultimately... producing... these enviable unions.<eos> My beautiful bestiary.
Take a look.<eos> Something to see.<eos> Rosenthal, come in.<eos> Rosie, report.<eos> Rosie?
Patch her through.<eos> Tee, I need you to launch now.<eos> Aye, aye. Launching now.<eos> See you soon, darling.<eos> Thanks, Tee.

Sarge, you are not going down there.<eos> You're right.<eos> I'm not. We are.<eos> - At least call in an air strike.<eos> - Air Strike?
You're right.<eos> I'm not. We are.<eos> - At least call in an air strike.<eos> - Air Strike?<eos> Bad idea.
And then we will do 20 years in Leavenworth for looting.<eos> Hey, what did I tell you?<eos> Hey, We are not looters.<eos> We are liberators of precious antiquities.<eos> - Right.

Where is your sense of adventure?<eos> Oh that's just great, Nick!<eos> That's just great!<eos> Come on, we slip in - slip out, just like we always do.<eos> You son of a bitch!
Let's go! Go... go!<eos> Are you kidding me?<eos> "Slip in - slip out"?<eos> This is not what we always do!<eos> Stairs!
Run!<eos> Run!<eos> Run!<eos> Run!<eos> Grenade!
Don't leave me!<eos> Where do they keep coming from?<eos> There is nowhere to go!<eos> Oh man we are gonna die!<eos> Please, Vail!
Just let me think!<eos> Think about what?<eos> Think about what?<eos> I'm thinking...<eos> What?
I knew it!<eos> I knew it!<eos> I am still alive!<eos> Nick!<eos> Haram.
I am still alive!<eos> Nick!<eos> Haram.<eos> I was told you boys were supposed to be a 100 clicks from here!<eos> Yes, sir!
We had to make the call. Wait for Delta team to respond or go in alone.<eos> It was Sergeant Morton's idea to go in actually!<eos> Only to find out that the villagers had long since evacuated.<eos> Yeah lucky for them, not for us.<eos> Delta, south side perimeter.
Well... Sir, Corporal Vail here is too humble to admit it... But he risked his life to save mine.<eos> He is a hero, in fact...<eos> I'd like to recommend him for a citation.<eos> Let me run another scenario of mine.<eos> Sir?
One in which two assholes from long range reconnaissance that would be you run all over northern Iraq, just one step ahead of the enemy.<eos> Except, instead of hunting for the enemy you hunt for antiquities stealing whatever isn't nailed down and selling it on the black market.<eos> Meanwhile, these fanatical insurgents trying to erase 5,000 years of history unwillingly cover your tracks.<eos> It's a pretty good scam.<eos> Sergeant Morton!

The map you stole from me.<eos> Map?<eos> I do not know what you are talking about.<eos> How would I... had even had the opportunity to steal anything from you, Miss...?<eos> Miss...
Miss...<eos> Sgt. Morton here thinks that I would be too embarrassed to tell you that I had him in my hotel room 3 nights ago, in Baghdad.<eos> And whilst I was sleeping, he went through my things.<eos> I'm not embarrassed, Nick.<eos> Disgusted?
And whilst I was sleeping, he went through my things.<eos> I'm not embarrassed, Nick.<eos> Disgusted?<eos> Yes.<eos> Regretful?
- ...and I did not want to wake her.<eos> - Ok.<eos> And the reward for my gracious consideration?<eos> Well Sir, as you can see "Hell hath no fury".<eos> - Sir.
Is my job to make sure that anything of value stays out of enemy hands.<eos> We have no idea what could be down there.<eos> The content of Tutankhamun's tomb alone were valued at 650 million pounds sterling.<eos> Understand?<eos> Colonel...
- Shut up.<eos> - Okay.<eos> You got two hours, then we're moving out.<eos> You are getting in the hole with him.<eos> - Him?

Get in the damn hole, Vail!<eos> Oh man!<eos> I am in a large antechamber of some kind.<eos> There is an inscription on the northern wall.<eos> The litany of Ra.

Yeah, after it makes you crazy.<eos> There is mercury dripping from the ceiling into holes in the ground.<eos> Possibly to connect the... It's a canal system leading all the way to...<eos> Get the lights!<eos> Oh my God.
There is a ritual barrier chain that's around the well as a warning to intruders.<eos> There isn't a single provision made for someone's journey into the underworld.<eos> No Canopic jars, no Shabtis.<eos> To be buried in a place like this would have been a fate worse than death.<eos> Nick!
We gotta take off.<eos> Tell Greenway we have to notify D.T.R.A.<eos> For what?<eos> - I need specialists from Cairo...<eos> - Cairo?
With or without you! I'm leaving!<eos> It bit me!<eos> Please, Nick!<eos> Can we please, leave?<eos> Nick!
It bit me!<eos> Please, Nick!<eos> Can we please, leave?<eos> Nick!<eos> Nick!
Please, Nick!<eos> Can we please, leave?<eos> Nick!<eos> Nick!<eos> Nick!
Climb by the man!<eos> Climb line is steady.<eos> More towards your nine o'clock!<eos> Holding at 30 feet.<eos> A little more.
That was safely hidden for 5,000 years before you dropped a hellfire missile on it.<eos> And you might have never found it otherwise.<eos> Again... you're welcome.<eos> Do you have any idea what this is?<eos> The significance of it?
Do you have any idea what this is?<eos> The significance of it?<eos> An Egyptian sarcophagus in a tomb in Mesopotamia.<eos> Why just say "15 seconds"?<eos> What of what?
Conducting a preliminary analysis of an Egyptian sarcophagus discovered in the Nineveh province, northern Iraq.<eos> The hieroglyphs are definitely New Kingdom.<eos> It appears that the wife of King Menehptre died in childbirth leaving a sole heir to the throne a girl called Ahmanet.<eos> Corporal, what in the living hell are you doing son?<eos> Vail?

Give me your hand!<eos> Miss Halsey<eos> Miss Halsey, do you think you're up to it.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> What?
Miss Halsey, do you think you're up to it.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> What?<eos> We need your help identifying the body.<eos> Vail!
I'm sorry.<eos> What?<eos> We need your help identifying the body.<eos> Vail!<eos> Hey buddy.
We need to talk, Nick.<eos> What's happening?<eos> You know what's happening.<eos> Am I dead?<eos> Dead?
No.<eos> But you are gonna wish you were.<eos> Come on this way, please.<eos> Oh my God!<eos> Nick.
Coming up on the Aylestord pier now.<eos> Standby.<eos> The pier is a wreck.<eos> It looks like a part of the wing.<eos> A turbine.

- Along with his child.<eos> She made some sort of pact with the God of death.<eos> And then, when I saw those birds and that sandstorm... Whatever I mean something is happening.<eos> You are alive I do not know how.<eos> You... I...
I'll be right back.<eos> Identify, please.<eos> Jennifer.<eos> Get me Henry.<eos> Jennifer.
- Ok this isn't happening.<eos> - I mean really great.<eos> Ok. Really stop.<eos> You know I always thought I had a chance with her.<eos> - What?
The third one was unnecessary.<eos> You freaked me out.<eos> I panicked.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Okay?
Go to your own bathroom!<eos> Yes, it's the ladies room.<eos> What do you mean I'm cursed?<eos> How do you think you survived the crash?<eos> "Setapai".
How do you think you survived the crash?<eos> "Setapai".<eos> You know what it means.<eos> She's got plans for you, Nick.<eos> Plans?
You can't escape.<eos> Help me!<eos> Help me!<eos> Get out of the road, wanker!<eos> Nick!
I think you were right.<eos> - We angered the Gods.<eos> - Wait... what?<eos> I saw her... the chick in the box.<eos> - Ahmanet?
- Wait... what?<eos> I saw her... the chick in the box.<eos> - Ahmanet?<eos> - That one.<eos> - Nick...

- The coffin we found.<eos> - Sarcophagus.<eos> - Whatever.<eos> There was writing on it.<eos> Hieroglyphics.
- Yes.<eos> - Toxic exposure.<eos> How does that explain that I know that "Setapai" means: "My Chosen".<eos> - It's Ancient Egyptian.<eos> - Ancient Egyptian.
- It's Ancient Egyptian.<eos> - Ancient Egyptian.<eos> How do I know that?<eos> You've been in the middle east for years.<eos> What?
You heard it... you forgot it...<eos> Why are you backing off from this?<eos> I'm telling you.<eos> She is real.<eos> Nick.
Nick... what is it?<eos> I think you're right.<eos> I... This is all in my head.<eos> Can't you find the box, look inside ...and when I see a 3,000 years old prune in there...<eos> - Nick.
I think I know where it is.<eos> Charlie 8-1 the base.<eos> We are at impact site, 400m north of Waverley Abbey.<eos> Firefighters control the fire...<eos> Nick.

The crash isn't up that way.<eos> Where are you going?<eos> No.<eos> We are in the right place.<eos> Nick.

I drove right back to her.<eos> Oh my God she is in my head.<eos> Go go go go go!<eos> Get it off of me!<eos> Son of a bitch!

And if evil were a pathogen, to be reasoned then there must surely be a cure.<eos> I would like to, If I may, Mr. Morton to show you something.<eos> Welcome to Prodigium, Mr. Morton.<eos> From the Latin: "Monstrum Vel Prodigium".<eos> "A warning of monsters".
You will have power of life over death.<eos> And you will have me.<eos> I will be your queen.<eos> Just give in.<eos> Nick.
Nick, wake up.<eos> Wake up.<eos> They will kill you just as they killed my chosen before you.<eos> It burns.<eos> What?
Welcome to a new world of Gods and monsters.<eos> Evil has many names, Mr. Morton.<eos> Take Seth, for example. Known to Egyptians as the God of death.<eos> In the Old Testament: Satan, Lucifer.<eos> - The Devil.
Yeah. Bad... bad... gotta...<eos> You see Evil is the shadow that exists just outside our world continuously searching for a way to come in for a way to become flesh and blood.<eos> Either... we wait for that day to arrive or we can fight it on our own terms.<eos> Which brings me to you.<eos> Me?
When one is dealing with the salvation of humanity certain sacrifices must be made.<eos> Excuse me, sir.<eos> They found it.<eos> What found... what?<eos> Henry.
What found... what?<eos> Henry.<eos> Are you planning on killing him?<eos> Kill him?<eos> - Jennifer...
- Kill who?<eos> Mr. Morton here essentially killed himself when he severed the barrier chain that had kept Ahmanet power imprisoned for 5,000 years.<eos> He was chosen as her ideal candidate.<eos> A thief, physically capable, compulsively devious and utterly devoid of soul.<eos> - What?

Now!<eos> - Run, Mr. Morton.<eos> - What?<eos> Run!<eos> Nick!
Stop, Jenny! Stop!<eos> They won't let me out, Nicholas. They never do.<eos> Woah woah what's happening?<eos> Did you just shut down the mercury?<eos> Pete?
I have something more collaborative in mind.<eos> I'm offering you a partnership.<eos> You, evil incarnate. Me, your good friend, Eddie Hyde.<eos> Think about it.<eos> Jenny!
Well done, Mr. Morton.<eos> Well done.<eos> Come on.<eos> We have to destroy the stone.<eos> What?
- ... No curse. - Yes.<eos> I know where it is.<eos> - Wait, wait, which way out?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> Hello?
This is the moment, Nick.<eos> This is the moment!<eos> Yes, you are damn right.<eos> I'm gonna taking that stone, Deliver you to Ahmanet and then my work here is done.<eos> What?

I need you to just stay with me.<eos> Just stay with me.<eos> We'll think of something.<eos> No!<eos> Jenny!
Just stay with me.<eos> We'll think of something.<eos> No!<eos> Jenny!<eos> Jenny!
Jenny!<eos> No!<eos> No!<eos> Let go!<eos> Jenny!
I'm sorry.<eos> We are just never gonna happen.<eos> And it's not me.<eos> It's you.<eos> Thief.
Somewhere in there I know you're a good man.<eos> The world needs a cure.<eos> You can be that cure.<eos> A sacrifice for the greater good!<eos> Jenny.

Goodbye, Jenny.<eos> You were wrong about Nick.<eos> He gave his life to save me.<eos> To bring me back.<eos> Yes, Jennifer.
A good man.<eos> Perhaps.<eos> Yet it has only begun to discover his power.<eos> And we cannot know which side will win out.<eos> Between Darkness and light good or evil.

This story begins in a secret place hidden deep in a forest.<eos> That is a Smurf.<eos> We call him Clumsy.<eos> And this is our village, where there's a Smurf for just about everything.<eos> Like Jokey.
Like Jokey.<eos> Hey, here's a present for you.<eos> Gullible Smurf, you're so gullible.<eos> Actually, I meant to give you this one.<eos> Thanks!

It's about the only girl in our village.<eos> Smurfette.<eos> Hi, Laundry Smurf.<eos> - Howdy-do, Smurfette.<eos> - Hey, guys.
But there was still one problem.<eos> Smurfette's name doesn't tell us anything about her.<eos> Okay, the physics are...<eos> It doesn't tell us who she is.<eos> - High heels.
So, what exactly is a Smurfette?<eos> Well, let me be frank.<eos> She's a rubbish baker.<eos> Let's see.<eos> Smurfette.
Well, let me be frank.<eos> She's a rubbish baker.<eos> Let's see.<eos> Smurfette.<eos> Smurfette, Smurfette, Smurfette.

I love rainbows.<eos> You're not very good at this, are ya?<eos> No, I'm not.<eos> In fact, you're actually kind of bad at it.<eos> Yup.
Yup.<eos> But you're also bad at it.<eos> That's a lie.<eos> You're really, really good at it.<eos> Hi, Brainy.
But you're also bad at it.<eos> That's a lie.<eos> You're really, really good at it.<eos> Hi, Brainy.<eos> Smurfette.

Go ahead, you can say it.<eos> No, no, I just meant that this machine wasn't built for a Smurf of your, well, origins.<eos> Yeah, it's okay.<eos> I get it.<eos> Brainy.

The most potent magical ingredient in the world.<eos> Next slide.<eos> Imagine the power in 100 of them combined.<eos> How I've searched high and low, under every rock, it seems, with no sign of them anywhere.<eos> Not now, Azrael.
I'm in the middle of a lecture.<eos> My plan is simple.<eos> Find Smurf Village, capture all the Smurfs, drain them of their magic and, finally, use that magic to become the most powerful wizard in the world!<eos> Look at me with hair.<eos> What?

Why didn't you say so in the first place?<eos> Blue blazes!<eos> I've spotted Smurfs in the forest!<eos> Well, it's my telescope.<eos> Monty!
No, no!<eos> No, you're going the wrong way!<eos> Yeah!<eos> Oh, no.<eos> My turn!
Don't go.<eos> Wait. Wait, who are you?<eos> Don't be afraid.<eos> Hey, you can't go in there.<eos> - Smurfette!
Wait. Wait, who are you?<eos> Don't be afraid.<eos> Hey, you can't go in there.<eos> - Smurfette!<eos> - Smurfette!
- Smurfette, you okay?<eos> - What happened?<eos> What happened?<eos> I saw a Smurf.<eos> - What?
I saw a Smurf.<eos> - What?<eos> - Who was it?<eos> I don't know, but he was wearing this.<eos> Smurfette!
- What?<eos> - Who was it?<eos> I don't know, but he was wearing this.<eos> Smurfette!<eos> Code blue!
We've gotta get her.<eos> I have a bad feeling about this.<eos> Do you?<eos> Does it have to do with the giant vulture carrying our friend off to Gargamel's lair?<eos> Monty, my regal raptor.
You've done it, you've caught a Smurf.<eos> Give me a kiss.<eos> Finally, you bring me what I've been asking for.<eos> A tiny, blue-skinned, shirtless...<eos> You!
What are you hiding?<eos> Hand it over, you pseudo-Smurf.<eos> Thank you, Azrael.<eos> What do we have here?<eos> A different design?
I know this.<eos> Go left, then right, back handspring, stick the landing.<eos> Is it a person, book or movie?<eos> No one ever understands your hand signals, Hefty.<eos> Never mind.
Yes.<eos> Where?<eos> Where does it come from?<eos> A village of Smurfs, where enchantment grows.<eos> An entire village.
- ...nobody knows.<eos> No!<eos> Just start with that.<eos> Start with "I don't know."<eos> Lousy cheap-o cauldron.
Lousy cheap-o cauldron.<eos> But here is a clue.<eos> Fascinating.<eos> But what is it?<eos> Trees?
And I'll be like...<eos> And they'll be like...<eos> "Run!<eos> No! Run, run, run!"<eos> You evil little genius.
- Wait, Brainy, the map.<eos> - I'm on it.<eos> Fine, maybe 9:30.<eos> Absolutely no later than 10:00, though.<eos> - What the...
Run faster!<eos> Why are our legs so short?<eos> Why are our feet so big?<eos> - Why are my muscles so big?<eos> - Really, man?
Why are our legs so short?<eos> Why are our feet so big?<eos> - Why are my muscles so big?<eos> - Really, man?<eos> Guys!

- Why are my muscles so big?<eos> - Really, man?<eos> Guys!<eos> Guys!<eos> A little help here.
- Yes!<eos> - All right!<eos> Well, I know four Smurfs who have some explaining to do.<eos> - Oh, boy.<eos> - Hi.
Seems to me the only way I can keep you safe is if...<eos> You're grounded.<eos> - Grounded?<eos> No, not grounded!<eos> - What?
- Grounded?<eos> No, not grounded!<eos> - What?<eos> No way!<eos> - But, Papa, but...
No "buts."<eos> None of you are to take one step out of your mushrooms without telling me where you're going.<eos> Do you understand that?<eos> - You're right, Papa.<eos> - What?
Yes.<eos> Right.<eos> Exactly.<eos> I couldn't agree more.<eos> Right, guys?
- Okay, okay.<eos> - Okay, I'm moving.<eos> - What's your endgame here?<eos> Did you get pecked on the noggin, Smurfette?<eos> - Actually, Smurfette...
Yes, but...<eos> Great talk, Papa.<eos> I have no idea what I'm doing.<eos> Hefty, I know that's you.<eos> 'Sup, Smurfette?
Great talk, Papa.<eos> I have no idea what I'm doing.<eos> Hefty, I know that's you.<eos> 'Sup, Smurfette?<eos> Brainy.
'Sup, Smurfette?<eos> Brainy.<eos> How did you do that?<eos> And, I assume, Clumsy.<eos> - All good.
- All good.<eos> - What are you guys doing out here?<eos> We knew you were up to something.<eos> This is all my fault, Hefty.<eos> But, Smurfette, the Forbidden Forest?
So, we're coming with you.<eos> I can't ask you to do that.<eos> - You didn't ask.<eos> - We volunteered.<eos> - Thanks, guys.
- You didn't ask.<eos> - We volunteered.<eos> - Thanks, guys.<eos> - First things first.<eos> Bug technology.

I'm not that kind of Smurf.<eos> Watch out for the steep embankment.<eos> Clumsy, you okay?<eos> I'm seeing stars.<eos> Good work, Clumsy.
I mean, seems like an easy choice, but I'm just not sure.<eos> Yea, okay, let's go with "dragonfly." Hopefully more "fly" than "dragon."<eos> Nope!<eos> Less "fly!" Less "fly!"<eos> Guys!
What do you think I'm doing out here?<eos> You are never going to find that village, Gargamel.<eos> Smurfette, if it wasn't for you, I wouldn't even know about those other Smurfs.<eos> - Get 'em, boys.<eos> - Smurfintine formation!

This isn't good.<eos> - Clumsy, give 'em back their egg!<eos> - Okay.<eos> Oh, come on!<eos> - Clumsy!
Can it, fuzzball.<eos> They're dead.<eos> Dead, I say!<eos> Hello?<eos> Smurfette?
They're dead.<eos> Dead, I say!<eos> Hello?<eos> Smurfette?<eos> Echo!
Dead, I say!<eos> Hello?<eos> Smurfette?<eos> Echo!<eos> Darkness.
I have enough trouble in the daylight.<eos> Hold on, everyone.<eos> We need to find a way out of here.<eos> That is good thinking, "Brainy."<eos> - Guys?
Hold on, everyone.<eos> We need to find a way out of here.<eos> That is good thinking, "Brainy."<eos> - Guys?<eos> - Darkness!
Why?<eos> I'm really freaking out, you guys!<eos> Stop, everyone.<eos> Okay, go into your backpacks, get out your emergency tunnel survival kit, find the small glass vial marked "light," and shake it really hard.<eos> Clumsy?
Okay, I guess.<eos> Just hang tight, Clumsy.<eos> I'm not sure how long this will take or how long we'll be down here, so, everybody, whatever you do, don't eat all your rations.<eos> I just ate all my rations!<eos> - Clumsy!
- We gotta do something.<eos> I'm with her.<eos> Time for some action.<eos> We're doing this all wrong.<eos> Smurfette!
Smurfette!<eos> I'm close, Clumsy.<eos> Almost there.<eos> That's just the echo playing tricks on us.<eos> - Anybody?
That's just the echo playing tricks on us.<eos> - Anybody?<eos> - I'm here.<eos> I'm here right around this corner.<eos> Hey, everybody?
My light is going out.<eos> That is it!<eos> I'm punching us out of here.<eos> It's collapsing.<eos> Hefty!
- No!<eos> - Oh, yeah!<eos> - Don't!<eos> Too late!<eos> Clumsy?
- Oh, yeah!<eos> - Don't!<eos> Too late!<eos> Clumsy?<eos> - Hey, Smurfette.
- Don't!<eos> Too late!<eos> Clumsy?<eos> - Hey, Smurfette.<eos> - Clumsy!
Hang on.<eos> I'm coming, Clumsy bro.<eos> I got you, little buddy.<eos> Yeah!<eos> Stampede!
I got you, little buddy.<eos> Yeah!<eos> Stampede!<eos> I think my rations are coming up.<eos> What?
I think my rations are coming up.<eos> What?<eos> What's so funny?<eos> Now, that's what I call "talking out of your butt."<eos> Oh, boys.
Would anyone be interested in knowing that we're in sight of three tall trees?<eos> - All right.<eos> - Yeah, we are.<eos> And Bucky is gonna get us there extra fast.<eos> - Bucky?
And Bucky is gonna get us there extra fast.<eos> - Bucky?<eos> - Seems like a Bucky to me.<eos> Hit it, Bucky!<eos> Smurfette?
Smurfette, I know lately you may not realize, and I may not say it enough, but you are...<eos> You shine.<eos> So, anyway, we're smurfy?<eos> I think you and the boys have been grounded long enough.<eos> Smurfette?
Smurfette?<eos> Okay.<eos> I'm opening the door.<eos> And I'm walking in to talk more.<eos> You there?
Okay.<eos> I'm opening the door.<eos> And I'm walking in to talk more.<eos> You there?<eos> Smurfette.
I'm opening the door.<eos> And I'm walking in to talk more.<eos> You there?<eos> Smurfette.<eos> Hefty!
And I'm walking in to talk more.<eos> You there?<eos> Smurfette.<eos> Hefty!<eos> Brainy!
You there?<eos> Smurfette.<eos> Hefty!<eos> Brainy!<eos> Clumsy!
I'll start us a fire.<eos> Fetch me some firewood, would you, Hefty?<eos> A "please" would be nice.<eos> Yes, it would, but I haven't earned my manners badge, so get me some firewood.<eos> Clumsy?
I like orange.<eos> What if they all wear glasses?<eos> Or have big, bushy mustaches.<eos> What if they have scaly skin and sharp teeth?<eos> And giant claws.

What if they have scaly skin and sharp teeth?<eos> And giant claws.<eos> And big, beady eyes.<eos> What if they have hands?<eos> Good one, bro.
I'm meant to save those Smurfs.<eos> And we're gonna help you.<eos> We're Team Smurf, and we're in this together.<eos> And by "together," I mean me and you.<eos> And those guys.
We're Team Smurf, and we're in this together.<eos> And by "together," I mean me and you.<eos> And those guys.<eos> But mostly me and you.<eos> Okay, everyone.
But mostly me and you.<eos> Okay, everyone.<eos> Smurfy selfie time.<eos> - Say, "Blue cheese."<eos> - Blue cheese!
Fear not, my intrepid Team Smurf.<eos> I didn't earn this raft-building merit badge for nothing.<eos> - Nailed it.<eos> - Impressive, Brainy.<eos> Here.
- And heave...<eos> - Wait.<eos> The currents can be unpredictable.<eos> We must be alert and vigilant.<eos> Vigilance?
- Wait.<eos> The currents can be unpredictable.<eos> We must be alert and vigilant.<eos> Vigilance?<eos> Good call.
Pay attention to the...<eos> Rate of speed of the...<eos> Okay, and we are off.<eos> Heave-ho!<eos> - Bye, Bucky.
Heave-ho!<eos> - Bye, Bucky.<eos> - Thanks for your help.<eos> - Don't worry, we'll be fine.<eos> - Bye, little Bucky bro.
Look.<eos> If we follow this river, we'll be right on course.<eos> Right on course.<eos> To the end of our rainbow.<eos> Smurfs?
Smurfs?<eos> I thought I left you for dead.<eos> Hang on, Smurf Crew.<eos> Gun it!<eos> What the...
What the...<eos> No.<eos> Stop ruining things.<eos> Ruining things is my thing.<eos> What?
Is this a trick?<eos> Pull it now!<eos> Oh, no.<eos> What's this?<eos> Azrael!
I don't know about this.<eos> You won't regret it.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Such a kind Smurf.
Thanks for asking, but...<eos> I'm still evil, so...<eos> Enjoy drowning.<eos> Hope you're better swimmers than you are judges of wizards' character.<eos> Brainy.

My pack!<eos> My manual! No!<eos> No, no, no!<eos> No, no, no!<eos> My Scout manual!
No, no, no!<eos> No, no, no!<eos> My Scout manual!<eos> This is all your fault!<eos> - What?
This is all your fault!<eos> - What?<eos> - Brainy, cut it out.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Correction.
Stop it!<eos> Take cover!<eos> Who are you?<eos> What do you want?<eos> Her.
Who are you?<eos> What do you want?<eos> Her.<eos> - Move.<eos> - Smurfette!
- Smurfette!<eos> - What should we do with her?<eos> - Look at that hair.<eos> - Where's she from?<eos> - And that dress.
This is the Smurf I was telling you about.<eos> The one from the wall?<eos> She's real?<eos> I'm Smurflily.<eos> Hi.
I'm Smurfblossom.<eos> Nice to meet you.<eos> We don't have a Smurfette.<eos> But we do have Smurfpetal, Smurfclover,<eos> Smurfmeadow, Smurfdaisy, Smurfholly, Smurfhazel...
Nice to meet you.<eos> We don't have a Smurfette.<eos> But we do have Smurfpetal, Smurfclover,<eos> Smurfmeadow, Smurfdaisy, Smurfholly, Smurfhazel...<eos> Hey.
I do.<eos> I can show you.<eos> Actually, Smurfstorm can show you.<eos> She's the best at that kind of thing.<eos> Right, Stormy?
Have you ever seen a rainbow?<eos> What about a double rainbow?<eos> What about an upside down rainbow?<eos> So, is your favorite song...<eos> Hey, hey, hey Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
- Right.<eos> Filter, filter.<eos> - What's your deal anyway?<eos> Well, we came to warn you about Gargamel.<eos> - Garga?
Filter, filter.<eos> - What's your deal anyway?<eos> Well, we came to warn you about Gargamel.<eos> - Garga?<eos> - Garga?
Come on, Smurfette.<eos> I'm gonna show you my room.<eos> You can tell me all about Gargasmell.<eos> But first, do you want to hear my favorite song again?<eos> Hey, hey, hey Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
No, no, no.<eos> They're Smurfs, just like us.<eos> Except, well, they're boy Smurfs.<eos> "Boy." That's a funny word.<eos> Boy.
They're Smurfs, just like us.<eos> Except, well, they're boy Smurfs.<eos> "Boy." That's a funny word.<eos> Boy.<eos> Boy. Boy.
Except, well, they're boy Smurfs.<eos> "Boy." That's a funny word.<eos> Boy.<eos> Boy. Boy.<eos> Boy.
Are there more like you?<eos> They are at times very intimidating.<eos> - Are you gonna stay here?<eos> - And they smell nice.<eos> - Hello, boy.
- Hello, boy.<eos> - More on that later.<eos> - I want one!<eos> - Boundaries!<eos> Okay, that...
That's enough of that!<eos> They're my friends.<eos> That's Hefty, Brainy and Clumsy.<eos> - Hey, there!<eos> - Hooptie, Berney, Klutzy.
You won't find any boys here.<eos> I am Smurfwillow, leader of the Smurfs.<eos> This is called an introduction.<eos> So, now, you go.<eos> - I...
I promise we're only here to help.<eos> We came to warn you about the evil wizard, Gargamel.<eos> He has a map with a landmark leading him to three tall trees.<eos> - Show 'em, Brainy.<eos> - Snappy.
No way.<eos> Look at that one.<eos> He can't be normal.<eos> I think we'll be just fine here.<eos> Spitfire!
You can point him out.<eos> Hey.<eos> There's no way he's getting on a...<eos> I feel the need to remind you, my name is Clumsy.<eos> Clumsy!
Flap, Monty.<eos> Flap vigorously.<eos> Use your mighty condor wings to carry your master to safety.<eos> Sweet mercy, they're bottom feeders!<eos> Devil fish!
Use your mighty condor wings to carry your master to safety.<eos> Sweet mercy, they're bottom feeders!<eos> Devil fish!<eos> Where is my lost Smurf village?<eos> What?
Sweet mercy, they're bottom feeders!<eos> Devil fish!<eos> Where is my lost Smurf village?<eos> What?<eos> Smurfs!
He's coming back.<eos> - What do I...<eos> - Hurry!<eos> What do I do now?<eos> Good move!
What do I do now?<eos> Good move!<eos> - Now, do it again!<eos> - Okay.<eos> Thanks.
Wait a minute.<eos> I don't recognize that other Smurf.<eos> They found my lost Smurf village.<eos> Hey, I've got an idea.<eos> Spitfire, spit fire!
Hey, I've got an idea.<eos> Spitfire, spit fire!<eos> I like the way you think.<eos> I guess I'm pretty good with dragonflies after all.<eos> Monty!
I like the way you think.<eos> I guess I'm pretty good with dragonflies after all.<eos> Monty!<eos> What have they done to you, my glorious bird of prey?<eos> Smurfs!
I guess I'm pretty good with dragonflies after all.<eos> Monty!<eos> What have they done to you, my glorious bird of prey?<eos> Smurfs!<eos> Shiatsu or Swedish?
Probably Swedish.<eos> So, about all that stuff I said back at the beach...<eos> I guess I kind of overreacted.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Me, too.
So, about all that stuff I said back at the beach...<eos> I guess I kind of overreacted.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Me, too.<eos> So, we good?
Yeah.<eos> Me, too.<eos> So, we good?<eos> - Yeah, we're good.<eos> - Hey, guys.
It's like she's one of us now.<eos> She should stay with us forever.<eos> One, she always looks great.<eos> And two, this is getting a little out of hand, don't you think?<eos> Sorry.
Hey, Smurfette, we did what we came here to do.<eos> These Smurfs know about Gargamel.<eos> So, come on, let's start thinking about heading home.<eos> Home?<eos> But I...
So, come on, let's start thinking about heading home.<eos> Home?<eos> But I...<eos> It's time to go.<eos> Smurfette?
I told you...<eos> Put a cork in it, Smurfette.<eos> The way I see it, you and your little boyfriends led him straight to us.<eos> But, of course, that was your plan all along, wasn't it?<eos> Smurfstorm, easy.
Smurfstorm, easy.<eos> Little Miss Yellow Hair isn't even a real Smurf.<eos> She was created by Gargamel.<eos> The Clumsy blob told me so himself.<eos> What?
Hold.<eos> Hold.<eos> Now!<eos> Surrender, wizard.<eos> What?
Hold.<eos> Now!<eos> Surrender, wizard.<eos> What?<eos> Wizard?
- Is he wearing a disguise?<eos> - Look at his face.<eos> This is impossible.<eos> He doesn't seem so tough.<eos> Yeah, Gargamel!
This is impossible.<eos> He doesn't seem so tough.<eos> Yeah, Gargamel!<eos> That's what you get when you attack Smurfy Grove.<eos> - Gargamel?
- Gargamel?<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> - No, no, no, wait.<eos> This is a mistake.<eos> - What?
What are you talking about?<eos> - No, no, no, wait.<eos> This is a mistake.<eos> - What?<eos> - Smurfette?
This is a mistake.<eos> - What?<eos> - Smurfette?<eos> That's Papa.<eos> - Papa?
- What?<eos> - Smurfette?<eos> That's Papa.<eos> - Papa?<eos> - Papa?
That's Papa.<eos> - Papa?<eos> - Papa?<eos> There's another funny word.<eos> Papa.
- Papa?<eos> - Papa?<eos> There's another funny word.<eos> Papa.<eos> Papa.
- Papa?<eos> There's another funny word.<eos> Papa.<eos> Papa.<eos> Papa!
Papa!<eos> Smurfblossom, no.<eos> Breathe deep and step away from the Papa-thing.<eos> Everyone, meet Papa Smurf.<eos> Hey.
Smurfblossom, no.<eos> Breathe deep and step away from the Papa-thing.<eos> Everyone, meet Papa Smurf.<eos> Hey.<eos> - Hey.
Breathe deep and step away from the Papa-thing.<eos> Everyone, meet Papa Smurf.<eos> Hey.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - Hi.
- Hi.<eos> I'm Smurfjade.<eos> Where are the boys?<eos> - 'Sup, Papa?<eos> - Hello there.
I wasn't born yesterday, you know.<eos> Yeah, that's clear.<eos> Look, you four are coming home with me.<eos> Not so fast, Papa-thing.<eos> "Papa-thing"?
Impressive.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You're quite welcome.<eos> Okay, not really sure what's happening here, but what about Gargamel?<eos> What?
You're quite welcome.<eos> Okay, not really sure what's happening here, but what about Gargamel?<eos> What?<eos> What is all this talk about Garga...<eos> Gargamel!
Freeze ball! Freeze ball!<eos> Look out!<eos> Well, I assume they'll still work if I don't shout "freeze ball," but we'll never know.<eos> - Freeze ball!<eos> - Smurfette!
Look out!<eos> Well, I assume they'll still work if I don't shout "freeze ball," but we'll never know.<eos> - Freeze ball!<eos> - Smurfette!<eos> - Hefty.
Monty, bag o' Smurfs.<eos> It's time for you to run.<eos> - No!<eos> - Three more for pickup.<eos> Smurfette.
It's time for you to run.<eos> - No!<eos> - Three more for pickup.<eos> Smurfette.<eos> My little creation.
Freeze ball!<eos> Yes, these freeze balls only work on real Smurfs.<eos> And you are nothing more than a lump of clay.<eos> Thank you for everything.<eos> Smurfette?
How could you do this to us?<eos> Because it was her purpose.<eos> Smurfy Thing Finder for four small Smurfs.<eos> I'm sorry, you guys.<eos> No, Snappy.
- Pick up something heavy.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> And use it to kill the bird!<eos> - Yeah!<eos> What?
- Yeah! Wait.<eos> You want us to kill the bird?<eos> Fine.<eos> We'll just knock him unconscious.<eos> - Genius!
Look at that.<eos> Everything is in sync.<eos> Yes, yes.<eos> Good.<eos> Sweet mercy!
Yes, yes.<eos> Good.<eos> Sweet mercy!<eos> It's another jailbreak!<eos> - No, Gargamel. No.
It's working, it's working, it's working<eos> I can feel it.<eos> I can feel the power.<eos> Check out my wizard mane.<eos> Really, man?
Check out my wizard mane.<eos> Really, man?<eos> When I'm through with these Smurfs, I'll have all the power I've ever dreamed of!<eos> Almost all the power.<eos> Smurfette.
Really, man?<eos> When I'm through with these Smurfs, I'll have all the power I've ever dreamed of!<eos> Almost all the power.<eos> Smurfette.<eos> Smurfette, what a lovely surprise.
I'm so tired of being good.<eos> Use your power to transform me back to my evil self.<eos> Your loyalty has returned to you.<eos> So, do we have a deal?<eos> Smurfette, no!
Use your power to transform me back to my evil self.<eos> Your loyalty has returned to you.<eos> So, do we have a deal?<eos> Smurfette, no!<eos> Quiet, you vile blue rats.
Let's do it.<eos> One evil Smurfette coming right up!<eos> Wait.<eos> Of course!<eos> What?
Go, Smurfette!<eos> Azrael, help!<eos> More power!<eos> What are we going to do?<eos> Bingo.
We Smurfboard.<eos> Team Smurf!<eos> Payback time.<eos> No!<eos> Smurfintine!
Team Smurf!<eos> Payback time.<eos> No!<eos> Smurfintine!<eos> Smurfintine!
She did it!<eos> She did it!<eos> Where's Smurfette?<eos> Hey.<eos> Smurfette?
Where is it?<eos> What page?<eos> Must be here.<eos> "Alchemy, vanishing, lead into gold." No, that's not it.<eos> - Papa.
What page?<eos> Must be here.<eos> "Alchemy, vanishing, lead into gold." No, that's not it.<eos> - Papa.<eos> - Which spell?
Must be here.<eos> "Alchemy, vanishing, lead into gold." No, that's not it.<eos> - Papa.<eos> - Which spell?<eos> Which spell?
"Alchemy, vanishing, lead into gold." No, that's not it.<eos> - Papa.<eos> - Which spell?<eos> Which spell?<eos> Papa.
It's Smurfette.<eos> She's a lump of clay.<eos> No, Clumsy, it's me.<eos> I'm right here.<eos> Smurfette?
- Quiet, Clumsy.<eos> - Let him be, Brainy.<eos> We all grieve in our own way.<eos> - She's here!<eos> - Poor little bro.
- She's here!<eos> - Poor little bro.<eos> I know how he feels.<eos> Yeah!<eos> Smurfette!
- Poor little bro.<eos> I know how he feels.<eos> Yeah!<eos> Smurfette!<eos> Hefty, not you, too.
She's many things.<eos> She doesn't know it yet, but she's my new best friend.<eos> Smurfette is a bunny wrangler.<eos> She's tough.<eos> Not as tough as me, but tough enough.
Smurfette can be anything she wants to be.<eos> - What's going on in there?<eos> - Goodbye!<eos> Say, "Blue cheese!"<eos> Blue cheese!
I demand an apology.<eos> You were going to learn this one way or another, but I am not your real father.<eos> But that doesn't matter now.<eos> What matters is destroying the Smurfs.<eos> Any thoughts?
I can't think with this music.<eos> Can someone please shut off the music?<eos> And what's with all these words scrolling in front of me?<eos> Did the Smurfs do this so that I would be distracted and not be able to destroy them as easily?<eos> "Matte painters"?
That's terrible.<eos> Some idiot just hit me.<eos> Do you realize how much this is going to cost?<eos> Not in money, which I have plenty of, but in...<eos> What the...
The same pattern is repeating around the world, so there could be an overriding factor.<eos> Perhaps a paranormal element.<eos> Are you talking about magic?<eos> We've come up against magic before, Batman.<eos> - Xerxes, Trigon, Felix Faust.
I recommend spending more time on the streets instead of flying over them.<eos> He's even friendlier than they say.<eos> Bollocks!<eos> In what bloody plane of existence does four of a kind lose?<eos> Too, too bad, Constantine.
Looks like you can't call my bet, Constantine.<eos> By my rules, you lose.<eos> - I raise. - With what?<eos> - Your ratty soul ain't worth two bits.<eos> - Not two bits.
Well, what do you say, boys?<eos> I like the action.<eos> I call.<eos> Really?<eos> A chipped Dreamstone?
Broken knick-knacks for the House of Mystery and its contents?<eos> Are you mad?<eos> I've got a working soul catcher.<eos> That's Ogid's Eye Spiker?<eos> And the Garazi.
So even if that very magical Dreamstone doesn't work, it's still a big-ass ruby.<eos> I'd be a poor sport indeed if I didn't accept your fair wager.<eos> Hell. Now, that's a losing hand for the ages.<eos> Now, read them and...<eos> - What?
Oi, I'm gonna roast your nuts and feed them to you, Constantine.<eos> Gone, gone, the form of man.<eos> Arise the demon, Etrigan!<eos> Once more with words of metered rhyme comes Etrigan the Slayer just in time.<eos> Easy now, brother.
It's not an address. The House of Mystery tends to move around.<eos> I didn't put the symbols in there for the GPS to find it.<eos> I wanted the House to come to us.<eos> She can't hold it. Do something.<eos> There.
How do you cope with it?<eos> I have a butler.<eos> That was enlightening.<eos> Well, I guess we should have that chinwag about now.<eos> - Demons!
Okay, if we do it as a group.<eos> This is the monkey cage in Sumatra all over again.<eos> "We need to save the monkeys," she said.<eos> - You're such an ass.<eos> - Not the monkeys.
- You're such an ass.<eos> - Not the monkeys.<eos> Says the man who has Newcastle and 100 other screw-ups on his resume,<eos> - costing lives and souls.<eos> - But not monkeys.
When the time comes, I'll be the one to collect your soul, Constantine.<eos> Yeah, yeah.<eos> I thought I felt a disturbance in the force.<eos> How you doing, Johnny boy?<eos> Zatanna and Batman?
Yeah, yeah.<eos> I thought I felt a disturbance in the force.<eos> How you doing, Johnny boy?<eos> Zatanna and Batman?<eos> What the hell?
How you doing, Johnny boy?<eos> Zatanna and Batman?<eos> What the hell?<eos> Tell you everything inside, mate.<eos> You poor thing.
And, hey, you don't have to say it.<eos> You're forgiven.<eos> Still wondering what Batman's doing in my living room.<eos> And when is he gonna shut up, right?<eos> What?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, side by side.<eos> But I got the weird magical cancer while you, you added to your rep.<eos> Isn't that right?<eos> Look, me not making proper amends isn't related to the Key, which, truth be told, you're not gonna need, mate.<eos> John!
I am not giving you crap.<eos> Your anger is understandable, but you need to reconsider.<eos> Innocent lives are at stake.<eos> Well, doctors say an upbeat attitude can help, so what I'll focus on today is that I met Batman.<eos> Force of good.
Force of good.<eos> It was also nice seeing you, Zatanna.<eos> Now, if you'll excuse me...<eos> You can show yourselves out.<eos> This him?
I expect the worst, so I prepare for the worst, and when the worst happens, I'm ready.<eos> But my outlook doesn't alter the reality of the world.<eos> - Steven, stop!<eos> - Leave me alone!<eos> Another precious moment.
This was the morning of his madness.<eos> - What do you think will set him off?<eos> - My guess is the Sudoku.<eos> He's got two 9s in the same row.<eos> John.
- Shit's really hit the fan.<eos> - You had to go there, Boston.<eos> Let's get the hell out of here.<eos> - I don't recognize it.<eos> - Me, neither.
- Me, neither.<eos> But if there's a person alive who can, it's Ritchie.<eos> Are you forgetting when you made your friend despise you?<eos> This is too bloody important for hurt feelings.<eos> - Constantine.
But if there's a person alive who can, it's Ritchie.<eos> Are you forgetting when you made your friend despise you?<eos> This is too bloody important for hurt feelings.<eos> - Constantine.<eos> - Bollocks.
This is too bloody important for hurt feelings.<eos> - Constantine.<eos> - Bollocks.<eos> You've arrived in time to witness my...<eos> Ritchie!
Ritchie!<eos> Get back, you bastards!<eos> John, help Ritchie.<eos> Take that!<eos> Boom!
I think me, them, and everyone else who knows you might want it to be somewhere else.<eos> Your friend is awake.<eos> Ritchie, who was it?<eos> Who did this to you?<eos> Faust.
Your friend is awake.<eos> Ritchie, who was it?<eos> Who did this to you?<eos> Faust.<eos> Felix Faust.
Ritchie, who was it?<eos> Who did this to you?<eos> Faust.<eos> Felix Faust.<eos> You sure?
Hell, I should have put it together. Conjuring a whirlwind is just his style.<eos> The League had a run-in with Faust, but his location isn't in our database.<eos> Yeah, wizards don't make a habit of signing up for credit cards or social media.<eos> His grandly named Observatory of the Cosmos is hidden from the likes of you and Superman, but not from me.<eos> Felix Faust.
His grandly named Observatory of the Cosmos is hidden from the likes of you and Superman, but not from me.<eos> Felix Faust.<eos> - What's happening?<eos> - If this were a computer, I'd say it's frozen.<eos> Cheers.
There's another way, but it involves asking a favor of someone that I don't have the best relationship with.<eos> Someone else dislikes you?<eos> Shocking.<eos> Your friend slips from the mortal plane.<eos> - John...
Alec Holland was murdered by terrorists.<eos> His body was never recovered.<eos> End of story. Not quite.<eos> Go away!<eos> Swamp Thing!
Go away!<eos> Swamp Thing!<eos> I know you're seeing this.<eos> Get out here, or the posies get it!<eos> John Constantine.
The place you seek is there.<eos> That place is heavily warded.<eos> I know we've had our differences, but we could really use your help.<eos> If we don't get a handle on this rotter, he'll threaten all of humanity.<eos> What of it?
- Guess we do it the hard way.<eos> - Or not.<eos> Gone, gone, the form of man.<eos> Arise the demon Etrigan!<eos> What...
You've seen me in action, right?<eos> Yeah, once or twice.<eos> Why are you here?<eos> I haven't done anything to warrant this kind of response.<eos> This yours?
We were sent here by your friend, remember?<eos> - But Ritchie's dying.<eos> - Is he?<eos> Boy, boy. I think I got closer to death than I planned.<eos> Bad girl.
Ritchie, you're gonna listen to me whether you like it or not.<eos> Open the door.<eos> Do you hear?<eos> Open it!<eos> Too late, Johnny Boy.
Open the door.<eos> Do you hear?<eos> Open it!<eos> Too late, Johnny Boy.<eos> Ritchie, please!
Everywhere!<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes.<eos> My will be done.<eos> Fool!
Not only can I sense you, you cannot defeat my shield.<eos> Since when does God need a force shield?<eos> The Justice League are on their way.<eos> Suppose that couldn't be helped, but make sure they stay well away from Destiny, to not be struck mad, unless you want a bunch of crazed super blokes ripping apart the city.<eos> A little late for that, my friend.
Sorry to have to ask this, Jason.<eos> At least you're asking.<eos> Gone, gone, the form of man. Rise the demon Etrigan!<eos> So Constantine calls once more.<eos> Just like a greedy, wanton...
Save the bloody rhymes, and top that git!<eos> Killjoy.<eos> I've had many years to think about you, Etrigan.<eos> Call this poetic justice.<eos> Holy crap.
- Calling for help.<eos> I just hope he doesn't realize it's me doing the calling.<eos> Who dares strike at me?<eos> The Defender of the Green...<eos> Swamp Thing.
What the hell are we gonna do?<eos> I say we go and talk to a man about a horse.<eos> Did you hit your head or something?<eos> You're babbling.<eos> A Trojan horse, Boston.
Did you hit your head or something?<eos> You're babbling.<eos> A Trojan horse, Boston.<eos> Come on!<eos> Over here, you wanker!
I don't think so.<eos> Johnny, I was... I was under a compulsion.<eos> You've got to save me.<eos> You owe me. You owe me!<eos> Sorry, mate.
The red lights will turn in a circle.<eos> You can not miss it.<eos> Where do I wait?<eos> In the guest lounge.<eos> Williamsburg Savings Bank.
Williamsburg Savings Bank.<eos> We are ready to meet you now.<eos> I see overdrafts On your current account.<eos> It seems that no deposits have been made. A few months ago.<eos> "Waxler" for mining.

We must clarify the possibility of this happening When refinancing.<eos> - You did it.<eos> - I did what?<eos> You sold me this nonsense.<eos> "Joe Harding".

Bank robbery in Brooklyn - Client "Heimer", FBI.<eos> It's really simple.<eos> - Hey, that's what we said.<eos> - Are there other questions?<eos> What a creep.
I hit it!<eos> "The three men left With about $ 1.6 million."<eos> Three hooded robbers steal 1.6 million.<eos> "FBI and police 'New York'." "They say they have no evidence right now."<eos> and what?
Like a dance.<eos> Yes, the "Kunga" dance is immediately immersed in them In prison.<eos> Will we play or what?<eos> Ask the responsible man.<eos> Milton?

Kaitlin, this is the last rose of the night.<eos> You count your genius!<eos> My heart is beating hard in my chest now.<eos> This week was... amazing.<eos> "Sean" boring, and "Nick" punk man Multi-Sexual Relationships.
I accepted them all, and used her tongue.<eos> I did it with all the crew, It's a mobile sex infection!<eos> This week and the events that have passed. Makes my decision seem impossible.<eos> "Kaitlin," I shut your mouth.<eos> "Nick".

It was a fantastic meal tonight.<eos> It is impressive What you can do with frozen fish.<eos> The best garlic bread I've ever eaten.<eos> And the mix of red pepper and garlic!<eos> - Awesome!
- Awesome!<eos> - Awesome!<eos> In fact, I suspect the reason was mold.<eos> Well, your night is wet.<eos> "Joe".
- Awesome!<eos> In fact, I suspect the reason was mold.<eos> Well, your night is wet.<eos> "Joe".<eos> What?
