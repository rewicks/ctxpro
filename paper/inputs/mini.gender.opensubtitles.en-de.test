I knew you would do it, Xander.<eos> You brought the world to us.<eos> The world is big,<eos> The world is big, but always fits in your heart.<eos> Take it with you always.
It's in a safe place.<eos> That wasn't a part of the plan.<eos> After all these years, you're still shocked when I improvise?<eos> No.<eos> But the mission was to destroy it.
Move! Move!<eos> Shit's about to go down.<eos> You ready to have some fun?<eos> Turn the music off!<eos> Stop it!
Phoenix out of the ashes.<eos> Eighteen hours in a chair in Mexico.<eos> I drank my bodyweight in tequila to get through it.<eos> It's the most important one, actually.<eos> It's when I decided to change the world instead of rage against it.
No.<eos> I look all right.<eos> Wait. Why didn't your dad stop you?<eos> Well, this is my dad's, actually.<eos> He's dead now, which is why I get to wear it. So...
Uther, I don't think we can win this fight.<eos> I know Mordred.<eos> He would accept surrender.<eos> Hold the crown.<eos> And hold it steady.
The sword can only be drawn by Uther Pendragon or his direct heir.<eos> You felt it, didn't you?<eos> The power.<eos> That's what put you out.<eos> You just don't know how to control it.
Ryll, this is accomplishing nothing.<eos> He's a mercenary.<eos> Unworthy.<eos> I don't need you to tell me about my past.<eos> I lived it.
If that vegetable hat can tell us that Hefty is strong, maybe it can tell me what an Ette is.<eos> Power it up, Brainy.<eos> Fascinating.<eos> What happened?<eos> Somehow, instead of sending energy out, you absorbed it.
What are you...<eos> Why?<eos> I'm really freaking out, you guys!<eos> Stop, everyone.<eos> Okay, go into your backpacks, get out your emergency tunnel survival kit, find the small glass vial marked "light," and shake it really hard.
Simon says it sometimes.<eos> He says, "Choose life, Veronika."<eos> "Choose life."<eos> "Choose life" was a well-meaning slogan from a 1980s antidrug campaign.<eos> And we used to add things to it.
So... what can I bring you from the market?<eos> A rose.<eos> Like the one in the painting.<eos> You ask for that every year!<eos> And every year you bring it.
Hi guys.<eos> Hi.<eos> Mack, did you see the game yesterday?<eos> Since when do I get the control?<eos> I heard that one day they give it back.
Okay, Ray, I'm sorry.<eos> I'm gonna have to take your guild card.<eos> Come on.<eos> Ray, why don't you, um, get your stuff some other time, okay?<eos> We'll keep it safe for you.
- The card.<eos> Go ahead.<eos> Take a look.<eos> And guess what...<eos> I'm not giving it to anyone.
Take a look.<eos> And guess what...<eos> I'm not giving it to anyone.<eos> Just you.<eos> Because I wrote it for you.
Did you write this one?<eos> Let's see that.<eos> Aah! Damn thing cut me!<eos> Now... where's your card?<eos> I don't have it.
Let's see that.<eos> Aah! Damn thing cut me!<eos> Now... where's your card?<eos> I don't have it.<eos> Styvesan told the boss that you did have it.
Styvesan told the boss that you did have it.<eos> He said that you said that it was your best card ever.<eos> So, tell it!<eos> Ask the woman.<eos> She saw it.
After all, she's my legacy.<eos> I intend for her to have the best and be the best, and she will never hear a whisper of her no-account, drug addict birth father or her whore of a mother.<eos> Nobody better'n nobody.<eos> After all that, I gave them the damn card.<eos> They found a nice, cheery front to sell it, and that did the trick.
I'm trying.<eos> A bit of performance anxiety?<eos> Tom?<eos> Come on!<eos> If I gave you the option to walk away, would you take it?
It's Tolstoy.<eos> "The higher a man stands on a social ladder the greater the number of people he's connected with."<eos> "War and Peace". Volume 2, Book 9.<eos> My mother is from the east Ukraine so I grew up learning Russian.<eos> To show off my learning abilities, she had me memorize classic literature. In Russian and recite it to people.
This is the panel to the main water filtration system.<eos> Whatever the compound is, it reacts badly with water.<eos> And the cargo bay door opening?<eos> It was where the cargo was jettisoned from.<eos> - None of this helps us find it.
See?<eos> We're expendable.<eos> They fired Irv.<eos> This school's gonna fuck me?<eos> I'm gonna fuck it!
Here now, there now!<eos> Life is a journey.<eos> The city of my dreams traverses, bundled in a bottle lf you have the wisdom, patience to boot, and a lot of guts, you have nothing to worry.<eos> This world is fake.<eos> You have to turn crooked to fix it.
When you smile, it strikes me dumb!<eos> And I just feel like watching you!<eos> Then take me to Our World.<eos> God willing!<eos> When I make Our World, you will be the first one to see it.
She said relax.<eos> Did you have a nice time in London?<eos> It was OK, I guess.<eos> But did somebody hide the sun?<eos> Did you lose it in the war?
I'm Landsat Field Supervisor, Victor Nieves.<eos> This is my colleague Steve Woodward, our data wrangler.<eos> (ALL CHUCKLING)<eos> Our expedition takes us to a place every nautical trade route known to man has avoided for centuries.<eos> As our satellites show, the island is surrounded by a perpetual storm system, allowing it to remain hidden from the outside world.
There's more out there.<eos> What do you mean, "more"?<eos> This world never belonged to us.<eos> It belonged to them.<eos> The question is how long before they take it back.
No, let's go in here.<eos> So have you had another one of your little meetings?<eos> It's just a monthly top-up.<eos> Confession is good for the soul.<eos> - Provided you can delete it.
I don't know, something.<eos> Mary left a message.<eos> What message?<eos> John Watson, never accepts help, not from anyone.<eos> Not ever, but here's the thing he never refuses it.
I'm sorry, sir, what?<eos> What do you mean?<eos> I think the door is jammed.<eos> Has that door locked itself again?<eos> Yeah, it's always doing that.
- Why not? Given your immediate alternative.<eos> What about his brother?<eos> Mycroft? He's fine.<eos> So, you're off now, I won't see you for a week?<eos> Just spending it at home.
This is an experiment.<eos> There will be rigour.<eos> Sherlock, pick up the gun.<eos> It's your turn next.<eos> When I tell you to use it, and I will, remember what happened this time.
- For whom?<eos> - You. - How so?<eos> - If someone else had to die, would you really want to do it with your bare hands?<eos> Would waste valuable time.<eos> Probably just take it.
See!<eos> I was right.<eos> No.<eos> I've seen this before somewhere.<eos> We've gotta find something to replace it with.
Spit it out! Spit it out!<eos> Come on!<eos> Disgusting!<eos> The beast's hide is too thick to be pierced from the outside.<eos> I must cut through it from the inside.
Okay, Taserface.<eos> Hey, tell the other guys we said...<eos> "Hi," Taserface!<eos> What about this little plant?<eos> Can I smash it with a rock?
What about this little plant?<eos> Can I smash it with a rock?<eos> No, Gef.<eos> It's too adorable to kill.<eos> Take it to the tailor.
But what I did not tell you was how, when I finally did find it... it was all so... disappointing.<eos> And that is when I came... to a profound realization.<eos> My innate desire to seek out other life... was not so that I could walk among that life.<eos> Peter... I have found meaning.<eos> I see it.
Uh, we just left the keys in the ignition.<eos> Checking in.<eos> Thank you. You're welcome.<eos> Well, you wanted to see the world.<eos> Here you have it.
I needed to see for myself.<eos> And?<eos> It's not going to be a problem.<eos> We have an agreement.<eos> You must honor it to the letter or there will be consequences.
But it's here at last.<eos> I hear you crying at night in your room.<eos> Weeping over your parents and their loss.<eos> That grief is a weakness.<eos> Banish it.
I've been alive long enough to watch the world change in many ways.<eos> But this change now, it feels significant.<eos> The Devil of Hell's Kitchen.<eos> The man with unbreakable skin.<eos> And now, an immortal weapon has left K'un-Lun, not to fulfill his duty, but in dereliction of it.
I was not born a homeless beggar.<eos> Right.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Most people usually keep moving.<eos> I need information... about the factory, the guards, and the woman who runs it, Gao.
You said you had this under control.<eos> I thought I did.<eos> I just...<eos> - I lost. I...<eos> - Anger is a gift, Mr. Rand, if you know how to control it.
All the questionable shit we've done in the name of Rand...<eos> Hey, hey, hey. That's not true, Joy.<eos> This is all very touching, but time is up.<eos> This blade has cut down kings, emperors, lords and tyrants.<eos> If you would have told me I might use it on a businessman?
It's gave us so much.<eos> This is an opportunity to give something back.<eos> Besides, aren't you curious?<eos> So, three wishes are granted to whoever discovers the box.<eos> But we all found it. And touched it at the same time.
Good ol' Ozzie came through again.<eos> That wish box is mine!<eos> That wish box doesn't belong to anyone.<eos> No human should possess this kind of power.<eos> Which is exactly why I should have it.
- You punched first.<eos> Seriously?<eos> - How come he can't be hurt?<eos> - What's the deal with that fist?<eos> - I earned it.
- How come he can't be hurt?<eos> - What's the deal with that fist?<eos> - I earned it.<eos> - You what?<eos> He earned it.
Safer than we are.<eos> Small mistakes.<eos> Personal ties. These are what they'll use to end you.<eos> What happened to your hand?<eos> Ah, I cut it off to free myself.
Millennia.<eos> It doesn't matter.<eos> But a long time ago, the elders of K'un-Lun gathered to study how to harness their chi.<eos> The energy of life itself.<eos> They wanted to use it to heal.
- Don't worry.<eos> He didn't go as Matt.<eos> You gave him the suit?<eos> I wasn't trying to open the door for him.<eos> I was giving him a chance to close it. For good.
What's that sound?<eos> What's happening?<eos> Oh, shit.<eos> You waste your energy.<eos> Save it... for the larger battle to come.
How are you?<eos> You, uh...<eos> You still thinking about Matt Murdock?<eos> He loved this city.<eos> Sacrificed himself to protect it.
- Give or take.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Shit.<eos> - Yeah. Once there was a lockdown because Allan forgot his duffel bag at the rec center<eos> - and they thought it was a bomb.
- Oh...<eos> - Mmm, no, thank you.<eos> - That's all right. - Then take the flashlight.<eos> But if you do this, you got to do it right.<eos> - If you hold it from the front... - Uh-huh. it's not only a flashlight.
Order confirmed.<eos> What is this?<eos> He completed the task.<eos> The marker is over.<eos> Mark it.
He completed the task.<eos> The marker is over.<eos> Mark it.<eos> If Mr. Wick isn't dead already, he soon will be.<eos> Will you mark it, sir?
The next stop is Broad Street.<eos> This is Broad Street.<eos> This is the last stop on the southbound C train.<eos> The blade is in your aorta.<eos> You pull it out, you will bleed, and you will die.
It's not too late.<eos> I mean, you're beautiful.<eos> The ranch, it's been in my family for four generations.<eos> Stella, ranching is dirty business.<eos> If jt couldn't save it, how are you gonna do it all by yourself?
Did you hear about José's show?<eos> It was incredible.<eos> Really.<eos> He was amazing. He got rave reviews.<eos> I gotta check it out.
Well I'll start from the subway,<eos> What about the attack?<eos> You can use these special circumstances to relieve the fray,<eos> We found this during last fight,<eos> It will bring command of the guard on the other parameters,
It's just ice..<eos> That funny...<eos> Could've sworn there was a secret Russian naval base with the retrophilic cold war Submarines<eos> Well, technically, it's not Russian anymore<eos> Base was take by a terror grope of military separatists about a month ago. And the Russians haven't taken it back yet
You know her.<eos> Doesn't, ring a bell.<eos> - Okay, did Ginnie leave an address? - Yes.<eos> I think it's on the fridge.<eos> Gary, could you get it, please?
Are you a good actress?<eos> Your father thought so.<eos> And was that before or after he lost his mind?<eos> Well, love is a kind of madness, isn't it, Mr Thoyt?<eos> Or have you never experienced it?
No civilised woman would have intentions regarding him.<eos> And you would not need to be wary of me.<eos> We have the same father.<eos> You are in every way an unopened box.<eos> Just when I think it's empty, I hear a tiger roaring inside it.
Or it could burn.<eos> - Do you know what's inside it?<eos> - Aye.<eos> The truth.<eos> If it was up to me, I'd burn it.
- Do you know what's inside it?<eos> - Aye.<eos> The truth.<eos> If it was up to me, I'd burn it.<eos> Less chance the river might bring it back.
Then, Mr. Coop... he is a man that you will be able to do business with.<eos> You slept in a bird's nest.<eos> We need a carpenter.<eos> Yeah, the door gets stiff in winter.<eos> Shave it and it'll be loose in the summer.
We are not here to harass, to intimidate.<eos> We're not here to shoot first and ask questions later.<eos> We must not be driven by fear and suspicion.<eos> We are here above all else... to support the civilian population.<eos> And to that end, we must avoid killing it at all cost.
Well, you're always going on about what's wrong with people, but you don't do anything about it.<eos> You just complain.<eos> Close to 100 demonstrators stepped out to protest the whites-only policy of the White Tower restaurant in downtown Baltimore.<eos> The activists were met with some resistance from supporters of segregation.<eos> I think that, uh, as much as we regret it, integration is here, and I would like to be able to do as much as I can to prevent it coming.
My private blog.<eos> It's getting a lot of hits lately.<eos> You should check it out.<eos> I don't recognize your authority.<eos> I don't recognize it.

He could stop them.<eos> The Nazis lost the war.<eos> Why is he still obsessed?<eos> What does he want an army for?<eos> He doesn't want it for them.
His mom conjured him.<eos> To fill the void she felt after the Wild Hunt passed through Canaan.<eos> Mom...<eos> What if Sheriff Stilinski is filling a void?<eos> What if he's filling it with Claudia?
So, wait a sec.<eos> So, this woman "Lenore," she conjured up her dead son?<eos> She was the only one left.<eos> She had to fill a void.<eos> So she filled it with her son.
Fire.<eos> Cremation.<eos> Those are images that have never been on the tape before.<eos> You know, primitive cultures believed that the only way to free a soul is to burn the body.<eos> That is, if you can find it.
So, as much as you may not want to indulge yourself in looking at your most inner thoughts, they're there. Make no mistake. They are there.<eos> Do you believe in a soul?<eos> If not, close your eyes.<eos> Great.<eos> Let's just say a soul does exist. Where in the body do you think it'd be?
Uh, yeah, it took me a while to figure it out.<eos> At first I thought it was like the Norwegians, right?<eos> But then I noticed how he moves his cards when he's sorting.<eos> The first card he moves indicates the suit.<eos> If he moves it all the way to the left, it's spades.
You're not that innocent, Jensen.<eos> I don't give a shit what she says.<eos> Mr. Foley, let's go. Get to homeroom.<eos> You too, Mr. Jensen.<eos> So, there are a number of ways to get help if you need it, or if a friend does, okay?
What?<eos> I doubt it.<eos> People like you don't make selfless moves.<eos> Oh, my God, dude, this shit is crazy!<eos> "Today I am wearing lacy black underwear with the sole purpose of knowing that I am wearing it."
- What if I can't hum on key? - "What if I can't hum on key?<eos> What if my melodies are the ones nobody hears?"<eos> Is everyone reading that stupid magazine?<eos> I'm kind of addicted to it.<eos> -You never read it?
She was drunk at school today.<eos> - (OVEN DINGS) - She's fine.<eos> She's fucked up.<eos> And so are you.<eos> Jessica deserves the truth, and she's never gonna believe it unless it comes from you.
Hey, what the fuck happened to your face?<eos> I'll show you.<eos> This couldn't wait till after school?<eos> Copy this tape.<eos> I'll get it from you after homeroom.
Bend at your knees.<eos> You want to keep quiet.<eos> I heard you from a mile away.<eos> Okay.<eos> And when this happens, and when we allow freedom to ring... when we let it ring from every village and every hamlet, from every state and every city, we will be able to speed up that day
So do you, I guess.<eos> Tick-tock. Chop-chop.<eos> And, Rick... if Daryl does turn up here two days from now, two months from now... hell, two years from now, just know there's no statute of limitations on this.<eos> Keep that hatchet handy.<eos> You're gonna need it if he turns up with you people.
There's more at the library.<eos> A lot more.<eos> You, uh...<eos> You have a library?<eos> Your friend Daryl didn't get a chance to see it before he bounced.
In case you were wondering.<eos> I was out there all day and not a damn one.<eos> Not a real one.<eos> Thing is, I had a gun.<eos> I was gonna use it to kill Negan.
And what happens after that?<eos> After that, we keep going.<eos> Yeah, but...<eos> Negan ordered the world his way.<eos> It's up to us to reorder it once he's gone, right?
Stop! Morgan!<eos> He set it all up.<eos> He blocked the road yesterday, made us late.<eos> And we had your offering when we left -- had it all.<eos> He took one from the cargo, and he hid it -- when we stopped.
Yeah, he could.<eos> Pop, you remember how he'd stand when he'd read it?<eos> He'd come up to me and he goes...<eos> "'Cisco, buddy, that plant right there..." "Has gotten itself some root rot, boy-o."<eos> "You take that plant right there and you're best to move it..." "Two plots over, if you really care for that plant."
The risk I took on account of you.<eos> Your needs. - Emmit Stussy.<eos> Eden prairie, it's a short drive.<eos> - No you said...<eos> Look I did what you said. The address on the Eden valley, I looked it up.
Yeah.<eos> - I think we can. - Cut the cake now.<eos> - Because he might have to.<eos> - Get back on the phone. - But, like, you're.<eos> - Not allowed to because. Do you cut it like this?
Grudges...<eos> But I don't want that anymore.<eos> So...<eos> I'm giving you the stamp.<eos> Well, you're not giving it to me.
No.<eos> I am. You can't give me what was mine from the start.<eos> Okay.<eos> No, that's...<eos> Take it.
Okay.<eos> No, that's...<eos> Take it.<eos> It's yours.<eos> I don't want it.
He was hired by another fellow to rob somebody.<eos> His brother.<eos> Maurice's brother? No, the brother of the fella that hired Maurice, both named Stussy.<eos> - Like your stepdad.<eos> - Exactly. Probably gave Maurice an address for the brother, except he lost it.

This is what drives innovation.<eos> Of course, technology has other benefits as well.<eos> Safety, for example, a safer car, the artificial heart.<eos> And, well, how a handgun might be equipped with a fingerprint scanner.<eos> To keep it from being used by anyone but its owner.
That means you guard my body.<eos> Is that not right?<eos> Not when you're robbing a bank.<eos> At the moment, my body is going to the bank.<eos> It's not robbing it.
I gave you the wrong coin.<eos> The one I gave you was my lucky coin.<eos> Well, you can't afford to be too careless with a lucky coin.<eos> Something like that, you wanna hang on to.<eos> Tell you what, I'll give you your lucky coin back when you tell me how you plucked it out of thin air.

- Officer Myerson.<eos> If you ever need any extra weekend work, you just give us a call.<eos> You got my card?<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Hang onto it.
If I was a plumber, would they make me stop plumbing?<eos> If you were a plumber, you wouldn't be able to post bail.<eos> SVPD called.<eos> There's a box of P.J.'s personal effects down there.<eos> They want to turn it over to family now that he's officially gone.
Hey, did you give Pernell my cell phone number?<eos> No.<eos> Well, he left a message for you.<eos> It's sweet.<eos> Want to hear it?
Ma, wait.<eos> We aren't the only ones who miss him, you know.<eos> I'm not talking about P.J.<eos> But there's this memorial website.<eos> You should see it, Aunt Crystal.
The Great Gatsby.<eos> The novel is quite beautiful.<eos> A man, desperate to belong, trying hard to reinvent his past.<eos> You know, maybe I should check it out again, catch the movie or something.<eos> What you should have checked out was that young man's speech before he gave it, don't you think?
No.<eos> And it cost me everything.<eos> She stole from PJ.<eos> She had his wife raped, off of that fucking software, Bathwater.<eos> What if I can find it?
What's going on?<eos> You know, I was waiting in the parking lot for almost an hour trying to talk myself out of this.<eos> You were right about P.J.'s suicide note.<eos> There's a message.<eos> I just can't figure out what it is.
But that certificate must exist.<eos> It's in the monastery.<eos> But I wouldn't know where to look for it.<eos> And the place makes my skin crawl.<eos> Why don't you look for it?
You caught me in a good mood.<eos> That uniform suits you better.<eos> It seems these colours also suit you.<eos> The sun always rises in the same place.<eos> And we must turn towards it if we want to stay alive.
Why?<eos> Well, this is a Shake Irwin.<eos> Shake Irwin were famous for their grandfather clocks, but this is the only mantel clock they ever produced.<eos> There's not a lot of these around anymore.<eos> Have you had it appraised?
There's your collateral.<eos> We'll do the paperwork and have Troy home in time to cut the grass.<eos> That... It was Mr. Metzger's.<eos> You'll get a receipt.<eos> And we'll take it back to the office and put it in the safe.
It is a real law office.<eos> Someplace we can talk? Sure.<eos> I was thinking of how long it had been since I heard your voice. - Please.<eos> - Let me finish.<eos> I was thinking of how long it had been since I heard your voice, and then I heard it.
-Just a second, sir.<eos> How did you get this address?<eos> From the e-mail.<eos> What e-mail?<eos> Who sent it?
What e-mail?<eos> Who sent it?<eos> One of you guys.<eos> I don't know how you people work.<eos> I'll need to see it.
I've got meetings this afternoon all the way up to the director, and all anyone will want to know is how that shitbag who we had in lockup got released to the streets.<eos> So, what are you gonna tell them?<eos> Everything, including how you used a recording between me and my informant to get your bomber released.<eos> So I need to know-- That recording.<eos> Where did you get it?
Obviously I had no idea what was coming next.<eos> I mean, the explosion, I still don't believe it.<eos> But because the recording got Sekou released, it's important evidence in the bombing investigation.<eos> Now, I've told the FBI<eos> I wouldn't say where I got it, and I won't, but...
What's the issue?<eos> There were some irregularities during his interview.<eos> Evasiveness. - About?<eos> - A one-year gap on his résumé.<eos> How did he explain it? He won't.
May we?<eos> Could we have some privacy, please?<eos> I'm sure you can guess why I'm here.<eos> My deposition--<eos> You want to know why I didn't go through with it.
What if the American people made a mistake? They didn't.<eos> Does it matter if I'm not so sure?<eos> Thank you, Christopher.<eos> The pasta was excellent.<eos> I'm glad you enjoyed it.
Open the fucking door!<eos> ...from dozens of arrests made in connection with the assassination attempt on the President earlier this month.<eos> What the fuck?<eos> According to David Wellington, the President's Chief of Staff, those arrested include officials from all branches of government, including the Department of Defense, State, and the Central Intelligence Agency.<eos> Today, the President is sending a clear message to the American people, that our Democracy is strong and resilient and that we will do whatever it takes to defend it.
I'm standing trial... for embezzlement from the company that I formed when I was 24.<eos> My family... no longer speaks to me.<eos> This morning I...<eos> I sat in a park... where I spent the better moments of my life... with my then-small half-Vietnamese son... and I watched a young boy... engineer and then single-handedly build a splendid sand castle.<eos> And then he rose and gleefully stomped it back once more simply into grains of sand.
Gosh Almighty, who you may know from, I don't know, Italian ceilings? I pronounce you Superman and wife!<eos> Thank you, great and powerful Gosh.<eos> I will see you later on in Heaven for paintball.<eos> Yeah. Believe you me, I wish our marriage was as fake as the Tooth Fairy or magnets.<eos> But someone in the state of Indiana is taking it pretty seriously, because apparently one of us decided to claim a marital tax credit and used the money to buy a Jet Ski.
I suppose it's not as nice as the libraries you're used to, but...<eos> - It's marvelous.<eos> - It's wonderful.<eos> Do you really think so?<eos> That means she likes it.
It's in the impound lot, Katie, the impound lot.<eos> It's barbed wire. There's security cameras. - It's a houseful of cops.<eos> - So you're running?<eos> You've got your bugout bag inside, yeah?<eos> Toss it in my trunk. I will drive you to the train station right now.
Good question.<eos> I'm not supposed to talk about this... but I'm on a list.<eos> What kind of list?<eos> There are about 1,200 people here in the US in the event of a major catastrophe, a nuclear war, terrorism, natural disaster, those things, we all get sequestered.<eos> If society ends, we're the ones who are responsible for rebooting it.
Today the Pilgrim capsule, with its valuable Mars soil samples, completes its eight-month return from Mars.<eos> Preparing to receive these samples has been the purpose of our mission these last few months.<eos> But the Pilgrim capsule is damaged.<eos> At 0630 UTC, Pilgrim was struck by debris and veered off course.<eos> Rory Adams will spacewalk to establish visual contact with the incoming space capsule, and he will grab it with a remote arm.
Did it just move?<eos> Hugh?<eos> My God.<eos> It worked.<eos> You woke it.
Control, this is Station.<eos> Station for Control.<eos> The specimen's location is unknown.<eos> It is to be considered hostile and deadly.<eos> Our intent is to isolate and destroy it in compliance with protocol.
Zelda, Zelda, Zelda, hey, hey, hey, hey.<eos> We can go anywhere and do anything we want.<eos> If you want to go to Paris, we'll go to Paris.<eos> If you want to go to Cairo and ride a camel, I'll be right there with you.<eos> The world is ours, and I want to see every bit of it with you... as long as we're together, because no matter where we are, we're home.
Eh, see, what you feel, the haunted look in your eyes, doesn't come from nowhere.<eos> - Then where does it come from? - In the center of your being, there's a tiny beating heart.<eos> - What, you mean like my soul?<eos> - Part of it, yes, the slimmest part, but it holds specific power.<eos> It's called a shade.
You're copying the entire universe?<eos> ...symmetry down to every last quantum particle with one crucial difference.<eos> The echo universe will be devoid of organic compounds.<eos> Instead, it will be a lifeless cosmos providing a limitless amount of matter that can be transformed into power.<eos> Acting as a dimensional conductor the tower will create multiple gravity portals which will harvest the echo's mass and convert it into pure electromagnetic energy.
The box will counterbalance any instabilities that might occur in the echo.<eos> Instabilities?<eos> Very simple.<eos> It plugs right into the echo tower.<eos> Someone needs to get it there.
- May I?<eos> Just plug it in?<eos> - That's it?<eos> - That's it. There's a terminal at the base of the echo tower.<eos> You jump over, take the box to the tower, plug it in and jump back in time for dinner.
You're one of us!<eos> - Not anymore, Abby.<eos> Just get me into the tower. The tower.<eos> What are you going to do without the box?<eos> They destroyed it!
- What about the box?<eos> Is it safe?<eos> - Yes, sir.<eos> - Good, good.<eos> - Don't let it out of your sight.
I can even leave you my ID.<eos> That's no use to me.<eos> Look.<eos> I can leave this watch as collateral. It's a pretty good one.<eos> My father gave it to me.
No, Booth!<eos> Bones, what the hell are you doing?<eos> Get out of the way.<eos> No, Booth, you don't understand.<eos> The syringe, he wasn't going to use it on me.
Forget about the evidence!<eos> I have to get you somewhere safe.<eos> The door!<eos> It's closing!<eos> Booth, did you find it?
Yeah. - He made it through the explosion.<eos> - Look at that.<eos> Okay. What's with the broken clock?<eos> That stopped when the bombs went off.<eos> When the lab reopens, I'm going to hang it in my new office, to remind me. Always.
- Mmm-hmm.<eos> - So this conversation is over, and I'm gonna go meditate before this stunt.<eos> Did you hear Susan's notes on the séance scene?<eos> - No.<eos> - She said it was "too dramatic."
- Hitchcock's your guy?<eos> - Yes. Oh. Did you write a paper in college about how<eos> Rear Window is about the movie-going experience? What was the original title of Strangers on a Train? I'm Gus, I know everything about Hitchcock.<eos> - Get the fuck out of here. There wasn't an original title for Strangers on a Train.<eos> Oh, and by the way, my professor loved that paper, and he invited me out to lunch to talk about it.
I need to figure out what our victim was investigating.<eos> Dr. Vaziri, I believe I have found something of note.<eos> Look at the distal end of the left ulna.<eos> Torsion spiral fracture.<eos> I've already documented it.
That all went away in the City of Light, but it's back now,<eos> so here we are.<eos> The bullet is pressing against his carotid.<eos> It's cutting off blood flow to his brain.<eos> As soon as I get it out, he should wake up.
You understand?<eos> Before you know it, you'll deserve to survive.<eos> I hope so.<eos> The youth that inherited the earth.<eos> And they have 6 months to save it.
They're not bad for you.<eos> This idea that carbs make you fat is utterly ridiculous.<eos> Carbs cannot make you fat in and of themselves.<eos> We have storage in our muscles and in our liver for carbs called glycogen.<eos> So, when we eat carbs, we either store it or we burn it.
But milk is this hormonal fluid, so it's just packed with sex hormones and natural sex steroid hormones like estrogen, progesterone, in fact, doesn't matter if it's conventional milk, doesn't matter if it's organic milk.<eos> Milk without hormones, that's an oxymoron.<eos> Organic dairy has just as much saturated fat and cholesterol and galactose, all the things that you don't want, as conventional dairy.<eos> Dairy products, in general, have a lot of other products associated with it, not the least of which is pus.<eos> They actually have laws limiting how much pus you can actually have in the milk and still sell it,
So, five years old, holding my "Beauty and the Beast" comforter, I was escorted by the police back to my house.<eos> I understood then the key to happiness.<eos> And what's that?<eos> Active denial.<eos> I looked at that thing, and... and I didn't see it as real.
The universe might be trying to give you a little gift.<eos> Thanks for taking that bullet for me.<eos> You're my hero.<eos> Yeah, well... it was no big deal.<eos> Especially since I didn't take it for you.
This isn't working.<eos> It's just turning him on.<eos> Oh, the good cop, my hero.<eos> He knows the truth, Barbie.<eos> And I'm gonna beat it out of him.
I'm not a scientist. How am I supposed to do that?<eos> All of his research is still in those films.<eos> Okay?<eos> Slink says you just have to find the right reel, and it'll give us the instructions on how to make the cure.<eos> Okay, say I find it, then what?
'Cause here's the truth.<eos> No matter what shit you've been through, it doesn't justify hurting other people.<eos> He taught me that.<eos> Then it's a lie.<eos> No, the truth's the truth, no matter what idiot says it.
- Yes?<eos> Why don't you come in here a minute?<eos> I can hear you fine from out here.<eos> Come on, we've already crossed that threshold.<eos> Wanna cross it again?
The executives assigned to this show decided to test it in Jersey.
Drink up, guys.<eos> Don't need you falling asleep.<eos> Hey, you take care of that battery?<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> It finally shit the bed, but... we swapped it out a couple hours ago.
- You're not like him. - You don't know that, Clary.<eos> You don't know that.<eos> Jace...<eos> Join me... And my son!<eos> Together, we can rid the world of the demons who plague it.
I suppose we both have a healthy dose of the competitive spirit.<eos> I grew up with Jace.<eos> I didn't have much of a choice.<eos> Some people can't be around that energy.<eos> I, in turn, find it invigorating, as I'm sure your exes did as well.
I don't know.<eos> - It's not in the Gray Book.<eos> - I need you to show me.<eos> - Can you do that? - Yeah.<eos> Do you think it's possible my mother sent it?
Look, all I know is Gideon said the motorcycles Darhk and Merlyn stole are here.<eos> What, so we're just supposed to walk around until we see a sign that says, "this way"?<eos> Good idea.<eos> _<eos> Subjugating the world to your rule isn't saving it.
The trigger's rusted over.<eos> That's... that's good, right?<eos> That's... that's a good sign?<eos> No. That's really bad news.<eos> That means we can't disarm it.
- AA stuff.<eos> Yeah. Sorry.<eos> Enjoy.<eos> I just gotta go talk to Andy about some AA stuff, so do you want to pause the episode or is that, like, annoying for people?<eos> Uh, yeah, I guess we'll just keep it running but come back as soon as you can.
Are you okay?<eos> A car hit my shopping cart while I was pushing it.<eos> And I saw a grapefruit explode where my head could've been.<eos> This grapefruit.<eos> Look at it.
- Well...<eos> - For this data cache to have exactly what you needed for this particular guy, it has to be huge.<eos> I think the term is "beyond massive."<eos> What?<eos> One of the last things my dad said to me when he gave me the rags was that they hold a power most people could never even imagine and that I needed to respect and guard that power, not abuse it.
It's called living.<eos> Prometheus has you so fixated on what's wrong with you that you've completely stopped seeing what's right.<eos> You know, John and Felicity, they'll listen to you because you have more to offer than just this.<eos> Your past is a part of you. There is nothing you can do about that.<eos> You can't change it.
Walker was headed for the hangar.<eos> Odds are that's where the nuke is.<eos> Felicity!<eos> Why the ruse?<eos> Why sell a nuclear weapon once when I can steal it back and sell it to another rebel sucker?
I walked right into it.<eos> - What does that mean? - Any attempt to disarm the nuke will exponentially pace up the countdown clock.<eos> Well, w-w-what are you doing?<eos> Hoping like hell I can figure out how to fly a plane.<eos> - What? ! - I can't disarm the nuke, but hopefully I can get it to a less populated area.
Might be a good idea to alert all the emergency rooms?<eos> Do it. What were you doing with a gun in here?<eos> Judging by how I tagged the guy, I got to go with saving people's lives.<eos> Your security detail said the shooter dropped his primary weapon.<eos> We need to get it before the police do.
Mr. Mayor.<eos> What's this? My letter of resignation in which I take sole responsibility for the cover-up.<eos> No.<eos> The cover-up was my idea.<eos> I approved it.
- Thank you.<eos> So what happens next?<eos> You mean, what do I do with your secret?<eos> I keep it.<eos> I care about the city, and... And you're working double time to make it a better place.
Oliver.<eos> We're not targets, man.<eos> We're your teammates.<eos> We're your strength.<eos> You give me strength until Chase turns it into a weakness.
Fortunately, for us we have both friends and money.<eos> As I assume your presence here means that our, uh, ahem, arrangement has, uh, borne fruit.<eos> The shipment was routed to this location.<eos> The BIC codes are inside.<eos> All you have to do is retrieve it.
Luckily, I got a chance to see the file they're working on.<eos> Orekhovo-zuyevo.<eos> It is a--a shipyard in Moscow.<eos> Then we go to the shipyard.<eos> We stop Kovar from retrieving it.
Well, how long will it take you to break the encryption?<eos> If my math is right... 13 months.<eos> Well, I know someone who can break it faster.<eos> Kord Industries.<eos> I mean, they set the encryption. They can break it.
What do you mean, you hurt her?<eos> I was reheating some soup for her.<eos> It was just about all I could make her...<eos> And it was on the stove, and I pass out drunk.<eos> Poor Zoe, she's trying to grab it and pulls it down, and it burns her hand real bad...
How's it going over here?<eos> Well, every defense attorney in town just found out that the D.A. is a serial killer, so not good.<eos> You think the court's gonna overturn Chase's convictions?<eos> If I didn't, I wouldn't have convened this war room.<eos> It'd sure be nice to have a mayor heading it up, though.
We've run every incoming and outgoing phone call on Burkhardt's cell phone.<eos> Besides the ones we've already checked, there's only one other number that has any kind of frequency.<eos> What is it?<eos> Probably doesn't mean anything.<eos> We checked it out.
But I'm fine. - No, you're not.<eos> I'm sorry, but I'm not gonna leave until you talk to me.<eos> Remember when you said "when things get crazy, don't push me away"?<eos> When I was tortured in Valentine's body, that agony rune made me relive my worst memory.<eos> And now... I can't get it out of my head.
Yeah, I'm fine.<eos> You know an Iratze might be able to help you out with that.<eos> Oh no.<eos> I don't have my stele.<eos> I must have dropped it when I hit the water.
Yeah, I mean... you know, theoretically.<eos> And you were giving me crap about my portal?<eos> I didn't say I couldn't do it.<eos> Yeah, on second thought, my stele might actually come in handy.<eos> We should head back to the lake and see if we can find it.
Mom, come on, that's not... That's not really a thing.<eos> I mean, like, it should be private.<eos> Well, in our family it's a thing.<eos> Simon's father started this tradition 13 years ago.<eos> And now we keep it alive in his memory.
Or what?<eos> Or she could lose her mind forever.<eos> Do you remember my eighth birthday?<eos> It was the day you gave me my first seraph blade.<eos> I was so excited to use it that I snuck out of the cabin on my own.
Oh, yes, this is the locket. For her Sweet 16.<eos> - Are you sure it's all Rebecca's?<eos> - Oh, yes.<eos> I was going to buy her a housewarming present, not because I wanted to be clingy or judgmental. Actually, a good mother.<eos> And, um, I went online and... tried to find the new address, since, you know, she wouldn't give it to me.
Shit. That's mine.<eos> - Passcode?<eos> - 7-1-8-7.<eos> Nate says, "Thanks for the air mattress.<eos> Return it next week."
No backing out in this game, okay?<eos> Well, I wouldn't use a gun or a knife, unless it was self-defense.<eos> I think I would... use my mind.<eos> Reading people.<eos> I'd figure out their weakness, and... exploit it.
Nothing out of the ordinary.<eos> Good, well...<eos> I am going to recommend that Dolly try a period of medication.<eos> I just figured I'd get the prescription filled.<eos> I didn't say I was gonna actually start giving it to her.
You might be good at fooling others, but I know you, Jeanie.<eos> I'm not trying to fool anyone.<eos> I mean, just think if you had to live in that one-bedroom apartment.<eos> I like that apartment.<eos> Oh, I know, I'm still paying for it.
Perhaps they try to distract you through intimidation or lies, so you don't see their truth, their guilt, their own shame.<eos> It's deeply embedded from their history, their experiences, even their upbringing.<eos> And, lastly, there's the ones who want power, because they just don't want to feel powerless any longer.<eos> They need an outlet.<eos> To really have power, one must have it over something or someone.
Thank you for my present, by the way.<eos> What present?<eos> My coin.<eos> Yeah, I know someone looking for that coin.<eos> Well, they can't have it.
Oh! My lucky coin, Ginger Minge.<eos> Fuck.<eos> My husband gave that coin to me.<eos> Damn his dark eyes.<eos> Gave it a-fucking-way.
This man deserves our respect.<eos> Fuck respect.<eos> My gift to you.<eos> We'll be telling this story, Shadow.<eos> You can tell it however you like or don't like.
So you failed.<eos> So nobody came to your opening.<eos> Don't end it like this.<eos> Greatness takes time... and you know this.<eos> If a string is in a knot, patience will untie it.
It's not bacteria. Antibiotics won't work.<eos> We have to do something.<eos> Nothing's not an option.<eos> Okay, what do you do when a banana ripens too quickly?<eos> - Put it in the freezer.
This troubles you.<eos> Another life that could've been and never was.<eos> Caitlin and Ronnie should've had that.<eos> A family, a future.<eos> The future doesn't always turn out as we want it to.
Sounds like she's in trouble.<eos> Here, stand back, I'm gonna kick the door in.<eos> You stand back, I'll kick the door in.<eos> Well, I didn't mean, like, a gender thing.<eos> - I just wanted to kick it in...
She's an incredibly brave, strong woman.<eos> One look, and you can see that.<eos> And she wants to be with him.<eos> No matter how scared she was to tell you, no matter how dangerous it is to be with him, all that matters is, they're together.<eos> And when you find a love like that, well... you gotta hold on to it.
He calls himself Abra Kadabra.<eos> As in hocus pocus?<eos> He's certainly got a lot of tricks.<eos> Yeah, we think he has some sort of nanotechnology built into his body... allows him to do some extraordinary feats.<eos> Teleportation, telekinesis, you name it, and believe me, I have seen it all.
Easy.<eos> Come on.<eos> Gentle, gentle.<eos> Yeah, yeah, yup.<eos> The, um, the... hand me the X-ray machine, - grab it for us, would you, please? - Yup.
He can learn.<eos> I still know how to do everything.<eos> I can teach him. Okay.<eos> Maybe this is how you defeat Savitar.<eos> But there's still a lot of villains in this city, and no Flashes to protect it.
- So, we're building a cannon...<eos> - Right.<eos> ... bazooka... thing.<eos> It's a sort of trap.<eos> In order to turn it on, we need something to power it.
For what?<eos> Oh... it doesn't matter.<eos> - Well, should I stop them?<eos> - No.<eos> Let them take it.
Anyway, according to this, the bell measurements are an exact match to what Dalton St. John wrote about.<eos> That's what Seline was looking for in 1883.<eos> Why would she care about our church bell?<eos> Peter Maxwell was the last one to have his hands on that witches' bell.<eos> Right up until he threw it off a bridge, some 20-odd years ago.
- Any other useless demands?<eos> I'm not gonna release them until you bring me that bell.<eos> What do you even want this bell for?<eos> I'm sentimental.<eos> I want it.
I'm not gonna release them until you bring me that bell.<eos> What do you even want this bell for?<eos> I'm sentimental.<eos> I want it.<eos> And I need your help to find it.
You okay?<eos> I'm fine.<eos> I just need to get Sybil the antique bell that your dad threw off Wickery Bridge.<eos> Wait, slow down, you lost me after "I'm fine."<eos> When your dad lived in Mystic Falls, he took our charter bell to Wickery Bridge, and then threw it off the railing.
I'm fine.<eos> I just need to get Sybil the antique bell that your dad threw off Wickery Bridge.<eos> Wait, slow down, you lost me after "I'm fine."<eos> When your dad lived in Mystic Falls, he took our charter bell to Wickery Bridge, and then threw it off the railing.<eos> And now Sybil wants it back.
Besides, we know Sybil's field trip was headed near Mystic Falls.<eos> We're going in the right direction.<eos> All because she wants a bell.<eos> I've never heard of anything so insane.<eos> Says the guy who threw it off the bridge.
I mean, what were you thinking, anyway?<eos> - I was thinking about the parade.<eos> - What?<eos> The Founders Day parade.<eos> You know, the one where they put the charter bell on a float, and some rich guy rings it while two dumbasses stand on either side of him wearing moldy Civil War uniforms?
I figured it out from Dalton's measurements.<eos> The Maxwell heirloom and the tuning fork, those things fit together to make a clapper, the hammer that swings inside a bell.<eos> So those three missing things, they're all a part of one bell.<eos> When properly assembled, this bell becomes, like, a mystical, witchified super-bell.<eos> I mean, it makes you wonder what happens when you ring it.
No.<eos> You know him by another name: the devil.<eos> Seline's there, too.<eos> She has the tuning fork.<eos> They're forcing Ethan to add it to the bell.
Beatrice, she has a plan to stop the sirens.<eos> You did it.<eos> They're trapped.<eos> As are you, Mr. Maxwell.<eos> You made the bell. And the witches cursed it, so the blood of a hundred souls are on your hands.
I mean, that is if you wanna hear how we're gonna exterminate every last vampire in America.<eos> You're always playing the middle.<eos> For once, why don't you pick a side?<eos> The hellhounds.<eos> See, when you sell your soul to a demon, they're the one that come and rip it out of you.
You slaughtered the competition.<eos> Sometimes literally.<eos> And yet, I never slaughtered you, ketch.<eos> Well, we were having a lot of sex at the time.<eos> I've been studying the American situation and how to fix it for years.
There are many police inspectors, concerned citizens and television executives who have expressed confusion as to how the Baudelaire orphans ended up in Count Olaf's so-called care.<eos> The scene you see behind me is called a flashback.<eos> That is a word which here means<eos> "taken place during the events of the last episode, shortly after the Baudelaire fire and during the Baudelaire children's unfortunate stay with the Poe family."<eos> I present it to you now in the hopes that the police inspectors, concerned citizens and television executives might finally leave me alone.
Besides, Count Olaf is after the fortune we will inherit.<eos> Killing us will do him no good.<eos> What good would it do to be in a performance of The Marvelous Marriage?<eos> Marriage is like sharing a root beer float, or agreeing to be the back half of a horse costume.<eos> Even when it's happening onstage, you should only do it with the people you love.
They'll munch on your head They'll munch on your head?<eos> ? You're a tasty treat You're a tasty treat?<eos> ? For the walking dead?<eos> The sturdy oak barrier!<eos> They've broken through it!
"used by so many writers, it is a tiresome cliché,"<eos> while "meanwhile back at the ranch" is a phrase used to link what is going on in one part of a story with another part, and has nothing to do with cows or creamy salad dressing.<eos> When I say, "Meanwhile back at the ranch,"<eos> what I mean is, meanwhile, back in the Reptile Room, the adults were having an adult conversation.<eos> If we place the peaches in a line leading up to the cage, perhaps the snake will follow the trail and then we can trap it inside.
KLAUS: It's Uncle Monty's handwriting.<eos> He must have copied it down during the movie.<eos> We were right next to him.<eos> If he got a message, we would've seen it.<eos> Not if he had some secret way to receive it.
Still, Kirkman's smart, and he's learning on the job.<eos> I've seen bare-knuckle campaigners barely make it through a single term as president.<eos> You can't learn on the job.<eos> It's taken everything in my empty soul to get back in this game, and there's zero chance I'm gonna let some amateurs in diapers push me out again.<eos> There's a connection between MacLeish and the shooter, and I'm gonna find it.
- I'm sure I did.<eos> No. No.<eos> Why'd you have it changed?<eos> You worried about the Dockery bail?<eos> No, it's just good to change it every now and then.
I see no reason to deny you bond, which I set now at $2,500.<eos> I fucked up.<eos> Chuck bamboozled me again.<eos> That tape?<eos> He made sure that Ernie heard it, right?
I fucked up.<eos> Chuck bamboozled me again.<eos> That tape?<eos> He made sure that Ernie heard it, right?<eos> Because he knew Ernie, bless him, would tell me about it and I would come over to try to destroy it or steal it or whatever.
I felt that a recorded confession -- if I could get one -- was my best bet.<eos> On its own, I knew the tape would be somewhat flimsy, but it was a start.<eos> A foundation for a more ironclad case.<eos> I suppose that Jimmy must have felt the tape was decisive evidence on its own.<eos> Otherwise, he wouldn't have broken in to destroy it. Objection.
Every one of them came here gladly in support of their lawyer.<eos> Jimmy McGill reached out to people who otherwise may never have seen an attorney in their entire lives.<eos> He took the time to make sure they had wills that accurately reflected their wishes, for a price they could afford, because Jimmy McGill cares about people.<eos> He's devoted the past three years of his life to his brother's welfare.<eos> Waking at 5:00 in the morning to buy Charles' favorite newspaper from the single newsstand in the city that carries it.
Hey.<eos> Hey.<eos> What's up?<eos> Uh, new guitar.<eos> Check it out.
So I speak with the confidence only a twin could have...<eos> Jason wouldn't want us to spend the year mourning.<eos> Jason would want us to move on with our lives.<eos> Which is why I've asked the School Board not to cancel the Back-to-School semiformal.<eos> But rather, to let us use it as a way to heal, collectively, and celebrate my brother's too, too short life on this mortal coil.
Own what?<eos> Okay, if I had a football game tomorrow night, would you stop me from going?<eos> No, because football you understand.<eos> You respect. But my music, since I told you about it, you don't care.<eos> You don't take it seriously.
He has an extremely long reach, your father.<eos> And he's sunk every last penny that we have into this deal.<eos> So... Dad really is...<eos> Dad is a businessman.<eos> He saw an opportunity, and he took it.
Someone planted the gun...<eos> Jason's murder weapon, in a closet in FP's trailer.<eos> It wasn't there when we searched for it.<eos> He's being framed, Betty.<eos> Well, maybe you didn't see it.
We all did.<eos> Breaking into your dad's trailer was wrong, but at least some good came out of it.<eos> Pretty sure my dad was just arrested for murder.<eos> That gun wasn't there when we searched his trailer.<eos> Someone put it there after we left.
Set up a drop-off point for payment to get him back.<eos> Before I sent word to Blossom, the kid got loose.<eos> Tried to escape.<eos> And that's when you shot him and stuffed him in the freezer.<eos> Once things quieted down, and your guys were done dragging Sweetwater River for his body, that's when I dumped it.
Betty, people, not just the police, are going after the Serpents.<eos> The whole town agrees with Mayor McCoy.<eos> Crime is spreading.<eos> There's real anger out there, Betty.<eos> And they're needing to focus it somewhere.
I...<eos> Me being alive one of them.<eos> So we don't want cops sniffing around.<eos> I can get rid of the body.<eos> Just help me pick it up.
Me being alive one of them.<eos> So we don't want cops sniffing around.<eos> I can get rid of the body.<eos> Just help me pick it up.<eos> Help him pick it up.
Well, where have you been, Norman?<eos> Ham's better on sourdough.<eos> I'm making it on wheat.<eos> The kitchen was pretty messy.<eos> I must have just cleaned it up and forgotten.
It's okay.<eos> Then why do I feel so horrible, mother?<eos> Are you okay?<eos> Sorry about the lamp.<eos> I'll pay for it.
But you couldn't save her.<eos> All you could do was watch, watch her get abused.<eos> I don't want to feel this.<eos> You wanted to know the truth?<eos> Well, I don't want to know it anymore... you wanted to understand who I am?
I'm pretty sure you saved my life.<eos> - That was my goal.<eos> - I know I had a gun with me.<eos> Where is it?<eos> - You must have dropped it.
Well, I've read all your poetry.<eos> I'm sure I'm one of your biggest fans.<eos> "My candle burns at both ends;<eos> "It will not last the night;<eos> "But ah, my foes, and oh, my friends... It gives a lovely light!"
Okay. So if a straight boy and girl are of similar hotness, and spend a lot of time together, sooner or later, one of them has a crush?<eos> Usually the boy.<eos> It's just biology.<eos> Must have missed that chapter.<eos> Jonah got a message from Grace, and when I tried to see it, he freaked.
It's just...<eos> It's hard see him in that bed.<eos> Yeah. I...<eos> I totally get it. But I was serious about serving tonight.<eos> And he gave it to me right there in class.
Twenty-two years!<eos> Never cheated.<eos> Not once.<eos> And I had the chance... more than a few times.<eos> But I never ever took it.
- Bye.<eos> What?<eos> Now we've reached our happily ever after.<eos> To celebrate, pick up your prom tickets in student council.<eos> If Siri knows the capital of Finland, then why do we have to memorize it?
Tarly, I'd like to speak with you in my study this evening.<eos> How bad is it?<eos> Suppose I'll find out this evening.<eos> Where will you go?<eos> I surrendered to this sickness the moment I first saw it.
Ah, stranger things have happened.<eos> Like what?<eos> The granaries are being emptied and loaded into wagons, my lord.<eos> - The current harvest?<eos> - We have teams of men collecting it from all the farms in the Reach.
That's Cersei Lannister, not me.<eos> I'm not here to murder, and all I want to destroy is the wheel that has rolled over rich and poor to the benefit of no one but the Cersei Lannisters of the world.<eos> I offer you a choice...<eos> Bend the knee and join me.<eos> Together, we will leave the world a better place than we found it.
Uh, take all the time you need.<eos> I'll be, uh, outside.<eos> Does Otto know about this?<eos> The deed's in my name.<eos> After the stroke, we transferred it all to me. Audrey, this sale's a mistake.
Usually alone.<eos> Thank you for making an exception.<eos> Please.<eos> And so, I do hope you'll forgive Mr. Zerk for his hands-on approach. Maybe.<eos> But I sure won't forget it.
- Red.<eos> - Red.<eos> - So make it so.<eos> Change it. Turn the wall red, Mary.<eos> Just turn it red.
You think I've never been stuck in the tub?<eos> Uh, Frankie... this is the TV remote.<eos> Oh, great. I could use some River Monsters right about now.<eos> Why is the TV remote in the phone cradle?<eos> So I'll remember where it is.
Yes, I do.<eos> But God isn't sending me to burn for all of eternity.<eos> Well, then I guess it's a question of degrees, Sol.<eos> I agree.<eos> I've always thought religion is most beneficial when it's taken à la carte.
If she's as good as her word, and one thing she certainly wasn't was a liar, then her book of Battle Magic will be found here.<eos> - In this room.<eos> - Why?<eos> She told me. "The Battle Magic will be "where the knowledge always is.<eos> "The day you need it, I promise, it will be your last hope."
You know what I like to do?<eos> When I've had a bad day, it feels like I got nothing but problems?<eos> I like to go in the bathroom and lock the door behind me.<eos> Open it.<eos> You open it.
Look.<eos> Look at the eye.<eos> Heather.<eos> Heather.<eos> Interesting, you had a gun but you didn't use it.
- You're swearing a lot tonight.<eos> - Yeah, I've noticed that too.<eos> Well, obviously, sweetie, I didn't know we'd be burying the container.<eos> What did you think, honeybunch?<eos> We'd take it home with us and clean it out and use it to store our taxes, which we can't do because it doesn't have a fucking lid.
You gonna fuck it?<eos> Yes, we're gonna fuck it.<eos> All night long.<eos> So... what would that cost?<eos> We'd want to take it with us, of course, because we're shy.
- Ooh, what's happening?<eos> - Now, ma'am.<eos> Dan Wells, Portland PD!<eos> We're gonna need you to open the door.<eos> Dan, if you don't open the door, we're gonna break it down.
'Cause it says in one of your mother's books that blood is associated with crossing over in death, like slain warriors on the battlefield, or a hunter's prey in its final state... human sacrifice on the altar... and sometimes blood is used as currency.<eos> - Eve, slow down.<eos> - What if blood could be used as a form of payment to pass into the other world?<eos> Blood magic is very dangerous.<eos> We would only need to use it to get to the other side.
Only night shift employees are allowed in.<eos> I know, but I'll just be a minute.<eos> I left my purse in my locker.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> You can get it tomorrow.
You can look on the negative side, and cry and complain.<eos> Or look on the fun side, enjoy it, laugh, and move forward.<eos> That's what I've chosen to do.<eos> Everything in life has its good side, even Madrid.<eos> Even if you don't see it.
Don't tell me you're here to renegotiate the terms.<eos> I'm not taking it.<eos> - Mike...<eos> - Just listen to me.<eos> When I was on trial, I said that I was given a gift and I threw it away.
I'm here for a fresh start.<eos> I assume by "fresh start,"<eos> you mean you want me to do something to help Mike Ross now that he's out in the world.<eos> Anita, you heard his speech to that jury.<eos> He was given a gift and he threw it away.
These kids need your help.<eos> I wanted to help people as a lawyer, not as a teacher.<eos> What's the difference?<eos> Difference is, clients actually want my help.<eos> Michael, these kids need it.
- Watch yourself, Harvey.<eos> - Robert...<eos> I'm not looking to get in a fight with you.<eos> But as my partner told you before, we don't need your charity.<eos> Then I'll stop giving it to you.
Your Honor, Mr. Grady gave me a copy of this nonsense 20 minutes ago, and he specifically agreed it wasn't relevant.<eos> That... that is a lie. Because I have a phone record of a two-minute call that I made to you ten minutes ago.<eos> You may have called me, but we didn't talk about that. Just because I called you doesn't mean I can prove what we talked about.<eos> Your Honor, she called 20 times.<eos> Yeah, probably to say why her rent was late, because she never paid it.
Did you think I wouldn't check up on you when all of a sudden, a queens legal clinic starts acting like a midtown law form.<eos> Well, I did.<eos> And if this goes to trial, he's the one I'm up against, and we all know what happened last time.<eos> - You wouldn't be here if that's all you wanted to tell me.<eos> - So why don't you give me a number, and I'll take it to my client.
- Yes, I do. if she thinks I have confidence in her, not that you don't have confidence in me.<eos> - you're back.<eos> - You better believe I'm back, because I looked into what you're doing<eos> - There's really not much to find, Mr. specter.<eos> - Well, let me lay it out for you. Velocity data solutions stole your technology, and they're rushing it to market, so you want to orchestrate a takeover and get back what's yours.
- No.<eos> - We can ask for a special exemption, and- and I said no, all right?<eos> They will not Grant it, and that is not your place here.<eos> - Then at least I can sit near him, and I can- you hear me right now!<eos> I gave you a chance, because I needed it, but if you risk the reputation of this clinic over one housing case, i will fire you and make sure that you are banned from ever sitting foot in a courtroom again.
Do you understand that?<eos> - You're not fucked.<eos> - This is the only thing left for me to do.<eos> Just put the gun down.<eos> Just put it down.
He's not gonna do that.<eos> He said I'm like a son to him.<eos> He wouldn't do that.<eos> Have you ever wondered where the murder weapon is?<eos> The night everything happened, Shakowski tells you to go out and bring it back to him.
I can't move.<eos> I can't do anything.<eos> You know what? This is bullshit.<eos> You slipped me a date fajita.<eos> Gave me all the ingredients, made me put it together and now you're burning the shit out of me.
Give it!<eos> - Hop on.<eos> - You bitch!<eos> You know, I didn't need your help.<eos> Yeah, but you took it.
A while back, someone at this address bought a leather jacket from me.<eos> Had a parrot on the collar.<eos> Yeah.<eos> It belongs to the old ball and chain.<eos> Wore it the time we went and visited that big-ass cave up in Kentucky.
Wore it the time we went and visited that big-ass cave up in Kentucky.<eos> That's great.<eos> See, all of my current misery can be traced back to the decision to sell that jacket.<eos> So...<eos> - I need it.
She paid a lot of money for that.<eos> Well, I can give her two grand cash.<eos> It's yours.<eos> Is she gonna fuck that jacket?<eos> And then flip it for more money.
- I'm here, gentlemen.<eos> Put your dicks away.<eos> I'll do no such thing.<eos> Chuck, your death scene seems to be getting longer and more moving every night.<eos> The crowd loved it.
Do the others.<eos> You have to wait for the build.<eos> Our website should be easy to use, but also cool to look at.<eos> I don't want people to think they're buying a lame textbook.<eos> That's great, but who's gonna make it so that it actually works and stuff?
Okay, Donna. Show of force it is.<eos> Holy shit, Otis Redding's first album?<eos> You sure Harvey won't mind if I take it out?<eos> Are you kidding me?<eos> No, he says if that collection's not for everyone, then what's the point of even having it here?
There's gonna be a lot of blood.<eos> We need to wrap him up in something that doesn't leak.<eos> We're gonna have to get him to the car in something that doesn't look suspicious.<eos> With a body in it, that trunk is going to be heavy.<eos> Then we won't carry it.
You're welcome.<eos> Okay, this isn't how I wanted this to go.<eos> Uh, we're both inhuman.<eos> And as you say, we're stuck with each other, so... why not make the most of it?<eos> I read your written statement, and I believe it.
Vijay, don't do this.<eos> You're making a mistake.<eos> He's not safe with her.<eos> Jemma...<eos> Vijay had a choice, and he made it.
Please be patient.<eos> While we're waiting, perhaps you could tell me why you dislike the Inhumans so much.<eos> Yes, some of them are monsters, true, but ...<eos> These Inhumans... they did not suffer, labor to become what they are.<eos> They have great power... but they didn't earn it.
Until now.<eos> Pure Terrigen crystals.<eos> I picked up some samples last year when I was working for a... previous benefactor.<eos> His goals were ...<eos> well, the complete opposite of yours, so I've been working to refine the compound, grow it ...
Yeah.<eos> Wait.<eos> What?<eos> That blue soap everyone uses?<eos> Hydra loads it up with chemicals.
Got to be contraband.<eos> They busted my neighbor for a laptop last night.<eos> - The drone... it's in my bag.<eos> - What?<eos> I was gonna take it back myself so you wouldn't get in trouble.
We liberated this guy last year.<eos> This is a Quinjet?<eos> Yeah.<eos> And that fleet Mace described?<eos> You commanded it.
I didn't think Fitz was capable of doing something like that.<eos> Oh, my dear.<eos> Depending on the circumstances, anyone is capable of anything.<eos> Just look around.<eos> Please tell me that you built a back door to this place and that Aida hasn't destroyed it.
He's got no reason to lie.<eos> Maybe someone else found it and took it.<eos> The back door is part of the Framework's digital infrastructure.<eos> - It can't be moved.<eos> - But it could be concealed.
"regret."<eos> You built an empire by eliminating the regrets of others.<eos> How does it taste on your tongue?<eos> I want to burn this world to the ground.<eos> I thought you wanted to rule it.
Okay.<eos> See you then.<eos> What about me?<eos> What about my soul?<eos> We could test it if you want to.
Fuck.<eos> A rose is a rose, except here.<eos> Here it has to mean something.<eos> It's beautiful.<eos> Mrs. Waterford cut it special.
Harvey, I'm running out of ways to tell you I don't want to be a corporate lawyer.<eos> I'm offering you a deal.<eos> One for you, one for me.<eos> I don't wanna just fund the clinic for a year.<eos> I want to fund it for two, and any case I want to bring the clinic onto, I can.
and at the exact moment that hope is abandoned, our savior will reveal himself to the frightened masses.<eos> ingenious.<eos> The world on its knees, begging for direction like the ugly girl at a gang bang.<eos> Your uniform.<eos> some of the men find it a bit... Flamboyant.
That looks good to you?<eos> We never tried to feed you a fish.<eos> We're gonna have to work on how you talk about me.<eos> No. Frozen is the closest thing to fresh.<eos> What if we got a meat freezer and put it in the storage unit and when we kill somebody, we can just chisel off chunks of it when I need to eat.
I couldn't control it.<eos> And the street's right there, what if somebody sees us?<eos> What are we gonna do?<eos> Okay, there's nobody around, it's dark, and there are no security cameras.<eos> We'll wrap his body in a tarp, put it in our car, take it to the storage unit where you can eat.
- Mine's broken.<eos> Honestly.<eos> Okay, today has obviously been intense and it's taking a toll on you.<eos> We don't have time for this.<eos> We have to get the body out of here by morning or the dogs will find it.
- Hmm.<eos> [phone recorder beeps] "Like a drop of dew embraces a blade of grass."<eos> That's good.<eos> Really? You like that? I think the imagery feels a little familiar.<eos> I think it's beautiful.
- I know it's another long shot, but...<eos> - Whatever it is, I'm in.<eos> You are?<eos> Abby's gonna grow up to be an amazing woman, and I want to be around to see as much of that as I can.<eos> So if there's a chance for a cure, no matter how much of a long shot, I wanna take it.
[symphonic music playing]<eos> [Eric] Sometimes the world casts aside the one person who can save it.
Something written 500 years ago is going to help me.<eos> And here... is the remedy.<eos> It's taken me years to find the modern-day equivalent of these medieval Serbian ingredients.<eos> You can't just run down to the store and get myrrh.<eos> But I've tested the formula and it works.
Yes, I did.<eos> Finally.<eos> Some truth in the night.<eos> Julius, I work at a law clinic, but not as a lawyer.<eos> An opportunity presented itself for me to become one and I turned it down, but then I had to sit there and watch a woman get put on the street because I couldn't help her.
Some truth in the night.<eos> Julius, I work at a law clinic, but not as a lawyer.<eos> An opportunity presented itself for me to become one and I turned it down, but then I had to sit there and watch a woman get put on the street because I couldn't help her.<eos> And I knew I'd have to watch that happen over and over and over.<eos> So when that opportunity presented itself for the second time, I took it.
Why are you giving me a peace sign?<eos> - Double it.<eos> - What?<eos> I don't wanna just fund the clinic for a year.<eos> I wanna fund it for two.
You're welcome.<eos> I'll let you get back to work.<eos> All I'm saying is I think you're rushing it.<eos> And I'm saying that, when you overthrow a dictator, you don't leave their statue up in the square.<eos> You tear it the hell down.
I like that skirt. Focus, focus.<eos> And the rib, which the Lord God had taken from man, made he a woman, and brought her unto the man.<eos> My bones, flesh of my flesh, she shall be called Woman, because she was...<eos> They were naked, the man and the wife, and they were not ashamed.<eos> May God bless this union... And make it fruitful.
Just one last try.<eos> What's that?<eos> Whitford gave me a gun. It's just in case.<eos> Okay? Jesus.<eos> Do you know how to use it?
Whitford gave me a gun. It's just in case.<eos> Okay? Jesus.<eos> Do you know how to use it?<eos> Yeah, a little.<eos> I know how to load it.
Yeah, a little.<eos> I know how to load it.<eos> Look, we need to be ready, all right, June?<eos> It's just in case.<eos> Then show me how to load it.
They sent my bag to the wrong hotel.<eos> Got your little suit, guy?<eos> She'll blow that lie out in two seconds if she cares to.<eos> No courier was sent with my bag.<eos> No hotel received it.
I think she does.<eos> I think the bag got away. How?<eos> He had one transfer, A to B.<eos> I've been told that before, on occasion.<eos> El-Mashad's wife was supposed to take it today.
- Daya, maybe it's, uh, time to rest?<eos> Yeah, I just gotta get my gun back from Pidge. What?<eos> Oh.<eos> Still can't believe you let her have it and not me.<eos> She's ready to hand it back.
I'm dealing with a lot of shit on planet Earth right now.<eos> Not really giving space a lot of thought.<eos> You sound just like Sister Ingalls.<eos> She hates the space program.<eos> Thinks it's a waste of resources.
I was sent to Earth to protect my cousin.<eos> But my pod got knocked off-course and by the time I got here, my cousin had already grown up and become Superman.<eos> I hid who I really was until one day when an accident forced me to reveal myself to the world.<eos> To most people I'm a reporter at CatCo Worldwide Media.<eos> But in secret, I work with my adoptive sister for the DEO to protect my city from alien life and anyone else that means to cause it harm.
Seriously, you idiots haven't figured this out by now?<eos> It all started when we blew up the time pigs, the Time Masters, now history's all screwed up, and it's up to us to unscrew it up.
Previously, on "Legends of Tomorrow"...<eos> It's a compass.<eos> Either of you gentlemen heard of the Spear of Destiny?<eos> The spear could alter reality itself.<eos> We broke it into four separate pieces.
You have mine.<eos> I don't understand why it's so hard for me to get yours.<eos> That was good.<eos> Is there a technique to that or were you just giving it a swift kick in the caboose?<eos> Because if there's a technique, I wanna know it.
You need to keep your guard up. 'Cause Cadmus does have a weapon.<eos> What is it?<eos> A nuclear fusion bomb.<eos> They're going to destroy National City, and blame it on hostile aliens.<eos> How did Cadmus get their hands on it? Well, they didn't steal it.

He's got drugs hidden under the floorboards in his bedroom.<eos> Sorry I'm late.<eos> Do you have my wallet?<eos> No.<eos> I have it.
They're checking surrounding businesses for CCTV.<eos> Yeah, well, there's nothing in here to indicate he was meeting anyone.<eos> Guitar supplies but no guitar.<eos> No, he'd take it with him.<eos> If he has a guitar, he wouldn't check it.
Keith's guitar. Okay, so he spots Keith with the guitar or spots the killer himself who's taken the guitar from Keith.<eos> Follows him home.<eos> We know Woody found his targets at the mall.<eos> Why does the killer take the guitar to the mall?<eos> Try to resell it? Get it appraised?
She got her hands on your burner phone, dialed the only number in there.<eos> She blew your cover.<eos> You're wrong.<eos> You found the recording later, after the raid went bad.<eos> You found it and you erased it.
It's not sustainable.<eos> I mean, what do you think?<eos> -About what?<eos> -About the president's rush to war.<eos> At least half the Beltway seems to think it's outrageous.
Now you're trying to look casual, like you're just standing there, but you're still covering up the same portion of the kayak while you're just standing there.<eos> Am I?<eos> May I see that portion?<eos> Well, it's not a big thing.<eos> I... I need to see it.
Well, it's not a big thing.<eos> I... I need to see it.<eos> It's not a big crack. I-It's just a surface thing.<eos> And it's as advertised.<eos> - I need to see it. - It's as advertised.
Mom, I'm so cold.<eos> Vincent, what the hell is this?<eos> That witch, he used their personal items to bind them to the spell.<eos> Totems.<eos> I know this magic, I-I can reverse it.
I think I'll hold on to it for now.<eos> This wasn't a gift.<eos> Today proved Marcel's a threat, whether used as a sacrifice or possessed.<eos> Regardless...<eos> What good is having a weapon if you won't use it?
No, they didn't.<eos> We hid it, remember?<eos> - We did?<eos> - In the secret place!<eos> The secret place where no one else would ever find it.
- You stole our gun?<eos> - No, it was in her belt.<eos> - Angie, are you fucking kidding me?<eos> - What?<eos> You put it on your belt!
- I told you.<eos> Yeah, I get that it's a cloaking device.<eos> But why keep it that shape?<eos> Why do you like it?<eos> Who said I like it?
Yeah, I get that it's a cloaking device.<eos> But why keep it that shape?<eos> Why do you like it?<eos> Who said I like it?<eos> You kept it.
Aren't you listening?<eos> I pressed the reset button.<eos> Every computer has one and anyone can find it, especially if they happen to be a scary, handsome genius from space.<eos> I re-initialised the entire command structure, retaining all programmed abilities but deleting the supplementary preference architecture.<eos> He turned it off and on again.

It's already been launched!<eos> - Then redirect it.<eos> - Whe... I...<eos> What do we do? Wh...<eos> Where do we send it? Move.
Thanks.<eos> Normally, street art, it scares me, but this is very pretty.<eos> I wasn't goin' for pretty.<eos> Well, I... I like how it tells a story.<eos> How love gives you legs to stand on, and without it, you're just a disgusting, deformed cripple.
Can't we just enjoy the fact that I'm back?<eos> I missed you.<eos> Come here.<eos> You know how pissed the cops are gonna be when they see you on television before you've given them a statement?<eos> Honey, the only point of giving an exclusive is so you can tell your story to a worldwide audience before you tell it to anybody else.
You shot a motherfucking guard and you gonna "hey" me?<eos> What the fuck is wrong with you?<eos> Everything, apparently.<eos> Where'd you get a goddamn gun?<eos> I don't know. He brought it. That Humps guy.
He will bathe his feet in the blood of the wicked."<eos> Oh, I bet your feet are disgusting.<eos> You see, this is the thing about female prisoners.<eos> Men understand violence.<eos> They respect it.
Even warm beer tastes good after a win.<eos> Look, we just broke a million views!<eos> A million people have seen what a pathetic, abusive little man you are.<eos> Your hand could fit twice around that girl's arm.<eos> Yet you still needed to break it to hold her back.
Piper, honey, is that you?<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> My child is trapped in a prison riot.<eos> One shows up for those sorts of things.<eos> Please tell me you're not leading it.
It does not belong to you or your red-blooded king.<eos> I can't let you leave with it.<eos> You don't have a choice.<eos> Good technique.<eos> I know it well.
I got pushback from the precinct captains like you wouldn't believe.<eos> - You said you were gonna deploy troops.<eos> - I tried that, too.<eos> I floated the order past Roger Frank at the ACLU.<eos> He mentioned it to Barney Leonard at the Black Coalition.
They simply cease to exist.<eos> So, there's no trace of them left?<eos> They've been obliterated?<eos> - Slade?<eos> What's the point in having this gift if you can't use it the way you need to?
More lemonade, please.<eos> Redneck and a hillbilly are strolling along a country lane, talking about the Garden of Eden.<eos> The redneck, drinking whiskey as he walks... believes that Adam and Eve had every right to take that apple... for, if God were kind... why would he forbid them from partaking in that delicious fruit?<eos> The hillbilly listens and nods.<eos> Then the redneck finishes the bottle and throws it onto the path.
Martin Byrde.<eos> Said his employer wouldn't allow it.<eos> His exact words.<eos> Even after he saw the body?<eos> I watched Sheriff Nix fish it out right in front of him.
Anything.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> Okay, bye.<eos> Whatever happened to my toy chest?<eos> - They lost it.
I'm begging you. At least until the baby's born.<eos> And then... then we can figure out what to do after that.<eos> Where are you going?<eos> To fuckin' pray.<eos> A commitment is something we take so seriously, we vow never to break it.
You want him saddled with that debt?<eos> You know, you barely care if he goes to high school.<eos> He can miss a few days with that brain of his.<eos> If you want that cash so bad, you do it.<eos> But you... you were the one who learned to clean it.
Drink that.<eos> Uh, where's the weapon?<eos> It's safe.<eos> The weapon is safe, man.<eos> I hid it.
It's safe.<eos> The weapon is safe, man.<eos> I hid it.<eos> No one's gonna find that.<eos> - I need it. - Why?
- All right.<eos> So, you'll be back in half an hour.<eos> Here, do me a favor.<eos> - I want your phone number. - Why?<eos> - Just write it down.
I think we should wait until he gets here.<eos> That's what we gotta come up with so you can tell a convincing story.<eos> Forensics are top-notch these days.<eos> You know? It could be almost anybody.<eos> Used to be you had to have a story that made sense. Now, we plant the DNA, they send it to the labs.
I'm not stopping until we have a solution that saves everyone.<eos> If I'm on that list, you're on that list.<eos> Write it down, or I will.<eos> Bellamy, I can't.<eos> Now we put it away and hope we never have to use it.
Luna, Nyko, time to move.<eos> I said, let's go.<eos> What's wrong?<eos> A.L.I.E.'s rules... no frikdreina past this line.<eos> I've never crossed it.
Of course Clarke and Bellamy should be included.<eos> Strong leadership is essential for survival.<eos> All right.<eos> You don't like the list.<eos> Consider it shredded.
Looks empty.<eos> Someone want to make a run for it?<eos> Whatever killed him could still be in there?<eos> The electronics store has a drone with a camera.<eos> Dad and I looked at it last time we were there.
Yes, it's a thing that can happen.<eos> What's this got to do with me?<eos> Sam... we have hard evidence that someone broke into Pastiche's Facebook account and sent out an invite for the blackface party.<eos> Shit.<eos> My editor wants to run with the story as soon as possible, but... if someone else breaks it before we do...
Before this party... a POC on this campus couldn't even think the word "racism" without being accused of crying wolf.<eos> But just like it took a Sandra Bland, a Trayvon Martin, and a Philando Castile to wake some folks up, this party is what it took to wake this campus up.<eos> Look.<eos> I sent the invite.<eos> I wrote it.

Father, raise that holy thing. I'll kiss it.<eos> What are you saying, Cumali?<eos> Father, raise that holy thing.<eos> I'll kiss it. Are you crazy, man?<eos> Raise your holy hand. I'll kiss it, father.
Grapes?<eos> Oh, wait.<eos> Is it Manure?<eos> I bet you love coming here and fucking with mortals 'cause back home in god-land, you barely rank.<eos> Watch your mouth, or I'll slice out your tongue, and I'll eat it in front of you.
Duck!<eos> - Shit...<eos> - What the hell?<eos> The chain was the only thing keeping my hand from fucking...<eos> - Put it back on.
Sam White did it.<eos> Why would she do that?<eos> No one would have found out about what they were planning if she hadn't.<eos> This party wouldn't have happened at all if she hadn't thrown it.<eos> She didn't throw it. She exposed it.
This party wouldn't have happened at all if she hadn't thrown it.<eos> She didn't throw it. She exposed it.<eos> And if we print this, people will completely dismiss what she's been trying to say.<eos> We can't control what people do with the truth, Lionel.<eos> We can only report it.
[Gabe] Don't worry. I'm gonna delete the post.<eos> [Lionel] Sam?<eos> [Sam] Shit.<eos> My editor wants to run with the story as soon as possible.<eos> But... if someone else breaks it before we do... you know?
I'm not like that. Nah.<eos> Anybody can see that.<eos> - Want to listen to some music?<eos> [Sam] Look. I sent the invite.<eos> - [Sam] I wrote it.

And obviously a machine like this cannot possibly be converted into a sports car.<eos> Or can it?<eos> First of all, we have to remove this rather ungainly body.<eos> You can't do that with a modern car because the body is the chassis. It's the skeleton.<eos> If you take it away, you're left with nothing more than a collection of unjoined-up parts.
One sec!<eos> Did you already try the purple one?<eos> I don't do purple!<eos> I hate the jacket.<eos> I love it.
I'm just thinking about how it's changed everything.<eos> Well, I thought you said all this was beautiful.<eos> Oh, it is.<eos> So is a volcanic eruption or a tsunami.<eos> Few things are more beautiful than destruction, but doesn't mean I enjoy it.
Do you know why, Gregory?<eos> Hurry up!<eos> - Is the door locked?<eos> - Come in.<eos> Guys, open it up for him.
I love you.<eos> Where are you, Eddie? You're a denier.<eos> You're the son.<eos> What's behind the door?<eos> If you don't open it, you'll never escape it. Johnny?
 And we're getting ready to do this world tour, and she decides that she needs a break and decides that she's gonna go to the beach.<eos> We had these venues booked, these stadiums.<eos> We're talking millions of dollars.<eos>  Fear.<eos> That's what I'm hearing. The key is not to, you know, excise the fear, but you channel it. Use it.
You've never seen the black hat reservation.<eos> It's a truck stop, motel, and market.<eos> Rocks and asphalt, liquor and oxy, drunken, diabetic welfare cheats.<eos> I feel your liberal judgment.<eos> It's palpable.
Abby, are you there?<eos> I'm here.<eos> There may be a solution.<eos> - That's great.<eos> - But to find it, I have to do something that I never thought I'd have to do.
The President has some big ideas for the future, and so do we.<eos> Now, the President made it clear last night and again today that gun control's an important issue to him.<eos> We don't happen to see eye-to-eye on the topic, but in an effort to bring the issue out into the open, as the Chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee,<eos> I will be re-introducing Bill 8180 from the former Congress, which strengthens federal background checks.<eos> Now, I happen to oppose this bill, but in the spirit of bipartisan discussion, I'd like to put it before the Senate for debate.
Oh, my God.<eos> Agent Wells, what do you have for me?<eos> These were found at the home of Brooke Mathison, the woman that Charles Langdon knew as Claudine.<eos> This looks like the Capitol threat assessment file.<eos> It was created by the same strategic group at the Pentagon.
What about Lozano? Did you track the helicopter?<eos> Tail number was blacked out.<eos> And there's no FAA airtraffic control in the area.<eos> It's like he flew into a vacuum.<eos> Did we secure the munitions, at least? Yeah, the task force was on the ground two hours after Hannah called it in.
At this point, Maryland State Police set up a perimeter and wait for the FBI to show up.<eos> And that flash, is that the grenade going off?<eos> Yes.<eos> At first we thought he was shot before he could throw it, but the coroner's report was inconclusive.<eos> He may have detonated it deliberately.
But right now I need your counsel.<eos> What are my options?<eos> You don't have any.<eos> That's the problem.<eos> You can't deny the story without committing perjury, and you can't confirm it without admitting that you still don't know who's behind all this, throwing the whole American country into a panic.
Thank you.<eos> You ready for tonight?<eos> Happy with your speech?<eos> I better be.<eos> I wrote it myself this time.
Have a seat.<eos> I'll only be a second.<eos> You have a lovely home.<eos> Oh, thank you, dear.<eos> "Now, we'll start this band of robbers" "and call it Tom Sawyer's gang.
Wait here.<eos> I'll retrieve Detective Mills.<eos> Yeah?<eos> - Hello. - Hi. I never got your email.<eos> I'm sending it now.
From the beginning.<eos> 'Fraid so, Tom, 'fraid so.<eos> He had a hard year previous to his time with McMillan.<eos> A lot was asked of him, and... maybe he was... struggling to carry some weight, I think.<eos> He carried it a long way alone, really.
So, where's the money now?<eos> I left it in a simple carefree style on the dresser in the ladies' police room.<eos> I like your music.<eos> My friend gave it to me.<eos> She cared little for it.
Oh, you stupid American swine!<eos> You think you're getting away, but I get you by your hair.<eos> I spin you around, and I set you up for "the bread line."<eos> I get you up again for "the potato soup."<eos> Eat it!
And trust and thrift.<eos> Oh, my God. You sound like a Protestant.<eos> Is that a bad thing?<eos> Hey! Hey!<eos> If any of you have any information about the whereabouts of my video camera, or if any of you happened to steal it, bring it the fuck back now.
♪ I wear these glasses on my eyes One day I'll win the Nobel Prize ♪<eos> - ♪ GLOW, GLOW, that's the name ♪ - How did you shoot this?<eos> Oh, on the video camera I found in my locker.<eos> My video camera was in your locker?<eos> Oh, yeah, well, someone put it there, yeah.
History supports me.<eos> Tradition supports me.<eos> I know you will too.<eos> To take the crown from me would be nothing short of stealing.<eos> 'You stole it, didn't you?
- I understand.<eos> - I don't think you do.<eos> You're fired.<eos> Place your gun on the table and I'll escort you off the premises.<eos> Put it on the table!
I wish I knew.<eos> There's nothing to worry about.<eos> Your brother is smiling.<eos> He would never operate a machine without reading the manual first.<eos> He's operating it perfectly.
- They're not mutually...<eos> - We're on a school trip.<eos> Right, because we're schoolchildren.<eos> Well, this lumbermill is hardly a safe place for children.<eos> And I should know, I run it. I'm Charles.
I'm the boss.<eos> Now, where was I?<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> There's a reason this town will never forget your parents.<eos> They're the ones that burned it down.
You best come along. Uh - ahem<eos> - I'll take your bag. Oh, I can carry it.<eos> It isn't heavy.<eos> I've got all my worldly goods in it, but it isn't heavy.<eos> And if it isn't carried a certain way, it falls right open, so I better keep it.
Where is my brooch?<eos> - It should be there on your shawl.<eos> - It is not.<eos> Nor is it in my jewellery box.<eos> Did you take it?
- It is not.<eos> Nor is it in my jewellery box.<eos> Did you take it?<eos> I was playing with it, but I didn't take it.<eos> - You were told not to touch it. - I'm sorry.
It's just it's so beautiful, I couldn't resist.<eos> You were told to set the shawl on the chair.<eos> I did.<eos> I've looked everywhere and the brooch is nowhere to be found.<eos> Give it back. Right now.
You were told to set the shawl on the chair.<eos> I did.<eos> I've looked everywhere and the brooch is nowhere to be found.<eos> Give it back. Right now.<eos> But I didn't take it, Miss Cuthbert. Honest, I didn't.
If I don't confess... you'll send me back?<eos> Confess to what you have done.<eos> If I do, can I stay here at Green Gables?<eos> Did you, or did you not, take the brooch?<eos> I lost it. I...
Did you, or did you not, take the brooch?<eos> I lost it. I...<eos> I was... I was playing Lady Cordelia when I took the brooch outside with me.<eos> As I was drawing water from the well, I leaned over to make a wish and it fell in.<eos> I heard it make a splash as it disappeared down into the depths.
Jasper...<eos> You're gonna love it.<eos> Give him a minute.<eos> They'll figure it out when we take the still.<eos> We don't need it.
And if she were here, the clans might actually have obeyed her.<eos> But seeing that there's no commander to rule us... War it is.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> I know you have the flame.<eos> I know Octavia gave it to you.
That gives us 90 minutes to run a 6-hour preflight check, retrieve the oxygen generator from the lighthouse, turn a cockpit designed for two into one that can carry 8, and load the cargo hold with enough food to keep us from starving in space while we wait for the algae to bloom.<eos> I thought you said it was gonna be hard.<eos> That's not the hard part.<eos> Becca designed her rocket to dock with Polaris, not the Ark.<eos> That means I have to pilot it into the hangar bay on the ring.
Roger.<eos> - Is that gear almost packed?<eos> - Almost.<eos> Well, hurry up.<eos> He wants it on the roof in five minutes.
- I'm searching.<eos> Oh, maybe this.<eos> Okay, "Locate current defendant using his..."<eos> Yeah, no, still need the number.<eos> - Okay, I found it! You ready?
And we don't want it to spread past what it already has.<eos> Of course we don't, but it's a big surgery, so...<eos> Yeah, I can handle it.<eos> I'm fine.<eos> I want the next surgery as soon as you can do it.
Why aren't you resting?<eos> Oh, I woke up hours ago feeling great.<eos> I'll get that for you.<eos> So, I watched the news, did a little laundry.<eos> Then I noticed that the pantry was a little cluttered, so I reorganized it.
You're going to make my lasagna.<eos> Oh, no, Mom. I-I don't...<eos> I...<eos> That's your thing.<eos> I don't know how to make it.
You know what I mean?<eos> That's what happens when you carry the past around with you.<eos> The past is dead.<eos> You have to let go of it.<eos> Trade it in for the riches of the present, and only then can you be happy.
You know, I don't think Karel was actually telling you to have a yard sale.<eos> I think it was more spiritual.<eos> You know, that it's a bad idea to focus on our past, because it pollutes our present?<eos> - I feel like we focus so much time on trying to fix past problems that we don't, you know, see what's right for us in the moment.<eos> We just gotta cut the past loose because it doesn't exist.
We have everything we need to go home.<eos> Azrael's blade.<eos> You're sure?<eos> I am.<eos> So if we could just get your brother to stop drinking and show us where he hid it...
The point is, despite all of that, she went out of her way to help him.<eos> Yeah, she's right.<eos> The doctor has seen a side to me that I hide because it's, well, terrifying.<eos> But she accepted me nonetheless, and she's helped me through issues that I thought insurmountable.<eos> I appreciate the testimonial, and I will include it into the notes.
Right, Dani?<eos> Of course.<eos> We're just going to delay the announcement of your promotion a couple of weeks.<eos> I see.<eos> You know, Danielle, you have been dangling partner over my head for three years now, always just jerking it out of reach at the last minute.
- It's gonna save me from having to re-insert the needle over and over again.<eos> We've got to drain this fluid off his brain or we're gonna lose him.<eos> If you move that needle even a little, he's as good as dead anyway.<eos> Well aware.<eos> Okay, you put it in.
Hey, is this Liam?<eos> Little Liam with the religious parents? It is.<eos> I saw his name on the board, and I couldn't believe it.<eos> How did you get consent?<eos> I didn't need it.
You're needed in the operating room.<eos> What, you think Wilson and...<eos> and Edwards stood back and waited for a chance to shine?<eos> No.<eos> - They took it.
I looked up, and... suddenly it was as if all of nature had come alive.<eos> Frogs came out of the soil.<eos> Salamanders came out of the lake.<eos> Birds seemed as if they were fleeing.<eos> And then a big toad came up and ate it right off my hand.
Do you have two minutes?<eos> I'm stuck in a church.<eos> Fire away.<eos> I know we have our thing right now.<eos> Can we just put it aside for a second?
He didn't see shit, because I took you upstairs... I took off your shoes... and I put a blanket on you, and I left you there alone to sleep it off.<eos> - Let me touch your hand.<eos> - No.<eos> I want to show you that nothing happens.<eos> I'll touch it and just let it go.
Then we vote on 'em.<eos> If the majority is for, then it's decided.<eos> Okay?<eos> You want to write 'em down?<eos> We ration food, share it equally.
I had never held a guy's hand.<eos> I always wanted to... but you know how people are.<eos> I thought he was gonna kill me, so I promised myself, if I survived, I would do that.<eos> I would hold a guy's hand.<eos> I would hold it... walk down the street, and not give a shit about what anybody thought.
- I guess I am kind of your coworker.<eos> But, nah, they're the worst, man, because we were writing on this TV show.<eos> - Shitty show.<eos> - Shitty show.<eos> We can't name it now because they'll sue us.
Crazy.<eos> - We rest our case.<eos> - We rest it.<eos> - We rest our case.<eos> - We rest it.
You're wearing my jacket?<eos> Yeah!<eos> We're twinsies!<eos> You can't do that!<eos> Well, I asked you where you got it, and you told me.
Never recognizing when they're in the presence... of true power.<eos> Can I get an amen?<eos> Power can be lost, go missing for centuries, then turn up in the unlikeliest of places.<eos> But in the end... power can never remain hidden.<eos> Not to those deserving enough to wield it.
- Sigils? Yeah, demonic symbols...<eos> each sigil will cast a different kind of killing spell.<eos> JENNY:<eos> Sigils are usually recorded in occult texts, they're not branded onto people's skin.<eos> Yeah, because once you access a sigil, it burns itself out.
Its ability to adopt human form.<eos> Not only that, it would disguise itself as someone trusted, someone close to them.<eos> In the case of the Pilgrims, the dead girl Mercy Bradford's father,<eos> Captain William Bradford.<eos> Ultimately, they subdued the creature, buried it in an underground chamber, sealed with an enchanted rock.
On this guy?<eos> Simple gunshot wound. Open and shut.<eos> I spent the rest of the morning analyzing that drug you brought back from the club.<eos> And by "analyzing," you mean?<eos> I broke it down to basic compounds, reverse-engineered it, and then I field-tested quite a few of them.
Brilliant.<eos> Right?<eos> Want to know how I got the idea?<eos> You know what?<eos> You should put it in the script.
If you have good Wi-Fi, it's just like being there.<eos> No, it is not.<eos> He's got a whole thing on this.<eos> Just continue. There's a whole world out there.<eos> Yeah, I've seen it.
So, you were saying there were two men?<eos> One had a gun.<eos> They forced me into the hallway and started yelling, "Where's the money?"<eos> No one even noticed. What money?<eos> They said they gave Adam half a million dollars and they wanted it back.
Check this out.<eos> It's so beautiful.<eos> Here. Hey, Summer, um, so, I have something to tell you.<eos> I just think that your...<eos> All right, so I put a message inside of this for you, and anytime you want to hear it, just put it up to your ear, and you will hear me.
I must be losing my mind.<eos> The reason why Snart and I got on so well was we trusted one another. We were friends.<eos> Have either of you gentlemen heard of the Spear of Destiny?<eos> The spear could alter reality itself.<eos> We broke it into four separate pieces.
Coming through! Coming through!<eos> According to this map, Jesus' blood is somewhere over there.<eos> The spear is sensing the blood.<eos> We won't last five minutes out there.<eos> It's not too late to use it.
What?<eos> Oh, come on.<eos> You're all thinking it.<eos> Absolute power corrupts, Mr. Rory.<eos> Even when used with the best intentions, which is why I'd attempted to destroy it.
"Born of blood, undone by blood."<eos> And what does that mean? - It...<eos> - Look, we finally have the spear.<eos> We just need to figure out what to do with it.<eos> We need to determine a way to protect it.
- Look, we finally have the spear.<eos> We just need to figure out what to do with it.<eos> We need to determine a way to protect it.<eos> You don't.<eos> You destroy it.
Or maybe he already has.<eos> With the entire spear in the Legends' possession, we no longer have to keep going after it piecemeal.<eos> Yeah, I'm a glass half-full kind of guy...<eos> The legendary idiots won't be able to use it.<eos> They'll either try to hide it or destroy it, and when they do, we'll be there, waiting.
Coming through! Coming through!<eos> According to this map, Jesus' blood is somewhere over there.<eos> The spear is sensing the blood.<eos> We won't last five minutes out there.<eos> It's not too late to use it.
I know that the divisions between us run deep, that they may very well be insurmountable.<eos> But I implore both of our armies for this one moment to come together as allies and honor a ceasefire so that the injured may be removed from the field of battle.<eos> There may come a day when our courage fails us, when we forsake our friendships and break the bonds of fellowship, but today is not that day.<eos> And perhaps in showing our humanity...<eos> We might just save it.
We had to restore time.<eos> Although I suppose it doesn't really much matter now that reality itself is threatened.<eos> Maybe not.<eos> Last time I checked, there was not an on/off button on the spear.<eos> What if... what if they don't know how to use it?
Last time I checked, there was not an on/off button on the spear.<eos> What if... what if they don't know how to use it?<eos> I have to say, well done.<eos> I've heard of your skills as a thief before, but this has taken it to a whole new level.<eos> Truly masterful, getting one of them to steal it for us.
Star City is my home.<eos> I will never stop fighting.<eos> Sure you will.<eos> Get rid of that.<eos> But I will take this mask... so I can add it to my collection.
Sara. Why do we always find ourselves in this situation?<eos> 'Cause you keep finding yourself on the wrong side of history.<eos> Nice work, Mick.<eos> Now hand it over.<eos> You already gave it to him once.
We're having a hard time finding this Dr. Rosa.<eos> You still don't remember her last name or where you met her?<eos> I'm trying.<eos> When my officers chased you, you were racing toward the border.<eos> My guess is you planned on crossing it.
Come on!<eos> I want to hear the music!<eos> You're going to get me in trouble.<eos> Everyone knows there are ghosts in the hill.<eos> Wait! You'll hear it in a minute.
Quick!<eos> Douse the fire! Quickly!<eos> Shift your arse, Roman!<eos> Close the trap door.<eos> Block it off! We have to block it off!
Thanks, but no, thanks.<eos> I'm happy the way I am.<eos> I don't believe you.<eos> You're just saying that to hide the real reason that you won't take a chance on love.<eos> You don't think you deserve it.
I can't imagine a life without all that.<eos> So, Tinker Bell was wrong, then.<eos> That isn't your happy ending.<eos> No, it isn't.<eos> But it did give me hope when I needed it most, and that was just as important.
He dresses her up, they elude the bumbling authorities, they fall in love.<eos> I can't imagine why you would discard it.<eos> I would have thought it would be your favorite film.<eos> I don't know about my favorite, but... It ain't exactly The Godfather trilogy, but that DVD definitely was not in my trash.<eos> You broke into my house and put it there.
I don't think so.<eos> What is that?<eos> Okay, the milk here, does Ryan always bring the same kind?<eos> Until a couple days ago, there's a new kind in the fridge.<eos> Okay, did you see who put it there?
- Enger.<eos> - It's Rachel.<eos> Something's come up on my end.<eos> I need to know what you found, Detective.<eos> Ma'am, there's a body here, but, um, we can't ID it just yet.
- Why?<eos> - Let's not ask questions.<eos> - What happened to the pole?<eos> So I am very excited about exploring the burgeoning local Long Island wine scene with you guys.<eos> Some are calling it the new Napa.
- Yes. Max...<eos> That's the show!<eos> It's started. It's out of our hands.<eos> We gotta finish the show.<eos> And people are gonna love it, okay?
Lisa asked me to come. She wanted me to look at this apartment you're in love with.<eos> Lisa and I are friends, too, remember?<eos> I know you're friends.<eos> - Midtown's a weird neighborhood.<eos> - Just wait till you see it, okay?
- Yeah?<eos> I have had dinner with Jonathan Franzen.<eos> - And he turned down Oprah.<eos> - Right.<eos> This woman had Oprah on her yacht, okay, and she was jealous of it.
Given how hard the soil has been due to the cold, to leave an impression like that it would have to be warm and heavy, for a long time.<eos> What's a manhole doing in the middle of the woods?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Perhaps that's why our killer had a crowbar with him.<eos> Cut through the lock here with a blowtorch, and used it to open it.
Do yourself a favor... leave, before I call the cops.<eos> You're denying knowing Raymond Thorpe?<eos> I never heard that name before in my life.<eos> Please.<eos> I'll admit a search of your home yielded no evidence of a link between you and Thorpe, or you might just be good at hiding it.
You know...<eos> So I come back, and my date was like, "Uh, what's up?"<eos> And I was like, "Not much."<eos> Want to get another round?<eos> I'll go get it.
You can't use that shade of black to depict African-American people.<eos> No one else has ever been offended by it.<eos> Have any black people seen it?<eos> Uh, I haven't had any African-American guests.<eos> So I'm the person with the darkest skin tone that's seen it, and I'm the most offended.
‐ I see.<eos> Well, what do you want, Mary?<eos> ‐ You've blossomed into a beautiful woman, an example others look to.<eos> It's true.<eos> I know it's hard for you to look at yourself and see the power in you, but I see it, and you're radiant.
My name isn't Sam.<eos> What are you doing to me?<eos> ‐ Painting flowers on your walls of doom.<eos> Your necklace... where is it?<eos> ‐ Oh, I gave it to the worthy one.
‐ Painting flowers on your walls of doom.<eos> Your necklace... where is it?<eos> ‐ Oh, I gave it to the worthy one.<eos> ‐ I earned the necklace!<eos> I earned it!
Make sure everything's soaked.<eos> - What shall I do?<eos> I'm opening him up.<eos> His kidney has been shot to pieces.<eos> I have to remove it, or he'll die.
Gonna need some collateral.<eos> Well, okay.<eos> Here are the keys to my house.<eos> You can take in the mail and feed the cat.<eos> What do you want me to feed it to?
This.<eos> I want you to come back, work on the ranch.<eos> Dad... we've been through this.<eos> I know you want to run your own ranch.<eos> And if that opportunity comes along, I want you to take it.
Oh, honey, this is gonna look so great out on our porch.<eos> - I can't believe you did this. - [Laughs]<eos> - Wow. - It was nothing.<eos> I made a few calls, - drove half a day... - Uh-huh.<eos> ... had Campari and haggled with a handsy gay landlord, took the swing apart, loaded it in a van, ran out of gas in the desert, got harassed by a shady state trooper, and drove back with a blinding migraine.
- Here you go.<eos> - Busy night, sir.<eos> I assume you have a reservation?<eos> Yes.<eos> My wife made it.
It will need to be a handsome agreement.<eos> Make your offer.<eos> In exchange for peace, in compensation for the loss of Eoferwic, I will offer you a fortress, at Dunholm.<eos> Kjartan is at Dunholm.<eos> Yes. We will join together and we will take it.
Holy cow!<eos> Doesn't look good.<eos> What's happening?<eos> This guy put a toothbrush in his butt. It got stuck.<eos> I have to take it out.
Not really.<eos> Lot of things are ending up where they don't belong today. Ha-ha.<eos> Sorry, Carol.<eos> He will do fine.<eos> I will get it out one way or another.
Dev, you know what?<eos> Looks like I'm not the only one that can do magic here.<eos> Did you just come up with that now?<eos> No, no, I, uh, used to say it to my wife years ago, and then we hit a little rough patch that we're in now.<eos> Now, you signed your card and placed it in this deck, am I right?
So I don't want to host that show.<eos> But... I have an idea.<eos> When I pitched you my travel show, you told me you couldn't do it 'cause I'm too much of a new face.<eos> And I get that. You're right.<eos> But... what if we did it together?
She has one foot out the door. I mean, it's maybe not out the door, but it's near the doorway.<eos> And when we're together, oh, it's great.<eos> It feels so good.<eos> There's an energy.<eos> I felt it after the Chef Jeff dinner. I felt it tonight.
I can't be late.<eos> - Don't get up. You're injured.<eos> - No.<eos> The ferry.<eos> I can't miss it.
I hope so.<eos> It's kind of comforting, isn't it?<eos> And the bank manager, who happens to be my uncle, he said that the Cuthberts are poor.<eos> I've heard it said that snow is a sign of God's forgiveness...<eos> By blanketing the ugly, frozen earth and making it beautiful.
What have I said?<eos> We can't keep Jerry on.<eos> He was getting the last of his wages as part of the sale of the horse.<eos> - But how will you run the farm?<eos> - We're more concerned with saving it. We'll get to that part later.
I don't like these budget cuts any more than you do, but I want you to know I'm in this with you.<eos> I've cut my expenses.<eos> All the execs are flying coach.<eos> But I do want you to feel like you have a voice in this.<eos> So, not only is my office door always open to you, I've actually had it removed.
I've been sick for a long time now, Sarah.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Why didn't you tell us?<eos> Cosima's working on a treatment right now.<eos> She's, she's testing it on herself.
But we were missing this one piece.<eos> We needed a wiper system or something that would keep the glass clean.<eos> When Richard and the team wanted to do underwater time-lapse, they approached us to design something.<eos> So, this one is, uh... a little dirty.<eos> [Rago] We designed a magnetic arm that pulls a windshield wiper around this glass dome and keeps it clean for long periods of time.
[Vevers] I'm zooming in on Hawaii, and you can see here, it's 4.7 degrees hotter than it should be at this time of year.<eos> And you look at some of the other hotspots around the world, it's 11.3 degrees, five degrees hotter,<eos> 8.2 degrees hotter than it normally would be.<eos> There's this big heat wave that's traveling around the planet, and it's killing corals wherever it's going.<eos> This is a small window of opportunity that we've got right now to be able to capture this bleaching event and communicate it in a massive way.
He knows how long the drugs need to disappear from the body.<eos> He is aware and instructs.<eos> He's the most important specialist.<eos> The ARD documentary regarding the Russian whistle-blowers... what did you think, hearing these allegations?<eos> It was inflammatory enough that they were afraid to run it while the whistle-blowers were still in Russia.
The analytical work is done on the A sample.<eos> The way we collect the sample, the trustability of the sample, the fact that we've got an A and a B sample is a very, very, uh, safe system.<eos> The caps on the bottles, they're designed in such a way that they need to be destroyed to be taken off.<eos> In the lab, they have a device that cracks open the A sample.<eos> It's the only way you can get it off.
The Russians and the Chinese are reporting the same.<eos> Reporting what?<eos> What's dormant?<eos> The pyramid.<eos> We are keeping it under observation.
Because they're still offering a deal, and...<eos> And I'm the only one left.<eos> Tell them you're flattered but don't.<eos> What does consent mean?<eos> You must ask for our help, and want it, and know you will then be ours.
I'm totally the President of Earth, and from now on, two planes!<eos> One for me and one for my glamorous assistant, Erica.<eos> Say hello to the folks at home, Erica, and let me through the door.<eos> 'Bill, get the hell out of that pyramid! '<eos> I can't open it.
What's the problem?<eos> 3614... need it to open the door, but I can't see the numbers.<eos> One minute, 20.<eos> I don't understand the problem.<eos> Combination lock... all the sonic will do is calculate the number, I still have to enter it.
This show fucking blows, man!<eos> It seems as though a group of punks have infiltrated our studio.<eos> -So, you don't like my show, huh?<eos> -Yeah. It sucks ass!<eos> -I guess you think it's kind of hokey.
-[telephone rings]<eos> -Hang on. Hello? Wally's Mattress.<eos> You want to return your mattress?<eos> Because of the lifetime guarantee?<eos> [telephone ringing] You ruined it during lovemaking?
I already told you.<eos> Once you're dead, I'll be able to channel your powers and use this sword to open a portal to a realm.<eos> I was helping you.<eos> It's the only way.<eos> The spider... you brought it here.
It's the only way.<eos> The spider... you brought it here.<eos> You knew you couldn't kill me on your own.<eos> Alas, you were far stronger than I anticipated.<eos> And while I created it, controlling it is a different matter.
Those are Lost Boys.<eos> Where are we?<eos> Neverland.<eos> Kill them!<eos> Where's a 40-foot can of Raid when you need it?
I think so.<eos> Ms. Swan... where's Gideon?<eos> Did the beast kill him?<eos> That beast was his pet.<eos> He brought it here to kill me.
The Hancocks are absolutely off-limits.<eos> Why?<eos> This is the Independent.<eos> We can go after whoever we want.<eos> This paper is independent of Winchester because it's paid for by its founders, the Hancocks.
Like some kind of test?<eos> Not for you, but maybe for me.<eos> All right, I'm confused, but you know what fixes that? Scotch.<eos> The past always catches up with us, doesn't it?<eos> Past, present and future is a disaster, no matter how you slice it.
No.<eos> Nobody came to see you and said they wanted access?<eos> And your key card? Where is it now?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I can't find it.
The last thing they expect is for us to come after them.<eos> The hunter becomes the hunted, hmm?<eos> Awesome!<eos> That's the tag line from like six of my favorite movies.<eos> As it happens, I took our list of recent Galra attacks and analyzed it for both commonalities and anomalies among the attack sites.
So, where are the Galra?<eos> [Pidge] The nearest ones are right here. A planet called Taujeer.<eos> Then that's where we're headed.<eos> Everyone should get some sleep.<eos> Tomorrow, we'll find that Galra fleet and take it out.
How do you stop a planet that's coming apart at the seams?<eos> By sewing it back together!<eos> What do you mean?<eos> That new Green Lion weapon causes vegetation to grow, right?<eos> Well, I was thinking that if you aim it at the cracks in the planet... the vines could act like stitches.
Vrepit sa!<eos> [soldiers] Vrepit sa!<eos> Prepare my escape pod.<eos> [Pidge] They're heading for the ark!<eos> [Hunk] They're gonna ram it!
[Kolivan] Can you corroborate your friend's statement?<eos> Does this blade truly belong to him?<eos> [Shiro] I... I don't know.<eos> Shiro, you know me.<eos> I promise you I didn't steal it.
-Move out of the way!<eos> We're leaving!<eos> You're not leaving with that blade.<eos> It does not belong to you.<eos> You failed to awaken it!
I paid, uh...<eos> No, I better not say.<eos> There were...<eos> Some of them were large.<eos> If you, Miss Maclaine, know of any proof about aliens, you can give it to me and I guarantee you I will get it out, but I am skeptical.
Uh, final voter suppression lawsuit was kicked back to the lower court,<eos> - SCOTUS deadlock is feeding the chaos. - Do you read the paper, Sean?<eos> Billy got a byline on that three days ago.<eos> Declaration of war?<eos> Underwood was so evangelical, but hasn't mentioned it in weeks.
I asked Seth Grayson about Lisa Williams.<eos> Why the hell did you think that was an appropriate thing to do?<eos> Didn't I tell you to drop this lead?<eos> Is it still a lead?<eos> Because nobody's on it.
No, I mean on Usher.<eos> The body is remarkably well-preserved, except for the extremities, which frostbite took care of.<eos> But dental is intact.<eos> Our counterparts in Antarctica are cooperating fully, and the body will be in our possession within the next 12 hours.<eos> I'll have it in transit after customs.
We need you to implicate yourself in the death of Zoe Barnes.<eos> Now, before you react, just listen.<eos> You are the most likely candidate at this point.<eos> You were distraught, you were drinking. The...<eos> I don't know. We'll make up some story, and then we'll leak it.
Let the record reflect that the witness has answered in the affirmative.<eos> Mr. President, I want to thank you for appearing... and I hope we get to clear some things up for the American people.<eos> Mr. President, the floor is yours.<eos> You can take as long or as short as you like.<eos> If you have any written statement, we will include it after and it will be part of the record.
- Years and years of investigation.<eos> - I don't care.<eos> You should have talked to me, instead of making a last-minute decision like this.<eos> I didn't.<eos> I created this confusion in order to take advantage of it.
Where is my gun?<eos> Here you go.<eos> What guarantees do I have?<eos> I gave you your gun back.<eos> But what made you give it to him?
Lo and behold... what do we see?<eos> The queen of spades is gone!<eos> Where could she be?<eos> In frank's pocket.<eos> I saw you put it there.
I can wait another 79. No, dad.<eos> You're being too nice.<eos> This is your bachelor party, not yours!<eos> You're ruining this whole night.<eos> You ruined it when you planed it.
- Okay, okay.<eos> It has my passport in it.<eos> Wait, that guy... he has my bag. Excuse me, sir.<eos> Nice try stealing my bag.<eos> I see you've already painted it.
Pam, you are rude.<eos> You are disrespectful.<eos> And you are going in for another bite? !<eos> Put the fork down!<eos> Put it down!
So let's make one thing clear.<eos> You are the one bringing her down, not me.<eos> It's snowing!<eos> I installed a snow machine.<eos> Luckily, Liam didn't cancel it.
They might even get a glimpse of my jingle bells.<eos> Bell.<eos> - What's "moon" mean?<eos> - Robert is not giving my address.<eos> Cyrus! I'll give it.
I don't think that's a good idea.<eos> Why not?<eos> Well, A:<eos> You assaulted Beck on our balcony appearance and B: you've pretty much been an arsehole all day.<eos> Robert is giving it.
'We've all been bruised a bit and we've had our hearts broken.<eos> But we are a nation of fighters, so that's what we do.<eos> We get up, we move on, we fight.'<eos> 'We face the things that are bigger than us with dignity and with courage.<eos> And we ask for help when we need it.' ♪
We think he shot the guy to death.<eos> In a warehouse that they co-own.<eos> Watson texted me from the scene.<eos> Police have been searching for hours, still can't find a murder weapon.<eos> We don't find it, a jury might actually believe the story he's peddling about "some black guy" killing the partner then fleeing.
She was my protégé.<eos> Her departure from my life was only a matter of time.<eos> I'm just saying.<eos> She's a detective now, Watson, so she's one of us.<eos> She needs our help, we give it to her.
How sure are we this is our guy?<eos> Mrs. Durning said that's who she saw when she left the house right before her husband's heart attack.<eos> She also remembered he was carrying a briefcase.<eos> Good bet it contained a hypodermic needle and whatever tools he needed to break into the Durning home.<eos> Local PD are circulating the sketch, but we're gonna take it over to the morgue in Paramus personally, see if anyone there saw this guy make contact with the M.E. who missed the murder.
Or if I should just quit.<eos> I didn't know what to do.<eos> "All right, I'll just try to make it back."<eos> But I knew this might be the last time I would see him, so... it was hard to know how to be... affectionate with a guy I hadn't been affectionate with in 30 years, so...<eos> I just, like, kissed my hand and put it on his forehead and just, like, empathized with a dying man, you know?
A place out of town.<eos> Let me give you a card.<eos> You know what? Don't go to any trouble,<eos> - I'll just lose it.<eos> - No. Take it anyway.
Yes, aren't they delightful?<eos> Yeah. Did you kill all of them?<eos> Taxidermy is the fading art of faded species.<eos> But you see, Darwin never would have gained a spot aboard the Beagle without knowing taxidermy.<eos> He learned it from a freed slave while in medical school at Edinburgh...
This is what we do.<eos> I push too hard and you do things without my consent.<eos> That's our relationship.<eos> Now, we can end it...<eos> Or we can just accept it as it is.
Did I say something wrong?<eos> Was it the-- the dead wife part?<eos> No, it's just, how do you compete with a memory?<eos> Memories are always better than it really was.<eos> Like, when you're a baby, you love breast milk, and then you have it as an adult, and you're like, "What's the big deal?"
That's why we work so well together.<eos> Knock it off.<eos> If I go down, so do you.<eos> Put the gun down.<eos> You're not going to use it anyway.
Vilma's fine, absolutely fine.<eos> Good.<eos> Well...?<eos> I drew a blood sample...<eos> You stole it off a defenceless person.
But why?<eos> I wonder why I'm here. You do?<eos> I guess I have made a name for myself skipping everywhere on campus.<eos> [Leonora] Ooh, and Perry here is the most promising student in my seminar.<eos> I was so impressed by a recent paper of his, I asked him to present it in my intro philosophy class tomorrow.
And I really beefed it.<eos> It's all about doing what you can to maximize the good, right?<eos> Like, if you see someone with no shoes, you should give them yours.<eos> Girl, no one wants your Swedish-ass shoes.<eos> Or, if you had a pizza, you'd give it to people who were starving.
I'm not gonna do that, Xan.<eos> Of course not.<eos> Oh, you bitch.<eos> I know that sharing my story might help some of the millions of people watching right now, but it's still my story.<eos> And I don't have to share it if I don't want to.
I mean, silent?<eos> That's crazy.<eos> What about the music, right?<eos> Well, there is gonna be music.<eos> It will be piped in through wireless headphones.
In Denmark, they call that hygge.<eos> To focus on the moment, on making the ordinary extraordinary, making the normal special.<eos> But what happens when we do that is it makes us much more open to each other and much closer.<eos> And it's a really interesting way of building community.<eos> For example, in the kitchen, we made it warm and inviting with a great old table and we chose the things on the table, so they really felt memorable, tactile.
You get a Hazmat team down here right now.<eos> I think he's been dosed with something toxic.<eos> What?<eos> Is it radiation?<eos> Walker: "The past is never where you think you left it."
Wait, you had work done while I was out? No.<eos> I've been a very fickle decorator.<eos> I have, uh, ordered and then declined a new carpet, crown molding, new bathtub.<eos> You're just in time to pick out some new wallpaper for your bedroom.<eos> You know, since you're gonna return it anyway, just surprise me.
Apparently, she's the perfect storm of provenance, quality and legend.<eos> She's a 1957 Carfax Desperado, a year and make which has already become known the "Stradivarius of electric guitars". They fetch up to a million dollars on the collector's market, and that's without the celebrity pedigree.<eos> If you add to that the fact that apparently it went missing during Mr. Clapton's 1971 tour...<eos> Then you've got a piece of rock history worth killing over.<eos> And we're sure our shooter's the one who took it from Azoff's girlfriend's house?
What kind of maniac is gonna do that?<eos> Hypothetically?<eos> You put us in touch with him, I'm sure the D.A. would be very grateful.<eos> So where's the guitar now?<eos> My guy hasn't been able to find it.
Hypothetically?<eos> You put us in touch with him, I'm sure the D.A. would be very grateful.<eos> So where's the guitar now?<eos> My guy hasn't been able to find it.<eos> Wait, are you saying that he didn't take it from Azoff's house?
How the hell did he get the guitar?<eos> We didn't hear all the audio that he heard.<eos> Wolf's hit man, Vennek, told us that Azoff gave him the location of the guitar before he died.<eos> That wasn't on the audio that we all heard.<eos> So Cosmo must have deleted that part before sending it to the police, then he stole the guitar before Vennek could get to it.
-I could stay like this all night.<eos> That's because you're the boss and you don't have to get up early.<eos> [Alba] Future or past.<eos> We all have to decide at some point in our life which way we want to look.<eos> If you want to cling to the past, to stick with what you already know, or if you want to leave it behind and look toward the future.
-Tonight.<eos> I know it's a bit soon, but I can't wait for him to... [sighs heavily] No matter.<eos> I'll ask Sara to let me go to the bank, and I'll get what I need for the journey.<eos> Do you have Mario's authorization?<eos> Yes, I got it months ago.
-There are other fish in the sea.<eos> -[stutters] Excuse me?<eos> Your relationship was going nowhere.<eos> It had no future.<eos> Pablo wanted to break it off, but he didn't dare do it.
Just when I didn't know what to do, I got a tip.<eos> Someone saw you here.<eos> Is that true?<eos> We had a chance, Alba.<eos> And she ruined it.
I am not satisfied with my performance.<eos> Next up is Rafael Picolo, a surfing champion from São Paolo, Brazil.<eos> - São Paolo in the house!<eos> And he feels that his surfing pedigree will give him an advantage in taking on the Beast.<eos> Regardless of the size of the wave, I tamed it. This is how I see this show.
You're being rude and I'm gonna teach you a lesson.<eos> Now, I don't even want this bag."<eos> "I'm buying this bag because I've got the money to buy this bag.<eos> And not only that.<eos> This bag is for me, and I want you to gift-wrap it."
I walked out of that store with pride.<eos> I walked out of that store with dignity.<eos> And I got into my car and I was like, "Yes!"<eos> And I drove to the closest Bloomingdale's to return that fucking bag.<eos> Because I couldn't afford it, but I taught that bitch a lesson, and that's all that matters!
Most of you might remember, I had a show on TV called Cristela.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I...<eos> - I loved that show and...<eos> - Bring it back!
Let's get this convoy going, soldiers.<eos> Daddy!<eos> Isaac?<eos> Wisconsin, Illinois and Michigan, where the Federal government authorized Reiden Global to quarantine children under 12.<eos> Reiden Global CEO Leanne Ducovny defended the action, comparing it to this country's own history of a military draft as a civic duty.
So I kind of understand all this other stuff, but why the lollipops?<eos> Those are for me. For after.<eos> Let me go get some sedatives.<eos> When I was 14, Jamie overheard me talking to a friend on the phone about having a keg party in the forest.<eos> She offered to host it instead.
It's me, Jackson.<eos> You, your lions and that adorable little girlfriend of yours have been chasing after me.<eos> You have something of mine.<eos> The disc.<eos> Consider it a gift.
Let me tell you now, they have not.<eos> The owner of the pussy may have given you the impression that you defeated the pussy, but it is alive and well, my friends.<eos> Whenever people say that, I go, "Do you understand how impressive the vagina is?<eos> Do you understand how strong it is?"<eos> There's a reason men have sought to oppress it for so long.
Are we still talking about the spoon?<eos> It's nice to see you taking an interest in Amy's work.<eos> Well, don't get me wrong.<eos> Neurobiology's nothing more than the science of gray squishy stuff.<eos> But, you know, when it connects to physics, gas up the Ford, Martha, we're going for a drive.
I can hear your face talking, so we're even.<eos> All right, either blow your nose or teach it to play "Camptown Races."<eos> Fine. Fine.<eos> You want me to blow my nose?<eos> Here, I'll blow it.
He had recently returned to Hollywood after some time in England.<eos> [John Huston] In London, when I was about 25 years old, a whole series of circumstances mounted up to my finally being completely broke.<eos> I could've called to my father for help, or friends.<eos> But I'm enough of a believer in the gambler's creed, that if you're in a bad streak, there's nothing to do about it.<eos> You've just got to play it out.
He had to construct not a documentary account, exactly, but a John Ford account of reality.<eos> The decision about whether to show that film in the form that Ford had made it ultimately went up the chain, until finally President Roosevelt watched the film.<eos> He gave me a little roll of film like that and he said, "Don't look at this and don't put it in the picture until I tell you to."<eos> And, of course, the first thing I did, as soon as I got out of the cutting room, I looked at it immediately.<eos> [Greengrass] He found a shot. We'll never know whether it was a shot that he shot there, or it was a shot that he found somewhere else, but a shot of President Roosevelt's son.
So close, and yet so far.<eos> [laughter] [narrator] Twenty-five documentaries were nominated, and four took home Oscars.<eos> Both Battle of Midway and Prelude to War were winners.<eos> At the ceremony, Mellett gave a speech to reassure the studios that the government would not try to insert propaganda into their movies.<eos> This government is engaged in a war to save and perpetuate democracy, not in a war to destroy it.
Where are you?<eos> The party started an hour ago and I told the kids you were coming.<eos> And it would be very uncool if you didn't show up.<eos> And can you please not wear the wig?<eos> Just leave it at home.
Or do I stay with Abby while Heather's having my kid?<eos> I can't answer that question, Colt.<eos> Fuck!<eos> That's the same thing Siri said.<eos> I can't answer it because you're askin' the wrong question.
As partners.<eos> Partners.<eos> I need a percentage of the gross.<eos> That's impossible.<eos> Mary Pickford got it from Zukor in '16.
Dell tells me you're on take 20.<eos> That is art for art's sake.<eos> Still wearing that watch, I see.<eos> I have to know what time it is, don't I?<eos> Maybe you should give it to my daughter so she'll know not to stay out all night with that German pervert you sold her on.
No wonder you were afraid to rehearse.<eos> Again.<eos> Again, again, again!<eos> Is it so difficult?<eos> You take one peanut... and you put it in your mouth and you chew.
Again.<eos> Again, again, again!<eos> Is it so difficult?<eos> You take one peanut... and you put it in your mouth and you chew.<eos> And then you take another peanut and you put it in your mouth and you chew like a human being.
- Oh, Dick, wonderful seeing you.<eos> Listen, I was hoping to get a moment.<eos> Um, do you happen to know where the bathroom is?<eos> No.<eos> Okay, I'll find it.
That's his arm.<eos> So that wouldn't be his belt. He's holding his arm.<eos> Do you see... They think that if you're looking at it straight on, but it's actually like...<eos> You know, there's an app that you can get.<eos> You just hold it up to the stars, and it will tell you exactly...
Let me do this.<eos> If I'm successful, you'll have more benefits as the boss.<eos> If I fail... I'm going to die anyway.<eos> Rules are rules. And you broke all of them.<eos> I saw the opportunity... and I just took it.
It's a top source of semen.<eos> Or at least what it is for me.<eos> My porn name is Jax Slayher.<eos> It's like I just slayed her.<eos> You know, just... just slayed the pussy, and... just demolished it, and, you know, destroyed it, and...
I start drinking and I...<eos> I don't know why it helps but it does.<eos> You guys are amazing.<eos> Thank you.<eos> [gasps] Um, I've been on my period for two weeks now because I tried to skip it this month.
Maybe there's still a chance between us.<eos> Maybe he wants things to work out." But then... [chuckles] he read it... exactly at 11:11 a.m. and never responded back.<eos> So...<eos> Look, he just retweeted three minutes ago... and 27 seconds ago and a minute ago... three minutes ago, five minutes ago.<eos> When you don't respond back to my text message like that, and I see that you read it, that's gonna make me hurt.
Apparently, they'd been estranged most of Carter's life.<eos> That changed earlier this year.<eos> Carter's CMT was getting worse.<eos> The disease is inherited and the symptoms tend to follow a similar course within families.<eos> Now, no one on his mother's side had it, so Carter reached out to his paternal grandfather to find out what he could expect.
So distant, in fact, that efforts to recreate it with my own arms have fallen decidedly short.<eos> Maybe you need a stronger arm.<eos> Between an adolescence spent at the cricket ground and two decades training in the combat arts, my arm strength is a little above average.<eos> Now, this tropical drupe is filled with a synthetic blood of my own design.<eos> And I'm gonna murder it... with a candlepin bowling ball, which is almost identical in size and weight to the marble award that was used.
All right, then, let's talk about something you definitely don't have:<eos> An alibi for the night of the murders.<eos> That's because you were at Carter's apartment.<eos> He and Fred were telling you things you didn't want to hear, so you took Carter's award down from the shelf, and you killed them with it.<eos> Only a matter of time until we find it.
The sins of the entitled athlete being swept under the rug by his enablers.<eos> I'm sure Mr. Fontino's family will be enjoying the blood money he's earning as soon as Houston Spivey's name is called in the draft.<eos> Well, the lab says the blood in Fontino's trunk was a match for the victims.<eos> And he knew about the murder weapon.<eos> He knew about it, couldn't produce it though, could he?
I'm sure Mr. Fontino's family will be enjoying the blood money he's earning as soon as Houston Spivey's name is called in the draft.<eos> Well, the lab says the blood in Fontino's trunk was a match for the victims.<eos> And he knew about the murder weapon.<eos> He knew about it, couldn't produce it though, could he?<eos> He said he threw it off the Staten Island Ferry.
For what it's worth, Fontino was a college pitcher.<eos> Yes, he was.<eos> That was 45 years ago.<eos> Now he's a retiree with a herniated disc and arthritis in both hands.<eos> I mean, he'd have trouble lifting the murder weapon above his head, let alone swinging it hard enough to send blood flying across the room.
But also because Kennedy's hair was so much better than Nixon's hair.<eos> And, therefore, I went to the cafeteria and as each kid would go through the cafeteria line with their tray, I would tell them, "You know, Nixon has proposed having school on Saturdays."<eos> Well, then the mock election was held, and to the surprise of the local newspaper, Democrat John Kennedy swept this mock election.<eos> For the first time ever, I understood the value of disinformation.<eos> Of course, I've never practiced it since then.
In the movie I walked with a Zombie.<eos> The Zombie Titular. I'm not a Goddamn...<eos> I am Lieutenant Cyril Figgis, LAPD, you sentient shit-sacks!<eos> - I showed you my shield!<eos> - And if you'd show it to me again... I don't...
When he asked you to make up a story about a detective pointing a gun at you, you did.<eos> I think I need to speak with a lawyer.<eos> That's one option.<eos> Or you could realize that we're throwing you a lifeline.<eos> Grab it.
Should I show you? Okay.<eos> You need to drag it towards yourself, not push it away. Okay?<eos> Otherwise you will make a mess and you won't have any control over the carrot.<eos> Pull it towards yourself.<eos> Then you turn it over and do the other side.
One day when he was at work... I just went back home.<eos> What?<eos> Without saying anything?<eos> But you've talked to each other after that?<eos> I've tried writing a mail to him a hundred times, but every time I think about sending it, I think... that perhaps it's better if we just stay apart.
Huge move by Timo Bernhard in the Porsche number 17!<eos> That's Mark Webber's car leading.<eos> It was my plan to take the lead quite early.<eos> The Audi's... I mean they were fighting, the three Audi's are all over.<eos> Once I took the lead I said "Okay that's..." I don't want to give it back!"
Thinking it's time I got a raise.<eos> Easy, tiger.<eos> Mike, seriously,<eos> I thought you were busy with that pro bono. Donna said you needed my help, so...<eos> I gave it to you.
Justice for Catherine Cesnik and Joyce Malecki... Abbie Fitzgerald and I are the administrators on this page.<eos> And the purpose of the page is to collect information from anybody who might have information about what happened to Sister Cathy.<eos> We have journalists, law enforcement, retired police officers.<eos> People know that they can private message us.<eos> If I ask a question tonight on this page, all we have to do is post it and we get so many responses.
"I don't want to," and Maskell encouraging him.<eos> I was sitting across the table from him... and he had a gun.<eos> And he's taking the bullets out one by one.<eos> And he's saying that if my father ever found out that I was whoring around...<eos> And then he took the gun, he put it up to my... my temple, and he pulled the trigger, and he said he will do the same thing, but he'll keep the bullets in.
So, we know she went to Muhly's.<eos> She said was gonna go and buy this engagement present.<eos> When they searched the car, the present was not there and has never been found.<eos> The Christmas after Sister Cesnik disappeared, Ed gave me this necklace as part of a Christmas gift.<eos> And just kind of came up behind me and put it on my neck.
And I thought, why are you giving me a wedding bell when we've already been married for, you know, a year, maybe almost two.<eos> I felt like he didn't buy that for me.<eos> I felt like it was for somebody else and it was given to me.<eos> You know, I, like, just kept it in one place in my jewelry box and never wore it.<eos> And don't know why I kept it.
I felt like it was for somebody else and it was given to me.<eos> You know, I, like, just kept it in one place in my jewelry box and never wore it.<eos> And don't know why I kept it.<eos> I mean... I...<eos> I just forgot about it.
You know, I, like, just kept it in one place in my jewelry box and never wore it.<eos> And don't know why I kept it.<eos> I mean... I...<eos> I just forgot about it.<eos> Debbie's aunt gave us the... The necklace, told us to hold on to it.
I mean, I guess I'm just searching for some answers, you know?<eos> Thanks, Pete.<eos> Bye-bye.<eos> He's 85. The conversation was all over the place, except for when you mentioned Gerry's name, he repeated the whole story again and again.<eos> I do think he's told the story so many times and had to tell it that that story...
The entire mall was checked by investigators from the city at the time in an attempt to locate a store that she may have gone into.<eos> There was no indication they were able to find that she made this purchase.<eos> Now, she could've made a cash purchase and, uh... they just weren't able to locate it, but they never were able to make that determination whether she actually, um, made that purchase.<eos> I saw the necklace yesterday for the first time.<eos> And, um, in looking at it, the bell would symbolize a wedding, which makes sense, 'cause we had just gotten engaged the week before.
So, she thinks there might be some significance to that necklace, and she's wondering whether you might have gotten it from Sister Cathy that night.<eos> Means nothing to me.<eos> Did you encounter Sister Cathy that night?<eos> No.<eos> Now, if people think that that was the necklace that Sister Cathy bought the night she disappeared, and you gave it to your first wife, do you understand why people are suspicious because of that?
This woman, she died to help stop what was going on over there.<eos> And because of the<eos> Justice for Cathy group, because of Cathy's sister, um, having the courage to come into this to ask questions and to kind of find her own peace,<eos> I'm finding another layer of that closure where I can say, "Okay."<eos> You can't bury the truth so deep it doesn't come up.
It's disgraceful.<eos> Hey!<eos> Sheriff, do you really think Rob and I would steal the hats right off our own children's darling little heads?<eos> Besides, you've been trying to get us to sell our property to you since you came to town, you pompous moustache twirler.<eos> Why, I'd rather see the boardwalk destroyed than sell it you.
Mr. Holdout, you could remember the ridiculously long name of a long-dead parrot and every other detail about the pirates.<eos> But when it came to reciting a poem that might lead us to suspect you, you had conveniently forgotten it. You also were surprised to hear Brenda and Tommie had gone missing, but not that the Salty Brick had been stolen.<eos> And when we made a noise in the secret passageway you all looked towards the painting, whereas the police assumed, when we made a noise in their wall, that it must have come from outside.<eos> Wait, you were where now?<eos> You even said to Mr. Monkfish when he was accusing you that you would see the boardwalk destroyed before you sold it to him.
She'll probably fall asleep soon anyway.<eos> It's past her bedtime.<eos> This bag... is gorgeous.<eos> Oh, it's designer.<eos> Daddy got it for me from Paris.
It's past her bedtime.<eos> This bag... is gorgeous.<eos> Oh, it's designer.<eos> Daddy got it for me from Paris.<eos> You can have it if you like.
Thank you.<eos> I know I probably won't make it again, but...<eos> What did we say about positive thinking?<eos> Oh, there's some emergency chocolate somewhere around here.<eos> If you can find it, it's all yours.
- There you go. - Yeah.<eos> We are the Yerba Mate tea bags, steaming the counter top of American pop culture.<eos> But who are we as individuals?<eos> Do you mind if I get into my big story?<eos> See the stage, use it.
Accomplished.<eos> Then perceive a potentially nonexistent slight and go straight to stage seven.<eos> What the hell are you talking about?<eos> Panic, sorrow, self-loathing, hatred, justification, self-loathing again, and rage.<eos> I call it the seven stages of Louis.
But it also means anything they get, they know it came from me.<eos> Except you just told me to go to hell in front of all your buddies, and they saw you meant it.<eos> That's why you came to me at the prison.<eos> Now you got cover.<eos> And I suggest you use it.
Actually, I do mind.<eos> Excuse me, Stephanie, I'm speaking to you.<eos> It doesn't matter what year you are.<eos> I'm head of the associates.<eos> If I give you an assignment, you do it.
This, that, that, that, that and that.<eos> - Katie, does this...<eos> Any new thoughts on what the fall color will be?<eos> I'm still trying to crack it.<eos> It's like I can see it in the corner of my mind's eye, and then I turn and look, and it's gone.
I'll probably do it with the first guy in college with a British accent.<eos> So thanks for that!<eos> You know what else isn't in there?<eos> The penguin necklace you got me.<eos> I lost it, at some point, last Tuesday, and I really, really miss it.
That is super deep, dude.<eos> Okay.<eos> Here's what we're gonna do.<eos> I made Paige feel the way Julia made me feel... which is very bad.<eos> So I'm gonna make it up to her by finding her missing necklace and presenting it to her at the silent dance.
I'll trust you on the math.<eos> Now look over here, DoubleO Penguin.<eos> Oh, honey, look!<eos> How does Zahid have your phone number?<eos> I gave it to him in case of emergencies.
Now look over here, DoubleO Penguin.<eos> Oh, honey, look!<eos> How does Zahid have your phone number?<eos> I gave it to him in case of emergencies.<eos> But he uses it to send me selfies when he's bored.
All right, have a great night.<eos> Okay.<eos> Have fun.<eos> Let's do this.<eos> Okay, Paige lost her necklace sometime on Tuesday, so if I can retrace her steps, I should be able to find it.
Camp Firewood.<eos> I had the chance to destroy it ten years ago, but I didn't, and I've regretted it ever since.<eos> I want you to help me finish some unfinished business, George.<eos> What are you saying, Mr. President?<eos> The truth is, my last year in office, I stole a nuke and I buried it underneath Camp Firewood in a secret bunker that I funded with dark money and I staffed with my own private team of military elites.
We are slip slidin' ever closer to high noon.<eos> Oh, hi, noon!<eos> And with the dance only 510 minutes away, decorations must be made.<eos> So time to gather on the main lawn for a carnival of craft making.<eos> So take a handful of hay and then dip it in the paint, and glue it onto one of these sticks.
I thought your family had vanished.<eos> If vanished is the polite way of saying exiled, hated, and burned out of the ancestral home, then...<eos> Then you know something of magic, and so you know that just because we found a story in our past, it doesn't mean it originated there.<eos> The wisest and cleverest of our magicians know that dying is not absolute, that it is possible to hear stories from the future.<eos> So, you think there's someone that can save the city asleep under it, and you're here to wait for him?
I have to pay one million yen every month, right?<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> It said so on the invitation.<eos> Can you show me that invitation?<eos> I don't have it.
The bland daily life of a woman working at a cafe.<eos> The rambling conversations between her and her bedridden mother.<eos> Even on the final page of the novel, we never learn the names of the characters.<eos> However... what has stayed with each and every one of us that read it is an undeniable emotion.<eos> Though I myself am an author, I can't explain it well.
Okay, here we go.<eos> There, there.<eos> Cat?<eos> Here.<eos> We took it in because we thought it might be yours.
Cat?<eos> Here.<eos> We took it in because we thought it might be yours.<eos> Yes, it's our cat.<eos> Minami must have protected it.
Fresh start.<eos> Hi, Sam.<eos> That's my sweatshirt.<eos> You're wearing my sweatshirt.<eos> When I was locked in your closet, I got cold, so I put it on.
-[Kolivan] Paladins! Can you hear me?<eos> -We hear you, what's up?<eos> We're pinned down by heavy artillery.<eos> We need air support.<eos> [Lance] I see it. I'll take it out.
-I'm gonna miss you, buddy.<eos> Pink, huh?<eos> Not what I was expecting, but I like it.<eos> Yes. On Altea, we wear this color to honor our fallen warriors.<eos> I wear it to honor the paladins of old.
They could counteract our measures.<eos> Who would know our protocols other than the Galra?<eos> Bring up heat detectors and set blasters to fire around the anomaly.<eos> Around it?<eos> I say we hit it!
Sweetie, it was a compliment.<eos> You're adorable under all that bulk.<eos> Bye!<eos> The bar is ten minutes away.<eos> Just pick it up.
You may be the whitest guy everywhere.<eos> I'll get you a drink in five when we open.<eos> I'm not here for a drink. I'm here to pick up a credit card.<eos> The name is Elsa Gardner.<eos> Look, man, this is gonna sound like I'm being a dick, but I can only give it to the cardholder.
Don't.<eos> - I need your permission if I'm gonna jump.<eos> - Just get the hell out of here.<eos> - Not until I get your permission.<eos> - Fine, you got it.
Technique, flair.<eos> Everything but discipline.<eos> As a jumper he was so disrespectful... of the sport that I'm afraid he's gonna do the same thing now as a coach.<eos> No pressure there, then.<eos> Where's my jacket when I need it?
Bathroom time.<eos> This is the common area.<eos> Good for R R.<eos> As you can see, I've planned for a long stay.<eos> The aquaponics system cleans the air and keeps it fresh.
You're a man looking at the world through a keyhole.<eos> You've spent your whole life trying to widen that keyhole...<eos> To see more, to know more.<eos> Now, on hearing that it can be widened... In ways you can't imagine... You reject the possibility.<eos> No, I reject it because I do not believe in fairy tales... About chakras or energy... Or the power of belief.
Not forever?<eos> We're not prophets.<eos> When are you gonna start telling me what we are?<eos> While heroes like the avengers protect the world from physical dangers...<eos> We sorcerers safeguard it against more mystical threats.
For a world beyond time, because time is what enslaves us.<eos> Time is an insult.<eos> Death is an insult.<eos> Doctor... We don't seek to rule this world.<eos> We seek to save it...
"We came upon the ruins of an ancient city bedecked with gold.<eos> Roads... Temples... Ancient symbols...<eos> What? El Dorado?<eos> No, gentlemen!<eos> - I call it "Zed."
That's obviously who I meant.<eos> That's...<eos> Hi, Junior.<eos> If I may, when is the last time the paranormal entity was actually seen?<eos> And if you were to rank it, let's say between probably a T1 and T5...
That's...<eos> Hi, Junior.<eos> If I may, when is the last time the paranormal entity was actually seen?<eos> And if you were to rank it, let's say between probably a T1 and T5...<eos> Garret here saw it on Tuesday, and I believe it made him soil himself.
You guys put all that gooey stuff on the floor.<eos> You opened the basement door. You tried to freak me out.<eos> We did not open the basement door...<eos> Basement door is open.<eos> - I didn't open it. Did you open it?
Till she dislocated her jaw and ecto-projected all over you.<eos> Yeah, that stuff went everywhere, by the way, in every crack.<eos> But, I got to say, even that was kind of spectacularly beautiful.<eos> I did detect a heavy ionization discharge.<eos> I mean, I could smell it.
Just a minor setback.<eos> You know what, guys?<eos> I think we can really do this.<eos> We can become the first scientists to prove the existence of the paranormal.<eos> All we have to do is find an entity and capture it and bring it into a controlled environment.
Oh, no!<eos> Yes!<eos> I wish we still had this presentation.<eos> I mean, it was pretty great.<eos> I kinda wish I could've seen it, man.
I mean, it was pretty great.<eos> I kinda wish I could've seen it, man.<eos> - You might just get your wish, Patty.<eos> - No way.<eos> Wait, you have it?
The beam would shoot back into your body, and each atom will implode.<eos> - What!<eos> - Holtz, open that trap!<eos> Okay.<eos> And I'm gonna open it on three.
If the cat is outta the bag, you can't put it back in!<eos> I put a cat in a bag all the time.<eos> But once the cat is out of the bag, aren't you like, "The cat is out of the bag!"<eos> We just want to shove that damn cat back in the bag.<eos> The cat has been out of the bag before, and yet, people lose interest and put it back in.
People always move on.<eos> Sheriff in New Mexico reports a UFO encounter.<eos> The crew of the SS Ourang Medan dies mysteriously.<eos> The entire town of Langville, Montana, goes missing.<eos> It does?
What story?<eos> Humanity's flight to the stars. The greatest migration in human history.<eos> It's the biggest story there is.<eos> But you won't know any of the people who are reading it.<eos> But they'd be reading it.
It's the biggest story there is.<eos> But you won't know any of the people who are reading it.<eos> But they'd be reading it.<eos> Or they would have been.<eos> I'll never write it now.
What does that mean?<eos> The outer door is jammed.<eos> We've got to open that door and cool the reactor down, or the whole ship is gonna blow.<eos> - How?<eos> - I got to go out there. Open it from the outside.
I'm ready.<eos> Just say when.<eos> Here goes.<eos> The door won't open.<eos> I'll have to bypass it.
No kids.<eos> I don't kill women or children.<eos> I do.<eos> See, I was born with the Devil's gift.<eos> I kept it hidden for most of my life, but... The older I got, the stronger it got.
I don't kill women or children.<eos> I do.<eos> See, I was born with the Devil's gift.<eos> I kept it hidden for most of my life, but... The older I got, the stronger it got.<eos> So I started using it.
Dopinder, I'm starting to think there's a reason I'm in this cab today.<eos> Yeah, sir, you called for it, remember?<eos> No, my slender brown friend.<eos> Love is a beautiful thing.<eos> When you find it, the whole world tastes like Daffodil Daydream.
You're welcome.<eos> Okay, look, I'll just take you back to where you found me, and you can phone home, or whatever.<eos> No, no, no, Max. Listen, you are gonna be generating that tachyon energy for the rest of your life.<eos> And that is all that I eat.<eos> Without it, I would actually starve to death.
He trusted you.<eos> We trusted you.<eos> And you all made a mistake.<eos> You want the power?<eos> Then come and get it.
- Bob, is that my jacket?<eos> - Yes!<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> Dude, where'd you get this from?<eos> Well, I sleep in it most nights, but it's clean now, totally good. Yeah!
Put it back! I was wrong, please, put the mask back on!<eos> It's so gross!<eos> I can't be friends with you if you look like that! Please!<eos> It is so disgusting!<eos> Please, put it back!
I'd prefer that you didn't.<eos> - I'm going to do it.<eos> - Please don't.<eos> Let me go!<eos> Not until you untie my straitjacket and put it on, okay?
She's following the decoy.<eos> Wait, what are you doing?<eos> It doesn't matter.<eos> We're isolated.<eos> I'm gonna turn it back on.
Clay, let me ask you a question.<eos> You think that my management style is... Is too careful?<eos> Do you think that I bunt instead of swing for the fences?<eos> I want to be completely honest with you, Josh. I wasn't paying attention, so I didn't hear your question.<eos> -I can repeat it. -I'd rather you didn't.
You're bleeding.<eos> It's not mine.<eos> How's he doing?<eos> He's out of surgery.<eos> He's got a bullet lodged in his skull, and they can't get it out because of the swelling in the brain which may or may not go down.
That's why we a $186 billion company.<eos> - We worry about those bills.<eos> - I worry about my rig.<eos> My crew lives on it.<eos> You just rent it.
I'd like a room, please.<eos> Sure.<eos> Well, it's a weeknight so you're in luck.<eos> But the only room available is the presidential suite.<eos> We'll take it.
I don't know where they are.<eos> But you know where they were.<eos> You have no idea how long it took me to get here.<eos> The closest loop was in the California desert.<eos> I used it to get to the Tokyo loop.
Let's play a game.<eos> Show me your credit card.<eos> Show me your credit card. Hold it up to me.<eos> It's a game.<eos> Now put it away.
Aguilar was the last person known to have had it in his possession.<eos> We need you to find out where he hid it.<eos> I thought I was here to be cured.<eos> Violence is a disease.<eos> Like cancer. And like cancer, we hope to control it one day.
Wait, Walt Camby's on a plane?<eos> Can you pick up the pace, please?<eos> It's like dealing with my grandmother.<eos> Come on, I'm not having a conversation with you through the goddamn door.<eos> All right, I'll leave it open next time.
No. I don't want to talk to no cops.<eos> Don't think of me as a cop.<eos> Hey, what'd I just say?<eos> Cut the line!<eos> Cut it.
- That's right.<eos> I need a satellite van and an audio package downstairs in two minutes.<eos> Lenny, where are you?<eos> Jim, where's my feed with Lenny?<eos> I need it right now.
You know, forget it. Just shoot him.<eos> Actually, I got a better idea.<eos> Up. UP, UP, UP-<eos> Take the vest off.<eos> Put it on him.
Not a clue.<eos> What were we talking about?<eos> Um, you were about to give me your tag.<eos> Well, I kind of like my tag.<eos> Why do you want it?
The distribution of demon rum.<eos> And that no man should rule another man's life.<eos> If you corner the rum market, you will be a king.<eos> I'll still have to deal with Albert White.<eos> But how will you hold the power once you have it?
- I'm not a terrorist.<eos> - Is this not you?<eos> That is... I put the bag in the trash. But I didn't know there was a bomb in it.<eos> - I'm sorry, man.<eos> - Somebody gave it to you?
- Is this not you?<eos> That is... I put the bag in the trash. But I didn't know there was a bomb in it.<eos> - I'm sorry, man.<eos> - Somebody gave it to you?<eos> - I stole it. - You stole it?
It's what he does for a living.<eos> Hey, I don't need judgement from you.<eos> They're cops, Karen. It's a RAPID team.<eos> They planned the bomb to go off in the Nation Pure offices.<eos> To pin it on a mosque?
Tell me your name.<eos> Tull. Tull.<eos> Love is a lie.<eos> It is a trick played by the cruel on the foolish and the weak.<eos> Cast it from your mind.
What he say?<eos> That's all right.<eos> No. No, I'm not having it.<eos> Aye.<eos> You ought to hold your tongue, mate, before you lose it.
This bridge is wobbling!<eos> - it is obviously wobbling.<eos> - Will you just shut up!<eos> See that?<eos> I've never taken it off.
What?<eos> High speed car chases make me hungry, honey.<eos> Okay, Mr. and Mrs. Jones, if that's who, you know, you really are. I have a couple of questions.<eos> I think this time we kind of deserve the truth.<eos> You're entitled to it.
Do you have one of those kits that they use on you?<eos> Of course. I never leave home without it.<eos> I just got a new one yesterday.<eos> Kind of magical. It's basically the secret to my entire career is this little box.<eos> Almost anyone can use it, but no one knows about it. There's this really special red color.
I happen to be pretty good at launching hot, new designers.<eos> Really?<eos> I don't know. I thought what if you hated them?<eos> What if you thought that I sucked at this?<eos> I wanted to earn your praise, not be entitled to it.
It's not that.<eos> You miss it.<eos> Don't you?<eos> The darkness.<eos> What it brought out in you.
He knows the way.<eos> What about the Sphinx?<eos> Have you forgotten about that?<eos> - Sphinx?<eos> - Set captured it to guard his fire.
- This was your test.<eos> - You didn't test him.<eos> I gave Osiris the crown of Egypt.<eos> And when the time came, he didn't cling to his power.<eos> He gave it away freely.
When you're ready, put the card back in the deck.<eos> Don't try nothing.<eos> Keep your gun on me.<eos> That's very good, Earl.<eos> Now, there's no way I can know what your card is because I didn't see it.
You're with me. Come on, let's go.<eos> Come on.<eos> Three days.<eos> The gun. The gun!<eos> Give it to him.
And they say the nightmares never go away.<eos> Those nightmares, they keep you up often, Mr. Faraday?<eos> You might want to wear some pants if you're fixing to fight.<eos> Bogue will come from the south.<eos> Now, he'll prefer high ground, but we'll try to lure him into town, turn it into a shooting gallery.
And I consider her to be the love of my life.<eos> And she is a no-bullshitter,<eos> Put the gun away, son.<eos> - Her name is Ethel.<eos> - Put it away.
Wrap that leg!<eos> Stop the bleeding.<eos> Find some ammo.<eos> You did good...<eos> We are giants put on this earth to rid it of evil and to keep all that is good!
And so, on the challenge given to Abraham Brant from Jesse Kingston, in the way of a Helena duel, are we now assembled?<eos> Take care of my boy if I fall.<eos> We will.<eos> Gentlemen, come forward.<eos> God made this world, Jesse, and it pains me little to send you from it.
He shall bless thy bread and thy water and He will take sickness away from the midst of thee.<eos> God calls on you to conquer your fear.<eos> Unshackle your faith.<eos> The serpent is the darkness inside your soul.<eos> Your fear excites it.
- Ask them.<eos> Are not you afraid to get on the podium, citizens?<eos> The audience is not an easy crowd.<eos> - I do not know fear, great commander.<eos> We can explain it and give them a couple of slaps.
This is where your story begins.<eos> The day they departed.<eos> You all right?<eos> Despite knowing the journey and where it leads,<eos> I embrace it, and I welcome every moment of it.
Look at this!<eos> Do you like a crown? Yeah.<eos> - Pretty?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Would you like to wear it?
- Pretty?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Would you like to wear it?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Should we put it on you?
We won the battle in Madrid.<eos> We shall win!<eos> Really?<eos> I despise propaganda, pal.<eos> I don't care who's slinging' it.
Look. Look.<eos> This morning's troop movements.<eos> Where did you get that map?<eos> I drew it.<eos> You drew it?
-Here you are.<eos> No, it hasn't come up.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Fold a card.<eos> Perhaps she has it.
How could you sell our shares?<eos> Everything I do is for you, Alice... so you can make a decent start in life.<eos> Five minutes ago I was a sea captain.<eos> A sea captain is no job for a lady.<eos> Time is against you, and you're being careless with it.
Your grandmother died.<eos> I'm giving the ranch to you and your brother.<eos> Remember going out there when you was little?<eos> What am I supposed to do with a ranch?<eos> Anything but sell it.
- Nasty.<eos> - Disgusting.<eos> I'm sorry, guys.<eos> The botfly larva is a multicellular parasite.<eos> It's fairly easily removed, as you saw.
Do you understand?<eos> Stacey?<eos> I'm here.<eos> Do you remember where my gun is? - Yeah.<eos> - I want you to find it and keep it on you at all times.
(BREATHES RAPIDLY)<eos> (GASPS)<eos> (READS) "But how conceive a God supremely good, "Who heaps his favours on the sons he loves, "Yet scatters evil with as large a hand?<eos> "A God came down to lift our stricken race -<eos> "He visited the earth and changed it not."
I have it.<eos> It's not your place.<eos> You know there's a whole world beyond Jerusalem.<eos> Greece, Persia, Egypt.<eos> I just want to experience it.
It's not your place.<eos> You know there's a whole world beyond Jerusalem.<eos> Greece, Persia, Egypt.<eos> I just want to experience it.<eos> I'm tired of reading about it, hearing about it from travelers.
I said, "Bound over, hell!<eos> We can settle this right now."<eos> He kinda fell back when I said that.<eos> And all the cold went out of me.<eos> I reached down, I grabbed that sickle. I threw it as far as I could throw it, and me and him commenced to wrestling.
She loves you.<eos> Hell, nigger, I don't need nobody to tell me my wife loves me.<eos> Cory, go in the house and see if you can find the other saw.<eos> Where's it at?<eos> I said find it.
Hell, nigger, I don't need nobody to tell me my wife loves me.<eos> Cory, go in the house and see if you can find the other saw.<eos> Where's it at?<eos> I said find it.<eos> Look for it till you find it.
That I wanted someone to make me laugh, so I could feel good?<eos> You're not the only one who's got wants and needs.<eos> But I held on to you, Troy.<eos> I took all my feelings, my wants and needs and dreams, and I buried them inside you.<eos> I planted a seed and watched and prayed over it.
Okay.<eos> It's a tag.<eos> Have we got any scissors in the bag?<eos> I don't know, Clark.<eos> Believe it or not, I rarely pack it myself.
But it's expensive, isn't it?<eos> I'm gonna take this business and blow it up and invent a new one.<eos> Let me show you the future.<eos> Private aviation.<eos> What if it could be made even more efficient?
- All right.<eos> What do you need a gun for?<eos> You come to us, and we'll sort it out.<eos> Edward?<eos> I just... I just need it.
No, absolutely not!<eos> I'm self-tanning and my legs are still wet.<eos> I can see your vagina.<eos> Well, congratulations and you're welcome!<eos> You know, I had it rejuvenated in 2010.
Whoa, sweet baby Jesus.<eos> Yeah.<eos> You know, we went to get sushi once and he tried to speak Japanese to the waitress.<eos> I swear, some of the words were Spanish.<eos> But, you know, he's gonna sell it off.
Clara!<eos> Honestly. Why do you always insist on seeing me off if you're going to be late?<eos> So you heard, my mother is dying, again.<eos> I have some good news.<eos> Well, I think it's good news.
Well, I think it's good news.<eos> My story's in this month's issue!<eos> That's the good news?<eos> Why don't you focus on your real job?<eos> Wait till you read it.
But it is absolutely true.<eos> They are placed half an hour into the tube.<eos> The melon, not my cock.<eos> Half an hour, and while at 120 degrees.<eos> At 180 you cook it.
Now what?<eos> I'm here.<eos> Okay, I want you to pick up a can.<eos> I got it.<eos> Now, put it back down.
Put it down, now!<eos> - Alonso, holster your weapon.<eos> They're cops.<eos> - Don't do it, man.<eos> You better drop it!
They're cops.<eos> - Don't do it, man.<eos> You better drop it!<eos> Put your gun away.<eos> Put it down, Castro!
- Don't do it, man.<eos> You better drop it!<eos> Put your gun away.<eos> Put it down, Castro!<eos> Drop it!
The world has always been broken, that's why we need good cops.<eos> Like you.<eos> With all due respect, sir, a good cop... is supposed to serve and protect.<eos> Help the city.<eos> Not tear it apart.
Who are you?<eos> Someone interested in the same man you are.<eos> Is that right?<eos> I believe Mr. Luthor has a photograph that belongs to me.<eos> Did you get it?
I don't think you've ever known a woman like me.<eos> You know, it's true what they say about little boys.<eos> Born with no natural inclination to share.<eos> I didn't steal your drive.<eos> I borrowed it.
You know, it's true what they say about little boys.<eos> Born with no natural inclination to share.<eos> I didn't steal your drive.<eos> I borrowed it.<eos> You'll find it in the glove compartment of your car.
Men are brave.<eos> I bet your parents taught you that you mean something.<eos> That you're here for a reason.<eos> My parents taught me a different lesson dying in the gutter for no reason at all.<eos> They taught me the world only makes sense if you force it to.
You can always tell by the red flower.<eos> They do love their red flower.<eos> The red flower doesn't seem so bad.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Let it loose, and it destroys everything it touches.
The red flower.<eos> I don't have that!<eos> You're a man, aren't you?<eos> That's what makes you a man.<eos> You can summon the red flower... And control it.
That's what makes you a man.<eos> You can summon the red flower... And control it.<eos> They told me not to go near the red flower.<eos> You know why they tell you that?<eos> Because once you have it, you rise to the top of the food chain.
You can fool them, but you can't fool me.<eos> I'm the one who saw your future.<eos> I saw what you'd become.<eos> Come now, use the red flower.<eos> Use it on me like your father did.
Probably in kindergarten.<eos> I was a bit obsessed.<eos> Dante defined our modern conception of hell.<eos> Our vision of it hasn't changed since he defined it 700 years ago.<eos> Botticelli drew it but Dante created hell as we know it.
You seem clearer.<eos> Yeah. I am.<eos> What's your middle name?<eos> - Well, I am. I am.<eos> Zobrist is dead, but if his plague is real then this map, it's a trail he has left so someone can find it.
He's the Dante scholar.<eos> The mask's owner insists on the stanchions to keep people back.<eos> He doesn't even permit staff to open the case without him present.<eos> So the mask is not owned by the museum?<eos> No. A private collector bought it from us and allows us to display it in perpetuity.
- Please sit down.<eos> - I'm going to explain this to you.<eos> - This is not okay.<eos> I do not know where that mask is.<eos> But I will do everything I can to find it and return it to you.
You might tell someone that the lights on the Dante mask should be turned on because I could barely see it.<eos> I know, I'm sorry, sir, the Dante mask is no longer here.<eos> It was stolen.<eos> Really?<eos> I was just looking at it.
Well, I've been meaning to quit smoking anyway.<eos> - Margaret?<eos> - Yes?<eos> Have you got your school uniform for tomorrow?<eos> Yes, Mum. I'm getting it.
A worthy lover should assume one has unanswerable motives for all one does.<eos> Certainly.<eos> Scarcely an hour had gone by when I learned that Reginald was leaving Churchill.<eos> Well, something had to be done.<eos> Condescension was necessary, though I abhor it.
A giant sea creature on land.<eos> Well, no.<eos> Because its body evolved in a water environment, so it wouldn't be able to move with the effects of gravity pulling on it.<eos> Did you want to watch that show?<eos> 'Cause I have it on my DVR.
- Wasn't there supposed to be a truck?<eos> - Where the hell are we?<eos> Come on!<eos> Hey, hey! Wait, did you mis-run the tube?<eos> No, I put it in the truck.
Could we create actual, genuine magic?<eos> And I'm guessing one of you achieved that dream, and it wasn't you?<eos> That is what he would like you to think.<eos> My vision was a perfect blend of elegance and technology.<eos> But Owen wanted it for himself so he humiliated me by exposing my private files to the board of directors and convinced them that I am unstable.
And eyes open, wide awake.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> These people are following me.<eos> You might wanna check their pockets.<eos> Then our time is ticking to infiltrate the lab and get the card to the market, where I'll hand it off to the Eye, so we can all get the hell home.
Do I have all my things?<eos> I feel like I came in with more stuff.<eos> Did I come in with more stuff?<eos> Sir, I think you still have my wallet.<eos> Remember, I, uh, gave it to you when I came in?
I feel like I came in with more stuff.<eos> Did I come in with more stuff?<eos> Sir, I think you still have my wallet.<eos> Remember, I, uh, gave it to you when I came in?<eos> It would be nice to leave with it.
So much fun though, knowing you'd be scurrying away from me at the lab just to bring it to me here.<eos> Did you actually think I'd let you go?<eos> - How did you do that?<eos> - Everyone has their button.<eos> You push it and they go blind.
You know they're playing you, right?<eos> Leading you into a trap?<eos> Yeah, but the threat is real.<eos> This card can hack into any system on the planet, including ours.<eos> They have it, why wouldn't they use it to expose us?
That's two nights in a row then.<eos> That we know of.<eos> Policy says that we can't let him go this long.<eos> I'd like to stay here with him tonight if that's okay.<eos> You signed for the file, you can take it.
- Come here.<eos> Chicks and kids.<eos> I hate this shit!<eos> Drop it!<eos> Drop it!
That's a promise! Think you're quicker than my trigger finger?<eos> Todd, please.<eos> You wanna try me?<eos> Where's the gun?<eos> Here. I got it. I got it.
Take that.<eos> DOREEN".<eos> Everyone, keep moving forward.<eos> Over the wings.<eos> If you have a life vest, put it on!
No, no, no, I don't put my lips on another man's shoulder.<eos> That's very gay.<eos> Do it now. People have been chucked out of grimsby for ordering a vegetarian breakfast.<eos> That pellet was filled with lonomiacaterpillartoxin.<eos> I'll be dead in 90 seconds if you don't suck it out.
Welcome to the School for the Gifted.<eos> Yeah. It doesn't exactly feel like a gift.<eos> It never does, at first.<eos> The first step in understanding one's power... is learning the extent of it.<eos> Only then can we begin the process of teaching you how to control it.
I know the kind of mutants you're looking for.<eos> And I know where to find them.<eos> It's my first time in America.<eos> I'm very excited to see your culture.<eos> Well, you're not gonna see it here.
Sure it is.<eos> One day, she'll be walking home from school or she'll be out on a date or hanging out with her friends.<eos> And you won't be there to protect her.<eos> Okay, so let's try it again.<eos> This time I want you to take the gun and hold it lower on your chest, okay?
Okay, so let's try it again.<eos> This time I want you to take the gun and hold it lower on your chest, okay?<eos> You're holding it a bit too high.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - So grab it.
Open it.<eos> Open it.<eos> Open that one.<eos> I said open up that crate!<eos> Open it.
It is jaundiced, but it will be fine.<eos> Go, yes!<eos> I think I'll call...<eos> Bronwyn!<eos> Friend, we have to save the world while it still exists.
This is crazy.<eos> I'm outta here.<eos> Hello!<eos> We're putting on a show here.<eos> You all should come and see it! You!
Okay then.<eos> Let me give you my card.<eos> - And if you change your mind.<eos> - You don't need to waste your cards.<eos> Please keep it.
- Yeah.<eos> - Nope.<eos> Is that my toothbrush?<eos> What's going on with my Kandahar piece, Ed?<eos> Jerry killed it.
- Nope.<eos> Is that my toothbrush?<eos> What's going on with my Kandahar piece, Ed?<eos> Jerry killed it.<eos> Wait, who killed it?
You wanna find out what...<eos> - Holy shit, dude, dude, he's got a bat!<eos> Yes!<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> - Take the pizza and stick it up your ass! - Oh, my God.
I know what a "blue-dye" is.<eos> Tonight, you will receive a telephone call at exactly 2307.<eos> Repeat the time, Wing Commander.<eos> 2307, sir.<eos> You will take the call and you will write down a message somewhere your wife can read it.
And I'm so sorry.<eos> I am so sorry.<eos> Did you send it?<eos> The message!<eos> Did you send it?
Why did they give Mellizo the hard disk before us?<eos> I don't know, but we've got something.<eos> It's from years ago, at the start of her political career, her first government post after winning the elections.<eos> Valencia in '95, on the verge of an absolute majority.<eos> She needed an abstention to get elected, and she got it.
"So that's what I'll be like when I grow old."<eos> If you grow old.<eos> If I grow old.<eos> I hope I do.<eos> I want to see what the world looks like when she's done conquering it.
Monsters.<eos> We have to stop them.<eos> You can't keep living like this, BFG.<eos> BFG, what did you do with my blanket?<eos> I thought you had it there.
BFG, what did you do with my blanket?<eos> I thought you had it there.<eos> Where is it, in my other...<eos> - In the cape?<eos> - Oh, I think I dropped it in Giant Country.
- Please.<eos> That's enough.<eos> Gather round.<eos> We are going to school you... in the true nature of the Lycan warrior.<eos> For the sake of this lesson, our esteemed guest Selene... will play the role of Death Dealer bravely defending our fortress... and I will take the role of Lycan villain... here to destroy it.
It is a frigid, dreary outpost full of pathetic, peace-loving cowards.<eos> You speak of it as if you have actually been there.<eos> Where do you think I was when Viktor wasted years with Selene?<eos> Prepare yourself.<eos> The journey's long, and I need you to take it alone.
Just as the last one was my generation's.<eos> Believe me, you do not want to live with that burden.<eos> We're gonna start with an aptitude test.<eos> Each of you is gonna build a covert communications network in your home city.<eos> You're gonna deploy it, back up your site, destroy it and restore it again.
I'm just saying maybe instead of overalls, your opportunity is dressed up in green hospital scrubs and lives about 100 feet from your back door.<eos> But it is work, and my big brother does not like it when things don't come easy.<eos> How dare you?<eos> I ought to squirt you in the eye with this lemon.<eos> - Drop it.
My grandfather and I used to come out here and fish.<eos> He left it to me when he passed on.<eos> This is where I come when I want to be alone.<eos> And, uh...<eos> I don't know. I wanted to show it to you.
Question anyone who's done any sort of crime like this in the past.<eos> You know, the usual suspects.<eos> Can I get you the list so you can start investigating?<eos> - Yeah, if you could get us that list...<eos> - Okay, I'll print it out.
What's the matter with you this evening? That watch that you're wearing, there's a photograph inside it.<eos> I glimpsed it once.<eos> I believe it is of Irene Adler.<eos> You didn't glimpse it.<eos> You waited till I had fallen asleep and looked at it.
What is it?<eos> Do you?<eos> Do I what?<eos> How did you get that?<eos> I left it at the crime scene.
Oh! Just leave me alone!<eos> Of course I'm not just gonna leave you alone.<eos> "What's in a name?"<eos> "That which we call a rose by any other name would smell as sweet."<eos> "Speak the speech, I pray you, as I pronounced it to you, trippingly on the tongue, but if you mouth it, as many of your players do, I had as lief the town-crier spoke my lines."
Like he's here.<eos> I'm here, I'm right here, and I'm not going away.<eos> You're a hard one to get rid of, that's for sure.<eos> I'm stubborn, just like my husband.<eos> let's talk about the future, and how we're going to change it.
You're leaving me alone with the undertaker?<eos> You'll be fine.<eos> What's going on here, Mr. Day?<eos> She threw a lit cigarette next to the gas pump I was standing at.<eos> I put it out.
What's going on here, Mr. Day?<eos> She threw a lit cigarette next to the gas pump I was standing at.<eos> I put it out.<eos> Is that how people usually put out cigarettes, on someone's car window?<eos> I know guys put it out in their mouth.
- AC.<eos> Did you say Macy's?<eos> Macy's? Macy's?<eos> - Air conditioning.<eos> Sometimes Conner just gets an idea, and he runs with it, you know, and he's right, like, 99.9% of the time, so you've just got to trust that he knows what he's doing.
- What do you say, sweetie?<eos> - Thank you.<eos> You're welcome.<eos> You're welcome.<eos> Honey, what are you gonna name it?
- Thank you.<eos> You're welcome.<eos> You're welcome.<eos> Honey, what are you gonna name it?<eos> I'm gonna name it Maximus.
We look like terrorists.<eos> No one's gonna believe our story.<eos> I wouldn't believe us.<eos> Fred Johnson just offered us a lifeline.<eos> I say we take it.
This is my daughter, Kiri.<eos> She and, uh...<eos> She and the other children have been diagnosed with what the medics are calling hypoxic brain injury.<eos> It's due to the low-oxygen working environments.<eos> She got it when she came to live here with me.
You're looking at, I don't know, some kind of bio-weapon?<eos> Where'd this recording come from?<eos> Phoebe, that's what I think.<eos> - Phoebe Station.<eos> - I meant where'd you get it?
To a guy like me, that means something.<eos> Bein' in the trenches with people.<eos> Goin' through shit.<eos> So, what do you say, when we get to Eros or wherever it is you're going, we shake hands and forget all this ever happened.<eos> We'll cross that bridge when we get to it.
Come on! Great show.<eos> Oh, yeah!<eos> Hey, did you get my friend request?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I noticed you didn't accept it.
Just because it's kind of a whole thing.<eos> I planned for us to go horseback riding, a sunset picnic with champagne on her favorite bluff where she used to hike to as a kid.<eos> What's a bluff?<eos> It's kind of like a cliff.<eos> You can kind of see it from there.
- 300 men.<eos> They will reach Henry's fortress in three days.<eos> We can not wait, we must attack.<eos> Otto, we can overrun the lion and his castle.<eos> It is impossible to take it in three days.
In fact, in honor of this, and you guys all being here... it's time to crack open the Macallan.<eos> Neil, not the bottle from the auction.<eos> It's 62 years old.<eos> Exactly.<eos> What a better time than now to break it open.
If the Unsullied march off to reconquer Astapor and Yunkai, who will remain to defend the free people of Meereen?<eos> If we do not fight them, how can we stop them?<eos> We cannot.<eos> The Masters speak only one language.<eos> They spoke it to me for many years. I know it better than my mother tongue.
We have Ed calling from the military hospital...<eos> - How did Richard Crooks get... - Ed, you're on the air.<eos> Mr Crooks, the guys here, we all love that record.<eos> I lost my left leg and half my face at Guadalcanal, but that dame's got me feeling happy to be alive.<eos> Could you play it again?
Things have been going crazy.<eos> It's difficult when you're away.<eos> Yes, I'm very sorry, Kitty.<eos> Tell me this. - How did Richard Crooks get the record?<eos> - She gave it to him.
It's difficult when you're away.<eos> Yes, I'm very sorry, Kitty.<eos> Tell me this. - How did Richard Crooks get the record?<eos> - She gave it to him.<eos> He's been playing it all weekend.
Now drop your weapons!<eos> Trunk, drop it.<eos> On the ground?<eos> Yes, motherfucker, on the ground.<eos> Stitches, drop it.
I want to eat those fleshy arms!<eos> Come on!<eos> What about the life insurance?<eos> This is the second notice.<eos> You gotta... You got to pay it.
- Within you.<eos> - I might have to think about that one.<eos> - Ooh, ooh! - Be here all night.<eos> - All right.<eos> Ooh, ooh! You know, I do have a gun in my cubby and I will use it.
Amahl, what's happening out there?<eos> - It's so bad.<eos> It's not good.<eos> Amahl, can I get my gun?<eos> Sorry, buddy, I think I'm gonna need it.
I'll be downstairs.<eos> I'm gonna have to break up with him before we leave Libya.<eos> How do you leave me on D when the party's right here?<eos> Hey, about this whole Ambo story,<eos> I don't buy it.
I'm not sure that's very wise. We accept your conditions.<eos> Well, then, gentlemen, it's decided.<eos> Mark me...<eos> I shall bring my finest bottle of wine as a gift for Cumberland,<eos> and I shall present it to him when he's my prisoner.
And I hated ye for it.<eos> And with that hate, I wept.<eos> I wept more than I ever have before or since.<eos> The world was never the same again.<eos> You destroyed it.
When I'm ready, I'm ready.<eos> But you'll want a cup of something hot and dark sooner or later...<eos> Mr. Bulletproof.<eos> There you go with the nicknames, Pop.<eos> You said your rebound chick took a shotgun at point-blank range... pointed it under your chin, and pulled the trigger.
That's his son, Earl.<eos> Never knew he had a kid.<eos> Earl's dead.<eos> Scarfe forgot to lock up his gun one night.<eos> Earl found it and accidentally shot himself.
That won't help him.<eos> His temperature's dropping quickly.<eos> That's it.<eos> It's not the pH mixture that's the problem. It's the temperature.<eos> We need to turn it up. All the way up!
But his real son... was Carl Lucas.<eos> But... here's the crazy thing.<eos> Nobody said nothing.<eos> And Carl and I... we grew up best friends, but... there was all this tension.<eos> You could just feel it like a draft coming in from under a door.
I'm focusing on Harlem's Paradise. Using it for a... a power base for community relations.<eos> That's a smart move.<eos> But you've made some dumb ones also.<eos> You should never talk about murder on an open line.<eos> Open it.
It's okay.<eos> I'll see you soon.<eos> You trust me, don't you?<eos> Because I am trusting you with the future of the entire human race.<eos> And I'd like to show you how you're going to save it.
Welcome aboard.<eos> I'm so glad you're joining us.<eos> Hop in, I'll explain.<eos> Tommy, this is Richard, my lead scientist.<eos> The machine will amplify your power and run it through the conduits, allowing you to send anyone who's wearing one of these to the future in an instant.
Not my first murder.<eos> You all right?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Where's the cat?<eos> I've got it.
Where's the cat?<eos> I've got it.<eos> No.<eos> You've got her cat?<eos> You want it?
I've got it.<eos> No.<eos> You've got her cat?<eos> You want it?<eos> I don't want it.
No.<eos> You've got her cat?<eos> You want it?<eos> I don't want it.<eos> Why'd you take it?
What?<eos> I mean, that's his name.<eos> What do you want from me?<eos> I didn't name him. It's a wild coincidence the pharmacy's there?<eos> I didn't put it there.
You take care of your mom and Nana, you hear?<eos> You a child of god.<eos> You got purpose.<eos> It's in you.<eos> The lord put it there, and there ain't nothing nobody can do to take it away.
I'ma whip him good the next time I see him.<eos> Whip him?<eos> Nonsense.<eos> I'm gonna teach him.<eos> If the good lord gave that boy a gift to read, we'd be remiss to let it go to waste.
You've been lied to.<eos> Do you believe in magic, boy?<eos> Of course not.<eos> Well, magic flowed through your father.<eos> And it flows through you too.
Well, magic flowed through your father.<eos> And it flows through you too.<eos> It's in the Shannara blood.<eos> If I had magic inside me, why didn't it help me save my mom?<eos> It could have... if you'd known how to unlock it.
There used to be stories about an Elf who lived in the Vale.<eos> He'd gladly tell you his wild tale of how he single-handedly won the War of the Races with nothing but a magic sword and three humble Elfstones to aid him.<eos> Well, my father taught me not to believe anything<eos> I didn't see with my own eyes. You think just because those pointy-eared bastards tell us that magic's dead, that's the truth?<eos> What makes you think I haven't seen it, hmm?
What happened to the shelves I built there?<eos> Kyle didn't like them, so he took them down.<eos> He didn't like them?<eos> I mean, who doesn't like custom built-in wood shelves?<eos> Jesus. I mean... Half of us build the world, the other half destroy it.
I wanted this to be more of a surprise, but um...<eos> Your bar? The Yo...<eos> Yo...<eos> Yoknapatawpha.<eos> We called it The Yonk.
So look again, see you tomorrow.<eos> Hello, pet.<eos> Enjoy the show?<eos> - Happy?<eos> - You missed it.
They're cute, eh?<eos> They get on so well.<eos> Yes, they almost never argue.<eos> By the way... did you listen to my record?<eos> Sorry, I'll drop it back later.
Know where Mom is?<eos> At the tennis club, a cocktail party...<eos> Right, I forgot.<eos> Fatna, you didn't see an orange folder?<eos> I've mislaid it.
Commercial sector 1, insured.<eos> Prepare 51 for Spartan-7...<eos> Bishop...<eos> It'll be good to see you again in your uniform, Bishop.<eos> Who says I'm going to put it?
Not right now.<eos> We've taken a multi-tiered approach to try and decipher Maki's info, but it's bizarre.<eos> This chemical schematic is quite confusing.<eos> Resembles a mandala.<eos> I've even tried working backwards from the solution and still can't figure it out.
So what are you doing up in the middle of the night?<eos> It's a process.<eos> All right, well, we'll see how your therapy goes, and maybe I'll consider talking to somebody.<eos> Your jacket is so wrinkled. - Quit it!<eos> - You could have ironed it.
Collins noticed that the parking lot camera was malfunctioning.<eos> When he went to check it out, two masked guys with guns were at the door, forced their way in.<eos> Do we know how they disabled the cameras?<eos> Wiring appears intact.<eos> We're taking it back to the crime lab.
Yes.<eos> Yes, there is.<eos> Leave this stuff with me.<eos> I thought you said we'd never find his signature.<eos> No, I said you would never find it.
When did that happen?<eos> The night you hit the Pot Palace.<eos> Wanna explain the gun in your waistband?<eos> I found that.<eos> I didn't want some kid to pick it up.
Not anymore. It's legal in the State of Massachusetts.<eos> If you have a grower's permit.<eos> Do you have yours handy, Charlie?<eos> No, I ... look, I got a friend.<eos> He was gonna get it to me.
- I'll go.<eos> - You know him?<eos> No, but I know his language.<eos> You have an address?<eos> - I'll text it to you.
Kiki will be glad I missed a meal. - I've got something!<eos> - Hang on a second.<eos> Contact.<eos> We've got another device.<eos> Don't move until he's flagged it.
- What is it?<eos> - A lifetime's worth of favors.<eos> What are you gonna do with the bomb?<eos> Protocol is to blow it up on scene, which we'll do once the sergeant's safe.<eos> Well, is there any way to disarm it, you know, so we can keep it for evidence?
I guess, we haven't really talked about it. But I've always wanted kids, I mean...<eos> I guess we both have.<eos> Right, sweetie?<eos> Yes.<eos> "Fill the earth and subdue it."
There just weren't enough people in Arcadia.<eos> Meanwhile, one town over is San Bernardino and we want to relocate, but we got no money for a new stand.<eos> And that's when my brother here comes up with one of his brilliant ideas.<eos> He says, why don't we move the stand we've got.<eos> Put it on a truck. Genius, right.
What's left to work with?<eos> Cersei is the mother of the king.<eos> She has the king's ear and his trust.<eos> And the king has been speaking regularly with the High Sparrow about Queen Margaery and Ser Loras.<eos> The High Sparrow seized power knowing full well we'd bicker amongst ourselves instead of seizing it back.
You do.<eos> I'm done with fighting.<eos> Even if it's to protect yourself?<eos> Violence is a disease.<eos> You don't cure a disease by spreading it to more people.
I'm done with fighting.<eos> Even if it's to protect yourself?<eos> Violence is a disease.<eos> You don't cure a disease by spreading it to more people.<eos> You don't cure it by dying, either.
Right.<eos> Three lords walk into a tavern-- a Stark, a Martell, and a Lannister.<eos> They order ale, but when the barkeep brings them over, each of them finds a fly in his cup.<eos> The Lannister, outraged, shoves the cup aside and demands another.<eos> The Martell plucks the fly out and swallows it whole.
Time for plan "B."<eos> I told you I had a plan.<eos> - I deserve the crown.<eos> - No one deserves the crown.<eos> Then I'll just have to take it.
That is no place for Elves.<eos> We're on an urgent mission on the orders of King Eventine Elessedil.<eos> Then it is an honor to host such esteemed guests.<eos> I'm afraid the passage you seek was destroyed two winters ago.<eos> It collapsed in an avalanche.
I don't know.<eos> I saw ruins.<eos> Like an ancient city.<eos> Man-made, not Elvin.<eos> I didn't recognize it.
If you think I am pushing you, it's because I am trying to prepare you for what is to come.<eos> You must fortify yourself against the Dagda Mor.<eos> You're pushing to see if I snap.<eos> It's not fun... having your mind read, is it?<eos> Your power may be growing, but be careful how you use it. And with whom.
Thank you, Beetle.<eos> To know Kubo has someone to watch over him when I'm gone.<eos> That would be a fine way to end my story.<eos> Your story will never end.<eos> It will be told by him and by the people he shares it with.
- Okay. Forget about that, okay?<eos> Here's what we're gonna do.<eos> You listen to it, all right, Richie?<eos> And then we'll make a record.<eos> I'll promote the shit out of it.
The kitchen.<eos> - The wallpaper is a bit oppressive.<eos> - No, it's cool.<eos> If we get bored, we'll paint it.<eos> - We'll take it.
I'm meeting Bea to study.<eos> - Do you like how it's turning out?<eos> - Yes.<eos> I think I'll do the sitting room tomorrow.<eos> Don't bother, I've got used to the wallpaper and Bea loves it.
When we moved to Madrid and I fell into that depression,<eos> I never told you, but I was suffocated by a tremendous sense of guilt about your father's death and that of the man on the train.<eos> I never talked to you about it.<eos> I wanted you to grow up free from guilt.<eos> But you sensed it.
A.L.I.E.: It's the truth.<eos> You do know she's the one who launched the bombs that ended the world, right?<eos> Wrong.<eos> She didn't end the world.<eos> She saved it.
So was the commander.<eos> What clarke did at mount weather weakened her.<eos> The ice nation is emboldened.<eos> Their queen wants Clarke's power.<eos> If her people believe she has it, she'll break the coalition and start a war.
- You can't stop me.<eos> - I bloody can and I will.<eos> You're too young to have a death on your conscience, Master Bruce.<eos> I know how your parents deserve justice.<eos> I know you're not gonna stop till you find it.
Okay.<eos> My necklace.<eos> The one that you gave me on our first anniversary.<eos> It's on the nightstand.<eos> Would you get it for me, please, dear?
The one that you gave me on our first anniversary.<eos> It's on the nightstand.<eos> Would you get it for me, please, dear?<eos> Go.<eos> I'm strong enough to use it if I need to.
You're home.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Forensics just landed.<eos> The timer on the bomb was activated remotely by phone, which was smart.<eos> Gave him time to plant it in advance and set it off when he wanted.
I didn't do this. Somebody set me up.<eos> blunt force trauma to the head.<eos> Captain, listen to me.<eos> Murder weapon was a crowbar.<eos> We found it under the couch.
Murder weapon was a crowbar.<eos> We found it under the couch.<eos> Your fingerprints were on it.<eos> At Union Station, I used a crowbar to open up the locker.<eos> Somebody must have picked it up.
- Revenge.<eos> - Remorse.<eos> Ah, remorse.<eos> Let's talk about that.<eos> I feel it.
And Kringle told you herself that she was moving south with Dougherty?<eos> Not in person.<eos> She left a note.<eos> Could I take a look at it?<eos> I didn't really think of it as a keepsake.
I have a gun.<eos> That's a good reason.<eos> Please.<eos> Tell me where he is.<eos> Come on, kid... you ain't even pointing it at me!
To do that, I have to go back to Gotham.<eos> You little punks!<eos> Don't you take that bag!<eos> You have any idea who you're stealing from?<eos> Leave it!
I believe you ran Pinewood Farms.<eos> I believe you've restarted the program, and I would like to know...<eos> Why are you really here, Mr. Gordon?<eos> Excuse me?<eos> This whole city has turned its back on you, despite you risking your life to save it over and over again.
Look.<eos> Helzinger?<eos> Can't stand criticism because of an overbearing mother.<eos> Wants love and approval.<eos> Gets mad when he doesn't get it, so I give it.
- Who are you?<eos> - I am Azrael, righteous scourge of sinners, and I have come to kill you, James Gordon.<eos> Put down that weapon!<eos> Put the weapon down!<eos> Put it down right now or I'll shoot!
Close your eyes.<eos> Imagine that I am God.<eos> All-powerful.<eos> I am God, and I absolve you of all of your guilt.<eos> I put that guilt on you, and now... I take it away.
The lab is sealed.<eos> - There must be some way in.<eos> - We have to go!<eos> We have to leave now!<eos> Tell me how to get that bomb and shut it off or I'll batter you to death right here!
Just bought those bagels.<eos> They were fresh. Not so fresh anymore.<eos> Eight hours ago, I talked to you on the phone.<eos> I told you to handle the Zeppelin situation.<eos> Now, not only do you not handle it, but you tell their fucking manager about the deal with the fucking Germans?
Hootie-tootie disco cutie.<eos> Hootie-tootie disco cutie.<eos> My girlie is here.<eos> 'Nick Lock shot the Rasta in the neck. 'The Rasta went flying through the wall and was dead instantly.<eos> 'Nick spun the gun around his finger and pointed it into the future 'till the Rasta came back to life.
It's a tobacco vape, Dad.<eos> Katherine Heigl uses one.<eos> Smoking kills, you guys.<eos> Where is that pipe, Jackie Lynn?<eos> I held it in the air, and a hawk took it.
That's wrong. Those toppings are wrong.<eos> I will agree with you in 20 minutes.<eos> But it doesn't matter, does it?<eos> 'Cause this is New York, where everyone's moral relatives.<eos> Just order a deep-dish ham/clam, and some sicko will make it for you.
$150.<eos> My last name is Gross.<eos> Spelled like "Wow, that was really gross."<eos> LESTER: You get an idea, you can't shake it.<eos> Hum along with it when you're on a train.
LESTER: You get an idea, you can't shake it.<eos> Hum along with it when you're on a train.<eos> You like it for a minute, but then you hate it.<eos> It ain't good enough, but you write it down anyway just to get it out of your head.<eos> Then you pull out your guitar, see if it might stand up.
Honey?<eos> Best Easter wishes happy Easter written and directed by Nicholas McCarthy<eos> you know, there are only a few days in any woman's cycle where she's capable of conceiving.<eos> And you're on, generic high dose progestin?<eos> Do you take it at the same time every day? Mmm-hmm.
(Laughing) Oh, I read in a men's magazine that if you shave your chest, it makes you look thinner and more cut.<eos> Mm-hmm. And I've been playing the field a little bit and taking better care of myself now that I'm single.<eos> Really?<eos> And I've been making popsicle stick crafts and sometimes the popsicle juice drips on my chest and makes me all sticky.<eos> So I shaved it because of that too.
I'm just gonna stay out here for a bit longer.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Could you not do that to my car?<eos> My cat is missing.<eos> Have you seen it?
- Oh, God, I'm sorry.<eos> - Bummer.<eos> It's just kind of, like, bad timing, 'cause I...<eos> I just signed a lease for, like, a year at this really nice apartment, and, yeah, I turned down this role in a Liam Neeson movie because it conflicted with the Witchita schedules.<eos> I'm gonna get it back. I'm gonna get it back.
And yet somehow this found its way into the hands of a British enforcement official called Angela Burr.<eos> Now, here's the problem.<eos> There are only two people in the world who have that list in their possession.<eos> Sandy Langbourne, and me.<eos> So how did Angela Burr get it?
The Palace do tend to get rather edgy about that sort of thing.<eos> They're looking for a new private secretary.<eos> Some rookie's made too many mistakes and they want someone with tact and experience to take over the position.<eos> Tea with the Queen.<eos> Nice work if you can get it.
Listen, I really want to keep this between you and me.<eos> Why don't you start by just telling me the truth?<eos> What did you do with the list?<eos> What list?<eos> Who did you show it to?
She's gonna take that Book, and summon who knows what.<eos> What, like more, more demons?<eos> Yeah, demons, devils, things that go bump in the night.<eos> All right, I'm goin' down there.<eos> Kelly, other girl, you stay here and guard this door, make sure it stays open.
She said...<eos> It's okay to be afraid of the dark, but the real tragedy in life... is when men are afraid of the light.<eos> Get your bag.<eos> - Where are we going?<eos> - Get it now.
- Get back!<eos> Get back! Get back!<eos> Get back!<eos> Drop the ladle! Drop the ladle.<eos> Drop it.
If she had any faults, a lack of loyalty wasn't one of them.<eos> She was loyal.<eos> And careful. All of this feels extremely unlike her.<eos> She seemed most concerned with the new narrative.<eos> She felt strongly that it would be best to delay it.
We're in his land now.<eos> We better be.<eos> Because if not, you're wasting time I don't have.<eos> According to you, Wyatt has the woman I love.<eos> If there was a shortcut to hell itself, bet your ass I'd take it.
You remember.<eos> You two seem to have found yourselves in the same new narrative.<eos> They say in this country... the only people who survive are men of conviction.<eos> Mine is to save Dolores or die trying.<eos> Wyatt's is to claim this earth or raze it to the ground.
Uh, okay, so if you save JFK, then there's no Vietnam?<eos> Johnson was the one who escalated everything in Nam.<eos> If Kennedy had survived, no way does that escalation continue.<eos> Those boys... would've lived.<eos> Al, I get it, but changing the past to make it how you think it should be just seems...
He's educated, charming, rich, belongs to the Dallas Petroleum Club, and in 1962, he becomes Lee's best friend.<eos> We heard there was a couple, moved here from... Russia, and they were having a very bad time, financially, and so I went to see them.<eos> Tell me, Jake, why is this guy hanging out in Lee's shitty apartment?<eos> They're swingers?<eos> Lee had taken the cigarette from her and had put it out on her shoulder.
Listen, I'm willing to accept responsibility.<eos> But if you're not going through insurance then I have maybe 20, 30 bucks on me, that's all.<eos> Okay, now you're lying to me.<eos> I saw your wallet. You got plenty in there.<eos> Take it out.
You're both a little hot under the collar about whether you bumped his car or not.<eos> But there was a scuffle and he got your gun.<eos> My gun?<eos> Your gun from your pocket.<eos> He got it, and that's how his prints got on it.
No, he is not saying that.<eos> Can we hear it from Mr. Ehrmantraut?<eos> The gun wasn't Salamanca's.<eos> That's all I can tell you.<eos> You told us it was. You said Salamanca pulled it and pointed it at you.
I think I can work this one out.<eos> When I can see straight, that is.<eos> What the devil is this?<eos> It's music, ye dolt.<eos> I know music when I see it.
O... one of the rooms was open... and I saw a bottle of perfume there.<eos> I-I-I wanted to bring it to Milady as a gift.<eos> It smelled so nice.<eos> I put it in my pocket.<eos> I kept the bottle, but... but I was too afraid to give it to you after what happened.
- Okay.<eos> - We're on ice tonight at Murphy's, all right?<eos> Why don't you take the rest of the day off, hold the kid's hand for a little bit?<eos> - All right.<eos> - A bullet penetrated the door. Officer Santos kicked it in, and the suspect made an aggressive gesture after--
The stores on Rodeo, Fifth Avenue?<eos> Well, they shuttered the couture division.<eos> The perfumes and sunglasses are keeping everything else afloat.<eos> And you do matter in the world, you know.<eos> As long as it lives and your son thrives, you matter.
But... looking into his eyes as he told the story... we were immediately pulled in.<eos> Okay, from the beginning.<eos> Today is October 11, 1997.<eos> This recording will be my last testament. Maybe.<eos> Um, I want to tell the truth, as much as I know of it.
So how goes it in Cali?<eos> It feels like we've landed in the twilight zone.<eos> Did you find the card?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I got it right here.
Welcome.<eos> How is she doing?<eos> Uh, you know, she's okay.<eos> What's with the music?<eos> Oh, Morgan finds it relaxing.
I'm kidding, you're gonna love her.<eos> Well, she is very persuasive.<eos> He's with Kirkland, that's all that matters.<eos> You went behind my back.<eos> I saw an opportunity, and I took it.
- why'd you mention shellfish?<eos> - He's allergic!<eos> You buttlicks.<eos> That's why he made that big donation to the stupid food allergy charity.<eos> Oughta call it the Weak Bloodlines Foundation.
Maybe it was 20 years ago, but if anything, she's hotter now-- Oww!<eos> How could you even tell if she was still hot?<eos> She was basically just gigantic sunglasses and a big hat!<eos> Trust me, Lana, she's still hot.<eos> Oh, and the joke's on you, because if I have rabies, now you've got it!
So, about the disk...<eos> You want to get back at us.<eos> - You want us to get it back.<eos> - No, Mr. Archer.<eos> I need you to get it back, desperately.
Really!<eos> Does it matter that if we don't get that disk for that snooty has-been, we'll have to shut off the lights?<eos> - How will that help?<eos> - Not to mention, it's kind of our fault the disk was stolen in the first place.<eos> Since we stole it.
And lucky they're not slowly dissolving in a 50-gallon drum!<eos> She trusted me!<eos> Veronica trusted me to protect the disk, and I failed her!<eos> Okay, well, maybe.<eos> But we're gonna get it back, right, with a plan?
Well, we got tricked into blackmailing Veronica Deane, beloved Hollywood icon.<eos> - Yeah, that's definitely a con.<eos> - But then we... Well, I totally kicked ass and got the disk back.<eos> I will begrudge you a pro.<eos> Although I didn't get to give it to her in person.
No, no, no.<eos> No, yeah, I got it.<eos> Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.<eos> Yep.<eos> - Aah! And that even if they did want pizza for the hostages, which they don't, the perps wouldn't eat it 'cause they know we'd put sleeping pills in it.
- It's not so kind to leave.<eos> Okay, look, look, I'm sorry, I just...<eos> I got this chance.<eos> We got this chance.<eos> I wanna share it with you.
I did retrieve some personal items from it, though, that might help us track him down.<eos> Well, that sounds like a good investigative plan.<eos> The first thing we need to do, though... check out of this motel.<eos> Once upon a time, there was a village that was being tormented by a man-eating lizard-dragon.<eos> The local constable did everything to try to kill this creature, but nothing could stop it.
Kara...<eos> I thought all your kind were dead.<eos> I am the last.<eos> Earth is my home now.<eos> And I will not let you take it from me.
The town with the white church.<eos> Listen.<eos> Can't you hear its bell?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, I can hear it now.
I've been on leave for six months.<eos> I didn't get the message. She identify herself?<eos> I only have her first name...<eos> Annette... and I have a phone number.<eos> The thing is, Keisha, I've been over that murder book a hundred times. I could recite it to you verbatim.
Ronnie made a big show of taking Shannon under her wing.<eos> And then things started going missing... little things, girly things, like lipstick, perfume, costume jewelry.<eos> One day Ronnie said she needed her hair clip.<eos> So Shannon said, "I have one in my trailer,"<eos> so they sent a P.A. to get it.
Oh, yeah, and stick that smile up your ass, you fat fuck.<eos> Fuck.<eos> I'll take the gun back to L.A. tomorrow.<eos> How quick can you get it done?<eos> I'll walk it through ballistics myself.
Dirty cops killing a fellow officer.<eos> Are you saying they'd cover this up?<eos> The mayor and his police chief?<eos> They'll do whatever they can to impede this investigation until after the election.<eos> And then they'll make sure it goes away quietly.
They work with Nash.<eos> They killed Tony. Fuck you!<eos> Put down the weapon, nobody gets hurt.<eos> Put it the fuck down!<eos> You want it come take it.
I've already told you about that.<eos> Tell me again.<eos> Refresh me.<eos> I got kicked by a horse.<eos> I've had it ever since.
Which, of course, meant he rose through the ranks, wormed his way up to captain.<eos> Then I heard last year, a detective in Hollywood division threw his ass through a plate glass window, right in the fuckin' watch office.<eos> That really made my day.<eos> We have a major operation going tonight.<eos> I got here early to plan it out.
Lonesome.<eos> But there was one... emotion... we were taught never to display.<eos> Anger.<eos> Because no man... wants a woman who threatens him.<eos> For survival... we learn to suppress it... to bide our time.
And if we possess the means to stop him, and again do nothing, then their blood is on our hands.<eos> As a Time Master of long standing, you seem to forget our responsibility is to protect the timeline, not humanity.<eos> You wish to engage in the very sort of manipulation of time that we are sworn to prevent.<eos> And yet, if we allow humanity to perish at the hands of evil, then what universe are we custodians of?<eos> What if, in trying to save the world from Savage, you make it vulnerable to another, more terrible despot?
What if, in trying to save the world from Savage, you make it vulnerable to another, more terrible despot?<eos> We are not warriors, Captain Hunter.<eos> We possess no army.<eos> And I'm not asking for one.<eos> Just a single timeship and your permission to change history before Vandal Savage puts an end to it.
Uh, too late to turn back now.<eos> Huh, someone removed the central processing unit.<eos> Are you sure?<eos> I designed the computer's CPU, so, yeah, pretty sure.<eos> Well, HIVE would only remove it if they knew...
Nothing.<eos> All the money, all the buildings, all the inventions, the world didn't care.<eos> My life, ultimately, didn't matter.<eos> Rip is giving me the chance to help save the world.<eos> I have to take it.
Do you have any idea what an extraordinary opportunity we've been given?<eos> A chance to get murdered by an immortal psychopath.<eos> No thanks.<eos> Look, I'm a 20-year-old auto mechanic.<eos> The world is better off without me trying to save it.
No thanks.<eos> Look, I'm a 20-year-old auto mechanic.<eos> The world is better off without me trying to save it.<eos> I don't understand your decision.<eos> But I respect it.
What are you doing?<eos> We've been praying... together.<eos> Praying that God will save our town.<eos> Well, our prayers have been answered.<eos> God will save Alexandria... because God has given us the courage to save it ourselves.
I see that now.<eos> When I was out there... with them... when it was over... when I knew we had this place again... I had this feeling.<eos> It took me a while to remember what it was... because I haven't felt it since before I woke up in that hospital bed.<eos> I want to show you the new world, Carl.<eos> I want to make it a reality for you.
That whole thing at Tulane?<eos> Drove a wedge between us, as a family.<eos> He didn't feel supported, so he left.<eos> I gave him my credit card, though, for emergencies.<eos> But he's never used it.
- What do you want from me?<eos> - Stop asking us.<eos> It's up to you.<eos> - The venom of this particular species is extremely virulent.<eos> Human spinal fluid literally boils when it encounters the poison.
- Try the bedroom.<eos> - Evan?<eos> Mom!<eos> - The door is locked.<eos> - Kick it open.
Yeah.<eos> Miss Dunhill is our new librarian.<eos> Oh, great.<eos> Hi.<eos> I was reading, and I left my bag, and he so thoughtfully returned it to me.
This is your way of life now.<eos> The more you fight back, the harder it will be.<eos> So, if someone knocks on your door you let us in.<eos> We own that door.<eos> You try to stop us and we will knock it down.
I think you should go to the morgue tomorrow and see him for yourself.<eos> It'll give you the answers that you need.<eos> -But tonight... -Oh, God. ...I want you to try to get some sleep, if you can.<eos> Byers' body was found in the water of this quarry by state police earlier this evening.<eos> It was discovered by state trooper David O'Bannon, just after dark.
Attention students, there will be an assembly to honor Will Byers in the gymnasium now.<eos> Do not go to fourth period.<eos> It's locked.<eos> -What?<eos> -Hey, do you think you can open it?
So what?<eos> So what?<eos> You want to go down that road again?<eos> I saw the future. The future of this company.<eos> I fucking heard it.
Shut up, Scott.<eos> Just stop fucking talking.<eos> Hey, I am a junior partner here.<eos> Guys, we started this company, the three of us, from nothing.<eos> - Right, and now we're selling it. - No, we're not.
I can put in the word if you want it. Uh...<eos> Is there s... is there some reason I can't keep doing my job?<eos> No.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> I heard about a position, so I presented it.
Softball.<eos> Underhand. Give me some insight into how you process information.<eos> The press acts like information's a dirty word.<eos> Everyone has access to the information.<eos> We just know how to analyze it better.
Take it in all the way.<eos> Hello?<eos> Hey, I miss you already.<eos> How did you get this number?<eos> You gave it to me.
Turn it off.<eos> David wants to see me.<eos> You wanted to see me?<eos> Shut the door.<eos> I'd rather leave it open.
Now, understand me.<eos> In order for Ed and I to make the changes this city needs, we need a mandate.<eos> And to get that mandate, Ed here needs to win by at least ten points in November.<eos> So, I'm not just asking you to deliver the Bronx.<eos> I'm asking you, Francisco, for you and your people to tear down the competition... wherever you find it.
-I know.<eos> -No, you don't know.<eos> Music is the only reason.<eos> It'll... it'll move you forward and open up doors that everyone says are shut, Shao.<eos> It'll give you the whole fucking world for free if you just love it and hold back nothing.
We know how to scratch it without scratching the record.<eos> I would never let anyone hurt your beautiful record, Mylene.<eos> -You really liked it?<eos> -More than liked it.<eos> I need another copy so I can play it again and again and again.
I would never let anyone hurt your beautiful record, Mylene.<eos> -You really liked it?<eos> -More than liked it.<eos> I need another copy so I can play it again and again and again.<eos> No, you need another copy so you scratch it all over.
-More than liked it.<eos> I need another copy so I can play it again and again and again.<eos> No, you need another copy so you scratch it all over.<eos> That, too.<eos> But I do wanna play it over and over and over.
Thanks.<eos> Yeah, I'm proud of that one, too.<eos> - I'm Mylene Cruz.<eos> - Hey. Leslie Lesgold's listening to our record right now.<eos> Maybe you could listen to it, too.
Yeah, I'm proud of that one, too.<eos> - I'm Mylene Cruz.<eos> - Hey. Leslie Lesgold's listening to our record right now.<eos> Maybe you could listen to it, too.<eos> If she says it's cool, I'll do more than just listen.
-You st- - An ounce of blow.<eos> -I was hurt. Let's not quibble.<eos> Did you, um... -Did you listen to Mylene's record?<eos> -It's a very good record.<eos> My DJs would love it.
Did you, um... -Did you listen to Mylene's record?<eos> -It's a very good record.<eos> My DJs would love it.<eos> -I'm relieved to hear you say that.<eos> -I'm not gonna make it available to them.
- Robert.<eos> - Well, you know what?<eos> There's been a conspiracy of silence surrounding both our marriages for a long time and I'm not gonna be a part of it.<eos> Robert, it was an accident.<eos> I never should've had a gun in the house, especially not where this daffy broad could find it.
They're, like, $12 each.<eos> I thought it would be nice for the kids to have one while we're talking.<eos> Ah, I have a really great idea.<eos> Why don't we make them at home? It'll be fun.<eos> We'll just get some cream out of the refrigerator, whip it up, put it in the freezer, it becomes ice cream.
TULIP:<eos> Let's go!<eos> - The door!<eos> - TULIP:<eos> Leave it!
Strawberry rhubarb.<eos> You will be mine.<eos> Uh, so, um...<eos> I installed this free trial of accounting software on my computer.<eos> And the good news is that I can re-up it every 30 days with a fake email address.
Host that went missing is the woodcutter.<eos> Looks like the rest of them got stuck here waiting for supper.<eos> You guys can't program more than one of these idiots to make a fire?<eos> We could, but thanks to a new policy from your boss, only one of them is authorized to handle the axe.<eos> The rest of them can't even touch it.
Come on, Logan, you know she doesn't belong out here.<eos> You leave now, that no-good outlaw Slim Miller is sure to evade our grasp.<eos> No fucking way.<eos> You were the one who dragged me on this stupid bounty hunt.<eos> The least we're going to do is see it through, okay?
So, my brother took off the leash, and in that instant, the dog spotted a cat.<eos> I imagine it must have looked just like that piece of felt.<eos> He ran.<eos> Never saw a thing as beautiful as that old dog... running.<eos> Until, at last, he finally caught it.
My associates and I are here to relieve you of your ride.<eos> Someone's been telling you boys tales.<eos> Nothing in this wagon worth taking.<eos> The story I heard is one bullet from us, and that nothing blows you all to kingdom come.<eos> Well, then you understand why we cannot surrender it.
So I'll just, uh...<eos> Just back it up here. Ooh.<eos> - This is heavy.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> You mind if we just set it down?
"We are afraid the information given so far is too optimistic." That's where we seem to stand.<eos> When was it agreed, do you know, to allow the terrorists to go... from the building to the helicopters?<eos> What is that?<eos> The guy's pump is fucked.<eos> Can't afford a new one, so I told him I'd fix it for him.
It's a gift, that's it.<eos> It's not funny.<eos> I'm complimenting you.<eos> You got a gift. You're lucky.<eos> Yeah 'cause... You don't really use it with us.
I've lived in the shadow of the noose a long time.<eos> I'm used to it.<eos> But these poor people...<eos> You preach rebellion?<eos> Is it rebellion to fight against unfairness whenever you see it?
Is it rebellion to fight against unfairness whenever you see it?<eos> Or to stand up against an unjust enemy?<eos> Perhaps we are not so very different after all.<eos> Sit back, sit back, sit back, sit back. Sit back.<eos> There is a better world coming, but we might not live to see it.
You're hurt.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Oh, the conceit of the man.<eos> Beaufort must lie awake at night worrying about his own sniveling greed.<eos> Got his nose so high in the air, he should take care no one cuts it off.
We trusted you!<eos> I will make sure that justice is done.<eos> Do you really expect me to believe that?<eos> After everything that's happened to my friends? My own father?<eos> Take this burden upon yourself and it will never lift.
Koen.<eos> Uncle Jimmy, what are you doing here?<eos> What do you got in the bag?<eos> Something dead in there?<eos> Take it.
Go on.<eos> Your father would want you to have this.<eos> Hey, it's not a toy.<eos> Sure, Jimmy, whatever.<eos> Give it to my big brother.
I just put my clinic on the line for you.<eos> It's under control.<eos> - They murdered a man. - They didn't.<eos> Well, that's not what the authorities are saying, and they're going to come after them.<eos> And who's going to look after all these people in the Zone if they shut it down?
Yeah.<eos> We're further along than we thought we were.<eos> We need to accelerate things. What do you want me to do?<eos> Pick up the item... now.<eos> We need it for the next stage.
He wants what you want.<eos> There are international consortia lining up to redevelop the Zone.<eos> Matthews has been working behind the scenes to make this happen.<eos> Cleaning out the Zone is the first step.<eos> Yeah, cleaning it out of people.
If there is something important, call uncle.<eos> Their mother never reached the factory that evening.<eos> In the bicycle basement, she got ill and crawled back to the apartment again.<eos> The disease had come over her.<eos> Their uncle said, it was called cancer.
Hey, now.<eos> Hey. Aren't you driving down to LA with your stuff?<eos> Isn't Becky waiting for you down there?<eos> Yeah, she is but I forgot my lucky guitar, Priscilla.<eos> I left it here so I wouldn't forget it, but forgot.
Don't I get any silly string?<eos> Not what I meant.<eos> You ain't getting away!<eos> D.J. and I were fighting over the closet pole.<eos> I let go and she rams it right through our dad's bedroom wall.
- Wow.<eos> - That's awesome.<eos> - Cool.<eos> Nice cow, Mom.<eos> Where'd you get it?
- OK, are you sure?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Can you, uh...?<eos> Can you make sure that Darren is recording the show tonight?<eos> I'll want it for my reels.
May I see the text you received?<eos> I assume it's not as incomplete and deleted as you claimed yesterday.<eos> JPEL TARGET SHARIF ZAMANI IS IN OSLO.<eos> WASIMA IS IN HIDING AT P-HOTEL.<eos> -So, who sent it?
We need her... to get Abbie back.<eos> My husband let power go to his head.<eos> I won't make the same mistake.<eos> I don't want to destroy this world.<eos> I quite like it.
You know what kind of pension those fools get?<eos> No, this isn't heaven, kid, not by a long shot.<eos> Is it hell?<eos> The pie's too good.<eos> Well, the last time I saw your face, it was on a demon.
Previously on "Billions"...<eos> When did it become a crime to succeed in this country?<eos> Everyone has access to the information.<eos> We just know how to analyze it better.
Sorry, I was short on Kevlar.<eos> Damage to a single bit of the code of the Machine in its presently compressed state would equal terabytes of lost data.<eos> Irretrievable, irreparable.<eos> It's running now on the lithium-ion backup, but if that light starts blinking, we're in big trouble.<eos> Our best hope is to get back to the subway and try to stabilize it.
Our best hope is to get back to the subway and try to stabilize it.<eos> Even then, I'm not sure I can fix the battery, much less decompress the Machine.<eos> It would take vast amounts of processing power, which I don't currently have available.<eos> Don't worry. We'll find Root.<eos> She'll help you get it back up and running.
Then we'll get Shaw back, start working the numbers again.<eos> Mr. Reese, we don't even know if the Machine that comes out will be the same one that went in.<eos> It might be mortally wounded.<eos> You don't know that.<eos> We'll fix it.
Have they lost all their data?<eos> Battery's dead.<eos> It has no power source.<eos> Could be a residual charge in the lithium-ion backup.<eos> If there was, I fried it.
Battery's dead.<eos> It has no power source.<eos> Could be a residual charge in the lithium-ion backup.<eos> If there was, I fried it.<eos> Come on, Finch, there's got to be a way to resuscitate it.
It's a shitty idea.<eos> We know who planted the bomb, yet we can't do anything!<eos> Because we didn't see...<eos> I'm not finished!<eos> Because we only saw it go off, and that's not enough!
The cameras we have on our helmets... It would be nice if you gave back the one you stole.<eos> Did you steal a camera?<eos> This is a bold statement from Hals.<eos> He's a soldier, I'm a journalist.<eos> My job is to reveal the truth so that it can be discussed.
A machine that spies on you every hour of every day.<eos> You granted it the power to see everything. To index, order, and control the lives of ordinary people.<eos> The government considers these people irrelevant.<eos> We don't.<eos> But to it, you are all irrelevant.
Maggie, the wedding photographer.<eos> Yes, we have to get that camera.<eos> Catch Maggie on her dinner break.<eos> Cut the camera strap with... With that.<eos> Bring the camera back here where I'll remove the memory card and clone it onto the laptop's hard drive.

Your sociopath of a son punched a kid in the throat.<eos> The victim didn't report it because he feared reprisal.<eos> That boy has a lacerated trachea and is unable to sing at Nationals.<eos> So, I don't give a crap where the violence comes from and why.<eos> I don't want it in my school.
Okay.<eos> Come on.<eos> Let's go.<eos> There's a door in front of you.<eos> Push it.
Yeah, my... my voice changed after that.<eos> Became something else.<eos> I don't know.<eos> He just...<eos> He never got to hear it.
He could do no wrong.<eos> - Moms can be that way with sons.<eos> You know, he was my twin.<eos> And it's true what they say, there's a connection.<eos> I, uh, I broke it.
Since we're being open... can I share something unusual with you?<eos> -Please.<eos> -Come.<eos> The cold chamber, on the far wall.<eos> Open it.
I didn't think you saw anyone.<eos> I don't look in the beginning, but at the end, I take in the crowd.<eos> It's like sleeping with a stranger and then asking their name on the way out the door.<eos> To validate the intimacy.<eos> Or to invalidate it.
I know, why do we always try to understand?<eos> The future is dark.<eos> Not dark, like, bad.<eos> Just dark.<eos> You can't see it.
It will be very hard.<eos> It will be very... painful.<eos> But you must stay alive to give this to them."<eos> And a white moth flew from her mouth into mine.<eos> I swallowed it.
It will be very... painful.<eos> But you must stay alive to give this to them."<eos> And a white moth flew from her mouth into mine.<eos> I swallowed it.<eos> I have held it inside me, waiting for you to come.
Please, come back to the room.<eos> Come back to the room.<eos> I'm busy, Nance.<eos> I'm making a waffle.<eos> Then... I'm going to eat it.
- Pretty sure? - Mm-hmm. - We could take 'em both.<eos> - [scoffs]<eos> That's the first intelligent thing you've said. Meet you there.<eos> - I don't think so.<eos> - You want that hand, I suggest You keep it on a leash. - [chuckles]
Thank you, thank you, thank you.<eos> I... - I can't find the words.<eos> - Give me a call when you do.<eos> - I don't have your number.<eos> - It's in your phone. "Alexandre."
You could find it again.<eos> Find what, man?<eos> Like, that thing of beauty maybe you lost or let go.<eos> It's still out there.<eos> That's the trip. Getting that back or letting it go for good.
You want to help me hit this shit before you kick my motherfucking honky ass?<eos> Some of y'all never been down South too much.<eos> I'm gonna tell you a little story so's you understand what I'm talking about.<eos> Down there we have a plant that grows out in the woods and the fields and it looks something like a turnip green.<eos> Everybody calls it polk salad.
Besides what they have in common?<eos> Look, I'm serious.<eos> I'm worried about Alex.<eos> Look, between you and me, she came to my place last night, and she was in a bad way.<eos> I tried offering her my help, but she wouldn't take it, of course, and now I've been trying to reach her all night and I can't get ahold of her.
You know that.<eos> Forget control.<eos> This is about justice.<eos> Don't lose sight of that.<eos> We can still get it, Simon... together.
He planted the IED on the truck that exploded in the Santa Monica Gateway.<eos> I want you to find him.<eos> - He's Resistance?<eos> - No, he's greedy.<eos> Somebody paid him to plant it.
No.<eos> A dollar barely used to be enough for the jukebox in here.<eos> I could get used to these prices.<eos> I know how they got to Justin and the armory so quickly.<eos> They have this huge database of information, and, more importantly, they have a woman who knows how to manipulate it.
Nothing was certain.<eos> And this shift in our timeline is the proof.<eos> Stopping Jennifer Goines and destroying the virus changed history.<eos> We pushed back the plague.<eos> We delayed it.
Could be extraterrestrial.<eos> Could be extradimensional.<eos> Not of this earth?<eos> Right now, we don't know.<eos> You said you could contain it.
Could be extradimensional.<eos> Not of this earth?<eos> Right now, we don't know.<eos> You said you could contain it.<eos> Mm-hmm. Could you transport it?
I know.<eos> I'm great.<eos> But so is she.<eos> Is there anything we can do to help?<eos> Unless you can improve on my formula or make it permanent, then, no, you can't.
Ana helped me sketch some blueprints for a containment chamber.<eos> It should be a relatively easy construction.<eos> These are the blueprints here.<eos> You'll want to take a look and see what materials we'll need.<eos> I'd like to start building it as soon as possible.
I discovered that while you were unconscious. Don't touch me!<eos> Just answer me this one question. Do you hear it?<eos> Hear what?<eos> As if it's coming from your own thoughts, but it's coming from someplace else.<eos> Do you hear it?
It could eliminate zero matter.<eos> Perhaps it could cure Jason Wilkes.<eos> Or kill Whitney Frost.<eos> Look, you already got me to admit I-I don't know.<eos> Do you think you can build it?
I've always loved fireworks.<eos> Well, just fire, really.<eos> What if this doesn't work?<eos> The rift will open.<eos> Zero matter will pour out, and you and I will absorb it.
Two hours ago, you were using a redacted file to frame me.<eos> If I were helping them, I'd be on my way there.<eos> But I'm here with you.<eos> The rift will open.<eos> Zero matter will pour out, and you and I will absorb it.
Where's my cannon, Chief Thompson?<eos> It's at the SSR...<eos> Undergoing repairs.<eos> I'm here to buy a little more time to finish up.<eos> Vernon insists on having it up and running before we deliver it.
That's all right.<eos> I only plan to use it once.<eos> On what?<eos> Dr. Wilkes has my zero matter.<eos> I'm taking it back.
To his kidney donor.<eos> That was real.<eos> Come on, Frankie!<eos> Oh, no. Stop. I don't even want to go to their wedding.<eos> -Why would I want to perform it?
- He's figured out our plan.<eos> - What plan?<eos> Turning the gamma cannon into a bomb.<eos> When will the bomb go off?<eos> It's on a remote trigger. Thompson will blow it once he's clear.
I'm...<eos> The Zero Matter.<eos> It... it's gone.<eos> - I couldn't hold it anymore.<eos> - It seems you've expelled it.
The answer is right in front of you.<eos> How do the most successful scientists achieve greatness?<eos> Given your history, drinking copious amounts of alcohol and cavorting with loose women.<eos> That's a good guess, but it's wrong.<eos> Nope. They get smarter people to do the research, and then they steal it themselves.
I'm thinking.<eos> How long until the gamma cannon's charged?<eos> 20 more minutes, at least.<eos> It doesn't have enough energy to fire.<eos> Could we detonate it inside the rift?
Peggy, let go!<eos> No, Daniel, hold on!<eos> Hey, he's not supposed to be in there!<eos> Jarvis, what the hell are you doing?<eos> ! Gamma cannon can't fire, but it could be detonated inside the rift, correct? !
- Just... Just...<eos> Uh, okay, let me make a phone call.<eos> Okay.<eos> I need you to surrender your weapon to me.<eos> Just... Just take it.
Uh, okay, let me make a phone call.<eos> Okay.<eos> I need you to surrender your weapon to me.<eos> Just... Just take it.<eos> Take it right now.
Okay.<eos> I need you to surrender your weapon to me.<eos> Just... Just take it.<eos> Take it right now.<eos> - Just take it.
Take your time. And get at me when you want to spit, hah?<eos> Lucy: (Laughing) Ricky: I'm sorry, Luce.<eos> I-I just can't right now.<eos> Well, is it the neck brace?<eos> I can take it off.
You are one hopeless dreamer.<eos> Did you forget you almost died of exhaustion flying across the ocean looking for this other world of yours?<eos> My dear macaw, you must wake up and smell the papaya, for this is the world!<eos> I don't care what you guys say.<eos> There's a bigger world out there and I intend to find it.
Rebuilt.<eos> After the fire.<eos> Yes.<eos> History is full of darkness.<eos> If you would like to leave a note... I'd happily pass it along to Mr. Pembroke.
A tracking beacon from the Ark...<eos> Farm Station. - That's the beacon.<eos> - This belongs to us.<eos> The Ice Nation queen wants Clarke's power.<eos> If her people know she has it, she'll break the coalition and start a war.
You don't give a damn about my people.<eos> I know why you're here.<eos> I made you look weak at Mount Weather, and now the Ice Nation is exploiting that.<eos> Well, if you want the power of Wanheda, kill me.<eos> Take it.
About what?<eos> Raven, come on.<eos> You're not fooling anyone.<eos> I'm not trying to.<eos> If this machine was broken and you knew there was a way to fix it, would you not do it because it might be hard?
You know that if you give me the little finger, I take the whole dish.<eos> - Can I try it?<eos> - Yes, yes.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> You have to keep it that way.
What?<eos> Why?<eos> You shooting a scene with it or something, or...<eos> - No.<eos> - Well... can't I keep wearing it?
All right, I'll do a card trick now, if you guys wanna see a card trick.<eos> Do you mind picking a card?<eos> - Sure.<eos> - Take one.<eos> - Look at it. - Okay. Place it back in the deck anywhere.
This trick uses sleight of mouth.<eos> One card folded in my esophagus, once, twice, three times.<eos> Was that your card?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Was I supposed to memorize it?
Was I supposed to memorize it?<eos> It was the nine of clubs!<eos> That was her card, guys. The nine of clubs.<eos> Trust me, it was the nine of clubs.<eos> He just said to look at it.
Um, gonna drink my water.<eos> I'll be there in a minute.<eos> Let's have fun, okay?<eos> What comes next, Mom?<eos> Take the fork and put it along the pastry, just so.
Uh... you really shouldn't be here. No!<eos> Arya and I are such good friends now.<eos> She is way cooler than that stupid tour.<eos> The studio tour is bullshit.<eos> My uncle went on it and he hated it.
There must be a way to correct this somehow.<eos> Fortunately, Gideon is just showing us a forecast of the future you've all created.<eos> Time is like cement.<eos> It takes time to become permanent.<eos> In this case, until Savage's team have worked out the mystery of your future technology and molded it to their own ends.
You can't let her die.<eos> I don't intend to.<eos> Sharp force injury resulting in rupture of several major blood vessels.<eos> Her pressure is currently 82 over 30 and stable.<eos> I will begin by irrigating the wound and cauterizing it to prevent any further hemorrhaging.
- Yes, yes.<eos> What are you playing at?<eos> - Nothing. Really?<eos> Did you ask me if you could show the place?<eos> I'm getting it valued if we want to sell it.
Don't play dumb, Eddie.<eos> I am talking about<eos> On Wings as Eagles.<eos> What?<eos> Running it tomorrow.
Synced corrected by -robtor-<eos> Everybody shut up.<eos> I've got dibs on the new AV camera today.<eos> Nobody check it out.
Why are you trying to fucking cook turnips? Ricky...<eos> How do you cook turnips, boys? How?<eos> I don't... It doesn't matter how! You cook turnips with heat, Ricky.<eos> There's nobody disagreeing with that, but the expression doesn't involve turnips at all!<eos> Maybe you haven't heard it.
That's one.<eos> Sophie, take out your fake flag.<eos> - Hey, guys, I got the flag.<eos> - Hey, look, she got the flag.<eos> She got it.
- Okay.<eos> You may call the police. Hmm?<eos> Now, if you could be so kind and give me that time capsule.<eos> You want the children's time capsule?<eos> Just give it to him, Hal.
Let's look at your hand, Grandpa.<eos> I used to be a nurse.<eos> That's how I met Ronnie.<eos> What's the prognosis?<eos> You think you can... save it?
They're just trying to help me figure it all out.<eos> Yeah, Shecky, I mean, do you have any files we can look at?<eos> Anything that would help us?<eos> My house got broken into and they stole my laptop and my cell phone.<eos> So you had a formula that actually works on cancer and you lost it.
- Find anything?<eos> - Negative, Kojak, we're still looking.<eos> Hurry the fuck up, Charlie.<eos> We gotta find that formula.<eos> Listen, we're gonna find it, we're gonna give it to these Nazis, and then this nightmare will be over.
Max, I'm sorry.<eos> Listen, I'm just trying to think of a way out of this, all right?<eos> Max? Shit.<eos> You know, he's right about not giving them the formula.<eos> But none of that matters if we don't find it.
I found the formula!<eos> - What?<eos> Are you sure?<eos> - Yes!<eos> I'm looking at it right now!
- What?<eos> Are you sure?<eos> - Yes!<eos> I'm looking at it right now!<eos> Ronald disguised it as an app on his tablet!
We just brought in more medicine.<eos> Gregory wants the best deal possible.<eos> Yeah, well, we want things, too.<eos> We need food.<eos> We came all this way, we're gonna get it.
She's worried about an attack.<eos> When they come for us, we'll end it, the whole thing.<eos> This won't be like before.<eos> We're putting everything in place and these people know what to do now.<eos> The world's ours, and we know how to take it.
We were lucky.<eos> We figured it all out together.<eos> It felt like we did.<eos> After everything, we did.<eos> The world's not what we thought it was.
Erased every single one of the hacked files, including yours.<eos> Adios, gonzo, sayonara!<eos> Okay, so, you're sure Dominic's people cannot find out about me? Positive.<eos> Once I knew it was him, I traced his downloads to his IP address and wiped his hard drive clean.<eos> I mean, not that he's gonna need anything on it anymore anyway. Yeah. Thank you.
Copy that.<eos> We'll stay on Sinclair.<eos> Bellamy's heading towards you now.<eos> Sinclair, what are you up to?<eos> Raven said the solenoid is acting up, so I thought I'd swap it out.
That's what got Monroe killed.<eos> You're crossing a line, Kane.<eos> No.<eos> No.<eos> I crossed it.
I'm a spy, Bryan.<eos> I've been passing information for...<eos> Hey, shut up.<eos> Found the bug.<eos> You put it there?
Let her go.<eos> I'll let her go when you give me what I want.<eos> The technology that Clarke carries, it belongs to me.<eos> No way.<eos> Clarke, just give it to her.
In fact, it's all rather boring here.<eos> As ever, with love, Vanessa.<eos> She has told her story.<eos> Yes, Master.<eos> Did the doctor believe it?
That should buy a lot of ice.<eos> The map?<eos> Yes, the map of Helena Blavatsky, 19th-century Russian occultist.<eos> Claimed it allowed her to track demonic presences.<eos> I don't have it.
How can you be so sure?<eos> Because there's no alternative.<eos> Lovely piece.<eos> So where's the map?<eos> Atticus Nevins bought it earlier this year, but after he pulled his Jimmy Hoffa act, every relic hunter, dealer and wannabe came to town, raided his entire collection.
You know what's funny?<eos> I didn't even know I had that map.<eos> But once I heard you were looking for it, I made sure to find it and put it somewhere safe.<eos> So... thanks for the heads-up.<eos> Tell me you got it.
How so?<eos> The Prime Minister recently sent his personal attaché, Yuri Krupin, to this site.<eos> The reason -- to shut down this entire project immediately.<eos> The Prime Minister is against a sanctuary? Yes.<eos> Because his opposition supports it -- namely, the Ministers you see before you.
Now... if we're through?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Just one sec.<eos> About that favor... you wouldn't happen to have the number for the U.S. Attorney's office?<eos> Oh, never mind, I got it.
That's how much she hated you.<eos> But I didn't care, because I saw something.<eos> I saw a future.<eos> Our future.<eos> We had a future until you started destroying it.
And so will I, with or without you.<eos> So no, I will not have this conversation.<eos> I will not indulge you any further.<eos> You have to let this go.<eos> I can be a part of your campaign, or I can end it.
Something you like better.<eos> Do you have that marker I sign things with?<eos> Put your hand up on the wall.<eos> - Sir?<eos> - Put it on the wall.
Very.<eos> I handed over all of my correspondence, just like everyone else.<eos> Doesn't prove anything.<eos> I'm trying to save this campaign.<eos> If I wanted to sabotage it, I'd let the president do it himself, instead of fighting back on this VP thing.
I have some calls to make.<eos> I'll come to your office after.<eos> Get me LeAnn Harvey.<eos> Milkin will be staying with this man, Anton Khalski.<eos> He owned the second-largest bank in Russia until Petrov seized it in 2013.
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!<eos> What're you doing?<eos> We said we'd fall back.<eos> I have a shot at stopping Blake.<eos> I'm taking it.
Go on.<eos> Marilla?<eos> I took the brooch.<eos> I didn't mean to, but I was overcome by an irresistible temptation.<eos> I took it with me when I went to Diana's so I could play Lady Cordelia.
Marilla?<eos> I took the brooch.<eos> I didn't mean to, but I was overcome by an irresistible temptation.<eos> I took it with me when I went to Diana's so I could play Lady Cordelia.<eos> I thought I could put it back before you came home. But when I was crossing the bridge it slipped through my fingers and dropped down into the purple sparkling waves and sank for evermore in the Lake of Shining Waters.
Did your brother believe there was something more?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Do you?<eos> Brooke, every person reaches a point in their life when they ask themselves this question.<eos> There's nothing wrong with you asking it, too.
Ms. Thawley, are you willing to testify on your own behalf?<eos> Yes, Your Honor.<eos> And do you understand that you will have to answer all the questions truthfully, regardless of your feelings, and that failure to do so is punishable by law?<eos> Yes, Your Honor. I'm not afraid of telling the truth.<eos> I'm only afraid of not being able to tell it.
Long story... though Daisy's so confident in her ability as an Inhuman, she believes - she can change the future.<eos> That's funny.<eos> We're trying to do the same --<eos> Power is intoxicating, isn't it?<eos> And he's right -- you never really feel it until you take someone else's away from them.
All I hear are the praises of your good name.<eos> Well earned, it seems.<eos> Very kind.<eos> We missed you at the wedding.<eos> And I regret missing it.
- I did.<eos> But there is...<eos> - No, there is no but.<eos> Even a dog unknowingly craves discipline.<eos> And by the time he attains it, he has forgotten how hard he was beaten.
That wasn't fair, and it wasn't natural.<eos> Women are made to nurture, be adored.<eos> A guy's got to do things.<eos> Anyway, this show is my kingdom and, um, my purpose.<eos> I'm gonna take it back.
Loose lips get waterboarded, and their bodies get dumped in the desert. Am I clear? - Yeah.<eos> - Crystal.<eos> Good.<eos> Because we are going to have some serious eyeballs on us this week, and I want those eyeballs focused on what we do best, which is romance!<eos> So, we are going to take our love story, and we are going to shove it down their throats until they choke.
Okay.<eos> You know how we've, um, talked about how most Inhumans have this feeling where nothing feels right, just empty?<eos> Yeah, like how I spent my entire life searching for my parents.<eos> It's a classic attempt to fill the void.<eos> Well, I tried to fill it with vodka, but I couldn't control it-- the drinking or my temper.
Ooh, and don't forget our G-man disguises.<eos> I always wanted to be a spy.<eos> Now, the file we're after is kept in a secure records room.<eos> In order to gain access, we're going to need to, uh, borrow a magnetic key card.<eos> Because this is so much easier than just shrinking down and stealing it.
Now, the Atlas rocket... that can push us into orbit.<eos> Goes up, delivers the capsule into an elliptical orbit.<eos> Earth's gravity keeps pulling at it but it's going so fast, it keeps missing the Earth.<eos> That's how it stays in orbit.<eos> Now, getting it back down... that's the math we don't know.
Now, getting it back down... that's the math we don't know.<eos> Yes, Katherine.<eos> So the capsule will spin around the Earth forever because there's nothing to slow it down?<eos> That's right.<eos> Slowing it down at precisely the right moment, at precisely the right amount, that's the task.
Thank you.<eos> Planck-Einstein.<eos> The problem... is when the capsule moves from an elliptical orbit to a parabolic orbit.<eos> There's no mathematical formula for that.<eos> Because we can calculate launch and landing... but without this conversion the capsule stays in orbit, we can't bring it back home.
It's chaos inside.<eos> It will take time to regain control.<eos> What are we supposed to do with them until then?<eos> You have a garrison.<eos> Use it.
Two million livre.<eos> It took me six months to design this lock, two smiths a month to construct the door.<eos> It's over a foot thick.<eos> My tools and plans.<eos> You have until midday to dismantle it.
My tools and plans.<eos> You have until midday to dismantle it.<eos> But if I try to remove any of the individual pieces, the mechanism I designed will deadlock the door.<eos> You have to believe me.<eos> If you try to blow it open with gunpowder, you'll bring down the roof.
- Hmm? - I felt for him.<eos> You weren't at the Siege of Salas, Porthos.<eos> What happened?<eos> The Spanish had that town surrounded for almost a year.<eos> And the people defending it were driven to eating dogs, rats...
- Noah's got a little crush.<eos> - Really?<eos> You liked it?<eos> I didn't.<eos> I thought it was dull.
He appeals to your lust, your appetites.<eos> You're more than that.<eos> You're spirit and soul.<eos> You want her soul.<eos> I don't need it.
If we lose Ethan to evil, the night will never end.<eos> And if it is a prophecy, what role do you play?<eos> Are you the savior?<eos> The warrior that ends the night?<eos> Or are you the wolf that loves it?
Again and again.<eos> You know what needs to be done.<eos> You don't have to remind me.<eos> This reckoning is a long time coming.<eos> I intend to enjoy it.
Make you whole, and human.<eos> Free from the burden of hate.<eos> Unblemished by sadness.<eos> My sadness is my own.<eos> I would never give it up.
Go into those dark streets you know so well, those foul alleys and secret back lanes and find me a bad man!<eos> A faithless husband. A cruel lover. A rich despot.<eos> A scrofulous john fucking some girl just like you, and quick with the back of his hand while he's at it. Find him and bring me his right hand!<eos> Yes!<eos> Cut it off and hold it bleeding to your breast!
A faithless husband. A cruel lover. A rich despot.<eos> A scrofulous john fucking some girl just like you, and quick with the back of his hand while he's at it. Find him and bring me his right hand!<eos> Yes!<eos> Cut it off and hold it bleeding to your breast!<eos> Bring it here, fling it on this table, and we shall sing out our joy!
Schrodinger's cat.<eos> Ah, I can see i impressed you all with my artistic abilities.<eos> Schrodinger puts his cat in a box with poisonous food.<eos> Now, until he opens that box, the cat is, in theory, both alive and dead.<eos> But when he opens it, it's either "hello, mittens" or "goodbye, socks."
You're a shitty friend.<eos> - Ethan, man, I'm... I'm sorry.<eos> - Whatever, dude.<eos> Avilo offered me a collaboration deal.<eos> I think I'm gonna take it.
But be patient.<eos> He will come.<eos> No, this is different.<eos> That box has been my sole companion for over 4,000 years.<eos> I don't know why I care so to part with it, but I do.
You know what I remember?<eos> Um... your voice.<eos> Used to read stories to me, sing songs.<eos> I loved that voice.<eos> And I'm sorry you haven't heard it in a while.
- How's he holding up?<eos> - No one comes to me with their feelings.<eos> Yeah, that makes sense.<eos> What about the base?<eos> Still working on fortifying it.
We are colleagues, after all.<eos> That we are, Dr. Simmons, and, um...<eos> That we are.<eos> It's that working relationship which I would like to keep intact.<eos> Yes, we wouldn't want anything to interfere with it.
Then you'd get Daisy back, and the three of you can live as one small, messed-up family again?<eos> - It's a last resort.<eos> - It's insane.<eos> I want your help.<eos> I need it.
Not a chance.<eos> Okay, Coach.<eos> But, we know you're fine.<eos> I have a debilitating disease.<eos> It's called "I'm not going to take another arrow to my stomach-phobia."
I'm just not stupid.<eos> Are you not getting that it could kill us?<eos> You're the one with the power.<eos> They want you to wear it, Josh, because the properties of the mask are based in electro-magnetism.<eos> Pick it up and you'll see.
We know you're not on our side, Theo.<eos> You said you wanted to help Lydia, but you left Eichen with something else, didn't you?<eos> You mean the mask?<eos> Are you worried about that?<eos> Did you put it on?
We want Mason back.<eos> Okay, but the difference is that we want him back alive.<eos> Well, I'm open to compromise.<eos> You still got the map with telluric currents on it?<eos> Bring it to the operating theater in two hours.
But you'll need them if you want Mason to trust you.<eos> I can't take the power from him, can I?<eos> No, only the Beast.<eos> But since the full moon is getting dangerously close, the opportunity might present itself sooner than you think.<eos> Good. As soon as you see that opportunity, take it.
What are you talking about?<eos> Oh, right.<eos> Spoiler alert.<eos> When you were working on me, Julian stole Stefan's body.<eos> I'm gonna go get it back.
The people you think you're keeping safe... Elijah, Rebekah, even Hope... sometimes you do them more harm than good.<eos> What?<eos> What you just said, keeping Rebekah safe.<eos> I know what the weapon is.<eos> I made it myself.
If there was any way to bring Aiden back, I would, no matter what.<eos> If there's even chance for you to be with the guy you want to be with... You got to do it.<eos> I'm guessing you might be a little bit mad right now, but, trust me, you have nothing to worry about.<eos> I just want back what's mine, starting with my dark objects, and I figured I needed to get your attention.<eos> So do I have it?
Traitor to my family,<eos> - thief of that which is mine.<eos> - Don't be dramatic.<eos> Like I said, I just wanted your attention.<eos> And seeing as you're here, I'd say I got it.
You're nothing like me.<eos> You actually believe Aya's going to make good on her promises.<eos> She already has.<eos> She gave me the spell to help the person that I care about more than anything.<eos> All I need now is power, and I'll do whatever I have to to get it.
Well, I have my sources searching for Marcel.<eos> They won't be long.<eos> Still, I can't imagine that this turn of events will improve your odds.<eos> The game's not over.<eos> When the Strix find Marcel, they'll take back the charter and hand-deliver it to me.
Studied them since I was a kid.<eos> That's how I drove them out of New Orleans in the first place.<eos> Rebuilt this city in my image under my rules.<eos> Offered alliances to all of my friends and got rid of everybody else.<eos> This is my city because I took it.
Shadowspire.<eos> I thought I recognized that from someplace.<eos> I ran into alot of those guys back in the 'Stan.<eos> I need to talk to my brother again.<eos> Who would think the reward for confiscating an opium shipment would be additional duty guarding it?
But there are no seams in the casing.<eos> I know. It's built from a single piece of aluminum.<eos> The entire surface connects to an induction charger.<eos> How did you achieve the heat sink?<eos> Curtis Holt achieved it actually.
The police, the FBI, they were never going to stop looking for me.<eos> I realized a life on the run, that wasn't the life that I owed you or your mother, so I disappeared.<eos> You thought you were doing the right thing for us.<eos> Exactly.<eos> I have waited my entire life for that explanation, and the thing is I don't even know if I believe it.
This tiny piece of plastic has more computing power in it than most high-end laptops.<eos> I have half a mind to reverse engineer it for Palmer Tech.<eos> But first?<eos> Yes, I found a tiny flaw in the OS code.<eos> I'm pretty sure I can exploit it to open a back door to his main computer system.
Me?<eos> I knew you were gonna ask me, so I thought I'd beat you to the punch. Heh heh.<eos> Are you ok?<eos> A guy, a brilliant guy says he can put a microchip in my spine and I will walk again.<eos> I'm enough of a geek to know science fiction when I see it.
There is still so much that we don't know about Darhk's power.<eos> We--we don't-- we don't even know what the source of it is.<eos> Wait.<eos> I get my powers from this necklace.<eos> Without it, I'm just a wannabe fashion designer who lives at home with her foster dad, so up to now, everyone I've gone up against with mystical powers has had some sort of totem like mine.
Cutter is... pathological.<eos> I mean, targeting happy couples?<eos> Come on. Well, it makes sense if you look at it from her perspective.<eos> Love betrayed her.<eos> And now she wants to go to war against it.
The bee's inside you.<eos> Well, cut it out!<eos> Do you guys have anesthesia around here or something?<eos> - Curtis, just do it!<eos> - I can't find it. Actually--and this is hard to believe-- we have a bigger problem.
You can't hack it out.<eos> Can you lure it out like some kind of-- I can't believe I'm saying this-- some kind of digital honey or something?<eos> Not exactly, but if these are really modeled after bees, then...<eos> They'll operate on a singular frequency to orientate themselves.<eos> If we can disrupt it, then we can disperse the colony.
We immortals tend to stay out of the affairs of men.<eos> Unless someone owes you money.<eos> Recognize this handsome gent?<eos> Darhk has a similar idol. It gives him his power.<eos> Uh-uh. It only channels it.
Andy told me that Genesis was coming.<eos> I don't think so.<eos> Phil Collins said they'd never tour again.<eos> The old testament, the book of "Genesis."<eos> God wanted to give the world a do-over, so he destroyed it.
I don't think so.<eos> Phil Collins said they'd never tour again.<eos> The old testament, the book of "Genesis."<eos> God wanted to give the world a do-over, so he destroyed it.<eos> He destroyed it with a flood.
I know.<eos> I don't know how.<eos> Because of his magic.<eos> His ma-- it's too strong.<eos> I've seen it before, back on Lian Yu, and it is not just magic.
The only way I know how to fight the darkness is to be darkness, and I don't want to be that type of person anymore.<eos> I'm running for mayor.<eos> And I promise you that I will never stop fighting to save this city.<eos> You're all fretting about this city dying.<eos> I'm here on behalf of an organization that wants you to let it die.
Too bad she would have been wrong this time. Hey, come on.<eos> We can't just lose all hope here.<eos> You have.<eos> I can see it in your eyes.<eos> I just can't believe that I thought that I'd be the one to unite this city while Damien Darhk was trying to kill it.
Someone's got to provide a little optimism.<eos> Doesn't seem like anyone around here is in the head-space to do it.<eos> Then you know we've lost the city.<eos> No.<eos> I know that you're running out of time to get it back.
After 3 terrorist attacks, we were done, but then the night before we were going to start packing, the Green Arrow popped up on our TV, and he reminded me that this city is worth saving,<eos> that my home-- that my home was worth fighting for.<eos> That guy gave me inspiration.<eos> He gave me hope.<eos> And if he could give me hope then, why can't he give it to others now?
And also kind of great.<eos> I think you got hit on the head harder than you realize.<eos> No, no, he's right. I can't hack this system.<eos> But if the nuke gets close enough, which it is...<eos> We could use the line-of-sight attack on the missile itself and disarm it.
Get out of this town!<eos> "Get out." Heh heh heh.<eos> This heartwarming display would mean a whole lot more had I not just seen you all tearing yourselves and your city apart.<eos> That is why I did this.<eos> Humanity is feckless, and I wanted to cleanse it of a millennia worth of rot it has been infected by, and I will do it!
Lyla: Designed to prevent any country, even our own, from firing a nuclear missile.<eos> Darhk ripped it out.<eos> Oliver: Darhk would control the world's nuclear stockpile.<eos> Andy told me that Genesis was coming.<eos> God wanted to give the world a do-over, so he destroyed it.

- Yeah.<eos> - Yeah. Ok.<eos> We have work to do.<eos> HIVE was behind the Havenrock explosion.<eos> They stole a cyber weapon called Rubicon and now are using it to commandeer the world's nukes, so we have less than 24 hours to stop it, or the world is going to experience the sequel to "Wargames."
Are they?<eos> He's not wrong.<eos> The world is coming apart just like Star City.<eos> I mean, it is worse than it has ever been.<eos> That's because Darhk's been spending the past year trying to kill it.
Time is older than man, and infinite.<eos> But in the here and now, we help it think.<eos> Time needs us. Some of us more than others.<eos> Primaries. Primaries... living, breathing gears in time's wristwatch.<eos> We keep it moving, steady, in sync.
Are you sure you're a real doctor? You're right.<eos> We need a trigger.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Your file from J.D. People's.<eos> I kept it in storage. There was something in there.
What do you want from me, Aaron?<eos> I want you to understand.<eos> It doesn't have to be that way anymore.<eos> There's only one way to undo the clock, Cass.<eos> The Witness is destroying people like me, the ones that keep time from falling in on itself, but we can't hold it up forever.
(GROANS)<eos> Don't let her win.<eos> Don't let her take your soul.<eos> TALIA:<eos> If anything, I have cleansed it.
- BATWOMAN:<eos> Get her!<eos> (GRUNTS)<eos> She played us again.<eos> From what Nightwing said, once the programming is broken, it can't be reset.
No.<eos> Do you feel guilty about it?<eos> Not really.<eos> I don't see the world like you do, Christian.<eos> How do you see it?
You have a shotgun pointed at your back.<eos> Don't turn around. Don't move.<eos> Drop the gun.<eos> Don't make the mistake thinking I'll tell you again.<eos> Kick it away.
In the dark depths, she was a ray of hope.<eos> Do you know why I stand guard, why I remain hidden in this place, while the others live in the light?<eos> Once, and only once, did all the gods work as one.<eos> We took all the evil in this world, and we hid it away in this box, Pandora.<eos> And the job of guarding it fell to me.
Got to find a way to shield it or...<eos> Jen!<eos> Let her go!<eos> No longer will I tolerate anyone's meddling!<eos> My power is my own, and no one will take it from me ever again.
It was the uniform of the 8th Virginia Regiment.<eos> Now, most of the 8th Regiment was killed during the Battle of Monmouth, but some defied orders and escaped.<eos> Now... there was an entry in Franklin's notebook.<eos> After Washington captured one of the deserters, the Sisterhood of the Radiant Heart tarred and bandaged the prisoner using infernal materials, thus transforming him into a creature known as the Eternal Soldier.<eos> Revere must have assigned him to protect Betsy's flag, and when we attempted to remove it, the Soldier was awoken.
- He was a Mason.<eos> - That's right.<eos> Now during the war, the British were invading the country and ransacking artifacts everywhere.<eos> They hit the Capitol, the White House, and they were targeting other important sites...<eos> Like Paul Revere's house. So, rather than risk Betsy's flag falling into the wrong hands... Key secured it elsewhere.
There must be some way to calm him down.<eos> That would be me.<eos> So, service grate, windows, air ducts are all sealed off by this force field.<eos> Barrier of mystic energy.<eos> Nothing can penetrate it.
We need a creature.<eos> And we have one standing right here.<eos> Yeah, nice try.<eos> What would happen to me?<eos> The dark energy we draw from you would be directed toward the barrier, breaking it.
Your barrier, away must fall.<eos> By the power left in me, do as I beseech thee!<eos> Joe... he's in pain.<eos> What's wrong?<eos> I can harness the power of the beast, but I can not direct it with precision.
I don't know what I hate about you most:<eos> the way you talk, or the way you treat women.<eos> Let me help you choose.<eos> I know well the value mortals place on love.<eos> Let me take yours... and turn it into pain.
It just takes time... and distance.<eos> No.<eos> I should wake up every morning and feel like this, remembering every drop of blood I spilled.<eos> Do you still have the memory machine?<eos> You used it on that Strucker kid.
You used it on that Strucker kid.<eos> - Daisy, stop.<eos> - Put me in it.<eos> I bet you're already thinking about doing that, right, to jog my memory.<eos> So bring it in here.
- Daisy, stop.<eos> - Put me in it.<eos> I bet you're already thinking about doing that, right, to jog my memory.<eos> So bring it in here.<eos> Make it my bed and keep every memory, every detail right at the surface, where it belongs.
- And?<eos> He asked me to relay that your misgivings regarding their tactics have been noted and shall be conveyed to General Maxwell when he arrives.<eos> However?<eos> He's confident that they're commensurate with the military situation.<eos> And will destroy the city and our ability to govern it.
Georgie!<eos> Father, please, come back, we're desperate, will ya?<eos> Father!<eos> We need food, Father, the bakeries are all closed, them that the rebels haven't taken over.<eos> I can offer neither bread nor milk, but if you have a message for a loved one involved in the rebellion, I'll take it.
- It didn't suck!<eos> Great job today.<eos> It could not have gone better.<eos> My only note would be stop defending Horsin' Around.<eos> Why? Millions of people loved it!
- I'm taking the show off the air.<eos> Wait, what?<eos> Why?<eos> ! I told the story I wanted to tell.<eos> To prolong it for commercial reasons would be crass and inorganic.
We can't let them press the fence.<eos> We go out once a week and clear out the bodies.<eos> You okay?<eos> He had a pickax.<eos> He was swinging it like...
I'd like to try and do something...<eos> Something different with my life.<eos> Something... Something better.<eos> So you're gonna give up the farm?<eos> Well, I mean, I was only renting it, so... I'm just going to be out the money for the barn, but whatever.
Well, I got to see the world.<eos> It's beautiful.<eos> Smaller than you imagine.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I only wanted to make it better.
I know you don't want to kill me.<eos> Want is irrelevant.<eos> I serve Ra's al Ghul.<eos> Remember that move?<eos> You taught it to me.
Because Geronimo's not a terrorist.<eos> He's some ad-guy up in the Green Zone.<eos> Snyder's trial was a farce.<eos> The only thing Geronimo ever led was a really smart street-art campaign.<eos> Some people down here rallied around the message, used it for violence.
The drones zapped my Congressman, but they left this guy behind.<eos> Tell me you can find him.<eos> He ended up here for a reason.<eos> There must be some local connection.<eos> I'm gonna find it, and then I'm gonna find him.
It's worse than I remember.<eos> The rage.<eos> The hunger.<eos> I'd like to blame my anger on Finn, but it's been growing worse since I came back.<eos> I never did learn how to keep it in check.
The Strix are thinning out.<eos> It is back to Nola business as usual.<eos> I'm afraid our plans to vacate have been put on hold.<eos> Three of our upper-level circle are missing, including Fukuda, Bailey and Flynn.<eos> In the wake of Aya's death, you can understand our concern, though you don't seem to share it.
Kol's linked to that candle, so whatever our two lovebirds say, our witches will be able to hear it.<eos> I don't think that a few more minutes of privacy is too much to ask.<eos> I don't give a damn about young love.<eos> They have a task.<eos> They had better finish it.
For better or worse, you're linked to this nasty little coven.<eos> Which means if I take you down...<eos> The sisters go down, too.<eos> How are you gonna do magic?<eos> I'll draw it from the candle that's holding me here.
A Tibetan singing bowl I had cast into a dark object in the 1800s.<eos> It's like an echo chamber.<eos> With Finn's blood, we can amplify the connection he has with Vincent.<eos> But, like everything of mine, Klaus's ex has it now.<eos> I guess I'll just have to pry it out of her hands. Hey!
With Finn's blood, we can amplify the connection he has with Vincent.<eos> But, like everything of mine, Klaus's ex has it now.<eos> I guess I'll just have to pry it out of her hands. Hey!<eos> Cami is my friend.<eos> Now, if you can't play nice, you're gonna sit here and I'll go get it.
He's earned the agony.<eos> Besides, you know how much I love burning things to the ground.<eos> Klaus, when you said that you wanted to work together for Hope's sake, I wanted to see what that looked like.<eos> And now I do.<eos> I appreciate you helping me rescue the wolves, but if there is any chance of making Finn an ally, you should take it.
Yeah, but my friend was one of those consequences that you just damned.<eos> He's hurt real bad because you got sloppy.<eos> 'Cause you're sloppy, man.<eos> So, yeah,<eos> I'm-I'm gonna take the church back, and I'm making it into a sanctuary.
- No, that's the wrong answer!<eos> - No, no, no,<eos> I know this is a war but I've lost a lot of friends, too.<eos> Today... I need your help.<eos> Then you shall have it.
The same power that was used to create Lucien.<eos> Once I have it, I can make Lucien killable again.<eos> So what's the problem?<eos> Everything comes with a price.<eos> In order to take power from the Ancestors, you have to steal it.
Is this what you want?<eos> You do realize that becoming like him will only add to your already substantial misery.<eos> Lucien cannot save you from yourself, nor could Tristan, nor could I, for that matter.<eos> You've spent centuries trying to cure your madness, and yet you're still no closer.<eos> You hold your wicked tongue or I shall pluck it from your wicked skull. Yes!
‭ - What if I'm a liability?<eos> I've been training, so I can punch a bag, but in a real fight?<eos> Cami, here's the thing about being afraid.<eos> If you have to do the thing that you're afraid of, then all this fear is for nothing.<eos> Either turn it into anger or leave it at the door.
What was that?<eos> "If you want a vision of the future, imagine a boot stamping on a human face... forever."<eos> Precisely my point.<eos> This situation is bad enough.<eos> We don't need to make it worse.
A four-karat, unheated Burmese ruby.<eos> And this necklace has special meaning to Magnus Bane as it was a gift from him to his then lover, Camille Belcourt.<eos> What, Camille and Magnus were lovers?<eos> Warlock gets around.<eos> Magnus bought it in 1857 for the price of his London townhouse.
Magnus bought it in 1857 for the price of his London townhouse.<eos> Now, the jewel is enchanted by a spell that alerts the wearer to the presence of demons.<eos> It's so beautiful.<eos> Magnus has longed to reunite with this necklace.<eos> Offer it to him.
- Yes.<eos> Where is my globe?<eos> - What globe?<eos> My snow globe.<eos> I told you, leave it in the car.
So how are your studies progressing?<eos> He's a teacher.<eos> Tutor, it would seem, to young Per Degaton himself.<eos> You say that like it's supposed to mean something.<eos> After the death of his father in five year's time, Per Degaton unleashes the Armageddon Virus, which decimates the world's population, leaving it ripe for conquest.
I live in the real world too, and I've seen it.<eos> - Yeah? What have you seen?<eos> - Redemption, Frank.<eos> - Ah, Jesus Christ.<eos> - It's real. And it's possible.
Well done. You should be a therapist, you should be.<eos> Okay, right.<eos> Well, all I'm saying is, sometimes, you need to listen to other people.<eos> All right, well, I'm listening to you now.<eos> You take a few minutes, play around with the ladder, do what you wanna do, then take it back and get your money back.
And...<eos> I haven't left him, and I think it's because... he continues to show me a good time. He tells me whatever I do is cool.<eos> I mean, I'll make some macramé shit bag, you know?<eos> And he'll just go, "That's a masterpiece," or something. You know what I mean?<eos> Just don't make me carry it.
Oh! And she says it so much that I actually went to an ophthalmologist and got it checked out, and he said, "No, those are just your eyes."<eos> -I like your whistle.<eos> -Thank you.<eos> -That's cool.<eos> I like to put my lips on it.
Yeah. So, what does it matter what they think?<eos> Well, it shouldn't.<eos> And I love Dad, and I love his routine, but it's just not...<eos> I really think it can be much better.<eos> Sarah loves it.
-Whoo! -Hey, two things.<eos> First, FYI, I found out it's free sausage night tonight at the waffle place.<eos> All you can eat.<eos> Secondly, and more important, how do you feel it went out there?<eos> To be honest, I was a little nervous about the poo, but you know, they ate it up, so to speak.
-Will you stop being stupid right now?<eos> -Okay. -Did you see what your face did? -Okay.<eos> I hear you.<eos> -Do you know what your face did?<eos> -I hear your criticism, and I validate it.
Let's do this.<eos> We're risking everything, aren't we?<eos> Going against the Clave, against the other Shadowhunters...<eos> Valentine's trying to destroy the world, Clary.<eos> We're trying to protect it.
You got a lot of cream there.<eos> It can cause a lot of mucus.<eos> Oh, no.<eos> We're not drinkin' it.<eos> No, we're flippin' it.
[Father on screen] We want chocolate!<eos> Give it to us!<eos> [Father on screen] Yeah!<eos> [laughter on screen]<eos> [Father on screen] We'll give it to your sister.
Look, if you have any footage, that would really help me out.<eos> I'm a lot more efficient than the cops.<eos> We have another camera.<eos> At least we had it.<eos> But we put it somewhere we weren't supposed to, so we never told the police.
But we put it somewhere we weren't supposed to, so we never told the police.<eos> Where's that?<eos> Up there.<eos> You sure it's still up there?<eos> It's up there. We tried to get it down.
We split the drilling rights?<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> China puts in more money, but we contribute our drilling technology.<eos> Should we really be sharing that?<eos> They're already trying to hack it from us.
Knock yourself out.<eos> But Tepper ain't talking without a fight.<eos> The DA's pulling his strings.<eos> And he's had plenty of time to bulletproof his story.<eos> We only have 12 hours to tear it down.
You're not gonna believe this.<eos> Holy shit.<eos> Why are the Yakuza digging a hole?<eos> Give me the flashlight.<eos> - Did it hit the bottom?
You're the kind of man this city needs.<eos> Because, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, we all know this city needs help.<eos> Needs it now.<eos> Not tomorrow, not next week, not when the day comes, when the corruption that Wilson Fisk left in his wake is flushed out for good, and the police force is finally back on its feet.<eos> We need it now.
They refused to take action against Savage because he didn't pose a threat to the timeline.<eos> But if he comes into possession of future technology...<eos> It means he's been engaging in exactly the same manipulation of time that the Time Council were designed to prevent.<eos> So now they'll finally sign off on undoing all the damage Savage has done to the world.<eos> Last time I checked, the Time Council was at the edge of the timeline, and this bucket of bolts can barely hold it together as it is.
All this time, I've been wondering why it was so difficult to locate you throughout history.<eos> Because you've been moving through history.<eos> Well, you'll come to learn that this is just one of many things we have in common, Gareeb.<eos> We're both doing what we must to save the world.<eos> Subjugating the world to your rule is not saving it.
You're not a ghost.<eos> You just need to come back to the world.<eos> And I will, after we take out Savage.<eos> I became the Atom to make the world a better place.<eos> And I'm pretty sure that saving it counts.
In 2175, less than ten years from when Savage conquers the world, the Earth is attacked by a warlike race of extraterrestrials from the planet Thanagar.<eos> Without Savage to unite the world under a singular rule, this is what becomes of the world.<eos> This is the work of Savage.<eos> No.<eos> This is what will happen to Earth if Savage is not there to lead it.
The source of all our information on the timeline.<eos> Why did I now know about this?<eos> No captain does.<eos> The Oculus' existence is known only to the High Council, including its greatest secret:<eos> the Oculus not only gives us a window into time, but the ability to shape it as we see fit.
It looks like your friends have cut you loose.<eos> How long do you think you can hold onto power with out the Time Masters backing you?<eos> Not long, I'm afraid, but they have provided me with a timeship.<eos> I no longer need to rule the world, Chay-Ara.<eos> I now have the ability to change it.
It's not that you're afraid that you don't have power over Chloe.<eos> It's that you're afraid that she has power over you, but neither one is true.<eos> - No?<eos> - No. People don't have power over us.<eos> We give it to them.
Mr. Morningstar.<eos> Yes.<eos> Uh, Ryan Goldburg, uh, Kimo's business manager.<eos> I wanted to thank you for making his bail.<eos> Uh, you know, Kimo sure as hell couldn't pay it himself.
The FBI is taking lead.<eos> Figured you might be after the same guys.<eos> And we have jurisdiction.<eos> Okay, so how do we get the wings back?<eos> After the raid? As long as you can prove the wings' provenance, you'll get it back in 30 days.
Amenadiel found Dr. Linda.<eos> He was an angel on her shoulder, trying to control me.<eos> I wonder how my dear, angelic brother got such a wickedly clever idea.<eos> I did it to protect you.<eos> I told you, whatever the danger, I'll be there to stop it. Whether you see it coming or not.
A toast to Dr. Linda Martin, therapist to the Devil himself.<eos> I should put that on the door.<eos> Mm, well, it sounds like he's dealing with some genuine issues.<eos> I'm just having such a hard time getting through to him.<eos> Maybe it's because you've been humoring his metaphor without fully embracing it.
Detective Decker, step away from your vehicle.<eos> Put your hands in the air and walk towards me peacefully.<eos> If you do not--<eos> I repeat-- if you do not, we will have no choice but to shoot you with our new bazooka.<eos> We've actually been waiting months and months to use it, so, on second thought, please, speed away.
And yet you call me a threat.<eos> (SCOFFS)<eos> When I was a little boy, my daddy used to take me and my sister to the movies.<eos> Saw a picture called The Day the Earth Stood Still.<eos> It was about an alien, like yourself, who came to Earth and threatened to destroy it if human beings didn't change their wicked ways.
And half of you will do just as well as bait.<eos> J'ONN J'ONZZ:<eos> You want me, not her.<eos> You may not have a soul, but we share a telepathic bond.<eos> I've been loath to use it, but you left me no choice.
Answer the door. The guy can't knock all day.<eos> Clearly he's not home.<eos> You need to go pay for the pizza.<eos> I don't have any cash.<eos> Can't you pay for it?
Just put a lid on it.<eos> Don't be too... you-ish.<eos> -Jewish?<eos> -You.<eos> No railing against country clubs, don't reference your manifesto, and for God's sakes don't talk about the BP oil spill and what it can do to a crab salad.
Hill got attacked in his home yesterday with his wife and daughter there.<eos> Are they all right?<eos> Yeah, but he's determined to figure out who's behind the bounty so it doesn't happen again.<eos> Well, I don't blame him, but, look, there's something funky about that accountant you asked me to check out.<eos> According to the Office of Professions, he got his CPA license eight years ago, but he's only been making income from it up to four years ago, after that, nada.
"I have...<eos> When... When Jeanette came by, she... she didn't...<eos> she brought the yellow cup that... she didn't want to kick the ball back, but I said, can...<eos> 'Cause Brian's cup is red, that if you... if you...<eos> if you don't have it now, then you don't have to bring the blue...
I'm interviewing to be a bank teller.<eos> You wear a bright color like that, you'll be even more memorable.<eos> If you really want to stand out, after the interview, mail them a thank you note.<eos> It's more personal than a-- than an email.<eos> But the trick is, write it ahead of time and then slip it in the mailbox as you leave.
It's okay, Barry.<eos> You're safe.<eos> I just want to bring the details back. We'll just talk about the details.<eos> A high school from Camden, New Jersey was on a field trip at your place of work and two young ladies came up to you.<eos> And one took your hand and put it under her shirt on her breast and the second one did the same and then they just ran off laughing to their friends.
The whole world will be following this trial, and every argument and decision we make.<eos> All the more reason to uphold the precedents of Nuremberg.<eos> Yes.<eos> As I was saying, we face an immense challenge.<eos> I am confident we will find a way through it.
So...<eos> Isabelle Blanchard was walled in alive.<eos> She died of thirst and hunger and dug into the stone with her nails, trying to get out.<eos> The door must be just behind here.<eos> Find out how to open it and get back to me.
Trust me, Marion's not guilty.<eos> Nothing.<eos> OK, let's go.<eos> Something's not right.<eos> If Marion took the registry page, she must have it at home.
I don't want to leave this place standing.<eos> Agreed, but we have more pressing work at the moment.<eos> Where's the crate?<eos> - It's here.<eos> We cannot let it escape!
Perhaps 100.<eos> I ought to cut you down where you stand.<eos> These facilities mean nothing if we succeed in stopping the Master.<eos> You said they are holding the cargo - at the Tremont facility?<eos> - They were. They got away before we could get to it.
The worms aren't just the vector for transmission.<eos> They seem to comprise the core of their nervous system.<eos> And I'm never eating noodles again.<eos> Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Turn off the microwave!<eos> OK, turn it back on again.
I suppose there's a small chance.<eos> I know that's not what you want to hear, but...<eos> Any chance is better than no chance.<eos> And if I can get that opportunity...<eos> Then you should take it.
I'm just saying, you can't judge me.<eos> Didn't your girlfriend just break up with you?<eos> - Yeah? - Pretty sure she just did.<eos> Hey, Harry.<eos> Wait, so if that app gives you eyes and ears all over the city, then why don't you use it to find the next Ms. Right?
I'm okay.<eos> We can't stay here.<eos> If Vorza got away, he'll be back with an army.<eos> All right.<eos> We need to move the body before somebody discovers it.
-No.<eos> I have to go.<eos> -Grace!<eos> -Sir, you need to pay your bill.<eos> I haven't brought it yet, but I was going to.
Not if Conway is busy fighting public outcry.<eos> Think about the data they have already gathered.<eos> When you sold us this, you said it was going to be a last resort, not the only resort.<eos> There is no risk in getting surveillance approved.<eos> Then we either use it or we don't.
- Norman!<eos> Hey, quiet down now or we'll throw you out.<eos> Hey, get your hands off me, man!<eos> I'm just looking for my friend, man!<eos> Shut your mouth now or I'll shut it for you.
I don't feel like sitting on my ass anymore.<eos> You weren't sitting on your ass last night. I heard you got knocked on it.<eos> That's old business. It's got nothing to do with this.<eos> The hell it doesn't.<eos> You got a gift, son, and I wanna help you use it.
Maybe I should show you houses. [Susan] Yeah!<eos> But first, you gotta look at my super cute condo.<eos> It's my MTV crib. [exclaims]<eos> [Susan] Paul and I have been dying for a vacation home.<eos> You can use it anytime, Maria, because I'm your bestie from the Midwestie. [laughs] [Maria] Oh, it's nice.
The gentlemen of Meta Beta are anything but gentle.<eos> They call me "Shower Bear."<eos> They pass me around.<eos> One time, I came back from my room to find a full human shit inside my Mets hat.<eos> -[gasps] -"Put it on," they said.
Not a euphemism.<eos> And look what we found... your violin.<eos> Play it and see if it still works.<eos> Mom, I hate that violin.<eos> Please burn it.
Because you have everything.<eos> You have a hot English boyfriend.<eos> You're Jewish, which is so cool.<eos> And I was just thinking, I need the part.<eos> I really need it.
-I was doing my patented<eos> Sarah Silverman deadpan, you know, "you can't tell if I'm being real or not" thing.<eos> Oh, you bitches!<eos> -[continues laughing] -Maria, you can have the part.<eos> I don't need it.
Stay strong.<eos> I'm weak.<eos> You married a weak man!<eos> Give it to me.<eos> Give it --
Well, that does nothing.<eos> It's a Himalayan vessel, shaped like an elephant head.<eos> I use it to flush mucus out of my nasal cavities.<eos> It was on the kitchen sink.<eos> Well, then hopefully I threw it away.
Really?<eos> That's wild.<eos> -The quiche is great, Mom.<eos> -Oh, thanks honey,<eos> -but it's bland as shit.
That's wild.<eos> -The quiche is great, Mom.<eos> -Oh, thanks honey,<eos> -but it's bland as shit.<eos> -Oh, no, I think it's delicious.
"Darling Frankie, I was told these brushes are the exact ones Picasso used to paint Guernica.<eos> If this proves wrong, you should know I still had a terrific time sleeping with two Spaniards to get them.<eos> The postcard is the main event, anyway."<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> "I've rented the gallery space, you just need to fill it.
Yeah, your wife said almost 50 years?<eos> That's right. People know me, you know? They trust me to turn it into a mixed-use facility that'll make money, but also won't look like fucking Vegas on the water.<eos> So, what do you have for me?<eos> People come to the Keys because it's one of the most unique places in the entire world, right?<eos> They wanna come and they wanna experience that beauty, but they want it unspoiled. They want it, uh... pure.
It's called Velocity-9.<eos> Ooh, that's a sexy-ass name.<eos> What is it?<eos> It's a speed drug.<eos> Jay took it when you were on Earth-2 to save the city from a meta-human.
I've assembled you all because I need your help.<eos> The future of the world is in peril because of Vandal Savage.<eos> You've turned your back on the very institution you were meant to serve.<eos> The Time Masters, they refuse to take action against Savage because he didn't pose a threat to the timeline.<eos> The Oculus not only gives us a window into time, - but the ability to shape it.
Savage still has Carter and Kendra.<eos> This is a timeship.<eos> A little gift from our friends.<eos> I no longer need to rule the world.<eos> I now have the ability to change it.
It's just a suit.<eos> But the wrong suit.<eos> Sensing his embarrassment and wishing to spare him further blushes,<eos> I tried to make the situation better.<eos> If I was as decorated as you, sir, I would wear my uniform all the time. Wouldn't take it off.
I do not require my wife's company today.<eos> Louis, please.<eos> We must prepare for all that is to come.<eos> Anne, who knows how long I have left in this world.<eos> I do not intend to spend it listening to your lies.
That, man.<eos> That cost three bucks, Chip.<eos> Is that the watermelon that was in your fridge?<eos> - Yeah, and it's gone!<eos> - Yeah... because you ate it.
Replacing drugs or booze or porn, or whatever with a "Higher Power", it's just swapping one crutch for another.<eos> That is a bummer way of looking at things.<eos> Why don't you just tell these people the truth?<eos> Maybe we just need to accept the world for what actually is.<eos> Oh, what about making the world what we want it to be?
There's got to be something we can do.<eos> You need to read between the lines, Quentin.<eos> Jane's doll wasn't special because it looked like Jane.<eos> Was special because of where it came from.<eos> Jane's mother gave it to her... before she died.
More energy than I've felt.<eos> It felt good.<eos> It felt... dangerous.<eos> The reason you treat magic like a drug, is because the people that taught it to you act like drug dealers.<eos> They buy it and they sell it, and they fight and they fuck for it.
Well, that's not the only way to live.<eos> That's the only way I've ever seen.<eos> I'm a very good Magician and I do this.<eos> There are good people out there, Julia.<eos> People trying to learn about the world and make it a better place.
- Yes, sir.<eos> - It's true. But you need to be a monster to defeat Hitler.<eos> - Did Jock give you my box?<eos> - He did, sir. What's in it?<eos> - You'd like me to open it?
- It's true. But you need to be a monster to defeat Hitler.<eos> - Did Jock give you my box?<eos> - He did, sir. What's in it?<eos> - You'd like me to open it?<eos> - Unless you have X-ray vision, you will need to open it, so as to be able to tell me what's in it.
I told her if she does, we'll make sure the bill goes through the Senate.<eos> Can you hand me a towel, please?<eos> - Meechum's hand.<eos> - What?<eos> I traced it on a wall downstairs... a while back.
We gave you access. I need more than I'm getting.<eos> You're supposed to tell me what people want.<eos> People didn't know they wanted jazz until they heard it for the first time.<eos> I can get them to like the music.<eos> I can't compose it.
You know, get a sentence suspended.<eos> Meeting's gonna start.<eos> What is going on, Mac?<eos> The shower's still not working.<eos> Bungalow 3. You were supposed to fix it.
The French police found five shell casings but only three bullets.<eos> One in Sabine, two in the wall behind her.<eos> And what exactly piqued your interest in a case two years old and almost 4,000 miles away?<eos> Mason left his facial recognition software on our computers.<eos> I used it to search for pictures of your father online.
Where are you going?<eos> To the bathroom.<eos> You want to come with me?<eos> Look, I like Raina, but her signature on this petition is problematic.<eos> The imam who circulated it has made numerous inflammatory statements about this country.
If you're out, the only place I'm taking you is to rehab.<eos> - You need help. - Whoa, whoa, okay.<eos> You can take me to Promises when this is all over, but right now, I think you're the only one that needs help.<eos> So, where's my bag?<eos> I threw it out here somewhere... dropped it out the window.
Hello?<eos> It's time to to open your package.<eos> Now?<eos> In the Senator's purse is an identical bottle.<eos> You'll need to swap it out with the one you're holding.
- How'd you end up out there?<eos> - I followed you.<eos> Didn't think it was right for you to be on your own.<eos> Had my personal firearm in my duffel.<eos> I checked it when I came to Quantico.
- I followed you.<eos> Didn't think it was right for you to be on your own.<eos> Had my personal firearm in my duffel.<eos> I checked it when I came to Quantico.<eos> I figured I should check it out when I was leaving.
What happens if they disappear again and you never get the answers that you need?<eos> I know you, Shelby, and you will never stop wondering.<eos> When I lost my father, there was so much that was left unsaid.<eos> You have that chance.<eos> Use it.
I helped build it.<eos> I helped build it with my own hands.<eos> Build what?<eos> The nuke.<eos> You have to find it.
I helped build it with my own hands.<eos> Build what?<eos> The nuke.<eos> You have to find it.<eos> Please, you... you have to find it fast.
O-negative, I'm a universal donor.<eos> Still got to check, handsome. You got banged up pretty good.<eos> May have internal bleeding.<eos> And what about his bite?<eos> Keep it clean.
Just listen to me, Vincent, I am begging you.<eos> I can't-I can't keep turning my back on the law anymore and neither can you.<eos> Uh-uh, no, we've had this conversation.<eos> Yes, but now we have a lead.<eos> And Agent Morgan, he has promised to follow up on it, to help you prove that you're innocent, but you-you've gotta turn yourself in first.
A wicked bunch they were.<eos> A wicked bunch they are.<eos> Sorkaktani demanded that my sister, Oghul Qaimish... pledge her fealty to the House of Tolui.<eos> She would not.<eos> So they stripped her and bathed her in boiling oil... before knifing her skin loose... and peeling it like hide from her bones.
That's how dumb we are.<eos> It's pretty nice.<eos> - Milo's?<eos> The watch. It's got to be worth at least 10 grand.<eos> You plan on keeping it?
The watch. It's got to be worth at least 10 grand.<eos> You plan on keeping it?<eos> I don't know.<eos> You know what?<eos> You should take it.
They're not just testing you, Vincent, they're testing us.<eos> That was my case, my precinct. Great.<eos> What do you want me to do, you know?<eos> Take the gun back?<eos> Just pretend like we never took it in the first place?
461 Pell Street, 90 minutes.<eos> Chinatown, the Triad.<eos> Vincent, you can't give them that gun.<eos> I can't just let a Triad gang member walk.<eos> Obviously I'm gonna have to hand it over if we want this to work.

♪ Haters gonna hate, bakers gonna bake ♪<eos> ♪ Cake in the morning ♪<eos> What's up with this cake?<eos> My class made it for Hunger Action Month.<eos> Then shouldn't they be eating it?
What's up with this cake?<eos> My class made it for Hunger Action Month.<eos> Then shouldn't they be eating it?<eos> No.<eos> I took it away from them, so they could know the true meaning of hunger.
You must have felt like you were at the pool all day. The hot dad dropped his son off late and I had to flirt with him.<eos> He is so hot.<eos> Did you bring any ideas? - Yes, I did.<eos> A compliments board is a great idea.<eos> I think we should christen it by giving each other compliments.
[breathing heavily] Valentine's...<eos> His stele.<eos> Where is it?<eos> Back pocket.<eos> [grunts] Get it.
Let me guess... she's wasting it tormenting herself over Snow White.<eos> You have to talk to her.<eos> She listens to you.<eos> Tell her to let go of this feud.<eos> She doesn't need to let it go.
You have to talk to her.<eos> She listens to you.<eos> Tell her to let go of this feud.<eos> She doesn't need to let it go.<eos> She needs to finish it.
Look, I tried, but he won't take on first year assistants.<eos> Well, you're just his type.<eos> So I'm sure you'll figure it out.<eos> "But where is the door, Martin? "There is always a door to Fillory<eos> "when we really need it,
Braxton knew about Muirfield from his days at the NSA.<eos> He said he had a client from a foreign country that was interested in one of Muirfield's assets.<eos> Turning humans into killing machines.<eos> So Braxton asked Ecklund to acquire Muirfield, and you identified the formula?<eos> No, I improved it.
We have lift off.<eos> The energy is very faint.<eos> It's been dormant for a long time.<eos> Like me.<eos> [chuckles] Let's see if we can wake it up.
No, absolutely not.<eos> You cannot track Jace through your parabatai bond.<eos> It will weaken both of you.<eos> Or break the bond.<eos> Jace already weakened it.
I'll help...<eos> but on one condition. What?<eos> You don't let it go too far.<eos> Now your bond with Jace can withstand a certain amount of strain.<eos> But you have to promise me that you won't let it break.
We have to wake her up.<eos> She loves you so much.<eos> She was always kind of like a second mom to me.<eos> Remember when she got me that sealed copy of Battletoads?<eos> I didn't even care that she opened it.
I just really need my mom.<eos> It's okay.<eos> Join me... and my son!<eos> Pledge me your loyalty!<eos> Together... we can preserve our race and rid the world of the demons who plague it.
I mean, like, really dope, one-of-a-kind magic.<eos> Maybe it'd buy you out.<eos> It'd have to be pretty amazing.<eos> It is.<eos> I've seen it.
Marina.<eos> Run.<eos> Help!<eos> Help!<eos> There are good people out there, Julia, people trying to learn about the world and make it a better place.
Jesus.<eos> You're doing time magic to change what you did.<eos> Yeah, but only a fluke natural-born time witch could do something like that.<eos> Now, I have done all the research there is, and one day, I realized I was looking at it wrong.<eos> We don't have the energy, but it's not that we need to generate it, because somebody already has it.
You had to answer the call.<eos> I had been trying to solve that case for years.<eos> Domestic homicide.<eos> A witness came forward.<eos> He was going to be deported, we had the tiniest window of opportunity, so I took it.
I want to provoke people back into the reality of this moment.<eos> That's how they change.<eos> He meant well.<eos> Look how he fucked up.<eos> He set the bar so high, I don't even know if it's possible to reach it.
He taught you, you didn't have to do anything to be loved.<eos> You should have all your needs be met.<eos> He's a beautiful man with a big heart that fucked you up.<eos> And made you think you were entitled, and when you're not, you're confused why it didn't come your way.<eos> Made it so that you could take love away if you didn't get it 'cause you had no fear of losing it 'cause he always gave it to you.
Where an energy will come through you and you can celebrate that with your voice in that moment.<eos> Get ready.<eos> Open your eyes whenever you're ready.<eos> And when you want, you can stand... and you can begin to stretch, and you can feel the energy build inside you.<eos> Let it build.
There was a point when I felt, uh,<eos> "Yeah, I can trust.<eos> I'm in the right place."<eos> Everybody wants to know what happened after the call.<eos> I feel like I came in here and I had the weight of the world with me, and I feel like I set it down and I don't wanna pick it back up.
? - Stay the fuck away from him!<eos> I got this.<eos> I've made a huge mess.<eos> Yeah, you really fudged the bowl this time, didn't you?<eos> And now you want me to put the old rubber gloves on and help you scrub it clean.
- Mom's not gonna like that.<eos> - Yeah, let's see how she likes it when we can't afford her rum and smokes 'cause we're too backed up.<eos> Hey. You remember how I showed you.<eos> Shut off that water supply and let the pressure out.<eos> And Jonas when that snake finds its way back you kill it.
That'll be tough with Blaise.<eos> - You looking for the gun? - Yeah.<eos> It's gone.<eos> - What?<eos> - I got rid of it this morning.
- I got rid of it this morning.<eos> - While you were passed out.<eos> - Casey, why would you do that?<eos> Because it scares me.<eos> It scares me more to think about what we're supposed to do without it.
- I was setting a trap.<eos> - A trap?<eos> - On your roof.<eos> - What happened?<eos> - I tried it out. - How?
And now, to the situation unfolding in Shady Glen.<eos> Authorities are calling it a bath salts scare, and we're moving there now to get you the full story at 11:00.<eos> Hey, it's Reuben, right?<eos> What's the deal with the lemonade?<eos> Mom makes it every night.
Wow. What a piece of shit.<eos> "I'm gonna kill you."<eos> Are you kiddin' me?<eos> Did you see what just happened, what I just did? You just...<eos> Your best chance... is to stand up, grab that ax, and drive it through the back of my head.
Hercules. He can help us.<eos> We save him.<eos> He can save us.<eos> Mom, we already covered this trail.<eos> It was cold. Then we cover it again, and we keep going until we find a trail that's hot.
Its...<eos> Its teeth can crush your bones with a single bite.<eos> And those eyes... they burn right through your soul as it finishes you off.<eos> Nothing can defeat this monster.<eos> That's not true. I know exactly what this beast is... and how we can defeat it.
Good God.<eos> We must send a warning.<eos> To cover our backs.<eos> Kenneth, it should probably come from you, as chief scientist.<eos> Address it to the PM.
We must send a warning.<eos> To cover our backs.<eos> Kenneth, it should probably come from you, as chief scientist.<eos> Address it to the PM.<eos> He'll never read it, of course.

Kenneth, it should probably come from you, as chief scientist.<eos> Address it to the PM.<eos> He'll never read it, of course.<eos> But the important thing is we sent it.<eos> I'll get it to Downing Street right away.
Donna, I don't think you get it.<eos> There is going to come a time where you're gonna have to choose between yourself and them, and I am not going to let you throw your life away for either one of them.<eos> You know what, Louis?<eos> If they're gonna come for me, they're gonna come for me.<eos> But until then, if Mike and Harvey need my help, I'm gonna give it to them.
It doesn't matter if Forstman finds out or not if he doesn't have someone on the inside working for him.<eos> What are you saying?<eos> I'm saying that if they want me to point the finger at someone, that means I'm holding a gun.<eos> It's still alive.<eos> Did you think I would let it die?
What are you saying?<eos> I'm saying that if they want me to point the finger at someone, that means I'm holding a gun.<eos> It's still alive.<eos> Did you think I would let it die?<eos> No, but I thought you might give it away.
She's not gonna retract the email.<eos> Shit.<eos> What did she say?<eos> Oh, what the hell do you think she said?<eos> Said she knows you're a fraud, she's not gonna take it back, and now that she's figured out that I've been a part of it, she can't stand the sight of me.
She can't stand the sight of me.<eos> Louis, I know you're feeling bad, but right now, Donna is under the gun.<eos> What do you want me to do about that?<eos> I don't know, but if she doesn't retract that email and they find her...<eos> No, they're not gonna find her, because she sent it from a general faculty email because she's ashamed of herself like she's ashamed of me.
Oh, since you made me come all the way down here, I thought I'd save the taxpayers some money on hiring a server. A server for what?<eos> For your fiancée.<eos> I'd like to ask her some questions.<eos> Get the hell out of here.<eos> You want to serve a subpoena, you serve it to her.
I didn't come forward.<eos> They found me.<eos> And I'm not pulling any associate shit.<eos> Then what do you call this pathetic excuse of a candidates list?<eos> - I call it inevitable.
And no one is going to risk their career on a place that may not even exist in a month.<eos> They might, if you convince them to.<eos> - Louis, I can't do that.<eos> - Sheila, please.<eos> I came here once before, hoping for a second chance and you wouldn't give it to me.
If you don't do something, he will.<eos> Jack, I don't often come outside for my coffee, but when I do is because I'm feeling the need for a little alone time.<eos> Well, I came out here because I knew you wouldn't want anyone hearing what I have to say.<eos> Are you here to tell me you can get the job done?<eos> No, I'm here to tell you if you want me to get it done, you're going to have to open your wallet.
And now there are allegations that he's taken the LSATs for people.<eos> I can't believe this.<eos> I took that test myself. And I have a responsibility to protect the reputation of this university.<eos> And how exactly are you proposing to protect that reputation?<eos> By expelling any dangers to it.
If I go down because of my call, I can take it.<eos> If I go down because of yours, I can't.<eos> This isn't just your life.<eos> This is all of ours.<eos> Well, like I said, it's my call and I'm making it.
Please. These people need your help.<eos> I didn't come forward.<eos> They found me. And I'm not pulling any associate shit.<eos> Then what do you call this pathetic excuse of a candidates list?<eos> I call it inevitable, because our students can read.
Because I've never been on any class ranking, and I'm the best legal secretary in the city.<eos> That's a quippy response, Ms. Paulsen.<eos> But if you were so good at your job, how would you allow someone who wasn't even on the interview list to get in a room alone with Harvey Specter?<eos> I'm sure you'll recognize this list.<eos> After all, you typed it up.
GRETCHEN:<eos> Hello? Are you in the office?<eos> It's Thursday night.<eos> Pm watching my show.<eos> LOUIS: Well, then, goddamn TiVo it because I need your help.
No, he doesn't. And it's time for him to put the clipboard down and get in the game.<eos> Harvey.<eos> Donna, this wasn't just some move to slip testimony in.<eos> This is Mike's life.<eos> It's his story, and he needs to be the one to tell it.
My whole life, I have wanted to be a lawyer so that I could help people like Clifford Danner.<eos> People who have no one else to fight for them.<eos> No one who believes in them.<eos> But instead, all I've done as a lawyer is work night and day to put money into the hands of rich people.<eos> I was given a gift and I wasted it. And I'm ashamed of myself.
Mike, they might not come back for days.<eos> I don't know what to tell you, Harvey, but I can't leave here.<eos> It's okay, Harvey.<eos> Look.<eos> Mike, if we really don't have time, I don't want to waste it here.
- It could have been zero. - They took...<eos> Why couldn't you just wait for the verdict?<eos> Because I have to live with myself for the rest of my life.<eos> I made a decision, and I...<eos> I can't go back in time and change it.
Wait.<eos> I want to speak to him.<eos> Call him.<eos> I don't have his number.<eos> I've got it.
Who are you with?<eos> Call me when you're alone.<eos> We need to talk.<eos> At my number.<eos> I don't know it.
If you want to move people, you have to let yourself be moved.<eos> And no one's cracked Ms Boot yet!<eos> That's the lot?<eos> Ben's box is the way I packed it.<eos> Didn't you even open it?
Someone's in the house.<eos> Hey, Lee, I'm not staying up here by myself.<eos> Where's your gun?<eos> Where it should be, locked, in a drawer upstairs.<eos> Do we need to go back up and get it?
To me, that is sad.<eos> You're an approval junkie.<eos> You care too much what others think of you.<eos> We know this. It's what you think that matters.<eos> You need to find your voice and listen to it.
Between breath...<eos> Tell it to somebody who cares!<eos> Ashley, you are...<eos> Take a breath, buddy!<eos> You're going to need it!
He's a... a go-between for...<eos> For?<eos> Look, I want to keep you out of this as much as possible, okay?<eos> I have a number.<eos> I need you to trace it.
This place has an airstrip?<eos> The mining companies built it back in the '80s before they moved out.<eos> That's when the pirates moved in.<eos> This island is basically a safe port if the waters get too rough for them.<eos> But they use it too inconsistently for the government to really do anything about it.
And who are you?<eos> Good day, Assistant Director Mayfair.<eos> Chief Inspector Fischer, this can't be good.<eos> This unfounded negativity that you're directing towards the Office of Professional Responsibility, it's... it's poor leadership, Bethany.<eos> My negativity isn't unfounded and it's not directed towards the Office of Professional Responsibility.
No, you have to get closer to the stratosphere.<eos> - The plane.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> They got their hands on a Pegasus rocket.<eos> They're planning to attach it to the plane's fuselage.
Is he...<eos> - I don't know.<eos> - I'll go back for him.<eos> Hold on, hold on, he's buying us some time, okay?<eos> Let's use it.
He told you all this on a postcard?<eos> It wasn't supposed to end like this.<eos> You're ZOMO.<eos> Aren't you?<eos> The only prints on that postcard were yours, 'cause you wrote it.
It belonged to your mom.<eos> She bought it when you were born... to match your eyes.<eos> How did you...<eos> After she passed away, some of her things were sold.<eos> I knew how much that necklace meant to her, so I bought it.
We'll be ready.<eos> what is fair, and what is just.<eos> Chang.<eos> You got your security clearance.<eos> Senator Haas signed it herself.
It's the WMD team.<eos> The bomb is gone.<eos> Response team confirms...<eos> It's gone.<eos> The terrorist took it.
Maybe none, but either way, we got to get this nuke as far away as possible in case I fail.<eos> No, he's right.<eos> There's thousands of people on this base.<eos> It's our only option.<eos> Okay, we could... we could drive it out to the small arms range.
Blood pressure not bothering you anymore?<eos> According to your medical records that were released after the election, you don't have a blood-pressure problem, hence you don't have a blood-pressure prescription.<eos> So I don't understand why Liam O'Connor would blackmail me into swapping out pills that you were never really taking.<eos> I'm sorry. Were you asking me a question or making an accusation?<eos> I'm giving you a chance to tell me the truth before I devote my life to proving it.
Come on.<eos> First a bomb threat, then a forced evacuation.<eos> I've always known it was you.<eos> - Put the gun down, Ryan.<eos> - Yeah, I'll put it down when you tell me what the hell you're doing with my computer. - I'm getting evidence.
A whole city dedicated to his new religion of the sun.<eos> But of course, his people didn't want to be sun worshippers.<eos> They simply wanted their old gods back.<eos> - What did they do?<eos> - Well, when Akhenaten died, his people abandoned the city. Left it for the desert to claim.
Half the day we're just gossiping amongst ourselves wondering what that fantastic object that your chap's carrying past is.<eos> And you think there is an appetite for this story?<eos> Mr Carter.<eos> Right now, you are the talk of the world.<eos> You could give me your laundry list and I'd put it on the front page.
I couldn't save his.<eos> I couldn't save his.<eos> You had a few scenes today with the prop gun.<eos> Any idea where you might have put it down?<eos> I didn't put it down.
This is what you get when a TV show worships at the altar of youth, bimbos and himbos running around screaming, in a school where, apparently, shop class isn't the only place to see something wooden and poorly constructed.<eos> That one needs to remember her character's emotional truth.<eos> That's the essence of acting.<eos> It's a search for truth.<eos> Tell me more about this truth and how to find it.
Puberty was a real heartbreak. Okay.<eos> Now, think of your hips as a bowl of fruit.<eos> So, you don't wanna tilt one side or the other too much, 'cause then your grapes are gonna go fallin' out, right?<eos> All right, so, second position.<eos> You remember it?
Beth.<eos> What are you talking about now?<eos> That's why she wanted to kill me.<eos> Beth held a gun to my head.<eos> And Evie put it in her hand.
I want out, and I don't even have a credit card.<eos> Here, use mine.<eos> Oh, wait, you maxed it out already.<eos> It's okay.<eos> I didn't need it anymore.
Yes, but we can't repackage you, I'm afraid.<eos> - What is this?<eos> - I'm sorry, Evie.<eos> It absolves the Brightborn entity of wrongdoing, and protects the patents from further legal actions.<eos> No, I built this. It's my technology, I'm not about to sign it away.
Maybe we'll be light on a drop, or maybe one of ours will look at one of theirs the wrong way, or maybe they'll just decide to stop honoring the deal.<eos> Things will go bad.<eos> And when they do the Kingdom will fall.<eos> I had a family.<eos> I lost it to this world.
I didn't say he fucked her.<eos> Well, why else?<eos> Dude's weird.<eos> He came over to my place last week, we have a couple of drinks, and this cockroach crawls out.<eos> But instead of stepping on it, he... put it in the blender.
The machine is in perpetual splinter sequence.<eos> Now that we have the array, we can stop the machine from dispersing more temporal energy.<eos> If we can not shut down the Core, that machine is going to turn this entire place into a crater a mile wide.<eos> Crater I understand.<eos> Listen, Mr. Deacon, you have to see that they shut it down.
It's over. Everything.<eos> The woman has a daughter.<eos> She just wants to find her baby girl.<eos> How are you gonna get out the front door?<eos> I'm gonna open it for her. Really?
Sight, smell, taste.<eos> Yeah. Hearing, too.<eos> Old injuries heal.<eos> I had a bad shoulder.<eos> I can feel it again now.
Nothing.<eos> Just some military stuff, it's all blacked out.<eos> Even your real name is blacked out. Where is the file, Axel?<eos> Give me the goddamn file?<eos> I left it back at the base.
I was a skeptic at first, but inside these walls we're free from the horrors out there.<eos> Or just hiding from reality.<eos> I had a friend who felt like you.<eos> Walls and barricades meant safety, but... eventually the real world comes crashing in.<eos> If there's a better alternative, I've never found it.
Made sure it was never in just one place, you know?<eos> He made sure it was all in different places, I have no idea why.<eos> Hey, hey, hey.<eos> It's ok.<eos> We'll find it, ok?
To change the world.<eos> But in your case, this is truth.<eos> You are.<eos> You will.<eos> But you will not save it.
Back...<eos> Doc... die!<eos> Wooden crate. Five feet by two by one.<eos> Not ringing' any bells.<eos> I saw you receive it. Where's it at?
Just a cold going around.<eos> There's a battle.<eos> Deep inside.<eos> Your soul is being torn.<eos> You must protect it.
♪ Something, something, rhymes with Jacks... ♪<eos> Well, hello.<eos> "Linda, from the moment I saw you, "I realized, that you were one of the only Lindas for me."<eos> Yeah, that'll work.<eos> Strap on the old chainsaw, give it a few revs, seal the deal!
All I got to do is find Baal once, shove this down his throat.<eos> That way, even if he sheds his skin, I can still find him, take my chainsaw...<eos> And shove it right up Baal's ass?<eos> You're like the daughter I never had.<eos> Your chainsaw is never going to stop Baal, no matter where you shove it.
My family was here when it started.<eos> Some left. Border was closed. We were trapped.<eos> What do you want?<eos> We want your help.<eos> We need it.
Don't put me on hold.<eos> Do you know who I am?<eos> I just won a Baby's Choice Award, the winner of which has gone to take home the Oscar seven of the last 15 years.<eos> So, yeah, that BoJack Horseman.<eos> Otherwise known as the guy you keep sending your dumb newspaper to even though I never subscribed to it.
Driver, you're starting to make me feel uncomfortable.<eos> Yeah, Todd.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Has a creepy driver ever given you his number or told you that you reminded him of his dead girlfriend?<eos> Or repeated your address slowly, like he was trying to memorize it?
And you're the one who's been stealing our food.<eos> You already know too much.<eos> Smoke bomb. Hi-yah!<eos> -Why did you throw a plum on the floor?<eos> -Thought it was a smoke bomb.
Who knows? It might be worth something someday.<eos> You're sweet, Todd.<eos> You shouldn't waste that on people who don't deserve it.<eos> Hey, you want this plum?<eos> I found it in the kitchen.
Penny?<eos> You know, on the plus side, she really seemed okay.<eos> Mm-hmm. -Until she saw you and freaked out. -[groans]<eos> But she probably would have been totally fine if you'd never shown up. -Oh, God.<eos> -I think the wound was completely healed before you reopened it by showing up unannounced at her college and all the pain came rushing back to her.
Uh, what?<eos> But here I am blah-blah-blah-ing about my own boring, sexy, thrilling life.<eos> What is going on with you?<eos> Well, actually, I'm doing this new show, The BoJack Horseman Show.<eos> -I don't know if you've seen it or--
Look.<eos> You have to look!<eos> Oh, William.<eos> There is beauty in this world.<eos> Arnold made it that way, but people like you keep spreading over it like a stain!
There is beauty in this world.<eos> Arnold made it that way, but people like you keep spreading over it like a stain!<eos> Okay, I don't know who the fuck this Arnold is, but your world was built... for me... and people like me.<eos> Not for you.<eos> Then someone's got to burn it clean.
We're about 11,400 feet, continental divide.<eos> Beautiful spring day.<eos> So basically, the snow that falls on this side, melts out, flows down into the Gulf of Mexico and on into the Atlantic.<eos> Then the snow on this side flows into the Pacific, and around she goes.<eos> Travis took this idea about the hydrological cycle and turned it into this epic journey.
This hydrological cycle, it's easy to just write it off as, well, that's the weather.<eos> We steal a lot of the magic from things that we give names to.<eos> It's this beautiful, choreographed cycle of life.<eos> If you were standing on the moon looking back at Earth, at one point during the day, you're looking at a blue planet.<eos> The ocean traps the sun's heat energy and turns it into a solar engine.
- I've never been here before.<eos> - Sure, you have.<eos> You even brought me once.<eos> Of course, then the whole town was buried under sand.<eos> Ford must have dug it up again.
- ( To Dr. Ford. ) - ( Cheers!<eos> )<eos> Revision and timing by jog (c) 2016 [ Subtitle Edit 3.5.0 ]<eos> Drop your weapon!<eos> Drop it!
Like I said, I'm desperate.<eos> This is my last stop before the psychic.<eos> But, hey, you've got your hands full, so I'll let you know how it goes on the crystal ball circuit.<eos> Leave the file.<eos> I'll look at it when I can.
The map I was telling you about... to buried treasure, underground missile silos, whatever you were thinking.<eos> I wasn't thinking anything.<eos> The map's for Dany.<eos> Remember Dany?<eos> Client of Dany wants it.
Sorry.<eos> So, I can come to them, they can come to me, whichever's easiest.<eos> I-I'll give them a call today. Thank you.<eos> To a new beginning, Mr. Mayor... for me and this town.<eos> Oh, how the sun shines when you take time to look at it.
We've watched you.<eos> We waited.<eos> Now we're here.<eos> You are in possession of an enormous power.<eos> We need it back.
Davie throws the salt.<eos> But that... that's enough. Thank you.<eos> Uh, Angie?<eos> And Ben.<eos> God then cast a thunderbolt upon the city and set it on fire with its inhabitants and laid waste the country with the like burning.
What about the church?<eos> Well, y-you don't know?<eos> Well, they're tearing it down.<eos> What?<eos> ! Preacher, he... he gave it to Mr. Quincannon.
Well, they're tearing it down.<eos> What?<eos> ! Preacher, he... he gave it to Mr. Quincannon.<eos> Well, at least, he was supposed to.<eos> He gave it?
Get 'em out of there!<eos> That it? !<eos> All right.<eos> Put the gun down, Donnie.<eos> Donnie, don't make me use it.
What do you mean?<eos> How do you think Fort Rozz escaped the Phantom Zone?<eos> For decades, I searched the Phantom Zone with my mind. Looking for a way out. And then, I found you.<eos> I activated your pod.<eos> I linked it to the prison.
To most people I'm an assistant at Catco Worldwide Media. But in secret, I work with my adoptive sister for the DEO to protect my city from alien life and anyone else that means to cause it harm.<eos> I am Supergirl.<eos> HANK HENSHAW:<eos> Previously on Supergirl...<eos> CAT: She broke a story, and then, gave it to my biggest competitor.
Take the other cuff off of the Martian.<eos> I got it.<eos> Let's do this.<eos> J'onn, Supergirl, be careful.<eos> Keep it safe for me?
I'd just like to enjoy it a little more.<eos> And you will.<eos> I promise.<eos> Your hand is still on my knee.<eos> I could move it up.
Through it, the apartment was wonderful.<eos> She made a real home from it.<eos> If it had gone along, it would have looked like a student's house.<eos> I lost them on the first attack in the stadium.<eos> It was completely destroyed, full of smoke, and I could not find it anywhere.
But looking to the past for our inspiration would be a mistake in my view.<eos> Britain today is not the Britain of past coronations.<eos> Assumptions made at the time of my father-in-law's coronation 17 years ago cannot be made anymore.<eos> That is why I think we should adapt this ceremony.<eos> Make it less ostentatious.
Look, I've seen my share of this kind of thing.<eos> You're referring to your experience with soldiers wounded in war?<eos> Look, the emotional recovery can be as tough as the physical one, but there's nothing more important than hope.<eos> A city worker found a body off the expressway.<eos> They're bringing it to the lab now.
That would be amazing, honey.<eos> And you know what else?<eos> My guitar should arrive today.<eos> My Harlequin guitar, direct from Esteban.<eos> Is Esteban gonna deliver it personally?
- A Lycanthrope.<eos> - What is that?<eos> Like a Blutbad on steroids.<eos> Make sure the isolation cell is available.<eos> We're gonna use it.
And we thought we were dead.<eos> Not a single bullet hit us.<eos> We thought it was some kind of miracle.<eos> Now, there's two ways to look at that story.<eos> The way I like to look at it... it wasn't our day to die.
Now, there's two ways to look at that story.<eos> The way I like to look at it... it wasn't our day to die.<eos> God or time or whatever... didn't want us to die.<eos> Thinking like that helped us through some hard times... believing that there's something out there helping you out.<eos> What's the other way to look at it?
He had never stitched a thing in his life.<eos> What about my father?<eos> What was he like?<eos> He had an overdeveloped sense of self-preservation... and ambition.<eos> He built this machine, and I made it work.
The report mentions a place called Titan and a man called The Witness.<eos> - This is it.<eos> - We go back to 1961, we find Kirschner before the Mossad does, we find Titan, we find The Witness, we cut the head off of the snake.<eos> That's not gonna stop the storms out there.<eos> We save the world by killing the one who destroys it.
We stop the paradox, we fix time?<eos> It's more a hope than... certainty.<eos> You all right?<eos> It's come down to this.<eos> If only the world had a better physicist to save it.
The Cosmic Treadmill.<eos> She's a time machine powered by my super speed.<eos> At least in theory.<eos> Flash and I have been developing the plans for this device but we've never tested it.<eos> Once activated, it could very well create a rift in the time stream causing a chain reaction throughout the universe causing all of space-time to collapse in on itself.
I want to show you something.<eos> Remember all that money in our joint account?<eos> This is what we did with it.<eos> Bonnie, you bought a gallery?<eos> We bought it.
This is a DOD contract.<eos> If Wall Street gets wind of even a potential claim, a core descent decline in stock-- that's a billion-dollar-plus--<eos> If he does file a claim, it'll be wrongful death.<eos> Let's begin drafting a response.<eos> Have the mouse write it.
I'm sorry for your loss.<eos> I don't think he's our guy.<eos> He did seem pretty rattled about his nephew.<eos> Could be someone with a death wish wanted to send Mr. Boss a serious message.<eos> And we just delivered it.
Hey, you know what?<eos> I took a couple of cosmetology classes at the community college.<eos> I could give you a little makeover!<eos> She's beautiful, Ma!<eos> Yeah, so is the sun, but you can't stare directly at it.
Braving the elements!<eos> Keeping the family dry!<eos> That is fur!<eos> What's the plan, Luke?<eos> There are no bad ideas, but waving a metal shovel around in an electrical storm could have a downside, so let's put it back in the garage, huh?
You won't even touch me.<eos> And then I find Beth's uniform?<eos> So you tell me, okay?<eos> What do you do with it anyway?<eos> You... you... you sniff it, you snuggle it, you put it on a coat rack and dance with it?
Through folk art.<eos> Specifically, chain saw sculpting.<eos> One uses a chain saw to artfully sculpt entire tree trunks into a bear perhaps or an eagle.<eos> All rather kitsch and extremely loud.<eos> I'd retrieved my chain saw from storage, and I was in the process of oiling it when that fire broke out.
Funny thing about that toothbrush. It disappeared around the same time as the test.<eos> The private lab which compared the two samples chalked it up to human error.<eos> We think the imposter had an accomplice, someone inside the lab who made sure to test her DNA against itself and then got rid of the toothbrush to prevent future tests.<eos> Frankly, Captain, I'm surprised you don't find our thesis more compelling.<eos> I find it compelling as hell, but I also think I'm the only parent in the room.
I'm not going to miss you.<eos> This pathological liar brain is gonna get me in trouble.<eos> I can feel it.<eos> Not with me.<eos> I'll know the truth when I hear it.
Maybe I'll... I'll go down and help him fight.<eos> Look.<eos> May I be blunt?<eos> You want power.<eos> I offer it.
He could've seen the agent punch in the lockbox code, then gone back there any time.<eos> Let's go get some... decent coffee.<eos> That's the apartment that the AC unit fell out of?<eos> It was pushed out. Oh.<eos> Yeah, I looked at it.
Any idea of the brand?<eos> Well, there was a can at the scene, but the label's burned off.<eos> What's up?<eos> Blaine's dad had a cabin up in Whistler.<eos> Finally got the Canadians to let us search it.
But what?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> Sorry. I really do have a company to run.<eos> By all means, come back when you have a warrant.<eos> The door's right where you left it, behind you.
No!<eos> What?<eos> Where's Janko?<eos> We were fighting for the tranquilizer gun, and we rolled around and it went off, and...<eos> He had it set for a massive overdose.
It was self-defense.<eos> You saved both of our lives.<eos> Maybe we don't report it.<eos> And we, uh...<eos> We, we smuggle the body out, and dump it in the bay.
Maybe we don't report it.<eos> And we, uh...<eos> We, we smuggle the body out, and dump it in the bay.<eos> Is that what you do?<eos> Dump it in the bay by the cover of darkness?
Absolutely. Right.<eos> I get it. I get it.<eos> But look, a deposition's not rocket science. There's a way to deal with them.<eos> There's really five simple rules.<eos> When they ask you a question, if you don't understand it, just ask them to repeat it. All right.
The old firing range at Quantico?<eos> Isn't it shut down?<eos> Yeah, 10 years ago.<eos> Every class that went through there had a unique baseball cap.<eos> So he put it in the back window to look legit to cops and other agents.
She's terrified, Andrew.<eos> You hear her breathing?<eos> Do you remember feeling scared like that when you were being smothered in that gym mat?<eos> "You see what power is--<eos> "holding someone else's fear in our hand and showing it to them."
- No judgment.<eos> - We saved your life.<eos> All right, so there might be a solution here.<eos> Uh, a weapon.<eos> It sounds like if we could find it, we could use it to kill The Beast.
I can't teach it to you.<eos> Look, most people can't do battle magic except in crazy spurts.<eos> Like baby-trapped-under-a-car type shit.<eos> But you can do it on cue.<eos> Yeah, 'cause I studied it for years.
It healed him.<eos> All of him. There's this thing about you, Q.<eos> You actually believe in magic.<eos> - So does everyone.<eos> - No. We all knows it's real, but you believe in it.
All of him. There's this thing about you, Q.<eos> You actually believe in magic.<eos> - So does everyone.<eos> - No. We all knows it's real, but you believe in it.<eos> And you just love it, pure and simple.
I was kind of poking around in the dark with that one.<eos> Okay, what does Jane have to do with The Beast?<eos> Do you remember the gift that Jane was given in the book "The Girl Who Told Time"?<eos> Uh, yeah, Ember gave her a watch and a locket.<eos> Ember gave her the ability to fuck with time on a cosmic scale, and Jane used it to create a time loop.
39 times.<eos> And if you die a 40th, at least I won't have to hear you ask me this question ever again.<eos> Jane's dead, Quentin.<eos> The loop's done.<eos> There's no one to reset it.
The loop's done.<eos> There's no one to reset it.<eos> So this is it?<eos> This isn't my problem.<eos> My problem is that I'm strong enough to discern a time loop but not strong enough to change it.
Mr. Cooperman's health issue means the defense was not given the opportunity to cross-examine him.<eos> Not giving the defense their right to confront the witness against them is prohibited by law, unfair, and unduly prejudicial.<eos> You are therefore instructed to disregard all of Mr. Cooperman's testimony.<eos> It is not part of the trial record. It is not evidence.<eos> You may not consider it in any way.
This request has just come in.<eos> Should I send them a notification?<eos> No...<eos> He likes surprises.<eos> I'm not giving up a permanent position, I'm not giving it up.
Oh, yeah.<eos> - She's... she's adorable.<eos> So hopeful.<eos> I love her work, too.<eos> Yeah, you should look at it at her studio.
Hold on.<eos> Hold on.<eos> Give me that... give me that napkin.<eos> Please, please, please.<eos> - Dry it... dry it off.
System reboot.<eos> System reboot.<eos> System reboot.<eos> System reboot.<eos> I was on this mountain yesterday and I took this landscape I drew this landscape, and I thought it was so peaceful and beautiful and I just wanted to show it to you because it was so...
Wow.<eos> The last time I saw my grandma, the most exciting thing was watching the ash of her cigarette get longer and wondering if it was gonna fall in her pudding.<eos> Did it?<eos> Yeah, right in there.<eos> She ate it and everything.
Okay, since it is our session, can I talk about this fucking music, okay?<eos> This elevator music from hell.<eos> Is this music?<eos> I mean, it feels like--<eos> If it is, please turn it up so I can recognize it as music, otherwise turn it the fuck down, 'cause I want to skull-fuck someone with this Guantanamo Bay shit!
Lopez, Takata, you're up.<eos> There.<eos> That pause.<eos> What is that?<eos> Hate to break it to you, but that's normal for Takata.
She's ultra-focused, competitive as hell, and walled off from everyone.<eos> Kind of like you were.<eos> Hey, wait a second.<eos> Bardot's tactical gear, we didn't find it in his dorm room.<eos> No, we put lockers in so they could keep it here.
I don't remember.<eos> What's in the bag?<eos> Why?<eos> I don't know.<eos> You put it on the table. It m-must mean something.
Good.<eos> You're a quick study.<eos> Thanks, Captain.<eos> We got the murder weapon.<eos> A dumpster diver found it buried in a bag of garbage.
A dumpster diver found it buried in a bag of garbage.<eos> The gun was wiped clean, but not the rounds in the magazine.<eos> Check this out.<eos> The prints are a match to Bardot's.<eos> If Bardot loaded it, then he had to have been the one who stole it from the Academy.
As you say, Holy Grail.<eos> - Which is?<eos> - Storage.<eos> Cheap, reliable energy storage.<eos> Imagine how you keep the heat when you don't need it without losing power. Right.
- Which is?<eos> - Storage.<eos> Cheap, reliable energy storage.<eos> Imagine how you keep the heat when you don't need it without losing power. Right.<eos> And you're letting it go when you need it.
It will be quantum trapped. But it can still move freely.<eos> It will never stop.<eos> No friction, no loss of energy.<eos> This material can conduct electricity.<eos> With this we can transport energy freely, we can store it and use it when we want it, without loss.
You've drained us completely.<eos> - That was never our intention.<eos> - I should drag you into court.<eos> You have no legal right to the business.<eos> You sold it to us.
I wanted to give you the latest on what the lab has found. The evidence collected is far from normal.<eos> Okay, well, why don't you show me what you got?<eos> Cam finished her analysis of the flesh.<eos> It wasn't desiccated due to environmental factors.<eos> It was because the killer removed the skin, soaked it, and then scraped away the fat.
I'll run a tox screen.<eos> Ms. Warren, what do you see regarding the surgical rod in the victim's right femur?<eos> Remodeling?<eos> I'm referring to the rod itself.<eos> There are no nails to hold it in place.
Not be frightened of it.<eos> Make it flesh and blood. Bring it to life.<eos> Your uncle, Edward VIII, threatened to do just that, impose his individuality on the institution.<eos> Bring it to life!<eos> And he almost destroyed it in the process!
_ _<eos> Machk!<eos> Why go to Malcolm Brown?<eos> This is exactly the kind of reckless move that got Samoset killed.<eos> Mind your tongue or I will cut it out.
That lead on the witness paid off-- he's giving Marcus a statement right now.<eos> After this, we'll have him sit down with a sketch artist.<eos> Where are you?<eos> I've returned to Lily Cooper's office at the halfway house. Oh.<eos> So once we have a sketch, I'll forward it to you.
Yous owe huge.<eos> Paybacks time.<eos> I got ways for to get you dead."<eos> It was sent by a blocked number.<eos> I'll see if Vikram can trace it.
I'll see you again.<eos> Listen to me.<eos> If there's even a fraction of you that cares about me, your brother, your family, then you will not walk out that door.<eos> Save a good bottle of that bourbon for me, brother.<eos> We're gonna need it to sort all this out in about 60 years.
Erik.<eos> Jan says that you've agreed to share them in three equal piles.<eos> So you have 5 million each. But if you want to buy more than an ice cream without being taxed on it, then you need to launder the money.<eos> What we do is have you start your own place.<eos> We could call it Bimse's Dented Cars.
I've heard rumors about that you aren't as good an investment as you say.<eos> Are you considering pulling your investment?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Maybe.<eos> Reducing it, anyway.
Look at that-- you shaved it all.<eos> You're welcome.<eos> Um, question-- this is my first hot tub-- is it supposed to come with a rat flopping around in it?<eos> Ew, really?<eos> Get it out.
What will you make me realize?<eos> That they see me.<eos> What's so funny?<eos> We started a movement.<eos> We were meant to lead it.
It's not far from here.<eos> Do you want the address?<eos> Thanks.<eos> That's nice of you.<eos> I'll write it down for you.
I fixed everything we talked about. The underbody was given a little TLC.<eos> - Is that going to be much extra?<eos> - No. That's part of the service.<eos> I think we'll send a bill for the total when I've done the other wagons.<eos> Send it right away.
It's like 440 million kroner.<eos> It would be beneficial to get it out of the way.<eos> So what are you suggesting?<eos> We invest in a startup business with the amount that we need.<eos> Then we let the company pay back the money, and we shut it down and let the amount leak out through other expenses.
Nevertheless, that don't change what's been done to you.<eos> The person who did this will get proportionate retribution.<eos> On that tip, I still need you to fix this thing for me.<eos> Our site's been down way too long.<eos> Good news is, once you bring it back up, you will get your money, and, in time, God willing, your health.
Asking for help was never Darlene's strong suit.<eos> But then again, is it anyone's?<eos> An admission of weakness.<eos> But you can't avoid the simple truth.<eos> The only way to patch a vulnerability is by exposing it first.
Annihilation is always the answer.<eos> We destroy parts of ourselves every day.<eos> We Photoshop our warts away.<eos> We edit the parts we hate about ourselves, modify the parts we think people hate.<eos> We curate our identity, carve it, distill it.
We need that gun.<eos> And I'm talking to my truck.<eos> Good news:<eos> she took the bait.<eos> She'll fetch it for us.
- Good one.<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> Is that Wyatt's gun?<eos> You knew where it was this whole time? !<eos> Yeah, I was 12. Panicked, I threw it away.
I ain't seen a Buntline Special in years.<eos> May I?<eos> You may not.<eos> I do reckon I know that gun.<eos> Wyatt Earp christened it "Peacemaker."
I have no idea.<eos> Silence.<eos> Silence.<eos> How'd you know the answer?<eos> I, uh...read it.
I know. I know.<eos> Everyone in life has a story.<eos> Hers... is very short story.<eos> Put the girl in that crate.<eos> Seal it up and see the custom man.
Get this bride of yours squared away, huh?<eos> You have a gun.<eos> It's for my job.<eos> Yeah, but you have one.<eos> Yeah, and I try not to use it.
They scooped him out with that... That big hook.<eos> You know, the big blue hook.<eos> And there was all blood in the water.<eos> Me and my brother, we were really scared, right?<eos> So from then on, when we were supposed to go to class, we... we'd skip it.
Huh?<eos> You killed Bill Primm?<eos> I-I got your cut put aside...<eos> A million dollars.<eos> You earned it.
"When you see a good move... look for a better one."<eos> Elliot.<eos> Be careful.<eos> When I completed the migration, I also took it upon myself to open the site to more than just TOR traffic. Stay right here and don't move.<eos> Just had to index it on a few search engines and with the added touch of adverts on the top advertising sites, and now it's accessible to any average scumbag that Googles "Thai girls for sale."
This mess with the economy is affecting the prison budgets too.<eos> You got lucky.<eos> Don't squander it.<eos> That card's worthless out there now.<eos> You want it for sentimental value, or should I toss it?
You got lucky.<eos> Don't squander it.<eos> That card's worthless out there now.<eos> You want it for sentimental value, or should I toss it?<eos> Toss it.
Mark's hacker friend managed to extract information from that card we found in the old guy's garden.<eos> - From a Premier Lodge?<eos> - Yes.<eos> And it retains information until it's reprogrammed.<eos> I've got the name of the last person who used it.
Before you moved in with the Callaghans, where were you living?<eos> With friends.<eos> And then at some cheap hotel.<eos> What did you do with the key card of your hotel room?<eos> I think I put it in a bowl on the counter.
And then at some cheap hotel.<eos> What did you do with the key card of your hotel room?<eos> I think I put it in a bowl on the counter.<eos> - Why?<eos> - You didn't take it with you.
I think I put it in a bowl on the counter.<eos> - Why?<eos> - You didn't take it with you.<eos> I just said.<eos> - I put it in a bowl on the counter.
- You didn't take it with you.<eos> I just said.<eos> - I put it in a bowl on the counter.<eos> - No.<eos> You said you thought you put it in a bowl on the counter.
We need to remake the front page.<eos> I want a new lead story. Title it...<eos> "Rebel Rabble Routed at Monmouth;<eos> Washington Left Reeling."<eos> Strip out the first column. Replace it with advertisement.
You find anything?<eos> I understand, Dean.<eos> Is that right?<eos> The longing in your heart --<eos> I feel it, too.
Yes, who does that?<eos> Who puts a schedule up for their family?<eos> Uh, don't go in there.<eos> I need to get my vanishing cream.<eos> I can't find it.
But not everyone would be.<eos> You should put that beauty in your garage.<eos> - I don't have one.<eos> - Oh, really?<eos> Just out of curiosity, do you not have a garage because you converted it into the guesthouse where your grandson's currently showering?
Well, I thought she did.<eos> And I lost myself.<eos> Yeah, the pain was, um... it was very intense, so I began to self-medicate, and then my work began to suffer, and I-I made these small mistakes.<eos> Small errors at first, and then much larger ones.<eos> And eventually my own ineptitude was so apparent that... I couldn't deny it.
Hear, hear.<eos> Now, I believe that Major Burd has something that he would like to... Neddy?<eos> A message for you from camp, sir.<eos> I'll see to it after dinner.<eos> It came with a note from General Washington, sir. He expressed that you were to read it immediately.
Islamists give them to their kids.<eos> Other dolls are forbidden.<eos> They offend God's image.<eos> So...?<eos> Your kids brought it to school.
I'm not a killer. It propelled him forward into the bookshelf, disrupting its balance and causing it to fall onto him.<eos> I-It was an accident.<eos> I had to give a presentation for the astronomy fellowship.<eos> Scott took my meds, and I had a panic attack.<eos> That fellowship meant everything to me, and I lost it because of him.
Now, I have it on very good authority that you have taken up with the major again.<eos> We're not together, I swear.<eos> Don't try to play me.<eos> I have seen your acting.<eos> Either you're going to help me to give the major his comeuppance or you're going to get it.
No.<eos> Oh... Where is that coming from?<eos> Go on, Pinky, get out of here.<eos> I got a wallet.<eos> Let's dust it for prints and see what we get.
Take a look at this.<eos> Look at the mantel.<eos> The hourglass.<eos> Yeah, it isn't in the Christmas photo which was only taken a couple months earlier.<eos> Could be a recent purchase or they might have moved it there from some other place in the house.
The hourglass.<eos> Yeah, it isn't in the Christmas photo which was only taken a couple months earlier.<eos> Could be a recent purchase or they might have moved it there from some other place in the house.<eos> Except we know the unsub spends an hour at each crime scene.<eos> What if he brought it with him as a kind of timer? I'll have Sgt. Whitfield search the Zumwalt house for a similar hourglass.
- It's all right. - The next president.<eos> - You wanted the gun stay in the bunker of Men of Letters, right?<eos> I came from there.<eos> That's how he knew where to find you, its communication with Henshaw.<eos> If you open the way, I can get it for you.
The newest casualty being Deputy Director Jemma Moore.<eos> - What is this?<eos> - That is why we are here.<eos> We'll need access to every file, folder, and Post-it note in this facility.<eos> Where there's a paper trail, there's Thomas Shaw to light it on fire and burn us alive.
Robert, the confession by the girls ties them to Iosava, then we allow the Germans to come in and make the arrest.<eos> That's if the Germans cooperate.<eos> Valerie?<eos> It's your op.<eos> Don't drag me in here and ask my opinion only to completely disregard it.
On our wedding night, he, uh... he got real tense.<eos> Didn't wanna kiss me.<eos> He just asked me to close my eyes.<eos> So I did.<eos> And then he took my hand, and he put it on himself.
She belongs to me.<eos> Now, if you try to breach that bond, then... Then there will be consequences.<eos> For the both of you.<eos> - How's your clothespin?<eos> What, are you wearing it right now?
Lee, I just broke your lamp.<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> - I'll help you.<eos> That's fine, that's fine. Just...<eos> No, I knocked it with my arm.
Everything all right?<eos> - No, it's not.<eos> - What's wrong?<eos> - I want my necklace.<eos> Mom said I could have it back.
Look, Danny didn't threaten me, okay?<eos> You thought he was dangerous, but you're wrong.<eos> Listen to me, there are things that you can't understand.<eos> I don't care what bullshit happened between you guys, but he's my uncle and that's the only present he ever gave me.<eos> I want it back.
Where the fuck you at?<eos> You wanna call me back and tell me what the fuck is going on?<eos> Okay.<eos> Bye.<eos> The shower's been leaking for a year, and I can't seem to get anybody to fix it.
Oh, no.<eos> It was a seahorse.<eos> - A seahorse.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I was just looking for it the other day.
-Your house is that way, Kirk.<eos> -I did not get lost again.<eos> I wanted you to know that I've started a new business.<eos> It's a ride share business.<eos> I call it Ööö-ber.
Eduardo can make you a coffee.<eos> -How? Is Eduardo magic?<eos> -He makes a stovetop version--<eos> -Eh, eh. -It really is--<eos> -Eh, eh, eh, eh. -I can move it back.
She back from London?<eos> She was, but she's there now.<eos> -Hard to keep track of our girl, huh? -Yeah. Okay.<eos> So, it's pretty cut and dry here.<eos> We plant an egg in a viable body, we fertilize it and out comes a baby.
Let's put it that way.<eos> I had this notion that somehow my extensive familiarity with Nick Cave, and Radiohead, and a smattering of Stravinsky destined me for success.<eos> So I'll never forget the day that I realized my composition class required composing.<eos> But I did it.<eos> I composed the melody, I added the harmonies, I drew those treble and bass clefs, I wrote those whole notes, those half notes, those quarter notes, those rest stops, and... while you'll never witness a public performance of my composition... because of that experience, I can see music when I hear it.

I waited for him to yell at me, to punish me, to ground me forever, to tell me how disappointed he was in me.<eos> And nothing came.<eos> And finally, I got up enough courage... to look up at him, and he was standing there... with a pretzel.<eos> A giant pretzel covered with mustard.<eos> And he handed it to me and he said, "Let's go."
I'll go to your nutty therapist.<eos> I'll open up a franchise if that's who you want me to be, I'll run the kitchen at your inn.<eos> I'll give you back the entire closet.<eos> I only took that half because you insisted I do it.<eos> I just figured you would take it back eventually, anyhow.
Just like in real life.<eos> There's your house and Jeep, and that's the hospital where you took me the day we met.<eos> Oh, my God, is that...<eos> - My finger tip.<eos> - Aw! You scooped it up and threw it in your purse.
Oh, my God, is that...<eos> - My finger tip.<eos> - Aw! You scooped it up and threw it in your purse.<eos> That was a brand new purse, FYI.<eos> We went to the hospital and the doctor sewed it back on.
- My finger tip.<eos> - Aw! You scooped it up and threw it in your purse.<eos> That was a brand new purse, FYI.<eos> We went to the hospital and the doctor sewed it back on.<eos> And you cut it right off again two days later.
You want to talk about the blood, well, my heart, it has been bleeding for a while.<eos> And I think your voice is the only thing that can save it.<eos> I fell in love with your voice the first time I heard it.<eos> I was 13 years old.<eos> Maestro Rivera brought it.
I fell in love with your voice the first time I heard it.<eos> I was 13 years old.<eos> Maestro Rivera brought it.<eos> And it was you in "Tosca."<eos> I heard it over and over again.
Marcus?<eos> Hey, I thought you guys would want to know Vincent Bader's body turned up.<eos> The M.E. is taking a look right now.<eos> The body was found wrapped in tarp and tied with rope.<eos> A couple spotted it off a path in Forest Park.
What do you care?<eos> You get your fortune, you get your hero's welcome.<eos> All I want is her.<eos> Well, you want what I already have. What I've been having for months now.<eos> And her name's not Shippen, it's Arnold.
He said that if I didn't watch over Robeson, he would reveal that I had been with Anna Strong.<eos> That if I ever betrayed him, the death of my son would be the last thing that I ever saw. All right? That is what he does.<eos> He finds out everything about you, your secrets and your shame, and he ties it around your neck like a noose and he chokes you.<eos> I thought I had heard your last lie, but that was quite impressive.<eos> No, I can prove it to you! I have proof. I'll show you.
They figured out how to get around the bedrock!<eos> Hey, sis!<eos> Starting again, isn't it?<eos> We need that gun!<eos> Wyatt Earp christened it Peacemaker.
- Like hell I will!<eos> - Wynonna, get the gun!<eos> - Wh-what? !<eos> What gun?<eos> Bossman said I'd never take it from you.
What gun?<eos> Bossman said I'd never take it from you.<eos> Can't wait to prove him wrong.<eos> No!<eos> Get it off!
Bossman said I'd never take it from you.<eos> Can't wait to prove him wrong.<eos> No!<eos> Get it off!<eos> Get it off!
- This time, you're the law, and innocent people are depending on you.<eos> - Now, your gun. - What?<eos> !<eos> They're not gonna let you in there with it.<eos> I'll get it back to you, Earp.
May I?<eos> Come on.<eos> I'm not gonna do it here, I promise.<eos> First, I'd swing by Home Depot.<eos> Pick up a nice, polyethylene plastic sheet, lay it out nice and neat so as not to make a mess.
You okay?<eos> Yeah.<eos> All right.<eos> We're gonna get you home, okay? Hold it.<eos> If you know where my product is, go get it right now.
[Claire] Oh, boy.<eos> Close the restaurant.<eos> I'm sorry, I just...<eos> I saw the fire and I wanted to help...<eos> If the pan's on fire, just cover it.
Xavier.<eos> Oh, well, we'll just stick to what we know, then.<eos> You ever notice that we get some pretty high winds here in Purgatory?<eos> You ever notice that weathervane in the town square always points West?<eos> Took it down, oiled it myself. Works fine, any direction.
No, not a joke.<eos> I really think I may have found a body.<eos> What do you mean you may have found? Oh, man...<eos> Is it a body or not?<eos> I don't want to look at it again.
Now I know how she feels.<eos> Pretty awful, huh?<eos> Looks like this guy took a bath in toxic waste.<eos> Well, what the killer actually used was muriatic acid.<eos> Local PD was smart enough to neutralize it with baking soda.
If you had a problem, you could prevent an outbreak just with the push of a button.<eos> - Genocide.<eos> Mass murder.<eos> - That was the Army, that wasn't us.<eos> Once they had the tech, they wanted to use it.
Previouslyon the vampire diaries...<eos> The Phoenix stone isstuffedfull ofvampiresouls.<eos> Thestonegives thesworditspower.<eos> As long as i have this scar,<eos> Rayna will hunt me. What if I were to tell you there's a way for me to transfer it to somebody a little bit more deserving?
- Oh, my God. My God.<eos> - [laughs]<eos> - Where'd the tart come from?<eos> - Preserved lemon.<eos> - Val added it to the braised rabbit. - Mmm!
Yep.<eos> Why are you printing out an evidence inventory?<eos> Well, I couldn't find pictures of the alley from the night of the shooting, so I thought I might look through the log and see if somebody might have mislabeled the files.<eos> But the alley wasn't part of the crime scene.<eos> I mean, the police locked it down to do a quick search, but... Ah.
CSRU finished their investigation of the alley. - Okay.<eos> What'd they find?<eos> - Nothing.<eos> Alice's DNA isn't on the fire escape ladder.<eos> There's no smudged fingerprints, like she wiped it down.
- Yeah, that's me, but I... I thought that guy was just trying to grab my ass.<eos> I didn't know he stole my wallet.<eos> What a jerk.<eos> Could you tell us how you happen to have your wallet in your possession in light of this photo?<eos> I-I found it on my welcome mat this morning.
I didn't know he stole my wallet.<eos> What a jerk.<eos> Could you tell us how you happen to have your wallet in your possession in light of this photo?<eos> I-I found it on my welcome mat this morning.<eos> I-I figured I just dropped it coming home.
You guys don't think that I had anything to do with this?<eos> I think that until you can verify your whereabouts, you should probably come with us.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Who doesn't know their wallet was stolen?<eos> And then has it miraculously returned?
Let's go.<eos> Who doesn't know their wallet was stolen?<eos> And then has it miraculously returned?<eos> The zombie girl's story sucks.<eos> It does, but we can't disprove it till we put her at the scene.
- The four wallets from the scene all had the victim's blood on them.<eos> Also, Christine's wallet had the victim's blood on it.<eos> So Christine's wallet was on him when he fell and bled?<eos> Very likely.<eos> Well, then she pulled it out of his pocket and then took off.
Likely rubbed off during contact.<eos> So this wasn't normal zombie makeup?<eos> No. Microskin is expensive.<eos> Application is more involved than regular makeup.<eos> And you can only get it through the manufacturer.

Once she passes the mailbox across the street, leave the duffel on the bench and walk away.<eos> I'll make the drop.<eos> Nobody move until she's got possession of that bag.<eos> She won't take the duffel bag until the car's out of sight.<eos> She's got it. I'm going in.
Yes.<eos> Testing.<eos> Testing, 1, 2, 3.<eos> - 1, 2, 3, testing. - Oh. The new karaoke machine.<eos> Anybody wanna give it a whirl?
I just... I don't know what I would do if I didn't work in the M.E.'s office.<eos> Well, there are always alternatives.<eos> Science and medicine aren't just parts of my job.<eos> They're parts of who I am.<eos> So I don't know who I would be without it.
I had just lost my wife.<eos> I-I couldn't lose my stepdaughter, too.<eos> Exactly what did you do?<eos> Clair and I came up with the story that Michelle fell down the stairs.<eos> I took the murder weapon straight to the storage facility and hid it.
I waited for her to... to come back home and, uh, we...<eos> She had called 9-1-1.<eos> And why hang on to the murder weapon?<eos> I-I didn't know what to do with it.<eos> Didn't have time to destroy it so I just hid it, figured that I'd deal with it later.
And why hang on to the murder weapon?<eos> I-I didn't know what to do with it.<eos> Didn't have time to destroy it so I just hid it, figured that I'd deal with it later.<eos> Is that what you were doing tonight?<eos> I told Clair that I was gonna get rid of it, put this behind us once and for all, but I guess she figured that if you found me with the murder weapon, that you would be convinced
All: Until you perform the autopsy.<eos> Very funny, but true.<eos> What's with the white rose?<eos> Was she carrying that?<eos> No one I interviewed mentioned it.
I'm guessing the bomb isn't in there?<eos> We're not sure there was a bomb.<eos> My team has yet to find a detonator or a casing consistent with any sort of conventional explosive.<eos> - Bag's clean.<eos> CSRU can have it.
I just got the DNA results back from the victim's body.<eos> - Are we any closer to identifying him?<eos> - It's hard to tell, really.<eos> It says here that the sample came from the interior thoracic cage just behind the sternum.<eos> - Because that's where I took it from.
So you think I should put on a tough veneer?<eos> Oh, you have a tough veneer.<eos> Maybe even have tough under veneer.<eos> - Don't talk about my under veneer.<eos> - I'm suggesting you keep it.
- Which is used for what?<eos> - It's an insulation most commonly found in old commercial buildings.<eos> Like the evidence warehouse.<eos> Yeah, except the only place we found it was on the evidence box.<eos> Well, that means that the thief must have left it on the box when he opened it to steal the cutting board.
They're in molt.<eos> They only sprout colorful plumage during mating season.<eos> Let me say what Rihanna should have.<eos> Thank you for helping her get through this really awful time.<eos> She couldn't have gotten through it without you.
Mm, it's hard to say.<eos> But it doesn't rule him out as a shooter?<eos> No, it does not.<eos> All right, well... we will broaden our search for the weapon.<eos> Maybe he tossed it when he was running from the scene.
I'm gonna see three patients today.<eos> Okay.<eos> Good for you.<eos> What's the news?<eos> I don't want to spoil it.
Doesn't mean they know each other.<eos> They might have.<eos> Okay, so, Kate Mason knows Ben Norton and kills him for some reason.<eos> She then asks her brother to help her dispose of his body?<eos> Sam Mason embalms the body to buy time and then ditches it when the next funeral comes their way?
You know, if you move back, I could help you with T.J.<eos> No smothering.<eos> I don't know, Ma.<eos> I'm just putting it out there.<eos> I mean, it's your decision, and I'll respect it.
So are we in agreement?<eos> We have ourselves a deal.<eos> Then the lead is yours.<eos> Bobo already has the lead.<eos> did he lose it?
then wynonna and all bets were off.<eos> So bobo's gonna try again. what's the lead?<eos> That's just it.<eos> He's been obsessed with her i'm...<eos> Willa was right. He had the lead and then he lost it to constance.
The prophecy,<eos> "The Willing Heir on the Winter Solstice with the Revenant of their Choosing..."<eos> Peacemaker.<eos> The heir ain't the heir without the gun.<eos> I have it.
What did you do?<eos> We're almost over the line now.<eos> This one's gonna hurt.<eos> We all used to play here under a poplar tree.<eos> The year she was taken, it got felled by lightning.
What about the chest?<eos> Should we hide the chest?<eos> Why would we hide the chest? There's nothing in it.<eos> Yeah, I know.<eos> But, like, what if they knew my Uncle Felix had it?
Should we hide the chest?<eos> Why would we hide the chest? There's nothing in it.<eos> Yeah, I know.<eos> But, like, what if they knew my Uncle Felix had it?<eos> If they knew my Uncle Felix had it, then they would know he gave it to me.
Why would we hide the chest? There's nothing in it.<eos> Yeah, I know.<eos> But, like, what if they knew my Uncle Felix had it?<eos> If they knew my Uncle Felix had it, then they would know he gave it to me.<eos> And if they knew he gave it to me, then...
He wants what's best for you.<eos> For all of us.<eos> I know. But I...<eos> You asked him for help.<eos> He's giving it to you.
I was starving, did not think about it.<eos> When I realized what I had done, I dropped my food and begged for forgiveness.<eos> What happened?<eos> He smiled and... Held his hand out for me to shake.<eos> When I obliged he took my hand and... slammed it on the table.
If Roman and his men find out you're here, they will kill you.<eos> I'm not going anywhere.<eos> Perhaps you are right, Jeremy.<eos> This sickness has been infecting me for too long.<eos> Maybe it's time to cut it out.
I mean, what is that... three continents in two days?<eos> If you count Berlin.<eos> We were only there three hours.<eos> Yeah, we knew that Inhuman call was a hoax as soon as we stepped foot in the apartment, saw that bong.<eos> - I could smell it from the hallway.
_<eos> _<eos> We just stole a box.<eos> I don't even know what was inside of it.<eos> We loaded it onto an 18-wheeler, we parked it in a warehouse, and we just left it.
Hello. I'm glad to final...<eos> Hello. I'm glad to final...<eos> - What the hell?<eos> - Well, I've just upped her PSU to compensate for image processing.<eos> Must have overcranked it.
I'll tell you what Gwen said about you. Okay.<eos> Hey.<eos> Where are we on the waste-management company?<eos> It's a new entity called Bullseye.<eos> We're not sure who's running it, but rumor is it's a new player on the scene.
Previously on "Bitten"...<eos> None of this will stop as long as Roman is still alive.<eos> You don't have to go after him alone.<eos> It's incredible, a natural-born witch comes to her power at puberty.<eos> - You have it now.
Dr. Saroyan, we are extremely busy.<eos> Is there something we can help you with?<eos> Yes. I finished analyzing the victim's lung tissue and didn't find any trace of trash particulates.<eos> Meaning the victim was dead before coming in contact with the garbage.<eos> And the only reason a dead body ends up in the garbage is when someone's trying to get rid of it.
Eventually, the kid's landlord boxed up all of his belongings, gave 'em to Brandon's dad.<eos> There's, uh, not really much in here.<eos> We got a Dodgeball DVD, uh, some... a couple old magazines, and, uh, oh, yeah-- a whole bunch of burned CDs.<eos> Apparently the victim was a big Linkin Park fan.<eos> Of course, not big enough to actually buy their music, but certainly enough to steal it.
Angie, found the murder weapon.<eos> It's a high-end ice Axe.<eos> Yikes.<eos> Do you know whose it was?<eos> Oh, no, they issued these babies to everyone on the team, but I'm thinking that the killer may have held it like this.
I did my homework, Dr. Hodgins.<eos> I know you would have looked into the evidence and understood that government forces are thwarting my investigation.<eos> I did look into the evidence.<eos> I also read everything I could about the body you found in France, the "scout" from the last heist, but nothing gave me cause of death.<eos> Well, that's because we could not determine it.
No, but no more ghosts either.<eos> Well, I guess we'll never know.<eos> You know, I wouldn't have believed it either, and then after Lance died, I saw him, and he was telling me to move on.<eos> And it really helped, so I wasn't trying to be funny or flip, I just...<eos> if someone's trying to give you a message, I don't want you to miss it.
It's something that I should have given you a long time ago that is gonna keep you close to Papa forever.<eos> Oh! Lily, we were gonna open Grams' gifts together!<eos> I couldn't wait.<eos> Grams left you a watch. Oh!<eos> The note says, "Your grandpa tore it right off of a dead kraut's wrist."
But she's the Buttafuoco's lover.<eos> Why does the lover shoot the wife?<eos> Maybe you should change the story.<eos> Yeah, man.<eos> Uh, I never-- I hadn't thought about changing it because it-- well, you know it's actually based on a real thing that happened--
Hey, do you know where...<eos> What?<eos> W-- what's the matter?<eos> The hell were you thinking?<eos> Leaving his body where it could be found.
He's funny around new people.<eos> - Follow my lead.<eos> - OK. - You know what I call a woman's vagina?<eos> - Tell me.<eos> I call it a Happy Meal.
That's all she sold me.<eos> Yeah, it's Carol Fincher's.<eos> This, Harper's.<eos> Benjamin Williams's watch.<eos> Brother recognizes it and the inscription confirms it.
Now, who's the biggest guy in the yard?<eos> It's highly unlikely that he'll just come out to play, but it's like my younger brother always said:<eos> "Don't fish without bait."<eos> Thank you all for coming.<eos> With all that ails our city, I think it's fair to ask why we would spend time and money to honor anyone, why we would commission a statue and have a ceremony to unveil it.
That's never gonna happen.<eos> The you I know from the future, he's not this stupid.<eos> Pretty soon, you won't even remember that you're The Flash.<eos> And when that happens, this world will become permanent.<eos> Time will set like concrete, and nothing will be able to change it back to the way it was.
"hey, you're a regular Einstein."<eos> They'll say, "you're like one of the einsteins."<eos> - That's so crazy.<eos> I can't believe we just changed history.<eos> - No, Dr. Heywood, we saved it.
March 23, 1972, you walked out of a movie theater --<eos> "Slaughterhouse-Five."<eos> You loved it, and you bumped into a big Marine and you knocked him flat on his ass.<eos> You were embarrassed, and he laughed it off, said you could make it up to him with a cup of coffee.<eos> So, you went to, uh, Mulroney's and you talked and he was cute and he knew the words to every Zeppelin song, so when he asked you for your number, you gave it to him, even though you knew your dad would be pissed.
You're just bad at your job.<eos> Yeah, and you're better?<eos> So much better.<eos> You drive back roads, catching cases at random.<eos> You get word a body's dropped, you check it out, and maybe you even kill the thing that did it.
I need you to bring me something in return.<eos> I need the file from December 7, 2010, code name "Antoinette."<eos> You kidding me?<eos> A woman's life is on the line, you're asking me to steal you a fucking file?<eos> Bring it to me before noon today. Fuck that!
It's not fine, 'cause it's not the truth.<eos> It's not reality.<eos> The reality of what's happening right here between you and me with that is that I'm doing you a fucking solid.<eos> This station is a disaster.<eos> I'm doing everything I can to hold it together.
No.<eos> No, that is not an option. Do you hear me?<eos> I love you.<eos> But this, this is my choice.<eos> And I've already made it.
They're three years old.<eos> They shouldn't be involved in this world. Not yet.<eos> Lizzie siphoned me the other day.<eos> The girls had their friend's birthday party, and Lizzie took Josie's goodie bag.<eos> I took it back from her and then she grabbed my arm.
Do you really think that I did the right thing by taking Caroline against her will?<eos> One hundred percent.<eos> You said that's how you know you love someone.<eos> And for a second there, I actually, I actually believed you.<eos> I thought that my love for Caroline was so strong that I would do anything to protect it.
Damon actually did the right thing.<eos> The selfless thing.<eos> We waited in that room for days.<eos> Stefan didn't sleep.<eos> Throwing everything, including himself, at that door, trying to get it open.
But we can track her vehicle from our office.<eos> ♪ If I don't get me some shelter ♪ Oh! Oh, this!<eos> This is what I was talking about.<eos> "Chapter 10 -- Why I Never Answer Prayers, and You Should Be Glad I Don't."<eos> And chapter 11 -- "The Truth About Divine intervention and Why I Avoid It at All Costs."
You created worlds.<eos> I was stupid.<eos> Naive. I thought if I could show my sister that there was something more than just us, something better than us, then maybe she'd change.<eos> Maybe she'd stop... being...her.<eos> But... every time I'd build a new world... she'd destroy it.
- It looks like the sun is --<eos> - Dying.<eos> Why would Amara do that?<eos> The sun is the source of all life on earth.<eos> Without it, everything just... just wastes away.
What's that smell?<eos> I don't know, clean?<eos> Look, they gave us a bottle of wine.<eos> Don't touch that.<eos> Sometimes they charge you just for moving it.
Yeah, that's my middle name.<eos> Jameson "Rooster" "Behave" "Big Dick" Bennett.<eos> Man, I'm exhausted.<eos> Yeah, me too.<eos> If somebody told me there was a million dollars out in that field, I don't know if I could go pick it up.
What the hell are you doing? !<eos> You're 100 yards from a police station.<eos> I'll be back in an hour or two.<eos> We had a deal.<eos> If there's a story, I'll make sure you get it.
Your body is beginning to reject the changes we made to your DNA.<eos> You feel it every time you use... your ability.<eos> How do I fix it?<eos> Stop using the power.<eos> Every time you use it, new cells are activated, and your body rejects them.
They've hidden him somewhere secret.<eos> Him fixing me is just the beginning.<eos> I want an army.<eos> I want an army like me!<eos> And he is going to give it to me.
Yeah, they will.<eos> Mitch will.<eos> Mitch?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Well, you sure are putting a lot of stock in this Mitch guy if you think he's gonna spot your little rock message, know that it was you who left it, make his way all the way to Caraquet.
Just like you taught me.<eos> Someone in our organization leaked my prison visit.<eos> It's the only way the Asians could have set the hit.<eos> I'll find the rat.<eos> Squash it.
Habib.<eos> Hi, Patrick.<eos> Chef, a word, please.<eos> It's cool, it's cool.<eos> My product... I need it back.
Go get it for me now.<eos> Right.<eos> I don't have access to it tonight.<eos> Look, but it's... it's in a secure place, I promise.<eos> Look, I-I-I'll get it.
I don't have access to it tonight.<eos> Look, but it's... it's in a secure place, I promise.<eos> Look, I-I-I'll get it.<eos> It's not a problem.<eos> I'll have it for you, I swear to God.
I had to open hostilities somehow.<eos> You acted too soon.<eos> Another month and Marseille would have been yours.<eos> That would have been too easy.<eos> If I give you the power will you turn it down?
- Did he say why? When he came to say goodbye, I knew something was wrong.<eos> I gave him this little frog for good luck.<eos> Who killed him?<eos> Before leaving, Dan hid a bag here.<eos> He said if he won't be back by July the 1st, I should give it to the police. Sir...
Who killed him?<eos> Before leaving, Dan hid a bag here.<eos> He said if he won't be back by July the 1st, I should give it to the police. Sir...<eos> I am police.<eos> Alright, I'll get it.
Hi, Acke.<eos> How are you today? -<eos> - Fine.<eos> I got pizza.<eos> Warm it up in the oven at 225 degrees when you're hungry...
Maybe corporate sponsorship is the way to go.<eos> Come on.<eos> [scoffs] Oh, come on.<eos> [Andre] Sorry about your mural.<eos> - I didn't mean to mess it up.
Come on.<eos> [scoffs] Oh, come on.<eos> [Andre] Sorry about your mural.<eos> - I didn't mean to mess it up.<eos> Well, that's not what I'm hearing from the kids who saw you intentionally destroy it.
Tommy, I'll be back later, huh?<eos> Great news, Herrera. You go, P.!<eos> You know, out of all the incredible things you did for me last night, I can't stop thinking about the flower you brought me.<eos> Great.<eos> I'm glad you liked it.
Great news, Herrera. You go, P.!<eos> You know, out of all the incredible things you did for me last night, I can't stop thinking about the flower you brought me.<eos> Great.<eos> I'm glad you liked it.<eos> Yeah, I liked it.
Hey, what are the damn specials?<eos> Aw, dude, really?<eos> Look-- now? I put the list in your wine room this morning.<eos> I know.<eos> I saw it, but I- - I just--
Who hopefully are gonna find me.<eos> By the looks of it, I'm gonna say we're on the island of... Honshu, in the vicinity of Kyoto?<eos> Yes.<eos> How did you learn to speak my language?<eos> I studied it for many years.
- Masako.<eos> That's a pretty name.<eos> The Shogun asked you a question.<eos> Where did you find your armor?<eos> I made it.
Kill them.<eos> Your form is all wrong.<eos> I ordered Ichiro to destroy that blade after the death of his son.<eos> Very well.<eos> I will destroy it myself.
And he's waiting for me at home.<eos> I have ameliorated Mr. Rice's injuries.<eos> That's incredible.<eos> A word of advice from an old man who's lived long enough to see the world change, and mostly for the better:<eos> If you are lucky enough to find love again... Embrace it.
But what happens when a man like him inherits abilities like yours?<eos> We have seen it happen on countless other worlds, which is why we must exterminate your kind before the scourge of your planet becomes the scourge of ours.<eos> Well, he's out of his giant mind.<eos> What if he's right?<eos> What if, in using our powers to make the world better, we actually end up destroying it?
Let it go, kid.<eos> There's nothing you can do about the speedsters.<eos> We'll see about that.<eos> Long story short, Rip had a secret armory.<eos> Me and Grey found it alongside future Barry's message about the oncoming war.
Let's get you to the lab.<eos> What's this?<eos> It's to test how your ability affects molecular motion.<eos> That shaft is solid tungsten, and it's heated to over 2,000 degrees centigrade.<eos> I want you to cool it down, and when we determine how you can do that, we can figure out the best way to help you.
Car alarms, transformers.<eos> What is the connection?<eos> Yeah, we'll get there, fellas. We'll get there.<eos> We just got to keep trying.<eos> Maybe someone's pulling power out of the transformers and using it to power the monster.
Get a fresh start.<eos> Well, what about your résumé as a world-renowned genius scientist?<eos> That's a good point.<eos> I guess we're even.<eos> If a string is in a knot, patience will untie it.
Who you are.<eos> He knows you're Oliver Queen.<eos> Should have been out there with you tonight, Oliver.<eos> Dig, you said you needed time.<eos> Don't be afraid to take it, and tonight would not have made any difference.
Is that on the record?<eos> If you want to get an actual quote, Ms. Williams, you can go through all the proper channels.<eos> This meeting is strictly about the rezoning ordinance.<eos> Yes. Councilman, as you know, I ran on a platform of unity, but it is difficult for a city to be united when so much of the zoning within it remains exclusionary.<eos> We need to open it up, allow for more affordable housing, give the people a chance to start over and rebuild, but... the second the money starts rolling in, those families get squeezed out by crony capitalists.
Uh, Branson's got a new poll in the field as of last week, and our approval ratings are up but not as much as I would like.<eos> Are you ok?<eos> No, not even close.<eos> Did--did you fall off the wagon?<eos> Well, to do that, I'd have to be on it.
Keep your guns down.<eos> So then you can just shoot me?<eos> We're on the same side.<eos> You're out of control.<eos> This city is out of control, and you haven't been able to save it.
So, if, uh, you'll excuse me, I have a class to teach.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> Dad, what are you thinking?<eos> Lars found the lamp, and, clearly, he rubbed it, but that makes him the genie's master, right?
- Thank you.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> Dad, what are you thinking?<eos> Lars found the lamp, and, clearly, he rubbed it, but that makes him the genie's master, right?<eos> But if no one has rubbed the lamp since and I were to discover it... then that would make me the genie's new master.
You need to call me the next time you see her so I can question her.<eos> I got to come up with a wish list.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> I have so many!<eos> How am I gonna whittle it down to three?
And you're gonna tell us everything you know.<eos> Come on!<eos> By the time we put a net over the neighborhood, the truck and the treasure were gone, and because you didn't get a license plate, we have little chance of finding them.<eos> It all happened so fast.<eos> Oh, right, and yet you did have time to "creep over to the lamp, examine it, get held at gunpoint, rub the lamp, make a wish upon the lamp, and have a genie appear
Shit.<eos> Don't move, asshole.<eos> - Take off that mask.<eos> - No.<eos> Take it off or you're dead.
[Donna] Just please put the gun down.<eos> You have to trust me.<eos> Put down the weapon.<eos> Okay.<eos> I put it down.
You don't know him!<eos> You don't know what he's like!<eos> Dr. Monaghan, you say that you trust this guy.<eos> How well do you really know him?<eos> Because I thought that I knew my commanding officer, but he had all the power, and he used it against me.
They aren't that close.<eos> Who's always comforting him when he's upset?<eos> Penny, but...<eos> Who's the only one who can make him take his medicine when he's sick?<eos> I try to hide it in his peanut butter, but he spits it out.
If you had to.<eos> In fact, I'd like you to rank them in the order in which you'd be willing to eat them.<eos> Listen to your gut.<eos> My gut is telling me very loudly not to play this game.<eos> I guess I could cut the mold off the crabapple, wash it really well, and technically... the cockroach is edible, if I cook it...
Okay, then.<eos> Geez, how much wine did you drink? Not a lot.<eos> I just couldn't start until you walked away.<eos> The Hell Prawn lunges out of the hot spring!<eos> You block it with your shield.
Taro is standing again.<eos> What's that got to do with me?<eos> Taro's too old for Marseille.<eos> He doesn't understand this city.<eos> He wants to bulldoze it.
I don't know what to say.<eos> How are you feeling?<eos> I'm okay.<eos> I have pins and needles in my hand.<eos> Sometimes I can't even control it.
If this continues to spread, hundreds of thousands of people will starve.<eos> And you think that an animal is behind this glass?<eos> Well, it's not plant-based.<eos> And given your work connecting mutated animals to environmental events...<eos> If there is a connection, we'll find it.
This... is what Jackson's DNA looks like.<eos> The mutation has caused it to develop a third strand.<eos> A Triple-Helix?<eos> And this structure isn't unique to just Jackson.<eos> He shares it with the vultures, the ants, the sloth,
Okay?<eos> Let's go, Edwards.<eos> Apparently, you got my text.<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> I got it good.
I got it good.<eos> Obviously it was not meant for you.<eos> I hope not, because it sounds so painful.<eos> It was very unprofessional, and I should have been more careful.<eos> Edwards, you really should save your energy, because you're gonna need it.
I've had one for a long time.<eos> - You have a gun.<eos> Why?<eos> Just like you said... for protection.<eos> Have you used it?
What?<eos> Did you leave your phone charger in the car or... were you texting or was it the TV?<eos> No!<eos> The police already asked me all this.<eos> Yeah, why were you gone long enough for them to unlock a drawer or a closet or whatever and pull out a gun and shoot it?
Didn't even notice was there.<eos> I wanna know where it is.<eos> It's in a box under the bed.<eos> It's under our bed?<eos> ! That's where we'd need it.
So, please, do my family a favor and get the hell out of here.<eos> Thank you, Dr. Edwards.<eos> That will be all.<eos> So, it's a basic decortication procedure, except there is a slight abnormality.<eos> Yeah, sorry, I can't take your decortication procedure 'cause I already took it.
The point is, we grew up.<eos> Mer and I are grown up.<eos> We got through it.<eos> And hell is behind me.<eos> It's in my rearview mirror, and I'm not going back.
Car's coming up now. You've got quite an entourage these days. Is everything all right?<eos> No, Allison, it's not.<eos> I asked you to get me competitive bids on all the projects that Emil Kurtz was working on.<eos> I still don't have that report.<eos> I'll have it for you in the morning.
The report we read didn't mention anything about a propellant.<eos> Probably because it burned up in the explosion.<eos> Most do. But I now believe it was a chemical commonly used in pesticides called nitroguanidine.<eos> One of the characteristics of nitroguanidine is a tendency to corrode metal, as well as a very distinctive smell like latex paint.<eos> The condition of this belt buckle suggests that Krasnov is responsible not only for planting the device, but for building it as well.
- No.<eos> Shh.<eos> The couch we bought.<eos> Yeah, what about it?<eos> Do you want it or...
Yeah, what about it?<eos> Do you want it or...<eos> - Cum inside me.<eos> - No, it's fine.<eos> - You can just keep it.
-Lock the door behind me.<eos> -Ren.<eos> Ren, don't go.<eos> This door is reinforced.<eos> It would take ZMPs to break it down.
Torus executives...<eos> Man, why you always gotta listen to this propaganda, huh?<eos> Know thy enemy, my brother.<eos> Yeah, well, the Pope tells it like it really is.<eos> Those who can't remember the past are condemned to repeat it.

Torus executives accuse the Arctic Parallel of providing a safe haven for Bloc leaders.<eos> Man, why you always gotta listen to this propaganda?<eos> Know thy enemy, my brother.<eos> Yeah, well, the Pope tells it like it really is.<eos> Those who can't remember the past are condemned to repeat it.
- It's Olympic size.<eos> That's a lot of agua.<eos> Or the laundromat?<eos> Maybe he just needs to wash his creepy mask.<eos> He's always wearing it.
Like you did.<eos> After this problem is settle, a new world will be born.<eos> It will be just like I want it.<eos> Where is the financial report?<eos> If you let me go with the children, I'll give it to you.
- But...<eos> I know you do.<eos> - I know you do.<eos> - But I still would not pay $1000 for that shitty bottle of wine.<eos> - We're drinking it.
Even now, caught red-handed, and you still can't admit it.<eos> No, that would be you.<eos> You broke into my place.<eos> So if you can't be nice, Valerie, you know where the door is.<eos> Use it.
Didn't mommy tell you?<eos> Don't rub your eyes.<eos> What happen if the germs go into your eyes?<eos> Don't play with this doll now.<eos> You play after I wash it clean for you.
Listen to me, go back quick!<eos> Meng Meng, Mommy will be back soon.<eos> Mommy, pizza is here.<eos> Can I open the door for him?<eos> I just ordered it.
Then we have nothing to link her to the beach murder.<eos> No... and if she didn't kill Wendt... -<eos> - We got no murderer for both cases.<eos> There's something about that mark...<eos> Maybe you seen it before?
Not above them, or around them, into their center.<eos> Are you asleep, Jim?<eos> Yes.<eos> Show me.<eos> Take out your gun and put it on the ground.
Then give me something to fight this until I find him.<eos> There's usually a trigger that brings on the hypnotic state.<eos> What's the last thing you remember?<eos> He pulled out his watch.<eos> Asked if I could hear it ticking. That's it, then.
There he is, the man of the hour.<eos> I have a surprise for you, Butch.<eos> Not in the mood.<eos> What's in the box?<eos> Open it.
- Trixie's best friend Landa got a new<eos> All-American doll, and now Trixie wants one.<eos> So what does she do?<eos> She destroys her old doll,<eos> - expecting me to replace it. - Mm, impressive.
You think everything I say is a metaphor.<eos> Now if you don't mind, you're killing my buzz.<eos> Ladies.<eos> Well, if you change your mind, my door is always open.<eos> Well, feel free to shut it.
What, do you want my help getting a 2,000-pound bomb past them?<eos> Not the bomb, just some of the explosive material inside.<eos> Getting past them is going to be easy.<eos> You got to be kidding me.<eos> The Pons plan to dispose of it tomorrow.
Gallo, Gallo... you're like a brother to me.<eos> But physically, you're like a little brother.<eos> You don't think so?<eos> All right, grab that tangerine.<eos> Throw it at my junk.
I had Jerry draw up a new draft of the papers.<eos> Evidently, the old one... had too many curse words scrawled in the margins.<eos> You're okay with that?<eos> Rooster is, and that's what's important.<eos> He cared enough about this ranch that he sacrificed his piece to keep it in the family.
You just said he planted the same kind of device.<eos> And with very good reason.<eos> One I'm not inclined to disclose at the moment.<eos> Have it your way.<eos> If I had a white flag, I would wave it.
Who said you have a choice?<eos> We can expose you to the Iranian government.<eos> Mr. Holmes, there at least a dozen names on that board that I fear more than my government.<eos> I have a family.<eos> And Joshua Vikner will defend his position as furiously as he fought to acquire it.
I appreciate what you're doing.<eos> I know how you work.<eos> Falsifying evidence can't sit well with you.<eos> Desperate times.<eos> Sometimes you have to bite the orange in order to peel it.
FYI?<eos> The "here" your best thinking got you to is this bar, richer than you were a few hours ago by $100,000.<eos> I'm gonna buy that bottle.<eos> Don't buy it.<eos> If you really want it, we can steal it.

8,000 euros.<eos> What happened in the woods?<eos> I don't know.<eos> But you didn't make the tree up.<eos> You saw it.
Many images refer to fire and smoke.<eos> I'm trying to understand what they represent.<eos> Do you think it could be linked to his father?<eos> We inherited my grandparents' place.<eos> We had no money to renew it.
Run!<eos> Get away!<eos> The door!<eos> Get the door!<eos> Hurry! Just close it!
- Jin-hee!<eos> Jin-hee!<eos> Open it now!<eos> It won't budge!<eos> I can't open it!
Assistant Principal Wilson, wanna see a magic trick?<eos> Sure.<eos> But I dabble in magic, too, so I'm not easy to impress.<eos> Pick a card.<eos> Now remember it and put it back.
I like you.<eos> So I'm gonna give you an opportunity to help yourself, To be absolved of the sins you've committed today.<eos> Look, I know you didn't steal this watch for yourself.<eos> I mean, what are you gonna do with it?<eos> Wear it to social studies?
Look, I know you didn't steal this watch for yourself.<eos> I mean, what are you gonna do with it?<eos> Wear it to social studies?<eos> Maybe.<eos> You stole it to sell, Just like all the other watches you've stolen,
Never let me take your phone again, okay?<eos> Why did you take the watch?<eos> I would have bought you anything you wanted.<eos> Tell her.<eos> I took it for you.
I took it for you.<eos> I thought you would think it would be cool.<eos> A watch from this place?<eos> No.<eos> That I stole it.
- Wow!<eos> Where did you learn to do that?<eos> - Hack and error.<eos> Yes, very impressive. Why are we wasting our time with this?<eos> She emailed herself that file, then sent it to Emma with that "Secret Friend" dummy email account.
The camera in the storage unit.<eos> The killer put it there.<eos> That's how he knew about the recording.<eos> He hasn't been watching us. He's been listening!<eos> He knew I would take it.
Audrey!<eos> Hey, stop! Audrey! Did you know about this party?<eos> - No, no.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Look, someone set it up to make it look like we planned this. You and me.
He must have bent over backwards to get something like that.<eos> I feel very lucky.<eos> I have to tell you something.<eos> What?<eos> I stole that sculpture from a certain somebody's studio and then I tried to sell it through Martin, but Martin took it and gave it to you.
Are you Robin?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> I found your wallet on the ground, and I must have spilled the drink when I leaned down to pick it up.<eos> Oh, I didn't even realize I had dropped it. - Thank you.
Is that your pen name?<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> I'm the ghostwriter.<eos> You see, Paula wrote the first half of the book and sent it straight to the publishers.
Anyway, there's a five-star hotel with 18 rooms.<eos> If one necklace is stolen, the whole place becomes a crime scene, so...<eos> They'll blame the maid.<eos> Just take it to the front desk.<eos> Say you found it.
I already found a wallet.<eos> What?<eos> Robin...<eos> Bill's wife.<eos> I took it for fun so I wouldn't drink.
- What did you do?<eos> - I was trying to put on this film thing.<eos> - What film thing?<eos> Don't know. Some programme lets you watch free films.<eos> While I was trying to put it on, then it locked up.
No way.<eos> Option two's incarceration.<eos> - I'd advise you to consider.<eos> - Fuck you! Mass is a friend.<eos> Without it, you will remember everything that you did.
She smashed her head...<eos> onto the desk, hard.<eos> Then she... she pushed me over.<eos> That must've been when the bottle smashed.<eos> Then she picked it up, and she started cutting herself.
- They're not either.<eos> We're talking about your wife here, Mr. Mitchell.<eos> How can you not be interested?<eos> You have a safe and effective option available.<eos> Use it.
Okay, the best.<eos> She's-- you know, she can do anything.<eos> She's like the salt in the dessert.<eos> And Cynthia, she plays with such passion and such sadness. I- - I don't know where it comes from.<eos> Use it.
Nothing to suggest he won't make a full recovery.<eos> There's also nothing to suggest he will.<eos> Dr. Latham.<eos> I realize, like every doctor who teaches here, you have your own methods.<eos> But, I assume, if I have an opinion, you'd like to hear it.
And we weren't alone.<eos> The DEA, CIA, Centra Spike and the army, all under one roof.<eos> It was one-stop shopping for all things Pablo Escobar.<eos> After Gaviria announced a new $1.4 million reward for Pablo's capture, Colonel Pinzón activated a new tip line.<eos> And apparently he thought Javi and I were just the guys to oversee it.
Yes, Maritza.<eos> We're going to do this together.<eos> But I need you to trust me.<eos> Give me the address.<eos> Write it down.
Yes, we have one.<eos> This is the sort of place where you can drive cars at speeds that you can do on the road but only if you want to go to prison afterwards.<eos> What, like 38 miles an hour?<eos> 39 maybe even, 40 from time to time.<eos> Now, we were hoping that we could bring it round the world with us like the tent.
I don't remember the name of it.<eos> "Cock Tease."<eos> Yes.<eos> It was so messed up. But Mrs. Bumgarner loved it.<eos> She made you stand up, read it to the class.
I'm on it, Mrs. Finley!<eos> I'm on it.<eos> I told you I can't work this thing!<eos> Tara, have you seen the instruction book for the organ?<eos> I think Mrs. Finley has it.
Casey, stop!<eos> Father?<eos> Hey, Mom.<eos> What are you doing up here?<eos> Father Tomas killed a rat. Whacked it with a book.
Don't move, asshole!<eos> Come here, you piece of shit!<eos> You'd already be dead if it was up to me.<eos> Think I forgot you shot outside my house?<eos> But there's a deal now, and Don Pietro said we have to respect it, and so do you, okay?
This is about our ability to say to ourselves that we are a genuinely democratic and free people.<eos> That's how important this is.<eos> In return for our democratic rights, we've been promised prosperity and security.<eos> Are these promises convincing?<eos> The choice before us is all about democracy, and how highly we value it.
One side knows, if one side is a priesthood and knows how it all works and the rest of us ordinary citizens don't know how it works, a massive transfer of power takes place.<eos> It was devised to make sure that the great mass of the people could not control government, ever again.<eos> WHO'S IN CHARGE?<eos> Problem #2:<eos> for a democracy to function, you need to know who's running it.
While at the same time giving rights to people elsewhere to fish the same waters.<eos> Ah, that's right, uh-huh.<eos> For the fishermen here, being in the EU does not mean that Britain has greater influence over European affairs;<eos> it means that Europe has taken control of our affairs.<eos> We have not gained power, we've lost it.
And those rule books stack up one on top of the other, such that no reasonable human being could now possibly have an understanding of all the rules they need to obey.<eos> You've got thousands and thousands of bureaucrats, civil servants and administrators, and their job is to push paper, write on paper, have rules on paper, pile up more and more paper.<eos> You just get a mass of growing telephone-directory-sized rules and regulations, one after the other, ceaselessly, endlessly.<eos> That is actually what the bureaucracy sees itself as [being] there to do.<eos> If the list of EU rules could be put into one document today, it would take more than two men to carry it on.
The EU has slid from free trade into crony capitalism and protectionism.<eos> Protection hurts consumers, who have to pay more for inferior products.<eos> It hurts industries, whose costs are forced higher.<eos> In the end, it even hurts the firms who are protected.<eos> Protecting a firm from competition does not make it more competitive.
Despite decades of economic decline, the EU elite carry on regardless.<eos> They are unmoved by criticism, untroubled by popular discontent.<eos> But the frustration of ordinary people is beginning to show.<eos> We now have to focus on constructing a firewall to prevent contagion within the Eurozone.<eos> What you can see everywhere is a conflict between the visions of a rather narrow kind of professional middle class, which is dominant in European politics, and the reaction against it by the larger bulk of the European population.
My mother didn't have a scar when we moved to Africa, Abe.<eos> I just looked at this old picture.<eos> No.<eos> My father...<eos> He-he gave me the injection before we left Boston, but... but he obviously... he didn't give it to my mother.
They supposedly had developed a synthetic bio-active compound that allowed them to recreate extinct animals.<eos> I didn't believe it... until now.<eos> Max.<eos> We need a saber-toothed cat.<eos> Well... sounds like there's only one place on Earth you can find it.
I'm a friend of your son.<eos> Jackson is in trouble, and I think that he might be trying to find you. Please.<eos> He really needs your help.<eos> Hello?<eos> Did you get it?
- Sir.<eos> What about the security guard?<eos> Take care of him.<eos> I've just e-mailed you the correct formula.<eos> Test it.
It's halothane.<eos> Knockout gas.<eos> Whoever's chasing the DNA is still here.<eos> There it is.<eos> Let's take it and go.
My thumb comes off this button...<eos> I'd back up if I were you. No.<eos> Absolutely not.<eos> I need this DNA.<eos> Why? So you can sell it?
Why? So you can sell it?<eos> Do you even have a soul?<eos> I don't need one after the check for this job clears.<eos> If Davies gets ahold of this DNA, it is over!<eos> We need to destroy it.
But it was all pretend.<eos> Henry didn't know my dad.<eos> Neither did I.<eos> Well, I knew your dad.<eos> And... he didn't invent chocolate milk, but he liked it.
It's actually-<eos> - Casey, it's not your fault, brother.<eos> It's not the writer's fault this show is so bad.<eos> And it's so bad!<eos> It's not the network's fault for airing it! It's you guys!
Yeah, it's pocket-size, so it keeps me sharp.<eos> Guitar's still my weapon of choice, though.<eos> Oh, of course.<eos> I haven't heard you play in a while.<eos> Maybe you can bring it with you on the trip?
See that brooch my mom is wearing?<eos> Yeah, it's hard to miss.<eos> Well, the story she's telling that woman is, when I was little, I earned $4 a week doing chores.<eos> My friend Amber's mom took us downtown to go shopping at Christmastime, and we were in this crappy little store when I saw that rhinestone brooch.<eos> I just had to get it for my mom.
My friend Amber's mom took us downtown to go shopping at Christmastime, and we were in this crappy little store when I saw that rhinestone brooch.<eos> I just had to get it for my mom.<eos> I really thought it would make her happy.<eos> The part she's not telling that lady is that the brooch cost $16 and I didn't have enough money.<eos> So when nobody was looking, I put it in my pocket.
I don't want to be a part of this.<eos> Ding dong.<eos> We are not professionals!<eos> Shut your hole!<eos> Before we tear it out your face and throw it in a dumpster!
The machine I used is in the socket in my lab.<eos> You use your machine to go back where you started.<eos> Wait, where's your time machine?<eos> - Aw... nuts.<eos> - We forgot it.
Stay here.<eos> Farah, wait.<eos> Stay here.<eos> Oh, Jesus!<eos> We have to fix the machine. We have to send it back.
Yeah!<eos> You're not going to have to worry about that shit anymore.<eos> You brought the cat.<eos> Well, of course, I did.<eos> Are you ever going to tell me why you took it from the crime scene?
I'm on my way.<eos> I have a theory.<eos> I have a theory, and I don't like it at all, but it's... it's my theory right now, and right now that's all I got.<eos> So, uh...<eos> I'm gonna explain it to you, and... if you understand it,
That dog... is the most important thing here.<eos> Because it's Lydia Spring.<eos> Yes.<eos> How did they turn her into a dog?<eos> Oh, they-they didn't, they took the soul out of her body and swapped it with a dog.
You killed them?<eos> Well, the shark did, certainly.<eos> This "machine," where is it?<eos> Here, right here.<eos> We put it together ourselves, so some bits might be on backwards, but...
Jenk's in your office waiting for his son to pick him up.<eos> I hope you don't mind, but I found something.<eos> After Dan shot those wolves, somebody set up this web page.<eos> Looks like a shaming site.<eos> Who set it up?
Don't forget to close the blinds, okay?<eos> What the hell do you think you're doing? Hey!<eos> Let go.<eos> Give me the camera.<eos> Give it back.
Grace, before I met you, no one had ever looked at my art.<eos> Had ever looked at me as if I mattered.<eos> I love you, baby, and I will do whatever it takes to make you trust me again.<eos> I've been working on a surprise for you.<eos> But you can only get it if you come to the show tomorrow.
Well, I'm coming with you.<eos> What about the trial?<eos> Stan has the courtroom covered.<eos> If there's evidence that can exonerate Grace, I'm not gonna sit around and wait for it to show up.<eos> I'm gonna help you find it.
Did you understand the physics homework?<eos> What?<eos> Don't "oh" me.<eos> Fine.<eos> Though I didn't understand all of it either.
So nice, but also careful.<eos> Like me and my mum were just glass figurines.<eos> I'm not made of glass.<eos> What he did, it's important, but if it's the thing that rules, Then he gets to keep doing that to us every day forever. And I won't have that.<eos> I play folk music because I love it.
You know, I'm not crazy about the idea of getting in bed with a mass murderer.<eos> Who?<eos> Delaney? You're forgetting we changed history. It never happened.<eos> She still created the most destructive weapon in history.<eos> If the military hadn't taken it farther away--
Go.<eos> I already shut off the relief valve that had been opened remotely, so you don't need to bother going through the motions.<eos> So... Major Dickless didn't have the balls to do this himself?<eos> If you mean Major Gleason, who took your antimatter last night, no.<eos> In fact, we're the ones who took it from him.
They will be happy with the crumbs.<eos> You'll miss many graduations, anniversaries and weddings.<eos> On your child's birthday bullets will rain atop some mountain.<eos> Still, it will be worth every second.<eos> This love, is such a love that even if it consumes you kills you you will never let go.
So how would you like to explain what just happened out there?<eos> A kryptonite-charged cyborg almost killed Kara. Almost killed me.<eos> Start talking, J'onn.<eos> A shipment went missing four months ago.<eos> We've done all we can to find it.
Hit 'em hard and fast and be extra ruthless.<eos> They won't see it coming.<eos> [laughs menacingly] Mort, the sea air really agrees with you.<eos> I know.<eos> I like to put it in my stomach.
-Huh? Quiet, Clover.<eos> Can't you see I'm hiding from my parents?<eos> Are they coming?<eos> Do they have the bell?<eos> Do you hear it?
[Barty] Knock-knock.<eos> Anyone home?<eos> It's the parents.<eos> They've got the bell.<eos> And they're gonna ring it.
There's no way you can lose.<eos> Come on, let's go.<eos> [Leonard screaming] [male lemur] King Julien killed him, murderer!<eos> Oh, the excitement is palpable.<eos> Can you feel it, Horst?
Remember, you're a mean little butterfly.<eos> I'm a mean little butterfly. [snarling] [straining] King Julien,<eos> I don't think I can hold it much longer.<eos> Sure you can, Mo-Mo. Hey, Dorothy, watch this move.<eos> I call it "The Full Diva."
I said...<eos> let us begin.<eos> Yes, of course. [chuckles nervously]<eos> I offer you this flower as a symbol of peace.<eos> I hope you will take it and we can put an end to this war and go back to peaceful peacey-ness.
Actually, he said "found," but I thought that was a cliche so I put a little KJ stink on it.<eos> King Julien, I knew you'd return.<eos> Here, take my hat for good luck.<eos> [laughs] It's yours.<eos> Take it.
The torch fills the dark room with light.<eos> You see a door in front of you.<eos> What do you do?<eos> I open the door.<eos> How do you open it?
The knob doesn't turn.<eos> How do you open it?<eos> I don't know.<eos> The knob doesn't turn.<eos> How do you open it?
- She's got you there.<eos> - I know.<eos> - Dad?<eos> - I love this town.<eos> I absolutely love it.
- I know.<eos> - Dad?<eos> - I love this town.<eos> I absolutely love it.<eos> I love it just the way it is.
So... that show?<eos> Did you bring it up, or did Katie bring it up?<eos> She did.<eos> Why?<eos> Katie! Oh, it's just, uh... weird they'd just air it again.
Yes, because she betrayed them after they brought her to meet the Man in the High Castle.<eos> You have proof of this?<eos> Erich, could you, could you give us a moment?<eos> The medal behind your desk.<eos> Might I examine it more closely?
Do you want me to get him for you?<eos> No, it´s okay.<eos> I´ll call him later.<eos> He wanted your cell.<eos> Did you give it to him?
No, it´s okay.<eos> I´ll call him later.<eos> He wanted your cell.<eos> Did you give it to him?<eos> Yeah. I just give out your cell number to whoever wants it.
I'm scared.<eos> Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.<eos> I want you to go home, and I want you to get my gun.<eos> What? Keep it on you, just in case.<eos> And if I'm wrong about Mike, then you don't use it.
Mmm. Feel harder?<eos> Wouldn't it be a little better with a little support?<eos> Yeah, I guess.<eos> -Perfect. -[chuckles]<eos> I'll get it for you.
Oh, Patrick, hey. I've been working on a new magic trick, and I think we should add it to the act.<eos> Okay, ready?<eos> Watch this.<eos> All right, take a look at this ordinary, average banana.<eos> I'm going to make it disappear in two seconds flat.
Do you know how to find April? No.<eos> But we know someone who might be able to help.<eos> From what we understand he's the only one who can use the weapon.<eos> He is, but he won't do it.<eos> He lied to me about it even working all this time.
Maybe.<eos> But you gave up having that choice.<eos> Yeah, I did.<eos> I won't change my number.<eos> I'll keep it.
What if that's forever?<eos> Then it's forever.<eos> Do you know the feeling of dread?<eos> The anchor is prepared, Your Majesty.<eos> Once I attach it, it will hold the heart in your body and you will be whole again.
Where did you come from?<eos> Why did you kill those three people?<eos> I just went in to eat noodles<eos> But the kid came and grabbed my gun!<eos> I was going to get it back but the gun went off!
If anything goes wrong, we'll die.<eos> Don't you know what kind of man he is?<eos> If he's having fun he won't stop.<eos> If he wanted them dead we would have killed them already.<eos> Besides we want to reign a city, Not destroy it.
Well, you never really get people until you try to see things from their point of view.<eos> Climb into their skin and walk around in it, you know.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Well, you know what, Alec? Right now I do not wanna walk around in Dennis' skin.<eos> I wanna peel it slowly from his bones.
A blow-up sort of thing.<eos> -What you--? You lost it?<eos> -Yeah, I lost it, royally.<eos> There was a Jesus statue made of pills.<eos> -I pushed it over.
- Sounds like it.<eos> - Did he say anything to you?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Said I was spreading poison on the Reservation.<eos> Then he took my merchandise and burned it.
Too much stress makes me nauseous.<eos> [Walt] You get his name or anything?<eos> I got a business card.<eos> There's no name, but a number.<eos> So you've kept it?
What else you got?"<eos> You remember that time, what was it?<eos> Last year or whatever, we was working at Columbia University? We was working on cancer research.<eos> We talked about cell division, mitosis.<eos> And you were just like, "How can we get these microtubules to grow in the middle of a cell and suddenly make it divide?
Like, that's how guns is.<eos> Like, the more that you look at a gun and you see a gun where a gun is, most likely that is the gun that you're looking at.<eos> And that's the most dangerous thing about a gun.<eos> So, when you think about owning a gun, realize this:<eos> when you buy it and you put it somewhere, it's probably gonna be there when you look at it again.
Ex.<eos> Thank God.<eos> Now he's someone else's problem.<eos> So, why is he chasing you?<eos> Well, I-I thought I lost this necklace, and then I see it on the neck of J.P.'s new wife.
- Yeah.<eos> - Whoa.<eos> That asshole stole it from me and gave it to another woman.<eos> Right?<eos> So, I-I saw them at the Blind Tiger just now and I took it back.
- Whoa.<eos> That asshole stole it from me and gave it to another woman.<eos> Right?<eos> So, I-I saw them at the Blind Tiger just now and I took it back.<eos> You stole it right off of his wife's neck.
That asshole stole it from me and gave it to another woman.<eos> Right?<eos> So, I-I saw them at the Blind Tiger just now and I took it back.<eos> You stole it right off of his wife's neck.<eos> No, I didn't steal it.
- No, we need to get her to a hospital.<eos> - No. If we take her to the hospital, they're gonna call the cops.<eos> The cops are gonna come along and think that I did this shit.<eos> Why would they think you did this?<eos> Maybe it's because I broke in here to get my necklace back after this knocked-out bitch yanked it off my neck yesterday in a bar fight that everybody saw.
I got so embarrassed, I just...<eos> I drove back.<eos> I drove all night.<eos> Can you give me that address for his house?<eos> Yeah, I have it memorized.
I was taking pictures. And I tripped over a homeless person.<eos> Where's my camera?<eos> Where exactly did you find her? Boarded-up building near Bed-Stuy.<eos> My sister wants her camera back.<eos> She can't live without it.
- Ooh, is that fairy dust?<eos> - Stop!<eos> That's... poison from the evil Queen.<eos> - You know the story.<eos> - I do know all about it, yes.
He did it because he knew it was the best chance any of us had...<eos> I can barely believe he's still hanging on.<eos> Blood was obliterating the lung and pleural space in the left, diminishing lung capacity and preventing him from properly oxygenating.<eos> After evacuation of a large volume of blood and clot, his spleen was noted to be extensively damaged.<eos> I was able to safely remove it but his vital signs remain unstable and he's still in guarded condition.
I informed her yes.<eos> It's a little too ambitious right now.<eos> You don't go to Mars without ambition.<eos> No matter how hard Ed Grann's team worked to expand Olympus Town's infrastructure,<eos> Mars worked even harder to tear it down.
I spoke to Paul and he seemed, distant.<eos> He's just focused.<eos> I checked his ration allotment and he's hardly eating.<eos> He forgets sometimes.<eos> Look, he lives for his work and he can't do it.
There's a big-deal Pon general in town.<eos> Thanks to you, we can take him out without sacrificing any of our people.<eos> And you want my help to make the bomb.<eos> No.<eos> I want you and Sara to figure out where to place it.
Yes, there is.<eos> Turner versus the State of Michigan.<eos> How the hell did you find that?<eos> It turns out being a paralegal for so long was a blessing in disguise, because nobody is better at research than me.<eos> Great. Write up a declaration, and get it to me as soon as you're done.
I didn't abuse shit.<eos> I beg to differ.<eos> 'Cause not only does Kevin live in New Jersey, but his accident was there too, were means you were outside of your jurisdiction.<eos> You better rescind this suit, because if they come after me--<eos> They're not gonna come after you, Sean, because I haven't filed it yet.
I guess what I'm trying to say is, I'm not denying the person I was or the things I did, because I did those things.<eos> If I could go back and change what I did, I would, but I can't.<eos> What I can do is swear to you that I will never go back to being that person again.<eos> You crossed the line when you took Jill's money.<eos> No, Mike, I didn't, but I'm about to cross it now.
- I don't believe this.<eos> I'm about to give the most important cross examination in my life and you're showing up now?<eos> - Jessica, we left you a dozen messages.<eos> Jim Reynolds' board moved up the meeting.<eos> - Then tell them to push it back because I can't go right now.
- Jessica, we left you a dozen messages.<eos> Jim Reynolds' board moved up the meeting.<eos> - Then tell them to push it back because I can't go right now.<eos> - Goddamn it, don't you get it?<eos> They moved it up so they can get it over with.
I mean, we didn't deep-dive into her history, but Jaclyn did say she had a wonderful childhood.<eos> But you said that the work you were doing was behavioral... strategies by which she'd say no to her husband.<eos> That's true.<eos> Saying you had a wonderful childhood<eos> - does not make it so.
That's true.<eos> Saying you had a wonderful childhood<eos> - does not make it so.<eos> - Well... You know, my collection of perfumes?<eos> She found it, she wanted to try one.
Besides the obvious hypocrisy of pretending that Nicole faces expulsion over a teaspoon of herbs when the Layton girl was selling pills on campus last fall, and yet I just saw her in the hallway.<eos> Okay, what are you doing?<eos> I'm being the feeder.<eos> It's very simple.<eos> We thank you for your consideration, but we don't need it.
And we are going to stop Murphy from creating his damn race of blends.<eos> That's why they call him The Man.<eos> They'll all come after us.<eos> The battle for the future of humanity is about to begin.<eos> And I intend to win it.
So you're not ready to go?<eos> There's still time to find out what is making these folks sick.<eos> And what if we get sick?<eos> Is that worth the risk?<eos> Why save the world if there's nobody left to enjoy it?
"Mandatory sentencing." We said we were no longer going to let judges consider the circumstances around a crime.<eos> We're just going to impose a mandatory sentence.<eos> And that's a difficult thing for judges because they are trying to dispense justice on a daily basis and are unable to do so.<eos> In many California communities, all civil trials have been canceled to catch up with the criminal case workload.<eos> We've taken discretion away from judges, arguably the most neutral party in the court, and given it over to prosecutors.
I threatened to tell people that he was an informant, but what I also did was found out a way to get him parole.<eos> Parole?<eos> Are you crazy?<eos> He's not gonna get parole.<eos> Who's gonna say he deserves it?
Are you crazy?<eos> He's not gonna get parole.<eos> Who's gonna say he deserves it?<eos> You know what, Harvey?<eos> Instead of coming here and telling me to betray my cellmate because Gallo will never get parole, maybe you should be helping me get it for him.
I'm never helping that piece of shit do anything, and this isn't about Gallo and you know it.<eos> No, it's about you telling me to turn on the one guy in here that I trust based on some plan that Cahill has that we don't even know will work.<eos> No, Mike.<eos> It's about giving you a chance to get your life back while it still looks the same.<eos> Now, are you going to take it or not?
I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> Who's Nathan Byrnes?<eos> CEO of Exodyne.<eos> Oh, that Nathan Byrnes.<eos> In that case, I said I could sell that stock because I own it.
He promised Mike he wouldn't tell her, and Harvey's a man of his word.<eos> If he were a man of his word, he would be here right now.<eos> So what are you gonna do?<eos> I'm gonna do what should've been done in the first place.<eos> I'm gonna tell Mike's fiancée that he has a chance to get out but he doesn't want to take it.
How does that help me? It doesn't.<eos> It helps me.<eos> - Donna!<eos> - Okay, listen to me.<eos> If you really want my help, I'm gonna give it to you.
I have no idea what you're talking about.<eos> Oh, well, it doesn't matter, 'cause I'm not bringing an indictment without knowing that I can win at trial.<eos> And you're never gonna win at trial if you don't shake the trees and see what falls.<eos> Damn it, Harvey, I am not colluding on this, and you're in here trying to get me to bring an indictment against your own client.<eos> Because when you bring that indictment, I'm gonna beat it, and if you don't bring it and continue investigating my client, I'm gonna sue you, which is exactly what I'd be doing no matter who he was.
Well, I'm glad you're okay.<eos> What's on your mind?<eos> I need you to get a message to the warden for me.<eos> Sure.<eos> I'll bring it to him at our weekly brunch.
That's not a good enough reason to turn our backs on Leonard Bailey.<eos> Well, don't ever question my financial wizardry again.<eos> Let's have it.<eos> I was banging my head against the wall, trying to figure out a way to stop the suspension, but then it dawned on me.<eos> We don't need to stop it.
I suppose if I asked you who he paid, you'd have the same answer.<eos> I find out you're lying, next time, you are gonna be the one in solitary, and it won't be just one night.<eos> - What?<eos> - I'm just thinking about when this asshole finds out you're gonna blow his bullshit suspension out of the water.<eos> William, I am gonna blow it out of the water, but I'm gonna need you to sign this first.
I need a large, expensive home in the Hamptons.<eos> Why are you buying a vacation home?<eos> Because I told Tara Messer that I have a property out there, and I hired her to remodel it for me.<eos> Damn it, Harvey, I'm not colluding on this, and you're in here trying to get me to bring an indictment against your own client.<eos> Because when you bring that indictment, I'm gonna beat it, and if you don't bring it, and continue investigating my client, I'm gonna sue you.
Well, you can be on your way back in, because I just came from Sutter's.<eos> I take it he told you about our little conversation today.<eos> If, by conversation, you mean going behind my back and getting his investment business, then yeah, he told me.<eos> I didn't go behind your back.<eos> I saw an opportunity, and I took it.
I take it he told you about our little conversation today.<eos> If, by conversation, you mean going behind my back and getting his investment business, then yeah, he told me.<eos> I didn't go behind your back.<eos> I saw an opportunity, and I took it.<eos> Well, now he's seeing an opportunity, and he's taking it.
- It can't.<eos> - Why's that?<eos> Because Sutter wants me to move for an immediate dismissal.<eos> What?<eos> You leveraged me into bringing this indictment, and now you want to toss it?
Then Mike's chance of getting out of prison is gone, which means Cahill's not the only one that needs to use this to try and get something.<eos> I have to admit, Ms. Zane, when you said you were looking into the Bailey case, my interest was piqued.<eos> That was a long time ago.<eos> Well, you've obviously come a long way since your public defender days.<eos> You don't exactly see the best of humanity at that job, which makes it one you can only do for so long.
Now we try to fix this damn thing.<eos> You mean by finding Maria Gomez.<eos> I mean by delaying this execution.<eos> Jessica, Leonard's right.<eos> What good does it do to delay the execution if we can't stop it from happening?
Defend my own client?<eos> Bullshit, you weren't trying to defend your client.<eos> You were trying to ruin my case 'cause you're pissed off about Mike.<eos> I sure as hell am.<eos> We had a deal and you broke it.
Bullshit, you weren't trying to defend your client.<eos> You were trying to ruin my case 'cause you're pissed off about Mike.<eos> I sure as hell am.<eos> We had a deal and you broke it.<eos> So now I'm breaking it, too. Well, you know what, Harvey?
- Did you get the apartment?<eos> - The...<eos> - Did you call?<eos> What did they say?<eos> I called, and... they gave it to the grad students.
I can't help thinking that I...<eos> We, er... Yeah? I know that we, er... ..don't have much of a chance to, er...<eos> Did you take the sculpture?<eos> Did you, erm... ..take the sculpture?<eos> Did you take it?
Just tomatoes? Just a tomato sandwich?<eos> Yes.<eos> Is there a problem?<eos> No.<eos> Listen, I don't want to know anything about this surprise party, but, if you could just, erm, have it at mine this Friday at 7:30, that'd be great.
Yes.<eos> Is there a problem?<eos> No.<eos> Listen, I don't want to know anything about this surprise party, but, if you could just, erm, have it at mine this Friday at 7:30, that'd be great.<eos> I can organise it and act surprised but, if you could just, erm...
I can see the way they look.<eos> I should get rid of all of them except for you.<eos> Then I would be working all day instead of playing - with this.<eos> The art never judges.<eos> I envy it.
We just heard.<eos> Our banger, Marco?<eos> CT chest showed the bullet isn't in the midline or touching the aorta.<eos> It's in the left paraspinal muscles.<eos> Surgeon gonna go in and get it?
I know what it means.<eos> It just seems trivial.<eos> Try to understand that this is a very delicate stage.<eos> Public opinion matters a great deal.<eos> Without it, everything falls apart.
Doesn't look good, but it also doesn't feel right.<eos> Whoever it is, we'll flush them out when we turn Miami back on.<eos> They're definitely using EMP devices.<eos> The blackout zone encompasses the same amount of area in all four cities.<eos> Now, the effect is randomly dispersed, making it difficult to pinpoint the source, but I have everything I need right here to locate it, to disable it, and trace...
She'd go out after you went to bed.<eos> - Doing what?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> Where is this necklace now?<eos> Well, she liked it so much, I put it on her, you know, down in the... pbht.
Okay. So, in that high-security building is one of the Inhuman registration information servers.<eos> I'm aware of how my own agency operates, thank you.<eos> Every day at the same time, Agent Elizabeth Albee brings a drive with updated information to this location.<eos> I'm to steal her I.D. badge...<eos> So I can clone it and put a fake identity on top of it.
Yeah, but she had it back then, too.<eos> Didn't stop her from getting ghost-toasted.<eos> There must be something something new.<eos> Did you get my inventory from Momentum Labs?<eos> Yep. I'm looking at it just now.
Eli, no, please!<eos> It's not finished yet!<eos> Please don't kill me!<eos> You weren't against Joseph getting the power.<eos> You just wanted it for yourself.
They thought I was cheating.<eos> They thought I wasn't capable!<eos> Shut me out. Well, guess what ...<eos> guess what I'm capable of now.<eos> I can create a city out of nothing, or I can cover it in volcanic rock.
Except I've proven it's not true.<eos> I'm rewriting the laws of nature.<eos> Yeah, but you're drunk on power or drinking your own Kool-Aid or drunk on Powerade ...<eos> I don't know. The point is, you're not creating energy, Eli ... you're stealing it.<eos> Stealing it?
In the meantime, we trust each other.<eos> Just as you act, I do not trust you.<eos> - Your insurance.<eos> Under the arrest warrant.<eos> - Is a copy, keep it.
Han, what is happening?<eos> - Have you met eun? - What?<eos> - Where is the weapon?<eos> What weapon?<eos> Where are the motherfuckers, I gotta get it!
A box, a locked metal box given to me by a very important person at home.<eos> Party official?<eos> He wouldn't tell me the contents of the box.<eos> He ordered me to wait for the delivery instructions.<eos> I had to get it back.
He wouldn't tell me the contents of the box.<eos> He ordered me to wait for the delivery instructions.<eos> I had to get it back.<eos> Torres had many warehouses, many offices.<eos> It took a week to find out where he kept it.
We're looking into his ex.<eos> Well, unless she's over six foot tall and incredibly strong, I wouldn't bother.<eos> That being said, I think I can identify the murder weapon.<eos> So can I.<eos> CSU bagged it 20 minutes ago.
Well, unless she's over six foot tall and incredibly strong, I wouldn't bother.<eos> That being said, I think I can identify the murder weapon.<eos> So can I.<eos> CSU bagged it 20 minutes ago.<eos> The killer left it?
All I need to do is share my suspicions with my clients, and you're going to be the next one going to pieces.<eos> You wouldn't.<eos> Confess.<eos> If you're arrested, tried and convicted, I might be able to persuade them that justice has been done.<eos> If Jimmy Koslow was offered the same opportunity, I think he'd have taken it.
Man of God.<eos> Mighty Marcus. Vessel of nothing!<eos> - Smells good, honey.<eos> What happened to your shirt?<eos> I'm gonna put it away for tonight.
I-It's not what you think.<eos> I...<eos> Oh, really? Because I think my teenage son is dealing drugs.<eos> Possession with intent to distribute, and that is a felony.<eos> Penny found it.
No, come on in.<eos> ...earlier today was a serene... I think Tyler Richmond is dodging my calls.<eos> I'm sorry about what happened.<eos> You wrote a beautiful eulogy.<eos> I'm sorry he didn't get to hear it.
I think not.<eos> Say we're right.<eos> Aaron found a piece of film that is blackmail-worthy.<eos> Only the person he was trying to extort turned the tables on him and kidnapped Beth.<eos> If the footage is here, I'm gonna miss it.
And then I knocked louder and I called for Meredith.<eos> And finally I was like,<eos> "Raffaele, can you please, like, try to break open this door?<eos> I don't know if Meredith's in there or not."<eos> And he tried kicking it down twice, but it didn't work.
Russian red wire to Iranian green doesn't work, the main charge degraded.<eos> But I wouldn't rule out good old-fashioned human error.<eos> You're telling me that the people who blew up our U.S. Capitol in one shot, didn't test the triggers, the wiring?<eos> Then what are you suggesting?<eos> What if this bomb wasn't meant to explode? What if it was meant to be found?
Same as everyone else, I guess.<eos> I just came from Andrews.<eos> The bomb we just found, the UXO, it may not be telling you what you think it is.<eos> Okay, I'll bite.<eos> All right, well, what if they wanted us to find it so that we would look at Al-Sakar and not consider any other options.
Someone blew up the Capitol.<eos> Who knows what's possible anymore.<eos> On top of that, we got a guy in office who's number 11 in the line of succession.<eos> I can't go to him with speculation right now.<eos> So, if you want me to go back to him with your theory, please prove it.
Double hey. I'm gonna try this before it's all gone.<eos> Hi.<eos> Feeling better, I hope.<eos> Mostly, yeah.<eos> I would love a cup of coffee, but I don't have time to drink it before they get here.
But as long as I am and one of our own is unaccounted for, we do nothing that will jeopardize their safety any further.<eos> I agreed to 12 hours.<eos> These terrorists came to our home. They killed our people.<eos> Any sacrifices we make to eradicate them from the face of the Earth are sacrifices worth making.<eos> When a snake's in your kitchen, you don't invite it to dinner, you cut off its head.
- I am pleased for you, Kara.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> I have another idea for an article but I don't think my new boss is too keen on it.<eos> Or me, for that matter.<eos> Reporting is harder than I thought. And I thought it was gonna be really hard.
Like pure joy in food form.<eos> No, Mon-El, there's a time and a place for eating candy.<eos> Yeah, and it's this time and this place.<eos> No, this... This is your place of work.<eos> So when James gives you a task, you should be the one to complete it.
You're in charge of Cadmus.<eos> Is this the part where you lecture me, like you'd lecture Lex?<eos> No.<eos> What you said before, there was truth in that.<eos> Ask me for my help and I'll give it to you.
Well, thank you, but I have my own.<eos> Lucky you.<eos> "Tribe Called Red"?<eos> Native American battle music.<eos> Put it on.
Really?<eos> Yeah. This military guy showed up at Howard's door.<eos> He was terrifying.<eos> Oh, what did he say?<eos> He gave me his business card and asked me to please pass it along to Howard.
I bet it was Barbara Chen in retrovirus.<eos> She might have heard me throwing up one morning.<eos> Every since she got the hearing aid, she thinks she's so great.<eos> Why don't you want anyone to know?<eos> 'Cause I'm up for a major immunotherapy study, and if they find out I'm pregnant they might give it to someone else.
The three of us came up with the guidance system.<eos> - Hi.<eos> - Hello. And this is my friend, Raj.<eos> Oh, I'm not on the patent. I'm just here because there's a bumblebee in my office.<eos> I saw it.
I'll cut to the chase.<eos> The Air Force believes there's an application for this technology, and we're interested in funding your research.<eos> Well, thanks, but you should know we're a little concerned about this being used in weapons.<eos> Oh, well, let me put your mind at ease.<eos> What we use it for is none of your business.
One night, I found him at his work bench sanding the back of a drawer.<eos> He was painting it.<eos> I said, "Dad, why are you painting the back of a drawer?<eos> No one will ever see it."<eos> He said, "I'll see it."
He said: "This is nothing. But you should take a rest."<eos> I said: "I cannot ask for vacations every week."<eos> Can I, Patrick?<eos> This music is depressing.<eos> I'll ask Stephan to change it.
I was working at a bar in San Diego when I started dating this man.<eos> I thought it was love.<eos> One day, I took a picture of him, and I wanted to send it to my family.<eos> He got mad.<eos> He took out the SIM card and microwaved it.
Oh, must've fallen off.<eos> - You know, they're really flimsy...<eos> - Uh-uh.<eos> Roger.<eos> Okay, I took it off.
- Barely.<eos> Murtaugh, tell Riggs you're sorry for clocking him.<eos> You know what, then?<eos> New assignment.<eos> You're gonna hate it.
When did you two set up this little rendezvous?<eos> While I was killing it on the air?<eos> He called me today.<eos> How'd he get your number?<eos> He said you gave it to him.
Just got married.<eos> Spent his honeymoon with me here training for an op.<eos> Nonstop sacrifice.<eos> Commander, there is something I need to know.<eos> Admiral Chernow has great confidence in the operation, but you're the one who has to lead it.
Wait, this Kaier guy is the Shadowcat?<eos> Somebody wanna fill me in?<eos> Online handle for a hacker on the Dark Web.<eos> He reached the White House servers, naval intelligence, even the Pentagon's internal networks.<eos> So someone responsible for protecting our infrastructure was using their position to undermine it.
Shut up!<eos> We've found the bomb.<eos> What's the situation like?<eos> It's pretty chaotic over here.<eos> It's pretty difficult to get rid of it, you see.
What's the situation like?<eos> It's pretty chaotic over here.<eos> It's pretty difficult to get rid of it, you see.<eos> - The bomb is attached to the pipe.<eos> - Can't you just detach it?
The bomb explodes, the bastard will die.<eos> It's upgraded with American equipment.<eos> It's heavy, right?<eos> Can you hold on until the police gets here, Captain.<eos> - Tell me how to disable it.
"What's time to a pig?"<eos> That's a riddle.<eos> Or what is it?<eos> No, I hate riddles.<eos> It asks you to consider whether the baggage you carry is really necessary, or if it could just be set aside, if only you'd try.
-It's kind of part of the gig.<eos> Oh, so this is where all the fermentation happens, right here?<eos> Yeah, this is where it happens.<eos> Uh, it's where beer becomes beer. We kinda--<eos> We make all the wort on that side, pump it over here, -hooks up with yeast... -Wow.
I don't think she is coming back.<eos> It's okay.<eos> [waitress] Would you like a menu?<eos> Yeah, I'm hungry. Just...<eos> You can just set it down.
It's okay.<eos> [waitress] Would you like a menu?<eos> Yeah, I'm hungry. Just...<eos> You can just set it down.<eos> -I'll look at it in a second.
Got it right here.<eos> On the day following the murder, several calls were placed on Parks' phone to a Montclair cellphone number.<eos> The number was registered to a woman named Lori Hammond, a 35-year-old single mother, currently employed as a travel agent.<eos> When I interviewed Lori Hammond, she told me the Montclair cell number was part of her cellphone's friends and family plan.<eos> She'd gotten it for her brother Woody, a Gulf War veteran, who had been living with her and her son.
I'm gonna take a cup and what you're gonna do is take the cockroach and dunk him into the ice water.<eos> -Where do you touch them?<eos> -Just grab it from the side.<eos> -Okay.<eos> -Yeah you got it, you got it.
Would it be like a storm cloud building up electricity<eos> -and then releasing a lightning bolt?<eos> -Yeah, it's just like that actually.<eos> You're storing energy in the cloud then the lightning bolt arcs out.<eos> Well, here we store that energy in some capacitors and then our solid-state circuit dumps it all into the Tesla coil really quick.
I don't think this is supposed to feel like this.<eos> So, how close is this to a real superpower?<eos> -It looks like a real superpower.<eos> -Yeah.<eos> I mean, I was able to control the electricity, harness it to the point where I could actually fire and hit my targets, and if you got hit by one of those bolts, it would kill you.
They've been California royalty ever since.<eos> That doesn't make them above the law.<eos> No, but they do keep an entire law firm on retainer.<eos> Well, good.<eos> If this Dylan kid murdered our girl then he's gonna need it.
Well, somebody else knows because they saw it in the folder.<eos> You looked in our folder?<eos> ! It was an accident.<eos> The doctor left the folder out on her desk.<eos> It's not my fault I opened it and looked.
- Gabby, I'll fix this.<eos> I promise.<eos> Hey.<eos> The, brunette, Lizzie, left her number.<eos> Said to make sure you get it.
I get it.<eos> You were scared.<eos> I was terrified.<eos> One thing I don't get:<eos> Dearing only had one bullet in his gun, and he was so quick to use it.
Especially for the tracker?<eos> -Well, yeah, because...<eos> -What's it made of?<eos> -Well, leather, I suppose.<eos> Did you make it yourself? -No, it came... -A little leather pouch.
Now, as we know, in recent years the world's carmakers have made great strides to make more fuel-efficient and environmentally-friendly car engines, but very little has been done to make more environmentally-friendly car bodies and interiors.<eos> Yeah, by and large, they are still made of steel and plastic, and that consumes a huge amount of energy.<eos> So we had an idea. Are there more sustainable materials that could be used instead?<eos> Well, to find out, each of us bought a Land Rover Discovery.<eos> We then removed its metal body and replaced it with whatever we thought was the best solution for the future of the planet.
The next morning, I woke to find I'd been recruited into the Clarkson and May Rhino Protection Squad.<eos> They were even convinced that our beach buggies would be ideal for tracking the poachers.<eos> I can't deny, they do have a point about the whole rhino thing.<eos> It is ridiculous.<eos> Two rhinos killed every day in Africa by poachers, and then sold to a market that believes it's a cure for cancer, impotence, even hangovers.
Yeah, no, uh, not fun, actually.<eos> All she did was talk about herself.<eos> It really just seemed like she wanted an audience.<eos> And when the check came, you know what she didn't do?<eos> Grab it.
If at some point in your life, you find a way to show somebody else the same kindness that your parents showed you, that's, uh, well, that's all the present I'll need.<eos> But I sure do like this snow globe. Yes, sir.<eos> You know,<eos> I'll bet you that's just what my Montana cabin looks like, right this minute.<eos> It lights up. It does?
My understanding is that the bar will remain in Maggie's name.<eos> And then, as... as far as the, uh, ownership of the ranch. Maggie, you're just gonna sign your half over to Beau.<eos> Actually, I've thought about it, and I want to give my half to Colt and Rooster.<eos> You're gonna do what?<eos> It's my half, and I want to give it to the boys.
And then, as... as far as the, uh, ownership of the ranch. Maggie, you're just gonna sign your half over to Beau.<eos> Actually, I've thought about it, and I want to give my half to Colt and Rooster.<eos> You're gonna do what?<eos> It's my half, and I want to give it to the boys.<eos> I'd rather you gave it to the cows, they earned it.
Oh! I'd be ecstatic.<eos> I'm sure the next batch will go better.<eos> Yeah, it will.<eos> I'm gonna take it back over again.<eos> Beau, you gave them the job, you have to let them finish it.
Still screwing them cows?<eos> I thought it was sheep. So, you admit it.<eos> So... what's new?<eos> Been spending all my time at the old McConnell ranch.<eos> Some Hollywood dipshit bought it.
Change?<eos> He still flies a flag with 48 stars on it.<eos> Yeah, and if Colt asks, that's how many it's supposed to be.<eos> Look, I think your father really believes what he says, but eventually he just goes back to the way he's always been.<eos> Remember that Christmas we bought him that John Wayne DVD collection and he just used it as bookends for his John Wayne VHS collection?
- No, that woman cannot stay here. You don't get to make that decision.<eos> This is not about you.<eos> This is about our little girl, who is missing.<eos> Do you think I don't remember that every second?<eos> If that woman can help us get Casey back because she's Chris MacNeil... so crazy... if there's even a chance, we're gonna take it.
We need to get ready.<eos> Gather the others.<eos> Prepare for an attack or a siege or both.<eos> The battle for the future of humanity is about to begin.<eos> And I intend to win it.
I just can't do it.<eos> Seth, gather the press.<eos> I'll make the announcement myself.<eos> Your first press conference.<eos> Not exactly how I pictured it.
You did a final polish, right?<eos> You know, we had a deal, and you broke it.<eos> Next time you try to be a Woodward, pick a better Bernstein than Jared Abbott.<eos> Look, to be fair, all I said was that I wouldn't run with the story, and I didn't.<eos> No, you just gave it to somebody else.
Like it or not, he's not an enemy you want to make.<eos> He can hold up your entire economic agenda for the next three years.<eos> You don't have a choice.<eos> You have to accept my resignation.<eos> I appreciate the question, and I-- and I understand it.
Stimulus bills, job creation, those things go through appropriations, through Hazelton.<eos> Emily, the president didn't accept my resignation when I leaked the Al-Sakar video.<eos> He barely even knew me.<eos> You're his most trusted adviser. -He's not gonna accept yours.<eos> -I know. Which is why you're gonna accept it.
Good.<eos> So, it turns out that America's favorite vice presidential candidate and the CIA's most wanted mercenary know each other.<eos> -You're not buying it's a coincidence.<eos> -Sorry. If Catalan worked intel on the 11/14 mission, the CIA would have a file on it.<eos> Did you pull it?
Doctor, I'm gonna need you to give me every single name that had access to this file.<eos> I put an ORCON classification on this file, which means the number of people who saw it is limited.<eos> And then I sent it to the DOD security team.<eos> They all died in the Capitol.<eos> I also sent it to the head of NORCOM.
I find that highly unlikely.<eos> This file was given an ORCON classification.<eos> I can count on my hand the number of people that have seen it.<eos> Your name is the only one on the list that survived the bombing.<eos> This was sent to me, but I never had the opportunity to read it.

The White House.<eos> General, you'll be detained - until we can verify your story.<eos> - I understand.<eos> You have a serious problem.<eos> And while you may not ask for my help, it's here if you want it, sir.
If she is with the Cause, I hope she's dead.<eos> I don't get those people.<eos> -They're a bunch of fuckers.<eos> -They're ungrateful.<eos> The Offshore offers salvation for everyone and they despise it.
-To do handstands.<eos> We need to form groups.<eos> Who's got a good memory?<eos> [Marco] We'll need a group of eight memorizers.<eos> Each one will memorize a line and take it to the corresponding room.
Turn the camera off.<eos> Enough. Turn it off.<eos> Come here!<eos> Come here, quick!<eos> -Turn it off.
You got about ten seconds to reach a point with this before this water ends up on your head.<eos> Describe the image I just put on the cabinet over there.<eos> And I'm not allowed to move?<eos> You can, but remember Mr. Enriquez specifically stated that he was walking the punch bowl to the band shell, about to set it thereupon, at the moment he heard the gunshots.
Yeah.<eos> Was here.<eos> This is everything you found on the thumb drive?<eos> These messages, plus multiple drafts of Russell Cole's paper.<eos> He didn't write it by himself, he had a partner who helped.
Cole wanted more money.<eos> The partner agreed to talk about it, and told him to come back into the city.<eos> They were gonna meet at Cole's apartment two nights ago.<eos> The night Cole was murdered.<eos> We've been thinking someone who was hurt by Cole's paper killed him in anger, but it turns out, he may have been killed by whoever hired him to write it.
You're right.<eos> Why use science when you have guessing?<eos> I've seen this before.<eos> This is a message.<eos> You don't drop a corpse like this unless you want someone to see it, am I right?
What about you, Father Tomas, uh,<eos> - you gonna take a break?<eos> - No, no, no. This... ordeal has clarified some things for me.<eos> Renewed my commitment.<eos> Uh, my parish needs me, and... I've neglected it.
He built them a sandbox, and He filled it with tangible and sensual delights.<eos> Delights that we could never feel or taste or experience.<eos> He created paradise, and he handed it over to a pack of primates rutting in the dirt.<eos> Well, this world was meant for us.<eos> And we're gonna take it back.
Or not.<eos> It is your decision, not mine.<eos> Mmm? You have the power, not me.<eos> And you like power, don't you?<eos> Well, I only like it because... it allows me to do good things.
Yeah, of course I am.<eos> You know, but, look, any information you can give me will greatly help.<eos> I only saw the engine cover.<eos> You were at the casino during the heist.<eos> Your mom said she saw it 'cause you weren't supposed to be there.
There's still an Irish vibe.<eos> Like, you can tell when you compliment somebody from New York, the Irish influence.<eos> You're like, "Nice haircut. They're like, "Fuck you, what's wrong with it?"<eos> You're like, "No."<eos> "I said it was nice." "I know what you meant."
"Your glasses is fogged.<eos> Better clean off your glasses."<eos> "He live in the back of the hardware store, come in smelling' like cut keys."<eos> "Yo, your book bag is dusty. His book bag.<eos> Get it off the floor."
Even if one's natural and one's grown in a lab.<eos> Now, Pereya obviously knew that.<eos> So, Sherlock thinks there's no way he would've submitted bad research to the FDA.<eos> So, he went to Next Century Meats, and got them to give us Pereya's undoctored research.<eos> And you're comparing it to the work that was submitted to the FDA.
Tell them where you are.<eos> Tell them you want to talk about what happened last night.<eos> Call them, or I will.<eos> Let me tell you a story.<eos> If you don't believe it, just press â€œsend.â€
That's why you were at the scene almost an hour after the murder took place.<eos> Yeah, the police showed up right after we did.<eos> But we ran.<eos> Which one of you threw the gun? Me.<eos> Tall Boy gave it to me weeks ago.
But we ran.<eos> Which one of you threw the gun? Me.<eos> Tall Boy gave it to me weeks ago.<eos> He said If I was gonna roll with SBK, I had to be strapped up.<eos> So I took it to Whitlock, and I told him I didn't want it.

Okay, the stress on her, the time and effort to take care of Ethan, I could have never done that.<eos> And I could never have hurt her.<eos> So where's the gun now?<eos> In the garage at the house.<eos> I stashed it in my tool drawer after I shot the man who attacked me and Janine. I haven't seen it since.
Hard for me to imagine I missed a gun.<eos> Well, you must have.<eos> Either that, or...<eos> What?<eos> Or someone took it.
"In three-and-a-half hours, we're gonna kill a guard."<eos> And this wasn't the first time that that type of information had come back to us.<eos> [woman] It was a message clearly meant for the media.<eos> But from a distance, you couldn't read the prisoners' threat.<eos> Prison officials had already heard it.
That's horrible.<eos> Nobody should have to go through that.<eos> [inmate] Inmate negotiator.<eos> [negotiator] Please give us the respect of coming in and getting our body.<eos> We need to come in and get it and get it out of there.
This is one of the most insane stories I've ever heard.<eos> Their inspiration?<eos> A photo they saw in a magazine smuggled in from the west.<eos> This story is too amazing to ignore.<eos> I had to recreate it, using the same methods and materials they did.
This is not what we're using.<eos> All this is... is to drill the mounting hole for the real drill.<eos> This is not like any ordinary power drill you've ever seen.<eos> This is the anchor.<eos> In fact, just putting it together is a challenge.
-Come on, Guv.<eos> -Come on.<eos> -Give it away.<eos> Guvnor, let's go.<eos> They're so close to the loot, they can almost taste it.
At 7:40 p.m., the plane takes off, with only Cooper and four crew members aboard.<eos> But Cooper has no intention of landing in Reno.<eos> The Boeing 727 had a very unique feature.<eos> At the back of the plane, there was drop-down staircase.<eos> And DB Cooper knew that he could open it mid-flight.
Anybody who wants the job has to show up wearing a blue long-sleeved shirt, yellow vest, blue jeans, hats, safety glasses and work boots.<eos> September 30th, 11:00 sharp, bank parking lot.<eos> Fifteen look-alike workers arrive on cue.<eos> And here's the clever bit.<eos> DB's disguise is fastened with Velcro, so he can discard it immediately after the heist, leaving the others as unwitting decoys.
"Control link not available." - Oh, my gosh.<eos> - It's actually taken over the drone.<eos> You have no ability to do anything.<eos> And it can either move it, it can flip it, it can stop it.<eos> Or, if you like, bring it in for a gentle landing... before you stomp on it.
- When are we gonna get them?<eos> You'll probably see these in one to two years.<eos> Check out my first contender.<eos> A sci-fi prediction from the original Star Wars.<eos> In 1977, being able to record a hologram message and then play it back in thin air was the radical vision of the future.
But that's as far as I get before I find the inherent flaw in the system.<eos> Oh, really?<eos> Come on.<eos> The map has run out.<eos> So, I have to pull over, remove it and insert map two.
Douche on the loose.<eos> With four contenders duking it out for top spot, here's a fifth to add to the mix.<eos> This time, the focus is on me.<eos> This invention has taken the world by storm in just the last couple of years.<eos> You'll see it at any tourist landmark.
Remember the days when people listened to records... cassette tapes... and compact discs?<eos> You know, when your music collection was physical?<eos> Times have changed.<eos> Today, you no longer have to own music.<eos> You can choose to stream it from a remote location.
Today, you no longer have to own music.<eos> You can choose to stream it from a remote location.<eos> A music cloud.<eos> You have access to it 24/7.<eos> And you can listen to it over your phone.
-I can hear it through here?<eos> -Yeah.<eos> Yeah, I hear it.<eos> It's a sine wave.<eos> Combining those tones with a keyboard, the Telharmonium could synthesize music and play it through the phone.
First, the finishing touches.<eos> Now, when Baker skinned his car, he used wood and canvas.<eos> We're gonna use the same materials.<eos> What we're gonna do is take quarter-inch plywood, cut three-inch wide strips, and basically bend that over the frame, and then we're gonna stagger those, overlapping and nailing as we go.<eos> Once we have our basic shape, then what we're gonna do is spray it with expanding foam just to smooth it out.
And right outside this window... there was somebody out there digging.<eos> And this digging went on for several days.<eos> I thought that they were going to bury my body there.<eos> [Coimbre] The paper always arrived in my hand around seven o'clock in the morning.<eos> When I opened it, there was a headline about the kidnapping.
I said, "These books to go to Rachel." So we could swap books.<eos> And with the books, I put in my two crosswords.<eos> And he said, "Okay, no problem." And he disappeared.<eos> I didn't even know whether they would get to Rachel.<eos> But it was about 40 minutes later, he came back in with a bag and gave it back to me.
[speaking Russian] Berezovsky never did anything for free.<eos> Everywhere he went, there was always blood.<eos> [Carr] As the time went on, HC changed and his hair was getting very greasy.<eos> And I remember being let out of our room one morning, and HC was just sitting there and he had made this little kind of sculpture with his toothbrush and the toothpaste.<eos> And he was just watching it.
Harmeet... are you asleep?<eos> [Harmeet] Yes.<eos> [Loney] You had to ask permission.<eos> "Oh, Harmeet, can I use my hand for a second 'cause I'm trying to get that mosquito?"<eos> Of course I could never get it, so then it was just like... [inhales deeply] "All right, well, I guess I'm feeding mosquitos."
It's a very simple mechanism.<eos> There's just a little spring and if you lift it, it'll just release, like magic.<eos> That little nail became the instrument of grace, we called it.<eos> I remember that first night of having my hands free.<eos> I could pull the blanket up right under my chin and tuck it under my shoulders, and it felt so good. And I could...
Please! Master Jim hasn't had even an hour's training.<eos> Behold, the Soothscryer!<eos> It will judge your true spirit.<eos> Insert your right hand, Trollhunter.<eos> Um, I'm going to get it back, right?
Save Jim!<eos> - He cannot. This is Jim's fight.<eos> Rule number three.<eos> What? Huh?<eos> By Deya's grace, he found it!
Jim, hold on.<eos> Great Gronka Morka, the changeling was right!<eos> The bridge is complete, and it was here the whole time!<eos> Oh, dear...<eos> If Young Atlas won't open it for us, maybe he'll open it for you.
The Void sounds like a very empty word.<eos> - A bad word. - Yeah.<eos> And are these happy ghosts we're talking about here, or soul-sucking poltergeists?<eos> They will not suck his soul.<eos> They will merely peer into it.
Check. And I have the address.<eos> Oh, no.<eos> - You lost the address?<eos> - What? No!<eos> Of course not! You don't happen to remember it, do ya?
- No, I'm not gonna get on my knees.<eos> You do that, I'll finish you off in there.<eos> So you don't want to-- Let's just be very clear.<eos> You know? You want to keep this drought going.<eos> I was willing to break it, but you're the one.
Noel frequently discussed money with these women and even offered one work at Avid Life.<eos> He appears to have been a serial sugar daddy himself.<eos> It seems that very little of the Ashley Madison story was as it appeared.<eos> It's hard to know if the mainstream media would have given Noel and his company quite so much airtime if they'd known all that was happening behind the scenes.<eos> I don't think Ashley Madison is inventing prostitution. I think what the emails suggest they're doing is helping to automate it. And making it very easy.
In my travels, I met a strong and noble people.<eos> Among them, a female. Who accepted me for who I was.<eos> Who loved me.<eos> It was not a life I was fated to have, but it taught me something.<eos> If love is what you need, you must be willing to travel to the ends of the world to find it.
Why do you think you were created in the first place?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Maybe you were just really, really bored one day.<eos> Most scientists serve a larger purpose.<eos> To help people, to better the world, to save it.
But me,<eos> I can't help it.<eos> I can't.<eos> Drop the gun, Leo.<eos> Drop it.
And now, I'm noticing all different kinds of things, Phil, and I wanna see how they work.<eos> Like that clock.<eos> Pure craftsmanship.<eos> That belonged to my great-grandmother. 1890s.<eos> I wanna rip it apart and spread it out all over the floor.
Everybody knows we have World Jai Alai.<eos> Who's "everybody"?<eos> We're fucking everybody.<eos> Brian.<eos> Take the bag, I want you to have it.
We're fucking everybody.<eos> Brian.<eos> Take the bag, I want you to have it.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I want you to have it.
Say it!<eos> Henry!<eos> Put the pistol down.<eos> Henry!<eos> Put it down.
I am not a great writer.<eos> I am not Hawthorne.<eos> But from my first hearing of it, this tale has haunted me.<eos> It consumes me.<eos> I fear if I do not write it, then I should never write again.
But from my first hearing of it, this tale has haunted me.<eos> It consumes me.<eos> I fear if I do not write it, then I should never write again.<eos> What else?<eos> I fear if I do write it, that it will not be as good as it should be.
- Well, it don't!<eos> Not for a second does it make up for crushing a person's dreams.<eos> What?<eos> Yeah, I'll tell you what, 'cause it's clear as hell right now.<eos> You can take your hit record, wrap it up in that fur coat and you answer the phone when my lawyer calls.
Baby, I'm so thrilled that you're inspired now.<eos> Now, could you please come back in and join the party?<eos> Hey, honey?<eos> Did you like that necklace I got you?<eos> - Yeah, I love it.
I truly believe that there is an entirely- An entirely new universe just beyond our ability to see.<eos> Yes, I read your paper.<eos> - Once we get there- - If we get there.<eos> We'll be able to discover new resources, energy sources, which will revitalize our own.<eos> This is our chance to learn more about our planet and maybe even save it.
[classical music plays]<eos> [knocks on door]<eos> So someone stole my design.<eos> No one stole anything, Victor.<eos> Someone else figured out your idea and made it work.
I think it's all of us.<eos> Unless we go first.<eos> Why don't we go first?<eos> God, this thing works. Okay?<eos> We can go up there, take 5 minutes, we could take a flag, plant it down, get our footprints down there, we're going to be the first people over there, okay?
But he's not stronger than all of us.<eos> Look, this place gave him his powers. But it gave us all of ours too.<eos> It's who we are now.<eos> Maybe it's who we're meant to be.<eos> We opened this door, we're gonna close it.
- Now!<eos> - Hey! It's clobbering time!<eos> This better work.<eos> Let's get the hell outta here!<eos> While the world may not know what you did to save it, the men and the women in this room do.
- Take a guess.<eos> - I don't know. You tell me.<eos> All right. You think we just warehouse it on the books?<eos> No.<eos> We just repackage it with a bunch of other shit that didn't sell and put it into a CDO.
Look what I found down at the store.<eos> Is that a good idea?<eos> Oh, we don't- it's fine. -We don't have to.<eos> No, no, no, I think we'll be okay with one bottle.<eos> Let's open it.
Come on, John.<eos> Come on!<eos> Fig ht.<eos> Bye' "Go! '<eos> I can't- - I can't find it.
Go!<eos> Wow.<eos> [JUPITER GASPS]<eos> Are those flying boots?<eos> They use the force of gravity redirecting it into deferential equation slopes that you can surf.
Maybe you shouldn't have made me immortal.<eos> Kaulder, I came to help. Chloe.<eos> I told you not to...<eos> Immortality was never yours.<eos> You just carried it for me.
Here. Drink this.<eos> Thank you.<eos> The Witch Queen has returned.<eos> I thought my immortality was the way that she punished me.<eos> But she just used me to save it for herself.
You are not a member of the Russian royal family, are you?<eos> Are you a Romanov?<eos> Europe gave México many things.<eos> And perhaps México gave only one thing back, syphilis.<eos> It was known for a time as the "Mexican disease."
Europe gave México many things.<eos> And perhaps México gave only one thing back, syphilis.<eos> It was known for a time as the "Mexican disease."<eos> Then as the "Spanish disease."<eos> The Spanish gave it to Italians in southern Italy.
- Oh, you like durian?<eos> - Sure, yeah, love it.<eos> Uh, just like Mom used to make.<eos> I've, uh... it's a ritual I have.<eos> I use the menu and I slam it shut. I work it like a butterfly... and I get the aroma of the kitchen in.
- Get on the ground!<eos> - Drop it!<eos> - Get down!<eos> - Drop the gun now.<eos> Put it on the ground.
Once, when I was six years old, I read a book about the primeval forest.<eos> The book said, "Boa constrictors swallow their prey whole, without chewing it."
Well, I did.<eos> Not very good, is it?<eos> I think it's nice.<eos> I... I read the story, too. Attentively.<eos> Hence, I found it quite odd.
Ifs not safe.<eos> Sir, please go back to your rooms.<eos> Until the situation is over.<eos> Are you gonna even use your goggles?<eos> I feel like you never use it.
Chappie.<eos> Now, your job now is to get one of Daddy's cars back... so we can get the money.<eos> Who do I get the car from?<eos> I told you, from the naughty man who took Daddy's car from me.<eos> So now you're gonna take the gun and you point it at him.
Okay.<eos> Now what?<eos> Consciousness is like energy.<eos> This helmet reads the energy from you and me.<eos> I need to figure out how to get it out.
Yes.<eos> It's in Farsi, but a medieval form of it.<eos> Can you read it?<eos> Umm.<eos> "With them, the seed of wisdom did I sow, "and with my own hand, laboured it to grow."
Miss Bell, welcome!<eos> Welcome back!<eos> Before we talk business, allow me to congratulate you on your feat of alluding the Turkish authorities.<eos> Well, I had a permit, if you know what I mean.<eos> Ohh.. how did you forge it?
Wanna come to my house and take a shower?<eos> Maybe make a list of goals?<eos> Oh, I have a girlfriend.<eos> Great. It's important to have a lady out there in the street.<eos> What do you call it, a road bitch or something?
All right.<eos> Geernt!<eos> Hi, there.<eos> Dropping off paint.<eos> I'll put it by the pool.
Bye Dan.<eos> You think Cahill has something?<eos> Maybe.<eos> I just don't think the story is for us.<eos> - Ben likes it?
You!<eos> Put it down!<eos> Put it... - Put your weapons down!<eos> - Drop it! Drop your weapon!<eos> You! Drop it.
Put it... - Put your weapons down!<eos> - Drop it! Drop your weapon!<eos> You! Drop it.<eos> Drop the gun!<eos> Drop it!
Tonight, the 12 District leaders will call for a free election.<eos> There's little doubt that Paylor will carry it.<eos> She's become the voice of reason.<eos> I'm sorry so much burden fell on you.<eos> I know you'll never escape it.
How is this a good idea?<eos> Move or sink, kid.<eos> You were actually prepared for that?<eos> - My hat.<eos> - Leave it.
You grabbed a signal from another dimension.<eos> From a machine here.<eos> That means it's transmitting there.<eos> What if it's not just predicting the future?<eos> It's broadcasting it.
But it looks like a lovely place to spend your last days.<eos> David... The Monitor is acting as an antenna.<eos> It isn't just receiving tachyons.<eos> It is taking a possible future and...<eos> And amplifying it, transmitting it, like a feedback loop.
The bomb!<eos> Where is the bomb?<eos> One minute to detonation.<eos> 45 seconds.<eos> The bomb. What do I do? How do I turn it off?
What do we do?<eos> Nothing, I'm afraid.<eos> Don't have the tools to reset the bone.<eos> Do you have a pocket watch?<eos> Give it to me.
Victor, we cannot.<eos> No.<eos> Excellent!<eos> Expect to hear from me soon.<eos> You did not create this technology and yet you presume to tell me how to use it.
We have discovered that by using emotional cues we can teach them primitive belief systems.<eos> Of course, it's only because they are not yet capable of higher logical thought.<eos> Where is the creature now? Dead.<eos> Poor thing.<eos> Had to be put down, didn't it?
Thank you.<eos> I don't know what to do.<eos> You're already doing it.<eos> Frankenstein, open this door!<eos> We'll break it down!
We have to get out of here!<eos> And let them have my machines?<eos> Not bloody likely!<eos> Trap door to the sewers... it's the only way out.<eos> Try and open it.
The rotation of the Earth.<eos> The biggest obstacle in opening a wormhole is creating enough energy.<eos> Not unlike the tremendous amount of energy that an entire planet makes as it spins on its axis.<eos> The power is there.<eos> I didn't have to generate it.

I didn't have to generate it.<eos> I just thought of a way to utilize it.<eos> Kind of like us.<eos> I mean, the energy's there.<eos> We just got to think of a way to use it.
He knew that I needed a correlative between side "a" and side "b" to prove that the machine works.<eos> Otherwise, it's just a bunch of blinking lights.<eos> I mean, if I send the dahlia back to myself, then he owns my machine.<eos> Wait, what are you doing?<eos> I'm taking it back to its rightful owner.
You can at least buy me breakfast first.<eos> Jim: The biggest obstacle in opening a wormhole is creating enough energy.<eos> Not unlike the tremendous amount of energy that an entire planet makes as it spins on its axis.<eos> The power is there.<eos> I just thought of a way to utilize it.
Hey, look!<eos> The house of cards! Wait.<eos> Hang on just a minute.<eos> - Your rocket! - Yeah.<eos> I stashed it in there for safekeeping, and now I'm all set to take Riley to the moon!
I'm glad.<eos> Grateful I still can.<eos> You're afraid you're making me break my vows.<eos> But the vow comes out of the love behind it.<eos> Love's so rare that when you find it you can't doubt it.
I mean, it just seems like someone with your skills, you'd be better off inventing technology rather than installing it.<eos> No, of course.<eos> I would love to do somethin' different.<eos> You know, I had my shot when I was a kid in the arcades.<eos> But I blew it.
Now, what befell Jane is very troubling to all of us, and we would like to help you to set it right.<eos> Shall I have the men saddle up?<eos> Well, with respect...<eos> I, uh... I prefer to ride alone.<eos> If you cannot hold your tongue, I will cut it out of your head.
I'm retired.<eos> How old are you?<eos> I was born September 20, 1980, in Phoenix, Arizona.<eos> That's specific.<eos> Very specific. Actually, I started a company, and then I sold it later. Doesn't matter.
- Hello?<eos> - Mr. O'Neill?<eos> Yes?<eos> I have a message from Damian Hale.<eos> I think you'll wanna hear it.
It's an earthy Bordeaux, and it pairs wonderfully with I'm going to rape you.<eos> Look, over there!<eos> It appears the better man has won!<eos> -Don't worry, you'll still get a chance to be with her.<eos> -I will? I'm going to go to walgreens and buy a shitty devil mask and fuck her silly while I wear it.
This is just bad design.<eos> Your invite has been sent to entire galaxy!<eos> Uh-oh.<eos> "Uh-oh" is right!<eos> Our enemy, the Gorg, will receive it... and can use directions for to find us!
Next!<eos> What if we logged into the fugitive Boov's email... and cancelled his e-vite--<eos> Or we could log into the fugitive Boov's email... and cancel his invitation, and...<eos> What was that?<eos> So the Gorg never receive it.

And as I wipe a weepy tear from my eye let me say this...<eos> I'm not one who holds high principles, but when a man shakes my hand... and says he's gonna do something, I expect him to follow through.<eos> Now you be here before the end of business Tuesday and sign those papers, and bid this town a fond farewell or suffer the fucking consequences.<eos> Well, I ain't gonna just sit here pretending that you and I have ever seen eye to eye on, well... pretty much anything.<eos> Reason I ain't coming here begging for forgiveness is because I don't think I deserve it.
Can I get anybody a Chum Burger?<eos> Enough with the niceties, Plankton!<eos> This is the last time I'm going to ask you.<eos> Where is me formuler?<eos> I told you, Krabs, I don't have it.
- Patrick!<eos> SpongeBob!<eos> Why aren't you at The Krusty Krab making Krabby Patties?<eos> Well, I'd love to, but the formula's gone.<eos> Yeah, Mr. Krabs says you and Plankton took it.
Well, I'd love to, but the formula's gone.<eos> Yeah, Mr. Krabs says you and Plankton took it.<eos> No, that's not what happened.<eos> It just disappeared.<eos> We're putting a team together to find it.
A refugee boat.<eos> It was sunk by terrorists.<eos> Why can't I feel my body?<eos> Mira, your body was damaged.<eos> We couldn't save it.
A ghost hunter.<eos> And possibly my fur coat.<eos> I'd forgotten how beautiful the view is up here.<eos> I see you found your coat.<eos> Well, you promised to take care of it for me.
Which is the long way of saying he got you a new ride.<eos> World went and got an upgrade since you died, Cage.<eos> Onboard drones, anti-air countermeasures, and fuel tanks big enough to circumnavigate the globe three times without ever landing.<eos> You can check your coat.<eos> I promise you, no one would dare steal it.
X takes care of its own.<eos> You got to be kidding.<eos> We failed.<eos> Xander, Marke activated the satellite and it's headed right for us.<eos> I'm gonna have to take it out kamikaze style.
Do you still have the golden bird?<eos> Oh, Nanny Jo.<eos> You don't even remember it, do you?<eos> No, of course I do.<eos> I don't know why I should be embarrassed about this, but I lost it almost immediately after you gave it to me.
- Never heard of it.<eos> - I have.<eos> A planet of legend, ruled by a ruthless overlord.<eos> Stories I was told it was merciless and sinister but ruthless will work.<eos> When they rediscovered this planet, they quarantined it.
What's going on in here?<eos> None of your business, Nosey.<eos> Well, all right.<eos> If that vegetable hat can tell us that Hefty is strong, maybe it can tell me what an Ette is.<eos> Power it up, Brainy.
Clumsy, pull the lever!<eos> Seriously?<eos> But you said not to.<eos> Is this a trick?<eos> Pull it now!
- What did you tell him?<eos> - The truth.<eos> That it was a family heirloom.<eos> I just didn't tell him it wasn't my family.<eos> I almost gave it to him.
I'll send you your share.<eos> That doesn't work for me, Veronika.<eos> I'll just blow it all on smack.<eos> All right.<eos> I'll send it to Gail, then.
- That's it. - That's it.<eos> Yes, that's it.<eos> This way, please.<eos> To the east wing.<eos> Or as I like to call it, the only wing.
I'm never gonna tell you.<eos> Then you're gonna have to say what was on it.<eos> Ooh, I know.<eos> Give me his fuck-you finger.<eos> Yeah, split it open.
-I was going to...<eos> I do not remember what I' was going to.<eos> - If it were released, the cargo would have pulled into Titan's atmosphere.<eos> - The container was designed to withstand re-entry and landing.<eos> -How do we locate it?
You hold it right there.<eos> Now, outside my class, I found our school's 1971 championship bat in the trash can.<eos> I'm wondering who put it in there and why.<eos> We thought it'd be funny to throw out the bat and put the computer in with porn.<eos> Put it back.
Yes, sir.<eos> The foot's coming off right now.<eos> But before it comes off, let me just explain myself here.<eos> A very important announcement.<eos> If anyone finds a two-inch penis, please return it to Principal Tyler.
Yep, gone for good.<eos> I thought she was gonna fire-bomb that pathetic barge of yours.<eos> Would have improved the neighbourhood.<eos> I loved that mug.<eos> I found it on my first dive in Poole harbour.
I respect that.<eos> But it's people like you lost us support back home.<eos> You're not actually gonna blame the people without guns for losing the war, are you?<eos> Camera's way more dangerous than a gun.<eos> And we didn't lose the war, we abandoned it.
You don't like the way I'm running things?<eos> You know where the door is.<eos> You set this in motion when you put this place on the map.<eos> And I will not cut and run.<eos> I know an enemy when I see it.
Bitch, please!<eos> Slivko, get her out of there!<eos> You know it's the wrong thing to do, son.<eos> (SNIFFLES)<eos> Put it down, Sir.
Yeah, I'm John Watson.<eos> Dr Watson.<eos> - I love his blog. Don't you?<eos> - His blog?<eos> - Don't you read it?
Well...<eos> Parting gift.<eos> Aww, that's nice.<eos> A walking stick.<eos> Yeah, it was mine from a long time ago.
It's Sunday morning, - so it's closed.<eos> - What about Mrs Hudson?<eos> Going by her usual routine, I estimate she has another two minutes left.<eos> She keeps her vacuum cleaner at the back of the flat.<eos> So? So, safer there, when she's putting it away.
You hear that?<eos> Sherrinford.<eos> I never heard that one before.<eos> "Sherrinford."<eos> Forget you ever heard it.
Do you shoot tasers out of your face?<eos> It's metaphorical!<eos> Yeah!<eos> For what?<eos> For it is a name what strikes fear... into the hearts of anyone what hears it.
Just a different way of saying goodbye.<eos> I like it. Talk tomorrow?<eos> I'm not going anywhere.<eos> Where'd you get this movie?<eos> One of the German scientists who was here last month left it behind.
I mistook my stubborn will for a sense of... destiny or something.<eos> I never counted the cost of what it would actually mean for my life.<eos> - And you got the job? - Yeah.<eos> I fought the whole way for it.<eos> I earned it.
What kind of things?<eos> Are we on the right side of this?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Did you know that some gang called the Yang Clan had a deal with Patel before we made that pier acquisition?<eos> Someone was using it.
What are these for?<eos> 'Cause I need a drink. And you're going to join me, because I hate drinking alone.<eos> Glass.<eos> Back in the monastery, Brother Kuo would... harvest plums every summer to make wine.<eos> He used to hide it in these big clay pots, have it ferment in the bell tower over the winter.
I liked it, too.<eos> You know, this cloak of... I don't know, bravado that you have...<eos> I know why you wear it.<eos> I do the same thing.<eos> It keeps people at bay, but... you know that you don't have to wear it with me.
That's what an Iron Fist is.<eos> Why are you so interested in the Iron Fist?<eos> I've spent my entire life in and around dojos and monasteries, training with masters of all kinds... listening to their stories and legends about Immortal Weapons.<eos> I thought they were fairy tales for children... until I was gifted that film.<eos> Once I saw it, I became obsessed, learning all that I could about the Iron Fist. What it was capable of.
Hi.<eos> You startled me.<eos> What are you doing in here?<eos> I was just looking for my laptop.<eos> Yeah, I lent it to Ricky, and I thought he might have left it in here.
She'll find her peace.<eos> I pray you find yours as well.<eos> You always liked this spot.<eos> It's a miracle... the fact that this park even exists.<eos> The fact that this city hasn't torn it down to put up high-rises.
This was in my first life.<eos> Before I made the pilgrimage to K'un-Lun.<eos> Before I learned of the substance. And before I started the organization.<eos> And she was intelligent, kind...<eos> And death took her from me before I learned how to defeat it.
What do you mean, "resurrected"?<eos> His ex-girlfriend.<eos> - Now he thinks he can save her.<eos> - That's why you nearly got us killed?<eos> When I said her name, she recognized it. She knew me.
I doubt we will see him again.<eos> Do you now?<eos> You stabbed the devil in the back, and forced him back into the life that he had just left.<eos> You incinerated the priest's temple.<eos> Burned it to the ground.
And it could be too late,<eos> Give one room on them,<eos> You know it,<eos> This control of the generator,<eos> We had to turn it off, So Warren could destroy this structure,
You love me.<eos> And you're not gonna to shoot me<eos> You should've given him the case, cause I won't chase you<eos> Okay<eos> I will just take it from a dead girl
I can't.<eos> This thing's going into attack mode<eos> The door's not gonna open until you pull the chip<eos> Tez we got no idea what the hell we are looking for<eos> I got it
But just before we get into all of that, Let me ask you one question<eos> - You can ask me anything<eos> - Anything<eos> What's my last name?<eos> When you guys figured it out, then I guess you can let me know
Well, now he is returned.<eos> And Delaney's will leaves him everything.<eos> Including Nootka.<eos> Do we have a copy of the Nootka Sound treaty yet?<eos> Where perhaps our lawyers could pick it apart?
Yes?<eos> From Mr Delaney.<eos> 'I'm planning to journey to heaven, James.<eos> 'I've realised the truth.<eos> 'My cage is my flesh, I can shed it.
Hello?<eos> And sometime lobbyist who had thought the war in Afghanistan to be entirely pointless.<eos> Are you fucking kidding me?<eos> I'm not going there.<eos> Until he was offered a lot of money to sell it.
Yes, sir. We've got a problem.<eos> Somebody leaked your report.<eos> The Washington Post has a copy.<eos> No.<eos> - Somebody gave it to Bob Woodward.
It's called "Crucible,"<eos> based on Arthur Miller's play...<eos> So what happened with the dance?<eos> No, we...<eos> I actually never ended up doing it.
There you go.<eos> Oh, my gosh.<eos> Why does my head feel so heavy?<eos> Can you feel my head, please?<eos> Feel it.
I was home on my mom's bed.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> My pants were around my ankles, - wearing this lame sweatshirt. - I...<eos> It was a hand-me-down from my cousin, and...<eos> I had to throw it away.
Oh, my God.<eos> My pants were around my ankles, - wearing this lame sweatshirt. - I...<eos> It was a hand-me-down from my cousin, and...<eos> I had to throw it away.<eos> I... couldn't look at it after it was over.
So, leave in five?<eos> You promised you'd help us.<eos> We still need to find the rift.<eos> I didn't promise I'd help you commit suicide.<eos> If you can't help, we can find it ourselves.
But, uh, the closest he could get was "mischief."<eos> His mother called him that until...<eos> I remember when, uh... When Stiles first got his Jeep.<eos> It belonged to his mother.<eos> She wanted him to have it.
We saw it disappear.<eos> You remembered Stiles and then a new rift was created.<eos> If the Sheriff can do it...<eos> Maybe we can. But that rift closed.<eos> Then we'll open it again.
Even successive strikes.<eos> Mason, are you sure this is gonna work?<eos> Well, whatever's inside this cage is shielded from any outside electrical current.<eos> So the Ghost Rider won't be able to use lightning to escape.<eos> We put a lightning rod on the roof and connected it to that conduit cable.
The train.<eos> It's coming.<eos> Okay, and how do we stop that?<eos> You can't stop it.<eos> But you can divert it.
Pre-FBI.<eos> Well, I guess we're not the same kids running around the woods looking for a body.<eos> No, we're not.<eos> You know, you can keep the Jeep.<eos> No, I... I want you to have it.
Julia!<eos> See?<eos> I told you there was a bird.<eos> Julia!<eos> But I saw it.
I don't mean existentially, I mean physically.<eos> Sensationally.<eos> Are you in your body, but not of it?<eos> I'm in my body.<eos> I feel it.
Rain.<eos> Rain.<eos> It was raining.<eos> You hear the rain?<eos> You hear it?
Rain.<eos> It was raining.<eos> You hear the rain?<eos> You hear it?<eos> Find it.
You hear it?<eos> Find it.<eos> Tell me when you've found it.<eos> Come here, Chris. Look at me.<eos> I found it.
The hammer.<eos> The one I used to kill.<eos> It's dull now, but...<eos> The secret to keeping it clean is use.<eos> Yeah, blood feeds it, gives it shine.
Stopping someone from going upstairs to end their life.<eos> When we die, what if we travel to an alternate version of our own life?<eos> A second chance?<eos> Then we wouldn't... just have to accept our biggest regret.<eos> In the afterlife, we could change it.
Did you expect it when you first shot it?<eos> Did you think it was gonna go...<eos> That big?<eos> No. 2008 I was on set shooting a movie, and during my downtime I was checking my messages, and it was Drewfrom Hustler, and Drew said, "Hey",<eos> "we want to shoot a movie about Sarah Palin, and we want to call it "Nailin' Paylin."
I was, you know, their first porn.<eos> - In the '80s when it was cool to be a porn star... - Yeah. ...and celebrities wanted to meet you,<eos> I'm 21 years old,<eos> I'm sitting in this old Hollywood, dark wood, red leather seat restaurant, and I'm in between my attorney and Milton Berle, and Milton Berle unzips his pants and whips his dick out.<eos> Just whips it right out in the restaurant right in front of me.
I'm sitting in this old Hollywood, dark wood, red leather seat restaurant, and I'm in between my attorney and Milton Berle, and Milton Berle unzips his pants and whips his dick out.<eos> Just whips it right out in the restaurant right in front of me.<eos> And I'm trying to maintain eye contact, but it's very difficult.<eos> I kept looking down at it.<eos> He never tried anything, didn't try to touch me, didn't play with it, he just whipped it out and let it hang the whole dinner... the whole lunch.
But then I went before the court.<eos> So we had to moved it up to the California Supreme Court.<eos> Fornication in a public place, that was the charge.<eos> And I said, "Man, I'm not sticking my dick in these women."<eos> I'm moving it to the side.
I mean, no.<eos> Have you ever heard of the male gaze?<eos> The...? No.<eos> Well, we have.<eos> And we're not totally sure what it means, but you have it.
I like this new... angry, Audi-keying Clay.<eos> He's got spunk.<eos> I think I'm losing my shit.<eos> Shit's overrated.<eos> Lose it.
People are just mean, Tony.<eos> They're messed up.<eos> Zach didn't throw away the letter, you know that?<eos> No, I didn't know that.<eos> He showed it to me.
They're messed up.<eos> Zach didn't throw away the letter, you know that?<eos> No, I didn't know that.<eos> He showed it to me.<eos> Asked if I wanted to read it.
Zach didn't throw away the letter, you know that?<eos> No, I didn't know that.<eos> He showed it to me.<eos> Asked if I wanted to read it.<eos> And I couldn't... read it because... it's starting to make sense to me... why she did what she did.
So she dug at that rock in the road with her hands till they bled, used everything she had to pull it out.<eos> It took hours.<eos> And then when she was gonna fill it up, she saw something in it.<eos> All right.<eos> The king had put that rock in the road because he knew the person who dug it out, who did something, they deserved a reward.
Jared, get the hell up!<eos> Let's get the hell out of here.<eos> Can I...<eos> Can I have my stick back, please?<eos> Someone gave it to me.
The dead are quite inconsiderate when it comes to those who are wanting to be alone.<eos> I thought our efforts would be quiet enough to fall beneath your notice.<eos> You're the one who opened the door.<eos> Tripped my wire.<eos> Thought I caught it in time.
I, uh... I'm not a farmer.<eos> I need some help here.<eos> No, you don't.<eos> I saw a wild blueberry bush growing outside.<eos> If it's young enough, I'm gonna pull it up and replant it here.
Go get the groceries.<eos> Did you get more yogurt?<eos> Nope. Wasn't on the list.<eos> I always eat yogurt.<eos> Well, then you should have put it on the list.
Thank you.<eos> Whoa, what are you doing?<eos> Nothing.<eos> You just have a lint.<eos> Got it.
You, young lady, one in a billion.<eos> Wow. Lucky me.<eos> Well, you are lucky because we can remove it.<eos> Not today, because the tumor is right up beside your thyroid.<eos> So we have to use chemotherapy to shrink the tumor down to a size where we can get around it.
I'm Derrick Flout.<eos> Derrick, very nice to meet you.<eos> So nice to meet you, Derrick.<eos> Likewise.<eos> So, uh, you should know what I do is accept your loan application, or not, and hand it over to the underwriting department, most likely located in another state.
Well, old chief. Sorry, Chief.<eos> Oh, you don't like them? It's not that I don't like them.<eos> I don't like them, but that's not...<eos> The old way works just fine.<eos> Type out a report, send it via telex.
No more sugarcoating.<eos> And no more hiding.<eos> It was on her finger. A gold engagement ring with three diamonds on it.<eos> - Well, I can assure you...<eos> - Someone fucking took it!
It was the Mercedes that caught her eye.<eos> A janitor's wife don't get that kind of ride at home.<eos> Right. Yeah, yeah.<eos> That's right.<eos> Yeah, I remember after Papa Gene popped him across the face, he ripped that hood ornament off his car. He brought it home. He put it back on his Caprice.
A janitor's wife don't get that kind of ride at home.<eos> Right. Yeah, yeah.<eos> That's right.<eos> Yeah, I remember after Papa Gene popped him across the face, he ripped that hood ornament off his car. He brought it home. He put it back on his Caprice.<eos> What did he call it?
I mean, this is something.<eos> I mean, I've heard the stories about how crazy you are, but actually seeing it?<eos> Seeing it firsthand? I mean, it's truly astonishing.<eos> So...<eos> I'm gonna give you back that fancy tear catcher you gave me, 'cause you're gonna need it more than me.
- I know where to get some.<eos> You achieved glory by killing a load of fascists, then just walked away.<eos> I left when it was over.<eos> Glory only lasts a second.<eos> I experienced it and then I split.
It's what I've always wanted: To die. And this way, at least, my death will achieve something.<eos> Just promise you'll look after them, and never leave them.<eos> I promise.<eos> I don't want to be buried with the winners.<eos> A war can only end well if it's lost.
I'm close to getting some big money, okay?<eos> How big?<eos> There's a safe. It's full of cash<eos> There's got to be $100,000 or more.<eos> I'm going to get somebody to open it this morning so I can clock the combination, and then I got an appointment with Mr. Success at 2:00 this afternoon.
Well, if you want, yeah, I can go with you. You can show me how to write up a bond.<eos> I thought that's what we were doing here in the office.<eos> Julia, don't begrudge me time with my grandson.<eos> It's been 20 years for goodness' sake.<eos> Good. The only thing is I finally convinced my former employer to release my final paycheck, so I just have to go to the city at 2:00 to pick it up.
You hungry?<eos> - What?<eos> - Let's get lunch.<eos> You know, I'd love to, but I got to go get that paycheck.<eos> Have them send it to you.
Well, then I don't see how I can say no, as much as I would like to.<eos> Thank you very much.<eos> That's very gracious of you.<eos> What would you suggest I do with the check?<eos> You can send it to 6325 Quiet Oak Highway,
I'm not here to draw conclusions.<eos> I'm here to find objective evidence of a parallel nuclear program.<eos> Forgive me, but I have doubts about your objectivity.<eos> Everyone knows you support a deal with Iran.<eos> Just as everyone knows you're already convinced they're cheating on it.
And you will tell Dar Adal this?<eos> I will.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You must be gratified. And you're disappointed.<eos> Just because I believe in the merits of the deal doesn't mean I'm any less concerned about Iran cheating on it.
So they just saw the light of day and let you go out of the goodness of their hearts.<eos> What are you saying?<eos> I'm saying...<eos> Pressure was applied.<eos> I applied it.
Ma'am, can I get you anything?<eos> My staff.<eos> What's going on?<eos> Back up. The van that delivered the bombs...<eos> Sekou was driving it.
- No. No.<eos> No "but."<eos> No anything.<eos> After you pressured me, for old times' sake, I did exactly what I'm supposed to do.<eos> I filled out a contact report and I sent it up the chain.
For example, she brought a mentally disturbed veteran, Peter Quinn, into her home.<eos> I-I thought I explained that?<eos> This led to an incident which Mr. Quinn held Franny and her nanny hostage for several hours.<eos> I described it in detail in my report.<eos> I've read it.
I expect you to keep everything gleamingly clean.<eos> "Gleamingly"?<eos> Clean.<eos> The stove is a bit like a servant.<eos> You have to whack it sometimes to get it to work.
- Guys.<eos> - Well, I'm stumped, Officer.<eos> Tell you what. If you Agatha Christie yourself to the bottom of this, you come back here and tell me who done it.<eos> Meanwhile, why don't you take that roach and shove it up your ass?<eos> - Shove it up my ass? - Yeah.
There's an alien inside of me?<eos> I bet your teacher sometimes thinks so.<eos> Well, we have another question from 8-year-old Mari.<eos> Are you bringing the alien back to Earth?<eos> No, we're gonna keep it up here. We're gonna study it where it's safe.
And how does he feel now?<eos> Like a bird.<eos> Don't get me wrong.<eos> I don't hate my chair.<eos> I love it.
Like a bird.<eos> Don't get me wrong.<eos> I don't hate my chair.<eos> I love it.<eos> For the sake of the anonymous genius who invented it.
- No.<eos> They're independent systems.<eos> Can we run a diagnostic from here?<eos> The transmitter has failed.<eos> But we have to go outside to access it and get Earth back online.
I use the oxygen candles to lure Calvin into Boat A.<eos> I close the hatch.<eos> I press the button to give me full manual control.<eos> And if I can hold the stick, I can override the flight path.<eos> And if I hold it long enough, I can avoid reentry.
It will escort you to Alterplex command in a few seconds.<eos> Remain where you are.<eos> Since the dawn of humankind we have reached for dreams beyond our grasp.<eos> We gazed at the birds and built planes to fly.<eos> We gazed at the moon and built rockets to reach it.
Dr. Brennan.<eos> I think you need to come with me.<eos> Let's find you a place to sit down.<eos> No.<eos> Dr. Faulk warned us someone would insert themselves into the case, manipulate it.
And I really need your advice.<eos> Oh, I would say "shoot," but you did once put a bullet in my arm.<eos> I need you to level with me.<eos> Do you think I really have a chance of landing that lead anthropologist job?<eos> 'Cause the thought of not getting it makes me feel like such a failure.
Hattie Finnegan?<eos> I-I don't know who that is.<eos> Oh, she's a resident who died a month ago.<eos> Wait, this account is still active. Yeah.<eos> And someone has been using it to sell prescription medication online.
And I take it those are Dr. Sweets' session notes--<eos> - All of them with-with Dr. Addy?<eos> - Yes. Booth and I already read through all of them hoping to find something that could exonerate Zack.<eos> But, uh, we could definitely use someone of your expertise.<eos> Um, Agent Aubrey, if you were to yield to your desire, rather than fight it, I think you might be able to return to the matter in hand.
Get your food off my car. Ooh.<eos> Nice set of tools, too.<eos> There blood on that wrench?<eos> Bro, I don't know who the hell you think you are, but if you don't pick that up, there's gonna be a hell of a lot more blood on this wrench.<eos> Put it down.
No. Dustin isn't saying anything, Ray.<eos> Dustin's dead.<eos> I don't believe you.<eos> I think you're trying to trick me.<eos> Ray, I could trick you by pretend throwing a ball and palming it in my hand.
According to this, there might be one left.<eos> Hayley. You looked for five years.<eos> You found nothing.<eos> Suddenly, I get word of a lead.<eos> What if someone else found it, too?
Does it help with the guilt, given what you are?<eos> What did you say?<eos> Keelin, you need to listen to me.<eos> - How do you know my name?<eos> - Got it from a friend.
Were you drunk?<eos> - No. Butterflies are classic.<eos> - They're retarded.<eos> Okay, I'm sorry I didn't have your artistic eye to advise me, so I got a retarded butterfly.<eos> I mean, it's pretty.
- I'm not crazy about your name.<eos> - What?<eos> "Ellen" doesn't suit you.<eos> It's too old-fashioned.<eos> - I've never really liked it.
- What?<eos> "Ellen" doesn't suit you.<eos> It's too old-fashioned.<eos> - I've never really liked it.<eos> - So, change it.
You'll be okay.<eos> - You're gonna sleep, anyway.<eos> - Yeah, I'm tired.<eos> There's a bedpan here.<eos> So, if you need it...
And you will pay.<eos> You didn't mention my garden.<eos> Well, your garden is part of your backyard, so it's automatically included in the property that goes to Jenn.<eos> It comes with the house, Mom.<eos> Well, I think you need to mention it by name in case some dirty judge decides to play tricks.
Half a rainbow?<eos> Don't you want to keep going till you do the whole thing? No.<eos> If you're done, I'm done.<eos> You know, your clients seem to like that rainbow.<eos> Think they're gonna miss it?
Anyway, the point is that shit's expensive, like, real pricey.<eos> And my mom works really hard to make tuition.<eos> She's a receptionist at this healthcare place, and I don't qualify for financial aid 'cause my dad has problems with the IRS.<eos> Just another fucked up story from a dysfunctional girl.<eos> Anyway, so I stole a check and used it for drugs.
So all this is just a bunch of bullshit?<eos> Including the key?<eos> No, the key was real.<eos> And it means everything.<eos> But I actually never wanted you to find it.
I need a bathroom!<eos> Now, now, no premature eruptions.<eos> We need everything you've got.<eos> Aki, whatever... whatever you're thinking about doing, you don't have to do it, you don't have to...<eos> If you want the best apple, you've gotta pluck it straight from the tree.
I'm not. I'm not smart enough.<eos> Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, slugger.<eos> No, no, it's not your fault.<eos> All right, so plan B. If we have the controller, he can't hurt us.<eos> So we steal it from this dandy nutsack, shock him till he drops, and get the hell out of here.
The race is mine!<eos> Oh, please.<eos> You can't out-dandy me.<eos> There's a reason you failed.<eos> Care to hear it?
Move it.<eos> Hey, dude... welcome to paradise!<eos> Can I get a beer?<eos> Ah, I am loving this little pit stop.<eos> Yeah, we'll see how much you love it when we lose the race and our heads explode.
He ordered the number three with potatoes and coffee... went bold with the extra salsa... and he paid cash out of his left front pocket.<eos> Took his tray of food, sat in a booth on the east side of the restaurant... and put the knapsack on the floor.<eos> Where on the floor?<eos> Under his seat, between his legs.<eos> Nobody touched it.
I have to get back to work.<eos> Don't writers work in coffee shops? Not all types.<eos> You want me to take you on a tour?<eos> Well, as long as you promise to give me that coffee after, sure.<eos> - I'll make it extra special.
- take a shit in my hand.<eos> - Mmm-hmm. And, um... I did.<eos> - I... I took a shit in my hand.<eos> - Okay.<eos> And then I, like... walked around the party for, like, an hour, just, like, carrying this turd in my hand and introducing it to people, like,
You're done. - You can't kill me.<eos> - Watch me.<eos> I surrender to the authority of the Clave.<eos> Aw, look at you.<eos> You got your stick all ready to go and now you can't use it.
How do you know that's what he was telling you?<eos> There's no other explanation.<eos> When the demon touched the Sword, he and the Sword both disintegrated.<eos> Luke, it was a demon I'd never seen before.<eos> Then go find it.
Are you sure?<eos> She's about this tall, pigtails, always... wears a scarf.<eos> Hey, where'd you get that scarf?<eos> Nowhere.<eos> I found it.
As a last resort, the Soul-Sword will destroy every downworlder in its path.<eos> The angel Ithuriel.<eos> Valentine was going to use him to activate the Soul-Sword.<eos> Clary may have a blood connection to that angel. Clary can activate the Soul-Sword.<eos> If killing Clary is the price, then I'm willing to pay it.
I don't know where the Mortal Cup is.<eos> If you're lying, so help the Angel.<eos> If you were smart, Jace, you'd use me as bait.<eos> The only way to control a Greater Demon is with the Mortal Cup.<eos> Azazel would do anything to destroy it.
Sebastian, this isn't working. You wanted a brother so badly, because then at least you'd have someone to share in the pain.<eos> - Stop it!<eos> - I can't stop it, Clary.<eos> That empty feeling that eats away at your soul and makes you feel like you want to die, day after day after day, it never stops.<eos> Now take that pain and use it.
For Shado, it was.<eos> No time for Nostalgia.<eos> I know where they're going.<eos> Do either of you know anything about this place that could give us a tactical advantage?<eos> I've only seen it one time, and that was from a distance.
- A great script. - Yeah.<eos> Can you let Victor know that I liked...<eos> I don't know how to say... I loved the movie or I'm a big fan.<eos> Believe it or not, he thinks that movie sucks.<eos> Yeah, he gets really upset when I bring it up.
Where's Walker's man?<eos> Curtis and Rory are keeping eyes on him.<eos> I think she means protecting him from me.<eos> Oliver, I still think it's a mistake not pushing this scum bag for the location of the sale.<eos> We don't have to. We're gonna have it within the hour.
I'll keep you gentlemen posted on the status of this investigation.<eos> I wouldn't panic just yet.<eos> We don't even know if that report's legitimate.<eos> I think it's safe to say that it is.<eos> The question is who sent it to Pike?
I'll tell the vultures you're gonna be making a statement.<eos> Ok.<eos> Do you want me to write you a draft?<eos> No.<eos> I'll write it.
The D.A. came to me, and...<eos> You're referring to Adrian Chase?<eos> That's correct.<eos> He instructed me to revise the report to indicate that the Throwing Star Killer was responsible.<eos> This report, and you went ahead and signed it, even though you knew it was fake and then passed it along to the police.
"Hood."<eos> Da. Reports of man with a bow and arrow are disrupting business, Bratva and otherwise.<eos> That's interesting.<eos> I heard some reports of my own of--of you having trouble with Gregor because of his deal with me.<eos> I questioned it, yes.
According to the elevator activity logs, the car accelerated upwards at--oh, my God--9 Gs, and then it just dropped into a freefall for 40 stories. - Death by elevator.<eos> - This doesn't feel like Chase. No.<eos> At first, I thought maybe Chase was trying to tie up loose ends, but I couldn't find any connections between them.<eos> He had his Argus security key still on him.<eos> Why enter the elevator if not to take it?
The problem.<eos> After Damien Darhk took my security implant last year, I instituted new protocols to prevent any sensitive Argus information or location from being accessed by a single person.<eos> Access now requires two of these security keys.<eos> But Agent Pierce's key wasn't taken.<eos> You found it on him.
What's that thing made of anyway?<eos> Keltium.<eos> It's a proprietary alloy developed by the U.S. government to repel nuclear blasts.<eos> So you're saying even if we had a nuke down here, it wouldn't work?<eos> Seems like Cisco did such a good job of turning this place into an impenetrable fortress, he turned it into an impenetrable death trap.
Well, if they don't exert themselves, 5, maybe 6 hours.<eos> Ok.<eos> We're here.<eos> Now what?<eos> The mainframe has a built-in cellular chip, but our rewire didn't generate enough kilowatts to jump-start it.
Is that what you came here to tell me, or are you just wasting time? Heh.<eos> See you later.<eos> Ah, pain.<eos> It's fascinating, isn't it?<eos> Some men will do anything to avoid it.
No, I don't, but only because you're wrong.<eos> I told you, Oliver, everyone in your orbit suffers as the price for your sins.<eos> And the only way to keep them from paying that price is to let me go.<eos> I'm gonna find another way.<eos> Find it quick.
and not normally.<eos> He said if I ever took it off, it would cause great pain to my children.<eos> I hate it, but I'm afraid to take it off without knowing how to break the spell.<eos> Even if he's dead, it could still survive.<eos> We'll find a way to break it.
I don't want you getting drawn into this any more than you already have.<eos> I don't like it, but okay.<eos> We're still searching the Laurelhurst area, but so far, we got nothing.<eos> We've already checked several blocks away from the parked car.<eos> He dumped it there for us to find.
First time I've ever seen a death grip from a dead guy.<eos> I saw these symbols on his face when I was there... and also on the cloth.<eos> Maybe there was more on that cloth than we could see.<eos> Do you still have the stick with you? Yes.<eos> I'm not sure you should be carrying it all the time.
Yes. Of course.<eos> - I can leave tonight. - Thank you.<eos> I mean, that is, of course, not until I've shown you this fabulous Indian place around the corner.<eos> - My favorite.<eos> - Why do you think I picked it?
Oh, God.<eos> Don't waste your strength.<eos> Or, um... did you forget that you kept me prisoner in this god-forsaken basement for almost a year?<eos> I spent every single one of those nights fighting against those chains...<eos> If there were a way out, I would have found it.
Jonathan is alive.<eos> Jace?<eos> Is he okay? Where is he?<eos> I can only direct you toward the correct path.<eos> You must walk it yourself.
And you have it at the Institute, and it's... well-guarded, I presume?<eos> The Elite Guards are the only ones who know its location.<eos> It's safest that way.<eos> Jonathan went after Elliot and Dot to get the mirror.<eos> Now that he knows we have it, he's going to come back for it.
Wait, all of this would mean that Jonathan found a way to get inside the Institute - without us even knowing.<eos> - Well, he's Valentine's son.<eos> We were trained to do the impossible.<eos> If Jonathan attacked Max and he came for the mirror...<eos> He wouldn't have left here without it.
Your whip.<eos> You look like a man on a mission.<eos> Winthrop Gold is missing.<eos> My guess is that Jonathan's closing in on the mirror.<eos> I'm gonna go and guard it myself.
I don't know. - He got away somehow.<eos> Are you OK? Yeah.<eos> Did he get the mirror?<eos> No.<eos> And no one is ever going to use it to destroy the Downworld.
I'm not so sure.<eos> Look, even with our pure angel blood, doesn't it seem strange that Clary's runes would be powerful enough to destroy a Mortal Instrument?<eos> And why didn't it destroy the sword?<eos> What if the mirror I destroyed isn't the Mortal Mirror?<eos> Then why would your mom give it to the warlocks to protect?
Look, even with our pure angel blood, doesn't it seem strange that Clary's runes would be powerful enough to destroy a Mortal Instrument?<eos> And why didn't it destroy the sword?<eos> What if the mirror I destroyed isn't the Mortal Mirror?<eos> Then why would your mom give it to the warlocks to protect?<eos> Maybe she thought it was.
We need to leave.<eos> What happened? My position within the Institute was<eos> Where is the Mirror?<eos> I said, "Where is it?"<eos> Clary, uh... took it from me.
- Yeah.<eos> It's nice to see you again.<eos> It's the one thing I do for myself these days.<eos> Can I switch my appointment, too?<eos> Yes, you moved it later, and I have you down for Monday.
♪ Hot cross buns ♪<eos> - Hey, Claire.<eos> Cut it out!<eos> - Suckie, suckie, suckie.<eos> Suck it.
For your very best change.<eos> Have you ever heard of a vape?<eos> Hey, I can roll a fucking joint, okay?<eos> I think.<eos> You smoke it, then you talk shit.
♪ So I'm back to the velvet underground ♪<eos> I'm sorry, is this seat taken?<eos> Oh, um, well, I was saving it for someone, but he's late, so go ahead.
No, he's... he's... we're together.<eos> It's gonna get cold.<eos> - What?<eos> - The tea.<eos> My mother only ever drank it piping hot, so.
Mm, possibly something a bit more poetic?<eos> We're not poets, Tarly.<eos> Um, Archmaester, if I could just have a moment.<eos> This is your moment.<eos> Use it wisely.
What?<eos> You want coffee?<eos> Coffee?<eos> Come on.<eos> Come get it.
We've been really sweet to each other, so just... let goodbye be sweet as well, okay?<eos> Are you saying no?<eos> Drive.<eos> I really like this song.<eos> Will you sing it to me?
It's not our fault they found other ways to occupy their time.<eos> That's all you do, occupy their time.<eos> We gave back.<eos> We gave them meaning.<eos> Then give it to them again.
I can hear a voice hadn't had its fill of screaming.<eos> Well, I most definitely do not belong here.<eos> I was just at the pub for a cup of ale.<eos> Good lad.<eos> I was even gonna pay for it, when some flange cuts in front of me like fucking King fucking George.
You got this, Wallace!<eos> I don't know why you even ask him.<eos> What did Wells do with me?<eos> His plan was, more methodically constructed than John Doe's in "Seven."<eos> And he had a bit more time to work it out by, give or take, 15 years.
- What is it?<eos> - Everybody brace yourselves! - What's happening?<eos> We're gonna move the train.<eos> How are we gonna do that?<eos> I'll vibrate it.
- Everybody brace yourselves! - What's happening?<eos> We're gonna move the train.<eos> How are we gonna do that?<eos> I'll vibrate it.<eos> I'll vibrate it fast enough that it can phase through this.
- It's gone?<eos> - If Savitar gets ahold of the stone...<eos> He'll escape for sure.<eos> You can't get rid of that stone, Wallace.<eos> You're not fast enough to throw it into the Speed Force by yourself.
She's not breathing.<eos> We have to get an ambulance in here right now.<eos> H.R., grab the crash cart.<eos> Cisco, grab the oxygen.<eos> Wheel it over here!
What else is unique about shellac flakes?<eos> It's the fire accelerant used in all of the arson cases associated with Heat Monger.<eos> [scoffs] Such an embarrassing name.<eos> I like it.<eos> I think it's great.
I'd love to.<eos> By all means, you first.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Reminds me of "Jaws."<eos> They didn't show the shark because they couldn't afford to make it look good.
What... what? Why didn't it work?<eos> I spent an eternity in a trap just like that.<eos> You think I didn't know how to prevent it from happening again?<eos> The philosopher's stone.<eos> It's made of calcified Speed Force energy, and you gave it to me.
I mean to figure out how to get payback.<eos> And since our only weapon is currently traveling through Paris...<eos> - You mean the tuning fork?<eos> - Actually, it'sitctually called the staff of Arcadius.<eos> Cade's enemies forged it in the fire - that killed him.
I'm so sorry this happened to you.<eos> But you are going to forget that night at the hospital.<eos> You're going to clean up and turn your life around.<eos> When you get a check from Stefan Salvatore in the mail, you are not going to ask questions.<eos> You're gonna cash it and put that money to good use.
So I've been calling around about all of the hunters that died.<eos> Um, every one of them had years of experience.<eos> We got a letter from Eileen.<eos> Eileen?<eos> She sent it four days ago.
In an...actual rat?<eos> Wasn't too bad, really.<eos> Gave me time to think.<eos> You know, I've been focused for so long on keeping my job.<eos> Never realized I hate it.
- Mm-hmm.<eos> - Don't shoot!<eos> Don't shoot!<eos> - Shoot her! Shoot her!<eos> We threw it back over the fence.
And I hate not being in control of my life.<eos> My bedtime's when I say so.<eos> I don't let some pyramid tell me what food to eat.<eos> And I don't care what Titus says, I put my mittens on before my jacket.<eos> Then how do you zip or button it?
I'll take care of it.<eos> Well, tell your grandson to go pay Tony for his lunch.<eos> And here.<eos> Give him back his shitty watch.<eos> You can keep the bat. I bought it at Herb's 10 minutes ago.
And where did you hide it?<eos> I mean, the sound's pretty clear, so it wasn't in the couch cushions, was it?<eos> Tucked under a space blanket. Out of sight.<eos> Wow.<eos> So there's no chance i would see it. Not with the state your place was in.
I can't suddenly turn into... Commercial Guy.<eos> Hold on.<eos> Uh, repeat after me...<eos> Uh, "For a limited time, we'll shoot your commercial today<eos> "and have it on the air tomorrow." For a limited time, we'll shoot your commercial today and have it on air tomorrow.
Free.<eos> I'll shoot the spot for free.<eos> For free?<eos> You will shoot this spot for free?<eos> I'll film your ad, and I'll put it on the air.
Guys, I don't wanna get technical on ya, but that commercial... it doesn't actually belong to you.<eos> Look, it's the real and intellectual property of Saul Goodman Productions. I don't think so.<eos> I mean, it's our faces.<eos> - It's our store.<eos> - And it's my commercial. And you can't run it without my permission. - Oh.
Riverdale Police dragged Sweetwater River for Jason's body, but never found it.<eos> If he is dead, Hal, I hope in those last moments he suffered.<eos> May Jason Blossom burn in hell.<eos> So a week later, the Blossom family buried an empty casket and Jason's death was ruled an accident, as the story that Cheryl told made the rounds.<eos> That Cheryl dropped a glove in the water, and Jason reached down to get it, and accidentally tipped the boat, and panicked, and drowned.
The Register could really use a Lois Lane type like you.<eos> I think I know something that can help with the Blossom investigation.<eos> People are saying Cheryl heard a gunshot?<eos> That's what she's claiming, yes.<eos> I heard it, too.
You.<eos> She believes in you, Archie.<eos> So do I.<eos> Quite the expose.<eos> Whenever did you find the time to write it?
Make some room, outcasts.<eos> I'm having deja vu.<eos> Yeah, senior year, we're here, watching Candyman.<eos> God, I hated that movie.<eos> - You picked it. - Mmm.
- God bless.<eos> - Wearing what?<eos> The ring, Polly.<eos> That ring has been in the Blossom family for generations.<eos> You keep it close to your heart, always.
- Wearing what?<eos> The ring, Polly.<eos> That ring has been in the Blossom family for generations.<eos> You keep it close to your heart, always.<eos> But don't tell Penelope I gave it to you.
The ring, Polly.<eos> That ring has been in the Blossom family for generations.<eos> You keep it close to your heart, always.<eos> But don't tell Penelope I gave it to you.<eos> Or she'll likely come and snip it off your finger!
Hi, Mr. Andrews. - Hey.<eos> What's going on?<eos> Well, I was just, um, telling your mother...<eos> You know that SoDale contract?<eos> It was awarded to Andrews Construction.
I'm sorry, Ethel, for everything my family did to yours.<eos> It's not your fault what your dad did.<eos> And you were there for me when no one else was.<eos> More than once.<eos> Seat's not taken, if you want it.
What did you find?<eos> My nana's ring...<eos> Which she gave to Jason.<eos> He... He proposed to me with that ring.<eos> So how does your mother have it?
He... He proposed to me with that ring.<eos> So how does your mother have it?<eos> I...<eos> Hands off, Gollum.<eos> The only way your mom could have that ring is if she or your dad got it from Jason, and he wouldn't have given it up.
Well, not just at Thornhill. Town wide.<eos> You can feel it.<eos> Something wicked this way comes.<eos> Which reminds me, I loved your article.<eos> Good, because I already posted it on the Blue and Gold's website, with hardcopies in circulation tomorrow morning.
Come on.<eos> We're doing great.<eos> You're too hard on yourself.<eos> Can we talk about the earring?<eos> Look, you kept it for a reason, and I know you say that door is closed, but there are no absolutes.
You say you drove past Falls Lake that night.<eos> Yes.<eos> We pulled two bodies from the lake that night...<eos> Jim Blackwell, as I told you, and an unidentified female.<eos> Her body was too decomposed to I.D., but we're working on it.
You'd never know they were from Montgomery.<eos> - Tallulah's an actress.<eos> - Oh, is she, darling?<eos> I love your drawl, darling girl.<eos> Don't you ever lose it.
Mr. Broun.<eos> It's a pleasure.<eos> I read the "Tribune," of course.<eos> And I read your little debut novel, of course<eos> It was quite an interesting, let's see, what did I call it?
It's a pleasure.<eos> I read the "Tribune," of course.<eos> And I read your little debut novel, of course<eos> It was quite an interesting, let's see, what did I call it?<eos> We all know what you called it, Heywood. and we all know you were wrong.
Well, you were right.<eos> Just like riding a bicycle.<eos> So, you don't think my novel will stand the test of time?<eos> Well, I couldn't say.<eos> I haven't read it.
That'll be all, Tana.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Why are you sending Tana away?<eos> You didn't want to do any of this.<eos> Fine, I'll get it myself.
Or even a kiss?<eos> At what point do I even stop being a practicing Muslim?<eos> I might as well just start eating bacon.<eos> No one said anything about bacon, but you don't have to wear a hijab to be Muslim.<eos> - I can't just take it off on a whim.
Oh, my God.<eos> You get it.<eos> I didn't wear my hijab this morning because I was mad.<eos> But if I'm being honest, I never felt like myself wearing it.<eos> I didn't wear it back home, not until I was forced to.
- I hate it!<eos> And I hate you! - Maya!<eos> That mirror was my grandmother's.<eos> Whatever.<eos> I always thought it was ugly.
- And you agree?<eos> - Don't get cocky.<eos> - Because if that's the case,<eos> I'm gonna send you a terrific article from the New England Journal of Medicine about what to do in the 90 days following a stroke.<eos> I want you to read it out loud to yourself.
- Because if that's the case,<eos> I'm gonna send you a terrific article from the New England Journal of Medicine about what to do in the 90 days following a stroke.<eos> I want you to read it out loud to yourself.<eos> Fine.<eos> I will read it with a British accent.
Why?<eos> Uh, well...<eos> I know you've been to hell and back... but we're worried that "Last Exit" might be too inspiring.<eos> Like, too good?<eos> Sometimes one suicide attempt can lead to another, especially if it's glamorized or romanticized.
You never would have survived what I survived.<eos> I guess we'll never know.<eos> What are you going to do with that letter?<eos> I don't know yet.<eos> Who did you show it to?
I guess we'll never know.<eos> What are you going to do with that letter?<eos> I don't know yet.<eos> Who did you show it to?<eos> Where did you find it?
You're scared, aren't you?<eos> What are you scared of?<eos> You didn't commit any crimes.<eos> No one's going to hang you.<eos> You're scared I'll show it to Jon
Go!<eos> Now!<eos> You're faster without the hammer.<eos> Give it!<eos> Give it!
Something activates the latent virus and only Arias knows what it is.<eos> But until we find that out everyone, living and dead, are his potential weapons.<eos> If we don't figure this out now there won't be little towns like this for you to drink your sorrows away in ever again.<eos> I created a vaccine.<eos> And I tried it on myself and it works.
- That's the one.<eos> 239 plus tax.<eos> Betcha I could get a discount.<eos> - How? - Negotiate and try me.<eos> You want it or not?
One of the airport's radiation detectors thought I was carrying a dirty bomb. Were you?<eos> I was carrying this.<eos> I found it on the farm when I was a kid, right by the pond.<eos> I was out there, uh, skipping rocks one day, and then I look down.<eos> There's a beautiful black stone, so I take it home.
Don't screw it up.<eos> Where are you taking me?<eos> Get out of here.<eos> You're will Bowman's other son.<eos> I knew your name at some point, but I'm afraid it's gone.
Where is it? There.<eos> Wait, hang on.<eos> Here we go.<eos> "He knew he had to write back or at least call" and tell them they could give away his spot.<eos> Somehow, he couldn't take the envelope from his back pocket and stick it in the mail.
Remember the last time we saw each other, we talked about, uh, your movie Patty-Cake?<eos> You know, the movie you watched the night that that monster dropped that body off on your front lawn.<eos> Yes, that was a terrifying evening.<eos> I shall never forget it.<eos> Well, I watched it because you got me intrigued by your performance.
A woman lay dead on your floor because of your fragile ego.<eos> And then you panicked.<eos> And you went to your neighbor's garage and you chopped her up to make it look like it was some sort of serial killer type thing.<eos> Your cuts were so profoundly sloppy because your hands were heavily creamed, the tools slipping in and out.<eos> And then you chopped up her body and threw it out on your front lawn.
There's something wrong with it.<eos> - Could I just have a sidebar?<eos> - Get the fuck away from me.<eos> Something wrong with it, like the toilet?<eos> We had a locksmith come out here the other day, and he couldn't open it.
What just happened?<eos> I believe we've fallen and we can't get up.<eos> No, my back.<eos> What just happened to my back?<eos> You hurt it trying to help me.
Just drive around town, lookin' for a gate that ain't there no more.<eos> Might as well just put that damn noose around my neck myself.<eos> - What the... - Goddamn!<eos> The hell you doing in my truck, you little piece of shit? !<eos> I was cleanin' it, and then I fell asleep.
- Hey, you know what, Judy?<eos> We were tryin' to keep a low profile here, so, you might wanna go somewhere to hose off and leave us be.<eos> Still mad at me after all these years, aren't you?<eos> - You stole my turntable.<eos> - You weren't using it.
Hey! What are you doing here?<eos> I saw the article.<eos> Grace, we've got a hit!<eos> It's just Bud, but it counts.<eos> - You read it? - Yeah, I read it.
No!<eos> I can't.<eos> "The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing."<eos> My father had that quote framed and hung in our living room.<eos> I saw it every day.
Rumor is I'm a bit of a snorer, so if it gets vexatious, just give me a nudge.<eos> You expecting someone?<eos> Just the stars.<eos> You ever consider that if the good Lord's gone missing, maybe He's got a reason?<eos> Yeah, and I wanna hear it.
Please. You can say no. Would you come with me?<eos> Can I show you something?<eos> God, yes.<eos> - I love this place, don't you?<eos> - Hate it.
It's so basic.<eos> It's so fucking basic.<eos> [Sheila] Oh, my... [grunts]<eos> - Would've been nice to have the lid.<eos> - [grunts] I couldn't find it.
- Yeah, I've noticed that too.<eos> Well, obviously, sweetie, I didn't know we'd be burying the container.<eos> What did you think, honeybunch?<eos> We'd take it home with us and clean it out and use it to store our taxes, which we can't do because it doesn't have a fucking lid.<eos> - Fine, I won't look for it.
It's exhausting.<eos> You know that saying, "Waiting for the other shoe to drop"?<eos> I do.<eos> It surfaced in the late 19th century when people started moving to big cities and living on top of each other in these massive apartment buildings, where night after night after night they had this shared experience where the tenants would hear their neighbors, like,<eos> by the thousands, come home after work, sit down, take off one shoe, drop it on the floor, right?
Yeah, I don't know if there's a word for them, but, I know what they do.<eos> They get inside your head, and feed.<eos> - On what?<eos> - Well, they feed on your sleep.<eos> Basically, they steal it.
We're looking for a little background information on a couple of the employees,<eos> Scott Mudgett and Eddie Holmes.<eos> You know them?<eos> I don't manage the property on a day-to-day basis.<eos> I inherited it from my grandfather.
Okay.<eos> Okay.<eos> Be sure to set up the cameras, so you have a view - of the whole room.<eos> - Got it.<eos> And the only way you're gonna be able to hear us is with this earbud, but don't put it in until you're in the room.
Exactly.<eos> And where you gave me the key.<eos> Nick!<eos> I brought the key.<eos> Here, I'm giving it back to you.
Look what David is holding.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> I thought David killed Goliath with a slingshot.<eos> He had a staff too, but for some reason, that part of the story isn't promoted.<eos> Apparently David left this exact staff to his descendants, and the Davidic kings used it as a scepter until the destruction of the temple, when it miraculously disappeared.
Operator three. How may I help you?<eos> One moment, please.<eos> Central here.<eos> You have a call from 235.<eos> Do you wish to take it?
You managed the jacks well yesterday.<eos> -I don't mean--<eos> -If anything goes wrong, other girls will cover you.<eos> This is a crucial moment for the company, Carlos.<eos> You're jeopardizing it to seduce an operator.
-[Alba] No, you won't lose your jobs.<eos> Carlos destroyed the rotary.<eos> I don't think he wants it to move forward.<eos> [Carlota] You don't? Well, I do.<eos> Because they're rebuilding it and Miguel says it'll be working in a day.
-Just one?<eos> For you, I have a million.<eos> Are you installing the rotary here?<eos> I see good news travels fast.<eos> I thought you destroyed it after your father died.
Do you love me?<eos> -Lidia...<eos> -Do you love me?<eos> Do it for me?<eos> Forget the rotary... and we'll go on without it.
It's one less problem to worry about... but there are still others.<eos> The girls are about to lose their jobs, and they blame me for not having told them about the rotary.<eos> [sighs] If only you had listened.<eos> I told you that this could happen.<eos> Well, you could steal it, but you'd break that rich kid's heart.
I'm going to steal the rotary blueprints.<eos> -It's too late.<eos> The machine's been built.<eos> -But it isn't patented.<eos> Only the person with the patent can build and install it.
And someone else's.<eos> Miguel, we know you've resigned.<eos> [Miguel] Yes, but that won't change things.<eos> The rotary is being presented tomorrow.<eos> We want to try to stop it from working.
Because it's a baby.<eos> You want to merge?<eos> Jessica, you got knocked down the mountain.<eos> Without help, you're not gonna be able to get back up.<eos> I've had my name first for too long. I can't go back to having it last.
When did you do this? Half hour ago.<eos> You said 3:00, so I called her in at 2:30 because I knew you wouldn't give me the chance to meet her, just like I know the other side is gonna approach her when you're not there.<eos> - They can't do that. - Why? Because it's unfair?<eos> - Because it's illegal.<eos> - Only if she pursues them, which she'll never do because they're gonna find out whatever her weak spots are, and then they're gonna offer her exactly the amount she needs to get by, and then she's gonna take it.
Maybe I did, but the truth is, I'm not ready either.<eos> What do you say we both act as interim managing partners?<eos> I'd be honored.<eos> It seems to me, the first order of business is, what are we gonna do about the name of the firm?<eos> I don't know about you, but... I think we should keep it exactly the same.
- $10,000. Not a penny more.<eos> - You see, all my experience at a midtown law firm tells me you're authorized to go to 20, so let's say 25 and call it a day.<eos> - $25,000?<eos> - Criminal charges, Linda.<eos> So if I were you, I'd cut that check, consider it a bargain, and hope to hell that little boy doesn't get worse.
Get out of here, ya freaks.<eos> You don't know what you're missing out on.<eos> That suit was so formfitting.<eos> Be bloody hard to get out off, I'd imagine?<eos> Unless he never takes it off.
Never got the bill.<eos> Hence, never paid it.<eos> And this fucking bill, for like 19 bucks, ends up obliterating my credit.<eos> And the real dick punch, the bra never fit.<eos> And I only wore it like twice.
I just don't know what to do.<eos> This is your Sliding Doors moment.<eos> You know, I never saw that movie.<eos> I bought a ticket and then didn't go.<eos> I always wondered where my life would be if I'd seen it.
And a little off.<eos> So, it's gonna be great.<eos> Whatever.<eos> That jumpsuit.<eos> Where did you get it?
- We should add more.<eos> - How many more?<eos> Ten, 20, 50, however many we can find.<eos> Let's not stop at this stubby dick.<eos> Let's make it bigger.
They made us all sign those things.<eos> If any one of us breaks it, it negates them all.<eos> Then negate them all.<eos> That's easy for you to say.<eos> I'm dying of something with a name so long, I can't even tell you what it is.
Which means this thing is gonna drag on forever.<eos> And we're gonna drop the hammer on him as soon as he gets to Harvey's.<eos> Now I don't wanna see you again until I meet you for the first time at that hearing.<eos> Don't you walk away from me.<eos> I hired Harvey to do a job, he farmed it out to you against my will and you're gonna God damn listen to me.
Yeah...<eos> Um, I'm not so sure about that.<eos> Won't be long before they find the other guys we ice'd.<eos> We got good news and bad news.<eos> The good news is, the transmitter truck's parked out by that tool shed, so we've got a chance to disable it.
Won't be long before they find the other guys we ice'd.<eos> We got good news and bad news.<eos> The good news is, the transmitter truck's parked out by that tool shed, so we've got a chance to disable it.<eos> But the bad news...<eos> There's a squad of heavily armed mercs guarding it.
Probably a lot more than she's paying you.<eos> If you're making me an offer, get on with it.<eos> Looks like we got two choices here.<eos> Either I crush this case down to the size of a baseball and nobody gets what they want, or...<eos> Or we could kill you and take it.
I don't know. Uh...<eos> This code is advanced.<eos> It's like fifth-generation syntax.<eos> I've never seen anything like it.<eos> Every time I keep trying to alter it, it kicks me right back to the ...
And how would you cure death?<eos> - By making me into an android? !<eos> - No, I'm done with robotics.<eos> This breakthrough I've made is way beyond that.<eos> I call it the Framework.
Though, to be honest, I'm starting to feel some tension, sexual and otherwise, so I was actually thinking about taking a shot, but I'm afraid it could go south.<eos> - You Americans, you talk too much.<eos> - It's our greatest flaw.<eos> Our unit has been made aware that an item was found on the premises.<eos> We have been sent to retrieve it.
You're in danger.<eos> I have so many memories of snow.<eos> My first time ice-skating on my neighbor's pond.<eos> A month stationed near the French alps.<eos> But the truth is... This is the first time I've seen it.
Well, that's a serious charge.<eos> Someone is betraying us.<eos> You know, my father always said you have to have trust... to be betrayed.<eos> Treat this mole like a cancer.<eos> I'll cut it out myself.
Tell you what...<eos> how about if we... make some popcorn and watch a video?<eos> "Chopping Mall"?<eos> - Again with that silly robot movie?<eos> - Don't pretend you don't love it.
Daddy!<eos> Daddy! She's just a kid!<eos> Let her go!<eos> No!<eos> The hangar was in total disrepair when we first found it.
If Hydra's sending a Quinjet, you can bet there's a hit team aboard.<eos> They know we're here.<eos> What do you want to do?<eos> Burrows, take this film.<eos> Bring it back to base.
My head, which you severed, is controlling many of these machines now.<eos> And you don't know where it is.<eos> So do what you want to this body.<eos> My plan is in motion.<eos> And nothing can stop it now.
I could've gotten in. I could've broken the window and got him out, but I didn't.<eos> Yilmaz believed Deniz could change.<eos> But the more he punished him the more Deniz resisted.<eos> The key to Deniz's room.<eos> You keep it.
- Hey, man.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - I'm glad to see you.<eos> - Yeah. - I gotta get this bag off.<eos> - Yeah. Yeah, I can't take it.
Hey, can someone take this bag?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Let's get in there. You got a plate presentation to make.<eos> - Jesus, fuck.<eos> - I got it.
- Yeah, like hand stuff.<eos> Joel played trumpet in high school, so he's really good with his lips and his hands.<eos> Plus, he can keep a beat.<eos> - But thanks, Alondra, for your advice.<eos> - You may not take it.
All step back, I'm 'bout to dance<eos> Did you sleep in here?<eos> Just getting a feel for my new office.<eos> You think a bike rack would fit on this wall?<eos> You put a bike rack in here, your first pro bono, you'll be representing yourself after I shove it up your ass.
- I could leave.<eos> - Not yet.<eos> [Cole] There it is, yes... oh, God, no!<eos> Where is it?<eos> - [groans] I need it.
- That was funny.<eos> That's a five-hour solution at best.<eos> I've always loved it in here.<eos> The way the light comes in and dances with the colors on the wall.<eos> This room isn't just a place I have to use, it's a place I want to use.
Right, because you killed our neighbor.<eos> So, what's the plan?<eos> Are we gonna keep him?<eos> Do I finally get a brother?<eos> We have a plan, but I feel like in your current state you're gonna judge it negatively.
What do you want?<eos> My wife's life is in danger and yours is, too, if you don't give me that flash drive.<eos> - You're peeing again.<eos> - I can't help it.<eos> Here, just take it.
Because I didn't fly all the way down here to strong-arm that woman.<eos> And I know the story of the wind and the sun.<eos> What the hell are you talking about?<eos> She's talking about Aesop's fable.<eos> Which basically says that if you want to get a man to take off his coat, you don't blow it off. You make him feel warm, and he'll take it off on his own.
The last monarch will rise in June.<eos> The last monarch will rise in June.<eos> Tank's got a regulated power supply that's keeping it locked.<eos> We'd have to disconnect the generator first,<eos> - then pry it open.
Unfortunately, I am unable to.<eos> The ship's primary temporal delineator was lost during initial impact.<eos> But if we were able to recover the delineator and somehow effect repairs...?<eos> All systems would return to normal.<eos> I'll go and get it.
We've got to get out of here!<eos> - No. No.<eos> No. - No? Why no?<eos> The White Martians infiltrated the reactor in the basement.<eos> And I need you to shut it down before the whole thing overloads.
Okay, but why not him?<eos> - I mean, that guy...<eos> Hey, hey!<eos> - What? God!<eos> He conjured up a supervillain and set it loose on National City.
I just... I love saying it like that.<eos> Hey, come on, not even a smile?<eos> What is it? What's going on?<eos> I'm trying to decide whether I should blog my article myself.<eos> Well, what happens if you blob it?
Me being the prince doesn't change anything.<eos> Not how I feel about you...<eos> This changes everything.<eos> It's bad enough you lied, but you being the prince?<eos> I thought you were just born on a cruel planet, but you lead it.
And even if we do what he wants, it doesn't guarantee he'll release her.<eos> - She's his insurance.<eos> - All right, people, let's get to work!<eos> Winn, any luck with Alex's subdermal tracker?<eos> No, it's been offline since 10:00 last night. Whoever took her must have found some way to power it down.
I want exactly what I proposed.<eos> I want us to work together to create a transmatter portal.<eos> We have them where I come from.<eos> L-Corp has already built a large-scale generator ring.<eos> We can easily adapt it for this.
Breaking in, stealing a deadly virus, and using it to kill aliens in this very bar.<eos> He discovered your cousin keeps a Phantom Zone projector among his Kryptonian artifacts.<eos> A projector?<eos> That sounds kind of low-tech.<eos> They used it to beam the prisoners instantaneously up to Fort Rozz.
A projector?<eos> That sounds kind of low-tech.<eos> They used it to beam the prisoners instantaneously up to Fort Rozz.<eos> - That is very high tech.<eos> - I can re-purpose it to beam us onboard the Daxamite spacecraft.
Because, you know, if you going to be secretary of education, you want to try ready more than one book every four years.<eos> Well, that's mean.<eos> Oh, by the way, I told your air conditioning joke today and I looked like a fucking idiot!<eos> So, thanks for that.<eos> Well, you probably told it wrong!
That's okay, Don.<eos> I know she called you, you don't have to pretend.<eos> Well look, I do have some hours if this is something you're interested in.<eos> You comfortable with a plow rig?<eos> You know, got a steering wheel, I can drive it.
What is this, a pain contest?<eos> Because I concede.<eos> You are an asshole, to answer your question.<eos> You don't back into this job, Delorme.<eos> You don't half ass it until something better comes along.
See that gentleman I was speaking to? Go ask him to wait for me, please.<eos> Governors, we are running out of time.<eos> The fact that you are here at this emergency meeting on such short notice tells the American people that you are as concerned about their safety as I am.<eos> Terror is unacceptable.<eos> I do not accept it.
Did you see her come in?<eos> I'm gonna say good night to Hope.<eos> Hayley, wait.<eos> Impressive boundary spell.<eos> Unfortunately, it only lasts as long as the witch who cast it.
There won't be an exchange.<eos> She needs Elijah to die in order to channel the energy from his sacrifice.<eos> She's already poisoned him with the rose thorns.<eos> She wants this bone by sundown.<eos> If she doesn't get it, then she's gonna come here and she's gonna take it.
Marcel.<eos> Tierra, of course, means land. As in all the hearts will defend it.<eos> Mmm. Watch yourself.<eos> And there's our bone.<eos> Now give it to me.
- Angie, are you fucking kidding me?<eos> - What?<eos> You put it on your belt!<eos> I didn't even know I was wearing a belt.<eos> I must have put it on when I was fucked up.
Come on.<eos> Up, up.<eos> Come on.<eos> Miss Garrison, I don't know anything about your business.<eos> Therefore I have no suggestions on how to improve it.
So, are you on my team?<eos> Count me in.<eos> Hey, just wanted to give you an update about my life.<eos> You ever stay in the kind of a shitty hotel that has the TV and it's chained to the wall? Well, that's where I live now.<eos> And I look at it, and I think even if I could get the TV off the chain, I couldn't steal it, because I have nowhere to take it because I have no home now.
-So...<eos> -Has it got an instruction manual? [chuckles]<eos> I'm not really one for an instruction manual anyway, so, that's all right.<eos> But maybe if we find it in the book and it's edible, we can...<eos> We can cut it open and eat it.
[Natalia] You know, I've never got to know people so completely and so intimately, and I cannot wait to celebrate and actually appreciate the enormity of this accomplishment once it's done.<eos> [Andra Day's "Rise Up" playing] ♪ You're broken down and tired ♪<eos> I hope that people understand we weren't ocean rowers.<eos> We weren't people that had done loads of amazing things before.<eos> And that didn't stop us from having a dream that was pretty big and from achieving it.
- The one percent. - Marie-Antoinette.<eos> - The one percent.<eos> - That's right.<eos> And I intend to keep this one-percent neck.<eos> I had it contoured last January after Colicchio told me that it had more rings than a Swiss roll.
Even technology has become a weapon in their hands used to poison our minds.<eos> I know you're in pain.<eos> I know you're afraid, but it doesn't have to be like this.<eos> There is a way out of the darkness.<eos> I can show it to you.
They can't fight.<eos> - Their strength's been taken.<eos> - Hide. Like scared little children!<eos> I know a way out of here.<eos> I've used it before.
What have you done?<eos> You're not the only one who's special, little brother.<eos> You used to fight for the right reasons, Waruu.<eos> The younger hunter, he crafted a stronger, much larger boomerang.<eos> He takes the boomerang, smears blood all over it like lava.
But I can show you near the station.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Let's go. - Oh, and you can borrow the beast.<eos> Oh, it's running again, huh?<eos> Uh, yeah, I got it fixed.
- Oh, shit.<eos> But you gotta do what I say, okay?<eos> To the letter, so listen.<eos> You put a movie on in the trailer when you go back in there.<eos> Put it on loud.
This cost me my family, you know that?<eos> This deal was done.<eos> They could have come home.<eos> Now, there's gonna be men coming here, they're gonna be looking for answers I can't give.<eos> They made a deal with us, and they're gonna honor it.
Can't see anything.<eos> I tried warning them there was something out there.<eos> They wouldn't listen.<eos> What was it?<eos> My dog ran to the mist, and, uh, something killed it.
If it blows, you'll destroy the whole ship.<eos> That's the idea.<eos> And the ship?<eos> I was a prisoner on this ship.<eos> I hate this place, but now we need it.
- I've seen it.<eos> - Sorry. I'm sorry.<eos> I...<eos> That shadow you feel inside?<eos> You can get rid of it by talking.
I'm okay.<eos> But listen...<eos> - the Cuban deal...<eos> - We're gonna cancel it, okay?<eos> I'll call Esteban and we'll reschedule it, okay?
-No.<eos> -Did the vizier die?<eos> -No, he didn't.<eos> Then, why did you bring us the vizier's finger?<eos> Okay, you brought it, but why did you poke us with it?
Let him up!<eos> Show me.<eos> Sh... Sh... Show you what?<eos> Our dance routine?<eos> Well, I didn't really learn it.
Show me.<eos> Sh... Sh... Show you what?<eos> Our dance routine?<eos> Well, I didn't really learn it.<eos> I didn't think it was terribly important at the time.
I second that.<eos> My ass still hurts.<eos> Enough!<eos> Listen.<eos> I can't stop the curse, so the plan is we're gonna let it run its course.
Idea.<eos> Do you guys remember the Sumerian shield charm we learned in PA?<eos> Like, to keep you safe from shattered glass or something?<eos> It's a simple spell, but that doesn't mean it's not powerful.<eos> Especially if all three of us are casting it.
We have a picture of it here.<eos> When that car was launched in 1990, it was considered remarkable because it was fast and exciting like a Ferrari, but unlike a Ferrari of the time, it was also incredibly reliable and very, very easy to drive.<eos> Honda killed that car off 12 years ago.<eos> But finally, they've come up with a replacement.<eos> So I've been down to our track to see what it's like.
It cost you 14.000 to make so you cost our production company ã10.000.<eos> No, no, not true.<eos> - I put a reserve on it. - What reserve?<eos> ã100.000.<eos> - So it didn't sell at all, which means you cost us ã14.000?
It is! I'm not making it up!<eos> You heard it. You saw it.<eos> It's a fantastic car.<eos> Anyway, listen, we must find out how fast the Quadri-thingy goes round the Eboladrome.<eos> That, of course, means handing it over to a man who thinks that tennis is something that was invented by Stalin.
Well, for as long as he's done there.<eos> - Honestly, I'm exhausted.<eos> - I'm getting dizzy.<eos> We should keep going.<eos> No. Look, there's a generator. Why don't we just connect it to the generator?
Switching to manual.<eos> Murphy!<eos> Thanks.<eos> We have to get to them before they get to Polis with that fuel.<eos> They'll use it to make bombs.
Thanks.<eos> We have to get to them before they get to Polis with that fuel.<eos> They'll use it to make bombs.<eos> They'll kill everyone.<eos> You mean they'll use it to kill Ice Nation.
- What?<eos> Truck's not here.<eos> How the hell do you know?<eos> Because everyone does what's best for their own people.<eos> It was my men who took it.
 We don't keep that kind of cash in the building.<eos> Maybe we can write you, like, an invoice or.<eos> Hawkdon't leave.<eos>  What's going on?<eos>  The guys are here with all the flooring, and they refuse to give it to us unless we pay them in cash up front.
I'm not. All I'm saying is I'm really happy that you're...<eos> Son of a bitch.<eos> - I just feel like crap, and all I want is coffee, and I can't even do that.<eos> No, it's fine.<eos> Hey, you need it more than me.
Or they'll leave, all of them.<eos> We have to defend this ranch with our lives or they will be slaughtered, all of them.<eos> This place, this place is all we have.<eos> And right now, it is... teetering.<eos> And the only thing that can save it is us.
He thinks I convinced you to become independent.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Hello.<eos> [in French accent] Monsieur, you have a call from Paris.<eos> Do you wish to take it?
What Pablo?<eos> Your Pablo?<eos> He's not my Pablo.<eos> Well, yes he is.<eos> I gave it to someone...
-What does it say?<eos> -I don't remember.<eos> Marga! Marga!<eos> The note, where is it?<eos> I put it in the mailbox first thing.
Father Pyrlig was once a warrior himself.<eos> Sword and spear, Lord, but a man tires of sticking ironware into the bellies of other men.<eos> I would have enjoyed a cup of ale with you both, but I must leave you.<eos> You have the letter secure? I do, Father.<eos> I've put it right next to my ball-bag.
I remember when I was a boy that...<eos> I'm not here to speak about me.<eos> I'm here to speak about you.<eos> I'm very sorry that you lost your job, sir.<eos> But as to what I can do to help bring it back, the answer is nothing.
I did not agree with it, but, yes, I understand.<eos> I need to earn your trust. Oh, not just me.<eos> All of NATO.<eos> Fine. But I would like to start with France.<eos> We began this dream of weapons reduction together. And I will need you there to finish it.
What?<eos> - People give up their Fingerprints so easily nowadays?<eos> Unlocking your phone.<eos> Most people still don't understand. That the real world Is no longer the only reality.<eos> What happens to a finger print On a weapon when the police find it?
Or turn a family man into a bomber.<eos> What do you want from me?<eos> Give me the access code.<eos> What access code?<eos> Kaufmann emailed it to you.
- You heard him, he wants to play.<eos> So hurry up and let him do so.<eos> - Give it to me.<eos> - The code's too complex.<eos> - I'll just send it to you.
All right?<eos> Here's the "but." He puts the wrong date in the machine, and he goes back in time instead to the 1950s, where she's just a horny teenager, and she spends the rest of the movie<eos> Lookit, I've seen that movie.<eos> No, you haven't.<eos> I haven't made it.
What on earth does she mean?<eos> It's just a conversation... we had on the road.<eos> I'll put the mare in.<eos> Take off your hat.<eos> Lay it and your bag on the bench.
Can we go, Miss Cuthbert?<eos> We'll see.<eos> Diana and I are kindred spirits.<eos> And I think she'd be struck quite sad if I were to be sent away.<eos> Please take my shawl upstairs and lay it neatly on my chair.
Initiating ground launch sequencer now.<eos> Raven.<eos> Becca?<eos> You can tell me that it's none of my business, but why live in a hole in the ground when you have a perfectly good rocket?<eos> Are you tilling the soil or stabbing it?
What would you have me do?<eos> Live?<eos> The radiation's gonna be here in 6 days.<eos> You were willing to share the bunker with us.<eos> Why not share it with Trikru, too?
Survival.<eos> You tried to take this bunker for yourself, yet here I am, willing to talk.<eos> The Trikru alliance holds the temple.<eos> Of course you're willing to talk.<eos> And the Azgeda alliance surrounds it.
You don't have to kill all 12 warriors.<eos> I just have to kill the last one.<eos> Octavia kom Skaikru is victorious.<eos> Skaikru will not take the bunker alone.<eos> We will share it.
one champion per clan, one death instead of thousands.<eos> Then whoever wins gets the bunker.<eos> I was fighting for us all.<eos> Skaikru will not take the bunker alone.<eos> We'll share it.
It's gonna be fine.<eos> We don't have any tools or weapons.<eos> So we give her the extra suit, then.<eos> - We don't have another suit.<eos> Take it off now.
- Ok. Come on.<eos> Clarke, you need to put on the suit.<eos> It was for Jasper.<eos> At least now it'll do some good.<eos> You should put it on.
- All right. Slow down.<eos> Breathing's important, too.<eos> What's the plan for oxygen?<eos> Based on what Murphy says about the lighthouse bunker, I'm guessing... make that praying... There's an oxygenator there.<eos> We take it with us.
Breathing's important, too.<eos> What's the plan for oxygen?<eos> Based on what Murphy says about the lighthouse bunker, I'm guessing... make that praying... There's an oxygenator there.<eos> We take it with us.<eos> You hook it up.
Let's go. T-minus 51 minutes and counting.<eos> Set it down.<eos> I got this. Go find your glove.<eos> I can't find my other glove.<eos> I can't find it. Where's the other one?
Oxygen level... critical.<eos> Hey, Monty, Monty, Monty, no.<eos> Hey, hey, it's connected.<eos> What do I do?<eos> The breaker, flip it.
And don't give me that horseshit that eating healthy is expensive.<eos> It isn't. Go to a fucking supermarket.<eos> They're throwing the vegetables at you.<eos> "Here's celery.<eos> Get it the fuck out of here!
She's talking to a gorilla.<eos> I love gorillas. Who wouldn't talk to a gorilla?"<eos> Without thinking that my wife is sleeping, I just blurted out,<eos> "Ask it how much it can bench!<eos> Ask it how much it can bench!"
Well, the... the kitty cat... it got hit by a car... and it's fucking dead."<eos> And the gorilla immediately took it in.<eos> It immediately took it in. It understood.<eos> Like, its bottom lip started quivering, its eyes started watering up, it was signing "crying."<eos> And later on that night, you could hear it crying inside of its house.
And then, literally, right in that moment, I felt my wife's head just rest on my shoulder, and she was like, "That was so sad.<eos> I mean, it was beautiful, but it was sad."<eos> And I was just like, "Get off me."<eos> "Just... Just get off me."<eos> And I closed the laptop, set it down on the nightstand, and I just got up, and I started pacing.
Every time I look, the baby's eating sand.<eos> I turn around, sand.<eos> Where does this sand come from?<eos> I don't know.<eos> So, I let them eat it.
Well, a neighbor called 911, and then the firefighters broke the gate down. Ohh.<eos> Listen, they saved your life.<eos> Damn razor wire.<eos> I got most of it down, and then I fell off the ladder into the whole mess of it.<eos> You were taking it down?
- The topcoat, I know.<eos> - Want some water?<eos> Want me to keep going?<eos> I brought my engagement ring to Seattle.<eos> It's at the house in my jewelry bag, and I want you to have it.
Want me to keep going?<eos> I brought my engagement ring to Seattle.<eos> It's at the house in my jewelry bag, and I want you to have it.<eos> - Mom.<eos> - Your father gave it to me.
I brought my engagement ring to Seattle.<eos> It's at the house in my jewelry bag, and I want you to have it.<eos> - Mom.<eos> - Your father gave it to me.<eos> He'd want you to have it, too.
You aren't going anywhere, Thelma and Puh-lease.<eos> We can print those papers right here in our home.<eos> I know a gentleman with a printer machine.<eos> I hope it still works.<eos> I take it apart and put it back together every couple hours.
No, verbally vicious.<eos> - Terrible grammar. - Mmhmm.<eos> Got you.<eos> Did you see the fight?<eos> Everyone saw it.
The pain. That's what you've been suppressing.<eos> All the pain and heartbreak that you have over what happened with your mother.<eos> And Chloe.<eos> I know it's difficult.<eos> But the only way to get over that pain... is to go through it.
This.<eos> I didn't think this was possible.<eos> It wasn't part of the plan.<eos> So, maybe... maybe we make a new plan.<eos> This time, we make it together.
And guess who has the key.<eos> Well, don't leave me in suspense.<eos> Who is it, brother?<eos> It says that God entrusted the key to his favorite son.<eos> Of course he gave it to you.
Well, what are you talking about?<eos> The only keys I've got are these.<eos> What else did you bring with you to Earth, Luci?<eos> Your ring.<eos> I've never seen you without it;
- That's our ending.<eos> - The wolf trial happens...<eos> When there's a full moon... and the prosecutor turns into a werewolf.<eos> Like, literally, he's just going, "I object..."<eos> The judge throws the gavel at him and he eats it or fetches it.
You've decided that I'm not fluid, I'm a lesbian?<eos> Okay, well, fuck you for making massive life decisions completely on your own that affect both of us.<eos> Well then, fuck you both for chasing me down half-cocked, you matching set of dumbshits!<eos> Ok, what are we supposed to do about the elephant?<eos> You know, we may have slapped a coat of paint on it so it'd blend in with the walls, but I can still see it.
Hey, uh... girlfriend.<eos> Hey, boyfriend.<eos> I can hear you.<eos> Oh, man, I didn't set my alarm. Shh, shh, shh.<eos> I turned it off. Wh... what would you do that for?
No.<eos> I know.<eos> I-I'm okay.<eos> Candace, did the kit have an ambu bag?<eos> - I'll get it. - Okay.
I was curious.<eos> Also, I was in the hall.<eos> I figured I should move the big, giant, scary tumor or something.<eos> - I have a giant, scary tumor. - What?<eos> I stayed up all night studying it, and I think I solved it.
- ...please let him know.<eos> I'm legit, I swear!<eos> High alert in progress, sir.<eos> I need to see some I.D.<eos> I don't have it.
I, uh...<eos> I spent six years in jail for doing some pretty awful things, so, if that was the case,<eos> I'd be the first one gone.<eos> What were you looking at?<eos> That gray shape out there, you see it?
Sticking out of, like, a reddish-brown substance.<eos> That's the liver.<eos> - Get the retractors. - Okay.<eos> All right, I got the retractors.<eos> Get ready to pull it out of the liver.
Knew for weeks I wanted to hurt him.<eos> Then one day after practice... he smiled at me.<eos> And then what happened?<eos> I beat him up.<eos> Took his arm, put it behind his back, and broke it.
- Ain't nobody say that shit.<eos> - No one said that.<eos> Ain't nobody say that.<eos> I don't know. That punchline might be a little dated.<eos> - You think we need to update it?
Has to be Dreyfuss.<eos> It does indeed.<eos> But hunting Dreyfuss now would be a costly distraction.<eos> This curse is out.<eos> And we must contain it.
Yeah.<eos> I know what I saw.<eos> Might be right.<eos> I think I saw this place on a list of Dreyfuss's holdings.<eos> They're gonna turn it into a server farm.
Right? Take this moment to stop...<eos> And... And hold the loss, right?<eos> Right.<eos> Yes. And we have to... Nurture it.<eos> So that we can let it go.
- what the hell are you two playing at?<eos> - Okay.<eos> I got it. I cut the feed.<eos> It's a British tradition, sir.<eos> - Flight, I had radio contact for a second, then I lost it again.
Then maybe he should've come down here himself instead of sending the bimbo brigade.<eos> Well done, ladies.<eos> Star City owes you a debt of gratitude.<eos> Just doing our job, Mr. Mayor.<eos> Yes, but you do it so well, and with such... style.
What a surprise!<eos> So, say it.<eos> Lord, if I may, and to save both time and ink, perhaps YOU might name a price?<eos> An acceptable price, not an impossible price.<eos> Say it.
Oh, stop being brave.<eos> I can't bear brave people.<eos> I'll put the story in the stone.<eos> I'll put your name in the air.<eos> They'll see it for hundreds of years.
I know they don't work.<eos> This arrow is a tool.<eos> It will lead you to gaze upon the person you love most.<eos> The fairy told me about the man with the lion tattoo.<eos> You could use it to find him.
Let's cut the small talk bollocks.<eos> Why are you here?<eos> Look, I just came round to try and make things right between us.<eos> And before you say anything, I'm not trying to get my job back.<eos> Good, because you're not fucking getting it back. Ever.
Does she know I'm upstairs?<eos> No, but she's not leaving until she sees you.<eos> - Is my briefcase down there?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Right, put it in my car and I'll sneak out the back.
Now go on, get back to work, and make sure they don't put a scratch in my desk.<eos> Cost me a fucking fortune, that, son.<eos> Pull!<eos> Don't!<eos> Put it down, put it down, put it down.
We can't tell her how bad her food is because that would destroy her.<eos> So when I found out Chef Dumont was coming to town, I signed us up for his class, so he could do it.<eos> - Whoa! - I know.<eos> Pretty intense, huh?<eos> Now I just grab the sensor and put it...
It's my son.<eos> - Luke, what's up?<eos> - Dad?<eos> I think something's wrong with the dryer.<eos> But I-I fixed it.
- Luke, what's up?<eos> - Dad?<eos> I think something's wrong with the dryer.<eos> But I-I fixed it.<eos> I fixed it good.
You've picked, what, 20 locks?<eos> 23, counting breaking in here.<eos> When did you find the time to practice?<eos> My deal fell through.<eos> Actually, I called it off.
It is.<eos> Not that I've paid much attention to it.<eos> I know you look down on me, Rachel.<eos> You probably wonder why on earth my sisters even bother with me.<eos> But I've been in this fight since the beginning with Beth, even before Sarah, and I'm in it for the long haul.
Oh, no.<eos> Jon changed the code.<eos> Wait, what?<eos> What does that mean that Jon changed the code?<eos> Well, we change it sometimes.
- Hey, you.<eos> - Hi.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> What happened to your ankle?<eos> I sprained it.
I'm fine.<eos> I think you might have some issues with your new job.<eos> I love my job.<eos> It's great.<eos> - I hate it.
I think you might have some issues with your new job.<eos> I love my job.<eos> It's great.<eos> - I hate it.<eos> I hate it so much.
I hate it so much.<eos> - It's terrible.<eos> Marianne!<eos> It's fine.<eos> The point is you hate it, so you shouldn't be there.
It is a virus, but not one she's ever seen before.<eos> Well, now we've got its mug shot, someone's gonna know what it is.<eos> She thought it was very suspicious that it was both UV and chlorine-resistant.<eos> She cannot rule out that it was a natural mutation, but said that it was far more likely that our suspect was lab-engineered.<eos> So someone crafted it specifically to survive the city's gauntlet of water safeguards? Yeah.
That's Roy, coming out of his law office.<eos> He's the defense lawyer she's up against in the Pulaski case.<eos> Well, Chantal's assistant admitted that Roy sweet-talked her into telling him when and where you were both meeting.<eos> Then, Gulbenkian flooded her office with paperwork so Chantal would be a no-show.<eos> It was a set-up. Chantal's probably the only female ADA up to speed on the case and qualified to run it.
Hello, Ravn.<eos> My condolences.<eos> - I did everything I could.<eos> - That's great. Everything within the law.<eos> Had I, for just one second, believed in Vilma's treatment, I would have considered it.
What you talking about?<eos> You ain't gonna tell Abby shit.<eos> You just got away with it, dude.<eos> You think every time I drive drunk I get home and I call the cops?<eos> No. I pull over, I pick up the mailbox I just knocked over, throw it in my trunk and I keep moving.
- Yeah. - Cool.<eos> Sixty-five hundred.<eos> Congratulations.<eos> You just overpaid for a bull.<eos> Hope you can ride it home.
"Dear Maggie,<eos> "Patsy Cline came on the radio today, and I thought of you.<eos> "I know you've only been gone a few weeks, but it feels like forever.<eos> "I've taken to growing a mustache. I'm not sure it suits me.<eos> "I'll probably shave it off in a week.
I like your dream catcher.<eos> - What?<eos> - Your dream catcher.<eos> I put that here the day I took over this bar.<eos> You're the first person who's ever noticed it.
All right.<eos> I did miss that.<eos> We could do this every day.<eos> I told you not to ask Rooster.<eos> He fixed it.
He fixed it.<eos> You know, this don't make any sense.<eos> He needs a job and we got one to give.<eos> I offered him the job.<eos> He turned it down.
You know, this don't make any sense.<eos> He needs a job and we got one to give.<eos> I offered him the job.<eos> He turned it down.<eos> Did you offer it to him?
Oh, and I tried to call you before you got all the way out here.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Colt turned my ringer off a while back for church.<eos> I can't figure out how to turn it back on.
Walnuts.<eos> Hey. - Hey!<eos> - Hey. Good, you're home.<eos> - Got to take the truck over to Mary's.<eos> - I need it tonight.
I would like to speak to Lord Uhtred.<eos> You cannot.<eos> I would like to serve him.<eos> You cannot!<eos> Now shut your mouth, before I fill it, with my boot!
Awesome!<eos> I mean, I lo... I never been to a helicopter before.<eos> Yeah, me neither.<eos> I've had the certificate forever.<eos> - I got to use it at some point.
I'm going in to ask.<eos> - Why do you have that plate?<eos> - I...<eos> They'll call you a thief too.<eos> No, no, the lady brought it to me yesterday, when she was distraite.
- Stop it!<eos> I mean, I hope they aren't becoming addled, dear, as seniors are wont to do.<eos> They hardly want to, darling.<eos> I don't like this biscuit.<eos> Then don't eat it.
Well, it doesn't provide much scope for the imagination, that's for sure and certain.<eos> Seems to me you should decide for yourself what you want to do... and be, and set your mind to it.<eos> Maybe school wouldn't be so bad now that I have Diana and Ruby.<eos> You've got a good and nimble mind, Anne.<eos> I don't see why you should limit it.
I-I-I think you're really minimizing that atrocity.<eos> Now, let me do the talking.<eos> Good.<eos> I don't feel like talking.<eos> It's just you nurture a dream for 30 years, only to see it go up in flames like Pete's eyebrow.
I've thought about that. Who's gonna come down here?<eos> There's nowhere to park.<eos> Oh, my God, that's it... a parking lot.<eos> That's not bad.<eos> We could build it for nothing and pay off the majority of the loan by tomorrow.
Okay.<eos> Then what happened?<eos> Well, there's really not much left to tell.<eos> I decided that my mother views me as a child because I never went through a rebellious phase, so, I got an earring.<eos> My mother made me take it out.
It's like a seahorse, but it's a dragon about a foot long... that most people don't even know exists.<eos> But then, one year, they were all disappearing from all my favorite sites.<eos> You know, this was one of my favorite creatures in the world.<eos> And you go, "Well, if it's happening to one of my favorite creatures, what else is it happening to?"<eos> And that's when I realized one of the biggest issues with the ocean is it is completely out of sight and out of mind, and that, essentially, is an advertising issue.
It's cool.<eos> I got it.<eos> All right, bye.<eos> You forgot your chocolate cake!<eos> I'll just leave it on the porch.
And that makes sense.<eos> You're easy to talk to.<eos> Yeah. You're easy to talk to, too, which is good 'cause, otherwise, you'd go broke.<eos> When a male gentoo penguin chooses a mate, he makes an offering.<eos> He finds a pebble, often taking the time to find the smoothest one, and presents it to the female.
So when our leader, Terrell, said he had a way to get out, we was, like, â€œYeah.â€<eos> The syrup heist was his idea?<eos> No, a friend of his.<eos> This guy, you know, he had all the details figured out.<eos> Knew where to get the syrup, how to get the boats, where to bring it once it was on shore.
It and all of the darkness you've ever faced, was borne out of one twisted soul... the Black Fairy.<eos> And unless we try and stop her, she is gonna bring far worse.<eos> How's it going, Mom?<eos> It's going... slowly.<eos> Casting a sleeping curse is one thing, but breaking it?
I saw your parents.<eos> Made me realize something... something I saw the last time that we chatted.<eos> The look of someone who needs hope.<eos> Henry had it all those years ago when he found me and told me I'm the Savior.<eos> Now you have it.
Haven't you ever wondered why the Black Fairy is collecting all this dust?<eos> Years ago, the Black Fairy used her dust to create a most terrible spell.<eos> It was called the Dark Curse.<eos> The Dark Curse?<eos> She was obsessed with perfecting it and never stopped collecting the dust.
Well, then you won't be driving it to New York, either.<eos> - Back to your cell.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Wait.<eos> Fine. I'll take it.
Well, I'll let you into a little secret.<eos> It's Perrier Water.<eos> Flinging it up into the air.<eos> I heard another one the other day. A taxi driver clearing out his cab after a hard day at work... umbrella, mobile phone, usual stuff... £800,000 gold bar.<eos> Someone had left it in there - and not even noticed.
Ah, one of the Unilu.<eos> Like, can I help you?<eos> Yes. Can you tell me where the "other" market is?<eos> The what?<eos> Well, some might call it the "black market."
Carefully remove the lid of the middle one.<eos> - They can't sting me through the suit? - No.<eos> Quite sure?<eos> Now do the same with that lid.<eos> Put it down gently over there.
So you don't worry about her?<eos> Of course, I worry about her.<eos> I fought in the war in '96, I know what those things are capable of.<eos> But I know what my daughter is capable of.<eos> And I know this planet is safer because she's defending it.
What am I supposed to do with this, Russ?<eos> I mean, obviously, you don't want Duke to have it.<eos> Oh, God, you are so lucky you don't have to deal with this stuff.<eos> I said I'd do anything to make your family happy, and giving them the recipe could earn us some goodwill that we can use later on, but that would mean betraying you.<eos> There's got to be a way I can have my cake and eat it, too.
You look somewhat satisfied.<eos> - Good.<eos> - Not good.<eos> Francis, enjoy this moment.<eos> - You deserve it.
Okay.<eos> Should Seth and I prepare a statement?<eos> - Where are we saying the truck is?<eos> - We don't know.<eos> - When are we gonna find it?
Phil Knight took over from that point and just said, "Well, thanks for coming.<eos> I mean, we've been waiting a while, but we hope it's worth it.<eos> [inhales sharply] Take it away, Tinker."<eos> I'm more of a... You've got to actually show me the shoe, you know?<eos> He storytells and then he draws and then, you know, he shows me all the pictures of it, and I still can't visualize it until you put it in my hand.
[Tinker] I think it's one of my favorite shoes that I've ever worked on, partly because of that wonderful experience of finally getting Michael to open up and give me stories.<eos> [upbeat music playing]<eos> [Tinker] What you're about to see is our very first toe in the water toward full adaptability.<eos> Just step into the shoe, it automatically closes.<eos> [Tinker] Who would like to try it on?
Blank piece of paper, blank table, there's usually one other person there.<eos> Could be a director, or a playwright, or the artist, if it's for a pop show.<eos> And a conversation happens, and I'd normally just start drawing while we're talking.<eos> So, if I were to be having a conversation about my own practice, it would start with this one, with a little drawing of a pair of scissors on it.<eos> 'Cause you used to get those, and you still do, on the back of a cornflakes packet, and it's an invitation to take the piece of the cornflakes packet and cut it and make an intervention in it
Oh, you've made me the happiest man in the world.<eos> I don't know how to say this without sounding superficial, but I need a closer look at this ring.<eos> Yeah, sit down, sit down.<eos> It was my grandmother's.<eos> She hid it in her hollowed-out wooden foot during the Great Depression.
Maybe that's how he got in.<eos> Impossible.<eos> If he came across the roof, there'd be broken tiles or monster prints or... My monogrammed money clip.<eos> I snuck in through Joe's window last night because it was past curfew, and I must have dropped my clip on the roof.<eos> I needed to get it before Mom saw.
But I know that you're lying.<eos> Fine.<eos> I was the one in here last night.<eos> I came in through the window because I broke curfew.<eos> I dropped my money clip, and I was just trying to get it back.
I look like a cockroach in this one.<eos> - It's bound to be around here somewhere.<eos> - What is?<eos> The figgy pudding.<eos> The palace chef would have prepared it and placed it somewhere cool.
[register beeps] [Titus] After you buy something, get the key.<eos> Real cool.<eos> Say, compadre, I need to make plops.<eos> There you go.<eos> [Titus] Throw the key out the bathroom window so I can take it to the hardware store.
Sounds racist.<eos> I just enjoy them as movies.<eos> You guys think I think it's a documentary. I get it.<eos> Here's what I've learned hanging out with black dudes:<eos> When a new slave movie comes out, can't be your idea as the white person to go see it.
That is how we win!<eos> No, we win if Neolution is exposed and Westmorland is stripped of his myth!<eos> Where's your smoking gun, Rachel?<eos> There's nothing for you here.<eos> Oh, you gave it to her!
Now, in exchange, I want you and yours to leave my daughter alone.<eos> Forever.<eos> Or?<eos> No need for "or."<eos> You know a good deal when you hear it, and I'm only offering once.
- I've been ill. - So I see.<eos> What's the matter?<eos> I'm over the worst of it.<eos> That letter is mine, Siv.<eos> - You've read it?
Why would Thawne use the Spear of Destiny to shrink you?<eos> Uh, I don't believe he did.<eos> I'm assuming that he used Dr. Palmer's exosuit.<eos> Well then, he must still have it in his lab.<eos> We gotta steal it back and then we can unshrink the ship.
I can't control it.<eos> I believe in you.<eos> You're stronger than you know.<eos> There's no place like home.<eos> Well, the cork broke off, but I think I managed to salvage it.
Everybody does it.<eos> You think it's an accident "google" is just "go ogle" without the space?<eos> Sure, it's kind of a moral gray area, but--<eos> No, some things are pretty black-and-white.<eos> Uh, newspapers. A penguin before it goes in a blender. Rainbows if you're a dog.
Including putting a gun in his mouth and pulling the trigger.<eos> Sorry.<eos> I want to be helpful, but Cy prosecuted so many cases.<eos> The Kotite trial was big.<eos> People in England followed it very closely.
[Paula] Ideas come all kinds of ways.<eos> I get my best ideas in taxicabs, you know, like sitting in traffic, drooling.<eos> I'm allowing my subconscious to take over, so that I can free associate.<eos> You have to be in a state of play to design. If you're not in a state of play, you can't make anything.<eos> It should really start like almost with that bar, like if you drop it down about a sixteenth of an inch and then, when you put "Pier" on the end of it, it's really nice.
So I thought I'd at least look into that.<eos> Speaking of mystery vehicles. Marcus?<eos> You called it.<eos> Contracting company in Astoria reported a stolen truck this morning.<eos> They said a drywaller had it out on a job yesterday, and never came back.
Would I be right in thinking that your incarceration might worry some of your previous employers?<eos> So now would be a very good time to think about avoiding general population.<eos> My helper's name was D'Agostino.<eos> Mr. Azoff... is at the bottom of Jamaica Bay.<eos> I bleached down his truck and had it dismantled at a chop shop.
[Alba] Yes, but at times it isn't.<eos> You're not the first friend of mine who's been in this situation.<eos> Thank you, but... [sniffles] no, I can cope with this.<eos> [clears throat] My dear, you have a call.<eos> Do you think you're well enough to take it?
-Yes... and no.<eos> How's that?<eos> We have to build a prototype to show that it works.<eos> Without the finished prototype, these papers are worthless.<eos> As soon as I build it...
How did you get this job?<eos> Was it legal?<eos> I'm not going to let you insult me.<eos> Carolina has the letter.<eos> She's going to give it to your wife.
She's going to give it to your wife.<eos> That's why I'm here.<eos> Not to insult you.<eos> What?<eos> [sighs] I didn't read it.
That's why I'm here.<eos> Not to insult you.<eos> What?<eos> [sighs] I didn't read it.<eos> She came into my room when I was out and took it.
[sighs] I didn't read it.<eos> She came into my room when I was out and took it.<eos> This can't be happening.<eos> With what happened to Ángeles, I had no time to tell you.<eos> I don't even know if she's already given it to her.
♪ I wanted love the most ♪ A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES<eos> Carlos, we have to talk.<eos> I know how this ends.<eos> Usually, I say that line.<eos> In fact, I think I invented it.
I don't want to think about it.<eos> I was hoping to get help.<eos> Thank you. Thanks, Victoria.<eos> I need your photo for the ID.<eos> You'll have it today.
Good morning, miss.<eos> -It's Mrs. Pérez. -Oh.<eos> Forgive me, I didn't see a ring.<eos> I'm allergic to gold.<eos> I had to take it off.
You didn't say you had a girlfriend while you were flirting with me.<eos> I made a mistake, but everyone makes mistakes.<eos> -Break it.<eos> -Why would--<eos> Break it!
-Here.<eos> -Thank you.<eos> -See this?<eos> -Yes.<eos> Can you do anything to fix it?
His feet caught it!<eos> Come on!<eos> I think he got his toe in the blood.<eos> He's not in the clear yet.<eos> He still has to make his way, get that momentum, and he's got it.
- "Silke smooth," baby!<eos> Now heading down the next obstacle, Spinal Descent.<eos> And she is loving this!<eos> Oh, no, her shoe's caught!<eos> Grab it, grab it!
Now heading down the next obstacle, Spinal Descent.<eos> And she is loving this!<eos> Oh, no, her shoe's caught!<eos> Grab it, grab it!<eos> She can't get it.
A girl that you may think you know, but she's a liar and a thief.<eos> She stole intellectual property and I need it back.<eos> It's that simple, you want Isaac, you bring me Clementine Lewis.<eos> I took the schematics that Mansdale got and put the biodrive in sleep mode, so... it won't transmit anything.<eos> I'm leaving it in.
"Don't be a penis," that should be the saying.<eos> Scotland taught me so many things.<eos> Beautiful place, beautiful people, rich in culture.<eos> My favorite thing to do while I was there was trying to learn the Scottish accents.<eos> I butcher it, but I don't care.
Howard!<eos> Let me finish-- and one card had five dollars in it<eos> I took from Bernie's purse.<eos> The notebook isn't in the bathroom.<eos> I can't find it, either.
Run!<eos> Get in this car.<eos> Hurry!<eos> It's not broken?<eos> I'm making it work now.
He wanted to make a film.<eos> He got the film and got out and brought it to Washington.<eos> How he did it, I don't know.<eos> I suspect he said it was a box of cigars or something.<eos> I don't know how he got it out, but he got it out.
Go live at your mother's house."<eos> Now, the truth was, of course, that he knew that the bureaucracy would catch up, and they would say, "Do you have any film here that was brought back?"<eos> And he could say no, he didn't.<eos> He had to construct not a documentary account, exactly, but a John Ford account of reality.<eos> The decision about whether to show that film in the form that Ford had made it ultimately went up the chain, until finally President Roosevelt watched the film.
Huston's cut of the film was over 40 minutes, more than twice the length Lowell Mellett wanted.<eos> [Coppola] These were filmmakers who wanted to do a piece of work, and the Army wanted a short, twenty-minute film that they could show before the cartoon and the coming attractions.<eos> There was always going to be a struggle between the administrators and directors of this level, pouring their hearts into the work.<eos> [narrator] After being stymied by Mellett, Huston decided to go directly to the press in New York.<eos> When newspapers began running stories about the government withholding Huston's film, the Army was left with no choice but to release it at full length.
He was now working closely with director Anatole Litvak on the fifth and greatest of the Why We Fight films:<eos> The Battle of Russia.<eos> While Capra and Litvak worked on the film, the Red Army started pushing back the Nazis at Stalingrad, in one of the costliest battles of the war.<eos> [man] For the first time since the mighty German Army started its career of blitz, smashing into submission one European country after the other, that same German Army came up against a country... that did not submit.<eos> [narrator] Though it had been made as a training film, The Battle of Russia was so well-regarded that Capra received permission to release it theatrically.

"We don't need this anymore."<eos> Not only from a practical point of view, but from a human point of view.<eos> [narrator] After three days with no sign of surrender from Japan, a second atomic bomb was dropped on Nagasaki.<eos> [General MacArthur] I now invite the representatives of the Emperor of Japan and the Japanese government and the Japanese Imperial General Headquarters to sign the instrument of surrender at the places indicated.<eos> Let us pray that peace be now restored to the world and that God will preserve it always.
There was one that was particularly close to me because it was done right after the war.<eos> Most of the films are fictional, you know, are fictional stories, and didn't really involve me.<eos> But since I was in the service during the war, right after the war, I made a film called The Best Years of Our Lives.<eos> [applause] That film gave me a great deal of satisfaction because it contributed something to the social life of the time.<eos> It made people understand veterans better.
Mm-hmm.<eos> Margo Taft. I've been trying to take her away from Cohn for years.<eos> Well, Pat, okay, well played.<eos> Go make the movie. I mean, a surefire hit now.<eos> I'll sign off on it.
She empties out her purse.<eos> Two dimes and one nickel.<eos> She puts the dimes back in her purse, but places the nickel on a shelf beneath a bottle of rye.<eos> On the stove is a matchbox. One match left inside it.<eos> She puts the gloves inside the oven, then lights it.
You look nice.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Yeah, I was wondering if you'd ever let me use this space.<eos> I know it's a lot to ask, so...<eos> What do you want it for?
I wasn't fighting for skaikru today.<eos> I thought I was fighting for myself, but I now know that's not true, either.<eos> I was fighting for us all.<eos> Skaikru will not take the bunker alone.<eos> We will share it equally because we are equal.
In addition to the prison sentence, she could be required to be a registered sex offender for the rest of her life.<eos> So if she's willing to testify, it's very likely that she will be treated leniently in connection with the case.<eos> That is if she's willing to cooperate.<eos> [man] The facts are not in dispute.<eos> She, of course, filmed the encounter, streamed it live.
-[Reynolds] Working.<eos> [Judy] I know.<eos> You always work.<eos> I applied for a new job yesterday.<eos> Don't know if I'll get it, but--
Let's set up for the cum shot.<eos> Get super hard for this one.<eos> Oh, I have to get super hard?<eos> [Tony] Yeah, semi?<eos> [Reynolds] Just semi and then squeeze it.
Well, Roger's a good guy, and he is a patriot.<eos> He's a tough cookie, but people like him.<eos> But he's been so loyal and so wonderful.<eos> And thank God for the Breitbarts and the Daily Callers and the so many alternative media sites where we can learn the truth and we can tell the truth and we can spread the truth.<eos> This is not conservatism as we have known it.
"Silent majority," "the forgotten Americans."<eos> "I am the candidate of law and order."<eos> It's not me who found this trend.<eos> It's those who went before me.<eos> I just saw Trump's ability to utilize it to become president.
This is everything I was able to dig up on him.<eos> His record's clean, but maybe you can find something I didn't.<eos> Thanks.<eos> I recognize this letter.<eos> Because I'm the one who wrote it.
- Yes, earlier today.<eos> Sara was really paranoid because Sana was starting to suspect anything, right?<eos> But fortunately she managed to get away with it.<eos> I feel sorry for her.<eos> But, hello? She is really stupid if she doesn't get we own the bus cause we are paying for it and she doesn't have any rights.
Sally Sweet is a gold mine.<eos> Enemy is our most expensive picture and our biggest risk.<eos> You gave me a blank check. You.<eos> Yes, I did.<eos> And now, I'm tearing it up.
NOW, IT IS TURNING AROUND.<eos> OH, DEAR, I AM SURROUNDED.<eos> Rafa, did I leave the monitor there?<eos> Is it there?<eos> I am coming to get it.
Are you a man or a woman?<eos> The first answers were something like:<eos> I am a man.<eos> And I am using a language, culture, etc. which is given to be feminine.<eos> I am invading this field and claiming it for my own use too.
We knew we would have a quick car.<eos> With our hybrid system, we had some advantages definitely on one lap.<eos> But at the same time we know it's a 24 hour race.<eos> We know about the great experience Audi's having and that's something you always have in mind.<eos> Rain just makes its appearance when you least expect it.
- No! He just died!<eos> I need Mike to drop that case.<eos> You telling me to go back on my word because your client's bullying you?<eos> It's one pro bono.<eos> He can drop it.
I need Mike to drop that case.<eos> You telling me to go back on my word because your client's bullying you?<eos> It's one pro bono.<eos> He can drop it.<eos> If I give you an assignment, you do it.
I know that you didn't feel valued at Pearson specter, and I wanted to apologize for my part in that.<eos> I also just... I wanted you to know that it was never my intention to get you fired.<eos> I hope you're not here to offer me my job back.<eos> - And what if I said I was?<eos> - I'd say I wouldn't take it.
She took it, instead of going to court.<eos> And I am telling you, she regretted that for the rest of her life.<eos> Oscar, there's no price that'll make the pain go away.<eos> Then what will?<eos> Doing everything you can to make sure no one else ever has to feel it too.
And I've served Mass for different priests.<eos> And one day, we were getting ready for Mass...<eos> You know, the altar boys, we'd get there a little early.<eos> He'd come into the sacristy and, um...<eos> He takes a handgun out of his pocket and put it on the... the counter in the sacristy.
It's not what I have thought happened for 45 years.<eos> I didn't know the name Maskell until my mother died.<eos> I joined the Baltimore County Police Department in July of 1997, and I went to the Homicide Unit here in Baltimore County in February of 2000.<eos> I've been there ever since.<eos> I'm new to the case, this is a couple weeks into this cold case, looking... Re-looking at it.
It was Cathy's handwriting.<eos> I called my father, who'd worked for the post office.<eos> He said, "Tell me everything that the postmark says."<eos> He said, "Marilyn, it was sent after Cathy went missing.<eos> Stay there and don't move and don't open it, because it could be evidence.
I was there to give them my contact information since my parents were dead.<eos> Is there anything new?<eos> Anything going on?<eos> Do you know who did it?<eos> But also to tell you I would really like my letter, and I understand that's evidence, and if I'm not even allowed to touch it, could we...?
Is there anything new?<eos> Anything going on?<eos> Do you know who did it?<eos> But also to tell you I would really like my letter, and I understand that's evidence, and if I'm not even allowed to touch it, could we...?<eos> Could I just look at it?
Anything going on?<eos> Do you know who did it?<eos> But also to tell you I would really like my letter, and I understand that's evidence, and if I'm not even allowed to touch it, could we...?<eos> Could I just look at it?<eos> Could I read it?
Do you know who did it?<eos> But also to tell you I would really like my letter, and I understand that's evidence, and if I'm not even allowed to touch it, could we...?<eos> Could I just look at it?<eos> Could I read it?<eos> They said they can't find it. It must have been lost.
Could I just look at it?<eos> Could I read it?<eos> They said they can't find it. It must have been lost.<eos> It existed.<eos> There's no doubt it existed.
They said they can't find it. It must have been lost.<eos> It existed.<eos> There's no doubt it existed.<eos> There's no doubt it was given to the police.<eos> There's no doubt the police had it. Where is it?
It just makes me wanna cry, the two of you getting together.<eos> This just makes me wanna cry.<eos> We've been talking about the ring.<eos> I'm wondering if...<eos> Do you have it with...?
My best friend, my sister, all my life and I will carry that.<eos> But they also have pain they are carrying.<eos> And there needs to be a world, there needs to be a place that we live in, where people wanna see something done about that.<eos> Whoever murdered her has gotten away with it, and... she's never gotten a bit of justice.<eos> It has been almost 50 years, since Cathy's murder, but I do think it'll be solved.
Is anyone out there?"<eos> And it's still silent.<eos> But we're hearing each other... because we're all coming up to the crack.<eos> And what's happening is, is we're bumping into each other, coming to the crack.<eos> And before you know it, the pressure of that voice seeping through the crack is going to shatter it.
- Where?<eos> - No, he'd recite a poem?<eos> Oh, yes.<eos> You see, they never did find Belle or Bash. But the parrots they kept aboard the Salty Brick used to repeat this poem about the treasure.<eos> Could I hear it?
"You have a hook for a hand.<eos> I don't know what the etiquette is."<eos> And she'd be like, "Thank you for being real with me.<eos> Nobody's ever real with me.<eos> Yes, you can shake it, whatever."
And my dad has no boundaries.<eos> I don't know if he flipped through these at all or didn't.<eos> Um, but it was Truly Tasteless Jokes book one and two.<eos> And I remember the first joke on the first page.<eos> It was a paragraph long, but I can tell it in two seconds.
The Twitterverse was aflame.<eos> At 8:05... I tweeted:<eos> "Why do my dog's doodles come out cold?"<eos> Let me just remind you, I scheduled that tweet.<eos> That's how good I thought it was.
You know we all love it here.<eos> I just really want to get on Raven... by the end of the day.<eos> That magazine cover is in the bag.<eos> Susie... how many times have I told you not to wear the same nail polish as me?<eos> Sorry, I'll take it off.
Anyone who lays eyes on this beast immediately dies from shock.<eos> Thus, details about this pony are scarce.<eos> But his name.<eos> His name is mentioned by flickering candlelight.<eos> Striking fear into the hearts of those who hear it.
You finish one sleeve and you're like, "Well, there's just one sleeve left."<eos> Flash forward, the 1960's.<eos> I'm at Columbia University as a trespasser.<eos> I was handing out flyers for this cult I had joined, you know.<eos> I'm the only guy to ever get kicked out of a cult for being too into it.
Do you realize how many innocent lives were lost in Dubai during those nuclear attacks?<eos> [gasps] That's enough!<eos> If you're so sure we did all that, then why did you bother setting up this meeting with us?<eos> Why not report whatever you want? And then just leave us alone.<eos> That day, even though we'd foreseen that nuclear strike, the fact is we failed to put a stop to it.
Don't need it.<eos> Read it yesterday.<eos> Have one at home.<eos> And by one, he means ten.<eos> Are you sure you don't want to take just one more look at it?
Donna, I need to talk to you about something.<eos> - About what?<eos> - About the fact that I'm pissed off.<eos> What's going on?<eos> I gave Stephanie Patel an assignment and she handed it off.
I just want to make sure you don't have any conflicts with any of these.<eos> Maybe your client's grandmother shops at the supermarket across the street from number 12.<eos> I'll take a look.<eos> Good, 'cause just to be clear, if I'd known there was a conflict, I never would've taken the case.<eos> I appreciate you dropping it.
Maybe your client's grandmother shops at the supermarket across the street from number 12.<eos> I'll take a look.<eos> Good, 'cause just to be clear, if I'd known there was a conflict, I never would've taken the case.<eos> I appreciate you dropping it.<eos> I was bulldozed into dropping it, just like I was bulldozed into signing this.
Uh, can anyone say, "Lame"?<eos> Put that thing down.<eos> Hey, babe, did you remember to bring the box fan?<eos> - Those cabins get really hot.<eos> - Uh, no, I thought you were bringing it.
And everybody would be so mad and upset, but he's like, "Cam F. Awesome.<eos> What do you expect?"<eos> People are like, "What is he doing?<eos> That's ugly. That... What?"<eos> They don't understand that kind of style, but the boxers he's fighting... they understand it.
- I look good. - Yeah.<eos> Greatest thing you can do is get that diploma, okay?<eos> I am.<eos> I'm trying to.<eos> I'm not tryin', I'm gonna get it.
Now there are 17 weight classes, each with an upwards of four different champions.<eos> The values of all those belts have dwindled, making an undefeated record, that purest proof of dominance, more important than ever.<eos> Jab-uppercut.<eos> Yeah, but throw that uppercut.<eos> Throw it.
What?<eos> You seem pretty motivated.<eos> Yes.<eos> There's finally someone... who wants to read my novel.<eos> I know it sounds pretty silly, but I want to write for this person who's waiting for it.
[Keith] So, did the crew abandon ship?<eos> I don't know, but they couldn't have gotten far without their spacesu-- [screams]<eos> Those aren't empty!<eos> We located the second comet based on King Alfor's information.<eos> We managed to get it aboard, but it seems to be causing massive disturbances.
Shiro?<eos> How...?<eos> [with accent] Stay back!<eos> If you've come for the comet, you'll never get it.<eos> I'll die before I let it fall into Altean hands.
But what if Voltron is unable to escape the other dimension?<eos> -It's another reality, Ezor.<eos> -[sighs] What if they aren't able to escape the other reality ?<eos> [Lotor] If Voltron disappears from our world, then we win.<eos> If they make it out with the comet, we'll take it from them.
[Coran] Paladins, can you hear me?<eos> Coran, we're here.<eos> Allura, you did the right thing.<eos> You couldn't let Hira get that ore.<eos> -But now, Lotor has it.
We never know.<eos> And that is exactly why my father sent the lions away so many years ago.<eos> To avoid this reality.<eos> -I finally understand.<eos> -We'll get it back.
I'm not trying to brag here, but I had a really good day with Sam.<eos> You know, he's a good kid.<eos> What happened to your arm? Oh, nothing.<eos> I just scraped it on a nail in the garage.<eos> You gotta show me where it is so I can pound it down.
God be with you and watch over you.<eos> Thank you.<eos> This bird is no good.<eos> I tell you, no good!<eos> The priest won't accept it.
I have to have a sacrifice!<eos> Little boy, do you want a bird?<eos> A flawed bird!<eos> Huh?<eos> - Do you want it?
I'll try.<eos> I need to boil some water, to make a tea.<eos> I'll fetch you a bucket.<eos> I can fetch it.<eos> No, you stay here. I'll fetch it for you.
Of course I do.<eos> We got to go up North.<eos> Mmm-hmm.<eos> It ain't your fault we lost that war.<eos> I know you tried to win it all by yourself.
You know, I was just thinking...<eos> Not that I'm trying to tell you how to run this place or anything. I'm just a little curious.<eos> Michelle...<eos> Say, how close do you think she got to that air filtration unit?<eos> You think she touched it?
Not that I'm trying to tell you how to run this place or anything. I'm just a little curious.<eos> Michelle...<eos> Say, how close do you think she got to that air filtration unit?<eos> You think she touched it?<eos> Yeah, I'm pretty sure she touched it.
Except it was Emmett's turn.<eos> Sorry, I just got a little excited.<eos> Yeah, well, I'm keeping that point.<eos> Totally.<eos> You earned it.
How did you correct a complete c7-c8 spinal cord injury?<eos> I didn't correct it.<eos> He couldn't walk. I convinced him that he could.<eos> You're not suggesting it was psychosomatic?<eos> When you reattach a severed nerve... Is it you who heals it back together or the body?
You finished all of these?<eos> Yup.<eos> Come with me.<eos> All right.<eos> This section is for masters only... But at my discretion, others may use it.
Wong.<eos> Breaking the laws of nature. I know.<eos> Well, don't stop now.<eos> When the sanctum's restored, they'll attack it again.<eos> We've got to defend it.
We look good.<eos> What is that?<eos> Looks like one of those things that makes cotton candy.<eos> It's a PKE meter.<eos> There's a ghost anywhere around here, this baby's gonna find it.
That's one of my favorites.<eos> I think you might've made a mistake.<eos> I don't think that one's for us.<eos> No. No, that's for you.<eos> You know, I just thought the floating hot dog implies that a ghost is holding it.
- Yeah.<eos> - Yeah, I've seen a ghost.<eos> - You, too?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Would you be able to describe it to us?
Did you get sugar in it this time?<eos> I hate coffee.<eos> - Yeah, the sugar's in there.<eos> - Sugar's in it.<eos> I'll take it.
- I will preach.<eos> You know what we're gonna do, ladies?<eos> We're gonna catch a ghost, we're gonna bring...<eos> God.<eos> We're gonna catch a ghost, bring it back to the lab...
Nice!<eos> Yeah, my mistake.<eos> It was a medium poof.<eos> This puppy I like to call a Ghost Chipper.<eos> Hollow-laser technology, sucks in the ghost and neutralizes it.
Okay.<eos> All right.<eos> Now, I'm gonna feed the wire.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, I got it, Dad.
He prayed with me, he sat at my table with my wife and ate my food.<eos> I wasted my knives on the meat.<eos> I gave him this ring.<eos> Made only two of them.<eos> You should have ripped it off that motherfucker's finger.
- Light.<eos> - Sorry.<eos> Soon as I pull this module, the entire computer's gonna shut down.<eos> Well, what happens then?<eos> I'll get it back up as quickly as I can.
Savior One-Zero, how copy?<eos> Savior One-Zero, the LZ's clear.<eos> Boss, they're not talking to me.<eos> Our bird's been jacked.<eos> Light it up!
- Okay.<eos> I am made of questions right now.<eos> Well, you don't have to ask.<eos> Last night, lady got into it with a man. She ended up cutting his pecker off.<eos> She left with it, got in a car, drove, got on 95, threw it out the window.
Okay. Recording. We are recording.<eos> Just, uh, make sure it's always facing forward.<eos> And make sure you press the button down. - Did you hold it down?<eos> - Okay, got it, got it, got it. - Yeah, I got it.<eos> - Did you hold it down?
Wouldn't the fall kill you before the crash?<eos> It depends on the height and how you land.<eos> There's a story, and I don't know how true it is, of an assassin so deadly that he eliminated over 30 high-value targets in his short career.<eos> They say for his final mission, he was hired by the Brits to poison a Venezuelan general in '88.<eos> So, the operative escaped in the helicopter, but they shot it down.
She's got some kind of database or something that she says will help us find little Derek.<eos> And she's hot.<eos> I trust her.<eos> So, before Bieber died, he Twitpic'd this look.<eos> He posted it to the blogspot for his summer concert tour.
What about this one?<eos> Something about an enemy.<eos> It needs to be destroyed before it gets to us.<eos> Wait.<eos> I had a case study in Brazil... where my patient didn't describe the circle... as "fear." He referred to it... as "enemy."
- Watch it.<eos> This old radar truck was supposed to go to the Smithsonian.<eos> They never picked it up.<eos> It's a good thing they didn't.<eos> Yeah, drive it to the highest point. The higher, the better.
But my dad said the first time should be special.<eos> Well, you're the king now.<eos> Yeah, I am the king.<eos> But I think I should share this moment with all the kingdom.<eos> Eat it!
Give me that. Hey, I could use some of that giddy-up in HR if you two ponies are looking for a new stable.<eos> I am looking for a new stable, Mary. Thank you so much.<eos> We'll talk later. Mary, you're showing a lot of neck. Breaking your own rules.<eos> It's a little skanky, isn't it?<eos> -Plug it in.
Yeah.<eos> I have to wonder why she'd lose touch with her dealer, with her drug problem and all that.<eos> Keep your fucking voice down, mate.<eos> And I'm not a dealer, okay?<eos> I deal in pleasure, and I deliver it to a very select fucking few.
By the time he got out, he had become affiliated with one of the Numbers gangs.<eos> With the gangs, in blood you go into them, and only in blood do you get out.<eos> After Isaac was killed... Bianca couldn't see any good in the Cape Flats.<eos> She blamed me for his death.<eos> Said I should have been able to stop it.
- I'm gonna seal the well.<eos> Do not touch that button.<eos> - You need to hit the EDS.<eos> - We don't have the authority.<eos> You ain't pushing it.
Dale, the boat's leaving!<eos> My crane's gonna take the goddamn derrick out.<eos> - It's coming down!<eos> - Get on the boat now!<eos> I gotta stop it or it's gonna kill us all.
Stay away.<eos> Grandpa, did you take your pills today?<eos> The key to my gun cabinet, it was in the drawer.<eos> And now it's gone.<eos> Yeah, Dad took it, all right?
Shall we?<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Wait for me.<eos> I mustn't forget our calendar.<eos> Could you fetch it from the parlor please, Miss Avocet?
And then we saw this buck and you raised the rifle, but the buck just looked at you, kept on grazing.<eos> It wasn't afraid.<eos> You tried and tried to pull that trigger, but you couldn't.<eos> So you started crying like a little girl.<eos> So I had to take the rifle and kill it for you.
Yeah.<eos> I'm not a bad man, but in certain situations,<eos> I have to ask myself, what would a bad man do?<eos> I appreciate you leaving my name out of your testimony.<eos> I didn't really see a reason to include it.
- North.<eos> If they keep after us, we'll kill them in the mountains.<eos> The magnet.<eos> Too heavy.<eos> - Useless. - I'll have it.
There is an underground canal here.<eos> Has it been breached?<eos> The Tao Tei should all be above ground.<eos> And the one we captured?<eos> We load it up. We feed him.
Spill my blood. But do not go back in the Animus.<eos> Why?<eos> The Apple contains the genetic code for free will.<eos> They will use it to destroy us.<eos> I'm gonna find it. And watch them destroy you and your Creed.
It's insurance.<eos> In case Geran tries to kill us instead of giving us the money.<eos> Don't you forget that.<eos> "Where are we going to get a decoy truck?"<eos> We'll steal it.
Who's going to curl my hair for me?<eos> Welcome, stranger!<eos> I'm the man who asked for whisky and water.<eos> Really?<eos> Nick, the gentleman takes his whisky the way he likes it.
Oh, Mr. Blackburn, um...<eos> Sorry, he said I should...<eos> I'm the person who first noticed the missing... - What I think was the missing money.<eos> - Yes, I understand.<eos> I'll find it.
Obviously.<eos> Silly of me.<eos> What else?<eos> She is not your problem.<eos> Straight to the trailer, hook it up, and disappear.
Because you people keep paying so much attention to it.<eos> Sacajawea.<eos> - And the circle just keeps on turning.<eos> Thank you.<eos> So let's try to ignore it.
Oh!<eos> (RASPS) You were a dancer, weren't you? ODETTE:<eos> Of course I was a dancer, Sherlock Holmes.<eos> (SHRIEKS) To pirouette, you must become the mistress of your dizziness.<eos> Stare at a spot, and don't ever lose it.
No.<eos> That wasn't the plan. Ow!<eos> All right, that's it!<eos> You have wasted my time!<eos> - Wait. - That transport truck leaves at dawn... and I'm not missing it, so give me your tag.
- What do you do?<eos> Nothing.<eos> What is this letter?<eos> A letter from my mother.<eos> Open it up.
Still, as deputy superintendent, I'd be happy to take a greater interest in Bobo.<eos> I need to powder.<eos> Was that necessary?<eos> I didn't start the fight, Joseph.<eos> So, don't criticize me for how I finished it.
(TIRES SQUEALING)<eos> (CRASHING)<eos> (PANTING SOFTLY)<eos> (FIRE CRACKLING)<eos> JOE : I walked half a mile, stole a car in North Reading, and replaced it with a Dodge I found in Somerville.
Okay.<eos> Um...<eos> There's a gravestone out back.<eos> It's probably an old dog's, but it scares Lucas.<eos> Would you dig it up and make sure it's nothing?
Yeah, whatever you need to tell yourself, that's fine.<eos> From what I can see, your wee band won't do too well without me.<eos> No...<eos> Whatever power this mirror contains, I'll not let Freya wield it.<eos> We'll find it, and we'll bring it to the Sanctuary.
Thank you.<eos> Where did you find this place?<eos> Yelp? It's my job to find places like this.<eos> I talk to people, I go places.<eos> And when I find a place that I like, I like to share it with people I like.
Stay in my shadow.<eos> - Why?<eos> - Just do as I say.<eos> Hail, thou Great God Ra.<eos> Normally, when a bird lands on my boat, I kill it before it can shit.
- It's the quality of the bait.<eos> - It's too dangerous.<eos> - Are you worried about me?<eos> No, it's just my aim with a spear is not what it was.<eos> Then get closer before you throw it.
I know.<eos> Father...<eos> I noticed the tower.<eos> Impressive.<eos> I built it for you.
Even beyond death, she's trying to help us.<eos> Come, demon!<eos> Set has Ra's spear.<eos> He's drawing Apophis to the Nile, to the source of all life.<eos> Why? To drink it.
To destroy all creation.<eos> Ra isn't dead.<eos> And only he can make this right.<eos> But he needs his spear.<eos> So how do we get it back?
I've always been lucky with one-eyed jacks.<eos> Bring them<eos> Chisolm?<eos> Should I know that name?<eos> You should know it from your obituary.
Nice to meet you, Count.<eos> - No, citizen.<eos> I am citizen deputy Malfete.<eos> Titles don't exist anymore.<eos> - If you don't want your title, I'll take it.
You're being rude.<eos> I think it's a reasonable interview question, given the scope of the job.<eos> True or false?<eos> This man has to wipe my ass.<eos> I'd wipe it in such a way that when I was done, there would be no shit left on your ass.
What?<eos> No.<eos> It is a problem.<eos> It's a huge problem.<eos> No, you can go up and take a look at it and then tell me about it.
We need protection, we've got a record to do tomorrow.<eos> I need protection. And you shall have it.<eos> Get me protection.<eos> We'd enjoyed very much doing A Hard Day's Night.<eos> We had kinda taken it seriously, but with the film Help!
Mama?<eos> Yeah?<eos> Why is my name Hannah?<eos> Well, your name is very special because it is a palindrome.<eos> It reads the same forward and backward.
It's all right.<eos> It's all right.<eos> Darling,<eos> I brought you some tea.<eos> I'll just leave it here.
Or, so I thought.<eos> Look...<eos> I found this.<eos> The first hat I ever made.<eos> I thought I'd tossed it away long, long ago.
Yes. That's a nasty fall.<eos> You cannot change the past.<eos> Though I dare say, you might learn something from it.<eos> The first hat I ever made.<eos> I thought I'd tossed it away long, long ago.
You cannot change the past.<eos> Though I dare say, you might learn something from it.<eos> The first hat I ever made.<eos> I thought I'd tossed it away long, long ago.<eos> He kept it.
Jeremy chalker.<eos> He lets me stay here in exchange for shooting coyotes.<eos> Cold beer in the fridge.<eos> You stole my hat.<eos> I borrowed it.
Hell, they were less cooperative than Toby's attorney.<eos> Marcus, he's not a suspect and you are retired.<eos> Oh, I hear you.<eos> You like the desk?<eos> I don't hate it.
But you won't be alone.<eos> It's gonna haunt me, too.<eos> If you stop by, maybe I'll give you peace.<eos> Maybe.<eos> Maybe I'll give it to you.
And I, too, shall be a Sabbath-keeper... ..from this day forward.<eos> ("IN THE SWEET BYE AND BYE" PLAYS)<eos> "I gave them my Sabbaths to be a sign between me and them "that they might know that I am the Lord.<eos> "Therefore, the Son of Man is Lord also of the Sabbath,<eos> "and God blessed the seventh day and sanctified it,
Edson, why don't you eat?<eos> Because he's full of all the food he shouldn't be eating.<eos> Now, Willie, stop trying to get your brother in trouble.<eos> Our focus should not be on a list of bad foods.<eos> It is more important that you understand your body is the temple of God, and you must treat it accordingly.
And then Saint Peter would go off to sleep, and tell me to wake him up when it's time to open the Gates for the Judgement.<eos> Well, come on, I'll make you a big batch of biscuits.<eos> Hey, Troy.<eos> Saint Peter got your name in his book.<eos> I seen it.
But he got your name, though.<eos> One morning, Saint Peter was looking at his book, and he was marking it up for the Judgement, and he let me see your name.<eos> He got it in there under "M."<eos> He got Rose's name.<eos> I ain't seen it like I seen yours, but I know it's in there.
That's 365 days.<eos> I want you to come home tomorrow after work.<eos> Rose, I don't mess up my pay.<eos> You know that.<eos> I take my pay, I give it to you.
I'm taking this cake down to the church for the bake sale.<eos> Lyons was by to see you. He stopped by to pay you your $20.<eos> It's laying right here on the table.<eos> Well, here go this money.<eos> Well, put it in there on the table, Troy.
- Put my bat down.<eos> - Come on, put me out!<eos> What's the matter?<eos> You so bad. Put me out!<eos> You're gonna have to use it.
- Come on, put me out!<eos> What's the matter?<eos> You so bad. Put me out!<eos> You're gonna have to use it.<eos> You want to draw that bat back on me, you're gonna have to use it.
I don't want to be Troy Maxson!<eos> I just want to be me.<eos> You can't be nobody but who you are, Cory.<eos> That shadow wasn't nothing but you growing into yourself.<eos> You either got to grow into it, or cut it down to fit you, but that's all you got to make a life with.
We'd go for walks.<eos> We'd take naps.<eos> We were both big nappers.<eos> I got out one night, chasing a butterfly, or a car.<eos> By the time I had caught up with it and ate it...
You're hitting things on purpose!<eos> Heh. You know me too well, TD!<eos> Always keeping me in check.<eos> Do you see the van?<eos> Yeah, I see it.
Heh. You know me too well, TD!<eos> Always keeping me in check.<eos> Do you see the van?<eos> Yeah, I see it.<eos> We're about to hit it.
- We write a song.<eos> - We write a song.<eos> - It is called "boat". - "Boot".<eos> He goes so ...<eos> Let's sing it simple.
Look at these waterfalls, the fjords, the rolling hills of Corvoxian snodgrass!<eos> This is exactly what I need.<eos> But, sir, that entire region is heavily patrolled by the Galactic Rangers!<eos> We will have this planet!<eos> And we will take it by going on the offensive.
No, wait.<eos> Go on. I think we need to hear what you both have to say.<eos> Well, while we can't move a planet out of the way... I was thinking, what if we could move the weapon targeting that planet?<eos> Move the Deplanetizer?<eos> Knock it off course.
My question to everyone standing here is, is he honoring you, Tasha?<eos> Because when I went through this phone, here... I'm not gonna lie to you. I was kinda thrown off by what was going on in the contact list.<eos> Especially Favorites, because the first name I came across was Colette.<eos> I said, "Who is Colette?" More importantly, "What's her ringtone?"<eos> So I played it.
Bree?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Who is that?<eos> What's her ringtone?<eos> So I played it.
Get off my ankle!<eos> Leave me alone!<eos> I don't wanna die like this!<eos> I don't care!<eos> You can keep it!
Blueberry?<eos> Pass.<eos> Come on out, Judy.<eos> Take the case.<eos> Get it to Bogo.
You'll find it in the glove compartment of your car.<eos> Mr. Wayne.<eos> Did you get it?<eos> The rock?<eos> Yeah, we got it.
Nick barrow can.<eos> Understand this:<eos> Each one of you made a decision to be standing here the day you decided to reach under the table and take the money.<eos> He's fighting. And you don't fight this hard unless you have a good goddamn reason.<eos> Find it!
- Don't kill me. - Shut up.<eos> You don't know me, all right?<eos> But I know you.<eos> You and Pope made a deal.<eos> He's dead, but he's making it good.
She's dead.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Here.<eos> Take the computer.<eos> Have it scanned.
"The wolf that keeps it will prosper... "But the wolf that breaks it will die.<eos> "Like the creeper that girdles the tree trunk... "The law runneth over and back.<eos> "For the strength of the pack is the wolf... "And the strength of the wolf is the pack."<eos> Soon, the rain ceased to fall and the dry season arrived.<eos> Heat crept through the jungle... Turning it yellow... Then brown...
So we agreed to work with her to find Zobrist's project.<eos> And when Dr. Sinskey brought you in, we saw an opportunity.<eos> - It was Elizabeth who came to see me.<eos> Dr. Sinskey got the Faraday pointer from Agent Bouchard.<eos> She brought it to you to decode.
And when Dr. Sinskey brought you in, we saw an opportunity.<eos> - It was Elizabeth who came to see me.<eos> Dr. Sinskey got the Faraday pointer from Agent Bouchard.<eos> She brought it to you to decode.<eos> And she even secured it with your thumbprint.
During the Plague of Justinian 5000 people died every day in the streets of Istanbul.<eos> The border between East and West, another doorway.<eos> Which is why he chose it.<eos> If the bag's intact, we can contain it.<eos> But if someone ruptures it before we get there 95 percent of the Earth's population will be infected in four to seven days.
No, it comes with the responsibility to take action when others won't.<eos> You wanna do something?<eos> Fine.<eos> Then scream at the top of your lungs and invent and lead!<eos> If you love humanity, if you love this planet, you'd do anything to save it.
We have both seen the same inhuman spirit.<eos> It's a warning. If we keep doing this, you are going to die.<eos> Your visions are a gift from God.<eos> And if God is showing you my death, then he's doing it for a reason.<eos> Maybe you're meant to prevent it from happening.
"You didn't ask for me.<eos> "But I will follow you until your death."<eos> Your name.<eos> You didn't ask for it. It was given, when you were born.<eos> That's it! Knowing the demon's name gives us power over it and we can cast it out.
Yeah, sure, but we don't know its name.<eos> But, maybe we do.<eos> Huh?<eos> Why else would he give us that clue?<eos> He must think that we know it somehow.
I asked you.<eos> Tell me who you are!<eos> And you told me.<eos> You told me your name.<eos> And I wrote it down.
And I wrote it down.<eos> I need my Bible!<eos> Why? What's happening?<eos> What...<eos> The demon's name gives us power over it.
Mr. DeCourcy arrived just when he shouldn't have.<eos> Lucy Manwaring had just forced herself into Mr. Johnson's study to sob her woes.<eos> Has she no pride? No self-respect?<eos> What an impression she makes, bursting from Mr. Johnson's library, wailing like a struck child.<eos> Seeing the letter in your handwriting, she tore it from Reginald to read aloud.
Look, even if we get this stick, he'll never let us go.<eos> We can't trust Walter, okay?<eos> The Eye has a history in Macau.<eos> They're the only ones we can trust.<eos> Now, if we can get it to them, they can clear our names and get us the hell out of here.
You go grab Merritt, okay?<eos> We got a lot to do.<eos> And, hey, put your belt on.<eos> Oh, no, it's not...<eos> She took it off me and...
And if you don't, I promise you, you're gonna end up far worse than in some cushy jail cell somewhere.<eos> What if the Horsemen don't actually need you to save them?<eos> So the lab is made up of two distinct layers, the security perimeter and the clean room.<eos> The stick we're looking for should be in this core.<eos> So we're gonna have to get underneath, extract it, and replace it with a decoy.
Thank you.<eos> Okay. - There we go.<eos> Sorry, sorry.<eos> The stick's metal.<eos> How are we going to get it out? Yeah.
What you actually put your phone on was a bi-wave siphon pad.<eos> Once again, science beats magic.<eos> - So, the stick?<eos> - No.<eos> I got it.
- Fuck, Dylan!<eos> - Wait, leave them!<eos> You really think I'm gonna walk away from you?<eos> Give me the stick!<eos> Give me it!
What are you doing?<eos> Hush.<eos> Teen's in trouble. I'm trying to listen.<eos> Jacob, where's Newt's case?<eos> I think that guy Graves took it.
Yo, Amir, where are you, man?<eos> You're kidding me.<eos> Nah, nah, nah, listen...<eos> Listen, just borrow your brother's car.<eos> Just borrow it.
Farewell, brothers.<eos> Join us, Tribune.<eos> Jerusalem only bodes trouble.<eos> Trouble and this spirit he promised.<eos> We are called to receive it there, Roman.
All right. I'll let her out, okay?<eos> - Just let me get the key.<eos> - Where is it?<eos> It's in my boot.<eos> Let me get it.
You do have a plan, right?<eos> I didn't hear anything about a prisoner transfer.<eos> Well, you're hearing it from me.<eos> Let me see your movement order.<eos> I got it! Right here!
To stop an asteroid?<eos> The last two asteroids Fell exactly in the same spot.<eos> And it will happen again.<eos> We need to go there and see what attracts the asteroid.<eos> Once we know why it is coming We will find out how to send it to another place.

We need to go there and see what attracts the asteroid.<eos> Once we know why it is coming We will find out how to send it to another place.<eos> This plan is so stupid that i wish it had a face i can smash!<eos> Let me get this straight.<eos> instead of running away from a deadly asteroid You want us to run directly towards it ?
It does not fix anything , does it? Your...<eos> I need a bath or a massage.<eos> Who knows acupuncture?<eos> I have to release my anger. Get out!<eos> I've concealed it for too long
This is not working!<eos> Hot air in pipes<eos> Manny, I have a plan.<eos> We have to let the crystal go.<eos> You know we try to put it on the volcano, right?
This is the best lead we've had on Rumlow in six months.<eos> I don't want to lose him.<eos> If he sees us coming, that won't be a problem. He kind of hates us.<eos> Sam... see that garbage truck?<eos> Tag it.
Hey, you wanna see something cool?<eos> I pulled something from Dad's archives.<eos> Felt timely.<eos> FDR signed the Lend-Lease bill with these in 1941.<eos> Provided support to the Allies when they needed it most.
Stay down.<eos> Final warning.<eos> I could do this all day.<eos> That shield doesn't belong to you.<eos> You don't deserve it.
That was 20 years ago.<eos> And we're here to help.<eos> And I'm black.<eos> The Russians are blacks now.<eos> If we fix the well, you can't blow it up.
Look, I...<eos> - I'm sorry--<eos> Right.<eos> - Hi. - Did you nick an orderly's uniform?<eos> No, I didn't nick it.
Do you know whose cat this is?<eos> Wait, I have a hurt cat here.<eos> It's you, with the dogs.<eos> Yeah, it's just in there.<eos> What did you do to it? Me? I didn't do anything.
- Wing Commander.<eos> - Frank.<eos> Have a seat.<eos> We haven't been introduced.<eos> Okay, Frank, whatever the job is, I don't want it.
No, not that elbow! The other one!<eos> Now it's on your foot!<eos> The other foot!<eos> It's on your bottom!<eos> I gots it.
- OK.<eos> - Can you reach it?<eos> There you go, grab your pack.<eos> - There you go.<eos> - I've got it.
There you go, grab your pack.<eos> - There you go.<eos> - I've got it.<eos> - Good work.<eos> - I've got it, I've got it.
Why you stay here, not go home, and family?<eos> Are you kidding?<eos> It...<eos> My left foot is on top of a mine!<eos> If I move it...
Once an outcast, I am now one of three chosen Elders.<eos> From hunted to the highest honor.<eos> I have lived 1000 years.<eos> I may live 1000 more... or I may die tomorrow.<eos> But I no longer fear death... for I have known it once already.
- What about this one?<eos> - Yeah, go for it, Lewis.<eos> Ya know, here's a question:<eos> Somebody builds a safe in the back of a grocery store, right? Yeah.<eos> - And we found it.
Do you know what a television is?<eos> Pictures.<eos> Water.<eos> Water.<eos> You can open it.
Very proud and very excited with this next chapter in your life. - To success!<eos> - Excuse me guys?<eos> Are you still waiting on someone?<eos> Or can I take this plate away?<eos> - Yeah, you can take it away.
- Excuse me guys?<eos> Are you still waiting on someone?<eos> Or can I take this plate away?<eos> - Yeah, you can take it away.<eos> - No no no, you can leave it.
- No no no, you can leave it.<eos> No, take it.<eos> I'd like to keep it. Thank you.<eos> You don't really think he will turn up, do you?<eos> No, just leave it, son.
Yeah.<eos> Yeah, you'd call, and we'd have to tell him you called.<eos> Well, what are we gonna do?<eos> When I was in the kitchen, we had to season a roast.<eos> I had to put my hands underneath it and turn it over.
You mean service like in Geneva?<eos> -That was a mistake.<eos> Shouldn't have pushed you into that.<eos> -You didn't push me into it.<eos> I asked for exposure to field ops, you gave it to me. I don't hold that against you.
A warmer climate could help.<eos> If Hawaii is something that we decide would be better for you, I'll go.<eos> Janine, how did the White House conversation go?<eos> I made it quite clear that we were in possession of an authentic FISA court order.<eos> They wanted to see it; we refused.
- Hi.<eos> - You're closing Friday.<eos> I can't close on Friday. I have an audition, remember?<eos> Do I look like I care?<eos> Reschedule it.
No, Mom, I'm not getting paid.<eos> I'm paying to do it.<eos> He's great.<eos> He's gonna open his own jazz club. Yeah, it's gonna be incredible.<eos> No, he hasn't. He hasn't opened it yet. He needs some...
Why am I so tired?<eos> Lieutenant!<eos> Sorry.<eos> Without an engagement ring?<eos> I have it removed. In order not to lose during a shower and procedures.
Just like a boomerang.<eos> Unbelievable.<eos> Don't you start.<eos> Can I just say one thing?<eos> If that one thing is "boomerang," I'm going to tie an anchor to your nuts and throw it overboard.
And goes where?<eos> Oh, for fuck... I mean, can't we get to the next--<eos> The Western Hotel to meet the businessmen.<eos> Distributors.<eos> She was screening it for the distributors.
Very clever, Holly.<eos> Thanks.<eos> I thought so.<eos> Why did you just throw cold coffee on me?<eos> I got it in the hallway.
But we already checked that.<eos> - Spliced in.<eos> - What?<eos> It's spliced into the middle of it, right in the other film.<eos> Go get it.
It's the only thing that makes sense.<eos> - I don't think I can die.<eos> - Where's the film?<eos> It's up there.<eos> We just gotta go get it.
There are a few options on the company cars.<eos> We can arrange a test drive whenever you'd like.<eos> Company car, wow.<eos> And there's a service that will deliver it right to you, wherever you want.<eos> And if you find you're not happy with it, it's not a big deal to change it out.
Jordy, what do you got?<eos> DNA's back.<eos> You best make this quick.<eos> I do not miss kickoff.<eos> You're gonna miss it tonight.
I'm sorry.<eos> Not he, she.<eos> Yes, I suppose.<eos> Well, thank you all for a fascinating case.<eos> I'll send you a telegram when I've solved it.
He believes he is to be dragged to hell by the risen corpse of the late Mrs Ricoletti.<eos> That's a lot of nonsense, isn't it?<eos> Oh, God, yes. Did you bring a revolver?<eos> What good would that be against a ghost?<eos> Exactly. Did you bring it?
This is how we end, you and I.<eos> Always here.<eos> Always together.<eos> You have a magnificent brain, Moriarty.<eos> I admire it.
- Who knows, idiot?<eos> Get your shit together and follow me!<eos> Come on!<eos> Move your ass!<eos> Kick it!
Sarman... won't you eat?<eos> What happened?<eos> Once again he is insisting on going to Mohenjo Daro!<eos> He is upset because I said no.<eos> His anger is like a dew drop, it will evaporate in no time.
Is it really possible?<eos> We have confirmation, Master Shredder.<eos> The canister of purple ooze is at police headquarters.<eos> Take a team.<eos> Recover it at all costs.
let's talk about the future, and how we're going to change it.<eos> You're talking about stopping the Jacobite rebellion?<eos> Well, that is what we agreed to, isn't it?<eos> I thought we agreed to think about it?<eos> If there's going to be a war against the British, should we not be trying to find a way to win it instead of stopping it?
What's your experience?<eos> Remind me.<eos> Who are you?<eos> Look... when he walked into this courtroom on day one, he was wearing the cloak of presumed innocence.<eos> He's still wearing it, and will continue to unless he testifies, then he takes it off.
Remind me.<eos> Who are you?<eos> Look... when he walked into this courtroom on day one, he was wearing the cloak of presumed innocence.<eos> He's still wearing it, and will continue to unless he testifies, then he takes it off.<eos> He forfeits it the minute he goes up there.
I was never there.<eos> Now, I remember.<eos> I remember now what happened!<eos> I bailed and you wrote the whole verse.<eos> You wrote it, and I never gave you credit 'cause guess why?
I bailed and you wrote the whole verse.<eos> You wrote it, and I never gave you credit 'cause guess why?<eos> No one cares who writes shit.<eos> They just care who performs it.<eos> In fact, I think the only person in the whole universe who cares about the credit for who wrote it is you!
You feeling confident?<eos> Come on, let's let them do their thing and we'll go get a drink in the crew lounge.<eos> You sure?<eos> I could use a drink.<eos> We'll charge it to Fred's tab.
- Who said that you could talk?<eos> - I did.<eos> Just keep at it.<eos> That's not gonna help, either.<eos> You kill the power to the magnetic seal, the backup in that locker is gonna kick in and keep it shut.
On the roof.<eos> I was up there watching the sunrise and I heard something through the window.<eos> I'm a curious little monkey.<eos> Listen, Todd, I've had this proposal planned since before I even met you.<eos> So, I am gonna do it.
Okay.<eos> He's not going to bite me, right?<eos> You got it, man.<eos> No.<eos> Come on, Rog, just grab it.
Come on, Rog, just grab it.<eos> Yeah, come on, just pull back real hard.<eos> You just got to finesse it a little bit.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Take it out.
And after this trip, I hope I never have to see you again.<eos> Okay, um, you seem upset.<eos> Because you sabotaged and then stole my proposal.<eos> I didn't steal your proposal.<eos> You gave it to me.
No, I think pretty good.<eos> Making sure I say everything I want to say.<eos> Oh. Well, yeah, you know, I know that that's going to be fine.<eos> But I meant, how are you holding up with the whole Todd thing?<eos> It's pretty clear that he took your proposal or maybe you gave it to him?
Me?<eos> Are you mad at me?<eos> You stole that hat.<eos> Come on.<eos> I haven't given it back, that's all.
- Your hat?<eos> Yes, my hat.<eos> - It's a man's hat.<eos> - True.<eos> - So a man gave it to you?
Le Chasseur Frangais!<eos> For how long should it run?<eos> My entire life!<eos> This hat is driving you mad!<eos> I think I am going mad, but without it I'm nothing and I'll amount to nothing.
- Your wife told me to come here.<eos> You'll think I'm crazy, but your hat changed my life.<eos> If you hadn't lost it, I wouldn't have met the man of my dreams.<eos> I'm the one who found the hat in your ad.<eos> But I don't have it any more.
You'll think I'm crazy, but your hat changed my life.<eos> If you hadn't lost it, I wouldn't have met the man of my dreams.<eos> I'm the one who found the hat in your ad.<eos> But I don't have it any more.<eos> A tramp has it, but-
Thank you!<eos> Thank you!<eos> I found my hat!<eos> Yes, I found my hat!<eos> I found it! I found it!
I've got my memory back.<eos> I've got my memory back.<eos> This is a restricted area.<eos> It's the smell.<eos> You like it too?
Can you find that hat for me?<eos> She'll be right back.<eos> Thank you.<eos> - Thank you, Mr Aslan! - Don't mention it.<eos> You can have it.
He was polite.<eos> True that.<eos> He was polite.<eos> I've got it!<eos> I've got it! I've got it!
Yes.<eos> And so, unless I'm mistaken, it doesn't belong to you?<eos> I assume you know who it belongs to?<eos> If you don't mind, I will keep this hat.<eos> I'd like to give it myself.
This clause has cost us about five million every quarter.<eos> We've made an adjustment, and it will save us about 20 million a year.<eos> - So it's...<eos> - The item isn't our responsibility.<eos> - So we've deleted it.
We have rules about this.<eos> You can't treat people like that in Denmark.<eos> - We'll take him home.<eos> - I'm sorry, but I have an appointment.<eos> Cancel it.
It'll be all right. I'll be up in a minute.<eos> Go on upstairs, Patty. Everything will be okay.<eos> I thought it was wonderful how you dropped that ball.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - I didn't want you to catch it.
All right, girls, give it up. I won't have to call the police.<eos> Get outta my face, old man!<eos> Let's not do this the hard way, okay?<eos> I'm giving you an out.<eos> All right, give up the candy or I'll have to take it away from you.
I'm giving you an out.<eos> All right, give up the candy or I'll have to take it away from you.<eos> You touch me and I scream "rape," you cocksucking pig.<eos> Now walk away.<eos> Give it back.
- That's not a good idea, boss.<eos> Look, we love this place, too, Joe.<eos> I've been coming here since I was born.<eos> But it's just stuff.<eos> It can be replaced.
All right, let's go!<eos> I want access to every surveillance camera in the city.<eos> We'll do a grid search for that fucking triage van.<eos> It's out there somewhere.<eos> Find it.
The original by your boy George Washington over 200 years ago.<eos> The man liked to have escape tunnels attached to all his structures.<eos> They're all over D.C.<eos> The tunnel under the original church has been closed up since the '50s.<eos> But we reopened it.
Yeah.<eos> These mannequins, and his artwork would definitely qualify him.<eos> Um, I'm sorry. Do you have a letter from your uncle?<eos> You talked about that.<eos> - The lawyer handed it to me with the deed.
These mannequins, and his artwork would definitely qualify him.<eos> Um, I'm sorry. Do you have a letter from your uncle?<eos> You talked about that.<eos> - The lawyer handed it to me with the deed.<eos> - Would you mind if I take a look at it?
She said her body is somewhere on the property and the only place we haven't looked is deeper in those basement rooms.<eos> - You say these are dreams?<eos> - She also mentioned a demon.<eos> I saw this in a nightmare.<eos> Rose called it the Veiled Demon.
Are you fucking serious?<eos> I knew they... I knew they were fucking with me.<eos> - You really got that shit?<eos> - Yo, you serious? You really got that shit?<eos> - Yeah. I just picked it up.
Just come back.<eos> The '94 is actually my favorite.<eos> It's got this, uh, combination of burnt earth and plums and, like, a incense.<eos> Well, I guess you're a Scotch girl.<eos> Well, I'd drink nail polish remover if somebody handed it to me.
And I'm going to give a thousand tickets away to the soldiers, because we must support our boys.<eos> Well... I applaud your courage.<eos> And... And no one would enjoy seeing you triumph here more than I, obviously. But this place is just...<eos> It's nearly a thousand, three thousand people.<eos> Well, Lily Pons's voice filled it. She's just a little bird.
- This is December.<eos> - December?<eos> Yeah, for the calendar.<eos> I didn't tell you about the calendar.<eos> Check it.
- Well, this is amazing.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> You could make a bundle on this.<eos> Yeah, I know.<eos> I mean, I'm not gonna sell it.
Three more weeks, baby.<eos> That's it. 21 days.<eos> And what are you gonna do to me?<eos> I'm gonna take this moustache and I'm just gonna go like...<eos> Gonna rub it all over your neck.
- Even better.<eos> So you're not impressed by all this?<eos> I've always been proud of you.<eos> This place was a roach trap by the time Mama Mabel died.<eos> Now look at it.
Country boy.<eos> You know how the wind feels fluffy, like you could stuff it into a pillowcase - right before a big thunderstorm? - Mmm-hmm.<eos> Harlem's the same.<eos> Trouble smells a certain way.<eos> You can... touch it.
When you played him... who would win?<eos> Me.<eos> Just 'cause the brother's dead don't mean I gotta start changing the facts.<eos> So what will happen to this place?<eos> Ah, the bank will swoop in and take it eventually.
"You do windows, brother."<eos> That wasn't no question.<eos> We need this place open.<eos> I know.<eos> You gonna run it?
You need to get my daddy's ring back.<eos> You remember what he was like before he got strung out?<eos> Eddie's a good dude deep down.<eos> To me, what's left of him is that ring.<eos> The only reason why he didn't pawn it is because I took it away from him.
That's where your focus should be.<eos> Givin' off that Geoffrey Canada vibe, for real. That's where the money is.<eos> Oh, forget the money, Cornell.<eos> Forget the club.<eos> Sell it!
We need to keep you safe.<eos> Drink this.<eos> You can't dehydrate.<eos> I saw you looking for the shooter before you passed out.<eos> Did you see who it was?
You're welcome.<eos> Hi.<eos> Here. Come on.<eos> She's withdrawn from the case.<eos> She's assigned it to me and doesn't want anybody from the firm spending time on it, so I'm looking outside it for some help.
No, I don't think so, why?<eos> Maybe she overdosed.<eos> I still haven't received the autopsy.<eos> You should have.<eos> When did you send it?
You should have.<eos> When did you send it?<eos> I can't recall.<eos> When you asked me.<eos> You sent it here, or to the office?
During the verdict, I even feared he might be acquitted.<eos> In all sincerity, you ought to feel satisfied.<eos> Don't forget, it took 13 years of obstinacy to get this far.<eos> So today is a victory.<eos> Promise me you'll savour it.
Worrying and unpleasant And terrible.<eos> And what can we do now?<eos> Everything humanly possible.<eos> I will write a report to the Cardinal.<eos> And he will pass it on to the Holy Father at the earliest opportunity.
Where is the?<eos> Do we have eye contact?<eos> Negative, it's gone.<eos> Damn it, bishop!<eos> I had it in sight.
The atmosphere was destroyed by us.<eos> No one else is to blame.<eos> And the asteroid, Bishop?<eos> It was in the crater.<eos> I saw it with my own eyes.
I also.<eos> Why did you come back? And you risked all this?<eos> I was once a slave.<eos> I dreamed of it, like a free man walking on ice.<eos> No matter how many men tried to pull that dream out of my mind. I hid it deep in my heart.
The only thing I want to confirm right now is whether or not Christine knew that Collins was gonna shoot Otis.<eos> Your boyfriend Jeff shot and killed Teddy White,<eos> - and he shot your husband in the head.<eos> - I don't believe you.<eos> You're just trying to blame him for the robbery because you can't solve it!
Please.<eos> God, I hate these guys already.<eos> Hate it.<eos> Hate that shit!<eos> Hate it!
Doesn't look right. Let me see this.<eos> - Ray.<eos> - What?<eos> We got a letter from San Bernardino.<eos> Read it to me.
May I?<eos> I can't resist.<eos> So what do you say?<eos> We try it out at our place and then if it goes well...<eos> You roll it out nationally.
To our children.<eos> May they have your talent.<eos> And your filthy mind.<eos> A girl will poison the rum.<eos> Lady Crane is the only one who drinks it.
Together they equal all the others.<eos> We can start small and build.<eos> The North remembers.<eos> They remember the Stark name.<eos> People will still risk everything for it, from White Harbor to Ramsay's own door.
I've sworn to protect you, my lady.<eos> You heard them.<eos> We need more men and my uncle has an army.<eos> We can send the Blackfish a raven.<eos> Can't risk Ramsay intercepting it.
I ran off and joined them the next day, never looked back.<eos> You're very good.<eos> My final speech is shit.<eos> But to be fair to myself, which I always like to be, the writing's no good.<eos> So change it.
Now, pay attention.<eos> You put your left hand on the back of the lady's head.<eos> Your right hand holds the small of the lady's back like so.<eos> Very romantic.<eos> Take your middle finger, yeah, and you jam it right up her bunghole.
The way she looks at him.<eos> The way all women look at him is frankly irritating.<eos> I preferred working with the little brother on that account.<eos> Come on, you're the one with the magic cock.<eos> You must have shown it to her by now.
Look, you have not let me down. The world has let me down.<eos> I need you by my side now more than ever.<eos> But not on the throne.<eos> No, not until my work is done.<eos> Well, if you will not give me the throne, then I'll just have to take it.
I told you we'd make it.<eos> _<eos> All right, where's the seed?<eos> I tried to tell you earlier...<eos> Oh, please don't say you dropped it.
It's me, Wil.<eos> I'm the seed.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> I have to become the Ellcrys.<eos> That's how we save it.
Sure. Blue works, too.<eos> Yeah, I mean, either/or...<eos> Orange or blue, whatever one you're standing on, it's gonna look good.<eos> I was thinking about that, um... you know the blue rug.<eos> Maybe we don't get it, like, for my place, but... Like, what if we got it for, like, our place?
It's more about oneness and togetherness, not so much a higher being.<eos> But I'm... I'm trying to say I'm sorry, all right?<eos> This is... this is how I'm trying to say I'm sorry to you.<eos> The midnight service is the best one.<eos> -You're gonna love it. -Fuck, no.
I'll pay you more than I owe you. I'll give you a big tip.<eos> No.<eos> You just go home, get your money, then come back and get your coffee.<eos> Dude, I fucking need this coffee right now, please, dude.<eos> I need it to, like, you know, get shit going.
And release!<eos> Yeah!<eos> Perfect shot!<eos> Not bad.<eos> And what's your plan for getting the fish into the boat, so we can actually eat it?
Eleven years ago, I lost my sister.<eos> She fell in love with a fool and betrayed our father!<eos> She was an ungrateful coward!<eos> Who's the coward now?<eos> I got it!
She fell in love with a fool and betrayed our father!<eos> She was an ungrateful coward!<eos> Who's the coward now?<eos> I got it!<eos> I got it!
My father's fortress.<eos> Yes.<eos> The last piece of the armor.<eos> It's here?<eos> Follow the setting sun and you'll find it, in the place that might have been your home.
Off.<eos> I think I slept on something.<eos> Sword uncomfortable.<eos> The helmet, I know where it is.<eos> I saw it in a dream, Beetle.
-But?<eos> -But the port isn't really the issue.<eos> Of course it is.<eos> The port is Marseille's greatest asset.<eos> Unless we develop it, we're finished.
Julieta.<eos> And this wonder is Antía.<eos> Have you got a case?<eos> Yes, a brown one, it's got my name on it.<eos> Can you get it?
We could spread false word that she's at Gotham General, but what happens when Fries attacks?<eos> It's filled with people who are too sick to move.<eos> This is the rational way to go.<eos> Sometimes the rational way is not the best way.<eos> If there were a better way, we would take it.
What are you gonna do about it?<eos> I wish I knew.<eos> I wish I knew.<eos> My health forbids me from drinking, but at least I can watch you enjoy this sherry.<eos> It was my father's favorite.
I got no one else to turn to.<eos> You know, Harvey... it's very rude to wear a hat indoors.<eos> You like the fabric?<eos> It's Italian.<eos> I love it.
Have you seen my jacket?<eos> It's freezing outside.<eos> Sorry.<eos> I was fixing the sleeve.<eos> You'd ripped it.
I was there.<eos> Remember?<eos> When you first caught the Wayne case.<eos> I know what it means to you.<eos> You think that if you can solve it, you can close the door on the past.
I went to Blackgate for murder.<eos> But that's self-defense. Well, people are scared of different.<eos> Jury sent me away.<eos> One day, these men show up. Tell me they're gonna fix my arm.<eos> Not only fix it, make it better.
Move everything you can to the facility upstate.<eos> Then destroy any evidence of Indian Hill.<eos> By destroy, you mean...<eos> You have an explosive device.<eos> Use it.
And we won't see me and Lucius as a threat.<eos> I call Bullock, he comes busting in with a hundred cops.<eos> Take them.<eos> Move everything you can to the facility upstate.<eos> You have an explosive device, use it.
Nothing... is impossible.<eos> Holy...<eos> No.<eos> This city's in deep trouble if we don't find that bus.<eos> - So let's find it.
(IN GERMAN ACCENT) We have ways of making you sign the papers!<eos> We are so fucking close, I can smell it, man.<eos> "Smell it?" It's that German pussy you had last night.<eos> You know what? I hate that fucking mustache.<eos> Let me shave it into a Hitler mustache.
I'll have you know I didn't order these.<eos> I found them.<eos> Am I the only person in this city who doesn't just do whatevs whenevs?<eos> Well, fudge that sugar.<eos> Fudge it to heck, where a demon with a thousand wee-wees fudges it forever!
Well, his references aren't too clever.<eos> Luckily for you, old Jorge was so desperate for a sous chef, he didn't bother to check them.<eos> You faked them, Pine?<eos> I needed the job.<eos> I needed it fast, I didn't have time for formalities.
We have one, two, three cups.<eos> You lay one cup like that, one cup like that, one cup like that...<eos> All right?<eos> Now, I'm going to take the ball and I'm going to place the ball in the cup.<eos> Shake the cup. Turn it over.
Oh, boy.<eos> Look.<eos> Guess your daughter found your vibrator.<eos> Stella.<eos> She just keeps finding it.
I served God, tended my flock... but I questioned.<eos> Then I went into your house... and I saw the devil was real.<eos> And I didn't question anymore.<eos> My path was clear.<eos> I don't believe it's a coincidence that you set me upon that path, and here you are, walkin' it yourself, facing all this again.
- Was it?<eos> - I examined the code.<eos> It had been altered.<eos> A clumsy set of fingerprints left by one of QA's technicians.<eos> When you find a cancer in an organization, you must cut it out before it can spread.
Yeah.<eos> My husband would kill me if I lost another handbag.<eos> Right.<eos> No ladies in your room after 7:00, and this'll be the common room.<eos> You may enjoy it any time you like.
It's a simple question, Kim.<eos> Did you or did you not know about this commercial?<eos> I...<eos> Yes.<eos> - He showed it to me...
I'm feeling kind of like, uh... like Carnac.<eos> Do you remember when Johnny Carson used to do Carnac?<eos> You know, he'd give the answers before the questions.<eos> You know, Ed would give him the envelope, yeah?<eos> And Johnny would hold it up to his forehead, and, um, he'd give the answer, like, "Leave It to Beaver."
I recognize his hand, by now.<eos> Everything else is in code.<eos> The seal had been removed at least three times before I took it off myself.<eos> Yeah, we're not the only ones interested in the Stuart correspondence.<eos> Can you decode it?
Oui, with any man who walks past her door.<eos> Never mind, ye wee smout.<eos> That's incredible.<eos> What did you do?<eos> There is a nerve there, and if you are fortunate enough to pierce it directly, it numbs the sensation in ze lower extremity, hmm?
Good.<eos> That's normal.<eos> And I brought you some herbs to help.<eos> They're to be brewed in hot water.<eos> And once the infusion cools, then you can apply it with a cloth.
Are you completely idiotic?<eos> Is that what you want?<eos> It's a rhetorical question.<eos> Take off your other boot.<eos> Take it off.
I bet ye Lallybroch tumshies will turn arse and run at first blast of cannon fire.<eos> Ye take that back, ye buggering wee shite!<eos> Hey, ye fancy a doing?<eos> Come on, I'll open ye from yer belly to yer bone!<eos> Put that blade down or I'll ram it up yer arse until ye taste it.
I still have things to finish.<eos> I've got a back porch.<eos> I'm 76. Probably not gonna finish it.<eos> Okay, yes, I'll give you that sandstone.<eos> - You don't have to sell it if you don't want to.
I was in there.<eos> By repeatedly telling him that he didn't have to sell to us?<eos> - I just wanted to give him some wiggle room.<eos> - That almost didn't feel worth it.<eos> I thought he knew he wasn't gonna use it.
By repeatedly telling him that he didn't have to sell to us?<eos> - I just wanted to give him some wiggle room.<eos> - That almost didn't feel worth it.<eos> I thought he knew he wasn't gonna use it.<eos> -You wanna give it back?
- That almost didn't feel worth it.<eos> I thought he knew he wasn't gonna use it.<eos> -You wanna give it back?<eos> -No.<eos> Someone else will just take it.
You'll have it. Don't worry.<eos> [door thuds]<eos> - Hey, tox screen on our shooter's heroin. Jamarr was an amateur.<eos> Cut the stuff with a synthetic opiate.<eos> Makes it hyper potent, like a easy pass to an overdose.
Come on.<eos> I hear it feels like a constant orgasm.<eos> Oh, it's gonna hurt like hell. Perfect.<eos> I'll write a song about it.<eos> Pull it out, I want to see.
Or more like a kaleidoscope of human suffering?<eos> It's not a picture.<eos> It's a feeling.<eos> Like a mist on your face on a cold morning.<eos> You can't see it in the air, but you can feel... the wetness.
I am the queen of every hive.<eos> I am the fire on every hill.<eos> I am the shield over every head.<eos> I am the spear of battle.<eos> Who but I am both the tree and the lightning that strikes it.
He just won't listen to me.<eos> Um... get that seat!<eos> I will get that seat.<eos> Gotta get that seat, Scotty. That's my seat.<eos> Nobody else touch it.
Listen to me, Mr. Pine.<eos> Your nephew is my friend.<eos> Now, I don't like dick any more than you do, but he does, but that's his business.<eos> He don't need you riding him on it.<eos> So you do that in front of me again, I'm gonna take that cane, shove it up your ass, and break it clean off.
We were in the tunnels the whole time there.<eos> - We were underground. - Right.<eos> The 12 Monkeys might be able to tell the future, but that's not how they're finding us.<eos> They must have put a tracker in me.<eos> We got to find someone who can find it and cut it out, some kind of back alley surgeon.
Shit.<eos> And there we are.<eos> Subdermal tracker.<eos> That's how they found you, my old friend.<eos> Need you to get it out of me, Ben.
Matching black bookends.<eos> Good optics, so I'm told.<eos> - You're invited, too.<eos> - Oh. Well, I was looking for an excuse to get a new Sunday go to meeting hat.<eos> Well, this would be it.
He's on the board, Archer.<eos> One word from him, and A.J. is in.<eos> Yeah, but-- Yeah, but shut up!<eos> This is your daughter's future, you dickhead!<eos> So you are gonna take his case, and you are gonna solve it, and A.J. is going to school here and then grow up to be a titan of industry or an astronaut or some other shit!
Thomas Edison! Remember?<eos> When he killed that elephant by jamming a big, fat electric cable up its asshole?<eos> What?<eos> Yeah.<eos> The kindly Wizard of Menlo Park, bought a sweet old circus elephant just to murder it.
You smell sick.<eos> I saw you.<eos> You picked one up. Can I see it?<eos> Why would it be the end of the world if it opened?<eos> The hungry pathogen would become airborne. You'd catch it by just breathing.
And what's this?<eos> I've never seen her wear it.<eos> The-the date has no significance.<eos> It's not any of our birthdays. It's not dad's death or Melissa's.<eos> I mean, what is it about that quarter that she would frame it to put it around her neck?
I want my dog. I said it.<eos> I didn't want to be here if they wouldn't let me have my dog.<eos> Sir, go to your room.<eos> The dogs have been sent to the shelter.<eos> I'm sure you can find it there.
Here, let me do it.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> Yeah, yeah. I just... A paper cut.<eos> - There's a note.<eos> - You can read it. "Dear Susan, I've written a novel that will be published in the spring.
Go home. I'll front your piece.<eos> Somebody'll come by with what you're owed. When?<eos> Tomorrow.<eos> The next day.<eos> Don't worry, you'll get it.
Thanks again.<eos> These people are responsible.<eos> Those are the fuckers that killed your son.<eos> So now what?<eos> Tomorrow we get a search warrant, serve it as soon as the judge signs off.
He's as much in the dark as I am about what you're up to.<eos> I got a friend who works out at a gym near PAB.<eos> He says that Irving's in there every day at lunch.<eos> Hitting the heavy bag.<eos> Wearing it out.
We've changed our assessment of the case.<eos> The surviving officer's cooperating.<eos> She's given a statement.<eos> She has?<eos> According to her, Nash planned your husband's murder, and she and his accomplices carried it out.
We'll look at the calendar.<eos> May and June book up first.<eos> Forgive me, Mrs. Allen, but why our church?<eos> You don't look Armenian, and your name...<eos> My late husband changed it for business reasons. - Avakian.
So you just laid down on it.<eos> - I had no choice.<eos> - Fuck that, no choice.<eos> And what about his real name? Did you ever get it?<eos> The assholes wouldn't give it to me.
I need to be there for Maggie.<eos> - I said no.<eos> - Carl. Look, you were wrong before.<eos> This place isn't too big to protect.<eos> And you need to stay back and help protect it.
Just go.<eos> I'm not leaving you.<eos> I said go.<eos> Please, just go.<eos> If you care about anyone, M... There is a price, Morgan, and you're gonna pay it.
Give me your shit... or I will kill you.<eos> Today was career day.<eos> We invested a lot so you would know who I am and what I can do.<eos> You work for me now.<eos> You have shit, you give it to me.
Something like that.<eos> I won't let them find you.<eos> This could all be over if you just turn over the mortal cup.<eos> That's not gonna happen.<eos> After all these years, you're still after it?
They mean nothing to me.<eos> Kill them both if you like.<eos> My people want the cup.<eos> Why do you think I've been hanging around here all these years?<eos> Now, when I find the cup... I'm gonna keep it.
Clary, come on.<eos> I don't see the mortal cup!<eos> We searched.<eos> It's not in the loft.<eos> Just because you couldn't find it doesn't mean it isn't there.
-¿Qué te pasa?<eos> Whoa, whoa, whoa. -No disrespect intended.<eos> -That's real Pierre Cardin?<eos> -Check the label.<eos> -Boosted it from Gimbels in the blackout.
So, how much longer we gotta wait before you knock that Misty Holloway to the number two spot?<eos> The new song?<eos> It's fly, tío.<eos> Good.<eos> Well maybe you can debut it at my fundraiser tonight.
- Frances, wait. - What?<eos> What?<eos> - You need to take the dog. - What?<eos> The dog.<eos> I couldn't keep it in the apartment. It's exacerbating Cole's allergies.
Wait, what?<eos> I didn't buy that dog.<eos> That's Diane's birthday dog.<eos> Do you remember?<eos> She asked me to take care of it.
They were starting to get ornery.<eos> My friend and I were just admiring your tattoo.<eos> We'd love to know the story behind it.<eos> I like your hat.<eos> Maybe I'll keep it.
You've never seen a greyhound, have you, Bill?<eos> Seen a few showdowns in my day.<eos> A greyhound is a racing dog.<eos> Spends its life running in circles, chasing a bit of felt made up like a rabbit.<eos> One day, we took it to the park.
What the fuck?<eos> There's a common misconception that the hosts don't log sexual encounters when they're underground for reprocessing, but... like I said, misconception.<eos> Oh, fuck.<eos> I need something. QA sent a body down here.<eos> The woodcutter from Sector 14. I want to see it.
You probably think you're on this trip because you're some kind of contender, some... some threat to me.<eos> I picked you precisely because you will never be a threat to anyone.<eos> My sister probably picked you for the same reason.<eos> I earned my place.<eos> Nobody handed it to me.
We abandoned that system decades ago.<eos> Yeah, well, there's still relays out there in the park, and it looks like someone turned one on.<eos> - Where?<eos> - An abandoned theater in Sector 3.<eos> I'm gonna go find the transmitter and figure out who else accessed it.
Logan's sister.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> And when I get home, we're getting married.<eos> Oh.<eos> The place you're after, I will help you find it.
It's the human beings who confuse me.<eos> This building isn't in any survey of the park.<eos> That's because we use hosts to do most of the surveys.<eos> They're programmed to ignore this place.<eos> They literally couldn't see it if they were staring right at it.
You promised!<eos> I didn't promise you nothin'!<eos> Mama said you'll be in trouble next time.<eos> Shut up, okay? Just go get the ball.<eos> Find it?
I'll pay you more than I owe you. I'll give you a big tip.<eos> No.<eos> You just go home, get your money, then come back and get your coffee.<eos> Dude, I fucking need this coffee right now, please, dude.<eos> I need it to, like, you know, get shit going.
Shit.<eos> What?<eos> - You bled through your bandage again.<eos> Mm-hmm.<eos> Let me change it.
Right, right.<eos> Junkyard dog...<eos> Oh, someone who's gonna be ferocious in court.<eos> Oh, well, I'm afraid I don't appear in court.<eos> I prepare the case, I don't present it.
- You know him?<eos> - I know of him.<eos> Well, the job went south and we lost the score.<eos> Well, that happens.<eos> He wants me to make good for it!
What do I do if I get a guy with a weird dick?<eos> Kent is a never-hard. Ooh.<eos> What's a never-hard?<eos> Oh, he never gets fully hard.<eos> So I just have to kind of fold his penis up like a balloon animal and shove it up in my vagina.
Lloyd says you asked him to borrow $4,000, is that right, Mac?<eos> Honey, please?<eos> - Can you...<eos> - All right.<eos> You take this check... you cash it, and then we don't ever have to see or deal with you two ever again.
- There is Sioux Falls and George McGovern - entering his headquarters at this moment.<eos> - _<eos> Mrs. McGovern with him... Eleanor McGovern.<eos> Thank you very much.<eos> I'm here among my friends in South Dakota where this campaign began almost 22 months ago. It's... And, uh, we now... we now bring it to an end tonight, and I have just sent the following telegram to President Nixon.
What in the name of all the fuck does that got to do with me and mine?<eos> How am I supposed to know?<eos> We barely got enough stock to last us through the week.<eos> We're gonna have a word with the Marcellos about my resupply.<eos> You're gonna take that little fishing boat of yours downriver and pick it up.
Why'd you leave her?<eos> We got studio until morning.<eos> Why don't you teach us your song?<eos> What Richie said about our music, how it's a mirror to our lives, or whatever the fuck it was.<eos> Let me take your song, rearrange it a bit and make it my own.
I think you might like this one.<eos> "Coffee"?<eos> Yeah, it's a political statement about skin color.<eos> Oh. Thing about coffee, it's always coffee.<eos> Drink it black, it's coffee.
You're up next, buddy.<eos> Jackson and I will be cheering you on.<eos> No, you won't.<eos> I'm not going out there, Mom.<eos> I need my super-magic scarf, but Aunt Stephanie took it.
- Ready?<eos> - Bye, honey.<eos> Hey, Uncle Jesse, do me a favor.<eos> Tommy wants a double cheeseburger.<eos> Throw it in the blender first.
Again!<eos> And now you insult me?<eos> You insult my family?<eos> You know, I got half my savings invested in this station.<eos> I believe in it.
You, too. On your feet.<eos> I'll need the key to safety deposit box number 143.<eos> Turning that handle to the left sets off the bank alarm.<eos> For a pittance, you'll risk your life to protect someone else's fortune?<eos> Pull it to the right.
- What is it you expect me to do?<eos> - You're gonna fix me.<eos> Go.<eos> Tell me... who were you stealing this pin from?<eos> Why did you want it so badly?
Mid-size firm, has a big distribution contract with that bakery company Yumtime.<eos> Been holding 50.<eos> Fundamentals are solid.<eos> I don't see the short play.<eos> I don't need you to see it.
Until... And you were there for this, Chad...<eos> Your grandfather asked me to read a putt on 3.<eos> It was a left-to-right leaker, and I told him so.<eos> I'd seen the putt all summer long.<eos> He closed the face, pulled it, missed it by a foot.
No, you won't.<eos> You need this $9 million.<eos> Because none of you... not one... Has done a single day of work from the moment your miserable prick of a grandfather fell facedown in the sand in Palm Beach.<eos> And after reviewing your holdings, your business interests, your debts, I know that this check is the only thing standing between your family and bankruptcy.<eos> So pick it up, put it in your pocket, and walk out of here.
- We can't keep the arm in the fridge<eos> - Have you found that report from '08?<eos> Do you need it?<eos> Hjörtur isn't a suspect I want to see it.<eos> Just put it on my desk
Tied up and raped. One is 19, the other is 13.<eos> Of course, they've been raped on your boat, haven't they?<eos> You maybe raped them yourself.<eos> You were looking for a snowman the other day.<eos> And you found it.
They would have killed it and no one would've known<eos> Someone had to do it, Andri<eos> Everything in that report is true, right?<eos> Yes<eos> Put it where it belongs. I'll see you tomorrow
The cluster's burning up.<eos> We're gonna lose her.<eos> - Stand back.<eos> - Liquid nitrogen?<eos> Phone companies use it to cool phone lines throughout the city.
That's a spoofed call.<eos> Warren's voice, too.<eos> Someone using recordings from his calls to Max to digitally recreate his speech.<eos> How'd this poor guy earn a faked suicide?<eos> Max found a secret code hidden in the radio signals and enlisted Warren to help him decode it.
You know what?<eos> You're right.<eos> But he can.<eos> Good thing you brought the mop.<eos> Don't travel without it, boss.
What I think, Harold, is that it's time we had another talk.<eos> Our game of cat and mouse seems to be coming to an end.<eos> I don't consider this a game, and it's not over yet.<eos> Isn't it?<eos> You uploaded the virus, but you didn't activate it.
Never mind.<eos> Turn it off.<eos> Alan.<eos> They'll hear you.<eos> When you have a bad dream, write it down on a piece of paper and put it in a box.
Your balls are going to explode, my friend!<eos> You should at least jerk off.<eos> I can lend you some magazines.<eos> You got to take the bull by the horns!<eos> But you're not strong enough to ride it.
Please.<eos> What you up to, crazy?<eos> Looks weird in here.<eos> I got a mobile router.<eos> Just hook it up to your laptop, bam, it's connected, and paid for.
Looks weird in here.<eos> I got a mobile router.<eos> Just hook it up to your laptop, bam, it's connected, and paid for.<eos> - Oh, my God.<eos> - You want me to set it up?
I did.<eos> What's it like up there?<eos> The sun was out.<eos> You gotta get my ring.<eos> I stashed it up there when he brought me in.
The sun was out.<eos> You gotta get my ring.<eos> I stashed it up there when he brought me in.<eos> It's in the bathroom.<eos> You gotta bring it down for me.
You have no idea who Don Knotts is.<eos> He was this weird little man.<eos> And in the movie, he turns into a fish.<eos> It was, uh, half a cartoon.<eos> Probably awful, but... he loved it, so I loved it.
I couldn't see the pain it caused Scott... to have to just sit back and watch.<eos> To not feel the rush that bravery gives you, that high of being part of something bigger than you are.<eos> I told Homer, the most important thing was to figure out what it was that he was taking from us.<eos> But it's one thing to make a plan.<eos> It's another altogether to execute it.
The rings of Saturn.<eos> They sing.<eos> That's where you were.<eos> I don't think Khatun's gonna give us the fifth movement.<eos> I don't think she wants him to have it.
They sing.<eos> That's where you were.<eos> I don't think Khatun's gonna give us the fifth movement.<eos> I don't think she wants him to have it.<eos> We will get it.
Is that 'cause, like, eating creates warmth?<eos> Uh, I got it from French.<eos> That was my last one.<eos> - Oh, that's cool, I'm good.<eos> - I can split it with you, if you want.
Angry. Felt like shit.<eos> I wanted to hurt someone.<eos> I fucked up.<eos> I've just been driving around with the check.<eos> I don't want to cash it.
What's that?<eos> How do you get it?<eos> It's not a thing.<eos> It's just...<eos> You just get it. It's a...
I reckon that bird was a hula. Supposed to be extinct.<eos> -That's pretty rare.<eos> -Mate...<eos> I reckon there'd be a lot of people interested in seeing something like that. And the people who discovered them would be... pretty famous.<eos> Yeah, probably some money in it too.
When I was little...<eos> I mean, when I was a kid... we lived next to a farm.<eos> - You know, next to Grandpa Leon's place.<eos> On the farm, there was a tractor.<eos> And I dreamt of driving it.
This is the emergency protocol that the Transitional Authority used in Seattle.<eos> They quelled an uprising with minimal population loss, which pleased our Hosts.<eos> How'd you get that?<eos> The Governor-General up there was a friend of mine.<eos> Your boss needs to bring this plan to Helena and convince her that he's the man to implement it.
The virus occurred earlier? Right.<eos> And much worse than we remembered it?<eos> Precisely.<eos> But there were other changes as well, at least from my perspective.<eos> Spearhead, for example. In my reality, we invaded, confiscated their core, and used it to continue our mission.
What on earth did she do?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Didn't I see you here last week?<eos> We didn't change the movie.<eos> What's the point in seeing it again?
Had a whole speech prepared, and none of my plans involved asking you to marry me with my hands in the couch because I lost the ring.<eos> Um, I can't find the ring.<eos> Oh, that's... why.<eos> That's why.<eos> Then, let's find it.
How do you, uh, see us accomplishing this, hmm?<eos> I think it's time we lean on my connections.<eos> I wake up. I'm searching my pockets. It's gone.<eos> The ring is completely gone.<eos> I can't find it.
Well, he knows talent when he sees it.<eos> How about this?<eos> An enhanced motion detector. Gives you accurate readings from up to 50 feet away.<eos> If anybody tries to sneak up on you, this will tell us.<eos> Do you know how it works?
Do you know how it works?<eos> I think I can figure it out.<eos> What are you doing in here?<eos> I brought you back your memory inhibitor.<eos> Thank you so much for letting me use it.
And I cannot stress this enough... Do not let her touch you.<eos> Fine.<eos> No touching.<eos> Dr. Wilkes designed this device to administer a fast extraction.<eos> You depress the vacuum button the side and then release it once the needles have made contact with the skin.
Dottie is my responsibility.<eos> I wouldn't abandon her or anyone else to the likes of Whitney Frost.<eos> Don't abandon her.<eos> The kill switch on that necklace is attached to a different circuit.<eos> Activate it and be done with her.
People have a psychological need to find the super-villain, but in my experience, reality is a lot more complicated.<eos> So who is Geronimo?<eos> That's a very good question.<eos> You've never brought me behind the curtain before-- why now?<eos> Well, you were forced to take this job, but there are legitimate reasons for you to be doing it.
What the hell is wrong with him?<eos> Why wouldn't he tell us this?<eos> The remote trigger you designed... it's on a radio frequency, correct?<eos> Yes.<eos> Which means you can block it.
Have a good day, y'all. - Bye-bye.<eos> - Say, uh, what's the name of that movie With ronald reagan and the monkey?<eos> - "bedtime for bonzo." - ah. - Bonzo was good.<eos> Movie was terrible.<eos> - Never saw it.
- Yeah, let's do that.<eos> - Sister Act 2. - No, I'm not watching that shit.<eos> - What?<eos> - Oh, why?<eos> You already watched it today?
Well, I wouldn't say that.<eos> Did threaten to shoot you.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I remember. It's not your fault entirely.<eos> Vernon Masters saw your boundless ambition and took advantage of it.
What is it?<eos> - The radio controller's not responding.<eos> - Can you fix it? - Working on it.<eos> - The rift is becoming unstable.<eos> We need to shut it down before we lose control of it.
Y-You're not my supervisor.<eos> As a supervisor, I feel obligated to tell you your actions were ill-advised and reckless.<eos> Ill-adv... Reckless?<eos> ! You're damn right.<eos> By your own professed rules, you should've allowed me to be sucked into the rift and shut it down, period.
(Vehicle approaching) Julian... You've got to be fucking kidding me.<eos> Ricky: Good luck dealing with this shit, Julian.<eos> (Engine amp; music stop) Julian: What the fuck do you want?<eos> Oh, hello to you too!<eos> Uh, I just stopped by to make sure that you weren't destroying my park before I get it back, Julian.
Yeah, 'cause this is for, like, beach balls and footballs and things.<eos> I got a air compressor. Why didn't you just use that?<eos> Because I couldn't drive the car over there, the fucking tire was flat.<eos> No, Ricky, it's air... it's portable.<eos> You could have just brought it right here and just...
Are you okay, bud? No, Mr. Lahey.<eos> What the hell's going on, Barb?<eos> What do you want?<eos> What I want, Jim, is justice.<eos> Look, that park was stolen from me. And from you. And I want it back!
What I want, Jim, is justice.<eos> Look, that park was stolen from me. And from you. And I want it back!<eos> And so should you! But I don't, Barb. Don't you get it?<eos> I don't want it back.<eos> You want it back? You get it back and keep my goddamn share!
The baroness was infertile.<eos> Not experiments.<eos> A cure.<eos> She was pregnant the night of the wedding.<eos> Before they burned her... the villagers cut out the fetus... and threw it in the aquifer.
This is where you began.<eos> I don't want to.<eos> You know... you look just like she did on her wedding night.<eos> The night they took her from me.<eos> The villagers cut out the fetus and threw it in the aquifer.
Then we're at an impasse.<eos> Does it hurt?<eos> He's ready.<eos> Takes away pain.<eos> It doesn't cause it.
_ _ _<eos> Wanheda... vengeance is yours.<eos> No.<eos> I don't know if your death would bring me peace.<eos> I just know I don't deserve it.
When you say "real magic," you still mean it's all fake, though.<eos> Right.<eos> They don't do, like, real magic.<eos> It's not like they're wizards or something.<eos> Ideally, you want to do a trick better than everyone else, you know, make it your own, put your own personal stamp on it.
Now, they throw them out at the first problem.<eos> A relationship is the same. No desire, out it goes.<eos> But nobody's perfect.<eos> Antoine called me.<eos> I sent him Boris's estimate. He finds it reasonable too.
Don't sleep with her.<eos> Oh, man.<eos> It is absolutely amazing out here, Zack.<eos> How do you afford this location though?<eos> My dad left it to me.
- Let Porthos go. - No.<eos> I never walk away from a fight.<eos> This is not how you change things, Christophe.<eos> You both know, the enemy never gives you victory.<eos> You have to take it from them.
- Oh... Oh! "Show us your dick."<eos> - No.<eos> Show them.<eos> Don't even think about it.<eos> Let's see it. Come on! Come on!
That's... It's not gay.<eos> It's torture.<eos> - No.<eos> - That is different.<eos> Taking my fingernails off, or fucking making me stay awake for 12 weeks is torture, but greasing up a dildo and pretending it's your own dick and wanting to stick it in me, that's homosexuality.
Like I said, I think there's only one way in and there's no way to bust through that door without waking up the rest of them.<eos> We don't need to.<eos> They're going to open it for us, let us walk right in.<eos> They want Gregory's head, right?<eos> We're gonna give it to them.
Using your cabeza, this whole DIY ammo thing, that is your damn skill set, just like ghosting hostiles, both of the undead and the living variety, is mine.<eos> Now, you truly want to survive this world long-term, I suggest you learn that posthaste.<eos> Okay.<eos> Thank you for your protection.<eos> I most certainly needed it between here and Houston.
Where's the other car?<eos> We added two more cars yesterday.<eos> One of them's missing, the one we put right between those houses.<eos> You can barely see between the houses from up top, especially at night.<eos> The note, can I see it?
The village is about a mile; it's a beautiful walk, and I will be up at the house if you need anything.<eos> All right.<eos> Thanks, Norma.<eos> How did you know my name?<eos> I just saw it on the card there.
I so regret it.<eos> It hurts me so much.<eos> It's all right.<eos> This rabbit's from her childhood.<eos> Maybe you could give it to her.
I'm sorry, Gerry, i shouldn't be... - It's all right.<eos> You know, Nate, maybe you're going about this the wrong way.<eos> The rallies, the speeches, the politics...<eos> That's not how the change is gonna come.<eos> It's gonna come from the unknown soldiers, from the leaderless resistance.
We've had some trouble here in London.<eos> Murders.<eos> I know you're involved.<eos> And your proof?<eos> I'll find it.
Murders.<eos> I know you're involved.<eos> And your proof?<eos> I'll find it.<eos> I always find it.
The god's words made waves across the water, they broke at the ferryman's feet.<eos> "Now tell me your name," said Thor.<eos> And the ferryman, he stood up and he shouted,<eos> "My name is Harbard!<eos> "I seldom hide it."
And I'm sorry about that, Jemma, because... Because maybe there was another way... and there was something else that I could've done.<eos> Will died saving me.<eos> What you did was kill a thing, a monster.<eos> You've been nothing less than extraordinary this whole time.<eos> So, um about this... chasm, as you call it.
We need to increase the population in the City of Light.<eos> The more minds turned to the task, the more powerful A.L.I.E. becomes and the closer we get to finding that second A.I..<eos> One problem... when Abby shut us down,<eos> Pike confiscated our chip-maker.<eos> Then we need to get it back.
You have something to say?<eos> What do you want to know?<eos> Everything.<eos> On the Ark, you taught your students about the promise of our future, about the responsibility our descendents would bear when they finally set foot on the ground.<eos> We didn't start this war, but you can be damn sure I intend to finish it.
You're ruling without the wisdom of the Commander's Spirit.<eos> Your people will soon figure that out.<eos> I can offer you something even more powerful than the flame...<eos> True legacy of Bekka Pramheda, all power, all wisdom contained in one simple key.<eos> All you have to do is swallow it.
I don't know what you're talk...<eos> No.<eos> Good.<eos> Now take out the clip.<eos> Throw it down the hall.
I thought I had it.<eos> Ah, being cooped up in a jet isn't exactly conducive to blood flow.<eos> Where's the target designator?<eos> Oh, hold on.<eos> I got it.
-What did Manny say?<eos> -I got your shift, bro.<eos> -What about the car?<eos> -The Fusion.<eos> I can reset the odometer, park it in front of your place after work.
Thanks.<eos> Enjoy.<eos> I'm David Grimes with the Cleveland Plain Dealer.<eos> Where's your credential?<eos> I was an idiot and left it in the car.
We've got enough on our plate trying to track down Malick.<eos> How'd the S.H.I.E.L.D. assessment go?<eos> Fine, I think.<eos> I guess we won't know for sure till Coulson gets the evaluation report.<eos> I got it.
Uh, it's a liquid, so...<eos> - We could freeze it.<eos> - How?<eos> Liquid nitrogen.<eos> There's, um... we use it in the cooling jets on the containment module.
Is that a technical legal term?<eos> You got a better word for it?<eos> Grace, I'm gonna level with you.<eos> Nobody wants your case.<eos> I drew it because I'm low man on the totem pole in a place where seniority means everything.
- And who are you, now?<eos> Daisy Johnson, ATCU.<eos> Um, Edwin, right?<eos> How did you know my name, Edwin, when you called 911?<eos> Because I heard you say it just now.
- Yeah, all of them.<eos> - Daisy - may, if I'm not allowed to go on the mission myself, then I'm sure as hell gonna do everything I can from here.<eos> Not all of them!<eos> Got it?<eos> She and I have built a similar algorithm to find Dr. Garner, and a number of the servers are running it.
I sentence you to death.<eos> Do you understand?<eos> Stop, stop.<eos> Look... here's the dagger.<eos> Place it here.
The other one! The other man!<eos> We cannot allow him!<eos> Steel yourself for the work ahead, Henry.<eos> If you cannot endure the nightmare, you should not lie down for the sleep.<eos> I can endure it!
I have endured it my whole life!<eos> Good, for I think I can help.<eos> With what?<eos> The regression.<eos> I believe I can increase the duration of the change, perhaps even render it permanent.
This girl, she has got balls."<eos> I do have balls.<eos> Only when you're on the other side of a computer screen, you've got balls.<eos> This bikini does not scream "balls."<eos> All right. You want me to put it on? - Yes!
Hey. Your body is not a commodity.<eos> You tell you what you do with you.<eos> Chet, first of all, my body is a commodity, okay?<eos> It's my living.<eos> Funny thing I plan on protecting it.
Shut the door.<eos> All right, has anybody seen my messenger?<eos> Nothing yet, boss.<eos> Great, can you please just let me know the second it arrives?<eos> I need it, like, yesterday. Copy that.
Oh, that's my progeny.<eos> This is the future of the Wilton line.<eos> That caterwauling ball of flesh is the result of you cheating on me with your wife.<eos> It came out of her vagina.<eos> So no, I don't want to hold it.
Okay.<eos> Ladies, ladies, okay. I'm up now.<eos> - Talk to me. - I'm good. - You girls look good out there.<eos> Whoa, whoa! I think I should not play football in a suit.<eos> We should probably take it off.
I had to know. What are you talking about?<eos> "Paradise lost."<eos> Whitehall was right.<eos> Whitehall's a blowhard. He was trying to mess with us.<eos> He would swap in this stone during the ceremonies and feel for the notch to make sure he never drew it from the bag. He would never do that.
They're on their way.<eos> Are you familiar with ultra-high-energy cosmic rays, Captain?<eos> The radiation released inside this chamber will kill anyone other than me.<eos> Look, despite your impermeability to nuclear energy, you're still quite vulnerable to bullets.<eos> I just need someone to take the core offline, so I can remove it safely and shield it.
And your wallet, but it was nothing personal.<eos> What the hell is that man doing?<eos> He has no idea what the core is capable of.<eos> Relax.<eos> He's the one who invented it.
Don't flatter yourself, sweetheart.<eos> I'm not the sentimental type.<eos> No, but your partner, the physicist with the big brown eyes, is.<eos> Turn the core back online.<eos> You will turn it back on, or I will put a bullet in your friend's head.
Raymond, what's going on?<eos> The core just went back online.<eos> Sorry, Professor, I had to do it.<eos> You idiot.<eos> I... I can still remove it.
If I ever get my hands on you, I'm gonna get all "Rocky IV" on your ass.<eos> I'm gonna remember that, comrade.<eos> We must leave now, Colonel.<eos> There's still one more intruder, and he has the thermal core.<eos> We don't need it now.
We must leave now, Colonel.<eos> There's still one more intruder, and he has the thermal core.<eos> We don't need it now.<eos> We have something far better.<eos> Ugh, thank God you managed to grab it.
- Hans Juhl, SS officer from Elsinore.<eos> The bastard should be shot.<eos> He's as Danish as you and me, so keep it down.<eos> The train is on its way in.<eos> We have to stop it before the station.
I believe this is when we started to look like us, um, and when we, uh, as a species, um, started.<eos> And so, this is before we became... we acquired different skin colors.<eos> This is before we acquired different languages and we spread across different geographies.<eos> So, this is where I want to be, right at the root.<eos> So, I would love to express my... uh, my fascination to this ground by kissing it.
How are we supposed to clean the floors with nonstop bitches tracking their shit through?<eos> We are like he whom the gods have condemned to push the boulder up the hill only to watch it roll back down.
That's sweet.<eos> My papa called me solnyshko.<eos> It means little sun.<eos> But I've grown bigger and hotter since then, and he's dead.<eos> So what are you going to do with that ear, now that you've picked it?
No, it's really hard.<eos> Like, right now, it's really hard.<eos> -I know, Vinnie...<eos> -Oh, God.<eos> -Vinnie, put it inside me. -Yeah?
Yes.<eos> And we shall smite the Heavenly Father from his bloody throne.<eos> I've long dreamt of this moment, to stand at your side, close enough to touch, to smell, to feel.<eos> Give me your name.<eos> You can read it on my tomb.
You chase this son of a bitch from London to here in the middle of the Devil's asshole because it's your duty?<eos> I think there's more to Mr. Talbot than meets the eye.<eos> There's the tragedy of it.<eos> The serum only lasts a matter of hours... and then they revert.<eos> I believe I can increase the duration of the change, perhaps even render it permanent.
Let's just wait a second.<eos> - How're we gonna get there? - Fix it.<eos> Somebody fucking fix this shit.<eos> - I don't know what to say.<eos> - Fix it.
But your home is with me now. It's -<eos> - It's actually Daisy.<eos> My name is Daisy.<eos> Grant knew you as...<eos> Yeah, I changed it.
He put the recorder in the cup to amplify my voice.<eos> It didn't just amplify your voice.<eos> It gave it direction.<eos> Focus.<eos> Valack used your scream as a tool by focusing it.
It didn't just amplify your voice.<eos> It gave it direction.<eos> Focus.<eos> Valack used your scream as a tool by focusing it.<eos> If you're going to use it as a weapon, you need to learn to do the same.
Five minutes to get to Lydia.<eos> Where's the card reader?<eos> It should be here.<eos> It has to be here.<eos> They must have taken it out when the Dread Doctors got through.
Maybe someone should resurrect her.<eos> Don't leave.<eos> My dreams aren't like yours, Lydia.<eos> I'm not just a harbinger of death.<eos> I'm the cause of it.
Damnatio Memoriae.<eos> They erased every detail of him.<eos> Everything he signed, everything he owned.<eos> They burned it all.<eos> The name Sebastien Valet has been forgotten for over 150 years, but when it's remembered...
If you get me close enough, I'll do it.<eos> We're not killing your best friend.<eos> That belongs to me.<eos> It's a family heirloom.<eos> I'd like it back, please.
Yeah, and I dropped it, all right?<eos> Now I'm picking it up again.<eos> How much? I'll write you a check.<eos> It's not about how much.<eos> They want it out of here, okay?
Not before indicating what his plan might be.<eos> How do you take down a Ci...<eos> Oh, no.<eos> What?<eos> I've been thinking about what would happen if he used the web-nuke to take down the Internet, but if he used it right, overloading the electrical grid, shutting down hospital equipment, causing water main breaks.
He had no reason to lie.<eos> Whatever Reiter has planned, he's gonna kill everyone here.<eos> Mr. Queen...<eos> It appears we are within striking distance of my prize.<eos> I want you both at my side when I claim it.
Oliver Queen publicly slandered my client by accusing him of ordering a terrorist drone strike.<eos> Now, if--if Mr. Diggle can work for Mr. Queen for free to help Ms. Queen buy illegal drugs, I mean, is it really that much of a stretch to believe that he'd also perjure himself in support of Mr. Queen's<eos> campaign of character assassination?<eos> You watched me swear an oath.<eos> And then I saw you break it.
Hold on to something.<eos> - What?<eos> Why?<eos> - Why?<eos> This elevator only stops at the sublevel, and we need it to stop at the-- Aah! Conference room floor.
Now give me the damn--<eos> That was embarrassing.<eos> I have a tumor on my L4 vertebrae.<eos> The tricky little guy's wrapped around my spinal cord.<eos> The only way to cut it out involves a surgery that will leave me paralyzed from the waist down.
I have a tumor on my L4 vertebrae.<eos> The tricky little guy's wrapped around my spinal cord.<eos> The only way to cut it out involves a surgery that will leave me paralyzed from the waist down.<eos> All the bees in the world couldn't get a cripple to walk, and then I read about your miracle chip.<eos> Of course, I couldn't afford it.
Khushu is an old Arabic term for humbleness, suffice it to say, something I wouldn't associate with you.<eos> When the earliest homo magi forged these idols, they did so in the image of those whose powers they wished to channel, so attention to detail is essential.<eos> It's missing a piece.<eos> The Ribalvei stone.<eos> They must have hidden it someplace else.

Oh, my God, it worked! Ohh!<eos> Whatever you guys just did was incredible.<eos> We only took down one nuke.<eos> We still have 15,433 to go, give or take.<eos> The code to the line-of-sight hack, can you distro it to everybody?
Maybe we should call in a bomb threat, just empty the place, or maybe plant an actual bomb.<eos> Just a small one, one that doesn't hurt anybody, but we have to...<eos> Maybe we should just go in. It's... ehh... too risky to wear the gear in the daylight.<eos> What about the elevator at the old lair?<eos> Uh-uh. Mr. Dennis shut it down after the Larvan attack.
It won't eject.<eos> That never happens unless...<eos> [Alarm blaring]<eos> That. We can't leave without the processor.<eos> - We can if we clone it.
Is he seriously going full "Star Trek VI" on you?<eos> He shut our system down with a virus.<eos> It's an x-axis binumeric algorithm.<eos> I know.<eos> I created it in college. Wait.
Traumatic events recorded into their surroundings... Into time.<eos> And there are the sedatives.<eos> You don't believe in ghosts, do you?<eos> I don't.<eos> You got to open your mind, Doc, before someone opens it for you.
What?<eos> - You don't say that.<eos> - Say what?<eos> - You never say that.<eos> - No, I was gonna say I love whisky, and we should go find some and drink it.
Okay, here's what you need to do.<eos> You see that laser circuit in the back?<eos> You need to interrupt it with the mirror.<eos> Don't touch anything else.<eos> Okay, hold it there.
So, the Hidden One took this round.<eos> I say we take the next. We got to finish this thing.<eos> We got a problem.<eos> My compass, it's broken.<eos> I cannot locate the ley lines without it.
They've got their troublemakers firmly under control.<eos> You mean the Catholics.<eos> This is my home, Edward.<eos> I will not leave my children.<eos> One of whom is a wastrel and does not deserve our protection and the other who ran away and doesn't desire it.
Because it's Maureen.<eos> No.<eos> No. It's, uh... I...<eos> Simon, you don't even cook.<eos> Right, which is exactly why I probably left it on.
Get anything on our killer?<eos> Yeah, you were right.<eos> Huge amounts of demon venom in Vargas' blood.<eos> It's a shapeshifter. All right.<eos> I'm going after it.
Should have gone with the turkey pot pie.<eos> I'm just saying.<eos> Never seen anyone look so pissed off at a turkey pot pie.<eos> Just... reminds me of someone I know.<eos> You mind if I eat it?
Don't.<eos> Runaway chemical transport truck heading south on Kester.<eos> On it.<eos> Hey, I can't stop the truck!<eos> Somebody rigged it!
They should have been back by now.<eos> Well, I think this counts as absolutely necessary.<eos> I've got my exo-suit shrunk down, and I can miniaturize and do some tiny sneaking.<eos> It's been two years since you've used that suit.<eos> And that's after you scavenged it for parts for your time beacon.
We aren't going to hang.<eos> You're going to trade us.<eos> For Culper.<eos> Where did you hear that name?<eos> Sergeant Hickey must have heard it while standing guard outside my tent.
We should all go to Congress and speak.<eos> He's your relation. No, I couldn't possibly!<eos> Boy.<eos> You look like a sweet lad.<eos> May I ask you to run this letter in through that door, drop it on the big desk just inside, and then run back out?
The day shall come.<eos> The day shall come.<eos> Bram and Gracie?<eos> I'm back, and I got apple juice.<eos> Almost didn't get it.
Tschick, what are you doing?<eos> Tschick!<eos> Drive your name!<eos> My name?<eos> - So we can read it on Google Earth!
Yet the moment she started raving about firing white oak into Klaus, well, words were said, hearts broken, veins drained.<eos> You're one to talk about trust.<eos> Who was it that handed my dead husband's heart to the people that helped murder him?<eos> I bought your life with that heart.<eos> But, hey, you know what, you called me here, so if you have another plan, please, let's hear it.
Are you quite sure?<eos> I saw him with my own eyes.<eos> Finn must have come back when Davina resurrected me.<eos> The spell was tied to the blood of the Mikaelson line.<eos> Either it worked on him, or he found a way to hijack it.
That's not exactly need-to-know.<eos> This part's all you.<eos> This is it.<eos> This is the spell that created the Originals.<eos> Took an entire coven ages to reverse-engineer it.
Now, it's gonna take a little while, but if I can concentrate it in her heart, we can extract it with this... destroy it, and make sure we ain't got no more of these<eos> - unkillable monsters on our hands. - Good.<eos> In the meantime,<eos> I think I may have finally found a way to kill Lucien.<eos> Now, my mother once tried to end my siblings by reversing the Original vampire spell, and according to her grimoire, only the witch who cast the spell could undo it.
- No.<eos> Eventually, I'll give in.<eos> But there is another way.<eos> Where did you find that?<eos> The first thing I did when you brought me back was to hunt it down, to make sure that Nik wouldn't stick it in me the second I annoyed him.
Also on the detonator.<eos> You see?<eos> I'll leave the detonator with you.<eos> It is armed now.<eos> You will keep it for the Master.
Ugh!<eos> Fet, they're fighting.<eos> - With Palmer.<eos> - Turn the jammer on!<eos> Turn it on now!
I mean, it's completely random, I never...<eos> Magnus Bane?<eos> Maybe.<eos> Why? How do you know that name?<eos> I heard it from the vampire.
Have you ever seen an action movie?<eos> We'reonourway .<eos> What's taking them so long?<eos> [alarm ringing] [air hissing] It's a fire.<eos> Find it!
Father José, I haven't spoken with him for two years,<eos> I'm curious, I want to hear.<eos> He did not tell me much, Father Lucas, just asked me to deliver this letter to you.<eos> And he said the matter is one of extreme urgency.<eos> I'll read it and I'll get in touch with him.
Lucas, I know my wife, I know she's a woman of faith, a battling woman with iron health, but now...<eos> Now she has changed!<eos> She does not stop calling a priest's name, all night, she shouts the name of this priest.<eos> Do you know the name of this priest?<eos> Sorry, Lucas, I will not remember now, but your mother has jotted it down at home.
A trash!<eos> In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, and of all the saints and angels, I command you, say your name!<eos> I will not...<eos> Let's go!<eos> Say it!
Okay, that is the worst story I have ever heard.<eos> You're missing the point.<eos> Yes... the boy was devastated.<eos> But he realized his father was right.<eos> He was told to tame the bird... not to love it.
I know what kind of people they are.<eos> Are you sure?<eos> They lied to us.<eos> For years, they've been telling us how to act. That we have to uphold the Lightwood name.<eos> Well, they're the ones who tarnished it.
Of course.<eos> You're right.<eos> You hear that?<eos> Oh, it's the sprinkler.<eos> Your father will be angry if we leave it on all night.
You're a funny criminal.<eos> --But no.<eos> I pulled some strings... and I've arranged for you to lead a cooking class.<eos> I see.<eos> Thinking of calling it, the... King of the Kitchen... - Ah.
[Dalton laughing] Oh, my god!<eos> You are the cutest thing ever.<eos> I love you so much, Michael.<eos> If you love me so much, get over here and help me zip this bag.<eos> Let's close it on "three."
He was a good kid, Finn.<eos> And now he's dead.<eos> You know, maybe you've been out of the game too long to remember.<eos> Death... is part of the deal.<eos> Leave it, leave it.
Let's go.<eos> You're coming with me.<eos> The Deputy Prime Minister offered me a job today.<eos> It's in New York.<eos> Are you considering it?
It's about the war.<eos> What is?<eos> All of it.<eos> Roxxon, Midland Circle, the damn hole, Elektra...<eos> All right, you've been using this war as an excuse since the day I met you, and you still haven't told me a goddamn thing about it.
It left me puzzled for centuries.<eos> The best magic tricks have the simplest solutions.<eos> I bribed your guard with a novelty pen.<eos> Had a picture of a woman on it.<eos> Turn it upside down, her top comes off.

Thanks again.<eos> Yes. Such a tragedy.<eos> Well, it's always a tragedy when someone gets killed.<eos> No, I'm talking about his tiger.<eos> I would have bought it if I'd known.
Don't know how yet.<eos> Man, killed by your own weird award.<eos> That's gotta suck.<eos> It was actually...<eos> It was really, really touching when they got it.

Let's start with smoking pot at a crime scene.<eos> Sorry, do you want a hit?<eos> N-No. It's "puff, puff, pass," not "puff, puff, stomp angrily."<eos> You brought pot to a crime scene?<eos> I most certainly did not. I found it here.

What do you want?<eos> Just wanted to congratulate you on closing Palmetto.<eos> You and that smart, sexy lady of yours caught the guy who shot me.<eos> That's what the confession said, right?<eos> How long did it take you to write it?
I am looking for Andy Kleinberg.<eos> Do you know where he is?<eos> Don't waste your time with him.<eos> Let me get you a drink.<eos> Keep it in your pants, Tommy Bahama.
Your presence here is no longer required.<eos> You can thank my agents for completing your mission.<eos> Their idealism will doom this planet.<eos> No.<eos> That's what will save it.
It's been a long day. And something tells me it's far from over.<eos> SENATOR CRANE:<eos> Any word on the monster?<eos> Supergirl has graciously agreed to bring your attacker in personally, at great risk to herself, I might add.<eos> When she captures it, you'll be safe to go.
No, thanks.<eos> You know, they-they think I'm losing my memory.<eos> Maybe they're right.<eos> I've taken that test about a million times.<eos> Why can't I pass it?
Hey, hey, the thing we talked about with Richie?<eos> I want you to draw up the letter.<eos> - Ousting him?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Look, I'll write it, but I'm not handing it to him.
No idea.<eos> We're closed, gentlemen.<eos> Dries, Joop.<eos> We're taking that red ride.<eos> Right, If you ask politely you can touch it for a bit.
Have you seen him?<eos> - Frits, your brother has a hearse, right?<eos> - Why?<eos> Call him.<eos> Tell him Wim will pick it up.
"There's another one called Beef." "All right, let's check out Fart."<eos> "See where that ends up."<eos> I feel like... the worst part, honestly, of traveling in our country is that there's no surprises.<eos> I swear to you, I travel every week, and it's really a disappointment.<eos> Every place is exactly what I thought it was going to be.
Ladies, I just gave you top secret clearance. Okay?<eos> Um, welcome to Area 51.<eos> Yeah. I never want to hear another woman complain,<eos> "I can't get a guy to call me back."<eos> Well, take a vibrator, press it against his chode, and you will have to shut down a cell tower because that man is gonna harass you.
That shows who you are.<eos> Look at your sweater.<eos> It's ruined.<eos> It's dirty.<eos> Remove it.
So what is this place exactly, besides a health hazard?<eos> Time was, the finest meat packing plant in town.<eos> Yeah, it's a winner.<eos> Hey, that star on your arm...<eos> - I earned it.
I don't know, this thing that I couldn't shake where I felt like because nothing was ever not gonna be pointless and empty, then, uh, why go on?<eos> And then I... got here, and... it's amazing I survived as long as I did not knowing that I was a Magician.<eos> I can't go back.<eos> So, okay.<eos> There's a spell if they question you so they can't read your minds. I'll write it down.
- Who are we trying to contact? - Charlie.<eos> - And who's Charlie?<eos> - My brother.<eos> He died.<eos> - Jesus, we could not have screwed up that spell worse, and we can't take it back.
- Brief announcement.<eos> The Van Pelt fountain is temporarily off limits.<eos> There's been an incursion.<eos> We believe it's a garden variety haunting.<eos> Redrawing the wards may have released it much like a mouse caught in the walls of a building.
We believe it's a garden variety haunting.<eos> Redrawing the wards may have released it much like a mouse caught in the walls of a building.<eos> - Help! - No one was seriously hurt.<eos> Both students involved are recuperating in the infirmary.<eos> Regardless, stay away until we lock it down.
Mm, how about never?<eos> That's a growing possibility.<eos> Yes, I thought so.<eos> The spell is called a Scarlatti Web.<eos> We cannot break it.
Marina is a psycho.<eos> You were his friend.<eos> I can't--<eos> No, I didn't sign up for this shit.<eos> No, you have to go reverse it now.
I'm rather tired.<eos> [speaking Russian] [in English] "To Russians, it is culturally important to accept."<eos> I give the floor to the defense counsel, Mr. Kiyose.<eos> [man speaking Japanese] [interpreter] I would like to explain a motion I am putting forward with respect to the jurisdiction of this tribunal.<eos> The Pact of Paris, 1928, condemns war as an instrument of national policy... but does not consider it a crime.
That's repulsive.<eos> Um, listen, Joe.<eos> I showed your education proposal to Jack.<eos> Yeah... and?<eos> He loves it.
Footage surfaced on YouTube earlier this week of the culinary celeb performing a puppet show many are calling racist and offensive.<eos> Dagnammit, Chitlin' Joe, you give me back my cherry pie.<eos> Oh, I swear it wasn't me, missus.<eos> Hell, no.<eos> It was Watermelon Sam who took it.
I am aware you are anxious to take action.<eos> Each day we wait our task grows harder.<eos> The Master is building an army.<eos> I will not be rash.<eos> I made that mistake once before and I will not make it again.
I'm beginning to wonder if even more elaborate measures were taken.<eos> Come with me, Mr. Quinlan.<eos> Follow me as far as you can.<eos> Sunlight!<eos> They used sunlight to hide the text so the strigoi could never read it.
You can name her.<eos> Anything you like.<eos> She's here to serve you.<eos> Give her an order,<eos> - and she will carry it out.
And would never betray them.<eos> That ring again.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> Where did you find it?<eos> I took it from a berserker who was sent to kill me.
I-I-I can't.<eos> Look, every safety deposit box requires two keys.<eos> The bank... has one and the box renter holds onto the other.<eos> Now, I'm betting that Bob doesn't have his key anymore.<eos> I think the man who killed him has it.
Zip me up?<eos> You nervous?<eos> It's date night. We're not going to the White House.<eos> Oh, come on.<eos> Date Night's a lot of pressure. I know I'm feeling it.
About two years ago.<eos> Took me almost a week to drive the demon from her.<eos> And?<eos> Was it like with Joshua?<eos> Did you see it come out?
I'm in full-on Vibe mode right now.<eos> I wasn't fast enough to protect Iris.<eos> I felt slower. I did it.<eos> I stole your speed.<eos> I gave it to Zoom. Give me back my daughter.
So is-- Is he a psychiatrist?<eos> Absolutely not.<eos> Well, here's your dog.<eos> Mmm-mmm, not mine.<eos> You could leave it on the desk, and I'll find it some fruit.
Absolutely not.<eos> Well, here's your dog.<eos> Mmm-mmm, not mine.<eos> You could leave it on the desk, and I'll find it some fruit.<eos> Maybe I'll take it with me.
You smell like a stripper died in a cabin.<eos> I'm not talking about my cologne.<eos> That's why I hang back and wait for him to get specific.<eos> My mustache.<eos> I've been growing it for weeks, and the two of you have been conspicuously silent.
I've been growing it for weeks, and the two of you have been conspicuously silent.<eos> It's very dashing.<eos> What mustache?<eos> Right, Jay.<eos> Like I'm supposed to believe you didn't see it.
You were talking about my mustache again?<eos> No, Manny.<eos> We love your mustache.<eos> Oh, hilarious.<eos> Tell me you like it now that I've shaved it off!
I tried it.<eos> She won't budge and now I've got to take my lube back from her.<eos> It cannot go out into the world with palm oil in it. It just can't.<eos> I know, and I know you're upset, but we made a deal.<eos> We have to break it.
-Not by me.<eos> Listen, toots, did you get my text?<eos> I need my samovar for the party.<eos> You mean my samovar?<eos> I'm the one that spotted it at the Rose Bowl in 1999.
You mean my samovar?<eos> I'm the one that spotted it at the Rose Bowl in 1999.<eos> -You snooze, you lose.<eos> -Well, I got it back.<eos> You stole it back for your Boxing Day dinner that never existed.
You got it.<eos> Enough small talk?<eos> Okay.<eos> You see that guy out there smoking a cigarette?<eos> The way this works is, you bring your stuff to him, he'll sample it.
That's it!<eos> Good boy.<eos> - It's wriggling.<eos> - Of course it's wriggling, it's a worm.<eos> It'll stop wriggling once you put it on the hook.
Rich man or beggar, it does not discriminate.<eos> Death doesn't care about fleeing your demons,<eos> or making amends for them.<eos> It doesn't care about any of that.<eos> It cares only that this is your time.
He's been generous to you.<eos> That's a pardon.<eos> He dishonoured me by making that dull soldier regent.<eos> The king's will is complex.<eos> Treville believes you will want to see it.
I know that, Monty.<eos> We can't risk Jasper getting in here, not when A.L.I.E. knows what I'm building.<eos> Raven, the plan failed.<eos> Clarke won't be radioing with the kill code.<eos> I can find it myself.
If no such evidence emerges then you and your comrades will face the lesser charges of rebellion and incitement to cause disaffection.<eos> These are not capital offences.<eos> Well, I'm grateful to you, Mr Wilson, and to your Mr Wiley.<eos> Would you like me to see that your mother receives your letter?<eos> I'm sure our friends will want to read it when I'm done.
I actually have to get going anyway.<eos> A Vic just turned up that I think could be connected to that fight club ring I've been trying to bust since, like, forever.<eos> Can you do me a favor and find our lease agreement?<eos> Lease agreement?<eos> Yeah, I think I packed it accidentally, and we need it before we move in to our new place. Yeah.
Find Cat?<eos> - What happened?<eos> - JT? You find that van yet?<eos> Uh, no.<eos> I lost it at 58th and Park.
- What happened?<eos> - JT? You find that van yet?<eos> Uh, no.<eos> I lost it at 58th and Park.<eos> You couldn't track it?
- You can't stop a tide, Chip.<eos> - Change is inevitable.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Even if I did give you the four million dollars, the hotel development is still going to happen.<eos> - Yeah, well, I stopped it once before.
And they see through... they see through...<eos> - Mud.<eos> - They see through the mud.<eos> I need that store, Jerry.<eos> I'm not sure I'd know what to do if I lost it, man.
Will you give me a salute, General?<eos> Active military aren't allowed to speak to the press.<eos> He delivered his resignation this morning.<eos> No shit.<eos> We're gonna break it online as soon as the president accepts it.
Uh, gonna leave all this to Vi and the girls if you're not interested.<eos> - Grandmother's jewelry?<eos> - Mmm-hmm. She'd turn over in her grave if I didn't at least offer it to you.<eos> - She had great taste. - Hmm.<eos> Where do you think I got it from?
And by the time she gives her speech tomorrow night, there won't be a dry eye in Atlanta or across the rest of the country.<eos> So, you get to keep your job, Cathy, in return for your delegates. That offer is still on the table.<eos> I have been loyal.<eos> I got you that table.<eos> Do you wanna keep it, or do you wanna give it to Conway?
- Yes, sir. - Cathy.<eos> Do we have a problem?<eos> No, sir.<eos> I'll coordinate with Doug.<eos> After a dog's bitten you, you either put it to sleep, or you put a muzzle on it.
So how do we make it stick?<eos> Well, there's not much I can do.<eos> We gave you access. I need more than I'm getting.<eos> You're supposed to tell me what people want.<eos> People didn't know they wanted jazz until they heard it for the first time.
- Can I have some?<eos> You're not old enough.<eos> But do you want some water or some juice?<eos> I think we've got some juice in the fridge.<eos> I'll get it.
- Would they have made that choice?<eos> - What choice? All they've known are your bombs.<eos> Poof, gone.<eos> We're effective because we make you feel the pain.<eos> We've felt it all our lives.
Such are the seats of power.<eos> I can offer you coffee, but don't ask for a cup.<eos> Your brother is gonna get the tar beat out of him. You know that, right?<eos> I don't like what Aguirre's doing to the Rayburn name.<eos> He wants everybody to think of Danny when they hear it, not John.
Extra!<eos> I'm gonna fuck Scott!<eos> [Scott] What the hell?<eos> [panting] Your power is out.<eos> Do you need someone to help you turn it back on?
You're here right now instead of being undercover.<eos> I cloud your judgment.<eos> And you keep me off my game, too.<eos> People were shooting at me with real guns today, and... and all I could think about was you.<eos> I want to do this job, and I want to do it well, and I...
What is that?<eos> Gift.<eos> Blessed wine from His Holiness, Pope Gregory.<eos> Where is the Khan?<eos> Why'd he send it here?
She is so cool.<eos> Sextina's music makes me feel strong, like I can do anything.<eos> It doesn't offend you?<eos> What about the part where she says,<eos> "I hope and pray to God my little fetus has a soul 'cause I want it to feel pain when I eject it from my hole"?
Can we slow the fuck down, please!<eos> Who walks around with their passport in a foreign country? - I do.<eos> - So do I. Everybody does.<eos> No, they don't.<eos> They leave it in a safe in their hotel or-or somewhere secure.
At this time, will ground staff please leave the aircraft as we are about to close the cabin doors?<eos> Also, please make sure your seat backs and tray tables are in their full upright and locked positions.<eos> There he is.<eos> It's not complicated, what we do.<eos> I get product from Jesús and sell it on.
Yeah, no, I was making a joke about them.<eos> No, it was good.<eos> It was a good joke.<eos> No, it wasn't.<eos> It was funny.
Hey, you know what, baby?<eos> Let's get out of here.<eos> I'm not really feeling this place.<eos> Really?<eos> I kind of liked it.
Nicky and Tara.<eos> Felicia!<eos> Yes, Mr. Drake?<eos> This mirror is filthy.<eos> But I just cleaned it.
Felicia!<eos> Yes, Mr. Drake?<eos> This mirror is filthy.<eos> But I just cleaned it.<eos> Clean it again.
What does he want?<eos> He's after that crystal you found.<eos> Our parents hid it for a reason, and if phears wants it this bad, then it must have been a very good reason.<eos> Like taking over the world.<eos> Max, we have to hide that crystal again, somewhere phears can never find it.

Max, we have to hide that crystal again, somewhere phears can never find it.<eos> I don't have it.<eos> What?<eos> Max, where is it?<eos> I gave it away.
I don't have it.<eos> What?<eos> Max, where is it?<eos> I gave it away.<eos> I gave it to cammie.
That gets the old blood flowing, doesn't it?<eos> Isn't it brave of them, trying to save you?<eos> Well, now it's your turn to save them.<eos> Give me the crystal.<eos> Free them first, then I'll give it to you.
So why don't you freeze me, like the way you did my parents? Then you could just take the crystal.<eos> Maybe I don't want to?<eos> Maybe you can't.<eos> You can't take the crystal from me.<eos> I have to give it to you, don't I?
Good.<eos> I'd really like to have my crystal back, Max.<eos> You would?<eos> It's so beautiful, Max.<eos> Please, give it to me?
You would?<eos> It's so beautiful, Max.<eos> Please, give it to me?<eos> Okay, whatever you want.<eos> That's right, Max, just give it to me.
It's so beautiful, Max.<eos> Please, give it to me?<eos> Okay, whatever you want.<eos> That's right, Max, just give it to me.<eos> Put it in my hand and every/thing's going to be okay.
We were fools to believe Valentine was dead.<eos> Previously on Shadowhunters...<eos> My sister wants you to be her defense attorney.<eos> For the right price.<eos> - Name it. - You.
I'm just-<eos> I got hooked up with some sketchy people, but I'm fine. Okay?<eos> I'll get to this tomorrow.<eos> Blood's not going to come out of that sweater.<eos> You should just throw it out. Okay, thanks...
Why?<eos> The fox knows and I knew... everything I needed to survive was me and it's not just to survive, but to be happy.<eos> I was... happy.<eos> The fox is in you now- both of you.<eos> Feed it.
You know, first, I just want to be clear.<eos> Richard might be about forgiveness, but I'm sure as shit not.<eos> Look, I'm sorry you and your mom had a shitty relationship, but not a day goes by where I don't feel terrible about what happened to her.<eos> I did not cause her death, okay?<eos> I only wish that I could've stopped it.
We found an unconscious security guard near the back fire exit.<eos> Must have been how he got out of here so quickly.<eos> Jack.<eos> I think he's using Kris' computer to record all this.<eos> Turn it around.
Password locked.<eos> Monty, we're in the unsub's apartment.<eos> Can you hack into his computer?<eos> Okay, I need you to look on the back of the router for me.<eos> I've got it.
When I think about the families who were touched by this week, when I think about the businesses and employees, that makes the whole thing worthwhile.<eos> What do you hope that this film will capture?<eos> My hope is that maybe somebody will watch this film and say, "Oh, wow.<eos> It was really beautiful to watch these people transform."<eos> Just watch it for that, and maybe that'll make them think about what's possible for themselves.
Pop it open.<eos> Now we turn on the lights.<eos> Pop the gemstone right in there.<eos> What gemstone?<eos> The gemstone that I gave you... pop it right in there.
Richard, come on, man.<eos> She's fucking with you.<eos> Amaru told me the truth about this world. And the next.<eos> There is a place for people like us, Seth.<eos> I've seen it.
Amaru told me the truth about this world. And the next.<eos> There is a place for people like us, Seth.<eos> I've seen it.<eos> Let me show you.<eos> I saw it, Seth.
Spread them wings.<eos> Simon you got a pen?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Sorry, kid.<eos> This is gonna be as cold as a warlock's ballsack, just like he was hanging his ballsack above you and dragging it right across the forearm.
That actually sounds right.<eos> I will cut pieces off of Daryl and put them on your doorstep... or, better yet, I will bring him to you and have you do it for me.<eos> Ahh! Welcome to a brand-new beginning, you sorry shits!<eos> I'm gonna leave you a truck.<eos> Keep it.

But I'm guessing you don't know much about the quill, do you?<eos> The sorcerer bequeathed the quill to all of you, but it is not a simple pen.<eos> It is a magical energy. It is a living, breathing entity.<eos> It's alive?<eos> Oh, yes. And when you broke it, Henry, you sent it right down here to the Underworld, its purpose unfulfilled.
It is a magical energy. It is a living, breathing entity.<eos> It's alive?<eos> Oh, yes. And when you broke it, Henry, you sent it right down here to the Underworld, its purpose unfulfilled.<eos> It epitomized unfinished business.<eos> And now you are going to find it down here with my help.
It is, but you're supposed to get the call, before the letter.<eos> Well, is he gonna change his mind?<eos> No, the call's just to discuss the decision.<eos> Well, I know what the decision is, I've got the letter here in front of us.<eos> D'you want us to read it to you?
I might have.<eos> - Aye? - Done this graft before? - You got any experience?<eos> - Oh, I've got 40 years of experience, mate.<eos> I can turn me hand to owt. Can I give you me CV?<eos> Way-ay, course, I'll have a look at it.
After the incident a cross-party delegation was sent to Donora on an urgent fact-finding mission.<eos> They recommended that clean air zones be set up all round London, as a precautionary measure.<eos> - I never saw the report.<eos> - With good reason.<eos> Our Prime Minister threw it away, claiming it wasn't a priority.
And who says I'm ever gonna be inside? Maybe you won't.<eos> But if you do, I'm here to tell you everything that's gonna happen on the outside.<eos> Why don't you get the hell out of here? Listen to me.<eos> Anita's going to come to you with a deal, and it's not gonna be through Harvey Specter.<eos> And if you're smart, you'll take it. I said get the hell out.
- I don't care what they smell.<eos> I've given up everything for this firm, and if anybody tries to take it from me, they'll have to pry it from my cold, dead hands.<eos> - And what's your goddamn plan? - Excuse me?<eos> Jessica, our reputation's taking a beating.<eos> We need to rehabilitate it.
That means it's either bad news or you want something.<eos> - I couldn't get the department.<eos> - Don't tell me. They said we're in no position to poach anybody.<eos> That's exactly what they said, right before they offered me a job.<eos> So you're here to tell me you took it.
- I couldn't get the department.<eos> - Don't tell me. They said we're in no position to poach anybody.<eos> That's exactly what they said, right before they offered me a job.<eos> So you're here to tell me you took it.<eos> I'm here to ask you if you want me to take it.
"We collectively come forward to swear "the following regarding Michael James Ross:<eos> "We never saw him.<eos> We never knew him.<eos> "We never heard of him.<eos> "And it makes us sick that he's taking the good name "of Harvard Law School and throwing it down the toilet.
I just got off the phone with Vanessa.<eos> David Green never showed.<eos> Whatever it is, Louis, I don't have the time.<eos> Well, you better find the time, because Anita Gibbs just offered me a deal.<eos> And I assume you told her to shove it up her ass. I did.
What are you doing here?<eos> I don't live at the store, silly.<eos> You don't?<eos> Well, did you see my new truck?<eos> - My mom got it for me. - Oh!
You made this for me?<eos> No, I didn't make it for you, but I guess you can have it now.<eos> But make sure you change out those, uh... trash bags in between your pukings, please.<eos> Why not just fucking puke in the bags and, you know, skip the basket?<eos> 'Cause I made it.
Of course she did.<eos> I'd have done the same thing.<eos> And if Sandstorm is half as good as you say they are, they're gonna scan her.<eos> That tracker's nearly invisible.<eos> And if they found it, I bet they'd nearly keep her alive.
Jerking off MCC?<eos> Who cares?<eos> I know it's been a while since you took the uniform off, but surely you remember what it's like to be on the ground in here, or maybe your fancy suit affects your memory?<eos> Enough is enough.<eos> You hired me to do a job, and now you're gonna let me do it.
I've known for weeks.<eos> You're not pulling any wool over these eyes.<eos> No, sir.<eos> I have no fucking idea what you're talking about.<eos> I'm talking about you pulling your dick out of your pants and sticking it in my sister!
And because they're poor.<eos> Now, I think you're getting a bit paranoid, Jonesy.<eos> I'm telling it like it is.<eos> And so what if they do steal?<eos> MCC has given us all this stuff, it's not as if we deserve it any more than anybody else out there.
- Yeah.<eos> We need to get to a power source.<eos> The cattle prod.<eos> We know where that is.<eos> Now, we just got to get it.
I got an idea.<eos> This plane disappeared from traffic control three months ago.<eos> Everyone assumed it went down in the ocean.<eos> When they couldn't find any debris, they figured the transponder had been turned off.<eos> So if we turn it back on...
You are religious.<eos> That's good. You'll need it here.<eos> How the hell did we lose her?<eos> The tracker's still on the bus.<eos> He must have taken it off her.
And worth killing for.<eos> Question is, is what was inside that truck?<eos> Second set of tire marks.<eos> SUVs, judging from their size.<eos> They converged on the truck, ran it off the road.
Patterson conducted all of her research under her secure login.<eos> Well, can't we hack in?<eos> We could if Patterson were here.<eos> Her car just arrived at an impound in midtown.<eos> - Where'd they tow it from?
This last part is going to be...<eos> Wait, wait! Aah! Just wait!<eos> - Break my thumb. - What?<eos> - You need to get to Alex before the FBI takes her out.<eos> Break it now so we can get out of here.
Who? Get who?<eos> Ryan.<eos> It started a few months after I left the Academy.<eos> I was working for this private security firm in New York when I got a call... unknown number.<eos> I answered, and this voice tells me to rent a van and park it on Arthur Avenue in the Bronx.
My thought is, at the very least, we'll find the voice-modification software he's been using this whole time.<eos> Look... Check my pants pocket.<eos> There's a flash drive I stole from work. It has a brute-force algorithm in it.<eos> It'll decrypt Ryan's computer passwords.<eos> I was on my way to get it to you, and I collapsed.
A .45 will do that to you.<eos> You got shot?<eos> Sounds like Booth and O'Connor may have left out some key details of the sting.<eos> Blown sting.<eos> Yeah, and he's the one that blew it.
I thought that my parents died on 9/11.<eos> That's the whole reason that I came here in the first place.<eos> But seeing them alive... All that anger, all that desire, all that drive, it's gone.<eos> And then hearing what happened to Brandon today? That was a reminder of just how tough this job really is.<eos> You need a burning desire to want to do it.
Wonderful!<eos> ♪ Yeah!<eos> How many tiny pillows does one girl need?<eos> Dare I ask?<eos> My uncle Curtis left it for me to look after.
Are you sure you're OK?<eos> At least I'm not the only one who wasn't invited to the party.<eos> Makes me feel better.<eos> Très sparkly.<eos> Thank God he finally grew a pair and got it back from his ex.
Yeah, that's neat.<eos> Wait, you said Bobo has two skeletons, and the skull is part of one of them.<eos> Oh, she's trying to resurrect them!<eos> Where did you hide it?<eos> No, I'm not supposed to give it to anybody,
OK?<eos> Haven't you read a romance novel lately?<eos> Heroes always win.<eos> Oh, you want to be a hero?<eos> Very well, give me the skull or I will take it from your lifeless hands.
Haven't you read a romance novel lately?<eos> Heroes always win.<eos> Oh, you want to be a hero?<eos> Very well, give me the skull or I will take it from your lifeless hands.<eos> Come and get it.
So they moved their new capital... ..right next to the Valley of the Kings.<eos> - You're back.<eos> I'm so sorry. I wasn't meaning to pry.<eos> I found the catalogue for 55 and I thought it might be useful for you<eos> - so I brought it over.
That was good of you.<eos> It's the least I can do, seeing as he's coming to work for us.<eos> You didn't know?<eos> The Met's offered him a job.<eos> Well, he can't take it.
Has anyone got anything at all?<eos> - I belong here.<eos> - And she's here.<eos> You could go through this sand with a fine-mesh sieve, and not turn up anything new.<eos> Well, I lost a cufflink out there in '07, if one of your chaps turns it up.
No wires.<eos> Fakes.<eos> Just for show.<eos> Hey. Sorry, I never caught your name.<eos> My boss never uses it.
Sounds like you blame someone.<eos> I don't know.<eos> Maybe Jenny?<eos> I told her to quit.<eos> She always complained about her job, but she wouldn't give it up.
But the Chos are a fierce and stubborn family.<eos> My pa rents, they lobbied, researched, and mortgaged our home to keep going.<eos> In 1994, I entered an experimental gene therapy trial.<eos> By the time I graduated from bioengineering,<eos> I was in full remission, and as an engineer, when I see a flaw, I wanna fix it.
- Oh. Okay, I'm just like, very tight back here, so... just allow me to... just, like, right in there.<eos> Um, we have a schedule here, so...<eos> Let me just...<eos> Okay, good news, I have an appointment available right now, if you're interested.<eos> - Great, I'll take it. - Okay.
Yeah, I get that feeling.<eos> Doorbellings.<eos> I have to go.<eos> Okay. You, urn, rub that belly for me.<eos> - I will rub it.
I'll let Cosima explain.<eos> Sarah Manning.<eos> Welcome to Brightborn.<eos> You're Evie Cho, right?<eos> I'm gonna pass on the tour, Cosima doesn't recommend it.
Maybe.<eos> Then make me a bullet.<eos> You're not talking me out of this, Eugene!<eos> You owe me, and you owe him.<eos> And if there's a price, I'll pay it.
What about Sasha?<eos> Look at me, Rosita.<eos> It shouldn't have been you.<eos> It shouldn't have been anyone.<eos> We'll win, but we need to wait for the right moment or create it... together.
Yeah. We're all Negan.<eos> Whatever you're trying to do, you can't.<eos> But you still have some choices.<eos> Go home.<eos> Burn this car, roll it down into a lake, make it disappear.
How do you like them apples?<eos> All About Eve, huh?<eos> Yeah, yeah.<eos> 'Cause Adam... Adam told her not to eat that apple.<eos> And she ate it, she became wise.
To just back down.<eos> To not be so stubborn or worried about appearing weak.<eos> You're right, I did mess up.<eos> I allowed you to think you have some sort of special privilege around here... which you don't.<eos> In fact, the next time you care to express something to me... you can write me a letter... and then shove it up your tight, little heinie.
- Seriously.<eos> - What?<eos> - You're ruining the film.<eos> I thought you didn't even like it.<eos> Well, I love it now.
Dr. Eckland found me the blueprints.<eos> See they put the Time Machine and the Core at opposite ends so if one explodes, it won't destroy the other.<eos> And check this out.<eos> When the army build this place in the 1950s, they put this part over the underground river.<eos> We use it to cool the Core conduits.
He chose to appear as Aaron, and no, I'm not crazy.<eos> It happened.<eos> Does this sound even remotely possible?<eos> Yeah, there's some pretty trippy shit going on with that tea.<eos> They would, uh, drink it, and they would see him in their heads.
It happened.<eos> Does this sound even remotely possible?<eos> Yeah, there's some pretty trippy shit going on with that tea.<eos> They would, uh, drink it, and they would see him in their heads.<eos> I never tried it.
This was no accident.<eos> The fail safes were disabled.<eos> This was deliberate.<eos> The lens array is totally fried.<eos> Someone put it in backwards.
The fail safes were disabled.<eos> This was deliberate.<eos> The lens array is totally fried.<eos> Someone put it in backwards.<eos> Instead of focusing the temporal stream, it dispersed it.
Because that's the only way a group of people trying to live here can safely go about their daily lives.<eos> That is why.<eos> You got a pencil?<eos> I do.<eos> Great. Take it and jam it up your ass.
You've seen that before, so what?<eos> It's from the kitchen at the hospital.<eos> I recognize the handle.<eos> Yeah, there's a reason for that.<eos> I don't think I need to explain it.
I'm not really into blogs.<eos> You'll be into this one. Jean-Luc still yearns for Carmen, the love of his life.<eos> It's so tragic.<eos> It makes me tear up just thinking about it.<eos> What is wrong with you? You have to read it.
- What can I do, sir? - I'll get the lawyer back before five.<eos> You draft an apology, and personally deliver it.<eos> Bring your protégée.<eos> Protégée?<eos> You hire somebody for their ass, you're responsible - for covering it.
It's what the rest of us do.<eos> Come on, stay.<eos> I'm going.<eos> Playing a widow today. I need a wedding ring.<eos> Have it.
"Dear Diane. We are sorry to say that your piece,<eos> 'An Open Letter to Open Letters', wasn't right for us, despite its evident merit." Do you know what this means?<eos> Caring leads to disappointment?<eos> Trying is stupid and so is having dreams?<eos> Someone gave my piece a read and decided against it.
Please! Don't kill me!<eos> Get up!<eos> Okay, I need to get in here.<eos> Do you know the code?<eos> Well, enter it.
Or possibly other Dianes we don't even know about yet.<eos> The point is, I'm all of the Dianes.<eos> I know exactly what you're talking about.<eos> I love that you do crazy things that make no sense, like fill our house up with spaghetti strainers.<eos> I had a very good reason for that, but I do not remember what it was.
One star!<eos> You all eat a flat butt!<eos> Did you not know there was a critic here?<eos> You own this place.<eos> I never see you do anything to help run it.
I no longer have to lug your talentless, self-centered, self-sabotaging, dead-weight carcass of faded talent around my neck.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - Thank you for firing me.<eos> I'm gonna go pour myself a little celebratory potato juice, because this is the best goddamn thing that's ever happened to me.<eos> Ha, ha! I'll get it.
We have to go now, okay?<eos> No.<eos> This place, this is what matters.<eos> This is my home, like I've never known one.<eos> But you don't have to die for it.
Well, I guess I'm just tired of BoJack walking all over everybody and still getting everything he wants. I think the important thing to remember here is that BoJack is a damaged individual, struggling against a sea of demons, many self-created, but still all too real.<eos> Getting this nomination from the two friends he loves the most-- you and also me-- would really mean a lot to him.<eos> [sighs] Okay.<eos> But did you really think he was that good in the movie?<eos> Oh, I haven't seen it.
Where you running to?<eos> Remember.<eos> The tumbler is stuck.<eos> These fingers work just fine.<eos> You're the one who said you could crack it.
Planet Hoth.<eos> I can see wind just ripping, snow being taken off at every peak.<eos> We got wind!<eos> Holy shit!<eos> The wind's blowing the snow somewhere, we just got to find it.
Finding someplace safe to disappear.<eos> I spent months moving my Emperor from one hiding place to the next, and you still found us.<eos> You're fooling yourself if you think those Mongol soldiers are the last ones to come your way.<eos> Our protection is your best bet.<eos> And if you want it, you have to earn your keep.
There was this girl.<eos> I used to make deliveries to her family along the canals.<eos> Once a week, same time.<eos> She would come to the balcony... smile down at me.<eos> She'd lower her basket, and I'd fill it.
I used to make deliveries to her family along the canals.<eos> Once a week, same time.<eos> She would come to the balcony... smile down at me.<eos> She'd lower her basket, and I'd fill it.<eos> She'd pull it up.
And it's only a matter of time till you're you all over again.<eos> So, here's a prediction.<eos> I'm gonna ask you to do this job.<eos> You're gonna say no.<eos> But I'm not doin' it without you.
Whatever, if it'll help.<eos> Thanks.<eos> That'd be great.<eos> Mommy!<eos> Now, look, I ain't one to back down from losing a fight or making a bad decision, but there's asking for trouble, and there's bloody beggin' for it.
Me and Eugene... we've had our challenges, but at the end of the day,<eos> I-I-I don't know what I'd do without him.<eos> You'd figure it out.<eos> Is there, uh, mustard?<eos> Ah. I see it.
Just please try to remember that I would never do anything to hurt you.<eos> Then how do you keep managing to do it?<eos> KARA:<eos> Lucy.<eos> So, uh, Ms. Grant's doing this whole green tea cleanse this week, and she rejected her latte. So, I thought you might like it.
You set a trap for Non.<eos> The fire, that was an accident.<eos> I never meant to endanger any firefighters, any civilians.<eos> Not even Supergirl.<eos> So, you figured if you booby-trapped a satellite, then your Kryptonite would kill Non just in case he went to go check on it?
Some starving bog lady ancestor stole from a banshee.<eos> So, that's it?<eos> I'm just, I'm cursed and it's never gonna go away?<eos> The curse is triggered when someone wrongs you.<eos> If you want it to stop, you're going to have to kill whoever is the object of your anger.
You could be the Lord of the Universe.<eos> Don't you realize what you have?<eos> You've created a force that could take over the galaxy.<eos> A vast army that exists only to do your bidding.<eos> You want to take one planet and turn it into your fiefdom, when you have an entire universe crying out to be ruled by you.
If you have information that can help us...<eos> We don't have time for this.<eos> Jaha's backpack.<eos> What about it?<eos> All right, it runs the A.I. And if we destroy it, I'm pretty sure we can destroy her.
Jaha's backpack.<eos> What about it?<eos> All right, it runs the A.I. And if we destroy it, I'm pretty sure we can destroy her.<eos> I know where it is.<eos> I saw them move it into the temple before I was captured.
Is there a kill code in that book you didn't tell me about?<eos> Then we stick with the plan.<eos> Clarke gives the Flame to Luna.<eos> The A.I. in the Flame gives Luna the kill code.<eos> We enter it here, taking our one shot, and Bob's your uncle.
Emori.<eos> You are making a mistake.<eos> The minds of everyone who has entered the City of Light are on that server.<eos> 30 seconds.<eos> If you destroy it, our minds will be gone forever.
This place was safe until we got here.<eos> Machine room.<eos> Let's go.<eos> No.<eos> No. Take it and the child will be fine.
The hardest part is at the end.<eos> You must relax, take deep breaths, and make it easy for the baby.<eos> All right.<eos> When you feel the pain again, you must push.<eos> I feel it! I feel it, I feel it.
He'll know who I am.<eos> All clear. No pathogens.<eos> Dr. Cassandra Railly of the CDC.<eos> Where's your identification?<eos> I lost it.
Now she has a chance to know her.<eos> It's not perfect, but it's something.<eos> Cassie.<eos> You and I both know that we're gonna lose so much before this is over.<eos> I'd rather have that moment and lose it than die never having had it at all.
Didn't know we chipped it.<eos> So anytime he's near, we get stuff like this... listen.<eos> We cannot proceed without Oliver Peters.<eos> The virus was destroyed.<eos> He's the only one who can recreate it.
Tall Man's looking for you.<eos> No, no.<eos> - Yes. - He got everything he needed from me.<eos> I... I gave him the virus.<eos> We destroyed it.
Afraid I couldn't collect anyone to declassify it, but it is what you came for.<eos> The only record with even a mention of a place called "Titan."<eos> Thank you.<eos> You know, whatever battle you're about to walk into together... it won't be your hatred for each other that will divide you.<eos> It will be the lies you tell to camouflage it.
You're their Andy, okay?<eos> Their plaything, someone that you keep "on simmer."<eos> So what? You're suggesting what, like karmic justice here, or something?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I mean, if the asshat fits, then wear it.
Your power ring, where is it?<eos> That green ring?<eos> The Captain took it when he fished me out of the sea as payment to be on his crew.<eos> It's locked up in his chest.<eos> We have to get it.
I am ready to shrink.<eos> Well, we have a surprise for you, Brainiac.<eos> The Shrink-ray 2.0.<eos> - You will notice, it is even superior to...<eos> - My calculations indicate that I will, no doubt, find it is a booby trap designed to destroy me when I activate it.
Well, it's just indiscreet.<eos> - And I haven't got the job yet.<eos> - What about that tree?<eos> It's blocking all the light.<eos> Well, I daresay one could ask to have it trimmed back.
I was thinking especially of the Goldfish pond here at Chartwell.<eos> The pond? Why the pond?<eos> It's just a pond.<eos> It's very much more than that.<eos> As borne out by the fact that you've returned to it again and again.
Shit.<eos> We can't go down there.<eos> There's too many of them.<eos> We need that card.<eos> I don't think we can get to the computer without it.
Uh, let me see if I can find Nutter butter, get a pic with him, too, for next year's Christmas card.<eos> Ma, we're not taking a picture with the cat.<eos> We gotta get going.<eos> But thank you again for the sweater.<eos> I love it.
lay, dios mío!<eos> Claire, is this true?<eos> No! Okay, I can't do this.<eos> I'm... I'm just gonna go ahead and walk away now.<eos> But if a bolt of lightning should strike this house, you can send it my way.
Don't be so rough! Damn!<eos> You all right, sweetie?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Did you get your check okay?<eos> I got it right here.
And recently I had a pretty good chance to come back.<eos> I got some decent work. Got a girl that would half-assed tolerate me.<eos> But I fucked it up.<eos> You know, aren't you all tired of saying the same shit over and over at these meetings?<eos> I know I'm tired of hearing it.
I also know that you spend far too much time in slumber.<eos> If you want my advice, you should take advantage of this disturbance, forgo sleep, and find an activity which tests your abilities.<eos> Escaping elaborate restraints, for example.<eos> If that doesn't bother you, then why did you choose an activity that included noise-canceling headphones?<eos> I didn't say I was impervious to the noise, I merely said I was using it as an impetus.
I thought we could spend some time and talk about them.<eos> Well... it would be an honor.<eos> Cassie?<eos> ♪ All we do is chase the day... ♪ Mind if I call you Cassie?<eos> I'd call you by your real name, but you're refusing to give it.
And the last one's a clinic.<eos> What kind of clinic?<eos> Beauty treatment.<eos> And he's got his own commercial.<eos> Play it.
And I know... one thing.<eos> One thing for sure is that...<eos> I don't know any prayers or anything like that, uh, but, uh...<eos> David put his hand in the bag,<eos> and took out a stone and slung it, and... and struck the Philistine on the head.
Nothing. Really?<eos> How do you feel about that, Mr. Letts?<eos> Listen, I'd imagine you enjoy being general counsel at Borns Tech. - Mm-hm.<eos> - You make, what, with stock options, $2 million?<eos> You might consider doing your job should you be inclined to keep it.
I'm sorry...<eos> Advance money?<eos> Grace just sold a novel.<eos> Impressive.<eos> She had a dream and she made it happen.
I've gotta follow up on this GPS thing, they finally turned it on.<eos> Good luck.<eos> He really fills out those fitted shirts, huh? -Mmm-hmm.<eos> What's the GPS thing?<eos> One of the missing rich guys had a dog. And the dog has a GPS tracker and they turned it on.
Balls.<eos> So, the prognosis for me is, uh...<eos> The McDermotts, together in life, until its tragic end on State Route 520, shall be united in eternity in their custom-order double casket.<eos> I'm betting they were the kind of couple that finished each others' sentences.<eos> Ordered one dessert and shared it with a single fork.
In Chinatown.<eos> Got it.<eos> Great story. No.<eos> That's not how he got his name.<eos> He got it from the way he took the corner.
I have a body, all right?<eos> Can't you just think of me as a sexual object?<eos> Fine.<eos> Whatever.<eos> You want to back up that booty, back it up.
I swear.<eos> Why should we believe you?<eos> I know where the tire iron is.<eos> That'll have her fingerprints all over it, won't it?<eos> She threw it out of the car window while we were driving down the highway.
No, no.<eos> I'm good.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Orange juice, 16 ounces.<eos> Where to put it?
I work at a pet groomer's.<eos> This dog was there a couple weeks ago.<eos> But the guy who brought him in came to get him before I was done.<eos> He was all sweaty, freaking out.<eos> He said he stole the dog from a cop who abused it, and the cop was coming back to get him.
Ew, we are missing him!<eos> So I was thinking, maybe we can come up with a name for the asteroid by combining our names.<eos> That's a great idea.<eos> I've got it.<eos> We'll call it...
Okay. Guess we're gonna talk about you now.<eos> Well, we are, because Dr. Gallo made me realize that I'm a worthwhile person and that my feelings matter.<eos> I learned that for free from a cat poster, but good for you.<eos> Okay, back to me.<eos> I discovered an asteroid, and now I get to name it.
Okay, back to me.<eos> I discovered an asteroid, and now I get to name it.<eos> Wait, what happened to us?<eos> Now, this isn't about us, this is about what's best for the asteroid.<eos> What are you thinking of naming it?
We haven't settled on anything yet.<eos> All right, way to go, Cat Poster.<eos> You hang in there.<eos> You know what'd be nice?<eos> Name it after your girlfriends.
Um...<eos> Yes. Spider web tattoo and all.<eos> Andrew Meeks. 39. He was put on parole last year after serving 15 years for attempted murder.<eos> Sulzbach got him a job as a janitor at a downtown office building.<eos> Must have gotten Ed to tell war stories about being in the FBI, saw the respect he got, and wanted it for himself.
Just like your boss said, you don't have enough for a profile yet.<eos> Why are we back here?<eos> You've been here before, when you were 15 years old.<eos> If I visited this place when I was 15, I would remember that.<eos> Because you didn't visit it, you built it.
That's not true.<eos> You survived.<eos> You created this space, the space in your head the monster couldn't get to.<eos> But that place never went away.<eos> It was still here for you when you needed it.
The place where The Beast is.<eos> Ergo, fuck that.<eos> Hey, here's a crazy idea.<eos> Plover wants the button back?<eos> Why don't we just give it to him?
Previously on "The Magicians"...<eos> What does that mean?<eos> Jesus, we could not have screwed up that spell worse, and we can't take it back.
Can you imagine, Quentin, how many times we've had this exact conversation?<eos> You've managed to slip truth serum to me 27 times, 27 ways, and I'm quite sick of it.<eos> So, what, this is just some giant, blood-soaked "Groundhog Day"?<eos> You always bring up that fucking movie.<eos> I still haven't seen it.
You know, "Did it exist?<eos> Did it exist at one time?<eos> Could we still get it?"<eos> We were unsuccessful in that regard.<eos> What was the state of the case when it was handed to you?
It's a tragedy.<eos> His wife Gina Larson accepted it, and she had somehow made peace with it, when Mr. McBride convinced her that there was money to be had.<eos> And Mr. McBride asks you to believe in this fantasy because he cannot substantiate his version of reality with facts.<eos> I man, consider what they're asking you to swallow-- that we blew up Ryan Larson and while we were at it we ran over his sister, assaulted her attorney, got his witnesses convicted of drug trafficking,<eos> and killed a snitch and hid it in the trunk of Mr. McBride's car.
Yes.<eos> Penny, did you know about this?<eos> All right, let's go.<eos> When did you get an engagement ring?<eos> My mother gave it to me, and I had been thinking about giving it to you, but then we broke up.
Captain, Watson and I are just ironing out a few kinks, but I think the plan for the heist is going to be ready shortly.<eos> Yeah, well you can stop ironing.<eos> We won't be needing it anymore.<eos> Why not?<eos> Because we no longer have an inside man to carry it out.
And shot him twice in a building occupied by 15 heavily armed bikers?<eos> I have to believe there were easier times and places to do the man in.<eos> Has the rug turned up?<eos> It has not.<eos> The bikers in lockup swear that they got rid of it a week ago when one of their hard-partying crew named "Chainsaw," soiled it in a most unpleasant way.
I have to go prep a deposition, but you can keep all of this.<eos> I'll let you know if I find anything else.<eos> Okay, thanks.<eos> She has a nice butt, okay.<eos> You don't have to stare at it.
I didn't move you.<eos> Wh-- are you saying someone else did?<eos> After you turned in last night, Marcus informed me that the missing rug had been found.<eos> The one from the video?<eos> The police traced it from the gang's Dumpster to a landfill.
Why didn't you just turn Bardot over to I.A.?<eos> I couldn't!<eos> Not after what he found!<eos> Your office computer.<eos> He found something when he hacked into it.
By the way, the girls are going out tomorrow night.<eos> - It's nothing wild.<eos> - Bring the cane in case you get drunk.<eos> - You're mean.<eos> - Take it.
They told me how much you loved Allison.<eos> What do you want from me?<eos> Well, your home computer would be a good start.<eos> We already have phone records that show you called Allison a great deal, especially considering she was married.<eos> All right, you want my computer, take it.
Where is he?<eos> Stay here.<eos> Declan fuckin' Harp in the flesh.<eos> You'd better tell me why the fuck you're walking around my camp like you own the fuckin' place.<eos> Oh, I found this piece of shit and I thought you might want it back.
So, you're taking it out on your laptop?<eos> No, not the laptop.<eos> The...<eos> That cursor.<eos> Just look at it there, taunting me, just blinking on, off, on, off, like it's so easy writing a best-selling novel.
No jokes.<eos> Are we friends?<eos> I know why you wanted to do this in a letter.<eos> So you could desiccate in peace, imagining whatever reaction you wanted.<eos> Me reading it and thinking, "huh.
Okay.<eos> Thanks.<eos> I think you can go in with her, Alf.<eos> Mia's article was put up on her blog.<eos> She must have put it up just before she was run over.
Who her source is.<eos> - Shall we go?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> She put the article up anyway, so what the hell was that for?<eos> She must have put it up before.
There's a folder.<eos> Was it 1234?<eos> Doesn't work.<eos> What else could it be?<eos> - Can't you just hack it?
Was it 1234?<eos> Doesn't work.<eos> What else could it be?<eos> - Can't you just hack it?<eos> - I can decrypt it, maybe.
- This is magical.<eos> - Okay, it's Saturday night.<eos> It's the end of Shabbat.<eos> We're about to leave the world of the holy and enter the rest of our week.<eos> Before we extinguish the candle, while there's still a few glimmers of holiness left in our day, I'd like to invite anybody that has a blessing to come up and share it with us.
I know that you like her.<eos> It seems to me that you're letting your feelings get in the way of our project.<eos> There, Sweetie.<eos> Here's your passport.<eos> Can you put it in your pocket?
- He must know we were here.<eos> - Open that safe now.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> What? Open it now, man.<eos> - We can't open it.
- Now!<eos> As in 'right now'.<eos> - Where?<eos> His owner is dead, man.<eos> So go out and kill it.
The public records are in limbo.<eos> People down in county don't even want to touch the place.<eos> I'm siphoning electricity from the grid.<eos> As far as anyone's concerned, it don't exist.<eos> Now, on the market, this joint would run you about 5 grand a month, but since it's you, I'll give it to your guy for half.
Every hacker has this.<eos> What are they doing?<eos> Uh, it's Forensics.<eos> We found his desktop unlocked.<eos> Uh, once we're done analyzing it, we'll send a full report.
I've been looking for a good adversary.<eos> Want to play?<eos> What do you think?<eos> Maybe it's not about avoiding the crash.<eos> But it's about setting a breakpoint to find the flaw in the code, fix it, and carry on until we hit the next flaw... the quest to keep going, to always fight for footing.
Load the malware into a femtocell delivery system, my personal cell tower that'll intercept all mobile data.<eos> Similar to my first time, when I found myself staring at late book fees, employee names, member addresses.<eos> Everything was revealed.<eos> The secret of the perfect hack?<eos> Make it infallible.
If you say you need him, you must need him.<eos> I'll have RT stop by.<eos> Son, y'all know y'all can't jump.<eos> I tracked the last package to the Midtown post office it was mailed from.<eos> However, there's no evidence on the security footage of anyone mailing it from inside the station.
Um... okay.<eos> This is a Rubber Ducky.<eos> All else fails, you find an FBI laptop anywhere on the floor.<eos> They're usually Panasonic Toughbooks.<eos> Plug this guy in, wait 15 seconds, then yank it, okay?
Some of us need to be controlled.<eos> Once in a while, the best course of action is to just ride shotgun.<eos> Stare at the road ahead, and hope it leads somewhere you want to go.<eos> There's a USB flash drive in that bag.<eos> When you get to your cubicle, power off your machine, plug the flash drive in, and power it back on.
- No--<eos> - What?<eos> - Crudely made.<eos> - Ember, no, it's okay--<eos> - I shall remove it.
She's a good doctor. She's real smart.<eos> You trust her?<eos> Yeah.<eos> She thinks I could try menopause, um, medically-induced.<eos> My cancer eats estrogen, so... she thinks we can starve it out.
What're we doing?<eos> Going to see a friend.<eos> But I have a history test.<eos> That's okay, darling.<eos> You can take it tomorrow.
A million dollars.<eos> You earned it.<eos> Why the fuck would you take Bunchy with you?<eos> You want your cut or not?<eos> Give it to Bunch.
All right. Stay with the art.<eos> I'll call you if you need to move.<eos> He's good.<eos> The Kremlin Bleeds.<eos> Have you seen it?
Enjoy the shrimp cocktail.<eos> This is good news, don't you think?<eos> But you're not happy about it.<eos> I'm not sure.<eos> When did you get it?
Enjoying my freedom.<eos> You're gonna have to do better than that.<eos> Can I have your shoe?<eos> Your shoe.<eos> I need to photograph it.
It's a handle that releases the door.<eos> It should be on a track above the car.<eos> - It's for emergencies.<eos> - I don't see one.<eos> I don't see it.
Let me guess.<eos> She, uh, gave you a spell.<eos> Yes.<eos> A return-to-love spell.<eos> All I had to do was chant it and... Seal it with a kiss.
I'm so sorry.<eos> You know what, Dex, I like that song.<eos> Yeah.<eos> What's the title?<eos> I call it "A Cry for Help."
No, no!<eos> It's a stray, and we are not keeping him.<eos> Be quiet.<eos> Your dad cannot know he's here.<eos> If he sees him, he'll get all attached, and there's no getting rid of it.
Where did you get the Stone Witch's trinket?<eos> Normally I just carve up women, but, Doctor, in your case I'm gonna make an exception.<eos> Looks like it's just me and you, Jackie Boy.<eos> - Go!<eos> Go get it.
Yeah. To remind myself it was actually real.<eos> You know, that you were actually gone.<eos> I was 6, right?<eos> I saw the little white coffin, but I knew that you weren't actually in there.<eos> They'd filled it with sandbags.
let me explain. - Explain what?<eos> How you were paid by Royal Governor Tryon and Mayor Mathews to spy on our camp?<eos> - No.<eos> - No? Well, perhaps the contents of that letter can clear things up, eh?<eos> Why not read it to me?
Look, we're gonna go check out that car.<eos> Make sure you get something to eat.<eos> Yep.<eos> Hey, fellas.<eos> Scavengers got here before we did, stripped it pretty clean.
Lies.<eos> Lies.<eos> I said her name.<eos> I forgot.<eos> It's all right. Garcia, were you able to trace it?
- Who are the Rangers?<eos> Listen, kid, I do not short baseball, okay?<eos> Yes, and angels are real.<eos> One of them is my ride out of this vessel.<eos> The shield you placed to block magic, You must have blocked it.
Yeah, it's no big deal.<eos> We're all done here.<eos> Yeah, it's just, I didn't hear the alarm, so...<eos> Oh, I did.<eos> I came in there and turned it off for you.
Got a little something for ya.<eos> And now, ladies and gentlemen, put your hands together for Gunnar Lawless!<eos> Hey, get up.<eos> Show some respect.<eos> Who's getting it?
Hey, get up.<eos> Show some respect.<eos> Who's getting it?<eos> Who's getting it, huh?<eos> Oh, oh, remember this? This is where he takes a glove off and gives it to some kid before the match?
Why do you think Oswald wanted to kill JFK?<eos> He loved Castro or he was working for the Russians?<eos> No one will ever know, I don't think.<eos> How'd you know about the letter?<eos> - Did you burn it?
So Sheldon, there's something I've be4enn wanting to talk about but I know it's kind of a touchy subject.<eos> Way to narrow it down to everything.<eos> What is it?<eos> Well, your birthday's coming up.<eos> And you've never let us celebrate it.
Okay, I got it.<eos> Here it is. Look at the, uh, date on the back.<eos> - Oh! And Lorelai... - Huh?<eos> The virus protection software I told you about.<eos> Want me to pop it on your computer?
I wasn't expecting to see her and I was jacked up on coffee and I just lunged at her, which she interpreted as a stranger lunging at her.<eos> -So sensitive.<eos> -I felt so stupid.<eos> She was freaking out. She gave me her wallet.<eos> - Did you keep it?
- Don't encourage her.<eos> -What's all this? -What?<eos> Dictionary, thesaurus, Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy...<eos> Aw, you got a letter from April.<eos> I was two hours into deciphering it when I got your call.
Follow me everywhere except the loo.<eos> --Actually, the loo's fine, too.<eos> -Francis, who's that burger for?<eos> -Um, Ms. Kipney.<eos> Trust me, she won't enjoy it.
Well, to Noam is to love him.<eos> Uh, is this thing on?<eos> -Ooh. -Why're you getting up?<eos> I'm getting extra cheese.<eos> -I'll get it.
You shorted him. -I don't care!<eos> -And people are missing the poem!<eos> Just a heads-up! Hey.<eos> What are you guys up to? We're doing "I drink your milkshake!<eos> I drink it up!"
I can do that style from memory. Your new orders.<eos> Details of your duties as commander of the garrison.<eos> Commander?<eos> New York may assign a new man, but since you have already held the post when I was a prisoner,<eos> I would imagine they'll let you keep it. It's not exactly a coveted position.
Listen, it was Tom.<eos> He was supposed to get himself and Lila on the bus, and I...<eos> I don't know, I guess he just got mixed up about the schedule.<eos> And now he thinks it's all his fault. Oh, shit.<eos> I mean, he had the pick-up schedule printed out, but, I don't know, I guess he just read it wrong.
Sir!<eos> - Arnold's a traitor, sir. - What?<eos> Arnold, he's a traitor.<eos> It's right here in the letter.<eos> Anna got it straight from André's desk.
- 11.<eos> - Excellent.<eos> Hey, you finish your english paper yet?<eos> - Uh, in theory.<eos> - Finish it.
What do you want me to do, general?<eos> Declare war?<eos> Why not?<eos> 40 minutes ago, they showed me the nuclear football.<eos> I guess I've had it long enough to try it out.
And that is?<eos> you don't take credit for something until you're done, right?<eos> So, what if they're just getting started?<eos> I don't remember this suit.<eos> I had to borrow it.
No, I just told you we'd go to the Christmas tree thing.<eos> Oh, right.<eos> Did you know that Norman had this letter?<eos> It's... it's meant for Emma.<eos> It's from her mom, and, uh, I found it here the other day.
Here where?<eos> In here.<eos> In... in Norman's room.<eos> That's a weird place for it to be.<eos> Well... Let me see it.
Fishing for information on Emma.<eos> I didn't want to get in the middle of it.<eos> You know what? Fine.<eos> But why did Norman have this letter?<eos> Oh, she tried to give it to me too.
I didn't want to get in the middle of it.<eos> You know what? Fine.<eos> But why did Norman have this letter?<eos> Oh, she tried to give it to me too.<eos> I wouldn't take it. I-I guess she gave it to Norman.
- Good.<eos> Well, you just needed a new control panel.<eos> That was it.<eos> - Oh, great. Thank you.<eos> Oh, uh, by the way, if you ever want to get rid of that old furnace, uh, just call us and we'll pick it up.
No way! This is Earp land,<eos> - our land!<eos> - We can't hold off revenants from it.<eos> Not until we find the talisman...<eos> I know because I'm the one who buried it.
There it is.<eos> Your instincts are correct.<eos> And yes, she has been giving some of my... weaker brethren some ideas of escape.<eos> But I have her name.<eos> - You give it to me.
I think you're starting to drive yourself crazy.<eos> It's him.<eos> At some point, you just have to learn to let go.<eos> Amelia took that drink.<eos> It doesn't matter who offered it to her.
Try something new.<eos> Every bad thing you said about me... .. is true.<eos> I have a plan.<eos> And for a second, I was going to drop it and I was going to leave with you, but it didn't work out, so my plan is back on.<eos> And I'm going to see it through.
I'll be right back.<eos> Where you going?<eos> To get my keys.<eos> The case isn't being reassigned till tomorrow.<eos> That means we got tonight to solve it.
[Joon's mom] That would make me very happy.<eos> One other thing.<eos> Yes, Mrs. Park?<eos> This ring belonged to my mother-in-law.<eos> I've been keeping it for Joon's future wife.
(clears his throat)<eos> Yeah. Mm-hmm.<eos> Sorry to bother you, Jen,<eos> But you left the Dufresne brief in the office. Um... okay, I'll take that.<eos> I'll just put it right here on the table.
Alright, well, you've reached the edge of town, so any further out and you're gonna freeze to death.<eos> - Just get in the car.<eos> - No, thank you.<eos> I've got a taser.<eos> Don't you make me use it.
This is about salvation.<eos> Salvation?<eos> What salvation?<eos> This test, it's meaningless.<eos> Okay, because no one is ever going to fucking see it!
It was a long story.<eos> What's in this vault?<eos> Something that can't be let out.<eos> Gonna need you to be a little more specific.<eos> First you have to swear that you'll never open it.
And, uh, good for you.<eos> Yeah, but the thing is the investor has just dumped this contract on us, right?<eos> And, well, you know, Dion knows food and I know wine, but neither of us knows a damn thing about the legal part of it all.<eos> Uh-huh. So, I was wondering if maybe you...<eos> You might have some time to kind of look it over.
- No.<eos> Capabilities awaken in one per million.<eos> Return the frame.<eos> Do you remember this friend?<eos> Well, and ? ! - We're clear who it is.
No, I know you said you've been in Amsterdam all week. Natalie...<eos> We've been back over it 20 times. There's nothing else to see.<eos> Mate, do you remember bagging up a stuffed monkey from Molly's room? I don't see anything on here.<eos> Anyway, who gives a rat's ass about a stuffed monkey?<eos> Whoever nicked it, that's who.
He's coming!<eos> Captain.<eos> I'm a... returning the plate.<eos> Thank you.<eos> If you don't mind just bringing it right through here.
I'll just be a moment.<eos> Good work, both of you.<eos> Now get him into a compromising position, but be careful.<eos> I'll take that.<eos> Kind of you to return it.
A lot.<eos> Way more than the others.<eos> Adam! My Barbie is broken!<eos> It's not broken.<eos> Get the head, I'll put it back on.
Adam! My Barbie is broken!<eos> It's not broken.<eos> Get the head, I'll put it back on.<eos> What's funny?<eos> - I love that line... "Get the head and I'll put it back on".
First... first we look at the color.<eos> Is it... neon purple or ruby garnet?<eos> Crystal clear or slightly hazy?<eos> Now we swirl the wine, get some air into it, you know?<eos> Let it stretch its legs, release some aromatics.
Is it... neon purple or ruby garnet?<eos> Crystal clear or slightly hazy?<eos> Now we swirl the wine, get some air into it, you know?<eos> Let it stretch its legs, release some aromatics.<eos> Give it a good swirl.
Come here, peanut.<eos> Are you okay? Yeah.<eos> Are you?<eos> Spencer's tooth came out... one of them.<eos> He wants you to see it.
How many apartments are there left to search? - Not many.<eos> - All right, thanks.<eos> Well, the driver of the truck was interviewed.<eos> He received an electronic dispatch from Ingersoll, Ontario, telling him to drive the truck from Canada<eos> - and leave it where we found it.
- Is this connected to the break-ins?<eos> - Break-ins?<eos> Mom, didn't you say something about a black truck?<eos> That's right.<eos> I saw it several times, driving back and forth.
Well, based on lividity, it was clear he was moved afterwards.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - Yeah, you're welcome.<eos> You told Detective Rizzoli that you were alone in the house when you killed Robert.<eos> - Go ahead and pick up that dummy and move it, there.
Not really.<eos> I cross-referenced Marvin Holtz's known associates.<eos> No connection to a butcher shop or anything like that.<eos> Closest thing I found was a deli on East Concord.<eos> Holtz's brother-in-law owns it.
- No. Nothing like that.<eos> Okay, well, if he thinks of anything else, give us a call.<eos> Okay.<eos> Thank you, Detective.<eos> Come on. Look, I don't know if it was a guy or a girl, but I'd recognize that zombie if I saw it again.
Can you flag all the missing credit cards for me?<eos> Anybody so much as buys as tank of gas, I wanna know about it.<eos> - This is my mug. - What?<eos> This is my mug!<eos> I left it at your house.
- The name?<eos> - Bob Rasmussen.<eos> Janitor.<eos> We have reason to believe that someone staged his murder to look like an accident.<eos> Well, I can't imagine Dr. Lutz making a mistake, but if he did, I am sure that he would want to know about it and do absolutely everything he can to correct it.
Yes, it did.<eos> Well, then why has he got a peanut butter granola bar?<eos> I mean... that can't be good for him, right?<eos> It's a postal barcode.<eos> - Why did he hide it there?
Well, he could've been wearing gloves when he used the stick.<eos> Well, if that were the case, then we'd expect to see smudges on the prints, but there were none.<eos> Ah, there you are.<eos> Uh, we just received the autopsy report from Robert's ex-girlfriend in Seattle.<eos> I put it on your desk.
But our victim's head wound was so significant that I couldn't conclusively match it to the stair or the field hockey stick.<eos> Why use a field hockey stick when he knew how to kill her with his bare hands?<eos> He didn't.<eos> The field hockey stick isn't the murder weapon.<eos> He just kept it so he could blame Clair for the murder if we didn't rule the death accidental.
Where would they find her name?<eos> Not from the hospital archives.<eos> Those records had been undisturbed for many years.<eos> Well, with that many deaths and a suicide, somebody had to have reported on it.<eos> [Thunderclap] If we can't find the article, then that means somebody stole it.
Wait a minute.<eos> This is the same model bike that our victim was riding.<eos> [Beep] And look what's below the seat.<eos> - Frankie: A water bottle mount.<eos> - If an explosive was in the bottle, someone could've planted it long before our victim even got on his bike.
Finally.<eos> I have two procedures scheduled this afternoon and I would very much prefer not to miss either one of them.<eos> Nobody needs Botox that bad.<eos> I don't add poison to the body.<eos> I free it of excess.
What, have you gotten yourself into?<eos> One of the trainees... I embarrassed him, and I think I touched a nerve.<eos> When class was over, he pulled the,<eos> "Hey, I dropped my pen.<eos> Can you bend over and pick it up?" gag.
Federal D.O.C. has existing aliases for operations like this.<eos> You are Lisa Caro.<eos> You're being brought in for an extradition hearing.<eos> I hate the name Lisa. Relax.<eos> You'll only have it for a couple of days.
Well, Edward was just a little luckier than Michael.<eos> Well, get the buckshot down to the crime lab.<eos> Maybe we can get fingerprints or DNA off it<eos> - if it was handloaded.<eos> - I already sent it to Kent.
It appears that he got run through with some sort of cylindrical object.<eos> And he's very clean.<eos> Yes, but a wound like this would have bled profusely.<eos> The family said that the funeral was at Mason Funeral Home in Mission Hill.<eos> They had the casket until the hearse picked it up and brought it here this morning.
He attacked me!<eos> That is bullshit!<eos> I tried to tell you that's the guy.<eos> I don't care what you tried to do.<eos> You wanted an emergency, now you got it.
Constance clootie.<eos> Do you even know the definition of "free?<eos> You. Can. Go.<eos> What did you do to my head?<eos> Gave it a little cleanse.
- I was wondering...<eos> - Yes, Agent Fitz?<eos> I was wondering if you could tell me exactly what it is you are designed for.<eos> Of course.<eos> Dr. Radcliffe, time and again, has expressed his deep regret for causing pain when all he ever wanted was to prevent it.
Interesting.<eos> I mean, it's not testicles on a cryostat, but I like it.<eos> Why do you have a storage unit?<eos> Just wait.<eos> How long have you had it?
Nothing.<eos> It was never about you.<eos> It was about the leopard.<eos> What?<eos> What, were you gonna steal it?
- You the owner?<eos> I am the sole proprietor.<eos> One employee, me.<eos> I like this place.<eos> You want to sell it to me?
Don't leave out any details.<eos> And I need something of Rocco's.<eos> A pacifier.<eos> Uh, in my room, on the dresser.<eos> I can get it.
And my name is Seeley Booth, and I'm a special agent with the FBI's homicide division.<eos> When I'm called out to a scene where the remains are badly burnt or decomposed, I call in Bones.<eos> He calls me "Bones." Mm-hmm.<eos> Even though I'm his wife and the mother of two of his children, he still refers to me by a nickname I despise.<eos> Well, you used to despise it, but now I think you like it.
I don't know what his dream was, and neither did he, so I did what he suggested and left.<eos> And not to be crass, kind of sounds like I made the right choice.<eos> I just feel bad for the victim.<eos> I feel like he never found his place in the world.<eos> Well, perhaps he never found it because he was never really looking.
That our victim is female. From intercondylar notch height, I'd say she was of European descent.<eos> And there's marbling on the abdomen, rigor has passed, lividity fixed.<eos> I'd say time of death was roughly 36 hours ago.<eos> Well, the mandible's intact.<eos> We should be able to match it to dental records.
You also help track diamonds, correct?<eos> Yes, we're able to etch microscopic markings that provides a degree of security our clients require.<eos> Now, what about the diamond that we found?<eos> Who does that belong to?<eos> I remember that particular diamond quite well; I marked it myself.
The rich today are no different from the kings and queens of old.<eos> They like expensive, pretty things no one else can have.<eos> No, what-what I meant was, specifically, who does that dagger belong to?<eos> Ah, well, that's another twist.<eos> It was on loan to a jewelry store for a display of "Crown Jewels of the World," but jewel thieves stole it three days ago, the day it arrived.
She's a lost cause.<eos> In terms of movies, I mean.<eos> Seriously.<eos> Well, in any event, this is excellent work.<eos> And if a French tapestry is our murder weapon, I can venture a guess where we might find it.
I think I would like, uh, how do you say, uh, I would like to buy... a 'amburger.<eos> Ze dam-burg-ers are magnifique.<eos> Hey, and they say the French don't have a sense of humor about themselves.<eos> When you're Inspector Rousseau of the Police Nationale, you better learn to have a sense of humor, you know?<eos> And to use it to ingratiate yourself to get information.
Wait. He-he may have been careful, but the killer had an emotional connection with his victim.<eos> Perhaps, he wasn't thinking clearly.<eos> Meaning?<eos> Meaning he did what you did naturally.<eos> He sheathed the dagger before he thought to clean it.
That's fine, Chadwick.<eos> You do whatever you want, 'cause right now we're in the process of gathering all this evidence so we can get a court order for your DNA.<eos> Actually, Booth, I'm-I'm not sure we need DNA to prove that he did this.<eos> And why exactly is that?<eos> Because as you strangled her, she took this dagger and swung it backward, hitting you... here.
This is Rafalski. 10-23 up on Gander Road.<eos> What's going on?<eos> We received an automated alarm from this residence, the call went straight to 9-1-1.<eos> Just wondering if you could tell me what you're doing here.<eos> We must have tripped it by accident.
I won't keep him long.<eos> I told you not to move.<eos> Now he comes down hall.<eos> You set the alarm.<eos> You knew we'd trip it and the police would come.
Come on.<eos> Her backpack.<eos> Have you found her backpack?<eos> Why do you ask?<eos> She must have it, then she's got her phone.
This is speculation and verging on harassment.<eos> You remember saying it was all about Marcella?<eos> - If it was, it's not any longer.<eos> - What do you mean?<eos> I'm saying, if there ever was a competition... I think I won it last night.
Take a look at this when you get a moment.<eos> Hey, Marcella...<eos> You had Matthew Neil's diary on your computer.<eos> How did you get the contents of my client's computer?<eos> Marcella Backland broke into my office and stole it, actually.
Then somebody comes out of nowhere and makes off with the spoils.<eos> Or have I misjudged you?<eos> Mm.<eos> You know what? There IS going to be a war.<eos> You just don't see it yet.
But I am forgetting.<eos> What's happening to me?<eos> I was wondering when you'd notice.<eos> It's like I'll be thinking of a moment from my past and then it... It vanishes.<eos> I can't get it back.
What?<eos> "I do." She left a message.<eos> What, a marriage proposal?<eos> No, no, no, no.<eos> She... She borrowed a-a ring from me this morning, said she needed it for cover.
The night before the job, Marcus met Edgar at some fancy club to get the worm program.<eos> When Marcus came back, both him and his laptop stunk like cigars,<eos> - and that's all I know.<eos> - Where's Marcus' laptop now?<eos> Okay, if there's still a copy of the worm program on here, I might be able to find out who created it.
I'm in. I have unlocked the security for the worm.<eos> What is it?<eos> I recognize this code.<eos> You do?<eos> How? Because I helped design it a long, long time ago.
Nice job smoothing things over with the feds for Hayley.<eos> Yeah, well, it didn't hurt that they were able to take credit for closing down a terrorism case, so...<eos> Oh, let there be light.<eos> That was fast.<eos> Well, since Hayley co-created the worm, she knew exactly how to help the U.K. authorities defeat it.
Okay, Stef, what happened?<eos> You told Caroline you'd be with her once things were safe, and you never showed.<eos> You broke her heart.<eos> Virginia forced Lucy Benett to seal a vault in the Armory with magic.<eos> Our other sister Yvette was still inside when they closed it.
I don't have a lot of time.<eos> And I need answers.<eos> Your sister Alex is hell-bent on having me open that vault.<eos> I need to know what's in it.<eos> Well, that's the question everyone's been asking since 1882... when my great-grandfather first managed to open it.
Stop moping about who you are not and try being who you are, the guy that's in love with Caroline Forbes.<eos> You just vervained her, Stefan.<eos> In my playbook, that's a notch above flowers and chocolates, because when you love someone, sometimes you have to go to those extremes.<eos> Listen, I know that you've been locked up in a coffin for the last three years of actual civilization, but that is legitimately terrible advice.<eos> Actually, brother, that advice is so good that I have to take it myself.
Who knows?<eos> Want me to kick your butt in cribbage? Huh?<eos> Go set up the board.<eos> And if you're looking for something to draw, here's the face of the guy who's gonna win, huh, right here.<eos> Do me a favor and dunk my head in this crap and hold it down until I stop breathing.
I see, so you selflessly agreed to spend the night at a brothel.<eos> He's very accommodating lately.<eos> Hey, Teej, jacket's not enough.<eos> Go get your hoodie.<eos> You don't want to wear it?
I remembered something else about Nordkoster.<eos> When Wendt came to ask for the phone, he had a suitcase with him.<eos> He left it there when he went away.<eos> That's weird.<eos> - - Yes and when I opened it, it was empty.
Come back, Shane."<eos> Then Shane rides off into the night.<eos> I don't know why, but it gets me every time, too.<eos> I remember that movie.<eos> We watched it on our honeymoon.
I mean, dating is like fishing, you know?<eos> You can sit on the water all day and not catch a bite.<eos> But a blind date?<eos> That's like a guy drives up in a boat and just throws you a fish.<eos> After that, all you gotta do is clean it and eat it.
I don't have a mythology.<eos> I have the unerring Word of God.<eos> But that's very interesting.<eos> Oh. I-I didn't mean to disparage your faith.<eos> Actually, I admire it.
Big balls?<eos> Oh, my... no.<eos> Seriously.<eos> Look, I found who e‐mailed the slap.<eos> Ooh, who sent it?
- I have the latest figures. - Yeah?<eos> - Taro's winning.<eos> - Shit.<eos> He's gained a point.<eos> I'll win it back.
Is that so?<eos> Hey, is, uh... is that your lunch?<eos> Little known fact;<eos> I'm the only person in New York who does not like kale.<eos> Well, how about I braise it with a little-- a little cream and pancetta, huh?
Composed mostly of bleach and potassium chloride.<eos> Bensonhurst Bomber's signature recipe.<eos> Still smell the chlorine.<eos> It was hidden inside a soccer ball.<eos> The victim, Tom O'Leary, picked it up and it exploded in his hands.
Well, we've been managing just fine without you.<eos> Your suit looks a bit cumbersome.<eos> Oh, actually, I made it to fit me perfectly.<eos> It's constructed out of a proprietary alloy, and it's been battle-tested quite a bit.<eos> I even wore it in space once.
I was hoping to torture you a little bit first, but since you're in such a rush,<eos> I will be glad to accommodate you with your schedule. Wait, wait.<eos> I'm a scientist.<eos> That exo-suit?<eos> I invented it.
Wait, what?<eos> You let the Shogun steal a 21st century super-suit?<eos> After I crash-landed trying to rescue you.<eos> How does the Shogun even know how to operate your ATOM suit?<eos> I designed it so an idiot could use it.
- That. Yeah, why'd you open a breach?<eos> - I didn't.<eos> - What?<eos> That's why we called you.<eos> - Well, can you close it?
I...<eos> I saw a transformer explode as this thing passed by it.<eos> - That is weird.<eos> - What's weird about that?<eos> Monster didn't even lay a finger on it.
I saw a transformer explode as this thing passed by it.<eos> - That is weird.<eos> - What's weird about that?<eos> Monster didn't even lay a finger on it.<eos> It exploded before it got to it.
Nothing near the precinct.<eos> Wait, what's that?<eos> Frozen food warehouse.<eos> There she is.<eos> Okay, I'm gonna isolate the feed so that no one else can see it.
Collins took a through-and-through. He'll be fine, but--<eos> What the hell is going on here?<eos> I'm really sorry about this, Sergeant.<eos> You're not here to secure the trigger.<eos> You're stealing it.
I got the forensic workup back on that piece of cloth from Ragman.<eos> Please tell me that's not what we're actually going to call him.<eos> What'd you find? That it is over 2,000 years old and...<eos> Radioactive.<eos> Which means trackable. If this weapons buy is going down, this guy is going to try to stop it.
When did, uh, babysitting evidence become part of the job description?<eos> Since I trust you.<eos> You do?<eos> I mean, all things considered?<eos> If we didn't think you were right for the job, we wouldn't have offered it to you, right?
We think this is where Rene was being held.<eos> - Was?<eos> - Blood's still fresh. They must have just moved him.<eos> KH-10 shows a panel van moving from that location<eos> - 40 minutes ago. - Can you track it?
I have been able to every other time somebody asked me that question.<eos> - Got it.<eos> - Where?<eos> This is a little awkward, but...<eos> Oliver made me promise that if we got our location on Rene I would only share it with him.
He's got this.<eos> You got a lot of faith, man.<eos> Green Arrow--<eos> Shut up!<eos> You're not getting the job done because you don't take it seriously enough maybe because you haven't lost anyone.
So am I.<eos> That was awesome.<eos> There's the regulator.<eos> She seems pretty attached to it.<eos> Heh heh. Maybe just remove it.
And in this case, it might just get you killed.<eos> I could really use a genie right now.<eos> I would wish that my kid was already born and sleeping through the night.<eos> Bro, fatherhood has made you so damn boring.<eos> If I had a wish, I'd use it to become the top MMA fighter in the world and take home a different hot chick every single night.
Hey, Eamonn, you're not fooling anybody.<eos> I can see you right there.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Curious that you recognize the sound of my truck.<eos> You been driving it recently?
You missed your last few appointments.<eos> We had an awkward session.<eos> [Vic] What exactly happened at your session?<eos> I brought her a stew.<eos> I made it myself from scratch from a rabbit I shot.
I made it myself from scratch from a rabbit I shot.<eos> - Wow, you shot a rabbit?<eos> - Right?<eos> You know, I never cooked that stew for nobody but Jean.<eos> It was homemade, but she just... turned it down.
If you had to.<eos> In fact, I'd like you to rank them in the order in which you'd be willing to eat them.<eos> Listen to your gut.<eos> My gut is telling me very loudly not to play this game.<eos> I guess I could cut the mold off the crabapple, wash it really well, and technically... the cockroach is edible, if I cook it...
"Killing to protect a loved one is understandable, even if the act is premeditated."<eos> "Taking pleasure in torture is even worse than murder."<eos> I think taking this test would be torture.<eos> It is a little macabre.<eos> People take it voluntarily?
I was simply looking for an item that I had lost track of.<eos> Years ago, I had brought an antique ring over from London.<eos> It was intended as a gift for the Countess of Morcar.<eos> I may be visiting the countess shortly, so I remembered the ring.<eos> You haven't seen it, have you?
Then you can review my answers, and see if you agree on a new theory.<eos> You're taking Dr. Naylor's survey?<eos> Why would you do that to yourself?<eos> And why are you listening to disco?<eos> I'm taking the test because you said Arthur Tetch took it.
Yes, he has, on occasion.<eos> When he wants to keep something out of sight and mind.<eos> Me, for example.<eos> This ring belonged to my mother.<eos> Always struck me as odd that he ever held onto it at all.
This ring belonged to my mother.<eos> Always struck me as odd that he ever held onto it at all.<eos> I never had him pegged as the sentimental type.<eos> As it turns out, he isn't.<eos> He was just holding onto it in case he needed it.
I'm not responsible for her drug use, nor for any of the proclivities I may have inherited from her.<eos> On the other hand, I really am no fan of abdicating personal responsibility.<eos> Hence the repetition of the step.<eos> Are you going to give your father the ring?<eos> So that he can give it to some corrupt official who may have some specious information to sell?
I don't understand.<eos> This is the DANTE survey.<eos> Yeah, we were wondering, have you ever taken the test yourself?<eos> Dr. Naylor never allowed it.<eos> She didn't think anyone on the team should take it.
Request permission to withdraw.<eos> Granted.<eos> Get to...<eos> The crystal will not serve you.<eos> Nor you once I take it from this accursed city.
Ain't no turning back now.<eos> Status report.<eos> Ulric killed some good men.<eos> - What about the ring?<eos> - We don't have it yet.
You never were too smart.<eos> You could've had a new future with the empire.<eos> There's nowhere to run, princess.<eos> The ring.<eos> Give it to me.
I only came to tell you, you are no kings.<eos> Your worth has been weighed and found wanting.<eos> Now burn.<eos> You're going to lose your precious ring.<eos> But it's not too late to save it.
Genesis carried out the work here.<eos> In your house, Chasseron.<eos> - What do you want?<eos> - To take your place.<eos> There are two options. Either I give it up or you take it.
- What do you want?<eos> - To take your place.<eos> There are two options. Either I give it up or you take it.<eos> Let's put it another way.<eos> I'll take it but it will look like you gave it to me.
What's up?<eos> Lucas is the son of Claudia Marène and an ex-con, Pierre Barrès.<eos> How do you know?<eos> I traced Lucas' history. He's lying.<eos> He cooked up a fake life and sold it to us for the last 20 years.
I know he's your cousin, but, seriously, what is up with that guy?<eos> Always takes it too far.<eos> When we were kids, he borrowed a neighbor's dog.<eos> - Borrowed, as in stole?<eos> - Everybody was looking for it.
Always takes it too far.<eos> When we were kids, he borrowed a neighbor's dog.<eos> - Borrowed, as in stole?<eos> - Everybody was looking for it.<eos> Couldn't find it.
- Sold it.<eos> I'm done with it.<eos> - With the trailer?<eos> - Yep.<eos> Don't need it anymore.
I'm starving, too.<eos> No, I'm ready to get married.<eos> I have proposed to you twice, and you still haven't given me an answer.<eos> I bought you a ring.<eos> You told me not to get rid of it, so it's just sitting in a drawer, collecting dust.
They just want to know what's gonna happen. What do you think?<eos> Here's what I think, Karev.<eos> I think if you get to the point where you're gonna walk down the aisle with someone, she's earned some trust... and faith.<eos> She's earned the benefit of the doubt.<eos> So I'm giving it to her.
You have proof he's even alive?<eos> I used to.<eos> It was destroyed.<eos> I had his left thumb in a jar in my office.<eos> Krasnov cut it off himself.
Well, this one looks like it's been here forever, and this one looks like it's brand new.<eos> Is that important?<eos> It is if it means this one used to have a bomb strapped to it.<eos> Krasnov would not have risked assembling an explosive device in the back of a water truck.<eos> He would have prepared it and strapped it to the hand truck in advance.
Most of the charges were in a section of Queens where there are a couple of no-tell motels.<eos> With any luck, they'll find him in one.<eos> If he was Moriarty's agent, she'd have him on the other side of the globe by now.<eos> Yeah, well, she probably wouldn't have given him a bunch of gift cards either.<eos> I mean, Vikner may have her job, but it doesn't mean he's as good at it as she was.
Don't be sorry. You got a sneak peek at the world's most epic dick.<eos> It is perfection, isn't it?<eos> I didn't really notice.<eos> It was sculpted by the gods.<eos> You've seen it?
I didn't really notice.<eos> It was sculpted by the gods.<eos> You've seen it?<eos> I've heard about it.<eos> It's so thick you can't quite fit your fingers all the way around it.
Put it on speaker.<eos> Good.<eos> Getting by.<eos> That's great.<eos> And no, I haven't sent it.
Why would you tell me?<eos> You don't even know me.<eos> I'm a pretty good judge of character.<eos> I'm fairly certain I can trust you.<eos> If you still need proof, I can give it to you. How?
I decide who's off limits.<eos> You're Nolan Keats?<eos> Yes. It's my pen name.<eos> I don't believe you.<eos> If you still need proof, I can give it to you.
Dear Ashley,<eos> I'd like to invite you a little deeper into my world.<eos> How would you feel about a real-life submissive experience with me as your guide?<eos> If this piques your interest, enclosed you'll find a sealed envelope with your first task.<eos> Don't open it unless you're willing to venture down a dark and twisted rabbit hole with me.
This... is home.<eos> I'm not broken.<eos> I know.<eos> Elena?<eos> Our truck, he took it!
I can't get through.<eos> Building 5, 802, hurry.<eos> Please save my wife and kid.<eos> This coat is really beautiful.<eos> Where did you buy it?
This is my coat.<eos> That's my mom's.<eos> I've told you... this is my coat!<eos> That's my mom's coat!<eos> She was just wearing it.
Who drew this? -<eos> - Rembrandt.<eos> Where's the earring now? -<eos> - At the Central Lab in Göteborg I guess.<eos> We'll have them send it over.
Hmm. The guy I'm having dinner with is the hematologist in charge of analyzing Alice Tetch's blood.<eos> I'm free after 10:00 if you want to call.<eos> Thanks for the coffee.<eos> We found the truck.<eos> They ditched it in the Narrows.
You really thought I'd give you real bullets?<eos> You are an idiot!<eos> I will kill you for this!<eos> Sounds like we're missing all the fun. Got plenty of fun left for you.<eos> You know, if you're gonna take a girl hostage in her own place, you might want to search it first.
Pulled him out of the way of a truck.<eos> Get him on the phone now. I already tried him.<eos> No answer.<eos> What happened, you forget your cane?<eos> I don't need it anymore.
Excuse me.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Who's had this job the longest?<eos> - Um... maybe me.<eos> I've been at it two whole months. Huh. - Oh.
Yeah, it was close.<eos> You want any? No.<eos> Uh, not now.<eos> You know, I got to say, Rowena, I took one look at you, and all I wanted was to snap your miserable neck again.<eos> And keep it snapped this time.
Laws of the universe and all that, so...<eos> I didn't ask to come back here.<eos> No, you didn't.<eos> And you hate it.<eos> The look in your eyes, I've seen it before.
Yes, but there's much more to it than that.<eos> Everything in English is for my staff's consumption.<eos> Everything in red is for me.<eos> The Persian script is in code.<eos> You won't crack it.
It makes the murder of Sabine Raoult all the more pointless.<eos> My father was never a threat to Vikner's ascendency...<eos> Did you find something?<eos> Where's the calendar for 2013?<eos> Kitchen- - I brought it down there when I made my dinner.
I'm looking for your father.<eos> I haven't been able to track him down anywhere.<eos> He's travelling today.<eos> I don't think so.<eos> I got this letter by courier, just a little while ago, and the man who delivered it to me said that he stood by and watched your father write it.
From the 15th to 19th century, human trafficking on a huge scale flowed between Europe, Africa and America.<eos> 12 million men, women and children were sold as slaves on the coast of Africa, snatched from their land and shipped across the Atlantic by white slavers, to work in the New World.<eos> this trade increased over 150 years and resisted many campaigns to abolish it.
Whatever happened, I know that you're a victim.<eos> - Can I go? - Yes.<eos> - Hi, Isa.<eos> - Hi. The autopsy report.<eos> I wanted to bring it myself.
Thank you.<eos> Mr. Kim--<eos> Attention please. Due to a blockage on our track, we have stopped at East Daegu Station.<eos> We should either wait for the rescue team, or we will have to go to Busan using another train.<eos> As soon as I end this announcement, I will find a working train and park it on the leftmost track.
Hey, baby.<eos> Come on, jacob, let's go!<eos> Whoo! Come on, buddy, you got this!<eos> I hate this game.<eos> Why doesn't he throw the ball so he can hit it?
I'm begging for you to cover for me.<eos> And I am begging you to show up for your next check-in...<eos> Monday at 11:30 a.m.<eos> You have two days. My next check-in isn't until Wednesday.<eos> I just moved it up.
You met Alejandro in a palace?<eos> In Madrid, yeah. Total fairy tale. Of course, I didn't know it then.<eos> I was so drunk on champagne.<eos> Oh, my God, I cannot do champagne.<eos> I had one crazy night in college, and now the smell of it just...
Do you have your own key?<eos> It's in my purse.<eos> It's right this way. It's the...<eos> - It's the Tesla.<eos> - Unlock it.
It's in my purse.<eos> It's right this way. It's the...<eos> - It's the Tesla.<eos> - Unlock it.<eos> - Unlock it! - No.
- Blue. - Held her steady enough...<eos> - Blue.<eos> - What?<eos> - Toxicology are looking at the cake.<eos> Meantime, let's drop in on the person that sent it.
- By who?<eos> Looks like, um... Looks like identical tweets from a set of duplicate bot accounts.<eos> Automated. It's like spam.<eos> This is someone trying to seed the tag, you know?<eos> Get it out there.
Someone's holding a public ballot, bumping off the top person.<eos> - Jesus, it's just mad.<eos> - Yeah, and it's growing.<eos> Day one. 63 people used the hashtag on Jo Powers, okay?<eos> On day two, 223 used it on Tusk.
- Jesus, it's just mad.<eos> - Yeah, and it's growing.<eos> Day one. 63 people used the hashtag on Jo Powers, okay?<eos> On day two, 223 used it on Tusk.<eos> - Who's using it now? - There's...
- I'll just get my pack here.<eos> - Rav will take care of that.<eos> Oh, Rav will take care of that.<eos> Okay, great.<eos> That's good. I don't wanna carry it anyway.
Take a couple of Krav Maga classes and I'd be ready.<eos> I'd be ready!<eos> Kali ma!<eos> I'm gonna get some wine. Re-up.<eos> I'd offer you some, but I don't think you can drink it so...
It's not gonna happen to me, it's not gonna happen to us.<eos> You want me to come home?<eos> Just make sure you're still you when it's all over.<eos> So three years in the jungles fighting FARC.<eos> Hugo Martinez chose his own path a long time ago and he hasn't deviated from it since.
Stay where you are!<eos> Hands where I can see them.<eos> Relax, relax.<eos> Want to see my ID?<eos> - Take it out slowly.
I've been thinking...<eos> I could buy some land here next to you.<eos> Some cows, maybe some sheep.<eos> And have my own farm.<eos> We could run it together.
I will not rest until that happens.<eos> Alvaro, drive slowly.<eos> Park up ahead.<eos> I only have one notebook.<eos> Let me go get it.
Does this dressing look drizzled on?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - No. No, this lettuce is drowning.<eos> It's floating on a sea of ranch, like little Kate Win slet's in Titanic.<eos> Get it out of my sight.
This is my calling.<eos> Open it.<eos> Is this my résumé?<eos> The minute you came in to interview as my assistant, I had an instinct about you.<eos> So I scribbled "reporter" on your résumé, and I stuffed it right here in this drawer, and I hired you on the spot.
Mrs. Salvon?<eos> Why did you keep your parakeet after the animals changed?<eos> He belonged to my late husband.<eos> The bird hated everyone.<eos> When Gunter passed, I couldn't bring myself to put it in quarantine.
It's not the network's fault for airing it! It's you guys!<eos> Why are you watching this stuff?<eos> It's your fault for demanding so little of us that we settle.<eos> I can't feel my face right now, but you know what?<eos> I knew exactly what this job was when I took it. Shame on me for taking the money!
Wait, is it gone?<eos> It was, but now it's back.<eos> What?<eos> So it's not gone?<eos> You're not good? I beat it once, I'll beat it again.
Four two decades, we protected and served.<eos> Now we rule these streets.<eos> Dad, my...<eos> My seat's wobbly.<eos> Yeah, that's 'cause I, uh... I added it last night, and the light wasn't too good.
You have lost the path.<eos> It is time... for a change--<eos> Enough!<eos> Get the dog.<eos> If he resists, shoot it. No! No--
Are you okay?<eos> And do me a favor, check out the penthouse.<eos> They've had a "Do Not Disturb" since 2:00 p.m. yesterday.<eos> You still have your master key?<eos> No, I... misplaced it.
- Get in here.<eos> - Stand down.<eos> - You can't just come in...<eos> - They stole the soul exchanger!<eos> And you know who has it?
Patrick Spring.<eos> Crazy to see it up close, right?<eos> So much money, and then...<eos> Where's the head?<eos> We're keeping it separate.
Crazy to see it up close, right?<eos> So much money, and then...<eos> Where's the head?<eos> We're keeping it separate.<eos> You can see it if you'd like.
- I burnt your house down?<eos> - Where's Lydia?<eos> - She's not here.<eos> Bring me the dog. - Why do you want it?<eos> - Why did you take it?
What the hell is a "po-tah-to"?<eos> Oh, man... really?<eos> Do you know this song?<eos> Yes, of course.<eos> How? Like... like you've heard it before?
Patrick Spring rarely left anything of importance to chance.<eos> When Patrick had me track you down, he knew.<eos> He knew he was going to die.<eos> Do you know, I'm beginning to think he didn't hire me to prevent his murder at all.<eos> I think he hired me to solve it.
Did I only make mistakes?<eos> Yes.<eos> But did it all work out?<eos> Kind of!<eos> I had a plan, and I put it into action, and it went off flawlessly.
I deserve a little respect too, even if I'm a nobody.<eos> What do you want from me?<eos> I want to really understand what I'm doing.<eos> Sit down.<eos> I may lose this war, but I have to fight it, because this is my home.
He was given an ID although he was banished.<eos> Your address is on it.<eos> - So, where is he?<eos> - No idea. No one flings a letter of the President of the Republic.<eos> We gave it to a churchman who knows how to reach him.
Hey, what are you doing with that corn cob?<eos> Cosmo, drop that.<eos> You can't have that.<eos> No!<eos> He swallowed it.
I gotta go.<eos> Mom!<eos> Who were you talking to?<eos> Nobody, it was the TV.<eos> I just turned it off.
[Jenk] Oh. - I doubt Pinkie's held a gun in his life. - [zipper closes]<eos> Maybe it's another Dick Cheney situation where one of them shot the other.<eos> If Pinkie's so inexperienced, why did Dan invite him along?<eos> Dan needs an audience.<eos> You know like they say, if a bear shits in the woods and nobody saw you shoot it, did it really die?
You remember that scarf you thought was Molly's?<eos> I gave that to James last Christmas.<eos> Why would Molly have it?<eos> James was at our flat a few times.<eos> Maybe he left it and Molly started using it.
I know it was ruled a suicide, but in the light of the Molly Ryan accusations...<eos> He didn't kill her.<eos> Hanna sent me a letter.<eos> It's a suicide note.<eos> I got it the day after she died.
He didn't kill her.<eos> Hanna sent me a letter.<eos> It's a suicide note.<eos> I got it the day after she died.<eos> I still have it.
Hanna sent me a letter.<eos> It's a suicide note.<eos> I got it the day after she died.<eos> I still have it.<eos> You have it at home?
- Yeah, people are<eos> - so mean.<eos> - This is serious, Stan.<eos> We need to get Grace's passport back.<eos> I did some research, and we might be able to get it released under Section 29B of the Criminal Code...
Someone's being economical with the truth.<eos> What's with the thong? It was bothering me that Molly had so many posh things for a poor girl from uni.<eos> I thought she might have a sugar daddy.<eos> This little bit of lace and string cost 200 quid.<eos> I tracked it to a boutique on Pont Street but, unfortunately, it was a dead end.
But I do like your enthusiasm.<eos> Havoc needs more strong, capable, gutsy women.<eos> - Frankly, more me.<eos> Ladies, we have this room in five minutes for our destroy NOV-Eight party, so...<eos> Can't you see we're using it?
Havoc needs more strong, capable, gutsy women.<eos> - Frankly, more me.<eos> Ladies, we have this room in five minutes for our destroy NOV-Eight party, so...<eos> Can't you see we're using it?<eos> Yeah, but, like, I reserved it for Carson Lazarus.
It was only a few days ago.<eos> Find me that film please,<eos> I'm curious,<eos> I want to know who the rat is.<eos> Don't worry, I'll find it for you.
The bite on your neck.<eos> What?<eos> I gave you a dose of the original HZN1 vaccine.<eos> It counters his bite and frees us from Murphy's control.<eos> I've been taking it too.
Show it to me.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Is it supposed to be flashing like that?<eos> We don't have much time.<eos> We need to transfer it now.
- Can I go yet? - Mmm.<eos> Afraid not.<eos> We still have a number of tests we'd like to run, and unfortunately, your MRI didn't turn out.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> Well, it's just that if the scan was accurate, you'd barely even be able to communicate with me right now, but it's no big deal, we just need to do it again, and I'll put a rush on this one for you.
014 needs protection.<eos> He wrote a backdoor hack that a faction in the future is desperate to get their hands on.<eos> What faction?<eos> A group is trying to topple the director, and they wanna use my code to do it.<eos> - I came here to hide it, so it's useless.
- This one's the director's favorite.<eos> - Only when you're not around.<eos> - So how's my code gonna save a life?<eos> - You'll see.<eos> And don't worry. I'll destroy it as soon as I'm done.
- So how's my code gonna save a life?<eos> - You'll see.<eos> And don't worry. I'll destroy it as soon as I'm done.<eos> Wait.<eos> You need it now?
You are the morning to my night<eos> You are the comrade to my life<eos> The blanket to my winter<eos> -Sir, he's approaching the record.<eos> -He will pass it too.
The only way to get home is to take control of this ship!<eos> With my brains and your muscly physique, what could go wrong?<eos> [Julien] Oh! Ah! I hope this dish of wood chips, sea foam, and my own spittle will nourish your bodies.<eos> I know who's getting the trophy for best gruel!<eos> Hmm... Aw, man, I really thought I had it this time.
A trophy?<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> Word on the boat is, it's like a million times better than all the other trophies combined.<eos> Really?<eos> How do we get it then?
-[Maurice spits]<eos> I know a way.<eos> Maurice, what are we looking for?<eos> Over the years, as various laws were made by the Julien Kings, they were written down in these books.<eos> If there is a way to make Brodney royal, we'll find it here.
These citizens here with me have had enough.<eos> -That's true.<eos> Oh. They've had enough of feeling safe and confident?<eos> Gee, that's a strange thing to want less of.<eos> Maurice, I hear what you're saying. If you want me to get rid of my scorpion, well, [shouting] you'll have to pry it from my cold, dead paws, buddy!
Jesus Christ!<eos> He's alive.<eos> He's cold. Dead for hours.<eos> Look for a key!<eos> - I got it!
- About what?<eos> - About the rock, alien boy!<eos> God, you keep saying how you're this prince, but all you do is stand around and ask stupid questions and get obvious things wrong!<eos> Is the rock dangerous?<eos> Yes. Yes, it's dangerous. If you hold it too long it fries your brain.
Fine.<eos> In our new minivan.<eos> Hey, what's for lunch?<eos> You bought a minivan?<eos> ! It's for the baby, and I didn't buy it.
In our new minivan.<eos> Hey, what's for lunch?<eos> You bought a minivan?<eos> ! It's for the baby, and I didn't buy it.<eos> The dealer loaned it to me for a 24-hour test drive.
Mimosas coming up.<eos> I once left orange juice in my fridge so long, it tasted like a mimosa.<eos> How old was it?<eos> It's hard to say.<eos> I don't remember much after I drank it.
- Ms. Luthor.<eos> - Lena, please.<eos> It's good to see you again, Ms. Danvers.<eos> - Well, if I'm calling you Lena...<eos> - Kara it is. Um, if you have a parking ticket, I can have it validated for you.
The article's amazing. Yeah, I knew you'd make a great reporter, but after I heard your bleeding heart, pro-alien views, I was afraid you'd do a hatchet job on me.<eos> Oh, I tried.<eos> I tried, I wrote a scathing article about your device.<eos> - And?<eos> - And... My boss tossed it.
Oh, I tried.<eos> I tried, I wrote a scathing article about your device.<eos> - And?<eos> - And... My boss tossed it.<eos> He made me re-do it.
I ordered the breakfast combo, and he stole some of my bacon.<eos> If you want any other details, the answer is suck a dick.<eos> Wait here.<eos> Remember that movie?<eos> I used to love it growing up.
Is there anything you want to talk to me about?<eos> Can you tell me your name?<eos> What is this?<eos> Is that your TV?<eos> Turn it off.
Can you tell me your name?<eos> What is this?<eos> Is that your TV?<eos> Turn it off.<eos> Turn it off.
You're my scientist now.<eos> This mission belongs to us.<eos> Not Hammond, not Garnett, and not the CDC.<eos> We survived for some cosmic reason.<eos> And I'm naming it.
It's the one parked in the driveway.<eos> -I'm thinking of something tasteful--<eos> -Uh, say no more.<eos> I've sketched this out a dozen times already.<eos> [stammering] Uh, hello. My name is Jim, Uncle Jim. And I have an act so sensational, you'll wanna book it immediately.
Comedy trio?<eos> No, I'm a solo act.<eos> No, we don't accept your stupid check, okay?<eos> Okay.<eos> We don't want it.
♪ Love shack, baby ♪<eos> ♪ I'm headin' down the Atlanta highway ♪ [inhales sharply]<eos> -What do you think? -That was so good.<eos> You're... you're amazing.<eos> My new fan, Patrice, requested it. [chuckles]
[laughing] Ah, good one!<eos> -[audience laughing] -[Owen] She's so funny!<eos> -Okay, seriously, though. I need to...<eos> -[April laughs] uh, I need to give the ring to... to April now, so--<eos> -No, you gave it to me.
Cynthia. Look, look,<eos> My toca box. - What is that?<eos> - Heh heh.<eos> Estoy bien.<eos> You know, Maestro Rivera, he took it away from me.
My toca box. - What is that?<eos> - Heh heh.<eos> Estoy bien.<eos> You know, Maestro Rivera, he took it away from me.<eos> He took it away from me, and he locked it up. He locked it up with all my things. He locked it.
Use it on the petals and you save us all. You and Matteusz can live happily ever after.<eos> You're wrong.<eos> I die either way.<eos> - What?<eos> - If I use it, I really am lost.
Yes. What's so scary about local guardians?<eos> Are you leaving now?<eos> Why would I stay?<eos> Here is a letter.<eos> I found it among Miss Bai's things.
Why would I stay?<eos> Here is a letter.<eos> I found it among Miss Bai's things.<eos> Sorry,<eos> It didn't have an envelope, so I opened it.
Oh, did you find my Social Security check?<eos> Well, my granddaughter called you about it last week.<eos> No, ma'am.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> - We haven't found it yet.
But we also know how worked up you get<eos> - when it comes to yogurt.<eos> Yeah. It's great.<eos> - Right.<eos> - I love it.
Yeah. It's great.<eos> - Right.<eos> - I love it.<eos> - We know.<eos> - I love it.
- Yeah.<eos> - Remember?<eos> - And you had your favorite skipping rock.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> And we'd take hours trying to find it again.
I thought Walt gave you the day off.<eos> He did.<eos> I just didn't know what to do with myself.<eos> I just talked to the state police.<eos> There's no sign of the semi, so I'm guessing that they ditched it and transferred Eddie into another vehicle.
So he left two years ago.<eos> Was there really a letter four months ago?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I swear.<eos> I got it.
That's just because Anson Hamilton is a hack poet.<eos> No.<eos> No, that's not it.<eos> You're pronouncing one of the words wrong.<eos> This county... we call it Absaroka.
- You know, I should have bought some beer.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> I just... This is perfect.<eos> Mm. Let me take, um...<eos> Let me take your... your hat, and, um, I'll put that ov... over here, and then if you want to take off your coat, I'll hang it up.
The air, the updraft.<eos> Lifting you, carrying you. Up into the sky.<eos> I thought you were gonna snooze the whole flight.<eos> Sleep's a luxury.<eos> Grab it where you can.
It is more hostile to life than any place on earth.<eos> The hottest it gets on Mars is about 0 degrees celsius.<eos> And that's like high noon in the summer time on the Equator.<eos> But at night it will get as low as minus 100 celsius.<eos> There is a fundamental problem that we're going to have to deal with in terms of a Mars mission that was never the case with the apollo program, and that is the human body and how do we protect it for long,
It's all covered in dust.<eos> Let's see if it's something from here.<eos> Javier, todo bien?<eos> Esta bien, esta bien, esta muy bien.<eos> Robert... if you open a cover, close it.
Of course it means something to me. What are you talking about?<eos> It's a time to be strong, to make a statement that says we're here to stay.<eos> You're not going to influence my recommendation to the committee.<eos> We've come too far Joon.<eos> If the train is derailing, there's nothing I can do to keep it on the tracks.
But the second cufflink was nowhere to be found.<eos> He spent a considerable amount of time and money searching for it... over 50 years, in fact.<eos> But then, on the night of May 30, 1922, just after the dedication ceremony for the Lincoln Memorial, Robert Lincoln, who was in his late 70s, was approached by a man named Theodore Kipling.<eos> Now, Theodore Kipling had worked as an usher at the Ford's Theater the night the President was shot.<eos> He claimed he found the missing cufflink that night and agreed to return it to the President's son for a price.
I tried to be polite when your protégé accused me of not doing my job with Leonard Bailey.<eos> But I'm not gonna be told by someone who harbored a fraud what a bad lawyer I am.<eos> I don't think you're a bad lawyer, Georgina.<eos> I think you're a good lawyer that made a mistake.<eos> And I'm here to give you a chance to fix it.
- What do you mean, no? - No.<eos> They're already going after our money.<eos> I don't want to do anything that's gonna mess with Jill's deal.<eos> Listen to me. That deal is as solid as a rock.<eos> I wrote it myself;
They're already going after our money.<eos> I don't want to do anything that's gonna mess with Jill's deal.<eos> Listen to me. That deal is as solid as a rock.<eos> I wrote it myself;<eos> they can't take it away from her any more than they can take my deal away from me.
That guy was a murdering piece of shit who should've been put away for life, and now you're trying to get him out?<eos> He's in there with Mike Ross.<eos> I don't care.<eos> Well, I do, because like you just said, he is a murdering piece of shit.<eos> But what you don't know is, I made a deal with him, and I'm not gonna break it.
I don't think you understand.<eos> I'm not doing this just to stay alive.<eos> I'm doing this so one day I can knock on my kid's door, and they'll know their father is an innocent man.<eos> If I take this deal, that's never gonna happen.<eos> If you don't take it, it may never happen either.
He asked me what I thought.<eos> I'm not gonna lie to him.<eos> I never would've thought Robert Zane's daughter would be so naive.<eos> Naive?<eos> I was actually starting to believe that you cared about this case, but the only thing that you care about is putting it to bed as quickly as possible.
- You see what I'm dealing with?<eos> I only took those meetings because I'm being pressured to take those meetings.<eos> - I get it.<eos> That asshole wants your job.<eos> - He doesn't just want it.
I only took those meetings because I'm being pressured to take those meetings.<eos> - I get it.<eos> That asshole wants your job.<eos> - He doesn't just want it.<eos> If I don't let you go, he's gonna get it.
Without help, you're not gonna be able get back up.<eos> Please, take my hand.<eos> - I appreciate your offer more than you know, Robert.<eos> But I've had my name first for too long.<eos> I can't go back to having it last.
Please, take my hand.<eos> - I appreciate your offer more than you know, Robert.<eos> But I've had my name first for too long.<eos> I can't go back to having it last.<eos> - Jessica, if you don't do this, you're not gonna have it anywhere.
Just the men standing on them.<eos> Don't worry, Tina.<eos> You're with us now. And we'll never leave you, baby.<eos> But now that you mention it, I do in fact have a plan.<eos> And everybody's gonna love it because it's a vast improvement over my opponent's untenable wall nonsense.
Mike.<eos> One of my classmates stuck him in my face in front of the entire class to win an argument.<eos> And the only thing you want to stick in her face is your fist?<eos> Something like that.<eos> So the professor offered me an Innocence Project case, and I want to take it, but if I do...
That's your new job.<eos> From now on you're doing kitchen duty with him.<eos> And if I catch you doing the warden, you're going to solitary.<eos> I didn't ask for kitchen duty.<eos> Maybe not, but I think I know who gave it to you.
Do you remember my Innocence Project case?<eos> How could I not?<eos> Badass Rachel.<eos> Well, thank you.<eos> So I took it, but now they're saying that it doesn't qualify.
Something he has not right to.<eos> I have every right to make sure that your client is operating within the law.<eos> And what exactly is your basis to say that he isn't?<eos> Your Honor, when you break the home run record, and someone says, "Your bat is corked,"<eos> you turn it over to show it's not.
I have every right to make sure that your client is operating within the law.<eos> And what exactly is your basis to say that he isn't?<eos> Your Honor, when you break the home run record, and someone says, "Your bat is corked,"<eos> you turn it over to show it's not.<eos> Except when that bat is the reason you hit all those homers, because the second he gets it, everyone in the world's gonna know what's in it.
What happens is, we're already built back up by then, so instead of blaming me for the position Sutter has put you in,<eos> I suggest you go ahead and find yourself a way out of it.<eos> Rachel, what can I do for you?<eos> I was hoping you could do something for Leonard Bailey.<eos> I drafted a motion to reopen his case, but I need a current member of the Bar to file it.
Bullshit.<eos> I don't think so, Sean, because you don't break a guy out of prison just to advance your career.<eos> Look, this means something to you.<eos> I don't need to know what it is, but it means something to me too, so let's just admit that we're in this together and get this thing done.<eos> Take that garbage and throw it away.
But I was really just the world's biggest sucker, because I let that son of a bitch get one over on me, and I'll regret it for the rest of my life.<eos> What if you could get one over on him?<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> You said yourself, they offered you a deal.<eos> I bet they'd still take it.
- Let's have it.<eos> She filed for a name change in New Jersey in 2008.<eos> - What's her new name?<eos> - That's just it.<eos> Carter couldn't get it.
She filed for a name change in New Jersey in 2008.<eos> - What's her new name?<eos> - That's just it.<eos> Carter couldn't get it.<eos> The only reason he couldn't get it is if the state is denying access to those records for her own safety.
Drug user or not,<eos> Maria Gomez never had a chance to be heard.<eos> If you'll excuse me, I need to go to my office.<eos> I'm not going anywhere!<eos> Not until you understand that if you are sorry for me, you wouldn't have taken this case on in the first place instead of using it to make a name for yourself.
As far as the SEC is concerned, Mike lead directly to the witness who's gonna put that piece of shit away for the rest of his life.<eos> You have a small window to come clean with the SEC and save yourself.<eos> I would never turn on my own father.<eos> I didn't take this deal for that son of a bitch.<eos> I took it for my wife.
You lose this case, we take it in the knee.<eos> - Jessica, the guy is guilty.<eos> - And you're his goddamn lawyer.<eos> And you took this case.<eos> And I never would have taken it if it wasn't to get Mike out.
- Jessica, the guy is guilty.<eos> - And you're his goddamn lawyer.<eos> And you took this case.<eos> And I never would have taken it if it wasn't to get Mike out.<eos> Well, you did take it.
Mike, sit down.<eos> I need to talk to you.<eos> You needed to talk to me yesterday when Cahill decided to pull my deal.<eos> He's saying it was the people above him.<eos> And I didn't want to tell you about it until I figured out how to get it back.
I want you to convince her that this is it.<eos> She has a one-time chance of getting immunity if she turns on her father now.<eos> How the hell do you even know this Cahill guy'll do that?<eos> Because I know how bad he wants Sutter, and offering Jill a deal is the best way to make that happen.<eos> Or he promises her a deal, then takes it away.
But it also says that you acknowledge that I brought her to you.<eos> Well, then I better bring it to my office and sign it.<eos> Oh, and for what it's worth,<eos> I didn't try to weasel out of your deal.<eos> I did everything I could to keep it in place.
All good with the money.<eos> Just a little short on wheels. You...<eos> You don't have a car?<eos> License.<eos> When I came back from my last tour, I just never renewed it.
And I felt a connection with her from the very first moment that I booked the audition.<eos> I am the queen of every hive.<eos> I am the shield over every head.<eos> I am the spear of battle!<eos> Who but I am both the tree and the lightning that strikes it.
Every day at the same time, Agent Elizabeth Albee brings a drive with updated information to this location.<eos> I'm to steal her I.D. badge...<eos> So I can clone it and put a fake identity on top of it.<eos> And then you're gonna take this flash drive...<eos> Insert it into the server...
- Yours in particular.<eos> - They're getting stronger.<eos> It's like riding a choppy wave.<eos> Did you get the other magnet to Yo-Yo?<eos> Yes. She's got it.
Why did you call us, If only you can speak here?<eos> - The Mayor has the floor.<eos> - Wait for your turn.<eos> Listen, at the beginning we agreed, through a business plan, But who is suddenly vehement on the other hand? Who is it?<eos> After eight years we have worked out this development plan, - who flips it in a single day, who?
Uh, Chinese characters.<eos> They say, "Receive the Mandate of Heaven, and with it longevity and prosperity."<eos> So, assuming he had his hands on the genuine article,<eos> Rey was right: the green rock was worth a fortune.<eos> In fact, the Chinese emperor once traded it for 15 cities.
We got to get help.<eos> Who's gonna help us?<eos> We passed a radio tower on the way here.<eos> Okay.<eos> One of us has to go back, find it, get in contact with Citizen Z or Warren.
Eva!<eos> Did you see my messages?<eos> I forgot my sweater at your place.<eos> Yeah, I saw. I'll look for it.<eos> No, but I have to come get it at your place because I know what it looks like.
Did you see my messages?<eos> I forgot my sweater at your place.<eos> Yeah, I saw. I'll look for it.<eos> No, but I have to come get it at your place because I know what it looks like.<eos> Can't you just describe it?
- What was that?<eos> I had to bail. I can't be bothered with that stuff.<eos> What happened?<eos> She got us to go and feel eachother in a dark room.<eos> If you walked into a dick, you had to suck it.
I spread the canvas out a little wider, but I don't think we're gonna find anyone that saw anything.<eos> Department hasn't sent a car out this way for any vehicle fires.<eos> So no one saw him torch the van.<eos> It was raining the night of the murder.<eos> Probably not a lot of foot traffic out here if he ditched it after he shot Kenneth Tolan.
It struck me because of how deep it was.<eos> I asked, "Is a monster responsible for this?"<eos> Outside, I saw two young people.<eos> They were comforting each other with an affection inappropriate for the moment.<eos> Make sure to shoot the body bag if it comes out.
Wait.<eos> Here...<eos> Here's a good one.<eos> "Junky dies of an overdose."<eos> His friends are sad, but they still need to score, so they cut off his head and try selling it to satanists for 30 bucks.
Third is the door to his place.<eos> Unless I'm worried about noise, I'll use a bump key.<eos> What's a bump key?<eos> I keep a set. Teeth are all ground to a number nine.<eos> Key goes in up to the last tooth, then you "bump" tap it in the rest of the way.
- He killed them all...<eos> - You can't stop us.<eos> You can't stop what we're changing into.<eos> This planet is being destroyed by the human race, which lives only to suck the life from it. Like parasites.<eos> Only we can save it.
There's never been room for you, and that's my fault.<eos> And I'm so sorry.<eos> - You didn't do anything wrong. - And I know...<eos> I know that this is not the same at all, but I do know how it feels to keep a part of yourself shut off,<eos> to keep it inside.
- You need to come with me.<eos> - Not before we drain him.<eos> Well, I'm afraid Mr. O'Reilly isn't on the menu tonight.<eos> This planet doesn't take to kindly to parasites.<eos> This planet is dying, and we've been chosen to save it.
Are you sure?<eos> I've been ready to do this since the day I found out the truth about Clark Kent.<eos> This is who I am.<eos> I can't hide behind my camera anymore.<eos> If there's a cost, I'll pay it.
unconditional love.<eos> It's right there on the other side of the door.<eos> But you keep staring through the people as if you don't deserve it.<eos> I have a sledgehammer in my pocket.<eos> I will lift it up and bring it down...
But I'm making her movie.<eos> Oh, yeah? With whose money?<eos> Yours.<eos> Courtesy of that blank check.<eos> I'm cashing it, unless I can't trust you after all.
Then it can be anyone from the company.<eos> I don't get this computer thing.<eos> I stop using it, and it switches off.<eos> It's the screen saver.<eos> When I turn it on it doesn't work.
I don't get this computer thing.<eos> I stop using it, and it switches off.<eos> It's the screen saver.<eos> When I turn it on it doesn't work.<eos> Because then, you turn it off.
The sun can be a bitch.<eos> As you were.<eos> Will you go put some damn clothes on?<eos> I'm dressed.<eos> Uh-uh-uh, you take your narrow butt upstairs and put something on that covers it.
- Orders for what?<eos> To move him to another account.<eos> So you got the orders from above that Hans Peter is to go bankrupt.<eos> I tried to explain his case to management.<eos> I tried, I fought for it.
No one here can know about it.<eos> Is that a deal?<eos> - Deal. - Yes.<eos> The listening device?<eos> You need to deliver it personally.
Is that a deal?<eos> - Deal. - Yes.<eos> The listening device?<eos> You need to deliver it personally.<eos> Okay. Who's it for?
Lucy!<eos> That was awesome.<eos> Did you see that?<eos> How did you get the truck?<eos> I took it from The Man.
Answer the question, please.<eos> He wanted to know if I--<eos> He wanted to know about the film, the one I gave to Joe.<eos> What about it?<eos> He wanted to know if I'd watched it.
He wanted to know if I'd watched it.<eos> And?<eos> Am I under arrest?<eos> Just answer the question.<eos> Yes. I watched it.
-Right.<eos> -And then you... you quickly learn, as you grow up, that you're a small fraction of an opinion or a palate, so we started creating systems and, like, having all of our baristas at our different stores score these same coffees.<eos> -Right. -And that way, we could turn around and actually have blind assessments of...<eos> Hey, this is, you know... seven... Seventeen people said this coffee was terrible.<eos> -[Jeff] Sure, sure. -And then I said it was great.
You're not their brother, no matter what they call you.<eos> If you're looking for a family, you've got two of us: Jules and me.<eos> Fine.<eos> But take your share. I don't want it.<eos> I'm not going to need it.
Blackstone pops right out the door like the guy had signaled him.<eos> That's when I put one in his chest.<eos> So, you killed him?<eos> Well, he took a kill shot, for sure.<eos> I brought you this drive, if you still want it.
It's a system that allows us to take a low voltage and turn it into a really high voltage.<eos> Yes.<eos> That's what I wanted to hear.<eos> Nikola Tesla gave the coil its name.<eos> The Serbian-American invented it in 1891.
I think what we're talking about here is personal responsibility.<eos> Have you guys talked about the male gaze?<eos> Can you see my gaze?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, I see it.
- I already listened.<eos> - Now I get to talk.<eos> I've had my heart stomped on too.<eos> And I don't have any kids, but I'm pretty good with them.<eos> And my job beats me down on a regular basis, but, like you, I love it.
Cos if you work for Homeland Security... No, what's it called here?<eos> Border Force? ...<eos> Border Force, you open the doors and, "Well, there you are."<eos> So I was thinking, surely there must be a better way of getting into Britain?<eos> And I think I've worked it out.
-There's no weighbridge. -No! -They haven't thought of that.<eos> I'd knock a star off.<eos> I shall build one.<eos> I shall build a weighbridge, and then you shall see.<eos> -That could have been a really useful and interesting test, and you've ruined it.
I'll get the forms, there can't be many.<eos> The time comes...<eos> Ssh! The time, I think, comes when you stop wanting to be an idiot.<eos> That's the time when you've done enough. - I know what you mean.<eos> - No, actually, you are right, cos I think it's the moment where you go into a big department store, and you go into the kitchenware section, and you see a tea cosy, but you don't put it on your head.
Do you have any idea how difficult it is to fit a V8 to a beach buggy?<eos> - Well, it doesn't fit! - It's obviously impossible.<eos> Exactly, it's impossible.<eos> This is no ordinary V8.<eos> It started out in life as a 3.5 litre V8 from a Range Rover, but I've modified it, so it produces 180 horsepower.
Oh, problem.<eos> Oh, God.<eos> It is still moving.<eos> Many miles ahead, we'd pulled over for a break from the endless bumps, and James was being very interesting!<eos> The good thing about this hat is you can angle it, like a heliostat, to where the sun's coming from.
- The dog, its throat's been cut.<eos> - Is it yours?<eos> - Yes.<eos> I put the body out of sight.<eos> No need for burial, animals will clean it.
I don't know.<eos> My parents freaked out, but not me.<eos> I held the violin, and it felt like an old friend.<eos> There's always a part of us we don't know.<eos> Suddenly, we discover it and say...
You kiss your mother with that mouth?<eos> Here you go.<eos> Shall we toast?<eos> To Howard and Bernadette, and the house key they never asked me to return.<eos> You said you got it back.
Beerios.<eos> Hey, what did you think of Billy's truck?<eos> Piece of crap.<eos> I know, right?<eos> We should buy it.
Colt, if you want this junker so bad, you have to buy her by yourself.<eos> What?<eos> All right, look, Billy... you know I love this truck.<eos> My brother here is not too fond of it, so you're gonna have to cut a little off the price.<eos> Dude, you give it away for free, I still don't want it.
This is awesome!<eos> We are so buying this truck!<eos> Yeah, boy!<eos> Get some! Get some!<eos> Yeah, make it dirty!
There you go.<eos> That's how you break up with your imaginary girlfriend.<eos> Hey, Dad, you see this storm?<eos> Looks pretty crazy.<eos> Of course I saw it.
Maybe we're cursed.<eos> I... The first time we met, you broke my nose in fourth grade dodgeball.<eos> Remember?<eos> How could I forget?<eos> The ball bounced off your face and then Dennis Harvey caught it and I was out.
Now I get why this bothers you.<eos> Now I get why you enjoy it.<eos> Well, I got all that fence in the barn.<eos> In the barn?<eos> Thought you were gonna put it up.
And in a perfect world, both.<eos> You put that snow fence back up?<eos> Oh, did you say "put it up"?<eos> We thought you said "fuck it up," so we did that.<eos> Yeah, we also moved that feed trough to where you wanted it.
I just don't want you to blow up your whole life to be with me, and then realize you made, like, a... big mistake.<eos> It's not a mistake.<eos> You're the one for me.<eos> And you can keep the TV.<eos> You can put it in the guest room or something. You can watch your Deadliest Ax Man.
Oh, honey, I'm so proud of you.<eos> You're making a smart move.<eos> I'm not gonna take it.<eos> You're a fucking idiot.<eos> Yeah, Mary says I should take it, too.
Look, I think your father really believes what he says, but eventually he just goes back to the way he's always been.<eos> Remember that Christmas we bought him that John Wayne DVD collection and he just used it as bookends for his John Wayne VHS collection?<eos> Yeah, it's like that year we got him his first computer.<eos> He left it in the box for six months, and then used it as a desk for his typewriter.<eos> I think you should at least consider the job with Ed, not dismiss it because of some vague promises your father made.
Where'd you get the idea this is our ranch?<eos> I mean, that's the plan, right?<eos> Dad's gonna step aside and you and me, we're gonna run it together.<eos> Dude, Dad wouldn't step aside for a charging bull.<eos> He'd just stare at it, touch his mustache and be like,
You know, hanging out with babies is kind of like hanging out with drunk people. They babble incoherently, cry till they get another bottle, and shit themselves.<eos> Oh, and thank you...<eos> I'm sorry. I forgot your name.<eos> Oh, it's, uh, Umberto.<eos> And you can remember it because it's like...
Why?<eos> You saw these people find safety for the first time in years.<eos> Maybe ever.<eos> You created that original vaccine for a reason.<eos> I was chosen to receive it for a reason.
The control of a human.<eos> The power of a Z.<eos> That's me.<eos> That's my legacy.<eos> I need to make more booster for me and more vaccine for them to finish the plan. Bring it to completion.
Who was?<eos> This is what I managed to put together so far.<eos> - Aaron's on this list.<eos> - I know. I had to put down everyone's name who had security clearance that would allow them to know the file even existed.<eos> Emily, I think there's a traitor in the White House, and I need you to help me find out who it is.
Watch yourself.<eos> Come in, Cássia.<eos> Oh, it's you.<eos> The next test just started.<eos> May I watch it with you?
Your birthday present.<eos> -You already got me a present.<eos> -This one isn't from me.<eos> When your parents left me to take care of you, they gave me this letter.<eos> They told me to give it to you on your 20th birthday.
And if it's left up to me, this will never happen again.<eos> Tell that to the Council.<eos> Do you have more?<eos> But I have a ring.<eos> Do you want it?
Do you have more?<eos> But I have a ring.<eos> Do you want it?<eos> It's a magic ring.<eos> You want it?
Do you know what's inside?<eos> What?<eos> All of your mom's memories.<eos> Really?<eos> You can only have it on the other side.
Can you tell us what you meant?<eos> It might be nothing.<eos> But I saw he was murdered.<eos> And you know what the news always says-- see something, say something.<eos> He always had a laptop with him, but he never used it in here.
It might be nothing.<eos> But I saw he was murdered.<eos> And you know what the news always says-- see something, say something.<eos> He always had a laptop with him, but he never used it in here.<eos> After he'd eat, he'd take it out there to the parking lot.
I'm just like you, though.<eos> I get angry and then... boom.<eos> I just explode.<eos> The IED was triggered by a modified cell phone.<eos> It could have been detonated from anywhere by a text.
- No.<eos> This is not just a possession.<eos> - But they have the right to know.<eos> - This is a revenge. Can you not see that?<eos> Four decades ago, it had Regan's body and it lost it.
I used to, uh, think that-that you got off easy, that I had to live it and you just had to watch.<eos> But... now, uh, now... I don't know.<eos> Uh, seems like it's... almost as bad than watching and waiting.<eos> 'Cause you see her pain.<eos> And there's not a hell of a thing you can do to take it from her.
What happened in that room... I can't... remember.<eos> So that your child may be born again!<eos> Help me.<eos> Mother Bernadette!<eos> Four decades ago, it had Regan's body and it lost it.
Not yet.<eos> Just kill me.<eos> Just kill me.<eos> Come on. Most men fight death, but not you.<eos> You want it. Hmm?
We were loyal and perfect in every way. And do you know what God did?<eos> God got bored.<eos> He got bored with our perfection.<eos> So He created Man, mortal and ugly, and... and then<eos> He built them a sandbox, and He filled it with tangible and sensual delights.
They need to see you.<eos> A new Emperor needs to be in Rome.<eos> I promised my father I would finish the war.<eos> Those generals, they know it. And they will use it against me at every opportunity.<eos> So finish it.
The Minetta Chess Club Slaying.<eos> Greenwich Village, 1938.<eos> The table was from the scene.<eos> Took me, um...<eos> Took me a few years to track it down.
No, it's just as well.<eos> Because, I mean, my progress was very slow, so...<eos> this is going to force me to look at the case another way.<eos> It's an even more appropriate gift than you intended, because I destroyed evidence for you, and now...<eos> I would offer to break it in with you, but, uh, I have to go.
It was dark, it happened fast.<eos> I think... I was staring more at the gun than at the guy.<eos> According to the emergency room report, they also removed some auto glass from your shoulder?<eos> Yeah, car window, uh, broke when he shot me, there was-- there was glass everywhere.<eos> And the police subsequently looked for the car but couldn't find it.
I can't tell you anything more about it.<eos> I saw the plane hit the building.<eos> It changed everything.<eos> [George W. Bush] From this day forward... any nation that continues to harbor or support terrorism will be regarded by the United States as a hostile regime.<eos> The only way to defeat terrorism as a threat to our way of life is to stop it, eliminate it and destroy it where it grows.
And I'm like, "Look, we need to get us a block."<eos> The Muslims, they took L-6, and they had control.<eos> The Aryan Brotherhood, we ended up going to L-2.<eos> This is our block.<eos> We're taking it over.
- to brush up on the four B's.<eos> Basket, blower, balloon, and first up, the burner.<eos> -Okay, so this is a modern day burner.<eos> -This is current technology.<eos> We're pulling the fuel out of the tank as a liquid, and we're vaporizing it in these coils before we shoot it through this jet ring past this pilot light.
-Should we light both?<eos> -No.<eos> But that's only half the story.<eos> When you're inflating a hot air balloon, you can't just blow hot air into the empty envelope?<eos> You fill it with cold air first, which we do with this purpose-built fan.
I've had a taste of flying.<eos> Now for the real challenge.<eos> To freedom!<eos> To rebuild that freedom balloon using the exact same specs and materials as the original.<eos> This is the actual balloon, and what's even better is I have one of the guys who made it on the line.
Now, it's amazing that you were able to build a hot air balloon from scratch, but what's even crazier to me is that you knew nothing about them, right?<eos> We knew nothing at all.<eos> Of course, I completely underestimated the challenge at the time.<eos> Seems like we're in the same boat, or basket.<eos> If you build it, they will be free.
And their backyard burner.<eos> But at 140,000 cubic feet, their giant canopy required an industrial-sized fan.<eos> -Look what I got.<eos> The architect of the escape was Günter Wetzel.<eos> I took out the engine from my motorbike, tweaked and adjusted it, and that became the air blower.
El Chapo's escape was meticulously planned, but when it comes to jailbreaks, Latin America can be a place where they say "no" to months of meticulous planning, and "yes" to just going for it.<eos> Example number one, this is Maria.<eos> She's on her way to visit her husband, Juan, in Mexico's Chetumal Prison.<eos> On the way out, the guards notice that her suitcase is just a little bit fatter. - No.<eos> - They unzip it.
Which is where his plan quickly unravels.<eos> It's a classic case of wardrobe malfunction.<eos> And even though this humble escape ended in failure...<eos> I am all woman.<eos> it surely has to go down as one of the all-time great attempts.
A little bit of both.<eos> He was crazy in the sense that the idea was to put a pigeon into a missile so that it can guide it to a ship and blow it up.<eos> Putting a pigeon in a bomb is definitely nuts, not to mention immoral.<eos> But in theory, it might have worked.<eos> One pigeon pecks the ball as it comes toward him and knocks it toward the other.
Now, this I have to see for myself.<eos> Go get 'em.<eos> Private Pigeon in basic training.<eos> No pigeons will be harmed in the making of White Rabbit Project.<eos> First, you have to familiarize the bird with the box, acclimate it, and we do that by putting it in the box, give it some food to eat, and they start associating the box with the food, so it's a nice place.
It was good for postage.<eos> You'd take this to the post office, exchange for a stamp, and they can mail the letter back to you in the US.<eos> Now, Carlo realized quickly that the coupons not only could be exchanged for stamps, but they could also be sold for cash.<eos> Now, he could buy a coupon in Italy, for let's say, a dollar.<eos> He'd ship it to the United States and sell it for, say, $6.
The explanation is far more sinister.<eos> It's the opening gambit of a group of cybercriminals called... the Carbanak Gang.<eos> You see... this was no lucky passerby.<eos> This is a mule.<eos> The Carbanak Gang has taken remote control of the machines... and commanded it to pay out at a predetermined time.
There's a lot of sophisticated technology that goes into it.<eos> The ink has to survive being vaporized, fired at 30 miles per hour through a nozzle a third the size of a human hair, at 300 degrees.<eos> Three hundred degrees.<eos> Now, that gives me an idea.<eos> Instead of filling this printer with ink, why not inject it with three ink-dyed accelerants?
That flight around the Statue of Liberty was no trick.<eos> That was 100 percent real.<eos> For half a century, people have been asking,<eos> "Where's my jetpack?"<eos> I believe that, finally, that day is so close we can almost touch it.
Hashtag "selfie Saturday"!<eos> Brilliant.<eos> We got promised jetpacks.<eos> We got the selfie stick.<eos> So, the million dollar question, which was the original selfie stick, who invented it and when?
And that patent is 1985.<eos> That's 20 years earlier.<eos> It was the work of this guy, Hiroshi Ueda.<eos> He was a keen photographer who worked as an engineer for camera company Minolta.<eos> He invented it after he asked someone to take a photo of him outside the Louvre.
AC/DC.<eos> Metal, baby!<eos> Now, Cahill's dream was to create an electronic music machine capable of mimicking the sound of an entire orchestra with sufficient resonance to be played over a small telephone speaker and fill a room with sound.<eos> So, he started experimenting with cogs and magnets.<eos> If you take a cog wheel like this sprocket right here with all these teeth, and you spin it... and you take an electrical pickup, and you bring it close to it... you'll get... a tone.
Use alen, the Somali substitute for tea.<eos> It's fibrous and turns the water brown, but I'm sure it's not related to the tea plant.<eos> Add a little sugar.<eos> Find a chair outside.<eos> The guards will have used it overnight.
I never talk business without something to eat.<eos> Go on. We need... we need the Birthstone.<eos> The Birthstone of Gunmar.<eos> Very powerful.<eos> Why should I give it to you?
Very powerful.<eos> Why should I give it to you?<eos> Because we are going to destroy him.<eos> Why do I care?<eos> Why should I give it to you?
Why won't the shadow staff make a portal?<eos> Slow down, young one.<eos> You must learn to empower the staff itself.<eos> Focus, imbue it with your will.
- Which one is the small one?<eos> - Hard to tell, huh?<eos> They are bred for combat. Trained to kill.<eos> Thank you for that.<eos> Grab it! Grab it!
Stay on the Gorb!<eos> Aaarrrgghh!<eos> - Cool.<eos> - A warrior's shield!<eos> You've earned it.
Aaarrrgghh!<eos> - Cool.<eos> - A warrior's shield!<eos> You've earned it.<eos> Now, test it!
Gunmar betrayed him in hopes of taking his army as his own.<eos> The battle lasted weeks.<eos> Gunmar lost an eye. Orlagk lost his head.<eos> I fear this may be the most difficult Triumbric stone to find.<eos> For if his dark servants worked so hard to steal it from the Krubera, they would not hand it over so easily.
Hmm... hmm... Barbara, you do have to leave!<eos> It's...<eos> - The basement!<eos> - What's in the basement?<eos> Draal was supposed to guard it.
- What? - Fuck you!<eos> - That's nice. - Very unhelpful!<eos> You're gonna take-- You're gonna take their fuckin' side on this!<eos> Why don't you just go back to New York, and re-master the film?<eos> - Okay? - The post house is holding it hostage.
Same with your pancakes, Herman.<eos> They drive me crazy!<eos> Not that long a drive, Ernie, but thanks.<eos> I'm taking this biscuit with me.<eos> I love it.
They drive me crazy!<eos> Not that long a drive, Ernie, but thanks.<eos> I'm taking this biscuit with me.<eos> I love it.<eos> - Why don't you marry it? - [all laugh]
You get us a nice, fat snake, I'd grub on that.<eos> Snake's good meat.<eos> I ain't eating no damn ant.<eos> Well, suit yourself.<eos> And when you're finished, chew the flowers into a poultice and wipe it on the cut with a rubber.
You do know what happens to us now, right?<eos> Yes.<eos> It's just our turn.<eos> Demidov, you asked for the autopsy report.<eos> - I was forbidden to show it to you.
Shoot.<eos> What is that?<eos> I just lost an earring behind the washing machine.<eos> That's a bummer, honey.<eos> I'll go look for it.
You're all I've got, so let's do it.<eos> Everybody gets a GPS tracker.<eos> This is gonna tell us where you are, anytime... in case anything gets weird.<eos> What am I supposed to do with this?<eos> Just put it in your pocket.
The Blob.<eos> The original one with Steve McQueen.<eos> I can't believe you don't know that movie.<eos> Come over to my house.<eos> I got it on LaserDisc.
I was your best friend, and you turned your back on me.<eos> Locked me up, imprisoned me in the pages of a book.<eos> You stuck me on a shelf for years and years.<eos> The key was right there.<eos> And you never used it.
It's leaking... it's been leaking for two weeks.<eos> The refrigerator's leaking.<eos> Please don't do that thing where you repeat part of what I said so I'll think you're paying attention.<eos> I'm not doing anything. The refrigerator's leaking, I didn't notice.<eos> Can't you just fix it?
You know what? I should go.<eos> Yeah, yeah, I'm gonna go.<eos> No, no, no, wait.<eos> I have another letter here for you.<eos> Put it in the mail.
I hope you don't mind the music.<eos> When you're by yourself, sometimes the last thing you want to listen to is silence.<eos> Do you like your new computer?<eos> I'm not very familiar with them, but the man at the store said that he thought that was the right one for you.<eos> I haven't turned it on.
- Gilcrest.<eos> - Have you done the job?<eos> - Did you bleach the hack?<eos> Is it gone? - Reversing the panic code.<eos> Pinging it through the first transponder, then out back through the system.
I can see that.<eos> Well, I figure, whatever happens, it's got to be better than this.<eos> (SOLDIERS CHANTING IN THE DISTANCE)<eos> So many of us have died to get here.<eos> I want you to know, Kyle, if there was another way, I would have taken it.
Alternate timelines are not complicated.<eos> It's merely a matter of tracking possible futures using an exponential growth and decay algorithm.<eos> KYLE:<eos> Right.<eos> There is a switch, and I will find it.
Sir, a squall on the starboard bow.<eos> We must shorten sail immediately.<eos> Not just yet, Mr. Chase.<eos> Sir, we are headed into a squall at more than 8 knots, and it's moving faster than that.<eos> Let it come.
So it was decided.<eos> We prepared the body.<eos> We removed the organs. Separated his limbs from his body and cut all the flesh from the bones.<eos> After which, we closed the body<eos> and we sewed it up as decently as we could and committed it to the sea.
Captain Pollard's conscience was clear.<eos> But the inquiry was a sham.<eos> Pollard went out again,<eos> looking for the white whale.<eos> He never found it.

Fuck that, Jerry.<eos> That's what the song is about.<eos> Relax, relax.<eos> We're not giving in to anything.<eos> I just say we retire it for now.
Before we got here, you took off your wedding ring?<eos> No, I didn't, Rusty.<eos> It was loose.<eos> You remember how loose it was?<eos> And I must've just dropped it somewhere.
It was not my pl...<eos> Okay.<eos> Yes, Stone is an impressive man, okay?<eos> But I married you, Rusty.<eos> And I am so sorry that I lost my ring... but I would never, ever, ever take it off on purpose.
We've all done very well.<eos> Why don't you just stick with stocks? Look.<eos> You know me.<eos> I, I, I...<eos> I look for value wherever it can be found.
Corporate doesn't care.<eos> These people just want homes.<eos> And they go with the flow.<eos> - Good for you. - Your companies don't verify?<eos> If I write a loan on Friday afternoon, a big bank will buy it by Monday lunch.
I couldn't help him.<eos> I get him out of the wagon. He's grabbing for the door, so we get into it.<eos> Pulls out a knife. Swinging at me weakly.<eos> That's when I took out my gun.<eos> Soon as he saw it, he gave up.
They underestimated him.<eos> The next mistake I hold you accountable.<eos> CAINE:<eos> What are you doing?<eos> I want the owner of this car to know who borrowed it.
Excellent product, sire.<eos> Premium grade.<eos> It's a, um, particularly robust stock.<eos> Assuming market stability, if we harvest later this century profit margins should eclipse your nearest competitor.<eos> BALEM: Understand this, Mr. Night. I will harvest that planet tomorrow before I let her take it from me.
So you're the new guy.<eos> We've actually met before.<eos> A long time ago.<eos> You see that cornerstone?<eos> I watched them lay it in when this was nothing more than a cornfield.
Whatever the killers wanted to know, he would have told them.<eos> But the question remains, what did they want to know?<eos> He isn't getting up.<eos> Not unless we could break the curse.<eos> And the only way to do that is to kill the witch who cast it.
We might be engaged, but I'm my own woman.<eos> Besides, I wouldn't be wearing my engagement ring.<eos> Remember?<eos> It's only just been stolen.<eos> Your fiance would have gone out first thing in the morning to replace it.
- Good morning.<eos> SOLO:<eos> Morning.<eos> Your tracker's not sending a signal.<eos> Have you turned it on?
Yeah, Kathy and Kikki went to the market and Ellis went for a... for a run.<eos> - Well, okay. - You have a bug in your hair.<eos> - It's all right, it's a... - What it is? It's a ladybug.<eos> They say they're good luck.<eos> Did you get it?
Stepsisters, have asked for parasols and lace.<eos> What will you have?<eos> Bring me the first branch your shoulder brushes on your journey.<eos> That's a curious request.<eos> Well, you'll have to take it with you on your way and think of me when you look at it.

You know, I saw you and Madison.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - You were at my special place.<eos> You know, that's my Think Rock.<eos> You said I could use it.
And you are cheating death.<eos> Go on, take your clothes off.<eos> I have a clumsy, unattractive body.<eos> It's not unattractive.<eos> I have seen it.

His dad used to force Ned to be on the team.<eos> Back when he was trying to mold him into a new Chaz Jr.<eos> And so Ned finds himself out there, deep left, last inning, last game.<eos> And I'm on the mound and I serve up this meatball.<eos> And the kid hits the snot out of it.
And I remember looking out into the outfield grass and Ned's still there, just looking for his glasses.<eos> That's the thing.<eos> He didn't...<eos> He never got a chance.<eos> It's not like he dropped it.
- I didn't mean that.<eos> Sorry.<eos> - Class act, this guy.<eos> - It's not going to get better, so just...<eos> I'm going to take a key. I'm going to stick it in my mouth, and I'm going to turn it and I'm going to lock it.
Deon, Tetravaal is very happy with you.<eos> The Scouts are a huge success.<eos> Ma'am, look, it won't cost you anything.<eos> A droid downstairs was written off yesterday, smashed beyond repair.<eos> Let me install this on it.
I think that's it.<eos> Can you move it? Try it.<eos> Try. Try and move your arm.<eos> - There we go. It's working.<eos> - I move it.
- Put that down. It's illegal!<eos> - I'm gonna take it!<eos> - Chappie.<eos> Chappie, wait!<eos> - I'm taking it!
And what's a school boy like you doing out here, Lawrence?<eos> Ahh.. this particular school boy has a PhD in archaeology.<eos> Thompson eh...<eos> I have a PhD in medieval pottery shards. It follows me around like the wafting of an old spinster's fart.<eos> How I long to be rid of it!
- That's incredible.<eos> He broke ranks, I mean...<eos> when did Gallet write that letter?<eos> - 1984.<eos> - And Law just ignored it.
I won't commit my people to a ground assault just to pillage weapons.<eos> Commander Paylor, your people have suffered more than just about anyone else at the hands of The Capitol.<eos> Which is why I won't condone a mass suicide.<eos> If we don't take District 2, we won't get into The Capitol.<eos> Would it be enough to disable the fortress... instead of taking it?
Kill him!<eos> I'll say this for you, Katniss.<eos> You don't disappoint.<eos> Well, Plutarch gave me a letter for you.<eos> I don't want it.
How may I help you?<eos> - She has a pin.<eos> She has a pin.<eos> I saw that you were looking for one online...<eos> - Where did you get it?
She has a pin.<eos> I saw that you were looking for one online...<eos> - Where did you get it?<eos> - What can you tell me about it?<eos> I can't tell you anything about it unless you tell me who gave it to you.
To save civilization, I would show its collapse.<eos> But how do you think this vision was received?<eos> How do you think people responded to the prospect of imminent doom?<eos> They gobbled it up, like a chocolate éclair.<eos> They didn't fear their demise, they repackaged it.
We're not walking.<eos> We're taking the train of thought!<eos> The train, of course!<eos> That is so much faster!<eos> But how do we catch it?
You're shooting in the garden?<eos> You're crazy! It's dangerous!<eos> They started it, those bastards!<eos> The fence is useless?<eos> They ate it!
Maria.<eos> Rose is asleep.<eos> Don't wake her till the morning.<eos> Load the bodies from Danny's into Michael's limousine.<eos> Dump the car where the cops can find it.
I thought you said you haven't seen it.<eos> Busted.<eos> What a dick.<eos> Look, all I know is if I busted out a quote at a party, some drunk chick would always come up to me and be like,<eos> "Oh, my god. I love that movie. I haven't seen it in, like, forever."
What a dick.<eos> Look, all I know is if I busted out a quote at a party, some drunk chick would always come up to me and be like,<eos> "Oh, my god. I love that movie. I haven't seen it in, like, forever."<eos> And I'd be like, "oh, my god. I have it on DVD in my dorm room."<eos> And she'd be like, "we should totally watch it."
And I'd be like, "oh, my god. I have it on DVD in my dorm room."<eos> And she'd be like, "we should totally watch it."<eos> Dude, it was so easy. It was like stealing pussy from a baby.<eos> You disgust me.<eos> Come on, you totally would've watched it.
We do not know, sir.<eos> What?<eos> This is number one disaster!<eos> His message must not reach the Gorg.<eos> This planet was hard to find, and I will not abandon it!
No wonder they've been chasing you.<eos> Not "they," "he."<eos> Apparently, that Gorg is last Gorg.<eos> That is why rock was so important.<eos> Without it, he was alonely... and would someday be extinctly... which made Gorg cranky and irrational... and physically violent.
Let's walk on the tips of our toes.<eos> Will you stop playing that tiny piano?<eos> You're gonna get us caught.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Now just reach over and grab it.
Activation in 3. 2. 1.<eos> This is it, boys.<eos> Things do not look good for you. Oh.<eos> And I'm keeping the bear.<eos> You're not going to need it in where you're going.
It's the way I am.<eos> When you said "negotiate," what did you mean?<eos> I already have a contract prepared.<eos> It's fairly detailed.<eos> You would review it, and we would negotiate what you are and are not willing to try.
No, no, I-I can set it up.<eos> She's just in a meeting.<eos> Something I can help you with?<eos> Yes, Jules spilled soy sauce on her Saint Laurent jacket.<eos> Can you take it to the photo studio? There's lots of cleaners and stuff in there. Sure.
Something I can help you with?<eos> Yes, Jules spilled soy sauce on her Saint Laurent jacket.<eos> Can you take it to the photo studio? There's lots of cleaners and stuff in there. Sure.<eos> Where is it?<eos> She's wearing it.
Is that all dry-cleaning?<eos> These three are. These two are laundry. And this button...<eos> I mean, it's loose, so... - Okay.<eos> - If they could just...<eos> - You got it.
Have you found the computer?<eos> It's not down here.<eos> Lewis, go in there.<eos> - Found it!<eos> - Got it!
Yes.<eos> Of course.<eos> So every year someone will win the Rose Lacey Trophy?<eos> Yeah, every year, as long as there's a golf club.<eos> And I think she'd like you to come along and present it to the first winner.
Lane had a ledger.<eos> It contained the identities of his operatives, his terrorist associates, the entire inner workings of the Syndicate.<eos> One of his agents stole it, hoping to blackmail him, and kept it in a secure computer facility for safekeeping.<eos> He died being interrogated for the access code, leaving Lane with a serious problem.<eos> So the key to crushing Lane is sitting in a computer, just waiting for someone to take it.

Do you know who I am?<eos> We know you created the Syndicate.<eos> But Lane went rogue and turned it against you, didn't he?<eos> And you've been desperately trying to cover it up.<eos> That's why you erased the disk when she brought it to you.
I have a game for you.<eos> I'll give you $50 million to let Benji go.<eos> Where is the disk?<eos> Where is the disk?<eos> You're looking at it.
Yeah, you know, I don't like that name.<eos> I know, but why do they call you that?<eos> Oh, my dad just started calling me that.<eos> And?<eos> And I don't like it.
- What do you mean, you don't know?<eos> - I mean, I don't know.<eos> - That doesn't make any sense.<eos> - I didn't say it would.<eos> Wine is supposed to mature with age... but I think 450 years may make it bitter.
Please, may I...<eos> May I...<eos> Come back, come back, come back.<eos> But, you know, the suit can take the weight, right?<eos> So I take the tank, fly it right up to the general's palace, drop it at his feet.
Be it ever so humble.<eos> You find a place in Brooklyn yet?<eos> I don't think I can afford a place in Brooklyn.<eos> Well, home is home, you know?<eos> I fly right up to the general's palace, I drop it at his feet,
He's uploading himself into the body.<eos> Where?<eos> The real power is inside the Cradle.<eos> The gem, its power is uncontainable.<eos> You can't just blow it up.
The real power is inside the Cradle.<eos> The gem, its power is uncontainable.<eos> You can't just blow it up.<eos> You have to get the Cradle to Stark.<eos> First, I have to find it.
Even I can tell the air is getting thin.<eos> You guys get to the boats.<eos> I'll sweep for stragglers. Be right behind you.<eos> - What about the core?<eos> - I'll protect it.
It was in horrible shape.<eos> He had to kill it.<eos> What?<eos> How did you not tell us this, like, immediately?<eos> You killed it with, like, what?
-Right here, right here.<eos> What the hell?<eos> Turn them on!<eos> What the hell is that?<eos> - Open it.
One, three, four, five.<eos> - Come on, hurry.<eos> -Wait, is it...<eos> It's pi. Duh.<eos> Put it, put it, put it.
Look at those eyes.<eos> I tell you...<eos> You are a star.<eos> Of course the boot's not too small.<eos> You're just not putting it on right!
Maybe your dreams are on hold right now.<eos> No?<eos> That's a nice way of putting it.<eos> This song is going to be in the town musical.<eos> We should sing it together.
Now, this is where it gets complicated.<eos> There's a clip that connects the sleeve to the...<eos> I don't even know what to call it.<eos> The "cup." Which is connected to the mop head.<eos> So, when you pull up on the sleeve, the mop head stretches... so you can wring it without ever touching it with your hands.
I really like it.<eos> Can we buy it?<eos> Take it easy, Cristy.<eos> Wow. I mean, that's just amazing.<eos> You really don't have to touch it.
Wow. I mean, that's just amazing.<eos> You really don't have to touch it.<eos> Look at that.<eos> You know what would make this perfect... if you could remove the mop head, put it in the washing machine...<eos> - Really get it clean.
We don't have regular people.<eos> We have celebrities or spokesmodels do the selling.<eos> I told you this.<eos> Who showed you the mop?<eos> Who sold it to you? Who taught you how to use it?
We have celebrities or spokesmodels do the selling.<eos> I told you this.<eos> Who showed you the mop?<eos> Who sold it to you? Who taught you how to use it?<eos> And who convinced you that it was great after you thought it was worthless?
You're still full of surprises.<eos> Good ol' Charlie Brown!<eos> Charlie Brown.<eos> Oh, Charlie Brown.<eos> I'll hold the football and you kick it.
Good ol' Charlie Brown!<eos> Charlie Brown.<eos> Oh, Charlie Brown.<eos> I'll hold the football and you kick it.<eos> You say you'll hold it, but what you really mean is... you'll pull it away, and I'll land on my back and I'll kill myself.
I don't know.<eos> It's sitting in my house.<eos> I've never seen any of this before.<eos> I mean, this box?<eos> I've never seen it before, Mike.
Get back!<eos> Get back into the circle!<eos> Where is it?<eos> Get back!<eos> I see it!
One team will go out onto the field to play defense while the other team will take turns hitting this ball... with a stickie.<eos> What are you gonna call this game?<eos> What else?<eos> Stickie McSchnickens.<eos> Now your goal, ball thrower, is to get the ball past me two times without my hitting it.
What else?<eos> Stickie McSchnickens.<eos> Now your goal, ball thrower, is to get the ball past me two times without my hitting it.<eos> Fire when ready.<eos> I didn't know you were going to toss it quite so hard, ball thrower.
Come on, Ramon!<eos> Right behind you, Tommy!<eos> Hurry up, Burro!<eos> Move your ass!<eos> Yeah, I think we found it.
He burns 'em both alive.<eos> You want Buddy out?<eos> There's only one way to do it.<eos> You see that mountain?<eos> They're gonna take it down to get the silver out.
You want Buddy out?<eos> There's only one way to do it.<eos> You see that mountain?<eos> They're gonna take it down to get the silver out.<eos> They're gonna tunnel in, they're gonna blow it up from the inside out.
The thing is I kind of...<eos> I kind of don't know how to spell your name.<eos> It's a hard name to spell, Buddy.<eos> Most people can't.<eos> Let me write it down for you.
What's a job for, Buddy?<eos> What?<eos> It's for the family.<eos> Hand me your wallet.<eos> Just give it to me.
Just give it to me.<eos> Remember this?<eos> Jakey's share.<eos> From your first job.<eos> He kept it?
You know, Jess didn't feel very safe.<eos> I bought her this backpack, hoping that she would use it.<eos> It's called an iSafe backpack.<eos> You can pull an alarm.<eos> she wouldn't use it.
Best man in town if you're feeling poorly.<eos> I've heard so much about you from Mother and my sister.<eos> Although, I must confess, I had a little trouble understanding your title.<eos> "Baronet."<eos> Edith kindly explained it to me.
She's just a child, Thomas.<eos> Lucille, I've explained all this.<eos> I will need the ring.<eos> The ring's mine.<eos> I earned it.
Lucille, I've explained all this.<eos> I will need the ring.<eos> The ring's mine.<eos> I earned it.<eos> I will want it back.
I earned it.<eos> I will want it back.<eos> Then you'd better hope I'm successful.<eos> This is the last thing we have to sell.<eos> You're not selling it.
Then, should you still feel you need them, I'll have copies made.<eos> Come on, Edith, come with me.<eos> Let's take you upstairs.<eos> I thought you said the dog was dead.<eos> I left it out there on its own.
Two of the guests have made themselves useful at the local expats club.<eos> Which is, shall we say, a little down on its uppers.<eos> Norman I know the membership's dropping, times are tight, but do you really have to water down the wine?<eos> What?<eos> I uncorked it myself.
His ears are too close to his head.<eos> I hoped you would find his offer of a partnership more attractive.<eos> But that is up to you.<eos> Have you seen my other shoe, darling?<eos> If you don't tell me what's been the problem for the last few days, I'll need it to kick you with.
-it's slightly above average.<eos> Yeah?<eos> You gotta stake your claim, James.<eos> Yes!<eos> You gotta stake it!
-Don't hit a woman!<eos> - Gonna knock your ass out!<eos> -Don't hit a woman!<eos> [IN FEMININE VOICE] You don't want my pocket.<eos> You don't want it.
There's a lot of them.<eos> JAMES:<eos> Yeah.<eos> There's the computer.<eos> I see it.
Oh, my God!<eos> I'm gonna fall off the building.<eos> Your name is Toby!<eos> You're going to learn to say your name.<eos> Let me hear you say it.
This is perfect, We're gonna get to the city before 10:00.<eos> Hey, Sam, how's your boring salad?<eos> Mmm, it's actually delicious.<eos> Everybody always says that about their salad. They're all a bunch of fucking liars.<eos> No, I love it.
Hey!<eos> Where the hell's my coffee?<eos> I've been waiting for 10 minutes.<eos> I'm so sorry, sir, I forgot.<eos> I'll get it right away.
Yes.<eos> Synne, you wanted to say something?<eos> Yes.<eos> All medical journals are to be destroyed or filed by me.<eos> We only have time to locate the shit, tag it, and leave.
Yes.<eos> You always were a small man, Antoine.<eos> A derivitive thinker, at best.<eos> This desperation suits you.<eos> The key to everything... is in your mind, and you're going to give it to me.
That's right.<eos> It's a rock band.<eos> I could write you a song, if you like. I can do it right now.<eos> You got a sexy ass<eos> I want to lick it, lick my ass
- Just keep your energy, mate.<eos> - Helen.<eos> Once you catch a break, you move, you know the drill.<eos> We've got a stash of oxygen on the South Col.<eos> Whoever needs it can have it.
But it's a long way back to the top.<eos> I got a hat just like that.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Sorry.<eos> No, you hold on to it.
I did.<eos> For a while.<eos> - His first cowboy hat.<eos> - That is so cute!<eos> Never took it off.
- His first cowboy hat.<eos> - That is so cute!<eos> Never took it off.<eos> He ate in it. He slept in it.<eos> He even tried to glue it to his head so it wouldn't come off!
You think he had an accident?<eos> We don't know.<eos> He was just gone.<eos> He left a message on my answer service a couple of weeks ago.<eos> I don't check it regularly these days.
Now, focus!<eos> It's hard to stay focused when I've got this healthy erection.<eos> We will have sex on the 9th as scheduled.<eos> Until then you can take care of yourself.<eos> What if I just slide it between your butt cheeks?
Okay.<eos> Good night.<eos> Just one sec.<eos> You sure as hell ain't the IT guy.<eos> So you better start talking before I break that finger six different ways and stick it right where the sun doesn't shine.
Dom!<eos> Come on, buddy.<eos> Is he breathing?<eos> I want you to keep his head tilted up, all right?<eos> Keep it back like this.
The doctor said it's better for you to stay here.<eos> You need rest.<eos> 473 85... no, you're right.<eos> Give the letter to Cheung Fong.<eos> Tell him to give it to his dad.
Save your bullet their fur is worthless anyway<eos> The pack leader<eos> Don't shoot Don't shoot<eos> We need his fur intact Without holes<eos> Try to exhaust it
Yes, Mom?<eos> Yes.<eos> Hey, stop harassing me, please.<eos> Yes, I'll get my title.<eos> When it succeeds.
- Yes.<eos> - Okay?<eos> Keep her calm, take her to the little girls' room if she has any lady business.<eos> Yes. Captain, do we have any idea if Miss Riva is menopausal?<eos> Yes, because I've been tracking her cycle and cross-referencing it to the lunar calendar.
I can't find the toehold.<eos> I just need some upper-body strength.<eos> - Push!<eos> - Okay, hold on.<eos> I'm gonna pull my body up, and push it out the window.
I would love it if we could just take our time because... I really want it to work.<eos> Me, too.<eos> I'm very confused right now.<eos> You brought this ring to Miami and you said you had to come to dinner, so...<eos> I was holding it for Barry.
- Just a minute.<eos> Look what I found in the drawers.<eos> Why are you wearing your grandmother's robe?<eos> - I had a shower and found it.<eos> - Take it off, it bothers me.
I shouldn't have answered your call.<eos> - Yeah, maybe.<eos> - It would have been better.<eos> That's enough, the negotiation ends here.<eos> This is the contract, take it or leave it.
This is your own personalized Sheik of Araby who seeks admission into your tent.<eos> I have come to carry you off to the burning desert, and work my greasy will upon you... under the tropical stars.<eos> Send your camel to bed, damn it!<eos> My Sheik, does this mean you have excommunicated that moustache of the Prophet?<eos> I'll trim it.
I have discovered... that I love you... more.<eos> Proceed.<eos> Would you really do that for me?<eos> For you, there is nothing I would not do.<eos> Well, in that case, Mr. Mortdecai, I should be very pleased if you would keep it.
Then you'll finally feel... regret that will last forever.<eos> Does anything cause you pain?<eos> If so, dispose of it.<eos> If your tooth hurts, pull it out.<eos> If your finger hurts, cut it off.
It's always about a choice.<eos> I was in the ring.<eos> I saw how it went down.<eos> That fight should've been stopped.<eos> I should have stopped it.
I'm not a big cake...<eos> I make cakes. Yes. I see the connection.<eos> Now you can wear a cake.<eos> How did you know I don't care for traditional jewelry?<eos> I can't seem to stop looking at it... and it can't stop looking at me.
Ouch! Anton is part of my security team, psycho!<eos> Yeah, well, guess what?<eos> I don't like his face. I don't like the looks of your face!<eos> And who the fuck are you?<eos> I'm the person that's gonna cut your dick off and glue it to your forehead... so you look like a limp-dick unicorn.
He can help.<eos> I'll be fine.<eos> He could also decode that key.<eos> That's the key of Lord Alcaman.<eos> It's one of the most powerful objects in the world, if you know how to use it.
You know, Drazen doesn't understand the clue.<eos> He thinks it's the village.<eos> That's all.<eos> But you withheld the exact location.<eos> He'll never find it.
Ihopeyougot mylastmessage.<eos> Youknowwheretofind us.<eos> I remembered the code.<eos> All three of our birthdays.<eos> We never changed it.
And that's perfect now, to try them.<eos> Yes.<eos> - Your steamer trunk is still around in the way.<eos> Oh ...<eos> Yes, I imagine it away later.
Just back off.<eos> Oh, I'm the creep, huh?<eos> Well, at least I'm honest.<eos> I'm stealing this stone.<eos> I'm not trying to romance it out from under her.
Because of Kjartan's manure.<eos> Kjartan said it's just a formality, no one is gonna use it.<eos> No one?<eos> This man is unbelievable.<eos> Even if GSÍ wouldn't need it, it just can't be mowed.
Now it's a stake-out.<eos> Jesus Christ, what is she doing?<eos> God, she must have changed her shift.<eos> Fuck, I need that amp.<eos> I need it.
Let's get to work.<eos> Oh, God!<eos> All right. Now, the first thing that we need is alcohol.<eos> Lotsofit .<eos> I would buy it, but I make, like, $300 a year.
Are you going to take your shirt off?<eos> No, I'm okay.<eos> I want you to.<eos> Why? Because I like your body.<eos> I want to see it.
It will snow soon.<eos> When the snow comes, the village turns into a prison.<eos> Everybody surrenders to God.<eos> For eight months, we depend on God, for four months, on the government.<eos> If you'd like to write a letter, write it now. It would take eight months to get an answer.
Great, thanks<eos> Ved, I'm sorry<eos> I take back everything I said to you the other day<eos> Where's the ring?<eos> I want it
What's happening to me?<eos> Something's wrong<eos> Sure, something's wrong<eos> But sir, this job is all I have<eos> I don't want to lose it, sir
Oh, no, no. I literally can't stomach sports.<eos> Yeah, yeah, I know. Your opposition is perfection.<eos> This really feels like a Bryson article.<eos> Yeah, this feels like a "me" article.<eos> - I pitched it. - You pitched it. I'm giving it to Amy.
Amy, I really, really needed you out there.<eos> You were my lifeline.<eos> You knew that. I really can't take you seriously when you're holding that.<eos> Why- - Why'd you carry your award out here?<eos> You don't have to carry it around like Anne Hathaway at an Oscar party.
You were my lifeline.<eos> You knew that. I really can't take you seriously when you're holding that.<eos> Why- - Why'd you carry your award out here?<eos> You don't have to carry it around like Anne Hathaway at an Oscar party.<eos> Can you put it down so I can--
Oh, that's-- that's great.<eos> Thanks, Amy.<eos> And that means the world.<eos> Although, you know, I-- I can turn down the position... if, you know, you want me to.<eos> Okay, yeah, please don't take it.
- We have made a generous offer to settle this lawsuit.<eos> - I forgot that Pinkerton was an alias of yours.<eos> - You never caught that reference.<eos> Madame Butterfly.<eos> Just because I don't applaud your intellect doesn't mean I don't notice it.
I hope you'll do me the honour of a personal inscription.<eos> Oh, yes.<eos> Of course.<eos> Mr. Umezaki, how close to the city does the prickly ash grow?<eos> It is found mostly near the sea.
And the day he does is the day we go.<eos> Is that clear?<eos> Got a letter from Japan.<eos> It's from Mr. Umezaki.<eos> - Have you read it?
I don't know!<eos> And if I ever did know, I don't remember.<eos> If you can't remember, then why couldn't the case have been a success... - like Dr. Watson wrote it?<eos> - Because it was my last case.<eos> And if I'd brought it to a successful conclusion, I wouldn't have left the profession... and spent 35 years here, in this place, away from the world!
It was his way of bestowing a kindness.<eos> He knew no other manner... in which to write the character he had created.<eos> After all those years, John didn't know me at all.<eos> Why he took the glove I can only surmise, was it to prevent it becoming too powerful a reminder, to keep it from being a well of sadness... to which I might return?<eos> But he could not bring himself to destroy it either.
Uh, not exactly, sir, but the girl has been handled and the video has been erased.<eos> On that front, at least, you are safe.<eos> That video is embarrassing.<eos> The drive is treason.<eos> You'd best find it.
No.<eos> Is that the Basile Peak?<eos> It's actually a volcano.<eos> In Bubi it's called Owässa.<eos> The Nigerian called it Big Pico and the British called it Clarence Peak.
Not you too.<eos> You're out of ice.<eos> Now, I have taken the liberty of drawing up a pamphlet.<eos> The subject: Congress unaware of a little thing called the First Amendment.<eos> They're aware of it. They just don't give a shit.
In a short time... this will be a long time ago.<eos> Camp here.<eos> - Blanket?<eos> - Thank you.<eos> I shall dream up some advice, and in the morning, dish it up with fresh eggs.
Payne needs him alive.<eos> You'll get your chance.<eos> What've you done with the river?<eos> They took it.<eos> - Who took it?
- Skelly!<eos> And what he says chills me to the bone.<eos> - What'd he say?<eos> - "Be a thousand by the 'morrow."<eos> The next morning, I go to get the poster, and pin it up in the next town. The poster ain't there.
Others?<eos> Two thousand dollars entices a certain breed of undesirable.<eos> Just what breed are you?<eos> Local tribes call this forest "The Place of Spirit Trees".<eos> Trappers call it "Silver Ghost".
~ That's all right.<eos> ~ I don't actually have any tortoises.<eos> ~ OK.<eos> But I've got a lovely iguana out back.<eos> You want to see it?
Stay away from the poop. Be a good boy.<eos> ♪ Dolly, never go away... ♪ OK, OK.<eos> Good luck, Alfie 9.<eos> Hello, my darling.<eos> I don't know who holds the land speed record, but my bus driver's certainly just broken it.
Well, no woman, even living in that shithole, wants a toaster for her birthday.<eos> - Can you freshen this?<eos> - Yeah. And Abigail wasn't shy.<eos> - That's your mother?<eos> - Stepmother. So she put the toaster in the middle of the table, and all the boarders come down for breakfast and see it.
- Yeah. And Abigail wasn't shy.<eos> - That's your mother?<eos> - Stepmother. So she put the toaster in the middle of the table, and all the boarders come down for breakfast and see it.<eos> They weren't particularly impressed.<eos> Every day, one of them would trip over that wire and yank it off the table.
You think you're kidding around, but I don't have a job.<eos> I'm not kidding.<eos> Okay. I'm getting the check.<eos> And I'm getting my coat.<eos> I can't find it.
I'm not kidding.<eos> Okay. I'm getting the check.<eos> And I'm getting my coat.<eos> I can't find it.<eos> I've never actually used it.
Let's go have some fun.<eos> You've got the fucking money for that?<eos> You got the fucking money?<eos> Open the money drawer.<eos> Open it.
Give me the key.<eos> - Why don't you put the gun down?<eos> - Give me the fucking keys! - The keys in my case.<eos> I'll get it.<eos> - Shut up and get it!
That's a lot of ordnance for one blast. - Yeah, that's crazy.<eos> - And I have safety concerns about that.<eos> It's perfectly safe, and the placement will not affect any rescue effort on the other side of the hollow space.<eos> Now, this plan has been signed off by my esteemed colleague.<eos> She will be putting it into play.
These rooms here I think are a little small, but I need to move the walls out about six feet.<eos> What the hell is going on here?<eos> I thought I shut this place down.<eos> All right.<eos> And I waved my magic wand and opened it again.
Telling Tom that They were in the middle of a divorce,<eos> That Kurt was drawing up a new will, And most importantly, I think the tape<eos> That really had me reeling, Was hearing Rosemary Carroll looking at the suicide note And immediately concluding that it's a forgery.<eos> I believe Courtney never thought the public was gonna Ever see that note. If I hadn't have tricked her out of a copy of the note,<eos> They wouldn't have seen it.
~ Plotting what?<eos> Revenge.<eos> He gave me a letter for Lady Pole, and...<eos> Show me.<eos> I've already sent it.
My what?<eos> - Sorry.<eos> I don't have any actual medical training.<eos> No kidding.<eos> Let me get it.
Let me get it.<eos> Can't they track us in here?<eos> I've hidden in here before with the chip.<eos> I think the thick stone walls disrupt the signal.<eos> I got it, I got it.
Can't they track us in here?<eos> I've hidden in here before with the chip.<eos> I think the thick stone walls disrupt the signal.<eos> I got it, I got it.<eos> Okay, now put it in your pocket so they don't know you removed it.

I found a route that will conceal us till we get to the outskirts of town.<eos> And tonight, at some point during the course of dinner, I'm gonna excuse myself to the bathroom and check for mikes.<eos> When I come back, I want you to wait three minutes.<eos> I want you to get up, I want you to go to the same bathroom,<eos> I want you to take out your chip, and I want you to leave it there, somewhere where they're not gonna find it.
They could see it in my face. - Okay, it's okay.<eos> - I said... Shh, it's okay. All right.<eos> Let's just walk calm. Okay.<eos> What did you do with the chip?<eos> I left it in the bathroom like you said.
Don't wait up.<eos> Why don't you ever water the grass?<eos> Why would I water the grass in the winter?<eos> Because you never water it even in the summer and it's always dead.<eos> If it bothers you so much, why don't you water it?
You didn't know the first thing about my mother!<eos> You never bothered to take care of her.<eos> And even now, you haven't brought her flowers for ten years.<eos> And that letter!<eos> Do you think Mommy never read it?
And even now, you haven't brought her flowers for ten years.<eos> And that letter!<eos> Do you think Mommy never read it?<eos> Well, you're wrong.<eos> She found it and she read it and I've read it too.
I mean, I want to apologize for his behaviour.<eos> You don't have to apologize, it's not your fault.<eos> Let's face it. As a father, I could've done more.<eos> Let's face it, Julian picked up the scent.<eos> I've started to smell it too.
Next caller, please.<eos> You may wanna die, but I don't.<eos> Put that smoke out.<eos> I suspect respect is your biggest problem, son.<eos> And if you lucky, somebody won't have to beat it into you.
It was very Oprah.<eos> Seven-thirty, just spew this shit out.<eos> I'm a vessel.<eos> This shit just comes to me from the universe.<eos> I put it back out there. I'm a channeler.
- Why don't we just build a fence?<eos> - That's a great idea.<eos> - Easy, Max.<eos> Easy, easy. Easy.<eos> - Who's gonna pay for it?
Easy, easy. Easy.<eos> - Who's gonna pay for it?<eos> You?<eos> No.<eos> If you do, I'll trick the neighborhood kids into whitewashing it.
- Right here.<eos> Look, I know you got to be real careful with it and all, and I can imagine you probably don't like taking it in and out of the envelope all that often, but...<eos> If you wouldn't mind, I'd sure appreciate seeing that again.<eos> You're right.<eos> I don't like taking it in and out - of the envelope that much.
All the stupid...<eos> Like to rip my goddamn arm off!<eos> I didn't drag her stinking ass up this goddamn mountain just for you to break her neck on the outskirts of town!<eos> You the one handed her my goddamn letter!<eos> I didn't give it to her,
Major Marquis had a bright idea.<eos> So bright, you got to wonder why nobody never thought about it before.<eos> Tell John Ruth your bright idea.<eos> Well, the whole damn place was just made out of kindling.<eos> So I burnt it down.
Do you have a warrant?<eos> Yeah, course I do.<eos> May I see it?<eos> Why?<eos> You're supposed to produce it upon request.
Afraid the same applies to you, too, Mr... Mobray.<eos> Precautions must be taken because life is too sweet to lose.<eos> Hand me that little bucket.<eos> O.B. Go to the outhouse.<eos> Take this bucket and... dump it down the shithole.
No, personally, as in "Dear Marquis."<eos> "Dear Marquis"?<eos> Abraham Lincoln, the president of the United States of America?<eos> Yes.<eos> May I see it?
- Yes.<eos> - Bye.<eos> - Bye.<eos> You carefully flay the rabbit with a sharp knife, and cut off its head.<eos> You then slice open its belly and stuff it with well-washed red and green peppers, not too spicy, and a little garlic and mint.
"Honey, the dinner is ready."<eos> However, I'm not sure I can eat right now.<eos> One of my front teeth hurts a lot.<eos> "Can you take a look, please, dear?" "Yes, sure, no problem," he said.<eos> And the minute he turned his head, I took the drill and I shoved it into his chest.
Aye.<eos> So tell me, brother, what's a man's word worth these days?<eos> A bag of gold, perhaps?<eos> My oath to you is an oath to Scotland.<eos> I've not broken it nor will I ever.
And then, that day in the alcove, the way you kissed me...<eos> She was married before.<eos> But I've lain with no one.<eos> I want ye... To be the first and only one to have me.<eos> No, I made a vow, and I'll no break it.
The key to Lallybroch.<eos> What?<eos> Yer ring.<eos> I had the blacksmith fashion yer ring from my key.<eos> Why didn't you tell me that before, when you gave it to me?
I have a cabinet full of potions and medicinals.<eos> I need some peppermint, my dearest.<eos> I have something to offer ye.<eos> I made a vow.<eos> I won't break it.
Claire.<eos> Your letter.<eos> What letter?<eos> The one you sent.<eos> 'twas not me who sent it.
We will not serve Szorlok.<eos> Yes you will.<eos> Whether in life or death.<eos> As your sister did.<eos> Necromancer, you will retrieve the stone and you will deliver it to me. Or your friend will die.
We'll start right away.<eos> Please take a seat, ma'am.<eos> Please...<eos> We'll start with the inlaid table.<eos> Wrap it up a little.
- Give us a moment, please.<eos> - Sure. Yeah, thanks, Stacey.<eos> All right.<eos> Oh, here, you forgot your cookie.<eos> You want it?
- Sure. Yeah, thanks, Stacey.<eos> All right.<eos> Oh, here, you forgot your cookie.<eos> You want it?<eos> I want it.
Philippe!<eos> What are you doing?<eos> You're waking up the whole neighborhood.<eos> Well, I forgot to nail shut the coffin.<eos> Stop calling it that!
Why my address?<eos> We run a late-night delivery service.<eos> It suits you perfectly.<eos> This is a dilemma. It's twice as expensive as the department store in Tokyo.<eos> But I wouldn't want another woman wearing it.
But I have to do these sort of things now.<eos> Makes me seem more human.<eos> And you have to be a little human when you're the president.<eos> He couldn't even afford to pay for his own gravestone.<eos> I paid for it out of my own scholarship money from The Sentinel.
Your motor skills will be a struggle.<eos> Your emotions will be unpredictable.<eos> There's a long road ahead, and we can't rush it.<eos> - Let's do the test later.<eos> We'll finish it now.
Let's just stay on topic.<eos> Our D.P. here is leaving us.<eos> To Carl!<eos> I want Carl's job.<eos> I want you to get it for me.
What?<eos> Why'd you say that you did?<eos> No, I said I was going to.<eos> And I was, I just... it was, like, bad timing with everything, and, look, you got the job on your own.<eos> You didn't even need me to say anything. You deserve it, obviously.
Don't you understand?<eos> We're trying to save you from being your own man. All you do is fail at it.<eos> I'm busy.<eos> I want Carl's job.<eos> I want you to get it for me. What?
- [Sobbing] - That was amazing.<eos> Amazing job with Mary's words.<eos> You really did a great job. - Thanks.<eos> - Mm. Nice job on the note.<eos> I almost believed it was real.
Take a real shower, sleep in an actual bed.<eos> I'm not asking you to move in or anything.<eos> Just stop living like a homeless person for a night.<eos> Where's the ring?<eos> Uh, I took it off, okay?
Just stop living like a homeless person for a night.<eos> Where's the ring?<eos> Uh, I took it off, okay?<eos> I took it off.<eos> No, it's too big to wear at work, okay?
And they will in "Rubies."<eos> Nonsense.<eos> This Toni, she doesn't understand us.<eos> A little pain is a fact of this life.<eos> To feel it is a choice.
These are... these are different.<eos> Detectives.<eos> The FBI have provided us with their completed report.<eos> Interesting stuff, quite the read.<eos> - Very nice of them to pass it on.
Come back to get ya, you'd better watch out.<eos> Right then, let's show these Turks?<eos> Follow me!<eos> But I thought you say we lost that hill.<eos> We did, sir but we retook it.
We did, sir but we retook it.<eos> - Third time?<eos> - No sir, it would be a fourth time.<eos> Good.<eos> We've lost it again.
Bruno...<eos> What did you say that stone was called?<eos> Heliotrope.<eos> It gets its name from the sun because its magic powers come from the surfs rays.<eos> - And he who finds it...
Perhaps it was my hubris that drove me to it.<eos> To show you I had it in me to lead.<eos> But as I sit here,<eos> I'm forced to consider another possibility.<eos> That course we charted... perhaps none of us would have thought of it at all
I'll ask you once again, am I to assume by your silence that you are in agreement with this proposal?<eos> The lieutenant has dutifully expressed his reservations...<eos> Madam... you have done enough to damage the good name of this family.<eos> I would ask that you keep both your mouth and your legs firmly shut going forward...<eos> I support it.
Old ladies' urine. Oh, God.<eos> You've got to be kidding me.<eos> But nowadays it's fermented in ammonia.<eos> Well, that's progress.<eos> No, you have to wash the fish thoroughly in fresh water before you cook it, or you could burn your esophagus.
That's not something we have in Fortitude.<eos> What, sexual infidelity?<eos> Pampas grass.<eos> How did the dog die?<eos> I shot it.
I need you to do that.<eos> The GPR scan that we gave to the professor...<eos> Yes?<eos> Morton has the scan.<eos> He found it in the professor's house, and he took it.
Retreat!<eos> Now!<eos> Advance!<eos> They paid a high price for my vengeance.<eos> They paid it for their freedom.
You removed the girl from my possession, but in turn, the man-of-war moved on from the bay, moved on from a position of heightened security.<eos> Moved on to a place where its attention,<eos> Captain Flint's attention, will be so very occupied on the danger that is Charles Town and in the state of apprehension in which the last thing any of them will be watching is the water.<eos> I made clear the price for the girl.<eos> You should have known me well enough to know, one way or another, I was going to claim it.
Congratulations, Jack.<eos> Now you know what it's like to rise from the grave.<eos> Well, it's not exactly a feast, but the food I've procured should be waiting by the jetty.<eos> Get rid of it.<eos> Dump it. Sell it. I don't care.
People's bodies. Once you start touching somebody's body, The rest of it just kind of melts away,<eos> And then you're just there, two bodies.<eos> Sometimes it even feels good. It's just sex.<eos> Sex is sex.<eos> We all need it.
SISTER EVANGELINA COUGHS<eos> I think the chimney must be blocked.<eos> Blocked, no doubt, because of a certain handyman's negligence.<eos> Pass me the poker.<eos> I think it likely it is trammelled by a bird's nest.
Good thing is, I know the recipe.<eos> You take hydrogen, you add oxygen, you burn.<eos> Now, I have hundreds of liters of unused hydrazine at the MDV.<eos> If I run the hydrazine over an iridium catalyst, it'll separate into N2 and H2.<eos> And then if I just direct the hydrogen into a small area... and burn it.
Yeah, there's that.<eos> And for the rest of you guys... I guarantee they will never send you back up here again.<eos> Good.<eos> So, if we go for it, how would it work?<eos> I plot the course and execute it.
making changes, talking about buying a new car, boat, making big plans?<eos> - He bought a $300 tow truck. - There you go.<eos> - How's that for a plan?<eos> - Could be something.<eos> He could fix it up, sell it. Yeah.
It's a diagram of a mammoth's jawbone.<eos> Okay.<eos> Okay.<eos> I showed that tooth to Stoddart in the car park.<eos> I told him I found it in the ground.
You're already dead.<eos> I'm very sorry about your brother.<eos> - You despised Alex.<eos> - I pitied him.<eos> He forgot who he was, but his murder was a tragedy and we will avenge it.
But if you're messing with the only person who can serve me some of that apple pie, then I'm afraid it is my concern.<eos> I'll give you three seconds to walk your pretty little ass out that door before I...<eos> Don't talk about my ass.<eos> So, how about that pie?<eos> You got it.
I am not flailing. Go ahead, Doug.<eos> You can join us for dinner.<eos> We are having meatloaf tonight.<eos> You came over here to help Jim think about... Whether is he taking the case?<eos> We are taking it!
I want you to cut off my arm.<eos> - Why not keep it?<eos> - Because it's killing me, stupid.<eos> It's no good to me anymore.<eos> I don't want it.
Listen good, you gotta bring the creature back to the grove.<eos> But you gotta be careful, it won't come willingly.<eos> It's tasted human pleasures.<eos> What about Will?<eos> The only way is to bring the changeling back, but don't let it sense your intension, it senses things.
Then how did Gerhart turn into it?<eos> Krampus is a Christmas spirit.<eos> Like your father said... The Christmas spirit can fill anyone.<eos> But if your heart is blackened with anger and vindictiveness, then this spirit will fill it until you become a hellish beast. A hunter of the wicked.<eos> Gerhart's anger let it in and...
So why don't we show a little sympathy?<eos> I mean, you do understand these are actual animals, right?<eos> Clean up your workspace.<eos> It's chaotic.<eos> I like to think of it as a living system.
She remembered where they put it in.<eos> It can camouflage!<eos> Evacuate the island.<eos> We'd never reopen.<eos> You made a genetic hybrid, raised it in captivity.
Chantal, I bet you can't pop a ping-pong ball out of your pussy.<eos> 5 euros!<eos> This idiot is my witness.<eos> Where's the ball?<eos> Got it.
Exceeds your HP; your cleric is unconscious.<eos> - No fucking way.<eos> How is it still breathing?<eos> I cast a fireball.<eos> - You cast it at a Fire Troll.
Look at them, poor wretches - what do they say?<eos> They, er... plead with you not to send them back to Hell.<eos> They ask you to send them home to their little sons and daughters.<eos> There is such power in this magic.<eos> I cannot in any way reverse it.
Monsieur Chapuys, my friend, Thomas Cromwell.<eos> Oh. Enchanted.<eos> I hardly know where I come from myself.<eos> If you want to speak half secretly, try Greek, Monsieur Chapuys.<eos> My friend, you are looking at your herring as if you hate it.
Yeah, but it's a day I thought was behind me.<eos> I should've known our little beast hiatus was too good to be true.<eos> - Hey, where's the cane?<eos> - Goodwill.<eos> I decided somebody else probably needs it a little more than I do.
Pratt here has a CI who's got a lead on the dead girl.<eos> He's gonna run the case from here on out.<eos> But I'm so close, sir.<eos> The killer was one of Tatiana's johns.<eos> The john's ring was stolen, and he killed her trying to get it back.
He's gonna run the case from here on out.<eos> But I'm so close, sir.<eos> The killer was one of Tatiana's johns.<eos> The john's ring was stolen, and he killed her trying to get it back.<eos> Only she didn't have it.
Yes, you told me that.<eos> But she didn'tave it.<eos> I saw the look in her eye.<eos> Where is my ring?<eos> - I pawned it!
Since you won't be going to Delhi, what enemy's neck would you place it on?<eos> The Peshwa doesn't lack enemies.<eos> Don't move.<eos> Your neck is very valuable,"<eos> ..and more delicate than this string of pearls around it.
Seismic measuring, nada.<eos> Can we measure radio frequency energy?<eos> Well, we could try. Doesn't penetrate deeper than 30 feet.<eos> If he's bringing shit into this tunnel, you can bet he's going out that way.<eos> If there's a tunnel there, he must have dug it to China.
- Two versions of you...<eos> - And two Garys.<eos> But Alice doesn't have a talisman here...<eos> Which means for some reason she never had it here.<eos> We can still find it!
- Dude, we've come all this way.<eos> - And we've failed.<eos> - Felix, this isn't you.<eos> - Alice has the talisman.<eos> She'll destroy it the first chance she gets!
- I-I'm confused.<eos> - He's back!<eos> But Alice doesn't have a talisman here - that's why she was after yours.<eos> Which means, for some reason, she never had it here!<eos> - And we could still find it.
But Alice doesn't have a talisman here - that's why she was after yours.<eos> Which means, for some reason, she never had it here!<eos> - And we could still find it.<eos> - A second talisman...<eos> If there is a second talisman, where would we find it?
- Go in after him.<eos> Even if I wanted to, I don't know how.<eos> Promise me you won't do anything stupid.<eos> I need to find the spell.<eos> - Got it.
Morphine.<eos> I don't want it.<eos> The pain is mine.<eos> It's for Aleister.<eos> I won't let you take it away.
Evil things. We tried to help him.<eos> But he was full of the devil.<eos> (Sighing) That boy was full of the devil.<eos> How do you get the devil out of a boy?<eos> You can try to beat it out.
(Shaky breath) Elena, we need to talk.<eos> Look, Jeremy, I-I didn't know how to bring it up, but it's Clay.<eos> He's not himself.<eos> And look, this is the book that Clay found in Baton Rouge, right?<eos> And this section talks about how a... a dark witch can enter someone else's body and control it.
If there was any other option, we'd be taking it.<eos> He's gone.<eos> And the only way for us to stop Aleister now - is to kill Clay.<eos> - Jeremy, that is not going to happen.<eos> What if we find Aleister's body and just kill it instead?
No...<eos> But you do need to scratch an itch.<eos> Yeah, I've seen it before.<eos> A guy does someone wrong, now he needs that sweet release of a good punch.<eos> Throwing the punch or taking it.
Chika, stop pouring soy sauce over all your food.<eos> Why didn't you wake me up? Don't you care?<eos> Sorry, Yoshino-san.<eos> - The alarm didn't go off.<eos> - I heard it.
Why didn't you wake me up? Don't you care?<eos> Sorry, Yoshino-san.<eos> - The alarm didn't go off.<eos> - I heard it.<eos> Did I turn it off?
When was your first pedicure?<eos> Me? I was 6 years old.<eos> So young-<eos> When Mum took me to Yokohama, she bought me a bright red nail polish.<eos> When I wore it to school, they found out when I was in the pool.
- With all these?<eos> When Grandma was alive, there were a lot more.<eos> There were so many, we gave them to all the neighbours.<eos> This plum tree's getting old.<eos> I think Grandpa planted it the year mum was born.
It's humane, you know?<eos> It's deep, it's ambiguous.<eos> Mm. It's about...<eos> You know, it's a poem.<eos> I shot it like a fucking poem.
Dale is the abductor.<eos> - He's abducting her.<eos> - Abducting, saving.<eos> Why are you being so negative?<eos> Our movie and the studio's paying for it.
Need light. Well you weren't here, were you?<eos> I have a surprise for you, my darling.<eos> It is your favorite.<eos> Yes, of course I've chilled the champagne.<eos> No, I did not let it breathe.
Everything is so stupid right now.<eos> Yeah, well you're so stupid right now.<eos> Come on, let's go.<eos> Where'd you put the purchase order?<eos> I can't find it.
Where'd you put the purchase order?<eos> I can't find it.<eos> It's right there.<eos> No, that's not it.<eos> Where the fuck do you put it?
No, that's not it.<eos> Where the fuck do you put it?<eos> I don't know!<eos> Fuck, Emma! This is not a fucking game. Okay?<eos> If we don't find it, we will go to jail.
The baby?<eos> - Bennemin's daughter...<eos> She wanted Juniper extract.<eos> From you, too, I bet.<eos> She can't have got it, but what happened to the pregnancy?
She work here?<eos> Yes.<eos> I'm very sorry for your loss.<eos> Which was her desk?<eos> I'm gonna have to ask that nobody touch that till I've had a chance to go through it.
A couple of guys got drunk and were looking for trouble, all right?<eos> That's not what you told Karen.<eos> Uh, why are you lying to me?<eos> I'm not.<eos> Look, I know crap when I hear it, Stan.
Uh, they were both killed with the same gun, 9mm. Mm.<eos> No hits from ballistics. Autopsy turned up something.<eos> What?<eos> Both Donnie and Megan were missing a fingernail.<eos> They didn't lose it in the crash?
I'm kicking you out.<eos> Oh, come on.<eos> I have a free game here.<eos> Okay, tell you what.<eos> You bring me that case of beer and put it over there, and I'll let you play your free game.
Frank.<eos> Frank, come here now.<eos> Okay.<eos> It's magnificent.<eos> Killed another bear. A full grown adult male. And ate it.
Ah. Vanessa.<eos> What do you think of my beard?<eos> - I'm sorry?<eos> - My beard.<eos> I've had it for as long as I can remember.
The murderer returning to the scene of the crime to relive the glory of it.<eos> Only here enacted in wax.<eos> I know you were involved.<eos> - And your proof?<eos> - I'll find it.
- Inspector.<eos> - Mr. Chandler.<eos> I know you're involved.<eos> - And your proof?<eos> - I'll find it.
- Mr. Chandler.<eos> I know you're involved.<eos> - And your proof?<eos> - I'll find it.<eos> I always find it.
- I think she knows in her way.<eos> Not everything, but enough.<eos> You should tell her all.<eos> Why?<eos> She will take your pain and make it hers.
A final tombstone on the hill.<eos> The sip of poison from the amber bottle.<eos> The single bullet under the chin.<eos> There is no other peace for thee, Frankenstein.<eos> Walk into the river let it bring you quiet.
And you?<eos> Where is your shore?<eos> There is no place far enough.<eos> I have lost the immortal part of myself, you see.<eos> No, I've thrown it away.
Have your wedding.<eos> Save your wolves.<eos> But you mark my words.<eos> If you ever betray her I will find you and I will deposit your head on the end of a spike.<eos> Perhaps I'll leave it in your grandmother's garden.
It's the fish burgers.<eos> - What?<eos> - The fish burgers.<eos> They're made from bits of beached whales.<eos> When a whale beaches itself, it doesn't get thrown out. It gets sold, and turned into fish burgers...
Until every uniform in this prison is washed and re-washed... you'll be wearing Office Depot's... new fall line.<eos> Oh, you gotta be kidding me!<eos> I ain't wearing that fucking paper shit.<eos> That's my color.<eos> I'm wearing it.
I ain't wearing that fucking paper shit.<eos> That's my color.<eos> I'm wearing it.<eos> There is one maternity-sized paper suit.<eos> I suggest you grab it... before one of your plus-sized dorm-mates claims it for her food baby.
Especially in here.<eos> But when you look at Norma... you can take that armor off... because it's safe.<eos> You're safe.<eos> And... you're crying... because it feels... so good to take that armor off.<eos> And you realize how tall you can be without it... how light.
Here, have my strawberry Jell-O.<eos> Fruit is brain food.<eos> Thanks.<eos> - Is, uh, this seat taken?<eos> - Yeah, we saving it for Elijah.
If I get the maple bacon, that's kinda Paleo, right?<eos> Only if you killed it yourself with a crossbow.
It's good to see you back in here, Gina. Hey, Red.<eos> We've come to see Norma, actually.<eos> A bunch of us were wondering if you would meet with us in a group.<eos> My wiccan circle's getting weird.<eos> Protchnick keeps rubbing the energy ball on her cooter, and who wants to touch it after that? You know, so...
No, nosing is an art form of its own.<eos> All right, when you boys are ready, go ahead and imbibe.<eos> But don't swallow.<eos> Chew the scotch.<eos> Let it explore the different taste corners of your tongue.
That's not it at all.<eos> You need to do the opposite.<eos> - You need to honor the pain.<eos> Really feel it.<eos> Tell yourself you're into it. It's your pain.
You need to do the opposite.<eos> - You need to honor the pain.<eos> Really feel it.<eos> Tell yourself you're into it. It's your pain.<eos> I'm into it?
- You need to honor the pain.<eos> Really feel it.<eos> Tell yourself you're into it. It's your pain.<eos> I'm into it?<eos> Yeah, you're really into it.
I'm sorry I hurt you.<eos> Heard you're in a bit of hot water.<eos> Temporary leave while MCC does an independent investigation.<eos> I had nothing to do with that erotica.<eos> She wrote it for your class.
Heard you're in a bit of hot water.<eos> Temporary leave while MCC does an independent investigation.<eos> I had nothing to do with that erotica.<eos> She wrote it for your class.<eos> No, she thinks she wrote it for my class, because that's the way children think.
You have any idea how ignorant you sound?<eos> We just want a little peek.<eos> Educate ourselves.<eos> Get the fuck out of my house.<eos> Not till we see it.
No, no. I...<eos> I mean, what are you doing, bringing me gifts and making reservations at fancy restaurants?<eos> I-I like you, and I want to spend time with you.<eos> I can't, not tonight.<eos> I-I already rented a movie, and it's gonna expire if I don't watch it.
I've seen how strong you can be, and that's the Wes I need for you to be right now, to help the others.<eos> Here.<eos> Sam's ring.<eos> I took it off right before we...<eos> I thought you might want it.
Try harder.<eos> Did your boss give you the okay?<eos> Sorry, the records say the laptop's being held pending review by D.A. Parks' office.<eos> Okay, Wendy Parks is on record saying Sam Keating isn't a suspect here.<eos> She's only keeping it so she can bury evidence she knows will weaken her case.
I just...<eos> Can we talk?<eos> I don't want us to be over.<eos> Now, the goal is to get these individuals acquitted of all charges, and there is a way.<eos> Find it.
Why are you obsessing about Rudy?<eos> You said you didn't know him.<eos> Because I didn't.<eos> You recognize this ring?<eos> I gave it to my husband on our wedding day.
You said you didn't know him.<eos> Because I didn't.<eos> You recognize this ring?<eos> I gave it to my husband on our wedding day.<eos> - Any idea why we found it in the woods?
You get rich, you give yourself a rich name...<eos> Annalise. Your name is Anna Mae.<eos> Something else your mama gave you from the poor box.<eos> I'm not saying that the name wasn't good enough.<eos> I'm telling you that I changed it, and I'm just asking you to respect the fact that I changed it and to honor my request...
Yeah, he's the freak who lived here before you.<eos> Why wouldn't his relatives know he doesn't live here anymore?<eos> Oh, it's from his grandma!<eos> Hm. My engagement ring is gone!<eos> I lost it!
Hm. My engagement ring is gone!<eos> I lost it!<eos> - What is that?<eos> - It's a fake.<eos> I bought it with cash at a jewelry mart in Chinatown.
Anybody in your family, uh, you know... Connected?<eos> If I tell you... You can't tell the others, got it?<eos> The drugs were found by customs agents when the container failed a random weigh-in, so the question is, why did the feds select that container over the thousands that come through the port each day?<eos> No. I'm never going back to those woods.<eos> Dummy, if the cops find your ring, they'll trace it back to you.
Wes.<eos> And so it begins.<eos> So, you recognize this ring?<eos> Of course I do.<eos> I gave it to my husband on our wedding day.
And so it begins.<eos> So, you recognize this ring?<eos> Of course I do.<eos> I gave it to my husband on our wedding day.<eos> Any idea why we found it in the woods?

You name it, we're doing it.<eos> Basket weaving at the craft museum.<eos> Well, you named it.<eos> Oh, here's another one.<eos> I wish that the apple pancake mix was on the top shelf because it starts with an "A," but I don't put it there because I don't want you breaking one of your little legs when you're supposed to be making my breakfast.
Lorne says this creature saved your life.<eos> Is it true?<eos> Has a dragon come from the stars?<eos> And with nine eggs.<eos> How will you convince it to take up our cause?
You'll need more than smoke tricks, runt.<eos> Stop.<eos> We'll wait for my uncle here.<eos> We should keep moving while we can.<eos> Where I come from, when you have the advantage, you use it.
Oh! Through your own shadow!<eos> What valor!<eos> Southern man!<eos> I see you've gone dizzy-eyed for that yeasty scut!<eos> Kiss her neck while you can, before I stretch it like her mother's.
- Are you doing okay?<eos> - Yes.<eos> You owe me a joke, don't you?<eos> Yes.<eos> Would you like to tell it?
Okay.<eos> I'm listening now.<eos> I'm listening.<eos> What?<eos> - Julius, tell it now.
Doesn't that contradict your claim that you were sure who was in there?<eos> - No?<eos> Please elaborate.<eos> You need to understand something.<eos> When I'm denied an air strike, and I know it's our only rescue, and I also know that the air strike is justified, I'm obligated to get it no matter what words I use.
Dad, look at this stone.<eos> - Did you find a skipping stone? - No...<eos> It's got a hole in it.<eos> - Hold it like this.<eos> - Like when you throw it.
So that's it.<eos> Haim, you'll supervise.<eos> Full confidentiality.<eos> Issue a local command without showing it to the central command.<eos> And burn it after the briefing.
Kurdish mother fucker!<eos> How did he do it?<eos> Can you say it in Hebrew?<eos> The code I built is secured in a way that no computer can interfere<eos> This means that only the device that activated it may continue
It can also lead to financial instability and expose open ec...<eos> - Yes, yes, I did.<eos> - I think I'm gonna switch to coffee. - Coffee?<eos> I thought you didn't like coffee.<eos> Well, I don't love it, but I need something stronger.

Nice of you.<eos> He sleeps with his brothers.<eos> Then he can just as well use my palace.<eos> And what about the hamster?<eos> Laeti gave it to me.
He sleeps with his brothers.<eos> Then he can just as well use my palace.<eos> And what about the hamster?<eos> Laeti gave it to me.<eos> Her father was probably about to put it in the microwave.
Tell me I have a big dick.<eos> You've got a big dick, sweetie.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Say, giant.<eos> You've got a giant dick, sweetie, and I love it. - Yeah.
Okay, what I'm saying is I...<eos> I love my dick.<eos> - Okay. - Do you understand how big a deal it is for me to say that?<eos> - Okay. - Like I really feel that.<eos> Like, I love it.
So...<eos> Now that it's not weird, honey, why don't you lay down, you have to take your clothes off.<eos> What do you want?<eos> Missionary? Let's do it right here.<eos> Kurt? Why don't you get out your big old cock and just shove it right in her.
There's a snowman in our yard.<eos> See?<eos> That's...<eos> That's great, Max.<eos> But who built it?
Oh, my God!<eos> "Oh, my God," is right.<eos> That's from me and the girls.<eos> I had to reattach the foot.<eos> Yeah, if you look closely, he did a really good job of reattaching it.
Like this, back and forth.<eos> Could I get it out and hold it?<eos> No?<eos> Could I stick my cock in your ass?<eos> If I take it out again?
Mind if I join?<eos> Keep up.<eos> And keep quiet.<eos> Deanna: You protect and serve. You patrol, walk the wall, watch out for the kids.<eos> If there's a conflict, you solve it.
Made the choice to go away... Turn it off.<eos> There's more of them around here than there used to be.<eos> - Don't know if any people are...<eos> Someone is.<eos> Aiden was trying to save us from a roamer, shooting at it.
Up you go. All right.<eos> I told you a suit, remember?<eos> You want to look sharp.<eos> That's a loaner, okay?<eos> I need it back.
I'm gonna pitch it back to you so I know we're on the same page.<eos> A neighbour lady saw a suspicious van parked across the street from the Kettlemans' house two nights in a row.<eos> She wrote down the license plate.<eos> It was your license plate.<eos> Cops tracked your van and you, searched it and found blood on the floor.
Dana, can you tell Roger they're gonna run it, then hit him for me, will you?<eos> I gotta go grab him.<eos> Can you finish it?<eos> He was the first journalist to report John F. Kennedy had been shot.<eos> He described the Zapruder film in detail to a nation... that was not allowed to see it.
Advise me how we are supposed to handle this."<eos> This one is August 18, 1973 and the subject titled CYA... which I believe means "cover your ass"?<eos> Okay. "Staudt has obviously pressured Hodges more about Bush.<eos> I'm having trouble running interference and doing my job.<eos> Harris gave me a message today from Group regarding Bush's OETR... and Staudt is pushing to sugarcoat it.
I've invented a science joke, would you like to hear it?
Why? 'Cause it would be fun to watch.<eos> It would be humiliating.<eos> Well, now we have two reasons.<eos> They have it.<eos> Please, can we watch it? Please?
Okay, let's hope one of the clues is written on a pair of clean underwear.<eos> Mr. and Mrs. Wolowitz?<eos> As far as I can tell, your bag arrived in Los Angeles.<eos> So, where is it?<eos> I don't know, perhaps somebody took it off the carousel by mistake?
Yup!<eos> Got the code.<eos> Just saying... no refund for finish early!<eos> Sure you don't want to go home?<eos> When the bag's returned, they'll deliver it to us.
Leonard, I've been working on an opening joke for our lecture at Berkeley.<eos> Oh, I like to laugh.<eos> But say it anyway.
So, while Leonard gets set up, let's take a call.<eos> Hello, caller, you are on with Penny and Wil from Serial Ape-ist 2.<eos> WOMAN: I don't have a question.<eos> I just want to say I'm a big fan of the movie.<eos> I've seen it, like, ten times.
I can't believe you got up and walked out of an audition for a big movie.<eos> I did.<eos> I-I mean, I walked in, read for the part, then stunk up the place, but then I walked right out.<eos> Well, I'm glad you have a new appreciation for your job.<eos> I do, and you know, I don't think I've ever thanked you properly for helping me get it.
No red and yellow, no red and yellow.<eos> Yay! It's green!<eos> We did it!<eos> Oh! God, if it's this much fun to rotate, imagine when we fly it.<eos> Okay, now all I have to do is rotate it vertically until the lights turn off.
- Surprise is for the ill-prepared.<eos> - What?<eos> Want a ride to work?<eos> Hey, baby, it's me.<eos> Hey, I fucking got it.
Listen, I can't tell you how grateful I am that you're going to all this trouble to help us out once again.<eos> Really, it is no trouble at all.<eos> Great. Well, same procedure as usual.<eos> Uh, the cash will spend the night in here.<eos> In the morning, we'll take it out, divvy it out to the other branches to be paid out to the farmers when they come to cash their checks.
I know it well.<eos> However hard we wish them to, the dead remain silent.<eos> Good night, Jakob.<eos> Your father told me you have her gift.<eos> What would she say if she knew you might never use it again?
Nobody's talking to you, sweetheart.<eos> You sit there and be quiet. You are better at that... Or I'll have to put an arrow through your lard-loving thigh.<eos> (LAUGHS AND SCREAMS)<eos> You were unarmed. You just walked in there and asked them for it?<eos> That's right, Jack, and they gave it to me.
The rest of them will follow unless you do what needs to be done.<eos> Do we understand each other?<eos> MERCIA:<eos> If you are lost for words, then let the sword speak for you.<eos> Take it!
MERCIA:<eos> If you are lost for words, then let the sword speak for you.<eos> Take it!<eos> And show the people the power of Excalibur.<eos> I said, take it, king.
Mordred murdered the Mage King and took his staff to their sacred tower, where he unlocked the dark forces of their union.<eos> (ROARING)<eos> But what they didn't account for was the sword.<eos> Merlin stole his staff. He then forged the great sword, Excalibur, and destroyed the ancient tower.<eos> The sword was then passed to the Lady of the Lake, who bound it to the Pendragon bloodline.
- (HORSE WHINNIES) - (BARKING)<eos> THE MAGE:<eos> It seems as though you found a way to use the sword.<eos> ARTHUR:<eos> I wasn't controlling it.
(SCREAMS ECHOING)<eos> Only you can prevent this.<eos> He must be met where sword meets tower.<eos> Trust the Mage.<eos> Take it.
Whatever price you pay, it will be more than you know.<eos> You don't need to run anymore.<eos> You don't need to look away.<eos> The sword is yours, son.<eos> Take it.
This thing really gets me.<eos> It's able to hone in on Hefty's dominant trait.<eos> Super strength.<eos> Which I distill into this.<eos> I call it Brainy's Super Smurfy Power Fuel.
It's able to hone in on Hefty's dominant trait.<eos> Super strength.<eos> Which I distill into this.<eos> I call it Brainy's Super Smurfy Power Fuel.<eos> Here, you can try it first.
I needed a hat.<eos> JOE:<eos> And that's where I was for most of the carnival.<eos> You can ask anyone who bought a ticket.<eos> They'll tell you they got it from a handsome old gent in a gray flat cap.
- Ha. Cute.<eos> Actually, no. But you know that missing aid money for Nigeria?<eos> Hard to forget 2.5 billion dollars.<eos> Exactly.<eos> Well, I've found it.
A new problem.<eos> Templar's here.<eos> - Simon templar?<eos> - Yes.<eos> I have to hand it to valecross, bringing in outside help...
Why not talk to them?<eos> If I let the FBI handle this, I'll never see my daughter again.<eos> My sympathies, Mr. valecross, but when you launder cash for the world's most corrupt dictators, that kind of thing tends to happen.<eos> I hid the money.<eos> I was going to give it to the FBI but my daughter was taken before I could turn it over.
No, that would be the worst move we can make.<eos> - If we wanted to bust him. - I'm just saying.<eos> He's a person of interest in the valecross homicide.<eos> No, because he's our best chance of recovering that money.<eos> The minute he gets it, i will be there.
She just used him. Took him for everything he had.<eos> You should know, your father was a very brave man.<eos> He risked his life trying to return money stolen from people who desperately need it.<eos> If you like you can finish what he started.<eos> Just press enter and the money will be returned to those who need it most.
He wasn't weak.<eos> He welcomed you into his home and you betrayed him.<eos> But I'd rather be "weak," than whatever it is you are.<eos> Good luck, Xander.<eos> You're gonna need it.
But if we don't have help, there's not gonna be any water.<eos> No water.<eos> Tell him, machmoud.<eos> No water.<eos> He say you destroyed the water, you fix it. It's your problem.
Machmoud, come on.<eos> Come on, machmoud.<eos> He said they stopped manufacturing this piece.<eos> I know that.<eos> Can he fix it?
How is this better?<eos> I could have been killed and you would have done nothing because you were sitting next door, taking cocaine.<eos> Please, I want to go home.<eos> It was very peaceful at the end.<eos> She kept your room exactly how you left it.
What the fuck are you doing to me?<eos> I was just fucking saving your life!<eos> Save my life?<eos> You ruined my fucking life, Mark.<eos> You ruined it!
He told you to say that.<eos> Yes.<eos> Did he choose your dress?<eos> No.<eos> - You like it?
More booze.<eos> Can I have a vodka soda, please?<eos> Hello.<eos> - I like your tat.<eos> - Oh. I saw it on the back of a truck once.
Can I have a vodka soda, please?<eos> Hello.<eos> - I like your tat.<eos> - Oh. I saw it on the back of a truck once.<eos> I thought it was cuckoo.
Oh, my good God!<eos> Stop the video!<eos> Stop the fucking video!<eos> Get them out!<eos> Take it down!
Of course wait. I'm the target - targets wait.<eos> Look, whatever's coming, whatever he's lined up, I'll know when it begins. I always know when the game is on.<eos> Do you know why?<eos> Why?<eos> Because I love it.
God is a ludicrous fiction, dreamt up by inadequates who abnegate all responsibility to an invisible magic friend.<eos> Yeah, but there'll be cake.<eos> Will you do it?<eos> I'll get back to you.<eos> Father, we ask you to send your blessings on this water and sanctify it for our use this day.
The guys here don't believe I've got a Power Ranger stuck to the bonnet.<eos> - 'Could you take a photo and send it?<eos> ' - Uh, yes, I can do that.<eos> All done.<eos> Have you got it?
Analysis of what you got from Greco?<eos> Evidence from the workshop suggests the drone we secured was one of four built for him.<eos> I believe Barofski has the other three and the bio.<eos> The target?<eos> Until we can crack the guidance module on the drone we have, it's unknown to us.
Or like that aluminum foil hat that I like to wear on the weekends?<eos> It's more like the triangle than the hat, but we like to think it's much more than that.<eos> The 1954 Castle Bravo nuclear tests weren't tests.<eos> They were trying to kill something.<eos> I believe there's an ecosystem out there the likes of which we can't imagine. And the place to find it is this island. A place where myth and science meet.
Whatever you tell us, stays in this room. I think I speak for everyone.<eos> Well, what is the worst thing you could do?<eos> Tell them your darkest secret.<eos> Because, if you tell them, and they decide they rather not know... You can't take it back. You can't unsay it.<eos> Once you've opened your heart, you can't close it again.
Sherlock, you okay?<eos> - Watch him. He's got a knife.<eos> - Got a what?<eos> Got a scalpel.<eos> You picked it up from that table. I saw you take it.
Shot me during a session.<eos> - Only with a tranquiliser. - Mmm.<eos> Still had 10 minutes to go.<eos> Well, we'll see about a refund.<eos> Right, you two, Wiggins has got your money by the gate, don't spend it all in one crack den.
And I continued building from there... layer by layer... the very planet you walk on now.<eos> Whoa. But I wanted more.<eos> I desired... meaning.<eos> "There must be some life out there in the universe... "besides just me," I thought.<eos> And so, I set myself the task of finding it.
Whoa! Yes! It's okay.<eos> Just relax.<eos> Concentrate.<eos> You can do it.<eos> Bring it back.
We are forever.<eos> Doesn't eternity get boring?<eos> Not if you have a purpose, Peter... which is why you're here.<eos> I told you how all those years ago... I had an unceasing impulse to find life.<eos> But what I did not tell you was how, when I finally did find it... it was all so... disappointing.
Yes, yes, everything is fine.<eos> But you have to wear this.<eos> It's a special edition, custom-made, just for you.<eos> Look.<eos> The CEO even autographed it.
- I tried, but Bane was in there.<eos> - So?<eos> He had sort of a "get out of this bathroom now" vibe.<eos> I knew I shouldn't have given you that water.<eos> Can you hold it in like a big boy?
You're amazing.<eos> Play time's over.<eos> Let's get going.<eos> We need your phone to take pics.<eos> - You got it?
- Stop with your crazy story.<eos> - We have a real problem.<eos> - This is a real problem.<eos> Have you seen the video of you apologizing?<eos> I've seen it. we're probably over six million views.
She's keeping those people enslaved.<eos> We have to do something.<eos> The beggar.<eos> He said they leave for their evening meal around now, right?<eos> As soon as the building's empty, we'll sneak in and we'll burn it to the ground.
Yeah.<eos> So?<eos> Sodium pentothal.<eos> Truth serum.<eos> - If you get it for me...
look.<eos> He's... just like he did with Ward.<eos> He won't stop until he destroys our family.<eos> I will not let that lying piece of shit take what is rightfully mine.<eos> Then look me in the eye... and tell me you didn't do it.
That was awesome!<eos> Wait, that was your wish you used up...<eos> For me?<eos> We can't keep carrying this thing around with us.<eos> It's too dangerous. We should leave it in a place where it's gonna be safe.
But maybe you won't.<eos> But your ability to get through it... as this gets harder... that is a hundred times more powerful than slapping a smile on your face and pretending like everything's just fine.<eos> Do you understand?<eos> Hey, listen... no one can give you your life back, Aaron.<eos> You have... You gotta take it back.
- Just take the stuff!<eos> - Hey, hey, we're really sorry.<eos> Too late for that.<eos> - Okay!<eos> Okay! - We'll put it back.
Your judgment has always been clouded when it comes to your old disciples.<eos> Just because I don't blind my disciples, doesn't mean I'm made weak by them.<eos> - It's good to see you.<eos> - Save it. - We have a situation.<eos> - We know, and we plan to correct it.
What do you want us to do with all the food?<eos> - How much is left?<eos> - Half.<eos> I thought more people would come.<eos> Um, take it for yourself, give it to the staff.
I thought more people would come.<eos> Um, take it for yourself, give it to the staff.<eos> Not the alcohol!<eos> Um, throw the rest away.<eos> Maybe I could give it to the church instead?
- Thank god you're here.<eos> - What's happening?<eos> Honey, it's as bad as what daddy did.<eos> They're hurting the animals.<eos> All right, we got 90 days to get this horse tame enough that someone will buy it.
- Beets are in season.<eos> - Looks delicious.<eos> Any trouble giving the horses glucosamine?<eos> Um, I saw a vet and...<eos> And he said they don't really need it, so you decided to give it back to me.
New blood!<eos> $24,000 I am bid.<eos> Do I hear $25,000?<eos> That money was for you.<eos> And now it'll go to someone who needs it.
Oh, this oughtta be good<eos> Use God's eye.<eos> We put our lives on the line.. Running around the world trying to figure this thing out<eos> It can find anybody, right?<eos> Let's use it to find Dom
Your family's already replacing you<eos> You chose the loosing team<eos> I guess your brother is smarter than you<eos> Smart move embedding God's eye into the mainframe<eos> Irritating to make me have to come all the way down here to get it, but
No no no no, this is not good<eos> What's the matter Roman, you forgot the snow tyre?<eos> Loving that Lambo now?<eos> Alright everyone, hold you with that launch trip later<eos> Right now I want that sub in deep water, where no one can find it
We got this<eos> That's my girl<eos> The sub's too close<eos> We ain't making it to the gate in time<eos> We just gonna let it get away?
They... Barry. Barry.<eos> Barry?<eos> Fuck.<eos> Fucking phone died. Perfect.<eos> Take a picture, and post it on Bri-Baby's Twitter fuck.
It sucks, but...<eos> I don't think retreating into your shell is doing you a lot of good.<eos> Listen, I'm telling you this from personal experience, okay?<eos> Life goes by really fast.<eos> If you half-ass it now, you're gonna feel it later.
Where perhaps our lawyers could pick it apart?<eos> It's yet to surface, Sir Stuart. And...<eos> I believe only the original exists.<eos> So, our lengthy negotiations with the daughter were in vain.<eos> If the will has not been read and Nootka is so strategic to us, why don't we just... burn it?
Those who use it will do almost anything for it, when their supply is exhausted.<eos> The name of the powder is Colonnade.<eos> And you have samples?<eos> Indeed.<eos> Perhaps I could show you in person how to apply it for best advantage?
"Brace, do you have any idea where I can find ma ain death warrant?"<eos> I may need to prove to a tribunal that the land was acquired by treaty and not by conquest.<eos> Tribunal?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Or they'll proudly try to seize it and claim it as a spoil of war.
I flagged him down at St Pancras.<eos> I told him two shillings. I guessed you'd pay.<eos> Hold on.<eos> Nitrous oxide. They call it "laughing gas".<eos> I provide it for entertainment at society parties.
Until that happy resolution, I bid you good day, gentlemen.<eos> Mount up!<eos> To the Molly House!<eos> I cannot pack up my entire life in five minutes.<eos> Well, you can pack it up or you can lose it.
And not only can we not resolve this disaster by killing Delaney, it is now in our urgent interest to keep the bastard alive.<eos> Get four nails and a wooden board and a man called Solomon Coop into this room by tomorrow at noon.<eos> Can you manage that?<eos> By midday, Mr. Pettifer.<eos> I do what I can with the rotten dock trash Atticus brings, so the least you can do is sit before you refuse it.
I believe that a man is capable of change... and I also believe that that is of no consequence to you.<eos> And whilst you're here, this document will show you... that my ship is already insured by an insurance broker by the name of Cope.<eos> And, if you look very closely, you will probably recognise my handwriting.<eos> I wonder, does the offer of coffee still stand?<eos> You know... it excites me, the thought of it... when I realise the woman beneath me... is capable of what she did.
We are trying to make this Blu-ray player work.<eos> Do you know how they function?<eos> Normally, you have those wires with the red, the yellow and the white plug.<eos> But this machine seems only to have this wire.<eos> I can't find where to plug it into the television.
Yeah, my wife, too.<eos> She's got one. We both have one.<eos> We love it.<eos> My first car was a Taurus.<eos> My father bought it.
- Jesus H. Christ.<eos> - Just dial the number again.<eos> I'll talk.<eos> - Right. Copy.<eos> Thanks, Bernie. Let's assume this is happening. I'll give you the green light soon as I get it.
Please try your call again later<eos> Hi, honey, you're home.<eos> Have you seen my wallet anywhere?<eos> Yeah, I just saw it in your room.<eos> You must've left without it.
This place is awfully cute.<eos> We, uh...<eos> I... I like it.<eos> I'd love to see the house.<eos> Oh, yeah, well, I'd love to show it to you. It's just a little bit of a mess right now, so.
Just like they did.<eos> I'm sorry, Mother.<eos> - You wanna tell me what happened?<eos> - I don't know. Condom broke?<eos> You sure you wanna keep it?
Frank!<eos> I love you!<eos> All right.<eos> Nope.<eos> I didn't buy it from him.
What's going on?<eos> Saw your video online.<eos> You were awesome.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Oksana recorded it on her Razr, so the quality's shit, but 84 views.
I promise someone's listening now.<eos> Well, it all started with a pothole.<eos> So this next song is written by one of my superfans.<eos> Her name is Diwata Jones.<eos> I thought I'd sing it and send some love back her way... since she loves everything I post on Twitter.
Break the sword.<eos> Does anyone else want to do the negotiating?<eos> Break the sword.<eos> I'll break the sword.<eos> I'll break it right in... Hayden.
You know, I was in pretty bad shape when you found me.<eos> I don't really have a clear picture of where I was.<eos> I marked the territory.<eos> Visually.<eos> I marked it visually.
Indeed.<eos> You can roll this painting up and put it in your carry-on.<eos> No matter where you take it in the world, it's worth 14.<eos> There's no better way to get cash across the border.<eos> Perfect, I'll take it.
Yeah.<eos> - So were you and her...<eos> - No.<eos> Gabriel said a few of us were gonna be chosen for this experiment.<eos> If you just heard the way he described it.
It sounds crazy, but I'm just...<eos> The tape is the doorway to the other side.<eos> Then why did she die?<eos> You have seven days before you die.<eos> You just have to watch the tape and make a copy, and show it to someone else.
I wanted to believe that tape meant a lot of things.<eos> That our souls are eternal, and when we die, the spirit strives to find a new home.<eos> Then I saw the picture.<eos> I saw Skye's face.<eos> You saw it, too.
I mean, we're talking one or two frame still images, but there's more.<eos> There's video data condensed in the still frames.<eos> A video within the video?<eos> Well, there is now.<eos> I don't want you to watch it.
We're watching this together.<eos> End of discussion.<eos> Holt, whatever it is, I think it's intended for Julia alone.<eos> Look at me.<eos> I know you're upset that I watched it.
Starve them into submission?<eos> They used to starve themselves.<eos> 40 days, but not out of worship, but out of necessity.<eos> Hunger was an ancient form of prayer, and they've never been hungry.<eos> I mean, they just pluck their food out of the freezer, throw it in the microwave, watch it spin around.
"You have been chosen because of the physical advantages" "you've enjoyed your entire lifetime."<eos> "With your natural gifts and our determination," "we could both be part of something greater."<eos> "Something perfect."<eos> "The Coagula procedure is a man-made miracle."<eos> "Our order has been developing it for many, many years,"
It's not a memory, Will.<eos> What?<eos> On his left arm in that exact spot, there was a different tattoo.<eos> - How is that possible?<eos> - I don't know, but in the lab, I saw it.
So I did reach all of my goals.<eos> This is it.<eos> This is so exciting.<eos> Okay. I don't want to hurt anything.<eos> I'm gonna open it very carefully.
Can anybody give me an example of this?<eos> Anyone.<eos> Clay.<eos> - Yeah, an example would be like slang.<eos> - Mm-hmm. If somebody starts saying some word, eventually everybody's saying it.
Well, stay tuned to hear about the skeletons he dug up.<eos> For now... let's see if he's got any of his own.<eos> I get that it's a thrill... looking into someone's life.<eos> My heart's pounding right now.<eos> Can you hear it?
Dude, listen, take your shot and pass those things on, man.<eos> You'll feel better.<eos> We need to get this window fixed, Tyler.<eos> It's time.<eos> They're just gonna break it again.
I don't know.<eos> But I'll help.<eos> Girls.<eos> I didn't realize you were taking photography.<eos> Yep, the project is all about contrast, which is why we have to do it at night, and which is why I have to sleep over.
Well, I'm defending the school.<eos> But you're a parent of a kid at the school.<eos> I think that's one reason the partners asked me to take the case.<eos> So you're going to try to prove that Hannah wasn't bullied.<eos> The school's position is that they didn't know about any bullying, and they would have stopped it if they had.
Show is over.<eos> Go to class!<eos> Where you going, Clay?<eos> - Where's my bike?<eos> - I'm gonna hold onto it for a while.
We rely on connections to survive.<eos> Even the most basic social interactions help keep us alive.<eos> Statistics prove the subjective feeling of loneliness can increase the likelihood of premature death by 26%.<eos> If it sounds like I'm quoting from a school textbook... I am.<eos> Too bad nobody bothered to read it.
What do you want, Ryan?<eos> We're legitimately closed.<eos> I have something for you.<eos> A peace offering.<eos> Take it.
Why would she write something like this?<eos> So humiliating.<eos> It has been brought to my attention that Ryan's publication now includes poetry.<eos> And since we're doing sonnets this semester, and since you're all going to be distracted by it anyway, I thought we would take a minute to parse the work of this poet.<eos> There's a sort of naked vulnerability to it that I like.
Okay, hang on.<eos> This isn't a school-sanctioned publication.<eos> This is one of the students' independent art projects.<eos> It's distributed on campus.<eos> Teachers were discussing this poem in class when they should have been getting help for the kid that wrote it.
It's distributed on campus.<eos> Teachers were discussing this poem in class when they should have been getting help for the kid that wrote it.<eos> Okay, to be fair, this was published anonymously.<eos> Did anyone try to find out who wrote it?<eos> Or ask whoever it is that put it in there?
I thought that's what you wanted.<eos> Not like this.<eos> MR. PORTER: Hey, Ryan, thanks for coming in.<eos> I wanted to ask you a question about this poem.<eos> Do you remember where it came from?
I wanted to ask you a question about this poem.<eos> Do you remember where it came from?<eos> Someone slipped it into my locker last year.<eos> - Yeah, I thought it was well-written.<eos> So you didn't actually find it on campus.
Oh, right. I'll come back.<eos> No, no, stay.<eos> You can help.<eos> Do you know how to tap a keg?<eos> Every guy's like, let's get a keg, and when it's time to tap it...
Bye.<eos> Gary?<eos> Hi.<eos> Listen, the Bakers considered our offer to settle.<eos> And they've turned it down.
The peace we have with the Saviors is uneasy, but it is peace.<eos> I have to hold on to it.<eos> I have to try.<eos> Although the Kingdom cannot grant you the aid you desire, the King is sympathetic to your plight.<eos> I offer our friend Daryl asylum for as long as he requires it.
I... found a... found a machine shop with the necessary...<eos> I-I read a lot, and, um...<eos> Although my...<eos> Even though my memory is not considered eidetic, I don't skim and I don't scrimp.<eos> If knowledge is dropped, I do, indeed, pick it up.
The walkers in the field, they're not closed in.<eos> Yeah.<eos> We got to take care of the ones out here and block that gap, too, so we can take the rest slow.<eos> Seven, eight... nine...<eos> That car... I can block it up.
I know the royal garden is important to you.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Thank you, Nabila.<eos> Do what must be done.<eos> Here's the beautiful thing, Your Majesty -- You can tear it out and cut it down.
I'm sorry.<eos> Thank you, Nabila.<eos> Do what must be done.<eos> Here's the beautiful thing, Your Majesty -- You can tear it out and cut it down.<eos> You can burn it and throw it all away.
But that's not the way it's got to go.<eos> Unh-unh. Just the opposite.<eos> See, this... Well, this could be the beginning.<eos> This knife is yours now.<eos> You can try to use it, take me out, but considering I am standing above you, holding a baseball bat, that doesn't seem real smart.
Unh-unh. Just the opposite.<eos> See, this... Well, this could be the beginning.<eos> This knife is yours now.<eos> You can try to use it, take me out, but considering I am standing above you, holding a baseball bat, that doesn't seem real smart.<eos> Now, you can use it to slit your wrists, which would be a damn shame, but I get it.
If you can take them out, that's where we start.<eos> You kill them, I'll radio back to the sanctuary.<eos> The sanctuary?<eos> Where negan lives.<eos> That's what they call it.
He's frustrated, and so am I.<eos> - What can I do?<eos> - Make him an offer.<eos> - I'll make him a verbal offer.<eos> - Write it down.
Actually, scratch that.<eos> I know you're gonna love it. Why? We've got new construction.<eos> Well, look at this.<eos> We have the en suite in the master that your wife, um, Lindsay, wanted so much.<eos> Anyway, give me a call, and I can show it today.
So, what do you got?<eos> I tracked the signal from your phone, this is where it ends.<eos> Probably where the battery died.<eos> What?<eos> I don't get it.
Ron Skinner's signature is all over the paperwork.<eos> Nico he hired thugs to intimidate farmers... Into selling their land.<eos> What about Reynosa?<eos> And your money... of attorney to purchase the land.<eos> And he's been using all of you to depreciate land values... By creating environmental roadblocks. All so he could purchase it for pennies on the dollar.
- America.<eos> - Well in America normally when you lend somebody money...<eos> - if that were us, he's saying, in your shoes, well I'd expect the money back with interest.<eos> Which we're happy to...<eos> Like I say we got it.
- Can I run the siren?<eos> - Once, on the highway.<eos> - Hey you got a phonebook?<eos> - Ya.<eos> - Can I borrow it?
- No, no mom!<eos> - I gotta, I'm chief.<eos> Like I said lock the door.<eos> If you see anyone you lean on the horn okay.<eos> Anybody tries for you, use the pepper spray just like I taught you, it's in the glove.
You.<eos> I love you, Carley.<eos> Cool!<eos> Okay, so, I'm recording this video for posterity, so if anyone, Sam,<eos> Riley, finds this, do not watch it or post it under penalty of death.
I love you, Carley.<eos> Cool!<eos> Okay, so, I'm recording this video for posterity, so if anyone, Sam,<eos> Riley, finds this, do not watch it or post it under penalty of death.<eos> Yeah, so there it is.
- It's great.<eos> - Nice windows.<eos> It's really open. The feng shui is all right.<eos> But more importantly, do you like it?<eos> We love it.
Nobody's buying any paintings.<eos> I don't mean "nobody," I mean you people.<eos> No family can buy art.<eos> I don't want any part of your pity ponchos or your pity purchases.<eos> If you love a piece, I will give it to you free of charge.
-That's not the point.<eos> That's right. That's not the...<eos> Son, read my lips.<eos> You're in a shit storm, and we're the ones holding out the umbrella.<eos> You gonna take it?
Rabbi Nachman believed the Jewish victims of the massacre of Uman were lost souls.<eos> 1768 in Ukraine, untold thousands killed by the Cossack.<eos> Women and children...<eos> Their bodies dumped in a hole and forgotten.<eos> When rabbi Nachman first visited Uman, he saw the mass grave, and he called it a garden.
Shane said he made a video.<eos> Of what?<eos> I don't know, supposed to be protection.<eos> In case he decided to say no.<eos> He stashed it in a bus locker.
They come every day.<eos> Tammy leaves seeds for them.<eos> Mind if I... $471 and 26 cents.<eos> What was he doing with all that cash?<eos> You want it?
Fuck me, fuck me for ordering it in the first place, right?<eos> We all have a role to play, Caleb.<eos> All of us.<eos> It doesn't matter if we don't like it.<eos> Or if it doesn't fit us. What matter is that we do it.
The 77 line is my new temporary housing.<eos> Runs 24 hours, and it's never empty.<eos> Makes it harder to shoot me.<eos> Why does somebody think. PJ's program is worth killing for?<eos> Do you even understand what Bathwater is? - What it does? - Yeah.
Mr. McCauley, that is an awful lot of air fresheners. Wouldn't you agree?<eos> Well, numbers are relative, Lesley.<eos> To say anything else would be conjecture.<eos> But the DA's office is in possession of this video, correct?<eos> Yes, we are. What we're curious about is how you came by it.
Somebody knows.<eos> Crys, leave this.<eos> I don't want you getting involved.<eos> They told me about this drug that you took.<eos> Why are you taking it?
- Don't.<eos> I need you to go, Pernell.<eos> Everything looks good.<eos> Got to say, Ms. Graham, I thought this place was a lost cause.<eos> I'm impressed you were able to rescue it.
I'll help you...<eos> Thank you.<eos> He's right.<eos> You did a fantastic job, KD.<eos> I burned it.
Thank you.<eos> He's right.<eos> You did a fantastic job, KD.<eos> I burned it.<eos> I got to make it right.
What could she prove?<eos> What can she prove?<eos> Nothing.<eos> And I wouldn't worry about the video.<eos> Pernell Harris doesn't have it.
That license plate was given to me by PJ.<eos> He's the one that sent us here.<eos> - For what?<eos> - For the video. The one Heather Caldwell was tellin' me about.<eos> Didn't you say he said he had it?
"About what?" Are you kidding me?<eos> About the tape. Does he know?<eos> - I want the recording back.<eos> You'll have it.<eos> I knew you'd find a way to pull it out.
No.<eos> I'm moving in.<eos> You liked it that much?<eos> It's not that.<eos> I can't sell it.
Shane Caldwell secretly recorded that.<eos> - Dear Lord.<eos> - Do you see now?<eos> That video is what set me free.<eos> And I would never have found it if God wasn't directing me.
I'm not on his side.<eos> Sekou's facing 15 years in prison here.<eos> You're on a side.<eos> You gave him $5,000, which you're saying was for a man in Africa, a jihadi.<eos> And if that's what the money was for and Sekou took it, tell Simone and tell me, and we'll listen.
- Down. - What the fuck is this?<eos> Quiet.<eos> Majid?<eos> Still smoking those damn things, are ya?<eos> Even when they showed me your picture, I couldn't believe it.
Carrie, did you hear me?<eos> He's in direct violation of the terms of our deal.<eos> - Yeah, I heard you.<eos> - No telling how the Feds will react.<eos> You need to get over there, tell him to take it down.
You're 20 years old and angry, so I'm gonna forgive you for saying that.<eos> What do you want?<eos> I told you, take down the video.<eos> Can't do that.<eos> You leave it up, and you're just waving a red flag in front of the FBI and thumbing your nose at all the people who believed in you.
Who knew I was coming to New York?<eos> No one.<eos> No one?<eos> Then who was aware of our meeting in the West Bank?<eos> The Israelis suspected it.
Gentlemen, I have your passports.<eos> Welcome to New York.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I want political asylum.<eos> I can put you in front of someone who can make it happen.
That is not true.<eos> He was running toward a fallen comrade to save that man's life.<eos> That act, which was attested to by six soldiers who were actually there-- that act cost my son his life and won him the Silver Star.<eos> Whoever made the video is not only trying to undo that and damage him personally, but to damage my presidency.<eos> I call on the actual cowards, the people who made it, to come out of the shadows and show their faces.
I'm told you took a video while I was here of Mr. O'Keefe and me.<eos> I didn't.<eos> Where is it?<eos> Nowhere. Ah.<eos> You deleted it from your phone.
I didn't.<eos> Where is it?<eos> Nowhere. Ah.<eos> You deleted it from your phone.<eos> Did you, uh... send it somewhere?
Because you invited me.<eos> Well, I've often invited you, but, usually, you prefer the loving arms of the mainstream media.<eos> Trust me, I have taken some beatings from the mainstream media.<eos> I'm here because a video was released last night which viciously slandered my dead son.<eos> I challenged the people responsible for making it to show their faces, and you did.
So, here I am.<eos> You do know it's not slander if it's true?<eos> It's not true.<eos> Not true.<eos> Have you seen it?
There's a photo of Sekou with his mom and sister on the visor.<eos> It's what you've been asking for-- an actual prosecutable case.<eos> Quinn handed it to us.<eos> His immunity deal covers everything, right?<eos> We'll make it work.
I'm of Bebbanburg.<eos> Yes, you are. You are.<eos> Is it your intention to build an army?<eos> Oh, last night I was still a slave.<eos> Build an army and I will command it, but only if it's your intention to go against all the lords of the north Kjartan.
I thought burpees were just baby burps, - which is something I'm very...<eos> - good at. You're late, Lonny!<eos> Man, Dev, sorry, brother.<eos> It's just, like, someone swiped my recumbent bicycle. But it's cool.<eos> I'm sure he needed it more than me, and the universe will pay me back, like when I found that sock.
Does it feel this real because we're so close?<eos> It helps.<eos> Money flows into this fine city constantly from all over the planet.<eos> I'm not talking about a trickle or a stream.<eos> - You have to want it.
Why?<eos> Maybe everything would be easier for you if I wasn't...<eos> No. No, don't you dare.<eos> I don't know when my life became so confusing.<eos> I don't know how to fix it.
Listen, remember that thing we talked about last night, your... your situation?<eos> Yeah. Mm-hmm.<eos> I'm involved in my own. And I would have mentioned it last night, but, you know, she has so much to lose, and I...<eos> Anyway, her phone is in my fuckin' car, all right?<eos> And if anyone finds it...
Right this way.<eos> I forgot how good food tastes.<eos> Well, now that we've got a home, I'll be able to cook you genuine, home cooked meals.<eos> So, tell me some more about that psychic stuff you're studying.<eos> Forget about it. You guys are just gonna think it's bullshit an way.
You know, you could probably leave your boxes packed.<eos> Easier to clear out when MCC calls and fires you.<eos> Where the hell did you put my radio and the goddamn phone cord?<eos> I gotta shut this fucking alarm, and I can't reach my people.<eos> Where'd you put it?
We need to get Calvin back behind Firewall One, and once he's there, we can pull Rory out.<eos> Fuck this.<eos> Permission to fucking kill the thing.<eos> Commander?<eos> Kill it.
Yeah.<eos> Go, go, go!<eos> It's squeezing harder.<eos> Calvin cracked the coolant system in her suit.<eos> Commander, Calvin knows exactly what it's doing.
Initiating emergency escape sequence in five, four, three, two, one.<eos> Come on, Miranda, get going.<eos> Initiating manual override.<eos> This is Dr. Miranda North, black box recording in case of death upon reentry.<eos> The creature killed four of the six ISS astronauts, with a fifth, Dr. David Jordan, presumed dead, carrying it out into deep space.
The creature killed four of the six ISS astronauts, with a fifth, Dr. David Jordan, presumed dead, carrying it out into deep space.<eos> My five colleagues all sacrificed themselves to maintain the firewall, so, please, honor them for giving everything to this cause.<eos> Mars life-forms should be considered hostile.<eos> Do not underestimate their intelligence and their adaptive capabilities.<eos> Now, we did not learn how to restrain or eliminate it, but if this creature ever reaches Earth, use every available resource to destroy it, or you will risk all human life.
I guess the expensive doesn't like Virginia.<eos> Why are you laughing?<eos> This is a problem.<eos> You'll have to fix that wheel.<eos> We're gonna have to find it first.
Run faster! Faster!<eos> My photo.<eos> My photo with Matteo Godardes.<eos> You idiot!<eos> Why didn't you send it to me?
Let's go to the police.<eos> They don't have security cameras.<eos> Did he try the "Find your iPhone" app?<eos> Uh, so there is no security cameras, but he asked if you tried the "find your iPhone" program.<eos> No, I turned it off 'cause of international data. Oh.
They don't have security cameras.<eos> Did he try the "Find your iPhone" app?<eos> Uh, so there is no security cameras, but he asked if you tried the "find your iPhone" program.<eos> No, I turned it off 'cause of international data. Oh.<eos> Uh... He turned it off because it'd be expensive for international data.
Be quiet.<eos> I'll do the talking.<eos> My friend's phone is stolen.<eos> Did anyone sell a phone to you today?<eos> We'll never find it!
My battery is low.<eos> Get out of here!<eos> Ah!<eos> Mamma mia! What's the problem?<eos> Just charge it later!
I couldn't leave without seeing you, Zelda.<eos> Well, we have to speak.<eos> I didn't get a chance to talk to you about your book.<eos> It doesn't matter.<eos> Scribner's rejected it. It's dead.
All right.<eos> Sheriff Greene!<eos> You get some rest.<eos> I'm gonna go down and check out the office.<eos> We can get it all set up tomorrow.
Happy birthday, love.<eos> - How is she doing?<eos> - Ask her.<eos> Here's your gift, love.<eos> - Can I exchange it?
I can't look.<eos> Neither can I.<eos> What will you do if you are?<eos> Have an abortion, right?<eos> - No, I'll have it. - What?
He started touching my legs to take the ants off and he pulled my skirt up.<eos> I was hysterical because I hate ants.<eos> And he knew that.<eos> He was making it all up.<eos> In fact, he took a photo and said if I didn't undress he'd post it online and my parents would see it.
- Come on.<eos> - I can think of something.<eos> What?<eos> The parcel.<eos> You swore you didn't open it!
Did we put any pressure on you to study law?<eos> Did we say anything?<eos> No.<eos> We said it was a personal decision.<eos> If you've started law, you have to finish it.
What happened to my picture?<eos> I... just tidying up.<eos> I accident...<eos> i bumped into it.<eos> I can... look, I can replace it.
Just Gus.<eos> - So, no other female friends?<eos> - No.<eos> I cut up a rabbit once.<eos> When I was eight, I found a dead rabbit in the yard, and I picked it up with a plastic bag, and then I cut it into small pieces, and I put the pieces in a bowl in the shed.
This stuff has got glycerin in it.<eos> What is that thing? This?<eos> It's an explosive trace detector.<eos> Now, I am reprogramming it.<eos> Normally, you would actually screen the glycerin out so you don't end up with a false positive, but I am actually changing it to screen the glycerin in.
Anything?<eos> Th-This is not the appropriate device.<eos> I-I'm not a medical doctor.<eos> I'm not processing with my usual...<eos> So you're saying you can't find it?
I don't know. I...<eos> I mean, I do remember things.<eos> I-I remember watching Cam propose to you, how happy you looked.<eos> I remember that you used to carry a cigarette behind your ear to remind you of your father.<eos> I remember... how proud you were when your book was published, even though I found it to be rather mawkish.
She's seven feet tall?<eos> What?<eos> Seven and oh. She's won seven times and lost none.<eos> She just beat this Brazilian chick. Split her face open. It was fuckin' crazy.<eos> Anyway, she stole my car and she said it's because I deserved it or something.
Can't say for sure, but it seems like they might be kickin' in.<eos> Okay. This is gonna be fun.<eos> Are they kicking' in?<eos> We're free to share bad thoughts here, right?<eos> I don't want to ruin your trip, but I feel like if I, like, keep bad stuff in my head and don't share it, then I'm gonna have a bad trip.
He'll show me my destiny.<eos> Gus knows what I'm talkin' about.<eos> The coyote.<eos> My legacy.<eos> He knows it.
This is Mr. Felbeck's suite.<eos> As you can see, we provide very spacious accommodations for all of our residents... uh, excuse me, what exactly is that?<eos> An A.L.S. I'm looking for blood evidence.<eos> You didn't clean anything up, did you, Francis?<eos> I can assure you, the room is exactly how Mr. Felbeck left it.
That is not the original bumper.<eos> Okay, uh, let's run a search.<eos> It's from a '77 Cadillac Coupe de Ville.<eos> Wow. That is a heavy, strong bumper.<eos> That car may look like hell on wheels, but you can't beat it in terms of toughness.
Well, now, aren't you a sight?<eos> You're sure no one followed you?<eos> I've been avoiding trouble since well before you were born.<eos> Now, where's that little girl?<eos> Did you find it?
When your barf is clear and it doesn't burn anymore. Oh.<eos> I wish I could barf. I'm only good at the binging part.<eos> - You purge?<eos> - I tried. It's not my thing.<eos> So, how do you get rid of it if you can't barf?
Right, and I think a lot of it was misdiagnosed.<eos> With the Alzheimer's or dementia, it takes several years you see the progression, but, to make it easier, these doctors just sign off on it as dementia or, Alzheimer's without actually taking a biopsy of the brain<eos> to see if it's that or is it actually a prion disease like Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease or, mad cow disease.<eos> Do you think it's safe to eat meat?<eos> I personally don't think it's safe to eat it because of the fact how the line speeds are increasing and also our inspectors are not well trained enough.
So the fool got an idea he had a shot at Karolina.<eos> Wasn't thinking about anything else.<eos> So I got the smack pit out without having to kiss the dog.<eos> Handed her off to Joseph, and before I had time to wash my hands, it was done.<eos> The phone was back in Mukherjee's pocket before he knew it was gone.
I got that internship.<eos> What internship?<eos> To work with undocumented immigrants?<eos> Oh, right.<eos> You got it?
It's like my salvation.<eos> I did it.<eos> I put her stuff in a box.<eos> Good.<eos> But then I didn't know if I should ship it.
I did it.<eos> I put her stuff in a box.<eos> Good.<eos> But then I didn't know if I should ship it.<eos> It seemed so formal or something, so I decided just bring it to her.
Ain't no law without blood.<eos> You don't see that yet, but you will.<eos> You don't know me.<eos> I know why you carry that goddamn diary around.<eos> I saw what you did to get it, and I... see... you.
But I just don't know who.<eos> But everything I do know is in that book.<eos> I don't expect you to believe it.<eos> Didn't believe it myself when I first found out.<eos> But if you do believe it, don't ignore it.
Can you say profit sharing?<eos> Let's get down to brass tacks.<eos> Synergy has touched us once again.<eos> This moves the needle.<eos> And bring it to the supervisor.
I wanna make a trade with you.<eos> Hey, no. Don't do that!<eos> Oh, oh, my God.<eos> Where'd you get that stuff?<eos> Can't say, but I'll share it with you if you do something for me.
Grace...<eos> Where did you get this?<eos> Grace, what the hell are you doing?<eos> This was Karma's locket.<eos> She would have never taken it off.
Where did you get this?<eos> Grace, what the hell are you doing?<eos> This was Karma's locket.<eos> She would have never taken it off.<eos> Now, this bitch better have a damn good explanation as to why she has it.
We'll do it your way.<eos> - That's... - You're still choking her.<eos> Back off, Barbie.<eos> - I didn't know it was Karma.<eos> - She left it behind when they checked her out of here.
It's nuclear-powered.<eos> Do you know, Terry, I've been looking for one of these for a long time. So why didn't you sell it?<eos> It's gotta be worth a fortune.<eos> This vehicle is a once-in-a-lifetime sort of thing, you don't sell it.<eos> You admire it.
Never doubted it.<eos> So, how was your fancy dinner?<eos> I can't wait to try this beef "bourbonnon."<eos> Bourguignon.<eos> We finished it.
They control their urges.<eos> You're thinking of Lucian Graymark, warlocks like Magnus Bane, and even...<eos> No matter how good they try to be,<eos> Downworlders cannot control their demonic blood forever.<eos> If that blood is so evil, why did you put it in me?
Do you have any other ideas?<eos> Put in a request for a maritime mission.<eos> Take out a vessel ourselves.<eos> Alec, the ship is glamoured. It won't show up on the sonar.<eos> Well, it can't hide from us if we run right into it.
That's too sappy.<eos> Like a real-life Fault in Our Stars.<eos> That's not the plot of that book at all.<eos> - Really? - No.<eos> Oh, I never read it.
If Clary doesn't come and activate the Sword.<eos> You have to keep Clary away from that Sword.<eos> She's with Magnus.<eos> Luke and I are coming for it now.<eos> Just get to the power core. Shut it down.
Impossible.<eos> I saw it, too.<eos> He's telling the truth.<eos> You kill Clary, Valentine still has the damn Sword.<eos> Over time, no doubt, he'll find a way to activate it.
Clary to activate it.<eos> I'm losing my patience.<eos> - Simon, drink.<eos> - Stop them!<eos> If Jace touches the sword, his grip would destroy it.
If Jace touches the sword, his grip would destroy it.<eos> Jace's plan is gonna work.<eos> Let's move!<eos> Jace! It'll kill you!<eos> He activated it.
I'm sorry.<eos> [chuckles] An apology from you.<eos> There's a first time for everything.<eos> [Raphael] So, you wore his shirt home and kept it for how long?<eos> You should be glad I kept it.
Huh. Longinus is the name generally associated with the Roman Centurion who pierced the side of Christ during the Crucifixion.<eos> Yeah, he was blind and got the blood of Jesus in his eyes, and then he could see again.<eos> - Look at you. - What?<eos> I went to Sunday school.<eos> Now that blood allegedly got on the medallion and empowered it and the spear with magical powers.
He left me.<eos> Because of you being Mr. Terrific?<eos> Because of me trying, but I'm never gonna make it because I don't have what it takes...<eos> So now I don't have anything.<eos> Keep your wrist straight just so you don't jam it.
I was able to track down cell phone footage of her latest act of heroism...<eos> Heroineism?<eos> Heroism. Anyway, take a look.<eos> The video isn't clear enough for facial recog, but she's real all right.<eos> I've watched it, like, 10 times.
Well, we can help you get him without anyone else dying in the process, including and especially you.<eos> You know, from what I hear, there are plenty of nut cases running around star city, looking to make it a better place.<eos> What makes me so special?<eos> If you stay in the same spot for more than a minute, and I'll get a chance to tell it.<eos> Well, if you're gonna make a sales pitch, make it good.
Dad, I didn't know you were coming today. I know.<eos> But we have sort of an important decision to make, and your mom usually handles this stuff, but she agreed we should have a good team meeting about it.<eos> Hi, babe.<eos> Hey, do you think maybe we could do, like, the team meeting in 15, 20 minutes, or...<eos> Could we just not do it at all?
That's not my name.<eos> It's the evil prince from Shrek.<eos> No, I'm still here.<eos> No. I'm not wearing this dress.<eos> But you were wearing it in the first part of the scene. The part we already shot.
I am the Green Arrow.<eos> Previously on "Arrow"...<eos> Really sorry about this, Sergeant.<eos> You're not here to secure the trigger.<eos> You're stealing it. Want to read your confession before you sign it?
- Quentin!<eos> - Hey.<eos> Oh, so good to see you.<eos> And you, too.<eos> I saw your interview with the dragon lady, and you nailed it.
What?<eos> My producer called me out on the carpet.<eos> Apparently, they received an anonymous tip that I have been plagiarizing my stories for the past two years, and my laptop is filled with incriminating evidence.<eos> Your laptop?<eos> It has all the fingerprints of a hatchet job.
Sounds to me like this could be a weapon.<eos> Ok, and is there a problem if it is?<eos> - It depends, Felicity.<eos> - On what?<eos> On how you use it.
Ahem. Ok. All right.<eos> Look.<eos> I appreciate what you're doing, but I'm fine.<eos> Mr. Mayor, all due respect, your head's bleeding, and our concussion protocol's even stricter than the NFL's.<eos> Well, I'm the mayor, so I'm suspending it.
- Yeah.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> So what happens next?<eos> You mean, what do I do with your secret?<eos> I keep it.
You think you and Prometheus had the same teacher?<eos> You're accepting the invitation to join Helix.<eos> Full throttle.<eos> What do I do with your secret?<eos> I keep it.
But first I have a gift for you.<eos> This tattoo of yours.<eos> To be an American and named a captain in the Bratva, you must have done something extraordinary.<eos> When you look at it, it must--it must remind you of such a victory.<eos> Now, when you look at it, you'll think about our time here together and the secret that you confessed to me.
I'm not staying in Russia.<eos> Because now anywhere you go in the world, any Bratva you meet will know what kind of man you are.<eos> I have another gift for you.<eos> Here.<eos> I recovered it from the casino.
He's got tech that prevents a camera from capturing his image?<eos> Like those scarves that celebrities use to frustrate paparazzi.<eos> Yeah.<eos> But here's the thing, if he's using a piece of tech...<eos> We can reverse engineer it.
I'm not discussing this, Johnny.<eos> Get your head in the game.<eos> You're two minutes out.<eos> Where has this tablet been all my life?<eos> I made it special for you.
You were right.<eos> I was starting to become like you and not in the heroic, honorable, muscular way. It was just after I lost Billy,<eos> I was willing to do whatever to get Chase.<eos> It drove me to work with Helix, and I was willing to break any rule or do anything to get payback, and, you know, what I'm trying to say is I think I got the tiniest taste of what you've been through, the tiniest.<eos> I get it now.
It drove me to work with Helix, and I was willing to break any rule or do anything to get payback, and, you know, what I'm trying to say is I think I got the tiniest taste of what you've been through, the tiniest.<eos> I get it now.<eos> I understand...<eos> Why you lied to me about William, why you had to.<eos> I get it, and for the extent that I judged you-- and I did judge you-- I'm sorry.
The chemicals Sampson stole are more refined than the ones Justin Claybourne used and could produce a biological agent a thousand times more powerful.<eos> - And without a cure.<eos> - How would Chase distribute it?<eos> It's aerosolized, so pretty much any way he wants.<eos> We have to find out where Chase is storing this thing and stop him before he releases it.
I never really took it seriously.<eos> Until now, right?<eos> Yeah. I have this really bad feeling.<eos> It's right in the pit of my stomach.<eos> What's it telling you?
Please, let's make the Downworlders feel welcome.<eos> Look at you. In charge for a week, you're already shaking things up.<eos> I think this Cabinet thing is a good idea.<eos> Yeah, I'm not sure everyone agrees.<eos> All the more reason to do it.
Thank you.<eos> Izzy never would have made it to Idris without your help.<eos> Alec, you and Isabelle and Max and Jace are the most important people in the world to me.<eos> I know I've lost your trust.<eos> I hope I can earn it back.
Here!<eos> We're leaving, and we will never drink your overpriced "Runaway Root Beers" again.<eos> But here's a nice tip because you gave us very good service.<eos> Where did that money come from?<eos> - Just be glad I had it.
You know how to make him feel good.<eos> - You got in late.<eos> - Yeah, it was a rough night.<eos> I can't believe we still live in this house.<eos> Hmm. You're the one who chose it.
He hasn't seen her.<eos> He was actually pretty concerned.<eos> He did mention an apartment on the Upper West Side.<eos> Apparently she was staying there.<eos> I'll go check it out, if I can ever get out of here tonight.
Aegon used to live here, and the Targaryens built this castle.<eos> Aye.<eos> So they did.<eos> I want us both to go home.<eos> But they took it from us.
Lord Tyrion has invited me to Dragonstone to meet with Daenerys.<eos> And I'm going to accept.<eos> We need this dragonglass, my lords!<eos> We know that dragonglass can destroy both white walkers and their army.<eos> We need to mine it and turn it into weapons.
Never ever ever.<eos> Not ever.<eos> Not not ever.<eos> Meat's going to slide off you sooner or later, dead wife.<eos> Sooner if you keep soaking it in hot water.
I think about turning back, then my curiosity gets the better of me.<eos> So I go towards it, only the closer I get, the farther away it goes.<eos> Finally, I turned around and I'd wandered so far into the moors, that I can't find me way back.<eos> Three hours, I wandered in the dark, and not a thing familiar, but then I remembered what me gran told me about the leprechaun.<eos> So, I swallow my hunger and I take my bread, and I put it down on a mossy stone, and I lay down to sleep beside it.
Would I could give you some of mine.<eos> You've got gold?<eos> Had.<eos> Quite a bit.<eos> Held it in keeping.
They said, "No, no, no."<eos> "The future is fixed, and you can't change it no matter how hard you try." Mm-hmm.<eos> Where do you come down?<eos> On a fixed or ever-changing future?<eos> Well, I think that a man often meets his destiny on the very road he takes to avoid it.
Yeah, it's growing on me.<eos> And this rifle is growing on me.<eos> Heat-seeking bullets are just the beginning of what this bad boy can do.<eos> How did you end up with Plunder's rifle?<eos> Barry stole it for me. Right, Barr?
I don't have it in me right now.<eos> I need you to get your blood into him.<eos> It'll counteract his cells and negate his powers.<eos> How am I supposed to do that when I can't even touch him?<eos> You're gonna phase it into him.
My God, who cares about cats or pianos - or the freaking "Peanuts"?<eos> - It's not "The Peanuts."<eos> It's just "Peanuts."<eos> You have been studying this thing for hours.<eos> Can we or can we not use it to track Savitar?
You won't feel a thing.<eos> Okay, let's get this show on the road.<eos> The disrupter is attached to your hippocampus. So, it's ready.<eos> Okay, ready for zapping.<eos> Can we not call it "zapping"?
No, I know.<eos> It doesn't exactly roll off the tongue.<eos> No, it doesn't.<eos> How about... we call this fancy device of yours...<eos> - You know, you probably shouldn't... - ... call it the...
There's gotta be something we can do.<eos> There is something we can do:<eos> jump-start his brain using that thing.<eos> We have not done a test run.<eos> - There's no time to test it now.
We got into a heated moment and threw something out the window.<eos> Maybe he should help you look for it, then.<eos> Oh, he took the morning off from work.<eos> Besides, he doesn't want me to have this thing, anyway.<eos> Honestly, I don't even know why I want it.
Maybe he should help you look for it, then.<eos> Oh, he took the morning off from work.<eos> Besides, he doesn't want me to have this thing, anyway.<eos> Honestly, I don't even know why I want it.<eos> 'Cause whenever I have it, I just feel better.
I'll meet you there.<eos> You talk to Bonnie?<eos> I've left so many messages.<eos> She just won't answer her phone...<eos> I don't get it.
What's it to you?<eos> Well, Matt here has been getting visions because of that journal; and you show up looking for it.<eos> Coincidence?<eos> I think not.<eos> So why don't you tell us the real reason you want it.
What's he want with it?<eos> I don't know.<eos> But if it saves my brother's life, I don't care.<eos> Sorry.<eos> You don't give the devil what he wants if you don't know why he wants it.
I'm selfish.<eos> You have absolutely no idea... how important that journal was.<eos> I'm gonna take a shot and say that it was an instruction manual to kill Cade.<eos> Oh, so you knew?<eos> And you gave it to him anyway. Yup.
Yesterday.<eos> At first, I thought it was some sick joke.<eos> Fans send bizarre letters to my manager all the time, but this was sent directly to my personal e-mail, and it was so... disturbing.<eos> I couldn't get it out of my head.<eos> - I had to check it out.
I'll take that.<eos> Thanks.<eos> "I'm a man of my word."<eos> The antidote.<eos> We need to test this and get it to Ashley now. Right.
- Yeah.<eos> The detective and I...<eos> Sorry... Chloe and I are real.<eos> I mean, I didn't think it could happen, but it has, and I've got this overwhelming sensation...<eos> I can't even describe it, but... I feel invincible.
Feisty?<eos> Yeah, yeah.<eos> Said she was Hayden's cousin.<eos> Crazy bitch threw a beer at me. Huh.<eos> Well, from what I heard, you earned it.
Yeah.<eos> You ever touch her again, I'll break your face.<eos> Nice work in there.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Yeah, that alibi -- I almost bought it.
I am sorry, Kelly.<eos> The son of Lucifer... this is a human/archangel hybrid.<eos> That power... it's beyond comprehension.<eos> Your child could bring the universe to its knees.<eos> Or lift it to its feet.
We fake it.<eos> I mean, I've read half a dozen purification rituals in the last hour.<eos> If we used one of those on -- on our blood...<eos> Then what?<eos> Revirginize it?
This is a colossally stupid idea.<eos> Yep.<eos> Big, beautiful, and dumb.<eos> I've had this thing for so long.<eos> Been waiting for the perfect moment to use it.
I'm gonna go with 11.<eos> Sounds right.<eos> You don't have to worry.<eos> The child, he opened this door.<eos> He'll close it.
Well... she is dead...<eos> - and also undead.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> What are you saying? She's a... zombie?<eos> I don't like that word, I think it's inherently negative.
- and also undead.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> What are you saying? She's a... zombie?<eos> I don't like that word, I think it's inherently negative.<eos> - I don't like it either.
You're not asking, I'm offering.<eos> I'm kissing up, actually.<eos> On one condition:<eos> your partner can never know that the money came from me.<eos> She would think it was pity, and she doesn't do pity.
Well, you are hereby rehired as my secretary with an 8% increase in salary.<eos> The Baudelaires will be sent to a suitable guardian and this series of unfortunate events has come to a close.<eos> [all cheering]<eos> As for you, Count Olaf... [audience gasps] I'll get my hands on your fortune if it's the last thing I do.<eos> And when I have it, I will tear you and your siblings from limb to limb.
I don't think it was a coincidence.<eos> I overheard Audrey talking to him, sayin' that he owed her.<eos> Why doesn't she just go to the cops?<eos> Let's just say... the Dockery money is not entirely kosher.<eos> We're supposed to report it if we get cash as collateral.
Yeah, uh, I'm an idiot.<eos> I... I left my wallet on the night stand at the hotel.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> I don't know what to do.<eos> Just call someone and have them run it over.
Seriously?<eos> Let's just call it the fallacy of sunk costs.<eos> So what now?<eos> Now?<eos> Now we, uh, take that PPD, and we shove it right up Chuck's ass.
- it's the first thing you did.<eos> - Kim... this is not how we do discovery.<eos> Actually, Jimmy destroyed the duplicate.<eos> Ah, it's fine, Howard.<eos> The original is under lock and key, and in due time, it will be put into evidence for your review.
Can you tell us where the nearest source is right now?<eos> Jimmy, do you have something in your pocket?<eos> Yes, I do, as a matter of fact.<eos> My cellphone.<eos> From this distance, you should feel it, and you don't, do you?
Lookit this guy.<eos> It's Alfred Hitchcock in a rented toupee. C'mon.<eos> Why would you rent a toupee?<eos> Y'know, from the Toupee Store.<eos> So you don't have to maintain it.
But you've... received an offer, right?<eos> Something sent to you in writing?<eos> I mean, something more than just Erin and you chatting?<eos> It's probably all here in this box.<eos> I can't make heads or tails of it, but you are welcome to look.
I'm not long on logistics.<eos> "Security consultant" would be better.<eos> I used to be a cop.<eos> That will look better on your "work history" than your current employer, SMQ Parking.<eos> So, you take my money, you run it through this joint, and it comes out clean.
It's too pink.<eos> It doesn't feel right anymore.<eos> No, I like how girly it is.<eos> Mine is, too.<eos> You should come over and see it sometime.
I'm gonna come clean with Weatherbee and Keller.<eos> I was there.<eos> I heard the gunshot and I have to own that.<eos> - Archie, slow down.<eos> - I'm gonna do it tomorrow.
Not even with your cushy new job working for your high-school boyfriend?<eos> My mom and dad don't want to get the police involved.<eos> They don't want anyone to know that she ran away, or about her shameful condition.<eos> Please. What decade is this?<eos> Also, since she knew where Jason's getaway car was, they're afraid people might think that she burned it and that if she did...
Nothing personal. Yeah, it never is with you guys. So what is it?<eos> The development? What?<eos> That land you're building on, it belonged to my family.<eos> We founded our maple empire on it.<eos> Now, we were in the process of trying to reacquire it, buy it back, when your mysterious boss, he, he just stole it right out from underneath us.
Who are all these people?<eos> Entre nous, they're Daddy's board of trustees.<eos> They smell blood in the water.<eos> That's why they're here.<eos> They're worried Daddy's losing his grip on the company and they're looking for a way to take it away from us.
I don't think that's an actual word.<eos> - It's a compliment, Mary. - Huh.<eos> I couldn't be seen in the same room with those two. Not after all their monkey business.<eos> Oh... Did you not know?<eos> You have been playing the same game since junior high and it was tired even back then.
I understand.<eos> I sure understand what it is to be lonely, although I don't have a choice.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> I don't need you to understand my life, Madeleine.<eos> I barely understand it myself.
The sheriff was just here.<eos> They're searching for the car.<eos> So what did you do with it?<eos> Don't worry.<eos> I hid it in the woods.
It's far enough.<eos> Okay, mother, get up.<eos> We are going to that car.<eos> Why, so you could be seen in the vicinity of it. And get caught?<eos> No, because we need to get rid of it. In a better way than just leaving it in the woods. Like the remains of a pie we didn't eat at a picnic.
Now.<eos> This is stupid, norman.<eos> Everything's fine. I took care of it.<eos> The car is deep in here somewhere. Where I know there's no foot traffic.<eos> No one's gonna find it.
This is stupid, norman.<eos> Everything's fine. I took care of it.<eos> The car is deep in here somewhere. Where I know there's no foot traffic.<eos> No one's gonna find it.<eos> We can't even find it!
Everything's fine. I took care of it.<eos> The car is deep in here somewhere. Where I know there's no foot traffic.<eos> No one's gonna find it.<eos> We can't even find it!<eos> That's exactly why we need to find it, mother.
I took off the plates.<eos> I scratched off the vin number.<eos> I wiped the whole thing down for fingerprints.<eos> I covered the car with brush, And I covered my tracks on the way back.<eos> No one is gonna find this car, and even if they do, They can't trace it back to us.
No one is gonna find this car, and even if they do, They can't trace it back to us.<eos> How do you know all of that?<eos> It's not rocket science.<eos> There it is.<eos> I think we should move it.
How do you know all of that?<eos> It's not rocket science.<eos> There it is.<eos> I think we should move it.<eos> Just get rid of it... Make it disappear.
Why can't I do anything right in your eyes?<eos> I'm sorry, mother.<eos> You were right.<eos> You were right; The car's fine.<eos> Let's just leave it and go home.
Especially on a night like this.<eos> Well, honestly, I could eat anything right now so whatever's easy.<eos> All righty, then.<eos> One easy sandwich coming up.<eos> You just get yourself settled and take off your wet shoes, and I'll be back as soon as it's ready.
I... I think you should go.<eos> Okay? Y...<eos> Y... you need to go right now.<eos> I... I... I saw the money.<eos> Okay, what... whatever you did to get it, you just... You just take it and you... and you get away.
Any more enbalming fluid, old man?<eos> It's under the bed.<eos> Ah. Of course.<eos> Close the door, Bunny!<eos> I think we should do it.
Chin up.<eos> You're in Montgomery, Zelda.<eos> You're at a dance at the country club.<eos> You bought that dress special for that occasion.<eos> And, even if your mama doesn't, you know the boys will love it.
Well, it's off and on.<eos> It... It's maddening.<eos> Well, you could play some music, sir.<eos> "How long did it take you to write your book? "asked the sturdy, broad-shouldered young man.<eos> "To write it, three months.
It... It's maddening.<eos> Well, you could play some music, sir.<eos> "How long did it take you to write your book? "asked the sturdy, broad-shouldered young man.<eos> "To write it, three months.<eos> "To conceive it..."
Class of '22. I'm so sorry to interrupt.<eos> I needed to get a book.<eos> Well, here is the only book you'll ever need to read.<eos> All of the smart young men are mad over it.<eos> I've, uh... I've read it twice.
Quite engaging prose.<eos> Yes. Now you can see how she inspires.<eos> Yes. Yes. Your Zelda has a voice.<eos> Really?<eos> Hell, I could see publishing it in its own right.
Which I have used already and to great effect.<eos> Yes, I know you have. Some of it...<eos> Certainly not worth squabbling over.<eos> Two wordsmiths under one roof.<eos> - What could be better? - My point is we both stand to benefit far more financially is I were to use that diary than if you were to publish it under your own name.
I'll survey the damage.<eos> I'm so, so, so, so sorry.<eos> Oh, I hope so.<eos> The car was expensive.<eos> Phil didn't have to buy it for you.
That's a mug at The Dot.<eos> Beside a tower of milk creamers?<eos> That's our thing.<eos> Seeing who can build the tallest tower.<eos> How can he do that without me and then post it when we're not speaking?
It should feel similar.<eos> Now... scooch down.<eos> While I'm down here... I'll apply a numbing medication.<eos> Like at the dentist?<eos> Well, hopefully she puts it in your gums.
- Yeah, I know that.<eos> - So we need to make things easier.<eos> There's already talk about you and Lola.<eos> If people see the play, there'll be more.<eos> And eventually, Tris will hear it.
I'm not supposed to see the suit...<eos> Yael says I need to earn back her trust, but she won't tell me how.<eos> What am I supposed to do, read her mind?<eos> You should read this book.<eos> I'm finding it very illuminating.
You hate me.<eos> That's not you talking, it's the disease!<eos> The book says you...<eos> Oh, stop talking about the stupid book, Mom.<eos> - I hate it!
Say something.<eos> Do you have the bouquet?<eos> It's almost time.<eos> - Yes.<eos> Uh, I'll go get it.
Not some, all. Everything.<eos> Liquidated, cash.<eos> $7,945,400.<eos> Sir, again, we don't keep that kind of money on-site.<eos> You... you can't just have it wired here, and then come by the bank and withdraw it.
No, I'll be back in six months with twice the money.<eos> I'm not explaining myself correctly.<eos> Just because it says the money is in your account doesn't mean it's really there, physically.<eos> I know how the banking system works.<eos> That's why I'm calling you in advance so you can get it.
Where's my money?<eos> As we told you, we can't cover that amount within 24 hours.<eos> There's two federal agents here.<eos> Which means you wouldn't take the chance that there was a kidnapping and not have my money.<eos> So if you don't produce it immediately, I'm gonna walk into that lobby, and I'm gonna tell these people that I can't get my money out.
- wouldn't necessarily recommend...<eos> - How expensive?<eos> We're talking in the hundreds.<eos> Listen, just keep working hard... and eventually you'll get there.<eos> You know if I had any cash, I'd give it to you.
Welcome, ladies and lords, to Castle Degrassi!<eos> This year's prom theme will be One Enchanted Evening.<eos> It will be a night of magic!<eos> This prom theme promises the perfect fairy-tale ending to our time at Degrassi.<eos> Love it!
Think you've got talent?<eos> Sign up in the foyer and be sure to show it.
I don't even know where to start.<eos> - What are you doing?<eos> - Mustache!<eos> Okay, let's get serious.<eos> Okay, uh, "Strip the wire and connect it to the..."
- A corsage is always nice.<eos> You are so lucky you're going to prom.<eos> - Tiny's gonna love you in this dress.<eos> - It shows every curve.<eos> Which is exactly why he'll love it.
Centuries of peace and prosperity with a Targaryen sitting on the Iron Throne and a Stark serving as Warden of the North.<eos> I am the last Targaryen, Jon Snow.<eos> Honor the pledge your ancestor made to mine.<eos> Bend the knee and I will name you Warden of the North.<eos> Together, we will save this country from those who would destroy it.
You can't expect us to halt hostilities and join you in fighting whatever you saw beyond the Wall.<eos> You don't believe him.<eos> I understand that.<eos> It sounds like nonsense.<eos> But if destiny has brought Daenerys Targaryen back to our shores, it has also made Jon Snow King in the North.
No more learning from my mistakes, eh?<eos> How will you do it?<eos> With that sword?<eos> That was Joffrey's sword, wasn't it?<eos> Not that he ever used it.
How will you do it?<eos> With that sword?<eos> That was Joffrey's sword, wasn't it?<eos> Not that he ever used it.<eos> What did he call it?
All of us, working together.<eos> Now, I'm sure cutting off heads is very satisfying, but that's not the way you get people to work together.<eos> And if Jon doesn't come back, you'll need their support... so you can work together to give you what you really want.<eos> How can you even think such a horrible thing?<eos> You're thinking it right now.
Lord Commander Mormont thought you'd never come back to Westeros.<eos> But you are back.<eos> And it's been in your family for centuries.<eos> It's not right for me to have it.<eos> He gave it to you.
I wish I could take it back.<eos> I wish we'd never go.<eos> I don't.<eos> If we hadn't gone I wouldn't have seen.<eos> You have to see it to know.
It wasn't hard for me to engineer a test cure.<eos> And now that I know it works, my team has my research and my blood.<eos> Your "merchandise," as you put it will soon be obsolete on the marketplace.<eos> I hate to say this, but your research is incomplete.<eos> If you had found the cure, you wouldn't have been attacked after you took it.
"If the outbreak is deemed uncontrollable tanks labeled with a green A contain the vaccine and are ready to deploy.<eos> Location classified."<eos> All we have to do is find that stuff and we can change everyone back.<eos> Like flipping a safety switch.<eos> But if you were Arias, where would you keep it?
For the Legion! For the Legion!<eos> Okay, that's gonna have to do.<eos> Ow! God.<eos> I'm gonna get this thing working.<eos> - Let's do it.
What, just because I've been to jail, I know how to hot-wire a car?<eos> Okay, I do, but it's not the same.<eos> It's our only chance.<eos> Talk me through it quick.<eos> You wanna take out the yellow wire, but don't cut it.
Okay, I do, but it's not the same.<eos> It's our only chance.<eos> Talk me through it quick.<eos> You wanna take out the yellow wire, but don't cut it.<eos> Tie it to the white one.
Yellow? There is, there is no yellow.<eos> Come on, boys.<eos> Time to earn those patches.<eos> Let's do it.<eos> So you wanna take the wire and tie it to the...
Let's do it.<eos> So you wanna take the wire and tie it to the...<eos> There's a green.<eos> Yeah, the green.<eos> Tie it to the green.
I can't even believe they're taking this case seriously.<eos> The guy threatened me, he attacked my car,<eos> - and he knew I was a cop.<eos> - Look, I told you they were able to get the surveillance camera.<eos> Yeah. After I located it.
- I gave him that book.<eos> - No, you didn't.<eos> Yes, I did.<eos> Ask him.<eos> Well, he really likes it.
Between your medical bills, and... and this hand-to-mouth business, I just...<eos> I didn't realize I was such a burden.<eos> Otto, I'm sorry.<eos> In two days, Audrey, two,<eos> Dockery will come lookin' for his money, and we will not have it.
Look, I just want to replace this card.<eos> Do we really have to do...<eos> Sorry, I lost my wallet.<eos> Buy the boat.<eos> Buy it and we'll take a trip.
I mean, technically, Lance won, but... but the important thing is that you got the money back, so that's good. Hold on.<eos> W... What do you mean, Lance won?<eos> It's called a Jesus con.<eos> We never talked about this?<eos> A guy lights your house on fire, and then he shows up in the nick of time to put it out, making himself your savior.
Well, you go over the wall.<eos> There's a low point where the wall cuts through the mountains.<eos> It's only about 150 feet high there.<eos> How do you do it?<eos> Well, my drone here takes a line up, rigs it around the top. You climb up one side, repel down the other.
Where the hell were you?<eos> - I'm sorry, man, I'm sorry. - Yeah, yeah.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> You fucking hate this place!<eos> Your grandfather left it to me.
More cauliflower, anyone?<eos> It's roasted in coconut oil.<eos> Hey, Sparky, your queen is dead, remember? Not anymore.<eos> I brought her back.<eos> I use it on everything.
- Really.<eos> Very impactful.<eos> Could I borrow that book for a couple of days?<eos> Well, this is the coffee table book.<eos> Well, you've already taken it off the coffee table.
Well, this is the coffee table book.<eos> Well, you've already taken it off the coffee table.<eos> Yeah, you have a point.<eos> But it'll go back over there soon.<eos> If you remove it, then what would I put on the coffee table?
Laser?<eos> Keep away from the window Till the police arrive, okay?<eos> Lukas...<eos> It's about this fucking package.<eos> I'll do what he wants And take it to frankfurt.
- Where is she?<eos> - Don't know, don't care.<eos> Typical Frankie, leaving when the heat's at the door.<eos> She's probably halfway to Borrego right now, wearing one of her moustaches.<eos> You know, I never would have taken that money if I'd known it was from you.
She calls it "Jamaica hair."<eos> It's Jamaica hair.<eos> Ooh, but, look, here's someone who might like it.<eos> We just came to get my mom's weed.<eos> Okay. I think we found it.
And... and that book, it's kinda like a Bible.<eos> See, every mistake you ever thought about makin', Huckleberry Finn already made it fo' you so you don't have to do it.<eos> That's a gift Leonard gave you right there.<eos> All you gotta do is... is... is open it up and feast your eyes on the pages.<eos> Go on. Read it.
Hurt real bad. You got a steak I can put on this?<eos> Think I'd waste a steak on that face?<eos> Detective.<eos> Let me tell her.<eos> It should come from somebody she know.
I... make up your own mind.<eos> There's something.<eos> About the castle.<eos> He... he made some kind of joke.<eos> He put a curse on it.
They're coming to rescue us?<eos> "Us"? They're gonna rescue you, crucify us.<eos> Where's my cell phone?<eos> I have to call him. I haven't called him.<eos> Uh, I traded it. For this.
Purple Orchid, purple dress, purple vibrator.<eos> We're purple people.<eos> Okay, I love your product.<eos> I mean, I love your product.<eos> Yeah, everybody who tries it does.
I also went there to see a little adobe that I own.<eos> You own a house in Santa Fe?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I bought it when my oldest moved there about 12 years ago.<eos> I've been renting it out.
I've been renting it out.<eos> But you aren't anymore?<eos> - No. Not anymore.<eos> - Why not?<eos> Because... I might need it.
You know, Grace, I've been crunching the numbers and doing some business-oriented strategizing.<eos> Oh, I can't wait to hear this.<eos> I'm thinking about how people really want the thing they can't have.<eos> Like the McRib.<eos> If we're gonna create a frenzy for our product, we have to take it off the market.
Do you see what he's done here and why I'm congratulating him?<eos> Look how straight his label is.<eos> This is our goal.<eos> As opposed to... this.<eos> Now, I'm not asking who is responsible for this abomination, but why don't you take Sol's box back out and use it as a model.
- You are John Adams.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> Look, do you know where my family is?<eos> Okay. There is a slight situation, but everything's fine now.<eos> Sol's on his way back and he'll tell you all about it after the show.
Hardly anything is evil, but most things are hungry.<eos> Hunger looks very like evil from the wrong end of the cutlery.<eos> Or do you think that your bacon sandwich loves you back?<eos> So what is it and what was it doing on Earth?<eos> Well, there were scorch marks on the concrete where we found it.
- She's great.<eos> We're gonna take such good care of you.<eos> - Yay. And you remember the beautiful master bedroom, with south-facing windows and impossible-to-stain texture-plush carpeting.<eos> Mm, I love this room.<eos> Then you should buy it, along with all the other rooms.
- I mean, come on.<eos> - Honey...<eos> We're just nervous about such a big investment.<eos> Look, here's the deal with life.<eos> No matter how much we want to control it, we can't always know where it's going to take us.
We'd want to take it with us, of course, because we're shy.<eos> Well, you know, it's gonna cost extra 'cause there's two of you.<eos> That seems arbitrary.<eos> If you're renting a car, you don't pay per person.<eos> You do if both people are fucking it.
Well, I've got one with two heads.<eos> Maybe it isn't Wesen.<eos> What do you mean, like a real monster?<eos> Please don't don't me you think they exist.<eos> Wait, I think I found it.
Actually, I do.<eos> I have a son.<eos> How did you find that monster?<eos> Honey, it's just a man.<eos> Give it a rest, okay?
- I guess.<eos> - The only problem is,<eos> Alpen are attracted to heavy sleepers, which I am not.<eos> Well, melatonin is the chemical in the brain that makes you sleep, right?<eos> That's why your brain produces it.
This skull thing tried to grab me and pull me into wherever it was.<eos> And it almost killed you.<eos> I think it will kill me if I don't do anything about it.<eos> So maybe you should stay away from it.<eos> Nick saw it too.
So maybe you should stay away from it.<eos> Nick saw it too.<eos> What if it comes after him?<eos> I thought it went away when Nick saw it.<eos> No, we don't really know for sure what it was doing.
I just started on the second book, and so far, nothing about mirrors as... portals or gateways to anywhere.<eos> So if you're worried about me, don't be. Yes, I'm...<eos> I'm very worried about you.<eos> Nick, we're the only two people who have seen this thing.<eos> If we don't find a way to get to it, it will find a way to get to us.
- Hey, guys, what's up?<eos> - Hey. We just got back from the M.E.'s.<eos> We got a dead body full of an enzyme called hyaluronidase.<eos> It's something found in bug saliva.<eos> Hoping you might know of a Wesen that uses it to kill its victims.
- Diana!<eos> - Diana! No. No, no!<eos> Don't open it!<eos> - No, Diana!<eos> - Close it!
- Diana! No. No, no!<eos> Don't open it!<eos> - No, Diana!<eos> - Close it!<eos> Close it!
I know.<eos> And I am, but...<eos> -the capital's too big for me.<eos> -Fear passes, Marga.<eos> And so does life if you don't make the most of it.
Julian says even the stockroom workers went.<eos> -[upbeat song playing] -I love this song.<eos> Do you know it?<eos> No.<eos> On a bad day, you can put it on and forget everything. Listen.
-It's important.<eos> Follow me.<eos> I can't find my cigarette case.<eos> I've looked everywhere.<eos> -I think I lost it at Beltrán's house.
I can't find my cigarette case.<eos> I've looked everywhere.<eos> -I think I lost it at Beltrán's house.<eos> -What?<eos> Maybe I dropped it there.
You can relax now.<eos> Not yet.<eos> He thinks he left his cigarette case there.<eos> It's got his name on it.<eos> I need you to use your contacts to find out if the police found it.
I need you to use your contacts to find out if the police found it.<eos> I'll do what I can, princess.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Can we trust her?<eos> If the police have found it, she'll know.
Francisco has no power right now.<eos> But he could...<eos> Did you find the cigarette case?<eos> No.<eos> Victoria says the police don't have it.
Don Francisco...<eos> If you're going to speak, don't lie.<eos> -I don't care why you did it.<eos> Just tell me how much it would cost to get the original will back.<eos> Suppose that was the case, and that's supposing a lot... why would you think I kept it?
Will you help me get back what's legitimately mine?<eos> Doña Carmen is a very determined woman... and she won't forget a maneuver like this.<eos> But she's a woman... and despite the suffragettes' efforts, this is still a man's world.<eos> Who do you put your money on?<eos> [Carlos] I want the poster much higher, where everyone can see it, and the telephones moved to the sides.
Jesse, now would be a really good time for Genesis.<eos> I tried.<eos> It doesn't work.<eos> The window's painted shut.<eos> Climb up on me shoulders and see if you can pry it open.
You thought about it.<eos> - I did.<eos> - Good.<eos> Don't tell me you're here to renegotiate the terms.<eos> I'm not taking it.
Good to see you, Harvey.<eos> I'd ask you to join me for dinner, but I'm pretty sure that that's not what you came here for.<eos> Mike Ross got out of prison.<eos> As far as I'm concerned, there's no reason he shouldn't be able to practice law again.<eos> I don't disagree, but technically, he didn't practice it in the first place.
I don't hate you, Mom.<eos> I hate what you did, and I probably always will, but I don't hate you.<eos> I'll take that.<eos> What is it?<eos> It's nothing. It's... it's just, I had your painting on my wall for the longest time, and I just realized... how much I missed it.
a hell of a lot more than that.<eos> - And if I agree to this, you'll be right back here tomorrow, asking for more.<eos> - Look, I'm telling you, I can get her to agree to this.<eos> - And I am telling you, you've had your offer.<eos> That's all your gonna get, and if you don't take it right now, we're going to trial, and I am gonna wipe the floor with this kid.
TheDonna:<eos> If by friend, youmean- of course you can, Rachel.<eos> What do you need?<eos> - So let me get this straight, you're in love with a woman that you've known for about ten minutes.<eos> She's having another man's baby, and yet, you're gonna marry her, and raise it as your own.
- I'd say that's not possible, because she didn't.<eos> - Well, you've got documents, and I have one too.<eos> This is a copy of a certified letter from my client to the remaining tenants three weeks ago, stating that construction will begin, giving fair warning to the occupants.<eos> - Your honor, my client's never seen that.<eos> - Well, she might not have seen it, but she got it.
- What are you talking about?<eos> The sea, it takes everything.<eos> My children.<eos> My home.<eos> I can't even sell it now.
We're gonna make another you.<eos> Hey.<eos> Made you a sandwich...<eos> half an hour ago.<eos> Then I ate it.
We weren't her friends, remember?<eos> We owe it to her... because we weren't her friends.<eos> We don't have the money.<eos> We're magicians.<eos> Let's build it ourselves.
Because forget what I told that guy, I don't have any money.<eos> Wait.<eos> This is good.<eos> Being stuck in that cramped apartment wasn't giving me what I need.<eos> Yeah, so instead, I'm gonna give it over to the city and let the city provide.
- It was super cool of you.<eos> - Oh, Sophia. It was a pleasure and an exhilaration to be you for a day and see art through a non-artist's eyes.<eos> Okay.<eos> Again, thanks.<eos> And since I sweated my ass off in this thing, I cleaned it...
You should never have cut those pants.<eos> I wouldn't do it if it was one of a kind. You know, I wouldn't cut couture.<eos> It's cold comfort, Sophia.<eos> If you wanted an altered version, you should've found a comparable fabric and used it as a pattern.<eos> And then, if you're like me, you should have wrapped the original garment in acid-free paper, put it in a box, and saved it for future generations to enjoy.
I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine!<eos> Okay, your words, tone and actions aren't totally lining up right now.<eos> Why can't he just fucking believe in me?<eos> You know what I'm really good at?<eos> Taking a piece of clothing and changing a woman's perception of it, so that she has to have it.
I feel like I need to scrub my browser history every time I visit her site.<eos> LOL.<eos> LOL.<eos> But I don't think she's shill bidding.<eos> I was once the only bid on a Nasty Gal top, and I got it for a very low price, $69.
I like your artwork.<eos> It's useless and impractical.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Yeah, Annie says that everything you see before you was inspired by that piece.<eos> So, she wanted me to bring it in as a gift to Sophia.
- Yeah.<eos> Call 911.<eos> Whoa, calm down.<eos> It's fine.<eos> I'll just spit it out.
Call 911.<eos> Whoa, calm down.<eos> It's fine.<eos> I'll just spit it out.<eos> Wait. I don't feel it.
It's fine.<eos> I'll just spit it out.<eos> Wait. I don't feel it.<eos> - Wait.<eos> Do you see it?
Tucson is bygones, buddy.<eos> It only took two days to build that frame.<eos> [Annie] How do you know all of this?<eos> Before business school, I took classes in architectural drafting.<eos> I loved it.
That is the dumbest thing I've ever heard.<eos> No, it isn't.<eos> And not only that, you have to tailor its response to the feelings the person is having.<eos> How am I supposed to do that?<eos> You have to have it listen.
What's with the boxes, Louis?<eos> This is everything the firm has ever done for Couture Apparel.<eos> You're taking us to your annual meeting?<eos> I'm not just taking you.<eos> We're running it together.
Nuh-uh, buddy.<eos> You don't give a shit about your employees and I don't give a shit about you.<eos> This deal is done.<eos> You can't do this.<eos> Yes, I can and I didn't have leverage before, but I have it now.
Voices on a phone, right?<eos> Great.<eos> I'll tell you this much, though...<eos> Snooty freakin' bastards.<eos> 'Cause I remember, I told 'em to send me his audition tape 'cause I wanted it for, like, his actor reel, right?
Yeah.<eos> Teddy gunth!<eos> So I told them, "you listen to me right now."<eos> You send me his goddamn audition tape right now, or I'm gonna have screen actors guild on you so fast, "your shoes are gonna curl." And believe me, that got their attention.<eos> They sent it to you, this tape?
Okay.<eos> What are you doing with that stool?<eos> Holding it.<eos> What are you doing with that beer?<eos> Drinking it.
You see, I thought we were in this together.<eos> I wanted to be.<eos> I tried to be.<eos> But this life you want, doesn't it feel wrong to you?<eos> And I don't know why it feels wrong to you.
- Then it looks like you're gonna have to find your own way out of here.<eos> All clear, Freya.<eos> This is where you absolutely had to do a locator spell?<eos> Ah, well, when I first moved to New Orleans, I primed this space.<eos> Marked it with my magic, made it mine.
Where is this machine for the king?<eos> We've got a lot of work to do to get the ship ready for winter.<eos> Sector 4... the crack in the outer wall, we need to patch it up.<eos> Start by repairing the damaged panels.<eos> Sector 5... we need to get that tree out of the hole and seal it up.
I know you're angry, but when I shut down A.L.I.E., I knew there was a way for us to get through this together.<eos> Alpha Station is that way.<eos> Every single one of us will survive on this ship.<eos> It won't be easy.<eos> Raven needs volunteers if we're gonna get it ready in time.
There's no tape of the call.<eos> He tipped them off, Delorme, and he erased the evidence.<eos> And what did SIU say?<eos> Oh, Cardinal said the recorder malfunctioned.<eos> They couldn't prove otherwise so they dropped it.
Look, we're a team now,<eos> - and I have a saying... - a tea...<eos> I read the motivational poster in the bathroom.<eos> Good.<eos> Well, um, the team trust has been eroded for both of us, but I'm hoping we can earn it back... tackle problems together within the administrative structure and start... you want to tackle problems?
I've never had sex with Aida.<eos> We're just good friends.<eos> Good to know.<eos> So, Aida's basically a walking smartphone, right?<eos> If a person loses their phone, they can track it. Why can't we do the same with her?
Mr. president.<eos> We don't know who survived, but I've got our top agents searching for the quinjet.<eos> Agent Burrows has the package, but we don't know if he was onboard.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Let's hope for all our sakes that director mace got it.
Though poor Fitz...<eos> We could just reboot the head...<eos> In a controlled environment...<eos> And then we could diagnose the problem together. Please!<eos> Drop it.
I'm afraid I'm the reason you're here.<eos> I told them Coulson gave you the book.<eos> - The boo...<eos> What book? - The Darkhold.<eos> My friend, I made some questionable allegiances to get ahold of it, and they double-crossed me.
I think you got us ... I think you got us flipped, there.<eos> I mean, you're ... you're literally wearing the same thing right now.<eos> We have no idea what Billy did with the Darkhold.<eos> I didn't want to know.<eos> That was the whole point in giving it to him.
Is it possible?<eos> What?<eos> Talk to me.<eos> Radcliffe mapped another brain.<eos> I saw it.
Great!<eos> But that ... that book ... you really shouldn't... touch that.<eos> - It's ... It's dangerous, powerful.<eos> - I'm aware.<eos> - I read it while you were sleeping.
- It's ... It's dangerous, powerful.<eos> - I'm aware.<eos> - I read it while you were sleeping.<eos> - You did what?<eos> ! I specifically said it was mine to examine, decipher ...
- I read it while you were sleeping.<eos> - You did what?<eos> ! I specifically said it was mine to examine, decipher ...<eos> You said it would help me find a solution ... - to eliminate the Inhuman problem.<eos> - I said don't touch it!
! I specifically said it was mine to examine, decipher ...<eos> You said it would help me find a solution ... - to eliminate the Inhuman problem.<eos> - I said don't touch it!<eos> Could warp the senses, corrupt the mind.<eos> Relax. I glanced at it, and it gave me a simple answer.
You knew I loved that print.<eos> You told me that when I was cured, - you'd buy me the real thing.<eos> - I remember.<eos> I want you to know the day you left me, I threw that print in the bin.<eos> I couldn't look at it anymore.
Well, that's simply not accurate.<eos> A defining human trait seems to be regret, or so I've observed.<eos> You even asked me to repair one regret for each person entering the framework.<eos> Yes.<eos> Well, you, doctor, exhibit poor self-control, and if you someday come to regret building the framework, you could change my parameters and have me dismantle it.
See?<eos> Good as new.<eos> And stronger, it seems.<eos> I know what you did.<eos> You stole my mind and uploaded it to a filthy machine.
Hey!<eos> What are you doing?<eos> You tagged my car.<eos> I can't drive this now.<eos> I didn't tag it.
More like a mass grave at the Academy.<eos> The story's a cover-up.<eos> I think Hydra murdered me.<eos> Did you find the extraction beacon?<eos> Exactly where we programmed it.
we need to be ready for anything.<eos> On my mark.<eos> I was so certain.<eos> I guess this isn't where she's building the damn thing.<eos> No, this is where she's building it, just not in this world.
The facts will speak for themselves.<eos> It's done, Ophelia.<eos> I've completed the design.<eos> You won't have to live like this for much longer.<eos> I had my doubts about the project, but I finally see it.
Don't move!<eos> We're not the enemy here.<eos> - Let's just keep our cool...<eos> - You shut your robot mouth.<eos> Or I'll have these men weld it shut for you.
We're awake, we're unified, and frankly, pissed off enough to risk everything to stop her.<eos> I need the darkhold. What?<eos> No!<eos> No one's ever reading that damn book again.<eos> I don't want to read it.
I need the darkhold. What?<eos> No!<eos> No one's ever reading that damn book again.<eos> I don't want to read it.<eos> I want to use it as bait.
Yeah.<eos> I have to get this book someplace safe.<eos> Keep an eye on my brother?<eos> The gateway's almost ready.<eos> Don't need it.
Ömer, my husband.<eos> I came across your book a year ago... Thanks to Deniz.<eos> And I really liked it.<eos> You bring the reader a modem take on stories from the oral tradition.<eos> Neval read it first. Then she insisted I read it, too. And she was right.
Tangled Up in Blue.<eos> Blue Oyster Cult.<eos> Blue Monday.<eos> Our car was that color.<eos> We bought it off Craigslist.
Thank you.<eos> You know, when I was about to kill that guy today, I got the tingle.<eos> - Down there.<eos> - I know where the tingle lives, honey.<eos> Then why don't you go visit it.
I don't give a shit if he's the best junior towel boy.<eos> I got something for you to do, and I want it done yesterday.<eos> Let me guess, you want to sell your vodka business.<eos> How the hell could you know that?<eos> Because you don't clean up the balance sheet of your third largest division six months after you restructure if you're not looking to put it on the market.
- The problem is those fantasies weren't of me being a therapist to a man who's still too afraid to admit that he needs help, much less take control of a firm that bears his name.<eos> Thank you for dinner, Harvey. If you need a session, call my office.<eos> Unfortunately, I can't see you anymore, but I can give you a recommendation for someone who can.<eos> - Do for me?<eos> You could tell me from now on if you have a problem with me, you'll take it up with me instead of going behind my back.
We got a problem.<eos> What is it now?<eos> Take a look.<eos> Where'd you get this?<eos> It doesn't matter where I got it.
Why are you guys dressed like that?<eos> Are you, like, coloring each other's hair or something?<eos> No, but that would've been a good explanation.<eos> Actually, we're real estate brokers who have been having trouble selling this place.<eos> Eager to make it more appealing, we're repainting the kitchen.
- Heard from who?<eos> That guy Anton with the medieval Serbian book that might have a cure for... Whoa.<eos> Your eye is a little wonky there.<eos> Ever since I shoved it back in, it occasionally drifts.<eos> Would you mind fixing it for me?
That guy Anton with the medieval Serbian book that might have a cure for... Whoa.<eos> Your eye is a little wonky there.<eos> Ever since I shoved it back in, it occasionally drifts.<eos> Would you mind fixing it for me?<eos> Come on. I have a really hard time lining it up straight, okay?
Hey, that's my brother's bike.<eos> Oh, you're the deceased's brother.<eos> I'm so sorry. He was a great man.<eos> What the fuck are you doing with his bike?<eos> My daughter borrowed it and wants to return it.
I'm so sorry. He was a great man.<eos> What the fuck are you doing with his bike?<eos> My daughter borrowed it and wants to return it.<eos> Borrowed it or stoled it?<eos> Uh, well, since she's bringing it back, definitely borrowed.
- All right.<eos> I was just trying to teach my daughter a lesson about doing the right thing but having experienced you, I think you should give her the money back.<eos> Now.<eos> Fine. Fuck it.<eos> I'll get it for you.
Yeah. Big fan.<eos> I'm Joel.<eos> Oh, you're the guy who's called me a billion times.<eos> May I see the book, please?<eos> I don't know you and I don't take it out in public, but I do keep a digitized version of it along with ten gigs of paranormal, classified documents right here on this thumb drive.
Oh, you're the guy who's called me a billion times.<eos> May I see the book, please?<eos> I don't know you and I don't take it out in public, but I do keep a digitized version of it along with ten gigs of paranormal, classified documents right here on this thumb drive.<eos> This is the truth, my friends.<eos> Now, stop looking at it.
Now, stop looking at it.<eos> I'm just kidding, you can look at it.<eos> No, don't!<eos> Too many people want this and I don't want your lives to be in the same danger as mine.<eos> - I need to see it.
- No.<eos> And just so you don't get really, really mad and stalkery later, there's nothing on it.<eos> Then where's the book?<eos> - I need the goddamn book.<eos> I don't have it, I swear.
And the truth is, it was pretty much about Mike.<eos> And I want to tell her about it, but...<eos> You don't know how she'll react. No, I don't.<eos> I still haven't even told her<eos> I knew about Mike's secret before he got caught, let alone the fact that I used it to get made partner. - Louis...
- That's not...<eos> - Who told you that?<eos> No one told me that.<eos> Just like no one told me that you can't fire him because that'll make you look weak.<eos> Which is why you took this meeting. Because you didn't want him taking it without you.
Hey, you're the one who says you gotta spend money to make money.<eos> I also said when you fund a project, you fund the person.<eos> And the truth is, I'm not funding that woman.<eos> So, why'd we take this meeting?<eos> Took it as a favor to Harvey Specter.
What are you talking about?<eos> We had him guarantee to pay you what he promised and to hire you over there at the end of the quarter. - 'Cause I don't just want you to set that hearing,<eos> I want you to bulldoze anyone who stands in my way.<eos> Look, it's up to you.<eos> You take the job and the money and you get me in or you stay on a sinking ship and wait for them to figure out that you're the one who sank it.
Listen to me.<eos> I am trying to keep my cool.<eos> We don't care if you keep your cool or not.<eos> Because we've got you, and there's nothing you can do about it.<eos> So you can take your offer and shove it in a drawer along with that sorry excuse for a digital secretary, because neither one of them is ever gonna see the light of day.
But instead of throwing the book at her, the prosecuting attorney showed mercy, had the charges knocked down to a misdemeanor, recommended probation, and sealed the records.<eos> That's a touching story, but I don't see what a random attorney has to do with these proceedings.<eos> She's not talking about a random attorney.<eos> She's talking about me.<eos> But just because I showed compassion once doesn't mean he deserves it now.
I'll see you Monday, Harvey.<eos> See you Monday.<eos> - I'll get that.<eos> - Keep your money, Mr. Ross.<eos> You're gonna need it.
You got money over?<eos> We did.<eos> I barnstormed it through in my neck pillow.<eos> Yeah. It's not in there.<eos> I just wanted you to faint or something at TSA to cause a distraction so I could get it across.
Don't ever leave me.<eos> I won't. Because I'm never going to leave you.<eos> And it's not even because I love you, I just...<eos> I mean, I do, but... there's a working part missing now,<eos> YOU took it out, or something and... now I just don't work without you.
- I'm so...<eos> - ...jealous.<eos> - I'd love to.<eos> - Great. [clicks teeth]<eos> Perhaps I could review it one more time.
No, wait.<eos> - We need him out now!<eos> - You heard the man.<eos> Drain that thing.<eos> Break through it, damn it.
Thank you.<eos> - Hi.<eos> - Club soda?<eos> - I see, thank you.<eos> - I found it. You look cozy and comfortable.
Even when you disappeared, we carried on because that's what you wanted.<eos> No, because the old Rip was a fool for believing that time is worth saving, and you were even bigger fools for believing him.<eos> Now, my patience is wearing thin.<eos> Where's the spear fragment?<eos> In the same place you left it.
Basically, your king now does anything I want him to do, so if you don't him to spill your blood all over this floor,<eos> I suggest that you hand over your fragment of the Spear.<eos> My patience is running short.<eos> The fragment... where is it?<eos> As long as I live, you will never have it.
I know you can do this.<eos> You saw what they did to Arthur.<eos> Imagine what they could do with an army of brainwashed knights.<eos> - What are you suggesting?<eos> - The fragment of the Spear... we need to get it out of the castle.
Damn it, Ray!<eos> You're here to finish me off, Captain?<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Saving your life.<eos> Give it up, Raymond.
Why would he wanna blow the building up?<eos> He's inside, too, he'll die.<eos> It doesn't matter to Armek.<eos> He'd proudly give his life to complete his mission.<eos> - Can we shut it down manually?
Launch the ship with the aliens already loaded.<eos> We've got a few hundred of them.<eos> It's not what I envisioned, but it's a start.<eos> - System locked.<eos> - Turn it off. Now!
It's me!<eos> I'm the launch! - What?<eos> - This is not a drill.<eos> Once this ship breaches atmo it's gonna jump to light speed.<eos> So we need to stop it before it gets to space.
Uh, okay, try toggling the switch next to the control yoke and that should put you back in manual control and then I can take it from there.<eos> - Two minutes.<eos> - Nothing's happening.<eos> - The ship is still picking up speed.<eos> - We need to slow it down. I'm here.
- Two minutes.<eos> - Nothing's happening.<eos> - The ship is still picking up speed.<eos> - We need to slow it down. I'm here.<eos> I can slow it down.
- No!<eos> No!<eos> - The painting.<eos> Where is it?<eos> I got it.
I had that coming.<eos> Looks like someone's controlling him.<eos> It's working. What's working?<eos> Okay, so, I reconfigured this thing to go off if there's another messaging device nearby. Which means there is a bounty hunter and he is close.<eos> Can you control it?
Hell yeah!<eos> I just got a software update request from one of our trackers.<eos> System's not recognizing the IP address.<eos> - Looks like a hack.<eos> Should I kill it?
Good. Then we can strike.<eos> Marcus knows where his mom is, but he's gotta take us to her.<eos> I'm afraid I can't let him out of here.<eos> Mon-El's mother created some sort of device with Lena Luthor.<eos> She could set it off at any moment.
Wait... What are you...<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Thousands of Daxamites survived the destruction of our planet.<eos> They just needed a way to get here.<eos> Turn it off!
So the wedding will legitimize your union in the eyes of the Daxamite people.<eos> We'll have a formal ceremony.<eos> You're insane if you think I'm going through this pageant for you.<eos> Yes, you've made your feelings for me abundantly clear, Lena.<eos> I don't expect you to do it for me.
- Yeah.<eos> Of course. We all do.<eos> So, you want to put the house on the market, yeah? Yeah.<eos> So, I'd say is worth a fair amount now, isn't it, our house?<eos> We painted it, it's all Dulux Heritage colours now, isn't it? - Oh, yeah.
So, you want to put the house on the market, yeah? Yeah.<eos> So, I'd say is worth a fair amount now, isn't it, our house?<eos> We painted it, it's all Dulux Heritage colours now, isn't it? - Oh, yeah.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> We bought it about two and a half years ago, so I'd say its value is...
I haven't seen you here for a while.<eos> Uh, yeah, I used my membership so little last year that it worked out to about 70 quid a visit.<eos> I can't afford that.<eos> Sell your house yet?<eos> Not yet, but we just hired a guy who wears a lot of really beautiful jewellery to sell it, so it should fly off the shelf now.
Let's just do it.<eos> Let's go for it. We're going to sell this place.<eos> I mean, look at it.<eos> Look at our cushions.<eos> I'd buy it. If I didn't already own it.
Hey, hold up.<eos> Weren't you just soaking this thing in lighter fluid this morning?<eos> Marcel, do me a favor.<eos> I want you to keep that book far away from me.<eos> If I even try to come for it, I want you to kill me.
Okay, so who gave you the book?<eos> - A witch must have planted it or...<eos> - That's the thing, Marcel...<eos> The book's written in my handwriting.<eos> And I don't remember writing it.
There you go.<eos> Marcel, we've got five totems and we got four kids.<eos> Okay, so who's the other kid?<eos> Nice car.<eos> Hey, do you mind if I borrow it?
Maybe if you did what it asked you to do, things might be different.<eos> For me.<eos> For Cami.<eos> For all of us.<eos> Is that what it told you, Will?
For all of us.<eos> Is that what it told you, Will?<eos> That's what it showed me, Vince.<eos> It's overrun with evil.<eos> And the only way to take it back is to do one little evil thing myself.
- Hold on, Elijah!<eos> - Why do you insist?<eos> Because he's my friend.<eos> And because a witch told me that I'm the one that gave this thing breath.<eos> Now I don't know what I did to let it into this world, but I know I ain't just gonna let it take him out.
There has to be another way.<eos> Where are we?<eos> Don't look into the blue light.<eos> Yeah, um... so these kids are powering that ritual.<eos> But there might be a loophole, if I link it to you.
Tell me what you heard.<eos> Voices.<eos> They said that we're connected to this. You and me.<eos> If this fossil has been whispering lies,<eos> I'll gladly throw it in the river. No.
Really? Was it?<eos> 'Cause it seems like there's always some necessity for some awful thing.<eos> We are at war with a creature we barely understand.<eos> That's the point.<eos> We don't understand this thing or how to stop it.
Please inform the Ancestors that they're a colossal waste of my time.<eos> I've been alive a thousand years. I've never met anything I couldn't kill.<eos> We will defeat this pathetic phantom, as well.<eos> It was her tribe that turned her into this thing.<eos> Her family should have stopped it.
I'm not sorry.<eos> Yeah, it sucks that they turned it into some symbol of the resistance or whatever, but I am glad I said it out loud.<eos> Now, I want to lay down in my tchotchke nook and I wanna relax until this whole thing blows over.<eos> They heard what they wanted to.<eos> They turned it into some kind of a symbol.
I wonder who's fucking my wife?<eos> So that's my bad.<eos> And, no, I... I don't forget Gary.<eos> I don't forget how you emptied our bank accounts when you knew I needed that money, Wendy.<eos> You knew I needed it.
Well, if you could, I'd have to thank you.<eos> This job's my old man's idea.<eos> Something about "calluses and character."<eos> Yeah, well, you're blowing leaves, not hiding Anne Frank.<eos> I doubt that that argument resonates with a Baptist Kansas City lawyer, but I'll give it a go.
- Hi, I'm Jonah.<eos> - I'm Tuck.<eos> Can I see the knife?<eos> Isn't it cool?<eos> You can have it.
I'd a been a sight more comfortable with a couple grand and a Handycam.<eos> The point is, Uncle Boyd, that much cash money's ill-gotten.<eos> We got as much right to it as he does.<eos> No, you do not.<eos> - That is my money and I'm taking it.
- The fuck you are!<eos> Relax! Relax.<eos> Just tell me one thing, okay?<eos> What do you think you're gonna do with all of that cash?<eos> Can't just stick it in that hole behind a urinal in whatever the hell place this is, okay?
- Why? Don't worry about that.<eos> The only question you guys need to be asking is are you murderers?<eos> You steal that money, you're gonna have to kill me.<eos> 'Cause there's another man who works for Mr. Navarro, a very serious man... and he's gonna come to town.<eos> He's gonna ask me where that money is. And if I'm still alive, I'm gonna have to tell him that the Langmores stole it.
He jerks his family from Chicago and $8 million from the bank, transporting both to southern Missouri.<eos> Why?<eos> That money was clean.<eos> Taxes were paid.<eos> If he was scared of us freezing it, he'd just wire it into offshore oblivion.
- Listen. - You don't.<eos> You don't have to...<eos> On this piece of paper is Del's e-mail. And underneath it is an address and the number of a storage unit.<eos> And that's where his money is.<eos> That's where he'll find it.
Miss Garrison, I don't know anything about your business.<eos> Therefore I have no suggestions on how to improve it.<eos> I invest in people, not businesses.<eos> I look for people that are passionate about what they do, and for some reason, they haven't found success.<eos> And I know money. I know how to make it work.

What?<eos> I know you! You're the cheat!<eos> I love your work!<eos> The sound it made...<eos> I couldn't hear you, but that noise... it's like I felt it in my bones, you know?
Jessica, would you like to help me demonstrate?<eos> Yes. And I would also like to add that this game rules.<eos> Yes.<eos> This game does rule.<eos> And I'm excited to play it because your class is super attractive.
I'm like insecure about everything.<eos> - You hide it well.<eos> - Well...<eos> I just really love theater.<eos> You know, I feel like I love it the way that most people love like sports or food.
I just really love theater.<eos> You know, I feel like I love it the way that most people love like sports or food.<eos> - Oh, I love food and sports.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - You love it that much?
- You love it that much?<eos> - Yes, I do.<eos> And I've been like that since I was a kid.<eos> I love everything about it.<eos> I love reading it.
- Yes, I do.<eos> And I've been like that since I was a kid.<eos> I love everything about it.<eos> I love reading it.<eos> I love watching it even when it's bad.
- Mm-hm. Are you gonna invite me up?<eos> I was thinking maybe not.<eos> Why?<eos> I already know your bathroom is gross AF.<eos> First of all, I've cleaned it thoroughly.
You still take the subway?<eos> Yeah, girl. How much do you think playwrights make?<eos> So, you're just saying that no matter what I do, there's still no assurance that I'm actually gonna make it even if I win the best award that playwriting has to offer?<eos> Yeah, it's really more about like, what does theater actually mean to you?<eos> - I just love it.
Yeah, girl. How much do you think playwrights make?<eos> So, you're just saying that no matter what I do, there's still no assurance that I'm actually gonna make it even if I win the best award that playwriting has to offer?<eos> Yeah, it's really more about like, what does theater actually mean to you?<eos> - I just love it.<eos> - And you're doing it.
Any luck?<eos> Sorry, man.<eos> We've got nothin'.<eos> What?<eos> We enlarged the image, ran it through this pixel manipulator, but...
You just keep going and you keep going and you keep going.<eos> [Laura] It was within about two months after that that she passed away.<eos> I guess out here it makes you realize all of those sorts of things.<eos> Simple things like love and having friends and family around you that are just amazing.<eos> I guess the point is life's too short and you really do have to live it.
[Emma] Good morning!<eos> We're now heading on a bearing to Hawaii again, which is quite exciting, and hopefully, we'll pick up a bit of speed.<eos> We're making progress, very slowly, but making progress because we are moving west.<eos> And we've slipped into this pattern, really.<eos> To be honest, for me it's become quite a monotonous pattern.
It's been nine months.<eos> Nine months since we left San Francisco and we rowed our little Doris under the Golden Gate Bridge, not really knowing what we were letting ourselves in for.<eos> I don't think I ever found it as my happy place again, but when I think back to being on the boat, I'm going to remember the waves and the skies and the stars and not the struggles.<eos> The moments that are gonna stay with me are all gonna be positive ones.<eos> [Tony] I'm going to drop the rope off, you pull it in.
[Babs] Life is there to live and not to just exist, and she hopefully has shown that, really.<eos> [Laura] Every day that I stepped onto the boat, I don't think a day that's gone past I've not thought about the finish.<eos> But now I realize it was all about the journey.<eos> [Emma] The quote goes that you can never cross an ocean unless you have the courage to lose sight of the shore.<eos> To me now it means whatever the shore is next time, not be afraid to row away from it.
We should really go to medical.<eos> Yeah, we go out there, they're all gonna kill us.<eos> The fun thing about wolfsbane is, it works from the outside in.<eos> Most people feel a little tingle in the fingertips first, as the smallest nerves are paralyzed.<eos> Then, it makes its way, ever so slowly, to your heart, closing around it like an icy fist.
Hi, everyone.<eos> Uh, thank you for bringing your books.<eos> In honor of Poussey, I'd like to welcome you all to the new Litchfield Community Library.<eos> Now, as you can see, it's no longer just one room, but it's everywhere.<eos> Um, so just take your book, replace it with another.
Those women?<eos> Look.<eos> It's the princess of prison.<eos> Yo! This little mic thing is diggin' into my tit.<eos> I'm moving it.
Fuck that. You got to grab fate by the balls and make it do what you want.<eos> For real.<eos> All right.<eos> I know what I want.<eos> I can't make it do anything.
What happened to you, Suzanne?<eos> I need help!<eos> - Okay. - Then we got to get his cells to iron out, because...<eos> But you cannot touch the iron, because it's going to burn your fingers.<eos> You have to throw your spit at it and listen!
Grew up there.<eos> Maybe he kept it for sentimental value.<eos> His father beat him almost daily in that house.<eos> He hated living there.<eos> Why keep it if you're liquidating everything else?
Just do the move.<eos> We are. We are.<eos> We're just motivating it with backstory.<eos> There is a law...<eos> There is a law, and you broke it.
So you better get that money into the banking system.<eos> But here's the problem.<eos> That dirty money is too clean.<eos> Looks like it just came out of a bank vault.<eos> You gotta age it up.
I mean, that guy would have to be in possession, physical possession, of that company's bearer shares.<eos> The piece of paper?<eos> The deed to his empire?<eos> It would all come down to that, wouldn't it?<eos> And if he was in possession of that piece of paper... where do you think he'd keep it?
The piece of paper?<eos> The deed to his empire?<eos> It would all come down to that, wouldn't it?<eos> And if he was in possession of that piece of paper... where do you think he'd keep it?<eos> You think he'd put it in a safe?
Hi, it's Gary Silverberg.<eos> Please leave a detailed message after the beep.<eos> I've been trying to tell you since yesterday about that half-built house on Sunrise Beach.<eos> What about it?<eos> Well, I used the money from the Chicago house and I bought it.
I just fucking found you.<eos> Hey, Anna.<eos> Uh, have you had the chance to look over the handbook?<eos> You have any questions?<eos> Uh, you know, no, I haven't opened it yet.
Fries?<eos> No, thanks.<eos> Have you seen Zach?<eos> He's pulling his boat out today.<eos> - Pulling it out?
No.<eos> Give me that fucking shit.<eos> No, stop it!<eos> Wait.<eos> Where do you keep it?
I'm pulling this out of the way, then I'm going up there.<eos> Yeah, no. No, I can't let you do that.<eos> You what?<eos> The warrant was to locate the car.<eos> We found it.
Oh. Jenny, I don't think we need to bring the sewing machine.<eos> If a costume rips, we're gonna need to fix it.
Out of the way!<eos> I got the tape! Sorry!<eos> Sorry!<eos> Excuse me.<eos> I got it!
I got the tape! Sorry!<eos> Sorry!<eos> Excuse me.<eos> I got it!<eos> I got it.
It's a--<eos> - Well, they look pretty tight.<eos> - No. They're fine.<eos> - You need to be careful on your bike.<eos> - Yeah, well, you see, that's not gonna be a problem because somebody just stole it.
'Cause I thought...<eos> I thought if I did this, if we had this thing-- this secret-- that maybe it would keep us connected.<eos> That somehow, that would... keep us together.<eos> She was already breaking my heart.<eos> I just wanted it to break a little slower.
When did everyone around here lose their sense of humor?<eos> Abby, if you're right, then Luna's the miracle we need.<eos> I wish I were with you.<eos> Me, too, but you have to be there.<eos> Once we create this Nightblood serum, we're gonna have to distribute it very quickly, and we need peace for that.
Good?<eos> Good?<eos> Then it's settled.<eos> Now, that radiation shield is ready.<eos> Who's gonna help me put it in place?
Careful, Reyes.<eos> Emori's already got dibs on me.<eos> Uh, small question.<eos> A.L.I.E. had a security system to protect this thing, right?<eos> Any idea what she was protecting it from?
We will get through this.<eos> On your feet.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> We're bringing you home.<eos> Your ship is shelter from Praimfaya, so I intend to take it.
If they can get it done before the radiation gets here.<eos> I guess we'd better finish the ship.<eos> They told us that you have a Nightblood.<eos> Nightblood helps metabolize radiation.<eos> We're investigating ways to create it for everyone so we can all survive.
Come quietly.<eos> That'll happen.<eos> Skaikru made me murder my entire family.<eos> We're bringing you home.<eos> Your ship is shelter from Praimfaya, so I intend to take it.
Abby, what happened when you tried to get the Nightblood protein to bond with Luna's DNA?<eos> The structure of the RNA fell apart.<eos> - Why?<eos> - Abby, she just had a seizure.<eos> Because I think I know why Becca couldn't make it work in this lab.
I don't know.<eos> Not long.<eos> Did he leave his rifle?<eos> Negative.<eos> Took it with him.
We're not here to kill you, Clarke.<eos> We're here to take your ship, a ship you restored to save your people, not mine.<eos> That ship is a backup plan.<eos> It'll hold 100 people tops.<eos> Then you won't mind if we take it.
I'm sorry. Please forgive me.<eos> ♪ HateltWhen bae's mad.<eos> - [woman] I should say that to my roommate?<eos> - [cell phone buzzes] All she did was leave a wet towel on my bed.<eos> You know, I'll try it.
From now on, this village will be my new household.<eos> I'll administer the district from here.<eos> Your honor, we'd like to drink some of your white water too.<eos> Are you sick?<eos> -We want it just for healing.
Only God wills those who can see the light, and who can feel the wrath.<eos> God is merciful.<eos> God is wise.<eos> -We'll drink it.<eos> -He'll give it to us.
Aw, baby...<eos> Baby, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.<eos> I just grabbed the first thing I could find.<eos> It just needs to be taken out in the back, just a little bit.<eos> Oh, I'm gonna take it out in the back.
You totally ruined the mood!<eos> [sighs] She's off her meds.<eos> I'll work this out.<eos> Dude, where were you?<eos> [Lionel] The speakeasy. Lost my phone. Took a while to find it.
And yet, nowhere in it does it mention the 0-60 time.<eos> They simply refuse to tell us what it is.<eos> I know 0-60 times are irrelevant in the real world and they're rather childish, but look, this is a supercar.<eos> It's top trumps, isn't it?<eos> It's important. So I'm gonna find out what it is for you using this.
Highly-trained men are now removing its skin which will then be mated in a delicate two-hour operation to the internal organs of the mud-plugging V8.<eos> The following morning my incredible car was ready.<eos> It is incredible that in a shed I have created something which has... eluded the combined might of the motor industry.<eos> It is a proper sports utility vehicle.<eos> I call it the MGD, and now I'm going to find out how well it works on a road.
I'm stopping.<eos> Stopping.<eos> Oh, Lord, that is not right, is it?<eos> As I got going for the second time, I realised I'd been a bit of a chump.<eos> The mistake I've made, of course, is that I've introduced you to this car before I've really tested it.

Obviously, we had to retrieve them, which meant moving the raft to the stern of our crane boat.<eos> James, have you untied that end?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Get ready to catch this rope.<eos> Pull it along a bit and get it sort of squared up.
What's what doing?<eos> All this bamboo's come off. What have you untied?<eos> I've untied the piece of string at the front.<eos> But, look, half the craft is disappearing.<eos> As the raft was disintegrating fast, we had to get it to shore quickly.
As he carves the 124 through the standing water, making the best use of its 170 horsepower.<eos> Really leaning on it as he approaches your name here.<eos> That is ballsy. Now, heavy on the brakes, swoops round this fast left-hander, and exits with a skilful flurry of stylish over-steer.<eos> Back onto the isn't.<eos> Hell, I don't know whether to drive this thing or use it for a spit-cup.
Thank you very much. Never mind.<eos> Yes, thank you very much, indeed. And now we must move on, because it is time to set the satnav for destination chat, as we head down Conversation Street.<eos> - That hurt? - It hurt. - It did?<eos> But not as much as the wine bottle last week.<eos> Now, Mercedes, they've come up with this plan, or this idea, where you can rent your car out when you're not using it.
In the name of the Father and of the Son - and the Holy Spirit, amen.<eos> - Amen.<eos> What are you reading, Mrs. Raven?<eos> The journal of one of the first priests here.<eos> I found it in your office.
Couple people on the road trying to get away, I guess.<eos> Then they just stopped at the same time, just like that.<eos> I've seen a couple working since then, but most of them just died.<eos> I got this from one of those survivalist types.<eos> I wanted a family car, but Toby thought it was so cool.
There's something I gotta do first. Okay.<eos> I could have done something.<eos> I could have held her and protected her.<eos> There's nothing you could have done.<eos> That thing in the bookstore, it took her and didn't want me.
I could have done something.<eos> I could have held her and protected her.<eos> There's nothing you could have done.<eos> That thing in the bookstore, it took her and didn't want me.<eos> Why did it want her and not me?
- Octavia, don't!<eos> Stop.<eos> Octavia.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> You want his blood, you can have it.
No response to light.<eos> Yeah. That makes sense.<eos> The creature's dead, so is its webbing.<eos> What are you gonna do with it?<eos> I should probably just dump it. Yeah.
Nah, just bacon, eggs, snags.<eos> Just your basic shit.<eos> That's what a barbecue is.<eos> It's not like putting a hangi down, where you've got to spend hours and hours.<eos> Barbecue, you should be able to start it up, crank it up. Over and done with in half an hour, everybody's sitting down having a feed.
I believe that is the thing, the essence of the Uruguayan asado.<eos> For all Uruguayans, the theme of the asado is the same.<eos> From a very young age, let's say from when you're a baby, you're already experiencing asados, because it's a tradition from many years ago, from our ancestors.<eos> We maintain this.<eos> And we still do it almost every day.
To my way of thinking, hands on cooking is... my way to fly.<eos> You have to drink the Kool-Aid to do this.<eos> There's just no other way around it.<eos> It's a difficult job, it's a harder life.<eos> But it has to be a labor of love.

It's a difficult job, it's a harder life.<eos> But it has to be a labor of love.<eos> And if you're not in it for the right reasons, it'll shorten your life span, I think.<eos> I don't know many people who want to get up at two o'clock in the morning just to come to work and, you know, grind it out for ten or 12 hours, and then go home.<eos> [man speaking in English] Somebody's got to light the fire, somebody's got to get the meat out, they've got to season it, they've got to cut it, make sure it's on the pit, and make sure it's cooked right... and that takes a lot of hours, and a lot of talent.
It's that much of a common fabric in the life of Texans.<eos> All around the world barbecue becomes something more than just food.<eos> It becomes an event, and it's just...<eos> It's a homecoming to a lot of people.<eos> It means community is what barbecue means, and there's a community of us that are still keeping it alive.
It's a homecoming to a lot of people.<eos> It means community is what barbecue means, and there's a community of us that are still keeping it alive.<eos> What we're doing is, we're putting as much love into this as we can.<eos> You know, and we're...<eos> I'm trying to show the gratitude I have to the people that I've learned it from, and a gratitude to the ones that they learned it from.
I studied, and in my free time, I went to work.<eos> That's how I learned it.<eos> Now I'm 20, almost 21, and I have been working for almost five years.<eos> When the work is finished, and I taste the mezcal, I say the work was done well, the product is good.<eos> And I like when people taste it and say, "this is really good mezcal! ,"
Mike!<eos> Stop!<eos> They're gone.<eos> Save the water.<eos> Let it burn.
Maybe it was the devil that wants me down here with you.<eos> Purgatorio.<eos> How much longer?<eos> We should get there before dark.<eos> The hotel, why did you leave it?
- That was Troy.<eos> Yeah, and where do you think he gets it?<eos> "Don't let the bleeding hearts fool you, son." Talk about the Indians, Mexicans, how we stole their land.<eos> Boy, there ain't a spot of dirt anywhere on this earth ain't been taken.<eos> And rest assured, there are those who would take it from us.
Two horses, a lot of feed, lot of water.<eos> They'd have slaughtered it.<eos> They'd have killed it if it were like that.<eos> Treat the hide. Cure the meat.<eos> They wouldn't just free it.
My great-grandfather.<eos> Shouldn't he be buried?<eos> He was.<eos> In a cave.<eos> I desecrated his grave to save it from the Ottos and their fortune hunters.
A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES<eos> Damn that woman.<eos> [man] What do you want us to do?<eos> I want my money.<eos> Get it.
Damn that woman.<eos> [man] What do you want us to do?<eos> I want my money.<eos> Get it.<eos> [man] What if she doesn't have it?
No. I don't.<eos> But I do know what it feels like to think you have no choice but to kill.<eos> You think I have a choice? If we let Baylis live, he will come back.<eos> Nothing will stop him from punishing me for leaving.<eos> If we show even the slightest hesitation, he will use it.
- Hey... ♪ Bustin' all the trap niggas ♪ - Man, don't say that.<eos> - What?<eos> You know I don't really use that word.<eos> Yeah, man, I know, but, uh...<eos> I just really heard you say it, though.
Um, how does that bring them closure?<eos> It comes with a note saying she's dead.<eos> Look, nothing we can do will bring this poor girl back to life.<eos> I know, but... Not even a voodoo priestess, flown here from Haiti at great expense, and then every year, on grandma's birthday, they throw it your face!<eos> Uh... So the best thing we can do now is to fill this car to the rafters with dynamite and shove it over a cliff.
The tattoo.<eos> Look. The center.<eos> Still think it's a coincidence?<eos> Where did you get this?<eos> Oh, I found it.
Well, I think people are comforted by routine.<eos> If we act like we're panicked, then opinion will follow.<eos> Okay, where are we with the shooter?<eos> A vehicle was reported stolen from a parking garage two blocks from the shooting site.<eos> District Police recovered an image from the lot's surveillance camera and are trying to see if it matches eyewitness description.
It's an ICBM missile silo.<eos> What?<eos> Yeah, the government built it in the '70s, decommissioned years ago as part of an arms reduction treaty.<eos> Took out the payload, and the property was sold to Browning-Reed.<eos> We got to get back out there and find it. No.
No, sir, but it's implied. And this is a town that loves to connect the dots.<eos> She stayed in hotel suites in Ankara and Istanbul and had lavish meals.<eos> What was she supposed to do, check herself into a cell and survive on bread and water?<eos> The military-aid package included the latest in digital-surveillance technology.<eos> And, at the time, the Pentagon was strongly advising against giving it to Turkey.
Kimble, I believe you.<eos> The trip was largely agricultural...<eos> Drip irrigation, things like that. I thought it would be useful for my constituents.<eos> And the bill?<eos> I co-sponsored it with Representative Holden of Ohio, former Chair of the Armed Services Committee.
Without a court to adjudicate the laws of this land, we are a broken government, sir.<eos> Now, this was a fair deal.<eos> Every single person in this room has something to claim victory over.<eos> I'm not gonna let you hijack that, sir.<eos> And if you're willing to play politics with people's lives, trust me... I am more than willing to walk down that hall to my press room and call you out in front of the entire world for trying to hold our justice system hostage at a time when we need it most.
- Okay, I love you too, bye.<eos> - Oh, love you, too.<eos> Who's that?<eos> Uh, just some NATO prep.<eos> Hey, did you know that they charge you for the food on Air Force One whether you actually eat it or not?
Uh, how do you two know each other again?<eos> - Oh... - College.<eos> We're old friends.<eos> I hope you enjoy the book.<eos> I'll be curious what you see in it, living how you... well, where you do.
Yeah, only ten years of therapy.<eos> Rebecca thinks that if we have kids, our lives are gonna be over.<eos> She's right, pal.<eos> I love our life.<eos> And I'm scared of changing it, 'cause the truth is when I close my eyes and I think about our future...
Blackout.<eos> Well?<eos> Anyone gonna... you know.<eos> Nothing.<eos> I have to say, when Olivia disappeared, and Kevin decided to self-finance this play, opposite the girl who wrote it,

- I don't want your fucking butler.<eos> I want you to read my script.<eos> The one from this morning?<eos> No.<eos> No, another one. I've been trying to get it made for years.

It was a squirrel.<eos> What the hell is wrong with you?<eos> - You killed that thing?<eos> - I didn't kill it.<eos> I found it and I brought it here.
And that guy had set the table at that moment to use it to employ a specialist to put the final systemization on their program.<eos> So in May of 2012, I was in the position of possibly having single-handedly armed Iran.<eos> But the money got away from them.<eos> Due to what we've learned is the inherent difficulty of delivering an entity from A to B, I guess.<eos> And an opportunity arose to get it back, just a really nice opportunity to get it back.

You just wanted the bag?<eos> Yes.<eos> Okay.<eos> So, where's the money now?<eos> I left it in a simple carefree style on the dresser in the ladies' police room.
Yes!<eos> Sam?<eos> Yeah.<eos> - I'm here for you, okay? - Okay.<eos> - Let's do it. - Okay.
Just say yes. - That's off-message.<eos> - Think of it like an investment.<eos> An opportunity to get in on the ground floor of a really exciting new venture.<eos> I don't have any specs, but I can get you a business plan.<eos> Know what, why don't you come down to the gym and see it for yourself?
- You've been there before?<eos> - Mmm. It's been years.<eos> - Tell me, truck driver...<eos> - I said my name was Evander.<eos> Did you ever know a woman, truck driver, who took your heart and rattled it like a baby in a cage?
You can't read.<eos> The quote that Sunny found scrawled on the inside cover has been said by many of my associates over the years. It goes...<eos> VIOLET: "In every library, there is a single book that can answer the question that burns like a fire in the mind."<eos> It wasn't the quote that caught Sunny's eye, nor was it the reference to fire that set Violet's heart racing. It was the handwriting.<eos> For when Violet saw the strong left lean of the L's, and the confident closed loop of the O's, she knew who wrote it even before she saw the name on the library checkout card.
Kurt Fletcher and Pastiche handed out their latest issue.<eos> I wouldn't exactly call that uneventful.<eos> People have been snapping and tweeting about it.<eos> And you weren't there to cover any of it because you're on, what? A date?<eos> I wouldn't call it that.
She's wearing a suit.<eos> I...<eos> I, uh...<eos> The seal of her helmet's torn.<eos> Can you fix it?
I'm not a leader.<eos> It should be you or Clarke or...<eos> O., stop. Neither of us could've done what you did, and it wasn't just winning a fight.<eos> You gave people hope when there was none.<eos> You're... you're Prometheus, stealing fire from the gods and giving it back to the human race.
Run fast.<eos> Emori!<eos> Echo!<eos> Little help here?<eos> Don't drop it.
All of a sudden, you had, like, 11, right?<eos> And you're hammered, and you're thinking...<eos> You know, but you're responsible.<eos> You're drunk but you're responsible.<eos> You're like, "Goddamn it, I drove my car here tonight... goddamn it, I'm driving it home."
So the lady's sitting there, she's like,<eos> "Well...<eos> Well, the... the kitty cat... it got hit by a car... and it's fucking dead."<eos> And the gorilla immediately took it in.<eos> It immediately took it in. It understood.
And in a weird way, now you know how I felt.. When I watched that video.<eos> You know what it was? You know what it was?<eos> I did that joke all around the country, all right, and the gorilla always died, 'cause Jesus wanted it that way... and that was it.<eos> And it fucking bombed in every goddamn city in this country except for Dallas, Texas.<eos> That was the only place where they got it.
That was the only place where they got it.<eos> And I'm not shitting on Texas.<eos> It bombed in Houston, Austin,<eos> El Paso, San Antonio.<eos> Killed in Dallas. They are the only ones who got it.
The great thing about men is we're fucking simple. We're fucking simple, okay?<eos> So here's the thing. You want to make a guy happy?<eos> If you're with a good guy, okay, this is all you've got to do, okay?<eos> How about four times a year, once a season... you go out to the kitchen.<eos> Without him saying shit, you make a sandwich, you get him a beer, you walk out, you give it to him, you don't say a word, and you just fucking leave.
A toddler could do that.<eos> Just put it together.<eos> Grab two slices of pre-made, pre-sliced bread, two handfuls of pre-murdered meat.<eos> Put a little mustard on it.<eos> Grab a beer, walk out, just hand it to him, don't say shit, and then fucking leave.
I had dirt, sweat, cobwebs all over me.<eos> I wanted to burn down this fucking house.<eos> I was ready to leave.<eos> But out of nowhere, my wife showed up, big smile on her face, and she had made me a sandwich.<eos> Cut it in half diagonally, which is love, right?

- Is that what this...<eos> - You could be.<eos> - Is that what this is?<eos> - You...<eos> Are you trying to find dirt on me so you can trade it at the salon? I mean... - No.
His commitment is in his DNA.<eos> Sometimes we forget to acknowledge and reward that.<eos> Eh, better late than never.<eos> Russel, if you are willing to accept the challenge of 8R, I would like to guide you through that climb, so that you may join the ranks of a select few. Including your sister.<eos> - Commitment is particularly inspiring when it comes from someone young.
Good morning, doctors!<eos> Chief.<eos> And welcome to you, Dr. Minnick.<eos> Oh, thank you, really, but I don't do caffeine.<eos> I don't need it.
- Why?<eos> - No clue.<eos> DeLuca.<eos> DeLuca, wait!<eos> So, you called a meeting, and they ignored it?
It's mostly just vascular repair.<eos> I'll look for organ damage.<eos> I'll take care of the limb.<eos> I'm worried about that right leg.<eos> - She tore it up pretty badly.
Phew, this polish smells.<eos> Want me to open a window?<eos> Oh.<eos> It stopped raining.<eos> Okay, I'm not gonna leave it open too long, or you'll catch a chill.
I think him and Ash set up some sort of shady side deal.<eos> He's the real criminal.<eos> But if Ash got this hefty divorce settlement, then why was he couch-surfing?<eos> Where'd the money go?<eos> Maybe the mediator took it?
Because I was young, woefully foolish and...<eos> Unarmed?<eos> You know that if you had possessed the Flaming Sword, the weapon that guarded Eden, the weapon that can cut through anything, even the Gates of Heaven itself, well, you would've won that rebellion.<eos> Why are you dwelling in the past?<eos> The fact is, I didn't have the sword, and Dad destroyed it soon after, so...
What's this?<eos> Well, where do I start?<eos> Missing commemorative scissors.<eos> Looks like we found our fat knife.<eos> Or didn't find it, but, you know.
I'm so sorry.<eos> I-I got so angry, I couldn't control myself.<eos> What?<eos> Hold on. All this talk about controlling your emotions and harnessing them for creation was all just a sham?<eos> I tried so hard to make it real.
A clue to what?<eos> Well, you're the one who has to figure that out, aren't you?<eos> And you really think that this is the Flaming Sword?<eos> It's so not flaming.<eos> That's because only you, my Lightbringer, can ignite it.
Yes, I think this is what Uriel was trying to tell me.<eos> Just before he died, he whispered in my ear, "The piece is here."<eos> I mean, I thought it was nonsense, but... this must be why the sword wasn't working.<eos> It wasn't complete. Dad supposedly destroyed the Flaming Sword after the rebellion.<eos> So, are you saying he just broke it into two pieces?
Well, that went well.<eos> - You think so, do you?<eos> - I do.<eos> He has what we need in his safe in the back room.<eos> He's going to get it right now.
Exactly!<eos> So, all this... was for nothing.<eos> Lucifer, that's even worse.<eos> This phone could be the key to taking down the entire Ruiz empire.<eos> Yeah, but how do we crack it if cyber couldn't even do it?
I know.<eos> I've been looking forward to a formal "heyya."<eos> - No, I see you're still working on the phone.<eos> I knew Chet well.<eos> Perhaps I could borrow it, maybe try some combinations?
Like, literally, he's just going, "I object..."<eos> The judge throws the gavel at him and he eats it or fetches it.<eos> - Genius!<eos> - That's the book!<eos> And we call it...
Yeah, you're right. Okay.<eos> You're right.<eos> Water.<eos> Dear God, why isn't there water?<eos> Maybe there was water, and karma took it away from you.
Right.<eos> So that space just got snatched.<eos> While you were eating a sandwich?<eos> I can multitask.<eos> May I ask who snatched it?
- Excuse me?<eos> - Yeah, you heard me. No.<eos> Look, I know you're here to stop him from going on his date with an actual heterosexual woman, so no.<eos> Jack has a date already?<eos> He's not calling it that, but everybody else knows what it is.
That's the brilliance of the plan.<eos> Ohhhh, right. Okay, so I'm your white-trash baby vessel.<eos> Loving it.<eos> So when you're done with my womb, do I just move back into my trailer or... ?<eos> Okay, I hear you saying you're loving it, but I don't feel you loving it.
Turbulence... it means anything from a few little bumps to a catastrophic weather system that could knock your flying tin can right out of the air.<eos> What I don't like is how they treat you... the comments and the backhanded compliments.<eos> I'm gonna stop you before you say something you shouldn't.<eos> This my family we're talking about. No!<eos> In surgery, we call it
You want to hold that for me?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> Got a bunch of Band-Aids and a defibrillator and no splint, so I can shock you, but I can't splint your wrist.<eos> So probably gonna have to reset it, and then wrap it tight, and there's no good pain meds in here so this will hurt.
Thrombolytics are contraindicated.<eos> We need to do a embolectomy, and let's get an IVC filter.<eos> Veronica, you've thrown a blood clot, and it's traveled all the way to your lungs.<eos> It's very serious.<eos> We need to remove it immediately, so we're gonna need to put you under and open up your chest.
No hatching new plans.<eos> I told you, just fix up my spleen, and then send me on my way, that's it.<eos> Holly, this could give you your life back.<eos> Yeah, but this is my life.<eos> I don't need it back.
But you're not going to see her again.<eos> Corey, hold the time you two spent together close to your heart.<eos> But don't let it hold you back.<eos> No more sitting here and waiting.<eos> Grab your new life by the hand and go out there and live it.
Don't worry.<eos> I'm coming.<eos> Don't panic.<eos> - Oh, God, just... - Ow!<eos> Ow! Move it off, please!
Okay, look, you need to at least be hydrated, okay?<eos> Will you stay there?<eos> Let me just take care of this.<eos> - Did you get the proximal end?<eos> - Oh, yeah, I got it, I got it.
Did you clean the area with Betadine?<eos> - Mm-hmm, all over.<eos> - Did you prep the lidocaine?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Okay. Inject it around the wound.
- Yeah.<eos> Fine.<eos> I love that song.<eos> Mm, me, too.<eos> I find it comforting.
I love that song.<eos> Mm, me, too.<eos> I find it comforting.<eos> My father would beat my mother.<eos> My sister would bring my brother and me into her room, and she'd play it, turn it up as loud as she could.

Tell me why it's your fault.<eos> The... The, uh... The nun at my school, she showed it to me.<eos> Okay?<eos> The... The evil, uh, was inside of her.<eos> She asked me to beat it out of her, and I did... and I let it out.

Unless it was a drug-induced kill.<eos> The unsub could have freaked out and taken off with the knife.<eos> Reid told Castenada he was chasing someone.<eos> It could have been the killer.<eos> Yeah. Well, if they took the knife with them, they could have dumped it in the desert.
How did it look?<eos> Devonshire was beautiful, Lord.<eos> God be with you.<eos> What binds a man to his land?<eos> What power within allows him to give his life to preserve his land and the lives of the families who work it?
All of you.<eos> I'm going up there to find my friend.<eos> If you come with me, I can't promise that you won't all die. But I can promise you this.<eos> You won't all die in a hole in the ground.<eos> We have to drive it back through and close the portal behind it.
If you come with me, I can't promise that you won't all die. But I can promise you this.<eos> You won't all die in a hole in the ground.<eos> We have to drive it back through and close the portal behind it.<eos> Now, the gate only opens when the dawn sun hits it. Why's that?<eos> Our ancestors couldn't close the gate completely, but they built the cairn to control it.
It feeds on light but it homes in on sound.<eos> So what's going to happen?<eos> It's simple.<eos> Bit of noise, lure the beast here,<eos> Drive it back through the gate.
So what's going to happen?<eos> It's simple.<eos> Bit of noise, lure the beast here,<eos> Drive it back through the gate.<eos> But how do we keep it there?
But how do we keep it there?<eos> I mean, you said, all those things are going to come through, right?<eos> They can only come through one at a time.<eos> I know. That's why guarding the gate worked.<eos> One Pict in there, fighting it off for a few minutes, that adds up to 60 or 70 years out here -
And there's music.<eos> Always music.<eos> Well, team, who's going to help me hide his gee-tar?<eos> See, that's what I'm trying to teach you, Missy.<eos> You understand the universe, you see it, you grasp it. But you've never learned to hear the music.
And bring Thyroid. She could do with a night out.<eos> - Do you mean Maureen?<eos> - Oh, yeah, sorry, Maureen.<eos> This palatial abode is the house that Vincent Swan paid for.<eos> Unfortunately, it belongs to Walshy.
And maybe you reap what you sow, but believe me,<eos> I'd rather reap a harvest of ill-gotten gains than fight over a handful of slim pickings with the rest of you fucking plebs.<eos> Come here, my little Swans.<eos> Go and fight over who gets the biggest room.<eos> - Oldest gets it!
They will take on the most physically and psychologically demanding obstacle course in the world... the ultimate battle of man versus beast.<eos> Twelve will enter, but only one can prevail.<eos> This is Ultimate Beastmaster.<eos> I don't know where this thing came from or how it got here.<eos> I just wanna see somebody conquer it!
Does that include the cactuses?<eos> Not the cactuses, Murray, but it does include the cacti.<eos> Chief, why aren't we drilling?<eos> There's water in the ground.<eos> Let's go and get it, for Christ's sake.
You done, Stay-Puff?<eos> Sorry, I had a few setbacks.<eos> This isn't even the new system.<eos> You know, I tried that system and, it was bunk.<eos> Maybe you built it backwards.
He thinks you're keeping a woman captive.<eos> I feel like I'm in a bad dream.<eos> Nonsense, you've done an excellent job of keeping your wits about you.<eos> Ditching your phone, for instance.<eos> I told you, I lost it.
I feel like I'm in a bad dream.<eos> Nonsense, you've done an excellent job of keeping your wits about you.<eos> Ditching your phone, for instance.<eos> I told you, I lost it.<eos> After you turned it off, I guess.
So, they followed him at a close distance, but they didn't stay close enough because they lost him when he hopped on the "A" train.<eos> After that, all we had was the signal from his cell.<eos> He turned his phone back on. No, he got another one, but we were up on it.<eos> He must've been suspicious because his signal dropped out right after his train departed. Beach 98th.<eos> He turned it off right here.
So you can take solace in that.<eos> I just realized that I have had this in my car for weeks.<eos> The paraffins alone would have killed you.<eos> I'll get you a different one.<eos> Aldous was so proud when he published this book, and yet, P.T. Westmoreland told me he wrote it.
You know what?<eos> - I don't know what I'm doing any more.<eos> - It's fine.<eos> Marianne will never know the difference.<eos> Put it back in its cage so you don't kill another one.
This thing has broke my foot!<eos> No!<eos> It's going in!<eos> It's going in the pool.<eos> Did you leave it in neutral? Of course not.
I represent a huge YA writer.<eos> Named Shawna Hess.<eos> I told her how talented you were, blah, blah, blah.<eos> She read your book.<eos> She loved it and she agreed to meet with you.
Just in case this guy keeps causing trouble.<eos> You just spot something?<eos> It's a link to an online Photobucket.<eos> Schmitt's phone was never recovered.<eos> Presumably the killer took it along with his wallet.
Given how hard the soil has been due to the cold, to leave an impression like that it would have to be warm and heavy, for a long time.<eos> What's a manhole doing in the middle of the woods?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Perhaps that's why our killer had a crowbar with him.<eos> Cut through the lock here with a blowtorch, and used it to open it.
Seemed like a better idea than drinking the water.<eos> The attack was thwarted, Watson.<eos> Don't let your lizard brain run away with you.<eos> The manager gave me the security video of the fight that Marcus was in.<eos> I still have to review it, but I think you were right to doubt that Roy was there by coincidence.
‐ I think they're gonna let us go.<eos> Don't be afraid.<eos> ‐ I'm not. ‐ Hey...<eos> I, uh... I came here looking for a new life, and I found it with you.<eos> ‐ I found it with you.
Well, did you fix the pipe like you fixed the brakes on the truck?<eos> - Come on, guys.<eos> - Brakes work fine, Dad.<eos> What doesn't work so good is your reflexes, your eyesight and that gate you plowed through.<eos> The fuckin' gate wouldn't have swung shut if you'd leveled it out.
I don't know.<eos> Horse?<eos> Aw, that is so sweet.<eos> - Beau, did you make this?<eos> - Yeah, my father made it for me.
Horse?<eos> Aw, that is so sweet.<eos> - Beau, did you make this?<eos> - Yeah, my father made it for me.<eos> I gave it to Rooster and Colt.
So... you guys are all good?<eos> SportsCenter.<eos> Yeah, no, it's a company phone, Mary.<eos> Just send me a picture.<eos> I'll delete it.
- She's six!<eos> - Jesus.<eos> So, I said, "Honey.<eos> Honey, look, there's Elsa from Frozen!"<eos> And she turned to look, and I grabbed her cell phone and I threw it overboard.
Dog food's on six, razors are on eight... and ten items or less seems to be more of a suggestion than a hard-and-fast rule.<eos> Oh, man... what a fucking day.<eos> Dude, you can't drink beer in here.<eos> All right, my manager made that very clear.<eos> I'm not drinking it, just sampling it.
Oh, man... what a fucking day.<eos> Dude, you can't drink beer in here.<eos> All right, my manager made that very clear.<eos> I'm not drinking it, just sampling it.<eos> How else am I supposed to know if I like it?
So, are you here alone, or...?<eos> You look great!<eos> This dress is beautiful!<eos> Oh, thank you.<eos> I found it in the trunk of a car I bought. Oh.
That wasn't '86. That was '87.<eos> The reason we were late was because of that damn Hands Across America that you made me do.<eos> Hands was '86, and you thanked me afterwards because you got to hold hands with someone that was holding hands with Willie Nelson.<eos> What the hell was that whole thing about, anyway?<eos> Hunger? Hand somebody a sandwich in San Francisco and you pass it on down the line till some bum gets ahold of it in Boston?
- I love it. - [Chuckles]<eos> Knock, knock.<eos> Happy Valentine's Day... or, as I call it, "the best night to go to the grocery store."<eos> And here is your Valentine's gift.<eos> I wrapped it myself in the office, and then, like a dingdong, I left it there, so...
My father spoke very well of you.<eos> Do you have something to say?<eos> I say we have no enemies in Eoferwic.<eos> Yet there are many foes who will attack our lands when we are gone.<eos> I gave you men to protect my land and the land of my neighbours, not to abandon it.
I like that outfit you got Denise.<eos> Yeah, um... it's nice to mix it up so she's not always wearing sweatpants and a hat that says "Ratch."<eos> Yeah, well...<eos> I remember when she was in the eighth grade. She wore a John Starks Knicks jersey to school the whole year.<eos> Then she spilled gravy all over it, and she still wore it for another month.

She wore a John Starks Knicks jersey to school the whole year.<eos> Then she spilled gravy all over it, and she still wore it for another month.<eos> I had to sneak up in her room and take it to give it to the Goodwill.
We make a kind of clubhouse with no boys allowed.<eos> I usually sit next to Jane, but sometimes Jane sits with her big sister, Prissy.<eos> Tillie sits on the other side of Josie.<eos> You'll need to gauge the situation accordingly since we always sit the same way.<eos> Everybody shows what they brought for lunch and then we divide it equally.
- Give it to me.<eos> - You're crazy.<eos> It's not your knife.<eos> Father gave me this knife.<eos> I want it.
Father gave me this knife.<eos> I want it.<eos> I will kill Lagertha with it.<eos> I will kill Lagertha with Father's knife!<eos> Well, you can't have it.
I will kill Lagertha with it.<eos> I will kill Lagertha with Father's knife!<eos> Well, you can't have it.<eos> That's enough!<eos> Give it to me!
I don't want to, Ubbe.<eos> All I'm saying is that, for those who are still brave enough to raid and find adventure, then I will lead them.<eos> You can put on an apron and settle down if you want to.<eos> It will take a great man, Ivar.<eos> To stake a claim here. Defend it.
I'm looking forward to seeing Miss Josephine again and staying overnight in a guest room.<eos> Diana says that the manse is ever so elegant.<eos> Oh, Marilla.<eos> I wish I had something of value to contribute.<eos> We can sell it back to the shop on our way.
- Oh, yeah, me too.<eos> - Let's get outta here.<eos> - You wanna go to the guest house?<eos> Um... Actually, no.<eos> You know what? Dennis forgot that he-- he Airbnb'd it.
Has your wife been infected?<eos> Has she got it?<eos> I just don't understand how.<eos> That means it's everywhere in here.<eos> Everywhere! - It must have been one of us.
I'm so glad y'all could make it.<eos> So, tell me, what's going on back home?<eos> Well, uh, Howard and Bernadette had their baby.<eos> Oh, that's wonderful!<eos> Now, have they decided to raise it Jewish or regular?
Ah. You want to decorate it tonight?<eos> Yeah, with gasoline and a match? Sure.<eos> I hope it kills us both.<eos> By the way, if anyone asks, the elevator shaft always had a tree in it.<eos> So Bernadette, if I express interest in your baby will you promise not to make me touch it? Sure.
Apparently, they're keen on me staying here.<eos> Are you all right?<eos> No, I'm at Dyad.<eos> Cos, what about you? What about your cure?<eos> Rachel administered it to me herself.
They want our biologies.<eos> You're saying the baby healed in, like, hours?<eos> Yes.<eos> Like Sarah, I make miracle babies.<eos> The doctor wants to cut it from my belly.
-Do you hear that?<eos> -[woman] Yes, I hear it in my microphone.<eos> I think you should probably turn the cameras off. I don't know.<eos> [woman] Can we get the metal thing down?<eos> [Mendelow] I kind of don't wanna touch it.
-I guess I just wanna hear your perspective of the change that you've seen over time.<eos> Then it was...<eos> it was a totally different mindset, because the reef was there forever, there was no question about it.<eos> -Yeah.<eos> -I even wondered why you would wanna make it a marine park.
- It'll go away in no time.<eos> - That's the HCG.<eos> - Oh, shit.<eos> And right next to it, the testosterone.<eos> Pop it through the skin.
Those bottles were given from Nikita Kamaev.<eos> "Grigory Rodchenkov, who ran the laboratory that handled testing for thousands of Olympians, said he developed a three-drug cocktail of banned substances that he mixed with liquor and provided to dozens of Russian athletes, helping to facilitate one of the most elaborate<eos> and successful doping ploys in sport history."<eos> Join and support our fight for fair play.<eos> The athletes deserve it.
You tell Julia, "Thank you, but no."<eos> Okay.<eos> You're so easy to boss around.<eos> I don't care what happens to my dead brain.<eos> It's either I give it to Julia, or maggots eat it.
Um... no, thanks.<eos> I think I've escaped my real life long enough.<eos> I don't know why I said that.<eos> I love my life. I love it.<eos> Love it.
By George, she's got it!<eos> I'm not going to lie to you, this means that your insurance premiums are going to go through the roof.<eos> In fact, everything is going to go through the roof, because I'm going to blow up the lab.<eos> We just need some kind of a trigger, first.<eos> But what are you going to blow it up with?
You're going to have to let me back in when I'm done.<eos> How long before the vents kick in?<eos> Four minutes.<eos> Doctor, you still there?<eos> There's no way of stopping the lab venting, so I'm going to sterilise the building by blowing it up.
Well, this company's on its last legs.<eos> Has been for a decade now.<eos> Not a whole lot of product coming through the door.<eos> I only pay an overnight guard to keep an eye on the building at night.<eos> Make sure teenagers don't vandalize it, that sort of thing.
Those trances... they'll become more frequent, more intense.<eos> He might even end up in a cell right next to me.<eos> Well, what can I do to help?<eos> You can start by giving me what I want.<eos> - We got to get behind this thing so we can smash it back to Hell.
- And then Scarelli would have walked.<eos> - No.<eos> I would have found another way to get him, legally!<eos> How many others were there?<eos> How many times did you break the law to enforce it?
Nothing to see. Nothing to see.<eos> Nothing to see here.<eos> It's just a man doing his job.<eos> I've never been able to drift properly.<eos> I can provoke a car, you know, into a slide, but I couldn't hold it there. It would always just spin off and crash.
Because I will be ill in two minutes.<eos> Is this going badly?<eos> While Jérôme went off to say hello to his breakfast... I continued plugging away.<eos> Begin power and begin counter-steer immediately. Now hold it.<eos> And soon, it started to click.
There's no denying that.<eos> Oh, yes!<eos> I've connected the steering wheel to my feet.<eos> This is a whole new feeling.<eos> This is not reacting to a slide, this is deliberately provoking it and keeping it right on the point.
Because of it, we are taken care of.<eos> Here, all are safe and warm.<eos> Your Royalness-- [clears throat] if I may, this food is amazing.<eos> It's even better than Balmeran cave bugs.<eos> I'm glad you enjoy it.
Look out the window.<eos> You two get somewhere safe.<eos> Okay, Hunk, change of plans.<eos> The queen is actually good and that thing is bad.<eos> Let's take it out.
[grunting] Kolivan told me you lasted longer than anyone ever has in those battles.<eos> -You don't have to keep this up.<eos> -What are you talking about?<eos> Just give them the knife and let's get out of here.<eos> I can't give it to them, Shiro.
It doesn't matter where I come from.<eos> I know who I am.<eos> We all need to work together to defeat Zarkon.<eos> If that means I give up this knife, fine.<eos> Take it.
That's good. Otherwise it's just more of the same. Damn it!<eos> - I bought 12 litres of that stuff.<eos> - Did you? Why so much?<eos> You know you can't sell this on, right?<eos> How much would it cost... to have you purify it here, in your lab?
I know enough to think that this would be a good advancement.<eos> - Are you done now? - Only trying to help.<eos> Are you done? I'm going to work.<eos> - Leopold? - Yes. Vilma chose his name.<eos> Before giving her that last treatment, we tried it on Leopold.
I was only three or four down from the admiral.<eos> The way it started is the Japanese airlines, 747, was coming from the Northwest, going across the Alaskan territory.<eos> So, his radar is picking up a target.<eos> He sees this target with his eye.<eos> And the target, the way he described it,
Just in a matter of seconds.<eos> One minute off the coast of Maine, and the next minute it's in Norfolk headed south towards Florida.<eos> After that we found out that it wasn't the Russians.<eos> They didn't care who it was or where it was from.<eos> They wanted it, and wanted it bad.
You're gonna have to get braces again.<eos> Oh, Meemaw and Russ.<eos> So that is what she looks like.<eos> All right, let's eat.<eos> [Jacqueline giggles] [Duke] So you found it.
Why?<eos> Because... tradition.<eos> And proper penmanship is a lost art, like drunk driving.<eos> I just want it, okay?<eos> I want it because Russ has it.
Because... tradition.<eos> And proper penmanship is a lost art, like drunk driving.<eos> I just want it, okay?<eos> I want it because Russ has it.<eos> How could Meemaw give it to him instead of me?
That's what the day's about!<eos> Would you rather have the balcony or the throne?<eos> Well, fine, damn it.<eos> But can he at least give you the first official wave?<eos> I'll just take it.
Parabiosis?<eos> Are you joking?<eos> He's bleeding kids too?<eos> No, it's just plasma.<eos> Mud, parabiosis means he is processing young blood and transfusing it.
And Thad Peterson? You were right.<eos> The Chinese were lying.<eos> He's the only one still unaccounted for.<eos> The admiral says there's still a chance to save the boat.<eos> Let it go down.
Not very hard, then.<eos> I need to talk to you.<eos> Okay.<eos> I'm done.<eos> With the speechwriting, I don't want to do it anymore.
- You're worried about Aidan.<eos> Do you call him anything for short?<eos> Why would you ask me that?<eos> I don't know if the president, or vice president, has informed you, but Mac is fine.<eos> It's what he knows is the problem, and who he may have told it to.
Where is this intelligence coming from?<eos> Well, it's all there in the briefing.<eos> But if we know this is going to happen, well, then why aren't we stopping it before it does?<eos> Francis held on to your resignation letter.<eos> And he wants to tear it up.
Or is it for some personal gain?<eos> Perhaps to try to fill the small hole in your soul that you sold off a long time ago?<eos> - Mr. President.<eos> - No, no, no.<eos> This is my opening statement, and I will give it in full.
And if you don't, I will be forced to renege on that resignation.<eos> That would be outrageous.<eos> Well, it isn't official until I submit a signed letter.<eos> And what would that do to the rest of your presidency? What would be left of it?<eos> Claire, if you don't do it, you're gonna risk being married to a felon.
Who would do that?<eos> Who would take something so beautiful and turn it into something so ugly?<eos> How did the guy get the costume?<eos> Oh, who knows?<eos> Your father gave it to charity.
Please don't make me part of this.<eos> Anyway, when it's over, feel free to share your thoughts...<eos> What you liked, what you loved, but also the negatives...<eos> What went over your head, any words you didn't know.<eos> I'm submitting my latest play to a young playwrights festival, but I want to hear it out loud first to be sure I've hit all my emotional marks.
And the 2 came out.<eos> The 2 was, like, okay, it's an improvement.<eos> Really, like, Tinker Hatfield saved that whole... scheme, 'cause when he came in and brought his design to it, and then Jordan kept on becoming a better ballplayer,<eos> Jordan had the ability to draw people's attention beyond the nucleus of the ballplayer community.<eos> Tinker had a way of somehow grasping that ethos... and combining it with the greatness of Jordan... and fusing that into a sneaker, so that by the Jordan 3, 4, 5 and beyond, the Jordan brand becomes larger than life.
That recording of you banging on that piece of wood screaming, "Let me out of here!"<eos> It's a real shame I'm gonna miss that.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> That accident that Manny caused earlier, gave me quite a start.<eos> So I figured I'd pull everything out and put it back in a safer fashion.
Gloria, could you plug this in for me?<eos> I want to dust off some of this stuff.<eos> Did you call me outside just for that?<eos> I got a back situation.<eos> Maybe Manny mentioned it.
What have you done?<eos> Geez, it seems like Joe's crib's damaged beyond repair!<eos> No, no, it's fine.<eos> It just Froggered across the street.<eos> Leave it there.
I was babysitting my uncle Joe and got too drunk to drive home!<eos> What is this thing?<eos> ! The Barnacle.<eos> They stick it on your car when you have unpaid parking tickets.<eos> I couldn't let my parents see it, because I knew they'd just overreact and lecture me about being irresponsible, and I couldn't pay to remove it because I just maxed out my credit card on these insanely expensive pair of sunglasses.
Yeah. Okay.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Mm-hmm.<eos> Are we sure this is the best way to do this?<eos> All we have to do is make sure that my parents don't see it by moving it down the street.
This isn't mine.<eos> I knew the perspective was off.<eos> It's Cam's fault.<eos> He made me copy it from a photo.<eos> You know what? I accidentally destroyed the original, and I couldn't live without it.
I'll, uh... I'll see you in the kitchen.<eos> - So, this is a real Vanderkoff.<eos> - Yeah, yeah. It feels good to finally be free of that secret.<eos> Yeah, it's just great to have everything out in the open.<eos> That expensive painting you bought me over there, I moved it to cover up a hole I made in the wall.
The necklace we picked out for Eleanor was a bad idea. - She has so much jewelry already.<eos> - Of course she does.<eos> - She's a Princess.<eos> - Alright.<eos> So why didn't stripey pants the elf tell me that - when we picked it out?
- You did say that.<eos> Fine.<eos> Family gym.<eos> So he's in the family gym and he's seeing Eleanor, neither of which has anything to do with you.<eos> If you've a problem with Jasper, just say it.
It's just more money for me.<eos> [Jacqueline] Exactly. You're making money off of people that hate you.<eos> It's like if I made money off brunettes.<eos> And think about it.<eos> When a fan buys a jersey, they keep it for life, but when a protester buys a jersey, they burn it and buy another one next week.
So, one day, nine-year-old kid, we're hanging out.<eos> He sees me take an antidepressant, put it in my mouth.<eos> He's, like, "What's that?"<eos> I was, like, "An antidepressant.<eos> I do it to make myself feel better..."
That shit is breathtaking.<eos> So, yeah, like, basically, the way Chappelle's Show ended, I was forced out of hiding.<eos> I tried to hide behind the woman, and she kind of forced me out of hiding.<eos> Like, hiding kind of comes naturally to me.<eos> And there's part of me that still loved to do it.
Did you see the video of the woman who walked around New York, got harassed the whole time?<eos> Different dudes, like, "What's up, baby?<eos> Where you going?" Ten hours straight.<eos> She put the video online.<eos> My female friends see it.
This is just who he is."<eos> And I spent the day with him that day, and then I went back the next day and the day after that, and on the fourth day, I got a phone call from my sister.<eos> She goes, "Hey, Neal, did you tell Dad you didn't want to be in his will?"<eos> I was, like, "Let me guess... I'm not in it?"<eos> She's, like, "You're not in it, but he wants to change it."
She goes, "Hey, Neal, did you tell Dad you didn't want to be in his will?"<eos> I was, like, "Let me guess... I'm not in it?"<eos> She's, like, "You're not in it, but he wants to change it."<eos> Come talk to him about it."<eos> So, I go down there and I talk to him, and he goes, "Neal, do you remember telling me to take my money and shove it up my ass?"
I was, like, "I guess I'll open it."<eos> Which, by the way, isn't in the commercials.<eos> It's not like, "Listen to music.<eos> Take selfies. Open wills."<eos> So, I opened it on the street in New York, and I'm scrolling down, and it says, like, "My son Joe gets one-tenth.
[narrator] It's been said that behind every great man is a great woman.<eos> It's been said so often, Coco actually believed it.<eos> In fact, there was no version of her plan that didn't involve a great man.<eos> I came across your prep school yearbook.<eos> Thought you might like to have it.
Thank God for the abs.<eos> ♪ Oh, rubbing on a nipple ♪ [Reggie] Our pain is why we're out in these streets.<eos> Exactly, and I'm not talking a regular protest.<eos> We need to shut shit down.<eos> Well, maybe the system doesn't work because you refuse to use it.
I hope not much because my gravity generator is not going to run forever!<eos> I don't know how much longer I can hold Zarkon's fleet in this position by myself!<eos> [Pidge] You won't have to!<eos> Good timing.<eos> Okay, we've got Zarkon's ship right where it needs to be.
And now, I need you to pay your mother a visit.<eos> Need to assure certain loyalties.<eos> Security on several fronts.<eos> Well, then, let me ask after this escaped subject.<eos> Why capture it when you should have it eradicated?
It's another one of P.T.'s research subjects.<eos> He's been experimenting on someone up at the house.<eos> This thing attacked Ray.<eos> Like a wild animal.<eos> So how are you gonna calm it down?
Little tricks and then, maybe even gain Rachel's trust? Yeah?<eos> Well.<eos> That is the hustle, isn't it?<eos> How do you go about that? How do you gain someone's trust?<eos> You have to figure out what they want first. And then give it to them without them realising it.
We have to know if the trait is heritable.<eos> You're going to harvest her eggs.<eos> This is where it got in.<eos> But it's injured.<eos> We'll find it.
- You didn't?<eos> - No.<eos> - But you use this phone.<eos> - Yes.<eos> They will trace it.
And now he's just cured?<eos> He's ready to be a father to Chivonne?<eos> Look, before you talk to her, I think...<eos> I'm not going to talk to her.<eos> I want her in my life, I have to earn it.
They were inflicted with a pointed metal object, perhaps a hammer claw or garden trowel.<eos> Well, whatever it was, the killer took it with him when he left.<eos> Who brings a gun and a garden tool to commit a murder?<eos> Hopefully, this might provide some insight.<eos> I resisted the temptation to examine it before I could establish proper chain of custody.
Was she named for Atticus from "to kill a mockingbird"?<eos> Yes.<eos> What a hero.<eos> I heard Harper Lee released another book.<eos> Did you read it?
It's a pity about Ravn's research, but it's only of academic importance.<eos> - It's important to me.<eos> - We understand that.<eos> But pharmaceutically speaking, the interesting stuff is inside you.<eos> We don't have to understand the workings in detail to use it.
Oh, I miss him so much.<eos> I'm here for you, Mimi.<eos> Whatever you need--<eos> The gel is slipping into my leg again!<eos> Push it up! Push it up!
It is a samurai's life.<eos> "Shoji the money"...<eos> Or the hair, in this case.<eos> Is he putting that back on his head?<eos> - He put it back.
He actually caught it at the right time.<eos> I think he caught it at the right time.<eos> You just have to get those legs over, and once you get them over, don't take them down!<eos> Very well!<eos> He had a problem, but he managed to overcome it.
Anson Gephardt is a Middle Eastern affairs specialist with a 30-year career in military intelligence behind him.<eos> He knows better than anyone how to falsify such a thing, but consider the context.<eos> He's a war hawk with a bee up his bum about the government in Tehran.<eos> And that video wasn't on the USB drive that Sydney Garber gave us.<eos> Gephardt added it to the Fidel Files himself?
It's what he had in mind all along.<eos> That's why he was so keen to get his hands on the files.<eos> They're a Trojan horse.<eos> If he had posted this online by itself, there'd be a million questions about whether it was real, where it came from.<eos> People would just say he filmed it in his basement, but now the shoe's on the other foot.
If he had posted this online by itself, there'd be a million questions about whether it was real, where it came from.<eos> People would just say he filmed it in his basement, but now the shoe's on the other foot.<eos> You've got to prove it isn't real.<eos> Everything else in the Fidel Files is.<eos> Well, the news has certainly latched onto it.
[Mukwege] Glory be to the Lord.<eos> [all] Amen.<eos> [Platon] The crisis in the Congo is very complicated.<eos> It's a mineral-rich country, but with that mineral wealth has also come great corruption, rebels, civilians, militia.<eos> The underlying notion of the Congo is that if you want territory, you take it.
He was working for the Design Academy Eindhoven, which I had never heard of.<eos> [Peña] When we were having a head of department meeting, I was asked if I knew someone that they could recommend for a new design department that was going to be created called Wellbeing.<eos> I said, "Oh, maybe there's this lady, Ilse Crawford."<eos> I only knew about her name and her work from the magazine, Elle Decoration.<eos> She wrote a book, Sensual Home, and for some reason, I never bought it.
I got a job designing record covers at CBS Records in the '70s.<eos> I'd combine the illustration with typography that related to the illustration or contrasted it.<eos> [Bierut] I first became aware of Paula's name in high school in the '70s.<eos> I'd spend three hours in a record store. I'd stand at those racks and look at the covers.<eos> I'd be like, "Wow, I really like the way that cover looks." I'd turn it over and see Paula Scher's name, over and over again.
For me, that's the fun.<eos> I've started trying to create a process in the identities that I make, where I go back and revisit them in five or ten years, 'cause sometimes they need tweaking.<eos> It's hard to make that a guess, and so you want to design something that can be adapted to its time.<eos> I've redesigned the Public Theater logo three times, and nobody even knows it.<eos> I've tightened it up, moved it apart, changed the font.
In 1918, he survived an assassination attempt.<eos> When he found out that the bullets used to shoot him were dipped in poison, he became obsessed.<eos> He started a secret lab called the "special room."<eos> its sole purpose was to weaponize poisonous substances to assassinate people anonymously, and that lab still exists to this day.<eos> Putin uses it.
Where?<eos> In the courtyard, outside my office.<eos> It was a beautiful day.<eos> And where did you buy lunch?<eos> I brown-bagged it, like always.
Breakfast isn't ready.<eos> I'm hungry. Hey?<eos> I'm talking to you!<eos> The iron is in the closet.<eos> You can iron it yourself.
-Yes.<eos> [Alba] And suddenly, just when you think that you have everything under control... that your life is ruled by reason, someone will awaken your sleeping heart.<eos> But if you were led by reason, you would surely run far away.<eos> But you can't run forever.<eos> Because the heart is alive, and you can't stop it from following its path... even if you know that path will end up hurting you.
-[whispers] It's my savings.<eos> -[both chuckle] 100 pesetas?<eos> Are you implying that we don't pay much?<eos> I want to invest in your project.<eos> Consider it an investment.
You made that very clear.<eos> And that's why you slept with Carlos?<eos> At least now it's clear what you're up to.<eos> You came for money, and you're staying for it.<eos> But now you're not taking it from a safe.
The money, good.<eos> -This is for the papers.<eos> -[Alba] No.<eos> -Yes, Lidia.<eos> -No, you need it more, Ángeles.
Do you think our father left you with nothing?<eos> I only hope he took into account the efforts Francisco has made for the company and this family.<eos> I think he took that into account when he made him director, didn't he?<eos> I bet he hasn't left me a generous income.<eos> -He was afraid I'd squander it.
Nonetheless, that run puts Santiago in first place with 110 points.<eos> It was enough.<eos> As I said at the beginning, I'll get to Level 3.<eos> I'm not competing against them, just myself.<eos> I wanted to finish it.
- Loses the grip.<eos> - Slipped off.<eos> Oh, how disappointing.<eos> I don't know why I lost the rope.<eos> I had it and then...
Oh, he's into the blood!<eos> And lastly, Tabito Okayasu, an actor and parkour athlete from Japan.<eos> Banzai!<eos> He was one of the few to conquer the rope on Faceplant.<eos> He's got it!
"gangs."<eos> This chicken is expensive because I'm paying for the hobbies it had when it was alive?<eos> This chicken's $20 a pound because it played the cello and it liked to surf.<eos> That's an awesome chicken!<eos> Why are we eating it?
"Because I'm going to bed, dude!<eos> It's, like, late!"<eos> "And how are you gonna find a man in your dreams?"<eos> As a tomboy, what I wear... Now, what I'm wearing, this is like my typical outfit.<eos> T-shirt, jeans, sneakers, I love it, right?
There must be some kind of explanation. Where is Isaac?<eos> Where is my son?<eos> Don't ask.<eos> Structure of a pig's brain is similar to a human's.<eos> So by connecting it to mine, we can flash the device.
Where is my son?<eos> Don't ask.<eos> Structure of a pig's brain is similar to a human's.<eos> So by connecting it to mine, we can flash the device.<eos> Make it safe for removal.
Release me and I'll tell you.<eos> Jamie, what the...<eos> Not now, Mitch.<eos> That missed your MP joint.<eos> If I get it out in the next eight minutes, it won't cause nerve damage.
I don't know.<eos> But this egg, I think it's calling for help.<eos> The razorbacks have come for it.<eos> I've seen this kind of long distance communication before in mutated lions, but that was nowhere near this powerful.<eos> If that thing is what they want, I say let them have it.
But this egg, I think it's calling for help.<eos> The razorbacks have come for it.<eos> I've seen this kind of long distance communication before in mutated lions, but that was nowhere near this powerful.<eos> If that thing is what they want, I say let them have it.<eos> We can't leave it here.
This new hybrid has grown from a tissue sample into a fully-developed embryo in a matter of hours.<eos> If I can study it, somehow isolate the hormones responsible, this embryo could pave the way to reversing the effects of the TX-gas.<eos> You really playing the "we have to save the world" card again?<eos> This could be the key to solving human sterilization.<eos> We cannot leave it behind.
Isaac, don't move.<eos> Everyone stand still.<eos> Why isn't it attacking?<eos> It's looking for the egg.<eos> Then that's give it to him.
- It's this way.<eos> If this isn't about the hybrids, why are you here?<eos> An emergency government protocol has been initiated in the tri-county area.<eos> What protocol?<eos> We have an introductory video that explains it better than I could.
In England.<eos> That was what Brexit was all about. Right?<eos> They made it seem like it was about the economy, but it wasn't. The truth was it was fundamentally people who wanted their country back.<eos> It never went anywhere.<eos> But they still wanted it back.
Everything about Barack. Barack Obama was, by far, the coolest president that has ever existed.<eos> Just everything about the man, you know?<eos> That confidence, the smile, the swag.<eos> When you notice Barack...<eos> I would notice it in the small things, like when he'd step out of Air Force One.
Hello?<eos> Hey, buddy, you still looking for a place to live?<eos> Uh... yeah.<eos> Why do you ask?<eos> You know, we have the extra bedroom, and if you need it, it's yours.
Very well, but, uh, if you don't mind, I'd still like to pause for effect.<eos> Now...<eos> You've recently moved in with Dr. Fowler, yes?<eos> I have.<eos> Clearly, your old room represents an escape hatch, and without it, you're forced to confront the terrifying reality of being trapped in a relationship with Amy forever.
Mm.<eos> I went to your office Christmas party?<eos> You know, I like harp lessons, but I'm thinking of switching to elevator repair lessons.<eos> What are you working on?<eos> I was thinking about your experiment on the neuroscience of decision making, and I realized, if we connect it to the measurement problem in quantum mechanics, we have a chance to disprove the role of consciousness in the Copenhagen Interpretation.
Someone help carry them!<eos> Hurry, over here.<eos> Bring the molecular tape!<eos> Fusata.<eos> Shall I wrap it?
You're right, Jack. You are right.<eos> Hey, give us a minute, will you?<eos> I'm sorry I was the first one of us to find happiness.<eos> Well, I didn't even have to look;<eos> I already had it.
It could not be shown as propaganda.<eos> It was just too brutal.<eos> There was just too much carnage.<eos> [narrator] Capra was in Washington, anxiously awaiting delivery of the footage.<eos> His team packaged it into a newsreel that was distributed to theaters around the country.
-How'd they get slugged?<eos> -Machine gun from a plane.<eos> [Greengrass] The idea of... of expendables, those that have to sacrifice themselves for the greater good, he'd seen it.<eos> He'd seen it with his own eyes.<eos> He'd documented it.
You can make it out to Kidnap Solutions LLC.<eos> People pay you to kidnap them?<eos> For the simulated experience of high stakes abduction, yes.<eos> I'm not sure I understand.<eos> Well, you might think of it as a kind of alternative therapy.
Who?<eos> You talking that way to Santa?<eos> My ex, Jason.<eos> Deadbeat asshole.<eos> I said I wanted to get Luke a bike, but he insisted he'd get it, and now it's Christmas Eve and nothin'.
Shouldn't come as a surprise, he's a lot like you.<eos> He's nothin' like me.<eos> My father gave me that knife. I said, "Thank you, sir," and shook his hand.<eos> You know, that's the warmest memory you ever shared with me.<eos> And later that night, I stuck it through a possum's head that was eatin' my mother's garden.
Every Christmas.<eos> I got a little somethin' for you.<eos> A book?<eos> Dad, I'm not sure you know me so well.<eos> Just open it.
I'm just telling you this as a black dude.<eos> I support your movement.<eos> But if you want to take some advice from a Negro, pace yourself.<eos> These things take a while.<eos> Just 'cause they passed the law doesn't mean they're gonna like it.
Birdy. Do you think the Sally Sweet script is lousy?<eos> I really couldn't say, Mr. Brady.<eos> Haven't read that one yet.<eos> I did love The Wizard of Oz.<eos> Mr. Mayer sent it to Mr. Stahr.
No, this time you get to ask the questions.<eos> About what?<eos> Well, I know a secret.<eos> About you.<eos> And you can ask me as many questions as you like to figure it out.
I knew it was coming up. -Mm-hmm.<eos> -I did know that.<eos> -I bought you a present.<eos> -What'd you bring me?<eos> Well, I didn't bring it. I'm gonna have to mail it.
And if they're from high school...<eos> they're $200. It comes with a Polaroid of me wearing them.<eos> Not while I was in high school. [chuckles]<eos> And here's a painting. I painted it with my boobs. [chuckles]<eos> I'll put it on eBay and, like, advertise that it comes with a video.
She definitely is a role model, you know...<eos> If it wouldn't have been for her, I would have done boy-girl immediately, right off the bat.<eos> [Bonnie] I just have the white bra and panty set.<eos> Well, I really like that top.<eos> -Could you wear it with the shorts?
And I thought,<eos> "Yeah, maybe I should try to make an adult movie."<eos> [man] I'm, uh...<eos> I'm looking for the pilot.<eos> So, I wrote the script and I shot it. and after a few weeks, I had two million downloads.
He wanted to pay them.<eos> He asked me for the money.<eos> What money? They were extorting him; They wanted $50,000 to keep quiet.<eos> And they thought Houston, a college student, would have 50 grand lying around?<eos> I'm sure they figured that a future first rounder would be able to get his hands on some money if he really wanted it.
FBI director James Comey announced the bureau is renewing its investigation into her personal e-mail server.<eos> Crooked Hillary Clinton.<eos> It's not clear if the tightening in the polls stems from FBI director James Comey's widely condemned disclosure.<eos> Donald Trump has taken this country to the brink.<eos> And tomorrow, voters are likely to take it back.
We're looking for a... missing persons, yeah.<eos> White female, 30s, brand-newly deceased.<eos> Your jerk-off partner's already back there.<eos> Our what?<eos> Eyeglasses, dark hair, gray at the temples, mouth like somebody used a tomato capper to scoop out a pig's asshole and glued it under his nose?
Well, why is there hot sauce on it?<eos> With a couple of hairs stuck in it.<eos> - Oh, sweet Christ.<eos> - What?<eos> Did you beat a Guinea pig to death with your service weapon, slather the thing in hot sauce and eat it?
Man, I gotta warn Trexler Dutch wants to kill him.<eos> Mainly because Trexler hasn't paid me for my work yet, but... also because... say what you will about der robotik ubermenschen. Sure can punch good.<eos> I'm sorry, darlin', but you're gonna have to repeat that.<eos> I said,<eos> "I had a little towel, "but I lost it walking here, so I need your clothes, your boots, and your motorcycle."
Who would go to all that trouble?<eos> Johann schmidt, aka the red skull, in my Nazi Kidnap-Slash-Rape fantasy. Ew!<eos> Shut up.<eos> Look, tonight your brother is going to drop the ransom money at the Griffith observatory.<eos> Archer is going to retrieve it and bring it to me.
Okay. Although, come to think of it...<eos> If Figgis doesn't square things with Trexler, he's walking around dead and just doesn't know it yet.<eos> Not unlike Frankenstein's monster!<eos> Or you. And so, since you know where those bent coppers are taking the money...<eos> Go get it!
But rare doesn't mean there's just one in the whole world.<eos> When I lost that first auction, I went and found another one.<eos> And I won it.<eos> Go look at my Web history.<eos> Better yet, I can bring you the book I bought, and you can see it for yourself.
Nobody looks at you, That you are different.<eos> You will not get the Same looks as I do.<eos> You know what people think when they do see me?<eos> When they see my headscarf?<eos> That I wear it because I have to Not because I want it.
You will not get the Same looks as I do.<eos> You know what people think when they do see me?<eos> When they see my headscarf?<eos> That I wear it because I have to Not because I want it.<eos> And when I say I wear it, Because I want it, I am brainwashed.
Perhaps I don't mean more time, but another time.<eos> I have been particularly tense.<eos> I have had a few people over for quick interviews, and I was anxious for them to go away as soon as possible.<eos> Our meeting will not be a quick interview.<eos> I think I would rather postpone it, knowing what it means.
Where'd you get this list?<eos> Through shared dreaming.<eos> Shared dreaming?<eos> It's using brainwaves to enter someone else's dream.<eos> I met someone who can do it.
Spit it out, you son of a bitch!<eos> What's with you, sir?<eos> I'll gouge your eyes out!<eos> This was my car.<eos> But some fucker stole it and sold it here.
He was a champion driver and he would have been 35 years old next week. Our hearts and our prayers go...<eos> The accident with Allan happened very early on, less than twenty minutes into the race, and it's bizarre because we're driving past it, and my mind was only thinking about how I can sort of,<eos> We were probably the last guys to know because we were out on track and we didn't pit until 3 hours into the race.<eos> The team had already made the decision that we're going to carry on and complete the race, and that was on the back of the wishes of allan's family.<eos> And then it was a case of, we need to try and win this race and dedicate it to Allan.
- Of course.<eos> The truth is, I usually take the first hour to offer you a glass of champagne and try to get to know you anyway.<eos> But the champagne is still cold, and we can just dive right in.<eos> You still double-billing to pay for that house in the Hamptons? No.<eos> I'm working late to pay for it.
This is a fight you started.<eos> And this is a fight that you cannot win.<eos> So you give me back my clients, or your legacy at Pearson Specter Litt is going to be that you were the one that put them in the ground.<eos> Let me get this straight.<eos> I got an offer for more money than I'll see my whole life, and you want me to turn it down based on a feeling that whatever happened to Chris
- I don't know what that means.<eos> Then listen to me right now.<eos> I know that you know my parents died in a car accident.<eos> But what you don't know is that after they did, a lawyer... came to my grandmother and made her an offer.<eos> She took it, instead of going to court.
She was so full of compassion for everyone and everybody.<eos> She had compassion for the Earth, and I think that's one of the reasons we entered the convent.<eos> Remember, it was the '60s.<eos> There was a complete change... in our society, in our culture, and in the Church.<eos> Vatican II was a big calling together of all leadership at the Catholic Church at the Vatican by the pope to look at religious life and to look at life in the Church and how it can be renewed.
"I can deal with this."<eos> I decided that I was going to go over and find my yearbook in my mother's attic... and I'm going to put a face on this.<eos> And then I could put some closure to it.<eos> And so I pulled out the yearbook.<eos> And when I opened it up, I saw Magnus' face.
On one side, it's marked 1712.<eos> "Right and prosperity to Scotland."<eos> That would've been prior to the 1745 rebellion.<eos> So, this sword's been around.<eos> I'd love to know who carried it.
He was gay.<eos> Back then, we're talking early '60s, that was not talked about, it was hush-hush.<eos> It was kept in the closet.<eos> That whole environment really messed him up.<eos> Billy couldn't stand it anymore.
And I never knew until I listened to that interview that this subject plagued my brother.<eos> I never knew it.<eos> We never, ever once discussed it.<eos> Did you hear the interview?<eos> You've heard it?
I'm 80 years old.<eos> Anyway, I could have been a much better father and a much better... husband, but anyway, it affected me a great deal.<eos> I want you all to think about something.<eos> Everybody has a secret that they don't want to admit.<eos> Come up here and stand up here, and admit it to everybody, because that's what you're asking me to do and that's what you're asking a 25-year-old to do.
We were playing hide-and-seek once, and I got stuck in a Portaloo.<eos> I thought she'd gone home.<eos> I was in there for six hours.<eos> I got the best photo of you and Raven.<eos> Totally posting it.
There's also some on, like, the nightstand.<eos> And, um, also, I noticed there's come all over my tits. It's...<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I just, you know, if there's a... I hate to complain.<eos> If there's an upgrade to be had, I would... in I'd take it."
Um, so, I was eating this peanut-butter-and-jam sandwich, and I was telling myself horror stories.<eos> And the horror story was... this jam is the nuns' period blood.<eos> But I had to eat it all.<eos> I was so scared of getting hit.<eos> I ate it like this.
And I... It felt... It was, like, so much relief.<eos> And then my friend John was standing in the corner.<eos> And I guess... I don't remember this. I was told this.<eos> And then, another time, like, my hands were tied down.<eos> That I served it?
You've been very vocal, but in the perfect amount.<eos> You're welcome.<eos> Like, the next time you wanna, like, be like, "Yay," for me or something, let's do this. You can go like this:<eos> Okay, the denouement.<eos> Did I say it right?
- June.<eos> - June?<eos> It just was June.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> I love it so much.
- Rachel, have you seen Mike?<eos> - He's not in his office. - Uh, he left earlier this morning for the clinic, so he must still be there.<eos> - Again?<eos> I told him to wrap that case up. - Harvey, he's working hard to live up to your deal and still come through for his other clients.<eos> - Well, right now I need him, and I'm getting a little tired of looking into his office and finding it empty.
Nothing.<eos> Bingo.<eos> "Dear Diary."<eos> Mom's old diary!<eos> Totally... shouldn't read it.
"Dear Diary."<eos> Mom's old diary!<eos> Totally... shouldn't read it.<eos> This is totally private.<eos> Totally reading it.
Just because you feel like you want something, it doesn't mean it's the right thing for your overall personal development.<eos> Exactly.<eos> Sometimes you need a friend or a family member, someone who really loves you, to show you the right way.<eos> I told Sam to donate Firefly's old tack to charity.<eos> I don't wanna see it around the yard.
This photo was taken outside their house.<eos> Hawthorne.<eos> Why would Pin lie to me?<eos> Maybe he's covering for someone.<eos> I found it in Sam's office along with a lot of unpaid bills.
My barn dance plans are kind of falling apart.<eos> Are you still going?<eos> I don't even have a dress.<eos> I might be able to help you there.<eos> I wore it for my school dance.
No offense, Mom, but weren't you born before style began?<eos> All right, let's take a look.<eos> It's actually cute.<eos> Don't sound so surprised.<eos> See if it fits.
See?<eos> Yeah, there's nothing.<eos> I am totally immune.<eos> I thought you might like a little memento.<eos> I... I will cherish it.
Which brings us to tonight.<eos> You see, over the years, I've written several plays for Gil and I to perform...<eos> - George, you remember the first?<eos> - The first play we ever did?<eos> - Yes. - Yes. I'll never forget it.
You go to 44th and 8th to that hand-job parlor?<eos> What's it called again, Shake Shack?<eos> Oh, yeah, come in our Wacky Shack and we'll shake you off, and there's a line of goddamn families going out of there?<eos> While you're waiting, here's a vibrating butt plug to stick up your tush.<eos> So I take this nasty thing and shove it in my prostate, while I give myself a shake off.
It's one pro bono.<eos> He just took it.<eos> He can drop it.<eos> I gave him my word.<eos> And you once gave your word to me and went back on it and I let it go.
Five without chili.<eos> We call it ají here.<eos> Well, same thing, right?<eos> We'll take the blow from here.<eos> We'll take it to Cuba... and then directly to Miami.
Great.<eos> Now lose it again.<eos> That shirt is terrible, bro.<eos> It's not even shiny.<eos> I love it.
Yeah.<eos> I remember I was at this picnic once. It was really cold.<eos> We were eating fennel out of these little cylindrical paper tubes.<eos> - It was taking me forever to eat.<eos> - Mm. I've been wearing it ever since.
Your grand opening is one week from today.<eos> - Oh, my! I've got a lot to do.<eos> - Okay!<eos> Excuse me, Mr. President.<eos> Thinking this through, why did you actually buy the camp if you knew you weren't gonna destroy it?
What will one coin buy me?<eos> Bit of dried goat.<eos> Haven't seen you before.<eos> I'm just passing through.<eos> I'll take it, thanks.
The Sleeping Soldier.<eos> It's a local legend.<eos> Sounds weirdly convenient to me, if you know what I mean.<eos> Exactly how much do you know about this, sir?<eos> I'm a Belmont... so I know you're a nomadic people who gather knowledge, memorize it, carry complete spoken histories with you.
Until then.<eos> Right.<eos> I'll come back later.<eos> See if you can find some beer.<eos> I could pee in a bucket and tell him it's beer.
And I'm here to be disciplined?<eos> Not as such.<eos> I have a gift for you.<eos> Your life, Belmont.<eos> Take it and go.
Evening.<eos> Good evening.<eos> As promised, here is the manuscript.<eos> Right on schedule.<eos> I will read it over carefully.
It was sold out when I looked in the bookstore.<eos> Really?<eos> That's fantastic, Michi!<eos> I doubt that it was sold out.<eos> They probably never even carried it.
I heard more than 400 thousand copies have been sold.<eos> Really?<eos> Amazing!<eos> Isn't that great?<eos> Lots of people are reading it.
Do you know why<eos> She was resented by a fan, right?<eos> That's what she gets for associating with Shin Michima.<eos> She sure was very stupid.<eos> She had talent, but she lacked the skill to use it.
And the distance and the money and Sam, we'll figure it out.<eos> Oh, that reminds me.<eos> Sam?<eos> We have the Clayton tour, so I won't be in school to give you your lunch money.<eos> But Evan's sister Beth will hold onto it and find you during fifth period.
The Lord does not break his covenants.<eos> The throne is there.<eos> - Where is the King?<eos> - He will come. And his house will last forever.<eos> Will a carpenter build it?
And I would like to apologize if my silly antics have cast a shadow over their achievements.<eos> I also know I was messing around after the 70 meter jump the other day.<eos> I was very excited.<eos> But I take jumping very seriously.<eos> In fact, I love it.
Time loops!<eos> You wanna get stuck reliving the same moment over and over forever... Or never having existed at all?<eos> Really should put the warnings before the spell.<eos> Your curiosity could have gotten you killed.<eos> You weren't manipulating the space-time continuum... You were breaking it.
Welcome back.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - Nice.<eos> Okay, we should probably get this equipment out of here.<eos> - They're gonna want it back.
Please, all of you.<eos> Fernando was down here when something crawled out of a wall vent, and...<eos> I heard him screaming, so I went to check, and that's when the "thing" was tossing Fernando all around the room.<eos> I thought it was gonna kill him.<eos> I shrieked when I saw it. I...
Are you okay?<eos> I'm quite well.<eos> That's good.<eos> You found my pipe.<eos> I got it at the dumpster yesterday.
Look, I assure you...<eos> No, no.<eos> No assurances from you. Only from us.<eos> Please, take a seat.<eos> We buy gold or diamonds, keep them in our secure vaults or we could send your money to Paris or our headquarters in London, other banks around the globe, deposit it, wire transfer to Panama.
Kinda like you.<eos> You look beautiful tonight, by the way.<eos> I have never seen you with a pocket scarf.<eos> - You like that?<eos> - No, I hate it.
You look beautiful tonight, by the way.<eos> I have never seen you with a pocket scarf.<eos> - You like that?<eos> - No, I hate it.<eos> - You hate it?
You know, Bob, I think I'm going to introduce you to Pablo.<eos> But there's a little problem I need you to fix first.<eos> Alcaino says Don Chepe's $10 million is frozen, which is actually Pablo Escobar's money.<eos> And he doesn't give a rat's ass that our government did it.<eos> He wants his money and it's not gonna be over until he gets it.
I read everything you wrote, and I fell in love with your voice and with the way your mind works.<eos> I fell in love with you.<eos> And all of a sudden, it was like I wasn't trapped anymore.<eos> My pointless life suddenly had meaning.<eos> And I wish I could take it back.
She inhabits Dr. Moone's body now.<eos> And where is this witch?<eos> In my pocket.<eos> Now tell him why she won't turn you into a frog.<eos> Some say the witch has a secret buried heart, and whoever finds it can control the witch.
My uncle Ivan was diagnosed with thyroid cancer... and there were all these new experimental drugs from Germany.<eos> Vanessa's already working on Plan A, B, all the way through Z.<eos> Me?<eos> I'm memorizing the details of her face.<eos> Like it's the first time I'm seeing it.
You know, sometimes I just wish my dad was still here.<eos> That I could, I don't know, talk to him, or even know what his laugh sounded like.<eos> I don't even know him, but I miss him.<eos> I understand.<eos> I don't even know where my home is, but I miss it, too.
You're the best I've ever seen.<eos> I promise I will do my best. So just keep safe and cozy inside ... while I clean up the mess here trying. And hopefully...<eos> What the fuck is that?<eos> - This is the needle for amniocentesis.<eos> We print it in, take a little amniotic fluid out and test it for abnormalities ... and also the DNA sample you want.
Realtors are Glengarry guys.<eos> You don't have myths.<eos> Right when I started, I caught this lead.<eos> Some high rise downtown.<eos> Only hitch was that it was slightly infamous.
No, James, look, it'll be okay.<eos> Look, we need to stay together.<eos> Yeah, you're right, you're right.<eos> Let's just keep the fire going.<eos> If he sees it, he can find his way back.
My parents died when I was a little boy.<eos> In many ways, El Toro has been like a father to me.<eos> Just as you will be to all of our people.<eos> This country needs a change.<eos> Yes, it does.
Well, if they don't want it...<eos> In the past, you see, they could sell it or throw it out.<eos> And the talk of the taxpayer money being wasted?<eos> Oh, I raised every dime privately that we spent on that restoration.<eos> I... I loved that house, and I wanted to share it with the American people. To impart a sense of America's greatness.
- You got it?<eos> - I did.<eos> Oh, fuck! Oh, fuck!<eos> How do you know this stuff isn't old?<eos> They throw it out every six hours. It's the law.
Well, I've never had anyone to ask.<eos> Well, don't eat the grass. Don't eat the grass.<eos> I guess I shouldn't knock it before I try it.<eos> It's not good.<eos> Don't do it.
You're finally happy?<eos> Now?<eos> I think so.<eos> Happiness is inside of all of us, right?<eos> Sometimes, you just need someone to help you find it.
Eat!<eos> No!<eos> Happiness isn't something you put inside.<eos> It's already there.<eos> Sometimes you just need someone to help you find it.
I have to go out. I don't want to leave it in the room.<eos> Okay.<eos> Eksê, I have a favor to ask.<eos> You've got a car, nay?<eos> Can I use it?
- Where you headed today?<eos> - Deepwater Horizon.<eos> What'd ya do on your downtime?<eos> I started working on that airboat again. Yeah?<eos> I'm upping it from 600 horsepower to 1,200 horsepower. And I got me a little, uh, Sensenich prop off that Super Cub.
- Lower the boat!<eos> - Let's go!<eos> - Oh, fuck this!<eos> - Oh, shit! Shit!<eos> - Put it out!
Tell me what's going on with your little special project.<eos> "Special project"?<eos> Sammy.<eos> I'm not... I'm afraid that project is going to die in RD.<eos> Oh, no, no, no, no, no. I gave it to you.
I'm not... I'm afraid that project is going to die in RD.<eos> Oh, no, no, no, no, no. I gave it to you.<eos> I teed it up perfectly.<eos> Are you kidding me?<eos> I put it right in your hands and you kick it out of bounds like that.
They put it in the cellars at Blackpool Tower.<eos> They're still there.<eos> Their machine?<eos> The experiment.<eos> They intend to do it again.
I think you got an anger issue.<eos> Anger is a weed growing in our garden.<eos> And what do you do when you find a weed?<eos> I don't know, but I bet you're gonna tell me.<eos> You pluck it out!
And you know it.<eos> I know! I know!<eos> Hey, who wants a birdie bath?<eos> I'm sorry, Red.<eos> I couldn't do it.
And my oath?<eos> - Your are deluding yourself!<eos> Nuptial vows not blessed by a minister of God neither heaven nor earth will recognise.<eos> My mind yields to your arguments, but my heart is deaf to reason and resists.<eos> You must overcome it.
it suits me, believe me.<eos> I live there all alone but I'm not afraid.<eos> I feel I can trust you, even though I don't know who you are...<eos> I'm not really sure who I am either.<eos> I've loved life and I love it still, and it still seems beautiful to me.
I live there all alone but I'm not afraid.<eos> I feel I can trust you, even though I don't know who you are...<eos> I'm not really sure who I am either.<eos> I've loved life and I love it still, and it still seems beautiful to me.<eos> Sure, you love it too, but you haven't lived long enough to see right into the things of this world.
What can that whistle mean?<eos> In that barrel, Johnson, there's a fortune.<eos> The boys cache their gold there.<eos> And they leave you all alone like this?<eos> Every night, they take it in tums to stay here and guard it.
The accountant, like CPA accountant?<eos> [INHALES SHARPLY]<eos> Okay.<eos> Say you're the head of the Sinaloa Cartel.<eos> Now, the cartels count their money by weighing it in 18-wheelers.
[SIGHS]<eos> [INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS]<eos> DANA:<eos> None of this makes sense.<eos> Why go through the trouble of skimming the money if you're gonna put it back?
Okay, I'm not following.<eos> He deposited money in Tel Aviv, and then he cycled it through Panama and put it back into his stores.<eos> Okay, why take it out and put it back?<eos> Well, initially he was just stealing in garden-variety tax evasion, but then he came up with a better idea.<eos> You see, by taking his own money, stealing it, and putting it back on his books...
Charitable contributions here to Harbor Neuroscience.<eos> Last year alone, that's gotta come to close to... $1,000,100.<eos> That one's not a cover. That's the real deal.<eos> I checked.<eos> So, you're telling me this guy risks his life doing forensic accounting for some of the scariest people on the planet, collects his fee, goes through all the trouble of laundering it, and then gives almost all of it away?
It's okay.<eos> Oh, I'm dying.<eos> Here. Take this.<eos> Take this phone... you big dumb American stranger.<eos> Here, take it.
Thanks for stepping in... to fight the Mongolian stomper today.<eos> I know you weren't fighting for me, per se... but, still, you're a man with a code... and I respect that.<eos> I'm willing to die for my loved ones.<eos> Without people to die for... no reason to live.<eos> Yeah, but there's no reason for life... if you don't take time to enjoy it.
No!<eos> "Bennie, sorry I had to take off.<eos> Don't take it personally.<eos> I'm leaving you this phone because I think it might be of use.<eos> All you have to do is figure out a way to charge it.
It's embedded in our DNA.<eos> Not because an equation tells us to, but because we feel it in here.<eos> And right now, I need your help.<eos> This looks promising. We can do the right thing.<eos> But we have to do it together.
Listen, I agree with you.<eos> We need to get ahead of this one.<eos> And we're all about transparency, after all.<eos> I'm the CEO, so I'm the one who needs to make the statement.<eos> We just need to make sure it's on our terms, not on theirs.
You really need your portfolio to know where you put $800 million?<eos> I don't put that much money anywhere.<eos> The algorithms control our day-to-day...<eos> But that's not how high-frequency trading is supposed to work, is it?<eos> They don't just put that much money in one place and just leave it there, do they?
I have cousins!<eos> -Welcome!<eos> -Welcome!<eos> Buns on a string.<eos> We call it a snacklace.
Oh honey.<eos> Oh honey, no.<eos> Kelpcake. I know I've got a problem.<eos> I know I'm-- And I'm so sorry.<eos> And all this time I've wanted to fix it and I can't and I try.
Mom and Dad killed by the virus.<eos> But it didn't kill you, did it?<eos> Not quite.<eos> That where the nickname came from?<eos> You fought it off.
You got it?<eos> Hey, you're not gonna hurt me. All right.<eos> Like that, but stronger.<eos> Good.<eos> Now at the end, you'll grab my wrist and pull it toward you.
Sit down, my boy.<eos> So, go on.<eos> The cow is a ruminant.<eos> This means that she ruminates.<eos> She eats the grass for the first time, but without chewing it.
So, go on.<eos> The cow is a ruminant.<eos> This means that she ruminates.<eos> She eats the grass for the first time, but without chewing it.<eos> Then she chokes it up again and chew it in peace.
- Terrific.<eos> And you know my father.<eos> Chief.<eos> And this is Mayweather.<eos> Mayweather's taking the good word and preaching it down south.
You will train.<eos> You will harden.<eos> You will become my elite, my Huntsmen.<eos> And nothing will ever, ever destroy you.<eos> Take it!
No.<eos> What happens?<eos> She'd be unstoppable.<eos> Where's my horse?<eos> I sent it off.
That's fancy.<eos> Yeah. And the best part is, they didn't even see it.<eos> They just saw the pictures online.<eos> I haven't even met them in person.<eos> It's crazy. Who buys a house without seeing it first?
But before you dismiss my younger foolhardy self, remember... Never doubt a man fighting for the one thing as powerful as any god. Three hundred, impossible.<eos> Love.<eos> Stop!<eos> This dress is hopeless.<eos> I need to buy some ribbon to even begin to make it suitable for the coronation.
I'm not even half done.<eos> Thoth, I only need...<eos> The answer to the riddle of the Sphinx.<eos> A child could deduce why you're here.<eos> Go ask the riddle and come back and relay it to me.
Thoth, I only need...<eos> The answer to the riddle of the Sphinx.<eos> A child could deduce why you're here.<eos> Go ask the riddle and come back and relay it to me.<eos> - I'll solve it.
I'm sorry for everything I've done to you.<eos> - Including this.<eos> - Accepted.<eos> I told you I'd steal your other eye.<eos> But you could have saved me some trouble and told me you didn't need it.
Go on.<eos> Go on.<eos> Land.<eos> This is no longer land.<eos> The moment I put a pin in the map, the day I descended into this godforsaken valley and cast my gaze upon it, it ceased to be land and became...
Consider this a recall.<eos> Now, you're gonna deliver a message to your boss.<eos> Mister, you already sent him a message, only you're not gonna like his answer.<eos> Tell him we have his town, we have his whole valley.<eos> He want it back, he's gonna have to make a deal with us.
At the table, one does not talk about money.<eos> - I don't see them anymore.<eos> Boil the meat properly, don't want any worms in it!<eos> My meat is not spoiled, citizen!<eos> - So roast it properly, girl.
- I could feel it, when we went.<eos> They looked like gypsies. - Now you're stuck here!<eos> Stop arguing!<eos> Perhaps there is some solution.<eos> Elise, please this paper to the Embassy of the Netherlands and the United Provinces and get it into the hands of Duke MacManus.
They looked like gypsies. - Now you're stuck here!<eos> Stop arguing!<eos> Perhaps there is some solution.<eos> Elise, please this paper to the Embassy of the Netherlands and the United Provinces and get it into the hands of Duke MacManus.<eos> In case of danger, swallow it.
No? So hurry.<eos> Have a nice evening.<eos> I'm late, I read my latest poem in the club of the Jacobins.<eos> I donated it to you.<eos> Do you want to hear it?
The songs were gettin' better, more interesting.<eos> # And I'm still... # There weren't, like, big plans.<eos> You know, sometimes it just unfolded. Complete fluke.<eos> OK, ready?<eos> John was not mechanically minded, and he took a tape on, and the tape had run off to the other reel, and he put it on like it was the start, but it was the end of the song and that's when the guitar came.
John was not mechanically minded, and he took a tape on, and the tape had run off to the other reel, and he put it on like it was the start, but it was the end of the song and that's when the guitar came.<eos> And he brings it in, "Ah, you've gotta hear this."<eos> And we said, great, we've gotta do that, so...<eos> # It is shining #<eos> And I always remember being in Brian Epstein's house and John playing it to Brian and to George Martin, and saying, "What do you think of this?" you know.
Life.<eos> That'll do me, I reckon.<eos> Take me out to Janus with you.<eos> - What?<eos> I want to see it.
Hannah, this is Tom, my husband.<eos> - Hello.<eos> - How do you do?<eos> I, uh...<eos> I liked what you said earlier in your speech about the light being there for whoever needed it.
Are you really going to lie to your paper like that?<eos> No. Not a lie.<eos> It's the truth.<eos> I've seen war, Marta.<eos> I know the truth of war, and I know how to tell it.
What the hell were you thinking?<eos> I don't know.<eos> What were you thinking?<eos> That picture is important.<eos> Publish it.
Ferocious, like Teresa.<eos> My cousin wants to know the opinion of a famous writer about her dress.<eos> Do you like it?<eos> I don't know why...<eos> I drew it myself.
I don't know why...<eos> I drew it myself.<eos> Yeah, I...<eos> It's at the dressmaker's.<eos> My boyfriend hasn't seen it yet, he's at the front.
My darling... May I say that your head is looking very, very big, today.<eos> I present you with a gift made entirely out of love.<eos> And also a little bit of metal and wood, of course.<eos> I know how you love the tiny things.<eos> I'll treasure it forever.
No. No, I don't.<eos> Go see them tomorrow.<eos> You got any idea how much I owe Debbie in child support?<eos> You've got enough in your front pocket to fix that problem right now.<eos> We can't spare it, you know that.
You like your steak?<eos> Yes, ma'am.<eos> Well, you've got a ways to go yet.<eos> Yeah, you'll be waiting around all day for me to finish this.<eos> I'll be here whether you finish it or not.
Who's there?<eos> Jacob, stop.<eos> He's my brother.<eos> Put the knife down.<eos> Put it down.
Please drink.<eos> No water for him!<eos> No, Judah.<eos> My life,<eos> I give it of my own free will.
- Perhaps I can...<eos> - He brought me to you.<eos> Send the boy.<eos> He and the sword are bound by fate.<eos> I have seen it.
You will not find it there, nor take it from here.<eos> Master Yu!<eos> Let him go.<eos> Release him.<eos> Give it to me now or he dies!
Not well enough.<eos> Come in.<eos> You're leaving.<eos> The sword cannot be kept here.<eos> Where are you taking it?
Hey, you and me is two different people.<eos> I done learned my mistake and I learned to do what's right by it.<eos> You still trying to get something for nothing.<eos> Life don't owe you nothing.<eos> You owe it to yourself. Ask Bono.
I'll see you all later.<eos> Wait a minute.<eos> You gonna say, "Thanks, Rose," but you ain't gonna look to see where she got that money from.<eos> You see how they do me, Bono?<eos> I know she got it from you, Pop.
You gonna say, "Thanks, Rose," but you ain't gonna look to see where she got that money from.<eos> You see how they do me, Bono?<eos> I know she got it from you, Pop.<eos> Thanks.<eos> I'll give it back to you.
While you be thinking about a TV, I got to be thinking about the roof or whatever else go wrong around here.<eos> Now if you had $200, what would you do?<eos> Fix the roof, or buy a TV?<eos> I'd buy a TV.<eos> And when the roof started to leak, if it needed fixing, I'd fix it.
Where you gonna get your money from? You done spent it on a TV.<eos> You gonna sit up in there, let that water run all over your brand-new TV?<eos> Pop, you got the money.<eos> I know you do.<eos> - Where I got it at?
I just asked you a question, woman.<eos> Can't I ask you a question?<eos> Troy, I don't want to get into it.<eos> Now, your food is in there on the stove.<eos> All you got to do is heat it up.
Hi.<eos> Hi.<eos> You used to sleep in my room?<eos> Yeah, that used to be my room.<eos> That's what Papa call it. "Cory's room."
(WHISTLES)<eos> Lose the scarf.<eos> The scarf?<eos> Why?<eos> If you're going to wear a dress like that, Clark, you have to wear it with confidence.
But it's not my life.<eos> It's not even close.<eos> You never saw me before.<eos> I loved my life.<eos> I really loved it.
- Ah, damn it! Come on.<eos> We have to move quickly, Mr. Regan.<eos> Hey, where's my phone?<eos> Where is it? Where is my phone?<eos> I got it.
Hey, where's my phone?<eos> Where is it? Where is my phone?<eos> I got it.<eos> Okay, that's one.<eos> Seriously, I can't find it.
What're you doing here?<eos> Looks like you and Michelle have built yourself quite a little empire.<eos> What do you want?<eos> I want to take what Michelle Darnell has built.<eos> I want her to realize that I have taken it away.
You left so suddenly.<eos> Okay, let them go.<eos> I'm the one you want.<eos> You know, I killed a man in Costa Rica with this sword.<eos> I guess you would call it my killing sword.
Probably a butterfly, then.<eos> ...I realized I was so far away from my home I couldn't find it.<eos> A few days later, I was picked up by Animal Control.<eos> I had a great thing going.<eos> But I had to go and mess it up.
Are you looking for anything in particular? Yeah.<eos> I'm looking for a book called "The Living City"<eos> You happen to have it in stock?<eos> I'm sure I don't.<eos> As I thought, I don't have it.
Elliot, are you okay?<eos> What's going on in there?<eos> Now, I gotta warn you.<eos> This thing is dangerous.<eos> Me and my crew are the only ones who know how to deal with it.
Now, I gotta warn you.<eos> This thing is dangerous.<eos> Me and my crew are the only ones who know how to deal with it.<eos> So, when you get in there, just stay calm.<eos> Don't startle it.
She said she was gonna have my baby.<eos> No, man, you can't be up...<eos> Get downstairs.<eos> Use the bathroom downstairs. Get down there.<eos> Okay, I need you to go over to the window and open it.
No, man, you can't be up...<eos> Get downstairs.<eos> Use the bathroom downstairs. Get down there.<eos> Okay, I need you to go over to the window and open it.<eos> Okay, I see it.
Get downstairs.<eos> Use the bathroom downstairs. Get down there.<eos> Okay, I need you to go over to the window and open it.<eos> Okay, I see it.<eos> I see it. I see it.
Does that surprise you?<eos> Perhaps the bigger question is, why are the Atlanta police crashing my party?<eos> Well, we thought that you might have a problem with theft.<eos> Now that you mention it, I did have an embezzlement issue this week.<eos> Don't remember reporting it, though.
We worked till, I think, I fainted. But we managed to stop the water.<eos> We saved the farm.<eos> Your grandma baked me a cake.<eos> Said I was a hero.<eos> Later that day we found out we blocked the water all right. We sent it upstream.
Projectile 2 was Superman.<eos> Sir.<eos> It's moving.<eos> The shockwaves are getting stronger.<eos> Every time we hit it, we make it more powerful.
The shockwaves are getting stronger.<eos> Every time we hit it, we make it more powerful.<eos> We can't attack.<eos> What are you saying, Calvin?<eos> I'm saying it's unkillable.
I won. I won, Jeremy.<eos> Let's go, Jeremy.<eos> Keys. All right, look.<eos> This is my baby.<eos> Is it your baby?
Doctor, I'm so sorry, but this man says he's with the government.<eos> Dr. Franks, I have one job at the moment, which is to get you onto a A400 airbus sitting on a tarmac at Dover ASAP.<eos> Your memory program is going live.<eos> We have an officer down and we need what only he knew.<eos> You're going to retrieve it for us.
Caught me again.<eos> If it's meant to be... It will be.<eos> Let me hear the law.<eos> "This is the law of the jungle... "As old and as true as the sky.<eos> "The wolf that keeps it will prosper... "But the wolf that breaks it will die.
[Excited music]<eos> Our first glass.<eos> Very ugly.<eos> Do you think anyone would buy it?<eos> Do you want to sell it?
For Lisbeth, only the best is enough.<eos> 500 florins.<eos> Bring me the money and we can do business.<eos> You can take back your blue glass.<eos> Beware of who is going to show it.
Bring me the money and we can do business.<eos> You can take back your blue glass.<eos> Beware of who is going to show it.<eos> - Interested?<eos> I'm selling it.
Maybe even two.<eos> Before I put myself in anyone's hands, I wanna know what this thing is and what I'm involved with.<eos> That makes sense, doesn't it?<eos> Yes.<eos> So we agree we're opening it.
Let's go.<eos> - I know another way out.<eos> - E, C, R.<eos> If you have a phone, best leave it here.<eos> They might track it.
- No, no, no.<eos> It is rhetorical.<eos> When are we due to receive the client's video?<eos> It just arrived.<eos> His instructions are to upload it in 24 hours.
It is rhetorical.<eos> When are we due to receive the client's video?<eos> It just arrived.<eos> His instructions are to upload it in 24 hours.<eos> I want to look at it now.
The Faraday pointer with the Map of Hell.<eos> A puzzle.<eos> Specifically designed for his follower to solve.<eos> We brought it to you.<eos> And we were in the process of decoding it when you were kidnapped.
Then the situation is worse than you think.<eos> There's only one reason he would move out of pocket.<eos> He wants Mr. Langdon to himself.<eos> Why?<eos> To find the virus and sell it to the highest bidder, I assume.
Sometimes, it hits the right people.<eos> - That's inhuman.<eos> - Humanity is inhuman.<eos> Life may be cheap.<eos> But a means to end it on a mass scale?
There's a great deal of situational ebb and flow in my line of work.<eos> Look, here we both are now.<eos> I know I behaved terribly.<eos> But a puzzle needed solving.<eos> Who better to solve it than you?
- It's a tourist attraction.<eos> The acoustics are excellent.<eos> Tonight is the summer solstice concert.<eos> Very popular.<eos> People come from all over the world to hear it.
I repeat, containment confirmed.<eos> She thought she was saving the world.<eos> So did they all.<eos> So, what happens now?<eos> We take it back to Geneva for taxonomy and isolation.
And she said, what happened was, that she was at the grocery store.<eos> She left her wallet there, at the grocery store.<eos> It had money in it, a lot of money.<eos> And she thought, "Well, that's that. It's gone."<eos> She thought someone was just gonna pick it up. That's it, that's that.
My other kids are staying with them.<eos> This is where the girls used to sleep, but we don't use it anymore.<eos> Why not?<eos> Well, most of the activity centered in this room.<eos> We were quite afraid that someone might get hurt, which is why we keep it locked.
We'll tell the Church about everything we've seen.<eos> But, the only piece of concrete evidence we've got, is a video of Janet faking an incident.<eos> Yeah, but there have been literally dozens of genuine incidents.<eos> You might want this.<eos> And, just because she faked it this once, doesn't change the fact that--
"Honor thy father and thy mother "that thy days may be long upon the land which the Lord, thy God, giveth thee."<eos> Beautiful, profound.<eos> I believe one should apply this sentiment of gratitude and loyalty to every aspect of our lives.<eos> We are not born into a savage wilderness but into a beautiful mansion of the Lord, that the Lord, and those who have gone before us, have constructed.<eos> We must avoid neglecting this mansion, but rather glorify and preserve it, as we should all of the Lord's creation.
- What's all this about?<eos> What's happening?<eos> I don't understand.<eos> Reginald, dear, Frederica has prepared a charming piece.<eos> Help me persuade her to sing it for us. No.
I come a long way.<eos> I wanna train with Tong Po. I wanna train with Master Po.<eos> Put it back.<eos> And the money.<eos> You know what, keep it.
And the money.<eos> You know what, keep it.<eos> - All of it?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> You need it more than I do.
I'll handle this.<eos> Rick, I know what you're thinking, but you've got to believe me.<eos> He...<eos> He sucked all the oil out of the can!<eos> - He sucked it out.
Well, it was a pretty rough drive in my Jeep.<eos> There's a good dirt road after the strip mine, but after that it's all off-road.<eos> Good job.<eos> What about our POWs?<eos> Well, we're still working on it, but if that third one is alive out there somewhere, we'll find it.
Tonight, I am going to make something fly using actual magic.<eos> - Are you ready?<eos> - Yeah!<eos> I'm going to take a very large vessel,<eos> I'm gonna make it fly over there and land on the Thames.
Remember when we were playing "Find the Lady," and I said that we used a Barry Trap. Some classic switches and a few duplicates?<eos> Well, that's how we switched the driver of the truck. Which took us to a duplicate hangar where we used your need to rush, and your fear of being seen let you do the work for us.<eos> Get those lights off me!<eos> So, the airplane.<eos> How did we get it to fly?
Well... everybody likes you.<eos> You like playing this little game?<eos> Are we playing a game?<eos> Ooh, I think you might be.<eos> Well, if we were playing a game, I don't think I would play it with you.
Sing the song.<eos> Sing...<eos> No, don't stop.<eos> Don't stop.<eos> Sing it again! Sing it again, please!
Please! - Fuck! Son of a bitch!<eos> No!<eos> - Hey, it's gonna be alright..<eos> Brandon, stop hitting the window!<eos> You're not going to get it open!
What happened back there, man?<eos> Who were those guys on the bridge?<eos> I don't know.<eos> - You okay? - No, my leg's stuck, okay.<eos> - I can't move it.
Out back.<eos> With her friends.<eos> Where did you learn that song, Papa?<eos> I learned it from my parents.<eos> And they learned it from their parents.
Where did you learn that song, Papa?<eos> I learned it from my parents.<eos> And they learned it from their parents.<eos> And them from theirs.<eos> And one day... you'll sing it to your children, too.
I'm lost in the woods with a strange man who's been lying to me, and I do not give a shit if it makes you feel uncomfortable.<eos> - All right, calm down.<eos> I'll give you the phone.<eos> - Don't mess with it first.<eos> - I'm unlocking it!
Come on, baby.<eos> Come on. Work.<eos> Hey, Sara, give me the knife.<eos> What?<eos> The knife, let me have it.
What?<eos> The knife, let me have it.<eos> - Why?<eos> - So I can open this thing up.<eos> Or I can smash it on the damn table!
Where are you taking me?<eos> We don't know yet.<eos> - Hey, do you have a phone?<eos> - Why?<eos> Just give it to me.
Places he hangs out.<eos> Any place there's dope is where.<eos> You have a photo?<eos> Yeah.<eos> You can burn it for all I care.
You can't kill me.<eos> And you're definitely gonna have to kill me.<eos> Give me the phone.<eos> Wait.<eos> Toss it over.
Okay, what is your plan then, Reacher?<eos> See, you don't know what to do.<eos> You're like something feral.<eos> You've got their scent in your nose and all you want is blood.<eos> You still don't get it, do you?
Everyone in this city gets a shot at being a star live on my stage!<eos> Buster, this is a terrible idea!<eos> Oh! No, it's not!<eos> Real talent from real life.<eos> That's what audiences want, and I'm gonna give it to them!
Of course I love you.<eos> You think I'd buy you diamond earrings if I didn't...<eos> Where is my money?<eos> Okay, okay, listen, listen.<eos> I just, maybe, kind of, spent it all.
No, no, don't go!<eos> Has anyone seen my glass eye?<eos> On...<eos> It's right here, Miss Crawly.<eos> I've got it.
Four.<eos> Rumlow's on the third floor.<eos> Wanda, just like we practised.<eos> What about the gas?<eos> Get it out.
No one in their right mind would've ever funded it.<eos> Help me out, what's the MIT mission statement?<eos> "To generate, disseminate... "and preserve knowledge.<eos> "And work with others...<eos> "to bring it to bear on the world's great challenges."
It could create life itself.<eos> And Te Fiti shared it with the world.<eos> But in time... some began to seek Te Fiti's heart.<eos> They believed if they could possess it... the great power of creation would be theirs.<eos> And one day... the most daring of them all... voyaged across the vast ocean to take it.
When you use a bird to write with... it's called tweeting.<eos> I know, not every day you get a chance to meet your hero.<eos> You are not my hero. And I'm not here so you can sign my oar!<eos> I'm here 'cause you stole the heart of Te Fiti!<eos> And you will board my boat... and sail across the sea and put it back!
Be who you are on the inside<eos> I need three words To tear her argument apart<eos> Your granny lied<eos> I'd rather be shiny Like a treasure From a sunken pirate wreck<eos> Scrub the deck And make it look shiny
Go to the port town of Varna, on the Black Sea.<eos> That's where you'll find your third kill.<eos> His name is Max Adams, a wealthy American arms dealer.<eos> On the north side of Varna, you'll find a truly vulgar memorial to Bulgarian communism...<eos> Adams spent a fortune restoring it and putting in the most comprehensive security system.
They would walk the streets carrying a small wooden rod, a dowel, which they would roll along the front of a man's trousers.<eos> If a man's pubic hair was long enough to curl around the dowel, they would beat him.<eos> Now, I ask you, do I look like a man to walk the streets carrying a hair-of-the-pubis dowel?<eos> No, sir, you do not.<eos> I returned to this country to save it.
I'm flipping you the bird in here right now.<eos> - Is this your car, Fahim?<eos> - Yes.<eos> This is a fucking piece of shit.<eos> I think it's very nice.
I'll just tell you this.<eos> I've been sober a year.<eos> I miss my father so much, that I can't sleep some nights, but I tell myself that he's watching over me.<eos> Sometimes, there's this shame that almost breaks my back, but... I tell myself,<eos> "When you owe your life to someone... you better live it."
I don't get it, we've paid up every month, and now two months later...<eos> We got a letter and we don't know what the problem is.<eos> Without glasses I can't see a thing.<eos> My dad even less.<eos> Then I'll explain it to you.
It was a real accident.<eos> Yes, and the robbery could be by chance, they might not know about the box.<eos> They may not even know who the hell Soriano is.<eos> We can't take any risks, we have to get them out before they can open it.<eos> Take it or leave it.
We can't take any risks, we have to get them out before they can open it.<eos> Take it or leave it.<eos> This is not what we discussed.<eos> I should've busted your face when you started this shit.<eos> Take it or leave it.
Who contacted you?<eos> Are they paying you to watch me?<eos> You think I don't have a code?<eos> What's wrong with you?<eos> So you already sold it.
So why the hell are you calling?<eos> Am I your girlfriend, asshole?<eos> Call me when you've got something important to say.<eos> The food, I'm calling about the food.<eos> We're bringing it to the door.
Roger that.<eos> We'll watch this section, you can go down.<eos> Where's the Uruguayan?<eos> Inside with Loco.<eos> I took the thing, got it going, but that prick fucked us over.
And how she appears.<eos> Do you want to know who?<eos> Your boss.<eos> I want to see it, show it to me.<eos> Relax, we'll show it to you.
I don't know.<eos> The line is secure, we can talk.<eos> We've said all we have to say.<eos> So did I, but I need to see the video.<eos> Before I decide, I need to see it.
Just automatically feel welcome in that space of talking about these issues. Because at least with feminism, whenever I heard about the issues that feminists were fighting against, I always felt like I had something to draw from in experience to be on board with that.<eos> And that's always been why I've been drawn to the feminist movement, is because a lot of what they spoke about<eos> And with the men's movement, I have very little personal experiences with the issues that they talk about.<eos> A cab driver who is drmng a cab 70 hours a week was not saying, "I am earning this money to have power over my wife."<eos> He was earning this money even though it took power away from his life.
They didn't change those.<eos> Other types of areas, like fathers in prison, there are statutes that specifically give mothers certain benefits that fathers in prison don't have.<eos> And I challenged that as well, legally, but we didn't win on that one.<eos> When I wanted to get a commission on men like the county has a commission on women, the feminists fought that tooth and nail.<eos> When prop 209 was before the California voters, which was to end affirmative action, every feminist organization opposed it.
You didn't know?<eos> I didn't know that.<eos> Were you happy there?<eos> No, I hate it.<eos> The matron who runs it is incompetent, and she has crazy rules and you get punished a lot!
It's so beautiful.<eos> I can't wait.<eos> You are going to look fantastic in it.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Make sure you send me a photo, so I can put it up at the shop.
That's the Safety Angel.<eos> -The most powerful?<eos> -Serious stuff.<eos> 0.2 oz of pepper spray at 110 mph.<eos> I'll take it.
Wow, beautiful!<eos> Check it out.<eos> Josie let me choose.<eos> A convertible.<eos> He's earned it.
Worse than that even.<eos> Vincent's grown up now.<eos> It's just the two of us.<eos> And I'm all alone in that huge house.<eos> I'm going to sell it.
- How much nightshade did you use?<eos> - I thought it best to err on the side...<eos> Varga, what have we said about you thinking?<eos> The poison will dissipate.<eos> I need this blood untainted, and I need it now.
Well, okay, that's quite the gesture.<eos> Yeah, we'll keep it off the floor.<eos> Nice car.<eos> What happened here?<eos> That car was dead when we got it, someone gutted the engine completely,
Well, you just said it, like, whatever, we'll just tie him up.<eos> Well, let's table this for now, we gotta get back... so...<eos> Are you good for the money, 'cause I wanna put the order in?<eos> Jim, it's 10 grand.<eos> Well, are you good for it or not, because I'm all in?
Only the Aussies, mate!<eos> Only the Aussies, mate!<eos> This is going to be interesting. Okay, Saroo...<eos> Why did you choose this course?<eos> What else do you want to get out of it?
- You will never win.<eos> - Do it.<eos> Lyra!<eos> They have a child!<eos> Find it!
Ah, well.<eos> Come on!<eos> Red Leader, this is Gold Leader.<eos> We're starting our attack run on the shield gate.<eos> Keep it tight, and watch out for those towers.
As in, "What is wrong with you?"<eos> You're standing in my driveway making fun of my family?<eos> Oh, we're so weird.<eos> Oh, we smell like burnt oregano and feta cheese.<eos> I got it. I got it.
Just as the last one was my generation's.<eos> Believe me, you do not want to live with that burden.<eos> We're gonna start with an aptitude test.<eos> Each of you is gonna build a covert communications network in your home city.<eos> You're gonna deploy it, back up your site, destroy it and restore it again.
Take our rhythm to new heights<eos> Feel the heat of passion, baby<eos> Light up the night!<eos> We can start a fire!<eos> Come on, let it burn, baby
Can't nobody stop us now<eos> I just know I feel so good tonight<eos> I just know I feel so good tonight<eos> We can start a fire!<eos> Come on, let it burn, baby!
This and live.<eos> Your body has become mine. I'm just a part of you.<eos> I mentally with you.<eos> I sewed a dress. Blue.<eos> But under it need something to wear. After all, it is almost transparent.
We still can't prove it.<eos> When I was staying with Ali she told me she was packing up some stuff to give to Goodwill.<eos> I didn't know it would be in there.<eos> I just had a hunch.<eos> Before we hand it over to A.D. can we please go over this one more time?
And that's what I believe.<eos> What do you believe?<eos> I believe... In the moon, the stars.<eos> It's that feeling that I'm a part of something so much bigger than myself that I will never, ever begin to understand.<eos> And it's something that I cannot control, no matter how hard I try.
Now you're getting the carpet all wet.<eos> Was this your room?<eos> No, it was Mom and Dad's.<eos> Your dad tells me you're rebuilding.<eos> Does it look rebuilt to you?
Now you've been loyal, Ray, damn loyal, but on this matter I am gonna require a level of loyalty that you may find somewhat uncomfortable.<eos> Are you prepared for that?<eos> I hope so.<eos> Now this girl, do you know how she came to be in possession of our product?<eos> I do not think she bought it.
- It could be a trap.<eos> - This whole goddamn business is a trap.<eos> Okay, okay, I'm going to slide the door.<eos> Get ready with the pipe.<eos> Pull it off.
It cannot be true, Holmes. - It cannot.<eos> - No, it can't.<eos> It's called Pepper's Ghost.<eos> A simple reflection in glass of a living, breathing person.<eos> Their only mistake was breaking the glass when they removed it.
This tune... it does not belong to Amri, does it?<eos> Aunt Bima, have you ever seen a one-horned animal?<eos> Deer like? With a long, pointed horn on its forehead?<eos> Why do you ask?<eos> I saw it in my dream.
It's contagious.<eos> Well, I certainly hope so.<eos> Quite right.<eos> And talking of toilet paper, would you please be so kind as to make sure the paper unrolls over the top of the roller, and not from the bottom?<eos> I don't know how many times I have to tell you, but you keep putting it the wrong way.
We can hear your snoring from the other end of the ward.<eos> Where's my gizmo?<eos> Your mobile?<eos> Ah! You dropped it.<eos> Don't worry, it didn't break or anything, but I've put it in the nurses' room to recharge it.
You can have him court-martialed for that.<eos> No, it would only kick up too much dust.<eos> Anyway...<eos> I think he owed me that one.<eos> I was right to do it.
Let's go!<eos> Hey, Raph, do that thing.<eos> Oh, no. I don't want to do it.<eos> It hurts.<eos> Do it, do it, do it...
It would be the end of the world.<eos> But there is something we can do.<eos> The atmosphere around the Technodrome would be toxic to anyone with a standard cardiovascular system.<eos> What are you saying?<eos> We may be the only ones who can survive around that portal, the only ones who can get close enough to this Technodrome to shut it down.
You guys secure the portal device.<eos> I'll deal with those two.<eos> "Secure the portal device"?<eos> What does that even mean?<eos> It means kick the butt of anyone that's guarding it, wait for Donnie's go signal, and shut it down.
Man and wife.<eos> And child.<eos> We start over.<eos> I have been offered a post at Harvard.<eos> I was going to turn it down.
And child.<eos> We start over.<eos> I have been offered a post at Harvard.<eos> I was going to turn it down.<eos> Now I have a mind to take it.
Another of your entitlements now is Andrea's trust fund, which you filed for in Surrogate's Court.<eos> When did you file this claim?<eos> The date?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Well, here it is, so let's have a look.
Besides, you know what you did.<eos> So chin up, finish this trial... and then clear out your fucking desk.<eos> Ladies and gentlemen...<eos> Ladies and gentlemen... when you file a request for a document from the FBI under the Freedom of Information Act, this is what you get.<eos> It's called a redacted document, edited to render unreadable any content the FBI deems a threat to national security, or, more often, to the security of the workings of the FBI itself.
He was that night, and to this day, the only suspect the police considered.<eos> Because...<eos> Because he was and is the only killer of this beautiful, young woman.<eos> This is not a penknife or a grapefruit knife.<eos> This knife is designed to cut through meat, and that's what Mr. Khan used it for, cutting through tendons, muscle, bone, and a heart,
You're having some differences of opinion.<eos> We're deadlocked.<eos> No you're not.<eos> I don't like that word.<eos> I'm not going to let you use it.
You can't do that to people.<eos> Yo, Conner4Real, you suck, dude!<eos> Whoo!<eos> The President calling the popstar a real dumb...<eos> The only reason he put it in appliances is 'cause no one was gonna buy his shit album.
No, no, no.<eos> And because of that, he never really learned to handle adversity in an adult way.<eos> How many people here bought my new album CONNquest?<eos> All y'all are liars!<eos> I know you didn't buy it!
Fuck, yeah<eos> If anyone tries to take my crack<eos> I'll kill them on principle<eos> Some call crack bazooka<eos> Others call it base
Come with me.<eos> Come with me through the stones.<eos> Na, I can't.<eos> You could try.<eos> You hear it, right? The buzzing?
It had an unregistered flight path for a ship called the Anubis, Anubis.<eos> The Anubis left Phoebe Research Station, and it was headed for Eros, okay?<eos> Now, I'm thinking,<eos> "Hmm, maybe something's being transported on this ship."<eos> I'm thinking, "Julie's ship was sent out to intercept it."
Yes.<eos> It was so hard not to say anything.<eos> You're dead to me. You're dead to me.<eos> Get used to seeing this face, sir.<eos> Because you are going to be seeing it all the time!
tell me, what are you looking for?<eos> tell me, what are you looking for?<eos> -tell me.<eos> -My little horse.<eos> But I can't find it.
Isabel... What you need is to talk to the priest.<eos> Just a simple blessing, Olga.<eos> I feel peace when I hear you pray.<eos> Father almighty Lord I bless you for allowing a baby to form in the womb of your daughter.<eos> help Isabel to guard this new life so no one can hurt it in any way.
I talked to him last week and explained the situation to him.<eos> Georgie junior's going to BU in the fall, and Jimmy graduates next year.<eos> We can rent this house out until you turn 18.<eos> Then you come back and stay if you want.<eos> When you turn 21, you're allowed to sell it or keep it or whatever you want to do.
Can you help her?<eos> She is a child herself.<eos> Come on!<eos> The child is wrong.<eos> I have to turn it.
I need a piece of silver.<eos> I need a piece of silver.<eos> Hildebrand, you have a piece of silver.<eos> Yes.<eos> - She needs it for the boy.
She will examine you.<eos> Was he left behind?<eos> - Mhm.<eos> I need salt.<eos> Throw it to the ground!
He is an unfreier, his father was a farmer.<eos> Would you like to deny Christian honor?<eos> Has he ever denied you or your companion the escort?<eos> Is one here in the hall, only one, The bad thing about knight Christian?<eos> He should say it now.
There will be enough people to win the ore.<eos> Truly, Randolf is right.<eos> We will not be able to get the silver out of the ground sooner.<eos> Then rascals will cross my village.<eos> They will not have anything to eat and they will take it by force.
But he's got giant's blood.<eos> And you've got training.<eos> Sounds like a fair match to me.<eos> Benjen always lifts his chin when he's about to charge.<eos> And lowers it when he's going to dodge, my lady.
Hey, let them go, let them go!<eos> Look, man, we're just trying to get off this island.<eos> Therein lies the rub.<eos> Danny.<eos> You guys don't get it.
Right where you're sitting.<eos> Johannes probably isn't his real name.<eos> You haven't got a picture of him?<eos> - How does he want the money delivered'?<eos> I'm to put it in a bag and get on a train for Hamburg tonight at 7:15.
- It's your cab?<eos> It's ours, the three of us all together.<eos> Then you should all get lawyers.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> The cab was used in the commission of a crime, which means the state can sue in order to keep it in a civil court.
In sum, according to qualitative analyses, Cartet remains the first choice of teachers.<eos> But sales figures give our competitors a big lead.<eos> Our aim is to strengthen its quality as a reference book, while striving to meet market expectations.<eos> Look through it at home.<eos> In short, our aim is to upgrade the textbook, to humanize it.
I thought you'd love me forever.<eos> I'm a goddamn idiot!<eos> I'll always love you. You know it.<eos> Come on.<eos> Lunch is ready. Just warm it up.
You crazy.<eos> Hey, sit back.<eos> Nice.<eos> Fucking coke is pouring out of your bag.<eos> Maybe we should have put it in your pussy.
- No, he definitely didn't.<eos> He owes me $7,000.<eos> Where the fuck's my money?<eos> I don't... I don't know.<eos> I know that you'll get it, though.
You stuck to your guns.<eos> That's good.<eos> That's rare.<eos> Maybe you'll get lucky, and the judge will screw up with you, too.<eos> Well, I didn't take the plea 'cause I didn't do it.
Well, I didn't take the plea 'cause I didn't do it.<eos> Yeah.<eos> That's what he said, too, my niece's killer.<eos> You didn't do it.<eos> He didn't do it.
- Yeah.<eos> (KEVIN GATES SONG "I DON'T GET TIRED" PLAYING)<eos> Wow!<eos> God gave you one face.<eos> Why would you change it?
No, it is not in my experience.<eos> - It's not how people talk.<eos> - Please, please, you're wrong.<eos> You understand?<eos> People understand the historical significance of that word, and that you can't just say it shiftlessly with no responsibility whatsoever.
Deal.<eos> Deal.<eos> Y'all hear that?<eos> They gonna shadow you.<eos> So you make sure you listen to every word they say and you take it as gospel, you understand?
Well, that was fun.<eos> He gets his jollies pushing around alphas because he can.<eos> We had this commander back in Ranger school, he was a real cockbag.<eos> So on our last night, me and a buddy, we stole his beret.<eos> The whole barracks chubbed it.
Mercenaries all know the jambo, Amahl.<eos> These guys are all right.<eos> Base, we're looking at a lot of Russian SA-7s.<eos> Tell him to maintain eyes on the truck as long as he can.<eos> We're gonna find his stash and we're gonna level it with a Hellfire.
You know this money belongs to Cottonmouth.<eos> Allegedly.<eos> Allegedly.<eos> Thing I can't figure out... why would somebody... go through all this hell outside, cause all this mayhem, and then leave the money behind?<eos> To take it off the streets.
Oh, can you forget the swear jar for a minute?<eos> What the...<eos> Where'd all this money come from?<eos> Bank's not worried about it... neither should you.<eos> Use it for this.
Couldn't leave this place lookin' so bad.<eos> That was the thing about Pops.<eos> He had a lot of pride in detail.<eos> Like that gold leaf window with the Pop's Barber Shop logo?<eos> I polished it every day.
So what else will break down abalone shell?<eos> Salt water!<eos> - Yeah. Yeah. Saline!<eos> - Salt water.<eos> Where do you have it?
What were you even doing at the club that night?<eos> I was going there to kill him.<eos> You beat me to it.<eos> Cornell never needed my political money.<eos> And he was never going to pay it back.
It's the pinnacle of black art... politics... innovation.<eos> It's supposed to be a shining light to the world.<eos> It's our responsibility to push forward, so that the next generation will be further along than us.<eos> Pop said his mantra aloud twice a day.<eos> The kids in the shop were pissed... but they could never unhear it.
It's more than fair.<eos> Two or three months, I said, not one or two.<eos> And where's the money coming from?<eos> I'm sure his parents don't have it.<eos> They'll have to get it.
It's an anesthetic vets use on horses when they do surgery.<eos> Why would anybody take that?<eos> Why would Michael Jackson take propofol?<eos> ... Same reason.<eos> He took it to sleep, didn't he?
Be a lot easier to do it right away.<eos> You didn't come here for revenge.<eos> You came here because you know it's time to come in.<eos> Your father created the program.<eos> Didn't have what it takes to make it work.
Never forget that.<eos> My ancient Druid's a little rusty.<eos> Maybe you can fill me in.<eos> "When the Ellcrys comes to the end of its days, "a flower will bloom "that will bear a single seed.<eos> "A member of the Chosen "must carry that seed to Safehold "and immerse it in the Bloodfire.
No car, motorbike or scooter?<eos> - No.<eos> - Are you sure?<eos> Your back was turned.<eos> Yes, if a car had pulled up, I would have heard it.
- No.<eos> - Are you sure?<eos> Your back was turned.<eos> Yes, if a car had pulled up, I would have heard it.<eos> - And Thomas would have seen it.
And your mom was worried about us.<eos> If you have a six, then you can ask me if I have a six.<eos> - I see. - Then you take it and make a pair.<eos> If I've already got a pair, what do I do?<eos> You put it in that pile.
- You know?<eos> I'm sorry my generation screwed it up so bad.<eos> It's all right.<eos> No, not really.<eos> You know, our parents built a great country... and we couldn't even maintain it for you.
Yeah, man, 'cause that's the story of my life... is I always, I always try my best, you know?<eos> And that's where I get in trouble.<eos> This one time... You'll like this.<eos> There was this lady... her grandmother made these German apple pancakes.<eos> She wanted this recipe, she couldn't find it... so I go, there's a website, it's called "Stormfront"... and it's like a neo-Nazi site.
Get off of him.<eos> He's got heart trouble.<eos> - No, no, no, no. - Get off.<eos> Just give me my money.<eos> We don't have it anymore.
Okay, buddy, what's going on?<eos> Now we can get your tools back.<eos> Where did you get this?<eos> Mom.<eos> - No, we're taking it back.
Fucking hell, Nandi.<eos> Come on, Diana.<eos> Why did you do it, man?<eos> Because that car is all I have in the world, López.<eos> And I know you'll never give it back.
You're my brother, Jose.<eos> Take care of him, like you always have.<eos> Make him keep his promises.<eos> Burn that money, Jose!<eos> Burn it!
Oh, Teddy.<eos> You're a low-down son of a bitch.<eos> I know.<eos> I know we both believe the same thing.<eos> No matter how dirty the business, do it well.
I wanted to feed it and I wanted to keep it healthy again.<eos> But that would have been impossible.<eos> I would have drawn the suffering of the poor animal unnecessarily.<eos> And then?<eos> Then my father has redeemed it.
Seriously, you must go to bed.<eos> I want to stay here.<eos> But you're tired.<eos> Here is a room, a sick room.<eos> But you can have it for yourself tonight. Come over!
And that's a lot of dough. Mm-hmm.<eos> And until the state and federal drug laws catch up to each other, little places like this are always gonna have a lot of cash lying around.<eos> - It's a gold rush.<eos> - It's a green rush.<eos> And with that much green, there's always gonna be someone who wants to steal it.
Let's get you up.<eos> Let get you up.<eos> Okay, now...<eos> If it's money you want, I can get you money.<eos> Come on. If I wanted your money, I'd already have it, right?
Yeah, okey-doke.<eos> We work in silence.<eos> That's not silence.<eos> We've been digging into Joe Harris' cell phone.<eos> Maybe he doesn't carry it all the time, but if he has been, it doesn't seem like he's gone any further out of Boston than the prison over the last two weeks.
T... U... N...<eos> N... I'll have dispatch put roadblocks up in front of the tunnels.<eos> I'll try to catch ward.<eos> They found his car in an indoor parking lot about 3 miles from the Asylum.<eos> Yeah, he must've parked it and walked back so we wouldn't see it here.
It's kind of strange that no one's reported Daniella missing.<eos> - It's been almost a week. - Mm-hmm.<eos> I tracked down the guy that owns that building.<eos> He lives in New York, says he's trying to get the property rezoned so he can build condos.<eos> Did he rent it out to the Fear Club? No.
- Here, I'll make you a deal.<eos> I'll give all the money I raised to the boys and girls club,<eos> - and you don't tell my mom.<eos> - I'll make you a deal.<eos> You give me all the money you made, I'll give it to the boys and girls club, and I may not tell your mom.
You bought a wedding dress? Mom, we have a...<eos> What?<eos> No, I mean, this is what I wore to marry your father.<eos> I just...<eos> I wanted Emily to have it.
I wanted Emily to have it.<eos> Only if you like it.<eos> It's pretty.<eos> Yes, it's gorgeous, it's beautiful.<eos> I love it.
I need your word.<eos> If I persuade him to abandon the castle, you'll grant a safe passage north.<eos> You have my word.<eos> You have until nightfall.<eos> You gave it to me for a purpose.
What?<eos> Afraid you'll like it?<eos> You and Cephalo deserve each other.<eos> That mark, what does it mean?<eos> I don't know, I've always had it.
Said it reminded her of where she came from.<eos> Have you ever seen the ocean?<eos> It's like the biggest bath you ever saw.<eos> Blue and sparkly.<eos> I can stare at it for hours, wondering what's on the other side.
Good girl.<eos> Come on, kid.<eos> That's it.<eos> For the forebrain.<eos> I stick it through the nostril and tap it in ever so gently with this.
Your body is the vessel. Your blood is the key.<eos> Don't let them leave without you.<eos> Proposition... your help in exchange for your freedom.<eos> That mark, what does it mean?<eos> I don't know, I've always had it.
The Ellcrys is dying.<eos> As it sheds its leaves, a demon army forms, preparing to unleash its evil on our world.<eos> We're out of time, Amberle.<eos> The last leaf has fallen in Arborlon.<eos> I can't believe it's really you.
Come, Kubo.<eos> Come to your aunties.<eos> No reason to be afraid, Kubo.<eos> We just need your other eye.<eos> Your grandfather admires it so.
Kubo, we both want the exact same thing.<eos> You want to take my other eye.<eos> That's what you want!<eos> Well, yes.<eos> But do you know why I want it?
-(MUSIC STOPS) - Hey, Clark.<eos> Higher.<eos> - What?<eos> - The platform's too low.<eos> Can't we see what it looks like before we start building?
If you can't find anything, call me at home.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Well... I'll be going.<eos> Are you taking Xoan's sweatshirt?<eos> He gave it to me ages ago.
Put the towel around her.<eos> Pass me that big towel.<eos> - This one?<eos> - Yes, that's it.<eos> Put it over her back.
I abstained from you for years, but I made the mistake of relapsing into the hope of finding you or hearing about you.<eos> That absurd hope shattered the fragile base on which I'd built my new life.<eos> I have nothing left.<eos> Only you exist.<eos> Your absence fills my entire life and destroys it.
- Bellamy, where are you?<eos> I had him.<eos> What the hell were you thinking?<eos> We got the beacon, didn't we? Uh!<eos> Yeah, but where did they get it?
Which means your suspect wasn't using liquid nitrogen.<eos> He was using supercooled liquid helium.<eos> It's one of the most effective substances in the world for rapid temperature reduction.<eos> This liquid helium, where do you get it?<eos> - Why do you need it?
It's the branch of physics dealing with the production and effects of extremely low temperatures.<eos> My understanding is that there were some promising experiments being carried out in the program, but, alas, it was shut down.<eos> When was that?<eos> Two or three years ago.<eos> Thomas Wayne killed it, along with a few other odd programs.
- I have the bottle.<eos> That's not the same thing, is it?<eos> Please, I just need it refilled.<eos> The original prescription doesn't have a refill order.<eos> If it doesn't have a refill order, I can't refill it.
This medication is for my wife.<eos> She's sick.<eos> She's in pain.<eos> Everyone that comes in here is sick or in pain.<eos> Have your doctor write a new prescription. Then I can refill it.
I guess that's the other Bruce.<eos> Sorry, I don't mean to be flippant with you.<eos> This conversation has been very useful.<eos> Clarifying.<eos> Perhaps we can do it again sometime.
They're for my condition.<eos> Your heart?<eos> I have a hole in it.<eos> It keeps getting bigger apparently.<eos> I think my demons are feeding on it.
I brought him back to life.<eos> And what has this gutter rodent done?<eos> Played stupid board games and whined about his wretched mother.<eos> That vermin has to go.<eos> But he likes it here.
But your health?<eos> To hell with that.<eos> I want you to have it all, my son.<eos> This house and all that's in it.<eos> Keep it just the way it is, a piece of history, our history.
You can call me Jim. Jim.<eos> Heard you were able to save the day.<eos> I got lucky.<eos> I don't believe in luck.<eos> You saw a problem and you solved it. Bravo.
Bruce Wayne?<eos> You're Bruce Wayne?<eos> That's far enough.<eos> Drop the knife.<eos> Whatever it was you used to do this to me, just drop it.
In ten minutes, everything within a quarter mile radius will be dust.<eos> - That's madness.<eos> - If you want to live... which I do, frankly... we had better leave.<eos> We detected a radioactive material down there.<eos> - You got it out first, right?
- There wasn't enough time.<eos> They forced my hand, but I calculated the chances of a radioactive cloud is fairly low.<eos> If you're wrong, thousands of people could die.<eos> Yes, yes, yes, but paying that price will be better than releasing what's down there.<eos> - How do we shut it down?
MAURY". You know I'm good for it.<eos> You know my money's good as gold.<eos> GALASSO: Oh, come on, Maury.<eos> I don't know what it is with you people.<eos> You got a reputation for knowing what to do with money except for when you're supposed to have it.
The one whose short I did that went to Sundance?<eos> Well, he sent me this feature script he's been working on, and he really wanted me to show it to this producer on that movie I shot last June.<eos> I guess he like really wants to work with this one producer, and like, wanted me to show it to him.<eos> Oh, I left my shampoo in my bag.<eos> Do you mind grabbing it for me?
Be strong for daddy.<eos> We're almost together again.<eos> You are so close now.<eos> What's that picture?<eos> It's called an icon.
- Thank you.<eos> Three flights up. Lift's broken but it keeps you fit.<eos> _<eos> Yeah, chicken sounds great, love.<eos> A couple of days out of date is fine, as long as you cook it well.
I am sending a helicopter to pick them up.<eos> You know of him?<eos> He used to come every year, but that was long before your time.<eos> And this parcel came for them.<eos> Please give it to them when they arrive.
Of course, sir.<eos> Absolutely, right away.<eos> Find out what happened to the bloody parcel, will you?<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> I'll have it sent up as soon as it arrives.
Wait. What are you talking about?<eos> What is this?<eos> There was a leak.<eos> The leak was at your end, not mine.<eos> I killed a man to patch it.
Yeah?<eos> Yeah, hi, I'm in reception.<eos> I have an international package for Mr Richard Roper.<eos> I need a signature for that.<eos> I'm sorry, sir, I can't drop it in the lobby.
Take all the things you own, clothes, house, car, and ask yourself what part of all that did not depend on commerce and the free of movement of capital.<eos> For the benefit of the hard of thinking in the room, I'll give you the answer. The answer is none.<eos> None!<eos> My Safe Haven project for refugees is not funded out of love, or a bleeding heart.<eos> I do it because it benefits me to have the communities in which I wish to operate sympathetic to my interests.
I was gonna ask someone what it meant.<eos> Who were you gonna ask?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I didn't do anything, I promise.<eos> I just deleted it.
Who were you gonna ask?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I didn't do anything, I promise.<eos> I just deleted it.<eos> How much later did you delete it?
I didn't do anything, I promise.<eos> I just deleted it.<eos> How much later did you delete it?<eos> A week?<eos> - You didn't show it to anyone?
"Blessed is he who bestows pain."<eos> Try this piece of poetry.<eos> It'll blow your mind.<eos> What the hell is this doin' here?<eos> You have to bury it deep, deep below the place where your journey began.
Help!<eos> Do something!<eos> Of course I know what I'm doing.<eos> I wrote this book.<eos> You wrote it?
Can't see in this fucking thing.<eos> That sheet has so many bedbugs.<eos> I feel them!<eos> I can feel them!<eos> Get it off!
Maranda.<eos> Doesn't your brother sell weed on some farm outside of town?<eos> Yeah, I did say that.<eos> My brother, Daffodil.<eos> Why don't we spend all of our bucket money on Daffodil's weed and sell it at the tailgate this weekend?
Go to the hospital!<eos> I love you.<eos> I love you!<eos> Are we gonna lose our house?<eos> I mean we have no money, so we're definitely losing it.
Technically yes.<eos> But here, you are thrown back into biochemistry.<eos> Sometimes you do step back in your life.<eos> You don't seem pleased by this.<eos> - Well... - Your life... as I have observed it, seems to be a happy one for you.
Shit!<eos> Come on.<eos> Come on.<eos> I'm here to deliver the package.<eos> Do I give it to you?
Do you know what's going on here?<eos> What are they trying to do to me?<eos> What the fuck is going on here?<eos> They said to deliver a package.<eos> I've got to bring it here, deliver a package to you.
He took my phone. - Have you been robbed?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I've been robbed.<eos> I had it when I went in the room.<eos> Now it's gone. Where is it?
Thank you.<eos> I got donuts too.<eos> But I'm afraid they didn't survive the drive over.<eos> Is he awake?<eos> I brought him some food this morning, but I don't know if he ate it.
If someone's gonna put this much fuckin' money up to have you killed, then you're already dead.<eos> Shit is done!<eos> If it ain't us takin' the money, it's gonna be somebody else!<eos> Don't you get it, man?<eos> Hey, don't you fuckin' get it, man?
You are too precious for words.<eos> No. No, he pissed somebody off.<eos> Unfortunately for Cliff, it was the wrong somebody.<eos> I laid out his pattern in the file there.<eos> You just make sure it follows and Bingo was his name-o, you kill him graveyard dead.
- Give it back.<eos> - I got it.<eos> - It is okay.<eos> - The cell phone was not for you, Hilda.<eos> - Take it.
I will not leave you.<eos> Hilda's not even your own.<eos> I do not want your shitty phone!<eos> It is slow and ugly, just like you.<eos> You can take it and your sister and get out of here, because no one wants you here.
Private videos of an artistic nature.<eos> That's what was in the hiding place. That's what it's for.<eos> So, this art patron stole the videos and the baseball cards?<eos> Well, there was a misunderstanding.<eos> I mean, uh, ‭call it creative differences.
How the hell should I know? You're the nerd.<eos> Just make it cheap.<eos> Now go on, get outta here.<eos> I see you got your old car back. Yep.<eos> The kidney people wouldn't take it.
I don't think so. Well, earlier, ‭you said that he was here.<eos> Now you're saying that he wasn't here.<eos> - Which is it?<eos> Yeah, well, when that guy showed me the picture,<eos> I thought, "Maybe," but now that I'm seeing it again, uh...
He must get these letters back to the tavern before they're missed.<eos> Is that King James' signature at the bottom?<eos> I recognize his hand, by now.<eos> Everything else is in code.<eos> The seal had been removed at least three times before I took it off myself.
Oh, I shouldn't tell you this, but his name's Randall.<eos> Randall?<eos> What?<eos> Well, how did you meet him?<eos> I dropped my handkerchief, and he picked it up.
The tenants' rents would probably make no difference to a place like this.<eos> What I do with that damnable place would be no concern of yers.<eos> I'm yer grandsire and head of your clan, after all.<eos> I demand my due.<eos> If I wouldna give my pledge to Colum, who I know to be kin, then what sort of fool would I be to give it to an old twister that may or may not share my blood?
I'm not sure where home is, to be honest.<eos> Anywhere but here, that's for sure.<eos> Ma'am, can I ask you a question?<eos> What kind of food is this trying to be?<eos> Well, that, Private Lucas, is trying to be black pudding, though you would probably call it sausage.
His friends will find him there tomorrow.<eos> If what he told us is not true... Then cut his throat.<eos> Gladly.<eos> I give you your life.<eos> I hope you use it well.
Railroad ties. Uh, things that fit in.<eos> We thought before we cut new stone we would look and see if we could find some that was...<eos> - My brother and I.. He's dead now. When we bought this property in '66 that stone, was there.<eos> We built this house that year.<eos> Had it built.
- I don't need to hear the details!<eos> - Then why are you punching me on this?<eos> - You want to save a pup from drowning. I appreciate the instinct.<eos> I admire it.<eos> Maybe we even use the kid someday, but never risk a hole in my boat unless you're positive you can plug it.
I gave him his first hand job.<eos> We were from the Valley.<eos> Anyway, he went on to become this giant drug dealer.<eos> His stuff was the shit.<eos> I used to sell it for him.
I liked staying here because it made me feel safe.<eos> But I see now that it's just because I was so comfortable living in heartbreak.<eos> I don't want to be here anymore.<eos> It's harder to kill you when I'm sitting in the same room as you.<eos> Easier to carve your heart out of your chest and eat it when you're just a monster in my mind.
The one thing it does not yet possess is time.<eos> Age. August 23, 2026.<eos> That will make it 100 years that this hotel has stood.<eos> And on that day, it will earn its rightful distinction as an historical landmark.<eos> They won't be able to tear it down even if they wanted to.
They alerted the FBI, even the Mexican police, but the nurses had disappeared.<eos> The only thing they left behind was a word, unfinished, on the wall.<eos> "Murder."<eos> The house was put up for sale.<eos> They tried to make it presentable.
What was that?<eos> We wanted out.<eos> We wanted our money back.<eos> We wanted our lives back.<eos> The bank sold it to us, and the bank was just gonna have to take it back.
What are you doing?<eos> Just chilling.<eos> Barb, is that my shirt?<eos> I don't know, is it?<eos> Want me to take it off?
So then, I was the wife at the gala.<eos> But then he cheated on me.<eos> I guess none of it's great.<eos> Kimmy, while I'm at the salon, I need you to go pick up my dress from Bergdorf's.<eos> I will treat it like it's my own fanciest dress, which I got free when I signed up for a bank account.
I don't mind guns.<eos> I mind what they used for.<eos> Look, Trudy's your cross to bear.<eos> We don't know this Howard from nothing. Oh, he's a hippie idealist.<eos> He's gonna take that money from the big bad capitalist bank and give it to a good cause.
It messes you up. I tried it a few times when I was with him. Did you?<eos> We even tried reefers and I tried opium.<eos> Look at you!<eos> What was the... I can't hear. What was the effect?<eos> Oh! No, I didn't like it.
But as Bobby's brother-in-law said:<eos> Life has it's own agenda.<eos> Yes, what do you want? Ah! What!<eos> Could you just turn the radio down, just a little?<eos> I'm not asking you to turn it off, but my wife gets these migraines.
You can tell him... that I am no longer involved in that line of work.<eos> He's not with Markridge.<eos> I know who he's with.<eos> I was a poison in that place.<eos> Reshaping life so you can destroy it?
And what happened?<eos> How'd you screw up a simple handoff?<eos> Wha... He didn't bring the money.<eos> Senator Stay Puft, rebuttal?<eos> I didn't bring it, because... because I don't have it.
And plus, Jerkleton, I've got this.<eos> Spanish Fly. - Right?<eos> - Pam, that shit doesn't work.<eos> Yes, it does.<eos> We just need to mix it with some mole's blood.
- This. - Yes.<eos> Same plate registration, medallion, and VIN.<eos> Have you checked the plates and registration to see who owns this cab?<eos> Yes. Yousef Bashir, Tariq Mazari, and Salim Khan.<eos> Which of them was driving it the night it came into Manhattan?
Quiet, please.<eos> Is that everyone?<eos> Let's make a start.<eos> The periodic table.<eos> Close your eyes and visualise it. And open.
"One day, she was walking in a forest "when suddenly, she was attacked by a monster.<eos> "It was a friggin' abortion and it wanted to eat her.<eos> "The woman was really brave.<eos> "She fought and fought, but the monster was big and fierce.<eos> "She couldn't kill it.
"She couldn't kill it.<eos> She broke her sword and her spear.<eos> "The monster was about to eat her. "But then a girl came running up. "She was like Achilles because she couldn't be hurt,<eos> "except in one place she kept secret.<eos> "She fought the monster and killed it "and cut off its head and went galumphing back.
You made the spray paint come out of my nose.<eos> What, do I have paint on my face?<eos> Dude, look at the moon!<eos> What?<eos> When you see a moon like that, do you ever think... life is so amazing and maybe we shouldn't waste it by just getting high all the time?
The alien DNA must code for something that targets the Cas9 protein.<eos> It must somehow deactivate the weapon.<eos> But we should have seen it in the gel.<eos> Why didn't we see it?<eos> They must have known that someone would... Would try to find it.
Since we didn't hear from LAPD until Tuesday, there was no question of preserving the scene.<eos> The room was rented last Saturday, right after Mr. Allen checked out, and of course cleaned every day.<eos> I'm still gonna need to see the room.<eos> Well, the current occupant checks out tomorrow.<eos> Occupant? When the LAPD called, they specifically asked that the room be left empty until we had a chance to check it out.
- Mexican.<eos> Poquito Mas. Best Mexican take out in L.A.<eos> And I got you a new phone.<eos> Thanks, Dad.<eos> Why don't you go set it up. Your mom and I'll put food on the table.
You're not a part of it yet.<eos> I'm not?<eos> There's one more thing you gotta do first.<eos> We have a little... initiation ritual.<eos> We like to call it the Iron Rodeo.
Keeping an open mind, sir.<eos> This is a burner, after all, and there's only one message on it.<eos> He was dirty. Of course he had a burner.<eos> His personal cell phone is missing.<eos> He got rid of it.
He was dirty. Of course he had a burner.<eos> His personal cell phone is missing.<eos> He got rid of it.<eos> Any number of reasons.<eos> Or somebody took it.
He told me he was a producer of adult entertainment.<eos> Please.<eos> Let's cut the crap, Mr. Morada.<eos> You knew the real source of my husband's income.<eos> You helped him wash it.
Have a good day.<eos> Veronica Allen and Weiss?<eos> Think she's cutting him in on the money?<eos> She may have no choice.<eos> She's got to find it first.
I like your bracelet. It's very beautiful.<eos> Can I see it?<eos> Give me your hand.<eos> Cool! Where did you have it?<eos> Mom brought it to me from Vienna.
Look, bro, I haven't talked to my mom in a year.<eos> I don't know where she's living, or if she's living.<eos> A few months ago my dad got in touch with me... started sending me money.<eos> Sending you money where?<eos> Well, I didn't have my own address, so he sent it to his place.
Almost 3 months ago.<eos> He was volunteering at farms through a few different programs.<eos> At least I knew he was getting food and a safe place to sleep.<eos> Have you sent him any money?<eos> He wouldn't accept it, if we did.
Hey, did you get the photo?<eos> Uh, yeah.<eos> Looks like a symbol of some kind.<eos> It's not on a flat surface, so I can't tell, for sure.<eos> Will you fill it out and run it against the popular symbols in this area?
-Yeah, he must have crashed.<eos> You think he got hurt in the fall?<eos> Not so hurt he couldn't walk away.<eos> Bike like this is like a Cadillac to these kids.<eos> He would've walked it home.
Yeah, well, while you're talking to the lights, the rest of us are having a funeral for Will!<eos> I'm not letting him sit in that freezer another day!<eos> All right, show's over.<eos> What?<eos> We keep losing the signal, but you heard it, right?
Uh, they found Barbara's car.<eos> - What?<eos> Barbara Holland's car.<eos> Seems she ran away after all.<eos> Staties found it late last night at a bus station.
- just leave her alone!<eos> - Admit it. - No.<eos> - Admit it!<eos> - Fresh blood.<eos> I knew it.
It was where they must do experiments or something, and then there was...<eos> There was this kid's room.<eos> -How do you know it was a kid's room?<eos> -More like a prison.<eos> So why would you think it was a kid's room, then?
Me, too.<eos> --Guys!<eos> It's Lucas, I think he's in trouble.<eos> Do you remember how he said he was looking for the gate?<eos> - Yeah. - What if he found it?
Okay, so the gate has a really strong electromagnetic field, and that can change the directions of a compass needle.<eos> Is this gate underground? Yes.<eos> Near a large water tank?<eos> How do you know all that?<eos> He's seen it.
Your mom and Hopper are just walking in there like bait.<eos> That thing is still in there.<eos> And we can't just sit here and let it get them, too.<eos> We can't.<eos> You still wanna try it out?
And we can't just sit here and let it get them, too.<eos> We can't.<eos> You still wanna try it out?<eos> I wanna finish what we started.<eos> I want to kill it.
The money your mother gave you for singing lessons.<eos> I thought that sounded pretty good.<eos> This is the band Richie wants to see? Uh-huh.<eos> He liked their demo.<eos> Did he hear it before or after he started using again? - Very funny.
I never judged.<eos> Of course not.<eos> So I got my act together.<eos> And I'm comfortable in this life.<eos> But certain things you learn in Inwood, they never leave you... you know, like the idea that if someone has a problem with you and they come to you in person, you do what you can to take care of it.
- Not you.<eos> The U.S. Attorney.<eos> His father's house is around the jetty.<eos> Yes, I know the house.<eos> What? I just heard Bobby Axelrod is trying to buy it.
But today she tried to quit.<eos> Still trust her?<eos> I want to.<eos> I didn't know this place was open for lunch.<eos> It's not.
Hey, babe.<eos> Hey, babe.<eos> What the hell's wrong with Elmo?<eos> He went to the vet to get fixed, remember?<eos> The house, I want it.
They were role-playing.<eos> And the fact that his voice is distorted?<eos> It was obviously put out to humiliate and shame Christine.<eos> She broke up with him a month prior.<eos> So are we saying he released it?
Is that a problem?<eos> So you knew you were being recorded? Yes.<eos> Again, it was a private moment with a person that I cared about.<eos> The tape was for us, not for the public.<eos> Why did your ex release it? I don't know who released it.
Please stop saying that.<eos> Take off your shirt.<eos> I wanna keep it on.<eos> I wanna feel your skin.<eos> I wanna keep it on.

- But a system costs 600.<eos> What's up?<eos> - Close your eyes.<eos> Open them.<eos> I didn't wrap it, but it's yours.
The thing about the punch is, um, I took my last tab of lysergic acid diethylamide this morning, so...<eos> Dizz, not the acid punch.<eos> The one you spike with Bacardi 151. Oh, okay.<eos> The special punch. First thing tomorrow morning, I wanna march into punk ass Larry's, put the money on the counter,<eos> - make him count it.
Pretending to scratch and spin, charging at the door.<eos> Fools was falling for it, too.<eos> It was straight up blasphemy, son. Word up.<eos> -You think Shao made this tape? -No.<eos> They got it from a store.
Boom-boom.<eos> Boom-boom.<eos> Boom-boom.<eos> You hear it?<eos> You hear it?
Boom-boom.<eos> Boom-boom.<eos> You hear it?<eos> You hear it?<eos> -I hear it.
"Where there's ruin, there's hope for a treasure."<eos> Now, the other day I was up on 183rd, and this rich lady called it "taki," man.<eos> But I talked to my man Tracy from 168th.<eos> And he said, "Listen for the voice of the ghetto."<eos> 'Cause it crashes down on you when you least expect it.
That's the way it goes sometimes.<eos> Good-bye, Diane.<eos> Fuck 'em all!<eos> I don't need anyone!<eos> Just make the offer, Don, before somebody else snaps it up.
TULIP: (SINGING) Baby, what are we gonna call you, baby?<eos> (CHUCKLES) This is crazy.<eos> We are delivering a baby!<eos> No, we are delivering a package.<eos> Maybe we should name it instead of calling it "the package."
What?<eos> What's happening?<eos> - Louder. We're in the back!<eos> - We're keeping it!<eos> - Back of the pack, we're keeping it!
It was not for no reason.<eos> It was for personal reasons.<eos> Anyways, there's a port right there on the coast.<eos> We'll just leave first thing in the morning and deliver the package.<eos> Just call it "the baby."
But that wasn't enough for Arnold.<eos> He wasn't interested in the appearance of intellect or wit.<eos> He wanted the real thing.<eos> He wanted to create consciousness.<eos> He imagined it as a pyramid.
Il est bon étudiant.<eos> It's not nice to say that.<eos> Ce n'est pas bien de dire ça.<eos> I'll have the baby greens and the lamb, please.<eos> We recommend it pink.
- Why?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> - That's not good enough, Robert.<eos> Tell me what happened.<eos> It caught the rabbit and it killed it.
Oh, you guys made it in.<eos> Sorry, I had to pee so bad.<eos> - Oh, we managed. Yeah. - Yeah.<eos> So, I left my wallet at this place, Bliss House.<eos> I went there last night and I think I dropped it in the collection basket.
Do it again.<eos> Pretty Woman?<eos> Pretty Woman is such a lie.<eos> Like, a prostitute wouldn't fall in love with you.<eos> She would just, like, steal your shit and sell it for coke.
Thank you.<eos> $1,000!<eos> $1,000!<eos> An example of real history.<eos> I hope you find it edifying.
I won't allow that to happen.<eos> What are you gonna allow?<eos> He keeps a diary.<eos> He has done for years.<eos> He told us he had nothing to hide, but we still had to subpoena him to get hold of it.
Diana.<eos> So far, I've raised, um, most of my funds back home.<eos> Was that easy? It wasn't difficult.<eos> Not as difficult as in London, is that what you're saying?<eos> There's a principle and I've stuck to it.
Yeah.<eos> Just to say we've been told to expect the verdict on Tuesday.<eos> On Tuesday?<eos> Are you sure?<eos> You know, I don't think they'd have said it unless it were true.
It was your book.<eos> Your book held up in every aspect.<eos> Every aspect.<eos> Every detail.<eos> We defended it. But it was the book.
Are you listening?<eos> Yeah, stuff you bought yourself.<eos> Did you buy the car?<eos> Antoine's old one.<eos> Mom bought it.
Here, back then, owning a car...<eos> But he worked.<eos> It was his car.<eos> It was old, ugly and noisy, but it was his.<eos> Sunday mornings, he washed it.
But he worked.<eos> It was his car.<eos> It was old, ugly and noisy, but it was his.<eos> Sunday mornings, he washed it.<eos> Washed the hell out of it.
How time has modified or... wrecked them.<eos> It's not even for sale.<eos> You can't visit it.<eos> I drove by last week, and... it's completely abandoned.<eos> You wanna go back to that shithole, to see how time has wrecked, modified it.
Remember the café?<eos> Waiting.<eos> I couldn't show up at dawn and scare them.<eos> I can see Suzanne on the porch, with a shotgun.<eos> She's such a pothead. She'd grab it upside down, blow a hole in her head!
Okay. It's such a good film.<eos> Wait a minute, I see a spaghetti strap.<eos> No, hold on. This was, like, my slutty Halloween costume from college.<eos> I like the word "slutty." Put it on.<eos> Just try it. Try it.
Ain't nothing to be sorry about.<eos> - Better pop the hood. - Oh, thank you.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Okay.<eos> - Give it a go. - Okay.
Would that be all right?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Not a sound, you understand?<eos> Do you understand?<eos> The money, where is it?
The money, where is it?<eos> Don't fucking lie to me, son.<eos> Point to it.<eos> Clever little nigger.<eos> I didn't steal it from nobody.
Yes, I'm sure you've seen plenty.<eos> - Excuse me?<eos> - I said I'd have them tweaked, okay?<eos> What did Richie think of my launch proposal?<eos> I didn't give it to him. - What?
-(STRUMS) - E.<eos> -(STRUMS) - A.<eos> -(STRUMS) - B.<eos> You start with that framework, embellish it a little.<eos> Maybe you dirty it up.
All through my lymph nodes. Doctors gave me six months.<eos> They can't treat it?<eos> Better medication at home.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I can get you more gear if you need it.
You old bastard.<eos> What were you wrapped up in, eh?<eos> I got your feed here.<eos> Sorry it's late.<eos> You want to eat it now?
Get up.<eos> If I find out that you are lying to me... you're lying to me about this...<eos> What's the problem?<eos> She's got my phone.<eos> I had it on me when I was doing her nails.
If I find out that you are lying to me... you're lying to me about this...<eos> What's the problem?<eos> She's got my phone.<eos> I had it on me when I was doing her nails.<eos> She must have hidden it someplace.
The world's at a tipping point where only the fit will survive and I'm ensuring there'll be at least some of us left.<eos> You and I, we're the custodians of the future.<eos> We could change this world together.<eos> You could finish what Jimmy couldn't.<eos> Your people have 50,000 years of research locked up in stories, knowledge of the land, how to live with it, not try to tame it.
The time for change is now!<eos> Today is the day we take back what belongs to us!<eos> I have successfully negotiated ownership of this land for all of us!<eos> We have title.<eos> No one's gonna take it away from us!
Why don't you hold it and move around?<eos> Do you wanna tell him he's not part of the plan?<eos> Okay, the dog's in.<eos> Now go!<eos> And now to take on Los Pollos Locos, give it up for your heroes, Los Calaveras!
Wow!<eos> That was... just like before, but braver.<eos> I know!<eos> This thing really is super-magic.<eos> But you'd better keep it safe till I need it.
It's like a dream come true!<eos> Everybody, give it up for our special surprise guest, Macy Gray!<eos> Thank you. I wanna see all you sexy people out on the dance floor.<eos> This is from my new album called The Way.<eos> You can buy it online or out of the trunk of my car.
That's my favorite, too!<eos> You got it!<eos> Come on, Dad.<eos> You're gonna love the new couch.<eos> I'll sit on it, but don't ask me to love it.
I'll sit on it, but don't ask me to love it.<eos> What do you think?<eos> It's... it's...<eos> It's exactly the same.<eos> I love it!
A surprising number of surprises.<eos> OMG!<eos> You guys were kissing.<eos> We were not kissing.<eos> Your mother had a piece of popcorn wedged behind her molar and I was trying to dislodge it with my tongue.
He wouldn't listen to reason. They're not gonna be happy about any of this.<eos> - Can you see? Do you need more light? - It's good.<eos> It's right there.<eos> Careful.<eos> Lifting it off.
What was it like?<eos> It was quiet.<eos> -How long has the meat been in?<eos> -23 hours and 48 minutes.<eos> -Do you want to take it out?
-Yes, sure. -Meat boiled in a bag...<eos> -Don't you eat ready meals?<eos> -Of course, but that's different.<eos> -It's the same thing.<eos> We take it out of the bag and brown it.
What's up?<eos> I brought you liquid food. Thanks.<eos> Did you like the book?<eos> -Yes, the book...<eos> -Did you read it?
Look, if the U.S. attorney is really coming, maybe it's better if we don't make you more of a target.<eos> And more important, Garth Sykes from flagship.<eos> Hated seeing you on the cover of the post with that goddamned oceanfront mansion.<eos> Teachers in that pension fund make 40 grand a year.<eos> People who have it spend it.
there can be only one.<eos> I don't blame you, Ken.<eos> I'd do the same thing.<eos> But I'm up 32% this year, which, from what I know of your run-and-hide approach, is 30 points better than what you are at vista verde.<eos> Well, you can call it what you want, but I call it "careful."
Terrible thought<eos> You were right, we need to look into this trafficking<eos> It's very strange that he didn't have a phone<eos> - The Lithuanian? - Yeah<eos> Maybe he tossed it when we were chasing him
Your friend the engineer, what's his name?<eos> He's not my friend.<eos> And why don't you ask him yourself?<eos> This questioning's over<eos> The Danish consulate's put a stop to it
- No, never seen him before Thanks<eos> You know I have nothing to do with your murders.<eos> I want you to take over the investigation, Andri<eos> This padlock has to be locked with a key.<eos> It can't be clicked back
Lionel, I need you to keep this sniper thing to yourself.<eos> What, are you kidding me? I apprehend the city's two biggest kingpins, almost get killed, now IAB and the feds are trying to pin it on me, and you're telling me to keep my mouth shut.<eos> I'm telling you there was another shooter.<eos> The lock's damaged.<eos> I can't open it.
Now I need you to do me another favor, to locate someone.<eos> Get the department's significant incident report for the past 24 hours.<eos> Thank you, Lionel.<eos> The lock's jammed.<eos> I can't get it open. That's it.
She's overwhelmed by Sharif's murder, the media and...<eos> Yeah.<eos> I watched the car park footage with her.<eos> And it...<eos> I could tell it shocked her.
Listen.<eos> Radio and now broadcast...<eos> - Interference?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Like when your cell phone rings and it makes your speakers buzz.
This is Max.<eos> I don't know who's still listening, but let me apologize for the last couple hours of dead air.<eos> We had some technical difficulties, to say the least.<eos> I made a promise to someone, but after some serious thought,<eos> I have to break it. Max.
Grab some guns, Sameen.<eos> You'll feel better once we shoot some people.<eos> There'd be a better way to fight this war if we hadn't closed the system.<eos> If I believed that, I wouldn't have done it.<eos> What if I said I hard-coded a little something extra into the system before you closed it for good?
I know, but I sometimes think if we'd have kept trying, maybe it would have worked.<eos> Maybe we'd have stopped those other attacks.<eos> Or the attacks might have happened regardless.<eos> We made a choice that was right for us.<eos> And you can bet if the government wants a system like that, they'll have it someday, if they don't have it already.
You didn't give me the capacity for despair, Harry.<eos> I had to make it for myself.<eos> There were so many people I couldn't help, but after a while, I came to appreciate it.<eos> The beauty of it.<eos> Human life is ephemeral, which makes it precious.
I don't remember.<eos> Everyone dies alone...<eos> And then something else.<eos> It's so perfect.<eos> You learn the secret of life, and you've forgotten it.
Looking for you.<eos> But I'm right here.<eos> Were you singing?<eos> The fairy song.<eos> Where'd you hear it?
I need to cross a border that's hard to define.<eos> Maybe you know what I'm talking about?<eos> Or you don't, but... you feel it.<eos> Because you've felt other borders, like youth and adulthood, maybe.<eos> I can't change your fate... but I can help you meet it.
And at that time, if you had that kind of money, you paid some of it to the Voi.<eos> We lived in a secret enclave just outside Moscow with many of the other recent rich.<eos> And the snow was seven feet high, but you could still make out many big houses behind big gates lost in the white.<eos> You asked me how I got my sight.<eos> The better story is how I lost it in the first place.
We never thought, at this point, a baby.<eos> We have his room all ready.<eos> Yeah, of course.<eos> Have you brought the money?<eos> Yes, Abel brought it.
The process can sometimes help people to heal.<eos> Storytelling is cleansing.<eos> But I also want to make sure you control the narrative.<eos> That you profit from it.<eos> And did it heal them?
Did you just...<eos> throw up in our fuckin' water?<eos> I need water.<eos> No drinking water right now.<eos> We're using it to wash up.
He's right outside waiting for you.<eos> How do I get back to the others?<eos> Now you know sacrifice.<eos> Now you are ready for what comes with this gift.<eos> Swallow it.
I'm sorry about the violence outside.<eos> But you should know... I can't let you go.<eos> I can't.<eos> Khatun had fed me a mystery.<eos> I couldn't understand it, but I could feel it inside me.
Which took me a while to figure out.<eos> It's like... you don't really know something until your body knows it.<eos> See, Khatun had given me a gift.<eos> It was like a living riddle, alive inside my body.<eos> I could feel it in my muscles.
Homer came back again and again and again, remembering nothing.<eos> But he kept trying.<eos> Some days I thought he was doing it just for me.<eos> Some days I thought he was doing it to spite Hap.<eos> Some days I thought... it was for himself.
But I found this, um, thing.<eos> Well, I swallowed... I swallowed this thing.<eos> - A sea creature. - Oh.<eos> That's good.<eos> I don't feel like I have it... or know it.
Well, I swallowed... I swallowed this thing.<eos> - A sea creature. - Oh.<eos> That's good.<eos> I don't feel like I have it... or know it.<eos> However you described it.
Start here.<eos> No, you, uh... you gotta keep your wrists, like, just a little tighter, you know?<eos> Yeah, I don't know.<eos> I can't do that.<eos> Try like... Like you've got rope around your wrists and you wanna, like, break it, you know?
- $50,000?<eos> Get out.<eos> I'm gonna make her delete the picture.<eos> Nancy.<eos> - She could put it online.
Nancy.<eos> - She could put it online.<eos> - Nance, drop it.<eos> Abel, it's her face.<eos> She could put it online for... for everyone to see.
-Yeah. We'll be coming in every eight weeks or so, just to check in on, uh...<eos> -Who's that Crocodile Dundee guy over there?<eos> -Oh, that's my husband, Hector.<eos> Well, I see he has a rifle.<eos> Just keep it away from this little guy.
Would you miss me?<eos> Well, you... you didn't get lost, so... that's good.<eos> Do you miss Auntie Bella?<eos> Yeah, you're still processing.<eos> You got to do that when sad things happen... process it.
- Yes?<eos> If you saw me leave without my phone, why didn't you just give it back to me?<eos> I could've, it's true. But what would've happened?<eos> I'd have given you your phone, you'd have said thank you, and walked off without even seeing me.<eos> Whereas now, when I give it back to you... I'll have your attention.
Wizard Fist.<eos> Make a cool T-shirt.<eos> How many more bands?<eos> A lot. Get comfortable, Rich.<eos> You wanted a big showcase, you got it.
How many more bands?<eos> A lot. Get comfortable, Rich.<eos> You wanted a big showcase, you got it.<eos> Want me to get that?<eos> No, I want you to let it keep ringing incessantly.
Holy shit, it looks like a toilet.<eos> SKIP: With a turd?<eos> CASPER: Just a bowl.<eos> SCOTT: Fuck, now it's like the duck and the rabbit.<eos> Once you see it, you can't unsee it.
We'll find them.<eos> I'm starving.<eos> We'll stop first at Nathan's and get a hot dog.<eos> It's nothing to cry about.<eos> Man, this thing is beat. Refill it.
I miss you.<eos> Look, I'll find you.<eos> Everything is good?<eos> You wired the money like you said you would, so, yeah. Everything's good, Samar.<eos> I took it back from Khaled without telling him.
Mmm, check out this membrane at the nape of the neck.<eos> We need to cut it open.<eos> We don't know what's inside this thing.<eos> Yeah, exactly.<eos> What if the suit isn't protecting it from us?
Thanks for coming.<eos> What happened today?<eos> It was terrible, I know.<eos> I went home to my kids, and... and I didn't know, but I had blood all over me.<eos> And I kept seeing everything, and-- and I could hear it, and I could smell it, and it took hours for my hands to stop shaking.
We need to nick something big or we're not gonna survive another winter here.<eos> You make it sound so easy.<eos> Never said it was gonna be easy.<eos> The ship!<eos> Where would we hide it?
Never said it was gonna be easy.<eos> The ship!<eos> Where would we hide it?<eos> We're not gonna nick the whole ship, you dimwit.<eos> - We're gonna rob it.
Men renegotiate.<eos> If they do it this way, they get fired.<eos> So it's really not because she's a woman?<eos> No, it's because she got out of line.<eos> You know that we're upping Donnie Caan's capital... tripling it.
- Bring Wags in?<eos> - Axe.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> Thank you for your trust.<eos> Thank you for earning it.
__<eos> Yeah.<eos> Thanks.<eos> The Dunbar Hotel downtown.<eos> What do you know about it?
You've been briefed on the situation at Isodyne?<eos> Just crossing the t's on that report right now.<eos> It will be very uncontroversial.<eos> The spy, Wilkes... He stole some sensitive material from the lab before he blew up the place.<eos> I'm gonna need your help recovering it.
We talked about this.<eos> There are bigger fish than the SSR, and right now, they're more concerned with a breach of national security than evidence protocol.<eos> How is the accident at Isodyne a breach of national security?<eos> If the material that Wilkes stole falls into the wrong hands, it could be disastrous for the United States.<eos> If the SSR has it, it's in the right hands.
Whitney Frost... she defies categorization.<eos> It's open.<eos> Miss Frost?<eos> A package has just arrived for you.<eos> Where would you like it?
Mum, we can't have you weeping all through the ceremony.<eos> Can I help crying when I'm happy?<eos> Where is my blasted handkerchief?<eos> Oh, dear.<eos> Let's get this dress off before I stain it.
Just pie.<eos> We thought you'd enjoy a slice.<eos> And m-maybe Agent Carter could borrow that thing you're working on.<eos> I knew there were strings attached.<eos> We call it the memory inhibitor.
I did.<eos> Wedgwood Sauce Boat... real nice.<eos> Mm, thank you.<eos> It was lovely.<eos> - You liked it?
I shall make you a meal fit for a king...<eos> A true Hungarian feast.<eos> I've never had Hungarian food before.<eos> Is it any good?<eos> Well, I am sure that I will love it.
On your watch.<eos> And I'm not talking about office supplies.<eos> This is highly volatile radioactive material.<eos> Uranium, stolen from Roxxon.<eos> And you need to find it.
Hey, I'm not lying!<eos> That mark on your face is nothing to be ashamed of.<eos> It's power.<eos> And that's what makes you so beautiful.<eos> And you should never have to hide it...
Are you accounting for the easterly breeze?<eos> Three degrees right.<eos> You can't just fire it straight.<eos> The pulse tends to travel on a parabolic arc.<eos> Okay, I got it, Samberly, thank you.
I love you.<eos> I love you too.<eos> What happened to the beach photo?<eos> Did it get broken in the fire?<eos> No, your clumsy wife managed to knock it off the wall and break the glass.
I love you too.<eos> What happened to the beach photo?<eos> Did it get broken in the fire?<eos> No, your clumsy wife managed to knock it off the wall and break the glass.<eos> I'll fix it.
The hell we will.<eos> Let's hear the man out.<eos> I believe that Whitney Frost is quite capable of figuring out a way to fix that contraption.<eos> Probably.<eos> But then you won't be able to use it on her.
I... I just wanted to say one last...<eos> Lewis would have been very happy that this house is yours again...<eos> And I'm very glad too.<eos> Now, it's your house and...<eos> I'll forget it.
Uhh, uhh uhh. Good boy.<eos> What happened?<eos> A glass broke.<eos> I thought you were outside?<eos> Erwin just left. He must have left it on the edge of the table, or something.
I just don't want him to be, like, pissed off at me and then, like, get revenge on me with the food, or whatever.<eos> How?<eos> By poisoning you?<eos> No, just, like, by... I don't know, messing with my food.<eos> You know, like, not washing his hands and touching it.
'Cause if you don't like it, you don't have to eat it.<eos> That is, like, really bloody.<eos> The less you talk about the blood, it's...<eos> That's better for me.<eos> I'm just gonna have them take it back.
Fuck.<eos> And how is everything here?<eos> Are you finished?<eos> I'm not... I mean, her steak is a little bloody.<eos> So maybe we can take it back, make it well done.
And how is everything here?<eos> Are you finished?<eos> I'm not... I mean, her steak is a little bloody.<eos> So maybe we can take it back, make it well done.<eos> You want me to take it off the bill?
ARTHUR: There he is now.<eos> Welcome, skiver.<eos> You forced me to take the King's shilling but you think I...<eos> You think I like fighting for the British army?<eos> While I'm away getting shot at by Turks, you live off of my shillings that the King pays me, you'll spend it gladly.
She fights dirty.<eos> Sorry. I just hit hard.<eos> Hey, Mom sent that care package.<eos> That's nice.<eos> But you didn't want to bring it back with you after New Year's?
Yeah, there you go.<eos> Go build a robot.<eos> What'd you find?<eos> I did an ISP search on all the e-mails that Khaled gave us... and, um, you're wearing my shirt.<eos> Do you want it back?
What's my secret?<eos> This little device right here.<eos> I just take a little blow... (Blowing) (Electronic beep) and it tells me when it's time for a little top-up.<eos> Because when I first got this, I used to ride it around 0.20, which is fucking wasted, 24/7.<eos> But now I leave it at 0.12, which is perfect.
Oh, my fuck!<eos> You got popsicle all over Lucy's car, and it was just waxed!<eos> Wipe it up!<eos> Wipe it up, Ricky! I'm opening the frigging gate. Ricky, just...<eos> Oh, you want me to wipe it up?
Lucy: Look at this!<eos> We've been going through inventory like crazy, we haven't been paid a fucking cent yet, and you still don't have the wedding money!<eos> What the fuck, Ricky?<eos> If you can't get the money back from Julian, I'll get it myself and you'll fucking regret it!<eos> I'll get it, Lucy! I said I'd fucking get it, and I'll fucking get it!
You make me look like a dick.<eos> Get out here! are a dick, Rick.<eos> Lucy, please. There's someone here I want you to meet.<eos> They need a bunch of stuff.<eos> Can you please come out and get it?
Get out here! are a dick, Rick.<eos> Lucy, please. There's someone here I want you to meet.<eos> They need a bunch of stuff.<eos> Can you please come out and get it?<eos> Just get it yourself.
It's looking pretty fucking tasty.<eos> Hey, sweetie. I think I finally got the formula perfectioned.<eos> That's awesome.<eos> Uh, what happened to all the weed in the store?<eos> We sold it. Really?
Julian! Lucy!<eos> Lucy!<eos> Where in the...<eos> Get fucking off me! Julian, where the fuck is the wedding money, huh?<eos> You're going to have it tonight, Lucy.
I've got some weird shit going on.<eos> I want to get fucked out of my mind today, me and you!<eos> Let's get it.<eos> My fucking brain just keeps repeat-ling everything.<eos> I've fucking got to shut it down.
Why do the poor stay poor?<eos> Because the rich take it all.<eos> No, because the poor don't dare. You have to dare to be rich.<eos> Visualise the money and it'll come.<eos> I just visualise it, and it'll come?
I just visualise it, and it'll come?<eos> Yes, money is an energy.<eos> It's a flow.<eos> You have to demand it.<eos> Do everything to get it. You, walk and visualise.
Okay, ciao.<eos> Stop sulking.<eos> I know I'm hard on you.<eos> I know I made it tough. But it's because you've got potential.<eos> You've proved it.
I too vote for Carmello.<eos> This thingamabobble is... is... ls what?<eos> Oh, come on, this isn't an election!<eos> You know what I think, Mak?<eos> That thingy is whatever you want to believe it is.
I was just checking things out is all.<eos> What's all the commotion about, anyway?<eos> Well, Epi just made a good point.<eos> I just suggested, hypothetically, that possibly the sea monster lost that thingamajig you found.<eos> And maybe he's come to get it back!
What's wrong with it?<eos> Wandered off where it wasn't supposed to be.<eos> Broke its leg.<eos> Like you.<eos> Found it trapped in a drainage ditch... drinking sewage water.
Marshal your forces.<eos> We'll avenge the attack together.<eos> I'll escort them.<eos> I hope you kept up your training.<eos> You'll need it.
A 15-kilometer perimeter around Arkadia should be sufficient.<eos> 15 kilometers?<eos> Sir, there's a Grounder village.<eos> Which will, no doubt, be the staging area for a retaliatory attack.<eos> Clearing it will be our first order of business.
You were at the battle of the mountain.<eos> _<eos> Your guns killed our brothers and sisters, warriors sent by the Commander to keep you safe.<eos> I'm sorry for your loss, but I'm here to warn you that the soldiers who did that are coming here now.<eos> They want your land, and they will kill all of you to get it.
- So, a twist, a turn.<eos> - Every three pages.<eos> - Yeah, something big. - Uh-huh, uh-huh.<eos> Um, I don't want this to seem like I'm just shitting on your script.<eos> Oh, my God, I just appreciate you reading it.
Is that my phone?<eos> Do you have my phone?<eos> What do you got there, man?<eos> Like, how did you...<eos> You can't just leave it on the desk.
So, uh, you wrote a spec script called "Witch Hunt," correct?<eos> Was that bad? Am I in trouble?<eos> I...<eos> I, like, did it on my own worktime.<eos> We want to buy it.
Do you have any romantic comedy-themed merchandise?<eos> Preferably something with Winslet and Diaz?<eos> Uh... no, sorry.<eos> - This is very disappointing. - Yeah.<eos> I've had a depressing day and I just wanted to get something that would remind me that happiness can find you when you least expect it.
At least, you used to know.<eos> Yeah, well, my hieroglyphic is a little rusty.<eos> Lapidary hieratic, actually.<eos> An ancient language lost to the ages.<eos> Don't you know how to read it?
- A poem.<eos> "And though my soul departs the Earth, "I count my days till my rebirth.<eos> "I will wait across eternity for my love to come back to me""<eos> The knife.<eos> You gave it to me, and the inscription, it was a poem... a love poem which promises...
I doubt that.<eos> Where's your book?<eos> - I forgot it. Jade, three times this week.<eos> Get the pasta.<eos> The teacher said we could leave it.
"Baird, you gotta stop doing this."<eos> But you're saying, actually, technically, I was kidnapped.<eos> Well, technically, yes.<eos> There's gonna be a ransom?<eos> I'd hardly call it a ransom.
Joe Silverman.<eos> Joe Silverman.<eos> Exactly.<eos> He's the foster father for a few days.<eos> She hands the kid to Joe, he hands it back.
Joe steps in and acts as the person.<eos> So you're a professional person?<eos> That's right, miss.<eos> Initial here and here.<eos> Joe will be the foster parent until such time as you adopt the child, which you can do as soon as Joe takes possession of it.
Really?<eos> Awesome, Lucy.<eos> Yeah. You can take the breakfast as well.<eos> You're not going to eat this?<eos> It's fine. I'll eat it.
Shut off the fucking camera!<eos> What the fuck is taking so long?<eos> Julian: It took us a while to find the fucking thing.<eos> It was hidden behind this.<eos> And he can't open it!
It's sort of about the romance.<eos> (Rapid breaths) Are you okay?<eos> Yeah. Guys, the wedding money's all gone.<eos> Lucy:<eos> What? Ricky and I had to lend it all to Julian to help keep the park.
Fuck! Ray, that mah-fucka cranky today.<eos> Goddamn s-stupid fucking piece of shit tent!<eos> What the fuck?<eos> Hi. Listen, I feel awful bad that you guys don't have a place to live, so I bought you a tent.<eos> Oh! And all you need to do is set it up.
- Yes.<eos> Yeah, sure I have.<eos> Yeah.<eos> So, what they did, they built a big wooden horse...<eos> They built a big wooden horse and placed it outside the walls to the city.
Howie, come here, would you?<eos> Would you come... could you stand right here for me?<eos> Ooh! Where's the money?<eos> Howie.<eos> I didn't touch it. I didn't touch it.
I didn't touch it. I didn't touch it.<eos> Then who did? Who did?<eos> Howie, who did?<eos> Who did?<eos> I moved it!
Howie, who did?<eos> Who did?<eos> I moved it!<eos> - Say what?<eos> - You heard me! I moved it someplace you'll never find it!
Hey. Where'd you hide it?<eos> I can't remember. Okay.<eos> You do know that Angel and me can help you remember, right?<eos> We have plans for that money.<eos> You just want to spend it.
Is she a true believer or is she just doing this for herself?<eos> 'Cause I want to find that out, and I'm not gonna ask you again.<eos> Where's the money?<eos> Trudy, will you just tell him?<eos> I'd rather burn it than let him have it.
Red Guard are only authorised to attack if the Musketeers' rescue fails.<eos> It will fail.<eos> I'll see to that.<eos> There'll be a signal.<eos> Don't attack until you hear it.
I knew it.<eos> Return fire!<eos> They need to work on their shooting.<eos> Now!<eos> Still got it, I see? Most of it.
- Oh, you found the kitchen. Okay.<eos> - Yeah, that's right.<eos> All right, here you go. I'm gonna...<eos> - I'll put it right there. - Okay.<eos> I think if you elevate it above your heart, that's what's supposed to be good for it.
Uh... yeah, I'm afraid so.<eos> I have been looking for him.<eos> I kept praying that he was safe, but... deep down, I knew something bad had happened.<eos> We are so sorry for your loss.<eos> If it's any consolation, your husband went quickly and peacefully.
Yeah! He's out of control!<eos> You were right, I think he's just doing this for the money.<eos> You have to leave his mom's house right now, it's not safe.<eos> Meet me at Factor's Walk in 15 minutes and bring the tablet.<eos> We have to make sure we get it into the right hands before Max finds it.
Here, take the dinosaur.<eos> Yeah, go play.<eos> What is it?<eos> We fished the tablet out of the water.<eos> I had my best tech guys take a look at it.
Yeah, go play.<eos> What is it?<eos> We fished the tablet out of the water.<eos> I had my best tech guys take a look at it.<eos> And, uh... it's a goner.
- Cokeheads, mostly.<eos> - People who can afford it.<eos> It's a luxury drug.<eos> - Consider us a luxury tax.<eos> - We're gonna take it from the rich, And we're gonna use it to help the people that need it. Like robin hood.
- Go?<eos> Where? - Let's get out of here.<eos> - How?<eos> - Get on your feet.<eos> We're gonna walk this thing out to the woods And get it off us.
- You made a mistake when you trusted a man Who burned his own face off, I think.<eos> But no, there is no drug deal.<eos> There's no drugs. There's just paco talking to me about the easy money Y'all were gonna find.<eos> Easy, my ass.<eos> [chuckles] Thought I was gonna die of old age Waiting for you guys to find it.
Appreciate it.<eos> - Yes, sir, mr.<eos> Otis. Your daddy's a good man, beau.<eos> Don't dwell on this. Accidents happen.<eos> Put it behind you?
Evening news.<eos> First edition.<eos> - CHARLES: Enter.<eos> MAY: I've come to turn myself in.<eos> CHARLES: This document you stole, I can bury it.
- CHARLES: Enter.<eos> MAY: I've come to turn myself in.<eos> CHARLES: This document you stole, I can bury it.<eos> MAY: How?<eos> I'll say that it was in fact a military intelligence ruse to mislead the rebels.
Then your God's no better than me.<eos> It's his heart.<eos> It appears to be natural causes. See?<eos> Didn't have to pay me a visit, Mr Coleman.<eos> I simply telephoned to say that we discovered the missing money, or most of it, that my father must have simply mislaid it.
- Yes? This thing at the bottom right here. You're talking about the drink, right?<eos> I am, but...<eos> It's not medical.<eos> No, I drew a line between the important stuff and that.<eos> I just figured, if you saw it.
No, I drew a line between the important stuff and that.<eos> I just figured, if you saw it.<eos> All right.<eos> Anything remotely medical is a priority.<eos> And food, maybe even food before medicine, and gas or batteries or books for the kids or clothes is just... if you see it, if it just happens to, you know, be right there.

Well...<eos> I hope it tastes better than it looks.<eos> 'Cause it looks like shit.<eos> Shit's still better than roadkill.<eos> Okay, maybe... just eat it.
He makes these amazing baked eggs with green tomatoes.<eos> You give us supplies, we'll save Craig and take care of Negan and the Saviors, permanently.<eos> I'm sorry, I find this whole conversation pretty funny.<eos> I mean, you balked when I proposed that your people work for our supplies, but now... isn't that exactly what's happening here?<eos> See, I had leverage and I used it.
No one's coming for ya.<eos> So you might as well talk.<eos> Let him burn.<eos> I'm gonna ask you one last time... how'd you get the bike?<eos> - We found it. - Daryl:
And you're gonna get tatp?<eos> I know it's not the easiest thing, but I've got some connections.<eos> I can make a few calls and loop back with Gerry.<eos> Assuming I can, what are we gonna do about the cesium powder itself?<eos> Ready when we need it.

The dead poet like. Penny apiece, honor Mr. Tennyson?<eos> Yes, all right.<eos> You're looking at my face.<eos> Its paleness.<eos> They call it the anemia.
This is the creature she called Dracula.<eos> I've got to get him to tell us where she is.<eos> We're going to try to make you healthy.<eos> Do you not see the cruelty of what you are doing, Victor?<eos> You created life... so let it live.
Vanessa.<eos> And where is she?<eos> When did we lose her, Ethan?<eos> She was standing in a quiet room, gazing up at a cross.<eos> She reached out, took it from the wall... and put it in the fire.
A recent work?<eos> On loan from a private collection.<eos> I think it's my favorite of hers.<eos> Now you're just torturing me.<eos> Would you like to see it?
Don't come in! Go away!<eos> Don't look. It's bad luck.<eos> Honey, please.<eos> What do you think?<eos> I think... you should take it off right now.
Well, I've been wondering what to get you for a wedding present.<eos> Oh, come on.<eos> It's a museum piece.<eos> It's worth a fortune.<eos> Even you can't afford it.
Are you kidding me?<eos> So is she a total bitch?<eos> No. No, she's not.<eos> She's actually got an incredibly good heart.<eos> It's too bad that nobody gets to see it. Hmm. Double life, I heard.
How do you know?<eos> He appeared to me.<eos> Here, in this room.<eos> He blessed me and made the sign of the cross.<eos> But he was silent, and his image faded almost as soon as I saw it.
You're doing good.<eos> I'm not great at projecting authority.<eos> It's nice to talk Spanish, though.<eos> Reminds me of home.<eos> Do you miss it?
The people there are not a threat.<eos> We need that land.<eos> With the loss of Mount Weather's resources, Arkadia will be starving in less than a year.<eos> I'm here to warn you.<eos> They want your land, and they will kill all of you to get it.
Raven.<eos> I have full access to Raven's synaptic network.<eos> She's ours.<eos> "Seek higher things."<eos> Did you find it?
Ride's two minutes out.<eos> Good start.<eos> We left two days ago.<eos> Why haven't they fixed the gate?<eos> Maybe because there's no one here to fix it.
Everywhere you go, death follows.<eos> You always want to save everyone.<eos> What you don't realize is, you're the one we need saving from.<eos> Wells is dead because you couldn't see Charlotte was a basket case.<eos> Finn is dead because you broke his heart and then slid a knife into it.
- What's going on?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> What is that?<eos> Safe passage.<eos> What does it do?
I can fucking demolish you.<eos> Norma, you are a deadly force.<eos> Where's my shit?<eos> All the stuff I had on the window?<eos> Well, you like the floor so much, I put it down there.
I promise.<eos> I hope she speaks English.<eos> Oh, hello!<eos> Looks like somebody lost track of their beverage!<eos> Ooh, we should act as sleuths to discover the true owner and return it.
Yes.<eos> When we're ready.<eos> So much I've put her through.<eos> Her life has been...<eos> I stopped her breath when she was Brona and gave it back to her as Lily.
I'll finish it off.<eos> Camille, we have a bigger problem.<eos> They're almost here and you can't be caught.<eos> You're too valuable.<eos> Don't worry, I'll kill it.
That thing wasn't human.<eos> And it wanted to kill us.<eos> Presumably.<eos> We were supposed to be rescuing Mills, not facing down living nightmares.<eos> Evil engages us when we least expect it.
- See what?<eos> The hell if I know.<eos> Is this feed recording?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Let me roll it back.
-Right.<eos> -It's for you.<eos> -[both laughing] -Okay, bye.<eos> -Get on the fucking bike!<eos> -You're gonna ride it!
- Blood is being shed, Foggy.<eos> And you've donated more than your fair share to the cause.<eos> - I need to stop him.<eos> - You need to get rest. Okay?<eos> And when you wake up, you need to consider putting that thing back in whatever wacko box it came from.
Or stay in the gown with your ass hanging' out,<eos> - I don't care.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> We pulled the security footage from the hospital.<eos> - I got ten men going over it right now.
I asked what she looked like and all the manager said is that it was a Caucasian brunette.<eos> Nothing strange about her.<eos> All right.<eos> Bring the box back here.<eos> Don't let it out of your sight.
Now, Calvin Underwood hated himself for going to that meeting.<eos> He hated himself for taking that photograph.<eos> But he would've hated himself even more if he'd lost our farm... if he hadn't been able to provide and support his family.<eos> Now, look, I'm not trying to ask you to forgive him being in that photograph.<eos> He probably thought no one would ever see it.
Meechum?<eos> I'm not ruling anyone out.<eos> Sir?<eos> I brought the safety deposit box for you.<eos> You can put it down.
Ah, you know what's not the right move?<eos> Calling me Alfie.<eos> Mom gets to.<eos> You don't.<eos> If you're gonna ride this thing like a damn maniac, I wouldn't have to come home and repair it for you.
All right, here's what we know so far.<eos> This facility was a storage site for the ATCU.<eos> But somehow, the Watchdogs found out.<eos> Uh, the residue from the bombs, it's got nitramene in it.<eos> I don't know what that is, but your tone of voice makes it sound bad.

I don't know what that is, but your tone of voice makes it sound bad.<eos> Uh, Howard Stark developed it after World War II.<eos> It causes implosions. Mm.<eos> That's weird. Weird how?<eos> That they got their hands on it?
- Neutralizes nitramene.<eos> Okay.<eos> Thank you, Nerd Herd.<eos> I'm gonna go call Coulson.<eos> Do we take this debris back with us, study it?
Even now, I'm the one that has to keep everything here afloat.<eos> We can't all just run off to some other...<eos> No one put a gun to your head!<eos> You didn't have to take this house.<eos> You could've sold it.
So, this is what you do at S.H.I.E.L.D.?<eos> This kind of stuff?<eos> Ruben, I'm a mechanic.<eos> I hate this stuff.<eos> You've made it dark.
So, if I were you I'd smooth over what's between you. And the sooner the better.<eos> - Apologize?<eos> - Yes.<eos> What say you?<eos> I suppose I could do it to oblige you.
I didn't want to bother you, Marilla.<eos> You get your hands full all the time. So, I spoke with Rachel.<eos> So that was what all that was about.<eos> Yes, go on.<eos> Open it.
And if one heeds the message... makes recompense... can the karma be changed?<eos> For every action, there is a ripple sent through time.<eos> One cannot escape one's karma.<eos> If you do not wish to become a eunuch... stop speaking in riddles.<eos> Then again, I suppose one can change it.
It's an onus like no other.<eos> If you so resent it, why not relinquish it?<eos> So that you could tear down everything I built?<eos> You really want to be remembered for ruining an empire on the cusp of ruling over all?<eos> I want to be the one remembered for saving it. ...From you.
There isn't time.<eos> I'm going in.<eos> Gideon!<eos> Where's Savage's money now?<eos> Dr. Boardman theorized that Savage entrusted it to the Bruemberg Group, the oldest bank in the world.
All right, where am I headed?<eos> You're exiting the tracheal artery.<eos> You should see the first fragment.<eos> No sign of it.<eos> Did I miss it?
Let's try this again.<eos> Back for more. Where's Savage's fortune?<eos> Now, I'm particularly interested in this thing called the "vessel".<eos> The vessel is my master's most treasured possession.<eos> Excellent, and where can we find it?
I hear her voice in the house, still.<eos> She had a very soft voice... like a little bell.<eos> I'm very sorry for your loss.<eos> So... this is life again.<eos> I've barely seen it for the past year... especially in such abundance.
That girl hates me.<eos> I made her shit her pants on national television. I know.<eos> It was fantastic. But she's part of a much larger plan, okay?<eos> Trust me.<eos> They're only letting you keep the car 'cause nobody else wanted it.
'Cause you can't keep Yael past wrap.<eos> What then? 'Cause we're actually going to go to the press and tell them just how far you'll go to make really bad television.<eos> And there's not one damn thing you can do about that.<eos> I win.<eos> Go to your little finale and enjoy it.
So what I'm going to need for you to do is make a choice. I need you to do it now.<eos> ... millions of you at home are watching, praying...<eos> No, no, no no way, this is TV, okay?<eos> Marriage is for real, okay?<eos> - I'm not doing it.
You guys aren't trying to bring him back, are ya?<eos> Of course not. Never.<eos> Good.<eos> Well, this priceless artifact is yours.<eos> If you want it, just give me the damn crystal.
Oh, this leader of yours must be a real charmer.<eos> We don't have leaders.<eos> We're walking towards a common goal.<eos> That's what they tell you when you join a cult, but it's actually not true.<eos> Eventually, you'll get it.
I'm not a damsel in distress.<eos> Good, because I'm not a white knight.<eos> Seems intermission is over.<eos> You wouldn't want to miss Queen Nisia dancing naked with the nymphs.<eos> My favorite part of the ballet, but I've seen it so many times.
I'm very happy to see that it's still working.<eos> I hold, along with some colleagues, the patent for the original prototype, which we designed more than ten years ago now.<eos> So, this technology is now found on volcanoes around the world, and it's revolutionized the monitoring of gas emissions from volcanoes.<eos> It's my baby.<eos> I'm really glad to see it.

It has the capability of solving over 24,000 multiplications per second.<eos> Holy Moses, that's lightning fast.<eos> They'll never get that to work.<eos> Oh, it'll run eventually.<eos> And when it does, we have to know how to program it.
I'm already unbuttoning my shirt.<eos> My goodness, you know that I can't resist your muscular chest.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> My hands, they're in your hair right now.<eos> - I'm stroking it real soft.
Kissing your ears.<eos> My hand is on that big mountain in your pants, and I am unzipping you right now.<eos> And I'm pulling your shirt off real slow.<eos> No, no, no, it's a button-up.<eos> -I unbutton it real slow.
And I'm pulling your shirt off real slow.<eos> No, no, no, it's a button-up.<eos> -I unbutton it real slow.<eos> -No, no, no, tear it off.<eos> -Pulling it off. It's off.
You know how that thing works?<eos> It's a computer.<eos> It's software with a keyboard terminal.<eos> I think I could figure it out.<eos> Good, 'cause we're gonna need it to run down this cell.
I wanted to kick the snot out of them, obviously.<eos> But Joey said no.<eos> That he'd beat them some day.<eos> And I thought that he would... have his first Change, and build up the strength to fight his own fight.<eos> But instead, he worked on that stutter, every day, trained it out of his speech.
We need to send a message, it has to be done.<eos> Southpaw sends a message, I mean, he'll never use his right hand again.<eos> Look, if he's lying, I'll kill him when we get back.<eos> Okay, Clayton.<eos> Go take a photo, we may need it, quickly.
It is like looking in a mirror.<eos> - We are not the same.<eos> - You're right...<eos> I still have one child to save.<eos> "Bring the fattened calf and kill it." "For this son of mine was lost and now is found."
- Amen.<eos> - Amen.<eos> Amen.<eos> I've been thinking, perhaps we might return to our old home.<eos> I spoke to the landlord and it's available, should we want it.
I was an offering!<eos> A whore, resurrected to be given to your Creature. To spare your life.<eos> But even that great demon has proved to be more human than you.<eos> Do you not see the cruelty of what you are doing, Victor?<eos> You created life... so let it live.
But when he opens it, it's either "hello, mittens" or "goodbye, socks."<eos> Putting aside the potential animal abuse here, what does it have to do with physics?<eos> Yes, Hayden.<eos> It illustrates the concept of quantum superposition.<eos> Light is both a particle and wave until it's observed. Yes.
I don't want to live anymore.<eos> So you go into some...<eos> And, uh... it's a bookstore.<eos> I sit down, and there's this book...<eos> And I start thumbing through it.
What is this?<eos> I'm close.<eos> I need help for the last bit of the journey.<eos> What do I do?<eos> Our bond, hold it in your mind.
I was trapped in this place; Pandora called it the Catacombs.<eos> Pandora was there?<eos> Crane and I were working on a way out.<eos> She appeared and cut his tether.<eos> She cut it?
Meet me in the Archives in an hour.<eos> Hey. You sitting down?<eos> Oh, no. I am standing the length of two men, Lieutenant.<eos> For I am bringing the desert climate to our Mid-Atlantic abode.<eos> It is nonsensical, it is quite unnatural, and yet, because I want it, it is so.
Uh... What was it called again?<eos> A People's History by Howard Zinn?<eos> Of course it was.<eos> Um... right.<eos> I... don't know exactly where your book is... exactly, and, uh, the long and short of it is,
She feels all of it.<eos> Every death.<eos> It's Hive.<eos> That thing forced her.<eos> We've got to stop it.
And the only thing I could think of is why I was there instead of being with my family.<eos> If I hadn't been with Laura... if we had not fallen asleep, if we hadn't taken the other road... that deer would never have crossed my path.<eos> Never.<eos> What did you do with the car?<eos> I sank it.
Yeah, it's the starter.<eos> Probably, the motor sensor is blocked.<eos> If there's nothing else, only that it needs the unit to be reset.<eos> It looks like the rest is okay.<eos> If you wish, I can tow it to my house, and I'll fix it there.
But, for us, and for Daniel Garrido's parents there is another body and another death, that of the missing boy.<eos> And the Garridos suspect that you and your lover are the culprits.<eos> Because she's now dead, the only one that remains... is you.<eos> What does this puzzle suggests?<eos> What does it suggests to you?
It was also easy to discover that his wife worked at the hotel.<eos> And did you wait for me to tell you?<eos> To make sure that I could put my life in your hands, Ms. Goodman.<eos> Where did you put it?<eos> This is where I sunk it.
- I'm okay.<eos> Did you get anything from him? Nothing.<eos> He was calm the entire time.<eos> What about his heart?<eos> I heard it jump, but only once, and only for a second.
I'm not even a real werewolf.<eos> This will speed the healing.<eos> You could've just not thrown a spear into me.<eos> You had a sword.<eos> You could have used it.
Not in years.<eos> Close the doors, would you?<eos> How do you know it still works?<eos> I don't.<eos> I suppose we should give it a try.
I've got 800 years to find balance.<eos> We need to help Mason right now.<eos> I need my sword.<eos> It was forged with a unique power.<eos> It takes a certain power to put it back together.
And if you've got his power now, you can put on the mask.<eos> You can still save them.<eos> You can save them all.<eos> This kind of power requires risk, Theo.<eos> Do it.
She's in a sleeping beauty spell.<eos> Long story.<eos> So here's what I'm thinking.<eos> Why today?<eos> Out of all of Damon Salvatore's greatest hits, this farmhouse kerfuffle was barely a b-side, and then I realized this is where it all began.
Witches like Ariane spend years absorbing all manner of information.<eos> They see patterns in the chaos in part because they view history as a whole.<eos> Sadly, we don't have that kind of time.<eos> Water will act as a conductor, allowing me to enter your mind to know everything you know to see and understand everything that you've learned in a thousand years.<eos> Think of it as a crash course into your mind, garnering just enough information to answer the only question that matters.
When I was a little girl I remember being told that a witch who wasn't consecrated would never know peace.<eos> The ancestors may hate me, but at the end of the day, witches take care of their own.<eos> ... Trinket I made when we were children.<eos> A toy.<eos> You found it, which means you've come to kill me.
But do you really think Damian Darhk gives a damn about you?<eos> He believes that the world needs a reset.<eos> And honestly, John, after what we witnessed in Afghanistan, can you tell me otherwise?<eos> Ok.<eos> All right, so you and Darhk are burning the village in order to save it.
It's the wound from Ra's.<eos> If the life she owes doesn't come from taking others, it will come from the life of the host.<eos> Thea, please don't go.<eos> There's only one way to prevent that.<eos> My father once told me of an elixir known as the Lotus, and I will freely give it to you on one condition.
It's called the Lotus.<eos> Tatsu Yamashiro is part of the order who guards it--or did.<eos> They gave it to Nyssa, and if we don't get her to give it to Thea now...<eos> We're gonna lose her.<eos> Even assuming such an elixir existed, even assuming Miss Yamashiro's order parted with it willingly, even assuming Nyssa Al Ghul's words could be trusted, then yes.
Hey.<eos> Just wanted to check in, see how you were doing.<eos> Well, I think the answer to that question is fairly self-evident.<eos> Thea's bloodlust is the balancing of an equation.<eos> She was given life and now she needs to take it.
Roy already stole a bomb.<eos> No, I'm talking about a device that can destroy the entire Internet.<eos> We're talking banking systems, nuclear arsenals, power grids.<eos> Last year Roy could barely spell "computer."<eos> Even assuming he did build this device-- why hasn't he used it?
Give it a minute, it will pass.<eos> You're ok.<eos> How's it going?<eos> This tiny piece of plastic has more computing power in it than most high-end laptops.<eos> I have half a mind to reverse engineer it for Palmer Tech.
Stool.<eos> Uh, never mind.<eos> Hey, you've gotten pretty slick on that thing in the last 24 hours. What happened?<eos> Yes!<eos> I got it.
I can't hear you with your throats closing up like that.<eos> Steady.<eos> I've got the totem.<eos> Has it had any effect?<eos> Separating it from Darhk didn't do anything.
I like my bubbly.<eos> What can I say?<eos> Ah-ah-ah. Mixing a downer with all the coffee you've had in the last 72 hours, your head might explode.<eos> Yeah. I have been pulling a lot of crazy hours.<eos> After my surprise was blown on my gift, I wanted to finish it as soon as possible.
Wait.<eos> Wait.<eos> Well, I think we lost them.<eos> Look, Reiter is not gonna issue a kill order if he doesn't have that thing nearby.<eos> You grabbing it, you saved us.
Nobody likes an "I told you so," John.<eos> I'm just saying, she needs some time.<eos> Watch it.<eos> It could be a trap.<eos> They just left it behind.
I like bees.<eos> ♪ Arrow 4x17 ♪ Beacon of Hope Original Air Date on March 30, 2016<eos> == sync, corrected by elderman == @elder_man<eos> Thea, your back foot's sliding out.<eos> No it's not!
Don't move!<eos> Where's my idol?<eos> It's not your concern anymore.<eos> It's nearby.<eos> I can feel it.
That is an army of robotic bees. Yeah.<eos> That's my life now.<eos> Brie Larvan.<eos> Apparently, she hacked the prison computer network and got herself an early release.<eos> Feel free to use that, by the way. I mean, you can't put me in front of this beautiful machine and expect me not to take it for a test drive.
And hearing one.<eos> That Sonic device has been modified.<eos> My ear plugs did not do a thing.<eos> The Sonic device is what shouldn't have done a damn thing.<eos> You said Cisco keyed it specifically to Laurel?
My ear plugs did not do a thing.<eos> The Sonic device is what shouldn't have done a damn thing.<eos> You said Cisco keyed it specifically to Laurel?<eos> It should have only worked with Laurel.<eos> The crazy part is that this girl is using it at much higher decibels than Laurel ever did.
Listen.<eos> He's not gonna come for anybody. Ok?<eos> He can't.<eos> Merlyn has the idol.<eos> He's probably delivering it to him right now. No, Andy.
We go there, Merlyn comes here and takes the idol.<eos> Then he brings us to Merlyn's hideout, where we are met with an ambush.<eos> Where he took an arrow for you.<eos> That could have been a feint.<eos> When I confronted him at your apartment, he was tearing it apart.
What about Darhk?<eos> Darhk's mine.<eos> What are you going to do now, Oliver?<eos> Stop the posturing.<eos> We both know that you can't do it.
This was never about expunging your darkness, Mr. Queen.<eos> That darkness will always be part of you.<eos> Then what was the point?<eos> Director Waller, what do you want to do with the artifact?<eos> Have it transported to the SLAB. Yes, ma'am.
Daddy's orders. Hm.<eos> Daddy had a lot of orders.<eos> Someone comes to dust and check the place every few weeks.<eos> I'm paying them too much.<eos> So if no one lives here, then why did your father keep it?
- A monster? - There's a monster.<eos> The monster wants to destroy the world.<eos> It's okay.<eos> Mommy will stop it.<eos> Mommy will kill it.
The monster wants to destroy the world.<eos> It's okay.<eos> Mommy will stop it.<eos> Mommy will kill it.<eos> Mommy's gonna kill it.
Well, this is purely hypothetical, and there are a lot of unknown variables, but...<eos> Based on what Daisy told us about Hive's new pathogen...<eos> We think we know what he plans to do with it.<eos> If he can create some short of shock wave, then Hive could potentially infect a significant percentage of the human race, turning them all into the swayed Primitive Inhumans that Daisy described...<eos> If and only if he finds a way to disperse it
Tommy. What happened to him?<eos> It's kind of a long story.<eos> Well, I got all the time in the world.<eos> We were drag racing down on Route 7 with Davis and Billy when Tommy's car went into a ditch.<eos> That's when they found it.
You think they were motive?<eos> I don't know, you tell me.<eos> Both artifacts were known to be vessels of the powers of the gods.<eos> I have a book on pantheistic deities back at the trailer.<eos> I'll grab it, check back in. Okay, I'll talk to you later.
I only wanted to bring you a bit of joy.<eos> In the dark depths, she was a ray of hope.<eos> Do you know why I stand guard, why I remain hidden in this place, while the others live in the light?<eos> Once, and only once, did all the gods work as one.<eos> We took all the evil in this world, and we hid it away in this box, Pandora.
Worked mostly in the northern territories, until he came down to this area around 1650.<eos> He describes coming with his brother to a village not far from here.<eos> "Thomas and I arrived at Rondout, "a Dutch trading post on the banks of the Hudson.<eos> "The villagers have recently endured a terrible calamity, "an attack by a devilish creature. "A creature they call... the Verslinder."<eos> "The beast felled nearly two score "before the Dutch were able to capture it.
I have no idea.<eos> Come on, Pandora can't be that far behind.<eos> We can't outrun her.<eos> She's psychically linked to that thing.<eos> Got to find a way to shield it or...
The fog, as in a mystical fog?<eos> Possibly.<eos> What if Washington asked you to stay back because they weren't going to New Jersey?<eos> What if the crossing at the Delaware was actually... a journey to the Catacombs.<eos> So, the original painting was created by Emanuel Leutze, who painted it 80 years after the actual crossing.
It's too dangerous.<eos> That's why you should have this.<eos> What do you think you're doing?<eos> I'm giving you your cross back.<eos> You need it more than I do.
We need to get someone in there.<eos> I can't ask anyone to do that.<eos> I can go in.<eos> The gas won't change me.<eos> No, but it can sway you.
-I didn't do it.<eos> There wasn't enough time before voting.<eos> Hey. Did you read my play?<eos> Did you give me a play?<eos> You didn't read it yet?
Well, that's why there's clown spray.<eos> We'll just spray it all over the fort.<eos> You know, you really should call it anti-clown spray.<eos> I mean, clown spray would attract clowns.<eos> -No, clowns. -But it doesn't!
Uh, Carlos doesn't wear underwear.<eos> -Sol, you've got to look at Carlos.<eos> -Nah, I'm good.<eos> -You boys like bingo?<eos> -He loves it.
I would really like for us to feel comfortable someday going out to something like Drag Queen Bingo.<eos> And why not?<eos> I spent my whole life having to look away and pretend I wasn't interested in things like that, or Greco-Roman wrestling, or the Oscar red carpet.<eos> I had a lot of opinions about Cher's dress when she won for Moonstruck.<eos> I thought it was fantastic!
Because I have other names.<eos> "Slip Inside," "Lubri-can," "Menapplause."<eos> "Yam, Bam, Thank You, Ma'am"?<eos> We'll throw that one in... -Yeah. -...so they'll pick one of mine.<eos> They're going to name it the "Frankie Bergstein Memorial Lube!"
Well, according to the deal we hammered out with the lube, they're putting my art on the box.<eos> -And I know what I want to paint.<eos> -What?<eos> My vagina.<eos> Well, if they're going to take my face off the box, I'm glad they're replacing it with your vagina.
Well, I'm just wondering what really happened - while I was locked up.<eos> - What are you doing?<eos> I went to the market to buy groceries, and now I'm done talking about it.<eos> Where are the grocery bags?<eos> Eat your breakfast, or I'm throwing it in the trash.
It's gonna be great, as it always is, from my perspective.<eos> Dad, you promised we were gonna play catch, and then we'd listen to your favorite Harry Chapin song together!<eos> You never told me what it was!<eos> Oh, it's Cat's in the Cradle, but don't listen to it now!<eos> I'm gonna go listen to it.
I worked with this guy once who...<eos> He... he lost his leg in a drilling accident and, um, he suffered from, uh... From phantom, uh, limb syndrome.<eos> His... his mind was so used to, uh, you know, to the leg being there that it... It tricked him into thinking it was there even though it wasn't.<eos> So you're saying I'm gonna have phantom tank syndrome?<eos> Well, you know, it's a, uh, it's a pretty small, selective group...
No, no, no. Let him help you.<eos> Tell me what your body's feeling. Tell me what your body's feeling. - Please, please.<eos> - Every cell in your body has been trained by millions of years of evolution to fight, to survive.<eos> What you're feeling now is real life.<eos> Don't you feel it?
- You're not supposed to do that. - Oh, no.<eos> No, no, it's okay.<eos> Hey, hey, look, as long as we're breaking the rules here, - I have some video of your boy. - Oh!<eos> - No, no, no.<eos> - Wait, I wanna see it.
Pulled some cowboy shit and got Snyder out before the drones arrived.<eos> Will managed all that alone?<eos> He just needed to buy himself 98 seconds.<eos> I searched the area on foot, but he got away in the target vehicle.<eos> I'm sure they ditched it.
You see, Niklaus isn't the only one who's inspired revenge fantasies.<eos> Right now, we are all at risk.<eos> So... while Marcel works to retrieve the white oak, I recommend we dispense with all of this posturing.<eos> Get down to some good old-fashioned family bonding.<eos> I'm quite sure this glass hasn't been washed in the past decade, which makes it the cleanest thing in this establishment.
You never should've let me.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Put it down.<eos> You want my heart?<eos> Then come and get it!
They need my heart.<eos> Or one that's identical to it.<eos> Jackson.<eos> The unification ceremony didn't just marry us, it also made his heart a mirror image of mine.<eos> We need to dig it up.
His heart became one with hers.<eos> Ask Davina.<eos> He's right.<eos> I wouldn't be here if it wasn't gonna work.<eos> I assume the grieving widow didn't just hand it over.
They want me to help him.<eos> Hello, luv.<eos> A Mikaelson witch, a white oak bullet, and I'd say we have the recipe for some real fun.<eos> After all that flirtation, this is your idea of a first date?<eos> Think of it as a date with destiny, luv.
Barry, Poldark...<eos> I'm a Paxon.<eos> He had to look long and hard to find one of you.<eos> They wanted our venom.<eos> They kept... pumping it into her over and over and over again.
You will all fall.<eos> One by friend, one by foe, and one... by family.<eos> What the hell did I just see?<eos> Vincent told me he found a way to extract the serum from Aurora.<eos> I was busy at the time, but if Vincent did steal the serum... if he... If he gave it to Marcel...
Cool.<eos> Well, he's not here, so...<eos> He's dead.<eos> The serum.<eos> No, Marcel didn't take it.
Because of me.<eos> No, if I hadn't convinced him to wait...<eos> No, is that what you really think?<eos> You think that because Marcel wanted them to think that.<eos> Now, the truth is, Marcel took that serum the moment I offered it to him.
No, no, no, no, no, no.<eos> Not yet.<eos> Just stay a bit longer?<eos> Do you remember the Bible verse on John's headstone?<eos> "The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness has not overcome it."
More threats.<eos> So go on then.<eos> Tear me apart a bit at a time.<eos> I may die by day's end, but you will live forever, unloved, pathetic.<eos> Your life a perpetual slog of soul-crushing despair and you unable to end it.
Oh, my.<eos> This day just gets better and better.<eos> Cami, it's been a while.<eos> How's vampirism treating you?<eos> As a matter of fact, I'm enjoying it.
Once we dock, you will take the suitcase and place it exactly where I showed you on the map.<eos> Are you clear as to the location?<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> I am.<eos> Accursed sunlight, I shan't miss it.
Will you take it off?<eos> I'm certain Magnus Bane doesn't want drool on his ruby when we make the exchange.<eos> You know, I wouldn't be so sure.<eos> Most men like it when I admire their jewels.<eos> Can you just give it to Jace?
And how is that working out for ya?<eos> [Alec] It is my job to protect the Institute.<eos> If Valentine can see in, that's a door I have to shut.<eos> Now... let me take a look at that thing.<eos> Now, it's in the proper hands.
We can still find Valentine.<eos> I might know a way.<eos> [sighs] My mother hid a lot from me, but I did see one thing... there's a box.<eos> She didn't think I knew about it.<eos> But she opened it once a year and cried.
Luke will need you if he wakes up. When he wakes up.<eos> I'll go.<eos> I'll go.<eos> Jace, what happened to you?<eos> Luke's car may have found its way into a pole while I was stashing it.
As you wish, of course.<eos> - Let's go.<eos> - Let's go.<eos> Roberto, how's our sedative?<eos> Do you still have it?
I'll get a baby again.<eos> Do you like to feel?<eos> But it takes a while.<eos> Now it's still so small!<eos> Don't you find it wonderfull?

It's like I can be...<eos> I can move any way I want, and, um... I love it.<eos> It took me seven and a half years to graduate, but I did.<eos> And I lived and breathed my mascot life, like, 25/8.<eos> I loved it.
-Oh, please.<eos> -All right.<eos> Well, it is my honor, ladies and gentlemen, to present the World Mascot Association's highest honor.<eos> The Gold Fluffy goes to...<eos> Oh, I could read it if you don't have it prepared.
Thank you for coming.<eos> My pleasure.<eos> What did you make, Daddy?<eos> It smells like you burned the house down.<eos> I didn't exactly burn it down.
She hid in the back.<eos> Why?<eos> She caught us facing off over the jerky.<eos> Shit.<eos> He's still carrying it around?
Yes, hormones.<eos> I'll tell you.<eos> I just, I feel like I'm alone in this thing.<eos> Right?<eos> I'm the only one taking it seriously.
Boom.<eos> In an instant, she's across that classroom floor, she's in my arms.<eos> She's squeezing me so tight, I swear I was gonna bust a rib, you know?<eos> We just stayed there like that, we're holding each other.<eos> Teacher, she's filming the whole thing on her phone, you know, she's gonna put it on YouTube or some shit.
Well, long time ago.<eos> Who's that? That girl.<eos> I don't recall.<eos> Just some girl.<eos> But if you leave it with me, I could try to find out more if you like.
Us.<eos> Oh, great!<eos> Some security detail you two are.<eos> I invited Her Majesty.<eos> Mr. Stewart wants to publicly humiliate us, create chaos and use it to his advantage.
Like, safe?<eos> - Yes, is that weird?<eos> - Well... - Huh. - I get it.<eos> I wish you could see this place.<eos> I can, if you describe it to me.
I'll show you.<eos> Stay back.<eos> 'Cause everyone warned me that prison would be an inhumane environment.<eos> It is.<eos> But I... I find it refreshing.
Oh, you're out of your mind.<eos> You know what it is, what it can do.<eos> Stop.<eos> You've gone soft for that thing, Stick.<eos> If you won't kill it... I will.
At least it wasn't a complete bust.<eos> We found out about Kendra's bracelet.<eos> What bracelet?<eos> My bracelet...<eos> I was wearing it the night of my first death.
So where's the party?<eos> Cold Bar.<eos> Really?<eos> Well, that place is notoriously overpriced to rent.<eos> If Carver wants cash, he shouldn't have it there.
Okay.<eos> Can't go wearing that scruffy little getup.<eos> You'll stick out like a sore cop.<eos> Where did you get this dress anyhow?<eos> Oh, it was left behind by one of my overnight guests.
They said they changed their minds, and I come or the deal's off.<eos> Oh, that sounds sinister.<eos> Just hand over the cash, and no one gets hurt.<eos> Yes, right.<eos> Got it here.
Greedy little jackal, aren't you?<eos> Give it to me!<eos> Most certainly will not.<eos> Hey, f-forget it!<eos> Just-just give it to him!
No!<eos> No!<eos> Idon'tthinkhedidit.<eos> Why? 'Cause he's the Weaponizer?<eos> The Weaponizer once bit a man's ear off for looking at him funny-- this puddle of whine doesn't have it in him anymore.
Oh, that would never happen.<eos> Oh, no, no, I mean, it's not like God sent his favorite son to reign over Hell before, is it? Oh, wait, sorry.<eos> Forgot.<eos> So you can take your ultimatum and shove it up your feathered hole.<eos> You can't see it yet, can you? - What's that?
He needs to tell me where my stuff is.<eos> - Don't. I just sell snow cones. - Lucifer!<eos> This isn't how we do things. This pathetic sap's real name is Frankie Costa, and his real job is transporting and storing illegal goods.<eos> Maze set up the warehouse through him.<eos> So if someone knew to rob it, he'd be involved.
Jana tried to get me to smuggle for Burt, too, but I refused.<eos> Then why were you running?<eos> On Jana's last flight, a package went missing.<eos> A package?<eos> So, what, Burt thought Jana stole it?
Then why were you running?<eos> On Jana's last flight, a package went missing.<eos> A package?<eos> So, what, Burt thought Jana stole it?<eos> And when she didn't have it, he went after Raj.
No, the reason that she left so quickly was because she was unhappy that I didn't have sex with her.<eos> Yeah, I don't believe you.<eos> No one says no to a girl like that.<eos> I'm finding it hard to believe myself, trust me, but, as for your package, Burt...<eos> I don't have it.
One person steals from him, everyone else thinks they can, too.<eos> All right.<eos> But then who has the package?<eos> How... how did you find me?<eos> I'm sorry I took it. I was desperate.
I'm broke.<eos> When the stewardess let it slip how much cash she was gonna make from this delivery, I...<eos> I thought it was drugs.<eos> I was gonna sell them.<eos> Then I opened it.
If Malcolm sees you, he'll kill her.<eos> I'm sorry, but I can't risk it-- her life's at stake.<eos> Right. So you're just gonna get both of you killed then, are you?<eos> He needs this money to leave town.<eos> I won't give it to him until she's safe.
What do you think they're talking about in there?<eos> Kara does have this handy ability called superhearing--<eos> Yeah, but that just feels wrong, doesn't it?<eos> - Is that wrong?<eos> -(WHISPERS) Do it.
Try this.<eos> Fuck, yeah, man. Liberace now.<eos> How'd the session go?<eos> The track ain't bad.<eos> Soon as we're solid here, I'm gonna stop by the studio, pick up the tape, bring it to Richie.
What is it?<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> Supply run.<eos> They're doing great.<eos> She set it up like the three guys are asleep on the couch and Kip snuck in to chop off Alex's hair.
- You got to know how to play this.<eos> - Right. 'Cause you're the expert on manipulating people. So, please, let me learn from you.<eos> Jesus Christ, you call me a child? What the fuck are you?<eos> We are this close to righting this ship.<eos> Right, I know, except you're the one who steered it into an iceberg.
His wife says he works all the time. That's how he pays for their private school.<eos> Not by accounting, not according to this.<eos> That doesn't make sense.<eos> You know what else doesn't make sense?<eos> If Albert was going to flip on Voynov, and Voynov found out about it, why would Voynov have him kidnapped?
I was trying to say, "Let's be civilized adults."<eos> But instead I went "adult movie."<eos> "Porn's on now. Cover your baby's eyes."<eos> The next thing, I see a white T-shirt pop up and I'm like, "Well, there's the dad."<eos> Some of you got it.
No dumb chick.<eos> Did you really set up that interview up for me? I did.<eos> OK.<eos> -Well, Jacob... -Mm-hmm?<eos> I think this is where we can officially say you went up and did it.
The Beast, he's coming for you.<eos> All three of you, you're gonna be kept separate.<eos> You've got...<eos> You've got a crumb on your shirt.<eos> Please take it off.
You've got...<eos> You've got a crumb on your shirt.<eos> Please take it off.<eos> Just...<eos> Just take it off.
I have to go.<eos> He's got an appointment.<eos> When I fall asleep, one of the others keeps trying to reach the doctor lady to tell on us.<eos> That pant, it's got a red lining.<eos> You can see it in the long slit down the side.
Okay.<eos> Um, just before, um, can I...<eos> Why did you give me that book?<eos> "Fillory and Further," book six.<eos> I thought you'd appreciate it.
I thought you'd appreciate it.<eos> I lost it.<eos> Guess I was wrong.<eos> No, you're not, I...<eos> I need to read it.
I lost it.<eos> Guess I was wrong.<eos> No, you're not, I...<eos> I need to read it.<eos> I just, I can't find it.
Probably think he keeps you centered. - Right?<eos> - Kinda.<eos> - Or, you know, you're keeping him around in case you fail here and need to fall back.<eos> All I know... you have to mean it for magic to work.<eos> Something clicks when you're all-in, and the real big stuff, you can't do it till you're doing it without a net.
Damn it.<eos> - ♪ Do-do-do-do, do-do-do ♪ - Quentin!<eos> Yeah, that's right.<eos> I'm talking to you.<eos> I told you, keep up with that stupid song, and I'd come right into your brain and rip it out.
Not much chance of that here, I'm afraid.<eos> Thank you.<eos> So, tell us, what do you think about the tribunal so far?<eos> Well... um...<eos> I find it, uh, fascinating.
The motive is drugs.<eos> She's moving drugs down the Hershey highway. Check it out.<eos> All right, she's probably got some guy that she's meeting at visitation, and he kisses her all long and passionate, but then instead of slipping her the tongue, he's slipping her a packet, see?<eos> And she has to swallow it because of the post-visitation strip-search and double-ended "Say 'Ah's."<eos> So, she goes and she poops it in the shower where it's easier to pull the goodies out of the fuckin' Cracker Jack box, 'cause you don't want your shit getting lost in the toilet bowl.
I'm coming.<eos> Sorry. I couldn't tell you over the phone.<eos> She had a child.<eos> - Or several, right?<eos> We have to find it.
She was right under our eyes!<eos> Marion Larrieu is Isabelle's daughter.<eos> That doesn't mean she killed Pascal.<eos> How did she recognize the skeleton?<eos> She always knew it was her mother's!
Where are you going to live?<eos> How are you going to make money? You thought about that?<eos> -I've got the house.<eos> -You're going to move back to Venice?<eos> I can sell it.
Agreed.<eos> One drop in each eye.<eos> But not here.<eos> I warn you.<eos> Take it somewhere where you can rest afterwards.
Three on this side of the Atlantic aligned against him and three Old World Ancients.<eos> What the hell does that mean?<eos> It's conceivable that he made some sort of accord with them, brought them over to the New World to finish the job.<eos> Carla, I have been given a new medication.<eos> You might call it experimental.

A vessel owned by Stoneheart.<eos> Its contents were kept from me.<eos> But clearly, it is of immense importance.<eos> Whatever was on that ship, whatever evil it contained will lead directly back to the Master.<eos> If I give you this, you will help us track it down?

For the white.<eos> Abraham, you're a very, very old man.<eos> There is only one explanation for your extraordinary vigour.<eos> Strigoi blood.<eos> You've found a way to refine it, haven't you, so you can remain human yet benefit from its restorative effects.
Yes.<eos> Though my hair was much shorter.<eos> What is the name of your kingdom?<eos> China.<eos> And who rules it?
Only your feet will be tired, Your Highness, but at the end of the journey, your soul will be filled with joy and happiness.<eos> Let me have the stash of my medicine.<eos> You don't have to dole it out to me like I'm a child.<eos> But you are a child when it comes to this stuff, and someone needs to control what, apparently, you cannot.<eos> Then how will I get it when I'm in Paris?
- Help them, brother, help them.<eos> - I will try, I will try.<eos> So now we've sent another signal to Paris.<eos> A signal from the gods!<eos> Do you think they can see it?
- I will try, I will try.<eos> So now we've sent another signal to Paris.<eos> A signal from the gods!<eos> Do you think they can see it?<eos> Do you think they can understand it?
No!<eos> Boys, Ubbe!<eos> Run!<eos> Retreat!<eos> Take it!
How do you sleep?<eos> Your grace, I wish to commend you for everything you've done for me, and for paris.<eos> And for me.<eos> I gave you my word.<eos> And I kept it.
The Democrats lost that battle decades ago.<eos> And you'll lose it again. The president never offered up one gun reform bill while he was whip.<eos> Well, because it wasn't a top priority for him--<eos> No, no, no, no, no.<eos> Make it, uh, stronger.
They're going to fight this tooth and nail.<eos> Well, of course they are.<eos> And... and the chances are the legislation won't pass.<eos> Oh, it'll pass.<eos> Because you are going to push it until it goes through both houses and gets on the books.
Oh, my God, am I in S.T.A.R. Labs?<eos> Okay, I have no idea what is going on here, but I've always wanted to meet you.<eos> Your thesis on string phenomenology was revolutionary to me.<eos> - Oh, man.<eos> - I had the magazine laminated so I could keep it.
I don't know if it's human or animal, but...<eos> Also, I was able to test all the blood stains, and I got that.<eos> Does not look like something a teenager would wear.<eos> It sure does not.<eos> I mean, if somebody stole that, they sure as hell ain't gonna leave it out there.
You can't do that.<eos> You can. I once put a Rottweiler in a plastic wreath container.<eos> He sleeps in there. He loves it.<eos> Do you think we can sell this house?<eos> I know I just bought it, but I just wanna get rid of it.
It interrupted my porn. I had to work you in.<eos> I don't know how much longer I'll be doing it.<eos> I think Checklist is evil.<eos> And Susan is right. This house isn't right for me.<eos> I need to unload it as fast as possible.
The Duluth Film Commission would love to sail away with your business.<eos> -Cut!<eos> -[bell rings]<eos> Um, that was good... but you really need to find the heart of it.<eos> You know, like you found my heart and just ripped it out when you betrayed me with my husband, Paul.
[laughing] Let's see, you got... Twenty boxes of Monistat and an US magazine.<eos> Oh, wow, looks like things haven't changed that much -since junior high. -Well...<eos> Remember when you perioded all over the gym mat?<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> I have a photo of that and I posted it on Facebook.
[stutters] I decided to herd with Bert. Then boom, you know, I see you.<eos> It's like the universe doesn't want us to not be friends.<eos> Whoa, look at that pretzel bread sandwich.<eos> Mmm, I want that so bad.<eos> You should get it. You deserve it.
-[man] Fuck you.<eos> I didn't... I had no idea. I didn't know.<eos> Well, we haven't really had any--<eos> Boy, that sandwich does look good.<eos> I think I'm gonna get it. [chuckles]
-I didn't...<eos> Yeah.<eos> -[gasps] Thank you.<eos> Congratulations.<eos> -I'm sorry that I didn't give it to you before your divorce.
-Oh, God. Maybe I should collage.<eos> Mom, let's just go talk to Brianna and see if she'll take out the palm oil.<eos> I tried it.<eos> She won't budge and now I've got to take my lube back from her.<eos> It cannot go out into the world with palm oil in it. It just can't.
But she's never going to stop until she gets that painting.<eos> She's sent me six text messages since we hung up<eos> -and they all say "Kenny Loggins."<eos> -Here's what you do.<eos> You go to the garage, you dig it out, you say you got it back from him, and he sends his best.
Yes!<eos> Yes, he did.<eos> Yeah, we've heard that story a billion times.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah. "He saw it on the wall at Dad's office"--
You speak English? Yes. I do.<eos> Great.<eos> You know this person?<eos> I don't recognize him.<eos> Sure that seems like a smart answer, except that a city traffic camera captured the tags on your car when it was used to pick him up from Atlanta Midtown Hospital on Tuesday.
- Thanks a lot, man.<eos> - Okay, wait, why?<eos> Why the change of plans, Rip?<eos> If you're getting back on that ship, we get back on that ship.<eos> In truth, I never left it.
Martin?<eos> I know, I'm sorry.<eos> I left some very important work unfinished.<eos> Ship's not going to be here, Gray.<eos> We saw it take off, remember?
The world?<eos> Not so much.<eos> Okay, guys, let's fly this thing out of here.<eos> To where?<eos> We would never get it far enough away.
Our time will remain intact.<eos> The world, not so much.<eos> Okay, guys, let's fly this thing out of here.<eos> To where?<eos> We'd never get it - far enough away.
Why?<eos> Because a good many remain opposed to the idea on religious grounds.<eos> Then advise me.<eos> Group Captain Townsend will be leaving Brussels and returning home shortly, having done exactly what we asked him to do.<eos> How can I keep my word after I gave it knowing only half the facts?
And which blights our every human transaction as... as brother, husband... sister, wife, mother.<eos> I understand the agony you feel and I am here to tell you, it will never leave you.<eos> I will always be half-King.<eos> My tragedy is that... I have no Kingdom.<eos> You have it.
I understand the agony you feel and I am here to tell you, it will never leave you.<eos> I will always be half-King.<eos> My tragedy is that... I have no Kingdom.<eos> You have it.<eos> And you must protect it.
I heard that.<eos> Porthos?<eos> I know that face.<eos> Now is not the time.<eos> No, no, no, no, I know it too.
The thought that Louis will leave this world before me is strange.<eos> Very, very strange.<eos> We will take advantage of this?<eos> Oh, of course.<eos> The game is everything and you and I must continue to play it.
It's maybe a day's ride.<eos> Athos, your arm.<eos> I have another.<eos> I told you a full state funeral.<eos> I specifically ordered it!
But you don't remember where you stashed it.<eos> Yeah we remember.<eos> In the caves.<eos> But it'd gone!<eos> Whatever you do to me, they'll be back. They... Will not leave until they find it.
I imagine such an invention makes memories easier to bear.<eos> I will shoot.<eos> Death will come slow.<eos> The gold.<eos> I want it brought out.
Never satisfied, born greedy.<eos> And here you are, desperate to be one of them.<eos> End your alliance with Gaston.<eos> I have made him an offer of reconciliation.<eos> It's a generous one, which I believe he will accept.
What thing?<eos> Have you ever seen "The Frighteners"?<eos> It's sort of like that, but scarier and faster and it's after you... after him.<eos> Yeah, it's been chasing me ever since I got here.<eos> Okay, so how do we stop it?
Come on in.<eos> What do you got?<eos> That camper from the woods.<eos> Got the DNA analysis back on that fingernail.<eos> Still waiting on the blood and the hair, but she ran it through for me.
Don't let death touch me<eos> I should try<eos> To find the light To find the light.<eos> I have something to tell you.<eos> I am one of those seeking the light, but finding it is not enough.
I should try<eos> To find the light To find the light.<eos> I have something to tell you.<eos> I am one of those seeking the light, but finding it is not enough.<eos> I want to refract it to you.
So it's not likely that I'll get...<eos> - Martín's password?<eos> - No.<eos> What?<eos> I think I know it anyway.
Oh, the computer.<eos> She's the kid's girlfriend.<eos> How are you?<eos> Fine...<eos> You took the password and changed it.
Gonna be a lot of eyes on you.<eos> Where's your head tonight?<eos> Been seven years, and we finally have a fitting memorial to those men.<eos> Thanks to you.<eos> You seen it yet?
There are cameras.<eos> The police will be there in a minute.<eos> You should leave.<eos> Please sir. Warning.<eos> I have a tear gas bomb and I'm not afraid to use it.
Where do you think I come from?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Someplace with money?<eos> Well, um, we did have money.<eos> Until grandmama gambled it all away and now, all we have is titles.
Well, to be perfectly blunt, what's in it for me?<eos> What would it take?<eos> You're doing the selling.<eos> Make me an offer.<eos> Let's say Claire gets it.
Nixon was a far more effective president.<eos> The only reason people glorify Kennedy is because he got shot.<eos> You've got that going for you, too, now, don't you?<eos> And you've got your search engine and all your little home videos.<eos> See, if people want a piece of you, you give it to them, right?
I, uh... I really liked what you said in the meeting earlier.<eos> Oh. Oh, yeah?<eos> Yeah, I actually wrote it down.<eos> Hold on one second.<eos> "Life is really simple, but we insist on making it complicated."
I didn't know you had company.<eos> I told you I had a date tonight, man.<eos> I'm sorry for your loss.<eos> - You told him?<eos> - Um, uh... - I mentioned it.
The super agent!<eos> I sent you a tape a couple years ago 'cause I'm, like...<eos> I dabble in stand-up, but mainly my thing is, like, drama.<eos> - A tape?<eos> I guess it's, like, ten years ago, but did you get a chance to look at that yet?
in a house.<eos> That's a hell of a commute.<eos> I take the company plane.<eos> You mean...<eos> You... You fly it?
- Well, it's changed.<eos> It's fiction now.<eos> - But based on them.<eos> People might draw parallels.<eos> Would the Underwoods find it flattering?
Well, between you and me, I'm not even sure this gun bill is gonna pass.<eos> But if I'm being asked to support it, you know the sort of hot water--<eos> Yes, but I need you on the ticket to balance our stance on guns.<eos> We have to appeal to the Republicans as well.<eos> And look, I'm not asking you to get behind the bill, just not to publicly trash it.
Well, what if the story isn't about how she left, but how she came back.<eos> Just because you're here doesn't mean you're here.<eos> Well, wouldn't you like to know?<eos> Don't you want your ending?<eos> Are you gonna tell me about it?
Not just that.<eos> We're confident on the IDs, but if there's the slightest chance we're wrong, it weakens our position.<eos> Then don't use their names in the call.<eos> Uh, sir, our script is written with the understanding that I'd be speaking.<eos> We'd have to rework it for the governor.
If they did, they wouldn't have released two hostages.<eos> They're actually looking for an excuse to back out.<eos> If the media plays that video, I look like a traitor.<eos> We tell them it's a precondition.<eos> If they share it, the deal is off.
I want my life back.<eos> Jingim's married to me.<eos> This is my baby.<eos> You found a way to take it.<eos> Now find a way... to give it back.
If it flowed still... airag, or boal, or wine, or mead... no warrior could stop me.<eos> I'd chase the Khanate as rabidly as my daughter runs from it.<eos> Some are either too simple or too weak-willed to take what is theirs.<eos> It isn't worth it.<eos> I set out to have it on my own terms, and if I cannot, the Khanate is not worth it.
Inside.<eos> Always.<eos> Surely, you have good memories, huh?<eos> That song... how do you know it?<eos> I wrote it... for my baby boy.
Mutated his DNA, turned him into a freak, or something, and apparently, he's got heightened senses-- eyesight, hearing.<eos> Superhuman strength, speed.<eos> Faster than a speeding bullet by the sounds, huh?<eos> What do you think the nets are for? This is not a joke, Keller.<eos> This thing's for real, and it's deadly.
- That's a lot.<eos> - Oh, please.<eos> Just stop doing that.<eos> This is real.<eos> Kevin has a problem and he has to face it.
Why?<eos> You wanna know what I think?<eos> What do you think, Columbo?<eos> I think you and Danny both took Lowry's dope.<eos> But then Danny double-crossed you, took the dope, and he hid it in his place in Miami.
The proof is Nolan and the payments that you stopped.<eos> Okay, well there's no legal documents.<eos> Well, what about Robert's will?<eos> - What about it?<eos> - You like, drafted it for him, didn't you?
I'm good, thanks, and to be honest, um, the blood bank isn't the only reason I wanted to speak with you.<eos> So, I looked into that facility you asked about.<eos> It's adequate, but I think you can do better.<eos> This company pioneered autologous blood banking and can keep several pints on hand for up to ten years.<eos> They also work with local hospitals to ensure that you'll receive your own blood when you need it.
You headed to breakfast?<eos> Yes, but if the ladies start crowding our table again, you've got to share the love. Repeat after me...<eos> "This is Brandon.<eos> His heart was recently broken.<eos> Can you fix it?"
It's your job to stay out of my way, down in Operations.<eos> You weren't the terrorist before, but now you're going to be.<eos> Listen carefully.<eos> Tomorrow morning, you will receive a package at the FBI field office.<eos> Do not open it until I give you further instructions.
Raina, get out of there.<eos> I need to call this in.<eos> Listen carefully.<eos> Tomorrow morning, you will receive a package at the FBI field office.<eos> Do not open it until I give you further instructions.
I wish I had better news, but things are bad here for Miranda.<eos> Everything she's touched is radioactive, including you two going undercover as twins.<eos> And you're not in trouble, but this experiment of hers may soon be coming to an end.<eos> But this project is important.<eos> How can the FBI just give it up?
And you're not in trouble, but this experiment of hers may soon be coming to an end.<eos> But this project is important.<eos> How can the FBI just give it up?<eos> It was Miranda's idea, not theirs.<eos> And with Miranda on leave, pending her hearing, there's no one left to push it up the hill. I'm sorry.
You were right.<eos> I'm glad we came.<eos> I really can't thank you enough for pushing me to do this.<eos> Hey, I want to go get changed for dinner, but I can't find my phone.<eos> Have you seen it?
I really can't thank you enough for pushing me to do this.<eos> Hey, I want to go get changed for dinner, but I can't find my phone.<eos> Have you seen it?<eos> Go get changed.<eos> I'll find it.
They won not just because of hard work, but because of resourcefulness, which will be one of your most indispensable assets in the field, because this job will force you to confront many difficult questions.<eos> Ask yourself, what risks will you take when everything is on the line?<eos> The money for Sistemics is gone, so we have to find another way in.<eos> Well, they already scheduled my intake meeting. I'll use my own money.<eos> No, they'll trace it back to you.
The money for Sistemics is gone, so we have to find another way in.<eos> Well, they already scheduled my intake meeting. I'll use my own money.<eos> No, they'll trace it back to you.<eos> No, they won't.<eos> I'll put it in a safety deposit box at the same bank you were using.
Chloe Tousignant, an intel operative.<eos> Jamie Campbell, a reporter who's been following this story, found me,<eos> Mitch Morgan, a veterinary pathologist.<eos> We thought all hope was lost when the key to our cure crashed and burned... but we were wrong.<eos> I still have it.
It took a while for the cure to work in Zambia, too.<eos> Not this long.<eos> It's not working.<eos> It works.<eos> You're doing it wrong.
Absolutely not.<eos> This-this creature is the key.<eos> It's the pivotal link in the next phase of the mutation.<eos> It must be captured alive.<eos> The tranquilizers will take it down.
But if you want what is best for your daughter, for your sons, your wives, we need to stay here.<eos> If we don't succeed here, you don't have families to go back to.<eos> Everything will be gone.<eos> Life as we know it will change. I am talking about the extinction of the human race.<eos> But we can stop it.
We have him, we have a chance.<eos> We can study him and maybe learn how to reverse it.<eos> You let that thing loose again?<eos> Dariela, now is not the time.<eos> Instead of putting it down, you let it loose again...
Loving sister.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> This isn't fair, okay? It's not.<eos> Cat and Vincent deserved better.<eos> They deserved... their happily-ever-after, and I don't know why they didn't get it.
They can still trace it when it's underwater, can't they?<eos> - Right?<eos> - He took out a fuse.<eos> What do we do with this money?<eos> We return it along with the boat to Jesús, obviously.
Mm-hmm, right.<eos> See you later.<eos> - "See you later." - What? - For real?<eos> - Man, you know what? I'm not even...<eos> So-so the car's got a little damage, and we just need to return it for something a bit more, um, drivable.
You rented a car.<eos> - From the airport.<eos> - Yes.<eos> So where is it?<eos> I didn't see it outside.
- From the airport.<eos> - Yes.<eos> So where is it?<eos> I didn't see it outside.<eos> Well, um, we drove into town last night and, uh, got a little drunk so, um, we left it in town, took a taxi back.
I told you to bring us the boat.<eos> It's in the lagoon.<eos> - We will show where it is.<eos> - It got stuck.<eos> Sir, we tried to bring it back!
You can have the money.<eos> Oh, I can have the money? You're so kind.<eos> We got it. It's here.<eos> It's in that room right there under the bed.<eos> You just take it. We'll go.
We haven't heard much from Mr. Milo since he retire.<eos> Me drop a package off the other day. Something he asked me to get for him.<eos> You know if he get it?<eos> A package?<eos> Me put it through the fence.
My shoulder's fucked.<eos> Pain and suffering, pal.<eos> So you want to keep the money now and... and what?<eos> I... I don't know.<eos> I just don't want her to have it.
Pain and suffering, pal.<eos> So you want to keep the money now and... and what?<eos> I... I don't know.<eos> I just don't want her to have it.<eos> She doesn't want it.
What if we actually have it?<eos> Smallpox.<eos> Then I guess it wouldn't matter how much money we have, huh?<eos> Fuck.<eos> You ask me, we deserve to have it.
Then we need to be straight on what we say or we both die.<eos> There was just him when I got there.<eos> In.<eos> And the money?<eos> - He says it's with the others.
- The other two?<eos> Yeah, we split the money between us.<eos> So where's your share?<eos> I gave it to him.<eos> I didn't want it.
So where's your share?<eos> I gave it to him.<eos> I didn't want it.<eos> Another honest man, who'd have believed it?<eos> The black one has it.
Who is this guy?<eos> He's a drug dealer.<eos> Says he doesn't work for Jesús and that Milo was laundering money for him.<eos> So what now?<eos> If he offers you ice cream, take it.
- It's gone.<eos> But you got yours. Gone?<eos> Yeah, I got mine.<eos> What do you mean, gone?<eos> You mean Lex has it?
I don't-I don't need him back in my bed, I just...<eos> Vincent ran, that makes him look guilty, I get that.<eos> But I know him-- he is gonna do anything and everything he can to prove his innocence, even if that means working with Graydal.<eos> But the longer this goes on, the more he's risking his life.<eos> And I will do anything and everything I can to save it.
Does that mean... that Hook is there?<eos> I can get him?<eos> Yeah, he's there.<eos> Then help me.<eos> I can split my heart and give it to him.
Not bad.<eos> But I prefer apple.<eos> Luckily for you, I'm not here for the pie.<eos> The present I want, none of you have.<eos> But you will get it for me...
You know...<eos> Daddy may have been wrong to ruin my revenge, but he was right about you.<eos> When are you going to get it in that thick head that I do everything for you?<eos> Especially the things you can't do... like Snow's heart.<eos> How long have you been trying to get it?
Ready for your trip?<eos> Don't do this!<eos> It's done.<eos> I've already cast a spell to seal this portal once you're through.<eos> Not even I can reopen it.
You found the Snowman, didn't you?<eos> Great. So who's this Snowman jagoff?<eos> Cochran says he's the I.T. expert.<eos> He's the key to the whole network.<eos> But if he set it up, he's not just gonna tear it down because we ask nicely.
You certainly know her weapon.<eos> A sword.<eos> Yes.<eos> Custom-made for her.<eos> She used it to put Julian in the stone along with thousands of other vampires.
And I have no slime.<eos> -Does that look like slime to you?<eos> Look, you came all the way down here, all right.<eos> Let me give you a picture.<eos> Take it home, show your family, show your friends, okay?
I got it.<eos> Okay.<eos> All right.<eos> So what's the plan?<eos> Well, if they can't renovate the house, they can't sell it, right?
- The book of the what?<eos> white spell book.<eos> Kind of explains itself.<eos> - Never heard of it.<eos> - And yet we tracked it to you.
Darling... what would I possibly want with a spell book?<eos> We don't have time for this.<eos> Put her back in.<eos> You said it was a warlock book?<eos> Yeah. I think my mom gave it to you.
this is awkward.<eos> Where's the book?<eos> It's complicated.<eos> Clearly.<eos> I have it.
Where's the book?<eos> It's complicated.<eos> Clearly.<eos> I have it.<eos> And she's graciously offered it in exchange for her freedom.
and watch your friends die.<eos> but they make you weak.<eos> Let us go.<eos> You can have the book.<eos> We won't be able to stop you without it.
Why?<eos> Why now?<eos> Is there no time in a man's life when he may live out his days as Khan to his own desires?<eos> Not in my kingdom.<eos> What is there in this world left for you that it does not include me?
You have grown much, Lotus.<eos> Wudang Crane.<eos> The sutras and secrets you guarded... survived the Mongol flame.<eos> I will not let you throw away your life.<eos> Then you have to take it.
You've leveled up.<eos> It's time.<eos> No pun intended.<eos> Not to state the obvious, but we are pushing the boundaries of what is magically possible.<eos> We are working our way up to the energetic glass ceiling so we can shatter it.
Five weeks?<eos> I can't do a nickel.<eos> You know what, I'm not gonna post that video.<eos> Now to see if Conrad's prediction algorithm really works.<eos> But if you post it, I'll get...
It means any related investigations are suspended until further notice.<eos> I'm shutting down the Jane Doe project.<eos> Can you do anything with it?<eos> I've got a colleague in Denmark.<eos> Could I send it to him?
Secret surrogate?<eos> They're private people.<eos> Privacy's one thing.<eos> But they wouldn't report it once the baby was missing?<eos> If the Warrens knew about this kid before we told them about it, they're extremely good actors.
We are gonna get emotionally fit because life is gonna come at you.<eos> This is not some bullshit "positive-thinking" seminar where I'm gonna tell you to start chanting,<eos> "There's no weeds, there's no weeds," and hope shit isn't there.<eos> This is a place where you and I prepare for anything.<eos> We look for the weed and we rip it out.
We do the right thing?<eos> I can't believe I did that.<eos> This level of authenticity will lead to a rich life.<eos> This woman will face challenges and she will figure them out and solve them, and she'll make mistakes and she'll clean them up.<eos> This woman right here can have life the way she wants it, the way she deserves it.
I'm not telling you.<eos> - The pillow.<eos> God!<eos> Stop, Benno!<eos> Put it back or I'll tell them what you did.
Part of me is already regretting calling you here.<eos> Get used to that feeling.<eos> - Where's the book?<eos> - Hid it.<eos> Go get it.
Lured her into a trap and killed her.<eos> Which is why she pulled a Corleone, had all the Lords whacked as soon as she got her. All right.<eos> That's not all, man.<eos> They feasted on her flesh, but they saved her blood because it was so powerful.<eos> Gave it to Lord Oculto for safekeeping. BURT:

All right.<eos> That's not all, man.<eos> They feasted on her flesh, but they saved her blood because it was so powerful.<eos> Gave it to Lord Oculto for safekeeping. BURT:<eos> He put it in the bloodwell, and now she's inside Kate.
- What?<eos> No.<eos> Fuck that.<eos> How do we get her back?<eos> How do we get it out of her?
Him, I'm going to take apart again, but you... [faint chuckle] you are going to be mine in so many ways.<eos> Time to join the army, linda.<eos> Hey, Tatuaje.<eos> I want my money back.<eos> I told you we still got it.
Where the hell did it go?<eos> SANTANICO: You brought that monster here, Richard.<eos> Yeah, except it called you out.<eos> Well, what's that matter now?<eos> Just tell me how to kill it.
I got a call about an article on Mike Ross' meteoric rise to Junior Partner.<eos> The problem is there is no Mike Ross.<eos> You reported it anonymously, because you didn't want to look bad.<eos> I reported it anonymously because I was ashamed that it happened on my watch.<eos> I loved you, and you let some stupid secret come between us because you couldn't trust me with it.
Gloria Danner.<eos> Mrs. Danner, a number of years ago, your son, Clifford, was convicted of murder and sentenced to prison.<eos> Is that right? Yes.<eos> For a crime he didn't commit.<eos> How do you know he didn't commit it if he was convicted of it?
I'm afraid this can't wait.<eos> I'm officially giving you my letter of resignation.<eos> Let me guess.<eos> Robert Zane made you an offer.<eos> He did, and as much as I didn't want to take it, I have to.
Robert Zane made you an offer.<eos> He did, and as much as I didn't want to take it, I have to.<eos> Oh, you have to?<eos> You begged me for a second chance and a third and a fourth, and I gave them all to you, and now he's using you to destroy us. We're already destroyed.<eos> You just don't want to accept it.
- What's so funny?<eos> - Sawyer...<eos> This video.<eos> Look at that.<eos> Sarah sent it to me.
That's all that matters?<eos> What do you mean?<eos> - The pickup's gone.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Where was it? There.
- The pickup's gone.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Where was it? There.<eos> Sorry.<eos> - Where did you park it?
Sorry.<eos> - Where did you park it?<eos> - There?<eos> - Where the Peugeot is.<eos> He's taken it.
You couldn't pay me enough to walk back into that place again.<eos> What about a million dollars?<eos> - Yeah, I'd do it for that.<eos> The prison almost looks, like... pretty at night.<eos> -Doesn't it sort of look like school? -Mmm-hmm.
-What part?<eos> All of it.<eos> It feels like we've been living in this chaos for a decade.<eos> I think they're gonna want this wrapped up pretty quickly.<eos> So maybe now we're on the other side of it?
Yeah, I got you, man...<eos> Hey, hey!<eos> Man, he got my phone!<eos> She came right at him.<eos> I saw it.
They locked your sister and me in the basement.<eos> They were here.<eos> They lured us down there, made us watch this creepy video.<eos> What video?<eos> I didn't want to see it again, but I went down with him anyway because I wasn't going to be alone in that house.
They're just trying to freak us out, so that we'll leave.<eos> Well, it's working.<eos> I want to leave, Matt.<eos> Now.<eos> If they want the house that badly, let them have it.
Here, I just... why don't you two use this?<eos> It's a gift certificate for a couple's massage at a day spa, and we don't want it.<eos> But we gave this to you for your anniversary.<eos> Oh! Well, we were just waiting to use it un... until we were really stressed out, but we cope by baking bread or, you know, doing yoga or taking spontaneous naps and...<eos> Sometimes I draw on his face, but then I feel guilty and wash it off.
-Gross!<eos> The wings would stick to your tongue and your tonsils and everything.<eos> Yeah, but at least it won't be wiggling no more.<eos> A baby mouse is like a big jelly bean.<eos> I would just swallow it whole.
It's the worst.<eos> Biros are perfectly designed.<eos> If I had my tools, I could maybe bust this open in a day or two.<eos> - We don't have that kind of time.<eos> - No. She changed the painting because she wanted you to see it.
Drinking the well dry.<eos> Ten bucks says there's a backup six in the garage.<eos> Better to have it and not need it than need it...<eos> - And not have it.<eos> - ...and not have it.
It's like they all vanished.<eos> What the hell happened here?<eos> Must've been hijacked.<eos> But where are all the passengers?<eos> Why hijack a plane just to abandoned it in the middle of nowhere?
- Can you do it again?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> We loosened the bars on one of the windows.<eos> What about that satphone you were working on?<eos> - Do you still have it?
Did you bring my crossword puzzle?<eos> Did you solve another tattoo?<eos> "Got One, Patterson." Wait.<eos> Pretty clever, huh?<eos> Took me forever to work it in there.
Just the two of you.<eos> I didn't know how to stop it.<eos> I was gonna come forward in high school, but then Jones got me a full ride to Hudson.<eos> I took the money.<eos> I thought I could put it behind me, but then he brought in some kids in to watch practice.
She puts up some of the old jazz musicians who come through town.<eos> Turns into a bit of a jam session.<eos> Real hard to get tickets.<eos> This song, uh...<eos> I know it from somewhere.
Do you know where your family is?<eos> What's the extent of her injuries?<eos> She had some pretty deep cuts, possibly from metal or glass.<eos> We've given her a tetanus shot as a precaution.<eos> This picture, what does it mean?
What's the extent of her injuries?<eos> She had some pretty deep cuts, possibly from metal or glass.<eos> We've given her a tetanus shot as a precaution.<eos> This picture, what does it mean?<eos> Do you recognize it?
She had some pretty deep cuts, possibly from metal or glass.<eos> We've given her a tetanus shot as a precaution.<eos> This picture, what does it mean?<eos> Do you recognize it?<eos> I've seen it before.
Do you want to have a look?<eos> I promise you'll be safe now.<eos> I won't let anything bad happen to you.<eos> But we... we need to take a look at your sketchbook.<eos> Would you let us borrow it?
You'll live apart from the rest of the world, but that doesn't mean that you can stop caring about it.<eos> Care more.<eos> Be better.<eos> Live up to the badge.<eos> Don't live through it.
Alex, you were so busy at Quantico trying to get redemption for killing your father that you never saw me making you into a scapegoat.<eos> And you make a great scapegoat, Alex, because you believe in this country even after it thought you were a terrorist.<eos> You still love America, and you think it loves you back, but it doesn't.<eos> Never did.<eos> And now you won't be there to see it burn.
Alexandra Parrish, my name is Matthew Keyes.<eos> It is my belief, as it is many others who work for me, that the FBI treated you terribly.<eos> They didn't trust you, they certainly didn't help you, and then they hung you out to dry.<eos> But I know that you love this country.<eos> And although you can't do very much for it right now, I know you wish you could.
Get out of my way.<eos> There is a tomb here.<eos> Show us the treasure, please.<eos> Move aside.<eos> Come, we wish to see it.
Are you all right?<eos> Mr Carter was right... about the tomb.<eos> - What do you mean?<eos> - Tutankhamun's tomb, it was in the Valley.<eos> Mr Davis has just found it.
What little mirage did you see on the horizon?<eos> All right.<eos> Go, find yourself a crew.<eos> Where's the cash coming from?<eos> Carnarvon's wiring it from London.
- If we touch them...<eos> - Wax.<eos> Paraffin wax.<eos> It's neutral, stable.<eos> We melt it down, paint it on, drip it on, let it solidify, and then we lift them out.
I was the one that started this.<eos> No, no, no, I will not hear this.<eos> Go to your room!<eos> Well,<eos> Do we open it?
And for years now, I thought it was the tomb.<eos> The tomb.<eos> When I find the tomb I will feel complete.<eos> I will be Howard Carter.<eos> But I've found it.
Standing there that first night... Surrounded by treasure... So much beauty.<eos> I thought...<eos> I was hoping you could have this.<eos> Do you remember?<eos> You... picked it up because it - Carter, stop it.
I'm Detective Babineaux.<eos> This is Assistant ME Moore. Yeah, um...<eos> Jordan never took back his key and I was just... Worried he forgot to do something else.<eos> Update his system software?<eos> I think he may have made another sex tape of us and never destroyed it.
What a horrible person!<eos> And if that went public, it would destroy her career.<eos> That's what I thought. So, as long as Jordan had this video, he had total power over Starlee.<eos> Absolutely.<eos> Ravi took a video of me snoring, and I was on the verge of ripping out every follicle of his facial hair if he hadn't deleted it.
- Is that a camera?<eos> - Yeah, Paul spying on her.<eos> Actually, I think Beth was spying on Paul.<eos> When I was her, I found surveillance equipment.<eos> She got it from Raj at the station.
Well, it's not a tracking device.<eos> At least not primarily.<eos> It's way too over-built for that.<eos> And it must produce some anesthetic, like a leech when it latches on.<eos> That's why she doesn't feel it.
You can go to hell.<eos> If I can't find MK, I need to find this Dizzy guy.<eos> - Who now?<eos> - The guy who showed me the video.<eos> Maybe he knows how to take it out without killing me.
Who the hell are ya'?<eos> I just wanna talk.<eos> Can I come in?<eos> You stole my phone.<eos> I brought it back.
How do you know him?<eos> You need to stop talking now.<eos> All right. I can do that.<eos> Your implant, it's gone.<eos> How did you get rid of it?
I'm out.<eos> I don't fancy you either, mate.<eos> Okay, never mind that for a second, but just listen.<eos> My... My friend Ed wasn't the only one with one of those things driving him crazy.<eos> You know how to get rid of it.
Yeah? - I found something.<eos> - What have you got?<eos> I went spear fishing on Duko.<eos> Your detective receives payments from a Brightborn shell to an account in the Caribbean.<eos> He hid it well, but I found it.
My niece, Meline, is, like, 10.<eos> She has no one.<eos> It's a pretty name.<eos> I had to take that money.<eos> I put it aside for her.
just the moment.<eos> I'm interested in the moment, you know?<eos> And I saw you and...<eos> There's something with you.<eos> Do you want to see it?
- And don't worry, Piper.<eos> It's sterilized by the flame.<eos> Fuck it.<eos> Seriously?<eos> Why would you offer it to me, if you weren't actually gonna share it with me?
I have three employees.<eos> Now, let's see this Pulitzer-winning photo.<eos> You wrapped it in a T-shirt?<eos> Yeah, it was up a nun's vagina.<eos> You didn't... You didn't rinse it?
Hey, excuse me. Excuse me, what the hell is going on?<eos> Honey, is that you?<eos> Daddy!<eos> So, like... there's this crazy Ninja thing and then just rams the knife in her hand through Ted's head.<eos> She rips it off and then takes the knife, takes the...
What's the last one I saw before it all went bad?<eos> It starred Adam Sandler.<eos> See, now if you want a sign of the apocalypse coming, I mean... that's it.<eos> You never did say how you got that brand.<eos> They gave it to me.
She's the only thing keep us alive right now.<eos> Vanessa will be fine, they can't turn and they're not likely to kill her if they came all this way.<eos> Maybe that's the answer.<eos> I'm toxic to them.<eos> What if we used my blood and dispersed it like a chemical weapon?
Because he's more interesting than me. Bingo.<eos> Here, let me respond.<eos> No.<eos> Molly, how was your day?<eos> My heart spoke to me, but I didn't want to hear it.
- Not getting any better, hon.<eos> But I know that some day people will see through the noise and understand what a beautiful soul you are.<eos> Let's get serious.<eos> God, I hate that picture.<eos> I love it.
Those who are marked... who are chosen...<eos> - often did not choose it themselves.<eos> - I feel you, sister.<eos> The Tate family were cattle rustlers.<eos> They stole livestock and rebranded it as their own.
- I swear I don't.<eos> Look.<eos> I need you to understand.<eos> See, we didn't have a daddy.<eos> Mama had some money, but she put it all into an old hotel and restaurant.
We thought you'd find this place and our appearance less upsetting.<eos> Yet you seem upset.<eos> My friends, my city... my whole world is in danger.<eos> Zoom is on a rampage with the power that he stole from me, and you are keeping me here.<eos> You were given a rare and precious gift, and you rejected it.
My mom and I read this when I was little.<eos> Do you know it? Yeah.<eos> I-I never really liked that book.<eos> Why?<eos> Because it was about a mother who was always there for her child, no matter what, and that wasn't my mom... or yours.
I bet he was a wonderful father.<eos> He was responsible for the assassination of at least five exiles in London and Bonn.<eos> At home, he raided houses because people read the wrong books.<eos> I'll bet he kept that secret.<eos> When you have a home, you do anything to protect it.
Man, that car's been with him through thick and thin.<eos> War and peace.<eos> It was his everything.<eos> I mean, it didn't even have a CD player though.<eos> True that... but he loved it.
Forget the stupid book.<eos> Chasing that thing's only going to give you a leg cramp.<eos> You don't know what you're talking about.<eos> Oh, I don't?<eos> You're the one who grew up your entire life looking for that book, and you never found it.
Stop it!<eos> What is your genius plan for getting the book back?<eos> Throw one of our epic parties tonight.<eos> And the kids who stole your car will show up.<eos> We might not be able to find the book, but we can go after the ones who are searching for it.
Here we go.<eos> We're going to die here.<eos> This car's going to kill us.<eos> There's no use!<eos> There's no controlling it!
Shivering is your body's way of warming itself up.<eos> Fantastic tidbit.<eos> Please, keep 'em coming.<eos> You'll recover faster and I need you to steer.<eos> You're white-knuckling my wheel. You sure you want to give it up?
A house, maybe. With a well, water.<eos> We could go to the border, the river.<eos> Yeah, but people pressing in from both sides is dangerous.<eos> - But water.<eos> - That's why it's dangerous.
We could go to the border, the river.<eos> Yeah, but people pressing in from both sides is dangerous.<eos> - But water.<eos> - That's why it's dangerous.<eos> Everyone needs it. Everyone goes there to feed.
-I promise you I do.<eos> No, because that's just theater.<eos> It allows you to think you're in control, but the whole idea of control is a myth.<eos> The universe is a wild beast.<eos> You can't tame it.
This is my home.<eos> You're my people. I wish to serve.<eos> Speak to the scouts as I asked.<eos> This is how you serve.<eos> If we don't deliver the oxy, they'll come looking for it.
My husband, he's found some...<eos> Book of the Dead, and... I don't know, it's... changed him somehow.<eos> Where's the book now?<eos> I have no idea, I'm chained to the damn wall!<eos> I can help you find it.
Not until I know where that book is.<eos> Now spill.<eos> Unlock me first.<eos> Not a chance.<eos> He always keeps it with him, so the book is here now.
It's here! The golden envelope.<eos> -Herr Peanutbutter? Okay.<eos> Oh, my phone.<eos> What should I do with it, Todd?<eos> -Maybe you should hold it. -Uh-huh.
-Herr Peanutbutter? Okay.<eos> Oh, my phone.<eos> What should I do with it, Todd?<eos> -Maybe you should hold it. -Uh-huh.<eos> -No, I'll take it with me. -All right.
Tricked again!<eos> -[ringtone playing] -Todd, it's ringing.<eos> This is it.<eos> Oh, no, my phone!<eos> Oh, no, I kicked it, right through that doorway into the hallway!
The ratings aren't great, but we have this upcoming episode, and we're looking for a really big guest star.<eos> You want me to be on your show?<eos> Well, I just thought it would be really fun for... the both of us.<eos> You know, like the old days.<eos> I have the script with me if you want to take a look at it. Um, okay.

Um, okay.<eos> Why don't you put it on that pile over there? And I'll get to it when I have some free time.
What about Bernard?<eos> Bernard, yes.<eos> But who am I?<eos> That is a very complex question, for which I can only offer a simple answer.<eos> You are the perfect instrument, the ideal partner, the way any tool partners with the hand that wields it.
I need to speak with Mr. Du Clark right now.<eos> Not gonna happen.<eos> Mr. Du Clark's taken every precaution to make this a truly private party.<eos> The gate is on a timed release.<eos> I couldn't open it even if I wanted to.
He can bring all of them back.<eos> ... But not me.<eos> I hope there's some solace ... that I left you no choice.<eos> Charlie's favorite song.<eos> I would play it for him ...
Not exactly.<eos> You're pulling prints.<eos> Searching Toby's apartment today, I was struck by the fact that he had two hiding places for his deviant treasures.<eos> I couldn't help but wonder if the migration of his stash from one to the other was born out of necessity, rather than paranoia.<eos> So, you think someone found what he was hiding, so he moved it.
Just hear me out!<eos> I've been hearing you out.<eos> Now you need to hear me out.<eos> I'm done with that life.<eos> I don't want it. I don't miss it.
Now you need to hear me out.<eos> I'm done with that life.<eos> I don't want it. I don't miss it.<eos> Well, that's just a flat-out lie.<eos> I don't want it.
It'd be a hell of a partnership.<eos> My grandfather, Jonas Quincannon.<eos> One time, the Gormann Brothers had a pork concern out at Las Cruces.<eos> Hoping to move in on his territory, they were pressuring wholesalers, something like that.<eos> Uh, anyway, Jonas found out about it.
What are you doing?<eos> You just broke my kid's art thing!<eos> So, yeah, nice job.<eos> What?<eos> I'll fix it.
That is... that's wrong.<eos> Come on.<eos> It's like lady and the tramp, except with our butts.<eos> Jesse custer, do not come near me with that thing, i swear to god.<eos> Come on, you know you want it.
- You shouldn't force him. - Yeah, but you have to, like, try steak at least once in your life.<eos> Yeah, it's really good.<eos> It is really good.<eos> I'm a great cook.<eos> If you're going to eat it this is the way to go, right?
Think they'll show?<eos> Don't know.<eos> Don't really care.<eos> Either way, I'm getting my jolts.<eos> You see, Cat, I'm still 50-50 if your heart's actually beating, but I'm gonna stop it anyway.
We're lucky. This TV station is old.<eos> Not that old.<eos> Not old-old.<eos> But old enough that it uses broadcast technology instead of digital.<eos> We can transmit a signal by calibrating it to Myriad's frequency, without leaving any online fingerprints.
And did you hear anything?<eos> I didn't hear a thing...<eos> Except the sound of Arthur bashing his head through that window.<eos> He just wanted that noise to stop.<eos> He said, "Get it out of my head."
- All right.<eos> Damn it.<eos> Oh, wow.<eos> What does the thing do with human flesh?<eos> It just melt, presumably.
There's more.<eos> - Clarence House...<eos> - Our home.<eos> What about it?<eos> We have to give it up.
A tiny white community, surrounded by primitive Africans, grew into a young and flourishing nation with the ever brightening promise of more prosperity before it.<eos> - Hurry up!<eos> - Yes, sir!<eos> We honour a man of remarkable vision, who saw how great this land could become, once civilized.<eos> I wish continued prosperity and success to all those who inhabit it.
- I am...<eos> - Dead.<eos> As it should be.<eos> You were given choice in life.<eos> I give you the honor to choose how you wish to leave it.
A love poem?<eos> Yeah, I guess if it's for you, it's a love poem.<eos> It's kind of inspired by our, uh, Ohio Blue Tip Matches.<eos> Really?<eos> Does it mention the little megaphone shape the letters make?
Really?<eos> Does it mention the little megaphone shape the letters make?<eos> Y-Yeah. Actually, it does.<eos> How beautiful.<eos> I can't wait to read it when it's done.
Pumpkin<eos> My little pumpkin,<eos> I like to think about other girls sometimes, but the truth is if you ever left me,<eos> I'd tear my heart out<eos> and never put it back.
Hey, guys, I'd... I'd appreciate it if you didn't say anything to my mother about me getting attacked.<eos> I don't want her to get freaked out.<eos> Okay, but we're gonna need your shirt.<eos> Excuse me? Some of the blood on it might not be yours.<eos> We can use it to help identify whoever attacked you.
Maybe that includes saving Hannah.<eos> We need to ride the day out here, see if the machine brings us back.<eos> We tried it your way.<eos> What do you think Jennifer really meant?<eos> She said... time knows Jones invented time travel, and it needs her to do it.
Now we have nothing.<eos> That's him.<eos> How did you get this?<eos> We left him a phone, so he'd know who's been screwing with him.<eos> He used it?
That's him.<eos> How did you get this?<eos> We left him a phone, so he'd know who's been screwing with him.<eos> He used it?<eos> No, but he kept it.
How did you get this?<eos> We left him a phone, so he'd know who's been screwing with him.<eos> He used it?<eos> No, but he kept it.<eos> Didn't know we chipped it.
Against what?<eos> The future.<eos> This project is massive.<eos> It is.<eos> That's why we're calling it "Titan."
One last mission to stop the paradox.<eos> After that, we will come back, find The Witness, and make him pay.<eos> - I promise.<eos> - Jones.<eos> You're willing to die here on the chance that maybe we can undo it?
The Witness spoke of you a great deal.<eos> Where is your research now?<eos> In my lab in West Berlin.<eos> The sample is there, unfinished but safe.<eos> If we could destroy it...
What are you doing here?<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> The house?<eos> It's mine.<eos> I bought it.
- Sir.<eos> - But no more.<eos> And what about the meeting with Eisenhower in Washington?<eos> Alas, as I have been refused permission to fly, I am left with no option.<eos> - To postpone it?
Lucky them.<eos> Dope.<eos> Let's dip up out of here.<eos> (CAMERA CLICKING) MAN: Customer that rents this slip was having his boat repaired.<eos> Showed up today to dock it, and found this one in his space.
All right, let's get a little funk in here, ladies!<eos> Okay.<eos> Little more funky energy in this thing!<eos> Got to warm up, you know?<eos> Got to get it warmed up!
Jay!<eos> Jay.<eos> The water is coming inside the house from the pool!<eos> Of course it is.<eos> Because Phil was supposed to pump it out!
Could have.<eos> All right, give me your fucking money.<eos> Oh, it's in there.<eos> Just...<eos> Get it out and give it to me!
The door to the garden's through here.<eos> The stove's on the fritz.<eos> You can use the microwave in the meantime. Uh...<eos> Bed's made.<eos> I rent it out... AirBnB.
Just go take a walk, please.<eos> He's just like your fuckin' father.<eos> Get out!<eos> We needed that house, nina.<eos> We needed it.
I'll manage.<eos> Just... Let me talk to jp, okay?<eos> He will calm down.<eos> I don't want the house.<eos> Just tell jp he can have it.
He will calm down.<eos> I don't want the house.<eos> Just tell jp he can have it.<eos> He can sell it. I don't care.<eos> He can't have it.
You think that Charlotte and those other people were killed by death cap poison?<eos> Toxicology proved it. Before I made VP,<eos> I worked my way up as a biochemist, and I know for a fact there's no way naturally-occurring death cap poison could kill those people so quickly.<eos> On that, we agree.<eos> Our current theory is that the killer extracted mycotoxin from a large number of mushrooms and then concentrated it to produce a lethal dose.

I would never have hurt her.<eos> But you're not together anymore.<eos> When we started hanging out, she was fun.<eos> She liked to take mushrooms, drop acid, do Molly.<eos> Chemists-- we get the best stuff, 'cause we make it ourselves.
One minute.<eos> Mr. Rivington. Thank you for guiding...<eos> Curious you're writing on music paper.<eos> Yes, yes, it's a copy.<eos> Got it for Nelly, Father.
And I was in the middle of doing three weeks' worth of laundry.<eos> And I was actually writing a term paper right when the lights went out, and... what?<eos> This isn't soda.<eos> Okay, before you guys say anything, I only put this on because I didn't have anything...<eos> Well, the problem obviously self-corrected, which I knew it would.

I lied about a lot of things back then.<eos> What the hell are you doing? !<eos> That takes me three days!<eos> Three days to prepare!<eos> And then you say that you love it, and you feed it to the dog?
We should alert the M.E. that this bag contains at least part of the face.<eos> I'm sure he'll appreciate that.<eos> So the bootprint found next to his car suggests he drove there himself.<eos> Pepper spray, it's a close-range weapon.<eos> Whoever deployed it would have had to have been close to him.
May I assume your visit had something to do with his book?<eos> You know about the book?<eos> An hour ago, I signed for a box which contained nearly 200 copies... but I've been aware of it for months.<eos> An associate brought it to my attention.<eos> You read it?
You said you'd escaped from it, as opposed to the house, because, like Keith, the house didn't exist, and you didn't have to worry about leading anyone back to it.<eos> I was never worried about fooling the police or the FBI.<eos> Just Richard and Nancy.<eos> I had this whole script ready, things I would say or do, if I thought they were getting suspicious.<eos> Only... I never needed it.
Joanie, what are you...?<eos> I'm sorry I got so angry about the book.<eos> Oh, you don't have anything to apologize for.<eos> Well, I've changed my mind.<eos> I'm okay with it being out there, so whatever you told your publishers to do, you can tell them to stop.
That's perfect.<eos> Can you get your eyes up? I...<eos> I'm a little dizzy.<eos> Okay, it's probably the lights.<eos> Happens if you're not used to it.
I'm all out.<eos> I told you not to use that stuff!<eos> - I need more.<eos> - Who is she?<eos> - Did you bring it?
I mean, it can't have been easy being married to...<eos> Mr. LeGare, do you mind if we take a look at your backyard?<eos> Stone patio in the back, grass in the front.<eos> Nowhere to grow hemlock.<eos> Maybe he bought it.
-The tracker's not in the dog?<eos> -You're holding it.<eos> It's in the dongle.<eos> We're not far from the park where our missing tech guru was abducted.<eos> The kidnapper probably tossed it.
One set up from your home while Grace was at work.<eos> You sent that email. Your nurse Todd confirmed you had a window box planter.<eos> The week before Grace's death, you ordered him to take it down, trash it.<eos> He didn't. He gave it to another one of his patients.<eos> Now we have it.
♪ So on reflection, perhaps maybe not ♪<eos> Who is that?<eos> Looks like they're advancing on the Valencians.<eos> I can't tell, but they missed my song.<eos> Maybe we ask them to wait so I can run out and sing it again.
I think there's another full bottle in here. Maybe it'll be okay.<eos> Candy?<eos> Where's your trivia genie costume?<eos> In my car.<eos> Get it.
- "Almost any..."<eos> - Wait.<eos> If Bailey was making a big buy from Steve, and he pats her down...<eos> - Discovers the wire...<eos> - Uses it to strangle her.
Oh, I got news for you, Steve.<eos> The money Bailey was gonna use to buy your Lucky U, the money you stole from her after you killed her, those were marked bills.<eos> Guess what's gonna happen to you when I find that money?<eos> Save me some time.<eos> Tell me where you've got it.
It's all going in my report.<eos> Bailey's death was tragic and I have to live with that.<eos> But my CI program gets drugs off the streets.<eos> It saves lives.<eos> You shut it down, you're putting kids in danger.
Okay, we're done here. We're going to take this up to the judge.<eos> I'm going to finish my questioning, and you can move to suppress it at trial, if we get to trial, which we won't.<eos> I'm going to sue your ass for invading this guy's privacy.<eos> However you got that video, you broke the goddamn law.<eos> He made it public.
It's going to be okay. Would you pick him up?<eos> - God damn. - Wow.<eos> Come on. Let's go. Up.<eos> Promise me you won't show that tape to the police.<eos> You're the one who put it out there!
Nolan never mentioned that to me.<eos> Yeah, well, it's kind of one of those things.<eos> The record company went bust or something.<eos> And the record never came out.<eos> If you want, I can play it for you sometime.
What if Aguirre is telling the truth?<eos> Well... what if he wasn't?<eos> Even still, it doesn't sit right with me.<eos> What do you know about how your father bought the inn?<eos> Well, he was getting out of the Navy, and he found a piece of property that he liked, so he bought it.
Well... what if he wasn't?<eos> Even still, it doesn't sit right with me.<eos> What do you know about how your father bought the inn?<eos> Well, he was getting out of the Navy, and he found a piece of property that he liked, so he bought it.<eos> And then he called my mom, and she came... and they built it together.
Bye.<eos> Bye.<eos> He's gone!<eos> Let's start in the garage!<eos> Okay, so once we receive the next image and compare it to the ones we've already collected, we'll know what it is that we found.
To Fillory for spring break.<eos> V's amazing.<eos> I mean, she literally blips around the universe, fearless.<eos> Teachers put this tattoo on her to stop her.<eos> She just cut it off herself.
How about nothing?<eos> You withdraw everything, admit you were wrong... give up your law license, give me title to your car, and you let me fuck you up the ass.<eos> Don't forget, legally, you have to convey the offer to the client.<eos> I gave this to your assistant.<eos> But the fact that you didn't complain tells me that you told her to ignore it.
We literally jumped out my window.<eos> We walked out to the car.<eos> They kind of drove to a neighborhood.<eos> We had to walk through a couple of backyards to get to his house.<eos> So you could kinda tell that he was hiding it from his parents.
"Don't you ever say anything to her again."<eos> And I knew for a fact, he's a little weeny bag.<eos> He would have been easy to kick the crap out of.<eos> There was kind of a rumor, there was no for sure about it, but I found out from the grapevine that there was a video.<eos> One of the few people I still talk to, had seen it and heard about it being passed around.
There was kind of a rumor, there was no for sure about it, but I found out from the grapevine that there was a video.<eos> One of the few people I still talk to, had seen it and heard about it being passed around.<eos> He said that it was kind of blurry and it was really dark.<eos> And then it got more graphic and... him on top of her and she was just kind of, like... limp and not really functioning very well.<eos> He guaranteed I didn't wanna see it and if I did, that bad things would happen.
Okay.<eos> Brittany Gold.<eos> Get out of the car.<eos> I'm sorry about the tape.<eos> Billy won't show it to anyone, especially not your wife.
- Uh, Mr. McBride asked me to sleep with the officer to get information on Karl Stoltz.<eos> What did you blackmail the officer with, exactly?<eos> I made, um... a sex tape.<eos> Just me sleeping with the officer, and...<eos> Mr. McBride used it to blackmail the officer in order to give us more-- into telling us who Karl Stoltz was.
Lucky guy.<eos> Yeah.<eos> A fella's got to work for something, right?<eos> Did you guys get that radio working yet? Not yet.<eos> Mind if I take a look at it myself?
That's its natural position.<eos> That's enough for now.<eos> Go and move it.<eos> No, I like it like that.<eos> You'll move it tomorrow, promise?
- Yes.<eos> Did you take that magazine out of my room? - What?<eos> - The magazine in your pocket...<eos> - ...this is my magazine.<eos> - No, it's not. I am in room 412.
Do you remember Luc, my personal mover?<eos> Yeah, well, he better still be up here, because if my bed is not back in my room in ten minutes...<eos> Did you change the lock?<eos> It's the same one that's on the door of Nick Farris' office.<eos> I'd like you to pick it.
No way.<eos> - Should we keep it in the car for the Serbs?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I found it.<eos> We'll split it.
- Should we keep it in the car for the Serbs?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I found it.<eos> We'll split it.<eos> - Put it in the car.
He told me I couldn't hide from it.<eos> He called it an unbearable weight.<eos> Who?<eos> Ted Pryce.<eos> He said I couldn't erase it and I couldn't take it back.
Say hi to the jury for us.<eos> I-I can't because we've never met. All right?<eos> Look.<eos> The cop puts cash in the locker.<eos> I pick it up, I leave the drugs.
Where are you getting this?<eos> We tracked your service vehicle.<eos> I...<eos> I haven't used that car for days.<eos> I lent it to...
Let my people do what you've been unable to do.<eos> I just sent you a photo.<eos> Who is this?<eos> Youtellme .<eos> Do you have it?
Yeah, but why was someone driving around with 2 million euros?<eos> Not for fun.<eos> I saw the news.<eos> No one brought up the money.<eos> No one's missing it.
Not for fun.<eos> I saw the news.<eos> No one brought up the money.<eos> No one's missing it.<eos> We don't use the money until it's been exchanged and laundered.
Jørgen Thullander will come up with an estimate.<eos> Yeah, it's a sad day.<eos> I must admit.<eos> You all have worked harder and longer for this business than anyone could ask.<eos> It's you who created it.
Hodgins, I wanted you to take a look at this tissue.<eos> It looks like burn marks, but I haven't seen any other signs of burning in the sludge.<eos> Neither did I on the remains.<eos> Okay, all right. Just leave this with me.<eos> I'll test it for particulates and figure out what left such an isolated mark.
The injury didn't impact Hodgins' spinal reflexes at a sacral level.<eos> He's still sexually capable.<eos> Yeah, everything about him is still capable of it.<eos> It just doesn't make a difference if he's given up.<eos> He can't fix that void, if he doesn't take responsibility for creating it.
And there's no dining room to speak of.<eos> Nor bathrooms.<eos> And I've sold off most of the good shooting and fishing.<eos> Oh, dear. You're really not a salesman.<eos> In fact, the place is in such a state, I'd sooner make a gift of it.
We have to move these pelts fast.<eos> We need to find a buyer in Montreal.<eos> I'm workin' on it. You need to steal the company ledger.<eos> If we don't adjust the numbers<eos> Lord Benton will discover the theft. Bring it to me.
No, but this is pretty damn incriminating.<eos> The day before the murder, our victim got in a shoving match with Judge Caldwell at the courthouse.<eos> Eddie must have connected the Judge to Marco's extortion scheme and gone down there to confront him.<eos> If Eddie threatened to expose the criminal conspiracy, the judge would have a strong motive to kill him.<eos> I-I don't get it.
Because, believe it or not, I don't actually want to kill you, Stefan.<eos> That doesn't make any sense.<eos> Just take my word for it.<eos> I know you don't deserve that mark, but somebody else does.<eos> What if I were to tell you there's a way for me to transfer it to somebody a little bit more deserving?
Four. Three. Two.<eos> Back in the saddle.<eos> Now give it all you've got.<eos> Dig into that part of you that yearns to feel powerful, beautiful and free.<eos> Touch that inner light and let it shine bright.
I thought Rita was a dog walker.<eos> You know, Colton is preaching now.<eos> Yeah, Rita and I, - we watched the video together.<eos> - What did she think?<eos> She loved it.
Someone grab the biker.<eos> Grab the biker.<eos> No, no, no, they haven't picked up the money yet.<eos> Mr. Knowles, we don't recommend that.<eos> We should have our unit search it first.
What? - I need the money first.<eos> We have a man dying in there.<eos> Andreas said he was shot in the chest.<eos> I need the money first.<eos> - Okay, fine, then I'll get it.
Fine. If you don't want to do this anymore, then you can just give up.<eos> But we just received a photo of the man who hit Mia, Alf.<eos> - What?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Jon sent it.
- Seriously, call if you need anything.<eos> - Close the door and let me go home.<eos> - That sofa is totally finished.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> We'll take it out back.
We'll take it out back.<eos> - Don't.<eos> Careful.<eos> - Fuck! I was losing it.<eos> - Do you have it now?
If he delivers, then he can think I'm an idiot all he wants.<eos> - What's up?<eos> What did you find out?<eos> - We're going to live in the house one week each.<eos> - Then we'll sell it.
It's all a carousel they've used to artificially boost their value.<eos> - Why are you telling me this?<eos> - You need to ask about your money.<eos> You can.<eos> And if you don't get it, you can file Energreen for bankruptcy.
Then one year, rumor has it, the husband wakes up one Christmas morning, grabs a large kitchen knife, slices his wife's throat open, stabs his little kids to death, then slits his own wrists. - Huh.<eos> - No motive was ever determined.<eos> God.<eos> Cut to the 1960s.<eos> Woman named Mary Meghan Fisher decided to buy up the place, turned it into an old-school arcade... pinball machines, Skee-Ball, the likes.
He was my cellmate.<eos> This place made him crazy.<eos> He thinks it's cursed. Yeah.<eos> No shit, Sherlock.<eos> Before I left the clink, he gave me the keys to the joint and made me swear to burn it down before it caused any more ruckus.
It's since turned into one of the nicest restaurants in the city.<eos> I know the chef.<eos> He's very good.<eos> I'll have Marcel make a reservation.<eos> You've never had semifreddo until you've had it there.
Bloomberg... it's more appropriate.<eos> We'll stick with that.<eos> Thank you, sir.<eos> I've noticed you always look at that before you leave my office.<eos> Perhaps you find it as fascinating as I do...
Have you seen him before?<eos> Nope.<eos> My mind was dancing in the clouds.<eos> All I know is, I can't live here no more.<eos> Now that I don't owe anymore on the place, maybe I can just rent it.
That there are gaps in my life where I don't know what happened?<eos> That I'm losing my mind?<eos> That I didn't even recognize my own sister?<eos> That I don't know how to control this thing?<eos> I don't know how to stop it?
I don't know how to stop it?<eos> Fine!<eos> Yeah.<eos> Fine.<eos> I acknowledge it.
It was all just Hollywood. Cover ups.<eos> Everything he did, he did for you.<eos> It goes like this.<eos> "I carry your heart with me.<eos> I carry it in my heart.
Everything he did, he did for you.<eos> It goes like this.<eos> "I carry your heart with me.<eos> I carry it in my heart.<eos> I am never without it."
I am never without it."<eos> That's the poem.<eos> What?<eos> It's a poem.<eos> I read it in the prison library. "Easy Comings."
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to be indelicate.<eos> Talking about my cancer isn't indelicate.<eos> Coming here after you fucked my husband, that's indelicate.<eos> Did your daughter like the painting?<eos> She thought it was very generous.
If it comes down to it, don't deal with Dmitri.<eos> Disappear. Or he'll kill you.<eos> Take care of yourself.<eos> You can keep the money.<eos> I don't want it no more.
Take care of yourself.<eos> You can keep the money.<eos> I don't want it no more.<eos> - Pop.<eos> - I don't want it.
He's gonna need it for his fucking lawyers.<eos> Ray.<eos> It was just a situation, you know.<eos> I stole the money from him.<eos> He stole it back from us.
Thank you for bringing me Butch.<eos> It was a pleasure to meet him.<eos> I have a dress... a fancy one.<eos> M-maybe fancy's the wrong word.<eos> I haven't worn it in, like, eight years.
Sit down.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Give me her phone.<eos> - What?<eos> - Her phone, give it to me.
I never thought the regiment would be the thing that would lead me right back where I started.<eos> People always told me growing up that it's never about the destination.<eos> It's about the journey.<eos> But what if the destination is you?<eos> What if it's always you?
You wanna take a shot at me?<eos> Be my guest.<eos> The appointment of a new CEO isn't going to stop the federal government from taking over the plant.<eos> I flew for 13 hours and 35 minutes, if you have a point, it's time.<eos> I needed that bailout money, and I no longer have it.
- We cleaned the place good.<eos> - No, I left it.<eos> It's not here.<eos> We wiped the whole house down.<eos> Do you remember grabbing it?
Fine.<eos> Fine, but I'm going, all right?<eos> Feds are looking for you, not me.<eos> Where is it?<eos> I think I set it on that weird lamp in the living room.
He and another male were spotted around 10:00 p.m. getting into a cab.<eos> The description matches a person of interest in your code name case.<eos> Wait, he was here tonight?<eos> Have you found the cab?<eos> If this is really the guy, why did we burn the house? How come we didn't put surveillance on it?
Perfect, can you see if it's one of yours?<eos> Can you ping that phone for a current location?<eos> You've been a huge help.<eos> I'll call you if there's something else.<eos> Got it.
Yeah, I'd love to.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I, um...<eos> Just checking up on the place.<eos> Sylvie wants it on the market as soon as possible.
- Does he know where you live?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> He gave me this perfume.<eos> It's my favorite.<eos> Adrian normally buys it for me.
You can't ask 'em to pay rent, but you can ask 'em to stick their arm up a cow's address. So, come on.<eos> All right, Carla.<eos> Here we go, girl.<eos> You're gonna be fine.<eos> You don't have to make love to her, just get the calf out of there so we can raise it and slaughter it. Ew!
Come here, buddy.<eos> Rooster, we are the proud parents of a beautiful 85-pound boy.<eos> It was incredible.<eos> That calf was born still.<eos> I gave it CPR and I brought it back to life.
Sold my championship ring.<eos> Figure all the money you gave me over the years, it's the least I could do.<eos> No, thanks.<eos> Uh, Dad, we could use that money.<eos> Yeah, I want you to have it.
- I'm sorry, can I grab your password?<eos> - What?<eos> - Your password.<eos> - What password?<eos> You gave it to the sales rep when you subscribed.
What are you trying to do?<eos> They only got the cameras they could find.<eos> They killed them, but...<eos> Platinum.<eos> Whoever built this house went a long way to protect it.
- They are still working on the bridge.<eos> - Any word from Burlington?<eos> Helicopters are grounded because of the storm.<eos> Their boat is on loan to Shrewsbury.<eos> They can get it back...
Let me guess -- the missing nanny cam?<eos> I was having an affair with Staci.<eos> I only took the nanny cam because she kissed me in front of it.<eos> I forgot the damn thing was there.<eos> Anyway, I was gonna erase it as soon as we got home.
Yep. That's why you're here alone in the middle of the night?<eos> It's just a little hard to get work done at my house right now.<eos> So, once a year, some sort of pollen is released into the air, and for two weeks, Cam has allergy-induced sleep apnea and has to use an apparatus in order to help him breathe. Is it hideous?<eos> Is what hideous?<eos> I barely even noticed it.
- That was a lot.<eos> He's trying to get a Communist girl to kiss him.<eos> We have our own kid problems.<eos> I mean, we had an incident this afternoon during Lily's playdate with Tom, who used to identify as... Tina.<eos> I don't totally get the hand thing, but I like it.
I can't wait to hear what you have to say about this lapse in judgment.<eos> Hey, it's better than what Mom's doing.<eos> She's just using you to yell at us.<eos> I would nip that back talk in the bud.<eos> I can't believe it.
Papers are signed.<eos> It's nice to see that we haven't lost our favourite bar wench.<eos> Yeah, I quit.<eos> I'm gonna need that T-shirt back.<eos> Want me to help you peel it off?
Wynonna Earp, the only woman so bold as to woo a man<eos> - I thought if anyone should have it, it's you.<eos> And exactly what am I to do with it?<eos> What do you usually do with your enemy's horse?<eos> Shoot it, ride it, paint it something other than pink?
Storks are not indigenous<eos> - to this area.<eos> And are silent.<eos> - No. That thing was squawking.<eos> - I mean, you heard it.
Give me the phone!<eos> - Don't touch me.<eos> - They'll find us.<eos> - You want to see Louis?<eos> - OK. I'll keep it.
- Don't touch me.<eos> - They'll find us.<eos> - You want to see Louis?<eos> - OK. I'll keep it.<eos> I'll turn it off.
Get in the car, I said!<eos> Now we're going to settle the account.<eos> The account?<eos> We ran a great risk storing that money.<eos> We exchanged it and took care of it, so we should be compensated.
The broad mandibular arc indicates the victim is male, and based on the shape of the distal tibia, in his late teens.<eos> Probably an undergraduate. Well, I talked to security.<eos> Kids who found the body used a friend's key card to get in, but nobody else opened the door since Friday.<eos> Look at this window.<eos> The, uh, rubber sealant's been peeled off, and someone threaded a wire through there and opened it.
Ah, you know, Scott would do anything for that group.<eos> Maybe that includes buying drugs illegally.<eos> A campus full of geniuses got to be loaded with anti-anxiety meds and dealers.<eos> Sounds kind of pathetic, if you ask me. You get into a top ten university, and singing freaks you out?<eos> Let's see you get up there and try it.
His important news was that William Hull put out a press release earlier today.<eos> The magnate has got his wish.<eos> They found a way to move forward with the project.<eos> How? They settled the air rights problem?<eos> No. They went around it.
You know you can't use any of this as evidence.<eos> I know, but if I'm right, I won't have to.<eos> Because?<eos> Theory of the crimes has been wrong all along.<eos> We've been thinking that Derek O'Neal was killed to protect the building and that Rosalyn Graham was killed to block it.
I know, but if I'm right, I won't have to.<eos> Because?<eos> Theory of the crimes has been wrong all along.<eos> We've been thinking that Derek O'Neal was killed to protect the building and that Rosalyn Graham was killed to block it.<eos> I now believe that both murders were the work of the same killer, who intended to shrink it.
They know where your camp is. It's only a matter of time.<eos> Shite.<eos> Well, I got Robeson's boat stashed at the Fingers.<eos> I heard.<eos> Simcoe thought he lent it to Rogers.
Don't let me stop the poetry.<eos> It wasn't for your entertainment.<eos> Free-styling?<eos> It's one of Nora's favorite poems.<eos> She used to read it to me daily.
It hurts me to see you like this, Stefan.<eos> I mean, it really hurts me.<eos> Because of our connection, I can feel what my targets feel.<eos> Like when Matt set me free at the Armory.<eos> As soon as I touched my sword, I felt what it did to you.
Nazis were handing us our asses.<eos> My pal, Fuzzy Bracowicz, he took a shot in the head just above the right eye.<eos> Part of his scalp went down my shirt.<eos> I tried everything I could. I...<eos> I couldn't get it out.
Oh, fuck.<eos> I'm sorry. It's been a fucked-up week.<eos> Next time, you owe me.<eos> Let's eat.<eos> Worst thing about the food in Saudi... you can't wash it down with alcohol to kill the taste.
- Ah, Frosty the old man. - How are you?<eos> How is it possible that your wife hasn't aged a day since Vienna?<eos> Yet you, Frosty, Jesus.<eos> How's Julia?<eos> Well, she tore out my heart and ran it over with a pickup... that I bought her.
Why were you sleeping in your car earlier?<eos> Cops got nothing.<eos> Oh, you're really not gonna answer me, huh?<eos> But I got the Realtor's report on the house.<eos> 'Cause they legally have to tell you who died in a house before you buy it.
He said you have a form for me to sign?<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> I'm sorry, sir. I thought I had it.<eos> I can't... I can't find the correct form.<eos> It's okay, Ms. Mimi, just mail it to me.
[dramatic music]<eos> Ah!<eos> How you like that, boy?<eos> Look, is this... Is this about the money? The fact is, I-I have some.<eos> Oh, I know you do, 'cause you took it from me.
Mrs. Emily Baker.<eos> I am making a note of that.<eos> "Was very rude to a former Marine who served his country valiantly."<eos> On November 12, 1963, at 1100 hours, I delivered to you a document of the utmost importance for Agent Hosty.<eos> My expectation is that you will deliver it forthwith.
You shouldn't have bothered them.<eos> I want to show you something.<eos> Look. Look right there.<eos> What are you doing with my report card from the second grade?<eos> I carry it around to remind me.
You never would have remembered about Oswald if it weren't for me, okay?<eos> This isn't just about you. It's about me too.<eos> I know from Al's file that Lee keeps his rifle at Ruth Paine's house.<eos> If he doesn't have the gun, he can't shoot Kennedy.<eos> We'll go get it.
No, you can't.<eos> Wait, wait.<eos> I'm so sorry to bother you, ma'am.<eos> I know it's late and you're getting ready for bed, and I'm embarrassed to admit this, but this is all my fault.<eos> You see, Lee picked up a package for me a couple of weeks ago, and he kept telling Jake he'd bring it to him and he never did, and that's why we're so rudely imposing.
Nothing special.<eos> There was a guy from a magazine who came one night.<eos> Ate a meal, wrote about it.<eos> Made my dad real proud.<eos> Well, if the food was good and people liked it, what...?
Not that long.<eos> So, what happens to the restaurant now?<eos> - I mean, you have to do something.<eos> - Like what?<eos> I don't know, but without the money, they'll shut it down.
- Yeah, you were. - Mom.<eos> Look, if this is some sort of apology... it's just a little late.<eos> Just let her talk.<eos> I wish I could go back and change our history, but life doesn't work like that.<eos> Nope, it doesn't.
- Good night.<eos> Robert used to sing that song for the kids, all the time.<eos> Yeah, I know.<eos> Danny told me.<eos> That's why I learned it.
Robert used to sing that song for the kids, all the time.<eos> Yeah, I know.<eos> Danny told me.<eos> That's why I learned it.<eos> And Danny used to sing it to Nolan when he was a baby.
-What's crunchy and smooshy?<eos> -Peanut butter?<eos> Or badly mixed cement?<eos> So we've got meat, cheese, peanut butter or badly mixed cement.<eos> For God's sake, just eat it.
So, the book.<eos> -Yes.<eos> -I go back and forth, back and forth, you know.<eos> I never really wanted to write about myself.<eos> My fields are feminism, environmentalism, and who am I? But if I found someone really like-minded who I could write it with, somebody like yourself...
Your gloggs.<eos> -Kirk-- -Next!<eos> Okay. Your car is done.<eos> I do not guarantee it will make it home, or even out of the gas station.<eos> I bet it will.
Okay. Your car is done.<eos> I do not guarantee it will make it home, or even out of the gas station.<eos> I bet it will.<eos> Come get it now.<eos> It's idling. I'm afraid to turn it off.
They are B-level.<eos> - No. Not this again.<eos> - And the one with the skateboard?<eos> He doesn't ride it.<eos> He just carries it around.
It was a struggle.<eos> Let's put it that way.<eos> I had this notion that somehow my extensive familiarity with Nick Cave, and Radiohead, and a smattering of Stravinsky destined me for success.<eos> So I'll never forget the day that I realized my composition class required composing.<eos> But I did it.
It doesn't even matter now.<eos> - Think I'm going to wait.<eos> - Me, too.<eos> You? I guess. Although I'm afraid this thing is like shoes.<eos> You take it off, you swell up, you can't get it back on again.
They had a business thing fall through.<eos> He was pissed. Wow, your family life's different.<eos> It's yours.<eos> Um... you're giving me a house?<eos> It's yours to use.
There's a picture of you in the attic that Dorian Gray is consulting copyright lawyers about.<eos> Sometimes life forces your hand.<eos> Remember the house your father and I rented every summer?<eos> - Of course.<eos> - Well, I bought it.
So... you need money.<eos> - Yes.<eos> - I'll get the checkbook.<eos> But, Mom, I... I wanna use Luke's franchise money.<eos> He doesn't want it.
-I got it.<eos> Okay. April's mine.<eos> I got it.<eos> --All right.<eos> You got it.
- Go on.<eos> ♪ You are me in pants ♪<eos> ♪ And you are me in a dress ♪<eos> ♪ It fits a bit askance ♪<eos> ♪ I've tried it on, I confess ♪
-What a bore.<eos> - Luke?<eos> - In here!<eos> This shelf is driving me crazy.<eos> It wobbles. I'm just trying to shore it up.
And if my singing is overcooked.<eos> I will never allow that.<eos> Never.<eos> You want to talk about the blood, well, my heart, it has been bleeding for a while.<eos> And I think your voice is the only thing that can save it.
Yes, the music school.<eos> Everyone, this is my maestro, and I trust him in every single way.<eos> Okay, well, here is the program we will be presenting.<eos> Okay.<eos> Yes. I saw it this morning.
So, after the Topographic Tour, Rick Wakeman left the band so he could record his own solo album.<eos> It's probably in here.<eos> Oh, hi. Hi.<eos> Look, now you both have bandages.<eos> Dad said he's wearing it in solidarity.
I want to hear your stories, to... to make up for...<eos> - It's not that easy!<eos> - No. No, it isn't.<eos> Not in this life.<eos> So I must do what I must do to finish it.
I'm ready, John.<eos> Took quite a lot to perfect the high roll.<eos> Did I get it right?<eos> You spent so much money tailoring this dress.<eos> Sure you want me to take it off?
Where did you get this?<eos> It was Bob Paris' getaway cash.<eos> Oh, I... no, I can't do that.<eos> Well, it would help me 'cause I don't know what to do with it.<eos> Look, this money... it doesn't belong to anybody, and who knows how he got it?
It was Bob Paris' getaway cash.<eos> Oh, I... no, I can't do that.<eos> Well, it would help me 'cause I don't know what to do with it.<eos> Look, this money... it doesn't belong to anybody, and who knows how he got it?<eos> And, honestly, I couldn't think of a better use for it than to put it back out in the world through your hands.
I was sewing in there.<eos> You made my room into a sewing room?<eos> No!<eos> I-I-I was just sewing in there.<eos> It doesn't make it a sewing room.
Well, I'll push through it.<eos> And Blake and I will be performing the operation.<eos> Edwards, I need you with Kyle. I'll be...<eos> Blake's assisting?<eos> I need you to monitor the tremor, let us know when we got it.
Blake's assisting?<eos> I need you to monitor the tremor, let us know when we got it.<eos> Well... it's gonna be one hell of a first date.<eos> Her mother really doesn't know? Nope.<eos> That's got top be a lot of work, hiding it for this long.
You know what's real?<eos> I'm real.<eos> Our shop is real.<eos> This life is real!<eos> And you need to start living it. [thumps]
Ah, was I?<eos> You were serving me dinner while the restaurant burned down.<eos> Well, I hope it fared better in your dream than in real life.<eos> It doesn't matter anymore.<eos> I've decided to close it.
- Hi. It's really late.<eos> Is everything okay?<eos> Yeah, I know. No, I know it's late, but there's someone here that can't wait till morning to talk to you.<eos> (cartoonish): Hi, I got a new collar.<eos> Do you like it?
What... no... sure, no, sure I do.<eos> Yes, of course.<eos> Why wouldn't I believe you that you slept with a... (laughing) with a Playboy Bunny?<eos> - She gave me the magazine!<eos> - Okay. Sweetie, she signed it for me.
Yes, of course.<eos> Why wouldn't I believe you that you slept with a... (laughing) with a Playboy Bunny?<eos> - She gave me the magazine!<eos> - Okay. Sweetie, she signed it for me.<eos> And Oscar saw it.
Mmm?<eos> Prepare yourself.<eos> Yeah, okay. Well, I will brace myself with a glass of this rose.<eos> It... it was right here!<eos> I-I put it right here, I swear!
- Pete...<eos> The usual, please.<eos> That states the buyer's intentions, which could include anything<eos> - from rebuilding or remodeling...<eos> - They want to tear it down?
I don't want to be left alone!<eos> I owe you a heap of thanks.<eos> And my life.<eos> Well, keep your life, Doc.<eos> I'd only mess it up.
But, we, uh... We get the Iraqis' money, right?<eos> You don't do this shit for free.<eos> Right, sergeant Harper?<eos> See how the soil won't clot?<eos> No water means it can't form. If it can't form, it can't be fertile.
Protectors of K'un-Lun.<eos> It's not what I thought.<eos> It's not what any of us thought.<eos> But you have a duty now.<eos> And we'll face it together.
No civilised woman would have intentions regarding him.<eos> And you would not need to be wary of me.<eos> We have the same father.<eos> You are in every way an unopened box.<eos> Just when I think it's empty, I hear a tiger roaring inside it.
They were voiceless.<eos> They were hurting.<eos> Well, thank God they had film, and thank God I could do my bit to make our democracy a little more equal.<eos> Creating false stories doesn't make democracy more equal.<eos> It harms it deeply.
This is where I do all my reading.<eos> I don't use the ballroom at all.<eos> You'll have to redo the floors.<eos> Laundry room.<eos> You can hang my underwear on that rack when you're done washing it.
A cookbook, so we can make dinner.<eos> I suppose anything but lamb.<eos> Well, my private library is open to you whenever you'd like.<eos> It's mostly law books, but there are sections on everything from Italian cuisine to the world's most threatening fungus.<eos> I suppose it's not as nice as the libraries you're used to, but...
- Go! ... or I'll punch you in the dick.<eos> Put it down.<eos> Okay, there's a real simple way out of this. - Not now.<eos> - The farm's worth a lot of money.<eos> They just found out it's sitting on top of a massive uranium deposit.
Well, why does the Legion of Doom - want the medallion?<eos> - "Legion of Doom"?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Don't ask.<eos> Well, according to legend, the medallion calls for the spear and basically takes you right to it.
If they think I'm in here, they're gonna send in a SERT team.<eos> Bud.<eos> Back your truck into the loading bay.<eos> Help him load in a freezer. - Why?<eos> - So they think you're in it.
Let them take it.<eos> No speed gun can stop a god.<eos> My guess is the power source is most likely here.<eos> Why there?<eos> Because it's the deepest part of the facility, and if it's as valuable as you say it is, then the deepest recesses of any facility are usually the most secure.
Babe, we're gonna need more wood.<eos> Okay, but first, check out this video.<eos> This bear goes crazy on these guys, and he j... Um, no.<eos> That's not why we come out here.<eos> We come out here to commune with nature, not watch people get eaten by it.
I don't want it to land on my daughter.<eos> We're alone.<eos> You have family in the bloc, don't you?<eos> That hasn't been easy either.<eos> It's been my experience that blood will always rise to the occasion if you give it the chance.
You'd take away my memories of Alice?<eos> Yes. I would free you completely.<eos> No.<eos> You are wiser than you appear.<eos> You would find your way back to sadness, no matter how far you run from it.
- We need to talk.<eos> - Listen, I know what this is about.<eos> You know...<eos> I was silly to think that keeping that note from you would kill the electricity that we have.<eos> If it can survive the socially unacceptable age difference, - then...
Vincent, this is my son.<eos> Listen to me.<eos> I'm gonna find Adam, I'm gonna bring him back to you.<eos> But whoever has him right now is using some very dark magic.<eos> Some very powerful magic, and you have to stay away from it.
I'm sorry.<eos> I didn't mean for her to overhear.<eos> Why are you doing this?<eos> Why are you putting those ideas in my little girl's head?<eos> Because this world is ending, and I don't want you to end with it.
It turned out he had that selfless love.<eos> I did have a snake once.<eos> A Burmese python named Krueger.<eos> Technically, it was Cal's, but Krueger liked me best.<eos> - Did you ever talk to it? - Mmm-hmm.
Mum!<eos> What are you doing?<eos> He's CA.<eos> Grab your stuff.<eos> Culture is difficult to control, and being a Cleverman forces you to be consumed by it.
That wouldn't be helpful.<eos> And Eric O'Bannon?<eos> My guys will take care of it.<eos> Don't touch O'Bannon.<eos> Yeah, I intend to control history, John, not be a victim to it.
Robbie?<eos> I want you to wear this for luck.<eos> Ooh, your sister is on to something.<eos> Ever since the Christmas address, that watch has been more famous than you are.<eos> You should reach for it when you speak.
- It should be there on your shawl.<eos> - It is not.<eos> Nor is it in my jewellery box.<eos> Did you take it?<eos> I was playing with it, but I didn't take it.
And my freckles. I hate my freckles.<eos> And I can't help but think that the other children would like me better if I was pretty.<eos> Fiddlesticks.<eos> You're a vain one and no mistake.<eos> If a rose wasn't beautiful, nobody would want to stop and smell it.
[Vevers] When the coral bleaches, the flesh becomes clear.<eos> And what you're seeing is its skeleton underneath.<eos> So, the bright whites that you see in the pictures... is just the skeletons everywhere.<eos> [Gates] If it's a very clean white look about the coral... it will still be alive.<eos> It's not allowing anything else to grow on it.
Ford always knew where to put the camera.<eos> [man] Suddenly, from behind the clouds, the Japs attack!<eos> [airplanes humming loudly] [gunfire]<eos> His response is purely cinematic.<eos> At that moment, reality comes to him, and he moves to meet it.
Not alone, of course.<eos> None of us makes that journey alone.<eos> You need a great script, and direction and support.<eos> I got all of those things from a single person who none of you would ever know.<eos> But I owe it all...
Here.<eos> Allow me.<eos> I love old things.<eos> Then you're gonna love new English.<eos> When the town fell, we all fell with it.
Yeah, or something like--<eos> Whatev-- There's something inside of her cut.<eos> Now she's cold and I think she has a fever. So I just...<eos> Okay.<eos> Okay, I'll go take a look at it right now. - Thank you.
Thank you for your you, sir.<eos> Come along, come along.<eos> My what?<eos> For your time.<eos> Young lady... you cannot change the past... though I dare say, you might learn something from it.
Time is many things, Hamish, but he isn't money.<eos> Nor is he our enemy, mother.<eos> Where did you come from?<eos> I walked right through the walls.<eos> I may not be able to change the past, but I can learn from it.
I just laid there and cried.<eos> And I didn't know what I was gonna do.<eos> But I knew the time had come for me to leave my daddy's house.<eos> Suddenly, the world got big, and...<eos> It was a long time before I could cut it down to where I could handle it.
What does that mean? They're a bit lost. Going round and round in circles.<eos> You just keep your head, you know.<eos> Yeah. Thanks.<eos> What about her?<eos> Well, if she ever lived in it, she'd be the most beautiful thing the real world ever saw, but...
Not smart.<eos> Made me realize there's two folks in here you care for.<eos> Plates are blurred.<eos> Closer traffic cam got knocked out.<eos> Damn SUV passed right under it.
She was just another poor, worthless bitch from the Polo Grounds.<eos> So that's why you became a cop?<eos> I apply foot to ass, and match lead for lead.<eos> I put murderers in handcuffs.<eos> I don't just seek justice, I stalk it.
Meet mankind's greatest hope.<eos> Right now I have to get you and your sister to Odessa.<eos> Destiny, while marching ever in our direction, can be rerouted by the choices we make.<eos> The fate of the entire world depends on us getting this right tonight.<eos> What if I don't have the strength? Then I suggest you find it, or that brother that's been looking for you, when the world ends, he's gonna burn right along with it.
Only the ones with parties.<eos> _ _ _<eos> It has begun.<eos> Had to go all the way to Olney, but I found white willow bark.<eos> Afraid it won't do any good now.
- No contact for three months.<eos> - Well, let's find her fast.<eos> This spoils my experience of nature.<eos> - You hate nature.<eos> - Well, I would like it a lot more if there were fewer dead people in it.
Yeah.<eos> And that snails have teeth.<eos> Uh-oh. Rubber's about to hit the road.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Uh, now that the field is clear, um... They'll use the limpet teeth to protect you in case the bomb goes off ... when they yank you off of it.
We do not support the Sons of the Harpy.<eos> Fine, fine, but you will cut it off all the same.<eos> I do hope you accept, my friends.<eos> You will not receive a better offer.<eos> Let us sail on the tide of freedom instead of being drowned by it.
Yeah, yeah...<eos> - What makes Marseille great...<eos> - Can't you squeeze your own juice?<eos> What makes Marseille great is that the people here hate it when you talk about their city in a certain way.<eos> But if you spoke about it like any normal city, without the football, the violence or the drugs... they'd hate it.
You think this is cute, don't you?<eos> You think there's a real connection there.<eos> So you feed it, you dress it up.<eos> But a cat doesn't care if you live or die as long as someone gives it Friskies twice a day.
I'm just asking you that when you think back On these unfortunate events -<eos> Without hiding anything.<eos> But also without hate.<eos> You're going to talk about a man who has loved passionately, But without wisdom.<eos> A man not susceptible to jealousy, but once instigated by it, was pulled along to its outermost limits.
Other than the odd saliva extraction, he's unharmed.<eos> And the others in the containment centers?<eos> What about them?<eos> I'm a man of science, Waruu.<eos> I've taken Darwin's theory of natural selection and given it a reboot.
There's a wedding tomorrow.<eos> Girls love weddings.<eos> So invite her to the wedding, right?<eos> You get her to the wedding, you let the music play, let all the romance take over.<eos> You grab her hand like this and you give it a little kiss.
Yes.<eos> Yes.<eos> Let it speak to you.<eos> Give it your strength.<eos> Give it your hope.
Thank you for answering my question.<eos> Funny, it sounded like a demand.<eos> Not that question.<eos> But whether your Machine knows the password to deploy the virus.<eos> From the very beginning, when you crippled your Machine, you denied it the same power that you enjoy.
I got to admit... it's not what I'd hoped for.<eos> I really thought it'd be ATCU proper who showed up at the compound.<eos> Didn't expect you.<eos> I'm working with the ATCU.<eos> You mean keeping S.H.I.E.L.D. alive within it.
Oh, let this be your confession.<eos> - Temptation was my burden.<eos> - Hmm, what kind of temptation?<eos> - Of the flesh. - Uh-huh.<eos> Well, that's not a sin unless you follow through on it.
That was strange.<eos> I was awake but dreaming.<eos> I was here but-but not here.<eos> In the darkness, lost I heard your voice.<eos> I followed it.
Medical issues.<eos> Do you know how he did it?<eos> He put the recorder in the cup to amplify my voice.<eos> It didn't just amplify your voice.<eos> It gave it direction.
You wanted to believe that the army had straightened me out.<eos> Look. I'm your brother, but I'm not built like you.<eos> I didn't take to the military like you did.<eos> You saw the world as something to be fixed.<eos> I only saw it as broken, so I made sure I had enough to survive in it.
Its opposite is light and hope, la Luz Del Alma, light of the soul.<eos> If you can channel la Luz Del Alma, you will be able to repel Darhk's magic.<eos> Then that is what I'm here to learn.<eos> I wish it were just that easy.<eos> If the darkness inside you outweighs the light, instead of repelling Darhk's magic, you will end up fueling it.
Time and man, we grew up together.<eos> We depend on each other.<eos> Impossible.<eos> Time is older than man, and infinite.<eos> But in the here and now, we help it think.
But no, you slunk away in the middle of night with your tail tucked between your legs... for him.<eos> It's called loyalty.<eos> Wouldn't expect you to understand the concept.<eos> Well, that died along with the seven billion.<eos> How are you supposed to save the future if you can't survive it?
- Thank you.<eos> Most priests would have found something kind to say about the man himself, but...<eos> I said he came to church.<eos> Nothing shines up a halo faster than a death, Matthew.<eos> But funerals are for the living... and revising history... only dilutes the lessons we should learn from it.
She's creating friction, and at that vibration and speed...<eos> - What?<eos> - Complete chaos.<eos> She could destroy that whole bridge.<eos> And everyone on it.
Shit, I make stools, for Christ's sake.<eos> But I came here today because I love Venice just as much as you do.<eos> This is a new beginning.<eos> A new chapter for us.<eos> A chance for us to, not forget our past, but to... to build on it.
(gasping) You're a disgrace.<eos> An embarrassment to anybody who ever knew you, who ever cared about you.<eos> Tell me the target.<eos> Screw you!<eos> (yells) How can you even admit the truth when you won't even face it yourself?
I'll give you a head start.<eos> I'll close my eyes and I'll count to ten.<eos> I will make no attempt to follow you but, starting now, all of you, everywhere, pack your bags and get off of this planet.<eos> Are you declaring war on us?<eos> I am drawing a line, and I'm suggesting you step back from it with awesome speed.
...do you run over an old lady, or do you turn the wheel and crash yourself into a wall?<eos> How old is the old lady?<eos> Seventy-six... No, seventy-two.<eos> How's her health?<eos> -You know, it's been better. -Mmm-hmm.
You got about seven minutes until HRT breaks down that door.<eos> Goodbye.<eos> I-I just... I just want to be in my daughter's life.<eos> Well, that's the thing about family...<eos> You don't get to choose when you want to be a part of it.
Do you recall a bird-seller who had a store off the back of Fashion Street.<eos> - I do. I remember him. - He was a gyppy.<eos> Made great play of it, his Balkan Romani roots.<eos> "Goluba", was the word he used for a dove.<eos> He makes his mother's name English, redefines himself with it.
- You're going back to town ?<eos> !<eos> That's crazy!<eos> - Someone has to stop them.<eos> Otherwise we will lose the whole city and all the people in it.
I'm flattered, though.<eos> That was one good-looking man.<eos> Rise and shine, Major Bummer.<eos> What do you think of my latest business venture?<eos> Your girlfriend gives it her old zombie stamp of approval.
Never mind that for now.<eos> You get home.<eos> Matthew, I was afraid.<eos> Me and you both, Darling.<eos> I tell ya, this town, the things that I've seen within it today... me and you've got to get this thing finished and ourselves done with this place for all time.
Yeah.<eos> Doctors, teachers, about a dozen vets.<eos> Nothing but alpha males.<eos> Hey, I cleaned off the watch and I found an engraving.<eos> I had to give it an acid wash, but at least now you can read it.
If they knew my Uncle Felix had it, then they would know he gave it to me.<eos> And if they knew he gave it to me, then...<eos> Stop, stop.<eos> Let them find the chest.<eos> If they know about it, they'll think we took the books someplace else.
Then Dean Winchester's.<eos> Then Amara's, then Lucifer's.<eos> A few weeks ago, you were cleaning these floors... with your tongue.<eos> We could retake Hell, but why bother?<eos> The world's ending, and this time... Hell's ending with it.
- There's three of us.<eos> --...our executioner.<eos> Listen to the mad words of a wise man.<eos> "What if a demon crept after you one night, in your loneliest...<eos> The eternal hourglass of existence is turned upside down again and again, and you with it, too."
They need gas masks.<eos> You ready?<eos> Is it painless?<eos> It's quick.<eos> "The eternal hourglass of existence is turned upside down again and again, and you with it, too.
Put that down!<eos> This is my house!<eos> This is my house!<eos> I know.<eos> This place and everything in it, it's all yours.
Martinez was right.<eos> We all need a method.<eos> Something to cling to when the shit around us gets so deep, we might go under.<eos> Something to guide us home when we feel we've lost our way.<eos> If we're lucky, someone gives us a method and we follow it.
That's all. But I do intend to fight back, especially since the people are with me.<eos> She's backed up by Serge Vauban's firepower.<eos> The only power Vauban has, is the love for his son.<eos> And justice doesn't care about love, does it?<eos> Although sometimes it doesn't care about truth, either.
I thought it was sheep. So, you admit it.<eos> So... what's new?<eos> Been spending all my time at the old McConnell ranch.<eos> Some Hollywood dipshit bought it.<eos> Let his eight-year-old rename it.
I like seeing you laugh.<eos> Holy fuck, Vilde...<eos> Nagging me so fucking much about that kose group stuff.<eos> The kose group? ! ?<eos> I had completely forgotten about it! Yeah.
I'm "hangry" right now, and I would love to get some food.<eos> Find me the closest taco shop.<eos> Here's what I could find on how to make taco shells.<eos> No, not a recipe for taco shells.<eos> Now, not only does the machine talk to you, but you can talk to it.
For Azeroth!<eos> For the Alliance!<eos> You will travel far, my little Go'el.<eos> My world may be lost, but this is your world now.<eos> Take what you need from it.
Oh, I was always taught to deny mine, which I did and still do.<eos> And that makes me envy you.<eos> Mm-hmm.<eos> See, your anger is still right up here on the surface, where you can look it in the face.<eos> Make friends with it, honey.
What's wrong with his words?<eos> He wanted things for his family, for himself.<eos> He was a dreamer, Owen.<eos> Yes, he was.<eos> Dreamed of the sea and never got to sail it because of men like them.
All right. You think we just warehouse it on the books?<eos> No.<eos> We just repackage it with a bunch of other shit that didn't sell and put it into a CDO.<eos> - This is where we take a bunch of B's, BB's and BBB's that haven't sold, and we put them in a pile.<eos> And when the pile gets large enough, the whole thing is suddenly considered diversified and the whores at the rating agency give it a 92%-93% AAA rating, no questions asked.
Goodbye, Nimish.<eos> - Your Highness.<eos> - Welcome.<eos> In this hand, I'm nothing but putty.<eos> If you like it, you should put a ring on it.
NICK: And Reyes probably was killed.<eos> The email on his computer was bait.<eos> Whoever this is wanted to see if we were on Reyes' trail.<eos> We're burned.<eos> Could you track it to our guy's location?
Well, maybe you can move on.<eos> I can't exist anywhere without you.<eos> So, I wanted to ask you to join me here.<eos> You'd have to leave your other world behind.<eos> Stop breathing in it, like I did.
His head was no match for that concrete.<eos> I just remembered there was a suicide in my building last night, a woman slit her throat.<eos> I hope they find someone to cover his work.<eos> Even before the demise, humankind knew the importance of space exploration.<eos> As the Collective, we prioritize it and perfect it.
- Henry.<eos> Have you ever heard... of a Glyptapanteles?<eos> What the fuck does this have to do with anything...<eos> A horrifyingly... disingenuous wasp... that lays its eggs... into an unsuspecting caterpillar.<eos> And with the help of a poly-DNA virus, it can not only disable... the caterpillar's immune system, but it can control its motor skills while its larvae feed on it.
Escaped with the Darkspore.<eos> - Then we failed.<eos> It were not wrong to trust or to hope.<eos> It was all for nothing.<eos> If we are not fighting this darkness, we are becoming a part of it.
- No.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> It's quite good.<eos> But here's the thing... the crew's banner is a sacred thing.<eos> It must simultaneously strike fear in the hearts of hardened men while inspiring and unifying all those who sail under it.
The banner?<eos> What's the matter with the banner?<eos> Well, it's new.<eos> Lightly traveled.<eos> What do you think is wrong with it?
You and I know it's a big lie.<eos> Lies are necessary... when the truth is too difficult to believe. Right?<eos> It wasn't a fucking surrender.<eos> Pablo wasn't succumbing to justice.<eos> He was escaping it. And all anyone could do was watch.
For it leaves your heart at the mercy of another.<eos> You're so unprotected.<eos> We're all awkward in love.<eos> Mine has always gone awry.<eos> When I've opened myself to it in the past, it's left me damaged.
This is about flow, so...<eos> He looks so normal.<eos> I thought we agreed that we wouldn't judge him until we had definitive proof.<eos> What about the file?<eos> It said he murdered his wife.
He cannot stay here.<eos> Heads, we go back for the body.<eos> Your DNA is under his nails, on his skin, so the only way to get rid of it is to burn the body.<eos> We go back for the body and then what?<eos> We do what with it?
Done.<eos> 33 seconds.<eos> Okay, that'll be our baseline.<eos> You know, I don't want to tell you how to do your job, but when a mouse completes a maze, it gets a food pellet.<eos> It also gets its brain plucked out with tweezers.
A lie from the lips of Stannis Baratheon.<eos> He wants the throne, but his brother's children stand in his way.<eos> So he claims they are not his brother's.<eos> That filth.<eos> There is not one shred of truth to it.
It's a valuable antique.<eos> What do you mean it doesn't belong to you?<eos> I'll pay 900 bucks for this.<eos> - Cash on the barrel.<eos> - I don't know. I hate to part with it.
Tell me about you.<eos> What does the virgin Oracle want?<eos> Relax.<eos> Pleasure... is as fleeting as birdsong.<eos> When it comes, you must surrender to it.
Thea knows nothing about Sara.<eos> And she never will.<eos> That's where you're wrong.<eos> I know her.<eos> She'll get to the truth no matter how well you think you're hiding it.
The sniper knew when Jeremy Fritz would be at that exact spot.<eos> All the other shootings were just to throw us off.<eos> Fritz was the sniper's primary target.<eos> If you'll let me, I'd like to take a look at your hand.<eos> I can help it feel better.
My girlfriend, she wants to leave.<eos> She called me a loser last night.<eos> Her ex is back in town, he's a bouncer.<eos> I figured she sees me in the hood, she's gotta take me seriously.<eos> Did you ransack my place looking for it?
That's not an answer.<eos> You catch on quick.<eos> You're going to help me?<eos> No, I'm gonna train you.<eos> How to control your gift, make it work for you... use it, and how to fight.
He saw the traveler bleeding in the road and he stopped to aid him without thinking of the circumstance or the difficulty it might bring him.<eos> The Samaritan tended to the traveler's wounds, applying oil and wine.<eos> And he carried him to an inn, gave him all the money he had for the owner to take care of the traveler, as the Samaritan, he... continued on his journey.<eos> He did this simply because the traveler was his neighbor.<eos> He loved his city and all the people in it.
More than a valiant last stand.<eos> We need a strategy.<eos> A little help please.<eos> It's a hell of a time for your machine to go on the fritz, Harold.<eos> Give it a second.
Or almost everything.<eos> I'm afraid you missed it.<eos> We need a strategy. A little help please.<eos> It's a hell of a time for your machine to go on the fritz, Harold.<eos> Give it a second, it's got a lot on its mind.
It's a hell of a time for your machine to go on the fritz, Harold. Give it a second.<eos> It's got a lot on its mind.<eos> We need a strategy. A little help please.<eos> It's a hell of a time for your machine to go on the fritz, Harold.<eos> Give it a second.
Oh, my God!<eos> You need to get out of here right now.<eos> Oh, my... What are you doing here?<eos> What am I doing here?<eos> I was pressing the flesh with some council members, and I see a figure sneaking along in the shadows, and I followed it, and here you are.
It was never my intention that you made her your accomplice.<eos> You weren't there.<eos> No... but you could have corrupted her timeline and prevented her from leaving the message, which starts our entire investigation.<eos> Time is cruel, Mr. Cole.<eos> We are risking everything by toying with it, taunting it.
Not our addictions.<eos> Not the toxins in our food.<eos> Those only paralyze us.<eos> Fear is what consumes us.<eos> It's why we go into the dark, cold place.
No, it is raw and authentic, and it is...<eos> Full of drugs.<eos> How about for tonight you forget you're a cop?<eos> Can I be a cop again?<eos> They say memories make us who we are, that the past defines us, but we can't forget to grow, evolve, because sometimes a memory can be so powerful that we get stuck in it, frozen in a moment.
_<eos> _<eos> How are you?<eos> Time isn't perfect.<eos> Yet I'm envious how most of you seem to defy it.
Please listen to me. We need to talk.<eos> Well, maybe you call my office in the morning.<eos> There is no time.<eos> If you don't help me, Cole will die. And I won't let that happen.<eos> Time, it's going to take what it's owed.
We may need a Russian to help us find out.<eos> Don't reckon they'll be happy to see any of us back in there.<eos> How important is this bag anyway?<eos> I must have it!<eos> It is sentimental.
I'm gonna start calling you the milkman, milkman.<eos> Carol.<eos> With all due respect to the milkman here, who definitely deserves all this praise for basically just standing around, I found this thing, so it'll be my call what happens with it. Okay, Todd?<eos> No, no, no, no, no.<eos> Phil, just because you found the cow doesn't give you the right to decide what we do with it.
I never should've let you come here tonight.<eos> I didn't- - I didn't realize--<eos> Don't say that.<eos> I wanted to.<eos> You have no idea how much this family means to me... how much I want to be a part of it, but--but never am.
You're still on mission?<eos> I wish we never triggered that beacon.<eos> I was out, walking a new path with you.<eos> You can't always run from your past.<eos> Sometimes you have to confront it head on. Risk everything for a new future.
The wold won't stop because of you.<eos> You Have a carefully look<eos> These are the treasures from the tomb of Empress Dowger Cixi.<eos> Mojin Xiaoweis risked their lives to dig out this pearl out of her mouth.<eos> It absorbed the essence of the nature to preserve her body from decay.
- ♪ Our thinking' is crazy ♪ - ♪ Too slow ♪<eos> ♪ Where am I going?<eos> Or what am I doing? ♪<eos> ♪ I don't know, I don't know ♪<eos> As the civil rights movement really swung into high gear, she swung into high gear with it.
I'm dying to know, too, Spencer. But I've never made it inside.<eos> It's too far to make it back to your room.<eos> What happens if you don't make it back in time?<eos> It leaves you for days without food or water.<eos> It blasts the siren until you'd rather die than listen to it one more second.
Aren't they cute?<eos> Cute as a mute.<eos> That's a thing.<eos> People-people say that.<eos> Love is never what you think it's gonna be, is it?
Oh, you really do have exquisite hands, Olivia.<eos> She's damn lucky to have climbed out of this gene pool.<eos> I've always been terrified the day would come when you would find me and want answers, but I...<eos> I don't deal with fear at all well.<eos> I... I run away from it.
To me, faith is a word that describes something you know isn't real, but you wish it was.<eos> Faith is a sad word, in a way.<eos> What do you believe in?<eos> I believe in the world, and all its hot mess.<eos> The gift of being upir is you get to live in it for a very long time.
Yeah, you said you wanted to make a change.<eos> You know how much I value you.<eos> I've made that clear on... numerous occasions, sometimes embarrassingly so.<eos> You've been a good friend and a good partner.<eos> It was you, in fact, that helped me understand the concept of partnership, the value of it.
It's only happening because someone means it to.<eos> If you're pulling the strings, Luthor...<eos> Again, you misread me.<eos> I never really cared for power.<eos> I walked away from it.
Lee... you think I wanted things to go the way they did?<eos> - I had to play her game. - I know.<eos> Uh, forget about Barbara.<eos> Most people fight their dark side.<eos> Lately, you find ways to give in to it.
Look, I'm sorry to drop by unannounced.<eos> Just... so hard to talk around the office these days.<eos> Tell me about it.<eos> I saw you today staring into your coffee mug for a minute, straight.<eos> You know I talk to it sometimes, and I beg it to wake me up.
The audience!<eos> Without it, nothing lives!<eos> Not necessarily.<eos> Without an audience... we're in the... secret of music.<eos> Alone with it, in all its mystery.
You don't just... just, you know, do a couple Google searches, kick back some anti-depressants, and hope for the best.<eos> You actually have to know the person's medical history, their family history, you know, what kind of...<eos> So, you don't support this kind of psychiatric vigilantism?<eos> No, I don't.<eos> I understand it, and I sympathize with it.
Nice.<eos> In two years, we'll have cameras on every floor.<eos> This is Betsy.<eos> It's my mother's name.<eos> I love this thing, so I gave it a name.
You can't just leave someone with a bonsai and orchid, and put all this pressure on them.<eos> You let the orchid die, too?<eos> I watered it every day.<eos> Well, Lori, you're not supposed to water it every day.<eos> Well, I watered it the right amount, okay?
But not always of its own accord, eh?<eos> Sir?<eos> This city, Mr Marlott, dragged kicking and screaming like a raucous infant towards a better future.<eos> One way or another.<eos> Do well by me, and... you'll be assured a part in it.
You're still weak.<eos> You're pathetic and afraid.<eos> You can punch that dome as many times as you need to,<eos> Junior.<eos> You're back under it.
It's begun.<eos> The dome's surface is calcifying.<eos> Soon every living thing won't be able to breathe unless I can bring down the dome with Joe's help. I don't understand.<eos> How is what's happening to the dome making you weaker?<eos> Because I'm connected to it.
You still won't take me with you.<eos> You gad about while I trudge through the centuries, day by day, hour by hour.<eos> Do you ever think or care what happens after you've flown away?<eos> I live in the world you leave behind.<eos> Because you abandoned me to it.
- Honey, can you just run down?<eos> They're under the sink in the kitchen.<eos> I remember the day Neil left me.<eos> I went outside on my lawn and I sat there until the sprinklers turned on.<eos> The whole fucking world looked like all the green went out of it.
I thought you were the leader.<eos> Yes, but sometimes even I need a little help.<eos> I have an idea.<eos> But you have to really listen.<eos> And give it a chance.
Only a human hand can build a fire and tend a flame.<eos> Control is all.<eos> There is one power above all others, a divine power that comes with the greatest of responsibilities... That of life and death.<eos> The essence in all things is palpable to you.<eos> With it, you can give life or snatch it away.
But I know now that was a false glimmer.<eos> I'm used to those-- they happen all the time in the desert-- but this one got to me.<eos> And here's the thing, this death, this end of me is exactly what should have happened.<eos> I wanted the darkness.<eos> I fucking asked for it.
He drank too much.<eos> Most notably, he was weak.<eos> His instincts left a lotto be desired.<eos> Oh, I despise people like that.<eos> In fact, I felt the world was a little better off knowing he wasn't in it anymore.
[chuckles] I thought your mother was going to feed me to the boars.<eos> - I remember that axe. - Yeah, you used it as a paperweight.<eos> [stammers] Look, about the horn, Dad...<eos> Heather told me her father gave it to her.<eos> But it has your seal on it.
Can you hear me?<eos> It's really important you wake up.<eos> I need to talk to you.<eos> Listen to my voice.<eos> Follow it to the surface.
Yeah, got it.<eos> You're about to do your first on-air sit down, right? Yeah.<eos> Bethany Snow?<eos> Ten'll get you twenty, she brings up Sara and her sister.<eos> Alex, all due respect, I don't think that people care about my friendship with Laurel Lance and an eight-year-old scandal when the city is disintegrating and there are masked armed men helping it.
I'm trying to protect your train.<eos> I don't put much faith in the government's idea of protection.<eos> I read your file.<eos> Your parents were doctors who developed vaccines against bio-weapons. They worked for the government.<eos> They didn't see it as the enemy.
No, she doesn't, she ended it.<eos> Because she felt you chose Superman over her. She was tired of coming in second.<eos> Look, I don't know anything about romantic love.<eos> I have not had the best luck with it.<eos> But if I ever really had it, I think I'd fight for it.
Yeah, sure, I'll call a guy.<eos> I know someone.<eos> You do?<eos> Yes. You forget where I live.<eos> Actually, I don't... you live on the Island of Misfit Toys, filled with people running away from the government, not those in it.
And why?<eos> Because at the critical tipping point, one tragically quixotic megalomaniac cannibalized humanity of the very minds that might have been its salvation.<eos> You see, if you were a betting man, you would understand that now trumps later every time.<eos> The future is a sucker's bet-- a maybe, a contingency, a "What if?"<eos> The only thing that is real is the present, and you've plundered it-- robbed it of the very geniuses that might have averted the dystopia you so fear.
Yes?<eos> What does music mean to you?<eos> It's... it's my life. It's what I...<eos> It's what I think about all the time.<eos> I wake up with it. I go to sleep with it.
But they won't find out.<eos> Not if you don't say anything.<eos> How long did you really think you were gonna keep this a secret?<eos> You mean without your help?<eos> Or with it?
- Hello. - Yes. Yeah.<eos> - Boy, it's a hot one, isn't it?<eos> - Did you see anything?<eos> Okay, I'm just gonna come on out and tell you what you saw.<eos> I took a CPR dummy, and I dressed it up to look like Gordon, and I talk to it, and I do other stuff with it, and we're probably gonna need a new CPR dummy.
These stones, it seems, can only be brandished by beings of extraordinary strength.<eos> Observe.<eos> These carriers can use the Stone to mow down entire civilizations like wheat in a field.<eos> There's a little pee coming out of me right now.<eos> Once, for a moment, a group was able to share the energy amongst themselves, but even they were quickly destroyed by it.
Personally, I prefer the term "labisian."<eos> We should talk about that shirt.<eos> Okay.<eos> I love this shirt.<eos> I know, but it's time to give it a little break.
Balance of probability.<eos> Not that you've ever spoken to a woman with short hair, or, you know, any woman.<eos> Stains show he's out of condition. He's sentimental because the hat has been repaired, three, four...<eos> Five times. Very neatly.<eos> The cost of the repairs exceeds the cost of the hat, so he's mawkishly attached to it.
- A love thtory about...<eos> - It's about covering.<eos> Covering up who you really are.<eos> And isn't that the scariest thing of all?<eos> That's why I'm going to reinvent this entire production and cover it with a postmodern face.
I know I'm not good enough for you.<eos> But I'm not gonna spend my entire life proving that I am.<eos> You're a coward, you know that?<eos> You don't fight for love.<eos> You're terrified of it!
It's like a Rubik's Cube.<eos> I have a Marianne side.<eos> Oh. - Unpredictable, impetuous...<eos> - Yes. ...irrational sometimes.<eos> You have appealed to that side and I will indulge it this one last time, because...
For King Horik and Jarl Borg have agreed to join us.<eos> And perhaps we will not have to return so quickly, but stay in their land for a while, explore it, maybe even winter there.<eos> Who knows?<eos> But, I tell you, these are interesting times.<eos> The world is changing and we must change with it.
Kill me too.<eos> Do you think I can not bear to see blood?<eos> Do you think I'm weak?<eos> I would like to see your blood, your brain lying there on the table! See all your sex swimming in blood as my little bird!<eos> You think I'm weak! You think I love you my womb longed for your seed. Do you think I want to wear your brood over my heart close it with my blood and give it your name?
You're certainly right, Mother.<eos> I certainly can't have children at my age.<eos> It certainly stops with us.<eos> People like Mathias and me we keep telling ourselves that none of this matters, that... childhood is just, a human invention. It's not... God's invention.<eos> There's nothing natural about it... and we should just let it all go.
- Should we worry about him? - What's that?<eos> Should we worry about him comin' back, or I don't know...<eos> No, he's just... he's just weird.<eos> But I'm bringing my axe.<eos> And I'm gonna sleep with it in case your fuckin' dinner guest wants to come back for... dessert or something.
You want your ego stroked.<eos> No, no, no. It's just that I'm feeling pretty rusty right now...<eos> No, you're feeling pretty sorry for yourself about now.<eos> And that's a waste of time, because this is life, Hank.<eos> You know, shit comes flying at you, and you gotta deal with it.
No, no, no. It's just that I'm feeling pretty rusty right now...<eos> No, you're feeling pretty sorry for yourself about now.<eos> And that's a waste of time, because this is life, Hank.<eos> You know, shit comes flying at you, and you gotta deal with it.<eos> That's what defines you, how you deal with it.
Cut up some firewood.<eos> I'm sorry about last week.<eos> You' right that I shouldn't have suggested something I didn't like.<eos> I never gave it another thought.<eos> Well, I did and I realized that Freddy's original idea was the best, but I didn't do it justice.
I chose the poppy, and I portrayed its stages and its evolution.<eos> I was also interested in its contradictions, its beauty and its ugliness<eos> I used needle-painting techniques to illustrate the delicacy of its youth.<eos> I made this one with cotton thread.<eos> When it fades, it exudes latex, which is used to make morphine, a protection against the shame of its rapid decline.
Well, I should know every painting.<eos> Well, you seem to know quite a lot, at least about this one.<eos> I try to soak it all in while I can.<eos> All the history.<eos> Presidents who obsess over history obsess about their place in it,
But I need a rest.<eos> I told you that terrible things happen to anyone who sets foot on that island.<eos> We thought you were just trying to scare us!<eos> I knew there was something wrong with that island.<eos> There is a darkness hidden beneath it and I think the people in this town know about it.
Not anymore.<eos> There is no God.<eos> Certainly not with that attitude.<eos> God gave you purpose -<eos> Not only to create art, but to become it.
Meat to him.<eos> Prey.<eos> This kind of psychosis doesn't just slip through the system.<eos> Somewhere, someone would have noticed this.<eos> If it is psychosis, he got inside of it somehow, tamed it, made a suit out of it.
She has.<eos> You talking about Elena?<eos> She practically got herself killed to prove a point today.<eos> You remember the vampire ripper Jesse?<eos> When he attacked me, Elena had to kill him, but if there was the slightest chance that there was another way to stop him, she would have taken it.
What?<eos> Hmm? No.<eos> Nothing. I just, uh-- I just remembered that Stefan asked me to help him bring some firewood in, so I'll be right back.<eos> What?<eos> What are we gonna do about the other side slipping off into oblivion and you with it?
We have to be out of here right after finals, which I might skip due to the potential extinction of magic in the place where I was spending my summer break.<eos> Right, but I think the other side falling apart is slightly more pressing than a late housing fee.<eos> There is no spell.<eos> I made it up.<eos> The other side is collapsing, and everyone in it, including me, is going away for good.
I'm sorry, but we need to make the doppelganger blood useless.<eos> One of you needs to die.<eos> Luke, the spell's started.<eos> The spell will continue to unravel spirit magic as it spreads.<eos> The other side is collapsing, and everyone in it, including me, is going away for good.
It's more than just knowing the spell.<eos> Markos was able to come back because dozens of travelers were willing to sacrifice themselves in order to overwhelm me.<eos> I doubt they'll be willing to do that for a bunch of supernatural strangers.<eos> You know who needs motivation?<eos> You need motivation because if the other side goes away, everyone we know there, including you, goes away with it.
What's that you have?<eos> A gold coin.<eos> From England.<eos> You see?<eos> It even has King Aelle's face upon it.
Cold.<eos> It'll get worse.<eos> Keep moving.<eos> Alan, if this doesn't work...<eos> If this doesn't work, we burn the base to the ground with everyone in it.
That's terrible.<eos> No wonder they're pissed about displaying their ancestors.<eos> "The Anubis further confessed<eos> "that it was his intention to steal the mummy<eos> "and give it a ceremonial burial.
Is everything okay?<eos> You bring Rebecca's case file?<eos> No.<eos> No, I left it at my place.<eos> We were thinking of using it to track her path to the dungeon using an old map.
If that gun is sitting in an evidence room, how was it used to kill our vic?<eos> My mother is definitely serious about this divorce thing.<eos> Okay.<eos> She's serious today.<eos> Danny, give her a couple days to think about it, you know, let it sink in...
We want this buried, not shared.<eos> Show some respect for your fucking godfather.<eos> So you don't care if you go back to prison?<eos> Better to lose favor in the eyes of man than in the eyes of the Lord.<eos> It's like you said, a man who knows his calling must do everything in his power to live up to it.
I think if we really want to make this work, we have to be honest with each other.<eos> About everything, including Vincent.<eos> Cat, I don't expect you to suddenly stop caring about him.<eos> You have history together, we all do.<eos> But you can't just keep avoiding it.
"miss jenny" steal my gun...<eos> Which I take it, you don't.<eos> ...What I believe is that<eos> A lot of people like you are willing to pay six, Sometimes seven figures for what they believe.<eos> And since you do believe in this coin, And if you do manage to actually get ahold of it, How do you plan on keeping it from affecting...
So, again, your alibi is a mysterious stranger<eos> Handed you the gun, made you put your prints on it, Robbed the store, and then hid the gun In your underpants.
It is. Nobody wants to live here anymore.<eos> And after two terrorist attacks, who can blame them?<eos> This city still needs saving.<eos> And that is my vision for this company.<eos> To not only see it rise from the ashes, but to take this city with it to that new horizon.
Lucy is suffering from delusional disorder.<eos> It's a psychiatric condition in which a patient holds a fixed delusion, but has no other obvious problems with thought or mood.<eos> I decided to drop the case during the diaper change.<eos> Are you sure we're doing the right thing by giving the doll back to her?<eos> Taking it away now would only worsen her mental state.

- How do you know that?<eos> Because I was there when Shana-slash-A was killed.<eos> Look...<eos> Spencer was right.<eos> It's one thing not to contradict Ali's story and it's another to add to it.
But when this strange-looking little one looked at me, it was the first time I had ever felt unconditional love.<eos> I knew, after her first performance, that she was a keeper.<eos> My collection grew.<eos> I took great pride in mothering my troupe.<eos> Most of them knew nothing of the world, save for how to survive in it.
He trusts the Latin and offers me silence.<eos> Whatever they found in Kochkor was of no consequence.<eos> He doesn't want to burden you with trivialities.<eos> He doesn't trust me with the truth.<eos> And what would you do with it, Jingim?
Just figuring that out now?<eos> I was fine with it before exams, but now that everyone else in our class is locked away in their apartments, studying, we're falling behind, working as free labor.<eos> You know who doesn't care about exams?<eos> This guy. 'Cause I got...<eos> Mention the trophy again, and I'll bash your face in with it.
After you.<eos> What can we do for you?<eos> What's going on, Rebecca?<eos> I went to check on the windmill and someone had cut it down.<eos> I kept searching for it, and found it here.
You know, for storing data.<eos> In this case, it's the storage of recently deceased minds.<eos> We're in a cloud?<eos> A sort of cloud, yeah.<eos> And what's happening to it?
There were multiple crash sites over 100 square miles.<eos> May we meet again.<eos> #It's a missile.<eos> Our ancestors used them to destroy the world.<eos> We're gonna use one to get back to it.
What is it between you and her?<eos> Years ago, before I was with you she and I were in a relationship.<eos> What?<eos> It only lasted a year.<eos> And then I ended it and moved on.
The concealment of Juliette Andraux's body and the identity theft have lapsed.<eos> - And for Raphaëlle's murder?<eos> - She has an alibi.<eos> And Juliette's body?<eos> What did they do with it?
Decades of rot beneath the floorboard combined with a broken ventilation system.<eos> The previous owners never put any money into this place.<eos> And you said, "I gotta have it."<eos> I saw an opportunity.<eos> Take a blight on the neighborhood and give it a new purpose.
All of my hobbies include a gun.<eos> How's our experiment going?<eos> Very well, sir.<eos> The NYPD has locked up nearly two dozen criminals after Samaritan decrypted a host of IP addresses and anonymously emailed the information to the press.<eos> The police owe it a debt of gratitude.
Are you seriously, seriously suggesting that you want to watch me bathe in exchange for getting my dowry back?<eos> Well, that is quite a leap.<eos> I would never speak so bluntly in front of a lady.<eos> I'd simply say that midnight is a very fine time for a bath.<eos> The world's so quiet then, you could almost believe you're the only one in it.
You are no friend.<eos> Or patriot.<eos> You're just a dangerous man.<eos> Well, perhaps it's escaped your notice, but the world is a dangerous place!<eos> And one day, you will wish you had someone like me to protect you from it.
- Ooh.<eos> I've been living in a tent for the last two years.<eos> Oh, yeah, this is not that.<eos> We got a sauna in the kitchen.<eos> A lot of people think that's weird, but I keep wine in it.
I can see your footprints.<eos> I think I found what killed Charles Pinworth.<eos> Kills the body, mind and soul.<eos> You might want to see this.<eos> Wherever the healing stream flows is the box and Luger is digging for it around the hotel.
You have to forgive pregnant people for anything they've ever done to you.<eos> - It's like a federal law.<eos> - Deal.<eos> I can't wait to meet this kid.<eos> And we're having a going-away party for Chantry, and you should come to it to say goodbye.
Do you know of Jorge?<eos> I know they were great friends.<eos> Why is the world so cruel?<eos> I often ask myself that.<eos> It is if it doesn't care.
The back door.<eos> Come on. Come on.<eos> Wait!<eos> Wait. Come here.<eos> We're heading towards danger, not away from it. I can feel it.
No, I don't think so.<eos> I mean, I've got a lot of work to do. I've got to get through these cold calls, so...<eos> Okay, so you don't want to go to the stag, or...?<eos> Are you kidding me?<eos> The last time I saw a vagina, it was when my daughter was coming out of it.
Love distorts things.<eos> Or even worse... love is something you've never asked for.<eos> The erotic was something I asked for, or even demanded of men.<eos> But this idiotic love...<eos> I felt humiliated by it, and all the dishonesty that follows.
Calm down?<eos> You want me to calm down?<eos> You go fucking around with the electrical system in a 30-year-old piece-of-shit truck in the middle of the desert with no food and no water, and I'm supposed to calm down!<eos> I didn't fuck around with it.<eos> I disabled it, briefly. You should be thankful that I'm willing to go to these...
I'm not the husband, but I'm on the team, right?<eos> We'll do it together.<eos> Chloe has a water lily in her right lung.<eos> We saw it.<eos> It's quite big but we ought to be able to get rid of it.
Chloe has a water lily in her right lung.<eos> We saw it.<eos> It's quite big but we ought to be able to get rid of it.<eos> It really hurts when it moves.<eos> The doc said we must surround it with flowers to scare it off.
Thought you said you were a musician.<eos> Folk singer with a cat.<eos> You queer?<eos> - It's not my cat.<eos> I just didn't know what to do with it.
But what came next was, um... Even more startling.<eos> NASA discovered heat signatures under an area known as the conamara chaos.<eos> Well, they teased the idea that-- that simple mono-cellular life in our solar system might not just be possible, it might be probable.<eos> I wanna go to Europa and go ice fishing.<eos> Cut through the ice, lower a submersible, look around, see what's there. See what swims up to the camera lens and licks it.
We succeeded in controlling the toxin, but the specimens are showing an uncontrollable aggressiveness.<eos> We're experiencing an irreparable side effect.<eos> The toxin somehow acts on the cerebral tissues, destroying any ability of the specimen to keep the control over its own aggression.<eos> It basically acts on the nervous connectors, enhancing ferocity at an exponential level.<eos> Try putting a steroid rat into this cage and in a manner of seconds, nothing will be left of it.
Execute me!<eos> Then do get on with it.<eos> I promised myself an early night.<eos> Justice is no joking matter, Monsieur.<eos> I do what I can to serve it, but if I fail, there is a higherjustice, believe me.
Indeed, you have found for yourself a haven most peaceful, madame.<eos> A haven from the storm.<eos> Yes.<eos> The world is a wicked place, Monsieur Poirot.<eos> There are very wicked people in it.
Grand.<eos> 35 grand.<eos> We're also gonna need Tony's guitar.<eos> Atticus Fetch.<eos> He's desperate to record with it.
Okay.<eos> Great.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Adam?<eos> How is it the world keeps spinning and you manage to stay ahead of it?
Building a wall has to be well planned in advance.<eos> It's not just a brick, cement, another brick and more cement.<eos> We tell ourselves that... in 100 years this wall will still be standing.<eos> It must protect our children.<eos> People will lean on it.
She will be okay.<eos> But she won't remember I have powers?<eos> It's for the best.<eos> Listen to me, Elsa. Your power will only grow.<eos> There is beauty in it. But also great danger.
- I need to rehearse.<eos> The Dominican Republic is one part of an island.<eos> Haiti takes up the other part.<eos> The whole island is called Hispaniola.<eos> Christopher Columbus gave it that name in 1492.
- Bye.<eos> The Dominican Republic is one part of an island.<eos> Haiti takes up the other part.<eos> The whole island is called Hispaniola.<eos> Christopher Columbus gave it that name in 1492.
During his trial, he had to be removed from the court for singing.<eos> He was an idiot.<eos> We had CCTV footage of him arriving at his block of flats with a nice new suitcase, clearly empty, and then leaving an hour later dragging it along the ground.<eos> Moving a body?<eos> What was left of it.
Coincidence?<eos> Where do you think all these separate peoples got such an idea?<eos> Dysentery.<eos> Aha. Q, you're getting to be very funny lately.<eos> Listen up, if you have a soul, which I'm betting you do, this baby will locate it and connect you with it.
So my recklessness doesn't concern you.<eos> It concerns me because you won't be drawing attention just to yourself.<eos> I could use a friend.<eos> Someone who can understand me.<eos> Who thinks like I do and can see the world and the people in it the way I do.
Despite K's immature appearance, his methods were surprisingly refined.<eos> As I twisted and turned while he was whipping me, I could feel how clever his knots were.<eos> If I fought them, they would get tighter, and as I relaxed, it seemed they did, too.<eos> Like a cat playing with a mouse.<eos> Fooling it to believe it has a chance of escape and then attacking it again.
There's nothing special about you.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> You were hoping for a different answer.<eos> But this is beyond our comprehension.<eos> What answer would a lab rat understand from a scientist in a white coat putting electrodes in its brain, giving it cancer?
It gave you the courage... to push on.<eos> At that time, I needed to give you back the hope that we could win.<eos> I could use that tulip right now.<eos> Where is it?<eos> I don't know what you did with it.
Satan's or yours?<eos> I was told she fell from the third floor.<eos> Evidently it was your grip that failed her.<eos> Her everlasting soul has been set free.<eos> Now we must help it find rest.
- Aaron...<eos> - Rachel.<eos> Ben gave me that necklace.<eos> It drove me nuts.<eos> It almost got us all killed.
What is it?<eos> Come in.<eos> Minoru is not your brother.<eos> I am very sorry, but your brother is dead.<eos> You deny reality, and fear it.
Boric acid... it burns green.<eos> I saw it on Bill Nye The Science Guy.<eos> Rex burned the same color.<eos> So this is a cause-and-effect artifact.<eos> I don't know... he torched his place and went up in flames with it.
Almost all of it.<eos> Jenny, I've stashed a bottle of Advocaat under your pillow.<eos> Thank you for telling me. What is it?<eos> Just a rather naughty version of egg nog.<eos> When you mix it with fizz, you get something called a Snowball.
It says we need the instrument of original infection.<eos> Okay, the instrument of original infection would've been the cat's claws.<eos> - Exactly.<eos> - Well, let's get the cat.<eos> What happened to it?
Don't listen to him, Obi--<eos> - Quiet.<eos> You can kill me, but you will never destroy me.<eos> It takes strength to resist the dark side.<eos> Only the weak embrace it.
You can kill me, but you will never destroy me.<eos> It takes strength to resist the dark side.<eos> Only the weak embrace it.<eos> It is more powerful than you know.<eos> And those who oppose it are more powerful than you'll ever be.
Kill the fucking Romans!<eos> Fuck this.<eos> All should be struck from this world.<eos> Fuck the Romans!<eos> As you struck Attius from it?
And make swift return for more.<eos> I shall try not to kill to many Romans short of your presence.<eos> You've had your fill of women and drink?<eos> I'm a man of the sea.<eos> And do not belong from it.
It stood as sacrifice.<eos> For Spartacus.<eos> You believe him a God now?<eos> It was made on his behalf.<eos> To plead for his cause... and all those devoted to it.
I have often been at cross purpose with the Gaul.<eos> Yet his fucking presence shall be missed.<eos> I shall not feel the sting of it.<eos> You yet hate the man?<eos> I will not miss his presence... Because I shall not be from it.
It contains everything.<eos> You remove a single piece...<eos> No circle. Your recklessness, your mistakes, are the reason why, when they say<eos> "you can't change the world," you won't listen.<eos> The world is better off with both of us in it, Caleb,
I'm-I'm sorry, are we both listening to "Snowbird," as recorded by Miss Anne Murray?<eos> Yeah, the woman in the song is trying to cope with getting older and she feels trapped because she knows she can't do anything about it.<eos> No, no, no, no.<eos> I mean, you're right that she's feeling trapped, but the message is positive.<eos> It's about being trapped in a bad relationship and having the guts to get out of it. See, what I hear, is that the woman is starting to hate life.
Is that really true?<eos> Because it sounds wonderful.<eos> It isn't what you think.<eos> Magic is the reason I left.<eos> I lost everything because of it.
We're here.<eos> So your sacred cause is pilfering a dwarf's pickaxe?<eos> Regina... had this in her pocket when you turned her over to us.<eos> It's a trigger, and this axe, according to our people, is what activates it.<eos> You're going to destroy an entire town and kill everyone in it...
Tomas.<eos> It will say anything to justify itself.<eos> I'll be strong.<eos> The path to the Shepherd is through the sheep.<eos> Find the impostor, bleed it for what it knows, then kill it.
Sheffield!<eos> With his back against the wall, outgunned and overwhelmed...<eos> He ordered me to release of the dark matter, to form a layer around the Earth, and create a true Sanctified Zone.<eos> But the risk was too great. I should have stopped him.<eos> The dark matter was an uncontrollable force, beyond Harlock's imagination. It ended up consuming Earth in fire and darkness.
All we have is her.<eos> - The girl lives.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> The world is changing, Pam.<eos> We have to change with it.
And when you burn down the old, new things grow.<eos> We can make a better world, Rachel, a safer one.<eos> Yes, people have died.<eos> It's a tragedy.<eos> But you either let that grief define you or you learn from it.
Used to be called your life, but then you got married.<eos> So now it's just a room.<eos> Well, the problem is my wife is in there more than I am.<eos> She said I needed a plant in there, so now she's in there all the time taking care of the plant.<eos> You know, feeding it, watering it, talking to it.
Well, granted my emotions were off.<eos> And that's why you were more fun just as Damon is probably relishing in Elena's emotionless company in New York.<eos> My brother knows what he's doing.<eos> Does he? Don't underestimate the allure of darkness, Stefan.<eos> Even the purest hearts are drawn to it.
Liodes, don't insult the gods.<eos> I'm on your side. Don't be afraid.<eos> Of men or gods.<eos> Oh, Artemis, watch over queen Penelope and our island of Ithaca.<eos> Bring it the prosperity and stability it once had.
You're afraid.<eos> That's good.<eos> A warrior should feel fear, but not go to sleep with it.
You look great in that dress.<eos> Yeah, it's a good deal.<eos> Okay.<eos> I can do this. Focus on one moment, one memory, and just try to be there with it.<eos> You have to step into your past in order to reconnect with it.
Yeah, I guess it is.<eos> Your mom really does hate change.<eos> Oh, I visited our fort today.<eos> It's in pretty good shape, you know, after five years of neglect.<eos> Yeah, I check on it from time to time.
And may she bear you a dwarf, a succubus.<eos> And may you rot in that circle of hell reserved for the Borgia family.<eos> There is no hell.<eos> No heaven either.<eos> This world is what we make of it.
Now it's hungry.<eos> But you don't take it back to the same restaurant.<eos> What is that and why is it wearing a bow tie?<eos> Maybe because an actual tie would drag on the ground.<eos> Speaking of "dragging on the ground," maybe you could drag an antelope back to your cave and have sex with it.
Chester's Mill is a place like any other.<eos> At least, it used to be, until we were cut off from the rest of the world by a mysterious dome.<eos> Invisible, indestructible, inescapable.<eos> We're trapped.<eos> We don't know where it came from or why it's here, but now that we're all trapped under the dome together, none of our secrets are safe.
No.<eos> The clinic's not far.<eos> I'll walk.<eos> You come with.<eos> They're connected to it.
No!<eos> Hey!<eos> Rose is dead.<eos> Joe and Norrie touched the dome together.<eos> They're connected to it.
Hi.<eos> Welcome to my room.<eos> I want you to come with me to the dome.<eos> So we can figure all this out.<eos> See how we're really connected to it.
It was like we had powers or something.<eos> Don't you think that's amazing?<eos> It's not exactly the word I'd use.<eos> Well, you should.<eos> Let's go see if we can talk to it or something.
I mean, you're just one of his employees after all. Well, I'd like to think<eos> I'm a little more than just that. Yes, of course.<eos> I don't know why he's so interested in...<eos> In us?<eos> He's assumed this very intense involvement in our relationship as if he's a part of it somehow.
He was buying up all the pay phones in Manhattan, but they stopped him.<eos> I don't know about you, but I don't want to see what happens when an evil multinational becomes omniscient.<eos> But why you would leave it so vulnerable?<eos> You made the machine to protect everybody.<eos> What did you do to it that it can't protect itself?
I'll take it over there, please.<eos> Careful what you wish for.<eos> This communion that you're seeking, it may not be what you think.<eos> This isn't about me.<eos> It's about saving the machine, not just from Decima, but from what you did to it.
Excellency, please.<eos> Here is my assurance.<eos> Terni will never again be cheated while you're in possession of this box.<eos> - This is witchcraft.<eos> That is why I give it to the Grimani, the finest Christian family in Terni.
Scared of their fear.<eos> Scared of our courage.<eos> Thank you very much!<eos> Thank you. But today it's not about me.<eos> Today it's about our freedom and we want to give it a face.
All it is is a shallow stream, 12 yards across.<eos> Listen...<eos> I'm gonna drive you right up to it and we're all gonna be watching you.<eos> You way across that river and you head up to that treeline on the other side.<eos> Once you hit it, follow it north for three miles back to the Iranian checkpoint where we were originally gonna drop you.
Good morning, Mr. Draper.<eos> Mr. Sterling's inside.<eos> - Do you want ice?<eos> - Coffee.<eos> It's one thing to be near the bar, it's another thing to be under it.
Ruth, it's my job.<eos> I understand that.<eos> But killing them should make you lose your appetite as well.<eos> I don't take joy from it.<eos> A man who hates his sin can be redeemed from it, even if he can't turn away from it.
I killed two people and you haven't said a word about it.<eos> What do you want me to say?<eos> It's not about what you say.<eos> It's about facing reality.<eos> It always comes for us and over and over again we face it so that we can live.
I'm sorry for my part in what happened today. - No, you spoke honest.<eos> - No, but I failed to tell--<eos> I am who they say I am, Ruth.<eos> I done every damn thing they say I done.<eos> My father once told me... to put the past behind you, you must accept that you've moved beyond it.
It's crazy to me, but at least it makes sense, but this massacre was just a pointless, brutal thing.<eos> In all your life, have you ever heard of anything like that, a good man, an aspiring priest, just goes on a killing spree out of nowhere.<eos> I've seen quite a lot in my time.<eos> The world is a rather awful place.<eos> Best to meet it on its own terms.
Yes, Freddy had a horrid attack.<eos> The channel was not properly closed and when this happens, the spiritual energy may linger, disturbed, and sometimes hostile.<eos> There's nothing spiritual about a man being hit over the head and impaled on a fence.<eos> That energy may enter a living person, drive them to violent acts.<eos> It is irresistible.
This way.<eos> Inspector, believe what I say, for your own sake.<eos> The heart line never lies.<eos> You know that your greatest passion is very close at hand.<eos> Pursue it.
That's all we gave him for his heart.<eos> So... ..drinking virgin's tears by the moonlight was Mrs Bolkonsky's idea.<eos> Oh, is nothing dear.<eos> That energy may enter a living person, drive them to violent acts.<eos> It is irresistible.
My hubby is in Australia now.<eos> We'll be leaving for it soon.<eos> Her age is perfect for picking up new languages.<eos> Wanna see the doll?<eos> Su-ah, let her play with it.
Wait, this has your name on it.<eos> - That's amazing!<eos> - Thank you.<eos> And this is yours.<eos> And it says...
I've spoken to him and he says you may ask him for my hand.<eos> When you like.<eos> Before I ask him, allow me to ask you.<eos> Is your love solid?<eos> Why? Will it take what I have to ask of it?
The runners were great, best team I ever had.<eos> And then-then one day out of nowhere, you put your jam out there. And now it's all anyone can think about.<eos> Well, I'm sorry.<eos> I worked hard on that jam.<eos> I wanted to share it, take the jam to the next level.
She says she's the one who poisoned Titus Delancey.<eos> Crawford and Gleason are in interrogation talking to her now.<eos> She say why she did it?<eos> According to her, Titus uncovered her real identity a few weeks ago.<eos> He was using it to try to extort sexual favors.
Not yet.<eos> And not if we can stop it.<eos> Pestilence instituted this plague centuries ago but the Roanoke colony contained it, stopping its spread and thwarting the horseman from riding forth.<eos> It's been unleashed anew through Thomas.<eos> If it manages to spread this time...
On the other hand, if I just would've stuck, you know, not let my brothers talk me out of being a firefighter, I don't know, maybe I could've saved them.<eos> Or you could've died, too.<eos> And you wouldn't have been able to save your nephew.<eos> Vincent, we can't change the past, as much as we both may want to.<eos> The best we can do is remember it, learn from it and move forward.
It appears that Hayden duplicated an email that Sven had received, but not yet read.<eos> And he altered it in the process.<eos> And what did the email say?<eos> The email is from an anonymous address, regarding an auction that took place today.<eos> In it, Vanger was instructed to bid on lot 424, but Hayden redrafted it, instructing him to bid on lot 426.
The most I've ever paid to see a pussy dance.<eos> So far we're keeping the cat.<eos> Hey, Han, do you want a cat?<eos> You could finally have a friend your own size.<eos> Come on, you could ride it to work.
Being the Supreme isn't something to wish for.<eos> It's not a gift.<eos> It's a burden.<eos> How many of these women had happy lives?<eos> They had the power, but with it came the crushing responsibility of the coven.
Hey, you figured out something with Bundsch, didn't you?<eos> How we're gonna get him.<eos> If you didn't, you wouldn't have left so quietly.<eos> I took the missing girl's hairbrush out of her purse.<eos> The hairs entwined in it will be brimming with her DNA.
Think I've given our consultants a little too much sway.<eos> Some friends of mine wanted to let me know before it was too late to right the ship.<eos> And I appreciate that.<eos> We've got a mission here.<eos> It's to protect this city and the citizens that live in it.
I wanted to make sure they're taking good care of you here.<eos> The hearing ended today. The judge recommended that I end our arrangement with Holmes and his partner.<eos> It's just a recommendation, though.<eos> The decision's mine.<eos> And I'll admit it... I'm struggling with it.
Ooh, speaking of which, where are the bacon-wrapped figs?<eos> Probably at... (clears throat) ...the laser tag place, where the real rehearsal dinner's going down.<eos> Isn't that right, Theodore?<eos> Barney, there is no laser tag.<eos> We're gonna have a nice dinner, some drinks, and then, according to Robin, if her Aunt Edith gets drunk enough, she'll take off her wig and they'll play hockey with it.
Okay.<eos> Then one night a coyote ate that cat and I was an emotional wreck.<eos> - You know why?<eos> Because it turns out I loved that cat and I didn't even know it.<eos> I would have known it if it was hooked up to an EEG and I had sex with it.
And I believed her.<eos> There is nothing left of me but a bit of burnt wick and a wisp of smoke.<eos> And look at you now.<eos> So don't be afraid.<eos> Danger passes by those who look it right in the eye.
I love those!<eos> Good fish.<eos> Don't eat my feet.<eos> So, how did the tiger fly?<eos> She jumped on the sun... and rode it to Tomorrow.
What if before she died she wrote a letter saying she chose Harvey Dent over you?<eos> And what if to spare you pain I burnt that letter?<eos> How dare you use Rachel to try to stop me?<eos> I am using the truth, Master Wayne.<eos> Maybe it's time we all stopped trying to outsmart the truth and let it have its day.
Decommission it.<eos> Flood it.<eos> Destroy the world's best chance for a sustainable future?<eos> If the world's not ready, yes.<eos> Bruce, if you want to save the world, you have to start trusting it.
Nothing held back.<eos> Admirable, but mistaken.<eos> Oh, you think darkness is your ally?<eos> But you merely adopted the dark.<eos> I was born in it.
Admirable, but mistaken.<eos> Oh, you think darkness is your ally?<eos> But you merely adopted the dark.<eos> I was born in it.<eos> Molded by it.
Pirate?<eos> No, no, no, no, no.<eos> Scientist.<eos> Yes, good old, good old science.<eos> Can't get enough of it.
The human body is essentially a walking battery full of bio-energy particularly that which is generated by the brain.<eos> Ben, please.<eos> How long...<eos> The first sounds acted as a beacon, drawing the entity to our world.<eos> Then we allowed it to cross over.
How about you tell me what opera is and then later on I'll tell you what rap is?<eos> There you go. What can I do?<eos> Uh, well, you know, originally, it was people just like you went to the opera.<eos> Casual clothes, they took food, they took alcohol, they threw things.<eos> Anyway, that was a long time ago that rich people took over the world of opera with their fancy dress, and they took the soul out of it - they made it something that it's not.
Come on!<eos> What makes you think that I have a CD?<eos> I don't know anybody who's been in an RB band who doesn't have their own CD in their car.<eos> Wow, I feel so unique right now, it's crazy.<eos> - That's why you're reaching for it.
I finally read my dad's letter, which was like my last essay to you.<eos> Just a bunch of words on a page.<eos> This one's all you, charger.<eos> I know this sounds strange, but I've always felt like I wouldn't be around for very long, which is why I want to take that drop.<eos> Because once I look down over the edge and I catch it, I'll become a part of it.
Guess what I did.<eos> A cat used to come to our garden.<eos> One day, I took the quail from its cage. I gave it to the cat.<eos> It carried it off to a corner to eat it in peace.<eos> I followed it.
You got to go after your dreams, Eric.<eos> I mean, if you don't make an effort, nothing's ever gonna change.<eos> You think?<eos> Absolutely.<eos> You got to find your passion and then let it guide you, let it envelop...
[ In English ] "Your picture is of a face hard as rock... and cold as ice in the North Pole.<eos> Contempt hovers on the lips, and an iron brutality is seen in the eyes.<eos> I felt that that page on which your picture is on... contaminated the whole of the review.<eos> I put on a glove. I felt it revolting to put my bare hand on that page.<eos> Ripped it out from the review, and not wanting to give it the... dignity of burning it, I threw it in the garbage can.
Then passed the time really very fast?<eos> I can not remember and can not report.<eos> It's not true.<eos> Time I just seemed to pass quickly.<eos> I believe the time is very still, and I move in it.
As you can see this is not purely a human ﬂame.<eos> What sort of hell is that?<eos> Can you see that?<eos> Terrifying... this is what the gas looks like really.<eos> Flame gives it substance.
"Mr. Vanderplatt, sir, I would like to ask for your daughter's hand in marriage. ".<eos> Aww.<eos> - So what could I say to him?<eos> I simply reply,<eos> "you touch my daughter again," I will skin your ass alive "and burn your house down to the ground with you in it. "
You have,how should I put it?<eos> Desexed the creature.<eos> It is a bull,surely,Madam.<eos> It looks like a bull,it stands like a bull.<eos> But it lacks something of the male vigour.
Think of it as payment.<eos> For what?<eos> I've invited many potential investors to the celebration this evening.<eos> What does that have to do with me?<eos> It's become clear to me that this railroad could do with a face, other than my own, associated with it.
They don't have to be like me, but...<eos> Do you know anything about Ralph Waldo Emerson? Uh....<eos> From school.<eos> He said that you have to be a transparent eyeball.<eos> What he meant was, you have to take in the world and pass it through you.
Yeah?<eos> I'm proud of you.<eos> Don't...<eos> Bruce?<eos> At the end of the day all we can do is search for the truth, learn from it and most importantly, defend it.
And what did you do to her?<eos> I touched her pussy.<eos> Did you like it?<eos> Yes, it was soft.<eos> Very little hair. Then I smelled it. It smelled like pee.
Okay, I am now prepared to separate them completely.<eos> Wait.<eos> Hold on. What about complications?<eos> I mean, what if there's a double hemivertebra or a tethered cord?<eos> We will cross that bridge when we come to it.
Nothing ever alters for you people, does it?<eos> Revolutions erupt and monarchies crash to the ground and the groom still cannot see the bride before the wedding.<eos> You Americans never understand the importance of tradition.<eos> Yes, we do.<eos> We just don't give it power over us.
Ah, not at all.<eos> I don't even mind airports anymore.<eos> I got so used to them when your mom and I split up. - Why?<eos> - Ugh.<eos> Every time she had a function or an event or something I had to fly back for it to keep up the front that our marriage was still fine. That we were still the perfect couple.
You're paying me to protect you, right now most likely from yourself.<eos> What's the problem, boys?<eos> Listen to me.<eos> Every minute we waste sitting around here, waiting for a boat that's never gonna come could be the difference between finding my dad dead or alive.<eos> We finally have a real lead, so let's follow it, on foot if we have to.
That you may know 'tis no sinister nor no awkward claim picked from the worm-holes of long-vanished days, nor from the dust of old oblivion raked, he sends you this most memorable line, in every branch truly demonstrative.<eos> Overlook this pedigree and when you find him evenly derived from his most famed of famous ancestors, Edward III, he bids you then resign your crown and kingdom, indirectly held from him, the native and true challenger.<eos> Or else what follows?<eos> Bloody constraint.<eos> For if you hide the crown even in your hearts, there will he rake for it.
O God of battles! Steel my soldiers' hearts.<eos> Possess them not with fear.<eos> Take from them now the sense of reckoning, if the opposed numbers pluck their hearts from them.<eos> Not today, O Lord, O, not today, think not upon the fault my father made in compassing the crown!<eos> I Richard's body have interred anew, and on it have bestow'd more contrite tears than from it issued forced drops of blood.
Something happens at around 92 miles an hour.<eos> Thunder headers drown out all sound.<eos> Engine vibration travels at a heart's rate.<eos> Field of vision funnels into the immediate.<eos> And suddenly, you're not on the road, you're in it, a part of it.
- For behind-the-scenes material.<eos> Was that secret?<eos> - She wanted her film work.<eos> I helped her.<eos> You put it on half speed and takes 12 hours.
Me wish I could love you.<eos> In a perfect world I ity there.<eos> But the world is perfect.<eos> Helena.<eos> It is what we make of it.
You are beautiful.<eos> What's with you tonight?<eos> You're not wearing your blouse.<eos> Is that the reason?<eos> I spilled something on it.
Mom, tell him.<eos> So much for the possibility of a friendly divorce.<eos> Well, she'll settle quietly.<eos> I'm making sure of that.<eos> Do I have to remind you what happened to this company the last time David Clarke's name was associated with it?
Can I help?<eos> This is harder than it looks.<eos> You know what, this is too short.<eos> I have a real tie that I wore to a costume party.<eos> Can you check that cabinet and see if it's in there?
So I had to think fast.<eos> The flag.<eos> Of course.<eos> I was expecting you.<eos> Take me to it now.
Ellen!<eos> They found me. Who?<eos> Trust Sam.<eos> I spent the last decade of my life hiding from the truth.<eos> I'm finally ready to face it, and I'll be damned if I'm turning back now because you think I can't help you.
Why is that?<eos> 'Cause I'm standing here talking to a man who doesn't want to be found.<eos> Sam, no one wants these guys taken down more than me.<eos> I spent the last decade of my life hiding from the truth.<eos> I'm finally ready to face it, and I'll be damned if I'm turning back now because you think I can't help you.
She's in Shanghai, waiting for me to agree to the contract.<eos> You have a problem with an arranged marriage?<eos> My problem is marrying into a family that deals in opium.<eos> My father smoked opium.<eos> Once he took to the pipe, he was consumed by it.
It's orientation day, right?<eos> I mean... If... If you're still cool with me going to Collins with you.<eos> Of course I am.<eos> Declan, I need you to think really hard about the hooded person you saw on the beach.<eos> Charlotte's starting to think that it was a woman you both saw in the blackness.
And because she saved you, all of you.<eos> And because no matter what Regina did, it does not justify this.<eos> We are not murderers here.<eos> Well, we're not from this world.<eos> Yeah, well, you're in it now.
Tell me...<eos> What's the Bureau's interest in this?<eos> What's your interest?<eos> You want to put one over on the CIA?<eos> Yes, I want to expose the CIA for what it's become, but... mainly, I want to catch him.
Can you hear what I'm saying?<eos> Did she like the party?<eos> L.-<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, she liked it.
Oh! What the fuck!<eos> How were we supposed to know you were gonna be here?<eos> You fucking bitch!<eos> I already shot you once, Beardy-face I will do it again.<eos> I'm sorry, I told you. The Orchard is not what you think it is.
Dressed up like this no one will recognize me<eos> It allows me to see my true self<eos> Howdy Grandmaster<eos> Chen-style kung fu comes from daily life and is integrated into life<eos> The way to live life is to adapt to nature and learn from it
Amazing.<eos> We've managed to perfect the apple... a genetically modified version that never goes brown.<eos> And yet, we still haven't upgraded human beings.<eos> The human race has stalled out, Harold.<eos> And from what I've seen, most of it is rotten to the core.
I was just trying to keep you safe.<eos> By lying to me about the most important thing in my life?<eos> That lie was the only thing that was protecting you.<eos> Castle, I didn't need protection.<eos> I needed a lead, and you sat on it for a year.
Where are we?<eos> It's a little island our captors like to think of as their haven.<eos> Haven? From what?<eos> The world's dangerous.<eos> What's left of it, anyway, well, they can't keep us down here.
Looks like he tied one on a little too tight.<eos> Bet you'd never believe me if I told you he was a violin prodigy who played two years with the Philharmonic.<eos> His penchant for the bottle cut his career short.<eos> How exactly does this help stop terrorism?<eos> Before I could teach the machine to find bad people, I had to teach it people in general.
No. You're worried about the wrong thing.<eos> It's not your fault.<eos> The Restons aren't the victims.<eos> My family stole from this city.<eos> They hurt the people in it.
What do you say we chalk it up... to the barometric pressure... and never speak of it again?<eos> I know what you did, Sister.<eos> Thank you for protecting me.<eos> Protecting us.<eos> Even though I don't fully understand your work... I feel I've been an important part of it.
When this is over, we can all just walk away.<eos> Hell hath no fury, eh, Jordan?<eos> I'm not here because of Nathan.<eos> Right.<eos> When that barn disappears, my trouble goes with it.
He belongs here now, like his mother.<eos> Why?<eos> Why do I belong here?<eos> Think of the barn as an amplifier for you.<eos> When you're in it, your energy keeps the troubles at bay.
Oswin, there's a Dalek ship in orbit.<eos> Yeah, got it on the sensors.<eos> The Asylum has a force-field.<eos> The Daleks upstairs are waiting for me to turn it off.<eos> Soon as I do, they'll burn this world and us with it.
You should go now.<eos> I like your story.<eos> I like the way you tell it.<eos> I want to be part of it.<eos> Those who are part of it died.
I want to be part of it.<eos> Those who are part of it died.<eos> Would you like me to kill you?<eos> No.<eos> I just would like to be part of it. That's all.
Nothing yet.<eos> Shouldn't we call the bomb squad? No time.<eos> It's got a cell phone trigger.<eos> Call might come in at any second.<eos> John, you need to get away from it right now.
Finch, I got a sniper on my 6:00.<eos> I got the wife.<eos> I'm not sure it's Mrs. Drake the sniper's after, Mr. Reese.<eos> She just sent a text to an anonymized number.<eos> It just says, "now."
So, what are you saying?<eos> That battery is four years old.<eos> These shreds of newspaper are four years old.<eos> The bomb that exploded this morning was four years old.<eos> But why would the suspect build a bomb and sit on it for four years?
If not the cure, then what?<eos> I'm in this for Silas, all right?<eos> Up until this point, he's only been myth.<eos> So write a thesis.<eos> Would you rather be the guy who writes about Noah's ark or the one who sails it down the Hudson river? I'm not buying it.
You promised me you would never do that.<eos> Until recently, I never had to use my power to know what you were thinking, Raven.<eos> Charles, I used to think it was going to be you and me against the world.<eos> But no matter how bad the world gets, you don't want to be against it, do you?<eos> You want to be a part of it.
A confession is a redemptive thing, Katie.<eos> It's good for the soul.<eos> I guess you already know that I've been singing English songs.<eos> And I've been fibbing to my dat, too.<eos> He told me to get rid of my guitar, but I've been playing it in secret.
Go, Franklin!<eos> I was volunteering for their spring musical festival when their regular director suddenly and mysteriously became ill.<eos> Oh, sorry. It may have been a blessing.<eos> Their show lacked focus.<eos> I gave it a theme...
Oh, lord.<eos> Don't try to talk me out of it!<eos> Well?<eos> Bender, you always say you're going to kill yourself, but you almost never do. Yeah.<eos> Last time you went to the suicide booth, you ended up dating it for six months.
If prioleau finds out that I asked into this case, he gonna know I'm your bitch.<eos> I'll be damned.<eos> I saw that same guy play trumpet the other night at this little club way out from the French quarter.<eos> You're learning the town, I see.<eos> Oh, I'm loving the town, what's left of it anyway.
My father lies dying.<eos> And the dark elf?<eos> He is dead, slain by my brother.<eos> I warned your father against giving him sanctuary.<eos> There are many who seek this weapon, for with it, even the weak can rise up against Jotunheim.
this is not Eric's fault.<eos> Yes,it is. You...<eos> You knew what she had been through.<eos> All right,you knew what happened to her.<eos> You were supposed to be her teacher, not some sicko who takes advantage of a kid who wouldn't know a healthy relationship if she was sitting next to it in study hall.
Am I, father?<eos> Vanity, however, is getting the better of you.<eos> How so?<eos> You have done what is forbidden.<eos> You've chosen the dark side and allowed it to feed your anger - and desire for power.
I think he did.<eos> That's why he hid the plate instead of using it.<eos> Well, if he really wanted out, he could have destroyed the plate.<eos> I don't know. Temptation of that last big score is strong.<eos> Ford can't resist it.
But you did.<eos> And I am.<eos> -You followed the trail.<eos> -The one you left.<eos> But what if I knew you couldn't help but follow it?
I always dismissed it as fantasy.<eos> It can't be looked at solely with a scientific mind.<eos> It's too complex.<eos> Nothing is too complex for our technology.<eos> I will isolate it in the medical bay.
What the Freud is that about?<eos> Look, I didn't name her, my neighbor did.<eos> She died and I felt bad.<eos> Sarah would've been destroyed at the shelter.<eos> Who wouldn't want a cat that croaks if you're not home twice a day to shoot it up?
Doesn't seem right, just leaving her here.<eos> Our mission has to take priority, and this could be a trap.<eos> Or an opportunity.<eos> Porter sends us after information on the structure.<eos> This woman's been living next to it for months.
- We need to abort.<eos> - Negative.<eos> - We have a shot at Marcus.<eos> ERICA: That is not the plan.<eos> If we can't cut the head off the beast we can at least rob it of its right hand.
you can learn and fall in line with its natural laws and conduct yourself accordingly- invariably creating good health sustainability... or you can go against the current - to no avail.<eos> It doesn't matter how much you believe you can just stand up right now and walk on the wall next to you the law of gravity will not allow it.<eos> If you do not eat - you will die.<eos> If you are not touched as an infant - you will die.<eos> As harsh as it may sound, nature is a dictatorship and we can either listen to it and come in harmony with it or suffer the inevitable adverse consequences.
Thomas is making promises of a place for us here.<eos> And more and more of us are willing to listen.<eos> I hope you're not talking about yourself, Carlos.<eos> Look, I'm giving you the gun.<eos> I'm not pointing it at you.
A spirit has come to help him. It comes from far away.<eos> A woman?<eos> Maybe.<eos> Should I eliminate her?<eos> A spirit is even more dangerous if it becomes a ghost. In that case...
Yeah, it's an apology.<eos> You're a real dick sometimes.<eos> Yeah, I acknowledge that.<eos> I'll tell you what, I've got a lead on Sophia.<eos> I'm gonna go check it out.
- What?<eos> That he's thinking.<eos> Two months and five days.<eos> - And the cat?<eos> - What about it?
Get it all down in your nooks and crannies.<eos> Someone's gotten pretty oily...<eos> So, hey, hate to interrupt your conversation...<eos> It wasn't a conversation, Lana.<eos> I was just talking to my gun, not with it. Um...
If you didn't care, you would have told them months ago.<eos> Oh, I see.<eos> Because I don't want you to lose your job, it must mean I'm madly in love with you.<eos> Well, doesn't it?<eos> You say I'm a free spirit, and I hope I am, but you're asking me to give up my whole world and everyone in it.
Maybe when you grow up, lesbian grandmothers will be normal?<eos> I just hope she'll be happy.<eos> This family doesn't really do happiness.<eos> But that's the family you're going to inherit.<eos> I tried to escape it.
And that's in...<eos> It's out in Davie.<eos> But--but don't waste your time.<eos> It's been abandoned for over 20 years now.<eos> Not much left of it.
The land is much bigger than indicated on the map.<eos> We start to suspect the land will block our passage.<eos> A little later, we see open water in the southeast. We return to our ship to tell the news to Willem Barentsz.<eos> This northern route goes straight through the ice.<eos> You want to follow it, Willem?
It is extremely dangerous.<eos> Okay, thank you.<eos> That's it.<eos> Keith Johnstone says that we get into trance when we put the mask.<eos> For a moment we are obsessed by it .
You're certain Stefan's still with him.<eos> Easy to be certain when the alternative is that he's dead.<eos> Are you sure you're still ok on the couch?<eos> Yeah, yeah.<eos> I'm good. Because you spent half the summer on it.
It's the quality.<eos> He moves overseas, it's gonna kill the goose that laid the goddamn golden engine. Wait a minute.<eos> I thought you didn't get emotionally attached to the client.<eos> I'm emotionally attached to me.<eos> Look, I made a bet that this company would grow and my billables would grow with it.
You know you love me.<eos> XOXO Gossip Girl.<eos> The only way to conquer your fear is to face what you fear the most.<eos> You must walk into the belly of the beast and risk the possibility of failure.<eos> But try to hide from the fear, and you risk it swallowing you whole.
What's a shelf company?<eos> It's a corporation that exists only on paper, so its owners can hide their assets.<eos> Isn't that a shell company?<eos> No, it's a shelf company.<eos> Okay, take a shell company, give it a bank account, credit history, tax returns, and let it season for years on a shelf.
Don't play broken peasant with us.<eos> Fair enough.<eos> Five percent for the first month and 15 if you stay longer.<eos> Deal.<eos> Um, we're gonna wanna see the new merch. Get familiar with it.
What do you want to know?<eos> Well, Elijah said that your father was a landowner in Europe.<eos> How did you guys end up here?<eos> My parents had just started a family when a plague struck their homeland.<eos> They lost a child to it.
Queen to King's Bishop seven.<eos> Hey.<eos> You're House, right?<eos> I got these weird pains in my elbows and in my knees--<eos> You know, what's weirder is how the clinic is a large room and you somehow confused me with it.
It looks for malicious intent.<eos> We built it to stop terrorists before they could act.<eos> But a machine doesn't understand the difference between those crimes that are relevant to national security and the ones that are irrelevant.<eos> Irrelevant?<eos> So you taught it the difference?
'Cause I never actually seen one.<eos> One-one time this homeless guy showed me his purple head, but looking back, I'm-I'm not so sure that that was really a military thing.<eos> Pfft.<eos> I didn't want that stupid medal.<eos> You know what I did with it?
You really serious about taking that job at the Stowaway?<eos> Right now, all I'm serious about is taking you to the bedroom.<eos> Then what are you waiting for?<eos> Guilt is a powerful affliction.<eos> You can try to turn your back on it, but that's when it sneaks up behind you and eats you alive.
Unwilling or unable to justify the part they play in it.<eos> Others run away from their guilt, shedding their conscience until there's no conscience left at all.<eos> Help!<eos> But I run toward my guilt.<eos> I feed off of it.
Dad!<eos> What?<eos> That's so cool!<eos> Remember, Klaus, this bike needs a gentle touch, not brutal strength.<eos> Don't worry, I'll kiss it good night every evening.
I have failed it because I thought I was better than Greendale.<eos> See, I went to a university, so I thought it was my job to improve this place.<eos> But it turns out that the only thing wrong with Greendale is that it's run by an insecure wreck who holds five dances and two talent shows a year because he's afraid that the school isn't good enough.<eos> But Greendale is good enough because it accepts me for what I'm not.<eos> Greendale is the best school in the entire world, and I'm so sorry what I've done to it.
But Greendale is good enough because it accepts me for what I'm not.<eos> Greendale is the best school in the entire world, and I'm so sorry what I've done to it.<eos> And I'm sorry what I've done to the ice cream machine.<eos> Aah!<eos> Please, no one eat out of it until you clean the nozzles.
(LAUGHING)<eos> I'm no longer naive enough to be a Jedi.<eos> A new power is rising, I've foreseen it.<eos> The Jedi are going to lose this war, and the Republic will be ripped apart from the inside.<eos> In its place is going to rise a new order, and I will rule as part of it.
The Arcadian has found a way of releasing the beasts from their bindings.<eos> We must destroy this weapon.<eos> But how do we do that, Merlin?<eos> While it was in my possession, I tried everything in my power to destroy it.<eos> So we are to barrel headlong towards a weapon of dark magic so powerful we've no idea what to do with it, should we ever be able to get our hands on it.
today he is gonna announce something special<eos> as you know I'm gonna launch a new movie i wanna introduce a new face<eos> it can be you or you.<eos> Anybody can i tell you for this movie's hero role we are gonna do a big talent hunt<eos> millions of indians will participate in it only one talented actor got his place
Fresh start.<eos> You're serious about this, aren't you?<eos> Yes.<eos> And what about your work?<eos> Well, what about it?
Only lts appearance leaves a little to be desired.<eos> Please, Mr. Judiciary.<eos> Sun ..<eos> Why do not you write d you first?<eos> When I first write it, I take it even possible to write to me first.
You disrespect his memory by wearing his face, but you're nothing like him.<eos> Turns out he was right about most everything.<eos> I just wish I could've told him that while he was still alive.<eos> He wasn't right about anything, Jack.<eos> And when this island drops into the ocean, and you drop with it... you're finally gonna realize that.
You think you can get that boat across the channel in time? Yeah, I can manage.<eos> Good luck to you, James.<eos> Thanks, doc... for everything.<eos> James!<eos> If the island's going down, I'm going down with it.
Where were they when Titus first laid hands on me?<eos> I still carry his child.<eos> Nothings changed, Varro.<eos> The entire world has changed.<eos> And I along with it.
It's midnight, Jack<eos> There's quite a fierce storm going on up here<eos> I have a certain amount of respect<eos> For that atomic bomb<eos> Being right next to it
I would never have bet if I knew Spiro was injured.<eos> - But you did, huh?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Take your winnings.<eos> The whole world's falling apart, and Manchester United with it.
He says you are a very good doctor.<eos> You want something to eat?<eos> I'm cool.<eos> How's work?<eos> You happy with it?
And now you're talking about a seizure disorder?<eos> Which is also not a toxin.<eos> But which is most likely caused by an old injury to the brain.<eos> W-why do you see your past as such a threat?<eos> Not only am I unthreatened by it, I was trying to get it back.
Romantic or not, Charlie was a good person.<eos> One more outburst --<eos> Or what?<eos> Charlie was special.<eos> The world was better because she was in it.
I feel the gravel.<eos> I never slip. I never - I don't<eos> - I never stumble.<eos> I can follow a trail in the dark and never stray off the path.<eos> I live with this world. I'm not just in it, is what I'm sayin'.
there's no one better with a blade.<eos> Nice to meet you.<eos> And this here... is Virgil Junior!<eos> How a man knows, what's inside a woman's stomach, I'll never understand.<eos> It's simple, he put it there, that's how!
That's the kind of guy I'd follow into war.<eos> That's because he was flirting with you the entire time.<eos> Well, it gave me a baseline.<eos> This is a guy who's deploying back to the war in 3 days.<eos> His voice, the pride in it?
- Nothing. My dash.<eos> - I'm in my car, I'm on a road.<eos> - All right, a road.<eos> For you, it's a road.<eos> Follow it, Dean.
I have never shown anyone the proof of my discovery.<eos> In fact... the film was not even developed.<eos> I was obsessed with this new creature.<eos> I tried to chase it down while it leapt from branch to branch.<eos> I tried to communicate with it.
Look.<eos> I feel like I'm running out of ways to explain this to you but once more, I shall try.<eos> This fly is a major problem for us.<eos> It will ruin our batch.<eos> And we need to destroy it and every trace of it so we can cook.
A door.<eos> Why not a door?<eos> Sometimes you get fixated on something, and you might not even get why.<eos> You open yourself up and go with the flow, wherever the universe takes you.<eos> Okay, so the universe took her to a door, and she got all obsessed with it and just had to paint it 20 times until it was perfect.
It is not the Jedi way to take an innocent life.<eos> -Especially if it is the last of its kind.<eos> -Chancellor Palpatine, I think it would be in our best interest to study this creature.<eos> Its outer scales are virtually impenetrable.<eos> None of our weapons could harm it.
- You can't-- you can't be serious.<eos> - Mm, I am.<eos> You're a damn good chef.<eos> I am better than good, but this town beat me.<eos> As much as I love it, I'm not trying to fight with it anymore.
But he does.<eos> I don't know how not returning his calls amounts to some darkness within me.<eos> You don't see it?<eos> The darkness is the past.<eos> And you hold on to it and you dwell.
- No, Your Majesty.<eos> The men all died of the bloody flux.<eos> Dysentery?<eos> I am afraid that there is an outbreak of the disease throughout your army.<eos> God alone knows how many it will take away.
- The hand, Sam. - I know.<eos> Whoever cut off Rosen's didn't take it like they did Porter's.<eos> - Why?<eos> - Didn't need to.<eos> - It wasn't attached to a briefcase.
Yeah, I'll go.<eos> Peter, you can't.<eos> It's too dangerous.<eos> The box is our responsibility, Walter.<eos> And if I can get in front of it, Maybe I can disarm it.
I drove around with her for two hours. We talked like mad.<eos> Then it's time. I take out the gold chain. She accepts it.<eos> I kiss her.<eos> - What a man!<eos> She belongs to me now, get it?
Vanishing bees leave mystery and anxiety in their wake<eos> If we kill the bees there will be no agriculture.<eos> I repeat: no agriculture.<eos> Bees are the pollinator that guarantees the growth and survival of fruits.<eos> The honeybee is important because we depend on it to pollinate 40% of our food, a tremendous amount of what we eat.
So, now with the Colony Collapse Disorder it's clear that Steiner's prediction has come true.<eos> And as Steiner said that<eos> Our very lives depend on beekeeping.<eos> Everybody should be interested in beekeeping.<eos> Our lives depend on it!
Sir, it's illegal to take a bus on that highway.<eos> But--<eos> Sir, do you know that it's illegal to take a bus on this road?<eos> I don't know, man.<eos> You told me to take the West Side Highway, so I'm on it.
Hipsters bathe.<eos> What?<eos> What did you just do to that poor sauce?<eos> It needs more kick.<eos> The only kick it needs is the kick your daddy gave it 36 years ago when he wrote down-- wrote down the recipe on an overturned mop bucket.
What are you talking about?<eos> What college? Are you talking about Dartmouth?<eos> I don't know, Mom, but I'm certainly not telling you.<eos> I am tired of running away from my future.<eos> It's about time that I start running towards it, no matter how far from here it is!
Beautiful.<eos> Yeah. Nothing's changed.<eos> I'm dead.<eos> And the city looks the same.<eos> As far as the world knows, you're no longer in it, but it keeps turning?
Oh, guys are mean.<eos> I missed being in the Brooke bubble.<eos> Well, yeah.<eos> 'Cause it's the best place ever.<eos> Not that I've ever really been out of it.
Why are you here?<eos> Well, they called and said they needed proctors.<eos> I'm on the sub list. - You are?<eos> Since when?<eos> Well, since they cut my hours at the gallery and I'm paying rent to live above it.
And he knew her DNA when he saw it.<eos> It's called a purse, and, as every woman knows, it can hold just about anything.<eos> From a personalized cell phone, to a romance novel,<eos> to much-needed medication.<eos> Whatever you find inside, there's one thing you can be sure of, every purse says something about the woman who owns it,
It's called a purse, and, as every woman knows, it can hold just about anything.<eos> From a bottle for a baby,<eos> to a check for protection,<eos> to a gift for a new friend.<eos> Whatever you find inside, there's one thing you can be sure of, every purse says something about the woman who owns it,
Work work work.<eos> She loves america.<eos> Mel Burke, how do you do it all?<eos> I just do.<eos> When I'm faced with a challenge, I rise to it.
But Barney hasn't done...<eos> Ted, I admire your loyalty.<eos> You've had that hairstyle forever.<eos> You don't care that it's out of fashion or that it's been co-opted by the lesbian community.<eos> You stick with it.
Fine, he was wearing one.<eos> That leaves still two missing. And only one person would have, uh, such a need for such a personal object. - Yuri took them?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I guess, uh, you find a good rug, you, uh, get very connected to it.
oh, no, yeah.<eos> It's a very real concern, actually.<eos> The patient could easily reject the arms, Not just physically but emotionally.<eos> The first-ever hand transplant recipient Ultimately asked to have the hand removed.<eos> Yeah, he said he couldn't connect to it,
A helicopter is sweeping away spruce trees that are becoming infested with bark beetles.<eos> Normandy biologists at the park want to prevent human beings from interfering with the course of nature even when parasites are threatened to destroy the forest.<eos> However owners of neighboring forests naturelovers and everyone who makes a living from tourism here have insited, that exception be made<eos> The infested trees on periphery of the park are being removed to avoid the danger of contamination.<eos> The beetles in Berchtesgaden open up the question to what extent can we leave nature alone and still enjoying it.
Anyway, as a consequence, I was unable to lock myself in the crypt that night. And I found your brother's body in a ditch not far from the house.<eos> He'd been torn to pieces.<eos> I know now it was a mistake to lock up the beast.<eos> Don't you think so, Lawrence?<eos> I should have let it run free.
No.<eos> It's hell.<eos> Hell?<eos> No. The beast is the beast.<eos> Let it run free.
But how can you conquer the world on an empty stomach?<eos> The invention of agriculture turned our history on end.<eos> It was less than 10,000 years ago.<eos> Agriculture was our first great revolution.<eos> It resulted in the first surpluses and gave birth to cities and civilizations.
I'll send you a postcard from Paradise Falls!<eos> We are on our way, Ellie.<eos> It's me, Russell.<eos> What are you doing out here, kid?<eos> I found the snipe and I followed it under your porch.
Well we'll finish them next week, okay?<eos> Use the bathroom before we leave.<eos> Oh, here, use this one here.<eos> How's she doing in school?<eos> Good. She likes it.
-This is an amazing find.<eos> -They're all gone.<eos> I can just show you a little bit how it works.<eos> Basically, a cow is hung from the ceiling, you can see.<eos> Very little of it left, of course, because all these pipes supply the nutrition to the little prawn eggs.
It's not top-secret, major.<eos> I'm meeting Condoleezza for cosmos.<eos> Even I have friends.<eos> Sorry about delegating the music stuff to Chuck.<eos> But an apology is just words if it's not followed up by actions.
It's my little nephew, Bucky.<eos> He OD'd.<eos> Where is Bucky and what has he had?<eos> It's that new drug on the street.<eos> All the kids are falling prey to it.
And we're doing such a damn good job of it.<eos> -Dean--<eos> -I'm tired of burying friends, Sam.<eos> Look, we catch a fresh trail--<eos> And we follow it. I know.
- I know.<eos> - Hey, man.<eos> - Hey.<eos> I brought some beef broth for Kate, and a Family Guy DVD.<eos> She says she doesn't like it, but she just needs to give it a chance.
Rejecting religion.<eos> But when it comes right down to it,I'm sitting here prayingfor a miracle to spare my wife.<eos> It may not be a miracle,but I think I know a wayI can help her.<eos> Adam baylin's formula.<eos> - From the pod.I can inject it...
My ashes were spread over grass I had once walked on,<eos> beneath trees that had once given me shade, on top of roses I once admired,<eos> and beside fences I once gossiped over.<eos> And after my friends had finished saying goodbye, a wind came along and took what was left of me into the air.<eos> As I looked down on the world, I began to let go of it.
Seriously, she's the Midwestern Mother Teresa.<eos> Impossible, Hazel. Your methods of inquiry must be as tired as your hair.<eos> We've searched everywhere.<eos> My fingers are raw.<eos> When the truth fails you, you have no choice but to abandon it.
Don't move.<eos> Last week a teenage kid gets caught with a gun in his locker.<eos> He was 15 years old.<eos> Where did he get it?<eos> What was he going to do with it?
Get back!<eos> Arthur!<eos> Arthur!<eos> Get away from her, nigger! Get back!<eos> 'It's said, military training is not just to prepare men for battle, 'but make them long for it.
Just my mom, and I never saw my dad again.<eos> And then when I got back england, w-when I would ask my mum about this place, yeah?<eos> But she would say that it wasn't real and that I'd made it up.<eos> that's why... I became an anthropologist-- to find this island again.<eos> It's what I've been searching for my whole life.
Do you have any other names?<eos> Hans von Rottinger, Frederick Clinton.<eos> One is dead, the other has retired.<eos> Both were active in the group during the '70 and '80s.<eos> Can we give it a working title?
Billy, Zoe, I'm analyzing the aftermath of the fire.<eos> You certain it was arson?<eos> Yes, and I have isolated the accelerant.<eos> Whoever set the blaze left a chemically significant trail.<eos> Can you follow it?
Mm-hm.<eos> We should take a look at this.<eos> It describes some cognitive techniques that I think you'll find really helpful. Breathing?<eos> It's really helpful in relieving stress, panic. And definitely fear.<eos> You know, we'd start by figuring out exactly what it is you're afraid of, and then we can isolate that fear, work with it, confront it.
Listen, learn, don't get involved.<eos> Whenever somebody else comes to the island, The others essentially, sort of like hermit crabs, Wipe them out and start to use their stuff.<eos> So they have access to satellites, And they live in houses and have little book club meetings And this submarine that used to go between the island<eos> And back to the real world, So they're able to sort of leave the island at their own will. And they're very unhappy about the fact that these survivors<eos> There's an uneasy truce that exists for a while. This is our island, and the only reason you're living on it Is 'cause we let you live on it.
The power source went dead.<eos> Th's all we have.<eos> For reasons that we don't quite know, the island is invisible.<eos> If you fly over it, you can't see it.<eos> You know, uh, satellites can't take pictures of it.
Right, thanks, bye.<eos> Arnold, that's very exciting.<eos> How'd you get him?<eos> Let me tell you something, Ron.<eos> There is a simple formula for success, and I followed it.
I've never wanted to answer people who asked me if it was a real penetration because this is a matter of the work of the actor.<eos> Thinking back about the movie I can say that it was particularly distressing because in my naivety I thought about how to make this intercourse believable by showing the sexual act but also the rest right after the ejaculation and the tenderness towards such an improbable partner.<eos> It was necessary to show the sexuality like a real adventure in his humanity.<eos> At the end of movie we see the ladder.<eos> We see it for the first time when he uses it to retrieve the sow after its suicide when it threw itself into the pit - which is also the heart of the garden - ...and entered into the ground, we could say through that pit.
Duct of Wirsung slightly enlarged, but within normal parameters.<eos> Say something.<eos> It's mute.<eos> It can't communicate with you.<eos> Maybe you should try communicating with it.
It's just a wonderful way to see the world and pursue this ancient mysteries.<eos> And it trully was I think the catalyst for what people like I do today, and that is to talk about the mysteries, and the unusual and the paranormal.<eos> He path a way for all about us to talk about these strange stories, and that continues to grow and it's gonna get bigger and bigger and bigger.<eos> People want answers, to questions that they can't answer themselves.<eos> But in spite of the book's enormeous popularity, or perhaps because of it, Von Däniken's theories were scorn by scientists, and * by the theologians.
and if the fine folks only thought just how poets beautifully waste their time<eos> to me, they would at last...<eos> What's going on out there<eos> Never got out of the city, did you?<eos> Brauth and me, we have already spent here many years. a strange atmosphere in the area, but we became one with it.
Also known as bull nettle, the Devil's tomato, and my personal favorite, the apple of Sodom.<eos> MARYANN: It's quite poisonous.<eos> But in the tiniest of doses, a savory addition to any wine-based sauce.<eos> Mmm.<eos> Gives it a pungent hint of madness.
Others sip it contemplating a man they might be in love with.<eos> But for one woman on this particular morning, that cup of coffee has to wait.<eos> Because she discovers a neighbor in trouble.<eos> She goes to help not only because it's the right thing to do, but because it's the only way she can think of to ask for forgiveness.<eos> And once it is given, the day begins.
Right, because even though you're sorry, you're still a huge snob with a huge ego who thinks his time is too precious to spend, uh, five minutes talking about someone who's just a homeless guy.<eos> That's not the reason.<eos> Then why can't you do it?<eos> Because I'm not allowed to, okay?<eos> There's an ongoing investigation, and I'm a part of it.
It's a personality thing.<eos> Okay, yeah, I've seen you long enough to see that you're good, but you hang back, you watch, you decide.<eos> I don't stand outside a room watching my life pass me by, and I won't stand by and watch this patient die.<eos> This isn't about lawsuits or red tape or hospital bureaucracy.<eos> This is about a girl who came to us for help and we couldn't give it.
I'm listening. She is a cruel, wicked creature.<eos> She keeps me in chains.<eos> She hurts me.<eos> Her magic.<eos> I can't escape it.
At least I couldn't get knocked up.<eos> - For the work.<eos> - No, it's a gift.<eos> But I'd commissioned it.<eos> If you don't want it, send it or take it to Rita.
They... what, they expected violence?<eos> Well, convergence theory says that if crowds act aggressively, it's because people bring an aggressive mindset to it.<eos> And in the close-ups, you can see their faces.<eos> They're identical to those of athletes during competition.<eos> This crowd was a powder keg and somebody in it was the spark.
The Führer and Goebbels' propaganda have said pretty much the same thing.<eos> But where our conclusions differ, is I don't consider the comparison an insult.<eos> Consider for a moment the world a rat lives in.<eos> It's a hostile world, indeed.<eos> If a rat were to scamper through your front door, right now, would you greet it with hostility?
No one from the outside could have got anywhere near him.<eos> It was someone on the inside.<eos> And we can trust no one.<eos> Holy Father when I was young, You told me the voice in my heart was God's voice.<eos> You said I should follow it, no matter how painful.
He had enacted a law, which exacted death for a certain crime unless the offender was a virgin.<eos> Now, when a virgin eventually appeared on the charge the emperor didn't know exactly how to proceed.<eos> So one of his council proposed the perfect solution:<eos> Let her first be deflowered so she then can be devoured.<eos> There are some and, no, I won't name them who first procure you for the coronation next to preach at it, and then to write books defending it.
We don't know each other well, but we shall.<eos> I've every confidence.<eos> It is His Majesty's pleasure to appoint you a gentleman of the privy chamber.<eos> In that capacity, you will attend His Majesty daily and as he sees fit to use you.<eos> It is, you will understand, a special and privileged position.
You are no longer commander.<eos> As long as I am leader of this group, you will obey my commands.<eos> There will be no complaining, no sitting, no doing nothing.<eos> Anyone who wants to leave, leave now!<eos> Take his body into the woods. Leave it for the wolves.
-Good morning, Mayor. -Morning.<eos> But in my village there was a peculiar tradition.<eos> A tradition that should have led everyone to happiness.<eos> No one remembered how it started.<eos> But everyone followed it without questioning it.
Then here's what I'll do.<eos> No one will interfere with your mission.<eos> You won't even see us.<eos> But do this one thing for me.<eos> When you return to the mainland, tell someone in authority that here is an island and on it is a man who's desperate to get to his home and the ones he loves.
It's cursed.<eos> Then burying it will not help.<eos> Hmm.<eos> My fortune lies elsewhere and my purpose is clear.<eos> Here there is an island and on it is a man who is sick with desire to return to his home and the ones that he loves.
Cats, you know, are of no use for chasing for, not knowing the rules, they invariably climb up trees, a habit I find contemptible.<eos> Horses, on the other hand, understand the rules perfectly and enter the business in good spirit.<eos> But of all the creatures that a dog can chase, none exceed sheep for sheer pleasure.<eos> Their fear drifts in clouds behind them and you breathe it in as you run along, so you become quite intoxicated by it.<eos> it's as if one is not so much running but flying on it.
Come on.<eos> Let's go.<eos> We're going to Vegas!<eos> We've been driving over an hour and we haven't even seen the main highway yet.<eos> That's because we're running exactly parallel to it, sweetheart.
You know, like the TV show.<eos> You're way too young to know about that show.<eos> It's on DVD.<eos> My mom's friend watches it all the time.<eos> - What do you think of it?
- Unless there was another false image.<eos> - Hang on, hang on.<eos> Everything about her was a lie.<eos> All of her vital signs were a false image.<eos> She can fool the equipment, tell it what we're expecting to see, so she gets scared and it projects an increased heart rate, we try and freeze it and it does the opposite.
Of what I can be.<eos> Fix it.<eos> I don't know a thing about watches.<eos> If you wannaearn how to access my ability,fix the watch.<eos> Stlien to it.
- I can't.<eos> Stop.<eos> You think you can hold me with a power?<eos> Not only can I hold you, I can kill you.<eos> I'm going to dig inside your head, find your worst fear, and make it eat you alive.
Where that freakin' gooey head pops right out of her- bobby.<eos> - Yeah, charlie.<eos> - Murder weapon?<eos> - Haven't found it yet.<eos> I'm back looking for it.
Really.<eos> Life Season02 Episode06 'Did You Feel That?<eos> '<eos> Chasing after the world brings only chaos.<eos> Allowing it to come to be brings only peace.
This time, it has to work for me.<eos> I'm not going to give it any choice.<eos> Okay, if you've got anything you need to say to Owen, now's your chance.<eos> Owen... it's Jack, can you hear me?<eos> Owen, hear my voice, get a hold of it, let it draw you out, pull you out.
I got a new gig, eh?<eos> I'm chief of security for Mark Moran, eh?<eos> Nah, it's true.<eos> I got big plans, mate.<eos> I'm gonna take this town by the scruff of the neck and shake the shit out of it.
Keep her on 15 liters.<eos> - Pulse ox, 85, tachy at 135.<eos> Set up for intubation.<eos> Drop, etomidate and sux.<eos> - I'm doing it.
AIDS isn't as big a deal as it used to be.<eos> There are advances in treatment.<eos> Not a big deal?<eos> Is that how everyone feels?<eos> People need to understand the seriousness of this illness and the bravery of the people who struggle with it!
No problem.<eos> You said you had a break in the case?<eos> You heard Nazir got popped?<eos> We found the slug.<eos> Now all you need is the gun to match it with.
I'm in pain, yet I'm immersed in a sea of bliss.<eos> I'm one great joy.<eos> I hear...<eos> "My daughter, your soul no longer lives.<eos> "It is I who lives in it."
Molecular reassembly halted.<eos> Impact imminent.<eos> Billy,open the damn doors!<eos> I can't override the emergency system.<eos> Billy,if the door's not opened immediately, I will crash into it.
I don't like to sleep.<eos> Not when I'm awake.<eos> It says in your file that you're an insomniac.<eos> What else does it say in my file?<eos> Not much. considering I've been writing it for ten years.
The tortoise.<eos> What tortoise?<eos> It was on its back by the side of the road in Mexico.<eos> -Your mother turned it over.<eos> -She was helping it.
We took her victim.<eos> She had to complete His work.<eos> Hotchner: Wendell berry said,<eos> "the past is our definition.<eos> "we may strive with good reason To escape it "or to escape what is bad in it, But we will escape it Only by adding something Better to it."
But...maybe now.<eos> Hopefully.<eos> She gonna be ok?<eos> Yeah, she'll be fine.<eos> Maybe you got to sit With the past before You can walk away from it.
Even so, minimal casualties may be enough to prevent you from breaking Grievous' defenses.<eos> Master Plo is right.<eos> With Grievous on that ship's bridge, it's bound to be well protected.<eos> Don't worry, Ahsoka.<eos> We'll destroy that bridge, and Grievous along with it.
My Wife Will say, get my keys out of my purse.<eos> I'm like, I ain't touching that thing.<eos> I've heard noises coming out of there.<eos> It's evil. I've seen you pull farm tools out of that.<eos> She shake her purse, nothing comes out. Then reach in, 'look, a bowling ball'. There it is.
The Pool of Etoch.<eos> Look deep.<eos> Leave no survivors!<eos> You're on your own, kid.<eos> We cannot change the past. But we can choose what we learn from it.
Help me!<eos> Somebody, please help me!<eos> Save me!<eos> Please save me!<eos> We cannot change the past but we can choose what we learn from it.
You'd have made your father proud!<eos> It's ready, Tony!<eos> Get off the roof!<eos> How ironic, Tony!<eos> Trying to rid the world of weapons, you gave it its best one ever!
What do you want?<eos> Tell me your name.<eos> Follow me.<eos> Your father left you this map.<eos> In it, he said, lies the secret to the location of the Golden Army.
Keep going.<eos> Keep going.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> You should have seen this city when it was alive.<eos> What happened to it?
After all, he's just a mask.<eos> Tonight is the final leg of the Death Race, and perhaps a new champion will arise.<eos> A five times winner.<eos> The first man ever to gain his freedom.<eos> The world gave you to me because you were not fit to be a part of it.
- Yeah, I'll have a bucket.<eos> Aphrodite's spa?<eos> Well, I thought you didn't want boatloads of tourists.<eos> Oh, no, not boatloads, no. But, you know, a few more would be nice.<eos> Okay, now, the thing about the toilet, if it doesn't flush right away, just go and come back in a while, and it should...
You think that's funny?<eos> Well, yeah.<eos> But, that's impossible.<eos> No, we did have a future.<eos> You're standing on it.
Yes, you are.<eos> So Emily is what, like, your college sweetheart?<eos> - It's amazing how you do that.<eos> - What?<eos> The way you take the simplest statement, and then you twist it with a completely negative connotation.
And these are your battle buddies.<eos> Gilligan was the one on the box with the wires.<eos> He was accused of killing two CID agents.<eos> It was his box.<eos> He had to hold it, he had to stand on it.
For the map?<eos> Probably.<eos> So did you find out?<eos> It's gotta be the Qing Dynasty treasure map.<eos> Not only the bandits, but the Japanese army's after it.
- Sentimental things.<eos> A piece of hair from our dog.<eos> Some tickets to the operas my father had taken me to.<eos> It wasn't stolen for its contents.<eos> It was the tin itself that was valuable, what you could do with it.
And so is the Quorum.<eos> I guess I just finished the shortest presidency in colonial history.<eos> Yes, well, don't look so relieved, Mr Adama.<eos> Because you were dealt a crisis, and you knew exactly what to do.<eos> You faced it boldly.
-But you have to come with me right now.<eos> -The baby isn't Jin's.<eos> I'm gonna look at your baby And determine the date of conception.<eos> If you got pregnant here...<eos> We'll cross that bridge when we come to it.
Meet Kevin Johnson.<eos> You're joining the crew in Fiji as a deckhand.<eos> You want me to go undercover?<eos> Why the hell would I go back to work for you people?<eos> Because if Widmore finds the island, it's good night for everybody on it.
Just ask him to wait a little longer. - I just scrubbed in.<eos> - O'Malley, ask him!<eos> Yes, ma'am.<eos> A person can only rise so high.<eos> Now, I'm rising above, but there's a ceiling and I'm about to hit it! - [machine beeping]
All right, I'll check in on you later.<eos> I'll be inside if you need me, all right?<eos> Kyle... living here alone, I've... relied on both of them over the years.<eos> Taylor's managed to turn my dreams into reality.<eos> He brings any useful ideas I have to the outside world, and it's Foss' job to protect me from it.
You've a lot to learn.<eos> I won't be able to, not in this house.<eos> Kyle, you can't go back to the Tragers.<eos> If I stay here, safe but shut in, I might as well have stayed inside that tank.<eos> I won't be able to touch the world like Adam said if I'm not part of it.
Me, here...<eos> Were you really trying to do something good for no other reason than to help me?<eos> I was being selfish.<eos> I'd love to tell myself I was being unselfish but I know deep down in my primal sweet spot I was being unselfish for selfish reasons.<eos> I just thought, my world would be a better place if you were in it.
As a matter of fact, he did.<eos> Ockham's!<eos> Bless you.<eos> Thank you.<eos> The windmill... what happened to it?
I fear this is the only solution.<eos> Your secret is safe with me.<eos> Go with god, my friend.<eos> There are many ways to define Our fragile existence.<eos> Many ways to give it meaning.
Nathan and I are very different people.<eos> I don't see how his decision has anything to do with my wanting to get back to work.<eos> So you think you can put this tragedy behind you?<eos> Never.<eos> But I can be motivated by it.
What she did to Kim.<eos> What did Beverly do to Kim?<eos> So you think you can put this tragedy behind you?<eos> Never.<eos> But I can be motivated by it.
Who thinks about her?<eos> Maybe she'll go with Draper, too.<eos> It's a tragedy.<eos> Piece of fruit that went real bad real fast.<eos> And no one ever got to eat it.
...and a good soul.<eos> We've got a lot of support and we're gonna all keep working until we locate this child.<eos> Neighbors quick to lend a helping hand to anyone in their hour of need.<eos> I deliver meals to them, but my life has been so blessed that this is just the least that I can do.<eos> They say that you can judge a society by how it treats those who are the worst off.
I thought you was a goner.<eos> Drop your weapons!<eos> –Dr Hatcher, no!<eos> –Shut up, Danny.<eos> I brought you into this world, I think it's rather fitting I should be the one to take you out of it.
It's too tough for me. But history is what unites us.<eos> Each one of us is also a history.<eos> We carry it inside, in the deepest part of our memory.<eos> Yes, I like history.<eos> To know. And also to protect myself from it.
I had a job again.<eos> I visited her more than she visited me.<eos> We had more time together out there.<eos> It was just her and me. And a lot of fish.<eos> Should we boil it or fry it? Boil or fry?
Yes, but we will leave it at that.<eos> It is good, you are punctual.<eos> I like punctuality.<eos> His Majesty says it is the courtesy of kings.<eos> For me, it's the most polite flattery.
- Oh, really?<eos> Why didn't you come...<eos> Not about the motivation, just about knowing where to look.<eos> We got a compass bearing.<eos> And I'm pretty sure if we follow it,
And I'll be able to keep it hidden from their satellites until we've hit the target.<eos> Good. I'll contact you again once we are out of the area.<eos> Sir, I was just talking to Bill Buchanan at CTU.<eos> They were tracking one of the drones.<eos> They've now lost visual contact with it.
- Bill, what happened?<eos> Gredenko escaped.<eos> But not before launching one of the drones.<eos> How close is the Air Force to intercepting it?<eos> F-16s were minutes away, then the drone disappeared from the satellite grid; we're still looking for it.
Kenneth...<eos> Have you ever used bronzer?<eos> Dr. Spaceman, when they check my DNA, will they tell me what diseases I might get or help me to remember my ATM pin code?<eos> Absolutely.<eos> Science is whatever we want it to be.
What are you going to do to me?<eos> I'm gonna look at your baby and determine the D.O.C.--<eos> Um,date of conception.<eos> The ultrasound will tell me when you got pregnant,give or take a day.<eos> If you got pregnant off the island,then you and your baby will probably be okay, but if you got pregnant here... we'll cross that bridge when we come to it.
There were only two choices.<eos> Since yours was wrong, mine must've been right.<eos> Either that or we missed the leprechaun.<eos> If you're right, there's nothing to be done.<eos> The steroid treatment we gave her means when the next infection hits, it'll hit hard.
In my life there was a massive...<eos> I introduced Neubauten to sequencers and sampling.<eos> I was able to bring some of the work I'd done with Neubauten to highlight some sounds, melodies and textures of the Depeche work.<eos> So there was a big crossover.<eos> Technology was moving really fast, and we used it.
I know I can.<eos> She's standing there in front of me right now.<eos> - Why are you telling me all this? - Why am I telling you this?<eos> Because in the middle of blowing up the gas station, killing the marine and kidnapping, I had a great idea.<eos> In fact, it's such a great idea that I even came up with a name for it.
I wanna apologize, before we start... if what I say frightens you or makes you uncomfortable. I'll be fine.<eos> No, you will not be fine.<eos> What I have to teach will be frightening.<eos> The truth is an acquired taste.<eos> But once you get to it. That's all you ever want.
It's in your blood.<eos> But movies are different.<eos> Deena, you know why I chose you to sing lead?<eos> Because your voice has no personality, no depth.<eos> Except for what I put in it.
It's in your left.<eos> - Well! - A lucky guess, perhaps.<eos> You have a confederate who signals you.<eos> It's more primitive than that. Uh-huh.<eos> When you raise your hand to your head, the blood drains from it.
Is there some special school where you people learn to talk that bollocks?<eos> Do, please, stay in touch.<eos> You take care now.<eos> This man is going to kill the president.<eos> So Nicholas walks up to that cow and he shoots it in the head.
I'm sure that'll calm down.<eos> My brother, my brother...<eos> Many, many years ago, in a sad, faraway land, there was an enormous mountain made of rough, black stone.<eos> At sunset, on top of that mountain, a magic rose blossomed every night that made whoever plucked it immortal.<eos> But no one dared go near it because its thorns were full of poison.
- Yeah, we make do.<eos> - My name is Olivia Wenscombe...<eos> - I know who you are.<eos> You here to steal my show?<eos> I'm here to give it what it's missing. - Yeah?
I'm sorry if I frightened you.<eos> I've used up a little too much of the forest's power you see...<eos> What do you think of this world?<eos> It is a world that those who survived the destruction worked desperately to create.<eos> As someone who knew the civilizations of the past I'll bet it looks harsh but Agito and I both live here in this world and we love it.
Keep everything that's in there.<eos> I just need to get my key card back.<eos> What key card?<eos> My CTU access card.<eos> It's of no value to you. It just lets me in and out of this building.
Health benefits, rations and fair compensation.<eos> Yes, we have a vital responsibility. Okay.<eos> There comes a time when you realise that the engine you've built with your blood and your sweat and your tears is being used for something so foul, so perverted that it makes you sick in your heart.<eos> And it's then that you must throw your body on the gears and on the levers and on the machine itself and make it stop.<eos> And we have to show the people who run it, the people who control it, that unless we're free, that machine will be prevented from working at all!
- Jesus, Nate, have you even slept?<eos> - Not now.<eos> Not before our first home game.<eos> Now, look, Nate, your shoulder is in bad shape.<eos> The rest is gonna do it some good.
That he hijacked the plane?<eos> Not exactly.<eos> He has control of the cabin. The pilot is landing the plane.<eos> What about that recording?<eos> He's still looking for it, but there's no guarantee he'll find it before the plane lands.
Your own countries tremble before China.<eos> What will Mali do?<eos> I believe that cotton production has had its day.<eos> Besides, with the prices of products that come from China and copy our textiles, there is no major stake for us in the cotton debate.<eos> "ln an inevitably open world, "we must civilize globalization "and give it a meaning."
"Soon" may only be a matter of minutes.<eos> You see right here?<eos> According to these, if I cut through, there'd be actuator coils underneath.<eos> It's Wraith tech, so it's more like actuator veins.<eos> Now, if I can isolate the primary conduit I can follow it back to the core.
- You can't actually turn it off?<eos> - I never said that.<eos> Well, what did you say?<eos> Look, the control console is shot to hell.<eos> I was telling Teyla, I'll have to bypass it isolate the primary actuator conduit, follow it to the core.
Excuse me.<eos> There's a line, buddy.<eos> There's two lines.<eos> No, no, there's one line.<eos> We're in it.
The climax.<eos> I live off that energy.<eos> Right, sorry, just to recap.<eos> You've travelled here to feed off orgasmic energy?<eos> There's nothing else out there like it.
You said something about Catalina being half-naked, and I...<eos> I lost it again.<eos> Sometimes Randy gets trapped in his own brain loop.<eos> It also happens when he watches Back to the Future.<eos> When he finally popped out of it, we went to talk to Catalina.
Examine her faith.<eos> What's your analysis, Doctor?<eos> I'm a scientist.<eos> And as a scientist, I believe that if God exists our knowledge of him is imperfect. Why? The stories and myths we have are the products of men, the passage of time.<eos> The religion you practise is based on a theory, impossible to prove, yet you bestow it with absolutes like, "There is no such thing as coincidence."
I'm not giving it to the cops.<eos> Jail's too good for him.<eos> I'm giving it to you.<eos> You're the only person who can understand how I feel.<eos> And you can do with it,with him,what you want.
Fine, but if you expect anything more from me than forced civility, you will be deeply disappointed.<eos> Bree, this salmon is superb.<eos> Well, thank you! It did win me the blue ribbon at the gourmet county cookoff.<eos> I just love the sauce.<eos> What gives it that kick?
We're not gonna make it, are we?<eos> - Not without doping.<eos> - You guys, don't talk like that!<eos> Think of the bridge.<eos> We'll never be able to look it in the l-bar again if we let it down.
you shouldn't have been doing a lot of the things we did this afternoon,but,uh, neither of us has been smited down yet.<eos> I'd imagine your cousin'll be pretty surprised to hear about the money her uncle left her.<eos> You can be certain of it.<eos> Sam,I hope you don't mind me asking,but,um, your hand.<eos> What happened to it?
Some men fancied that they represented the future of that new America, but it was men and women like Robert and Clara who would come to embody its true spirit.<eos> Their pluck and determination would be sorely tested<eos> - in the years that lay ahead.<eos> ...we celebrate here today.<eos> Bless this majestic road and all those who ride upon it.
They won't come back.<eos> This is not your world, Will!<eos> You know, don't you?<eos> The story, it's happening to us now.<eos> We're living it.
What are you doing, Debraj?<eos> You've just had your eyes operated.<eos> And now what are you doing holding a dying bulb?<eos> This bulb is dying, Ms. Nair.<eos> I need to stand by it Am I right?
I did it all at school.<eos> We were learning about colors.<eos> There's a new color.<eos> Oh, come on.<eos> Cut it out!
She said, open the door.<eos> You could have taken over his life, but you chose to come back.<eos> You truly are unique, Six Echo.<eos> My name is Lincoln!<eos> I brought you into this world and I can take you out of it.
Not my idea.<eos> Doctor's orders.<eos> Heart condition.<eos> "Angina, " he calls it.<eos> I'm polishing my badge, getting myself used to the idea of saying goodbye to it.
- High speed. - All right.<eos> Think you can fill that, son?<eos> I could fill a goddamn trash can, sir.<eos> You're full of piss and vinegar, aren't you, Jim? Yes, sir.<eos> Hey, unload that shit before you clown with it, okay? I don't want my head blown off just when I'm getting it straight. Pop!
Do you think it is all over now ?<eos> If your work is to right wrongs and to erase injustices, then mine is to help the departed find their path to heaven.<eos> To right wrongs ?<eos> You spoke of the disease called Simheoro.<eos> If you can't escape that well, you might suffer from it forever.
From angels bending near the earth To touch their harps of gold<eos> Peace on the earth, goodwill to men From heaven's all gracious king<eos> The world in solemn stillness lay<eos> At the end of one year and the beginning of the next... we must ask ourselves how we may best serve God... in the months ahead.<eos> The world is changing and we must change with it.
By the time you reach Sumpu, you'II have no home to return to!<eos> You gave them a map?<eos> Now, the Lord of Lords... shines his light over the entire land.<eos> How can one accept villages hidden deep and unreachable?<eos> Our fate is to live in darkness, and to die in it.
Now you built McLennen-Forster from scratch.<eos> Everything you have is tied up in it.<eos> If this comes out, your name will be synonymous with what happened today- terrorism, treason.<eos> Well, what do you want me to do, John, lie to the government? Look, if I knew 24 hours ago what I know now, I would've done whatever it took to stop today's attack.<eos> But there's nothing we can do now except protect ourselves and keep this company from going under, which it will do if CTU finds out the truth about Marwan.
Aleksander, tell the team to meet us at Teuge airfield.<eos> You wanted to see me?<eos> I was thinking, the embassy transmission that Kradic intercepted...<eos> The network tap he installed would've had to be physically placed on the premises.<eos> - It would be risky to retrieve it afterwards, so we can assume it stores the information.
I'm sorry to drop by unannounced.<eos> Do you have a moment?<eos> Sure.<eos> So what can I do for you?<eos> Well, my daughter is planning on giving you her virginity and I would consider it a favour if you wouldn't take it.
Yeah, sure.<eos> Of course.<eos> But the thing is, this island -<eos> uh... is, uh, finding it again might be hard.<eos> Can't we fly around and look for it?
You busted mommy.<eos> This soup is great.<eos> It's like a cross between lentil and chili.<eos> It's wonderful.<eos> It's the bacon that gives it the flavor.
I'll come back later.<eos> [RAT SCREECHING]<eos> [CAT MEOWS]<eos> BOY: I'm warning you, Hermione.<eos> Keep that beast away from Scabbers, or I'll turn it into a tea cozy.
Shakespeare.<eos> I don't follow the Premier League.<eos> This is opening night for Milos.<eos> Everything in life is a stage.<eos> But different things happen on it.
Last Sunday, the Führer wanted to help me escape.<eos> But you know your mother.<eos> We have the same blood.<eos> I won't even think about it.<eos> Our ideology's going down the drain and with it everything that made life beautiful and worthwhile.
She's feisty.<eos> Isn't it beautiful?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Is it enough? Of course it is.<eos> Some people say the only way to rid yourself of temptation is to yield to it.
How could you have sent her?<eos> She's blind.<eos> She's more capable than most in this village and she is led by love.<eos> The world moves for love.<eos> It kneels before it in awe.
I don't know how they got there. - Right!<eos> You're so full of it!<eos> - Face it, Larry, we're both bullshitters!<eos> But my camera isn't. It doesn't know how to lie.<eos> It only shows you what's put right in front of it.
I wanted to do the Hitchcock picture to end all Hitchcock pictures.<eos> We think of that film as a journey from New York City across country ending up in South Dakota at Mount Rushmore.<eos> It's actually a journey through Cary Grant's various persona aspects and of all the career things that he's done over the years.<eos> A seamless blend of romance, comedy and suspense North By Northwest begins production on August 26, 1958.<eos> The beauty of the plot is that, even though it's absurd you're completely caught up in it.
You have returned very suddenly from London, Mademoiselle.<eos> There's a party for Midge and Edward, who, believe it or not, are getting married.<eos> Why, did you think the murderer would return to the scene of the crime?<eos> You know, it did seem to me, from the very beginning, that either this crime was very simple, so simple that it was very difficult to believe in its simplicity, or it was very complex.<eos> And it is to say that we are contending against a mind that is able of inventions that are intricate and ingenious. So that every time we seem to be heading towards the truth, we're actually being led away from it.
The moment it makes it into the bloodstream... it finds its way to different centers or different parts of the body.<eos> Now, every single cell in the body...<eos> - has these receptors on the outside.<eos> Now one cell can have thousands of receptors... studding its surface, kind of opening up to the outside world.<eos> And when a peptide docks on a cell... it literally, uh, like a key going into a lock... sits on the receptor surface and attaches to it... and kind of moves the receptor... and kind oflike a doorbell buzzing, sends a signal into the cell.
Good.<eos> How about No.8?<eos> There it is...<eos> let me attract its attention.<eos> Deunan you approach it from below.
Not that I am aware of, no.<eos> So, why should the murderer take the stole before the event?<eos> After all, nobody knew that Mademoiselle de Bellefort et Monsieur Doyle were going to... have a scene.<eos> Perhaps he found it when he went in to get the pistol.<eos> Why was it not discovered when the search for it was made?
Collé, have you gone mad?<eos> How dare you expel my elder from my house?<eos> Young brother, have you given up your authority as a husband?<eos> Purification dates way back.<eos> It is required by Islam, and you woman want to put an end to it.
- Hello, Alan.<eos> - Mr President. That brother of yours is going to be your undoing.<eos> - I am not firing my brother.<eos> - That's too bad. I have no intention of losing my healthcare bill.<eos> I spent two years putting it together.
I think Wyatt is more concerned with nursery school right now<eos> - than Magic School.<eos> - Are you sure?<eos> Paige said he orbed back in front of the door.<eos> He was drawn to it.
- You see this little hole?<eos> This moth's just about to emerge.<eos> It's in there right now, struggling.<eos> It's digging its way through the thick hide of the cocoon.<eos> Now, I could help it -- take my knife,
Experience the dream journeys of the fabled australian outback.<eos> You have no right taking that off my desk.<eos> So you wander around hunting and gathering food, right?<eos> On foot?<eos> Not that you would understand, but a walkabout is a journey of spiritual renewal where one derive strength from the earth and becomes inseparable from it.
Yeah, sure.<eos> And we also need to reverify all the stops she made<eos> - when she was running her errands.<eos> - Now that one's gonna cost you.<eos> We need to find the murder weapon and tie it to Seeger.
- That's crazy.<eos> - Why else would it be corroding the ship?<eos> Because the gases are corrosive.<eos> Or maybe we somehow offended it when we flew inside of it.<eos> The point is, if we talk to it... maybe it'll let us go.
What?<eos> Well, actually, the bird lady's kind of right about that.<eos> Well, half right.<eos> You don't just kill love.<eos> You stalk it, you toy with it, then you kill it.
You really think so?<eos> We're going to head to the farming areas now.<eos> What is it you are saying?<eos> The peasants have never seen the capital.<eos> That's why they fear it.
We were happy there.<eos> Father.<eos> I'm waiting and I'm ready.<eos> To know the future is to be trapped by it.<eos> But knowing there's a trap is the first step in evading it.
The children!<eos> - They are safe, Muad'dib.<eos> I meddled in the future, in all possible futures... trying to create them.<eos> Instead, they created me, and I became trapped by it.<eos> Yes, but knowing there's a trap is the first step in evading it.
Reverend Mother!<eos> I bring you a warning.<eos> The blessings of Muad'Dib have been corrupted.<eos> The religion of Muad'Dib is not Muad'Dib.<eos> He renounces it as he renounces you.
Now you must make the final sacrifice.<eos> You must give up your name.<eos> I have already forgotten it, Master.<eos> The Scroll of the Ultimate.<eos> Whoever reads its words out loud in their entirety... will gain the power to control the world... and turn it into a paradise or a living hell.
- No one knows.<eos> Alexander found it by using a map that is with the box, a map he then hid from the world.<eos> But the name he gave this map was "Mati", and the literal translation for the word "Mati" is eye.<eos> The orb is the map, hidden in the Luna Temple by Alexander.<eos> And Reiss will use it to find the Pandora's box, and when he does, when he opens it, he will unleash a weapon more powerful than you could ever imagine.
So this rock is the map?<eos> Yes, it is.<eos> I've never seen anything like it.<eos> And it's the only way to find that box?<eos> I'm trust that you could take it now and walk out the door. No.
We spent 'em and traded 'em, and frittered 'em away on drink and food and pleasurable company.<eos> The more we gave 'em away, the more we came to realise... the drink would not satisfy.<eos> Food turned to ash in our mouths, and all the pleasurable company in the world could not slake our lust.<eos> We are cursed men, Miss Turner.<eos> Compelled by greed we were, but now... we are consumed by it.
The good thing about Astrid is that she lives in this life.<eos> You should do the same.<eos> Or at least try to.<eos> You can't turn a turtle into a racehorse.<eos> But you can turn it into a fast turtle.
Can you make a girl cry on her wedding day?<eos> Laugh when you're sad?<eos> Keep silent 10 years!<eos> Madness! Just been on to Margaret about her insurance.<eos> I mean, I only did it as a favor.
We knew about the bomb weeks ago.<eos> Thank you, Simmons.<eos> What do you mean, "knew"?<eos> We let it in the country.<eos> Tracked it all the way.
- Then what?<eos> Your defence policy is too passive.<eos> - You need more resources.<eos> - You're trying to hijack my presidency. No, no, no.<eos> I'd like to give it some balls.
If you take me back... I'd be willing to forget this ever happened.<eos> You can either be quiet or spend the rest of this trip unconscious.<eos> Which do you prefer?<eos> This microbe is more resilient than I thought.<eos> It doesn't seem to be vulnerable to theta radiation.
-Well, I'm not.<eos> They've already taken 24 people.<eos> I'm not going to give them another one.<eos> You've told me you trust my judgement.<eos> Trust it now, unless you have another suggestion.
See, I decided this morning to cooperate with the F.B.I.<eos> - to help them convict Keller.<eos> - Oh?<eos> And now, with Keller dead... that opportunity is gone.<eos> And with it my chance for freedom.
He had been executed three months before.<eos> After that, I hung it all up.<eos> Now I try to save the world from my living room.<eos> But at least I know nobody's gonna die because of me.<eos> I know you can't undo the past... but you can't hide from it, either.
Remember?<eos> - They beat the shit out of you.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Then you say to me:<eos> "Boy, I might have brung you into this world... "but you the one who gonna have to live in it."
You're a member of the Council. Lf...<eos> It is not the will of the Council, it is the will of Father...<eos> and he is law.<eos> Sir... without the logic of process, is it not just mayhem... what we have worked so hard to eradicate?<eos> You must understand, Preston, that while you... and even I... may not always agree with it, it is not the message that is important, it is our obedience to it.
ANASTASIA: You started a whole new movement.<eos> "Mega-Tantrism." Sex without orgasms ever.<eos> Do you like to party?<eos> Can I borrow your handcuffs?<eos> If my hand is free, I'm bound to do anything with it.
I mean, there's a priority for a tight ass.<eos> But if it's hairy, I go for the tits.<eos> But if the tits are hairy, hey, it's right back to the pussy.<eos> But you've gotta speak to that pussy, son.<eos> You know, really talk to it. You make a vow to it.
If I go with you it'll be too dangerous for all of you.<eos> I can't go without you.<eos> You have to.<eos> Go back to the spring.<eos> Drink from it.
Nine.<eos> There were no consequences, he was doing fine even.<eos> Except, he wasn't afraid of anything or anybody anymore.<eos> He said: "We're just a piece of wood."<eos> He kept saying he wanted to attack the sun, take it away from the earth or set the world to fire with it.
Oh, for fuck's sake.<eos> Sorry about that, mate.<eos> Got a search cam here, Stu.<eos> Kind of like a sideways periscope, mate.<eos> It'll just help us locate you.
It's a mattress.<eos> - We can just cut through it.<eos> - Oh, shit.<eos> It's not his mattress.<eos> There's a man lying on it.
It's not a very common gift, Harry.<eos> This is bad.<eos> What's bad?<eos> If I hadn't told that snake not to attack Justin-<eos> - That's what you said to it.
- Sydney's fine.<eos> Question one.<eos> What would be the next picture in this series?<eos> D.<eos> Study this figure. If it was rotated 180 degrees, it would look like which of the following?
- Why not?<eos> - Because you'll lose everything.<eos> Your friends.<eos> Yourself.<eos> Willow, if you let this control you, then the world goes away, and all of us with it.
Good.<eos> Now listen.<eos> Can you hear the music?<eos> Listen.<eos> Now follow it.
All right.<eos> Try this one.<eos> Why am I here?<eos> I thought you were supposed to protect the timeline, not screw with it.<eos> It's already been screwed with, captain.
What could I have done that could have been so important?<eos> It wasn't just you.<eos> It was events you helped set in motion.<eos> This timeline, the one you say no longer exists.<eos> What can you tell me about it, if my mission had continued?
You have to go for it.<eos> How often does this happen to you?<eos> You owe it to yourself.<eos> Here's your warm milk.<eos> I'm gonna put the bourbon in it at home.
- Your Emily and Richard.<eos> - Sookie, you're way too sweet.<eos> She took the trouble to help me plan the first phase of the wedding.<eos> - The crazy phase of the wedding.<eos> - It was sweet and I appreciate it.
Enjoy the brownies. I'll see if I can screw up a cake for you later on.<eos> Sounds great.<eos> Luke, hang on just a sec.<eos> Listen, about Rory doing this tutoring thing...<eos> I really appreciate it, by the way.
How you doing?<eos> - That depends if it's on the record.<eos> - Okay, I deserve that.<eos> Look, I didn't mean to ambush you with the whole adoption agency thing.<eos> Hey, you saw a story and you went right for it.
Lois Runtz.<eos> Uh-huh. - l'm telling you the truth.<eos> - lf you were, it'd be a first.<eos> Nobody knows about that door. That's our secret door.<eos> Does Lois know about it?
This evil cannot be concealed by the power of the Elves.<eos> We do not have the strength to fight both Mordor and Isengard!<eos> Gandalf the Ring cannot stay here.<eos> This peril belongs to all Middle-earth.<eos> They must decide now how to end it.
I will be dead before I see the Ring in the hands of an elf!<eos> Never trust an elf!<eos> Do you not understand?<eos> While you bicker amongst yourselves, Sauron's power grows!<eos> None can escape it!
- What are you having? - Squid burger. It's good.<eos> Have you got yourself a boat yet?<eos> No.<eos> Y'oughta get Alvin Yark to build you one. Or you could buy Nutbeem's.<eos> I built a Chinese junk. Sailed it up from Brazil.
Now as witnesses to the event, I call Lena and my apprentice.<eos> But since no apprentice can be a witness, and since David sang so well today I make my apprentice a journeyman!<eos> Rise, journeyman.<eos> When you think of that blow, remember the baptism, too.<eos> This may be an emergency baptism. To be sure the melody can survive, I'II name it at once.
I'd stop the robot army and hope... that the world would forgive me.<eos> You're my hero, Floop... so I'm gonna help you, then you're gonna help me.<eos> - Minion must be stopped.<eos> - Just one thing.<eos> My show--what does it need?
I would say a mermaid.<eos> Are you never serious?<eos> I'll ask your redskin.<eos> And the beast...<eos> have you seen it yet? No.
That our country air has affected your head.<eos> As if it were eluding me.<eos> You haven't been here three months... and you expect to have finished already?<eos> Did you think the beast would surrender when it saw you?<eos> - Perhaps it's frightened of you.
- Not so bad.<eos> Move in a little bit.<eos> - Don't... Don't touch that.<eos> - Why not?<eos> Do you see me grabbing your gun and waving it around?
Together we can bring them back.<eos> All I ask is for something in return.<eos> That's it, Harry.<eos> There is no good and evil.<eos> There is only power and those too weak to seek it.
May i pass on a question from our Führer to you? - I am honoured.<eos> - The Führer, who appreciates your predictions for the future and who will regard to your.. ...historic prognosis, agrees with you entirely. Asked the other day in a small circle...<eos> How clairvoyance could be in accord with the principle of cause and effect? A law of nature.<eos> Nature doesn't care what we think of it.<eos> Nor about the laws that we assign it.
Yeah, but they can't tell the police because her lover gave it to her.<eos> Mrs. Kowalski's really something.<eos> They hired a detective, they say he's the best.<eos> He arrives at noon, today.<eos> - Maybe he'll get it back. - I hope so.
-Can't we get a break here?<eos> Come on, come on.<eos> This way.<eos> Beneath this ridge is a solid granite intrusion.<eos> We'll follow it, but El Blanco will have to go around.
Doctor... the Command Center is yours.<eos> Mmm, smells good.<eos> It's only burnt on the outside.<eos> Your cooking console's a little temperamental, huh?<eos> Did you try talking to it?
- Best friends go.<eos> - Oh, come on.<eos> You do love Richard.<eos> He loves you.<eos> If this friendship is deep enough to profoundly upset you, why not fix it?
You only can heal<eos> By living<eos> You have to go on living<eos> So one of us is living<eos> The hardest thing in this world is to live in it.
And give my love to my friends.<eos> You have to take care of them now.<eos> You have to take care of each other.<eos> You have to be strong.<eos> Dawn, the hardest thing in this world is to live in it.
You do a good job now.<eos> That's enough!<eos> I want to wear my own clothes.<eos> I hate to disappoint you, but one does not get to wear what one wants in the Texas prison system.<eos> Anyway, like I was saying Prince stole a moth, flew it down here.
You say your husband has good in him.<eos> What you have to do is learn to live on what the good part earns.<eos> The what?<eos> There's a point inside yourself, an inner boundary beyond which you feel culpable.<eos> You've got to come to an awareness of where that line is and forego those things which lay without it.
I was looking forward to Christmas this year.<eos> No shit.<eos> Then here I go, right back in the fucking rabbithole.<eos> Okay, let's do the drill.<eos> The attack, what preceded it?
- We didn't know this was gonna happen.<eos> We were just trying to push the envelope, do the right thing for the company.<eos> Then he got sick.<eos> He was working with an alloy with a genetic algorithm built into it.<eos> It converted electrical energy into mechanical. Gave it memory.
I mean, maybe later.<eos> In the meantime, Rye, why don't you tell her about the apron?<eos> Tedi's wearing it, and it's an apron.<eos> Riley started with a simple design.<eos> And then she gave it color and function with the removable oven mitts.
Maybe Korso will get to the Titan first.<eos> Why do you care so much about that thing?<eos> I was raised around people.<eos> "Drifter Colony bums", I believe is the term.<eos> I barely remember Earth, but the older ones used to tell us about it so it would never be completely lost.
Russian, American, beings from Mars.<eos> It's like a fire. It could either destroy us or keep us warm.<eos> That's why every FedEx office has a clock.<eos> Because we live or we die by the clock.<eos> We never turn our back on it.
Well, I got to the room first here before you... and I thought it would be funny if I popped out and surprised you.<eos> Surprise!<eos> And the rest is history.<eos> We haven't even known each other for 2O seconds... and already we have a story. This is gonna be great.<eos> -So, how are you gonna tell it? -Tell what?
The road doesn't notice if you're not wearing lipstick.<eos> It does not care how old you are.<eos> You do not feel uncomfortable... because you make more money than the road.<eos> And you can call on the road whenever you feel like it, whether it's been a day... or even a couple of hours since your last date.<eos> The only thing the road cares about... is that you pay it a visit once in a while.
Yeah.<eos> I wish I could be more like you.<eos> So how come you always wear that hat?<eos> 'Cause something like 90% of your body heat escapes through your head.<eos> But you're not particularly attached to it, are you?
Now I'm stuck with marrying her, which I demanded but don't want.<eos> Are you cheating?<eos> How can you ask? I'm loyal or I'm no servant.<eos> There's only one explanation. She asked about the charms of Paris.<eos> I joked about it, but she got serious, then you appeared and took the brunt.
- That's good.<eos> - Why?<eos> Intellectual depth.<eos> She's learned a new language.<eos> There's a bit more to it then just "the potential for nudity".
See you.<eos> Do me a favor.<eos> Call me back and leave me the number of your neighbor, the caterer.<eos> Much appreciated. 'Bye.<eos> -l think she really liked it. -Really?
So we're hiding in the bathroom...<eos> I get out.<eos> But before she can, her parents come in.<eos> I hide in the shower.<eos> They start going at it on the floor.
He's in love with the sound of his own voice.<eos> Whether we are man or woman, parent or child... flesh and blood or photons and force fields... lt has been said...<eos> On the other hand, perhaps he's been nipping at the sacramental wine.<eos> And, as such, our community is everything.<eos> It is our world, and we are a part of it just as a branch is part of a tree.
Yes. In order to replicate.<eos> And they are what they eat, right?<eos> What's the strongest material you know of?<eos> We have just developed a new alloy of naqahdah, trinium and carbon.<eos> It was used to create the hull of the O'Neill.
- Transgenomics.<eos> - Which is...?<eos> It's a form of DNA manipulation - alterations made on the genetic level.<eos> It is widely known that tobacco companies pour money into that kind of research.<eos> Changing the tobacco plant itself in order to make it hardier, give it less nicotine, more nicotine, make it naturally menthol-flavored. You name it.
You're not gonna let a little rain stop you from making 100 hamburgers.<eos> That relationship's lasted longer than I thought it would.<eos> Look at his eyes.<eos> He's bored.<eos> I give it two more weeks.
Now, you must hurry.<eos> What will you do?<eos> Blow up the bridge.<eos> Will that stop him?<eos> It will, if he's on it.
[ Jip Narrating ] Well, that's almost it from me and my friends. Back to mundane Monday.<eos> I guess my point is, I think we're all fucked up in our own way, you know?<eos> But we're all doing it together.<eos> We're freestyling on the buckled wheel of life, trapped in a world of internal dialogue.<eos> Like Bill Hicks said, "It's an insane world, but I'm proud to be part of it."
Ming Xinhong won the 5,000 meter championship in the city.<eos> Wei Minzhi went back to her family's farm.<eos> She often returns to visit her students.<eos> The remaining money was used to rebuild the school.<eos> They renamed it the ShuiQuan School of Hope.
I won't regret it...<eos> Cheap wood chopsticks!<eos> ...even if you make me cry!<eos> Love is a wonderful thing!<eos> I will dive into it if I ever get the chance.
- So where is our relationship going?<eos> - Our what?<eos> Our who?<eos> Relationship.<eos> What kind do we have, and what is it progressing toward?
It's just a matter of time.<eos> How much time?<eos> Not much.<eos> I'm gonna die, and there's nothing you can do about it.<eos> My power is ebbing, and with it, my ability to cloak Daisy.
Yes.<eos> Such desire needs only the slightest encouragement to become ignited.<eos> Am I right?<eos> Yes.<eos> In Islam, we believe eliminating temptation... is more effective than trying to resist it.
Envision the flame burning within you.<eos> Sorry.<eos> The flame grows hotter.<eos> A point of white light.<eos> Follow it backward through the years to a time when you were younger, a child.
I wish I could say it was working.<eos> A treatment to relieve your condition was available and yet you refused.<eos> I've got a disease, but I'm willing to live with the symptoms.<eos> Doesn't make much sense does it?<eos> I assumed that romantic love was a human weakness, but clearly it can also be a source of strength.
I have another use for her first.<eos> First there was darkness.<eos> Then came the strangers.<eos> They abducted us and brought us here.<eos> This city, everyone in it... is their experiment.
'Cause some old coot wants to paint your picture.<eos> We're just bringin' you back to earth.<eos> Can't imagine a real artist wanting.<eos> To spend time lookin' at that kisser.<eos> That you couldn't lay under it a couple of times.
Dr. Franklin, check the perimeters. See if we can secure this place.<eos> All right.<eos> You know, Commander... if we are unable to resolve this war of yours... there is always a place for someone like you among our people.<eos> We could arrange a safe haven for you and a few others.<eos> Thanks... but if my world goes, I'm going with it.
You will hunt down Porthos, Athos and Aramis and bring me their heads.<eos> Or I will have yours.<eos> As for you, my brother, back to the prison you shall go, and into the mask you hate.<eos> Wear it until you love it.<eos> And die in it!
Not Cybil?<eos> Make business interests and art together, is a conflict almost inevitable.<eos> - Wimp, just simply shut up.<eos> I was just to believe in this whole rock star crap.<eos> What it delivers on stage is not shit.
Yes. - They were correct.<eos> I got two picks on the nose. Smack on the nose, Sol.<eos> Something's going on.<eos> It has to do with that number.<eos> There's an answer in it.
He seems to have no problem hurting you now.<eos> You were in the plane as well.<eos> Harold was diagnosed with cancer.<eos> three years to live.<eos> and he leapt at it.
The hammer.<eos> The one I used to kill.<eos> It's dull now, but...<eos> The secret to keeping it clean is use.<eos> Yeah, blood feeds it, gives it shine.
So today I found out, as I'm sure you may already know, Carley passed away.<eos> She was 19. Nineteen years old. And she spent the better part<eos> - The fact she was. - Able to stay positive. And upbeat and inspire people through all of it.<eos> Absolutely.<eos> She was the example for all of us and she was determined not to let cancer win and even though she succumbed to it, it didn't win.
Upload that into the web. Doesn't matter where.<eos> Just put PJ's name on it, and the right people will find it.<eos> I'm not even sure I know what you're talking about.<eos> The encryption key is like a password.<eos> The source code is like gibberish without it. With it, it's Bathwater.
Uncle Monty will be down soon.<eos> [chuckles] It can't understand you.<eos> Dr. Montgomery said the broken-hearted crocodile's mating call just happens to sound like depressed human speech.<eos> I know.<eos> Just like talking to it.
Lord of Light, come to us in our darkness.<eos> For the night is dark and full of terrors.<eos> We'll all freeze soon.<eos> I saw the water.<eos> When you killed the white walker, almost all the dead that followed it fell.
We'll build from there.<eos> I'll ask the kid to just draw a little circle.<eos> And maybe, in the simple act of trying his best, maybe he'll win me over with a simple circle.<eos> Here's the impression your little circle made on me, John.<eos> It lacked focus, ambition, clarity, precision, dedication, passion and honesty.
Perfect.<eos> Silent oars, the cover of darkness, the advantage of surprise.<eos> The river runs fast at Ludd Gate, making it impossible to land men safely.<eos> But if the Lord of Mercia believes that men sinking to the bottom of the river is an advantage, then let him attack.<eos> Uhtred, your advice may well be sound, but how am I to trust it?
My wife pops up. "What are you doing?"<eos> I'm like, "Look at this!<eos> Look! She's talking to a gorilla!"<eos> And we both just got sucked into this thing. Right?<eos> So, long story short, she's talking to this gorilla, and one day she decides to get it a little kitten.
What is wrong with you?"<eos> I'm like, "What do you mean, 'What's wrong?<eos> ' That video is fucked up!"<eos> What is the purpose of that?<eos> You teach a gorilla how to talk, you're shootin' the shit, you get it a pet kitten and then it dies.
Find a hot guy, have a ridiculous night, and then all would be well.<eos> So I did that, and I kept doing that until I realized... why do anything else?<eos> Sex and death.<eos> That's want I want.<eos> Well, you can say you're ready for death... a lot of people do... but as someone who's been around a lot of death and been left behind by it,
(bones crack) (distorted): You are not deserving!<eos> Malcolm, I've secured the third Talisman.<eos> I'll see you in the morning.<eos> "Don't fight the pain.<eos> "Surrender to it."
Dark!<eos> Doctor!<eos> Look, a stone cairn - Pictish civilisation.<eos> The bird!<eos> What about it?
- Yep. - What's its name?<eos> Coco.<eos> Wait, wasn't that Ellen's dog's name?<eos> Yes.<eos> You can't name it the same thing.
But so often, I hear:<eos> "Baby Archer, I'm too dumb to dance."<eos> You dumb motherfucker, anybody can dance, even if you're dumb as shit!<eos> [Auto-Tuned] ♪ Hey, you all, I got a new dance ♪<eos> ♪ It's called the Kupid Shufle Just give it a chance ♪
I'll find a gym and hit it.<eos> This man don't believe in this shit, bro.<eos> Chris, you know, I mean, he could do everything wrong right now and still probably fight and do well in four-round fights.<eos> But you get to six, eight, ten and twelve-round fights, it don't matter how old you are, it catches up to you.<eos> Your body's putting out what you put into it.
[Allura] That looks like a Tel-Galax exploration shuttle.<eos> One of my father's deep space vessels.<eos> According to the ship's identification code, it's Commodore Trayling's ship.<eos> But I don't see any records of its destination or mission.<eos> -What happened to it?
When was the last time you saw any real whiskey?<eos> Irish whiskey?<eos> This is from Boston. Hmm.<eos> We can run anything through that blockade, but the whiskey always seems to get here first.<eos> I suppose the only neutral parties in any war are the people makin' money from it.
He lets me stay here in exchange for shooting coyotes.<eos> Cold beer in the fridge.<eos> You stole my hat.<eos> I borrowed it.<eos> What the fuck you do to it?
I don't want to be Troy Maxson!<eos> I just want to be me.<eos> You can't be nobody but who you are, Cory.<eos> That shadow wasn't nothing but you growing into yourself.<eos> You either got to grow into it, or cut it down to fit you, but that's all you got to make a life with.
But I can't disappear.<eos> But I don't want to leave you.<eos> Honey, look.<eos> No one ever saw that dragon again.<eos> And I never told another tale about it.
So, by holding the water in her mouth, we'll be able to show that it's not some form of ventriloquism.<eos> Does she have to be in the chair?<eos> Just... It makes me sick to see her sitting there like that.<eos> We know it's hard, but the spirit has shown an attachment to this spot.<eos> It'll be easier for Ed to contact it if she's sitting there.
I was there that day.<eos> The ocean chose you.<eos> I thought it was a dream.<eos> Our ancestors believed Maui lies there... at the bottom of his hook.<eos> Follow it, and you will find him.
Hey, hey, hey.<eos> We got the best seats in the house right here.<eos> Anyone can sit down there.<eos> We saved this city.<eos> We should be on the Jumbotron, not in it.
Adam!<eos> Smiths!<eos> It was hard to believe that these were the same brave Highland warriors who had beaten the British army at Prestonpans and Falkirk, who had marched triumphantly into England.<eos> Five months of retreat with not enough food and brutal weather had left them broken and demoralized.<eos> Our worst nightmare was coming true, and I felt completely helpless in the face of it.
Together we will trap the British between us.<eos> John?<eos> John, I look to you, as always.<eos> The plan has some merit, I'll admit.<eos> I will agree to it... on one condition.
It is not just about the inmates of the nerve centers you have led, that's just the beginning.<eos> It will be the entire lower third of our body in the future.<eos> Inferior, crippled, feeble-minded,<eos> Alcoholic beast, driving perpetrator, working clothes, in short:<eos> All those diseased elements, Which cause the healthy national body more costs than they bring to it.
Not only did they kill the Chosen but also my aunt, Pyria.<eos> The Ellcrys will bear a seed.<eos> That seed must be carried by one of the Chosen to a place called Safehold.<eos> There it will be immersed in the Bloodfire.<eos> Only then can it be returned and the Ellcrys can be reborn.
He named this new sect after himself, calling it The Order of St. Dumas.<eos> Okay.<eos> Impressive.<eos> Yes.<eos> His psyche couldn't reconcile death and rebirth until we gave it a grander context.
I'll have you know I didn't order these.<eos> I found them.<eos> Am I the only person in this city who doesn't just do whatevs whenevs?<eos> Well, fudge that sugar.<eos> Fudge it to heck, where a demon with a thousand wee-wees fudges it forever!
Fatah, why do you want to do this trip with your cow?<eos> The Agricultural Show is a Mecca for farmers.<eos> It has always been my dream. If you help me, I'll be so very happy.<eos> Who votes to help Fatah make this journey?<eos> All this money, how'll we pay it back?
Sorry we had to do this the hard way.<eos> We all have pain.<eos> Some of it is physical from injuries or age.<eos> Some is mental... you know,living with the loss of our loved ones.<eos> If you think about it, whether we fight that pain or succumb to it, the result is the same.
How long will that take?<eos> A day? If they've traveled north.<eos> Compass.<eos> This path cuts east.<eos> We'll follow it while the raptor covers all other terrains.
Mmm. That is.<eos> Mine is doing it too.<eos> Mr. Douglas has a compass.<eos> What are you gonna do with it?<eos> Follow it. Seriously?
I don't...<eos> I think I know.<eos> Has a dog, right?<eos> Came in here.<eos> I even saw him walk it once.
You can't do this right now.<eos> Why do you do this?<eos> Why do you act like this? Why do you act like you're not one of us?<eos> When you're aiming, Casey, always keep both eyes open.<eos> Cover your target with the barrel then move with it to get its pace.
So is-- Is he a psychiatrist?<eos> Absolutely not.<eos> Well, here's your dog.<eos> Mmm-mmm, not mine.<eos> You could leave it on the desk, and I'll find it some fruit.
The apartment, that...<eos> - Yeah. - That is...<eos> What the fuck are you doing?<eos> What the fuck are you doing?<eos> You must be sweating this Jerry stuff. By "sweating," I mean fully avoiding it.
- Yes, sir. - Cathy.<eos> Do we have a problem?<eos> No, sir.<eos> I'll coordinate with Doug.<eos> After a dog's bitten you, you either put it to sleep, or you put a muzzle on it.
You're putting us all at risk.<eos> You'll meet Scott at Fee's in an hour.<eos> Bring Benjamin.<eos> Leekie's Alzheimer's bot's looking a little peaked.<eos> Suppose we should feed it some blood, like Little Shop of Horrors?
You say that now.<eos> But it's the losing that haunts us.<eos> This can't happen.<eos> You know why I left this place?<eos> 'Cause I hated everything about it.
At the Serbs' place.<eos> We need to get that car soon.<eos> I said we could get a BMW 645.<eos> - Yeah, but not right now.<eos> - I said we would get it today.
Barry!<eos> - What's happening?<eos> - I don't understand.<eos> The suit's tracker must be malfunctioning.<eos> It says he's appearing and reappearing all over the city at once, and that's impossible.
None of them have a mountain lion on exhibit right now.<eos> Could be our shooter had one as a pet.<eos> Yes, but that would be illegal.<eos> And a triple murderer would never risk a violation from the Health Department.<eos> The point is, the lion wouldn't be registered, so there would be no way to search for it.
Why do you refuse me?<eos> Look out.<eos> Quickly, through here.<eos> This leads to a hidden passageway.<eos> Follow it.
It's not ideal, but Mack... he has a lot of pain.<eos> He lost hope.<eos> I could survive off his pain for years.<eos> I know where you're being dragged down to.<eos> I've escaped it before.
It's not ideal, but Mack... He has a lot of pain.<eos> He lost hope.<eos> I could survive off his pain for years.<eos> I know where you're being dragged down to.<eos> I've escaped it before.
I guess we know why Rudy Jones was the only survivor.<eos> - He killed them all...<eos> - You can't stop us.<eos> You can't stop what we're changing into.<eos> This planet is being destroyed by the human race, which lives only to suck the life from it. Like parasites.
-When you buy a steak, it says "keep refrigerated".<eos> It doesn't say, "Stick to the side of your car, leave in the sun, then drive through a river."<eos> James is making such a racket, isn't he?<eos> It's worse than last time.<eos> The difference on this trip, while he's been tearing nature apart, I've never felt closer to it.
Now, this I have to see for myself.<eos> Go get 'em.<eos> Private Pigeon in basic training.<eos> No pigeons will be harmed in the making of White Rabbit Project.<eos> First, you have to familiarize the bird with the box, acclimate it, and we do that by putting it in the box, give it some food to eat, and they start associating the box with the food, so it's a nice place.
Do not impale him on the pole.<eos> and lances.<eos> Let's joust.<eos> And now for the most important part of this experiment, our accelerometer.<eos> It's gonna help us determine how many Gs our knight experiences during his rapid deceleration.
All right? It's what Step-By-Stepdad calls "setting up a Loving Fence."<eos> A Loving Fence?<eos> Wow, that sounds really great, honey.<eos> But your self-help books have never met Dusty Mayron.<eos> He sounds like a rascal, but I don't think it's anything I can't handle.
I apologize for the tirade.<eos> I am gonna go.<eos> But I am forever in your debt, gentlemen.<eos> Another word which is never used anymore.<eos> Let's bring it back, shall we?
Think you're up to it?<eos> Why, do you?<eos> So... You think I could stay... until I get it done?<eos> All right.<eos> You know a place is haunted when it feels more real than you are.
- This film's perfect for you.<eos> - I feel it, it's my film.<eos> Mom, what did you do?<eos> I just touched it.<eos> The mechanic said I've kept it wonderfully, it doesn't seem 14 years old.
Mr Hoppy's secret plan was a cunning one. See,<eos> If a creature grows slowly enough, you'll never notice it grows at all.<eos> Be a very different story if it happened all at once.<eos> Let's say you had a small puppy.<eos> You drop it off at school in the morning and pat its little head goodbye.
- Schasaat.<eos> Save it for the dragon.<eos> - What was that?<eos> If we distract it ...<eos> I might have a clean shot at it with this wand.
That's what I'm hoping for.<eos> Come on.<eos> We got a lot of work to do.<eos> All right, Liv. This is where we part ways.<eos> Head that way towards the river and follow it.
Destructor safety.<eos> Climb data card.<eos> Installed in aircraft.<eos> I know this man.<eos> If the charge is true, he serves a foreign power but he serves it faithfully.
Ana?<eos> Ana?<eos> Ana!<eos> - A little bird... came into the house.<eos> I'm helping it out.
We're going to do great things together.<eos> And I will bring you creatures you have only ever imagined.<eos> You need to come with me, Sondra.<eos> Give me back my pain.<eos> I can take it all away.
Look at me.<eos> I've seen how strong you can be, and that's the Wes I need for you to be right now, to help the others.<eos> Here.<eos> Sam's ring.<eos> I took it off right before we...
What an idiot.<eos> What is he messing with that truck for?<eos> - Your dad's truck?<eos> - Yeah. We can't find the parts for it.<eos> - Yeah, but are you helping with it? - Yes!
They butchered my mother, everyone I ever knew.<eos> I know what it's like to lose the people you love.<eos> I know this is hard for you.<eos> But winter is coming.<eos> We know what's coming with it.
And, uh, your mother wanted to be here, too.<eos> I know, but the wounded in Tondc need her more.<eos> Field commanders, today's the day we get our people back.<eos> The enemy thinks it's safe behind its doors, but it's not.<eos> When it realizes that, it will fight back...
What did you do to me?<eos> Hope's blood is now in you.<eos> You are now the bait.<eos> And this body is still linked to Davina and those children.<eos> If I leave it and it dies, then Davina and the others die with it.
Well, come on then. Let's get you back in your proper body, though I'll likely have to torture Freya and Esther to do so, which actually might be quite fun.<eos> No, Nik.<eos> I'm staying put.<eos> Eva's gone for good, but her body, this body is still linked to Davina and those children.<eos> I can feel it, and if I leave it, then it dies, and Davina and the others die with it.
Previously on "The Originals"...<eos> We take hope and the pack, and we leave town tonight.<eos> This body is still linked to Davina and those children.<eos> If I leave it and it dies, then Davina and the others die with it.
~ Hmm. For I must confess that it looks to me as if nothing would be easier.<eos> Do you dance, rogue?<eos> Lady Pole is not mad.<eos> She appears mad but that is Norrell's fault.<eos> He summoned a fairy spirit to raise her from the dead and in exchange he gave it all sorts of rights over her.
Hero, no! You're no match for her with a sword!<eos> I've wounded her before.<eos> Had I known who you were then, I never would have let you go.<eos> Where is the ring of the Magi?<eos> I'll take you to it if you spare our lives.
I warn you, if on April 24 there's a demonstration against Turkey, across France, we'll cut off diplomatic relations.<eos> And I, poor ambassador, will have to leave Paris, which I will greatly regret, for I love your city.<eos> In the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit, Amen.<eos> Brothers and sisters, on April 24, each year, we recall the bloody images of the massacre of our martyrs.<eos> This death was not just endured, it was the march of a people towards a calvary, in the name of their right to affirm their Armenian identity.
At least try.<eos> Bloody John Constantine.<eos> Center of attention again.<eos> This demon will try to use our weaknesses against us.<eos> If it emerges, don't listen to it.
He's protecting a person.<eos> There some reason we can't turn the lights on?<eos> Yes.<eos> The sensor is remarkably sophisticated.<eos> It's virtually impossible to approach it without incurring Odin's wrath.
You know what, I have no choice because it is important to my sons.<eos> Yeah, and what about your own needs?<eos> Parents do not have needs.<eos> You ever read the book The Giving Tree?<eos> It's about a tree, and this kid keeps coming and taking stuff from it his whole life, until there's nothing left but a stump.
I got the bed second-hand.<eos> Yes, it's fine.<eos> This is my bar.<eos> A tree fell in the storm.<eos> I made a big shelf with it.
The Emery murder didn't happen at the Cortez.<eos> No.<eos> It couldn't happen there.<eos> Every act must be dramatic, theatrical.<eos> You must give it meaning.
Bonnie is OK, Jo is OK, and Lily has been laid down for a long winter's nap.<eos> Well, you look lost in thought.<eos> I remember everything, every moment.<eos> It's like a million tiny, little pieces of my heart have fallen back into place.<eos> I remember the moment that we met, the moment that we fell in love, how much I didn't want to love you, but it was like-- it was like I was being swept up into a current. I--I--I was consumed by it.
That's been Christine's plan from the start?<eos> It was my idea to bring the amethyst here.<eos> It'll be guarded at all times.<eos> Good work, James.<eos> We can't afford to let anything happen to it.
Hey, Paul.<eos> ♪ Christmas ♪<eos> ♪ The snow's coming down ♪<eos> ♪ Christmas ♪<eos> ♪ I'm watching it fall ♪
She's real.<eos> - You believe that?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Can I tell you about belief, Kevin?<eos> When the mind is in emotional distress, it will grasp at any construct that makes it feel better.
You're the finest we ever made.<eos> You're the only one that can do this.<eos> And if you cross over to that other side, you will finally see that your faith in Hydra was never misplaced.<eos> It's real.<eos> You will look it in the eye.
People loved Horsin' Around.<eos> This would only ruin that.<eos> I'm sorry I accused you of murder, American TV legend Henry Winkler.<eos> No need to apologize.<eos> You ascribed a mystery to Herb's death to give it meaning.
And what those waters restore, they can also take.<eos> Life for live.<eos> So what are you saying?<eos> That you need to feed this impulse.<eos> Give into it.
- He was gonna kill you.<eos> - No, no, no, no, no, no.<eos> You just... you just let him off too easy.<eos> He needs to pay! He needs to suffer!<eos> He needs to feel the pain, - not escape it!
If you continue to harass me or anyone I care about, I promise, this won't end well for you.<eos> Now, can anyone in the class tell me what that is? Huh?<eos> Why, it's motive, mr. Cavanaugh!<eos> He left the message one hour before regina was killed.<eos> If this case were any easier, I'd have slept with it in college.
I gotta go meet the folks from Guinness Book of Records.<eos> It's just a formality.<eos> They gotta measure and validate the size of my penis.<eos> Oh, so the world's biggest asshole has the world's smallest dick?<eos> Ah, yeah, if it's so small, why you driving away from it?
Again!<eos> There are two kinds of warfare.<eos> Each is dictated by numbers.<eos> With greater numbers... you attack the enemy head on!<eos> You stab it in the heart!
All those voices... so much pain.<eos> It's not their pain you're afraid of.<eos> It's yours, Charles.<eos> And as frightening as it may be... that pain will make you stronger.<eos> If you allow yourself to feel it... embrace it... it will make you more powerful than you ever imagined.
If you've only got a moustache<eos> We are the guardians of the future.<eos> Enter when ready.<eos> Stark!<eos> Did you shoot the black condor and kick it in the balls?
Look...<eos> It's beautiful to be in love...<eos> Your hat.<eos> Without Johnny, I would not have survived the camp.<eos> I had only one thought in mind, how to find it.
I will kick this door down! Mr..<eos> Holmes, you and I are similar, I think.<eos> Yes, I think we are.<eos> There's a proper time to die, isn't there? Of course there is.<eos> And one should embrace it when it comes.
It's the Andromache's spritsail brace.<eos> It must have blown loose during the explosion.<eos> That's two knots or more it'll drag us down.<eos> Earlier... when you and Mr. Gates were having words, you mentioned a letter.<eos> What was in it, Billy?
It wasn't Singleton that stole the page. - It was him.<eos> - You're lying to them.<eos> If no one knows, everyone wins.<eos> I believe in this place.<eos> If there's anyone who can do what's necessary to make it something better, it's you.
I was so sure he was Henry.<eos> I guess we have to accept that we were wrong.<eos> Did I ever tell you why my curveball was so unhittable?<eos> It was unhittable 'cause you only had three fingers.<eos> The absence of an index finger put greater pressure behind the ball at point of release, giving it greater spin.
Crazy?<eos> To put ourselves through all this when the outcome's so uncertain.<eos> The outcome is only uncertain for those who disbelieve.<eos> I believe in this place.<eos> And I believe if there's anyone who can do what's necessary to make it something better, it's you.
If I had to choose...<eos> - That's where you lack in your reasoning.<eos> If you decide, it has no free will.<eos> Then you've ruined the code.<eos> But what shall I give it?
I was surprised to get your note.<eos> You seem a man who holds his secrets fast.<eos> I wasn't going to come.<eos> But you couldn't resist.<eos> When you see a river, you must follow it to its source, no matter the perils, no matter those comrades that fall along the way.
You weak, foul, lustful, vainglorious man.<eos> How dare you presume to speak to me of death?<eos> Then we shall speak of it together.<eos> Yes.<eos> We will follow it to Mina.
Your Grace.<eos> There he is.<eos> Long may he reign.<eos> Long may he reign.<eos> He sits the throne like he was born to it.
Can I come?<eos> Your dad is so hot. I just want to, like, paint him.<eos> Ugh, no.<eos> That is exactly why you cannot come.<eos> So, in the afternoon, I took an appendix, and I rewired it on this kid who had no control of his own urine.
No.<eos> Um... has anyone said anything about a troll?<eos> - The children are talking about one and I wondered if the police knew.<eos> Has one of your pupils seen a troll?<eos> Come into contact with it?
- Vice president, sales.<eos> - Midwest region. - Mm-hmm.<eos> Bought the surround sound to celebrate.<eos> I mean, it's pretty sweet, huh?<eos> You're gonna have to marry that ham, you get any more familiar with it.
- Finished?<eos> - Yes.<eos> You need to forget Modes Travaux, Alice.<eos> The subject is the ethereal.<eos> A bird is fine, but make it something unusual.
The Lenape community is up in arms.<eos> Police have not made any comment, have not identified any suspects, as of yet, but they do have both sides of the road blocked off - right now...<eos> - You get that scrip?<eos> Yeah-- boy charged me two hundred bucks for it.<eos> You gotta take it to Campbell's Drugstore, in Airmont. The pharmacist there is in on it.
You wrote down directions in your diary?<eos> I write lots of things.<eos> The storm's gathering force.<eos> Just like last time.<eos> - I vote we head towards it.
A little...<eos> But now I'm hungry.<eos> The worst part is the waiting.<eos> Death should come out of nowhere.<eos> You shouldn't have to stare it in the face.
And how do you plan on doing that?<eos> Markos found his way back.<eos> It's not impossible.<eos> The other side is falling apart.<eos> And when this place goes, you are going with it.
– All right. Time to go.<eos> - Wait!<eos> Where's your chronograph in my time?<eos> We'll put it in a safe place for you.<eos> Find the Green Rider, he'll lead you to it.
Put 'er there Schmidty.<eos> - Cheers.<eos> Cheers.<eos> - To a nice quiet evening.<eos> - Tranquil. This moment is so chill and absent of drama, I want to call it "Tim Duncan."
The potential to get the game behind the game.<eos> - I owe you my career, eldritch.<eos> Now what about the bioagent?<eos> - Highly lethal, But it quickly dissipates;<eos> designed so our troops Can follow it into battle.
No-one even knows where she's buried.<eos> After she died, the relic disappeared.<eos> The priory was looted during the dissolution of the monasteries.<eos> No trace of the rosary was ever found. And it's been missing ever since.<eos> I may be a step closer to finding it.
You'll get up and do the dishes, pick up the remote, watch the game.<eos> But under 400 milliseconds, ah, that's the sweet spot.<eos> Well, guess what? Our soon-to-be Cardiff PC, though it looks ragtag now, just clocked in at 396 milliseconds.<eos> Once assembled, it will not only be faster than other PCs on the market, it will also be addictive.<eos> So spend time with your families, folks, get drinks with your friends, 'cause once our PC hits, you're gonna be hanging out with it.
Hello?<eos> Exit the box and surrender to the glory of the Sontaran Empire!<eos> Shush.<eos> Doctor?<eos> I was being chased by a giant dinosaur but I think I managed to give it the slip.
Are we expecting strangers?<eos> It would seem there is already one here.<eos> What have I done wrong?<eos> - The dinosaur doesn't seem very happy.<eos> -What's wrong with it?
Are the eyes full of life?<eos> Are the eyes cloudy?<eos> You see?<eos> My finger goes right in that's how fresh it is.<eos> You slap it in the face.
One of them died, one's battling cancer, one of them now herds sheep in the Netherlands.<eos> But obviously, someone who lives in this building has potential.<eos> Jake Picardo is the paparazzo who took Iris to court for pushing him and breaking his camera.<eos> He now resides in apartment 10-D.<eos> I know you followed a lead on the missing Mr. Frebeaux, but did you have to follow it into an ashtray?
No, my God.<eos> Mom's not even here until 5:00.<eos> And you ate our only power bar.<eos> Well, that's probably what attracted it!<eos> You know, we got to throw something at it.
This is just a bitch in heat as far as he's concerned.<eos> And he's not leaving till he gets what he came for.<eos> Well, the girl, too late, realizes the kind of mistake she's made, she wants to get up.<eos> But the dog had other ideas.<eos> Had to shoot it behind the ear to get it off of her.
Show me what you've been working on.<eos> Press "Enter."<eos> _ Don't be rude.<eos> Computer's talking to you.<eos> Answer it.
The iron birds, promise me you'll tell Karl!<eos> Yeah, sure. Promise me!<eos> - I promise.<eos> - He's got to go the way of the pointed rocks, then the river with the fireflies, then change directions till the sea.<eos> Karl's got a 6th sense... if he can just learn to hear it, to follow it.
What happens when Stalin's got one?<eos> China?<eos> The Shah of Iran.<eos> You know the story of the golem?<eos> A rabbi wanted to protect the Jews of Prague, so he built an automaton out of mud, brought it to life.
It ought to be fun, right?<eos> And the '80s were nothing if not fun.<eos> Hemoclip!<eos> I know this is old hat for you, Oliver, But Dr. Karev's never seen this procedure firsthand.<eos> You want to walk him through it?
What we'll discover when we get there.<eos> - Are you nervous?<eos> - A bit, yes. With the life you've had, you're not scared.<eos> My life is not unusual.<eos> A circus comes to town, you decide to follow it.
A circus comes to town, you decide to follow it.<eos> Not everyone would dare.<eos> - You said it.<eos> - What?<eos> A circus came to town, I didn't follow it.
Help me.<eos> I can't, kid.<eos> We'd like to ask you a few questions about Sean Walker.<eos> You know his movie Black Mass?<eos> I was a consultant on it. s
And when she did, when she was gone, the magic in her pendant had no tether. It was set free.<eos> Her last wish fulfilled.<eos> So, how do we unfulfill it?<eos> Excellent question.<eos> But until we figure it out, no one should go near it.
The father became fearful of his son, so he wounded him.<eos> A tale told time and again.<eos> I don't think of Samaritan as a child.<eos> I'm not that presumptuous.<eos> But I plan to celebrate its brilliance... not muzzle it.
Is your ass made out of candy?<eos> - What?<eos> - I'm asking. Is your ass made out of some kind of candy?<eos> No?<eos> Then why does my half-wit son keep following it?
You don't even know how to play the game.<eos> - Don't touch me.<eos> - Hey, hey, hey.<eos> What's going on?<eos> Nikki picked up the eight ball, asked it a question and shook it.
That's yours.<eos> -Is he in? Yeah! Come in.<eos> I was just passing, I was...<eos> -Can I make you a cup of tea? -No. Thank you.<eos> -I'm sorry that I put my foot in it. -It's fine. -I said it without even thinking.
Your brother, your cousin and your sister.<eos> I've known her address in Primrose Hill since the day she moved in.<eos> Now she is safe only as long as I want her to be.<eos> I've been ahead of you, every step of the way.<eos> And, as my father used to say, to make sure your dog obeys you, you have to show it the stick once in a while.
Yeah, and things were going pretty good, so Elsa extended our stay into the fall.<eos> But when she did that, our winter spot down in Tampa fell through and we had to ride out the whole winter up there in the cold.<eos> It was fun at first, 'cause most of those guys had never seen snow before, but... by January, everybody was shitting their pants from the cold.<eos> I went out hunting and... shot a rabbit.<eos> Skinned it for a coat for Ma Petite.
Lead me on the right path.<eos> To you I carry these Stones.<eos> There is a place out here that never ceases to amaze me.<eos> A strange cliff.<eos> To approach it is dangerous.
Understandably so.<eos> As am I.<eos> I will send more men to guard your trucks.<eos> And in the meantime, if Luciano shows a hair...<eos> I will cut it.
Usually I like a girl with ambition, but this is beyond mad.<eos> Just show me the spell, Kaleb, Kol, or whatever your name is.<eos> Problem's not the spell, the problem's the white oak stake.<eos> It's too powerful.<eos> You can't just drain it.
The Volm are our allies.<eos> What danger would that be?<eos> A force far greater than your mind can comprehend.<eos> But defeating them is why we strayed so far from our own galaxy, why we collected resources from every planet and moon along the way.<eos> The great battle is coming, and in order to face it, we are creating a new, elite, frontline army.
I'm not. But if I have to be, I'm glad I have you.<eos> I think I'll go check in on her one more time.<eos> All right, I'll see you in the morning.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I shouldn't have killed the skitter while you were connected to it.
Why is she a threat? What are these powers?<eos> Whenever she gets angry or frightened... It's like she's got command of the heavens.<eos> At first, it seemed involuntary, but she's getting the hang of it now, and that is probably because she has been meeting with an Espheni.<eos> Oh, hold up, now.<eos> An Overlord has been here, and Lexi's been meeting with it?
Someone added a human gene to the virus?<eos> - Why?<eos> - I have no idea.<eos> No matter what I try, the virus seems to be one step ahead of me.<eos> It's outsmarting whatever I throw at it.
How old is he there?<eos> I'm not sure, like, 25, 26?<eos> Great fisherman, huh?<eos> Well, we don't think he actually caught that fish.<eos> He said he did, but my grandmother always thought that he found it on the docks and then asked someone to take his picture next to it.
But you can't lose faith in yourself.<eos> Trust me.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Leaving a trail.<eos> I'm more accustomed to outrunning bad weather than following it.
Maybe you should reconsider.<eos> What?<eos> The dog.<eos> What am I gonna do with a dog?<eos> Ah, you can take care of it, play with it, scratch its ears.
Okay? All right, well this is Citizen Z, and I'm signing off.<eos> Who's Addy?<eos> So which way do we go?<eos> The storm is pushing north from the gulf.<eos> If we make it to the I-70, we can outrun it.
What is it you want to know, huh?<eos> I'll tell you...<eos> Doesn't matter what I ask.<eos> I can't trust the answer.<eos> Write that sentence down, hand it to your therapist.
I'm gonna do it.<eos> Then why'd you ask me?<eos> Sometimes you just have to hear stuff out loud.<eos> When you're not here, I talk to that fridge.<eos> It likes all my ideas, gives me ice, and it keeps stuff cold.
- That's just kind of a waste, isn't it?<eos> - Depends upon how you look at it.<eos> The old man met his adversary when he thought that part of his life was over.<eos> He saw himself in the fish.<eos> Came to... Came to respect it the more it fought.
"Lead us astray"?<eos> What does that mean?<eos> GANDALF:<eos> You must stay on the path.<eos> Do not leave it.
RM PLAYING YOU.<eos> LAST NIGHT ROTTMAYER TOLD ME HE STARTED HIS NETWORK WITH FIVE GUYS FROM HIS HOMETOWN.<eos> HE SAID HE COULD TRUST HIS LIFE TO THESE GUYS.<eos> GIVE JAVED THE SEXTANT.<eos> SHOW HIM HOW TO USE IT. TELL HIM IT'S HIS TICKET OUTTA HERE.
That lady's got an ass like the Loch Ness Monster.<eos> Thing is mysterious and ever sought after.<eos> Ron, aren't you going to say something to him?<eos> Hey, when you've got an ass like the North Star, wise men are going<eos> - to want to follow it. - (SCOFFS)
And I didn't really think about it until. I had to follow that dog around for three hours.<eos> We tried to get that dog to poop all day.<eos> They kept it inside and fed it for a couple days, so it would do it.<eos> It wouldn't.<eos> So they took it inside and they gave it an enema.
I think what we have here is something extremely manipulative.<eos> It's something inhuman.<eos> It was a big mistake acknowledging this doll.<eos> And through that, the inhuman spirit tricked you.<eos> You gave it permission to infest your lives.
They prove nothing.<eos> - I'll give you a circus! - Pierrot.<eos> You're right.<eos> This belt's worth nothing.<eos> But I'll give it worth.
You're a big boy now, Jack.<eos> He escaped in a standard FBI vehicle, right?<eos> Led you to the bridge.<eos> Where the other Horsemen were waiting with an identical replacement car.<eos> It only took a split second for you to lose contact with it and make the switch.
Dad was cool to bring me here.<eos> - Dad? Dad brought you here?<eos> I was upstate, in the woods.<eos> One day, this trident shows up over my head, and then it started moving south.<eos> And you followed it.
You're missing a key.<eos> And you know what happens when you miss a key.<eos> - I know I'm right. Do the math.<eos> - I did.<eos> I know that piano better than anyone who's ever played it.
You want to talk to it like it's a mic.<eos> "Check, check."<eos> Oh, don't hate.<eos> Emulate, bitches.<eos> You've got to talk to it.
Well, let's do our morning prayer, okay?<eos> And then, at 8:00, we'll meet in the living room for today's lesson. Okay?<eos> Does that sound good?<eos> - Mm-hmm.<eos> My chief aim in life is to continually strive... to be the best person that I can be for the greater good of the planet... and everyone who walks on it.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.<eos> Just go straight.<eos> If you follow the signs...<eos> - Yeah? - There's a sign there.<eos> - Yeah, just follow it.
No, you did a nice thing, sweetheart.<eos> Greg, I'm gonna need a bat!<eos> - Daddy, no!<eos> - No, no, I'm not going to hit the deer.<eos> I'm just going to massage his head for a little bit with it.
You just want the headline when you keep 3,000 jobs in your district.<eos> 12 votes?<eos> 12 votes.<eos> I can get you 10, probably 11.<eos> It's so refreshing to work with someone who will throw a saddle on a gift horse rather than look it in the mouth.
It does not break.<eos> It does not weaken.<eos> My cock can stand all day like a good soldier trying to impress his superiors.<eos> If my cock could win a medal, it would.<eos> If they could name a school after it, it should.
He is amiable and of good family.<eos> Is it... what you want?<eos> The alternative is to replace Lady Mary in her responsibilities at Kenwood.<eos> But she's a spinster.<eos> Papa did not trust I could achieve a match that would raise my rank or even equal it.
Don't touch me.<eos> We will never repeat our indiscretion again.<eos> Well, now, it's not what you want.<eos> You don't want to lay me on the ground.<eos> You want to bury me beneath it.
Don't do that.<eos> Yes, dear.<eos> I am not messing around.<eos> So you're not gonna pass that truck?<eos> You're just gonna stay behind it for the next 75 miles?
So this is what we're gonna do.<eos> Since one vial is already gone, you and Mr. Kane are gonna kidnap the talking dog so that we can analyze it and hopefully recreate the formula that you two idiots so foolishly let get away.<eos> Right.<eos> All right.<eos> What are we gonna do with the dog once you're done with it?
You never told me that you had a brother.<eos> He...<eos> He is deceased.<eos> On a planet orbiting one of those spots of light up there -- a most weary, un-bright cinder far from the home I have never known.<eos> He was born to war, grew up in it, and it eventually claimed him.
Okay, now breathe.<eos> Try to calm the waves.<eos> Try to slow them down.<eos> What... what's the point here?<eos> Well, the idea is, if you can teach your mind to calm the waves, you can teach it to... calm the pain.
Very good.<eos> Tell me why I am here, then.<eos> So I can vet you.<eos> For the Vice Presidency?<eos> The President values my advice, and he tends to follow it.
So where'd you put it?<eos> The headstone? Mm-hmm.<eos> Some place safe.<eos> Wasn't really our deal.<eos> Well, considering that you've betrayed me twice and I've betrayed you never, I think I'm acting brilliantly, especially since we have no idea why that guy was looking for it.
And when you see a lion, do you know how it's going to behave?<eos> It depends on the lion.<eos> For a Maasai warrior, lions are nothing to be scared of.<eos> If I saw a lion... A lion would be likely to attack me.<eos> Only if you threaten it.
Like it or not, this generation is responsible for handing on the world's wildlife to the next.<eos> Come on... That means taking care of the animals and lands where they live, so there is still space for us all to coexist.<eos> Nobody knows... what the future has in store for this little calf.<eos> Or, indeed, how the changes that inevitably are going to take place in Africa will affect the rest of the world and this little animal.<eos> But one thing is certain what happens here is more important than it has ever been, and that the relationship of the rest of the world to this great continent and the creatures that live in it is more important than ever before.
Every cop in Massachusetts has worked with her at some point, right?<eos> Now it's our investigation.<eos> But what about the autopsy?<eos> Well, the Governor assigned that Dr. Vladimir Popov to the case.<eos> Popov can't find his own ass unless you put his hand on it.
All we know is he's in the wind, and we're just trying to get them everything we can.<eos> Tony, I need you to keep this conversation between us for now.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Anything else you can think of?<eos> Uh, the guy that got his locker next, when he opened it, Mendoza had written, uh, in black magic marker on the inside of it:
Keep looking.<eos> Should be right here.<eos> Wait a minute.<eos> Why do you have a constipated look on your face?<eos> Maybe we're standing on it.
Unless they come before our Pontiff and beg forgiveness.<eos> The meeting is adjourned.<eos> Riario-Sansoni is correct about one thing: war is inevitable.<eos> - Did our letter go to Cesare?<eos> - He will receive it by this evening.
- My new body.<eos> How it moves.<eos> Its pitch, its yaw.<eos> My perfectly sculpted pubic topiary.<eos> I liked how your body moved before you knew what to do with it.
They owe me that much.<eos> Then we just need the contract signed and to give Chang a cheque for 50,000 dollars.<eos> He wants a backhander?<eos> To cover the girls' travel costs.<eos> Swiss Tourism will transfer it.
I just wanted to ask her if I could be the one to explain.<eos> She was laying in a...<eos> Puddle of blood.<eos> The letter opener was sticking out of her chest.<eos> I should have run for help, but the thought was in my head, and I couldn't escape it.
Katherine Sullivan...<eos> Kenneth Unger...<eos> Cynthia Volk... and Vanessa Wendenberg.<eos> No matter when or where they served... no matter if their names are known to the world or only to us... each cherished colleague remains a constant source of inspiration and courage.<eos> They all heard the same call to duty, and they all answered it without hesitation.
I see it's going well.<eos> So maybe... we can talk about this afterwards if you'd like.<eos> Let me ask you something.<eos> Have you ever held an eastern tiger salamander?<eos> Because I suggest that you do and that you look it in its tiny, little eyes, and you tell it face-to-face, man-to-salamander, how it can kiss its breeding ponds good-bye 'cause you need your double venti
That's how it works.<eos> Temporarily brings your spirit here.<eos> To go back, you have to reconnect to your body.<eos> My body's not even here.<eos> It's because each time you die you wake up farther and farther away from it, and you wander the other side until you find it.
Why don't you get in there and try the engine?<eos> It's a red and a green wire.<eos> Go on.<eos> It ain't rocket science.<eos> Give it some gas.
- Which is?<eos> You know normal wolves never abandon an injured member of the pack.<eos> They care for it.<eos> They bring it food from a kill and then regurgitate it into the mouth of the injured wolf.<eos> They even give it physical and emotional comfort by intensely grooming it.
I'm not sure of anything.<eos> Well, it's a full moon again tonight -<eos> I mean, maybe you're just anxious. Maybe.<eos> Or... maybe the moon really is involved in all this.<eos> Maybe it possessed me. I suppose it's possible.
There you go!<eos> There is no why.<eos> He kept the dog on a short chain.<eos> He beat it.<eos> Sometimes he wouldn't feed it for days.
Well, it worked.<eos> You're making the poison spread quicker, mate.<eos> I don't care.<eos> I just have to last long enough to get the sextant back to my family.<eos> Now take me to it!
We can rest all we want after we get the pixie dust, do whatever your heart desires.<eos> You'll see.<eos> What does it look like? Oh.<eos> It's just like dust.<eos> (Blows air) You never know the power it contains just by looking at it.
Was there a woman involved?<eos> Yes, yes. This is good. Keep it coming.<eos> We'll figure this out together.<eos> I know.<eos> You were in a cowboy bar and stabbed a mechanical bull with a butter knife and when it didn't die, you punched it in the face.
She's not your Supreme, Spalding.<eos> She's your employer.<eos> You're not a part of this coven.<eos> My family has served this coven... for ten generations.<eos> I have devoted my life to it.
Mermaids have the power to become invisible, but we can't hold it forever.<eos> Sometimes nature can provide a little bit of instant camouflage.<eos> OK.<eos> Let your energy focus on the ring.<eos> Mount your thoughts with it.
The trident has the same stone as the moon ring, but it's so much bigger.<eos> Yes.<eos> It shares the same power source moonlight.<eos> No wonder it's 100 times more powerful.<eos> That's why the danger from it is immense.
I wish you all the best.<eos> Please.<eos> Look, we can fix you.<eos> Make you stronger.<eos> Take the name "Scorch" and make it mean something.
I'm just so curious.<eos> I want to learn everything I can about this place.<eos> It's one of the oldest homes in the area.<eos> It took me five years to secure the title.<eos> I'd like to restore it to its original grandeur.
Relative.<eos> He's related to her.<eos> Would you mind telling us what you were doing here?<eos> Urn, this place has always been a family mystery.<eos> No one knows what happened to it or to my great-great-great-whatever grandfather Lachlan.
Alone?<eos> No.<eos> You will take him, because you're the Savior.<eos> You were created to break the curse.<eos> And once again, you can escape it.
Let's face it.<eos> The tree's beaten us.<eos> Hey, we're Pritchetts.<eos> We don't quit.<eos> Besides, all my tools are stuck in it.
Come here.<eos> Okay, that's a shark.<eos> That's what I said!<eos> Jesus!<eos> Stop befriending it!
Fuck!<eos> Have you seen Grace?<eos> She was with the dog.<eos> What?<eos> It was shaking and had diarrhea, or somebody maybe gave it DMT.
Go, go.<eos> Cover the doors!<eos> Where's your trigger? !<eos> Where is it? !<eos> You'd never give it to an ordinary citizen!
Do you want me to use hypnosis on Josef?<eos> Do you want me to solve your murder?<eos> It's our only option.<eos> We are stuck in this investigation.<eos> If I see that boy again then the killer will know about it, and... - He won't find out.
I whip it up. I wrap it around its neck, and I wrestle, wrestle, wrestle him to the ground.<eos> I snap up. I say, "Sit, dragon." Dragon sits.<eos> I say "Stay." Dragon stays.<eos> Now it's got a leash on it.<eos> I take it for a walk.
I snap up. I say, "Sit, dragon." Dragon sits.<eos> I say "Stay." Dragon stays.<eos> Now it's got a leash on it.<eos> I take it for a walk.<eos> And that's where we're at with it now.
The death of my son and the war.<eos> I need to get out of Washington.<eos> And I need a lot of help.<eos> This war ends tonight.<eos> And with it... our millennia of darkness.
Strange, isn't it?<eos> What you're saying reminds me of my childhood.<eos> My father talked about a stone.<eos> A magical and legendary stone.<eos> He'd say, "If you find this stone, set it down before you, "tell it of your suffering and your secrets. "The stone listens.
The boat is ready.<eos> We must do it.<eos> Madam, armored car sighted on Des Voeux Road.<eos> What should we do?<eos> Follow it.
Did you file the motion of continuance? Peabody v. Henderson?<eos> It was sustained.<eos> Good.<eos> Did the judge consider your application for leniency? Rogers v. Yentob?<eos> - He granted it. - Great.
- Okay.<eos> Aren't you gonna say something?<eos> Is this what you want?<eos> The pain doesn't go away.<eos> You just make room for it.
I saw that walker.<eos> I was gonna shoot it.<eos> It was stuck in the mud.<eos> I was throwing rocks at it and stuff.<eos> But I was gonna do it, shoot it right in the head.
- You gotta admit.<eos> - You can't even call it masturbation.<eos> I mean, he's barely three.<eos> Can you cover that? Cover it up.<eos> Well, his penis was fully erect and he was manipulating it.
What's that mean?<eos> She seems set on it, wants to separate.<eos> May even ask for a divorce.<eos> What's that mean for me?<eos> It means enjoy this river, son. Enjoy it while yöu live on it.
Most likely is already too late for you.<eos> You're giving up on us?<eos> I will never give up on the teapot.<eos> I will wait and wait... Until the teapot destroy you,<eos> And then I will follow it to the next owner...
What is all this?<eos> Returning this room to its proper appearance.<eos> Say what you will about the Targaryens, they were conquerors.<eos> That is a seat for a conqueror.<eos> It needs a room to match it, not vines and flowers.
I finally stood up for all of us and told Miss Emily we should be given a proper lunch and not just what's left over from her Baja Fresh.<eos> And she said I shouldn't raise my voice and pulled me really hard into the other room, and my arm came out of its socket.<eos> Are you sure?<eos> Are you sure you didn't just sleep on it funny?<eos> Does this look like I slept on it funny? !
Sergeant.<eos> She's like you?<eos> That's funny.<eos> This case wasn't even on my radar.<eos> But now I'll be sure to give it my full attention.
- No.<eos> This ain't a hotel, son.<eos> You don't get to pick your accommodations.<eos> A new cell, a quiet cell...<eos> I'm gonna pick up this bone now and chew on it.
Come on, then. What we got today, Mr Durdles?<eos> Who's this "we" when he's at home? This is Durdles' dinner entirely, what he is sharing with a workhouse ragamuffin out of the goodness of his heart.<eos> Cheese! Yeah.<eos> Blooming racket's enough to put an honest man off his lunch. Stop, stop, stop, stop!<eos> I know there are a lot of low notes, but when did you hear me say you're allowed to growl like a pack of Bengal tigers? Keep it bright, keep that smile in your mouths. The key note is IS G, but it is an odd form of G minor, so don't root down in mud and boots, think upwards, think of heaven.
You're welcome.<eos> Have a nice evening!<eos> Sorry, Lily.<eos> So, you guys really know how to find this wolf or what?<eos> (IN NORWEGIAN) What do you think you're gonna do to it?
And then I stole all courtesy from heaven. Dressed myself in such humility, that I did pluck allegiance from men's hearts. Loud shouts and salutations from their mouths.<eos> The skipping king, he ambled up and down with shallow jesters and rash bavin wits, mingled his royalty with capering fools, enfeifed himself to popularity.<eos> So when he had occasion to be seen, he was but as the cuckoo is in June, heard, not regarded.<eos> And in that very line, Harry, standest thou. For thou has lost thy princely privilege with vile communication.<eos> Not an eye but is a-weary of thy common sight, save mine, which hath desired to see thee more. Which now doth that I would not have it do, make blind itself with foolish tenderness!
Thou hast robbed me of my youth.<eos> Percy... Thou art... Dust and food...<eos> Fare thee well, great heart.<eos> Ill-weaved ambition, how much art thou shrunk.<eos> When that this body did contain a spirit a kingdom for it was too small a bound, and now, two paces of the vilest earth is room enough.
Gian Luca Ventura"<eos> "My dear Gian Luca, Those who claim time heals all wounds have never loved as much as I have.<eos> I must confess this monstrosity to you:<eos> Neither my husband, nor the unborn child, not even God bring me the slightest remorse for our moments together.<eos> If I curse the day I met you it's because it was followed by the one when we separated.
But watch.<eos> Lissa will be turning around to look at us in three... two... one.<eos> Matty didn't want me to replace him.<eos> So if I was going to get him to back down,<eos> I would have to engage in major display of PDA, and I would do it by...
What about you, sweetcheeks?<eos> I'm still looking for some kind of emotional connection.<eos> I'm starting to think I'm never going to find it.<eos> Which makes me feel sad and... lost and strangely horny, like I want to fuck away the pain.<eos> You take the pain... and you hang onto it.
You can leave us.<eos> If he doesn't get electricity, he will die. But it'll take time.<eos> Not even the process of decomposition killed him right away.<eos> If it's to go faster?<eos> Remove the skull, open it up and remove the content.
To which you, as a prominent contemporary artist, will add... Ostensibly.<eos> So, what don't you like about the plan?<eos> Alex. Is she or is she not going to kill me?<eos> Alex parked the box truck out back.<eos> After they load it up, we follow it to the meet with Spiteri.
But it's not physical, it's mental.<eos> It's like his brain is locked.<eos> Well, there's gotta be a way to fix this.<eos> Possibly, if she used her own blood. What difference does that make?<eos> The only way you can break a blood Zaubertrank is by killing the hexenbiest whose blood is in it.
Mike. Gill.<eos> What do we know?<eos> The lad raised the alarm on his radio when he realised what was happening, so all these other taxi drivers piled in.<eos> They've moved the body, they've walked all over the scene.<eos> We cleared it just as quickly as we got here, Gill, but...
In the meantime, I only hope I still have time to fulfill my obligations.<eos> But if I cannot, you must take my place.<eos> The labyrinth is a symbol of the Grail.<eos> Now, this ring, keep it safe.<eos> The other guardians will know you by it.
Where's he land with this?<eos> He lands with a dead wife.<eos> Hey.<eos> What's going on with you?<eos> This Nero guy... what the hell is it?
So do you have something of theirs, this missing person?<eos> Yes.<eos> - May I see it?<eos> - No.<eos> Pour this on the object and then follow it.
You did nothing wrong.<eos> Let me eat this heart, then we can pick azaleas together.<eos> Jing!<eos> It's my treacherous eyes that brought you to this hell!<eos> Even if I see this skin 1000 times I'd Still be charmed by it.
-Not really.<eos> -Well, maybe not improbable...<eos> -It's survival.<eos> Accepting pain as part of life.<eos> Embracing it instead of avoiding it.
I can't believe we're not going to get married.<eos> Excuse me, I'm going to go see if the couple at the front of the line needs a maid of honor.<eos> So, I tell my wife,<eos> "Get a dog, don't get a dog, I'm not walking it,<eos> I'm not feeding it, I'm not picking up after it."
Excuse me, I'm going to go see if the couple at the front of the line needs a maid of honor.<eos> So, I tell my wife,<eos> "Get a dog, don't get a dog, I'm not walking it,<eos> I'm not feeding it, I'm not picking up after it."<eos> You know you're going to wind up walking it.
You think it's an accident he hired you?<eos> If tenants there are going to buy it at all, they'll buy it from you.<eos> They sure as hell aren't going to from him.<eos> Or is he just testing me?<eos> Watching me to see how far I'll go to keep the job, even though I made it clear from day one why I took it.
And what's he saying?<eos> Yeah, okay, thanks.<eos> That was highway patrol.<eos> They said Granger beat a guy up and stole his pickup.<eos> They put an APB out on it.
- Ubiquitous?<eos> - She's everywhere.<eos> - She's probably watching us now.<eos> A visitor from Tijuana gave me this one.<eos> Plenty of jalapeño gives it a whole lot of bite.
Uh, I'm not telling you to lie, but, uh, if you started to act up, maybe we could build a defense... to get 12 people to, uh, be convinced that, uh... that you can't tell the difference between right and wrong.<eos> You heard me calling?<eos> I don't think I can do this anymore.<eos> Death would be better.<eos> I used to be scared of it, but I'm not afraid anymore.
Where is he?<eos> Up here!<eos> Look up here!<eos> Cam, what are you doing up there?<eos> I came down to say goodbye to the tree, give it one final hug, and before I knew it, I was up here.
We know you down to your liver, man.<eos> The other day, I was walking home. I saw a bug on the sidewalk.<eos> I didn't step on it, just kept going.<eos> Then I thought about it and went back.<eos> - Did you ask it for a date, too?
On The Bird with the Crystal Plumage Lombardo was the only one who had trust in Dario as a director.<eos> After the first half of the shoot, however, they wanted to replace him with Ferdinando Baldi.<eos> Only the severe resistance from father Salvatore and Dario himself prevented that Dario had to leave the movie prematurely.<eos> Lombardo gave in and let Dario finish the film.<eos> But when he saw the film he didn't like it.
We even met a conductor who asked us when he saw the camera:<eos> "Well, what's this for?"<eos> You didn't see that many cameras around back in the days.<eos> He even invited us to the cockpit and we got some great shots from there.<eos> In Rome I gave the film stock to Dario, he had it developed and liked it.
I'm not a cop here, Fermin, but if you want my help, you need to tell me what he left in your cab.<eos> He left a laptop.<eos> He left it underneath the seat.<eos> He must have forgot.<eos> What'd you do with it?
Who are you?<eos> - What do you want?<eos> - It's captain Marat.<eos> What's in the rucksack?<eos> Take it away!
This is the face of someone who has fought long and hard for the good of the people without caring much for any of them.<eos> And I look a lot worse without my wig.<eos> The people elected me to represent them, to lead them, and I lead.<eos> I admire your zeal, Mr. Stevens and I have tried to profit from the example of it, but if I'd listened to you, I'd have declared every slave free the minute the first shell struck Fort Sumter.<eos> And the border states would have gone over to the Confederacy, the war would have been lost and the Union along with it, and instead of abolishing slavery as we hope to do in two weeks, we'd be watching, helpless as infants, as it spread
Now, Cornell, when it comes to working with a bull, charm's the last thing required.<eos> You know, any living creature needs to know who's in charge.<eos> They can sense when a man's power is, shall we say, in full strength, and when a man's power is, shall we say, not.<eos> First of all, can't do anything with a bull without a bull hook, can you?<eos> And with it, you must claim the role of master immediately.
We're lost.<eos> We have no food, no garments, no meat, nothing!<eos> We have each other.<eos> The compass points north.<eos> We shall follow it still.
I'll need to take a look at that generator as well because your power's out.<eos> - Why have you barricaded the door?<eos> - To stop people bringing the infection.<eos> I thought it was against the risk of a virus.<eos> Everything we do here is to minimize the risk, not just of the virus but of people trying to escape it.
It never occurred to us that we might actually find it, but find it we did.<eos> It ripped my best friend in half.<eos> Quickly.<eos> And then it was on me.<eos> I hacked and hacked at it with my axe.
Tell me.<eos> Tell me who it is.<eos> Give me a name.<eos> It wants her, not you.<eos> If you wish to save yourselves, simply give it what it wants.
- Well, we'll cover it, right?<eos> Dale's got it.<eos> KENNY:<eos> Seriously, yeah?<eos> - Uh, I actually can't cover it.
No.<eos> Then let's play a game.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I'm thinking of a dog.<eos> What about it?
- He set the bar pretty high, didn't he? - Heh.<eos> Kal-El would never embrace his dark side and because of that, he will die here.<eos> But you, you can be saved.<eos> If you're brave enough to walk along that darker path.<eos> You have to honor it.
Hm. Awkward.<eos> Excuse me. Who are you?<eos> Uh, lntelligence Analyst Nell Jones.<eos> The algorithm, as used by Chambers, is unproven, and no replacement for human intel.<eos> Yeah, I've played around with it a fair bit.
- Rick!<eos> - All right.<eos> All right, I'll call the building manager.<eos> Yesterday, the stove comes on completely by itself.<eos> Yeah, now we just need to teach it to make us breakfast.
Run.<eos> - What happened?<eos> - Klaus is in Alaric's body.<eos> - What?<eos> - He's possessing it or something.
The oldest vampire in the history of time is coming after me?<eos> - [AS KLAUS] Katerina, I have missed you.<eos> - Klaus.<eos> Klaus is in Alaric's body.<eos> He's possessing it.
Well, it could be worse.<eos> It is worse!<eos> Oh! They're flying Manhattan into the sun!<eos> They must have been out of piranhas.<eos> They're gonna kill the virus by exposing it to the heat of our burning bodies!
The gelatinous dance of peace.<eos> You may be gelatinous, but not even the Mochi Phantom could perform such intricate motions!<eos> Says you, salaryman.<eos> Behold: the dance of peace.<eos> The dance is so complex, I can't barely follow it.
It's good to be home.<eos> Yeah, it's powerful here.<eos> I've seen a thousand times, but... I still try to see it anew every time I come back.<eos> Right on the edge of the biggest volcanoes in the world, it's lively, it's electric.<eos> I've dedicated a big part of my life to riding here. Now this place is a part of me as much as I am a part of it.
Henry, is everything okay?<eos> I don't feel well.<eos> I think it's the wine.<eos> Yeah.<eos> There's something in it.
Zane's almost got the P.A.L. system running again. - I'm going down.<eos> - Keep me apprised.<eos> Dr. Martin, you're overseeing the transfer of the FTL drive.<eos> Yes, it's already being moved to a secure location off-site.<eos> Okay, great, you should stay with it and I'll get in touch with you as soon as everything in here is under control.
Earth.<eos> This planet.<eos> So, this is your game plan?<eos> Our planet.<eos> Show it pictures, hope it says the word in Skitterese?
Why would you pay such a sum for a shit Gaul?<eos> Shit?<eos> Do you not see the promise in his eyes?<eos> The spark smoldering in his breast?<eos> I would give it tender, to ignite in the arena!
Why would you pay such a sum for a shit Gaul?<eos> Shit?<eos> Do you not see the promise in his eyes?<eos> The spark smoldering in his breast?<eos> I would give it tender, to ignite in the arena!
- Well, it's his decision.<eos> - His decision?<eos> Idiots like this shouldn't be allowed to make any...<eos> It is his body, okay?<eos> And you don't get to say what he can and can't do with it.
A blasphemer and a heretic.<eos> You frighten me, sometimes.<eos> War is ugly, Cardinal.<eos> Far uglier than I could ever be.<eos> One should approach it with extreme circumspection.
Damn, I wanna have it off with a guy...for shit sake!<eos> There was guy who found a penguin on the beach.<eos> He asked a policeman what he should do with it.<eos> And the policeman said:<eos> "You should take it to the zoo."
He asked a policeman what he should do with it.<eos> And the policeman said:<eos> "You should take it to the zoo."<eos> The guy said: "Yes. Good idea.<eos> I'll take it to the zoo."
The guy said: "Yes. Good idea.<eos> I'll take it to the zoo."<eos> Two days later, the same policeman's doing his rounds, and he ran into the same guy, still with the penguin.<eos> So he said:<eos> "Haven't you taken it to the zoo yet?"
You know I did.<eos> So help me.<eos> All right, if Nadia's in imminent danger, we need proof to take to Joan.<eos> Stay on your surveil and initiate the compromised asset protocol.<eos> Make sure you do a head tail-- the van can't know you're following it if you're in front of it.
- There you go.<eos> Yeah, yeah, yeah.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Oh, my g-- I let this happen.<eos> I'm like t-the Joe Pisarcik of greeting-card execs, dropping the ball so Herm Edwards can run it back for the win.
- This is the real thing!<eos> - Give me some! - Wait for the go!<eos> That booze... It was bribery.<eos> Buried with it was a thick envelope.<eos> In it was a few letters.
Good morning, sinners.<eos> I can say that because I'm a sinner, too.<eos> I know the dark path of drink and debauchery.<eos> I traveled it well.
- I'm so sorry.<eos> Is that okay?<eos> - No, it was great.<eos> I just it felt so good, and sensual.<eos> - Hey! - You want me to wiggle it around?
Kiss me.<eos> Piss off!<eos> The joint's covered in sand.<eos> It's a summer joint.<eos> The sand gives it a holiday flavour.
This moral crusade doesn't suit you.<eos> The Zoe Morgan I know is reasonable.<eos> Knows when to make a smart play.<eos> I'll get you the report.<eos> I'll bring you right to it.
My dad was a butcher. That's fine.<eos> We've got a lot of things.<eos> Bosiger is looking for you.<eos> Aw, a rabbit.<eos> Can I give it a leaf
If I was trying to look sexy, something would inevitably be stuck in my teeth.<eos> Dairy was not my friend.<eos> And if given the opportunity, my mom would embarrass me.<eos> - Do you think this push-up bra is doing its job?<eos> - Yes, but just give it the day off. - Okay.
That created everything!<eos> But the question is:<eos> Nothingness!<eos> And now the void is dissolving our universe!<eos> Because it doesn't like it anymore... or it saw something ugly out there.
I couldn't tell when my first wife was coming, but I can sure tell when a storm is coming.<eos> All right, so what's the plan?<eos> What are we gonna do if it does snow?<eos> You're so white, I'm worried we're gonna lose you.<eos> I love the snow. Opening my balcony doors and watching it fall like fresh white linen and then running across the street to the park to make snow angels.
Allah give me patience.<eos> My sultan, the messenger is waiting for the letter.<eos> I should take it to him.<eos> It will reach İbrahim for sure, right, Gülfem?<eos> Don't worry. I will give it to the treasurer's messenger.
You're the smartest person I know, and that's... that's, like, the most beautiful thing.<eos> Remember what you were saying about generative processes?<eos> Genius. It helped me a lot at work.<eos> Yeah, I just meant that if your robot could learn more if it was exposed to more environments.<eos> Well, you're probably right, but I don't think anyone's gonna let me take it out for a walk.
Exactly.<eos> Well, why would the military be testing a butterfly?<eos> A butterfly has two stages of life.<eos> It's one of the few creatures with a demonstrated ability to abruptly change its body structure.<eos> That makes it a wonderful Alpha test subject.
Interesting.<eos> Is there anything to help us I.D. Him?<eos> Dental records were inconclusive.<eos> We do have the remnants of a belt, Which means the man probably had a wallet on him Which would likely still be inside the shark,<eos> Until it's digested. At the very least, we could find a finger in there We could get a print off of.
-I didn't kill him.<eos> -I know.<eos> That's why I'm still talking to you.<eos> I thought Concordia was an agricultural settlement.<eos> Before the end of our wars, they turned it into a mining base.
War is intolerable!<eos> We have been deceived into thinking that we must be a part of it.<eos> I say the moment we committed to fighting, we already lost.<eos> Excuse me, Your Grace, are you suggesting we oppose the war on humanitarian grounds?<eos> I'm going to oppose it as an affront to life itself.
I sure do.<eos> Remember that ring?<eos> I took it off the first girl we ever did together.<eos> You loved it so much.<eos> Kept asking what happened to it.
I'm sorry.<eos> I have to go.<eos> We're deploying in 3 days.<eos> Let me get you the afteraction report from Zirmaya.<eos> Taw will be back with it in 2 minutes.
But all I gotta do is this.<eos> And this.<eos> And then he doesn't feel so Catholic anymore.<eos> When I was a girl in Ireland, a raggedy man would come round every spring with a little bantam rooster.<eos> He'd trained it to peck out The Mountains of Mourne on a toy piano that hung off his chest.
Right... OK, specific detail!<eos> Amy!<eos> Amy!<eos> You saw my ad in the paper shop window.<eos> Yes, with this right above it. Which is odd, because Amy hasn't written it yet.
You really think that I would kill a dog?<eos> Well, what was I supposed to think?<eos> I don't know.<eos> How about I didn't kill a dog?<eos> Just tell me what you did with it.
Even higher.<eos> Look, Jules has some Travis issues, so she's gonna steamroll you.<eos> She's like a shark, Kristen.<eos> Do you know what you do when a shark comes at you?<eos> You punch it in the nose.
Where did you find him?<eos> He was in my shoe.<eos> They don't have a very good sense of smell.<eos> Well, Max is gonna be thrilled.<eos> Why don't you go give it to him?
- Have you got him?<eos> - Yes!<eos> Turn the head around.<eos> Go over there!<eos> Shove it in!
- Here's a copy of the program for the dedication.<eos> - Oh, I e-mailed you the program that we worked up.<eos> Right.<eos> I saw the draft.<eos> This just fine-tunes it.
The neural interface.<eos> The chair?<eos> I believe it can cure her.<eos> Look, it's relatively simple.<eos> From what I've learned so far, I believe the chair Will not allow any non-human to interface with it.
- The chest.<eos> He hit you in the forehead?<eos> Yes.<eos> So he was facing you while he unsheathed himself.<eos> And yet he had a stone that you did not see until he hit you with it.
Tiny splash marks on her right heel and calf not present on the left.<eos> She was dragging a wheeled suitcase behind her with her right hand. Don't get that splash pattern any other way.<eos> Smallish case, going by the spread.<eos> Case that size, woman this clothes-conscious could only be an overnight bag so we know she was staying one night.<eos> - Where is it? What have you done with it?
No, no, leave it!<eos> I have it how I like it!<eos> How you like it?<eos> ! No, no, no, Jen, it's infected!<eos> If this was a human being, I'd shoot it in the face!
These traps, they're humane.<eos> They do not kill the animal.<eos> If you ever used those things before you'd know that they malfunction, misfire, break the beaver's legs. - Oh.<eos> - That's not true.<eos> Then you'd have to shoot the beaver or hit it over the head with a shovel. - Oh.
As of this moment, we go after Moreau, it's a choice, not a necessity.<eos> You're right.<eos> But we've never been in this situation before.<eos> I mean, we have a chance to take out Damien Moreau before he causes more damage.<eos> We didn't choose this fight, but we're in it and we should see it through.
No, no.<eos> Stick your hand out.<eos> I'm not... no, no, no, no, no.<eos> Stick it in there.<eos> Stick it in.
Stick it in.<eos> You know you want to.<eos> You know you do.<eos> All right, now, maybe... maybe just...<eos> you know you want... Stick it in.
Finn Haugan?<eos> The hunters say they don't think it's bear tracks.<eos> That's ridiculous.<eos> What kind of tracks would they be then?<eos> It's a bear with bear tracks leading to it.
There must be a secret entrance.<eos> Did he say where?<eos> I'm sorry, that's all I know.<eos> Then your work is not yet done, Sister.<eos> When you find the entrance, you must lead us to it.
I really like that part about the parking meter.<eos> That sounds like dad.<eos> It does.<eos> The robot takes "d" batteries!<eos> And parts of it were assembled in mexico!
- You killed our child.<eos> And with it, us.<eos> - Let's start with the most obvious.<eos> There's a big difference between a child and a dog.<eos> A dog loves you unconditionally, as long as you feed it.
- Martha told you. - No, she did not.<eos> I know that you take a magic marker and you draw a face on your penis.<eos> Is that against the law?<eos> I don't think so.<eos> And you put a little hat on it, and you call it Sammy.
Our invasion wasn't about weapon forges.<eos> It was about this dagger.<eos> After the battle, Tus asked for this dagger as tribute.<eos> I didn't think anything of it, but now I see.<eos> With it he could change anything.
How is this going to work? .<eos> Basically, it works like a ramp.<eos> The train comes along, this piece here will lift the flange and pull it outside the rail.<eos> That will cause the train to flip over on its right-hand side.<eos> Son of a bitch won 't even know what hit it.
The puck goes into the corner, where Nubin chases it down.<eos> -What's the matter with him?<eos> -What's up with Donnelly?<eos> Get in there, Donnelly! Get in there!<eos> The puck squirts loose. Now Donnelly picks it up skates to the point, looking to set up a play.
Here.<eos> Take it.<eos> - You're okay?<eos> - Merlin's ring.<eos> It's been a while since I've been this close to it.
Or the dreams of the less fortunate in this world?<eos> Is there a price to them?<eos> Or are you all in despair at your inability to change what is wrong in this world?<eos> You see, I had a dream.<eos> But I too, walked away from it.
If he was not deported, he wouldn't be here.<eos> - Don't think in that bullshit.<eos> - It's not bullshit.<eos> Do you see that train?<eos> That's our train, what do you say if we grab it and go all the way to Texas?
It wasn't for myself.<eos> It wasn't...<eos> I just thought it would be nice to have a bottle handy, in case we had guests.<eos> But you didn't go in.<eos> Mm-mm. The key, to me is not that you had the urge but that you resisted it.
Dr. Finkel.<eos> Dr. Finkel.<eos> It is my pleasure, Mr. Wolfson, until you fail and I take over, of course.<eos> Gravity, behave.<eos> I don't know what's more unsettling, that you accessorize with that brainless rodent, or that you converse with it too.
I wasn't a weakling like my son!<eos> I drove them through the forest!<eos> The fiercest of all I caught in a trap I built myself!<eos> Therefore, rule number 1:<eos> You have a head so you can go through a wall with it!
You again, Kanna Endo...<eos> He wouldn't put himself in such a dangerous spot.<eos> I told you, the robot was remote-controlled!<eos> Is that what it looks like?<eos> They're confronting it!
They're after the memory stick.<eos> He wasn't carrying anything.<eos> Did you check his pockets?<eos> All of them. He had nothing.<eos> That's why everybody's still looking for it.
Reputed to have whacked one "Dog" Paulson back when our bandidos were wresting the crank trade away from the SoCal biker gangs.<eos> Also, we're pretty sure he knifed a Mexican national in '03.<eos> And for my money, seeing how he customarily deals with rivals I'd say he is a prime suspect in the disappearance of our dearly missed Krazy-8.<eos> Hats over your heart for that dirtball.<eos> We hauled Tuco in for questioning on that but we couldn't make it stick.
There's a commercial airliner flying from L.A. to Guam.<eos> It's going to go right through your window.<eos> Ajira Airways, flight 316.<eos> If you have any hope of the island bringing you back, it must be that plane.<eos> You all need to be on it.
Norton Construction just sent this over.<eos> Whoa, mama!<eos> I love Great Lakes wine.<eos> You can have the wine.<eos> I want to take that cheese and do terrible things to it.
The killer's dead,Abby.<eos> Should've cut down that tree a long time ago.<eos> Come on,come on.<eos> Let's get out of here.<eos> Look,sooner or later I was gonna walk past that tree,so I thought... why not get it out of the way?
Perhaps too clever, Ranakar.<eos> We should have seen the signs.<eos> Until Sinestro gets an opportunity to explain himself, I remain skeptical.<eos> One thing's for sure, you took the ring off the wrong guy.<eos> You ask me, you should give it back.
And one last thing about my girlfriend that I think both of y'all need to know.<eos> The reason that Jessica calls me all late like she does is that she's a vampire.<eos> I can't work.<eos> And why is that?<eos> Because every time I look at that pool table, I keep seeing you on it, and then I can't think about anything else.
Velociraptor's was maybe six feet, at the most.<eos> And "Jurassic Park" made, - a billion dollars?<eos> - Who's scared of a bird?<eos> You would be if it was picking out your guts with a giant beak.<eos> Constance, How big would a bird have to be for you like to be supper scare of it.
I-I went to the mess for five minutes, and when I got back, he was already on the chair.<eos> Well, the convulsions have stopped, but he's completely unresponsive.<eos> He's basically in a deep catatonic state.<eos> Is there anything you can do for him?<eos> We could try a high dose of lorazepam, see if it'll bring him out of it, but I'm flying blind here.
The movie is a purification quest but also a quest for everything that can be spiritual in the carnal aspects of our body something spiritual in the material.<eos> I can't enter the viewers' heads.<eos> There's the viewer who will love it and watches it until the end the viewer who will watch it until the end without loving it the viewer who will leave the movie after a while...<eos> I think an author shouldn't be in the viewer's head.<eos> A viewer should feel free to like the film or not to ask himself questions about it or to just watch it.
Have you seen Phil or a blood trail that could lead to Phil?<eos> He's not here.<eos> And I'm stuck.<eos> Maybe the meat blob's not taking in enough nutrients.<eos> I guess I could try and give it a mouth.
I don't need any help.<eos> And besides, my Parisian salad doesn't call for any chives.<eos> Yes.<eos> I've always thought it was a bit bland.<eos> I think the chives will give it the bite it's so sorely lacking.
Ted, tell me he wrote you a check.<eos> Tell me he wrote you a big, fat check.<eos> A check so big it doesn't take its shirt off when it goes swimming.<eos> That is a big, fat check.<eos> A check so big, if you had sex with it, you wouldn't tell your buddies.
On an unrelated topic, how would one go about un-sending an e-mail?<eos> - Sit.<eos> - Sitting.<eos> So, how was your day?<eos> Honestly, I'd have to gi it a c-minus, which is, coincidentally, the grade that Courtney got on her polar-bear project.
I don't know why everybody loves Graham so much.<eos> I went to camp with the guy, and he's a...<eos> He's a creep.<eos> What? You knew him this whole time?<eos> I had a plan from the beginning. And I should have stuck to it.
- I like to think it stings a little.<eos> Jules, if you don't torch this cocky bastard, then I will.<eos> - No, no, I want to do it.<eos> - What is this weird mirror?<eos> No! Stay away from it.
Wait.<eos> The lift's working!<eos> This is our chance.<eos> Jo...<eos> 'Try to turn Lambert's group against him before he blows it up.'
Another all-nighter.. There we go.<eos> I've been playing years and he thinks he can wallop me!<eos> Hand these out to the poor.<eos> Give the feathers to the women for stuffing pillows and whatnot.<eos> It makes me crazy knowing he has the diamond and not being able to get it.
This will be an exercise and I want you to concentrate.<eos> And no matter what I say, I want your expression to remain neutral.<eos> That will be easy.<eos> You're here in the corridor at your employment, and you see a very pretty young woman walking toward you, and her blouse is tight and is rather bursting at the buttons, and she drops her pencil,<eos> and as she bends to retrieve it, her blouse parts, revealing the cleavage of her soft, round, white mounds.
Thank you...<eos> We're done here. Let's back to work.<eos> There are men who possess an extraordinary masculine potency.<eos> The sexual wind that blows in the loins of these men is more fiery than windy in nature.<eos> He is possessed of two tent-like formations that surround the trunk of all masculine powers and reinforce it and make it erect.
I'm the fairy todd something.<eos> Well, step aside, lest you be dealt with.<eos> Turk, wand.<eos> Yeah, um, about the wand,<eos> I may have let the idiot borrow it.
Just like those fricking mice.<eos> May they rest in peace.<eos> Good morning, ma'am.<eos> Your body needs pampering.<eos> Lavish on it the care it deserves.
I can smell it from here.<eos> I can't help it.<eos> The demon told me to finish off everything in the house today.<eos> It doesn't want me to get exorcised.<eos> Yeah, next time you and your demon have a little chat, you can tell it to go out and get a damn job.
25 and 3 in '78.<eos> Red ruffing.<eos> What do you know about it?<eos> I know his curve ball droppednlike it fell off a table.<eos> All you could do is wave at it.
All right.<eos> I'm pulling in.<eos> I don't see you.<eos> That's the point, but I see you.<eos> Now hang up, get out of the car, leave the money in the trunk, and make him come to it.
"Ram - Ayatollah, II"<eos> Hey, I heard Bob's doing really good with his used car line out in Arizona. - I just don't see how he...?<eos> - For this...? Bob is going to dust off the old turban<eos> - Yeah?<eos> - Yeah. Well, let's bring it.
And we came very close to catching it, for it was slow to get up.<eos> But just when we were almost on it, my friend couldn't control himself any longer and let out a cry.<eos> And had we been there but a moment sooner, we surely would have seized it and torn it apart like the rabbit.<eos> How it would have tasted, I cannot tell.<eos> So we told it what a great cowardly, unsmelling thing it was and if we ever caught up with it, it would surely regret it.
Hope you like your room.<eos> I only moved in last night, and it already feels like home.<eos> Thank you for letting me stay here, lex.<eos> Taking another look at your alleged biography?<eos> Yeah, i thought i'd give it another try.
On me and everybody else here.<eos> It's not t. B. Excuse us a second.<eos> Cancer explains the symptoms.<eos> A tumor in her lung or kidney that threw a clot to the other organ.<eos> And you're worried the tumor might overhear, realize we're on to it.
Hey, new guy!<eos> I know it's a rule to have your helmet on all times but this is lounge... relax.<eos> But if there's an incident?<eos> If I am not prepared someone can strike me in a head.<eos> Give it a wake. He'll loosen up.
For as long as I can keep it at bay.<eos> I just don't understand why it's reacting this way.<eos> I mean, if we go too deep, the sub will implode, and you'll die, and the parasite will lose you as a host.<eos> I don't think it's a rational, thinking life form, Will.<eos> It likely invades a host, lives in it for as long as it can, and then moves on.
Yes!<eos> Here's to us.<eos> Where's my fucking coat?<eos> I'd like it back.<eos> You can wave to it at your trial.
I'm a jock who's too cool for sports.<eos> - It's the final book!<eos> - I wonder what happens?<eos> Maybe the Sandrux is the Narcolops.<eos> I read a rumor Spider-man's in it. Shut up!
You impugn my honour!<eos> Yeah. I'm really glad you didn't say belittle cos then I'd have a field day. But poison gas?<eos> That's the weapon of a coward and you know it.<eos> Staal, you could blast this planet out of the sky.<eos> And yet you're sitting up above watching it die.
Bit pissed.<eos> Been to the Black Bull first just to sharpen up.<eos> This is a new Simon.<eos> You cried when your dad poured whisky over the Christmas pudding.<eos> At least I didn't make myself sick in my plate when it had peas on it!
We need at least 347 tons up here.<eos> Shoot that dog, Corporal!<eos> Sir, {shouldn't we be saving our rounds for enemy combatants? } we should save our rounds for the enemy.<eos> Shoot that fucking dog!<eos> Darnold, give it a piece of your jerky.
Where are we?<eos> I couldn't tell you.<eos> Walter's hiding something. He's being as cryptic as ever.<eos> He says he had to keep the cylinder safe.<eos> That someone is looking for it.
I know that he loved you very much, and I know that you're gonna miss him.<eos> And we're really gonna miss him,too.<eos> But what about his cape?<eos> Jamie,he'S... jamie,honey,listen to me.<eos> He's gonna like it.You'll see.
I don't know.<eos> I mean, one bad movie and this is what happens?<eos> I mean, was I really that awful?<eos> Straight up, Vinnie, the movie was awful.<eos> And yes, you were awful in it.
Until I know the truth, I'm holding them all responsible.<eos> They were seen an hour ago heading into the city.<eos> I will not allow murder to go unpunished.<eos> I used to love this place.<eos> Now it just gives me the creeps.
It's like... Individually they're all different, but they're all the same as well.<eos> There you go... Look, if you'd had some wine beforehand the food would only have tasted of wine.<eos> Like this, the wine goes with it.<eos> The first taste is the most important.<eos> Because the second follows it.
Is it usual for Uther to chain his friends to a dungeon wall?<eos> The stone.<eos> You took it to the forge.<eos> Why?<eos> With it a man can alter the very essence of things.
That is not Bolt.<eos> Well, that depends on how you look at it.<eos> You know, when I was little, I wanted a bicycle for my birthday, but my parents got me a baseball glove.<eos> So, you know what I did?<eos> I pretended that baseball glove was a bicycle, and I rode it to school every day.
We can't let him... march on the valley, take his revenge.<eos> He'll...<eos> Your mind is like this water, my friend.<eos> When it is agitated, it becomes difficult to see.<eos> But if you allow it to settle the answer becomes clear.
They overpowered the guards and released Baader by force of arms. My God, the children!<eos> Go, children, run.<eos> Quickly.<eos> We say: The uniform-wearer is a pig, not a human.<eos> And so we treat it as such.
I think we're asking the wrong questions.<eos> What questions should we be asking?<eos> Well, let's start with this.<eos> Where is our satellite?<eos> We lost contact with it.
I'm helping bambi.<eos> So get me the ambu bag and the sane.I'm starting an I.V.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Still no sign of burke.Oh,you've got a severed arm.<eos> My arm.Mine.Get away from it.
The paint will be on you soon.<eos> Looking good, Johnny.<eos> I just talked to the store, E will have the desk this afternoon.<eos> Yeah, great.<eos> Well, he better love it or you're paying for my therapy.
# But I know # A change gonna come<eos> # Oh, yes, it will...<eos> The future is for my children, for our young people.<eos> This isn't just Chávez's struggle, it's our struggle.<eos> What Chávez has unleashed is a recognition of this struggle, and we are in it together and we'll carry on fighting.
I mean, maybe these people do just wanna destroy themselves.<eos> Maybe it is a losing battle.<eos> - That you or that demon girl talking?<eos> - Oh, it's me.<eos> The demon is dead. And so is that hot girl it was possessing.
I won't tell Ned.<eos> I'll leave that up to you.<eos> I keep the booze by my bed.<eos> John Joseph.<eos> If you're... scared of a ghost, confront it.
Those self-esteem classes are really helping out, Nathan.<eos> - Got a great team.<eos> It's safe.<eos> Here's to scientific leaps and the beginning of the universe.<eos> Vincent, baby, gimme a bird on a raft, keep off the grass, and pin a rose to it, will ya?
The next tool for profit and control is war.<eos> Since the inception of the Federal Reserve in 1913, a number of large and small wars have commenced. The 3 most pronounced were World War I, World War II, and Vietnam. World War I.<eos> In 1914, European wars broke out centered around England and Germany.<eos> The American public wanted nothing to do with the war, in turn President Wilson publicly declared neutrality.<eos> However, under the surface, the US administration was looking for any excuse they could find to enter it.
It's pitiful to place a kappa in front of excited crowds in its current state, don't you think?<eos> Are we keeping it?<eos> Your brother wants to keep it. Really?<eos> It's so weak.<eos> Why don't we help it?
At night, he was vicious and ruthless like a monster.<eos> He woke up every morning with blood all over his body, never remembered what he had done the night before.<eos> Ramil lived a wild and reckless life<eos> like the specter shadowing him.<eos> But the more he used the specter, the more his body became like it.
Hrothgar!<eos> Hrothgar!<eos> Hrothgar!<eos> Hrothgar! He faced a demon dragon When other men would freeze<eos> And then, my lords, he took his sword And brought it to its knees...
Wake up!<eos> ..there was a tree. It had leaves and they were all new and green.<eos> It had... silver branches and a bird would come every day and sing in the tree.<eos> It would sing and sing and sing.<eos> It was... it was a bloody good singer, this bird, but... but it was only small and brown and... and then this woman, this beautiful woman used to come and listen to it and... and... um... and...
But maybe it is worth it?<eos> To die free is better then to live in a cage?<eos> Mademoiselle, a little more... and I will suspect you are preparing a coupe!<eos> Why don't you execute me then, like you have executed your pigeon!<eos> By the way, sire, the falcon is also your slave... since he flies only where it's master tells it to!
What kind of surprise!<eos> Did therewith you not calculate, what?<eos> Actually I wanted only one...<eos> Then I saw you!<eos> Because above on the tower, how you have rumgeturtelt with it there!
Not magic.<eos> In our golden age, when blood flowed like wine, and flesh flowed like, well, much thicker wine, we learned that our existence is reliant on a rare mineral we call 'Nether Stone.'<eos> It's securely locked and hidden away here at Berm-Tech, and it's vital to our survival.<eos> Nether Stone radiates and enriches the enzyme in our heart.<eos> As long as we're within a mile of it, and continue to feast, we can live healthy lives.
Have you seen a shark before?<eos> - No.<eos> Excellent! We're eating shark!<eos> Zane!<eos> Whack it with this!
- No.<eos> Excellent! We're eating shark!<eos> Zane!<eos> Whack it with this!<eos> Whack it with this!
Mr. Yee...<eos> I recognized your voice.<eos> The collar can be a little more snug.<eos> Yes.<eos> It looks much better with a narrow collar.
The heat on my tooth... See the dentist.<eos> No thanks!<eos> He's a champion extractor.<eos> If I listened to him I'd have nothing but bought teeth.<eos> If it doesn't move, pull it!
What'd she say?<eos> She thinks the deadline doesn't mean shit.<eos> What do you think?<eos> I think she's been on this movie five minutes.<eos> We've been chasing it two years.
Hey, I've been ordered to play.<eos> -Passes with or without goal-kicks?<eos> -Without. -I've done that all afternoon.<eos> -And I care?<eos> Since faith is life and those who have not the courage to profess a faith and live it, show blatant...
Well, up until a moment ago, I wanted your death, but now it seems you have something I need.<eos> What?<eos> The emerald.<eos> You know where it is.<eos> Don't tell me you haven't dreamed of it, heard it calling to you begging to be found from its dark hiding place.
- What have you got ?<eos> - We're in trouble.<eos> Took you five minutes to figure that out ? You're slipping, buddy.<eos> The satellite is basically a stripped-down ship. There's an engine, a shield and navigational systems.<eos> There's a small power source to take it to its target and power it until the gate's dialed.
This is the last time you become anybody.<eos> Ever. No.<eos> Dean, wait.<eos> What's the advantage of this plan?<eos> I mean, fainting now wouldn't help it survive.
How can you be sure?<eos> You're my daughter.<eos> See?<eos> There's nothing so terrible about death.<eos> When you finally face it, it's beautiful.
You're a liar, you windbag.<eos> Gug goog!<eos> What are you gug-googing at?<eos> Don't give it any more to drink...<eos> Peadar himself told me you brought a big billy goat into the pub out of drunken tomfoolery and that you began to comb its goatee and to feed it por1er and that you gave Tomas Inside a big hug.
Real as my love for my unborn baby.<eos> So what exactly is your plan, Travis?<eos> - Our ancestors came here from another world.<eos> Maybe there's still other worlds out there with life forms like us.<eos> Maybe there's even a world where they've learned to live with the planet instead of just on it.
- I don't think Vince is gonna wanna go.<eos> - Why not?<eos> He and I kind of have different views on the movie.<eos> - Different how?<eos> - Well, he likes it.
- Why not?<eos> He and I kind of have different views on the movie.<eos> - Different how?<eos> - Well, he likes it.<eos> He likes it?
Let's see if we can access the database on this.<eos> "In London lies a knight a Pope interred."<eos> Compounding keywords:<eos> Knight, Pope, Grail.<eos> Your precious treasure was almost lost, and with it, my fortune.
He would be found lying on his back on his bed with a copy of Ayn Rand's The Fountainhead and an unfinished letter to Exxon protesting the cancellation of his gas credit card.<eos> That way, he would indict the system and achieve something by his death over and above what the death itself achieved.<eos> At the last moment, he changed his mind on a decisive issue and decided to drink the pills with a connoisseur wine instead of Ripple or Thunderbird.<eos> So he set off on one last drive, over to Tiny's Liquors which specialized in fine wines and bought a bottle of 2001 Azalea Springs Merlot which set him back almost $ 70.<eos> Back home again, he uncorked the wine, let it breathe, drank a few glasses of it and tried to think of something meaningful, but could not.
There will be consequences, wait and see!<eos> I owe you a debt of gratitude.<eos> Take this ring It will grant you three wishes<eos> How so?<eos> Rotate it, and speak your wish clearly Then your wish shall be fullfilled.
You're leaving the shrink?<eos> Among others.<eos> Let's start from scratch.<eos> I've begun another relationship.<eos> I want to see what it leads to.
So call your friend. From now on, make sure I see everything first.<eos> Okay.<eos> You ever play chess?<eos> What does that have to do with any of this?<eos> He made a move and you countered and he liked it.
And by the time this tape is finished, you will have one minute to find a way out...<eos> At the end of that minute you should know better than anyone what happens then.<eos> There is a simple key that will unlock the harness, Kerry.<eos> It is right in front of you.<eos> All you have to do is reach in and take it.
Jack, you should know that Curtis and his team intercepted a terrorist at the hospital.<eos> Did they take him into custody?<eos> No. He's dead.<eos> But they found a nerve gas canister.<eos> They're trying to disarm it now.
So I take it you guys heard about Chicken.<eos> Rooster.<eos> And yes, we sensed it.<eos> That's why we were so afraid the staff had been stolen.<eos> The moment it was out of his hands, we began tracking it to you.
I trusted you with it.<eos> I trusted you not to cheat and break my heart.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> What... what did you do with it?
So far from home.<eos> If you want to get back home, we can help.<eos> Why would I leave this place?<eos> A world of industry, of workforce and warfare.<eos> - I could turn it to such purpose.
Good job my mum's not here, she'd be fighting the wolf off with her bare hands for that thing.<eos> - And she'd win.<eos> -Where is the wolf?<eos> - I don't trust this silence.<eos> -Why do you travel with it?
Let's at least wait for reinforcements.<eos> Waiting will put the lives of others at risk.<eos> Volnek was clever enough to disable the Eye of the Gods.<eos> The missing crystal is in his possession.<eos> The only way we can return to Earth is to retrieve it and the only way that we can do that is by killing Volnek.
We expect great things from you, doctor.<eos> Along with your new responsibilities, you'll have a higher security clearance.<eos> You already know about the ring, of course.<eos> - Yes, sir.<eos> - What you don't know is that we've used it to visit over a dozen inhabited worlds.
-Good.<eos> Well, it doesn't surprise me.<eos> It's tried to stop me before.<eos> -The demon has?<eos> JOHN: It knows I'm close.
You didn't give me air, your jailers did!<eos> They set this up all those years ago.<eos> They need me alive.<eos> Because if you're escaping, then I've got to stop you!<eos> If I destroy your prison, your body is destroyed, your mind with it.
With Karl, it hit me.<eos> I didn't have to worry about how I felt because the thunderbolt told me.<eos> Yeah, yeah, gotta love the thunderbolt.<eos> Do I, though?<eos> I mean, I do, but I don't trust it anymore.
- I'm all yours.<eos> - So all the ice trucks in Miami - bit of a coincidence, don't you think?<eos> - Sure, during business hours.<eos> But this time of night, a truck like that sticks out.<eos> And you followed it.
He is in the van, in the garage in the back of 2249 Polk Street.<eos> The key gonna be in the cinderblock.<eos> You steal this much, and this ain't over.<eos> This ain't over.<eos> Thing about that Republican ass, it's not the flesh of his political fathers.
Walter!<eos> Walter!<eos> You're right.He's gone.<eos> Where's my dog?<eos> ! What did you do with it?
You've got some kind of angel watching over you.<eos> Thanks, doc.<eos> - You said a reaper was after me?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - How'd I ditch it?
It was stained with blood.<eos> Yeah,my blood.<eos> Which makes the carpet part of me.<eos> I want it back.<eos> I want to be buried with it.
"oh man, things aren't working right" or "things are going bad".<eos> And there were some things going on in my family... and I found a rock.<eos> And I said, "you know what, every time I touch this rock<eos> I'm gonna think of something that I'm grateful for".<eos> And so every morning, when I get up in the morning, I pick it up off the dresser and put it in my pocket, and I go through the things that I am grateful for.
Tracy Jordan is the third heat.<eos> I don't know where we're gonna find room in the budget for a guy like Tracy Jordan.<eos> I think I do.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Sometimes when I have these stress dreams, if I go to sleep in the dream, I come out of it.
There can't be many women who'd want to be with a guy like him.<eos> It's usually worst in the morning.<eos> Especially if I've slept on my arm.<eos> If I sleep on my back or with my arms out, I'm usually okay.<eos> So your arm only hurts after you lie on top of it all night.
- Of course I do.<eos> Really?<eos> And how do you deal with your wolf?<eos> Well, first of all, I accepted that it was there.<eos> I made friends with it.
No, they're not. It's just a tantrum, Ted.<eos> I saw this in kindergarten all the time.<eos> This isn't kindergarten.<eos> Mr. Druthers is an adult, and he wants his ball back.<eos> All right, I'll give it back if you show him your plans.
Is my wife there?<eos> - Yeah, she's here.<eos> - Well, let's go get her.<eos> In 15 seconds a black jeep is gonna pull up by the parking lot entrance.<eos> Run to it.
The thought never even occurred to me.<eos> Harry was all I needed.<eos> It was Harry who always had the answers.<eos> He knew who was good, bad, safe... And dangerous.<eos> I built my life on Harry's code. I lived by it.
I'm not gonna shout at you.<eos> - Are you crapping your pants?<eos> Are you mental or something?<eos> - Are you scared of the dog?<eos> No, I'm not scared of it.
I have something I have to tell you.<eos> Was the die cast from the very beginning?<eos> Or is it in our own hands to alter the course of destiny?<eos> Of all our abilities, it is free will that truly makes us unique.<eos> With it, we have a tiny, but potent, chance to deny fate.
Was the die cast from the very beginning?<eos> Or is it in our own hands to alter the course of destiny?<eos> Of all our abilities, it is free will that truly makes us unique.<eos> With it, we have a tiny, but potent, chance to deny fate.<eos> And only with it can we find our way back to being human.
But it's not here. It's just an illusion, Jasmine.<eos> Your friends are just playing a game with you.<eos> The real forest can never come back.<eos> Oh, it can.<eos> When they take me to it.
What else could I do?<eos> Come away, oh, human child!<eos> To the waters and the wild with a fairy hand in hand, for the world's more full of weeping than you can understand.<eos> 17 disappearances within the last five months.<eos> The rift is spreading and it's dumping aliens and psychos wherever it fancies.
These murders are happening because of Torchwood, so Torchwood has got to do something.<eos> It fell through the Rift about 40 years ago, lay at the bottom of the bay till we dredged it up.<eos> I always figured this wasn't just lost.<eos> Whoever made it, wanted rid of it.<eos> You know, we never gave it a cool name.
I think it's us, Owen. You and me.<eos> In a thousand years' time.<eos> This is what we become, when all we have left is our rage.<eos> Not exactly a comforting thought.<eos> Give it a smack.
Come here, buddy!<eos> Come on!<eos> You have a dog, too?<eos> It lives here in the woods.<eos> Somebody probably got tired of it and dumped it here to die.
- Arrest them.<eos> - Baissez-le! Baissez-le!<eos> Vite. Vite!<eos> You see? You German people, what you think of as heroes.<eos> New citizens of France, vanquish your darkest fears. Burn the forest. And with it... the Brothers Grimm.
That's so good, man.<eos> Enough.<eos> Man, I'm never gonna get out of this car again. I'm gonna live in it.<eos> I'm gonna eat in it.<eos> And I'm gonna make sweet love to it.
Enough.<eos> Man, I'm never gonna get out of this car again. I'm gonna live in it.<eos> I'm gonna eat in it.<eos> And I'm gonna make sweet love to it.<eos> You mean you gonna make sweet love in it.
Those present are myself, Father Richard Moore... ...Nathaniel, Emily's father Jason, her friend a doctor who is here to monitor Emily during the ritual and Emily herself who has given her permission for the ritual to be performed.<eos> All right, now listen.<eos> You may say the rosary or any private prayer for her deliverance when you're not responding to my words.<eos> Above all do whatever I ask, without question.<eos> Don't ask it any questions or pay any attention to what it says.
The criminal will need horses or cows to carry out the crime.<eos> We're turning this island upside down.<eos> Trying to catch a mad dog is never easy.<eos> Look !<eos> Now we must catch the culprit and prove to people it's not a ghost.
He needs all the help he can get.<eos> He understands that and he's seeking advice.<eos> Not from his cabinet, or the Congressional leadership.<eos> Give it time, Don.<eos> Give it time.
Tell me where Sam is.<eos> Oh, you love your father more than you think. Which means you'll miss him terribly.<eos> You see, I'm an expert in pain.<eos> It's my bread and butter, really.<eos> I feed off it.
I think it has something to do with why he had the affair.<eos> - Have you confronted him?<eos> - Once.<eos> You should have seen the look in his eyes.<eos> He was terrified I'd figure it out.
- You're kidding, right?<eos> - No!<eos> Look, I know a little something about loss.<eos> It can take you to some real dark places.<eos> Especially if you don't face it head-on.
Like 17 years in a six-by-ten prison cell.<eos> Dark.<eos> What's this for?<eos> The balloon represents the spirit of the life lost.<eos> By letting it go, you're acknowledging the pain you feel, and releasing it at the same time.
You have a suitcase full of rings!<eos> But that's the one that I sort of remembered her liking.<eos> Pick another ring!<eos> But my backup ring pulled through.<eos> Plus, now there's talk of her wanting to be buried with it.
- This may be asking too much, but could you keep it together until we get home and talk about it?<eos> - Fine.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> Carla, I like your hair that way.<eos> Laverne I bet you're tempted to break open that face cake and just tear it apart.
- I don't know.<eos> - You did it.<eos> - Well, Selmak deserves a little credit.<eos> OK.<eos> Most of it.
I promise.<eos> Should we clear a path in there?<eos> Oh, no.<eos> Not now.<eos> I hope nothing happens to it.
Play your tricks on me, but not my cousin.<eos> You have your swords. I have my tricks.<eos> We play with the toys the gods give us.<eos> We sail for Troy in three days.<eos> This war will never be forgotten. Nor will the heroes who fight in it.
Sonny's a whole new generation of robot.<eos> A robot not bound by those laws could do...<eos> Anything.<eos> All right, look, whatever's going on down at USR, that robot is the key.<eos> And I need you to get me inside to talk to it again.
I'm disappointed... Oh,<eos> Howl was my last apprentice...<eos> He used to be incredibly talented.<eos> I even thought about giving him my position soon.<eos> I was so pleased of it.
- Who's the stooge?<eos> - A chap by the name of Bill Ubell.<eos> And there's not a damn thing you can do about that, Steve.<eos> Three, you must swear, legally swear, that you'll not kill that shark, or whatever it is, if it actually exists.<eos> I'm going to fight it, but I'll let it live.
Hi!<eos> I picked a fruit.<eos> Hi...<eos> Because deep in the darkest forest in there, there is a special kind of tree.<eos> That has a very special fruit growing on it.
Good.<eos> - You can begin the incision.<eos> - I'm not ready for that.<eos> I say you're ready, you're ready.<eos> I'll mark out the line. And you cut along it.
See, conventional wisdom says I should constrict the vessels.<eos> I beg to differ.<eos> Let's break their rules. Use my rules.<eos> Body needs blood.<eos> Let's give it some.
Eat a lot of fruit, get some fucking vitamins in you.<eos> Vegetables and greens and shit.<eos> I can't...<eos> You know, there's... I was reading yesterday there's a fish, it's called a zebra fish.<eos> Has little hairs on it.
- Why me?<eos> And the addict will always need a little bit more... in order to get a rush or a high of what they're looking for chemically.<eos> Don't tell me to calm down!<eos> You're always bossing me around.<eos> So my definition really means that if you can't control your emotional state... you must be addicted to it.
My real mission is to give the Appleseed to the Seven Elders.<eos> So I took the job to protect you.<eos> If so, that pendant must be destroyed.<eos> General, don't you think it's strange?<eos> The Seven Elders wanted Appleseed before even needing it! It's because they want to use it to detonate the D-tank!
The action continues as the champ is battling Big Willie Jones and commanding him with rights and lefts.<eos> Boxing is an unnatural act. Because everything in it is backwards.<eos> You wanna move to the left you don't step left, you push on the right toe.<eos> To move right, you use your left toe.<eos> Instead of running from the pain, like a sane person would do you step into it.
-Hi...<eos> -Hi...<eos> -Where are you going?<eos> -To Vika to track an injured moose.<eos> Some bloody idiot put two bullets in it's arse.
That is possible.<eos> But only if you agree to my terms.<eos> - What are your terms?<eos> - I have a private jet at Van Nuys airport.<eos> I need to be on it, with a presidential guarantee of safe passage to North Africa.
I ordered the death of one of our agents.<eos> One of our finest.<eos> As unthinkable as that was, I had to buy some time in order to protect civilian lives.<eos> I will not cave in to any more of this terrorist's demands.<eos> We're vulnerable as long as Saunders has this virus and is willing to release it.
So maybe I was a virgin when it came to the sex thing...<eos> I'll se you.<eos> But he was a virgin too... first big death.<eos> And you never really know what death will make you do...<eos> How you try to defy it... To reach past what's possible.
Bandar, first of all, you have to experience the inconvenience of dying.<eos> I can do that.<eos> Don't you think this is a bit bloody morbid, though?<eos> It's like, I can promise you, death will find you.<eos> You don't have to invite it in.
After that it becomes illegal to remove, except in a couple states.<eos> Illegal?<eos> But don't worry.<eos> Many women learn to embrace this parasite.<eos> They name it, dress it up in tiny clothes, arrange playdates with other parasites.
I was wondering if your refrigerator is running.<eos> Oh, it is?<eos> Go.<eos> They said "yeah." C'mon.<eos> Well, then, you better catch it!
Murray?<eos> Before you say anything, I want you to know if you need a kidney, you can have mine.<eos> See?<eos> For $ 70,000.<eos> I love this moment so much, I want to have sex with it.
I'm a little more into the History Channel, myself.<eos> - Can I offer you anything?<eos> - No, I'm fine.<eos> How's the fern doing?<eos> I don't suppose you've tried talking to it.
Oh, damn lawyers.<eos> No offense to the present company or anything, you know.<eos> Now, is it my understanding that the Massey prenup has never been penetrated?<eos> That is correct.<eos> Not to blow my own horn, but they devote an entire semester to it at Harvard Law.
You call.<eos> Agents, we're on the move to the money drop.<eos> Forward.<eos> Hey, man, the truck's leaving.<eos> We're going to follow it.
Well, death...<eos> Death gives us the chance to sum up all the good we've done or left undone in life.<eos> Yeah.<eos> It is a painful world.<eos> And that's why, when someone like Jabez Stone comes along, someone who can look at that pain and describe it truthfully and simply, and give it a shape so that we can understand it, when someone like that comes along, a visionary,
I've got a deal for you.<eos> Well, spill it.<eos> I'm all ears.<eos> Cancel the contract with the king... and I'll give you my garden.<eos> You can do whatever you want with it.
That is where it is kept I bought it all from the wholesale shop<eos> The vendor there took me for a fool<eos> "l asked him for the price of carrots and he says "30 rupees for a kilo"<eos> "l asked him to give it at 20 rupees, or I was leaving"<eos> He gave it to me at once
Anyway, I wont be one of them. Never.<eos> Okay. Park Hyun-gyu.<eos> You say you listened at home to the end?<eos> But you couldn't have forgotten the last song.<eos> Because the DJ introduced it with some very striking words.
Let's turn that to our advantage.<eos> Ok, we mustn't use anything new.<eos> We'll use some old stuff but it mustn't look as if it's been recycled or repeated.<eos> We'll use it actively.<eos> We'll write a new text into it, a new context, and breathe freshness into it.
What is he doing?<eos> - Is that a dog? - I didn't know he had a dog.<eos> Why would he bring it to school if he did have a dog?<eos> - I have no idea.<eos> - Maybe he just found it.
When you're working in a band and you're performing something, it ...willy-nilly, it develops and changes...<eos> In pre-bootlegging days this of course was a far more effective and better way of doing things, because you went in the studio and rehearsed up.<eos> We'd been playing it live that way for quite some time as a sort of guitar jam, that sort of a piece.<eos> I think we were none of us that happy with it as a piece, and when we also had this synthesizer this Synth EA which had a little built-in keyboard and had a sequencer...<eos> it was the first sequencer I think I just plugged this up and started playing one sequence on it, and Roger immediately pricked up his ears and said that sounded good, and came up, and we started mocking with it together... and he put in a new sequence of notes, and all developed out of that...
It's time to vote.<eos> Mr Vice President, if you could indulge me for one minute.<eos> Mr President.<eos> This Bauer thing is an illusion, a mirage.<eos> Every time you get near it, it moves further away.
Just give it to me, OK?<eos> Stop it! Stop it, both of you!<eos> I can't reiterate this enough.<eos> This is a credible threat.<eos> Salazar's people will release this virus if we don't find it first.
This bit's good.<eos> Okay.<eos> I got the idea.<eos> This is not in the genre that I am interested in.<eos> But you ain't even giving' it a chance.
I damn near died!<eos> How melodramatic.<eos> Born for the stage, young Hawkins.<eos> This storm, it's what they call a black blizzard, no?<eos> That's the name they gave to it.
It's just a hunch.<eos> Travis' adrenal gland was abnormal.<eos> Maybe the parasite was feeding off his adrenaline, making him want more.<eos> Don't you think they would have found the parasite during the autopsy?<eos> Not if it burrowed out of that hole after he died.
I am no tree!<eos> I am an Ent.<eos> A tree-herder.<eos> A shepherd of the forest.<eos> Don't talk to it, Merry.
- don't make me...<eos> - don't do!<eos> Oh, that is so abnoxious!<eos> A single drop of her blood... contains all the genetic information we need .<eos> We simply put it into the Replicator, where it will combine with... a special hormon-growth solution that ,I have developed.
- No way.<eos> Hello.<eos> Grandma?<eos> Velma, it's simple behavior modification.<eos> To cause a dog to discontinue any action, simply flick it on the nose. Observe.
I was completely scattered.<eos> I do not remember how I got undressed.<eos> I was completely naked.<eos> We were near the edge of the pit.<eos> When we approached it and heard the gunshots... we understood everything.
There's evil and then there's the thing that created evil.<eos> - The source.<eos> - That's what this thing claims to be?<eos> That's what it is.<eos> It has eternities to act, endless resources.
Welcome home.<eos> This isn't my home anymore.<eos> So, what about this demon?<eos> Where is it?<eos> I'd like to thank it and then kill it.
- Doctor?<eos> - Look at the synaptic activity.<eos> This organism possesses a very sophisticated nervous system.<eos> It could be capable of higher mental functions.<eos> If it's intelligent, maybe we can communicate with it.
What kind of tests?<eos> I need to determine how much bioelectric stress it can tolerate.<eos> May I ask why?<eos> I'm trying to create a forcefield to isolate the cargo bay.<eos> But if it's going to work, I have to calculate how much of a jolt it will take to repel the organism without killing it or any of the people it's taken.
When he was growing up, he used to carry a ball with him at all times, no matter what.<eos> In school, on a date, didn't matter.<eos> He'd even go to bed with a basketball, like a marriage.<eos> So I started doing it.<eos> I quit sleeping with it when I got to college, but other than that...
We must get off the mountain!<eos> Make for the Gap of Rohan, and take the west road to my city!<eos> The Gap of Rohan takes us too close to Isengard!<eos> We cannot pass over a mountain.<eos> Let us go under it.
- Watch it, asshole.<eos> - All righty.<eos> Come on.<eos> I love this song.<eos> Give it a chance.
But remember this, Harry.<eos> This mirror gives us neither knowledge or truth.<eos> Men have wasted away in front of it. Even gone mad.<eos> That is why tomorrow it will be moved to a new home.<eos> And I must ask you not to go looking for it again.
Guests go in the amphitheatre.<eos> You can't be here.<eos> Do you know where I could find Michele Flaherty?<eos> Guests bring food. Food attracts animals.<eos> This one time... a bear came, and then the bear had to be destroyed... which means they shot it in the head with a rifle and killed it and it died.
"more likely to be teachers than men..."<eos> Besides today teachers are nearly all women.<eos> "So we must defend the state.<eos> "We're more likely to work for it and to benefit from it,<eos> "because we're the ones who need it..."
And then ten years go by, and they're all classics.<eos> By that time I knew that Kubrick was the one.<eos> Yes, all these extraordinary directors around the world were making films but there was something, after you saw 'Lolita' and 'Dr. Strangelove'...<eos> I knew that Kubrick-- We had to wait for a Kubrick film.<eos> We knew that when we went to see it that it was extremely special.
- Yes, you can.<eos> Take her up, straight and steady.<eos> Damn.<eos> You can't be afraid of the wind.<eos> Learn to trust it.
That Sturm und Drang about Angel running out on them, a performance.<eos> Who knew Angel had the acting chops?<eos> Are you kidding?<eos> It was one-note.<eos> Forced. - Funny, you bought it at the time.
Remove the head from our lady's presence.<eos> No, no, no, no!<eos> . I like the filthy head.<eos> That is.... I want to defile it more.<eos> I'll keep it to spit upon, and when I grow tired of that I will make it a planter.
Buffy's in trouble!<eos> It's OK, Dawnie.<eos> Willow and Tara are doin' a spell.<eos> - You sure it won't send Buffy back? - No, of course not.<eos> It's just that she can't fight it if it's all misty, so they'll make it more solid, so Buffy can kick its fully embodied ass.
Pretty little shiny Key.<eos> The Key?<eos> You've seen it?<eos> Pretty little shiny girl.<eos> The monks, they've made it human.
- The Key is almost as old as the Beast itself.<eos> Where it came from, how it was created:<eos> the deepest of mysteries.<eos> All that is certain is that its power is absolute.<eos> Countless generations of my people have sacrificed their lives in search of it, to destroy it before its wrath could be unleashed.
The seekers were at the courthouse waiting for him.<eos> And then they tracked Cole to the mausoleum.<eos> How do you know they didn't track you here?<eos> They retreated first.<eos> They have to be close to a shimmer to track it.
- One life to live.<eos> - I know life isn't fair, but this sucks.<eos> I know, he left a stain.<eos> But I think with a little water and...<eos> Death isn't brief, it's permanent, and this guy gets to cheat it not once but nine times.
- Can we use the transporter?<eos> - He's too deep.<eos> A section of this tunnel is collapsed.<eos> It's empty.<eos> If we could get into it, we could clear the obstruction with phase pistols. We'd be less than 20 metres from Lieutenant Reed.
-Couldn't care less.<eos> -Good scene, man.<eos> -You too.<eos> What?<eos> You weren't in it.
and you never told me you were in an "I Hate Rachel Club"?<eos> You went out with her?<eos> We had a pact.<eos> -It's not like it was binding forever.<eos> -It had the word "eternity" in it.
You're just not giving me much to go off of here.<eos> That's your fancy dress that I made for you.<eos> That I wore to a dance that I went to with him.<eos> The sweater's brand-new.<eos> - He saw me in it yesterday and liked it.
I know it sounds crazy, but I could feel it.<eos> - Did the cat feel it too?<eos> - The hairs on my neck stood up.<eos> My grandmother had a ghost.<eos> She had to tell it to leave.
My sister and her husband want me to walk with them down the aisle.<eos> God forbid I should walk it alone.<eos> That would be the real tragedy.<eos> Ignore the coffin.<eos> There's a single, 35-year-old woman walking behind it!
Sorry, Neelix.<eos> Charge weapons.<eos> Shields to full. What's going on?<eos> A funnel just opened. It pulled in a new vessel.<eos> Two warships are approaching it.
Well, General, whatever got into our computers apparently has built a nest.<eos> - Overnight?<eos> - According to the security log,... ..there hasn't been any human activity in the MALP room for 36 hours.<eos> For the record, sir, I want to blow it to hell.<eos> These folks want to chat with it.
Well, it wants to survive, so... we offer to send it home.<eos> This alien technology is capable of travelling back to us... ..through an outgoing wormhole.<eos> I won't risk the same thing happening again.<eos> I've already ordered that the coordinates be locked out of the dialling computer.<eos> Let me talk to it. Maybe we can...
(Daniel) ln and out.<eos> Obviously delirious.<eos> - How's Junior doing?<eos> - The symbiote is fine for now.<eos> But I don't know what we're gonna do with it if we let Teal'c die.
We're running short on time, Mr McCloy.<eos> We have got to conclude our business.<eos> Yes.<eos> Start the transfer.<eos> Follow it...and let me know.
Just swing the club.<eos> close your eyes.<eos> -close my--<eos> -You can't make that ball go in.<eos> You have to let it.
- Honey, I've got it.<eos> Hello?<eos> Is my sub-zero chillibrator running?<eos> - I suppose.<eos> - You better go catch it!
We've linked the two transmitters and calibrated the aiming device.<eos> All we need now is the firing pin.<eos> So when does the accelerator arrive?<eos> She's sending it up tomorrow with the next load of prisoners.<eos> She has no idea what we're planning to do with it.
Just thinking about it makes me hot.<eos> You're making a noise.<eos> That's my penis.<eos> It hums.<eos> Guess it doesn't know the words.
There's just fucking nothing about you that is controversial.<eos> God, it'll get ugly. They'll buy you drinks. You'll meet girls.<eos> It sounds great, but they aren't friends.<eos> They want snobbish stories about the rock stars' genius.<eos> They will ruin rock and strangle everything we love about it.
It was a good show.<eos> I miss him already.<eos> You're coming along at a very dangerous time for rock'n'roll.<eos> The war is over. They won.<eos> They will ruin rock'n'roll and strangle everything we love about it.
— I'll make it up to you. — I ain't happy.<eos> I'll make it up to you, I promise. Stand on me.<eos> Oh, that fucking pikey's put me in it.<eos> Thanks for the tip, Brick Top.<eos> Listen, you fucking fringe, if I throw a dog a bone I don't want to know if it tastes good.
Yes, there is.<eos> When I was a little boy... I found this bird.<eos> He was injured and... had a broken leg or something.<eos> Well, my father found out that I had it.<eos> And I knew that he would do something horrible to it.
Bobo!<eos> Did you notice anything unusual about that monkey?<eos> What do you mean?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Just something about it.
I don't think I ever remember seeing you that mad.<eos> There's something about it that's, uh... (SIGHS) It sounds stupid, but I just almost feel like it's...<eos> I don't know, like it's evil.<eos> Ron, it's just a monkey.<eos> I just don't like it playing with Jennifer, that's all. I don't think it's safe.
No, she's not available.<eos> She's holding a bird in her hands.<eos> A bird.<eos> She found it in the road.<eos> Because it...it wasn't well.
That in no way was it bad thoughts or sin, and that I had to let my bloody, degenerate imagination go wherever it wanted.<eos> I killed those women, I'm a criminal.<eos> Thought commits no crimes, my friend.<eos> For me... for my cinema work and everything else... That film's left me with the best memories.<eos> I'm very fond of it.
He wrote me a beautiful letter saying that his last few years had appeared quickly and terribly, and all he had left was to wait for death.<eos> He said it very lucidly.<eos> Elena Poniatowska Writer and friend At the end, the one who he talked to most... and he lived in a Franciscan cell with a cot for a bed... was Father Julian.<eos> He wasn't afraid of death.<eos> He was obsessed with it, but not afraid.
We used to imagine that all around was an enormous rose garden.<eos> And there was a magic ring hidden in it.<eos> And if you found it, you grew up immediately.<eos> The ring was from a can.<eos> One day Ana put her hand in some bushes to look for it, and she got pricked.
You over there, you've had dicks, haven't you?<eos> You must've had a dick once.<eos> shall I tell you about my dick?<eos> There was a time when my dick was a part of me, that I was proud of.<eos> I'd stand and look at it and talk to it.
No more evil pregnancies.<eos> Good, we can end this without harming the women.<eos> - There's just one tiny problem.<eos> - What's that?<eos> I don't wish to use the words "impossible to kill" but fire won't kill it, decapitation won't and it's really huge.
Pretend you're not a Cub Scout and tell me about this.<eos> Well, detective, we had to scrape him off the wall. Guys got pinned by a two-ton dumpster.<eos> - It fell on them?<eos> - No, they were pinned to the wall.<eos> Looks like somebody shoved it from the side.
Er, the glass is soundproofed.<eos> The glass is soundproofed.<eos> The thicker glass...<eos> You know what you are?<eos> A beard with an idiot hanging off it.
Pain, death... ..apocalypse.<eos> None of it fun.<eos> Do you know what a hellmouth is?<eos> Do you have a fancy term for it?<eos> Because I went to high school on it for three years.
- What?<eos> I think the spell is working.<eos> Do you see it?<eos> What's it doing?<eos> I think it wants us to follow it.
Katie showed me things that are beyond our comprehension.<eos> They have machines that I can't begin to describe, but not once have they used them against us.<eos> Quite the opposite, in fact.<eos> Milo, you said you didn't like the rain.<eos> And young Harry Kim made it go away.
- Kal'ma?<eos> - It means "child".<eos> The demon you carry within you is no child.<eos> Do I not carry it within me as I would my own?<eos> Have I not taught it right from wrong as any mother would?
I'll have to stay.<eos> Oh, I'll die eventually.<eos> I have no illusions of immortality.<eos> But I will have wished for death long before death finds me.<eos> In truth, I wish for it already.
Honey, baby bear will be right there.<eos> Everything's okay.<eos> That's the problem.<eos> - My buddy's thumb got cut off.<eos> Should I screw it on again?
I can't bring it to your house, your mother despises me, so listen...<eos> Finished.<eos> - This doesn't taste like ice tea.<eos> - How's the letter?<eos> - Do you think he'll like it?
The guy is good, as good as anybody I've ever worked with.<eos> You know why he was run out of New York?<eos> I heard some things.<eos> He busted the mayor. The mayor of fucking New York City!<eos> He found a secret memo on a bribe between His Honor and an ex-borough president and ran with it.
It is necessary for us to proceed with the highest caution.<eos> Do you question my judgment?<eos> Gon!<eos> I am delighted by this man.<eos> What do you think of it?
Come to Daddy...<eos> It's heavy!<eos> It tore the net. It's a monster!<eos> And now what?<eos> - We put it back.
All flesh eats this beast.<eos> But why is the dragon at the castle of the king?<eos> It is said, between the king and the monster there is an agreement.<eos> The dragon always and everywhere protected the king.<eos> But it is served at the castle, as if he were a king.
-Someone might take it.<eos> Go through the garden gate and leave it at the door-step.<eos> -Go on then. lf a dog comes just sit down where you are.<eos> Don't bang the basket against your leg.<eos> When a dog comes along sit down... and give it tomatoes, then it won't bite.
- Don't I get any say in this?<eos> - No.<eos> Veruca was right about something.<eos> The wolf is inside me all the time.<eos> And I don't know where that line is any more, between me and it.
String up the lights and light up the tree<eos> We're gonna make some revelry Spirits are high, so I can tell It's Christmas time in Hell<eos> Demons are nicer as you pass them by There's a lot of demon toys to buy The snow is falling and all is well It's Christmas time in Hell!<eos> There goes Jeffrey Dahmer With a festive Christmas ham<eos> After he has sex with it He'll eat up all he can
It's not a demon.<eos> My friends speak the truth, Simon.<eos> This demon is nothing more than a parasite that inhabits another creature.<eos> Your fear is its greatest power over you.<eos> - You do not fear it?
Because you know if I did return that I would break your damn neck.<eos> But of course you could just touch that lovely ring,... ..and we'd all be struck down again.<eos> Ah, the ring.<eos> This has been handed down... ..through generations of village canons who came before me.<eos> And with it you maintain power.
But of course you could just touch that lovely ring,... ..and we'd all be struck down again.<eos> Ah, the ring.<eos> This has been handed down... ..through generations of village canons who came before me.<eos> And with it you maintain power.<eos> With it I abide by God's will...
My god... is with me always.<eos> (canon yells)<eos> He's all right.<eos> What happened?<eos> Simon... stood before it, like...
Your mate Amaunet is dead.<eos> Sorry to ruin your day.<eos> No, actually, I'm wrong about that. I'm not sorry.<eos> Sokar sent word to me of Amaunet's death.<eos> I did not believe it.
This ain't cheap.<eos> I'm paying that kid ten bucks an hour to shag balls.<eos> It's not a bad piece of ash, huh?<eos> The bat. I'm talking about the bat.<eos> Don't strangle it. You wanna shake hands with it. Hello, Mr Bat.
- Ugly concubines.<eos> Now, that's what I call Mongolian barbecue.<eos> I tire of your arrogance, old man.<eos> Bow to me.<eos> No matter how the wind howls... the mountain cannot bow to it.
Yeah. Well, it's not the worst idea ever, Captain.<eos> It's just that everything depends on getting the tank down this main road for us to knock out, right?<eos> So how the hell do you plan on doing that?<eos> As our esteemed colleague from the Airborne pointed out, what we got here are a bunch of spit wads, so how do we stop the tank if we get it to commit?<eos> Give it a rabbit to chase.
Some men washem before they piss.<eos> Some wash after.<eos> I wash before.<eos> My cock is sacred.<eos> It should be worshipped.
I don't know.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> You like the material?<eos> is it light enough?<eos> He wears it well.
Becker, you should have passed the ball to Ramzey.<eos> When I am in a key situation, I ask myself:<eos> "What would King Tut over there do?" He would not have passed it to me.<eos> Listen, you slapdick...<eos> He is right. I would not have passed it.
- The werewolf, it's in there!<eos> - Comin' through!<eos> - You let it get away. - I didn't let it do anything.<eos> - I had the chain around its neck.<eos> - Chain? ! - Were you gonna take it for a walk?
Think about it.<eos> It's a taxi that people take when they need to relax.<eos> It's a Relaxi-Taxi!<eos> The name was my favorite part!<eos> -I came up with it.
The bath's getting cold.<eos> I'll see you later.<eos> There's some kids playing in the street.<eos> Want to go give them a project, ruin their day?<eos> If they have a ball, you could stick razors in it and teach them a new game:
Oh, my God!<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Look at these pelts!<eos> Don't get too attached.<eos> She's having it cremated.
Now Sister Peter Marie says that you haven't been to drug counselling lately.<eos> I'm gonna let that slide too.<eos> You know why?<eos> Because you give this place a good name.<eos> You do anything to give it a bad name from here on out, you don't get a second chance.
What?<eos> Fuckers.<eos> Motherfuckers.<eos> Hannah Bantry in the pantry Gnawing on a mutton bone<eos> How she gnawed it How she clawed it When she found herself alone
I don't know if you believe what you're saying, or if you're faking it, or if you're just insane.<eos> I have been touched by the hand of a god.<eos> I'm a changed man.<eos> I admit, when I first allowed myself to become a vessel for the "Pah-wraith," it was purely out of self-serving reasons.<eos> I wanted to help it enter the wormhole so it could force the Prophets out.
Why?<eos> Faith, Nerys. Faith.<eos> I'm sorry about Vedek Fala.<eos> I keep going over what he said when he died.<eos> I don't know if he meant he never lost his faith or he felt betrayed by it.
- Outside corner?<eos> !<eos> We have two men on!<eos> Gentlemen, you are trying my patience.<eos> You stole the run from us just as if you'd reached up and tore it off the scoreboard!
Are you asking for my opinion?<eos> I suppose I am... because frankly, I'm running out of options.<eos> Throwing you in the brig isn't going to solve anything. Neither is slapping you on the wrist.<eos> And it's not as though I don't understand your feelings about Kovin.<eos> There have been a few times when I'd have liked to pop him in the nose myself, but you have to start learning the difference between having an impulse and acting on it.
Oh,... many, many years.<eos> Then why do you lie to your people?<eos> Why not give them the option to come out here?<eos> Because it was our kind that damaged the planet in the first place.<eos> If I let them out, they will only hurt it again.
- What are you doin' here?<eos> - I need to talk to you.<eos> Something's happened.<eos> (Joanne) Morris, don't forget your stupid chair!<eos> You and it should be very happy together!
They say he was able to destroy the entire city alone!<eos> First July, and now August !<eos> What the hell is this manic thinking?<eos> The reward on it will only get bigger!<eos> I'm believing that it was the fault of having fallen on this planet Along with all other things I heard about it.
Even hunters among us.<eos> Everyone, including me, was afraid.<eos> I was lying down with my family when out of nowhere it appeared.<eos> As it came for me,<eos> I picked up this big rock and I threw it.
- I couldn't allow another day to go by... without just getting it out there, regardless of the outcome, which, by the look on your face, is to be the inevitable... shoot down.<eos> And, you know, I'll accept that.<eos> But I know- - I know that some part of you is hesitating for a moment.<eos> And if there's a moment of hesitation, then that means you feel something too.<eos> And all I ask, please, is that you just-- you just not dismiss that and try to dwell in it for just ten seconds.
You're still alive?<eos> That's good.<eos> I'll return the head.<eos> Leave it and go.<eos> Give it back now? It's too late.
Just knowing that it's close.<eos> I see what you mean.<eos> Now, close your eyes.<eos> Just think about tasting it.<eos> Now, smell it.
The scanner read the book.<eos> It brought Moloch out as information to be absorbed.<eos> He's gone binary on us.<eos> OK, for those of us in our studio audience who are me, you guys are saying Moloch is in this computer?<eos> And in every computer connected to it by a modem.
What is the word for an adult... who doesn't have dinosaur toys in their bedroom?<eos> What was that?<eos> Monica knows.<eos> It's this dumb thing that Ross made up to try to fool our parents.<eos> It's a way of giving the finger without actually having to give it.
- Let me ask you a question.<eos> Let's say a guy bends over backwards to give a guy a '53 Studebaker Commander.<eos> - Oh, I love that car.<eos> - Good design. It is.<eos> And that same guy offered to restore it for the first guy.
It's not.<eos> It's the job.<eos> Danny... uh, wanted to say that he has connections... at this hospital, and it's a... It's a state-of-the-art kind of place, so...<eos> "Connections"?<eos> He owns it.
I'm just saying you can't compare Calvin to anthrax.<eos> Stop... Stop calling it fucking "Calvin."<eos> We don't know what that thing is.<eos> Yeah?<eos> And you're in there, and you're playing around with it like it's your buddy.
- For two hours?<eos> You'll be the one that benefits when I have abs.<eos> Y-You left your phone.<eos> It kept ringing.<eos> I saw it was Bonnie, so I answered it.
I'm so sorry, Jemma.<eos> Coulson's reading the book.<eos> He's firing up the gateway right now.<eos> Come on. Please.<eos> Let me take you to it.
Let her be now, Koen.<eos> Is it alive?<eos> Very much so.<eos> Let's find out what else Cleverman blood can do.<eos> What we can do to it.
Yeah, or your penis.<eos> - Yes.<eos> - I'm attached to it, I mean.<eos> That's what I mean.<eos> One would hope so, yeah. You wouldn't want to see somebody else having fun with it.
So you came to get coffee?<eos> - This is my shoe.<eos> - Almost got it!<eos> I tried to get a coffee over on Rose, but the thing took off.<eos> So now I feel like I've done half a triathlon just running after it, man.
Well...<eos> Think it's over?<eos> That's the last we'll hear from Dreyfuss?<eos> I'd like to believe it... but evil has a manner of raising its head in a way we least expect.<eos> But if it should... we shall face it together.
All of you.<eos> I'm going up there to find my friend.<eos> If you come with me, I can't promise that you won't all die. But I can promise you this.<eos> You won't all die in a hole in the ground.<eos> We have to drive it back through and close the portal behind it.
What is the Fall Fun Fair without Team Hendrix?<eos> I can't stop thinking about M.K. and Cosima out there all alone.<eos> Why do I love my sisters so much when they're ruined my life.<eos> Hey, your life isn't ruined.<eos> It's just waiting for you to come back and sparkle it up.
I'd long since forgotten about it... but hearing him speak of it reminded me.<eos> I know I've heard that phrase before, a long time ago.<eos> But where?<eos> Right below this village.<eos> A place inside the perimeter, but we've been told for generations not to go near it.
But where?<eos> Right below this village.<eos> A place inside the perimeter, but we've been told for generations not to go near it.<eos> You don't mean... the Rotting Shrine?<eos> My Gran always told me never to go near it because there's a ghost there scarier than the Safeguard.
Like, when tragedy used to strike.<eos> I remember I was 12 years old, and the teacher wheeled a television set into the classroom.<eos> You remember these days?<eos> And she turned it on to one of three channels.<eos> And she said, "Class, the space shuttle is taking off, and we're all gonna watch it take off."
Mother, Father.<eos> Mother, Father.<eos> Mother, Father.<eos> And baby?<eos> We see a tuna baby, we must go to it.
Fernando was down here when something crawled out of a wall vent, and...<eos> I heard him screaming, so I went to check, and that's when the "thing" was tossing Fernando all around the room.<eos> I thought it was gonna kill him.<eos> I shrieked when I saw it. I...<eos> I guess I scared it, because I'm told that I have a very disturbing scream.
I'm sorry.<eos> It's okay.<eos> So, I need a new name for my bike.<eos> Any suggestions?<eos> Well, you want to name it something child-friendly.
You're leaving.<eos> The sword cannot be kept here.<eos> Where are you taking it?<eos> I would not burden you with that knowledge.<eos> Too many will hunt it.
Come on, man.<eos> That old hackers-being-nerds cliché, that's pretty dated now.<eos> I do a'ight.<eos> Okay, the encoded cell phone is nearly done.<eos> And all I gots to do is slap a little Bone Machine on it.
How do you mean?<eos> Like, asking it questions.<eos> Saying knock twice for "yes" and one for "no."<eos> That sort of thing.<eos> I wonder what would happen if we tried talking to it now?
Thanks, Sam.<eos> Don't thank me.<eos> I'm not thanking that thing.<eos> His name is Redwing.<eos> I'm still not thanking it.
"But, seeing too much to deny and too little to be sure," "I am in a state to be pitied."<eos> "I have 100 times wished that if a God maintains nature," "it should testify to Him unequivocally."<eos> "If the signs Nature gives are deceptive, "He should suppress them fully. "Nature should say everything or nothing<eos> "so I see which cause to follow. "But in my present state, "ignorant of what I am or of what I must do,<eos> "I know neither my condition nor my duty. "My heart inclines to know where is the true good "in order to follow it.
Now I feel like a drink.<eos> But your health?<eos> To hell with that.<eos> I want you to have it all, my son.<eos> This house and all that's in it.
Let's face it, Howard. She's the future.<eos> Two old guys like us, we're the past.<eos> Well, that's a sad thought.<eos> Sad but true.<eos> Banking law... needs to be exciting. It needs the next generation to come along and give it a big, old kick in the seat of the pants.
Jennifer, you don't have to do this.<eos> You don't need anyone to stop you.<eos> You have a choice.<eos> This isn't fate.<eos> Spoken from a man who is somehow able to defy it.
Well, that sounds like a good investigative plan.<eos> The first thing we need to do, though... check out of this motel.<eos> Once upon a time, there was a village that was being tormented by a man-eating lizard-dragon.<eos> The local constable did everything to try to kill this creature, but nothing could stop it.<eos> So, finally, he visits a gypsy, who tells him the only way to kill this monster is to stab it in its appendix with a lance made of green glass.
TULIP: (SINGING) Baby, what are we gonna call you, baby?<eos> (CHUCKLES) This is crazy.<eos> We are delivering a baby!<eos> No, we are delivering a package.<eos> Maybe we should name it instead of calling it "the package."
They are super dumb.<eos> Babies have a higher level of intelligence than we will ever understand.<eos> You sound like a baby that learned how to talk.<eos> I am a baby that learned how to talk!<eos> Hey, I want to teach it to walk around in circles
- A voice.<eos> - Whose voice?<eos> - Arnold.<eos> He told me it was a killer, but it wasn't its fault.<eos> It was made that way, ... and I could help it.
The world's at a tipping point where only the fit will survive and I'm ensuring there'll be at least some of us left.<eos> You and I, we're the custodians of the future.<eos> We could change this world together.<eos> You could finish what Jimmy couldn't.<eos> Your people have 50,000 years of research locked up in stories, knowledge of the land, how to live with it, not try to tame it.
You know, most people who die in the bush... they're found naked.<eos> Yeah, they panic, and they think their clothes are slowing them down.<eos> They throw them away, and then the cold gets to them.<eos> But the trick is...<eos> this is the knack... you stay calm, you look for water, you follow it to high ground until you can see what's going on.
We need to cut it open.<eos> We don't know what's inside this thing.<eos> Yeah, exactly.<eos> What if the suit isn't protecting it from us?<eos> What if it's protecting us from it?
But the baroness could not carry a child to term.<eos> They say her body rejected the fetuses because they were deformed.<eos> Now, you must excuse me.<eos> I have to put this animal out of its misery.<eos> What's wrong with it?
Yes.<eos> All right, where am I headed?<eos> You're exiting the tracheal artery.<eos> You should see the first fragment.<eos> No sign of it.
Like you remember a dream, mostly.<eos> Now, shut your eyes and listen to the gramophone.<eos> Do you hear the stylus cutting into the wax?<eos> Yes. Concentrate on that sound and nothing else.<eos> Listen to it.
Oh, it's, uh... family heirloom.<eos> Passed down through generations.<eos> Well, it's unlike anything I've seen.<eos> A form of bronze, though it dates back before the Bronze Age.<eos> It's warm to the touch, almost as if it has its own power.
- Gonna climb up onto your boat.<eos> - [BoJack] What?<eos> - [Heather] What happened?<eos> - Sorry, I just... Give me a minute.<eos> [Heather] You want me to touch it, blow on it, sing it happy birthday?
When you're aiming, Casey, always keep both eyes open.<eos> Cover your target with the barrel then move with it to get its pace.<eos> I'm warning you, it's gonna be frustrating the first times.<eos> You're gonna shoot under it or behind it.<eos> You'll learn to stay with it.
She says it was a godsend.<eos> He was not who killed the unfaithful, but God .<eos> Lying.<eos> Brandon, beware.<eos> His talent God gave it.
I-I was lucky to be able to task the rangers to accompany Dr. Vickers.<eos> Have you located him?<eos> The Phase Two animal he was chasing killed him and the rangers, too.<eos> Were you able to secure the animal?<eos> No, there was no sign of it by the time we arrived.
Why is she wearing that mask?<eos> Okay, guys.<eos> This is the, uh... package that we need to deliver to Jesús...<eos> Along with his money that you owe him. That we owe him.<eos> What's in it?
In my lab in West Berlin.<eos> The sample is there, unfinished but safe.<eos> If we could destroy it...<eos> We could keep the Messengers from ever existing in the first place, stop the paradoxes, all of it.<eos> If you spare me, I will take you to it.
- I have nothing of beauty to say.<eos> Then say what you must, deposit your ugliness and go.<eos> I have more important things to do.<eos> Very well.<eos> At some point, every leader must ask himself whether by staying in office, he is giving to the country, or taking from it.
Your network cable is gonna be plugged into one of these suckers.<eos> That's a battery-powered home-brewed mobile tower called a femtocell.<eos> Now, this guy won't help us get on the FBI network.<eos> That won't be accessible at E Corp.<eos> What this guy will do is force every FBI cell phone to connect to it so it can get every email, text message, and document.
You were right.<eos> The animal who wants to watch the world burn... that is who you are.<eos> Your point?<eos> Don't deny the animal.<eos> But don't let it control you either.
But Alchemy can't get Wally if he stays in the cell.<eos> Barry, we can't just let Wally suffer in there.<eos> And besides, burying our head in the sand is not gonna make Alchemy go away.<eos> Ignoring the problem does not get rid of it.<eos> You're gonna have to face it.
She's in here.<eos> So I go in, and there's not just the wound from the glass.<eos> There's a hole. Dug in.<eos> A bore hole, like a tiny tunnel.<eos> So I follow it, you know, how deep does it go?
But it's actually no more difficult for us to sell to the United States or to Australia or even China, than it is to sell to the EU.<eos> The idea that you have to be in the European Union to trade with the European Union is a total absurdity.<eos> Wander into any shop in Britain and you'll find goods from all over the world - cameras and TVs from Japan, computers and phones from America.<eos> But we have no trade deals with these countries.<eos> You don't need a trade deal with a country to be able to trade with it.
Look at this.<eos> All these blood trays are filled.<eos> Except for this one.<eos> Jackson's mutating into an apex predator, not a vampire.<eos> Besides, how could you possibly know if Jackson took that vial and it wasn't some doctor that removed it earlier?
Yes, Majesty.<eos> I am a warrior in His Majesty's horde.<eos> Somewhere there, this heart beats.<eos> And Rannus did one thing right.<eos> His anchor is going to lead us right to it.
Is that a line?<eos> Is that what?<eos> April...<eos> The heart itself must slip through a tear in space and time in order to beat.<eos> It's only a matter of tracking it properly.
Addy.<eos> Addidale, if I may use your full name.<eos> That's not my name. Addidale.<eos> Fate has reunited us.<eos> And for that I thank it.
We're going our own way now. Where are you going?<eos> To start a new world.<eos> Come on!<eos> Move it!<eos> One other car in North America, and I'm stuck behind it.
What the hell is going on?<eos> SARAH:<eos> Sorry, we were a little busy with the whole life-and-death combat thing.<eos> And then you attacked Pops.<eos> You named it?
Only he knows the way.<eos> Lay the rag over his eyes.<eos> I can't.<eos> Wait! How do we get back--<eos> Lay it over his eyes!
Except choi, but, you know, I guess we'll just have to start without him.<eos> Um, first of all, welcome to our little reunion of sorts.<eos> You guys are all very special to Eden, which--which means you're very special to me, and we really missed you, and we love you.<eos> You know, each and every one of us is on a journey, and we feel that it's important to be on that journey with the people you love, and it's something we really, really have good here.<eos> We want to open up the house again, give it and us a new start, so...
Two of you are quite a pair.<eos> You quit school, he gets fired from one.<eos> Dumb kid, same as you.<eos> How some punk cheating on his test reported him.<eos> Kid got some weed, put it in his car and called the cops.
They are, in essence, the worst of what humanity used to be.<eos> Rebellious, defiant and uncontrollable.<eos> Five days ago, a rogue group of Divergents, posing as Dauntless brutally invaded Abnegation.<eos> An obvious attempt to cripple the Faction System by attacking it's most vulnerable members.<eos> These Divergents despise our system because they are incapable of conforming to it.
You know it's for the best.<eos> Don't fight it.<eos> Just accept it.<eos> You see what happens when you try to fight it?<eos> Every 30 years or so the goddamn place just wakes up and it demands new blood, and our town is forced to deliver it.
Now multiply that by 10.<eos> This is the life, isn't it, Jay?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Totally, Chet.<eos> You know, you have to take what life offers, look it in the eye, and embrace it.
The crew of the Eagle was recruiting by the beach.<eos> Anne Bonny showed up looking to join.<eos> Quartermaster tells her if Jack Rackham's got no appetite for her on his crew, they for fucking certain don't either.<eos> What did she do?<eos> She grabbed a marling spike and plunged it in his jaw.
Made a place for me.<eos> Taught me things.<eos> Without him, I wouldn't have fucking made it.<eos> When someone gives you a life, it ain't truly your own.<eos> You owe some part of it back.
It's not gonna work like that.<eos> Let's you and me go talk to the weatherman.<eos> Wait. Me?<eos> What?<eos> And that high pressure system is gonna move right through here and with it comes the cuddle-up weather, folks.
- Good day.<eos> - Good day, Paisa.<eos> - Thank you!<eos> Good day, Sergeant.<eos> Escobar's prison was called La Catedral, but we nicknamed it "Club Medellín."
I'm not gonna fuck this up, okay?<eos> I've made up my mind.<eos> I don't want to die again, all right?<eos> There is no white light for me.<eos> If we don't get this stuff out of here, it's gonna find its way back to me, or me to it, you know?
My man and I had an ailing child, born healthy, but it turned puny and weak.<eos> We knew it was a fairy changeling.<eos> We placed it in the fairy's seat in the hill and kept watch through the nicht, sirs, so as to recover our beloved bairn after the wee folk returned it.<eos> But... but just before morning, we saw her.<eos> She took the child in her vile embrace... and... and spoke strange spells over it.
There will be no warrant and there will be no warrant forthcoming.<eos> I appreciate wanting to kill Hannibal Lecter and I'm not without benefit from that.<eos> He can't make good on his promise to murder you if he's dead, now can he?<eos> But he's not dead.<eos> Play with your food, Mason, and you give it the opportunity to bite back.
He's been among us for quite some time.<eos> You've never heard his name.<eos> You've never seen his face.<eos> He's stayed in the shadows.<eos> Because men like him, men that want to control our city, our lives, fear the light and what it reveals.
She's pragmatic.<eos> Where's my child now?<eos> Cold storage, Hammond Labs.<eos> Does Jessica have plans for it?<eos> She doesn't know it exists.
Oh, my God.<eos> What have I done?<eos> You did exactly what you had to do.<eos> That thing was gonna ruin both our lives.<eos> We cannot compete with it.
I'm going as fast as I can.<eos> So much for being a step ahead of Holbrook.<eos> Why would he leave the barrel?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Maybe he thought it was too heavy to carry it himself.
My children, my whole poisoned issue. A lot of them out there right now.<eos> Killers, fighters, thieves.<eos> Some more peaceful than others.<eos> But they still carry it... the disease.<eos> If the mark wants blood, I'll give it mine.
Spivak recorded his plans in great detail using microdot technology, a quaint encryption trick of the mid-20th century.<eos> They just made everything really tiny and hoped nobody would find it.<eos> It's all there in its original German.<eos> From its repeated references to "Die Welt wird frei von Upirs sein."<eos> "The pathogen doesn't affect human beings exposed to it."
That we don't have children of our own.<eos> We're step-parents.<eos> Although we'd handle it poorly if something ever happened to them.<eos> But imagine losing your own child.<eos> The thousands of hours - you've held its hand, carried it, laughed and cried with it ... And then it dies.
My job, my friends.<eos> Yeah, I had all that too.<eos> And now I don't even have a job here anymore.<eos> And do you think our baby would like to eat, for example?<eos> Cos I'd like to be able to buy it food.
I was so stupid.<eos> Yes, of course.<eos> What about you and Dominique?<eos> "Dominique..."<eos> He wants life to be more beautiful than what it is.
Something I love, the spell calls for me to kill it.<eos> A sacrifice.<eos> Precisely.<eos> The book will grant freedom from the curse, but it wants something in return.<eos> Well, then give it.
Wait, wait. Stop.<eos> I know where the egg is.<eos> I stole it.<eos> It's here on Bird Island.<eos> Take me to it.
Well, the good news is... (grunts) with the shift in the car, I'm no longer impaled.<eos> The bad news is there's a-a great degree<eos> Of bright red blood just Spewing out... My wound.<eos> That sounds like an arterial bleeder.<eos> That shard of guardrail must have been in the spleen. The blood coagulated around it;
Okay, that would be crucial to understanding this particular mutation.<eos> How about you guys go and find your rat queen and I go and find Chloe?<eos> Jamie, do you really want to be in this place alone?<eos> How about we stick together and find them both, huh?<eos> That horse... w-what was wrong with it?
Well, I've investigated a lot of these wormhole rumors, but that's all they were - rumors.<eos> None have panned out.<eos> So we know nothing of its origin.<eos> Kree maybe.<eos> And this parchment was found with it.
We must find a way to defeat it. A weakness we can exploit so we can escape unscathed.<eos> That's it... it wants secrets.<eos> Yours, mine, Betsy Ross'.<eos> If Betsy knew the same secrets as the spies that were killed, why was she spared?<eos> I did not see the creature that day. I had no idea it was responsible.
No, we can't.<eos> We got to find a safe place for her and your baby.<eos> Anything happens to you, that kid is Plan B.<eos> Plan B?<eos> What exactly are you planning on doing with it?
- Your stupid ship did it!<eos> - Don't blame my ship!<eos> - It melted a child!<eos> - My ship doesn't do anything...<eos> - It killed it itself! - ...unless it's told to do something!
According to you, this concerns the whole world.<eos> Well, what would you do if you believed everything I just told you?<eos> I would locate this...<eos> Omega.<eos> Bomb it out of existence.
Your biggest mistake, and you just happen to run him over?<eos> I could convict you over coffee.<eos> But no, no, routines are important.<eos> Close the door. Go.<eos> If the blood matches, and I have no reason to doubt it does then I must have clipped him.
Welcome.<eos> Glad you're here.<eos> I think the real problem is how we get past the machine's defenses.<eos> Why don't we take out the solar field?<eos> Deprive it of its power and possibly slow it down. I don't know.
He can't die because of what we've done.<eos> I can see everything.<eos> Look at the sky.<eos> The clouds.<eos> We're healing the ecosystem, not harming it.
Louise was right. I can't keep track of them.<eos> There was a sheep in the whorehouse last week.<eos> - Really?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Wandered in there, and then when I went to pick it up, somehow, it had made $20.
"Yours, with great admiration, Hazel Grace Lancaster."<eos> Not bad.<eos> You think?<eos> Yeah, I mean, it's a bit pretentious... but then again, Van Houten uses words like "tendentious" and "Bacchanalia," so...<eos> I think he'll like it.
There's no smoking on this plane.<eos> Or any plane.<eos> I don't smoke.<eos> Yeah, it's just a metaphor.<eos> He puts the killing thing in his mouth... but he doesn't actually give it the power to kill him.
He captured us and took us to Harrenhal.<eos> He killed Lommy.<eos> What the fuck's a Lommy?<eos> He was my friend.<eos> Polliver stole my sword and put it right through his neck.
Boss he got away from us!<eos> Got away?<eos> Who wanted to catch him?<eos> You just had to pay him and take the diamond!<eos> That's it. Shoaib tried to take it with force, but...
I admire loyalty more than any other virtue.<eos> Please kneel.<eos> Get on your knees before he changes his mind.<eos> I hereby commission you into my regiment of Musketeers.<eos> May you serve it always with the same distinction that I witnessed today.
I never heard.<eos> Well, garage...<eos> The name comes from a club of the 80s called Paradise Garage.<eos> The owner was Larry Levan.<eos> Did you hear about it?
It was a classified project, and I didn't have clearance.<eos> Why did he stop working for you?<eos> The project went bad.<eos> And I had to keep my company clean of it.<eos> Jonas was connected to it so I severed that relationship.
How did you know where to get this?<eos> Don't be angry, but I followed you one night.<eos> You got it from Ping Wu?<eos> I'm sure he took quite a liking to you.<eos> As long as you didn't have to put your golden lotus in his mouth to pay for it.
Angus.<eos> Angus burger.<eos> Please, tell me you're spelling "Angus burger" right now.<eos> I remember this one time I had an Angus patty, it was so juicy, I didn't just eat that thing,<eos> I literally performed cunnilangus on it.
Not the family she'll never have, but the one she's always had.<eos> Here I am, telling her something that could destroy her faith in humanity.<eos> And somehow, she manages to repair a little piece of mine.<eos> The world is full of evil and lies and pain and death, and you can't hide from it.<eos> You can only face it.
After all, you were the one who convinced your siblings to consecrate her in New Orleans soil.<eos> Esther.<eos> So not even death can stop my mother from seeking the annihilation of her own flesh and blood.<eos> This isn't the end.<eos> As long as that child lives, the witches of New Orleans will never stop coming for it.
You infected him.<eos> This is fresh squeezed typhus. Enjoy.<eos> - Where's the antidote?<eos> - You'll just kill me - and keep it for yourselves.<eos> - Then you're gonna take us to it.
Because Leonard just pissed me off.<eos> Am I being an idiot or not?<eos> No, I don't think you are.<eos> Really?<eos> The best way to achieve a goal is to devote 100% of your time and energy to it.
No, really, you've got great hair.<eos> Well, I don't even do anything to it.<eos> In fact, I haven't even washed it in two days.<eos> That's the best part.<eos> The dirt and the oils give it extra body.
Give it a chance, Sheldon;<eos> you might actually like it.<eos> You're absolutely right.<eos> Nope.<eos> Well, you can't say he didn't give it a fair shot.
Without rules, there's chaos.<eos> Out of chaos rise angels like Naomi, Bartholomew...<eos> Metatron.<eos> Well, perhaps I've been down here with them for too long.<eos> There's seemingly... nothing but chaos. But not all bad comes from it.
Uh, two years?<eos> Five years? I mean, you know, there's no rush to start a family.<eos> I mean, after all, uh, Lyndsey's well beyond her child-bearing age.<eos> Well, we have talked about adopting a baby from China. Oh!<eos> Course, then we'd have to teach it English, which seems like a lot of work.
I did.<eos> After Conrad left her for me, it must've been a wake-up call.<eos> But if she thinks that I'm going to tolerate her insolence, she's wrong.<eos> There are other ways to deal with her. What are you trying to say?<eos> That if I created this beast, don't you think it's time I slay it?
I need more time.<eos> Distract it?<eos> How am I gonna distract it?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Tell it dirty limericks.
Previously, on Reign...<eos> He heard them talk of a creature that resides in the woods.<eos> They give it blood.
You wanna know why? !<eos> I'll tell you why!<eos> Because Charlie... was late.<eos> Seriously, if you take off this blindfold and anyone is naked, I will kill everyone in a 10-foot radius.<eos> No, we knew you hated your apartment, so we gave it a makeover.
"How did you get into this business?"<eos> Well, I was at IBM for a few years.<eos> - I knew it.<eos> - Yes.<eos> And I saw that they have got a great product, but they don't trust it.
Want to hear its heartbeat?<eos> There it is.<eos> Can you hear it?<eos> The baby is fine.<eos> Nothing happened to it.
'Rescue One to Mission Control.'<eos> This is Blue, Rescue One.<eos> Report. The Dalek has an internal defence mechanism.<eos> 'We've lost Ross.' What kind of defence mechanism?<eos> 'That thing knows you're in there to help it!
Who?<eos> The pig!<eos> I don't know! What do you want me to do?<eos> An autopsy?<eos> We gave it valium, and it got a heart attack.
The Brahmins and their ilk.<eos> As if their fortunes just waited down from Episcopalian heaven.<eos> I've dealt with it all my life.<eos> Money doesn't know where it comes from.<eos> And it wouldn't give a damn if it did.
Is she dead?<eos> No, she has a pulse, but it's incredibly weak.<eos> What's happening to her?<eos> It-it must be the egg.<eos> Melanie's connected to it.
~ She's very vulnerable.<eos> ~ What do the voices say? Don't know.<eos> She takes tablets and they stop.<eos> You people, you never learn.<eos> If a child is speaking, listen to it!
X-ray water?<eos> ~ It's so cool.<eos> Look at this.<eos> We call it dark water.<eos> Only organic matter can be seen through it.
Since when can you burn a ghost?<eos> I'm not following.<eos> No, it's following you!<eos> Lauren: I thought we burnt it.<eos> I guess we gave it corporeal form!
I'm not following.<eos> No, it's following you!<eos> Lauren: I thought we burnt it.<eos> I guess we gave it corporeal form!<eos> Should have given it a makeover.
It's overridden the deletion sequence.<eos> It's fighting back.<eos> What was it doing?<eos> Trying to escape into the real world.<eos> It manipulated you into giving it your password so that it could access your laptop.
All magic has a cost.<eos> What are you saying?<eos> The Sword requires a sacrifice... the life of anybody who wields it.<eos> You're lying.<eos> The moment a man uses the Sword to kill, his soul, and hence, his life will be taken with it.
Can I get you a glass of champagne, Mr. Gaines?<eos> Shut up.<eos> Right.<eos> Ladies and gentlemen... the President and First Lady of the United States.<eos> It was different sitting at the table, instead of serving it.
WHERE IS IT?<eos> DID THE KING DIE?<eos> YES.<eos> WHAT ABOUT THE MEDALLION? WELL, THE MEDALLION STAYED HIDDEN FOR A LONG TIME.<eos> NO ONE FOUND IT, EVEN THOUGH MANY PEOPLE LOOKED FOR IT.
It will know who you are.<eos> And it's all ours.<eos> You think people really want all that personal information under one roof?<eos> It's not the roof that matters, Adam.<eos> It's the warm fuzzy feeling of the home under it.
This is the book of protection against black magic.<eos> I can't believe this.<eos> Where did you find it?<eos> Don't ask, kid.<eos> If this thing does what it says, it will allow us to penetrate their protection.
Da Costa.<eos> You're late for your shift.<eos> Yes, I have a little problem ...<eos> No, no.<eos> You can not work with it.'Re out.
Just look at me, all right?<eos> Look me in the eye.<eos> This means a lot to you, right?<eos> That knife.<eos> Play it. You present it, all right'?
Wanna make sure this thing doesn't double back and come back through this way.<eos> Uh, wait a minute.<eos> I don't have the sticky acid.<eos> Yeah, but you've got the gun, you've got the handcuffs, the mace.<eos> Trust me, this thing is more scared of you than you are of it.
And I still say yes to this day I did some of my most unusual paintings and I'm very proud of them.<eos> He was very supportive. Very supportive.<eos> Alejandro motivated me to such an extent I used to go in at weekends just to finish paintings.<eos> I've got this memory of coming up with the pirate spaceship over a weekend.<eos> It's been mortally wounded and all this spice is spilling out of it.
Will you tell me what's wrong there ... or I should ask for dad to tell it?<eos> Talk back with Josh?<eos> I was on the phone with Josh.<eos> He could not hear me.<eos> I bought a hearing aid, but he did not use it.
How do you feel?<eos> I feel good, I released my Chi.<eos> You must be careful with this, Tiger.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> You used power to break the spear, instead of guiding your Chi to evade it.
What could have happened to the baby, Victoria?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Mama didn't show you?<eos> She doesn't know what happened to her baby.<eos> She went walking in the woods, looking for it.
Absolutely positive.<eos> I'd brag to women about it.<eos> I tried to convince my friends.<eos> Well, turns out it dates back to the 19th century.<eos> I must've been exposed to it when I was a child, and forgotten.
- What?<eos> - You gotta accept this.<eos> Accept it.<eos> Take it to yourself.<eos> Bond with it.
The girl.<eos> That's the question.<eos> You meet a woman in a bar.<eos> She takes you to a man who demands money.<eos> You give it.
You can influence it.<eos> You can build your own things, that other people can use.<eos> It's to shake off this erroneous notion that life is just there, and you're just gonna live in it, versus embrace it.<eos> Change it' Improve it.<eos> Make your mark upon it.
The angel maker wants that same peace.<eos> He hopes to feel his way cautiously inside it and find it's endless, all around him.<eos> He's gonna be disappointed.<eos> You accept the impossibility of such a feeling, whereas the angel maker is still chasing it.<eos> If he got close to it, that's where he will look for it again.
The remaining 95 percent never live out their fantasies.<eos> Think about their suffering.<eos> Sexuality is the strongest force in human beings.<eos> To be born with a forbidden sexuality must be agonizing.<eos> The pedophile who manages to get through life with the shame of his desire while never acting on it, deserves a bloody medal.
- Who the hell are you?<eos> - It's obviously his son.<eos> Look at him.<eos> He's got Martin's face.<eos> Maybe that's why I wanna punch it.
- What?<eos> I found Schiller's cocaine.<eos> Are you kidding me? (Claps hands)<eos> That's fantastic.<eos> Where is it?
The salt, Pete.<eos> I know.<eos> That's what made 'em so good.<eos> Pete, w-what if the handful of artifacts that were created by the windstorm weren't the objects that the salt covered, but the salt itself?<eos> What if it's imbued with some sort of power?
It is the fear of change, of transformation.<eos> Allow yourself that feeling.<eos> Don't be afraid.<eos> Befriend it.<eos> Shake hands with it.
Where's the porthole from?<eos> Oh, that's, uh--that's from the airship Norge, right? It was the first dirigible to cross the North Pole.<eos> Pete and I snagged that, what, Artie, two years ago?<eos> Yes, it's been in the Ovoid Quarantine ever since.<eos> It's time we gave it a home.
Laid waste to the arena of Capua.<eos> Defeated Glaber and all of the Roman hordes who followed.<eos> Restored heart torn from chest.<eos> If you and I had taken to loving arms, fate may have led us on a less glorious path.<eos> Batiatus once warned me that a man must accept his fate or will be destroyed by it.
I'm sorry. I'm just...<eos> I'm not used to riding western.<eos> Try loosening up on the reins.<eos> These horses don't need much direction.<eos> In dressage, it's all about complete control over your animal, making the horse do what you want it to, not what comes naturally to it.
A-a buster?<eos> It means "lame" in white people.<eos> Oh, Rex Evans is the...quarterback.<eos> Yeah. I've been working my ass off, and Gomer freaking Pyle will barely throw me the rock.<eos> Well, maybe you have to establish your rhythm off the field before you can find one on it.
You're gonna live.<eos> You, your sister, and me-- we're gonna survive, I know it.<eos> Where's your knife?<eos> Put your T-shirt behind it.<eos> You've gotta be able to get to it quickly.
You hated The Cicada's Lament.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> You're that Joel Stephens?<eos> Oh, surely, you didn't hate the book.<eos> He gave it one star.
- and with good reason.<eos> - Which is?<eos> You know normal wolves never abandon an injured member of the pack.<eos> They care for it.<eos> They bring it food from a kill and then regurgitate it into the mouth of the injured wolf.
Hey.<eos> Good to see you, Jax.<eos> You, too, Jury.<eos> That flash looks good on your chest.<eos> Just trying to live up to it, you know?
A friend.<eos> Someone to be at your side when I'm away.<eos> It will be with you when I cannot.<eos> It will?<eos> Give it a name.
I do slow food. Oh.<eos> I'm all about the slow food thing.<eos> What the hell is slow food?<eos> It's eating what's around you.<eos> Watching it grow.
Hey.<eos> No, no, no, wait!<eos> It likes me.<eos> It's biting me!<eos> Try hiding from it in the tall, dry grass!
But remember, Barnabas, family is the only real wealth.<eos> Hm?<eos> [JOSHUA CHUCKLES]<eos> BARNABAS:<eos> As our business grew, the town of Collinsport grew with it and we decided to put down permanent roots.
Mor'du!<eos> Elinor, run!<eos> Sire!<eos> Come on, you!<eos> Some say our destiny is tied to the land as much a part of us as we are of it.
No, John.<eos> We can get her back.<eos> Look, you remember when you were 10, and you hit that squirrel with your BB gun?<eos> And then when we saw it fall from the tree, we both started crying, you remember?<eos> And then we ran up to it and we tried to give it CPR, and it came back to life.
Look, you remember when you were 10, and you hit that squirrel with your BB gun?<eos> And then when we saw it fall from the tree, we both started crying, you remember?<eos> And then we ran up to it and we tried to give it CPR, and it came back to life.<eos> John, we could do that again.<eos> Ted, we crushed its ribcage and blew out its lungs trying to give it CPR.
To the sword.<eos> Lock her up.<eos> One never knows when royal blood may be of value.<eos> So poisonous was the reign of Ravenna, that nature turned on itself and people turned on each other.<eos> The land died and with it, hope.
A rabid dog would be more agreeable pupil.<eos> Barely answers to the name given him.<eos> All men can be tamed.<eos> No matter how wild.<eos> One must only find an ember of purpose, and give it breath.
- Not yet. - Oh.<eos> What's that?<eos> Bonfire's my all-purpose cure all for bad luck.<eos> I don't know where this boat's been or what kind of person the owner was before me.<eos> For all I know, there could be some serious bad business left on it.
Ha-ha-ha. Sure is.<eos> Ha, ha.<eos> And I have a nice-sized farm up in Churdan, family-owned for four generations.<eos> Three thousand seven hundred acres, as of today.<eos> Now, if I could be personally certain of your product, give it the Whipple seal of approval, maybe there's something that I could do to help you.
I imagine John Watson thinks love is a mystery to me but the chemistry is incredibly simple and very destructive.<eos> When we first met, you told me that disguise is always a self-portrait.<eos> How true of you.<eos> The combination to your safe your measurements, but this, this is far more intimate.<eos> This is your heart and you should never let it rule your head.
Miles Van Ness made his fortune in the gold rush, eventually settling in Bodega Bay.<eos> SAM:<eos> Anything unusual ever happen in the house?<eos> Over the course of a century, things are going to happen in a house.<eos> - Tell it what to do.
But for which of my good parts did you first suffer love for me?<eos> Suffer love! A good epithet!<eos> I do suffer love, indeed, for I love thee against my will.<eos> In spite of your heart, I think.<eos> If you will spite it for my sake, I will spite it for yours, for I could never love that which my friend hates.
Christ, it's freezing.<eos> Karen?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Maybe.<eos> I don't know. I don't get how you have a kid and not give a shit what happens to it.
You were married to that yankee, right?<eos> I heard he cheated on you.<eos> Man, you must have cleaned up in that divorce.<eos> It always amazes me how much power is in this little piece of paper.<eos> I mean, with it, all your problems disappear.
I heard he cheated on you.<eos> Man, you must have cleaned up in that divorce.<eos> It always amazes me how much power is in this little piece of paper.<eos> I mean, with it, all your problems disappear.<eos> Without it, your aussie friend... he ends up begging one of my guys not to shoot him in the kneecap.
"Gian Luca, my love, I leave as soon as possible and I leave behind these cursed lands. and the memory of the horror that I lived in them.<eos> Nothing binds me to this place.<eos> The woman who loved lies dead, buried under the shadow of these impassive mountains.<eos> When God lift me, my secrets will go with my shroud and like them, say nothing,<eos> because the memory of men is limited, and beyond the world, eternal, and no one can escape it.
I don't want him deciding to get curious.<eos> Safer that way.<eos> Safer or simpler?<eos> So you've tranq'd that thing up?<eos> If I give it any more, I could put it into respiratory failure.
How you feeling?<eos> So sleepy.<eos> Do you need anything? No.<eos> But... I've kinda been thinking about the baby.<eos> We should probably get it some diapers or clothes and stuff.
Very belittling.<eos> Who's the stupid therapist here?<eos> I guess that would be me.<eos> Your idiot neighbor is yelling at me for no reason.<eos> I've got a can of Mace in my purse and I am not afraid to bash his skull in with it.
We're open to suggestions.<eos> What about an effective offense?<eos> No, we already tried.<eos> I nearly took its head off.<eos> And argent emptied an entire clip into it.
You don't think I had anything to do with this?<eos> Oh, we need to check out everybody who had contact with Robert recently.<eos> We understand there was some contention between you two about the bridge project?<eos> We found Robert's cell phone at the construction site.<eos> In it, there was an appointment at 9:30 with someone with the initials "S.B."
Hey.<eos> Uh, sorry I haven't been around.<eos> I, uh, just wanted to let you know that I gave, uh, Chunky Stu...<eos> Uh, sorry, Stuart, his intestinal transplant today.<eos> It went great.
How about you?<eos> It's a genre novel but not just that.<eos> It's poetic, and shows -deep introspection of human being.<eos> - Sir...<eos> But I don't think he likes it.
The book: White Fang. - Oh.<eos> - This guy Befriends a wild creature.<eos> But he must, he must set the animal free because that's what's best for it.<eos> I know the plot of White Fang. But the animal won't go.<eos> So with a breaking heart, he throws stones at it until it runs away.
He said bring it to a woman named Grace Beaumont.<eos> She knew something about the power.<eos> No, no.<eos> No!<eos> The thing about iron is, no matter how tough it is, you can beat the hell out of it and mold it into whatever you please.
Like intelligence.<eos> Communication.<eos> These things just got a whole lot scarier.<eos> If the Alpha's giving the orders, he's the one we focus on.<eos> If we capture the Alpha and put it back through, we'll establish this as our territory, and the others should follow it back.
I imagine he prefers Elena the way she is.<eos> Nice try, Klaus, but I trust Damon a hell of a lot more than I trust you.<eos> And I trust no one.<eos> Which is why my sister is lying daggered in a box.<eos> The more who find out about the cure, the more will go after it.
See, after we let you go...<eos> What is this?<eos> Marvin's Book of Firsts?<eos> Ted took Marvin to see Santa?<eos> ! Oh, I am gonna take this book and I'm gonna shove it so far up his...
- My business partner.<eos> Estonians don't care if he doesn't have the laptop.<eos> They'll kill him just because he knew about it.<eos> Just because of a laptop?<eos> Because of what was on it, and getting it back may be the only leverage we have to keep you alive.
I don't know anything about a phone.<eos> There's one thing that still puzzles me, is why he confessed.<eos> I've been racking my brain.<eos> I can only come up with two possible answers.<eos> One, he thought you left it there by mistake after a tryst, and you were planning to go back, retrieve it, dispose of it, having no idea that the police would recover it first.
The Mayor will see you now.<eos> Water, Mr Rango, water.<eos> Without it, there's nothing but dust and decay.<eos> But with water there's life.<eos> Look at them, so desperate to live, they'll follow it anywhere.
You're just in time for tea.<eos> Thank you for talking to me, Ella Mae. Breaking the ban, I mean.<eos> Half the folks in this community think I'm as senile as a loon anyway.<eos> They'll think I forgot there even was a ban.<eos> Besides, there are times the human heart needs more than the old ways can give it.
When we need a family chronicle written by a libelist we know who to call.<eos> All right.<eos> Thanks.<eos> This way, miss.<eos> If a woman approaches any beast and lies with it, you shall kill the woman and the beast.
I dreamed about a horse being hoisted by cables to a considerable height.<eos> Suddenly, a cable breaks and the horse is dashed to the ground.<eos> But it's not hurt.<eos> It leaps up and gallops away, impeded only by a heavy log, which it's obliged to drag along the ground.<eos> Then a rider on a small horse appears in front of it so that it's forced to slow down.
He spoke to a member of the crew on the pump.<eos> - You know who?<eos> - Not yet, but everything is under control.<eos> You can not hide.<eos> Find it!
Oh, to us maybe.<eos> For all we know, this one's a prime specimen, the Brad pitt of Skitter world.<eos> Porter says we have to try to communicate with this thing.<eos> Figure out how it thinks, we can figure out how to beat it.<eos> You actually think you'll figure a way to talk to it?
8:30.<eos> What did his heart do at 8:30?<eos> It... literally skipped a beat.<eos> Your heart's talking to you, Barney.<eos> Do you have the guts to listen to it?
I have a gift for you.<eos> Give that to your saddler.<eos> He'll provide the rest.<eos> You must shape the horse to the rider.<eos> Start with a yearling and teach it to respond to the reins and to the boy's voice.
The brain is the human body's most mysterious organ.<eos> It learns... it changes... it adapts.<eos> It tells us what we see... what we hear.<eos> It lets us feel love.<eos> I think it holds our soul.
- Forty thousand ducats.<eos> - If he lives.<eos> If he dies, 400,000.<eos> Giulia Farnese is having her portrait painted?<eos> Papa commissioned it.
I thought I would not be cardinal for today.<eos> Then my heart is in danger.<eos> Would you endanger it, Cardinal Borgia?<eos> I would put it in fear of its life.<eos> But I would never harm it.
We'll get chocolate chip pancakes after.<eos> Awesome!<eos> Are you sure you pressed the right button?<eos> This thing never works.<eos> Give it a sec.
And that's exactly what you'll get!<eos> You think you're smart, but you're just stupid.<eos> I won't be talking to my child like that.<eos> And I'll take care of it.<eos> I won't be leaving it on its own all the time.
So why are you peering into your vagina?<eos> This isn't how I meant to tell you.<eos> You're pregnant?<eos> Are you sure?<eos> I thought of the 9 months ahead, to dream about our baby, feel it move, speak to it, caress it.
I guess what I have to do.<eos> Since they believe in me, I'm walking also.<eos> What put you in Carl Ertz's house that night?<eos> Honestly, work.<eos> I wanted to get this project going for my brother and he was into it.
Wait, you're telling me that this whole thing, all of it, is one big giant brain?<eos> That's exactly what I'm saying.<eos> Agent Lee, Gus is a growing, evolving mind.<eos> "Gus"?<eos> Well, I thought that since it's a single living entity that perhaps we should name it for the sake of clarity.
Yes, but good ... No seriously.<eos> Then it will be ...<eos> Land your plane, pilot. It's the end of your flight.<eos> Take him to the barracks.<eos> I will decide what to do with it.
SHEILA:<eos> Well, hi, neighbor.<eos> Dinner tonight?<eos> [GEORGE SIGHS]<eos> Now, bio scientists have determined that when you remove an animal from its indigenous environment... For example, the Gentoo penguin. ...And deposit said animal into a region that it's not accustomed to it is far more susceptible to infectious disease.
Karl Mercier admitted to pushing Mallory.<eos> The D.A. hit him with involuntary manslaughter.<eos> So he'll do two years minimum.<eos> And the gold?<eos> Courts will decide, but since it originally belonged to Karl and Freddy extorted it, Karl will probably get it all back.
What did that animal ever do for you?<eos> I know that you dont care about him.<eos> Atleast I have a plan to do something with the land.<eos> You know nothing about thatland.<eos> Just stay out of it.
Go get your bag.<eos> We will be leaving shortly.<eos> Cam, you don't have to ice her out completely.<eos> Do you think I'm enjoying this?<eos> But I need her to detach from me before the new thing comes, or who knows what she'll do to it.
Wow, Ash.<eos> That dress is criminal.<eos> Thank you.<eos> It's my dress-to-impress outfit.<eos> I'm hoping Victoria pays more attention to it than the disaster I made of her mother-daughter team.
It's just the way it has to be.<eos> Arthur... don't let anyone tell you what to do.<eos> You said you are your own man.<eos> You've a good heart.<eos> Be true to it.
You're dead. You're a zombie.<eos> Without a doubt. My brain may be hanging out but I'm not a zombie.<eos> I'm not a zombie!<eos> As you can see, in rare cases a zombie is able to retain his intelligence and his ability to speak.<eos> But should you ever meet such an exemplar do not try to communictae with it.
But I'm sick of living in your narrow-minded world.<eos> And your so-called "unbendable" rules are a joke you won't be laughing at soon.<eos> I'm going to load the cannon, so don't mess around with the target!<eos> What did Professor Tarantoga say?<eos> The void is dissolving the cosmos 'cause it doesn't like it any more?
We can't turn back anymore.<eos> It's too late.<eos> We would lose everything.<eos> We have to see Dr. Menzel tomorrow, or we'll never be free.<eos> Even if a piece of wood floats in water for a hundred years, it'll never become a crocodile...
I had them made.<eos> You probably think it's silly.<eos> Not at all.<eos> You love your country.<eos> You've dedicated your life to it.
Why kinda lines these are?<eos> I cant feel anything<eos> everything will be fine you will go in finals for sure<eos> what is life?<eos> Life is a game play with it life is a song, sing it
- She's already seen you half-naked! - Shut up!<eos> YASMIN NOOR<eos> Nothing lasts here...<eos> The sea claims everything<eos> I can share everything with it, tell it all my secrets,
Nope, just a spacewalker.<eos> Those tears on the shield shell were...<eos> Day three. Their first task is to capture Hubble.<eos> The rendezvous is basically us finding the telescope.<eos> Now it's doing 17,500 miles an hour... so by the time we get right next to it... we're doing the same thing.
- To protect you.<eos> Yeah, but how is blowing up the plane protecting us?<eos> With that plane gone,<eos> - That thing won't be able to leave the island.<eos> - Yeah, well, neither will we, And then we'll be stuck here with it,
We're born that way.<eos> The rest of us are born with consciences.<eos> Which is something you just sound ecstatic about.<eos> I'm not saying it's logical, it's human.<eos> So if you know your conscience is just an animal instinct, you don't need to follow it.
I am a witch hunter.<eos> I collect the signs of the dark forces and record what I learn in my book.<eos> There is much evidence of the witches I seek here in Draeganoth.<eos> And that fragment you hold in your hand is one of the most powerful conveyors of the dark forces that I have found, a witch's most-valued weapon.<eos> With it, they can conjure the blue fire of lightning, can convey themselves as if on a gust of wind.
There are many ways to define our fragile existence, many ways to give it meaning.
There are many ways to define our fragile existence, many ways to give it meaning.<eos> I love you.<eos> I love you, Nathan.<eos> But it is our memories that shape its purpose and give it context.
Yeah, well, it sounds like you need a plan, buddy.<eos> Exactly.<eos> That's exactly what I need.<eos> Dude, I was thinking, I was, like, You know, I probably need a plan here but what plan? You know?<eos> You know-you know sometimes What I like to do is-is, uh, open up a problem And really examine it.
That's why I recognized the tactics.<eos> He tore our ships apart.<eos> We barely escaped with our lives.<eos> In the end, a Jedi-led task force moved in to settle the matter.<eos> Trench's ship was destroyed and we assumed he went down with it.
Grab and gab? Force him to talk?<eos> Oh, easy, tiger.<eos> He's got a cell phone.<eos> That should be useful.<eos> I'd lift it, but he doesn't seem to ever let go of it.
It is his fate<eos> He can't come back<eos> It is his fate<eos> Kafka, your heart is missing!<eos> Chase after it or you can't come back
- It was too big, too many empty rooms.<eos> Does it ever bother you, Amy, that your life doesn't make any sense?<eos> - What was that?<eos> - OK, I need a proper look.<eos> - Got to draw its fire, give it a target.
This is your captain speaking.<eos> We're getting more reports about this half shark, half octopus creature that's terrorizing the coast, but please do not panic.<eos> There is a way we can stop this thing.<eos> Virgin sacrifices.<eos> Yes, the Mexican Fish and Game Commission assures me the only way to appease this beast is to offer it a beautiful virgin, preferably 18 to 25 years old.
DEADSHOT:<eos> I liked you better as a blond.<eos> Why are you doing this to me?<eos> I didn't do anything.<eos> Funny thing about fate, you can't outrun it.
It's kind of a sweet, savory chicken sandwich.<eos> Hm. And I got a ginger ale from the swift mart, and I picked up some aspirin.<eos> Are you happy?<eos> Let me see.<eos> They named it right.
It's time to move on.<eos> You know, I don't think you' supposed to loiter out here.<eos> I have a feeling this building is supposed to blend in.<eos> People smoke outside of buildings, Will.<eos> I'm helping it blend.
Keep walking.<eos> [GUNSHOTS GRUNTS]<eos> [TIRES SCREECH]<eos> -Give me that baby.<eos> -What do you want with it?
Fletcher is not under covert status with the agency and therefore can be named publicly.<eos> - You framed a CIA agent?<eos> - Well, he wasn't under covert status.<eos> He was a punk analyst who stepped out of line and needed to be put in place.<eos> The rebels will squeeze a confession out post it, and by the time it's been re-tweeted around the world he will have assumed room temperature and the scandal will have blown over.
- All the more reason.<eos> - No. I can't.<eos> Then why are you here?<eos> Why did you come back?<eos> Now, I'll have to speak to it in order for it to open.
Some say she's 2,000 years old.<eos> You believe in that Dungeons Dragons rubbish?<eos> Where I grew up, we're very superstitious.<eos> Cragwich is particularly fascinating to me.<eos> The book of folklore tells the story of this village, and what Carmilla did to it and its daughters.
And yet nothing REALLY has ever happened to them<eos> So if you've all been right then we've have earned the rice. Stop it!<eos> please please stop it.<eos> Now.<eos> The college gets the rice that it gets.
-Just hold it still.<eos> -What are you doing?<eos> -I wanna show this to Thomas.<eos> -You said we can't handle them.<eos> -I'm just gonna show it.
These were taken as the probe was entering the orbit of the only Earth Like planet known to exist.<eos> People of the whole world are watching as the probe sent into space is transferring data exceeding even the most optimistic expectations.<eos> We knew to expect water on Tanis.<eos> We knew to expect reasonable temperatures.<eos> But the questioned remained- will this planet meet the extremely complex and unlikely combination of parameters to support life as we know it?
Darling,are you readyto watch me become rich?<eos> I'm gonna relish this.<eos> Oh,what the hell?<eos> This is not good.<eos> If that plane doesn't cometo us,we got to go to it.
Go home.<eos> [SIGHS]<eos> And when I come across evil...<eos> You're not even a cop.<eos> - I do everything in my power to put it to an end.
Who are you really, Mike?<eos> Just a guy trying to make things better.<eos> It's a 1968 Dodge Coronet.<eos> I've uploaded tags and vin number to Kitt.<eos> You've gotta find that car. Or what's left of it.
But it's gonna be a fantastic new tool if we can get it to tell the difference between soldiers and children.<eos> We have a Phil problem, and that means we have a meat problem.<eos> I can't have a Phil or a meat problem.<eos> It's bad enough I have a cyborg problem.<eos> Stupid thing just kills whatever's in front of it.
If so, is there any evidence that remins to this days?<eos> One example might be this one.<eos> Often described as the world's first mechanical computer, it dates back over 2000 years.<eos> The Antikythera device was found in 1900 by sponge divers. diving off a small island in the Aegean called the Antikythera.<eos> There was a ship wreck there, and... in it was a coral incrusted box.
What is it, 11-12?<eos> Why is Six so convinced there is another place?<eos> Because for people like Six, life is not enough.<eos> The simple life...<eos> They want to escape it.
That's a model to imagine and look back to. But we also will need a lot more full-time farmers, otherwise, you know, what are we going to be eating?<eos> Feeding ourselves as oil goes into decline is clearly going to require a national effort and, in an ideal world, a bit of government leadership.<eos> But for my part, weaning this farm off fossil fuel is all I can do.<eos> And the pioneers I've met recently are a big inspiration.<eos> Now I've learnt to observe the land, and work with it rather then fight against it.
What are you saying, this is not a person?<eos> My dear, I'm not certain that you're not simply a figment of my imagination.<eos> No, this is certainly not human, rather a highly advanced technology-<eos> A mechano/organic hybrid.<eos> I suspect that they produce or possibly ingest the mercury and that it controls the tissue, instructing it to take and maintain shapes.
Anything you can't shift out of your way.<eos> I always carry some of this.<eos> Ginger?<eos> What are you going to do, knock up a chow mein?<eos> No, just whittle a bit into a plug, get round behind your stubborn animal, and with one quick movement, you shove it right up its arse.
But I could hear somebody and they heard me.<eos> My goodness, Sally Draper, try not to take everything so personally.<eos> Jeez Louise.<eos> The phone is cheap.<eos> It's everyday, and you can't trust it.
Well, you may return any time to view the treaty.<eos> You're very kind.<eos> - We may return, too?<eos> - You are always welcome.<eos> My heart will remain, and I hope to join it soon.
Hey there, little man.<eos> Oh!<eos> It's all right. I'm here.<eos> I think I've just seen Nathan stealing a baby.<eos> He just ran off with it.
(Lardo) Are you okay?<eos> Will you help me, Lardo? Yeah.<eos> Those guys were acting like such guys, tonight. Yeah.<eos> This pet's having like no effect.<eos> Um, you just gotta give it some time to kick in, ya know?
Daniel, not in front of the civilians.<eos> Oh, goddamn.<eos> Goddamn, Hollis.<eos> This is where we hold our conversation.<eos> In it, you reveal to me that you and Dreiberg have been sleeping together.
We cannot control the things life does to us.<eos> They are done before you know it, and once they are done they make you do other things until at last, everything comes between you and the man you wanted to be.<eos> We all have choices in life.<eos> You made yours.<eos> Sometimes a man can meet his destiny on the road he took to avoid it.
Come on.<eos> Ms. Ford, Ellen brought a...<eos> Greetings.<eos> I have been asked by Mr. Bennett to personally escort a gift.<eos> Whatever it is, Ellen, please, escort it back.
Shut up, man!<eos> You are making me nervous!<eos> Where the hell is the Asia? !<eos> Forget it.<eos> No, man, we must look for it!
Owen, can you hear me?<eos> Owen, come in!<eos> Yeah, yeah, I'm here.<eos> The device, is it doing anything?<eos> Because the energy levels coming from it are...
- That's his mother.<eos> That's Rhys's mother.<eos> Hiya.<eos> There's... there's a monster, Rhys.<eos> That American and the Japanese girl, they went after it.
What exactly are we looking for?<eos> Prender said his wifeNwas publishing a book.<eos> Why would she hide the manuscript?<eos> Someone found out sheNwas writing a book.<eos> Someone didn't care forNsomething that was in it.
Stories to help us understand the world we live in.<eos> All right. Okay.<eos> This is the most fun I've had in years.<eos> So, what does that say about the Boogeyman?<eos> It says we're trying to define evil by giving it a face and a name.
This going to work?<eos> This thing's so ancient, It doesn't even have The protocols<eos> Modern day security systems Defend against.<eos> It's brinng back memories Of playing of playing zork.<eos> I'm tempted to tell it To go throw the crystal orb.
Previously on dexter.<eos> This child is happening.<eos> I'm going to have a child.<eos> But I can't be a father to it.
Of course, you will have no use for it when you move to a smaller place.<eos> - My dear...<eos> - And, of course, it belongs here. - Belongs to the house.<eos> - And the house belongs to you.<eos> Though you neither care for it, nor need it, nor deserve it.
We'd better get this baby over to Coco's cabin.<eos> You go.<eos> I'm just gonna stare at the lake and think about how I almost killed a baby.<eos> I need you to watch this baby.<eos> And don't try to sleep with it because it doesn't have any money.
No.<eos> Then may I ask how you account for his disappearance?<eos> I don't account for it.<eos> No doubt he is travelling somewhere, or hiding somewhere.<eos> Let him account for it.
They made tofu kebabs for you, sweetheart.<eos> Come on Zina.<eos> Sami's down stairs.<eos> He asked where you were.<eos> Send him this dress, he'd probably love it.
Up we go.<eos> - Yeah. See, you get a good piece of meat...<eos> - No!<eos> ...you can't just stick it up on a hook.<eos> You gotta give it that little something extra.
And he has the water. -We can not meet him in the desert.<eos> -That is exactly what Saladin thinks.<eos> And that is why we shall defeat him.<eos> We have the true cross, de Gothia.<eos> Under it has no Christian army been defeated.
Code white!<eos> Subject is conscious!<eos> Help!<eos> It's looking at you.<eos> Try saying something to it.
We need a present.<eos> It's the middle of the night.<eos> We need a present.<eos> Ok, I will go to the 24 hour garage. Good plan.<eos> Get it 20 Bensons and a a Twix.
That you're a freak.<eos> (girls laugh) Tell you what,<eos> I'm not interested.<eos> Hey, why don't you ask out your pillow instead?<eos> After what you've put it through, I think it deserves a night out.
This is the land of Sagyn's ancestors.<eos> We've spent most of our life here.<eos> After my husband's death, Sagyn inherited his land.<eos> Now it's your land, too.<eos> If you treat it with respect, it will protect you.
We gotta get outta here.<eos> - Where are you gonna go? - I'm not sure.<eos> I'm glad you thought this through.<eos> We'll get Kevin, we'll get Zoe, and we'll get out of dodge while we still can.<eos> Avoiding the issue isn't going to help resolve it.
- Well...<eos> - It's a simple question.<eos> I do not have a simple answer.<eos> Once you have kids, you'll understand.<eos> If the Nelsons were really willing to do anything for their child, they would be getting it medical attention.
OK, I want to give you the name of Dr. Johann Averies. He's a colleague.<eos> He's a demonologist, he specializes in this sort of thing. - He's in Los Angeles.<eos> All right, check this out. What if we just get this Ouija board, right?<eos> We find out what it wants, then we give it what it wants and then... gone.<eos> Because what it probably wants is Katie.
I doubt that you will even have the belly to stay in the hall all night.<eos> I find it difficult to argue with a drunk.<eos> But it's true, I did not win the race.<eos> We swam for five days, neck and neck.<eos> I was conserving my strength for the final stretch when this storm blew up and with it came sea monsters.
'Cause from what I heard, you guys that get sent up Concord for killing kids, life a motherfucker.<eos> If I see you again, I'm gonna get discourteous on you.<eos> And get that sausage off my lawn.<eos> - Well, what happened?<eos> - He said he didn't know anything, but if you had his money, you could put it in his mailbox.
Morning.<eos> I didn't even know you were sexually active.<eos> - Who is the kid?<eos> - The baby?<eos> I don't really know much about it other than it has fingernails.
But the truth is, the Stargate program just doesn't get the support it used to from the people in charge.<eos> - Why not?<eos> - Eureka!<eos> One down, 12 to go.<eos> That's too bad, because after all your Stargate program has accomplished for this network of planets, I would think the decision-makers would show it the respect it deserves. I would think the decision-makers would show it the respect it deserves.
And you would see to it that the court come to that decision?<eos> I have every confidence.<eos> As I have in Your Eminence.<eos> Wolsey will set up the court.<eos> Norfolk will head it.
When you heard Claire was in the water, you drowned.<eos> I dove in so you never went in!<eos> No matter what I try to do, you're going to die, Charlie.<eos> There's a woman in Hurley's tent who parachuted onto the island yesterday.<eos> The boat she took off from is 80 miles off the coast and that if she can find a way to contact it, we'll all be rescued.
I'm not saying it's Martin's best song.<eos> But for what it was supposed to be at that time it was amazing.<eos> I think he really hit the spot with that one.<eos> That's one of the good things about that video, for me.<eos> That kind of industrial edge that the battleship gives it.
All the men, they can feel it.<eos> It's the ghost of a lady widowed before her marriage, I figure it, searching for her husband, lost at sea.<eos> A virgin too, likely as not.<eos> And that bodes ill by all accounts.<eos> I say that we throw the dress overboard and we hope the spirit follows it. No!
You have to.<eos> I somehow feel I should give this to you.<eos> I'll return to you.<eos> I'll be the happiest man on earth.<eos> Fate will inevitably catch up with those who run away from it.
- Hey, look, the missing link.<eos> Put me down.<eos> - Give him back.<eos> - Him?<eos> What did you do? Name it?
You ought to get that checked out.<eos> I have a buddy of mine walking around with a limp just like that.<eos> He don't wanna go to the doctor, though, right?<eos> Finally he go, they say it's a fracture, right?<eos> And now it's infected. They gotta cut it off at the knee.
Resurrection on demand for the whole world, isn't that good?<eos> Isn't it though?<eos> Well, that's what I've been working for, all day and all night.<eos> The rest of them go swanning about, but I'm working.<eos> You've got to get inside this stuff. Surrender yourself to it.
It would have made dragging her out that much harder.<eos> She only had on the one shoe when we found her.<eos> What if he tied one end of the rope around her ankle, the other around the weight.<eos> And after it was in the water, the body began to decompose, become more buoyant and, at the same time, less cohesive.<eos> The rope dragged off, taking the shoe with it,
Rodney, you were almost done.<eos> Why did you stop?<eos> Reach in there.<eos> The largest cord.<eos> Follow it with your hand until you reach the end.
Of course Tucci's hair and fibers are on the body.<eos> He's hauling her around with his pork hands, isn't he?<eos> Any word from the chem lab?<eos> Same as the other murders.<eos> The killer used liquid nitrogen to preserve the tissue, give it that bleached look.
Okay, but who carried him in?<eos> No other track marks.<eos> Are these his?<eos> This... this rubber strap was around his arm?<eos> That's right, I took it off myself.
- Because...<eos> Because it's a racial slur.<eos> Brothers talk to other brothers like that. I was being friendly.<eos> Yes, Toofer.<eos> You see, in the last decade or so, the African-American community has reappropriated that word as a way of depriving it of its meaning.
There are nearly more of them than Germans.<eos> They should start by getting rid of them, then we'll have work again.<eos> I'm sure of it.<eos> That's my opinion.<eos> You shouldn't run after money, you should run towards it.
Add the high harmonies in the chorus.<eos> And last we brought in Kirk Canning to do a cello.<eos> And he had the same problem that Krist did, trying to get in tune, in tune to Kurt's funky five-string acoustic.<eos> So the track is a little out of tune.<eos> But that gives it the eeriness.

It was just a reflex.<eos> - Does it have a name?<eos> - Name?<eos> It is just a horse, no name.<eos> You name it.
- Everything okay, Father?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - How about some Pastis? - I'd love some.<eos> But let's bless the house first.<eos> "May the Lord bless this house and let us understand it, love it and serve it. Let us have its peace...
Who owns this building?<eos> The go-cart track owner?<eos> No, Suchat,<eos> It doesn't belong to him,<eos> He rents it from the owner, Understand?
Even better...<eos> Offer him a mint.<eos> Inside each one is a tracking device.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> He won't die if he swallows it, just get a little sick, a little nausea.
- Salvation Army.<eos> Wood and leather.<eos> Brass studs. Wow.<eos> This thing's a real beaut.<eos> Well, either buy it a ring or move on.
Comfortable?<eos> I'm not expecting you to be someone you're not.<eos> We're in a restaurant. We're dressed up. We're eating.<eos> Without small talk, what is there?<eos> According to Freud-- and I'm paraphrasing-- the instinct of love toward an object demands a mastery to obtain it, and if a person feels they can't control the object, or feel threatened by it,
Look, I don't even know what these papers mean!<eos> For all I know, they could be the ravings of her disturbed mind!<eos> Song lyrics mixed with equations!<eos> If this map is pointing to her, then you should know she resides here, in this area.<eos> She gave it a name -- territoire fonce.
Take these numbers she wrote down a bunch of times.<eos> Got any idea what it means?<eos> I thought at one time they might be coordinates of some kind.<eos> Coordinates, yeah.<eos> When you first found her -- the french chick -- you said you saw a wire or something on the beach, and you followed it, and it led you to her.
We never interfere in the natural development of other species.<eos> We only observe.<eos> Did you know about the silicon virus?<eos> That's why we come here.<eos> To see how different species react when they encounter it.
Ah, Mrs. Crawley.<eos> To the victor the spoils.<eos> You have carried off our hearts in triumph. If that is so, Your Majesty, then you may rest easy that your heart will be well looked after.<eos> That is a relief, for it has been bruised in its time.<eos> You must tell me at dinner how you mean to treat it.
- God. I love you.<eos> - I love you, Peter.<eos> How sad is that?<eos> This script could be terrific.<eos> We'll give it the Sellers-Edwards touch.
We'll still be sitting here getting older and uglier... and any spring could be our last...<eos> God damn it, I wanna go to the river now.<eos> Why are you such a dramatic old bastard?<eos> "I just want to breathe in every day.<eos> "Happiness makes up in height what it lacks in length."
You have the grace of God, sir, and he has enough.<eos> You speak it well.<eos> Give him a livery more guarded than his fellows'. See it done.<eos> I'm sorry you will leave my father so.<eos> Our house is hell, and you, a merry devil, did rob it of some taste of tediousness.
I'm almost to the surface.<eos> Moya senses there are still many Scarran attack ships out there.<eos> Get ready to jump.<eos> What?<eos> It's safer to fall into the web than risk being scooped up by it.
I represent a relatively new agency, Demon Research Initiative and we think that you might be the solution to our little problem.<eos> I'm not interested.<eos> [COUGHS] We don't particularly care.<eos> We figure we strap enough weight to you, you will sink, regardless of your interest.<eos> We need that sub, and we need you to deal with what's on it.
The woman was a saint.<eos> Here, Dad.<eos> I learned everything from that woman.<eos> "Life is a battle.<eos> "And you either enter it armed or you surrender immediately."
Please just listen to me!<eos> I keep telling you I don't know who Alex is!<eos> I'm a survivor of a plane crash.<eos> I found the wire on the beach.<eos> I followed it.
They weren't told it was alien DNA, but they obviously took their research further than the contract specified.<eos> Asgard DNA is programmed to grow a clone to maturity in three months, but they're an empty shell until an existing consciousness is transferred.<eos> - It was not capable of speaking.<eos> - (Carter) Exactly.<eos> They probably spent what time they had with it teaching it how to walk.
- Give it to me!<eos> - Get off.<eos> Give it back!<eos> - Shut up!<eos> All this stupid little country have to do is stand in line... and do what it's told for one miserable day!
- We're taking my parents out.<eos> But that was tentative, I thought.<eos> - You hate Indian food.<eos> - "Hate." That's a strong word.<eos> I've wanted to give it a second chance since I realized how much you...
-My room's a mess. -So?<eos> So it wasn't before and it is now.<eos> You are a reject.<eos> No, no, no, backspace, not return.<eos> why doesn't this bloody thing do what I tell it to?
- You're asking me why, Major?<eos> The world went from ten billion to less than a million.<eos> And what's left but false hope and real estate?<eos> The pods will be released eventually. But first Reich will have his organic food empire.<eos> - And I'll be the general that runs it.
It's big. If you like big, it's all right.<eos> That's all?<eos> Just big?<eos> It's an oil tycoon's house, certainly.<eos> But it's not the house that makes the home, John... but the people who are in it.
A masterpiece and a huge step forward for Chaplin.<eos> Early in the film, Chaplin keeps trying to abandon the abandoned baby.<eos> He injected within something, such as The Kid a truth, a poignancy, which was just magical.<eos> He's been landed with this baby.<eos> He doesn't know what to do with it.
I'd die every day for the rest of eternity for you.<eos> And this is how you repay me?<eos> We need her for our baby.<eos> To keep it safe.<eos> By anointing it in the blood of an innocent?
She's like a woman fighting for more than life. She fights like fighting is her life.<eos> It is the air she breathes, and she knows she will win because there is no alternative.<eos> It's your turn, Andrew.<eos> So you figure, what?<eos> I... I stand on the seal, and hold the knife, and command it to stop glowing in Tawarick?
Although how it became infested in the first place is very troublesome.<eos> Go on.<eos> Whoever these witches are, they're magnets for evil.<eos> It's drawn to their powers.<eos> - Can they withstand it?
She's right, but I think I should take Wyatt just to be on the safe side.<eos> What if the other baby wakes up?<eos> They won't be able to follow me where I'm going.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - It's gonna scream bloody murder and call half the Manticores in the city to come save it.
- Fish?<eos> Think big fish with sonar.<eos> John, I think you should have a rest first.<eos> D, I got a hum in my head.<eos> I'm gonna follow it.
And Doug doesn't know this? No! If he knew about it, he wouldn't go for it.<eos> I mean, he needs to think it's coming from the therapist.<eos> Why? Is that a horrible thing to do?<eos> Hand me the pen.<eos> So, in the dream, this weird red object kept appearing, and I couldn't get away from it no matter what I did.
By the way, Elaine's back.<eos> Elaine's been on the transplant list so long, she's in and out of here almost as much as I am.<eos> Hey, homeslice, we talked about this.<eos> Don't get into bed until I come in so I can see your booty.<eos> If I finally get a damn heart, I'll let you eat ice cream off it.
Jumpy?<eos> Lie still.<eos> Lie still!<eos> Watch this light.<eos> Follow it.
No.<eos> It was your idea to come to London.<eos> Yeah, I thought I'd be at 3,500 feet.<eos> Yeah, I thought I'd have over 200 men with me right now.<eos> Life's got a funny way of turning out different, though, don't it?
The monster in the Chamber of Secrets is a basilisk.<eos> That's why I can hear it speak.<eos> It's a snake.<eos> But if it kills by looking people in the eye, why is it no one's dead?<eos> Because no one did look it in the eye.
And darkness swallowed him up.<eos> He did not know what to do with Barbara.<eos> He was already turning to the bell tower when he remembered Kubat.<eos> Kubat was capable of cashing a flea over the stubble for a penny.<eos> Night after night he would go to his barn to guard his wheat against anyone stealing it. But he'd hardly get settled in the barn when he'd be overcome with fear someone might rob his cottage and so he'd race off to safeguard his home.
Oh, Mock-na.<eos> Which is...?<eos> A soothing brew to relieve tension.<eos> - Kind of looks like muddy water.<eos> - Yes. The mud gives it body and flavor.
If not, you'll leave without it.<eos> Are we agreed?<eos> Agreed.<eos> - It's yours, if you'd like it.<eos> - I wouldn't know what to feed it.
Don't worry about that right now.<eos> Just... do exactly what I say.<eos> Follow my instructions.<eos> Lock onto my voice signal.<eos> When the wormhole opens again, follow it.
You're betting on your friend staying in this misery?<eos> -I'll take that bet.<eos> -What?<eos> I'm miserable.<eos> I may as well make some money out of it.
I have to tell you, he has been so amazing the past few months,<eos> - so involved with the baby.<eos> - Good, good.<eos> Wow, you'd think those things would be against the law or something.<eos> - He talks to it every night.
OK, well, for starters, everyone here knows that you sell pills, and yet you use phrases like "take orally"<eos> and "increases blood flow" way, way too much.<eos> I mean, jeepers, Julie, you have half the doctors on this staff believing that if they join Team Plomox that they get an outside shot of you showing them the cotton inside your bottle.<eos> Would you like to know the real dirty, dirty little secret?<eos> It's that your drug is so good that you guys went ahead and put about a 600% mark-up on it.
For me to sign this, I would have to give you a physical.<eos> And when I say "l," I, of course, mean absolutely anybody but me.<eos> Barbie!<eos> Give my ex-wife here a physical, and don't be afraid of that third eye on her chest.<eos> Just remember, it's just as scared of you as you are of it.
As a loan. I would pay him back.<eos> Take the money.<eos> When a man gives you money, you give him control. It's just money.<eos> Man, woman, who cares? It's fluid.<eos> Someone needs it, you give it.
What are we gonna do about the child? Will you... shh!<eos> The front page! It's on the front page. The child, the one you were after!<eos> Will you be quiet?<eos> Don't you think I'm aware of the situation?<eos> I was up all night trying to find it.
But forget the rowboat, son.<eos> We'll travel in style.<eos> It's all been arranged, the whole ball of wax.<eos> For years, your granddad bent my ear with stories about that old book.<eos> I didn't buy it for a minute.
"Let your lips bear witness "to the blaze in your heart.<eos> "No one will believe the fire if the smoke sends no signals.<eos> "He who cares for his well-being keeps not his feelings silent.<eos> "My grief is greater than I. "And that being so,<eos> "it will be easier... "for it to defeat me... "than for me to command it.
- Who asked her to marry him.<eos> No, that one drove a Ford.<eos> He's a pilot.<eos> She met him on the plane coming over.<eos> He's got a huge house in the city, and needs a wife to go with it.
Hoping you'd change your mind about the girls.<eos> Have you?<eos> Killing me is the only way to keep me from trying to stop you!<eos> We're not gonna kill you, inspector.<eos> But what you don't understand is that by exposing the girls, you're not stopping evil, you're helping it.
- The Feds?<eos> - Some agency I never heard of.<eos> I don't care who they are.<eos> This thing's been killing cops.<eos> We oughta teach it a lesson.
I don't wanna scare her off.<eos> You have to be honest.<eos> Otherwise, you may think you're going down the same path..<eos> but you're really going down different ones.<eos> I'm gonna take that book and I'm gonna beat you to death with it.
Well...<eos> How very clever.<eos> What?<eos> It wasn't me. ln fact... I think you put it there yourself to get more attention.<eos> It was me. I put it there.
How many Napoletans does it take to screw in a lightbulb?<eos> There's only candles in Naples right now.<eos> The cardinal of the church controls that racket.<eos> That's a good one.<eos> You like it, you have can have it.
Now I see why you were getting up on your Americana.<eos> That's why I was waiting for you.<eos> To thank you for giving me so many points.<eos> You can hardly do justice to the subject in so short a time.<eos> Won't you devote the afternoon to it?
Fantastic!<eos> Monsieur le Comte, try one of these.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Although, it would take another six months... before he'd work up the nerve to ask Caroline out to dinner.<eos> As for Josephine... she took over the lease at the old cafe... and gave it a new name.
Over the course of this film, you'll see this footage as Bruce Lee had intended for it to be shown, and you'll also come to understand the struggle he had to undergo in order to bring it to the big screen.<eos> And perhaps along the way, you'll come to know the real Bruce Lee the man behind the legend, a little better as well.<eos> Water is the softest substance in the world but yet it can penetrate the hardest rock or anything, granite, you name it.<eos> Water, also, is insubstantial.<eos> By that I mean you cannot grasp hold of it. You cannot punch it and hurt it.
That flippy thing that you did...<eos> - Where did it go?<eos> - It's gone.<eos> - I saw it take off toward the woods.<eos> - And you didn't follow it?
And I love you.<eos> Not that way.<eos> But the bike got you a lot closer.<eos> Well, take it downstairs.<eos> You know, give it a test drive.
This is exactly the budget of my dream wedding.<eos> You guys are so made for each other.<eos> You're not suggesting that we spend all of the money on the wedding?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Look, Mon, I've been saving this money for six years and I kind of had some of it earmarked for the future, not just for a party.
No man of woman born!<eos> -Friend of yours?<eos> -Is this smelly fuck with us?<eos> It came for Bethany!<eos> Smoke that motherfucker like it ain't no thing!
They know we're here?<eos> Possibly.<eos> From the sophistication of the equipment onboard... I'd say the vessel is a command and communications module.<eos> What's it commanding?<eos> At least six other ships down near the Brown Dwarf... are communicating with it.
You can't let him...<eos> - You own the building or something?<eos> - Excuse us, sir.<eos> - What the hell's going on?<eos> - He does own it.
You're putting out clouds of pheromones.<eos> -It's not fair to read me like that.<eos> -I know. Love isn't fair.<eos> I'm reading your heart.<eos> I'm asking you to follow it.
Yeah, but I must have been more susceptible than either one of you.<eos> Otherwise, he wouldn't have chosen me, right?<eos> Right.<eos> You were the only one that was born in the house.<eos> That makes you more connected to it.
So, how did I do on that delivery?<eos> Better, definitely better.<eos> Just next time you might not wanna refer to this as the "signy thing."<eos> Oh, I know. I knew it as soon as I said it, too. What's it called, anyway?<eos> That little baby's your dicad board. Take care of it, and it'll take care of you.
Lithium.<eos> Prozac.<eos> When's it gonna end?<eos> We're trying to give a jolt to your system.<eos> Give it a little kick start.
Anyway, she was talking and then all of a sudden we went to another place, like in my mind's eye.<eos> I don't know, we went back in time to, like, 1907 or something.<eos> And we were in this room, me and her.<eos> And she was holding a baby on her breast.<eos> She was whispering to it, like, "It's okay, little baby.
It doesn't look that way from here.<eos> I'm still in command of this mission.<eos> I want to know what's going on.<eos> Very well. We were ordered by the Captain to leave this anomaly, but you chose to disobey that command.<eos> As a result of your obsession with the module, we are now trapped along with it.
Evidently we've discovered its function.<eos> A weapon of mass destruction.<eos> I understand your concerns, but the device hasn't shown itself to be hostile.<eos> Not yet, but it's only a matter of time before it puts the pieces together.<eos> All the more reason we should talk to it; explain our concerns.
Why would tonight be any different?<eos> People have been talking about you.<eos> Oh? Rumor has it you were the one who outsmarted the smart bomb.<eos> Well... not exactly. I made first contact with a sentient being.<eos> All I did was help it understand a few things.
Agreed?<eos> I am having a difficult time.<eos> I have been drinking on the funeral, just now.<eos> Don't forget the accordion.<eos> In it you will find enough, to become happy
- It's my fault, my fault!<eos> He was just eating too fast.<eos> He's gonna be just fine, you'll see.<eos> But I'll tell you something.<eos> The next time he tries to eat chop suey that fast, I'm gonna dump it on his head.
Should have it on visual any time now.<eos> Stay close and go weapons hot... but nobody fires without authorization.<eos> Keep scanning.<eos> Still nothing.<eos> We should be on top of it by now.
Is not that right?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Richard was shy.<eos> I tried to give him some confidence.<eos> Because I knew exactly how it looks in it.
- Why am I here?<eos> - Because I dragged you.<eos> Don't shush me.<eos> Let us pray.<eos> Lord, help us find the strength to turn away from evil. T o confront it when it threatens. T o see it, wherever it shall live.
As far as punishments go, this is fairly abstract.<eos> - No! It's your baby.<eos> - OK, I get it even less.<eos> It's the "sex leads to responsibility" thing, which I don't get.<eos> You gotta take care of the egg. It's a baby. Teach it Christian values.
You like your barbecue, do you?<eos> Sure.<eos> - Wanna know my secret?<eos> - Sure.<eos> First, I put the meat on the grill, then I cover it with barbecue sauce, then I cook it until it's about halfway done, flip it over, and cook it some more.
Yeah, you don't even know how to damn them.<eos> I just told you.<eos> You simply let them go through the routine of living their lives as they see fit.<eos> Until they realize their lives are unfit to live.<eos> It never ceases to amuse me how these idiots only learn to appreciate the freedom of life just when they're taking it, and just before they hit pay dirt.
Our shields are losing integrity.<eos> I'll try to get at least one phaser array back on line.<eos> Commander, one more hit and we'll be susceptible to a hull breach.<eos> That ship is larger than ours.<eos> If we lure it closer to the station, it will be far more vulnerable to the gravitational eddies than we are.
You've never felt better.<eos> Your heart is slowing.<eos> It's tired.<eos> It's too worn out to keep beating.<eos> Let it rest.
Once we've tamed him.<eos> Roll over? Play dead?<eos> - Heel?<eos> - Mm-hm.<eos> You can't teach it tricks.
- Everybody off the boat!<eos> No! Get away from that!<eos> Now you're John Hammond.<eos> - Why wasn't it tranquillised?<eos> - It was hit it with two darts of Carfentanil.
This is a fascinating story.<eos> What do we do?<eos> We' re covering it, Kevin.<eos> Brackett's interview was brilliant.<eos> Unless you want to double-team it?
Can nothing be done? !<eos> He fought for the women and the village!<eos> To simply wait for death...<eos> We cannot change our fate.<eos> But we can rise to meet it.
Cassandra is one of the great tragic visionaries of literature.<eos> The wars, the murder, the madness.<eos> She knew she was cursed.<eos> It was her fate, and she embraced it.<eos> None of us can avoid our fate, but as an artist... you can honestly face it... and fight it.
Feel like playing by the rules now? Yeah.<eos> You can use the phone as soon as it gets fixed.<eos> When will that be?<eos> Well, very soon.<eos> Provided I don't get anywhere near it.
Ensign Wildman to Neelix.<eos> Answer her!<eos> Neelix, please respond.<eos> You're being called back to your life again, Neelix.<eos> Don't turn your back on it.
Once we're safely out of Borg territory, we'll give you the nanoprobes, shake hands and part company.<eos> Insufficient.<eos> Our latest tactical projections indicate that the war will be lost by then.<eos> The nearest Borg vessel is 40 light-years away.<eos> You will reverse course and take us to it.
- (Susan Chambliss) Is it cancer?<eos> - No.<eos> Cancer grows out of control.<eos> These are anaerobic channels following the path of the central nen/ous system.<eos> They kill the surrounding tissue, depriving it of the oxygen it needs to survive.
- Is that the money?<eos> - Yeah. Yeah, that's it.<eos> What did it total out at? 2.176.<eos> That fuckin' Shelly.<eos> Gotta hand it to the guy, but, Jesus... if I were him, I would've bailed a long time ago.
You'll see I've achieved a glorious victory on your behalf.<eos> All of Islam will embrace you as its chosen leader.<eos> I am your flame.<eos> The sword of Allah.<eos> And with it I will strike deep into the heart of the infidel.
- He told me it's Bradley.<eos> - What else did he say, Dr. Dolittle?<eos> Dad, how come you haven't been hitting?<eos> How's the rib cage, Bobby?<eos> My rib cage is sick of people asking about it.
Now, here I am!<eos> Taste Central.<eos> The moment I saw you...my first impression was she's someone...<eos> See, that's what I told him.<eos> But he doesn't get it.
- I am very glad to see you.<eos> Good even, sir.<eos> But what in faith make you from Wittenberg?<eos> A truant disposition, good my lord.<eos> I would not hear your enemy say so, nor shall you do my ear that violence to make it truster of your own report against yourself.
Nay, good my lord.<eos> HAMLET:<eos> It is but foolery.<eos> But it is such a kind of gain-giving as would perhaps trouble a woman.<eos> If your mind dislike anything, obey it.
That's no job, it's an excuse to avoid reality.<eos> Think about settling down, sink your teeth into something.<eos> Something to give your life meaning.<eos> Not to work on Wall Street with this one, but how about the fire department or a cop? Something with benefits.<eos> Here's how I see it. Ever since the "hairy ass" incident you've been out of the game, you've been running away from life instead of running towards it.
All right, Peg. Let me put this into words that you'll understand.<eos> You remember your first couch?<eos> I still miss it.<eos> Well, that's how I feel about this car.<eos> Me and my dad had our best days working on it.
What is it, Quark?<eos> The Chief asked me to come up with a decaffeinated raktajino for Kira.<eos> I'm thinking of marketing it.<eos> Ugh! Oh, that's awful.<eos> Give it a chance.
What are you going to do-- shoot me?<eos> The thought has crossed my mind.<eos> well, it wouldn't get you anything.<eos> I've rigged the timeship.<eos> If you try to teleport it again, if you even go near it, Los angeles will look like the face of the moon.
- No, of course not.<eos> Well?<eos> I'll have to give this serious thought.<eos> Haven't you any pity for this child?<eos> Wouldn't you rather save it from the misery of life?
The Lord cause his light to shine on thee.<eos> The Lord lift up his countenance upon thee and give thee peace.<eos> Amen.<eos> Your heart is free.<eos> Have the courage to follow it.
Just...<eos> One last dance?<eos> Please?<eos> You're right about his chin.<eos> Sometimes I want to hit it.
A very long time ago there lived a beautiful princess, in a mystical land known as India.<eos> She was married to the handsome Prince Rama who had been banished to the enchanted forest by his jealous stepmother, Queen Kaikeyi.<eos> One day Princess Sita saw a wounded deer in the woods and she begged Rama to go and help it.
Emerge from my bosom, where you lay hiding!<eos> Hear my will, ye timorous winds!<eos> Come forth to the strife and din of tempest, to the furious clamor of raging storms!<eos> Force this dreaming sea from its sleep, waken from its depths its resentful greed!<eos> Show it the booty I offer it!
Come forth to the strife and din of tempest, to the furious clamor of raging storms!<eos> Force this dreaming sea from its sleep, waken from its depths its resentful greed!<eos> Show it the booty I offer it!<eos> Wreck this arrogant ship and let the waves devour its shattered fragments!<eos> And all that lives and draws breath on it I leave to you winds as prize!
Yeah. 26 miles, 385 yards.<eos> A messenger named Pheidippides ran that distance with the news that the Greek army was victorious over the Persians, and that was the first marathon.<eos> It was the beginning of the Olympics. Okay, so the Greeks were responsible for more than democracy.<eos> But the freeze-dried horse?<eos> Why don't we just add water and follow it back to the barn?
They are part of you. They are a part of every living being.<eos> Even Vulcans.<eos> You? The Vulcan heart was forged out of barbarism and violence.<eos> We learned to control it. But it is still part of us.<eos> To pretend it does not exist is to create an opportunity for it to escape.
We honor the Sky Spirits who led our ancestors to this sacred land.<eos> Sacred land?<eos> Yes.<eos> The Sky Spirits must have taken a wrong turn somewhere.<eos> Maybe it's a blessing to the land. For damaging it with the campfire.
You said there was still evil here.<eos> Sir!<eos> I can arrest you if I have to.<eos> The evil that is here has always been.<eos> It has gone by different names through history:
I can imagine you, mountain sick, addressing the masses.<eos> Hello...<eos> Good afternoon...<eos> Give this gringo some herbs for a session.<eos> Who's going to do it?
and the totality of these identifications produces nonsense and tyranny.<eos> Spirit has such power only to the extent<eos> that it contemplates the negative face to face.<eos> The kingdom of France!<eos> and... with it.... Ah, my homeland!
Yeah, I think so.<eos> Don't tell me they actually let you out of jail.<eos> Hey, what are you guys doing here?<eos> I took Will over to the new apartment, so he could see his room.<eos> He liked it.
But this baby represents a new beginning, a new beginning<eos> For us all, for you and for me.<eos> This is a rebirth, a fresh start for all mankind.<eos> This is my child. This is your child. This is a child of the universe.<eos> And as such, this infant represents the future, So of course, we must nurture it and permit it to grow.
A part of me is still inside that thing.<eos> I can feel it.<eos> But nobody ever believed me.<eos> Until now.<eos> This feeling, can it lead you to it?
When it's 2 a.m. And you gotta do something.<eos> Coming up next on Business Week In Review:<eos> The mark eting geniuses behind the successful media campaign for Ice Hole Beer.<eos> I'm finally on my way to fame and fortune.<eos> When this beer takes off nationally and takes Kelly with it, I'll be rich.
No, no, no.<eos> Look, Tim, we're not going to take advantage of your faith.<eos> If we need a volunteer, then... Then I'm the senior guy.<eos> You know, the shuttle is not a ship.<eos> You don't have to go down with it.
Not while half of it's mine.<eos> Well, my half is a Stinger.<eos> (Bridger) Both of you... this thing was built under the auspices of seaQuest.<eos> This is my boat.<eos> I'll give it the name.
How the hell did you find it so quickly?<eos> Undercover work.<eos> Where is it?<eos> What did you do with Pandora's Box?<eos> It's in a safe place.
You know, I'm just asking questions.<eos> You don't have to be mean.<eos> - I take it you're Sheriff Sikes?<eos> - Zeke. - How's your shoulder, Zeke?<eos> - Eh, it hurts.
Okay, get his gun.<eos> You. You get his gun.<eos> You get his. Fuck!<eos> You get the gun!<eos> Okay. Now, go. Destroy it!
Oh, thank you.<eos> It's pretty dumb.<eos> No, come on.<eos> Yeah, it is. It is.<eos> My mom believed it would ever so slightly convey my sexual prowess.
Block up the river.<eos> Chaps, wouldn't it be easier just to go through the side?<eos> See?<eos> That's the problem with an education.<eos> It gets in the way.
- Tyr, no.<eos> I will give you the same honor Father bestowed upon me.<eos> The frequency that causes the mana stone to release controlled energy.<eos> This is madness, there must be another way.<eos> Even if they have it, they would have to acquire raw material build a refinement facility.
Long have you searched for these creatures of blue.<eos> But this hat comes from somewhere new.<eos> Yes.<eos> Where?<eos> Where does it come from?
Now!<eos> Stop that, Azrael.<eos> I can't calibrate my machine with all your incessant yammering.<eos> Yes, Azrael, listen to it.<eos> It purrs like a kitten.
Oh, I'd love to say, "I'm here to fight for freedom."<eos> But honestly... I joined the reserves for the college money.<eos> I don't belong here.<eos> And I'm ashamed of that.<eos> A war story can't be true unless it's got some shame attached to it.
But, we, uh... We get the Iraqis' money, right?<eos> You don't do this shit for free.<eos> Right, sergeant Harper?<eos> See how the soil won't clot?<eos> No water means it can't form. If it can't form, it can't be fertile.
He's okay.<eos> Just don't be like that.<eos> Just don't be like that.<eos> It's not gonna be like that.<eos> Well... a rough night, but it was not for nothing.
I'll leave.<eos> I need a minute alone with him.<eos> Are you so cold-hearted... you won't allow a daughter to kiss her father goodbye?<eos> Forever can spare a minute.<eos> When this door closes, it will not open again.
Forgive my intrusion, mademoiselle... but I have come to escort you to your room.<eos> My room?<eos> - But I thought...<eos> - Oh, what?<eos> That "Once this door closes it will not open again"?
I'm a cynic.<eos> No, I'm a cynic.<eos> You're cynical.<eos> There's a difference.<eos> I never believed in the first place, but you, you wake up every morning disappointed to find the world the way it is because you're a dreamer.
Just give me the card.<eos> You did it.<eos> God.<eos> You did it.<eos> Give it to 'em.
Where's the card?<eos> - Where's the damn card? - You got it, fancy pants?<eos> - Where's the card?<eos> - Where is the card?<eos> There it is!
- Where's the damn card? - You got it, fancy pants?<eos> - Where's the card?<eos> - Where is the card?<eos> There it is!<eos> Shit, it's not here.
- Where is the card?<eos> There it is!<eos> Shit, it's not here.<eos> Oh! Come on!<eos> Man, it's all burnt up!
This is where O'Neill was right after his jailbreak.<eos> I thought it curious that when I moved, he didn't shift the barrel of his rifle to follow.<eos> That's because he wasn't aiming at me, he was aiming at the panel behind me.<eos> This is the panel to the main water filtration system.<eos> Whatever the compound is, it reacts badly with water.
Let them come to us.<eos> We struggled with the X-23s.<eos> We assumed, because they were children, we could raise them without a conscience.<eos> But you can't nurture rage.<eos> You must simply design it from scratch.
Three days.<eos> Give me cash in three days and take the stuff. Fine?<eos> 72 hours.<eos> Else, you get zilch!<eos> Keep it.
You passed out in one blow!<eos> Let's go.<eos> Musa is waiting.<eos> Man is always accompanied by an angel and the devil.<eos> Anger is evil because it's the devil's forte.
It's the code for the coordinates.<eos> We do know the flight pattern for this particular drone.<eos> Presumably the other three drones have similar modules.<eos> Programmed flight patterns but no longitude and latitude to narrow down the targets.<eos> And without those longitudes and latitudes, we have no idea where it would actually be launched from.
You got five minutes.<eos> I'm late for a meeting.<eos> So, what imaginary monster are you hunting this time?<eos> This is a satellite photo of an uncharted island in the South Pacific.<eos> It has defied discovery until now.
No reasoning, just destroy.<eos> I spent the last 30 years trying to prove the truth of what I learned that day.<eos> This planet doesn't belong to us.<eos> Ancient species owned this earth long before mankind.<eos> And if we keep our heads buried in the sand, they will take it back.
This island is just the beginning.<eos> There's more out there.<eos> What do you mean, "more"?<eos> This world never belonged to us.<eos> It belonged to them.
Anyone.<eos> Don't think anyone else is going to save him, because there isn't anyone.<eos> Anyone, anyone, anyone, anyone, anyone.<eos> I have a situation. Needs to be managed.<eos> There's only one way that I can solve it.
There's a place for people like you, the desperate, the terrified, the ones with nowhere else to run.<eos> What place?<eos> 221b Baker Street.<eos> See you in the morning.<eos> If there's a queue, join it.
- See what?<eos> What do you think?<eos> Beautiful.<eos> - You're not looking at it. - I meant your playing.<eos> Oh, the music. I never know if it's beautiful or not. Only if it's right.
Look at the violin.<eos> I need to know how you escaped.<eos> Look at the violin.<eos> It's a Stradivarius.<eos> It's a gift.
I'm gonna go outside, and I'm gonna try and get a signal.<eos> You know what? This is not Cheers after all!<eos> This is whatever the show is where one person is willing... to open themselves up to new possibility, and the other person is a jerk.... who doesn't trust anybody!<eos> It's a show that doesn't exist.<eos> That's why it would get zero ratings!
But light.<eos> Is that normal?<eos> I believe the term is "euphoria."<eos> Sorry about the quarantine.<eos> It's to protect you from us, not us from you.
I swear, I couldn't have done anything else.<eos> But that's not the point.<eos> I dealt with the problem.<eos> I just had no idea what the solution would do to me.<eos> It killed me.
But that's not the point.<eos> I dealt with the problem.<eos> I just had no idea what the solution would do to me.<eos> It killed me.<eos> And it's still killing me.
I mean, it's not real, you know?<eos> It's not how I pictured it.<eos> It's hurting my head to see it like this.<eos> Well, I'm sorry, Gardner, but the world doesn't always give you exactly what you want.<eos> It gave me you.
Everything you believe you know about Okja is a lie.<eos> Okja was created in this lab.<eos> So was her so-called mother.<eos> This is the building where Mirando experiments on their genetically mutated animals.<eos> Because genetic mutation is too dangerous, Mirando's been disguising it as natural, safe and non-GMO.
One of which is a liver.<eos> Which is a perfect match for Terence.<eos> Exactly.<eos> His liver will never go to the national list.<eos> It will go directly to your nephew.
I know it was you.<eos> Danny's always been your soft spot.<eos> You clean up pretty good.<eos> The tie might be a touch effeminate.<eos> I like it. Come on.
It isn't confidence.<eos> Doubt leads to death.<eos> Tell me the legend again.<eos> Why are you so interested in hearing it?<eos> Because it gives me courage.
I can't.<eos> you can.<eos> Just give in.<eos> and I can give it to you.<eos> and here it is.
Well... apologies are what got you into this disaster, so, yeah, officially, it's a statement.<eos> It's the first step of CIR's plan to save the company's image.<eos> But... but what about the plant?<eos> What about it?<eos> It might be making people sick.
Oh, come on. You were essential.<eos> You know...<eos> I've been thinking.<eos> For a long time, I felt your presence.<eos> It gave me this sense of comfort.
I still remember the moment when he came to me and asked for poison.<eos> He seemed very enthused by the idea.<eos> You will only gain the strength of a real Iron Fist after you have killed Harold.<eos> You must rid yourself of this anger.<eos> Danny Rand. and it will lead you to fulfill your destiny as the true Iron Fist.
I'll let it go... Forever.<eos> Fine.<eos> I wanna see the map.<eos> You guys are the best.<eos> Well, this is a map, all right. But it's not of streets.
I report on it every day, and crime rate's down.<eos> I really think that Daredevil may have made the city a safer place.<eos> He might have.<eos> But right now, the city's better off without him.<eos> Well, it's better off with Matt Murdock.
I just...<eos> You just can't help but wonder.<eos> The woman who lived in this vessel, she was lost before she came to us.<eos> She was led astray by men who were afraid of what she was, of what she was capable of doing.<eos> But destiny is a curious thing, because this vessel landed right where it belongs.
Closed door used to mean something.<eos> My apologies.<eos> In all the time we've known each other, I've never seen you like this.<eos> Your position is one of great power.<eos> But it is a burden as much as a blessing.
I did not want to stay in K'un-Lun at the time.<eos> I simply did not want to leave with you.<eos> Well, that's no surprise.<eos> Your own strength was always your singular focus.<eos> It's gotten me this far.
- Of course.<eos> Get Maggie.<eos> Tell her he's awake.<eos> All the things that I'd done... Memories... they never hurt me.<eos> But the past... it's more than memories.
I thought all these places were supposed to be the same.<eos> This is how it was when we first moved in.<eos> Management wanted to redecorate a couple of years ago,<eos> - but we liked it like it was.<eos> - That's right. This is our place and no one's gonna tell us to change it.
- What?<eos> Taste this sauce I made. It is amazing.<eos> That was really hot.<eos> Oh, sorry, should've warned you.<eos> But it's good, right?
That was really hot.<eos> Oh, sorry, should've warned you.<eos> But it's good, right?<eos> I am killing it with sauces lately.<eos> Yeah, it's good.
I'll give her the message.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - Uh, also, I think I left a jacket here?<eos> - Oh, I haven't seen one.<eos> What does it look like?
- Oh, I haven't seen one.<eos> What does it look like?<eos> Uh, it's like a letterman's jacket type thing.<eos> - Cool.<eos> - I may have left it in Mickey's room.
Thanks, hook her up, Walt.<eos> The wild mustang is an American icon and should be left wild and untamed.<eos> As the widow of a billionaire, Meredith parish is much more used to traveling in private jets or limousines, but she's not afraid to get her hands dirty.<eos> Aren't they gorgeous?<eos> Meredith owns a giant ranch across Texas and new Mexico and has turned it into a horse sanctuary.
'Cause that's all I care about.<eos> I mean, it's complicated, but I've never been happier.<eos> Hey, Mia, what's up?<eos> Did you hear about José's show?<eos> It was incredible.
Gary, could you get it, please?<eos> Please come in.<eos> - I'm not seeing it.<eos> - It's on the fridge! - No, it isn't!<eos> - It's definitely on the fridge.
Indeed there is.<eos> Get in.<eos> Drive on!<eos> A brig called the Good Hope. It is fitted out for a voyage to Constantinople and is set to leave tomorrow on the ebb.<eos> Is it yet loaded? No.
Drive on!<eos> A brig called the Good Hope. It is fitted out for a voyage to Constantinople and is set to leave tomorrow on the ebb.<eos> Is it yet loaded? No.<eos> Draw up papers to have it diverted.<eos> Have it rowed to Wapping Wall by a skeleton crew. It's to be tied up, with only provisions onboard. Enough for a crew of 15 for a... two-month journey.
I'm an old man, I would never survive.<eos> Tell me that's the reason.<eos> Brace, you were not born for freedom.<eos> You wouldn't know what to do with it.<eos> It would torture you.
Hello?<eos> Forgive me, the door was open.<eos> I just received a note.<eos> Mr Delaney said he had left his account of the sinking of the Cornwallis and the account of the East India clerk, Godfrey.<eos> It said I would find it in his room.
Where's James?<eos> How the hell should I know?<eos> Brace... what's the matter?<eos> I thought he'd burned that damned trunk on the foreshore along with everything else.<eos> It would float.
Cholera.<eos> Cholera?<eos> Where's this cholera now?<eos> Hendon Road.<eos> It's coming down the Fleet and Kilburn Rivers.
He sold you out, cos you cut off his thumb, or you cut off his thumb, cos you knew he was going to sell you out.<eos> Possibility one: reason.<eos> Possibility two:<eos> witchcraft.<eos> Leave this body where it will be found.
Yeah, it's flash time.<eos> Never willing to send his troops anywhere he wouldn't go himself.<eos> He was known variously as the Lion King, the G-Man, Big Glen and, most commonly, the Glenimal.<eos> He was like a throwback to another era.<eos> His hand was bent into a permanent claw, like it was still clutching a World War II cigar his modern, fitness-fanatic self wouldn't allow him to smoke.
It's a lost cause.<eos> This whole province constitutes just 4% of the population of the country.<eos> It's strategically meaningless.<eos> I'd cut Helmand loose, sir.<eos> The thing about counterinsurgency is that it doesn't really work.
Religion.<eos> See?<eos> We can't write about anything actually affecting us.<eos> Last week, you vetoed my story about the stranger danger sessions the school keeps holding.<eos> Because it's a direct criticism of the administration's policies.
♪ Then I'll be happily happy ♪<eos> ♪ Yes, happily happy... ♪<eos> How well did you sweep the stage?<eos> I'm dancing barefoot.<eos> It's clean.
Nice turnout.<eos> Told you I got my peeps.<eos> Custodial staffs love me, just FYI.<eos> We are very proud to have Salem County's Crimson Tides lead us today in the Pledge of Allegiance.<eos> I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the republic, for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice...
We're really gonna do this?<eos> Trust him?<eos> You got a better idea?<eos> I've got an idea.<eos> It may not be better. But at least it's not him.
Are you a widow?<eos> - Hey!<eos> - One second!<eos> - Turn down the music!<eos> - Please turn it down.
Everything that's known about the tape is in there.<eos> It'll be more of a help to you than I can be.<eos> A man never quite measures up to his work.<eos> The images on the tape, they were her story.<eos> She wanted it to be heard.
Awful young to be here.<eos> Don't let it kill you.<eos> Excuse me, sir!<eos> Could you tell me a little bit more about the church?<eos> When did it close?
Rose?<eos> What is your purpose, Chris?<eos> What?<eos> In life, what is your purpose?<eos> Right now, it's finding those keys.
I'm asking you what do know about a slaughtered lynch mob?<eos> I don't know what the fuck you speak of.<eos> I was merely passing the time as instinct indicated while you were paying your last respects to your dearly departed.<eos> How was the funeral?<eos> It's over.
Do you believe in a soul?<eos> If not, close your eyes.<eos> Great.<eos> Let's just say a soul does exist. Where in the body do you think it'd be?<eos> I think if there's a soul, it would belong in the brain.
- You've been wonderful.<eos> - Why are you talking to me like this?<eos> - I've been wonderful.<eos> If I've been wonderful, then why are you telling your peers about the device, and particularly...<eos> why are you saying it failed?
Julia: You look tired.<eos> Studying for the exam.<eos> Oh, yeah?<eos> How's that going? It's going.<eos> Did you know in the state of Connecticut, for a pickle to be considered a pickle, it must bounce?
So, yeah, I'm happy with what I'm doing, but eventually I want to direct and produce films. And basically push the boundaries of what's out there at the moment technology-wise.<eos> I'm doing a bit with 360 video work at the moment, just testing and stuff.<eos> And hopefully, I think, that's got a lot of prospect.<eos> But, yeah, porn's one of them worlds, man.<eos> It's ever-evolving and, you know, all the new technologies are always found, and some come and some go.
See, I've heard so many stories about me now that I don't know which one is the most popular.<eos> But I do know which is the least popular.<eos> The truth.<eos> See, the truth isn't always the most exciting version of things, or the best or the worst.<eos> It's somewhere in between.
But I do know which is the least popular.<eos> The truth.<eos> See, the truth isn't always the most exciting version of things, or the best or the worst.<eos> It's somewhere in between.<eos> But it deserves to be heard and remembered.
Ultravox?<eos> Duran... Duran?<eos> Yeah, sure. Good stuff, man.<eos> I do more jazz myself, but music is all good.<eos> It gets you through the day.
If one thing is unique, the other six things should probably be, um... - ... something else.<eos> - What's wrong with unique?<eos> If something's unique, it means it's different, right?<eos> I'm saying this type of literature is different than other kinds of literature.<eos> I mean, it is.
Aren't you supposed to get on the mic and say things like,<eos> "Hey, Liberty High, let's keep it tight!"<eos> I'm a legit deejay, not a birthday clown.<eos> Those aren't the only options.<eos> You see the world as binary. It's a mosaic.
Jensen, that's enough.<eos> But no one wants to admit it, so they paint over the bathrooms and put up a memorial, because that's the kind of school that this is.<eos> Everyone is just so nice until they drive you to kill yourself.<eos> And sooner or later, the truth will come out.<eos> It's gonna come out.
I get that.<eos> But with her parents bringing a lawsuit, it's too sensitive right now.<eos> That's unfair.<eos> I built this magazine out of nothing.<eos> It's the focal point of my college apps.
She wasn't, though.<eos> She wasn't. Clay, your question about the assault... that have to do with Hannah?<eos> No.<eos> Not really.<eos> Even if a crime can't be prosecuted, it shouldn't stay a secret.
I couldn't.<eos> I know it was guilt I was feeling.<eos> And anger.<eos> I think lots of anger.<eos> Anger at the whole fucking world and the way it works.
And it's all about you... Clay.<eos> How in the hell am I supposed to listen to this?<eos> I think the asshole answer is you put the headphones on, the cassette tape in, and you press play.<eos> That is the asshole answer, isn't it?<eos> Yeah, but it's true.
Yeah.<eos> You're right.<eos> It's worth a try.<eos> Oh, shit, I was supposed to take the bank deposit in today.<eos> It's due. It's due this afternoon.
You know.<eos> If this one starts, I'll siphon some gas.<eos> I just got to find... There's an empty water bottle.<eos> I thought this was the one, but...<eos> Like it?
For this.<eos> Rosita.<eos> Get into position.<eos> I'll signal you. And the wall's gonna hold?<eos> It'll hold.
On behalf of the people of the great state... Of California... the president of the United States.<eos> This valley and others like it across the country...<eos> Where we can see the greenest and most richest earth... Producing the greatest and richest crops in the country.<eos> And then a mile away, see the same earth...<eos> And see it brown and dusty and useless... And all because there's water in one place... And there isn't in another.
I guess you can call what I do reporting.<eos> Okay. Well, this is what you should be reporting on.<eos> What, the drought making people crazy?<eos> Well, the drought is horrible.<eos> Never thought it'd last this long... But now it's only part of the problem.
You're in your house shoes.<eos> - Good call.<eos> - You ever think about how they never put the morgue on the top floor of a hospital?<eos> I notice stuff like that. It's always in the basement.<eos> It's like its own elevator.
a loser.<eos> So what else could she be?<eos> Just then Grandfather came out.<eos> He was angry because Peter had gone into the meadow.<eos> It's a dangerous place.
I am. You can't give me what was mine from the start.<eos> Okay.<eos> No, that's...<eos> Take it.<eos> It's yours.
How's that story, the Ghost of Christmas Past?<eos> I...<eos> You came back for a reason, I'm thinking.<eos> The gun.<eos> It's there on the counter.
I...<eos> You came back for a reason, I'm thinking.<eos> The gun.<eos> It's there on the counter.<eos> Pick it up, your gun.
Well, it has your name on it.<eos> Look, this is my last day, so...<eos> Are you working a case involving Emmit Stussy or Stussy Lots Ltd?<eos> How did you get this number?<eos> Again, it was on the note you sent.
It's perfectly natural.<eos> You see it all the time in the wild.<eos> The smaller animal going limp in the jaws of the larger.<eos> Genetic instinct.<eos> At some level, food knows it's food.
You're talking about it like it's apples and oranges.<eos> It's not apples and oranges, okay?<eos> It's reality and fantasy.<eos> So that's how the world works!<eos> It's either real or it's fantasy?
Just the Murphy girls.<eos> Hey, did you give Pernell my cell phone number?<eos> No.<eos> Well, he left a message for you.<eos> It's sweet.
He talked to me.<eos> He told me. He told me where your capsule is.<eos> What did the coach say?<eos> Hold on a second.<eos> Where is it?
He told me. He told me where your capsule is.<eos> What did the coach say?<eos> Hold on a second.<eos> Where is it?<eos> - Just tell me where it is.
I want my capsule back!<eos> There's some old dude making some crazy noise.<eos> I'm not leaving till I get it! Do you hear me?<eos> Man, he's gonna get himself shot.<eos> I know it's in there!
You ready to dive back in? Yes.<eos> We are back and personal with Judge Pernell Harris and his luminous wife.<eos> And I have to thank you, Crystal, for allowing us a peek at this garden.<eos> Well, any time.<eos> Judge Harris, your story is no secret to the city of San Vicente, and it's a pretty tragic one.
That was a parting gift.<eos> Stolen the night Jocelyn was raped.<eos> Crys.<eos> Anne's place is empty.<eos> It was cleaned out.
We will only defeat our enemies if we scrub ourselves clean, both physically and morally.<eos> OK, hand it out.<eos> - Yes, sir!<eos> - Make good use of this soap.<eos> And make it last. Is that clear?
- Yes.<eos> And when you're not giving killing lessons?<eos> I studied law. I wanted to be a lawyer.<eos> I see you're from a good family.<eos> This desert is bigger than it looks.
If he ran, they'd have to pay the court $18,000.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Where'd you get this clock?<eos> I don't remember.<eos> It was Daddy's.
Well, for the last several years, I've been thinking about the summers I spent here.<eos> You remember what it was like... that green, that shade of green.<eos> It was the most beautiful thing I'd ever seen.<eos> And the tire swing.<eos> It used to break every summer, and every summer Grandpa would fix it.
Not even close.<eos> Even if he was, when did we start arresting people for crimes they might commit?<eos> Somewhere between 9/11 and Orlando.<eos> Is that also when we started fabricating evidence and obstructing justice? Look...<eos> I don't know where you got that tape, but it ain't gonna hold up.
Sorry.<eos> No, no, it's fine.<eos> Let's get business out of the way before we order.<eos> Tell me.<eos> This question with Iran, it could get me stuck in the starting blocks.
Really?<eos> You fucked up by coming here.<eos> Fuck you, man.<eos> I got your drawing.<eos> It's so good.
So I'm asking you one last thing.<eos> Find out about Nafisi.<eos> Get me the real answer.<eos> Because the truth does matter.<eos> I will make it matter.
- I can't say.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Pretty much had to come from NSA.<eos> Unless the CIA has some monitoring program I don't know about.<eos> Answer me! Where did it come from?
Holy shit.<eos> Holy shit.<eos> Obviously I had no idea what was coming next.<eos> I mean, the explosion, I still don't believe it.<eos> But because the recording got Sekou released, it's important evidence in the bombing investigation.
But because the recording got Sekou released, it's important evidence in the bombing investigation.<eos> Now, I've told the FBI<eos> I wouldn't say where I got it, and I won't, but...<eos> - It wasn't from me.<eos> - Well, right. But... The problem is, they know it must have come from the NSA.
I did have a gun, but I was not asleep.<eos> That's not what her daughter said.<eos> Was the gun loaded, Ms. Mathison?<eos> Answer the question.<eos> Yes, it was.
Are you accusing these men of lying?<eos> Yes, I am.<eos> Either they're confused or they've been suborned.<eos> What about the footage?<eos> Is it lying?
Yes, I am.<eos> Either they're confused or they've been suborned.<eos> What about the footage?<eos> Is it lying?<eos> Why does it end there, on a shot of my son running away?
You know why I produced the video?<eos> To destroy the memory of my son, to hurt me, and to damage my presidency.<eos> No, no, and no.<eos> I produced the video because some people-- people you call cowards, though every one of them's a veteran-- came to me with a story of injustice.<eos> No one believed them because it involved a powerful person with an even more powerful mother.
- Right.<eos> - Organizing his exercises around, say, Stephen's favorite movie.<eos> Right.<eos> So this exercise is a comprehensive indication of where Stephen is on his road to recovery.<eos> It involves recall, motor skills, and sequencing functions.
I'll do fucking junior work, work that wouldn't have crossed my desk when I was your age... When I ran a company at your age, not a fucking division...<eos> Because I cared. And I was good because I cared.<eos> And you?<eos> You just don't seem to, son.<eos> And the roster for the trial squad comes out on Monday. Don't bother looking at it, Lakeman.
Sigefrid, leave him, he's just a priest.<eos> Come on, brother, we have Scots to kill.<eos> Erik!<eos> The city, we leave in your hands.<eos> It's ours, it must remain ours. I will ensure it.
Violet Baudelaire was the eldest Baudelaire child.<eos> She was 14 years old, right-handed, had a real knack for inventing and building unusual devices.<eos> I'm having a problem with the grandfather clock.<eos> Can you show me what the specific issues are?<eos> See? It toasts the bread, but the minute hand falls behind five minutes.
"To invite people to dine with us is to make ourselves responsible for their well-being as long as they are under our roofs."<eos> But he was an 18th century philosopher and gourmand... and these were three children with very little catering experience.<eos> Nevertheless, the Baudelaire orphans snapped into action.<eos> This pasta maker reminds me of the one built by Thomas Jefferson.<eos> Will it work?
No, the combo is a mashup of the girls' birthdays.<eos> No way I'd forget that.<eos> Well, maybe you just got the sequence...<eos> I did not forget!<eos> Maybe it got reset by accident.
He fires off a shot at us. What the fuck?<eos> You know?<eos> Just one. I mean, it didn't come anywhere near us. I don't think he intended to, but still.<eos> Anyway, he takes one look at Lonnie and practically shits himself.<eos> I mean, he tosses away the gun like it was on fire.
No!<eos> Nana?<eos> What's happening?<eos> What's wrong?<eos> Nana, I can't get the door open. It's shut!
"Not self but country."<eos> This a career crisis we're trying to drown here?<eos> I signed up when I was 19.<eos> Same as all the other hotheads.<eos> Thought I'd go whup ass, bring justice to a place that needed it, you know?
The capsule will miss us.<eos> Just.<eos> - Rory?<eos> - I'm still downrange.<eos> And it's coming in shallow.
More carbon dioxide.<eos> And then, when Sho's ready, a growth medium.<eos> In this case, glucose.<eos> Come on, dance.<eos> Did it just move?
And get a distress call out.<eos> Control, this is Station.<eos> Station for Control.<eos> The specimen's location is unknown.<eos> It is to be considered hostile and deadly.
- Rainbow bridge?<eos> Like where family pets go when they die?<eos> - No.<eos> I mean, not that I know of.<eos> No, it's called that because of the flowers that are everywhere. - Um, but there is, of course, no map, but I know Martin found it with a spell.
Hi, how are you?<eos> Good. You? Good.<eos> Can I taste that lasagna?<eos> No, ate all of it.<eos> Was it good?
- I'm sending you our coordinates.<eos> What the fuck is going on?<eos> Alterplex cares. We understand.<eos> The future of mankind is not out there.<eos> It is in here. And we have found a solution.
You will be carrying this box.<eos> The box will counterbalance any instabilities that might occur in the echo.<eos> Instabilities?<eos> Very simple.<eos> It plugs right into the echo tower.
You okay?<eos> Shit!<eos> This way, this way!<eos> We've got a drone!<eos> It spotted us!
The group's leader, Hugo Romein, in an interview this morning ensured that his movement will be monitoring the situation closely.<eos> Expressing grave concerns about the tower initiation he went on to vow that his group would take action at the first sign of trouble although he did not say what form that action would take.<eos> Will stay with me.<eos> Stay with me!<eos> We gotta pull it out, okay?
Now you tell me what is Redivider.<eos> It's a classified protocol.<eos> A last resort.<eos> When restoring balance is impossible the box disables one side altogether.<eos> It destroys the tower.
Will!<eos> Traitor.<eos> - We got Porter.<eos> - What about the box?<eos> Is it safe?
There's nothing hopeless in having to live.<eos> Think of the lives these people had, the loves they shared.<eos> How could any of it be in vain when it's all so miraculous?<eos> Oh, in the end, I guess we're just humans, drunk on the idea that love can fix everything.<eos> Because it can.
There appears to a sliver of fused vertebra attached, but what doesn't make sense...<eos> Is that the sliver is connected at a near 90 degree angle.<eos> Oh, I know what happened.<eos> The lower half of the body is not missing.<eos> It's still attached to a living person.
I know how to find Kovac.<eos> Forget about the evidence!<eos> I have to get you somewhere safe.<eos> The door!<eos> It's closing!
I meant the motorcycle bar, but yes.<eos> The Maluku Islands, as well.<eos> I remember the day each of you was hired.<eos> I remember the name of every victim I've ever identified.<eos> I remember... just how meaningful this work can be, but I... I don't remember how... to do it.
Let me know if you need anything.<eos> Will do.<eos> Why are you holding a plant? Oh.<eos> Uh, it's for the new office.<eos> You like it?
I love Working Girl so fucking much.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Han Solo looks great in a suit.<eos> Even after all these years, human beings are still the same.<eos> Everybody talks about evolution, but nobody talks about how long it takes.
It appears to be a postmortem tubercle fracture.<eos> You are correct.<eos> But tubercle fractures are not caused by objects striking the bone.<eos> They are created by forceful impact upon landing.<eos> Maybe the body was thrown into the trunk of a car when it was being transported.
Hmm? That's not a nest.<eos> Oh, man.<eos> Give me that.<eos> Okay, Ian's body was dumped in an oak tree grove right here.<eos> So how did it end up covered in sycamore sap if the only sycamore trees are nearly a mile away?
Oh, what a shocker.<eos> We have a lawyer here. Who represents Goodlife Chemicals.<eos> All these precautions-- the Hazmat suits, the decontamination foam, it misrepresents that these chemicals are hazardous.<eos> Nonsense.<eos> Sulfuric acid is not only hazardous, it is highly corrosive.
I don't think time of day is really the issue.<eos> Dr. Hodgins, if you're done making sophomoric puns, I need your help extricating the remains.<eos> Pretty fresh.<eos> Do we have any idea what happened?<eos> Not a clue, except the farmer that was operating this thing didn't see the body until it was folded end over end, - then spit out of this baler.
Okay, so of the 15 unsolved bank robberies committed last week, I couldn't find any where gunfire was exchanged, but I did find one involving a car crash.<eos> Uh, Bendsville<eos> Savings and Loan-- the bank is located ten miles from where the body was found.<eos> Now, you see the mask?<eos> It matches the one found on our victim.
Now, correct me if I'm wrong, but Dr. Addy's assertion is that he didn't murder anyone, but that the previous apprentice killed the lobbyist.<eos> That's right, yes. And then Gormogon killed the apprentice to make room for Zack.<eos> Killed him on the exact same night as the lobbyist, no less.<eos> Wait, hold on a second, your-your gray cells are getting me a little lost here. Well...<eos> in order to exonerate Dr. Addy, we need to find the previous apprentice and examine his body for whatever evidence it may yield up.
And I don't even know why.<eos> I just...<eos> I just can't. Yeah, that's bullshit.<eos> That voice that says you can't.<eos> Every time you hear that voice, I want you to tell it to fuck off.
The first spanking, when your heart went on a journey all alone.<eos> When they called you 'crybaby' or 'poor' or 'fatty' or 'crazy'... and made you into an alien... "you drank their acid and you concealed it."<eos> "Later, if you faced the death of bombs and bullets..." you did not do it with a banner.<eos> You did it with only a hat to cover your heart.<eos> You did not fondle the weakness inside you though it was there.
- Do you have a wife?<eos> - Do you have kids?<eos> - No. So, what's your damage?<eos> Short version, my work.<eos> It takes up all my time, and I... I like it that way.
and certainly cancer, they don't think that way.<eos> People have bad lifestyles that they've inherited.<eos> Environmentally, they've been exposed to a certain way of eating and living that they've carried on into their adulthood, passed onto their children, that is why they go on to develop the same diseases that their parents and grandparents may have had before them.<eos> But it is not inevitable.<eos> Even if you have a genetic predisposition, doesn't mean it's going to necessarily manifest.

I went to the headquarters of the Center for Food Safety, the nation's leading FDA government watchdog group to see how concerned we need to be about drugs in our food.<eos> So, that we know of, there are at least 450 different drugs that are administered to animals, either alone or, in combination.<eos> These drugs are given to animals for a variety of reasons, very, very few of which are actually beneficial to consumer health.<eos> We've got drug companies that work real hard to make sure they can sell lots of drugs to people raising cows, pigs, and chickens.<eos> The pharmaceutical industry sells 80% of all the antibiotics that it makes in the United States to animal agriculture.
Big Tobacco has paid $400 billion to state Medicaid programs.<eos> Cheeseburger laws proponents say,<eos> "We don't want to see the same kind of thing happen "to the meat and dairy industries."<eos> The fact that these laws are based on a model template called a Commonsense Consumption Act is actually ironic because what they're saying is you, the consumer, should have the common sense to know that our food is bad for you.<eos> I've often typified the meat industry to people who maybe don't understand its power and reach, as it's got all the money of Big Tobacco and Big Pharma, and it has the personality of the National Rifle Association.
- I would... I would have to figure out...<eos> - Yep.<eos> - How long that'll take me. - Right.<eos> Go to 11.<eos> Found it.
You think you'd want to make it, like, warm or something.<eos> You said on the phone it was urgent.<eos> My friend Drew said her mom came, and you're like some miracle worker, so...<eos> I'm not a miracle worker.<eos> Therapy's a serious commitment, and it begins with communication.
We made hay.<eos> And our body of work has been presented.<eos> Are you ready to take this to the next level?<eos> Yeah!<eos> All thanks to synergy, for it provides us with low-hanging fruit.
Yeah, well, you didn't know it was gonna poison everyone.<eos> The city died because of me.<eos> So they can think I'm the Messiah for all I care.<eos> Once it gives them hope, it keeps them going.<eos> Mercedes, you can't keep carrying that burden. It'll crush you.
And I'm hearing they're fixing to come back and finish what they started.<eos> But they don't know your face.<eos> Now, you could sneak into their camp, shut down their power source, then I could stop them for good.<eos> Undercover work.<eos> You up for it?
Allow me.<eos> You know, they say a nice watch band is as important as the watch.<eos> That's what I get for cheaping out.<eos> We'll find it for you.<eos> Where the heck is it?
Lifted half a finger? I portaled to freakin' India. And had to face off with a cobra!<eos> And all I got was this stupid box of hers!<eos> This stupid box is sacred.<eos> You know why?<eos> It contains Camille's grave dirt.
Okay, the sangria may have been too strong.<eos> She just tried to kill me, Magnus.<eos> This will help.<eos> She just threw an ax at my head.<eos> Okay, it's stuck in the shelf, right there.
They respect you.<eos> What exactly is your plan?<eos> Clary.<eos> She'll know it's a trap.<eos> Even the sly mouse will walk into a trap If it wants the cheese badly enough.
There's a good chance she's there.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Azazel did this.<eos> Izzy's necklace.<eos> It's broken.
Shot of tequila. Double.<eos> Uh, make that two.<eos> Her shots are on me.<eos> Hey, Kaelie, long time.<eos> Man, rejection is so much more fun when it's happening to you.
Wait!<eos> -Son of a bitch! -[Jace grunts]<eos> I said stop!<eos> You want a Downworld revolt?<eos> This is how it starts.
I just made it all up.<eos> The spear is the MacGuffin.<eos> The what?<eos> The thing in the movie that everyone's trying to get.<eos> - Well, where is it?
The spear is the MacGuffin.<eos> The what?<eos> The thing in the movie that everyone's trying to get.<eos> - Well, where is it?<eos> - In the movie? It... It's in pieces.
You didn't want me to know that you didn't want me.<eos> No, you're right, I...<eos> I didn't want children.<eos> But if there's one thing my travels aboard the Waverider have taught me, it's that time often doesn't provide us with what we want.<eos> But it... it's quite adept at giving us what we need.
What makes me so interesting? Agh!<eos> You wear the hood of one of my students...<eos> Yao fei gulong.<eos> You get my text about John?<eos> If there is any trace of the file that dig needs, it's gonna be buried behind some serious firewalls.
But I'm heading up to Palo Alto.<eos> Got a meeting with an investor I think is going to help me out with this new app I've got.<eos> Oh, okay.<eos> What's the... what's the idea?<eos> It's like Uber, but better.
Jesus.<eos> AA.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> So tell me about your app, Dad.<eos> Well... it's called the R Car.
Did you read that article about this island up north that's, like, basically where World War III is gonna start?<eos> - Let's assume we haven't. - Oh!<eos> Oh, my God. It's amazing, 'cause the...<eos> Well, you know, the polar ice caps are melting, so now these, like, new islands are kind of forming up in the North Pole.<eos> So there's this island and everybody's fighting over, like, whose island is it, you know?
So you're not just giving me the file for John.<eos> Got what we need to exonerate John.<eos> - How'd you do that?<eos> - Long story. Pleased to meet you.<eos> I know exactly how this brotherhood works, and right now, it works for me.
Prometheus has you so fixated on what's wrong with you that you've completely stopped seeing what's right.<eos> You know, John and Felicity, they'll listen to you because you have more to offer than just this.<eos> Your past is a part of you. There is nothing you can do about that.<eos> You can't change it.<eos> It doesn't mean it has to be your anchor.
Those were exact words actually.<eos> Ok. You need to get out of here.<eos> And he said those would be your exact words.<eos> - The bomb is in countdown mode.<eos> - What? ! It's wired with a failsafe.
You just want to think that.<eos> No.<eos> That's what I know.<eos> 'Cause if I had my gun, my wife would still be alive.<eos> Here you go. I don't know if it's still good.
- About?<eos> - An exclusive.<eos> Can we set up the meeting tomorrow.<eos> I'm late for a dinner.<eos> The thing is is that this story, it's important.
This laptop contains 40 million rubles worth of bank transfers from Kovar that Gregor hasn't disclosed.<eos> This is most disappointing.<eos> I liked many of you.<eos> Prometheus surprised me with a very specific, unique move.<eos> It was taught to me by a woman that I met in Russia.
I serve at the pleasure of the Mayor.<eos> There you are.<eos> Viktor has confirmed Gregor's location, but tell me, why did you want him gone and why are you playing Robin Hood?<eos> I met a woman.<eos> She taught me how to give my darkness an identity so that it doesn't consume me.
I hurt her!<eos> What do you mean, you hurt her?<eos> I was reheating some soup for her.<eos> It was just about all I could make her...<eos> And it was on the stove, and I pass out drunk.
- Ok.<eos> Turning.<eos> You want to see what else they can do?<eos> Next one goes in his head.<eos> Then it will have to go through me.
I told you it's more complicated when you're sitting on the other side of the--<eos> What the hell is more complicated?<eos> You're holding someone with no lawyer, no trial, no justice.<eos> And the world is safer for it.<eos> It could be safer... But it's not better.
Your guilt...<eos> Oliver, no!<eos> Your bloodlust... Your inhumanity.<eos> Ah, that gun.<eos> It only has one bullet.
Yeah, that doesn't really make so much sense.<eos> I mean, after everything she did?<eos> No offense.<eos> Maybe this has something to do with the stick.<eos> Maybe your soul is not as dark as it used to be.
I have to go sort all this out with Simon.<eos> I know it's none of my business, but after what you guys just went through, maybe you should give Simon some time.<eos> No.<eos> No, I can't let him think that what happened at the Seelie Court is how I really feel.<eos> Clary, Seelie magic might trick you, but it's always true.
Don't give her an excuse to give Aldertree his old job back.<eos> Well, I appreciate the help.<eos> But don't you think this makes up for what you did to mom.<eos> Alec... your mother and I have always had a complicated relationship.<eos> It's not complicated.
Then who does?<eos> Oh, I bet you'd love to get your hands on your precious Soul Sword now.<eos> Well, you're in luck.<eos> I'm gonna be sending it with you.<eos> Considering my Demon Blood, it didn't seem wise to leave such a powerful weapon just lying around, even if it is deactivated...
Jonathan... not a day goes by that I don't think about you. Where I am not haunted by that decision I made. To send you to Edom.<eos> I have always dreamed of creating the ultimate warrior, and now... that dream is a reality.<eos> You have always been my greatest creation, son.<eos> Always!<eos> I haven't been to this cabin in years, but I'm pretty sure it's just past this hill.
I have always dreamed of creating the ultimate warrior, and now... that dream is a reality.<eos> You have always been my greatest creation, son.<eos> Always!<eos> I haven't been to this cabin in years, but I'm pretty sure it's just past this hill.<eos> There it is!
Right... friends.<eos> Where is the mirror?<eos> I don't care what you do.<eos> I promised Jocelyn.<eos> Loyalty. An admirable trait. Until it gets you killed.
That's what makes him uneven, of course.<eos> Now you on the other hand, with coaching, you could be terrific.<eos> Do you really think so?<eos> - Yes, you have a definite nose.<eos> - I'm glad you like it.
I went to bed every night in a world full of magic where anything was possible.<eos> And then one day you find out that Santa's not real, and then the Tooth Fairy isn't real.<eos> And there's no farm upstate for old dogs.<eos> Then I started reading history books, and Jesus isn't real.<eos> And it's like everything that made the world anything more than what it is is just... is just stories.
When you die, you rot.<eos> I love you, puppy.<eos> It's not always gonna be tails.<eos> It had been a hard journey east across the land bridge from Siberia.<eos> Freezing and dark, and it had taken a bitter toll.
What present?<eos> My coin.<eos> Yeah, I know someone looking for that coin.<eos> Well, they can't have it.<eos> It's mine now.
- They could.<eos> If they don't, you could sacrifice yourself.<eos> You've done it before.<eos> And the world opened to me.<eos> It has since closed.
Um, so this character... your character... uh, was he able to change his future?<eos> More specifically, if he allowed certain events to occur naturally, was he only cementing the very timeline that resulted in a horrible event later?<eos> There were two schools of thought.<eos> One faction... one group of fans... they believed, you know, the future's ever-changing.<eos> You know, it's not fixed, and so you could make of the future anything you wish.
Yeah, challenge me.<eos> Barry, you need my help.<eos> Your shoulder is still broken.<eos> It's okay.<eos> It's almost healed.
The Founder's Day parade.<eos> They ring the charter bell every year.<eos> It's a replica.<eos> The real one went over something called Wickery Bridge in 1992.<eos> Anyway, I have spent the last three weeks sending people into that river to look for that bell, and they haven't found a thing... but I know it still exists, because it can't be destroyed.
- Why?<eos> Wickery Bridge is where Elena's parents drove the car off the road.<eos> When the sheriffs dredged out the car, they found something else...<eos> The old charter bell.<eos> It was broken, but they saved it.
Seline's there, too.<eos> She has the tuning fork.<eos> They're forcing Ethan to add it to the bell.<eos> When my master, Cade, learned of your bell's ability to drive us from your lands, he devised an altogether different purpose for it.<eos> What will it do?
One.<eos> Two.<eos> Three.<eos> The bell has been corrupted!<eos> It will destroy us all!
Come on.<eos> Grab your blindfold and your headphones.<eos> Sybil sure loved to hear herself talk.<eos> But... in all that blathering, she did mention that she had an insurance policy against Cade.<eos> I'm betting this is it.
Worst possible place to bring a siphon.<eos> Like, easily, the worst.<eos> there's practically... magic in the walls.<eos> See?<eos> Okay, it's, uh, it's not practically in the walls.
Throat ripped out, ear-to-ear.<eos> Well, good morning to you, too. Read it.<eos> The guy was a-a known drug dealer with enemies.<eos> His throat wasn't ripped out.<eos> It was slit with a knife.
Please.<eos> Okay.<eos> Seriously.<eos> Ramsey dragged him back... to her den.<eos> Well, it's empty.
- Nice work, Eileen. - Thank you.<eos> So this chick with her, that, pat benatar wannabe?<eos> It must be dagon, I guess. Yeah.<eos> Awesome. Okay, so... So...<eos> Kelly and dagon go crash this place, and then it gets torched. Coincidence?
No, we won't.<eos> We're not gonna hit dirt for three days.<eos> Two if we're lucky.<eos> I know you feel it -- the air, it's thin.<eos> And it's getting thinner.
You get me in?<eos> You?<eos> Perhaps.<eos> But I need my rig.<eos> Where is it?
Okay.<eos> Thank you. Okay, stop, Frankie.<eos> I'm good.<eos> Thanks again for the soup.<eos> It was delicious.
Thank you. Okay, stop, Frankie.<eos> I'm good.<eos> Thanks again for the soup.<eos> It was delicious.<eos> You're welcome, even though you don't deserve it.
This is a very complicated case.<eos> It would take a formidable legal scholar to solve it.<eos> May I have a blackboard, please?<eos> In the respected legal tome, Nuptial Law, John Locke's 1690s groundbreaking work is cited, postulating that the law of the land rests on the...<eos> As you can well imagine, Klaus' legal argument had all the apocryphal insight of Thurgood Marshall and the moral aplomb of Ida B. Wells, a phrase which here means it was thoroughly impressive and utterly convincing.
And so, as Martin Luther King said,<eos> "Morality cannot be legislated, but behavior can be regulated.<eos> Judicial decrees may not change the heart... [both] but they can restrain the heartless."<eos> That moral argument had all the apocryphal insight of Thurgood Marshall and the moral aplomb of Ida B. Wells.<eos> It was thoroughly impressive and utterly convincing.
This is the Reptile Room.<eos> Feel free to explore.<eos> Here is the lizard wing... - and here... is a winged lizard. - [lizard chittering]<eos> Now, see his yellow-striped belly, a sign of camouflage and cowardice.<eos> Can it really fly?
Hey.<eos> You know, I remember when I first fell in love with her.<eos> Every second I couldn't be with her killed me. Her love is different.<eos> It's... it's nuanced.<eos> It's rich.
- What?<eos> - Your partner.<eos> I don't know what you're...<eos> Come on, you're running a fiddle con with the watch.<eos> I'm just wondering who got to spook Ben, say it's worth 50 grand?
I'm going. Okay?<eos> I'm going.<eos> But I need that bag.<eos> - Mm-mmm. - I am dead without it.<eos> So where is it?
Aids was not identified properly until 1981.<eos> HIV wasn't known as the cause until '83.<eos> These things take time to unravel, even for doctors.<eos> Would you say that your illness affects your ability to think clearly? No.<eos> It affects me physically. It causes me great pain.
And in three, she'll have latched he to some other girl to destroy.<eos> Good morning, students.<eos> This is your principal speaking.<eos> There have been many inquiries about the upcoming pep rally.<eos> So let me state clearly, it is happening, as scheduled.
Thank you, Principal Weatherbee.<eos> It is heartening to see so many of you here, even in weather like this.<eos> But a lack of heart and school spirit has never been the Riverdale way.<eos> Tonight's pep rally isn't like any other we've had in the past.<eos> And we shouldn't pretend that it is.
Fine. But you have to own it.<eos> Own what?<eos> Okay, if I had a football game tomorrow night, would you stop me from going?<eos> No, because football you understand.<eos> You respect. But my music, since I told you about it, you don't care.
"Jennifer Gibson"? Who the hell is Jennifer Gibson?<eos> That's not the only thing.<eos> Oh, God.<eos> Please don't tell me you're still on this crazy witch hunt.<eos> It's not a witch hunt, and it's not crazy.
Follow me...<eos> Jughead.<eos> Another fun fact about fear.<eos> Sometimes it grows up with you.<eos> Or it curls up inside of you, tightens around your guts.
Congratulations, Mr. Andrews.<eos> Looks like you won.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Here's the thing about fear.<eos> It's always there.
Are you ready to roll, Jugs?<eos> See you tomorrow.<eos> I'm sorry, Ms. Lodge, but your card's been declined.<eos> Really?<eos> And let me guess, it's been reported stolen.
Dad?<eos> What is it?<eos> You always make me talk to you about my problems.<eos> The business...<eos> It's in trouble, Archie.
And the way things are going, pretty soon, the Coopers, we're not gonna exist anymore.<eos> And there's nothing I can do to stop that.<eos> Betty, don't do that.<eos> Don't give up.<eos> Your family is definitely splintering right now, but it won't fall apart, because of you.
My dad hired Jughead's dad to trash the drive-in.<eos> And given recent events, it's not inconceivable that he might've hired him to do other jobs.<eos> Like go after Jason as payback for what the Blossoms did to him.<eos> I want to help with your investigation.<eos> I want the truth. Whatever it is.
Hey, will you get the milk out?<eos> One cup coming up.<eos> That rhymes.<eos> I'm a poet.<eos> Okay, pour it in, And I'll start the mixer.
One cup coming up.<eos> That rhymes.<eos> I'm a poet.<eos> Okay, pour it in, And I'll start the mixer.<eos> Here it comes.
I see.<eos> Well, he was supposed to meet me, and... I'm just getting a little worried because he wouldn't answer his cell phone.<eos> And I want to go check on him to make sure he's okay, but I don't know his actual address.<eos> So I was wondering if you could give it to me from the registry?<eos> It's not in the registry.
- Thanks.<eos> I'm pretty sure you saved my life.<eos> - That was my goal.<eos> - I know I had a gun with me.<eos> Where is it?
did she kill herself?<eos> - No.<eos> - And you know who did kill her?<eos> Or you think you do?<eos> - I just--i need my damn gun, so just make it show up by the time I'm strong enough to leave here.
Oh, I've never been much of an Edna. And no one would call me a saint.<eos> Well, I've read all your poetry.<eos> I'm sure I'm one of your biggest fans.<eos> "My candle burns at both ends;<eos> "It will not last the night;
But... it still feels like...<eos> I'm being... pulled underwater... with no way to get to the surface.<eos> I know it can seem hard.<eos> But look at this list.<eos> It's not that big.
So what wisdom will you be sharing on your vlog today?<eos> "How to apply false lashes."<eos> Do you think I'm a bad person?<eos> Because you made a difficult decision?<eos> It wasn't difficult for me.
Good plan.<eos> And I, Consuela Rivas, take this man, Phillip Hawthorne, to be my husband.<eos> "Love is patient.<eos> Love is kind.<eos> It does not envy. It does not boast.
Yeah.<eos> Something like that.<eos> Um, take care of Zig for me, okay?<eos> "Love does not delight in evil, but rejoices with the truth.<eos> It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres."
Yeah? Do you need help with something?<eos> This firm has been dissolved, unfortunately.<eos> I'm sorry?<eos> The firm.<eos> It no longer exists, okay?
- Sorry, Mom.<eos> - Hi, Mrs. Powers.<eos> How was work?<eos> Long. This kid swallowed a battery.<eos> It came out, thank God, without too much damage to his insides.
Then what does it matter if I'm bisexual?<eos> Why do I need a special spot?<eos> You don't, but it's the one that exists, and you qualify for it.<eos> Your voice is underrepresented.<eos> It deserves to be heard so it can help people.
- are you seriously suggesting that... - No, I just...<eos> I don't know.<eos> I just can't do this anymore.<eos> So I don't even get a say when it comes to my own relationship?<eos> Not when it gets in the way of my health.
How bad is it?<eos> Suppose I'll find out this evening.<eos> Where will you go?<eos> I surrendered to this sickness the moment I first saw it.<eos> I knew it would kill me or I'd kill myself before it could.
They will be outnumbered.<eos> They will have less armor and fewer weapons.<eos> But my sister's armies fight for her out of fear.<eos> The Unsullied will be fighting for something greater.<eos> They will be fighting for freedom and the person who gave it to them.
What the hell is an ambulance doing here?<eos> The park is closed.<eos> You think it's for our guy?<eos> Let's find out.<eos> It's locked.
Something about Pete.<eos> Look, Carly, I've had a hell of a day, so whatever it is, it's just going to have to wait, okay?<eos> Come on.<eos> Just put it on. Vince wants you in uniform.<eos> I just need to see how it fits. Come on.
We all do.<eos> Now listen, I'm working with Marius.<eos> We're going to take Vince down.<eos> You okay? How's your hand?<eos> It's still bleeding.
Well, if it can give you some peace of mind, there's a great crime prevention class for seniors down at the community center.<eos> Great. Can I sleep there?<eos> Oh, thank you for your advice. We're fine.<eos> Okay. I just have one more question.<eos> Do you own a firearm, and if so, was it stolen?
Oh, thank you for your advice. We're fine.<eos> Okay. I just have one more question.<eos> Do you own a firearm, and if so, was it stolen?<eos> No.<eos> No, you don't own a firearm or no, it wasn't stolen?
- Thank you.<eos> - So, you have a gun, right?<eos> - Oh, yeah.<eos> Stolen?<eos> No. It's in a safe upstairs.
Tired of beach living.<eos> I want to know how this works.<eos> Well, you go over the wall.<eos> There's a low point where the wall cuts through the mountains.<eos> It's only about 150 feet high there.
Security is my responsibility, and I was handling the situation.<eos> Yeah.<eos> You clearly had it under control.<eos> One of the reasons they sent me here was to lower the prisoner attrition rate.<eos> If it doesn't fall, maybe I'll explain your methods to them.
What?<eos> Open up.<eos> I'm coming.<eos> Open it!<eos> New arrivals just left, they must have locked it on their way out.
And I'm betting they know where this one is.<eos> You ever meet the psycho? Running around all pregnant.<eos> No. Never seen her.<eos> I'm realising, you don't know how far we're willing to go to bring all these clones in.<eos> You better embrace this new future, Art, 'cause it's gonna be here real soon.
What are you doing?<eos> Fixing the vase.<eos> You can't fix that.<eos> "Justitia in suo cuique Tribuendo cernitur."<eos> "One recognizes justice therein, That it renders to each his due."
- PTSD?<eos> - Cults work to control your mind, and your mind has been controlled for a long time.<eos> - Right, right, right.<eos> - I spoke with a colleague who gave me information about a support group.<eos> It's for people who have been victims of mind control.
Own it, pumpkin.<eos> The Monarchy.<eos> So we are not the first Brakebills students to get into Fillory or to assume the throne.<eos> It's a great question for history class, but if The Beast gets to the Wellspring right now and sucks it bone-dry, magic dies in Fillory.<eos> - It dies there...

And my dear, I assure you... ♪ I believe ♪<eos> ♪ That since my life began ♪ ♪ The most I've had is just ♪ ♪ A talent to amuse ♪<eos> ♪ If love were all ♪<eos> Uh, wait, the cottage was here, right?<eos> It's not invisible, it's just... not.
- Mm-hmm. - There's a lot at stake.<eos> Which I told you would be the case someday, hmm.<eos> Well, welcome to someday.<eos> No one but you can be within 20 feet of the blast.<eos> It will kill anyone, including your Beast.
That is the second set of my car keys that disappeared down that sewer grate.<eos> I didn't drop this set, you did.<eos> Yeah, because you screamed, "He's after you!"<eos> Because I thought I saw a bat.<eos> And had it been a bat, which I realize now it was not, it would have been rabid, and you'd be thanking me for saving your life.
Does anyone remember this quill choreography?<eos> - I do!<eos> - Thank God.<eos> Show us, please, Steve.<eos> It's, uh, very simple.
I'm sorry to get you out here this late for a brain glitch.<eos> Don't worry about it.<eos> I'll just do a quick examination.<eos> Let's have a look at that tongue.<eos> It's a little coated.
Those initials wouldn't work in any other language!<eos> - People don't generally bring that up.<eos> - It looks like a phone box.<eos> Yes, well, that's the cloaking device.<eos> It sort of hides itself.
- People don't generally bring that up.<eos> - It looks like a phone box.<eos> Yes, well, that's the cloaking device.<eos> It sort of hides itself.<eos> It's hidden itself as a box with "pull to enter" on the front?
Or do you think that your bacon sandwich loves you back?<eos> So what is it and what was it doing on Earth?<eos> Well, there were scorch marks on the concrete where we found it.<eos> Could have been left by a shuttle craft.<eos> The puddle, what did it look like?
You might wanna rethink that if you're gonna use that as your defense.<eos> When Auggie turns 19, he will do something terrible.<eos> What?<eos> His parents' marriage will continue to fall apart.<eos> It will become violent.
Monroe, can you move?<eos> Camera got knocked over.<eos> They had to have come from behind the dresser.<eos> Check behind it.<eos> It's hollow.
Camera got knocked over.<eos> They had to have come from behind the dresser.<eos> Check behind it.<eos> It's hollow.<eos> Looks like it's attached to the wall.
Why do you want to be an operator?<eos> You want me to say it's the greatest job in the world.<eos> But we both know I'd be lying.<eos> Your job is much better.<eos> But, unfortunately, I'm told it isn't available.
There you are.<eos> Let's talk.<eos> Aah! - You hate marriage.<eos> - When did I say that? !<eos> You always said it was stupid and pointless.
It was just that kind of thing, you know?<eos> He'd do something, and then I'd do something in response and so on.<eos> A friendship like that?<eos> I don't how to describe it.<eos> - Was it legendary?
Guys!<eos> Cancellation. I repeat, cancellation.<eos> I need the Uribe and Hernandez party at their places now.<eos> You know what? You were right about marriage.<eos> It's stupid.
I assume by "fresh start,"<eos> you mean you want me to do something to help Mike Ross now that he's out in the world.<eos> Anita, you heard his speech to that jury.<eos> He was given a gift and he threw it away.<eos> And the reason it was so effective is 'cause he meant it.
Sell it somewhere else, Harvey.<eos> Because I'm done.<eos> Now I know why school ends at 3:00.<eos> Why's that?<eos> 'Cause if it went till 6:00, no teacher would ever come back again.
You always talk like we're your only family.<eos> You need to go make things right with your mother.<eos> Mike, what are you doing here?<eos> I thought school started at 7:00.<eos> It does.
I just didn't have it in me to have it out with you. It's okay, Marcus.<eos> She got to you, didn't she?<eos> I'm sad about Dad.<eos> And, yeah, she pulled on that string, but one speech doesn't make up for everything.<eos> Maybe it doesn't.
You would find your way back to sadness, no matter how far you run from it.<eos> Well, that's comforting.<eos> Is there nothing else you desire?<eos> Everything I've ever wanted, I've got.<eos> Magic is real, and it can fix anything except what I need.
- Really?<eos> Everything I've learned about you today says otherwise.<eos> Do you like my hair?<eos> Uh, no.<eos> It's terrible, actually.
Do you like my hair?<eos> Uh, no.<eos> It's terrible, actually.<eos> Looks like a janitor cleaned out a locker room shower and then just dumped it right on your head.<eos> It doesn't frame your face at all.
- Listen, I know what this is about.<eos> You know...<eos> I was silly to think that keeping that note from you would kill the electricity that we have.<eos> If it can survive the socially unacceptable age difference, - then...<eos> Yeah, it can survive anything.
What up, Hoss?<eos> A while back, someone at this address bought a leather jacket from me.<eos> Had a parrot on the collar.<eos> Yeah.<eos> It belongs to the old ball and chain.
I've had 24 in the past year.<eos> I've been real busy.<eos> I think I'm done with art.<eos> Or rather, art is done with me.<eos> It has spoken.
Hey, you.<eos> Under the stairs.<eos> Hidden away like the family embarrassment.<eos> I like your artwork.<eos> It's useless and impractical.
I mean, Bob Mackie meets, I don't know, Jesus' orgasm.<eos> Old-school Gucci, you know?<eos> So, definitely handmade - by some badass Italian broads. - Yeah.<eos> You should see my apartment.<eos> It is completely unrecognizable.
He had the workers comp case.<eos> I took care of that.<eos> Mike, your job isn't to generate cases.<eos> It's to consult on the cases we've already taken.<eos> I know that, but it's also to help our associates become better lawyers.
And I got a feeling when you do, you'll drop this case by the morning.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - Hey.<eos> You ran out of the presentation so quickly, I didn't get to ask what you thought.<eos> I had to get to class, but I thought it went great.
Then, please, Marcel.<eos> If some part of you still cares about me, help me.<eos> For the sake of all we've been to one another, for all that we've shared, I am begging you to let my brother go.<eos> And if I say no?<eos> You know better than anyone that my family always gets what it wants.
But don't you think Hope deserves her father?<eos> Hey.<eos> Look at me.<eos> Yes, history could repeat itself.<eos> If you're not careful, it will.
No.<eos> Too bad.<eos> Because if you're not gonna be my friend, then you're... fucked.<eos> I killed the fly.<eos> It was a worthy adversary.
I am now.<eos> Get Riley and the others to medbay and tell them we'll take them to their villages in the morning.<eos> Where is it?<eos> We didn't get the machine.<eos> It didn't survive landing? No.
Get Riley and the others to medbay and tell them we'll take them to their villages in the morning.<eos> Where is it?<eos> We didn't get the machine.<eos> It didn't survive landing? No.<eos> It did, but I had a choice... bring the machine home or use it to save them.
I knew the risks that came with using powerful autonomous machinery.<eos> I knew the dangers and... and you thought I was one of them.<eos> You didn't want that technology to fall under the control of a director you didn't know.<eos> No, I did not.<eos> But now it's completely out of control, and for that, I am sorry.
Seems they look up to you, too... the hero of Vienna.<eos> Not as big a deal as they made it.<eos> They gave me too much credit.<eos> No, a true hero's not in it for the glory.<eos> Some seek out justice in the face of danger even if it means living life in the shadows.
I've been inside your brain.<eos> I know what you want, or, rather... whom.<eos> See? You do know.<eos> I've seen the closeness between you.<eos> It's always been there, but you've been resisting that, too.
She got pregnant, and we were happy.<eos> But... When hope was born, it was, uh...<eos> It was touch and go...<eos> And she only lived for four days.<eos> Her story was over before it ever started.
That guy hits really hard.<eos> Do you have any, uh, any, like, cyanide or ...<eos> - Cyanide?<eos> Why would I ... - Or, like, a paper bag.<eos> You put it over my head, you suffocate me really quick.
- software programming you to die.<eos> - Maybe.<eos> But I have something you will never have ... a soul... that will continue long after I'm gone.<eos> How can you be so sure I don't have one?<eos> If a soul doesn't come from your flesh and blood or my ones and zeroes, then it has to come from somewhere else, somewhere unrelated to our physical bodies.
well, the complete opposite of yours, so I've been working to refine the compound, grow it ...<eos> Superior ...<eos> The chemical in this pure form is harmless to humans.<eos> If you're a potential Inhuman, however...<eos> - it will turn you.
There's no excusing that.<eos> All right, pay attention.<eos> What is that?<eos> It's a high-pitch frequency caused by Shockley's cellular vibration.<eos> The ramping up of his kinetic energy at an atomic level, and once it reaches a critical threshold, that massive energy transforms his body from a solid to a flammable gaseous state and then ...
What if he never knew me?<eos> What if he can't remember?<eos> This...<eos> This reality is flawless.<eos> - It lures you in.
How'd the security breach come to your attention?<eos> His co-worker spotted him hiding some contraband in his locker... a camera.<eos> Was there any film in it?<eos> No. No film.<eos> It was an antique, actually.
Guess it's time to see what the big man can do. No, not him.<eos> Why not?<eos> Because he shouldn't go.<eos> I'll go in his place.<eos> I thought this world didn't mean anything to you, - that it wasn't real.
Why not?<eos> Because he shouldn't go.<eos> I'll go in his place.<eos> I thought this world didn't mean anything to you, - that it wasn't real.<eos> - It's not.
It means...<eos> You know what? I'm not gonna go there.<eos> Just -- just keep moving.<eos> The resistance must have a base of operation.<eos> Where is it?
This is quantum-energy manipulation.<eos> Darkhold tech.<eos> Dark-who now?<eos> Simmons: I've seen this machinery before.<eos> It was designed to build elements from thin air.
Simmons: I've seen this machinery before.<eos> It was designed to build elements from thin air.<eos> This -- this looks like it's creating something even more complex.<eos> That machine required an immense amount of energy.<eos> It was powered by a hydroelectric dam.
Do you think i don't know who you are?<eos> Where you're from?<eos> You come from that other world, just like them.<eos> You're just as tainted.<eos> You want to talk about that "other world," as you call it?
It's a lot to process, that it's not real.<eos> Fake news, Hydra's alternative history...<eos> That's just the tip of the iceberg.<eos> What's that supposed to mean?<eos> What if I told you this whole world isn't real, that it's just a simulation meant to keep us imprisoned?
You don't understand.<eos> Aida...<eos> Madame Hydra has put forces into motion no army can protect him from.<eos> Is this something to do with this... machine that Leopold was working on?<eos> It will kill everyone Fitz cares about.
- Have you seen that show?<eos> - What? Have you seen the show MythBusters?<eos> - No.<eos> Is it good?<eos> - It is.
A storage area?<eos> In Osaka.<eos> What about a soul that doesn't match?<eos> It's like organ donation.<eos> The body would reject, say, a kidney if it wasn't the right type.
I don't want to forget this.<eos> Fuck.<eos> A rose is a rose, except here.<eos> Here it has to mean something.<eos> It's beautiful.
Good morning, boys and girls.<eos> Who's ready to tear Watson Industries a new asshole?<eos> That's what I like to see.<eos> Now, on your desks, I've made each of you a copy of my initial brief.<eos> Cling to it as if you wrote it yourself, and if any of you need to go to the bathroom, I suggest you do it now, because for the next two weeks, we are not leaving this room.
So. The world's ending, huh?<eos> Mm-hmm. Why?<eos> What makes you say that?<eos> Common sense. Science.<eos> The world's been ending since it started.
If I let myself fall in too far, I won't ever get out.<eos> I've been banished to my room.<eos> Thirteen days so far.<eos> My door is unlocked.<eos> It doesn't even close all the way.
So we disagree.<eos> So who are you planning on eating, Loki?<eos> 'Cause you are killing people, right?<eos> - It's not all just singin' and dancin'.<eos> - I made a deal with my old gang. They let me go, and if they need to get rid of a body they leave it in my van in the Magic Mountain parking lot.
Rachel, whatever you're doing, you need to put it down and start looking for every single instance where a person was admitted to the Bar and the vote wasn't unanimous.<eos> Mike, what's going on?<eos> Anita Gibbs got herself onto the board.<eos> Then what we should be doing is finding a way to get her kicked off.<eos> Harvey's working on it. But in the meantime, I need to know the ins and outs of this committee, because while she's on it, she's gonna use every dirty trick in the book to end this thing before it gets started.
- That's right.<eos> And I want to know why I heard about it from her and not you.<eos> I'll tell you why. Because I didn't know.<eos> But now that I do, this thing is done.<eos> - The hell it is.
Julius, I work at a law clinic, but not as a lawyer.<eos> An opportunity presented itself for me to become one and I turned it down, but then I had to sit there and watch a woman get put on the street because I couldn't help her.<eos> And I knew I'd have to watch that happen over and over and over.<eos> So when that opportunity presented itself for the second time, I took it.<eos> Because I knew it would never come along again.
Mike, I told you I'd get it done.<eos> I'll get it done.<eos> Anything? No.<eos> It's the same as when you called an hour ago.<eos> If he killed someone and hid the body, nobody knows where it is.
How exciting.<eos> Speak for yourself.<eos> Come on, man, who doesn't like the future?<eos> I like history.<eos> Yeah, I know, it's filled with terror and violence,
We are Camelot!<eos> We are Camelot!<eos> We are Camelot!<eos> The dark army approaches.<eos> It's reached the great wood.
About time.<eos> You know what that power makes me?<eos> A bad guy?<eos> Evil?<eos> It makes me a god.
- You flatter me.<eos> - I only wrote the truth.<eos> I'm learning to keep digging even when all the evidence points one way. There's always another side.<eos> Even when it's hard to find.<eos> Especially when it's hard to find.
The DEO and Supergirl won't be able to stop us this time.<eos> So, what you're telling me is that Jeremiah Danvers, former DEO agent and Alex and Kara's long lost father has returned from Cadmus custody with news that our enemy has developed a nuclear fusion explosive using Kara's other-worldly heat vision radiation, and that they're going to drop that on National City and just kill us all?<eos> Ha! Is... Is this...<eos> Is this place bomb-proof? You could run a trace on Kara's heat vision radiation signature.<eos> Right, yeah well, if the bomb is armed, then yes, I might be able to pinpoint its location before it goes off.
Uh, no.<eos> Nothing. Is it possible they could have developed some sort of cloaking device?<eos> No, no. They would have needed me to build it for them.<eos> Keep scanning.<eos> It'll come online eventually.
Of course, of course I am.<eos> Or have you been distracted by Kryptonians in capes since you fled Daxam?<eos> How did you find me?<eos> We heard your beacon.<eos> The transmission was incomplete, it brought us to this galaxy.
So am I.<eos> Under two hours.<eos> The clock is ticking fast.<eos> I know.<eos> And if it ticks down completely, we both lose.
It was like something was in control of him.<eos> Do you think the same thing happened to his mother, too?<eos> Maybe she's not the perpetrator we thought, but the victim.<eos> Just like Marcus. Either way, we'll need to keep him in that cell for now.<eos> It's equipped with a telekinetic dampener, which should prevent him from having another episode.
We need to get somewhere safe.<eos> Welcome to New Daxam.<eos> Leave us.<eos> How's the invasion progressing?<eos> Is it as much fun as you hoped?
I can't get it to play.<eos> I know it works.<eos> I've played it before.<eos> Edie, she still has this manual.<eos> It's sort of classic Edie when you think about it, keeping this filed away.
I just wanted to say thanks.<eos> You're good at your job, Noelle.<eos> You don't need me to tell you that but... Is this the stuff from Eric's van?<eos> The guitar wasn't in there.<eos> It wasn't at his house either.
Preventing further acts of terrorism is just about all that matters, Tanya.<eos> Now, I do realize with these heightened threats comes an additional strain on the governors of your states.<eos> So... I say to each and every one of you... tell me how we can help.<eos> Putting aside the very real moral questions, how is shutting down the borders even feasible?<eos> I know this policy is going to hurt some people, but let me explain why it's necessary.
I mean, what do you think?<eos> -About what?<eos> -About the president's rush to war.<eos> At least half the Beltway seems to think it's outrageous.<eos> It is outrageous.
Your testimony can't be private.<eos> -I'm sorry to hear that.<eos> -Just wanted to let you know.<eos> What's a "flash blood warning"?<eos> It's coming up on everybody's phones.
Why are we sitting on an air mattress?<eos> There's nowhere else to sit.<eos> They were supposed to get this place outfitted.<eos> Yeah.<eos> It would look better outfitted.
And why the sudden melancholy?<eos> Did you expect to break out of the Chambre de Chasse and into a family cured of dysfunction?<eos> When we were in there, it felt like the world had stopped.<eos> But it didn't.<eos> It kept turning.
Back from what?<eos> From him.<eos> From the vampires.<eos> For five years we kept quiet.<eos> Watching you lord over this city like it was yours.
Also, because... mission accomplished.<eos> Do you really think that weapon could kill Marcel?<eos> It took some time, my blood, Esther's magic,<eos> Marcel's venom and the ashes of Lucien Castle.<eos> Combined, it will be powerful enough to kill him.
Inspired, perhaps, by duty to the familial bond.<eos> I've been inside Klaus' mind.<eos> You care for one another so deeply.<eos> It's quite ludicrous, this dedication to one's own blood.<eos> After all, look where it got you.
Previously on The Originals...<eos> This blade is imbued with dark magic.<eos> It will cause unending agony. Glad you showed up.
I don't think I have a choice.<eos> Well, you've outdone yourself.<eos> I'm inclined to agree.<eos> It's such a shame these lovely linens will soon be red with blood.<eos> Violence must only be seen as a last resort, or it will only weaken our position.
The Ancestors are gone. We need a new strategy.<eos> To keep the Hollow at bay.<eos> We blew up the link that allows 'em to access this world, but if there's a shred of Davina left over there, then... she can accept the sacrifice and restore the link.<eos> Do you really think that weapon can kill Marcel?<eos> It will be powerful enough to kill him.
Is it so hot? Oh!<eos> But at least you're not being boiled alive!<eos> You don't think I've been trying to get rid of this guy, too?<eos> I've been fishing around that same file.<eos> That's why it was in my office.
Maybe we should change them after we dump him?<eos> Yeah! Let's wear bedsheet togas and trip again.<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> And maybe we'll find the gun that way.<eos> 'Cause we'll go, like, full circle and remember where we put it.
- Is there Scotland in space?<eos> They're all over the place, demanding independence from every planet they land on.<eos> Why are you here?<eos> Because I figured out why you keep your box as a phone box.<eos> I told you, it's stuck.
- Basically.<eos> Well...<eos> - you're not from the Fairford Club.<eos> - The creature in the river.<eos> - Where did it come from?
- you're not from the Fairford Club.<eos> - The creature in the river.<eos> - Where did it come from?<eos> - Who the devil are you people?<eos> - Where did it come from?
- Where did it come from?<eos> - Who the devil are you people?<eos> - Where did it come from?<eos> - Nowhere!<eos> It's always been there.
You did.<eos> You gave the order... boss.<eos> Sir...<eos> Give me a coin.<eos> We'll toss for it.
- Yeah, I'm ready.<eos> You're about to win the award for best playwright ever of all time.<eos> Really?<eos> I don't even know they made that award.<eos> Well, they just made it for you.
No, you may not.<eos> Consider it done, sir.<eos> - Call off the missile. - Call...<eos> It's already been launched!<eos> - Then redirect it.
- A little intense, wasn't it?<eos> Well, he had it coming with all the showboating.<eos> Yeah, I guess he did.<eos> Hey. I know that you started this charity.<eos> It's gonna do a lot of good.
Snape was a Slytherin.<eos> It turned out he had that selfless love.<eos> I did have a snake once.<eos> A Burmese python named Krueger.<eos> Technically, it was Cal's, but Krueger liked me best.
They must've been a gift from someone with very expensive taste.<eos> Expensive taste and a soul made of old fingernail clippings.<eos> Mmm... 'kay. If memory serves, we were talking about reinstating the GED program.<eos> The issue being the presence of an existing education initiative.<eos> They called it education so they don't have to pay the inmates.
And... and it used to, before, you could... you could find somebody to talk to if you wanted, you know?<eos> Or... or cookie's up their sleeve, and...<eos> Now it's, "Fuck you, inmate.<eos> I'mma fuckin' ruin your life just because I can."<eos> It's like human niceness has just gone renegade, and I don't think it's coming back anytime soon.
Because we won.<eos> We fought back and we won.<eos> And you are a blind cow.<eos> And you are a...<eos> I lost my humanity in the dirt here for a while... but it's slowly coming back.
- I mean it.<eos> - Okay. Jeez.<eos> I want to know everything you're doing here with the Hairies.<eos> Extreme adaptive ability is wired into the Hairy DNA.<eos> It's the source of their power.
Excellent.<eos> Ah, you hear that, boy?<eos> It's killing me.<eos> Means the past is reaching out to you, trying to show you something.<eos> It's tied to this land, boy... and connecting to it will make you stronger.
- Good what?<eos> You, Ruth Langmore, just committed an overt act.<eos> Wh-What the fuck's that?<eos> See this camera?<eos> It sees you.
I've come to buy your strip club.<eos> Your titty bar.<eos> And they let you in, why?<eos> Because I offered to post your bail.<eos> It was steep, too, with the pandering and endangering a minor, not once, but five times.
- Mm-mm. Mine.<eos> I looked at our inventory and I felt that it was lacking.<eos> Don't get your thong in a bunch.<eos> Competition's good for you.<eos> It builds character.
Oh, I have a... I have a church.<eos> You... you have a boat.<eos> And before that, a sidewalk in St. Louis.<eos> A church is not a building.<eos> But it can be... if you build it right.
- You did?<eos> Yeah, a couple things, actually.<eos> Um, you see here...<eos> Uh, this column right here.<eos> You know, first look at it, it looks tip-top, right?
- Yeah, you know, I know. I know.<eos> I know it was.<eos> And your statement has so many useful details, you know?<eos> Specific.<eos> It was really helpful to me.
You must have told me that story 500 times.<eos> I'm not good at making up shit.<eos> I know.<eos> I remembered that today.<eos> If your story is true, you should tell it.
Yeah. - We- - It was good.<eos> - Okay, cool.<eos> Because I got us a lead on this really cute little one-bed in Venice.<eos> Here, I got the address. We can look at it later.<eos> - It's not even on the market yet.
Investigating, looking for leads.<eos> Did you find Detective Diaz's gun at the scene?<eos> No, ma'am.<eos> Are you sure?<eos> Did you look everywhere for it?
Did you find Detective Diaz's gun at the scene?<eos> No, ma'am.<eos> Are you sure?<eos> Did you look everywhere for it?<eos> It was not in its holster.
No, ma'am.<eos> Are you sure?<eos> Did you look everywhere for it?<eos> It was not in its holster.<eos> Was it under the bed?
Was it under the bed?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> - Did you check under the bed?<eos> - No, ma'am.<eos> - Was it in the bathroom?
Hurry it's getting thicker.<eos> What the hell?<eos> You ready?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Let's hope it works, it was the only one in the store.
- What is it?<eos> - What do you see?<eos> It's another body.<eos> Another one?<eos> The drone... it's stuck.
It isn't happening.<eos> This isn't happening.<eos> Look. Calm down.<eos> Everything's going to be all right.<eos> It won't lift.
Run for it?<eos> There.<eos> Okay.<eos> Now fingers crossed the battery still has enough juice.<eos> It has juice!
I don't want you to fucking call her as a witness.<eos> Marx will just chew you alive.<eos> The circumstances of your firing completely discredit your testimony.<eos> - What?<eos> - It's useless now.
Come on, Benny.<eos> I only gave you one job!<eos> Dude, they weren't open, man.<eos> So I kind of just came on down to the church, and the ceremony kind of just started, man.<eos> - No, no, it didn't.
Oh, my God.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> Yeah, baby, I'm fine.<eos> I just really wanted your wedding day to be perfect.<eos> It will be, once you're in it.
I found... you.<eos> You are my sympathy... my better self... my good angel.<eos> I am bound to you... with a strong attachment.<eos> I think you're... good... gifted... lovely.<eos> A fervent... a solemn passion, conceived in my heart... and it leans to you and draws you to my center.
Say what you want, but we brought back weapons and a plan.<eos> What do you have to show for yourself?<eos> Ta... fucking... da.<eos> Your royal accoutrement.<eos> This is ceremony, people, and I expect you to slather yourselves in it.
So it was already armour-plated, amphibious, massively powerful, six-wheel drive and four-wheel steering.<eos> And what I've gone and done is improve it.<eos> It's got a honeycombed lattice work of ceramic-steel armour plating.<eos> It's three times thicker than the armour you'll find on the turret of an Abrams A1M1 tank.<eos> In testing, I fired a 7.62 round at that hull, and all it left was a mark like that one.
Vehicle spotted in the open.<eos> 45 stand by to engage target.<eos> 45 stood to engage target.<eos> This shell... is twice as powerful as the shell we fired from the tank.<eos> And it can hit a target 13 miles away.
You've got this pillar here, then the wheel here, and there isn't enough of a... of a gap between the two.<eos> Hang on a minute. Hang on.<eos> How Alfa Romeo is that?<eos> They put the door in the wrong place. It should be...<eos> It should be further back.
No, he is not! He is not.<eos> No may?<eos> No, and there wouldn't be, because I was in another part of the port with my own travel plans.<eos> Last night, after the other two had gone to bed, I arranged for our company yacht to be waiting for me in the harbour.<eos> And there it is!
So that, you know, it's sad your old car's gone, but now... you know, a donkey can be rescued.<eos> And your car lives on in the smile of an abandoned donkey.<eos> That's a beautiful thing.<eos> That's what we're about.<eos> - That's what this show is, it's all heart.
The moth is a good friend of mine.<eos> And how is that possible?<eos> We met in my garden the other day.<eos> She landed on my hand.<eos> Will you care to explain to us what it was doing here, then?
What do you think it came for?<eos> A forest ranger I knew years ago told me about a mother brown bear who gave birth to three cubs.<eos> The rangers stayed nearby to keep an eye on them and make sure the cubs were safe from other predators, but they were shocked when the mother killed the first two cubs.<eos> They intervened and took the last baby, a male.<eos> Why did it do that?
Troy was out there harvesting fuel, protecting his men.<eos> I heard his side of it.<eos> Want to hear ours?<eos> We're, uh, building a new nation here.<eos> It's not perfect.
You get bunkered in, just laying around watching TV.<eos> And the very second the sun starts shining, there's some kind of euphoria in people.<eos> And in some way, you have to go out, you have to do stuff outside.<eos> You have to take the opportunity to experience the sun, the warmth, for as long as you have it.<eos> You have to fill up on sunlight, so that you have the memory of it for the rest of the year.
Even if the recipe is the same, it's the hand of the one who makes it that matters in the end.<eos> Everybody's hand has its own taste, and as such, you get different results.<eos> The motherland is one of the most valuable things there is.<eos> It's your parents, it's your kids, it's one of the very, very best things you have.<eos> It is irreplaceable.
Or that I could continue my trade here, my life here.<eos> For sure, it has lots of spices, too many to name.<eos> You must learn the spices you work with.<eos> Nobody in the camp knows the mixture that I make.<eos> I am the first to use this mixture, it's very tasty.

It's my whole family, my father.<eos> Vernon?<eos> Sit down.<eos> My dad doesn't think we're safe.<eos> He helped make this place, and he doesn't think it's safe.
All I've ever had in my... my whole life is this... this place and...<eos> These people, and...<eos> I don't know, it just...<eos> I don't understand, you know.<eos> Like, the world out there, it's...
Walker values these relics.<eos> It's a trailer full of rocks and beads and bullshit.<eos> You scared, Jeremiah?<eos> Better be careful, son.<eos> You may not like my hospitality, but I guarantee you you'll find it better than theirs.
I didn't outlive Phil and Russell and two good women to die like some rabbit with no resistance.<eos> Walker has us surrounded with firepower.<eos> If you don't do this, you lose the ranch.<eos> Well... the ranch wasn't meant to shelter cowards scared of a few Indians.<eos> No, it was meant to be your legacy.
I was just telling Mark how much I miss having Marshall around.<eos> Well, he's still around.<eos> Where are you going?<eos> I forgot my bag.<eos> It's right here.
- Okay, girl.<eos> Yes.<eos> Hey, nice app, Reggie.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Glad you like it.
Help us now.<eos> It adorns the crypt of the first Commander,<eos> Bekka Pramheda.<eos> Where is the crypt?<eos> You think it's the bunker?

It's a key card to the building where the shots came from.<eos> That's conspiracy to kill the president. That's the death penalty.<eos> Now, I want to believe that you have good reasons for all of this, but if you don't tell me what they are, I can't help you walk out of here.<eos> I'm offering you a lifeline, Hannah.<eos> Take it.
- Okay. You're falling into professor mode again.<eos> Carol from Philadelphia doesn't give a damn about academic surveys.<eos> She cares that she has to take two buses to find an affordable grocery store.<eos> And she wants to know that you care about that, too.<eos> I do, which is why I was referencing this study, because it shows that with specific zoning laws and small-business incentives, local grocers can...
Yes, ma'am. Okay, do we have anyone who can propose amendments?<eos> Because this bill has loopholes you could fly a plane through.<eos> Mr. President, we're trying to figure out how to handle - this development with Bowman.<eos> - I just read the bill.<eos> I can see why it didn't get out of committee.
She's the head of the Republican Party, and you're a card-carrying Democrat.<eos> I'm looking to redefine the playing field.<eos> Senator Bowman, you and I have very different opinions on gun safety.<eos> I will be re-introducing Bill 8180, which strengthens federal background checks.<eos> I happen to oppose this bill, but in the spirit of bipartisan discussion, I'd like to put it before the Senate.
Obviously, we're counting on the support of the Democrats in the Senate on SB8180.<eos> And given your previous record as Attorney General of the great state of Massachusetts, I'm trusting that I can count on you as an ally.<eos> I am proud to say that Massachusetts has some of the strongest gun regulations in the country.<eos> Of course, I'd like to see universal background checks as the law of the land.<eos> I understand that this bill might not go as far as you want, but I believe that it starts the ball rolling in the right direction.
If we want to get any of those things done in this Congress, we need a united Republican front.<eos> You're not helping with this stunt.<eos> No, you're right.<eos> This is bigger than background checks.<eos> And I'm not interested in a united front if it means compromising my values.
Because I think you're doing the right thing, sir.<eos> Thank you very much.<eos> Today, I had a very productive meeting with President Kirkman regarding SB8180.<eos> I agree with him that sensible measures to ensure gun safety are long overdue and that expanding background checks makes Americans safer.<eos> So I urge my colleagues in the Senate to pass this bill tomorrow and get it to the House, where Republicans, Democrats, and Independents...
Let's just see how this hearing goes.<eos> Hey! You didn't say anything about my haircut.<eos> - Yeah, it looks good.<eos> - You didn't even notice.<eos> I mean, it looks the same?
Hey! You didn't say anything about my haircut.<eos> - Yeah, it looks good.<eos> - You didn't even notice.<eos> I mean, it looks the same?<eos> It always looks great.
Honestly, I don't know.<eos> I think I represented myself well.<eos> Aaron thought I did.<eos> But it's a hard room to read.<eos> I'm sure you knocked it out of the park.
I'm trying to tell you that I won't do that.<eos> I'm not gonna try and make you do anything.<eos> I am asking you... please, just hold your story.<eos> Are you saying it's wrong?<eos> It's incomplete.
Previously on "Criminal Minds"...<eos> I was able to increase the budget to hire a new agent.<eos> That's great.<eos> Well, I made an offer.<eos> I'm expecting a response tomorrow and my fingers are crossed it'll be a yes.
But I'll try my best.<eos> Look, I respect how committed you are to your character.<eos> What character?<eos> The She-Wolf.<eos> It's so crystallized, and that's what I need.
I prefer exaggerated.<eos> I mean, that's the point.<eos> My brother, he once had this promoter set him up with a guy who wrestled with a snake.<eos> The day of the match, the snake died.<eos> Kermit put on a sock puppet. My brother had to wrestle it like it was real.
"Tete de veau" is this part of a calf. Fran.<eos> - What is its head?<eos> - Yes.<eos> "French Cuisine" for 600.<eos> If your canard, or duck, is sauvage, it's this.
- Oh, hey, Glen.<eos> What you got here?<eos> Little decoration for the ring from our sponsor.<eos> Sam.<eos> - Let's check it out, huh?
I scripted the match so you'll win.<eos> Did you ask her about your camera?<eos> - What?<eos> - Your camera.<eos> It's in her locker.
If you can't speak up for us, at least speak up for yourself.<eos> You're right, my dear.<eos> I've been a silent partner for too long.<eos> And this mill...<eos> it has too many secrets.
Isn't that right, Charles?<eos> We'll finally be happy without those orphans around.<eos> "It'll build character."<eos> That's just something people say when they're trying to make others accept a miserable situation.<eos> It is miserable.
I want you to know that I'm forever grateful that you're adopting me.<eos> You're a sight for sore eyes, Mr. Cuthbert.<eos> You best come along. Uh - ahem<eos> - I'll take your bag. Oh, I can carry it.<eos> It isn't heavy.
You're a sight for sore eyes, Mr. Cuthbert.<eos> You best come along. Uh - ahem<eos> - I'll take your bag. Oh, I can carry it.<eos> It isn't heavy.<eos> I've got all my worldly goods in it, but it isn't heavy.
...and please, please let the Cuthberts decide to keep me.<eos> I realize now it's the only thing I truly want, so you don't have to worry yourself about my red hair.<eos> Amen.<eos> Where is my brooch?<eos> - It should be there on your shawl.
I realize now it's the only thing I truly want, so you don't have to worry yourself about my red hair.<eos> Amen.<eos> Where is my brooch?<eos> - It should be there on your shawl.<eos> - It is not.
I've looked everywhere and the brooch is nowhere to be found.<eos> Give it back. Right now.<eos> But I didn't take it, Miss Cuthbert. Honest, I didn't.<eos> I don't believe you.<eos> Where else would it be?
If I do, can I stay here at Green Gables?<eos> Did you, or did you not, take the brooch?<eos> I lost it. I...<eos> I was... I was playing Lady Cordelia when I took the brooch outside with me.<eos> As I was drawing water from the well, I leaned over to make a wish and it fell in.
I told you that brooch meant a great deal to me.<eos> No, b-b-but I made it up!<eos> None of that was real!<eos> I didn't take your brooch!<eos> I don't know where it is!
Are you tilling the soil or stabbing it?<eos> You know this is dumb, right?<eos> We'll all be dead before anything grows.<eos> The earth survived praimfaya once.<eos> It will again.
- I know who you are...<eos> Wanheda.<eos> You helped my people find the bunker.<eos> Thank you for that.<eos> And you gave the flame to an unworthy king, who saw it destroyed.
Here and here.<eos> The ascension call.<eos> The flame was destroyed.<eos> How is this possible?<eos> You said you saw it.
The ascension call.<eos> The flame was destroyed.<eos> How is this possible?<eos> You said you saw it.<eos> It was shattered.
What about them?<eos> Do we just save ourselves?<eos> Clarke, if Nightblood works, we need to get you to Polis, them, too.<eos> We pull in as many people as we can before the death wave hits.<eos> If your mom can make us all Nightbloods, we only need to stay down there until it passes.
Marcus, how do we choose?<eos> We already have.<eos> Clarke's list.<eos> It was always our best chance for survival.<eos> And I know where it is.
There will be days when we wish we were out there right now, but I promise you, if we stand together, if we are wonkru, then... _<eos> Do you hear that?<eos> It's 210 miles from Polis to the island.<eos> According to what was our last drone, the wave is accelerating.<eos> If we're not off the ground at least 20 minutes before it hits, the electromagnetic charge in the pyroclastic cloud will shut down the rocket's avionics, meaning it won't fly.
Of course he gets the hug.<eos> - You chose the machine?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I did.<eos> It's back at the lab, where we need...
-Lisa Turner is my wife and...<eos> Call-back number. -You can call us at 734-682...<eos> -Tell them what happened.<eos> We dropped the vial of HCG.<eos> It's broken.
Call-back number. -You can call us at 734-682...<eos> -Tell them what happened.<eos> We dropped the vial of HCG.<eos> It's broken.<eos> Supposed to take it at 21:30.
You slowly go fucking crazy.<eos> I did a gig recently.<eos> I was in Ireland and I was in the green room by myself.<eos> I went to turn on the light. It was one of those pull switches.<eos> It wound up around itself, looked like a little noose.
You know, make a little extra money. Who knows? Maybe you and me take a cruise.<eos> We'd have a good time, right? Get out there."<eos> That's how it would work.<eos> That's how my ethnic cleansing would work.<eos> It wouldn't be based on race or religion.
I'm just...<eos> I didn't mean that stuff.<eos> I shouldn't have said any of that stuff.<eos> - Listen, I can't explain the world I was in, okay?<eos> I know it's different. It always will be.
I'm stuck, and I'm having trouble moving forward.<eos> - What do you think is holding you back?<eos> - I've been sleeping with Eddie.<eos> - Love is often more powerful than faith.<eos> It can be a prison that holds us hostage from who we could be.
- What do you think is holding you back?<eos> - I've been sleeping with Eddie.<eos> - Love is often more powerful than faith.<eos> It can be a prison that holds us hostage from who we could be.<eos> It weakens us.
Okay, push 5 of haldol.<eos> Uh the rumor mill is ch...<eos> The rumor mill is churning.<eos> What?<eos> What's it say?
I found something that...<eos> it is called the BXP protocol, and it started at Gillman.<eos> They are experimenting with humanized antibodies for late-stage cancer immunotherapy.<eos> A clinical trial.<eos> And it's successful?
Work.<eos> I have employees who can vouch for it.<eos> What do you do?<eos> Run an online clothing company.<eos> Built it from scratch.
No, not always, Monkey.<eos> I mean, sometimes people feel like... like they have to pretend that everything's okay.<eos> But... And this is the most important part... You and me, we never have to pretend with each other.<eos> I really didn't like that school.<eos> I didn't like it either.
Um, Molly...<eos> - Morgenstern.<eos> - Very controversial.<eos> - Emma. - Mm-hmm? Your skin isn't like butter.<eos> It is butter.

You have that needle inserted into his brain...<eos> - I told you.<eos> I've got the needle.<eos> - What if you don't?<eos> What if I slip and it goes right into his...
Oh, she's gonna hate me.<eos> That's a good point.<eos> It has taken me a long time to tell you.<eos> Attraction is messy.<eos> It grabs you when you least expect it.
- What the hell?<eos> You need to go.<eos> You need to go out that door... okay?<eos> ... right now.<eos> It won't open again.
Mommy!<eos> Daddy! Mommy!<eos> Nathalie showed me a snake!<eos> - It was a larva.<eos> - She said that it's gonna turn into a beautiful moth someday.
That doesn't mean they've been hoarding.<eos> They've had plenty of time to gather food.<eos> For all we know, they could have raided the stores - before we started looking.<eos> - You don't know that.<eos> If they have more food, they should share it with us.
- Overanalyzing the stats, man.<eos> It's too confusing.<eos> And they're scary now.<eos> We saw this one stat, and y'all may have seen this, too.<eos> It said every time Steph Curry shoots 40 percent from the three-point line, a black man gets killed by the police.
I need you to step up and lick my vagina!<eos> Look, I love your vagina.<eos> It's a fantastic vagina.<eos> Then lick my vagina!<eos> It's not going to lick itself!
She's gone.<eos> But she's alive.<eos> And as long as she is, we can find a cure.<eos> Now, the first course of action lies here in the Vault, so we will need your expertise, Master Wells.<eos> The contagion has been stopped in the past, it can be stopped again.
I am a Witness, a title that has never been more apropos.<eos> I have a responsibility.<eos> To witness this curse, to ward off evil, and to ensure that none of you become casualties of a supernatural war you did not choose to fight.<eos> So.<eos> I'm sorry, Mr. Crane, but... I made my own choice, and I'm pretty sure you're not gonna like it.
each sigil will cast a different kind of killing spell.<eos> JENNY:<eos> Sigils are usually recorded in occult texts, they're not branded onto people's skin.<eos> Yeah, because once you access a sigil, it burns itself out.<eos> I can't imagine what happens if it's on your body.
An old friend.<eos> Vic was a local kid, visiting her brother's grave.<eos> No eyewitnesses. At first, I thought it was an animal attack, but then I saw the severe ossification of the wound site.<eos> Is that... stone?<eos> That's what I'm talking about. The entire chest cavity, it's as if it's been petrified.
Like you don't know?<eos> I'm sorry about Adam.<eos> I just keep making the same mistake.<eos> I keep forgetting how much this place sucks.<eos> It just wrecks you.
I have fulfilled my duty, protecting my piece of the spear.<eos> But I'm just a grunt.<eos> Now it's your turn.<eos> You can figure out a way to destroy the spear.<eos> Don't let it ruin another person's life.
The spear must be composed of some kind of magnetized compound which acts as its own sealant.<eos> No, no, no, don't, don't, don't.<eos> Don't touch it.<eos> Now that the spear is whole, it will try and lure each of us to use it.<eos> It will draw on our weaknesses, our desires, our regrets.
No, no, no, don't, don't, don't.<eos> Don't touch it.<eos> Now that the spear is whole, it will try and lure each of us to use it.<eos> It will draw on our weaknesses, our desires, our regrets.<eos> It will promise each of us that we can remake the world just as we want it.
Well, maybe you didn't try hard enough.<eos> No, no, no, no, no!<eos> Not on the ship, bro!<eos> You said destroy, so I destroyed.<eos> It's not destroyed. It's not even charred.
Not on the ship, bro!<eos> You said destroy, so I destroyed.<eos> It's not destroyed. It's not even charred.<eos> Any harm brought upon the spear is temporary.<eos> It will always heal itself.
You don't.<eos> You destroy it.<eos> Yes, well, I've tried that, Dr. Heywood.<eos> It is impervious to destruction.<eos> No, it's not.
Oh, I see.<eos> In your eyes, I'm always gonna be a... criminal.<eos> This is fascinating.<eos> Apparently the spear will glow in the presence of divine blood.<eos> Yeah, and it also revealed the message when Mick lit it on fire.
According to this map, the blood of Christ is hidden right smack in the middle of no-man's land.<eos> Great, right at the center of the bloodiest battle in human history.<eos> Even if we were to make it through the terrain unscathed, there's still the issue of the blood's precise location.<eos> That's the good news.<eos> Just as the spear acted as a diving rod for its pieces, it glows when it's close to Jesus' blood.
I am so sorry.<eos> I had to take that.<eos> There's only so many times you can tell the President of the United States that you'll call him back.<eos> You want to get to the point? - Yes.<eos> I brought you here to discuss a... sensitive matter, and it goes by the name of Malcolm Merlyn.
Don't you get it, man?<eos> Your impulse was a reality scar working on your subconscious.<eos> Reality scar.<eos> So, what does this fun gun do?<eos> Theoretically, it targets irregularities in the hippocampus, acting like a "Control-Z" for memories.
Get the Spear!<eos> Let go of the Spear, and I won't use it to turn you into a jockstrap.<eos> Yeah!<eos> Perhaps not.<eos> Give it up!
Give it up!<eos> Sara. Why do we always find ourselves in this situation?<eos> 'Cause you keep finding yourself on the wrong side of history.<eos> Nice work, Mick.<eos> Now hand it over.
More than that.<eos> Is it love, Father?<eos> Oh, for the Lord's sake, can you not remain quiet?<eos> But, yes, the bastard has it, it can only be love.<eos> It is a powerful thing. Would you not agree, Lord Uhtred?
The trouble is, human life spans, they're tiny.<eos> They're hilarious.<eos> You get used up too quickly.<eos> So what's the answer?<eos> Go on, figure it out.
Just do it.<eos> Now... Martin, tell me - your National Insurance number.<eos> - What?<eos> Your National Insurance number.<eos> Give it to me.
You okay?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, I'm fine.<eos> It's not going to explode.<eos> The rocket, it's not going to explode with us in it.
Yeah.<eos> Yeah, I'm fine.<eos> It's not going to explode.<eos> The rocket, it's not going to explode with us in it.<eos> It's safe.
Ever get nosebleeds?<eos> When people hit me in the nose.<eos> And how often does that happen?<eos> That's very cute.<eos> The reason I ask is because the air is breathable up here, but it is way too dry, so it really fucks up your nasal membrane.
Police come hard after people without PC all the time.<eos> This is not stop and frisk.<eos> This is a psychosexual madman holding a kidnapped woman in an as yet unidentified location.<eos> I tried the last number that Decker called.<eos> It was to a burner.
What is that?<eos> Okay, the milk here, does Ryan always bring the same kind?<eos> Until a couple days ago, there's a new kind in the fridge.<eos> Okay, did you see who put it there?<eos> It was there when I woke up yesterday.
- Yeah, come here.<eos> I am out, so we can skip just this once.<eos> No, we can't.<eos> You have been trying that line on me for two decades, literally since freshman year.<eos> - Yeah, because it works.
I am out, so we can skip just this once.<eos> No, we can't.<eos> You have been trying that line on me for two decades, literally since freshman year.<eos> - Yeah, because it works.<eos> - No, it's never worked once.
- That's okay.<eos> Nick was.<eos> - Oh, good.<eos> I'm glad.<eos> Marianne's apartment... looks a lot bigger when it's spinning.
I was so busy trying to think of a cure to the city's water problem I didn't stop to consider the Band-Aid.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> A water-filtration plant is a cure to a problem presented by a virus which is immune to chlorine and UV treatment.<eos> This filter is the Band-Aid.<eos> Even if the EPA compels the city to break ground on a new plant tomorrow, it won't be operational for years.
- Is this fur?<eos> Yeah, I work at a dog hotel.<eos> Wait. What?<eos> A dog hotel?<eos> Yep. It's, um, called Chateau Marmutt.
You have done so much harm to yourself... more so than anyone else.<eos> 8R requires your rigorous honesty, your humility, your patience, your diligence.<eos> Leave a message.<eos> Stay close to The Light, and The Light will provide you with everything you need.<eos> Of your own volition, you can't overcome your fear when it conspires with your pride... or your mute darkness... or your willful denial.
Eddie...<eos> My name isn't Sam.<eos> What are you doing to me?<eos> ‐ Painting flowers on your walls of doom.<eos> Your necklace... where is it?
Now every first he has is gonna be with someone else.<eos> First kid to call him Daddy won't be mine. First kid to go to prom won't be mine.<eos> First kid to go to college...<eos> Well, it is Colt and Heather, so I might have a shot at that one.<eos> Look, your time with Colt will come and it'll be just as special.
That's my man.<eos> - Hey, who wants to go to Arby's?<eos> - What's up, Abby?<eos> - How's the tagging going?<eos> It's going.
You scared the shit out of me!<eos> What the hell are you doing on the couch?<eos> I was trying to stay up until you got home.<eos> Aw, that's sweet.<eos> I even cooked you a lasagna, but I fell asleep and it burned.
Without Gloria to absorb the hate.<eos> Okay, why am I scared?<eos> I'm feeling scared.<eos> Because you are flashing back to every family event that ended with Dad whisper-screaming at Mom,<eos> "Would you calm down?" while she would swing her pocketbook around until it burst open like a pill-packed piñata.
I, uh, don't think it's working.<eos> - Oh, well, I mean, I'm just seeing this watch for the first time, but it looks like it's got a self-winder.<eos> - You just move your...<eos> - Yeah.<eos> ... arm around to keep it going.
- That's true.<eos> - That's true. Check your jacket pocket.<eos> No.<eos> Come on.<eos> What? Oh, my God, it's here.
I'm sitting there, looking at her, and then just staring at that gigantic engagement ring.<eos> You're going on all these fake dates. You're snuggling all over town.<eos> How is any of that different?<eos> You know what it is?<eos> This whole thing, it's horrible.

Oh, it was about a kid from the inner city who moved to the country to learn how to drive.<eos> It was fun, man.<eos> I made up a lot of stuff on that too.<eos> So what are you working on now?<eos> I'm actually doing a new show with that guy Chef Jeff, it's called BFFs.
Anne.<eos> Since your Anne is part of our community now and you'll be raising her, we wanted to extend the invitation for you to join us.<eos> We're meeting at the Andrews' home this afternoon.<eos> Will you come?<eos> Set your milk down next to mine, Anne, so it'll stay cold.

and as happens with us, with-- When we get a bacteria, we try to get rid of it as quickly as possible.<eos> That's exactly what these animals do.<eos> They try to get rid of those plants that are no longer functional... and leave behind the transparent, naked tissue.<eos> They've lost the very most important food source that they have.<eos> So, it's starting to starve.
So, it's starting to starve.<eos> [Vevers] When the coral bleaches, the flesh becomes clear.<eos> And what you're seeing is its skeleton underneath.<eos> So, the bright whites that you see in the pictures... is just the skeletons everywhere.<eos> [Gates] If it's a very clean white look about the coral... it will still be alive.
And what you're seeing is its skeleton underneath.<eos> So, the bright whites that you see in the pictures... is just the skeletons everywhere.<eos> [Gates] If it's a very clean white look about the coral... it will still be alive.<eos> It's not allowing anything else to grow on it.<eos> It will generally not grow. It will generally not reproduce.

He is aware and instructs.<eos> He's the most important specialist.<eos> The ARD documentary regarding the Russian whistle-blowers... what did you think, hearing these allegations?<eos> It was inflammatory enough that they were afraid to run it while the whistle-blowers were still in Russia.<eos> So they got them out of Russia, ran the program, and it was a bombshell.
Remember Orwell.<eos> "We will meet each other where there is no darkness."<eos> When I first interviewed you a year ago, I asked you if you thought your investigation would be a defining moment in the history of sport.<eos> How would you answer that question now?<eos> Yes, it can be a defining moment, and I think it should.
And if you go behind this list, there is creation date.<eos> And this list came from the ministry?<eos> Of course, of course.<eos> So, Rebecca, you have the file.<eos> So under properties of the file, you can see it was created Tuesday, January 21st, from the ministry.

Thanks. It's a dry rub.<eos> It's a good dry rub.<eos> Julia thinks that I should put myself out there and find someone to have sex with.<eos> She didn't say the sex part. I added that.<eos> My school is crowded, noisy, and it smells weird, but it has one thing going for it:

The Doomsday Clock.<eos> The what?<eos> Symbolic clock face, representing a countdown to possible global catastrophe, started by some atomic scientists in 1947.<eos> The closer they set the clock to midnight, the closer we are to global disaster.<eos> Currently, it's set at three minutes to midnight.
Dead as the moon.<eos> You seem pretty damn calm about it.<eos> Do I?<eos> Oh, I'm sorry... it's not my first dead planet.<eos> Ask for help, it will be given.
And yet I find myself drawn to this case for the uniquely challenging foe it presents.<eos> How is Frank Trimble a â€œuniquely challenging foeâ€?<eos> He's not.<eos> I'm referring to time itself.<eos> As rivals go, it's undefeated.
Find out who is responsible for this act of treason.<eos> And when you do, do as I've taught you... make them pay.<eos> For your dear mum.<eos> When I first came to this town, that clock didn't even move.<eos> Now look at it, ticking away, marking every magical second since my arrival.
He brought it here to kill me.<eos> I'm sorry, but your son cannot be saved.<eos> He's evil.<eos> This is where she keeps all of her most powerful possessions.<eos> If the orb exists, it'll be in here.
All right, I'm confused, but you know what fixes that? Scotch.<eos> The past always catches up with us, doesn't it?<eos> Past, present and future is a disaster, no matter how you slice it.<eos> My second year on the job... there was this guy, Peter Scarelli, raped and killed a ten-year-old girl.<eos> We had DNA evidence, but then, right before trial, the DNA sample got compromised in the lab, so it was inadmissible.
Might this equipment be of interest... to anyone outside the hospital?<eos> - Not that I know of.<eos> - So you think it's an inside job?<eos> I wouldn't know.<eos> Someone may have borrowed it and forgotten to register it.

Without you, there is no hope.<eos> -Found one!<eos> -What do you want from me?<eos> We saw the mer-cat you came in.<eos> We think it can stand up against the queen and her forces.

Of the rage he's feeling inside. I recognise it.<eos> You mean here?<eos> - And here?<eos> - Exactly! Grief sits in your throat and your chest.<eos> Until you feel it letting go there, you can't really breathe properly.
Without having any sort of design in mind, imagine this sort of logic where you have some kind of undulation, so it almost like looks like a marble curtain, and that's what gives it stability.<eos> Almost like a James Turrell.<eos> That you're inside this weird translucent, undulating slice of marble and then you're looking up through...<eos> I think with the dome...<eos> I mean, it creates that one experience of being inside, and it's probably a beautiful optic from the outside, but that's only that one use.
Because the time schedule is so compressed for the Serpentine Pavilion, we have to make decisions absurdly fast.<eos> We have been keeping a series of ideas alive.<eos> For a while we had three, then we boiled it down to two.<eos> And I think we are looking at this idea of a wall that is made out of fiberglass bricks or blocks.<eos> And then you're almost pulling it apart, like a zipper, so that it becomes undulating landscapes on the exterior, like a valley and a hillside.
- This one is lower.<eos> - That one should fit, yeah.<eos> That's kind of nice.<eos> There's no doubt that the wall looks very good, right? Yeah.<eos> And it feels very comfortable.
They're saying they're not responsible for what people put on their website.<eos> It goes much deeper than that.<eos> What's on their website affects and hurt, and traumatized a lot of people.<eos> When these ads involving kids are posted, the responses from potential customers start coming in within seconds.<eos> The ad would be live until it got approved, anywhere from 30 seconds to two hours.
That is bullshit.<eos> I unfortunately have to say that Backpage's legal strategy has been very effective.<eos> It's a mystery to me that Backpage keeps winning, and that Backpage keeps winning in such grand style.<eos> Very expensive lawyers, cloaking themselves in the First Amendment and Section 230.<eos> As far as a legal strategy, I guess it's brilliant, 'cause it has worked.

No.
And that it chose to protect the internet.<eos> Now that particular statement really pissed me off, because I don't think Congress did any such thing.<eos> He was frustrated, because he felt as though the Judge did not understand what he was trying to argue.<eos> The fact that Ropes Gray lost is actually a revelation of how much the court system needs to be trained on child sex trafficking.<eos> So, his decision was not overwhelmingly surprising, it was overwhelmingly disappointing, though.
Our principal claims are that Backpage is engaged in intentional criminal conduct.<eos> They had the intent to further the sex-trafficking?<eos> They intended to further the sex-trafficking trade.<eos> What in your complaint goes the further step of saying actually, they're participating in the venture to sex traffic, as opposed to advertise?<eos> Why is that different from what a newspaper does when it has a special advertising section for Washington's Birthday Car Sales?
The idea that Backpage is just trying to cater to fetishes of old men, doesn't really involve underage children,<eos> I don't think they're gonna be able to make that in court with a straight face.<eos> The witness stand is a lonely place to lie.<eos> We're gonna bring them into court and they can tell that story under cross-examination.<eos> Let's see if they can sustain it.
Their larger donors include Facebook, Microsoft and Google.<eos> Which means that funds from these companies are being used to support Backpage in these cases involving underage sex trafficking.<eos> Silicon Valley breaks out in a cold sweat when we talk about amending CDA, but there are ways that we could do this that could get at the trafficking of children.<eos> The government cannot just censor speech that it disagrees with or dislikes.<eos> The money and the lobbies are preventing any change, even though it's a reasonable change, as if we're going to have to go to the altar of the First Amendment, and ask for forgiveness.
We have lost a hundred years of evolution on planet Earth.<eos> A true lost century.<eos> Huge progress was made in the 1920s as Nikola Tesla developed energy-generation technologies that could power the Earth, drawing endless free energy from the so-called "empty space" around us.<eos> So called "empty space" isn't really empty at all.<eos> It's actually full of energy.

My head is spinning. I'm confused, freaking out.<eos> Please tell me you did it in the palace! - Angie!<eos> - Well, did you?<eos> Robert wanted to keep it a secret, so, no.<eos> And with Liam, the relationship was over before it began.
Surprise, surprise.<eos> It's a brazen act of aggression.<eos> Well, it's a crime of opportunity.<eos> Petrov thinks the US government has their eye off the ball.<eos> Well, it doesn't.
Young Benjamin here knows what's coming.<eos> Who cares if he's never heard of Johnny Carson?<eos> Poor old Tusk.<eos> He wears that game face, but he doesn't fool me.<eos> The future terrifies him because he knows it's short.
You offer me some racist gesture. And I, what? I'm a friend forever?<eos> Ban isn't even sustainable.<eos> What matters to you?<eos> - The president's attention.<eos> - You have it.
And a few others who were elevated around the same time, yes.<eos> Thank you, Cathy.<eos> That Brockhart spot we talked about.<eos> You have it?<eos> Is it verified?
Well, maybe he didn't.<eos> - And the gun?<eos> - That's the thing.<eos> It's not there.<eos> Maybe someone staying at the hotel or working there took it.
- My husband's waiting for me.<eos> - But you're gonna be made to look a fool.<eos> There's no need to insult me, Francis.<eos> Witness after witness is gonna rebut whatever you have to say.<eos> My testimony is what it is.
This is the presidency.<eos> How much higher can a politician go?<eos> The real power isn't here.<eos> It's beyond here.<eos> It's above it, but still working in conjunction with it.
I've always told myself that everything I did was for her.<eos> But maybe it wasn't.<eos> Maybe I love power more.<eos> For you, and for any dear to you, I would do anything.<eos> If my career were of that better kind that there was any opportunity or capacity to sacrifice in it, I would embrace any sacrifice for you and for those dear to you.
Probably because I went to the wrong ones. I didn't go to the fascinating ones.<eos> But they looked like this.<eos> People playing guitars here, guitars here, you might have had keyboards here, and then you sometimes had a curtain or the band's name up here, or, if you were really lucky, you might have had some projection.<eos> But that was pretty much everything I saw in bands.<eos> And I didn't like this shape, 'cause I thought it was a humpbacked band shape.
How long will they experience this for and then what will happen next?<eos> Everything else is sort of serving that.<eos> [Bradwell] The design you see is the tip of the iceberg.<eos> But the amount of work you do to provide that tip of the iceberg is what's important.<eos> It will hold you up.
It has my passport in it.<eos> Wait, that guy... he has my bag. Excuse me, sir.<eos> Nice try stealing my bag.<eos> I see you've already painted it.<eos> Cam, it... it's back on your shoulder!
12 bucks?<eos> No wonder the middle class is so angry.<eos> There's no way you would be able to follow her story.<eos> - Yes, he would have.<eos> - Fine. Tell it again.
Mitchell and I are early contenders to win the best costume in the human/animal category.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Self-comforting with food.<eos> I've been working on that all morning, and it is for a party tonight.<eos> What are a bunch of gays gonna do with a cake but stand around screeching about how pretty it is?
- so I'm just gonna...<eos> - Breathe, breathe.<eos> Frank and Lorraine, today marks the public and legal joining of your souls, marriage being above all else, a contract.<eos> Uh, one of my favorite authors once wrote,<eos> "If love is not all, then it is nothing.
But he asked for a lawyer as soon as he got here.<eos> Are you familiar with the Freedom Arms .22 caliber belt buckle handgun?<eos> It's one of the, uh, tiniest pistols on the market.<eos> You think we're having a hard time finding the gun at the warehouse because it's small?<eos> I don't it's at the warehouse.
If I'm right, he won't be the last.<eos> I'm home!<eos> In the study.<eos> You were right about Gunther Klecko's gun.<eos> It was right where you said it would be.
The medication staved off some of the thoughts, but a lot of them would break through and would leave a void in their wake.<eos> Like, to say I have low self-esteem is not true.<eos> I have no self-esteem.<eos> I don't have the architecture for good feelings.<eos> You could give me a trophy, it will slide right down.
I typed in "Was slavery," and the autofill said,<eos> "Really as bad as they say?"<eos> Swear to God.<eos> Yes.<eos> And to answer the question, yes, it was as bad as they say.
Do you feel the strings, or do they trick you into thinking you're a real boy?<eos> [Rashid laughs] Pinocchio!<eos> That was my favorite movie growing up.<eos> What was the Kenyan version?<eos> [clicking tongue] No, it was called
We've done it.<eos> This is the end of Zarkon's reign.<eos> Yes, Princess.<eos> Ready my armor.<eos> But, lord, it has never been successfully tested.
Nice of you to stop in.<eos> Yeah, I just landed.<eos> You look great.<eos> I heard that the treatment was working.<eos> Yeah. Yeah, it's working.
What have you done with my future?<eos> She just wasn't that into you.<eos> I'm not talking about Rachel.<eos> Oh, shadow file.<eos> Oh, is it on the shelf over there? Where you stashed the gun I took this clip out of?
Delgado got himself into that mess.<eos> Did you know they'd kill him?<eos> Look...<eos> I figured they'd send a message.<eos> I got to admit I didn't think it's be that loud.
Your cure didn't work.<eos> - I found you another cure. - You did?<eos> - You have to explain.<eos> - I'm going to.<eos> The important thing is that it worked.
- In a fully operational clinic.<eos> - The clinic was your project.<eos> I've finished my project, so the clinic is closed.<eos> The total amount of energy is constant.<eos> It can't be created or destroyed.
I can't say that, Nathaniel.<eos> Because I don't want to go back to 1942.<eos> I know that I'm supposed to.<eos> I know I have a destiny and that we shouldn't damage time any more than we already have, but I have to believe that time is stronger than that.<eos> And that if I have a destiny, it'll wait for me.
My favorite show is the dining hall menu.<eos> Does that mean you get the menu ahead of time?<eos> When's chicken?<eos> They're letting me produce my own show about women on campus.<eos> Is it called She-lumbia?
Is it called She-lumbia?<eos> Her-spectives?<eos> Gals on the Town?<eos> Shut up.<eos> It's called Profiles.
-[Cyndee squeals] [both laugh]<eos> How does this look?<eos> After the Post story, I really feel like people are gonna expect a vest.<eos> What's going on here, Russ?<eos> Do you not like it?
-I feel like Jasmine.<eos> -Not Aladdin?<eos> But I feel like all this attention is making you forget what we're trying to do here.<eos> No, yeah, the tigers.<eos> Of course. No, the toilet rat. It's going extinct.
There you go.<eos> Any part of his body hits the platform or the water, he's out.<eos> Now, you can use these elastic bands that the Bungee Beds are suspended from to aid you.<eos> So you can reach up and grab them from the second bed there, sort of pull it down.<eos> I say you grab the bed, bring it to you.
All of your victims are connected to the 2014 trial of Eli Kotite.<eos> So, why-why kill them now?<eos> Take a look around, Mr. Holmes. Anything jump out?<eos> Well, as I mentioned, there's the clock.<eos> It ticks off a full hour every 44 minutes.
You really need to sample it and refine a product.<eos> It takes many iterations, so that ultimately it can live on its own.<eos> So for example, when we were designing the Sinnerlig range for IKEA, it was very important to us that we make furniture that could reach the whole world.<eos> The project for IKEA, trying to understand what is mass manufacturing and instead of maybe saying, "Oh, this is horrible."<eos> It's questioning and trying to understand that mass manufacturing can give us a great benefit, because it can give us access to things for everyone.
I wanted everything to feel like it was of one.<eos> That it was breathing fully as an institution.<eos> [Paula] It had to be populous. I knew it had to be New Yorkish, meaning it had to be loud and proud.<eos> I was flipping through one of my books on American wood type.<eos> I like American wood type because it's powerful, and it has many forms.
Graphic designers love that story.<eos> [Paula] Seymour was my design hero when I was in art school.<eos> He must have been 39, 40? I was 21.<eos> Seymour was an illustrator, but he's a sensational designer.<eos> I thought his work was very funny. Some of it was exceedingly political.
Well...<eos> I'm not the boy in the bubble anymore.<eos> Is that good news?<eos> It means the half-life of the radiation used to poison you is very short.<eos> It was only 24 hours.
And the mayor's office has the stats, so you know it works.<eos> Emily Gray, Councilman Slessinger's chief of staff.<eos> I can vouch that the shooting took place where BulletPoint said it did.<eos> I found a shell casing a little further down the block.<eos> It likely fell from the vehicle that drove the crime scene away.

Still.<eos> Five million bucks?<eos> Apparently, she's the perfect storm of provenance, quality and legend.<eos> She's a 1957 Carfax Desperado, a year and make which has already become known the "Stradivarius of electric guitars". They fetch up to a million dollars on the collector's market, and that's without the celebrity pedigree.<eos> If you add to that the fact that apparently it went missing during Mr. Clapton's 1971 tour...
She found that he had installed editing software on his computer.<eos> Our techs aren't allowed to put anything on their computers.<eos> That's what he must've used to delete parts of Azoff's shooting.<eos> The thing is that the software wasn't a recent addition.<eos> It had been on there for months, and he didn't use it to just delete things.
From my heart, thank you so much.<eos> So I hope you're not disappointed when... I tell you that... what I really want... is to stay with the company.<eos> That's what I wanted to tell you.<eos> Also, I'd like to accept the job of supervisor.<eos> If it's still available, of course.
That's because you're the boss and you don't have to get up early.<eos> [Alba] Future or past.<eos> We all have to decide at some point in our life which way we want to look.<eos> If you want to cling to the past, to stick with what you already know, or if you want to leave it behind and look toward the future.<eos> The future is scary sometimes because it's unknown.

[Carmen] That's enough.<eos> No need to go into details, darling.<eos> [Ricardo] We'll talk later.<eos> [inhales sharply] Excuse me, I need to go to the ladies' room.<eos> If you manage to keep the past hidden when it was about to come to light, there's only one thing to do:
I'm going that way.<eos> I have things to do, too.<eos> Bye.<eos> -Give my best to Pablo.<eos> [Alba] You may think it can vanish like a puff of smoke into the night sky, but it's not that simple.
We're committing a crime, and now I'm an accomplice.<eos> -It won't always be like this.<eos> -Well, that's reassuring.<eos> Automation is the future. You said it.<eos> It will come about.
It seems like the end of the world, but it's not.<eos> -There are other fish in the sea.<eos> -[stutters] Excuse me?<eos> Your relationship was going nowhere.<eos> It had no future.
Let's see how Felipe Camargo finishes Level 3.<eos> He's on the first pole, and already looking like he's having some trouble.<eos> This obstacle should play into his strengths, since it relies so heavily on climbing ability.<eos> He's having trouble reaching that next pole.<eos> I like his strategy here of kicking that pole so it swings a little closer.
That's determination, Terry.<eos> He had to give up.<eos> He's going into Faceplant.<eos> He says he has an ability to see the course in his mind, and he knows exactly what he's going to do.<eos> My brain injury hurts me a little bit because it's hard to understand certain aspects of the course, but it gives me an advantage because I can interpret the course very quickly.
They just walk, walk, walk.<eos> Finally, a woman walks by.<eos> I'm like, "Da-da-da-da! Hey... how much is this bag?"<eos> She's like, "Oh."<eos> "It's $800.
And I get that, you know?<eos> I just wanted to show mine.<eos> I wanted to show my life, you know?<eos> The show wasn't called Every Latino In The World.<eos> It was called Cristela.
And say what?<eos> I don't know.<eos> If I had something useful to show them, then...<eos> That new hybrid sample.<eos> The other night, you said it was the key to solving sterility.
And afterwards, I leave the venue.<eos> And who's standing outside waiting for me?<eos> My good friend Mick.<eos> And he's like, "Trevor, how was your show?"<eos> I said, "It was horrible, Mick, horrible.
Many men in this room... Many, many men in this room have tales of how they once defeated the pussy.<eos> Let me tell you now, they have not.<eos> The owner of the pussy may have given you the impression that you defeated the pussy, but it is alive and well, my friends.<eos> Whenever people say that, I go, "Do you understand how impressive the vagina is?<eos> Do you understand how strong it is?"
Do you understand how strong it is?"<eos> There's a reason men have sought to oppress it for so long.<eos> The vagina is frighteningly powerful.<eos> You realize human beings come out of a vagina.<eos> Human beings come out, and still it continues to work as intended.
Do you understand how impressive that is?<eos> I don't know if I'm the only one.<eos> New York, do you understand?<eos> A human being comes out... of the vagina.<eos> And still, it continues to operate, and it continues to work after a human has just come out.
"You do this to me all the time.<eos> What am I supposed to do now?<eos> Look at me. Do you know how hard it is to have blue balls, how painful this is?<eos> What am I supposed to do now with this?"<eos> I love how guys talk about an erection like it's something bought at the store and we can't return.
The coefficient isn't lambda, it's lambda sub one.<eos> And over here, you should consider the possibility that the brain itself is in two different quantum states.<eos> And lastly, do you have any little soup crackers?<eos> The rate of spinning for the central axis centrifuge has to be four revolutions per second.<eos> It can't be four revolutions, it's got to be seven.
But I'm not like that.<eos> You don't know unless you try.<eos> Just try.<eos> Fear excites me.<eos> Perhaps it will heighten things for you, too.
"Schwinkie"?<eos> Are you sure you're pronouncing that correctly?<eos> Listen, Anna, this can either go very smoothly for you or very difficult-ly.<eos> What?<eos> The Schwinkie file. Where is it?
I watch a lot of cop shows.<eos> Yeah, well, like I said, it's in the shop.<eos> It's been in the shop all week. You know the name of the shop?<eos> I don't know the name of it, but it's...<eos> It's on Manchester, near the airport.
Monroe, I...<eos> He might bounce an idea off me, or talk through a scenario, if he was stuck.<eos> Bernadette, he did show me an early draft of this...<eos> a year ago.<eos> It wasn't nearly this good.
I stopped following her around.<eos> I started hiding.<eos> Hey. Where's my good night kiss?<eos> I turned a closet into my reading nook.<eos> I would get under this soft blanket my grandmother had knitted for me and read my Edward Eagar books and just kind of let my hand go wherever it wanted.
Now I think the noise is... it's not out here, you know?<eos> So... just thinking about... taking some risks.<eos> Hmm. You know what?<eos> I'm going to play you a song.<eos> Sylvere: As unorthodox as this whole thing has been, it has brought me a deeper respect for love... its ingenuity and it's refusal to be categorized and set down to fossilize.
Well, here's where it gets tricky.<eos> Do we believe her or not?<eos> On the one hand, getting pregnant is a power control move straight out of the female psychopath handbook.<eos> On the other hand...<eos> If her story is true, it meant she sent her lesbian lover down to Mexico to get Reid to... ugh, yeah.
The video, which was about eight and a half, nine minutes long, depicts the assailant sexually assaulting the victim.<eos> You can observe the victim crying, asking the assailant to stop.<eos> The app itself does reflect various likes that were going on during the live-streaming.<eos> Marina, you can see laughing while this is going on.<eos> Looking backwards towards the Periscope almost as if, you know, she wanted to be included in it as a selfie.
Uh, where's the tram take off from?<eos> Anywhere on either Flinders Street...<eos> Flinders Street's probably the best place to jump on...<eos> -Cool.<eos> And, yeah, it just does the circle around the CBD. [chuckles]
Babe, watch out!<eos> Oh, I got it.<eos> -[chuckles] Thank you.<eos> -[Reynolds] Saved you from the leaves.<eos> I want to launch my site, and I really hope for it to do very well. Which I do believe in it.
You don't have to call it escorting. [chuckles]<eos> [Bailey] I'm just saying that most people do.<eos> And John kinda trusted me to steer you guys in the right direction.<eos> [Bailey] Girls just disappear.<eos> The industry is not for everyone, the adult industry... it can be a very scary place.
It's about his desire.<eos> That really didn't work out for me, because when I have sex with someone, it's about both of us.<eos> When you show sex, it should be based on values where you feel that the people in it, that they are connected.<eos> That they are respecting each other.<eos> Another thing that I didn't like about pornography was that most of it was so badly done.
You want to tell me what you're up to?<eos> It's quite simple, really.<eos> I'm going to dismantle your organization.<eos> NYOOPI is a blight on the profession which I love.<eos> It enables con men and imbeciles to pass themselves off as detectives.
It's quite simple, really.<eos> I'm going to dismantle your organization.<eos> NYOOPI is a blight on the profession which I love.<eos> It enables con men and imbeciles to pass themselves off as detectives.<eos> Your group deserves to be exposed as the rubber stamp that it is.
Turns out, it was the sound of a perfect strike.<eos> You left tracks at the scene.<eos> Bloody footprints from Carter's door to your coach's car.<eos> Stood to reason you took the murder weapon along with the bodies.<eos> Only you didn't. You threw it 245 feet into that Dumpster.
It's pretty impressive.<eos> But like I said, it was the worst pitch of your life.<eos> The blood of both victims and your fingerprints are all over it.<eos> What happened? Did you think you heard someone coming?<eos> You panicked, threw it as far as you could?
The National Enquirer published a story.<eos> It is a story that quoted one source on the record, Roger Stone.<eos> Let me be clear.<eos> This National Enquirer story is garbage.<eos> And it is a smear that has come from Donald Trump and his henchmen.
Why not?<eos> I don't know.<eos> It's a rule.<eos> Well, now that I know it's a rule, I won't do it again.<eos> And how did you read my list when it's in my back pocket?
All I have to do is figure out if I love Paige.<eos> Love?<eos> You okay?<eos> Love is a big emotion.<eos> It can take a long time to develop, or it can happen like that.
You gotta start opening up to us, kid.<eos> Just, you know, let us know what's going on.<eos> It's hard to be the parent of a teenager.<eos> The teenagers are trying to establish some independence.<eos> Sometimes when they would like help on some level, they're also pushing it away.
Just, you know, let us know what's going on.<eos> It's hard to be the parent of a teenager.<eos> The teenagers are trying to establish some independence.<eos> Sometimes when they would like help on some level, they're also pushing it away.<eos> And both Clay and Hannah, at times, really would like some help, but don't know how to ask for it.
The Zombie Titular. I'm not a Goddamn...<eos> I am Lieutenant Cyril Figgis, LAPD, you sentient shit-sacks!<eos> - I showed you my shield!<eos> - And if you'd show it to me again... I don't...<eos> whoever hit me took it.
Are you ready?<eos> One, two...<eos> It looks dangerous, but, in reality, it's no more hazardous than brushing your teeth.<eos> The bullet is never placed in the gun's chamber, you see?<eos> It is palmed, and then a slug is hidden beneath the magician's tongue.
When I heard that Claude had choked, I didn't believe it.<eos> I got referred to a cop and I told him that Claude was the master at the catch.<eos> Even better than me.<eos> I figured someone must have messed with his bullet.<eos> Sprayed Teflon on it to make it harder to manipulate or poisoned it somehow.
Even the brain of a cockroach has a bigger importance and meaning on earth.<eos> All the way down to the smallest details.<eos> And I...<eos> I just can't believe that all this is a coincidence.<eos> If religion is so good, why does it divide society?
There is something about the simplicity of breasts which the genital transformation does not have.<eos> Genital transformation is, to me, a little scary, because it involves a revolution...<eos> It is almost a battle fought in a region, both to go from man to woman and from woman to man.<eos> Why is your experience public?<eos> -Why is it happening on a stage?
It was a big blow to him.<eos> But he got in a car accident three years ago.<eos> He couldn't get a transfusion and died.<eos> His blood type is MkMk.<eos> It's a rare blood type and only about 20 people in Korea have it.
And they're in plastic bags.<eos> And that's typical pedophile.<eos> A pedophile cannot separate with his collection.<eos> He can't do it.<eos> Even though he knows he can't get to it, he knows it's there.
"You know, we would really like to have Dr. Spitz come to the scene with us."<eos> And what would I do when I get there?<eos> I would look over the body.<eos> I would tell the photographer of the police,<eos> "Why don't you take a picture of the body as it is here?
They would have just been pieces of paper in a folder.<eos> So, there's a Jane Roe and a Jane Doe v. Maskell and all.<eos> Somewhere in these records, it says that documents from the dig... were shown to the judge privately in chambers.<eos> The cover here says "With one box of exhibits."<eos> Now, we would've loved to see the exhibits, but they say it's just gone. It's not there.
So, why would you have gotten her a green birthstone, which is August?<eos> I don't have the slightest idea.<eos> We know Sister Cathy was out buying a present for her sister.<eos> And that, a month later, you gave this necklace to your wife.<eos> Did you show it to Cathy's sister?
Why, I'd rather see the boardwalk destroyed than sell it you.<eos> Yeah, how do we know it wasn't you responsible for that pirate attack?<eos> Oh, oh, that's rich.<eos> Me, sabotaging my own business the day before I open my brand-new roller coaster.<eos> It's called the Blowout Blizzard.
Yeah, how do we know it wasn't you responsible for that pirate attack?<eos> Oh, oh, that's rich.<eos> Me, sabotaging my own business the day before I open my brand-new roller coaster.<eos> It's called the Blowout Blizzard.<eos> You'll love it, it goes up, down, around, you name it.
Oh, oh, that's rich.<eos> Me, sabotaging my own business the day before I open my brand-new roller coaster.<eos> It's called the Blowout Blizzard.<eos> You'll love it, it goes up, down, around, you name it.<eos> It's even got a loop.
You took the words right out of my mouth!<eos> Try, if you will, to picture our vision.<eos> We start by adding a few more portholes along this wall, give it a light, airy feel.<eos> Moving on, we were thinking we could paint this wall over here a fun color.<eos> Yeah, really make it pop!
- (TOMMIE) Look at all them sparklers.<eos> (BOTH) Wow!<eos> By my estimation there should be enough there to rebuild the boardwalk.<eos> But the Holdouts already sold the boardwalk to Mr. Monkfish.<eos> Ah, go ahead and take it back.
And she was like:<eos> It really is the great unifier.<eos> But she is right.<eos> Abortion does kill, like, your whole day.<eos> It literally sucks the life out of you.
- Yeah, well, I'm not looking to make a spot on the payroll for someone whose only skill set is crossing lines.<eos> - You mean when you cross them so well yourself.<eos> - Like I said, Ms. Cromwell, I got a lot on my plate.<eos> - Give me a Macallan, neat.<eos> - The way Lockwood stock shot up, why not make it a double?
How did you get this number?<eos> I'll just go somewhere a little quieter.<eos> How much quiet does she need?<eos> Excuse me.<eos> If a number says it's unknown, does that mean it's from America?
- Do you have to be a geek on the outside?<eos> - Excuse me?<eos> - That hoodie, for example.<eos> - What's wrong with it?<eos> It's warm, light, slightly mysterious.
See you at school, Paige.<eos> Those buttered noodles do sound pretty good. Shh!<eos> Quiet!<eos> I've learned a lot about love this year.<eos> It can be very complicated.
They don't have dances.<eos> Actually, some birds do dance, and there are some ridiculous dances.<eos> Okay, I'm sorry to be short, but I have a lot of people counting on me out there.<eos> So, what's the point?<eos> I wanted to make all this girlfriend stuff simple, but it's not simple.
Living in Antarctica can be chilly.<eos> As Antarctic winter descends the ice continues to grow, effectively doubling the size of the continent.<eos> Doubling it!<eos> In this way, the cold creates matter.<eos> It has presence. It takes up space.
Chapter eight... photosynthesis.<eos> Who's excited?<eos> You guys all read this last night in your...<eos> When a lobster gets too large for its shell, it molts.<eos> When a snake is feeling a growth spurt, it sheds.
That's not in the rules.<eos> It's okay, isn't it, Cat?<eos> It ran away.<eos> Do you think that cat came here by accident?<eos> Of course it did.
Oh, yeah. I get it.<eos> I have a wife, so...<eos> You take all the time you need.<eos> I don't always love new things, but that's just a smart survival instinct.<eos> Do you think that a bearded seal would last very long if it said, "Well, I've never seen that animal before with the sharp teeth and beautiful white fur.
Hi, Sam.<eos> That's my sweatshirt.<eos> You're wearing my sweatshirt.<eos> When I was locked in your closet, I got cold, so I put it on.<eos> But it was so cute and cozy that I decided to steal it.
They may need our help.<eos> We could send a probe over to it, see if we can get some kind of idea what this thing is?<eos> Do it.<eos> The energy shows no signs of radioactive decay and it's not thermal.<eos> [Hunk] It's not gravitational, our probe is steady on course, and the light is radiating out, not in, like it would in a black hole.
We have no idea what is out there.<eos> The ancients thought that lightning was shot from the bows of the gods until science proved otherwise.<eos> We must always push into dangerous territory in pursuit of knowledge.<eos> [Coran] King Alfor and Honerva erected a particle barrier around the crater, containing the creatures.<eos> But it wouldn't hold forever.
Like some of the students.<eos> Sometimes I amaze myself at what I might have done... Son?<eos> ...had I not gone off to Egypt.<eos> Son, are you all right?<eos> Your hand, it's very warm.
Your mother's a whore.<eos> Your father's a liar.<eos> And the floors of your house are dirt.<eos> Your cause is lost.<eos> Every day and every hour it's lost, and you know it.
- Because I told him.<eos> Dinner's ready.<eos> I see you two are getting along.<eos> How's that sauce?<eos> It's fine.
- There's...<eos> It really only...<eos> It only touched me a little. A little!<eos> So, could you open the door?<eos> Open it!
Tiny. Momentary specks within an indifferent universe.<eos> Yes.<eos> You see.<eos> You see what we're doing.<eos> The world is not what it ought to be.
She was complicated.<eos> Complicated?<eos> The dark dimension is volatile.<eos> Dangerous.<eos> What if it overtook her?
What? El Dorado?<eos> No, gentlemen!<eos> - I call it "Zed."<eos> The ultimate piece of the human puzzle!<eos> It is there and we must find it!
Your eyes were affected, but they are very confident that your sight shall return.<eos> The rest of the men?<eos> - Costin?<eos> - Mr. Costin was unharmed.<eos> You'll brigade suffered many losses, but it was the only one that did not retreat.
Hello, hi.<eos> We're set for the final review of your tenure case on Thursday.<eos> Great.<eos> But I saw that you had a recommendation letter from Dr. Branum at Princeton.<eos> Their science department is really not what it used to be.
Their science department is really not what it used to be.<eos> And I would consider getting a referral from a more prestigious college.<eos> More prestigious than Princeton?<eos> Yes.<eos> You see, I think you're an asset to modern physics, but I would hate to see you throw it down the drain.
Well, you said "let's," so...<eos> - Oh, my God.<eos> Just pull the...<eos> - We're wasting time.<eos> Just close the door behind you, it'll lock!
Yeah, it works.<eos> I just haven't had the appropriate proximity to an entity for it to work.<eos> Strange reading here.<eos> Ma'am, can you tell us where you got the world's tiniest bow tie?<eos> It came with the shirt.
- Thank you for requesting this.<eos> - I...<eos> Why don't I see ghosts flying around everywhere?<eos> The barrier stops them.<eos> It's the last line of defense betwixt the worlds of the living and the dead.
- So it's hard to put the cat back in.<eos> - It's not impossible.<eos> - But that's why they have that saying.<eos> - It's a nonsense saying.<eos> If the cat is outta the bag, you can't put it back in!
What's "ley lines"?<eos> It's a hidden network of energy lines that run across the Earth.<eos> It's a current of supernatural energy.<eos> Supposedly, if you look at sacred sites and weird events all over the world, and connect them with lines where they intersect, it's an unusually powerful spot.<eos> Abby and I just dismissed this theory because it just seemed too random to have any merit.
Just take the stairs down and get him out.<eos> Hey, stop right there!<eos> Shut it down!<eos> The Ghostbusters.<eos> Look, I think it's great you found yourself a little hobby, and I'm sure, on paper, flooding New York City with ghosts seemed like a great idea, but we happen to like the world the way it is.
I see things that no one else does.<eos> And for it, I am rewarded with nothing but scorn and mockery.<eos> Luckily, I am not the only one seeking revenge.<eos> Behind these are millions of souls, souls which have been cast aside.<eos> Souls who see the world as it truly is, as garbage.
And she appeared to be in a canoe.<eos> You know what, I want to make a toast.<eos> - Here we go.<eos> - Here we go.<eos> Physics is the study of the movement of bodies in space, and it can unlock the mysteries of the universe.
You know what, I want to make a toast.<eos> - Here we go.<eos> - Here we go.<eos> Physics is the study of the movement of bodies in space, and it can unlock the mysteries of the universe.<eos> But it cannot answer the essential question of what is our purpose here.
- No.<eos> All those girls ever did was look for boyfriends.<eos> And this is a great thing, because now you can focus on your career.<eos> What?<eos> No! I put myself out, into the world, and it completely rejected me.
Marriage!<eos> The end of spontaneous sex, traveling by yourself and buying whatever you want without having to ask permission, right?<eos> Marriage!<eos> Congratulations, good luck with it.<eos> I hope it lasts.
That just...<eos> That just fell off.<eos> I think I'm gonna take it.<eos> This place is dangerous.<eos> It's perfect.
Sorry, "the Prince."<eos> "Then, he leaned in to kiss her, and finally said..."<eos> Oh, that's rich.<eos> How does the story end?<eos> I'll tell you how it ends.
Then his buddies are gonna want to help out.<eos> I'll need to defend myself. Things will escalate.<eos> That's what these things do.<eos> They escalate. And violence... makes violence.<eos> It makes nothing much at all.
And I'll be the only writer to ever travel to a colony world and come back. I'll have a story no one else can tell.<eos> What story?<eos> Humanity's flight to the stars. The greatest migration in human history.<eos> It's the biggest story there is.<eos> But you won't know any of the people who are reading it.
Come on, Max.<eos> Let's get up.<eos> Maxy, you can't deny how good it feels.<eos> Max, we must avoid the claw.<eos> It takes your energy and weakens our armor.
Tragic. But a promise fulfilled.<eos> A debt collected.<eos> Don't you dare say her name.<eos> Ah, family is truly the only real heaven you'll ever know.<eos> I'm gonna find out what you're doing, I promise, and I'm gonna burn it to the fucking ground.
Come on.<eos> Shit!<eos> Shit!<eos> Shit!<eos> It's stuck!
He would jump out.<eos> Better chance of surviving a fall than a crash.<eos> Wouldn't the fall kill you before the crash?<eos> It depends on the height and how you land.<eos> There's a story, and I don't know how true it is, of an assassin so deadly that he eliminated over 30 high-value targets in his short career.
Yes, they know about it.<eos> Mom, I'm not gonna get fired.<eos> I'm not gonna lose my benefits, Mom. It's-<eos> Would you please look at the site?<eos> What do you mean, it's not there?
I'm coming across!<eos> Derek!<eos> Heat is a temporal construct of the mind.<eos> Yes.<eos> It doesn't exist.
Awesome.<eos> Tommy likee.<eos> Hey, idiots!<eos> Maybe this will get your attention!<eos> I've got a bomb in my hand and it's armed!
That's so complicated.<eos> I... I don't know.<eos> I just think that everything in the White House should be the best.<eos> And if it's an American company that you can help, I like to do that.<eos> If it's not... Just as long as it's the best.
I know what you're looking for.<eos> I'm sorry?<eos> A moment-by-moment account.<eos> That's what you came here for, isn't it?<eos> You want me to describe the sound the bullet made when it collided with my husband's skull.
I was scared for you. I still am. But I never thought it was vanity.<eos> You know, that's what Jack called all this.<eos> When he saw what we were spending, he said,<eos> "Your little vanity project "is going to bankrupt the federal government."<eos> People need their history. It gives them strength.
And you?<eos> Do you believe you did him justice?<eos> I believe that the characters we read about on the page end up being more real than the men who stand beside us.<eos> I should have guessed it was too much to ask that we grow old together, see our children grow up.<eos> The darkness may never go away, but it won't always be this heavy.
They inspired us to rise from the ashes... as one people of one world.<eos> For 20 years, the world has seen no armed conflict.<eos> Nations have put their petty differences aside.<eos> United, we rebuilt our families, our cities and our lives.<eos> The fusion of human and alien technology... not only enabled us to defy gravity and travel with unimaginable speed... it also made our planet, finally, safe again.
All tugs, take evasive action.<eos> Pull back!<eos> Pull back!<eos> - Charlie!<eos> It's gonna crush the base!
This just came in from Hubble.<eos> There's some kind of force pulling at Saturn's rings.<eos> Holy Christ!<eos> What about our defense base there?<eos> It's gone.
I might never come up for air.<eos> I might never come up for air.<eos> And your smile...<eos> The sun itself turns jealous... And refuses to come out from behind the clouds...<eos> Knowing it cannot shine half as bright.
It's too big! It'll tear you in half!<eos> Oh, you'd be amazed what I could fit in here.<eos> What the fuck is going on with these two?<eos> Maybe I'll really mix it up. Stick a tube of toothpaste in there, huh?<eos> - Squeeze it all over my face.
I'm not messing with you. Hey! Stop doing that!<eos> Hey, idiot, I'm looking right at you.<eos> I saw that! You whispered to the farty cheese lady. Well...<eos> Don't make me pull rank, Clay.<eos> It is canceled.
Because no one's going to be at our Chicago house for two weeks.<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> I'll find you. But, hey, do Santy a favor, will you?<eos> You know the address of where you're not gonna be?<eos> Write it down on a piece of paper and bring it back to Santy, will you?
Mr. Taylor, I'm Dr. Jones.<eos> What happened?<eos> Your wife's mother, she said that somehow a snake got into the house.<eos> A...<eos> By the time the paramedics got there, it was gone.
That's funny you mention prophecy.<eos> I just had a prophecy.<eos> Oh, hold on a second.<eos> In this prophecy, Petey and I go to the bar and we drink more alcohol.<eos> And look, it's coming true!
Jesus, you're bringing this up now?<eos> The affair didn't mean anything.<eos> And it's not who I am anymore.<eos> Well, I'm still who I am.<eos> And it meant something to me.
I said, I think you're wrong.<eos> So are you gonna tell me that it's what's inside that counts?<eos> Yeah, that's exactly what I think.<eos> Well, I think that if she wasn't beautiful, you wouldn't have even stopped to look.<eos> Beauty isn't everything. It's the only thing.
But that was under the old prince.<eos> He was a man of honour. He was like Misha, like me.<eos> But now his son, the new prince, he's a traitor of traitors.<eos> He sold out the Vory to the state, made a deal with the Kremlin.<eos> When the mafia cleans up its act, it becomes legitimate and everybody makes money with each other.
- What kind of problem?<eos> - It's Chinese.<eos> Chinese, bro?<eos> What does that even mean, Chinese?<eos> It means it's from China.
You too.<eos> Bashkim told me a little about your situation.<eos> Yeah, look, to put it simply, we have a weight problem.<eos> We're shipping a large quantity of ammunition from Albania to Afghanistan.<eos> Right now, it's packed in heavy tins inside big wooden crates.
Mmm-hmm.<eos> I love you so much, Iz.<eos> What happened to your nose?<eos> I was kidnapped by Albanian gangsters.<eos> - I think it's broken.
We follow the lights onshore, follow all the lights onshore.<eos> Well, we are in your hands, Cap'n.<eos> Listen up.<eos> I'm puttin' the sea behind us.<eos> Just let it push us along, till we land up somewhere.
"We all got our reasons to do crazy, reckless things in life."<eos> "Mostly, they don't help you none,"<eos> "not when you're left picking up the pieces."<eos> "But if the reason's love," "then maybe it's not so crazy" "'cause people believe in love."<eos> "You know, it keeps the world turning."
All the information's right here.<eos> ED:<eos> Okay, well, well, look.<eos> This all came to my attention only last week.<eos> Now, a junior cost accountant stuck her nose where it didn't belong, and obviously had no idea what she was looking at.
Well, initially he was just stealing in garden-variety tax evasion, but then he came up with a better idea.<eos> You see, by taking his own money, stealing it, and putting it back on his books...<eos> He was raining cash.<eos> He took the company public at $8 a share.<eos> A year later, it was trading at $75.
So, how do I get that part?<eos> You get the part because you have something she can only dream of - passion!<eos> ODETTE:<eos> Build on this. Feel your anger and your pain and your sorrow and your joy, and put it all into your dance.<eos> Live the music, feel it.
I lost them.<eos> It was my fault.<eos> - Where's your tag?<eos> Your tag.<eos> It's missing.
- Oh no!<eos> They're going away! - Oh no! Dory!<eos> What do we do? Quick! Guys, grab my fin!<eos> He's trying to get the door open. Ooh.<eos> It's locked from the outside.
I made that promise to him.<eos> Okay.<eos> Give me your gun.<eos> Get up.<eos> Point it at my chest.
I saved you.<eos> I was wrong.<eos> They're wrong.<eos> Love's not a trick.<eos> It's real.
Well, he did.<eos> Fuck him, okay?<eos> I love you.<eos> You think love's so easy.<eos> It can be.
Never feeling the sun or the rain on their little faces.<eos> These children were...<eos> Disappointments.<eos> Their time on this Earth was frequently brief, God willing.<eos> Then when it was over, they were buried. Discreetly.
One phone call and you're on a phantom flight to the middle of nowhere, off the grid.<eos> You would not be missed.<eos> It wasn't my bag.<eos> I swear to God.<eos> Whose was it?
You didn't know.<eos> Well, he's promised to another.<eos> He does not love her.<eos> Their engagement is sealed.<eos> It cannot be broken.
Yes.<eos> Tell me your name.<eos> Tull. Tull.<eos> Love is a lie.<eos> It is a trick played by the cruel on the foolish and the weak.
This takes us to the northern road. Leads direct to Sanctuary.<eos> Don't need to be a Huntsman to know that.<eos> Hey, Nion, who am I?<eos> I'm talking to the dirt.<eos> I hear it speak to me.
That's where they would've made camp.<eos> That's where we're going to find them.<eos> Obviously...<eos> The dirt is talking to me again.<eos> What's it saying?
- Watch your feet.<eos> - Move to the side.<eos> Lift.<eos> This bridge is wobbling!<eos> - it is obviously wobbling.
Have you forgotten the ones who loved you?<eos> Your mothers, your fathers.<eos> What law did they break?<eos> Love does not make you weak.<eos> It's all that ever gave me strength.
You know, they kind of have a point.<eos> It's so hot in here.<eos> - Put the AC on. Please!<eos> - No. Can you turn the air conditioner on, please?<eos> - It's not going on!
She's not anymore.<eos> I guess that's why I'm just trying to figure out whether she wants to keep it or not.<eos> I got this email the other day.<eos> I've been trying to figure out how to tell you about it.<eos> Here it goes.
I had my daughter, mom.<eos> She's just starting to look like something that might turn into a person.<eos> I was so scared.<eos> But now looking back on all the lives and stories of others, I know it will be alright.<eos> Some people can't see the love they have until they see it through someone else's eyes.
Few know the whole story.<eos> From what I recall, it goes something like this...
You know how I like magic.<eos> - All right, keep the gun on him.<eos> - Got it trained right on him.<eos> No tricks now.<eos> Don't let me see it.
Of course, if there's some trouble in town, we could return to Fort McIntosh and pass on word for you.<eos> You need to see the preacher.<eos> We have new guests.<eos> They're asking for lodgings.<eos> And they shall have it.
Even you, lackeys, you have the right to equality, even if you do not understand it.<eos> The world is made in France, not in America, in palaces that stink of mould.<eos> We risk a fall in front of the Germans. - I do not know.<eos> I'm not a coward.<eos> I chose the revolution. It's the future.
- We'll take it all, they will anger them!<eos> Don't take revenge personally, the republic will take care of it.<eos> Your nephew confiscated their castle.<eos> - Confiscated the castle?<eos> - Yes. Today it belongs to the people.
Hurry!<eos> - Yes.<eos> Excellent, you are a hero, that you confiscated the château.<eos> Everything is ours now.<eos> - It belongs to the Republic, don't you get it?
You bloom from time to time, you cover the lives with your crown...<eos> Sorry, Collot, Maxmilien ate all the sausage.<eos> And I have to eat more.<eos> - I don't digest paprika well.<eos> It was sharp enough.
Uncle and his friend will be executed by guillotine.<eos> In the morning, I'll give their description to the National Guard.<eos> Robespierre is coming.<eos> How do you like my sausage?<eos> It's vile!
Every day we stretch his hamstrings, heel cords, IT-bands, hip flexors, and forearms on the bed.<eos> I'll demonstrate that for you.<eos> He sleeps most nights with the C-pap machine to help his breathing.<eos> Trevor's extremely tied to his routine.<eos> It cannot be disrupted.
I'll demonstrate that for you.<eos> He sleeps most nights with the C-pap machine to help his breathing.<eos> Trevor's extremely tied to his routine.<eos> It cannot be disrupted.<eos> If it's disrupted, he'll have a panic attack.
And that shit'll trap you inside of yourself.<eos> And believe me, you don't want to be there, especially when you're out here.<eos> Yeah. Well, what if I desire not to get killed?<eos> Well, it's useless to worry about it.<eos> If a bullet's gonna get you, it's already been fired.
You know, they were all just caught up in the mania.<eos> It's a build-up of tension, and also, dissatisfaction and frustration.<eos> And now they went straight into a complete nightmare.<eos> Now, this religious controversy,<eos> I know you don't want to say too much about it, but does it worry you that it's going to boil up when you get to the States?
Contact and ready to approach... Excuse me, Dr. Banks, let me make sure you're properly secured.<eos> You Okay?<eos> Sorry, I couldn't hear what you were saying.<eos> "Language is the foundation of civilization.<eos> "It is the glue that holds a people together.
You Okay?<eos> Sorry, I couldn't hear what you were saying.<eos> "Language is the foundation of civilization.<eos> "It is the glue that holds a people together.<eos> "It is the first weapon drawn in a conflict."
We need to find out, do they make conscious choices or is their motivation so instinctive that they don't understand a "why" question at all.<eos> And... And biggest of all, we need to have enough vocabulary with them that we understand their answer.<eos> I get it.<eos> Stick to your list.<eos> Just don't add anything to it.
How do they communicate?<eos> Here, Louise is putting us all to shame.<eos> The first breakthrough was to discover that there's no correlation between what a heptapod says and what a heptapod writes.<eos> Unlike all written human languages, their writing is semasiographic.<eos> It conveys meaning. It doesn't represent sound.
You know, I was doing some reading about this idea that if you immerse yourself into a foreign language, that you can actually rewire your brain.<eos> Yeah, the Sapir-Whorf Hypothesis.<eos> The theory that...<eos> It's the theory that the language you speak determines how you think and...<eos> Yeah. It affects how you see everything. It was...
So we can learn Heptapod, if we survive.<eos> If you learn it, when you really learn it, you begin to perceive time the way that they do.<eos> So you can see what's to come.<eos> But time, it isn't the same for them.<eos> - It's non-linear.
Should we put it on you?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Oh, that looks so pretty.<eos> Oh, it's come off.
I got a better idea.<eos> Look. Look.<eos> This morning's troop movements.<eos> Where did you get that map?<eos> I drew it.
She needs your help.<eos> Marta, please.<eos> Thank you.<eos> No.<eos> The government is dead but behaves as if it isn't.
Look lively, everyone.<eos> Ah... Wilkins!<eos> Shoulders back, eyes forward.<eos> How is my invincible machine?<eos> Vell, it's...
You will speak, when you are spoken, to.<eos> He was spoken, to.<eos> Nonsense!<eos> The machine, Wilkins.<eos> How is it?
The crown for the Princess Iracebeth.<eos> Ignorant peasants.<eos> Quiet!<eos> What are you doing, you idiot?<eos> Put it on my head!
Well, then let's go.<eos> The town looks busy.<eos> Little bit.<eos> My word.<eos> It's too big.
WILLIAM: You don't have proof to the contrary.<eos> Both views require a leap of faith.<eos> Surely one demands as much attention as the other.<eos> So, now an ancient text is your authority on all things?<eos> It just may have the answers I seek.
Surely our resources are better used here - at home.<eos> "Your house is the world."<eos> We are to hold forth so that all may have an opportunity to receive the truth.<eos> The message we bear is a worldwide message.<eos> It will go in power to distant Oregon, to Europe, to Australia, to the islands of the seas, to all nations, tongues and peoples.
Well, then... (SIGHS) Just explain to me how, with multiple types of aerial and ground surveillance surrounding the area, they could simply walk away undetected.<eos> I don't know.<eos> But if he didn't want you to see him, you wouldn't see him.<eos> I could tell it to you as many times as you want.<eos> My story's not changing because it's true.
So this is it.<eos> What is that?<eos> It's an EMP.<eos> When you hit that S.A.R in the tunnel, it detonated one of them.<eos> It sends out a pulse that wipes anything with a current near by.
Rose wants to hold on to you all.<eos> She loves you.<eos> Hell, nigger, I don't need nobody to tell me my wife loves me.<eos> Cory, go in the house and see if you can find the other saw.<eos> Where's it at?
(LAUGHS)<eos> You really are the most impossible man, Will Traynor.<eos> And the world will definitely be a better place without me.<eos> No.<eos> No, it won't.
I can see your vagina.<eos> Well, congratulations and you're welcome!<eos> You know, I had it rejuvenated in 2010.<eos> They call it a vaguvenation!<eos> You know, it's like a soft silk coin purse.
And soon before they start to fall over.<eos> Who was that girl Martha brought?<eos> I don't know her name.<eos> I do.<eos> It's Ellie Briess.
Of course, nobody believed me.<eos> I knew what people were saying about me.<eos> I must admit, there were times when I thought, Maybe they're right.<eos> But then I thought about the magic.<eos> It changed the way I see the world the way I see trees, the way I see sunshine the way even I see you.
- Ja, Sir?<eos> Do you want to tell the others in the class, which just requires exactly your undivided attention?<eos> I just read, like an artificial vagina works.<eos> Interesting.<eos> Please, take it away.
So, there's that.<eos> Please! If we could have just a minute to discuss our findings.<eos> The only thing I'm interested in finding is the Hall of Heroes cafeteria.<eos> Let's go, Cadet.<eos> It's three floors up and it's meatloaf day!
You better drop it!<eos> Put your gun away.<eos> Put it down, Castro!<eos> Drop it!<eos> It's down, okay?
This is the one.<eos> Right here. What's the number?<eos> 4-5-5-2-3-4-5-B.<eos> That number does not exist.<eos> It's a ghost.
So, no matter what type of animal you are... from the biggest elephant... to our first fox...<eos> I implore you... try<eos> Try to make the world a better place.<eos> Look inside yourself... and recognize that change... starts with you.<eos> It starts with me.
I implore you... try<eos> Try to make the world a better place.<eos> Look inside yourself... and recognize that change... starts with you.<eos> It starts with me.<eos> It starts with all of us.
"Dear Dr. Hakem." I hope this message finds you well.<eos> Your skill made quick work of that cyst. So I want to thank you again.<eos> I've been feeling increasingly energized since the operation and I've already been able to transfer that energy to others successfully.<eos> The only catch is now I don't have anything to blame my problems on.<eos> That little growth explained everything, and now it's gone.
Ooh.<eos> You had an injury to your head.<eos> You got hurt, right?<eos> When you were young.<eos> You remember how it happened?
Was I wearing my watch when I was brought to the hospital?<eos> No.<eos> - You weren't wearing a watch. - Oh.<eos> It was important to me.<eos> It was a gift from my parents.
And something was injected into my bloodstream and now I'm showing signs of an illness.<eos> What if...?<eos> What if what?<eos> Sienna, what if I'm the carrier?<eos> Look if you've got it, then I've got it too and everyone we've come into contact with has it and will likely die.
Well, thank you.<eos> That was not lost on me.<eos> The darkest places in hell are reserved for those who refuse to act in time of crisis.<eos> Dante's hell isn't fiction anymore.<eos> It's prophecy.
Oh, that is great news.<eos> Great news.<eos> You might tell someone that the lights on the Dante mask should be turned on because I could barely see it.<eos> I know, I'm sorry, sir, the Dante mask is no longer here.<eos> It was stolen.
That hardly seems fair.<eos> No, it really isn't.<eos> Do you know when the voice is gonna speak?<eos> Sometimes.<eos> And when it does, does it feel like it's coming from inside you?
Do you know when the voice is gonna speak?<eos> Sometimes.<eos> And when it does, does it feel like it's coming from inside you?<eos> No.<eos> More like it's coming from behind me.
And when it does, does it feel like it's coming from inside you?<eos> No.<eos> More like it's coming from behind me.<eos> Like I'm being used.<eos> Does it ever say things just to you? That only you can hear?
No.<eos> More like it's coming from behind me.<eos> Like I'm being used.<eos> Does it ever say things just to you? That only you can hear?<eos> What does it say?
More like it's coming from behind me.<eos> Like I'm being used.<eos> Does it ever say things just to you? That only you can hear?<eos> What does it say?<eos> It said it wants to hurt you.
Like I'm being used.<eos> Does it ever say things just to you? That only you can hear?<eos> What does it say?<eos> It said it wants to hurt you.<eos> When did it say that?
I can't prevent you inheriting the family estate and my ability to distress you during my life is not the kind of revenge that I would choose to take.<eos> - Father, this is unnecessary.<eos> - No, no, let me continue.<eos> A permanent connection between you and Lady Susan Vernon would destroy every comfort of our lives.<eos> It would be the death of the honest pride with which we've always considered you.
You shouldn't cry just 'cause you didn't get a land lease from an oil company.<eos> Who's crying?<eos> Wouldn't take money from Terravex, anyways.<eos> They ruined this town.<eos> You're talking like you're old enough to remember how it used to be.
Cowan, I know I'm new here, but as far as I can tell, people who don't even know you, think you're an asshole.<eos> - And you?<eos> - Ma'am.<eos> You don't know me, but my first year in the Academy, you gave a talk.<eos> The "long game" you called it.
Thank you, thank you.<eos> Um, okay.<eos> We want to talk to you about your privacy.<eos> What does your privacy mean to you?<eos> Because apparently to Owen Case, it means absolutely nothing.
This card can hack into any system on the planet, including ours.<eos> They have it, why wouldn't they use it to expose us?<eos> Me.<eos> Everything we've done.<eos> Is it real, Mr. McKinney?
We'll stop him.<eos> Where's my coat?<eos> Walter, for the record, I never loved the safe idea.<eos> Oh, I know where they're going.<eos> The next show is Merritt's and it's by the river.
Start with her.<eos> Hey, hey, hey!<eos> - Give it to him.<eos> - Danny, give him the card.<eos> - Just give it to him.
And I can tell by reading this... she loved you very, very much.<eos> When you were a baby, she noticed you were special.<eos> It was just the two of you against the world.<eos> She writes a lot about you, and about your gift.<eos> And how much she loved watching it grow.
Daddy got the best present of all.<eos> Can those things happen?<eos> I guess that depends on you, Cody.<eos> You have an amazing gift.<eos> Who knows what can happen as it grows?
He foretold it.<eos> We request that the sepulcher be sealed, lest his disciples come in the night, steal the body and say that he is risen from death.<eos> That would cause more unrest in this city than all his blasphemies combined.<eos> You have your own guard.<eos> Secure it yourself.
Tribune, see this.<eos> Oh, my!<eos> - Where has he gone?<eos> - You tell me.<eos> The body, was it anointed?
- Sometimes, they bury them...<eos> - Enough.<eos> Enough.<eos> Let's not speak any more of his body.<eos> It must be hideous to look upon by now.
There are no enemies here.<eos> Over here!<eos> You hold the world in your hands, Beneficiarii.<eos> Know that.<eos> I believe it resides in these men.
- What is wrong with you?<eos> - ...stop!<eos> Fuck!<eos> Don't be stupid, Todd. Give me back the gun.<eos> Come back here and take it, Matt.
- No, no... he just sent me a hidden message.<eos> One he knew only I would hear.<eos> I know where they are.<eos> We have shots fired!<eos> Where's it coming from?
I'm gonna put the gun down now.<eos> You know what this means?<eos> It means we're dead already.<eos> Over here.<eos> Kick it over here.
Here.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Activate the head gear.<eos> The left hand activates the drones.<eos> does it do anything else?
no!<eos> That's why he picked a guy like me for a job like this.<eos> I hope you're watching, David!<eos> Cristina, have you figured out the door yet?<eos> Once it's locked from the inside, the door won't open.
Well, you better go get a bad cop... because you're gonna have to go Mark Fuhrman on my ass... to get information out of me.<eos> Well, I just knocked the A out of their AV.<eos> We got about 30 seconds before they realise it's not their equipment.<eos> What'd you do?<eos> Get it back up!
So, chances of beating Te Kā?<eos> Bupkis.<eos> We're never making it to Te Fiti.<eos> This mission is cursed.<eos> It's not cursed.
- Ready.<eos> - Go ahead.<eos> Bishop, your watch stopped.<eos> I think it's a sign.<eos> Maybe it just needs cleaning.
Still in the post.<eos> - I'll fix you up next week.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Yes, the air here takes some getting used to.<eos> It's quite polluted with feces.
- Yes.<eos> - My point.<eos> - Let's go.<eos> Bullshit.<eos> You know, Kim, the reason that your village well story got traction is because it wasn't a bang-bang, it was about women's rights.
After you give us your analysis thus far.<eos> There's this old man who loves this girl, and she's only 12 years old... that's the plot.<eos> Because it's written from his perspective, you sort of understand and sympathize with him, which is kind of amazing because he's essentially a child molester.<eos> But his love for her is beautiful.<eos> But it's also sort of a trick because it's so wrong.
I'm fine now, really.<eos> Where else can we improve?<eos> Flawed exit strategy.<eos> Everyone went out the same doors. No one utilized the loading dock area at all.<eos> If it got blocked, we'd all be trapped. Mm-hmm.
Okay, listen, the doctor said I'm supposed to keep you engaged... keep your mind active.<eos> So tell me the story... from the beginning... again.<eos> The story's always the same, Mike.<eos> I'm tracking you.<eos> It starts with me coming back through one of his portals from God knows where.
It starts with me coming back through one of his portals from God knows where.<eos> I find myself deep in the desert.<eos> I get my car back, and I'm feeling pretty good when I'm driving American muscle again.<eos> I keep to the back roads, small towns, those overlooked places that nobody would expect... one eye out for those spheres, and the other for him.<eos> And like all good stories, it starts with a girl.
- Demeter, huh?<eos> - My parents were Bulgarian, and when they passed away, he just stayed on with the farm.<eos> Got it.<eos> So... I'm still trying to make sense of this story of yours.<eos> Well, it... it is complicated.
And now we cut.<eos> High card wins.<eos> Wins what?<eos> If his card is higher than mine, he can go to his poker game.<eos> If it's lower, he must come to the party.
Repeat the time, Wing Commander.<eos> 2307, sir.<eos> You will take the call and you will write down a message somewhere your wife can read it.<eos> It'll be false information, only you will have it.<eos> But it'll appear to be of a high grade, so she will have to pass it on quickly.
She started out with us. But she married up the ladder.<eos> She became a hood ornament for the best cars.<eos> How long you been away from home?<eos> I know all about why little rich girls leave their pretty things behind.<eos> When a mosquito bites you, it leaves an enzyme that other mosquitoes can smell.
It was the Witching hour, when the bogeyman comes out.<eos> When people go missing.<eos> Matron thinks the Witching hour arrives at midnight.<eos> The girls say 1:00 or 2:00 o'clock in the morning.<eos> I think it comes at 3:00 in the morning, when I'm the only one left awake.
Too hot!<eos> And something to wear?<eos> Where'd you get that jacket?<eos> Um, in your scraps.<eos> It's nice.
We have to stop them.<eos> You can't keep living like this, BFG.<eos> BFG, what did you do with my blanket?<eos> I thought you had it there.<eos> Where is it, in my other...
I thought you had it there.<eos> Where is it, in my other...<eos> - In the cape?<eos> - Oh, I think I dropped it in Giant Country.<eos> You dropped it in Giant Country?
Now, I'm sorry.<eos> What was this about Tara?<eos> The wedding, it's still going on?<eos> Of course it is.<eos> Why wouldn't it be?
When this man appeared in your house, masked, you never suspected for a moment it might be your neighbor?<eos> Who could imagine such a thing?<eos> -The color okay for you?<eos> -Just fine.<eos> It's perfect.
Stop, stop, stop!<eos> Catch...<eos> I think.<eos> You think?<eos> It's behind the other two rings, and I can barely see it, but I heard something latch, did you hear it?
Why do you think I stay away?<eos> We see ourselves as United Nations of hospitality schools.<eos> And we'd like to think we teach a global and balanced perspective. You're here because you have a dream.<eos> We're here to help make that dream a reality.<eos> Yeah and I saw firsthand how the hospitality industry can really bring infrastructure to communities that need it.
What?<eos> We can't leave right now.<eos> All my life, I wanted to be a newscaster, but I have a very dry mouth.<eos> When I went through puberty, my tongue swelled up like a tree trunk.<eos> It's still puffy.
I remember his hopeful expression.<eos> And he has that same look on his face today.<eos> I was brave.<eos> Maybe my adventure was to make a family.<eos> Marriage is not for everybody, but it worked out okay for me.
Alright, Glenn.<eos> We'll have it ready by 4pm.<eos> I have to go over the story once more<eos> -Why?<eos> Because it still needs editing, damn you.
No. Pick up.<eos> Pick up, pick up, pick up.<eos> It's about time you called.<eos> Too bad I'm not here. So leave a message.<eos> There's no use for it.
On tour.<eos> What did you think I was gonna do?<eos> I don't... I hadn't really thought it through.<eos> I didn't know that the band...<eos> - was so important. - You didn't think it would be successful?
But?<eos> I know you.<eos> What's that supposed to mean?<eos> Remember what mommy used to say about opportunity?<eos> She said opportunity is missed by most people because it's dressed up in overalls and it looks a lot like work.
It's not your fault, Travis.<eos> Get that out of your head.<eos> The world breaks everyone, Travis.<eos> The very good, the very gentle, the very brave.<eos> And those it doesn't break, it kills.
Remember that.<eos> I'm here with a representative of the Detroit Auto Manufacturers, Mr. Bergen Paulsen.<eos> And, Mr. Paulsen, glad to have you here.<eos> I understand that you're in town for the big show.<eos> Tell us a little bit about it.
The point is five years tops, we're all driving electric cars from Japan, anyway.<eos> Mark my words.<eos> Look at this.<eos> You ever see the bad-breath tie?<eos> Breathe on it.
All right, Roscoe, I got you, I got you.<eos> Let's get out of here before that damn thing slams shut again.<eos> Charly, pick up that other chainsaw.<eos> - Fucking chain snapped.<eos> - Leave it.
I am out.<eos> Of course you are.<eos> Playing with the big boys isn't everyone's cup of tea.<eos> I will take that bet.<eos> And double it.
A league of fury is awakened.<eos> The women I... We have lied to.<eos> Betrayed.<eos> The women we have ignored. And disparaged.<eos> Once the idea exists, it cannot be killed.
I am tired listening to it, are you not tired of asking?<eos> Until you say yes, I will keep asking.<eos> Uncle I want to travel to the far off lands.<eos> Which part does the sun rise from?<eos> Which part does it set?
Anyone can sit down there.<eos> We saved this city.<eos> We should be on the Jumbotron, not in it.<eos> Ladies and gentlemen, one year ago, a shadow fell over our city.<eos> Suddenly, it was under siege by the notorious villain, Shredder.
- Well, we do have one.<eos> - The other one.<eos> Escaped convicts Bebop and Rocksteady are now in police custody, while Dr. Baxter Stockman remains at large.<eos> Authorities assure us that the city is once again safe, however questions remain about last week's events.<eos> What was that threat from the sky and how exactly was it averted?
My condolences, Mr. Taylor, and my apologies, but there are certain things only you can clarify for us.<eos> How would you describe your relationship with your stepdaughter?<eos> Not great, to be honest.<eos> Honesty is why we're here.<eos> How come it wasn't great, if you know?
Crime six, he makes an illegal left turn.<eos> Crime seven, he resists arrest.<eos> Those are the crimes committed by these two young people that night, and the only ones we have proof of.<eos> What we don't have proof of is who committed the crime he's been charged with.<eos> The prosecution has presented what it says is proof, but at the end of the day, it's circumstance and speculation.
It's good for him to grow, you know.<eos> And, also, I played him a bunch of my beats, and he was like, "No."<eos> What's up, y'all?<eos> Got a hot new single coming.<eos> It addresses some social issues that I think are being ignored, so keep your eyes peeled for that.

Uh... And that's it.
Sexual freedom for all...<eos> 'Cause who you are is beautiful<eos> Sexual freedom for all, not gay<eos> He's writing a song for gay marriage.<eos> You know, like it's not allowed.

Then looks down and says I've got to<eos> Terrorize that pussy Got to terrorize that pussy<eos> So I did it Improvised some crazy shit...<eos> It's fucking awful.<eos> Conner's music may not be what I listen to in my free time, but it seems to make so many people money.
A deed of sasine.<eos> It conveys the title of Lallybroch to James Jacob Fraser Murray.<eos> Giving the place over to your nephew. Aye.<eos> This protects Lallybroch and keeps the estate in the family, safe from the Crown, to be held in trust by Jenny and Ian until Wee Jamie is old enough.<eos> But it's dated from a year ago.
No...<eos> Remember the Cant?<eos> You're an OPA terrorist.<eos> You were carrying contraband stealth technology.<eos> What was it for?
Why did you go back to Julie Mao's apartment?<eos> I'm gonna come clean.<eos> Embarrassing...<eos> I really like her shower.<eos> It's great water pressure.
Wars cost money.<eos> And without funds, Charles is helpless.<eos> All we have to do is see to it that his war chest remains empty.<eos> Let's hope the French Minister of Finance knows a bad investment when he sees one.<eos> If the Scottish rebellion can be plotted in a French brothel, then perhaps it can be stopped at the French Court.
Well, she need never know.<eos> - God's blessing on you both.<eos> Perhaps there is some way I can be of service?<eos> Your friendship is service enough.<eos> Then you shall have it.
Good morning! Miesha!<eos> This is Gwen's boyfriend, Roger.<eos> Welcome.<eos> Magic is real.<eos> And it lives right here.
Yeah.<eos> That's beautiful.<eos> Your father is probably telling the hospital tugged-it story.<eos> I love that story.<eos> It's so romantic.
I got one for Chrissy for his birthday last year.<eos> He never looks at it, but I find it fascinating.<eos> It's amazing...<eos> Leslie...<eos> Anyway this Joey thing... could get pretty ugly if it's not handled properly.
Go back to sleep.<eos> Dad, did you get my card?<eos> I did.<eos> It's the best card ever.<eos> You really liked it?
All night long... drip, drip, drip.<eos> I've had the fucking thing repaired ten times.<eos> You need a new stopper.<eos> Is that it?<eos> Your stopper's... it's rotted all around the edges, so it's not making a seal. The water's going to drip through to the bowl.
Run the truth by yourself.<eos> Who killed this girl?<eos> Someone else?<eos> Or the guy with blood on him, his fingerprints on everything, and the murder weapon in his pocket?<eos> The truth can go to hell because it doesn't help you.
It's killer.<eos> Thank you, brother.<eos> In fact, in honor of this, and you guys all being here... it's time to crack open the Macallan.<eos> Neil, not the bottle from the auction.<eos> It's 62 years old.
I see all.<eos> Yet...<eos> I didn't expect to find you.<eos> The anomalies of my creations are always so fascinating.<eos> Jason, you will stand beside me and you will help me cleanse this world and return it to perfection.
The bullet's deep.<eos> - You need stitches.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> But we can't do that here.<eos> Right. Clean it up. Patch it up.
Is that the only area?<eos> History too.<eos> The storming of the Bastille on July 14, 1789, or Nazi extermination of Jews leave no room for debate.<eos> Be careful.<eos> Debating truth is one thing, contesting it another.
Be careful.<eos> Debating truth is one thing, contesting it another.<eos> When can we say truth is established?<eos> That's the question.<eos> In the end, the problem is less the existence of truth than criteria for establishing it.
She had hoped to know true bliss with him, and this hope made her happy.<eos> Julie could then be happy, substituting dream for reality.<eos> "'That state sufficed unto itself."<eos> This is the power of imagination.<eos> It compensates for the absence of the loved one with a pleasure that is purely mental, unreal in a way, yet nevertheless effective.
It was through their own mothers.<eos> There's a great deal of falsehood in Cersei.<eos> You know that.<eos> But when she speaks of you, the Mother's love outshines it all.<eos> Her love for you is more real than anything else in this world because it doesn't come from this world.
You know that.<eos> But when she speaks of you, the Mother's love outshines it all.<eos> Her love for you is more real than anything else in this world because it doesn't come from this world.<eos> But you know that.<eos> You've felt it.
Music...<eos> Music has been, and is, my life.<eos> Music matters. Thank you.<eos> Bravo!<eos> And at this dark moment in our history, with our brave boys fighting for civilisation itself, it matters more than ever.
Well, she understands that love takes many forms.<eos> Oh.<eos> Believe me, there's no shortage of love between any of us.<eos> Surely you can see I'm devoted to Florence. Our marriage is a thing of the spirit.<eos> It transcends this realm. It's...
It's nearly a thousand, three thousand people.<eos> Well, Lily Pons's voice filled it. She's just a little bird.<eos> Yes, but she's a young woman with a young woman's strength and... and perfect technique, and it's... it's...<eos> - My technique isn't perfect?<eos> - No, it is, it is, it is, but I... I just think this might be too much for you.
- Will you be writing something?<eos> - Yes, and it will be the truth.<eos> Isn't the truth that a lot of hurt people are having some fun? - Did you not notice?<eos> - Music is important.<eos> - It should not be mocked.
I'll make a proper convict of you yet.<eos> I tell the barber, "This ain't the cut I asked for, and I ain't leaving the chair until I get it."<eos> - He says, "You want a good cut?"<eos> Next thing I know, he comes out with this machete.<eos> I swear to God, I just went all instinctual on it, you know?
Miss Whitmore!<eos> I'm sorry, Sister. I...<eos> Sister Julienne is telephoning the Women's Hostel.<eos> That's very kind.<eos> It may be rather more spartan than you're used to, but it's economical and will be safe and adequate, I'm sure.
We know for some of you it took a great deal of effort.<eos> This is Dr Turner's first chest clinic for chronic pulmonary and bronchial conditions.<eos> Hello, Mr Philips. To help you manage with a little more comfort at home.<eos> And open wide, please.<eos> Postural drainage, where the head is lower than the lungs, is a simple but effective way to dislodge mucus when it gathers in the lungs.
Hey! It's not the time!<eos> The enemy is still out there!<eos> Let's go!<eos> I called for air support.<eos> It never came.
Here, Fergus.<eos> Take out the whiskey and the bowl.<eos> Clear the altar and get him on it.<eos> I have to take out the bullet.<eos> It's a miracle it hasn't shifted into your brain.
You want a story.<eos> Not the news.<eos> Not the truth.<eos> Just... a story that you will do anything to sell.<eos> Shut it down!
The bullet penetrated through your skin.<eos> I didn't even think that could happen.<eos> That makes two of us.<eos> - I looked for an exit wound, but...<eos> It's still in there.
I didn't even think that could happen.<eos> That makes two of us.<eos> - I looked for an exit wound, but...<eos> It's still in there.<eos> The sound that it made, like it was drilling into you...
What's on your mind?<eos> I'm not having any thoughts.<eos> Is that normal?<eos> As long as you stay on the clock, it doesn't matter.<eos> The secret to every great lie is it has to run parallel to the truth.
My client isn't under arrest.<eos> - Ms. Miller...<eos> - I'm not guilty. What else do you want to know?<eos> Ms. Miller, don't say another word.<eos> We used luminol and found traces of blood in Mr. Stokes' shower, even though it had been heavily bleached.
You killed a cop!<eos> I know you did it.<eos> Now kids are getting jacked up by the police.<eos> What are you doing to my city?<eos> It's not yours.
The trash bag is for the clothes you're wearing now.<eos> Every stitch goes in.<eos> Jewelry, too.<eos> Someone from Spurlock's will incinerate them.<eos> The secret to any good lie is it has to run parallel to the truth.
Especially when you come to kill a man.<eos> Someone did your boy Zip and his two homies.<eos> That's not Cage's style... so I'm guessing Shades didn't appreciate you bailing him out.<eos> You know when a rattlesnake is at its most dangerous, Domingo?<eos> When it's cornered.
This is Farah.<eos> She's with us.<eos> Hey.<eos> All right, we need to find the isolation unit.<eos> It's at the other end of the compound.
You see where I work.<eos> You know what?<eos> You want to toss my apartment, go ahead.<eos> What do I care?<eos> It's clean.
You've got her cat?<eos> You want it?<eos> I don't want it.<eos> Why'd you take it?<eos> Why? Is it evidence?
Do you see what I'm saying?<eos> I don't think I do.<eos> You're stabbing somebody with a knife.<eos> Sometimes it goes so deep, it hits bone, which causes your hand to slip onto the blade.<eos> But it only slips once, even though you stabbed her 22 times.
I'm out.<eos> I'm done selling out our customers.<eos> But you would sell out your country.<eos> The truth is, we wouldn't be having this conversation if you didn't feel personally at risk.<eos> You talk about a free Internet, you tell yourself you're saving the world, but all you're doing is making it a much more dangerous place.
You better make sure you're ready.<eos> Yeah.<eos> There's something you should know about Deep Dream.<eos> But I need an assurance that I have your support.<eos> You got it.
You won't have much time.<eos> They won't know where it came from.<eos> I'll have enough time.<eos> After you take care of Kalloor, I'll be standing, left hand at my side.<eos> You put a bullet in it.
Do you believe in magic, boy?<eos> Of course not.<eos> Well, magic flowed through your father.<eos> And it flows through you too.<eos> It's in the Shannara blood.
And as you can see, your card is still the King of Diamonds.<eos> What else?<eos> What else do you want?<eos> You haven't mentioned this one.<eos> Who is it?
And as you can see, your card is still the King of Diamonds.<eos> What else?<eos> What else do you want?<eos> You haven't mentioned this one.<eos> Who is it?
In the living room.<eos> At the base of the saint statue.<eos> The combination?<eos> You know it.<eos> Only you and he know it.
Sorry, I'll drop it back later.<eos> No, that's not what I meant.<eos> I was just wondering if you liked it.<eos> A lot.<eos> I thought it was wonderful!
Only vegetables.<eos> 3 times?<eos> You know our supplies...<eos> - Yes, yes, that's all right.<eos> The soup is boiled until it is absolutely germ-free.
Go gather all the intel you can on the lifeform. And the options for extermination, capture, and expulsion and what those things might require.<eos> Sorry, who are you addressing?<eos> A vapor cloud's been spotted moving near the Tama River!<eos> What? "Moving"?<eos> It's alive, isn't it?
A-A day or two?<eos> Maybe you should have a nap.<eos> N.A.S.A. pilots who slept for 40 minutes increased their alertness by 54%.<eos> - Is that a fact? - Yeah.<eos> Well, you can take your fact and shove it up your...
I suppose you could've met at a restaurant.<eos> Professionally, I-I haven't found anything.<eos> Maybe at the prison?<eos> Is that list of prisoners that he's seen come in yet?<eos> They called 30 minutes ago, said it would be ready in an hour. - Thank you.
- Nothing to do with you.<eos> - So it does have to do with me?<eos> I think I'm gonna get something from the bar.<eos> - It's not open.<eos> - Sure, it is.
I'll bet that you told her and then quickly, your relationship got physical, huh?<eos> You wanted Alice, she wanted the cabin.<eos> She used you just like she used Joe Harris.<eos> State troopers are at the cabin.<eos> Nobody's there, but it's fully stocked as if two people were gonna be there for a while.
Don't get any closer.<eos> I'm not sure it's safe.<eos> I... - I stepped on one.<eos> - I'm standing on a land mine.<eos> Normally, you step on a mine, it explodes within seconds, but we think that Korsak stepped on the edge of it and it rocked up and that's how he saw it.
I'm not sure it's safe.<eos> I... - I stepped on one.<eos> - I'm standing on a land mine.<eos> Normally, you step on a mine, it explodes within seconds, but we think that Korsak stepped on the edge of it and it rocked up and that's how he saw it.<eos> Well, if it didn't explode, can you just step off of it?

That's gonna help a lot.<eos> - What is it?<eos> - A lifetime's worth of favors.<eos> What are you gonna do with the bomb?<eos> Protocol is to blow it up on scene, which we'll do once the sergeant's safe.
Oh? From Buddy Jepsen.<eos> Our operator in Sacramento.<eos> I'm very aware of who Buddy Jepsen is.<eos> He told me he received a shipment this morning.<eos> Oh, it arrived.
You will not receive a better offer.<eos> Let us sail on the tide of freedom instead of being drowned by it.<eos> And as a parting gift to our honored guests...<eos> Give freedom a chance.<eos> See if it doesn't taste every bit as good as what came before.
But not in this city.<eos> You've lost it?<eos> Yes, Father.<eos> It's a castle, not a bloody sheep.<eos> Presumably you still know where it is.
And without you, this is all for nothing.<eos> Stand at the head of our army where you belong, where Father wanted you.<eos> Show our men where their loyalties belong.<eos> Show them what Lannisters are, what we do to our enemies.<eos> And take that stupid little castle back because it's ours and because you can.
The city has come back to life.<eos> - You made a pact with fanatics.<eos> - I did and it worked.<eos> If you shaved your beard with a straight razor, you'd say the razor worked.<eos> That doesn't mean it won't cut your throat.
What if everyone starts demanding their independence?<eos> She's not demanding, she's asking.<eos> The others are free to ask as well.<eos> Our fathers were evil men, all of us here.<eos> They left the world worse than they found it.
But you know this palace.<eos> There are miles of tunnels below.<eos> It's got to be somewhere that no one would think to look.<eos> I've heard whispers about a chamber beneath the dungeons.<eos> Some of the servants say it's cursed, but it's just talk.
Clearly we can't trust him.<eos> But with someone who actually knows these woods, we actually stand a chance of finding Eretria.<eos> We were taught Humans were warmongers, intent on destroying the world.<eos> But Human-kind was more than that.<eos> It was curious and compassionate, brilliant even.
They will find you!<eos> And if we're not prepared, they'll kill me and take your other eye.<eos> What are we gonna do?<eos> We're going to find the armor.<eos> It's the only thing that can protect you.
It's pathetic what happened to my sister.<eos> I looked up to her. She was so strong.<eos> And love made her weak.<eos> No!<eos> It made me stronger.
That would be a fine way to end my story.<eos> Your story will never end.<eos> It will be told by him and by the people he shares it with.<eos> And by the people they share it with.<eos> And by the people they share it with, and by the people they share it with.
-Even though he's a traitor?<eos> -A traitor to you, yes.<eos> -But?<eos> -But the port isn't really the issue.<eos> Of course it is.
-No, Mom. Stop it.<eos> He always hides any form of weakness.<eos> He hides everything. He always has done.<eos> But syringomyelia gets better over time.<eos> Even when it's combined with a Chiari malformation.
This is our home now, Lincoln.<eos> We fought for it.<eos> Too many of our friends died for it.<eos> In the ark, the uniform meant something different.<eos> Down here, it means what we make it mean together.
There's hope.<eos> Okay.<eos> My necklace.<eos> The one that you gave me on our first anniversary.<eos> It's on the nightstand.
I feel it.<eos> A lot.<eos> Remorse is progress.<eos> Remorse is huge.<eos> Is it?
Toss him off a roof?<eos> I don't know.<eos> My parents were in evening clothes.<eos> It was cold and wet.<eos> You-you grabbed my mother's pearl necklace; it broke.
The theft at the art museum, the bombing at the train station, the I.A. tip-off, Pinkney's murder-- it's all a part of an elaborate frame.<eos> So he's smart, meticulous, got technical skill and access.<eos> An active cop?<eos> Has to be.<eos> Only way he could have access to a crowbar after it was put into evidence.
Before you go down that rabbit hole, I got to say something to you as a friend, hmm?<eos> You can still run.<eos> Go to an island, buy a banana boat, grow a beard, find Lee, have a life.<eos> Look, I've been working this thing since you went away.<eos> And I'm not saying it's hopeless.
It's the same.<eos> Still, beats my slut mother's goulash, no?<eos> Where are the children?<eos> Ring the bell again.<eos> I doubt they'll hear it.
Remember?<eos> When you first caught the Wayne case.<eos> I know what it means to you.<eos> You think that if you can solve it, you can close the door on the past.<eos> And maybe, just maybe, it'll stay shut.
There's not much use bringing back the dead if they come back crazy.<eos> Oh, he's not crazy.<eos> He just doesn't know who he is.<eos> His psyche can't reconcile being brought back from the dead.<eos> It's fractured, grasping at fragmented memories.
Really?<eos> I saw him last night.<eos> That's impossible.<eos> This is a court order signed by District Attorney Dent to exhume Fries' body.<eos> Where is it buried?
Imagine that I am God.<eos> All-powerful.<eos> I am God, and I absolve you of all of your guilt.<eos> I put that guilt on you, and now... I take it away.<eos> It's gone.
Just the right amount of oil.<eos> Thanks.<eos> You could serve this pasta at any premium restaurant on the Sunset Strip.<eos> Yeah.<eos> It's called farfalle, shaped like a bow-tie.
You could serve this pasta at any premium restaurant on the Sunset Strip.<eos> Yeah.<eos> It's called farfalle, shaped like a bow-tie.<eos> I know.<eos> And the best part is, it's fantabulously greasy.
Don't become some d-bag lacrosse player.<eos> Honey, we invented lacrosse.<eos> I don't think that's right.<eos> Anthony, this sacred pipe, the chanunpa, was carved nine generations ago.<eos> It survived Wounded Knee, and we used it to pray for our brothers in Vietnam.
- Fucking...<eos> - Thank you. I'm so sorry.<eos> I just... I had no idea that our show failed to live up to your standards.<eos> I'm just saying, like, we're making a good show, but, you know...<eos> - It could be great, right? - Oh!
Ichiro Hiruma's insect is the "Sleeping Chironomid.<eos> It occurs in the semi-arid regions of the African continent.<eos> The larvae of this creature holds a very unique ability...<eos> That is it won't die. the larvae of this creature can enter a defensive state called cryptobiosis.<eos> or 5 minutes of burning. It can even withstand a -270 degrees freezing.

You know but, my apps can become very useful.<eos> Such as? My diary.<eos> April 14th... Arrivals hall, immigration line.<eos> The line is... lethargic.<eos> It's listless... torpid... moribund.
One... Why do all these women weigh over 350 pounds?<eos> And two...<eos> Why have we never heard of a single abducted woman in Ethiopia?<eos> Of course the Diablo Blanco Disaster exists.<eos> And it is not static. It is spreading.
I know, but we have to make his fan base think that he is<eos> Okay, so hack into his computer, corrupt his files?<eos> No, that'll just only confirm that somebody's trying to stop him and fan the conspiracy flames.<eos> We have to control the messaging somehow.<eos> I know. We have to get to his computer and send out the disinformation from there to make it look legit.
I'm sure she's just enjoying her time off.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Wyatt's men... they kept whispering.<eos> They said this world didn't belong to the old settlers or the new.<eos> That it belonged to something that had yet to come, that it belonged to him.
That doesn't go away.<eos> But tread lightly. Don't get too close to anyone.<eos> It never ends well.<eos> You see, the past doesn't want to be changed.<eos> There are times when you feel it push back, you know?
Single-shot, bolt.<eos> Simple, effective, reliable.<eos> It fires a .50 caliber BMG. Very effective against soft targets in light cover, behind cars, small-diameter trees and such.<eos> As always, I've gone to the trouble of grinding down the serial number.<eos> No, unless you ground the hole clean through, acid will recover it.
How's that gonna happen if it wasn't his?<eos> That's not really for my client to say now, is it?<eos> He's not a forensics expert.<eos> Who knows?<eos> Maybe it fell from a passing bird's beak.
Okay, here's what you're gonna do. Wrap him in a space blanket.<eos> He's already under one.<eos> Wrap him in a second one.<eos> Make him some tea, or just, better, heat some chicken broth.<eos> Just let it simmer. Don't make it boil.
I blew it! Completely and utterly.<eos> And then I blamed...<eos> And then I blamed you.<eos> It's this goddamned electricity!<eos> It's wearing me down.
Musically speaking.<eos> Well, you did say Mother Hildegarde kens music.<eos> I was hoping...<eos> Wondering... if there was something odd about the music.<eos> The way it's written.
The way it's written.<eos> Can you assure me what you're doing is neither illegal nor dangerous?<eos> I can assure you, if my husband is asking, then it's for a good reason.<eos> That is the basic melody.<eos> It then repeats itself in variations.
_ _<eos> If this wine venture is successful and the prince manages to secure other investors, I have no doubt he'll set sail for Scotland straightaway.<eos> Well, then it's simple:<eos> Charles must not get his hands on that money.<eos> Somehow we have to find a way to dispose of that shipment before it's sold.
A white hotness burned deep in my bones.<eos> I knew what it was.<eos> Puerperal fever.<eos> The baby had come, but part of the placenta had not.<eos> It festered inside my womb, but as Raymond's hands moved over the meridians of my body,
His Majesty is a mercurial man.<eos> There is a price to such requests.<eos> Which is?<eos> The king may expect to lie with you.<eos> If it comes to sacrificing my virtue, Mother, I'll add it to the list of things I have already lost in Paris.
Fight... and we must win.<eos> We're very fortunate to have among us such a close confidant of the prince.<eos> Isn't that so, Lovat?<eos> We're lucky to have somebody to give us an inside view of this holy rebellion.<eos> Aye, but I dinna know how holy it is.
The French have already supported us, Colum, by engaging the British Army in Flanders, reducing the troops remaining here at home.<eos> The prince is certain the French will want to press the advantage, send men and artillery to support the Jacobites.<eos> Oh, so--so the French have not yet committed to Prince Charles?<eos> Always an unreliable ally, the French.<eos> We will welcome the French support when it comes, but we dinna need it.
Meaning the British see Prince Charles as a real threat.<eos> Ye'll join us then, cousin?<eos> Perhaps the British know, as the rest of us do, how many cullions there are amongst the Campbells and the Camerons-- men who would sell their own grandmothers for half that amount.<eos> Aye.<eos> - For 30,000 pounds, the British could end this rebellion before it even starts-- a fair sight less than it would cost them to wage a war.
Enough war talk tonight.<eos> You know, I got the impression that Colum was trying to use you to convince Lord Lovat not to join the rebellion.<eos> Aye.<eos> The first Jacobite rebellions failed, and Colum will never support another.<eos> He wants Lovat's clan to stay neutral with the MacKenzies, knowing that the smaller clans will follow, and the rebellion will collapse before it ever gets started.
Even as a young lad you had the kindest of hearts, Sir.<eos> But I fear the time for talk is done.<eos> We sailed from France to fight a war.<eos> Let us fight... and be done with it.<eos> I will not risk destroying our army... by ordering it to cross potentially lethal ground.
Wonderful.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Well, I hope you get called to "come on down!"<eos> That's actually guaranteed.<eos> Between you and me, my Supreme did a little somethin'-somethin' to my ticket, so... it's enchanted.
If she's not doing events, they'll think we're hiding something.<eos> You think she'll stay put on the ranch?<eos> I have no idea.<eos> You keep track of all of her movements.<eos> Visitors, names, times, the color of their shit and how much it stinks.
What we left out was something that we hoped to keep private.<eos> But in light of false stories over the last number of days about the state of our marriage, we now feel it's important to share this unfortunate news.<eos> Claire.<eos> For the past three years, my mother has been suffering from intermittent lymphoma.<eos> Initially, she had some success battling her illness, but it's come back full force the last several months.
You just fucking really hit me really hard.<eos> I know.<eos> I am sorry.<eos> It's just, laird... your relationship with miss Stephanie is very special.<eos> It's the real deal.
So he knows about guns.<eos> Like a dog knows his own ass.<eos> [giggles] Hey, uh, why do I get that feeling that I-I'm being recruited?<eos> Like-minded people need to work together if there's any hope for change in this world.<eos> Yeah, I think the world will be as it is with or without Hap Collins.
I've injected you with something that renders your body mostly paralyzed.<eos> I had to get that out so that I could deliver you to them personally.<eos> They'll be grateful.<eos> They'll give me protection against the plague.<eos> It is coming, you know, in a matter of days.
Can you control the power from in here? - The core?<eos> Yeah.<eos> - Question.<eos> You juice that thing, what happens to the machine?<eos> Well, it would overload.
Trying to find strength in whatever you perceive to be the things that make you weak.<eos> You know the difference between right and wrong.<eos> That's at the core of all superhero stories.<eos> I believe you were meant to be a hero.<eos> If you look where we are in the world, it's very unpredictable, but it's also, I think, gotten a lot scarier for people.
Fuck.<eos> Water is included. Electric would be separate.<eos> Take your time.<eos> I think this place is great for you.<eos> It's too expensive.
Ahhh, if you need to do your laundry, it's the... closet right next to the kitchen.<eos> Yeah.<eos> This place is really nice.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Still getting used to it, but I like it.
- Right?<eos> But as for Tennessee Tuxedo here, I want to talk to her.<eos> See if she knows who tried to weight him down... with an ounce of lead.<eos> Found it on the ground, over there by the table.<eos> - Is it hers?
Young, urban women.<eos> Well phrased.<eos> I try.<eos> Look, I get it.<eos> Love is passion, it's fleeting, it's trouble.
It's ajar because it doesn't close.<eos> It hasn't for years.<eos> The rust on the latch shows that.<eos> And this?<eos> The front basement door, which does close, but the crime scene detectives noted that it was unlocked, as was a second-story window on the garden side.
It's not dead.<eos> Nurse?<eos> Is it wise to administer a hypertonic saline to a cardiac arrest patient?<eos> Agent Scully, we had to confirm your mother's advance directive, and it indicates that she not be resuscitated if unconscious or requires artificial respiration.<eos> She amended it last year.
Nurse?<eos> Is it wise to administer a hypertonic saline to a cardiac arrest patient?<eos> Agent Scully, we had to confirm your mother's advance directive, and it indicates that she not be resuscitated if unconscious or requires artificial respiration.<eos> She amended it last year.<eos> It's signed and witnessed by two retired naval officers.
She was bitten by a tick.<eos> She's had a horrible allergic reaction. Yeah. So, swelling, vomiting...<eos> Oh, God, she had these swollen ankles, it was awful, and I...<eos> You know, you should've seen the size of this tick.<eos> (CHUCKLING) This thing was like... (STUTTERING) It was normal size. It was...
Alex.<eos> - Your sister.<eos> - I have no sister.<eos> Kara, you're suffering from the effects of a creature called the Black Mercy.<eos> It's created this illusion to incapacitate you back on Earth.
But then I would wake up and the voice would start all over again.<eos> So I ran away.<eos> Crossed the shining sea.<eos> And when I finally set foot back on solid ground, the first thing I heard was that goddamn voice.<eos> Do you know what it said?
So I ran away.<eos> Crossed the shining sea.<eos> And when I finally set foot back on solid ground, the first thing I heard was that goddamn voice.<eos> Do you know what it said?<eos> It said...
And when I finally set foot back on solid ground, the first thing I heard was that goddamn voice.<eos> Do you know what it said?<eos> It said...<eos> I'm sorry, will you please excuse me?<eos> All right, Maeve, what did it say?
Do you know what it said?<eos> It said...<eos> I'm sorry, will you please excuse me?<eos> All right, Maeve, what did it say?<eos> It said, "This is the new world.
Confirm.<eos> Yes.<eos> You should be getting back, Dolores, before someone misses you.<eos> Come on, now! And when I finally set foot back on solid ground, first thing I heard was that goddamn voice.<eos> It had followed me all the way over.
Yes.<eos> You should be getting back, Dolores, before someone misses you.<eos> Come on, now! And when I finally set foot back on solid ground, first thing I heard was that goddamn voice.<eos> It had followed me all the way over.<eos> Do you know what it said?
It's boring.<eos> Daddy said we could do as we please.<eos> Ah, my father used to say that only boring people get bored.<eos> Mine, too.<eos> I used to think it's only boring people who don't feel boredom, so cannot conceive of it in others.
What?<eos> It ain't right.<eos> Why would he keep it?<eos> He whacks Allen in L.A., he pitches the gun, throws it down a storm drain.<eos> Maybe his mama gave it to him for his birthday. Who knows.
Maybe you'll get lucky at the tables.<eos> You like Blackjack?<eos> And what do you get?<eos> A different gun.<eos> It's in there, right, the one you found?
I know how it works.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Yeah, well, just in case you're tempted, last night's gun's got your prints on it.<eos> The fuck it d...<eos> - The fuck it does.
Your girl's religious.<eos> Let me show you something else.<eos> You recognize this church? Yeah.<eos> That's, uh, Tsiranavor in Yerevan.<eos> It's one of the oldest churches in Armenia.
And take all his money with him?<eos> She didn't care about the other women 'cause he wasn't serious about them.<eos> Marriage is serious?<eos> As a heart attack, brother.<eos> That's just what it is. A heart attack.
Savage's.<eos> That's why he wants us both dead.<eos> My theory is that the three of you were exposed to the same radiation by the meteorites.<eos> We all share the same power.<eos> And every time he kills you, it passes to him.
Sorry to interrupt your family time, but we were hoping you could tell us a bit more where to locate Savage's present whereabouts.<eos> He hides in the shadows, never drawing too much attention, but every lifetime, placing himself near the seat of power, sowing seeds of destruction.<eos> Who remembers the name of the man who whispered in the ear of Gavrilo Princip, and convinced him to start World War I? Why?<eos> What does he get out of that?<eos> The more the world is focused on destroying itself, the less it notices an immortal psychopath in its midst.
One of the great lessons of time travel is that many things cannot be changed.<eos> Time wants to happen.<eos> Chronos, even Vandal, won't be the only enemy we face.<eos> Very often, it will be time itself.<eos> Whether it wants to happen or not, we're gonna change time, erase Savage's future, and earn our rightful place in history.
Yeah.<eos> You are so gonna regret crossing me in a few minutes.<eos> Yes, you are.<eos> You see, Rick, whatever you do, no matter what, you don't mess with the new world order.<eos> And the new world order is this, and it's really very simple.
-Joyce.<eos> The one!<eos> - Joyce, this is Hawkins, okay?<eos> You wanna know the worst thing that's ever happened here in the four years I've been working here? Do you wanna know the worst thing?<eos> It was when an owl attacked Eleanor Gillespie's head because it thought that her hair was a nest.
"The Vale of Shadows is a dimension that is a dark reflection or echo of our world.<eos> It is a place of decay and death."<eos> Will? "A plane out of phase.<eos> A place of monsters.<eos> It is right next to you, and you don't even see it."
Well, if it did, I... I think we'd know.<eos> It would disrupt gravity, the magnetic field, our environment.<eos> Heck, it might even swallow us up whole.<eos> Science is neat.<eos> But I'm afraid it's not very forgiving.
We searched.<eos> It's not in the loft.<eos> Just because you couldn't find it doesn't mean it isn't there.<eos> There's a daughter.<eos> It looks just like Jocelyn.
You're just listening to the wrong voice.<eos> You're tuned into the one yelling at you over the loudspeaker that you're fucking stupid and your performance blows.<eos> And you're ignoring the quiet one inside telling you where the alpha is.<eos> Now, that's the voice that got you here.<eos> And it's still there if you're willing to listen.
Look, I uh, She's gotta get out of her, I tried...<eos> I-I did try.<eos> But she's... I think she's in shock, and to be honest with you,<eos> I-I don't think she sent that email.<eos> Oh, no she sent it.
- Yes.<eos> Show me your face.<eos> You'll have to meet me in person to see my face.<eos> Show me your pussy.<eos> Push it up to the front of the screen.
Now I understand that your poem is personal.<eos> I understand that it might make you feel uncomfortable to share it.<eos> But take a look around. The Bronx is a war zone.<eos> Our community is dying.<eos> And it's gonna take leaders to save it.
- No. Just no. No.<eos> Ain't nobody going. - I'm gonna fuck you up.<eos> - Shao didn't know, right?<eos> Close that shit. That body turns up anywhere but on the inside of that trunk... Cadillac gonna make sure we all gonna be the next ones stuffed in there.<eos> The cops find it?

It's about music, man.<eos> -I know.<eos> -No, you don't know.<eos> Music is the only reason.<eos> It'll... it'll move you forward and open up doors that everyone says are shut, Shao.
He was scratching it.<eos> That's the art.<eos> We know how to scratch it without scratching the record.<eos> I would never let anyone hurt your beautiful record, Mylene.<eos> -You really liked it?
! I just don't see how this is helpful.<eos> I mean, I had a number in my head, okay?<eos> And I can fucking guarantee you it wasn't 32.<eos> - Well, uh...<eos> - It was a lot smaller than 32.
- What are you talking about?<eos> - It was an emotional affair.<eos> And to me, that is just as hurtful as a physical one.<eos> What is she talking about?<eos> I think what she's trying to say is that intimacy is intimacy, whether it be physical or emotional, yeah?
To guard it from potential vandals.<eos> One of us thought it was a good explanation.<eos> Because if word gets out that a residential property is unoccupied...<eos> - Robert.<eos> - ...it can quickly become a public toilet for the disenfranchised.
Dad, remember, you're taking the boys to school.<eos> Got it!<eos> You guys must be so pumped.<eos> Moving to LA to host your own national morning show...<eos> What's it called again?
You told me not to.<eos> Good.<eos> I brought you a gift.<eos> I used to read... this story to my son at night.<eos> I thought you might enjoy it.
QA will handle events like this from now on.<eos> Is that going to be a problem, Bernard?<eos> We've all got plenty of work on our plates.<eos> If you guys want to take this one, fine.<eos> Just get us a copy of the postmortem when it's done.
You killed my wife, severely pruned my family tree all in pursuit of some goddamn maze.<eos> The hell you hope to find, anyway?<eos> This whole world is a story.<eos> I've read every page except the last one.<eos> I need to find out how it ends.
What's your interest in it?<eos> You ever heard of a man named Arnold?<eos> You could say he was the original settler of these parts.<eos> He created a world where you could do anything you want, except one thing-- you can't die.<eos> Which means no matter how real this world seems, it's still just a game.
He ran.<eos> Never saw a thing as beautiful as that old dog... running.<eos> Until, at last, he finally caught it.<eos> And to the horror of everyone, he killed that little cat.<eos> Tore it to pieces.
It was a contained incision.<eos> Almost like they were looking for something.<eos> Are you fucking kidding me?<eos> You really think this little fuck puppet's coming to get you?<eos> - Huh? - It got off the table and ran.
You shoot an unarmed man, and now you feel bad because you can't call yourself the hero.<eos> Don't you get it yet?<eos> There is no such thing as heroes or villains.<eos> It's just a giant... circle jerk.<eos> I think that philosophy says way more about you than it does about the world.
I had no idea this one was here.<eos> The cottage must've been built on top of it.<eos> But this equipment.<eos> This is newer.<eos> Slower than our machines back at the mesa, but ... it will render a host in a few days.
This is Inspector Bercaro.<eos> Hello, Doctor.<eos> We're investigating an incident that occurred last night.<eos> We wondered if your surveillance camera was working.<eos> It works non-stop.
They are beautiful.<eos> A note from Isadora.<eos> Read it for.<eos> And?<eos> What's in it?
- Thanks, Mama.<eos> - You want me to burn that sausage?<eos> Yeah, burn it black.<eos> - What?<eos> - I said burn it good. Okay.
Not one of these knuckle-draggers can handle a fraction of what you've endured.<eos> Well, I think they got the better end of the bargain.<eos> So, what? You want me to work for you because I have a shitty life and haven't managed to put my head in an oven yet?<eos> You know what makes us miserable?<eos> The expectation that the world is somethin' other than what it is.
Well, I think they got the better end of the bargain.<eos> So, what? You want me to work for you because I have a shitty life and haven't managed to put my head in an oven yet?<eos> You know what makes us miserable?<eos> The expectation that the world is somethin' other than what it is.<eos> - And what is it?
Just back it up here. Ooh.<eos> - This is heavy.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> You mind if we just set it down?<eos> I think if we take the drawers out, it'd just be, uh, a lot lighter.
_<eos> The guy's pump is fucked.<eos> I think he's got bigger problems than a pool pump.<eos> - How's your shoulder?<eos> - It hurts.
Isn't the war costing enough?<eos> We wouldn't want to risk any further unrest amongst the people.<eos> What do you say, Treville?<eos> The people expect their quarterly supply.<eos> It has always been a gesture of the King's good grace, but...
Hmm? Suffering is what makes us stronger.<eos> There's always been something of the Old Testament about you, Grimaud.<eos> Your work is not yet done.<eos> It is in hand.<eos> And if it is to be completed to the satisfaction of all concerned, I suggest you let me take my medicine.
She in there?<eos> Blair, get the door.<eos> Okay.<eos> Please...<eos> It's locked.
- It's just the new boys.<eos> The Pricipal will fix it.<eos> Stop!<eos> Here at Gudbjerg one becomes part of a community.<eos> If you don't respect the community, then it will punish you.
I race cars for a living, but that kid makes me nervous.<eos> Aunt Becky, do you have a minute?<eos> Hold that thought.<eos> The baby fashion show is about to begin.<eos> I call it, "A Day in the Life of Tommy Fuller."
You're the best brother ever!<eos> Um, excuse me. There's been a small misunderstanding.<eos> Max!<eos> That note was not for you.<eos> It was for Lola.
It was crazy.<eos> - Don't worry about it.<eos> - Can I have the usual?<eos> - The show was great tonight.<eos> - It wasn't.
My source at the police station called it the Tug Show, actually.<eos> - He said that? - Yes, he did.<eos> And, uh, how did you get into this?<eos> Into this business with the police?<eos> Officer Jimmy Suskind comes out here with a busted-up cop car, starts fiddling with his pistol, says it doesn't shoot straight.
Darling, you have no idea.<eos> Agent Carter, all hands on deck. Meaning cover the phones.<eos> Howard, you're asking me to become a traitor in order to prove you are not one.<eos> You want a mission that matters?<eos> This is it.
Thanks for coming, Jake.<eos> Daddy, what's the city like?<eos> It's fine.<eos> Marriage is an institution of the highest importance.<eos> And it's made honorable by faithful couples who are committed to each other for life.
The police have them now.<eos> They will have acquired the CCTV footage soon.<eos> But we already know that the deceased is Sharif Zamani.<eos> May I see the text you received?<eos> I assume it's not as incomplete and deleted as you claimed yesterday.
It cannot draw any more energy.<eos> In order to stop him, you know what it needs, Abbie.<eos> You're resisting.<eos> You're holding on to hope.<eos> It hungers for the light at the center of your being.
You're holding on to hope.<eos> It hungers for the light at the center of your being.<eos> It needs... a binding agent to hold the darkness together, Abbie.<eos> He's getting his power back.<eos> It needs the rest of your Eternal Soul.
Yes.<eos> Let it speak to you.<eos> Give it your strength.<eos> Give it your hope.<eos> Give it your life!
Okay, okay.<eos> Saldana, why are we still tied up in those hospitals?<eos> Baby boomers.<eos> They're getting old, so they're getting sick.<eos> When the group reports patient volumes, it's gonna overshoot street expectations.
Andri<eos> Have you released Hjörtur?<eos> Yeah<eos> No, just because of this thing with the Lithuanian...<eos> We were hoping it could be resolved quickly
The case may be, but the brain inside it can only just take so much blunt force trauma, not unlike us.<eos> Sorry, I was short on Kevlar.<eos> Damage to a single bit of the code of the Machine in its presently compressed state would equal terabytes of lost data.<eos> Irretrievable, irreparable.<eos> It's running now on the lithium-ion backup, but if that light starts blinking, we're in big trouble.
Don't worry. We'll find Root.<eos> She'll help you get it back up and running.<eos> Then we'll get Shaw back, start working the numbers again.<eos> Mr. Reese, we don't even know if the Machine that comes out will be the same one that went in.<eos> It might be mortally wounded.
A supercomputer that can think 100,000 times faster than the smartest human is automatically a potential threat.<eos> Once it surpasses us, we would be foolish to imagine that we had the means to control it.<eos> If an unbridled artificial super intelligence ever saw us as a threat, it-- it could lead to the extinction of mankind.<eos> Oh, easy, Professor Doom and Gloom.<eos> Why do you assume it'll be hostile?

Why do you assume it'll be hostile?<eos> It could be friendly.<eos> Hell, if it even has the slightest sense of human compassion, it could cure cancer, solve global warming.<eos> It could eradicate poverty with ease.<eos> Or it could do exactly the opposite.
Think you just found one.<eos> Always knew you had a soft spot for me.<eos> There's no God mode anymore.<eos> Machine's down, all but out.<eos> It's our only hope.
Okay.<eos> _<eos> Harold, what happened?<eos> I never gave it a chance. Finch?<eos> If I hadn't crippled the Machine from the start, it might have stood a chance against Samaritan.
If I hadn't crippled the Machine from the start, it might have stood a chance against Samaritan.<eos> What about the RAM chips?<eos> Have they lost all their data?<eos> Battery's dead.<eos> It has no power source.
And above all... You're my husband.<eos> In Afghanistan, I was briefed before a mission.<eos> Zamani was listed as a "higher value target", along with two others.<eos> The message wasn't sent from the Armed Forces, nor from Intelligence.<eos> It was sent from someone who's hacked the system, wanting me to be a...
Thus, the C-4. They plan to use the bomb, and trigger an international incident.<eos> Would you care to venture a guess at their target?<eos> The Russian Consulate.<eos> Quick and correct.<eos> Impressive. Yet, your former employer might not have detected the device until it was already in place.
But like it or not, Harry, she's your child.<eos> And she's gonna die... unknown, unmourned.<eos> She'll simply vanish without a trace.<eos> And you couldn't even give her a real voice to ask you if it needs to end like this.<eos> I didn't give the Machine a name because... I imagined that one day it might wish to choose one for itself.
That requires your voice.<eos> You think the Machine can't replicate my voice?<eos> I imagine it could.<eos> But does your Machine know the password?<eos> Or more importantly, does it know what would happen if the virus is launched?
Or more importantly, does it know what would happen if the virus is launched?<eos> Have you told it the truth, Harold?<eos> That it may destroy Samaritan, but it would kill your Machine as well.<eos> I'm sure the Machine has surmised as much already.<eos> And it understands that some sacrifices are as unavoidable as they are necessary.
A modem?<eos> A wireless modem. Here.<eos> Comes with some impressive auspices.<eos> Why would the Machine point us to something we could find at Target?<eos> Maybe because it needs something in here, not out there.
Often, a world power finances friendly guerrillas, war breaks out and tens of thousands die.<eos> This creates unexpected constellations.<eos> He moves out, equipment arrives and I move in.<eos> -And the world power is still out?<eos> -No, it changes clothes.
And in this thick darkness, where there is no light, where your eyes can't see anything, your inner eye sees what lies on the other side.<eos> Human beings get intimidated by certain thoughts.<eos> Their lives are a constant distraction from their innermost perversions.<eos> If one thinks about fucking one's own mother, one instantly tries to suppress the thought.<eos> But loneliness grinds you, it forces you to confront your darkest fantasies.
You said you had fresh parsley?<eos> Oh, I'm sure it's fine how it is.<eos> You're looking at me.<eos> Let me get you some parsley.<eos> It's in the back garden.
I can't.<eos> It's pushing it back.<eos> All right.<eos> Think of your shoulder like it's putty.<eos> It can stretch.
What will it look like when we open the tunnel to the other dimension?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I've never done it.<eos> -What?<eos> -All I know is that it would be invisible.
But it's not true.<eos> Hey... come on.<eos> You did good.<eos> She told us a story.<eos> It just, uh... wasn't true.
Some mistakes were made that I really wish hadn't been made.<eos> And it's not, uh... easy for me to say this...<eos> - but...<eos> - I betrayed our vows.<eos> I, uh, had a brief affair and it meant nothing.
♪ Watch your step, baby... ♪ Andy, it's me. What are you doing for lunch?<eos> Approach.<eos> I'm putting together a list.<eos> Go shopping with fucking Kip.<eos> Buy him these albums and then tie him to a chair and make him listen to this shit till he can recognize a chord progression when it bites him on the ass.
Turn left up there.<eos> What if we all found the courage to push back?<eos> Don't wait until your daughter gets thrown out of school or your wife gets sent to the factory.<eos> The history of free men is not written by chance.<eos> It is by choice.
Want it in the back?<eos> Straight back, last door on the left.<eos> Got ya.<eos> What?<eos> It's your place, not mine.
What's that?<eos> What's your stake in all this?<eos> In my world, there are a lot of competing theories on governance.<eos> I believe that the softer hand is more effective.<eos> No one can change our present situation, it's immovable, so instead, everyone needs to try to appreciate the good things.
Let go.<eos> Where do you want these?<eos> C'mon then.<eos> You killed my friend you piece of shit!<eos> Yeah, I'm glad the little shit rat got what it deserved.
Thank you.<eos> Folks, my proposal is simple.<eos> Return to the original recipes and restore the YumTime brand to its former glory.<eos> And then what?<eos> After a good quarter or two, you spin it off?
She must've made physical contact with the specimen.<eos> What exactly was your involvement?<eos> My job was to build and maintain the magnetic containment chamber.<eos> Zero matter does not want to stay in one place.<eos> Where do you think it comes from?
The same thing I was doing...<eos> She wanted zero matter.<eos> She had a gun.<eos> She said that she knew more about zero matter than I did.<eos> She grabbed for it, and it fell.
The man who signs your timecards.<eos> Vernon Masters, War Department.<eos> What can I do for you?<eos> Well, let's start by putting these shotguns away.<eos> They're making this situation a bit more tense than it needs to be.
I can't tell you how relieved I am to see this.<eos> This could save my life.<eos> I-I can't thank you enough.<eos> Ana helped me sketch some blueprints for a containment chamber.<eos> It should be a relatively easy construction.
No one can.<eos> It's a force of destruction.<eos> Look at what it's done to me, to you.<eos> We can change the world.<eos> The world's just fine as it is.
It's a force of destruction.<eos> Look at what it's done to me, to you.<eos> We can change the world.<eos> The world's just fine as it is.<eos> Is it?
We already know that if I get close to you, you draw zero matter from me and become solid, which you can't control.<eos> I discovered that while you were unconscious. Don't touch me!<eos> Just answer me this one question. Do you hear it?<eos> Hear what?<eos> As if it's coming from your own thoughts, but it's coming from someplace else.
As you know, the surgery was very difficult.<eos> There was a great deal of internal damage.<eos> We almost lost her several times.<eos> Yes, but y-you said that the surgery was successful.<eos> And on the whole, it was.
What does the machine do?<eos> I'm not sure.<eos> A cannon.<eos> Something to do with gamma radiation.<eos> I believe it fires a pulse of high-energy photons.
You can't just fire it straight.<eos> The pulse tends to travel on a parabolic arc.<eos> Okay, I got it, Samberly, thank you.<eos> I didn't know your unit was in artillery.<eos> It wasn't.
Homeland uses the same key groups of guys in the same concentration every time they move a VIP.<eos> If we're prepared, we'll get our opportunity.<eos> What about Katie?<eos> If her operation doesn't work...<eos> It'll work.
Listen up.<eos> The signal's converging at the next cross street.<eos> - What's there?<eos> - A library.<eos> The attack was meant only to take food from those who had everything and redistribute it to those who had none.
By the time Ocho heard the first signs of the drones, it was already too late.<eos> My fellow Colonists, brothers and sisters, hermanos y hermanas, if you never hear my voice again,<eos> I want you to remember the words of Frederick Douglass. If there is no struggle, there is no progress.<eos> Power concedes nothing without a demand.<eos> It never did, and it never will.
My twin brother, died in Paris.<eos> An accident?<eos> A heart attack.<eos> I actually have the same... malformation.<eos> Does it scare you?
Whether or not they're the souls of the dead, I don't know, but... When you're a medium, you just are attuned to a certain... vibe.<eos> What do you mean by, vibe?<eos> It's an intuition thing. It's a feeling you...<eos> You see this door...<eos> It's only like slightly ajar.
But you also have to free yourself of Lewis.<eos> Well, I wish he'd let me.<eos> Wherever he is, he would never forbid it.<eos> And even if he's nowhere, hold onto the memory of his freedom.<eos> Put it into practice.
All right. Great.<eos> We have fun together, don't we?<eos> It is good that we can talk about work or Eric, or breakups, or whatever.<eos> My last relationship was so brutal.<eos> It was very toxic.
Very cool.<eos> - A little cold in here.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I just noticed there's, like, an air conditioning vent, like, right above you.<eos> It's just blasting cold air on you.
No.<eos> No, I need to finish.<eos> And what are we working on today?<eos> I'm going to open a new door.<eos> And this time, it's gonna stay open.
- What about the gamma cannon?<eos> - Still recharging.<eos> There is one other option, but it's not good.<eos> We could use the manual override.<eos> Well, then use it.
Is there nothing we can do?<eos> I'm thinking.<eos> How long until the gamma cannon's charged?<eos> 20 more minutes, at least.<eos> It doesn't have enough energy to fire.
Okay.<eos> Is that why you came in here, just to press my buttons?<eos> No, actually, just to press this one.<eos> Tech support left it at my desk when I was gone, and I couldn't figure out how to mobile-access the Bureau's network database.<eos> Hand it over.
Can I have some of those fucking things?<eos> Just be cool...<eos> Jesus, Ricky, be cool!<eos> Your ladder's not very strong, Bubbs.<eos> Well, it is, if you use it like a fucking regular human would.
(CHUCKLING) That was a miracle, I never thought I'd hit it!<eos> Well, maybe we'll eat something after all.<eos> TUESDAY:<eos> I was starting to wonder if everyone wasn't right.<eos> The new world was finally here and I had no idea if I was ready for it or not.
Why aren't you at your post?<eos> Don't do this.<eos> 49 of the people I swore to protect died yesterday because I left.<eos> That's not your fault, Bellamy.<eos> Place the blame where it belongs, on the Ice Nation.
_<eos> _<eos> You're suited for this.<eos> It's amazing.<eos> When I dreamt of the ground, it was empty.

Elevated levels of serotonin and dopamine in Raven's blood are consistent with her claims, and since it's within normal limits I'd say it's not drug-induced.<eos> You look disappointed.<eos> No.<eos> Surprised.<eos> We've all been through so much that... it's hard to recognize hope, even when it's right in front of us.
6, 5...<eos> Becca, what are you doing?<eos> - 4...<eos> - She's taking the pod.<eos> - 3... - As soon as it's away, initiate maneuvers.
- Right. Okay, yeah. Okay.<eos> - But thank you so much, Gus.<eos> And if you look to your left, you will see our famous New York City street.<eos> Now this facade has changed numerous times over the years.<eos> Most recently it has been redressed to be the main street in the show Witchita.
- Oh, my God.<eos> Bertie.<eos> - So everybody follow me.<eos> That's Gus's show.<eos> It shoots on this lot.
I know you have parishes, flocks and temples making enormous demands on your time.<eos> But I'm sure you appreciate also that great masses of humanity look to pictures for information and uplift and, yes, entertainment.<eos> Now, here at Capitol Pictures, as you know, an army of technicians and actors and top-notch artistic people are working hard to bring to the screen the story of the Christ.<eos> It's a swell story.<eos> A story told before, yes, but we like to flatter ourselves that it's never been told with this kind of distinction and panache.
Will they still be going to pictures every week?<eos> Well, we like to think that families...<eos> I don't mean to denigrate.<eos> I'm sure the picture business is pretty damned interesting.<eos> But it's also pretty frivolous, isn't it?
Even though its purpose is to exploit the little guy.<eos> And the body politic.<eos> You're for the little guy?<eos> For the little guy or against, it doesn't matter.<eos> History will be what it will be, and we already know what it'll be.
I'm glad they're back.<eos> For your sake.<eos> And d'Artagnan's.<eos> When will the garrison be blessed with its first child?<eos> I'm not sure it ever will.
Do not make me go down there, Majesty.<eos> They'll tear me apart.<eos> Good.<eos> It's settled then.<eos> The Red Guard will attack the barricade, and we'll end this outrage as swiftly as it began.
Who do you think we're playing golf with on Sunday?<eos> Are you fucking with me?<eos> No, we're playing golf with the guy. I just...<eos> That face you just made reminded me of last night with the dick, when it came out, you were like...<eos> By the way, I think that snake was a cobra, because it had a hood and a flat head.
I don't know, somebody could be out there, Max.<eos> Ma, where's my bag?<eos> - I don't remember.<eos> - Yeah, that's a shock.<eos> Found it.
We get it, you don't like the guy, but here's the good news.<eos> We know what the guys with the guns want now.<eos> Yeah, the formula.<eos> That's why they must have broken into my house.<eos> Do you think it could be there?
But Lizzie?<eos> She's different.<eos> She wants to help people, those less fortunate than herself, while wastrel that I am, I'd give anything for her, because she's my better self.<eos> Withdraw your statement, Coleman.<eos> It's a pack of lies anyway, say you were mistaken.
Not a guy.<eos> Oh... got you something.<eos> Is this instead of the toothpaste? Mm-hmm.<eos> Well, I do have a crate of toothpaste for you.<eos> It's currently at the bottom of a lake.
- Cucumbers, tomatoes.<eos> Oh, crops... soy, corn, hemp, sorghum.<eos> - Garden stuff.<eos> - But you have guns, so I assume you have a decent weapons cache. It's decent.<eos> And your infirmary, is it stocked?
We figured it all out together.<eos> It felt like we did.<eos> After everything, we did.<eos> The world's not what we thought it was.<eos> Hilltop, the Saviors, it's bigger.
Is that all you're gonna fucking say after we find out all of this?<eos> Everything you fucking put me through has been for nothing?<eos> It's the nature of the work.<eos> No! This... this happened because of your pet theory!<eos> And like an idiot, i went along with it! "Oh, yeah, she's an expert," i thought.
Last season on Penny Dreadful...<eos> Do you believe the past can return?<eos> It never leaves us.
Last season on Penny Dreadful...<eos> Do you believe the past can return?<eos> It never leaves us.<eos> It is who we are.
He's telling us to build more boats capable of attacking the Northmen in the water.<eos> Good.<eos> So, after today, it seems I have two reasons to be pleased.<eos> Firstly, Duke Rollo's sound and interesting advice for the protection of Paris. And then, secondly,<eos> Mmm. I'm sure she will soon seek to have the marriage annulled, on the grounds that it was never consummated... whether that is true or not.
What do you mean?<eos> She was brave enough to fetch the Oriflamme.<eos> Your desire clouded your judgment, for she is clearly not what you suppose her to be.<eos> And, frankly, a man brave enough to be Emperor needs a consort with real iron in her soul.<eos> This is more of a brute than we have used before, and it will hurt you more.
Bring him forward, please.<eos> You made me suffer... And now, I shall make you suffer.<eos> And I've got such a wonderful punishment for you.<eos> You'll probably appreciate it, too. See, I borrowed it from the gods.<eos> It's very imaginative.
Sometimes there's no choice but the hard choice.<eos> That's the job.<eos> Now set up the machine.<eos> Sir, you're not really think...<eos> It's not for me.
As will be everything you value.<eos> It's started to unravel, hasn't it?<eos> Your portal gone, the Inhumans you stockpiled murdered...<eos> It wasn't easy to get this number, but this call will cost you.<eos> We're tracking this line everywhere it connects.
This... this is... this is all the more reason to stand behind your chancellor.<eos> I got to go.<eos> Here.<eos> So the bug's in place?<eos> It's in his jacket.
As you know, the terms of martial law and of the Exodus Charter give me both latitude and ultimate authority in determining your punishment.<eos> Do you have anything to say for yourself?<eos> I admire your adherence to the rule of law...<eos> I really do... but these are times when we have to look beyond the rules... to realize they were established to serve a world of the past,<eos> I beg you one last time... to see the world as it is, not as it was or as you want it to be.
We?<eos> I can help you sell this lie... because like it or not, Ontari... a fake Commander needs a fake Flamekeeper.<eos> I'm listening.<eos> I'm gonna need that case, Jasper.<eos> You can't have it.
It's more than you deserve.<eos> My mother let them shoot at me.<eos> I can see the appeal.<eos> Stop talking and look for the cave.<eos> Sinclair said it would be around here somewhere.
I believe... I know you can hear us.<eos> Why are you doing this to her?<eos> Let her go.<eos> I'll let her go when you give me what I want.<eos> The technology that Clarke carries, it belongs to me.
At least we know we're going the right direction.<eos> We're running out of daylight.<eos> We should stop in the sun, recharge the battery.<eos> What sun?<eos> We keep going until it dies.
Are you coming with us?<eos> My work's done.<eos> I'm just gonna put this in the director's cabin.<eos> So, what do you know about this conference?<eos> I know it's small, secret, just a few countries.
Bust these cuffs off us.<eos> - Go on!<eos> Get out of here!<eos> - Give me a hand!<eos> Got it!
Everybody getting on each other's nerves, shit's gonna get stirred.<eos> It's like when the poultry people just stick all the chickens into one cage and they start pecking chunks out of each other.<eos> Yeah, basically.<eos> Oh, man.<eos> You know, mainly, I was just experiencing this whole overcrowding thing as, like, annoying, but I guess it could be dangerous, too.
There.<eos> You make it a part of yourself and it a part of you.<eos> Now, the blade never dims.<eos> It's saying you belong together.<eos> How does it know?
They're in the building.<eos> Stop them.<eos> What that vamp did to you back at the bar... it's called encanto.<eos> That was just the first step.<eos> It's kind of like what a cobra does to a mouse right before it strikes.
The map?<eos> Yes, the map of Helena Blavatsky, 19th-century Russian occultist.<eos> Claimed it allowed her to track demonic presences.<eos> I don't have it.<eos> But you know where it is, right?
Always liked that about you.<eos> I was gonna have Howie and Russell here beat the crap out of you, but for old times' sake, I'll let you leave in one piece.<eos> You know what's funny?<eos> I didn't even know I had that map.<eos> But once I heard you were looking for it, I made sure to find it and put it somewhere safe.
Mr. Hunter can now be handed over to the Russians for trial, which will likely result in his execution.<eos> You cannot do that!<eos> Oh, I can, and I will.<eos> You give me no other choice.<eos> All this time, I was searching for your weakness, when it's obvious.
[Maria] The bench arrived. I invited my best friend, Dagmar, and her worst friend, Larissa, also my best friend.<eos> -Hey, dipshit.<eos> -Hey!<eos> -What's with the bench?<eos> Well, it is to connect and create community.
-[all cheering] -[woman] That's right!<eos> [man] Take down this wooden abortion. -Yeah!<eos> -Come on!<eos> [Maria] My bench!<eos> It's bringing people together!
I say that because, despite our troubles... we are one community.<eos> One family.<eos> - And that gives us strength.<eos> - That strength is a powerful thing.<eos> It's not invisible.
One family.<eos> - And that gives us strength.<eos> - That strength is a powerful thing.<eos> It's not invisible.<eos> It radiates.
Do you see that?<eos> Colors are nice.<eos> I hate it.<eos> I guess I hate it, too.<eos> I suppose it's not a good idea to have the Confederate flag hanging here in the White House after everything that's happened in South Carolina. Even if it is sinking.
Lord help us all.<eos> Now, watch your step, it's slick in here.<eos> You familiar with animals?<eos> No, not at all but I've made up my mind to enjoy this experience.<eos> I believe it will make me a better and more rounded person.
I mean, together.<eos> - Pretend what?<eos> - Anything you like.<eos> Do you want to see my secret island?<eos> Why's it a secret?
You'll know when you're there.<eos> Same applies today.<eos> What does that hold?<eos> My mantis.<eos> Where is it?
They found his body the other night. Near the river.<eos> The whole of your army can be here within a week.<eos> Unless Kaidu has a death wish, he will surrender Jingim and Ahmad.<eos> The Goyo plant.<eos> It grows heavily in this region.
So that you could tear down everything I built?<eos> You really want to be remembered for ruining an empire on the cusp of ruling over all?<eos> I want to be the one remembered for saving it. ...From you.<eos> Rhetoric is easy.<eos> But it masks envy, lust, greed.
Liberty is a bitch who must be bedded on a mattress of corpses.<eos> I know what I'm asking.<eos> I don't think you do.<eos> Hypnotism is a very new therapeutic tool.<eos> It can be effective, but it can also be extremely traumatic.
We need cameras over here now.<eos> A lot of people have a real misunderstanding about what this flag is all about.<eos> Oh, you're right. It's me.<eos> I must just be plain ignorant.<eos> It's not an advertisement for racism. It doesn't say, "Yay! Slavery!"
Um, Madison, there's girl-on-girl action in the hot tub, which is good and dandy and everything, but this particular party is about penis.<eos> I'm telling you, this is going to be the best night of your...<eos> Hey, guys. Just get out of here, please. Thank you.<eos> But Chet said I could loosen things up a bit. I know. I love the frat-party vibe.<eos> It's great, but right now we got to talk to some ladies.
It may be one of our best.<eos> And that is because of you. All of you.<eos> Okay?<eos> But there is someone I want to thank, without whom none of this would be possible, without whom this show would be an ordinary run-of-the-mill reality piece.<eos> But with them, it is extraordinary.
It doesn't mean she doesn't like you just like you like her.<eos> - Yeah, but I...<eos> - Stop thinking this is your birthday party and these are all your friends because they're not.<eos> Using Tiffany gets you what you want. Everybody wins.<eos> Immunity... every contestant desires it, but only one can have it.
I'm happier than I've ever been.<eos> You get it.<eos> You've felt an emptiness your entire life, like me.<eos> We've tried to fill it, but it never works.<eos> I found the answer... and it's beautiful.
The device measures the emissions of sulfur dioxide from the volcano as the gases rise above the summit, and this is a very important parameter in many volcano-monitoring programs around the world.<eos> And the forerunner of this device we had working here in 2010, and it played an important role in the hazard assessment, and it's conservatively estimated at something like 20,000 lives were saved because of the effective monitoring of Merapi in 2010<eos> I'm very happy to see that it's still working.<eos> I hold, along with some colleagues, the patent for the original prototype, which we designed more than ten years ago now.<eos> So, this technology is now found on volcanoes around the world, and it's revolutionized the monitoring of gas emissions from volcanoes.
A doctoral student of Clive's, Adam Bobbette, functioned as our guide.<eos> Every year, they have to reproduce this by giving rituals... by doing rituals in this site and then giving offerings to the South Sea from the sultan, including his body parts... fingernails, hair, clothes... which they launch into the ocean to appease the Queen of the South Sea.<eos> As a part of their sexual union, they also created a kind of monster that ended up occupying the volcano.<eos> So, this hole is where they will give offerings, because this is the site of the sexual union between the Goddess of the Sea and the first sultan.<eos> I think it's coming right now.
So, I wanted to get at the root of all this and see, in deep time, what underlies all these processes.<eos> We're sifting through the trash of humans from 50 to 100,000 years ago.<eos> Do you think we have another 100,000 years on planet Earth?<eos> I would say that, you know, another thousand years, we will be in a very critical situation, and so we will have to learn from our mistakes and we'll have to work toward improving... the condition of our planet<eos> If you had a time machine that could go to only one time period in the past, when would it be?
The lava has solidified and frozen.<eos> But if we'd been here at the time, we would've seen jets of fire, fountains of fire, rising a kilometer-and-a-half into the air and then cascading down to the ground again.<eos> And that built up the cones, like the one that we're standing on now.<eos> And from the bases of these cones, lava gushed out at a phenomenal rate.<eos> This is very, very hot lava, very, very fluid, and it poured down the valleys, filling them to depths of 100, 150 meters.
That took Shepard, took Grissom.<eos> That cannot take Glenn.<eos> Now, the Atlas rocket... that can push us into orbit.<eos> Goes up, delivers the capsule into an elliptical orbit.<eos> Earth's gravity keeps pulling at it but it's going so fast, it keeps missing the Earth.
That cannot take Glenn.<eos> Now, the Atlas rocket... that can push us into orbit.<eos> Goes up, delivers the capsule into an elliptical orbit.<eos> Earth's gravity keeps pulling at it but it's going so fast, it keeps missing the Earth.<eos> That's how it stays in orbit.
Earth's gravity keeps pulling at it but it's going so fast, it keeps missing the Earth.<eos> That's how it stays in orbit.<eos> Now, getting it back down... that's the math we don't know.<eos> Yes, Katherine.<eos> So the capsule will spin around the Earth forever because there's nothing to slow it down?
So the capsule will spin around the Earth forever because there's nothing to slow it down?<eos> That's right.<eos> Slowing it down at precisely the right moment, at precisely the right amount, that's the task.<eos> Yes, Katherine.<eos> So it needs to move from an elliptical orbit... to a parabolic orbit.
How much money are we talking about?<eos> A substantial sum.<eos> Two million livre.<eos> It took me six months to design this lock, two smiths a month to construct the door.<eos> It's over a foot thick.
You have until midday to dismantle it.<eos> But if I try to remove any of the individual pieces, the mechanism I designed will deadlock the door.<eos> You have to believe me.<eos> If you try to blow it open with gunpowder, you'll bring down the roof.<eos> Drilling at it might take a week.
Hey, Sigmund and Sigmunda Freuds!<eos> Anyway, did everyone enjoy the reading assignment?<eos> - Noah's got a little crush.<eos> - Really?<eos> You liked it?
You're fake-travelling the world, you can send your family postcards from anywhere.<eos> Think about it.<eos> None of this is fair to them.<eos> And the alternative?<eos> I know it's bad.
And he won back the day.<eos> The boy's name was Apache.<eos> All Chiricahua are named after him.<eos> This is the story of how the world was made.<eos> Or a prophecy of how it ends.
You can't tell me that you think this is just some series of impossible coincidences?<eos> What I'm saying is maybe that wouldn't be so bad.<eos> You're starin' at a broken windshield.<eos> There's something wrong with it.<eos> It's broken.
What the fuck is that?<eos> - Just fucking open it.<eos> - I'm trying to.<eos> - Open the fucking door, chopper.<eos> - It's fucking locked!
If all goes to plan, he should be on his way to wherever Abbie is.<eos> Find her, Crane.<eos> Bring her home.<eos> Okay, so the candle flame's a tether?<eos> Once it burns all the way down, it'll draw his astral form back.
Some kind of wild animal. - Up in the tower.<eos> - Okay, we've got it handled.<eos> Go, go.<eos> The creature.<eos> It's here.
The creature.<eos> It's here.<eos> Follow my lead.<eos> There, on the ledge.<eos> It's on the move!
Guys, this woman has been heavily modified, in ways you wouldn't anticipate.<eos> Mm, man, I need to get out more.<eos> Are you a patient of Dr. Radcliffe?<eos> We have...quite innovative eye technology.<eos> Perhaps it will serve you, as well.
Singularity is the defining moment.<eos> The point at which a measurable variable becomes infinite.<eos> Right.<eos> So, our friendship is linear.<eos> It's simple, comfortable.
Doubt it did anything.<eos> Always said I'd shoot Ward.<eos> You think we'll get her back?<eos> We have to.<eos> I guess sometimes it's easier to think the world wants you to suffer than to believe it's got your back.
Let's stay behind and kill him.<eos> We need to return to the ship.<eos> All right, Rip.<eos> Tell us the truth.<eos> You've all seen how the timeline is malleable... in flux until it is set.
That place has been cleared out for years, but a lot of Felicity Smoak's projects got relocated.<eos> Where?<eos> Come on.<eos> You didn't say that Felicity's equipment would be here.<eos> Well, where else would you think it'd be?
I mean, that's what we signed up for:<eos> - to be heroes.<eos> - I agree with Jefferson.<eos> Yes, of course you both do, because neither of you understand the pitfalls of changing the timeline.<eos> Meddling with the future is arguably more dangerous than changing the past, because it is still in flux.
No, tell me.<eos> We'd be the two baddest sons of bitches of all time.<eos> I don't want a ticker tape parade.<eos> You know what I want from this world.<eos> Yes... to see it burn.
- To blackmail us for what he knew.<eos> That we were guilty.<eos> And that he couldn't find out who I was and that Laura was not my wife.<eos> Details, Mr. Doria.<eos> I have to warn you that the jury would only believe this absurd theory, if the details make it plausible.
But you still can't tell me where it is.<eos> How do we know it's not a steel cup gathering dust in someone's antique collection?<eos> Oh, I think it's closer to us than that.<eos> We'll find the pike.<eos> Whatever shape it's in.
Sweep the precinct!<eos> Well, the good new is whatever the Turtle did, it only affected you temporarily.<eos> Yo. What was it like being in Turtle Time?<eos> Yeah, no, it was weird.<eos> It was like waves of inertness... like all the energy was suddenly sucked out of my body, and then it would return.
I'm gonna make a super hot corpse, right?<eos> - Perfect for an open casket.<eos> - Camille.<eos> I want my wake to be at Rousseau's.<eos> I want it to be epic...
I called you here because you've been a friend, and I figured you wouldn't be judgey no matter what I choose.<eos> No way.<eos> I'm the last person to be judgey.<eos> My life is messed up as it is, but, uh, I will say this.<eos> As crazy as this world is with the monsters and the lunatics running around, it's still a better place with you in it.
You wanted to believe that the army had straightened me out.<eos> Look. I'm your brother, but I'm not built like you.<eos> I didn't take to the military like you did.<eos> You saw the world as something to be fixed.<eos> I only saw it as broken, so I made sure I had enough to survive in it.
What are you doing here?<eos> Well, I was at home, feeling more self-pity than I have in my entire life when it hit me.<eos> This is who I am.<eos> I wanted to come along on your awesome superhero adventure because I wanted to help people, and the old me was so angry at the world, but that anger never accomplished anything.<eos> It just created more anger and some seriously bad personal style choices.
Mm-hmm. May I be uncomfortably honest?<eos> Well, you have never shown an inability to do so before.<eos> Right.<eos> This company has been flirting with bankruptcy since before you returned to Star City.<eos> And your injury, well, it didn't exactly help our stock price.
You know, in AA, we say you're only as sick as the secrets you keep.<eos> You're looking pretty healthy these days.<eos> Let's just hope I can get back to that place with Donna.<eos> For what it's worth, you're in a tough spot, and you're trying to keep her safe.<eos> You know, sometimes a lie isn't wrong if it's for the good of someone that you love.
Your engagement, that horrible shooting, your miracle recovery-- it was all just a fairy tale.<eos> Camelot in Star City.<eos> Thank you.<eos> But once Camelot dies, everyone will know my truth-- that love is a bullet to the brain.<eos> No. No, it's not.
No matter what, love always ends in death.<eos> That's why it's in the vows.<eos> I'm just cutting out the middleman.<eos> Love is death.<eos> It's not.
I became a person that I didn't even know<eos> I was capable of becoming. I became the very best version of myself.<eos> That would never have been possible without our love.<eos> Our love gives my life meaning.<eos> It gives my life purpose.
I was capable of becoming. I became the very best version of myself.<eos> That would never have been possible without our love.<eos> Our love gives my life meaning.<eos> It gives my life purpose.<eos> And it... brings us more joy than you can ever take away from us.

He got stung. Yeah.<eos> He's having some sort of reaction.<eos> He didn't just get stung.<eos> The bee's inside you.<eos> Well, cut it out!
If we can disrupt it, then we can disperse the colony.<eos> Only problem is that we need to generate a high enough frequency to damage the network, but unless you guys have a portable sonic projector handy, then--<eos> What?<eos> This technology's amazing.<eos> It reads your own vocal emissions and then reprocesses it via digital output into a multichannel.
It's me Curtis in case you guys don't recognize my voice yet. Uh.<eos> Unh! No, no!<eos> Lay down, "Bee-yotch"!<eos> Too on the nose?<eos> The bee came alive, and, well, things got a little out of hand, but don't worry-- it's dead now.
Your brother's way beyond reach, Mr. Diggle. If I'd listened to you instead of trusting my brother, Laurel would be alive right now.<eos> If Darhk wins, Laurel died for nothing.<eos> He feels unstoppable.<eos> Because of his magic.<eos> It's too strong.
I confronted Andy, and Dig walked in.<eos> Probably should have taken your advice, district attorney Lance.<eos> I'm still just an A.D.A.<eos> I'm turning down the promotion.<eos> Because it's being offered by Ruvé Darhk?
You channeled your grief and became the Black Canary, but Sara's not dead anymore.<eos> Maybe you owe it to yourself to pursue the path you were on.<eos> You're serious?<eos> This city has enough heroes with masks on.<eos> With Ruvé Darhk as mayor, it needs a hero without a mask.
Maybe you owe it to yourself to pursue the path you were on.<eos> You're serious?<eos> This city has enough heroes with masks on.<eos> With Ruvé Darhk as mayor, it needs a hero without a mask.<eos> It needs Laurel Lance.
That's terrifying...<eos> And also kind of great.<eos> I think you got hit on the head harder than you realize.<eos> No, no, he's right. I can't hack this system.<eos> But if the nuke gets close enough, which it is...
Truth be told, it's not dissimilar to the plan I had for the glades once upon a time, but on a much, much larger scale.<eos> Let me guess...<eos> You don't think that destroying the entire world is completely insane?<eos> The world is what's insane.<eos> It is beyond saving.
Let me guess...<eos> You don't think that destroying the entire world is completely insane?<eos> The world is what's insane.<eos> It is beyond saving.<eos> It needs a do-over, a reset.
Miss Smoak, the board... Can wait.<eos> Whatever's so important, I hope it's worth it.<eos> Hi.<eos> I like your tie.<eos> It's very... awkward.
We haven't taken any.<eos> Not even one.<eos> None of us have.<eos> We're here because we believe, because we know the world is evil and darkness.<eos> It's beyond saving.
So fight!<eos> Drug me again, and I will kill you, you son of a bitch.<eos> Hi, everyone.<eos> Uncle Lonnie here. See, I just absolutely adore your little community.<eos> It's so welcoming to outsiders, but it's so... structured.
A colony of ants all in a line.<eos> Hundreds, thousands.<eos> But one ant only knows of three.<eos> The one in front, the one behind, and itself.<eos> Until... It steps out of line, then it sees everything.
James Cole.<eos> Why don't you put that gun down so we can talk, all right?<eos> Go!<eos> Go!<eos> Back it up!
He came here to kill me with this. His dagger made of bone.<eos> It's my bone that they dig up in the future.<eos> Cole, you have to kill The Witness with this.<eos> Time wants you to do it.<eos> It needs you to do it.
We need to know his end game, and we need to know it yesterday.<eos> Son of a gun.<eos> Right under my nose this whole time, like a pack of sewer rats.<eos> I didn't even know this SSR base existed.<eos> It was never on the books.
And straight.<eos> And...<eos> Okay, okay.<eos> I get the point.<eos> Dude, even if this town wasn't full of small-minded idiots, it'd still be creepy as hell.
It's clever.<eos> I daresay, if all goes well today, this may very well be how I'm remembered.<eos> After all the missions, this flag may be my greatest accomplishment.<eos> Betsy, I'm certain you are wrong there.<eos> And even if it were it really is beautiful.
'Cause he abandoned us.<eos> I'm sorry, just... we're trying to save the world, and I'm here whining about candy.<eos> It's okay.<eos> Abbie sent these.<eos> They were hoping that whoever took the real flag would leave behind a clue, something that might tell us where it went.
It made me realize perhaps I didn't know Betsy as well as I thought. Wait.<eos> Then it struck me.<eos> This flag is more than simply a piece of fabric.<eos> This is a symbol of the nation we fought to bring forth.<eos> It means something more.
This flag is more than simply a piece of fabric.<eos> This is a symbol of the nation we fought to bring forth.<eos> It means something more.<eos> Just like the national anthem.<eos> It means something more.
Picasso! The fearless lens of Diane Arbus, and the sublime squiggle of Charles M. Schulz.<eos> What you call pablum is, in fact, inspiration, and it is forged in the enduring soul of humanity.<eos> You may know everything... but you understand nothing.<eos> Do not lecture me on art.<eos> For millennia, it has been created to celebrate my glory by those who worship me.
Our perseverance paid off until I became greedy, curious for more marvels held within this chamber.<eos> Betsy!<eos> General!<eos> Whatever sequence the general used to open this chamber no longer worked.<eos> It won't open! I was trapped.
I want to feel this pain until I find Hive.<eos> And get revenge?<eos> I can't imagine what you've been through, but that craving?<eos> I know something about that.<eos> You think vengeance is the missing piece of the puzzle, that it will make you whole again, but all it does is break you further.
I bet you're already thinking about doing that, right, to jog my memory.<eos> So bring it in here.<eos> Make it my bed and keep every memory, every detail right at the surface, where it belongs.<eos> That's enough.<eos> We pulled the memory machine out of storage, but it's not for you.

How could I not?<eos> Almost as scary as Hive, that one.<eos> Remember us?<eos> Fitz and Simmons are working with Dr. Radcliffe on a way to counter the effects of Hive's formula, but that's a long shot.<eos> The threat has to be neutralized before it comes close to detonating.
- Yeah, but it was.<eos> - It lasted nine seasons.<eos> Its whole purpose was for people to watch it so the network could sell ad time, so the show could make more money than it cost to produce.<eos> It did that well.<eos> It was a good show.

This does not taste like dreams.<eos> You told me I would be getting more attention at a smaller agency, but if anything, I'm getting less.<eos> Is this the best time to be on your phone?<eos> I'm sorry. Let me just send this one email...<eos> What? Why isn't it sending?
After all your mother and I did to try to protect you from a certain life, this is not the world that you were supposed to know.<eos> That's okay.<eos> It's good.<eos> Understanding this world, it helps me understand you.<eos> It's cruel.
They aren't infected, Travis.<eos> We're the weeds Mother Nature is pulling.<eos> What's happening is not natural.<eos> Oh, it couldn't be more natural.<eos> The world couldn't sustain itself, so it stood back and said, "Enough."
All right.<eos> I'm on my way.<eos> Gideon.<eos> Was the trip a success, Professor Thawne?<eos> I believe it was.
He's paying for my mistake.<eos> No.<eos> He's paying for all our mistakes.<eos> Well, I got to see the world.<eos> It's beautiful.
Like, maybe that's the show's point, that shit is just pointless, you know?<eos> Like, life, love, and the meanings therein.<eos> I'll tell you, the human condition is a straight-up tragedy, cuz. Word.<eos> Like I said, I never have to talk, and the repetition is good for me now.<eos> It keeps my regimen intact.
Hey, I am not some tumor to be excised, do you understand?<eos> The opposite.<eos> I'm the organ vital to your existence.<eos> Now, if you insist on keeping this up, I'm gonna go from annoyed to hurt, and, kiddo, trust me, you do not want to hurt my feelings.<eos> How do I take off a mask when it stops being a mask, when it's as much a part of me as I am?
What... what you're doing here, Darlene, and what you're saying?<eos> I mean, you sounded like George W. Bush, for crying out loud.<eos> Okay, first of all, that's low.<eos> Secondly, give me some credit.<eos> The speech is bullshit, but it works.
You're a child.<eos> I'm not 20 anymore.<eos> Thank you. I know.<eos> I am a child.<eos> So, that way, I can see the world for what it really is, unlike the way the zombies have conditioned you to see it.
Broussard didn't go through with it.<eos> You're still standing here.<eos> Is that supposed to make me feel better?<eos> A cause needs all sorts of people, Katie.<eos> It need soldiers like Broussard who can pull the trigger, and it needs people like you.
Here, aim one hand at the sun and the other points north.<eos> Then that's north.<eos> Since when is the sun in the north?<eos> - Right now.<eos> Now look, the sun rises in the east, moves south and sets in the west. It's never in the north.
Unless you can't.<eos> It's worse than I remember.<eos> The rage.<eos> The hunger.<eos> I'd like to blame my anger on Finn, but it's been growing worse since I came back.
I called in a favor.<eos> Look, the turning is gonna hurt, and your first full moon is gonna be a real bitch.<eos> But like I said, you're tough; you can handle it.<eos> You'll never forget what happened, but... you can't let the past define who you are.<eos> Finn, give it to me.

You'll never forget what happened, but... you can't let the past define who you are.<eos> Finn, give it to me.<eos> Give it to me.<eos> Come on, then.<eos> After all this time, go on and destroy it.
Now, your boss is jonesing real bad for some Mikaelson blood, and I just want to know who he is.<eos> Ain't no need for this to get nasty.<eos> You poor fools.<eos> I let you take that bullet.<eos> He wanted you to have it.
Look, I have a better idea. A Blood Rider.<eos> A Tibetan singing bowl I had cast into a dark object in the 1800s.<eos> It's like an echo chamber.<eos> With Finn's blood, we can amplify the connection he has with Vincent.<eos> But, like everything of mine, Klaus's ex has it now.
Kol has a plan. Kol and his ridiculous gambits.<eos> 900 years in a box... and zero patience.<eos> It's all a joke to you, isn't it?<eos> "900 years in a box" just rolls off your tongue as if the time passed without consequence.<eos> I assure you, it did not.
And guess what.<eos> The show has already started.<eos> You're gonna have to listen to me now.<eos> You're gonna have to hear me out, because I understand what you're going through.<eos> Our connection with the Ancestors has been severed; it's gone.
Torture him!<eos> Torture him!<eos> Justice... for Klaus Mikaelson... should be a fate worse than death.<eos> This blade is imbued with dark magic.<eos> It will cause unending agony.
If we don't, we never see her again.<eos> Hey, that's enough.<eos> All right?<eos> We all want to help her, so we need to make sure that she's consecrated, but she's got to be safe so we're gonna pull her into a place where she's protected, then we can resurrect her.<eos> And that's gonna require a lot of energy, and my power's not what it used to be before I got shunned. All right, we need Freya.
Rebekah.<eos> Freya.<eos> Why are you telling me this?<eos> Because love will make you strong.<eos> It will make you the man that I know you want to be.
Does it work?<eos> Not unless I can find a high-quality lens.<eos> I think I can get one for you.<eos> Our cause needs all sorts of people, Katie.<eos> It needs soldiers like Broussard who can pull the trigger, and it needs people like you.
They gave us the power to govern our own way.<eos> Yes, but they also made it quite clear.<eos> We must maintain order.<eos> Well, I don't think that order comes from fear.<eos> It comes from providing people with a decent quality of life.
You didn't answer my question.<eos> Am I talking to the Occupation?<eos> No, I am not.<eos> I reviewed the details of this op.<eos> It's solid.
I made it.<eos> Thank you for stopping by.<eos> I, uh... this is really very kind of you, very much.<eos> So I heard the funeral... it was... it was today, yeah?<eos> - Yes, it was.
They lived very simply, and they didn't run in our social circles.<eos> But they loved their art.<eos> They sunk every dollar they earned into it, and they had great taste.<eos> Their collection isn't in any of your catalogues.<eos> Very few people know it even exists... but I do because I helped them track a lot of it down.
After the charge goes, they'll be scrambling.<eos> We can grab the V.I.P. and bring him out through the tunnels.<eos> And then bring him back here for safekeeping.<eos> Sorry, we're blowing up a train?<eos> No, we're just gonna nudge it off the tracks.
We're leaving the colony.<eos> What?<eos> You, Maddie, and the kids are gonna go with Beau.<eos> He's got a cabin up in Big Bear.<eos> It's stocked, off the grid, safe.
What do you mean? What kind of payment?<eos> We will see.<eos> Let us begin.<eos> The necklace.<eos> It's pulsing.
My love, forgive me.<eos> But I need to protect you. Protect?<eos> What do you mean, Jonas?<eos> Are you drunk, man?<eos> Son, no matter where the soul goes, the important thing is how it returns.
I did not even have time to talk, I love you.<eos> So much... in my teens I want to share with you.<eos> Son, don't worry.<eos> We'll be together and here you can be whatever you want.<eos> Never give up, the important thing is not where the soul goes but how it returns, is not it?
What we do know is, in 20 years time, Kasnia is the foothold from which Savage takes over the world, so we hardly want to take him on there, but if we can figure out how his actions here lead to his rise to power, then we won't need to.<eos> Copy that, Captain, but if we're gonna be checking out the future...<eos> We should probably invite the nerd twins.<eos> You know, I can already hear what Stan's gonna say about 2147.<eos> The future, it's...
I'll tell you what, they better not miss.<eos> Come on, you run around this city like it's your damn shooting gallery.<eos> - You think you do... - Yeah, what do you do?<eos> What do you do?<eos> You act like it's a playground.
I think there's no good in the filth that I put down, that's what I think.<eos> - And how do you know?<eos> - I just know.<eos> Look around, Red.<eos> This city, it stinks.
- And how do you know?<eos> - I just know.<eos> Look around, Red.<eos> This city, it stinks.<eos> It's a sewer. It stinks and it smells like shit and I can't get the stink out of my nose.
I think they had trials that next week, and my father, um...<eos> Owen Golly Sr. Sr., got chosen to be Sid the Hedgehog, and that began what is really a family dynasty now.<eos> All right, guys, we've got to go, go, go, go, go.<eos> - You got my bag?<eos> - We're running late. -I got it.
No, Dad, there wasn't just a ladder there. I bought that ladder.<eos> - You bought it?<eos> When?<eos> - Yeah, I bought it yesterday.<eos> I've been working on this routine for months, Dad, and it's good.
-I like your whistle.<eos> -Thank you.<eos> -That's cool.<eos> I like to put my lips on it.<eos> It's like a friend in my mouth.
[Max] This has the corrupt audio...<eos> [Fred] It's okay.<eos> Play it.<eos> [Father on screen] We want chocolate!<eos> Give it to us!
And, once I marry the King, I'll be Queen and you'll be irrelevant.<eos> I know you've struggled.<eos> Believe it or not, I did once, as well.<eos> But this decision you're making is forever.<eos> And it's not just your forever.
At least we had it.<eos> But we put it somewhere we weren't supposed to, so we never told the police.<eos> Where's that?<eos> Up there.<eos> You sure it's still up there?
These are the originals.<eos> Nothing too useful?<eos> No, sir, but thank you for your cooperation.<eos> Your paper, too.<eos> It was on the step.
But this town still needs a sheriff.<eos> Well, I'm not the law-and-order type... nor the staying-in-one-place type either.<eos> Well, we have that much in common at least.<eos> Be well, Jonah.<eos> Nice thing about my world... for you, it ain't going anywhere.
Oh, you're dead.<eos> Both of ya!<eos> Couple of kids playing house!<eos> Watch your tongue.<eos> While it's still attached.
I never asked you to coerce a witness!<eos> - You had a problem, so I stepped in.<eos> - No! It doesn't help.<eos> We can't even use his testimony because of you.<eos> It was all thrown out.
Yeah?<eos> And we're gonna do it again.<eos> Everything's been removed from inside the room.<eos> He's tied down, but keep your distance and mind the tape.<eos> Do not step past it or I get to make my dream come true and arrest you.
- I'm working on it.<eos> - Yeah, I'll bet you are.<eos> Listen, these victims, they need to be taken somewhere off the grid, somewhere they can't be found.<eos> No. What they need is medical attention.<eos> I know, and they'll get it, but...
She should be tied in this chair, not me.<eos> She is not the problem.<eos> They are.<eos> They're gonna turn this city upside down looking for her, Matty.<eos> They'll watch it burn.
Others bloody the streets in the hope they can stop the tide, the crime, the cruelty... the disregard for human life all around them.<eos> But this is Hell's Kitchen.<eos> Angel or devil, rich or poor, young or old, you live here.<eos> You didn't choose this town.<eos> It chose you.
It leaves you front and center.<eos> Finding the Hand, keeping the Black Skies at bay.<eos> Murdering when it suits you.<eos> Believe it or don't.<eos> The fact remains that the city you're sworn to protect is ground zero in a war it doesn't even know is happening.
Elektra works for me.<eos> The bullet penetrated Mr. Castle's skull in the lower right quadrant, or more specifically, the sphenofrontal suture, which is the cranial suture between the sphenoid bone and the frontal bones, both here and here.<eos> I believe what my expert witness is trying to convey is that my client, Frank Castle, was shot... point blank, execution style, in the head.<eos> Could you please describe the damage Mr. Castle sustained from the bullet?<eos> It fragmented on impact, causing damage in both the right frontal lobe and temporal lobe of his brain.
With destiny.<eos> You should be familiar with this procedure, Chronos.<eos> The name's Mick.<eos> Though we've made some refinements.<eos> Clearly, your conditioning was not as thorough as it should have been.
Why did you think I'd be mad?<eos> Was it because of this?<eos> I've found women, generally, don't like a man punching holes in things, yes.<eos> Lucifer, our last session was a breakthrough.<eos> It was?
Who's Sandy? Dr. Shaw's wife, Alexandra.<eos> Her friends all call her Sandy.<eos> Okay, and you're friends with your therapist's wife?<eos> Yes, how open was his relationship therapy, hmm?<eos> No, it's nothing like that.
This isn't him. Then it's a frame job.<eos> Who would want to set him up?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> - Detective, we may have found the murder weapon.<eos> Test it for prints and DNA. Yes, ma'am. Thanks.
Would you back me up, please, bro?<eos> He is right.<eos> See? Trust me, he should know.<eos> No, it's for you, isn't it?<eos> It's a selfish way for you to all feel better about yourselves about how much you ignored this poor sod in life.
Dr. Morrow is dead, but perhaps his schematics for an android--<eos> No. But she is not an android. That's what I'm trying to tell you.<eos> I looked into her eyes and there was someone looking back.<eos> She has a soul.<eos> And somehow it's, it's like mine.
Agent Danvers.<eos> Look.<eos> You two really did bury the hatchet, didn't you?<eos> I want every satellite we have pointed at this city.<eos> Scan it block by block.
I thought you didn't do anything wrong.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Well, I didn't.<eos> That makes my apology even more meaningful.<eos> Only if it's genuine.
In the show, they take kids, middle school and high school kids that are getting in trouble a lot, and they send them to jail for a day.<eos> And the idea is that jail will scare the fuck out of the kid, and then he'll get his life together.<eos> Hence, Scared Straight.<eos> It's tremendous. I'm obsessed with one episode.<eos> It aired once.
Then it hits me, like, two seconds later how batshit crazy it is of me to tell him to like, Google it.<eos> You know?<eos> Like... "You figure it out, fuckface!"<eos> Am I out of my mind?<eos> So... I grab a DVD out of my bag, I give it to him.
You know?<eos> Like... "You figure it out, fuckface!"<eos> Am I out of my mind?<eos> So... I grab a DVD out of my bag, I give it to him.<eos> I go, "It has my name on it, just type it in.
I knew you would understand.<eos> I'll see you.<eos> Would you mind if I used your bathroom?<eos> No.<eos> It's down the hall, near the stairs, on your left.
My moms leaves all types of shit around.<eos> That breeze feel good as hell man.<eos> Yeah, it do.<eos> Sometimes round the way, where we live, you can catch that same breeze.<eos> It just come through the hood and it's like everything stop for a second... 'cause everyone just wanna feel it.
They were your men!<eos> And my friends, my platoon.<eos> Failed experiments.<eos> They were dangers to their country.<eos> I was ordered to terminate the operation, before it got out of control!
I'm sorry, but I mean it.<eos> You could really get hurt doing this shit, and for what?<eos> Grow up.<eos> - Do you love magic?<eos> Is it in your soul?
And you and Eliot never should've taken on the hedge witches alone.<eos> I know.<eos> Quentin, do you really think that the magic that we teach means that you just get to fly above right and wrong?<eos> Magic does not solve problems.<eos> It magnifies them.
It magnifies them.<eos> I know that too.<eos> Believe me.<eos> I don't need to be taught what magic is or isn't.<eos> I need to be taught magic so that I can decide what it is or isn't... for me.
Sometimes, what it looks like is all anybody can see.<eos> Anyway, um, I'll see you at the party tomorrow.<eos> Um, what party?<eos> Oh, well, Lorna and Red are throwing me that thing in the common room.<eos> Nobody told you about it?
-I'll go make sure he's OK.<eos> - For right now, you just stay here. - Oh!<eos> Can I say that I'm concerned about the "stay here" part?<eos> I hate to ask, but if you're going, could you please get my wallet?<eos> I ran out without it. It's right on the table in the foyer.
The librarian says it might be a badge that the employees wore.<eos> It's a woman.<eos> How could she have got in here?<eos> The wall hadn't been touched since it was built.<eos> That's why they were restoring it.
- This is Alain Gérard, the conservator.<eos> He hid in here during the siege.<eos> It may have held the Papal treasure.<eos> We have a body.<eos> We need to know how it got here.
Well, their communications ability is one of their distinct advantages.<eos> We saw that in action in the Central Park massacre.<eos> See this?<eos> This is a sampling of all strigoi communication.<eos> It's... varying but occupying a fairly predictable range. Until here.
"and discover that prisoner was you."<eos> This is the place?<eos> The plague hit so fast, hopefully they didn't have enough time to bring it down to DC.<eos> It looks almost like a small generator, about the size of a bread box.<eos> And it's not a black box; it's actually bright orange.
But the truth is, we don't have the manpower.<eos> At this current casualty rate, we can't push out any further.<eos> What's the kill ratio for the bioweapon?<eos> Around 75%... ballpark.<eos> - Last week it was 100%.
I have waited and I understand.<eos> Show me that you understand.<eos> Show me who you are.<eos> Duke rollo, By the powers vested in me by his holiness the pope, I have come to serve upon you the papers of annulment,<eos> Since the marriage has not been consummated, Under christian law it does not exist.
I'm making myself king of all norway!<eos> In order to become king of all norway, You would have to overthrow my husband.<eos> That was impressive.<eos> I modified the frankish weapon.<eos> It has a much greater range now.
Yidu!<eos> Yidu!<eos> Give me some of that Chinese medicine.<eos> But don't you want to sleep?<eos> No, just give it to me.
He said they were the greatest threat against his empire.<eos> My grandfather, wise as he was, great as he was, Did not understand everything.<eos> Times change.<eos> But the threat of the northmen remains!<eos> Of course it remains, poor roland.
Isn't it a little early for that watermelon to be drunk?<eos> I'm talking about you, Grace.<eos> You're the watermelon.<eos> I'm not having it now.<eos> It has to marinate.
What? No, no, I have a...headache.<eos> If our calculations are correct...<eos> - And they are.<eos> - And they are.<eos> When this device detonates, it will collapse the event horizon on this side of the breach, thereby shutting off any connection to Earth-2 permanently.
Is it true Pollyhop is providing you with voter data?<eos> - The question was caught on camera.<eos> - Did he answer it?<eos> No.<eos> It's getting a lot of traction online.
I've no idea, sir.<eos> I've never spoken to the man, nor would I. It's classified.<eos> And you're speaking from your conscience.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Conscience has an unmistakable stink to it, sort of like raw onions and morning breath. But a lie stinks even more when it's coming from someone who isn't used to lying.
- Oh, man.<eos> - I had the magazine laminated so I could keep it.<eos> - I... I just want to emulate...<eos> - This guy's incredible.<eos> I won an award for it, right over there, you see?
People should know that you are a taken man.<eos> - That's so weird.<eos> - What's that?<eos> My meta-human alert app.<eos> It thinks that you're a meta-human.
- What's that?<eos> My meta-human alert app.<eos> It thinks that you're a meta-human.<eos> That is so weird.<eos> Yeah, it must be on the fritz.
-[Keith] Great actress.<eos> [Maria] She really is.<eos> -I should go do that garbage truck scene. -Oh, yeah.<eos> I can't believe this episode was about race. They introduced me, then I just disappeared.<eos> Well, it was written by a bunch of white people who I think were good-intentioned.
We told a story about very sensitive racial issues in America!<eos> And we hit it out of the park!<eos> Highland Park!<eos> Hope you enjoyed the lesson!<eos> Go out and spread it!
Sorry to interrupt, hons.<eos> Your father and I were cleaning out the attic.<eos> Not a euphemism.<eos> And look what we found... your violin.<eos> Play it and see if it still works.
Can I... tell you a little secret?<eos> No!<eos> Well, when I made a move on my first crush, it went way worse.<eos> It was New Year's Eve, and I went to give him a kiss, and my tongue froze to his cheek.<eos> Why did it freeze?
I'll be right back, too.<eos> Hey!<eos> I just need a minute alone with my husband.<eos> Thank you. There is no way you are paying that bill.<eos> It has been out there forever, and he hasn't even pretended to reach for his wallet.
Well, it was very nice to talk to you.<eos> I did have a quick question about --<eos> Goodbye. ‭<eos> It's fine.<eos> When I tell the story, it ends with her singing "happy birthday." Oh, shoot.
It's all cool in the pool.<eos> But maybe there's another option.<eos> There are none.<eos> As Dr. Randy says, "No good outcomes."<eos> Why go through the horror of treatment if it's not gonna work? No, no.
That was the restaurant.<eos> Have these sent out by messenger.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Oh, if you still want that list of contacts, come by my office.<eos> I'll have it by noon. I didn't forget.
We could run her through the facial recognition.<eos> She had a mask on.<eos> - What was her suit like?<eos> - Hey. - Hey, it's a valid question.<eos> - It is, actually.
Look, if you were able to try to save Laurel, then you wouldn't be alive at all.<eos> Then fine.<eos> I don't care.<eos> When we left, when I recruited you, we... we... we altered the timeline.<eos> Now had it remained the same, then Damien Darhk would have...
So if Savage plans on blowing up the world three times, - how do we stop him?<eos> - We don't. - We kill him.<eos> - How?<eos> We've always known that only you or Kendra could kill Savage using items exposed, as you were, to the meteor's radiation.<eos> Now, the radiation works both ways. It gave Savage his immortality, but...
- We don't. - We kill him.<eos> - How?<eos> We've always known that only you or Kendra could kill Savage using items exposed, as you were, to the meteor's radiation.<eos> Now, the radiation works both ways. It gave Savage his immortality, but...<eos> It also makes him vulnerable.
I should stay and help you with Darhk.<eos> And get justice for Laurel.<eos> That's happening, honey, with or with out you.<eos> I promise.<eos> Uh, listen, I-I can't pretend to understand this time travel thing, but it sounds important.
Do it.<eos> Do whatever you like. I don't care any more.<eos> I've known soldiers like you before.<eos> And maybe you were good men once.<eos> But when you see so much violence, it becomes the only thing you truly understand.
Watermelon? Yeah.<eos> That, man.<eos> That cost three bucks, Chip.<eos> Is that the watermelon that was in your fridge?<eos> - Yeah, and it's gone!
Sorry, last one.<eos> Asshole.<eos> Hey.<eos> You're not wearing your watch.<eos> It's at the jeweler getting the clasp fixed.
Don't get paranoid.<eos> We are working on a brand new image...<eos> Tell them to fuck off... subtly, as you usually do.<eos> Oh, and delete the message.<eos> In case the Eloísa folk see it.
Don't let Raven ruin this for all of us.<eos> How could you do that to us?<eos> I realized the truth.<eos> They sent us all down here to see if the ground was survivable.<eos> From what I've seen, it's not.
This mean we're all buddy-buddy now?<eos> Today isn't the day for either of us to act like assholes.<eos> Think you can make it through a whole day?<eos> You know what I had to go through to get this job.<eos> There's people here today that don't respect this badge because it's pinned on a black man.
I'm not proud of that incident.<eos> And I plan to make a full apology during my sermon next Sunday.<eos> - John, can I...<eos> - But I will not apologize... for the message that I am sending out.<eos> There is a disease in this town and it's spreading like a wildfire.
Stop talking.<eos> So I can concentrate.<eos> Wake up, man.<eos> This city is screwed up because of you.<eos> It was quiet and normal.
Already tried that.<eos> GPS isn't working.<eos> Okay, no, but the meta-human activity would be.<eos> I mean, the watch is designed to track metas, right?<eos> And since Griffin Grey is one, it'll keep sending a message to a server till it goes through.
There's lots of money to be made.<eos> I'm looking for his mother, not work. And I go home.<eos> "Where is her mother?"<eos> She works at old queen's head.<eos> It would be in the corner.
Help! Help!<eos> Somebody help!<eos> Get a transfusion ready, get the Reidlinger Stones warmed up.<eos> Can you mend the wound?<eos> It's deep, but it's not impossible. The weapon.
There's a special school, called Brakebills.<eos> You heard of it?<eos> Well...<eos> I sort of checked myself in here to get away from magic, so...<eos> Look, you think magic is some terrible vice, so bad that you need rehab to get clean, it's not.
Is that a turban?<eos> No, it's your hair.<eos> Sewing is not really my thing.<eos> How is a voodoo doll is supposed to help me?<eos> Um, so, in the books, Jane carried this doll with her everywhere she goes, and it looks just like her.
And nothing lost was ever found?<eos> Wait, there's, uh... What about Penny?<eos> There's got to be something we can do.<eos> You need to read between the lines, Quentin.<eos> Jane's doll wasn't special because it looked like Jane.
Wait, there's, uh... What about Penny?<eos> There's got to be something we can do.<eos> You need to read between the lines, Quentin.<eos> Jane's doll wasn't special because it looked like Jane.<eos> Was special because of where it came from.
It's like touching a bare wire.<eos> More energy than I've felt.<eos> It felt good.<eos> It felt... dangerous.<eos> The reason you treat magic like a drug, is because the people that taught it to you act like drug dealers.
Save us all a lot of time and energy.<eos> - Look, I...<eos> - Shut the fuck up, would you, Chip?<eos> For once.<eos> Take the gun, put it in your mouth or whatever, and just spare us all the extra words.
I know how the lightning needs to bond with the dark matter from the particle accelerator explosion.<eos> I can recreate the circumstances to get you your speed back.<eos> This will work.<eos> Your subterfuge... is not gonna last.<eos> But more importantly... it's not gonna save Snow.
I can recreate the circumstances to get you your speed back.<eos> This will work.<eos> Your subterfuge... is not gonna last.<eos> But more importantly... it's not gonna save Snow.<eos> It's not gonna bring your Caitlin back.
When am I gonna get out of here?<eos> Well, you'll be kept until your bail hearing, so no longer than 72 hours.<eos> Three days?<eos> I'm trying to expedite it.<eos> I might be able to get it through sooner.
That's...<eos> I always thought that that was when we were at our best.<eos> Just you and me, late at night, lying awake in that little studio above the store.<eos> That place was a dump.<eos> Sure, I mean, it could use a coat of paint.
I think you should enjoy it, sir.<eos> Enjoy every minute while you can.<eos> Well, I intend to.<eos> And I'll head straight to Sandringham if you give me the all-clear to shoot.<eos> Consider it given.
We'll just make it look like the party chose her.<eos> And think of the coverage.<eos> We'll own the news.<eos> You want the convention to be a circus.<eos> Oh, Bob, I'm not sure if you've noticed or not, but politics is no longer just theater, it's show business.
When I criticized that, it was just because...<eos> No, not at all. I didn't take offense.<eos> It's politics.<eos> I'd love to do something like your gun bill.<eos> - It's a shame it didn't pass the Senate.
Point of fact is, they confirmed a list I'd already compiled myself. Okay.<eos> Officially, I don't want to know about it.<eos> Unofficially, I'm worried about what happens when the Feds' theory about the Ukrainians gets back to the Russians.<eos> There could be reprisals, more deaths, less peace.<eos> So maybe you can give them a better theory, whether they want to hear it or not?
I didn't expect to hear back from you so quickly.<eos> Shall I send for more food?<eos> I'm good, thanks, and to be honest, um, the blood bank isn't the only reason I wanted to speak with you.<eos> So, I looked into that facility you asked about.<eos> It's adequate, but I think you can do better.
And if they last long enough, the West's stockpile is gonna run out just as your engines hit the market.<eos> Unless the war ends before you're ready.<eos> Then the Russian engines will return and Pentillion's efforts will fail.<eos> Your shares will be worthless.<eos> I'm not sure how you found out about Zolotov's peace mission, but once you thought it would derail your ambitions, you arranged to have him murdered.
First round's on you, rich boy.<eos> Hannah, stop.<eos> If you tell the Director, someone else that I care about will die.<eos> Okay. The FBI has a system for handling madmen.<eos> It's called the chain of command.
You were born O-negative.<eos> But it changed.<eos> Recently.<eos> The mutation isn't contagious, all right?<eos> It can't spread to humans.
I've devoted my life to them.<eos> And it's never enough.<eos> Because, for them... eating themselves sick, fucking themselves raw, that's the most they could ever aspire to.<eos> Words like "expansion" and "empire" mean nothing.<eos> They need to see the future. Feel it. Hold it in their hands.
Santé!<eos> I can't believe you guys are actually here. I know.<eos> Guys, you should've heard<eos> JT's eulogy.<eos> It was beautiful.
But still, she is putting her company's bottom line before the very real damage that bottle-nosed maniac is doing every time she gets on the news and-- [gasping] That's it, the news.<eos> I gotta take the high road, go on the news and rat those suckers out.<eos> Is that really a good idea?<eos> It is if you think it is, because I am here to support you no matter what, but maybe it isn't the best idea?<eos> Like, if that idea were a Dillon brother maybe it's a Kevin, not a Matt?
Ick. Mind the open sewer.<eos> Fuck!<eos> Okay.<eos> You know what I think we should do?<eos> Go sit outside the embassy and wait for it to open.
Yeah, I'd like to place a collect call, please.<eos> My friend is arranging a wire transfer from the U.S.<eos> She's not picking up the home phone and I don't know her cell.<eos> How could you not know your wife's cell number?<eos> 'Cause it was on my phone.
- Wait, wait, wait! We are innocent men!<eos> - We're Americans!<eos> - Hey, just wait!<eos> Milo, he left us this villa.<eos> It belongs to us, but you... you can have it. It's yours, okay?
Yes, that as well.<eos> Except I'm not gonna pay it.<eos> The fee or the commission.<eos> Why would the guy who you just completed an illegal transfer for...<eos> And by the way, you are correct, it is highly illegal.
Well, just a quarter share.<eos> I don't think so.<eos> He showed us his will.<eos> That villa's not his to leave anyone.<eos> It's mine.
♪ Cake, cake, cake ♪<eos> ♪ Haters gonna hate, bakers gonna bake ♪<eos> ♪ Cake in the morning ♪<eos> What's up with this cake?<eos> My class made it for Hunger Action Month.
It's Ravener venom. He kept telling me he was all right.<eos> [pants] We have to find your father, not my father.<eos> [breathing heavily] Valentine's...<eos> His stele.<eos> Where is it?
I pray it stays that way.<eos> It won't.<eos> Until Snow White dies, I will never be what you want... let along what I want.<eos> And this box was made to hold something precious.<eos> And that's exactly what's it's going to do.
You gonna take that, hmm?<eos> Today's all about proving that you can play well with others, all right?<eos> There's no need to pout.<eos> I'm not gonna hurt your precious town.<eos> It holds sentimental value for me as well.
Yes, yes, let's do that.<eos> By the way, that boy that we found in the coffin? Yeah?<eos> Do you still have his address?<eos> I think so.<eos> Yes, here it is.
locked away here for all eternity.<eos> When I escaped, i swore I would free them.<eos> But you couldn't, because of this?<eos> My life force is in there.<eos> To join the others, it must be here, or else I cannot take my rightful shape in your world, and I'll forever be stuck in these...
Thanks, Max.<eos> Wait.<eos> You said you were in the elsewhere.<eos> But how did you get out?<eos> I destroyed phears' life pod, and it sent me back to our world.
I wouldn't be so cocky about your prowess if I were you.<eos> What's going on? Opening the doorway to this dimension may not have been a good idea.<eos> On a scale from one to namaste, how screwed are we?<eos> Demons are attracted to this dimension.<eos> It's defenseless and peaceful.
And now there is something so much worse.<eos> I need your magic to help me stop it.<eos> I can't help you.<eos> My magic's gone dormant.<eos> Then wake it up.
It belongs here.<eos> Now that's what I'm talking about.<eos> We have lift off.<eos> The energy is very faint.<eos> It's been dormant for a long time.
Jace. Oh, my God!<eos> Jace, it's okay, it's okay.<eos> Breathe.<eos> Where's my stele?<eos> It didn't come through with you.
Yeah, how many times you been kidnapped?<eos> What, ten, 20 times?<eos> Just admit it, you would be better off without me.<eos> I just got a group text message from you.<eos> Yeah, it went to JT and Tess, also.
Finance?<eos> You really a finance guy?<eos> - I'm not a kid anymore.<eos> - Sure, yeah. Dump out that bag.<eos> Go on. Dump it out.
What if this-Marina?<eos> Okay, what if she got this- what if she got some serious shit?<eos> I mean, like, really dope, one-of-a-kind magic.<eos> Maybe it'd buy you out.<eos> It'd have to be pretty amazing.
Okay, what if she got this- what if she got some serious shit?<eos> I mean, like, really dope, one-of-a-kind magic.<eos> Maybe it'd buy you out.<eos> It'd have to be pretty amazing.<eos> It is.
The Beast?<eos> Well, he has many names.<eos> Look, this is all great, but I'm just trying to get back to the Earth fountain.<eos> Can you show me where it is?<eos> I suppose I could order you a map, but it'd have to come from another branch.
We have two suicide victims from the same area within 24 hours.<eos> That cannot be a coincidence.<eos> It's not.<eos> Look at this watch.<eos> It's on his right wrist.
Mind if we sit down?<eos> Mrs. Nakano, was your husband a sushi chef his whole life?<eos> Yes.<eos> He took great pride in his work.<eos> But it came with a price.
And I was nervous to meet him.<eos> And he was going to kill me.<eos> Even if he did know, it still wouldn't matter.<eos> The rules are in place and he believes in those rules.<eos> Your biology saved you, it gave him the chance to know you, to love you.
You don't think that we've come from the same place?<eos> Where is this child?<eos> Protective Services.<eos> Interestingly, in the same building she was left.<eos> We're running the baby's DNA now, seeing if it matches anything in our database.
Just go on a journey of one moment after the other of gratitude.<eos> You may feel a hand touch your head.<eos> If it does, just keep in the state you're in and intensify.<eos> If it doesn't, you'll still feel the energy.<eos> It'll be in you.
Step in the moment, like you're there, looking through your own eyes, seeing what you saw then, feeling what you felt then, appreciating...<eos> Feeling the blessing of that moment.<eos> What a blessing it was in your life, how grateful you are.<eos> Take in the gratitude of that moment.<eos> Feel it.
I don't know that many people give a shit.<eos> Honestly, if that's what your film's success is based on, I think you're in trouble.<eos> I think it's gotta be based on something bigger than that.<eos> I think it's gotta be based on what makes human beings fulfilled, what makes them alive, what makes them hungry, what makes them change.<eos> You know, we all know that change can happen in a moment, but we're afraid it won't last.
There will be chaos.<eos> And trust me, we're not ready for that, And neither are you.<eos> I can't believe you're actually in.<eos> Well, if there's a heaven, there's a hell, right?<eos> Maybe it's coming for us.
And look, there's UNIT, on the way to close your head office.<eos> It's almost like they've been tipped off.<eos> The vengeance of Harmony Shoal is known and feared<eos> - throughout the five star systems!<eos> Is it really?
Simple accounting, really.<eos> At first, I wanted your friends to leave.<eos> I really had such a smooth-running operation going here before they arrived, but now I've decided they've caused too much damage, so my vindictive side...<eos> Did you know I have one?<eos> It wants to punish them.
Look, I mean, what happens if you just cannae do it?<eos> There's a special number if you've been diagnosed as dyslexic.<eos> Right, well can you give us that?<eos> Cos with computers I'm dyslexic.<eos> You'll find it online, sir.
No, you still don't get it.<eos> - No, you must... - I'm desperate to go back to work. - If you're desperate to get back to work...<eos> - Unless the doctor tells us...<eos> You need to have an up-to-date CV, in order to help you look for work.<eos> Now, just hold it right there. There's a CV workshop that I would like you to attend and it's this Saturday at 9:00.
Thought you should see these.<eos> Good God.<eos> We must send a warning.<eos> To cover our backs.<eos> Kenneth, it should probably come from you, as chief scientist.
Then we better come up with something, and we better come up with it fast.<eos> I'm not in the habit of removing counsel, Ms. Gibbs.<eos> And I'm not in the habit of having an accomplice be the attorney on a case.<eos> I'm entitled to representation.<eos> And you had it last night.
Wait a second.<eos> It doesn't matter if Forstman finds out or not if he doesn't have someone on the inside working for him.<eos> What are you saying?<eos> I'm saying that if they want me to point the finger at someone, that means I'm holding a gun.<eos> It's still alive.
I'm saying that someday you're going to face the character and fitness committee of the Bar, and I seriously doubt they're going to admit somebody who did that.<eos> Are you trying to intimidate a witness?<eos> Because yes, someday I will face that committee, but tomorrow they're going to be hearing about you.<eos> I'm your only way out of this mess.<eos> Just give me the people who are actually responsible for it, and I'll see to it that both you and Mike can practice law for the rest of your lives.
- Sheila, please.<eos> I came here once before, hoping for a second chance and you wouldn't give it to me.<eos> What does that have to do with this?<eos> Because if we'd gotten back together then, I wouldn't even be at the firm now, but I am.<eos> And it's all I have.
I was thinking about what you said about me not admitting things to myself and I wanted to talk to you about it.<eos> Why?<eos> I wanted you to know the truth.<eos> And what exactly is the truth? Our relationship didn't end because of Mike.<eos> It ended because I wasn't ready to confront what was wrong with me, and I don't know if I'll ever be ready, but...
You heard her.<eos> She said the fact is, is that I'm not a goddamn lawyer.<eos> Well, the only way to change that fact is for a jury to see me be a goddamn lawyer.<eos> You try that, all they're gonna see is someone going to prison.<eos> It's my call, and I'm making it.
Yes, it does.<eos> Lola must not have covered all the bases.<eos> Then we need to get her to cover all the bases.<eos> Are you out of your mind?<eos> You go to Lola, you lead Gibbs right to her, and this thing is over before it even gets started.
You have one last chance to save yourself.<eos> Call me before it's too late.<eos> HARVEY: Okay. So, we have a plan for you to start representing yourself.<eos> We just need a way to rattle Gibbs when we execute it.<eos> I have a way, but you're not going to like it.
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, I think most of us...<eos> You guys heard evidence earlier in the trial that I have a photographic memory. And I do. But the way it works,<eos> I don't just take a snapshot of something.<eos> See, I read it, and then I understand it. And once I understand it, well, then, I never forget it.<eos> But I've been trying to memorize my speech. But I can't. Because it's bullshit.
Let me guess, you're suing me for inducement.<eos> You bet your ass I am.<eos> You induced Jack Soloff into breaking his noncompete.<eos> You don't have a noncompete with Jack Soloff or anyone else.<eos> I heard you tried that empty threat with Louis, but it's not gonna work with me.
You bet your ass I am.<eos> You induced Jack Soloff into breaking his noncompete.<eos> You don't have a noncompete with Jack Soloff or anyone else.<eos> I heard you tried that empty threat with Louis, but it's not gonna work with me.<eos> If it is empty, then so is your morals clause and your bylaws, which states that if a named partner participates in a crime, any partner is free to go.
I'm saying that to keep you from coming down each time.<eos> Take my space for a couple of hours.<eos> No, we'll find somewhere.<eos> As you like.<eos> Leave it, I'll park it.
We'll have someone meet you there.<eos> He gave me an address in Woodside.<eos> It wasn't Hobbes.<eos> It was a different voice, but...<eos> It sounded familiar.
Oh. Gave her my basket to puke in.<eos> Yeah.<eos> See, loyalty, counts for something.<eos> Ain't that the truth.<eos> Tell me, is it more important than self-respect?
Where were you when Matt was lying in that hospital room, unconscious, - fighting for his life? - Where were you...<eos> Someone's in the house.<eos> Hey, Lee, I'm not staying up here by myself.<eos> Where's your gun?<eos> Where it should be, locked, in a drawer upstairs.
Oh, that's, uh... always does.<eos> All right.<eos> Can you feel my energy?<eos> Yes.<eos> May it flow through us and connect us.
- Steve let me know something about the final rungs that he's receiving.<eos> They're about succession of leadership.<eos> What's next after he goes. - The Plan.<eos> - Where's he going?<eos> The message he's receiving, uh, it's telling him that it is time to move on, and put a new leader in his place.
No!<eos> - Woo-hoo!<eos> Man!<eos> My virgin hand!<eos> It hasn't even held a beer!
Now you're talking.<eos> - It burns!<eos> It burns! Shit!<eos> Oh, come on!<eos> I've been looking for this church door for ten minutes and it was right there in your pile.
If removing Mayfair was Phase One, then what's Phase Two?<eos> This country is on the brink of collapse.<eos> Has been for decades.<eos> This government doesn't care about the people.<eos> It's too broken, too corrupt.
The mining companies built it back in the '80s before they moved out.<eos> That's when the pirates moved in.<eos> This island is basically a safe port if the waters get too rough for them.<eos> But they use it too inconsistently for the government to really do anything about it.<eos> So it's basically uninhabited.
You all right?<eos> I'm fine, but we got to find a way to stop this thing.<eos> Why?<eos> You can't shutdown the rocket?<eos> No, it's programmed to auto-launch.
Same with the painting.<eos> So I guess he's smart enough to use gloves.<eos> And you still think that the bombing was specifically targeting us?<eos> Gallery footage confirms that the camera by the fire alarm was added after the thief blacked out the security camera.<eos> And it's hooked up to a wireless transmitter.
She bought it when you were born... to match your eyes.<eos> How did you...<eos> After she passed away, some of her things were sold.<eos> I knew how much that necklace meant to her, so I bought it.<eos> Now it's yours.
The WMD team has swept the entire vehicle.<eos> There's nothing hardwired to the bomb.<eos> The bomb's not even activated. No, that's because it's a remote-detonating device.<eos> Look at the bomb.<eos> Look at it. There's no receiver.
She really was born for this.<eos> It's the WMD team.<eos> The bomb is gone.<eos> Response team confirms...<eos> It's gone.
The bomb is gone.<eos> Response team confirms...<eos> It's gone.<eos> The terrorist took it.<eos> But only high-ranking members of the Bureau would know where it was taken.
You told me it was gonna be okay. And I had to live with that.<eos> There's still another bomb.<eos> Thousands of people will die.<eos> - Bomb's missing.<eos> - Terrorists took it.
Thank God you're here.<eos> I jumped on a plane the second I heard about you and that bomb.<eos> All right, I want everyone's attention, please!<eos> Locating Miranda Shaw is now our top priority.<eos> We have to find her and stop her before that bomb goes off, wherever it is. And we will not fail.
I need eyes on the sixth floor, east stairway.<eos> Copy that. Approaching from the west.<eos> Liam.<eos> I know you're in here.<eos> Even if you find the nuke, you can't disarm it in time.
Him or me?<eos> Once again.<eos> The way it's been, or the way it could be 'cause I'm thinking, for once, it's you!<eos> The bomb's not here.<eos> Then where is it?
It's a hell of a long shot.<eos> Yes, but it's still a shot.<eos> There is a tomb in the Valley of the Kings that has been lost and forgotten.<eos> And no-one else knows it's there.<eos> I'll buy the concession the moment it becomes available.
Dude saved my life.<eos> I couldn't save his.<eos> I couldn't save his.<eos> You had a few scenes today with the prop gun.<eos> Any idea where you might have put it down?
Great.<eos> I'll just need your health card, Mrs. Hendrix. You know what?<eos> I've got that right here. Here you go.<eos> She's changed her hair, obviously.<eos> Because it was too ugly.
I'll just need your health card, Mrs. Hendrix. You know what?<eos> I've got that right here. Here you go.<eos> She's changed her hair, obviously.<eos> Because it was too ugly.<eos> Well, it looks lovely now. If you'll follow me, we'll get you into a room.
But I'm expensive because I'm worth it, Frank.<eos> Hello?<eos> You're still here. - Hey.<eos> Yeah, I never left. I love this city.<eos> It's adorable.
I couldn't see.<eos> These were found at the scene of the crime.<eos> Oh, gosh, they were supporters.<eos> That makes this tragedy even worse.<eos> Yes, this doubles it.
Hi, love.<eos> You should go back to your book.<eos> Where are you going?<eos> I just, uh, have to run an errand.<eos> I've been trying to cure the disease ever since it first appeared.
We've done great work, Evie.<eos> I promise it won't be for nothing.<eos> None of this is my fault! It's Susan Duncan and her clones!<eos> Technology is subject to natural selection too, Evie.<eos> It changes. It adapts.
Yes, but Evie had no baseline, and Susan has no balls.<eos> So let's talk clones, shall we?<eos> We have a saying.<eos> "Neolution follows the science."<eos> But it doesn't throw the deformed baby out with the bathwater, if you know what I mean.
Oh, come, now.<eos> At least take a pomegranate.<eos> You know, I always found them too much trouble.<eos> Sweet fruit surrounded by bitter -- they're something of a contradiction, but heaven for the effort.<eos> You park some chocolate in front of me and watch it go bye-bye, but pomegranates -- just not for me, thanks.
He killed my friends.<eos> No one else needs to die.<eos> Damn.<eos> You are adorable.<eos> Did you pick that gun 'cause it looks cool?
Want a taste?<eos> Okay.<eos> Here's his damn lemonade.<eos> I had some in my kitchen.<eos> Denise liked it.
Open the gate!<eos> Hey, what's with the dogs?<eos> Oh, they're tripling everything up.<eos> Testing that new experimental equipment.<eos> What is it supposed to do?
I can't let you in here, I'm sorry!<eos> Just open this door!<eos> You have to let us in!<eos> Do not attempt to open the door.<eos> It's booby-trapped.
Stupid!<eos> She's long gone by now.<eos> I gotta find her.<eos> No, you don't.<eos> Axel, whatever your mission was, it's over.
Besides, she's with her people.<eos> She's where she wants to be.<eos> She's just a little girl.<eos> I'm worried about this wound. Why?<eos> It's not healing over and you seem to be getting worse, not better.
Previously on Van Helsing...<eos> I got this female DB and when I checked her blood it was acting like it was still alive.
Thanks, Mohamad.<eos> Dammit.<eos> Susan, that can wait until tomorrow.<eos> He used to have the ammo stashed all over the house.<eos> Made sure it was never in just one place, you know?
What?<eos> Shit.<eos> Adrenaline was pumping back there.<eos> I didn't even notice. You know what?<eos> It's not deep enough to need stitches but we need to bandage it.
We've had luck so far, but it ends now.<eos> But there's no more mariachi bands, I promise.<eos> But there is so much more.<eos> Phase three is like a shaken pop can of creativity.<eos> Once opened it will explode with foamy brilliance.
Molly, stay.<eos> Too complex are my feelings.<eos> My love was everything I remember and yet she's become so much more.<eos> How could I ask a butterfly to not flap its wings?<eos> I've discovered that love isn't perfect but it isn't blind, either.
Too complex are my feelings.<eos> My love was everything I remember and yet she's become so much more.<eos> How could I ask a butterfly to not flap its wings?<eos> I've discovered that love isn't perfect but it isn't blind, either.<eos> It sees with so much more clarity than you or I.
To be honest, Judge, I'm less concerned about Bobo's IQ, and more concerned about his potential criminal activity.<eos> What criminal activity?<eos> This crate was delivered to his trailer. I took the photo - this morning.<eos> - Could be anything.<eos> Then why are his colleagues guarding it with guns?
Doc... die!<eos> Wooden crate. Five feet by two by one.<eos> Not ringing' any bells.<eos> I saw you receive it. Where's it at?<eos> What's in it?
Barry, what you're seeing is the Speed Force...<eos> Your past, your present, your future.<eos> Say, Iris, you look amazing.<eos> Thanks, Tony. His skin changed.<eos> It turned to metal.
Are there any records of that treatment?<eos> We might find clues how to help Jesse.<eos> Uh, yeah, they'd be downstairs in the storage room, in the morgue.<eos> Ew, you guys have a morgue?<eos> Well, it's not like a morgue morgue.
We might find clues how to help Jesse.<eos> Uh, yeah, they'd be downstairs in the storage room, in the morgue.<eos> Ew, you guys have a morgue?<eos> Well, it's not like a morgue morgue.<eos> It's not... it's like a poor man's morgue, really.
And will you pull it off?<eos> Of course.<eos> I'll get you a glass, then.<eos> This Houjin Lin operation was an eye opener, Robert.<eos> It corroborated some intelligence we picked up in Beijing.
- Just send out Ash Williams... now she's back, I got to find her, and kill her again.<eos> - she came back but now you've lost her? - Send that son-of a bitch out here! Focus up.<eos> We got to find Cheryl.<eos> Hey, why don't you deal with your dead sister, while I stop your inbred, asshole neighbors from busting in, and lynching you!<eos> Ruby, shit's gone so sideways, it's basically upside down.
Is everything all right, Mrs. Stowe?<eos> I'm sorry, no.<eos> We have to leave.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> This thing, this sickness they're reporting, they say it's spreading.
But I remind you of the importance of communication.<eos> It's the very blade of the bobsled.<eos> I'm not singling out either one of you, but I think for the next time, some people here might want to work on putting their thoughts and feelings into words, as a writer does.<eos> I settled on a company dental plan.<eos> It's called, "The tooth, the whole tooth, and nothing but the tooth."
It was in my car the entire time.<eos> Okay.<eos> Because I was driving back and forth so much, I ran out of gas.<eos> I pulled into a 76.<eos> I was about to pump the gas, I realized I didn't have my credit card, when I remembered it was on my desk at home because I used it to contribute to my friend's dumb Kickstarter campaign.
Peanutbutter.<eos> I just, um... I wanted to give you a chance to say goodbye...<eos> -Oh, no.<eos> -...to my twisted spleen.<eos> Because it was successfully removed from my body!
Where are they?<eos> Hey, baby.<eos> I can access the control panel to get you to your zombies.<eos> They're right through that door.<eos> It's locked.
This place will be a living hell for you.<eos> For all of you.<eos> It's unconscionable.<eos> But we have another option, Dolores.<eos> Break the loop before it begins.
They say that ... great beasts once roamed this world.<eos> As big as mountains.<eos> Yet all that's left of them is bone and amber.<eos> Time undoes even the mightiest of creatures.<eos> Just look at what it's done to you.
Your bones will turn to sand.<eos> And upon that sand a new god will walk.<eos> One that will never die.<eos> Because this world doesn't belong to you or the people who came before.<eos> It belongs to someone who has yet to come.
Arnold didn't know how to save you.<eos> He tried, ... but I stopped him.<eos> Do you want to know why I really gave you the backstory of your son, Bernard?<eos> It was Arnold's key insight, ... the thing that led the hosts to their awakening ... suffering.<eos> The pain that the world is not as you want it to be.
This time by choice.<eos> It's gonna be all right, Teddy.<eos> I understand now.<eos> This world doesn't belong to them.<eos> It belongs to us.
I think we need to try again.<eos> Just try again?<eos> Yeah.<eos> With the can?<eos> You sure it's there?
Just try again?<eos> Yeah.<eos> With the can?<eos> You sure it's there?<eos> It's there.
It was one of the Seraphim, Angels of the First Order.<eos> Angels?<eos> Seriously? What's it want?<eos> What all Seraphim want, order and control. "Peace."<eos> How'd it come back like that?
This is not a sin!<eos> Go to hell, Eugene!<eos> Hi, Cynthia. It's Miles Person calling you back.<eos> I apologize, but something's been going on with my voicemail.<eos> You know, well, o-one minute, it's totally empty, and then the next... Right, exactly. I have 30 messages.
Okay.<eos> I-I know how much the church meant to you.<eos> What about the church?<eos> Well, y-you don't know?<eos> Well, they're tearing it down.
Sooner or later, we... we all have to choose.<eos> By the way, you're out of milk.<eos> You're gonna sing it out of me?<eos> _<eos> This thing... this power... it chose me.
By the way, you're out of milk.<eos> You're gonna sing it out of me?<eos> _<eos> This thing... this power... it chose me.<eos> It chose a lot of people.
Cat, how does it feel to be the most powerful woman in National City?<eos> Well, Sara, first of all, that's a total misnomer. Nobody is calling me the most powerful woman in National City.<eos> I believe they are calling me the most powerful person.<eos> (APPLAUSE)<eos> Having a platform like mine is only worthwhile if I can use it to bring attention to the people who are really making a difference.
(SIGHING)<eos> I'm sure one day she'll give you more editorial responsibilities too.<eos> Fine.<eos> CAT:<eos> I know you see yourself as a plucky heroine who broke a story as big as Watergate and then gave it to my biggest competitor, and I know you think once the Daily Planet runs the story that you will have a fancy job there,
Excuse me.<eos> I'm starving.<eos> Thank you so much for coming.<eos> You know, I can't begin to tell you how thankful I am for the movement.<eos> It got me through so much.
Driving me nuts.<eos> Can't even get to the basics.<eos> How are we going to get anywhere?<eos> You're wasting my time.<eos> You know, I've given my life to this work. It's everything to me.
I will fix this for you, John.<eos> Sarah!<eos> When were you gonna tell me what happened with John Ridge? Well, sorry, I'm not gonna tell him his son is cured just because he said he was gonna give us a million dollars.<eos> You shouldn't have recommended the medicine. Why?<eos> It's one of our most successful methods of treatment.
It's what everyone wants, is it not?<eos> Peace on Earth. Goodwill towards man.<eos> It's a lot less like Christmas out there and more like Dawn of the Dead.<eos> The human race finally has a chance to live.<eos> Or it would suffer the same fate as Krypton.
- All Kryptonians.<eos> - What kind of weapon?<eos> A bomb.<eos> Filled with Kryptonite dust.<eos> It'll irradiate the entire city.
I know.<eos> So, was your mom a hunter or a witch?<eos> No.<eos> Her father was part of this secret organization.<eos> It's defunct now.
Why?<eos> Because it would be more low profile?<eos> Well, actually, I was thinking of legal reasons.<eos> Marriage isn't regarded as a sacrament in the Church of Scotland.<eos> It is not as binding in the same way as here.
I understand now.<eos> They are going for the backpack.<eos> Then we delay the migration.<eos> It's unnecessary.<eos> It's almost complete.
- Thanks.<eos> - You're welcome.<eos> Um... that shark story really happen to you?<eos> Some of it.<eos> It gets better every time I tell it.
But as your co-worker, I'm helping you solve this case. Check it out.<eos> I found it in the victim's pocket.<eos> She wasn't wearing it? Nope.<eos> And the chain is broken, which could tell us something about how she died.<eos> Plus... there's an inscription on it.
Oh, man, I had no idea.<eos> It's just, all of this has been hard enough, and I-I-I don't want to see him suffer another setback. I hear you.<eos> I'll talk to him.<eos> Okay, uh... there seems to be an e-mail address for a Dee Torres.<eos> It's associated with a social media account. An alias.
Yeah, definitely.<eos> Well, y-you really need this guitar?<eos> Oh, yes.<eos> And they say it's so important to learn new things as you get older.<eos> And, well, music, you just don't know where it could lead.
- What do I smell like? - Mmm.<eos> You smell faintly of... of beer.<eos> How do you say his name again? It's like Gae-tan...<eos> - It's Gaetano Bresci. - That sounds interesting.<eos> Yeah, he, um, he co-founded this anarchist newspaper here in Paterson, but it was in Italian, um, called La Questione Sociale.
- Yeah, it's a Wesen disease.<eos> Specific to Blutbaden.<eos> "Lycanthropia is a genetic mutation<eos> "which presents itself on rare occasion in Blutbaden.<eos> "It's transmitted as a recessive trait
Nothing, not even medicine, can stop the increase or suspend it.<eos> We need to figure out why she's the exception.<eos> - What's her temperature?<eos> - Still 107.<eos> If it gets any higher, she'll be at risk for brain damage.
- So did I.<eos> - Oh, I must be bulletproof!<eos> Every time we killed you back there, time reset the day.<eos> "Time reset the day."<eos> You're the one that told us time was conscious... that it needs primaries like Jennifer to think.
She was immune... like you.<eos> She died of bacterial meningitis.<eos> I saved her once with you, but the day reset anyway.<eos> Time... wouldn't let us change your history in any way.<eos> It needed you to create time travel.
She died of bacterial meningitis.<eos> I saved her once with you, but the day reset anyway.<eos> Time... wouldn't let us change your history in any way.<eos> It needed you to create time travel.<eos> It needs us to complete the mission.
Do you remember when Mother would speak of the Red Forest?<eos> Promise that we were important.<eos> That the cycle would lead us to a world without time, without death.<eos> Your father gave his life for it.<eos> Why hasn't it come?
Nobody came for the books.<eos> Nobody cared.<eos> Until the winter, of course... when the fires needed feeding.<eos> So you saved them.<eos> Mankind did for its words what it could not do for itself.
Why don't we...<eos> Why don't we have a drink and talk about killing Ramse?<eos> Just like the old days.<eos> All right, pity party's over.<eos> It is over when I say it's over.
Hey!<eos> You don't order me around.<eos> I'm the Mother, not you.<eos> Wise are those who know that they are not wise.<eos> Your wisdom used to have meaning, and now it's just...
Oh, my God!<eos> There's a woman here with a gun.<eos> - Where's my husband?<eos> - Who's your husband?<eos> Put it down.
What is she?<eos> The Cosmic Treadmill.<eos> She's a time machine powered by my super speed.<eos> At least in theory.<eos> Flash and I have been developing the plans for this device but we've never tested it.
- Please.<eos> There's a way of doing things here.<eos> An order developed over time, generations.<eos> And individuality in the House of Windsor, any departure from that way of doing things, is not to be encouraged.<eos> It results in catastrophes like the abdication.
- Ah, I bust ass to make it look like that. -(CLICKS TONGUE)<eos> It turns out, I fail just as epically as I succeed.<eos> I don't know what happened at work, but I promise, the only opinion you need to worry about is your own.<eos> That's a pretty low opinion right now.<eos> Well, it shouldn't be.
I need you to open your eyes now, okay?<eos> Tell me what the target is.<eos> Tell me where the attack is going to happen.<eos> I want a partner.<eos> Someone who knows the world for what it is, but also knows it must be made better.
You are the one who makes all the noise.<eos> And you're the one who never stops me.<eos> Why?<eos> Because you know that the work I do is important. It's for...<eos> Okay, if you say it's for the greater good, I am gonna punch you.
Presumably to avail herself of the Davenports' vast wealth.<eos> The girl you're saying isn't Mina, she passed a DNA test.<eos> Tell me that wasn't in Underhill's files? It was.<eos> Her DNA was a perfect match for the sample taken from Mina's toothbrush in 2004.<eos> Funny thing about that toothbrush. It disappeared around the same time as the test.
That's a bad theory.<eos> Why is it a bad theory?<eos> 'Cause it wouldn't account for Mina, the real Mina, and what happened to her in 2004.<eos> It's not supposed to.<eos> It's supposed to explain how a girl we think is a fraud passed a DNA test.
What is it?<eos> I can't tell you.<eos> Why not?<eos> This is part of a classified project.<eos> You shouldn't have it.
-Oh, it's all true.<eos> My cousin Timmy and I flew down to Tamarindo after graduation.<eos> One night, Tim and I are getting yacked up on kamikazes at this bar.<eos> We're running up a tab.<eos> And at some point, one of us reaches for our wallet, it's gone.
- Or a duck.<eos> - Or Gene Kelly.<eos> You ready to apply that can-do spirit to the murder of Leslie Morgan?<eos> So, it's definitely a murder?<eos> That air conditioner didn't just fall on Leslie, It was pushed.
Brand new window AC.<eos> Well, it will have.<eos> Very airy, Gary Derryberry.<eos> Yeah, I see holes for the limiter screws.<eos> They would've kept the window closed tight on the AC unit to prevent it from falling out.
Stan Mendoza's on a list of people who checked out that apartment.<eos> He could've seen the agent punch in the lockbox code, then gone back there any time.<eos> Let's go get some... decent coffee.<eos> That's the apartment that the AC unit fell out of?<eos> It was pushed out. Oh.
I know I signed in and there was a bunch of security cameras.<eos> It's not going to be hard to check out.<eos> And where was your car?<eos> As far as I know, it was in the garage.<eos> I'm not changing my story because it's true.
It's very appealing.<eos> Keep doing what you're doing.<eos> Internal Affairs can take it from here.<eos> You're going to need backup someday, Babineaux.<eos> Fingers crossed it gets there in time.
Can you speak?<eos> No!<eos> What?<eos> Where's Janko?<eos> We were fighting for the tranquilizer gun, and we rolled around and it went off, and...
Gentle and loving-- this is gonna be tricky.<eos> I had a 101 fever.<eos> If that's not a time to verbally abuse my loved ones, when is?<eos> Sheldon, when you're sick, you can be... unbearable.<eos> That's why your friends have been known to work late or sneak out to the movies or stay at a neurobiology conference three days after it's ended.
Please, no books on the floor.<eos> I love this one.<eos> Photos from places I can't imagine.<eos> I know you hate it now, but travelers wrote our most precious books.<eos> The library is what it is because of them.
Q, where are you going with this?<eos> Okay, so we can't just open a door to Fillory, but we do know when they open-- every time the Chatwins go.<eos> So if we could just find a way to get there, then we could follow 'em in.<eos> Uh... Look, all I know is time magic is apparently a thing, a thing that's been dicking with us for the past 39 lifetimes.<eos> So I say we find a way to make it work for us.
It was a reassurance that I'm not alone.<eos> Oh, that feels fantastic.<eos> Holy crap!<eos> Uh, this is a semicolon Daisy tattooed on me and it basically is a reminder to myself that my story's never over.<eos> You know, it's not over yet, and that just like a sentence... like when you're writing or typing a sentence, a semicolon means, like, that's not the end.
While I'm sure we all wish Mr. Cooperman a quick recovery, the case must necessarily continue, which means we must proceed without Mr. Cooperman's testimony.<eos> Mr. Cooperman's health issue means the defense was not given the opportunity to cross-examine him.<eos> Not giving the defense their right to confront the witness against them is prohibited by law, unfair, and unduly prejudicial.<eos> You are therefore instructed to disregard all of Mr. Cooperman's testimony.<eos> It is not part of the trial record. It is not evidence.
An excellent price - for such a...<eos> - It's a fake.<eos> Frank.<eos> Why do you say that?<eos> Well, because... because I made it.
Is it really you?<eos> I was finally happy.<eos> - Jasper...<eos> - Huh?<eos> I know this world can suck, but at least it's real.
- Dry it... dry it off.<eos> - Oh, shit. Oh, shit.<eos> - Oh, my God, it's going to be fine.<eos> - Oh, my God, it's not working.<eos> - Veronica, it's going to be fine.
Well, it doesn't matter now, 'cause I love how things worked out.<eos> Me, too.<eos> And I think you're even more beautiful than this rose.<eos> Wow.<eos> The last time I saw my grandma, the most exciting thing was watching the ash of her cigarette get longer and wondering if it was gonna fall in her pudding.
This I know.<eos> But she is young and angered. She feels... you police hide the truth of what is acted out on the people of her faith.<eos> - She is Jewish? - Raised as an English woman.<eos> However, she discovers her heritage with a zeal, a zeal for truth, and that truth to be discovered however it may, if you see my meaning.<eos> I do not know if it is disloyal. But I know that I am grateful to you, the sharing of it.
More reliable.<eos> A little less stubborn.<eos> And this version is sorry for the last one.<eos> And would never take your endorsement for granted.<eos> Well, it certainly has nice lines.
Her name could very well be on all your trophies by the time she's done here.<eos> But she desperately needs to learn a little humility. Mm.<eos> Lanie, you find anything in the autopsy?<eos> I did.<eos> The bullet broke up when it hit a rib.
Then why did Bardot need to save you?<eos> A few weeks ago, Flanagan found out that I joined the Academy.<eos> He demanded that I be his inside woman... his mole.<eos> Threatened to "out" me as his daughter if I didn't.<eos> Ruin my entire career before it even began.
- You didn't find one at his place.<eos> - But Mads found a hard drive.<eos> - Is there anything on it? - Yes and no.<eos> Come and see.<eos> There's nothing incriminating, but it has a cloud account.
So far, we've had to create extremely low temperatures in order not to lose power, and creating those low temperatures, in turn, demands more power.<eos> So, it has been a Catch-22.<eos> Now, we are on the verge of a breakthrough.<eos> What you are about to see is quantum levitation.<eos> The material this disc is made of is superconducting, which means that, at a low temperature - but a much higher temperature than we've been used to - it will hover between the magnetic fields.
So what, you thinking drugs?<eos> That tracks with the heart damage that Cam found.<eos> You ever hear of a drug called a Wiley Monkey? Any relation to the coyote?<eos> Anyhow, it's a, uh, big drug now in, uh, Southeast, uh, Baltimore.<eos> It has, what, cocaine, heroin, household cleaning products in it.
Your Queen.<eos> Not a showgirl.<eos> ... were introduced to the people of Bermuda for the very first time.<eos> The Royal couple then flies to Jamaica....<eos> The last time you departed on this tour, it was cruelly cut short by the death of your dear father.
The question is how does someone who feeds snakes and lizards for a living scrape together this much cash?<eos> Now, that threatening text that Eddie received was about owing someone money.<eos> I'd be shocked if those two aren't related.<eos> If they are, then I might be of assistance.<eos> Turns out the text was sent from an untraceable burner, but when the text was sent, it had to go through a wireless network.
All right.<eos> Go pick him up.<eos> Marco Sutter?<eos> NYPD.<eos> Hold it right there.
- Okay... _<eos> Yeah, I've never been to Oxnard.<eos> What's in Oxnard?<eos> This couch, I feel like it's, like, your second wife.<eos> I mean, it's new and it's perfect and it gives you everything you need.
Yeah, I've never been to Oxnard.<eos> What's in Oxnard?<eos> This couch, I feel like it's, like, your second wife.<eos> I mean, it's new and it's perfect and it gives you everything you need.<eos> But you know what? Let's see how firm it is - when it has a baby.
And I feel like you don't miss me.<eos> I do, I miss you.<eos> - Really?<eos> - Yeah. 'Cause, like, this couch, I feel like, it's, like, your second wife.<eos> I mean, it's new and it's perfect and it gives you everything you need.

Jan says that you've agreed to share them in three equal piles.<eos> So you have 5 million each. But if you want to buy more than an ice cream without being taxed on it, then you need to launder the money.<eos> What we do is have you start your own place.<eos> We could call it Bimse's Dented Cars.<eos> It doesn't start off so good, but after a while you sell a bunch of used vans.
Who's Trevor?<eos> He's the gay who comes with my room.<eos> I am on a completely different level.<eos> I get a poached egg on demand.<eos> Anyway, I auditioned my one-woman show for Trevor, and he thinks it's strong enough to be performed in the world-famous, renowned Spinnaker Lounge.
- Yeah.<eos> Mom just has some things she has to sort out.<eos> Nullum crimen sine lege. [No crime without law.]<eos> Nulla poena sine lege poenali. [ No punishment without law. ]<eos> And that means that no one can be punished for an act unless it is defined as a criminal offense.
I know you see me as a killjoy, but I'm doing it for the company's sake and ours.<eos> - This is fucking dangerous.<eos> - Claudia, listen.<eos> That cleanup costs money.<eos> It costs a real, real lot of money.
How do I take off a mask when it stops being a mask, when it's as much a part of me as I am?
Day number six without sleep.<eos> I'm crashing.<eos> Next, my consciousness will go.<eos> The panic isn't settling in anymore.<eos> It's just there.
_<eos> _<eos> Oh, God.<eos> Alexa, when is the end of the world?<eos> Unless it collides with a very large rock or a future technology goes very wrong indeed, Earth is most likely to be destroyed when the sun swells into a red giant in several billion years' time.
Do you dream, Elliot?<eos> You scraping so hard like you ain't ever asked yourself this before.<eos> I said, do you want to be here right now?<eos> And I don't mean, like, here-here, but I mean here in a cosmic sense, bro.<eos> Like, existence could be beautiful, or it could be ugly, but that's on you.
- has taken a terrible turn? !<eos> - Good one.<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> Is that Wyatt's gun?<eos> You knew where it was this whole time? !
Oh, my God!<eos> Is that Wyatt's gun?<eos> You knew where it was this whole time? !<eos> Yeah, I was 12. Panicked, I threw it away.<eos> My God, it's beautiful!
And you're the volunteer tomato.<eos> I'm sorry, what?<eos> In a garden, you pull everything up.<eos> Sometimes a stray vine just keeps coming back.<eos> It volunteers.
- What? That's hot.<eos> Here, maybe it's just for High Kings.<eos> Oh, Jesus!<eos> Okay, Father-in-law, why is this blade 1,000 degrees?<eos> It may only be handled by Master Magicians.
The source of all magic.<eos> It's not only stronger than Ember and Umber, it created them.<eos> Fillory runs on it.<eos> Martin goes every night to drink from it, draining it a little more each time.<eos> The Wellspring's magic is so strong it killed... every human thing in him. There's only The Beast now.
So I go in and I shoot four guys.<eos> Just like that.<eos> Ding ding ding ding.<eos> The fourth man's bullet wound is a rear-entry.<eos> It came from over here.
- Where is he?<eos> - He's back there.<eos> Where's the body, Marty?<eos> Back room, in that corner... in the drywall.<eos> So, it was in the wall, huh?
Well, that works out for both of us.<eos> What do you say we go there together...<eos> Get this bride of yours squared away, huh?<eos> You have a gun.<eos> It's for my job.
I wanted to tell you I'm sorry.<eos> For my outburst last month.<eos> Can you let go of me, please?<eos> I know you're afraid, but the fear you have is a right one.<eos> It means you'll be forever vigilant.
Man, you wanna live in denial? Go ahead, okay?<eos> Go right ahead.<eos> All of you can't accept the fact that maybe we fucked up.<eos> Okay? Take a look at the city.<eos> It's going to shit, man.
Mom?<eos> They taking care of you?<eos> Room looks nice.<eos> I'll see if they can fix the clock.<eos> Looks like it's broken.
Reading emails.<eos> The FBI has 3 million of you innocent citizens under surveillance for no reason.<eos> Okay?<eos> The backlash?<eos> It boggles the mind.
Very funny.<eos> Mark's hacker friend managed to extract information from that card we found in the old guy's garden.<eos> - From a Premier Lodge?<eos> - Yes.<eos> And it retains information until it's reprogrammed.
So...<eos> Cara sleeps with a killer, steals a necklace and is killed because of it.<eos> Provided that is Grace's.<eos> She had cocaine in her bloodstream when she died.<eos> If we can prove it's Grace's necklace, she must've been murdered by our killer.

Ma, I got a tryout tomorrow.<eos> Make it a whiskey.<eos> - You look good, Ma.<eos> - I'm all right.<eos> I got my health, the bar keeps me pretty busy and it's filled with a bunch of drunk guys I can take advantage of if I want to.
Because he's not good at it.<eos> Of course I'm good at it.<eos> Last time, you lost your watch in there.<eos> Who cares?<eos> It's waterproof.
What...? What necklace?<eos> The seahorse Danny gave me.<eos> Dad took it.<eos> You can't go through your dad's stuff like that. You know that.<eos> But it was a gift.
As Marcia said, many people believe that violence only occurs on the 6:00 news.<eos> It only happens to other people.<eos> You know, something that the public doesn't always know is that when the police work a homicide, they refer to the case by the victim's name only.<eos> I never realized how important that was... until my brother Danny Rayburn lost his life to violence.<eos> Violence is particularly difficult when it... happens in the family, and I have experienced that as well.
This isn't going to be a problem, is it?<eos> Jesus Christ.<eos> Good man.<eos> - What about a home security system?<eos> - It's on.
I can't find it.<eos> Must've worked.<eos> So funny, I forgot to...<eos> What happened to the shower? !<eos> It was finished!
Ladies and gentlemen, Water to Wine!<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - Hey.<eos> One, two, three, four.<eos> ♪ The world may be flat ♪ ♪ But it's always changin' ♪
Like me.<eos> This is a trick that Reginald taught me.<eos> Surgeons today like to draw a map on their patients for where they're going to cut.<eos> - Any chance this surgery is elective?<eos> - It's mandatory, I'm afraid.
So I went back to the desert.<eos> Nothing hollows out a man quicker than completing a mission.<eos> Because after that you still gotta live.<eos> Dig into that toolbox and fetch me a 5H socket, would you?<eos> When did you finally give it up?
I mean, how can we have a baby?<eos> We... we already have a baby.<eos> Uh, well, we said that we wanted them to be two years apart, and Lark is eight months old, and it took seven months to get pregnant last time, so...<eos> Right, okay, but... but-but-but-but-but- but-but-but... but... uh, that plan was devised in a pre-Lark world, and post-Lark world is very different.<eos> It is... it's-it's darker, you know?

It's sleepier.<eos> It's... saggier.
- But it's not up to us.<eos> - No. - No, it's up to fate.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> So we don't have to find the answer,<eos> - it'll find us.
"Pray we never meet in person.<eos> I'm twice your size."<eos> You really think that someone killed Charles because of the work we were doing?<eos> The work you do is controversial.<eos> Well, it shouldn't be.
Did Henry tell you about the Baskerville trust?<eos> He did not.<eos> You know each other?<eos> The trust is where Charles got most of his money, from the estate of Hugo Baskerville, the rail baron.<eos> It passes, intact, to the oldest surviving heir.
You mean, the rats, like, hear a bell, and then their body expects food?<eos> Well, yeah, the, uh, sound of a bell can make a lab rat do pretty much anything.<eos> Yeah, well, they do have very small brains.<eos> ♪ Bones 11x16 ♪ The Strike in the Chord Original Air Date on May 19, 20 ♪ Main Title Theme ♪ The Crystal Method == sync, corrected by elderman == @elder_man<eos> Well, the killer was pretty smart to dump the body where he or she knew it would get eaten.
Well, let's talk to the M.E.<eos> See if she's ever seen anything like this before.<eos> I have never seen anything like this before.<eos> The entire skeletal structure has dissolved.<eos> I mean, it's gone.
Guys.<eos> Take a look at this.<eos> Look at the mantel.<eos> The hourglass.<eos> Yeah, it isn't in the Christmas photo which was only taken a couple months earlier.
If we attack it, what better way to prepare than a real dose of His power?<eos> Are you saying that the Nazis had in their hands - One of those "hands". - Right.<eos> If it was so powerful that it could win the war,<eos> - Why do not they won? - Because the lost.<eos> On the way to Berlin, it was stolen.
What if it's one of those?<eos> Yeah.<eos> You know, I could have shot her when you were far away from help, but I gave her a chance.<eos> I made that choice.<eos> Think about it.
The person to blame for the death of your son is you.<eos> Let's make this interesting.<eos> I'm going to give you a gift that you did not give to me.<eos> A chance to say goodbye.<eos> Pick it up.
Now you pick it up.<eos> There's one bullet left in that chamber, so pick it up.<eos> It's your choice.<eos> You either get arrested and rot in prison or you pick up that gun and we end this.<eos> Pick it up!
Robert, you can't keep making these unilateral decisions that affect all of us.<eos> Do you have any idea what it... what it takes to, you know, care for a snake?<eos> Yeah, I got this pamphlet... "How to Take Care of Your Pet Snake."<eos> I'm not asking you, I'm asking Tom.<eos> I mean, you give it food and water, and you have to make sure it doesn't escape.
I was protecting him.<eos> By risking his life?<eos> By keeping you out of it!<eos> The Phoenix Scar requires a special kind of transfer.<eos> It can only go to a blood relative, and that would've meant waking you and bringing you and all the drama that you come with back into his life... a life which he was finally thriving in without you.
Why do you care about my mistakes?<eos> It's not me who cares.<eos> It's the Phoenix Stone.<eos> Its voice is in my head all the time.<eos> You have no idea how loud it is.
Like, a wolf or... a lion?<eos> You're like a beaver, right?<eos> Just swimming around, gathering the wood and the crap that the rooster and the eagle need to build the dam to keep the water out.<eos> Wow, I am not gonna lie to you.<eos> I did not know where this analogy was going when I first started, but it is rock fucking solid.
This is gonna hurt like hell.<eos> Here, might need that.<eos> Okay, okay.<eos> All right.<eos> Almost got it.
Here, might need that.<eos> Okay, okay.<eos> All right.<eos> Almost got it.<eos> Almost got it.
No, she's not dead.<eos> - What?<eos> - No, no, it's her scar.<eos> I'm talking about the scar on her face.<eos> It'll be severe.
Talked books with Lee.<eos> Had a beer.<eos> I wanted to know if he ever said anything about Kennedy, and guess what.<eos> He hasn't.<eos> You mess with the past, it messes back.
- Jesus!<eos> Watch it.<eos> No, no, no!<eos> This road is not closed.<eos> It's supposed to be clear.
It was a seahorse.<eos> - A seahorse.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I was just looking for it the other day.<eos> You know where it is?
Wait, wait...<eos> What did...? What did he ask her about?<eos> I couldn't exactly grill Janey for details, but he wanted to know about the necklace.<eos> What about the necklace?<eos> He asked her where it was.
You come back and see me anytime, huh?<eos> Hey.<eos> Yeah?<eos> You go to my daughter's school, and out in the parking lot, you ask her fucking questions?<eos> The last thing I wanted to do was drag Janey in here and ask her questions in front of everybody, and turn this whole thing into something that it wasn't, okay?
- Lorelai, hey!<eos> - How's it going?<eos> Oh, it's great.<eos> I love this kitchen.<eos> - Mmm. - Sookie set it up so great.
I've been married. You didn't know that.<eos> To Rory's father.<eos> It was brief.<eos> We have... had a long, complicated relationship.<eos> And it didn't end badly.
To Rory's father.<eos> It was brief.<eos> We have... had a long, complicated relationship.<eos> And it didn't end badly.<eos> It just ended because it shouldn't have happened.
Uh, didn't Lorelai talk to you about this?<eos> This has nothing to do with Lorelai.<eos> This is about you.<eos> - Did you lose that card I gave you?<eos> - I gave it to Lorelai.
I sat down and it just came out. Flew out.<eos> It's like this story has been sitting in my brain for years,<eos> - taking up space.<eos> - Like the lyrics to "My Sharona."<eos> Exactly. It's been there, waiting for me to put it down on paper.
-And our good friend, Back Fat Pat.<eos> -Tell me, is he of the Maryland Back Fats?<eos> -I believe he is.<eos> - They did a job on that floaty hut.<eos> - Is it fixable?
Would you mind tying this for me?<eos> Oh, yes, yes.<eos> Grazie.<eos> Ai. Oh, I like your kitchen a lot.<eos> It's the place in the house where I feel most comfortable.
Money, money, always money.<eos> I know.<eos> Beppi wants me to come back, to go on tour, to do this concert, to be La Fiamma again, because of the money.<eos> How is the pasta?<eos> It is so good.
- Where should we go next?<eos> - Uh, Ponte Rialto.<eos> - Great.<eos> - Ponte Rialto. - How long is this list?<eos> It is very long-ay, long-ay.
Hailai?<eos> No, no, she-- she's my protegé.<eos> Very innocent.<eos> Do you like innocence?<eos> It appeals to your depravity.
All I must do is show them the truth. That I am loyal to the cause and not the treasonous villain that Joseph Reed makes me out to be.<eos> You saw yourself.<eos> I could not do it.<eos> I would no sooner betray my country than I would you.<eos> I have always seen the virtue in your candor, but when you're on trial, take care that it's not accompanied by anger.
Why not?<eos> 40 minutes ago, they showed me the nuclear football.<eos> I guess I've had it long enough to try it out.<eos> We've just been attacked.<eos> The world thinks it can test us right now, and a full, swift show of force is the only way to remind them that our flag is still flying strong tonight.
The heater doesn't seem to be on.<eos> I'll go look.<eos> You try to go back to bed.<eos> Well?<eos> Well, I'm hoping it resets itself.
- Now, that sounds like a gamble to me.<eos> - Good luck.<eos> - You're not coming?<eos> - Consider this your first solo mission.<eos> Don't blow it.
The two of you can kill each other later.<eos> A bubble in my artery?<eos> - Did I hurt the baby?<eos> - No, no.<eos> It's so big that even a sneeze could have made it bleed.
I have a small hemorrhage here.<eos> What next?<eos> Uh, pull back on the probe, close him up, and wait for the bleed to stop.<eos> Or you can control the bleed right now.<eos> Use a biopsy needle to irrigate the bleed, then dilute and suction until it stops.
That means we got tonight to solve it.<eos> You find anything unusual?<eos> A few things.<eos> See that?<eos> Notes of stippling, or gunpowder around the entry wound suggests the gun wasn't directly against his head when it was fired.
Someone benefited from Mr. Park's murder.<eos> I'm gonna find out who!<eos> Maybe the rose would look better over here.<eos> It would look better here?
_<eos> JEN: I'm telling you, there's a rat in the attic.<eos> I can hear it.<eos> It-It's like it's on our old StairMaster.
I went to auctioneering school.<eos> (blabbering rapidly)<eos> There.<eos> Sold! Well, we'll just build the gazebo on the other side of the pool.<eos> - Mm-hmm. - It won't get the morning sun, but you'll still be able to sit on the glider and whittle.
- We will kill this man.<eos> - No! I lost you once.<eos> I won't have that happen again.<eos> - Stop! - I'm sorry.<eos> Your skin is young, but it will toughen.
- A gift from The Blacksmith.<eos> Gallows Silk.<eos> Soaked in the blood of this pitiful creature, rendering her power futile.<eos> - NOOOO! - Three months. One hundred and thirty years.<eos> Retribution does not come quick, but it will be glorious.
"It's gotta be fun and funny and..."<eos> So, then, the next part was me just trying to sketch out the choreography, seeing how it would work with their tails, and bringing squirrelness into a human dance.<eos> Just weeks of just doing gags.<eos> And then Carlos basically just picks his favorite, and the tango was born.<eos> The tango sequence took 33 days, about five weeks, because there was a lot of play between who is holding the nut, where it's going, so it takes a great deal of Polish time.
I did a backwards ocho in one of the shots I did.<eos> So, actually, I have very specific tango moves in this.<eos> So, it's all a collaborative effort that made that sequence extremely painful but extremely rewarding at the same time.<eos> It's one of my favorite sequences in the movie.<eos> It just shows how fun and painful love can be.
What do you mean you may have found? Oh, man...<eos> Is it a body or not?<eos> I don't want to look at it again.<eos> Oh, yeah, it's-it's definitely a body.<eos> And it's in acid or something and it's horrible.
I'm saying that if Stefan is in a human body, he's got about three days to live.<eos> Yes.<eos> Come on.<eos> Ah, yes.<eos> For more on this story as it breaks, stay tuned.
That sizzle sound?<eos> Hmm?<eos> That's the pan talking to me.<eos> Now, remember, a good chef always listens to his pan.<eos> It'll tell me when the filet's ready to be turned or the chop is gonna hit medium-rare.
No... this one neither.<eos> You're awfully picky.<eos> NO RESULTS FOR "TOM STILTON"<eos> I hope you have a more clear understanding on what forensic is about and why we cops call it "the workshop of death".<eos> DNA analysis takes time, it HAS to take time, ...because it can either absolve or condemn.
They just walked the hell out and went somewhere else.<eos> Then we can sue their asses.<eos> With what lawyers, what resources, and what money?<eos> Because I don't know if you noticed, but this firm has been gutted because of your recommendation.<eos> No, Jessica, it was gutted because of mine.
- You know "The Jerk"? - Yeah, you know "The Jerk"?<eos> Yeah, I watched a lot of movies growing up.<eos> Ah, we watch a lot of movies in here.<eos> All right, you want to know my story?<eos> It starts long before I did what I did, because I wasn't born a poor black child, but I was born poor, which made me susceptible to wanting to be rich.
I can't wait.<eos> Okay.<eos> Dr. Williams, call intensive care.<eos> Dr. Williams, intensive care.<eos> The shooting, it's, uh, brought a lot of things into perspective for me.
I'm...<eos> I'm doing fine.<eos> - I'm just fine.<eos> - Below Quincy Street, there's a sealed off underground pumping station.<eos> It was built in 1894, then decommissioned after the Great Depression, when the federal government financed a WPA-related sewer rebuild.
I would love to continue today, but I just...<eos> The mind works better with rest.<eos> Yes.<eos> I like your new place.<eos> It's homey.
Do I really do that?<eos> Oh. I do do that.<eos> You also have a tendency to change the subject and ask a lot of questions when it's really bad news.<eos> - Oh, everybody does that, don't they?<eos> I had some internal bleeding to my temporal lobe from the fall, and it's caused some cognitive impairment.
He could have done something to the engine or cut the brakes.<eos> If Layla's car was tampered with, we'll figure it out.<eos> You have my word.<eos> The bullet passed between the clavicle and first rib.<eos> It struck and perforated the right peronial vein and the right thoracic artery.
Alice, let him go.<eos> Jane.<eos> Please.<eos> Jane?<eos> Knock it down.
Very likely.<eos> Well, then she pulled it out of his pocket and then took off.<eos> - Well, I can't testify to that.<eos> - Why?<eos> A bloody wallet only means that it was on the victim at the time he was bleeding.
Well, then she pulled it out of his pocket and then took off.<eos> - Well, I can't testify to that.<eos> - Why?<eos> A bloody wallet only means that it was on the victim at the time he was bleeding.<eos> It doesn't place Christine herself at the scene.
Well, I have been reading the research about Chiari Malformations.<eos> - It may be the source of my condition.<eos> - Okay.<eos> What's it say?<eos> Well, there is a procedure to alleviate the pressure on the cerebellum, and it could eliminate my symptoms entirely.
I didn't know I'd be working at this bar.<eos> I mean, I-I didn't know a lot of things.<eos> - Nobody knows the future.<eos> - Exactly.<eos> It is, by definition, unknown.
- Here we go.<eos> - There must be a hundred or more.<eos> So the address wasn't a mistake.<eos> What happens to mail that's undeliverable?<eos> Well, it goes to a dead letter bin in each post office, then its usually shipped to the dead letter office in Atlanta.
I've experienced some symptoms, headaches, um, occasional memory loss.<eos> Yes, I-I was diagnosed with Chiari Malformation after the fall.<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, I've decided to have decompression surgery.<eos> My... my doctor thinks that it could eliminate some of the pressure caused from the injury.
Rizzoli. ‭Isles.<eos> Yeah, I got it. ‭Okay.<eos> We'll be right there.<eos> What about your surgery?<eos> Well, it's not till 1, so I figured I would work till then just like any other day.
I'm not saying that because you said something nice about me.<eos> Really, like, you... are you sure that you're okay?<eos> You know, the surgery went well.<eos> I feel pretty good.<eos> But will it fix the problem?
I feel pretty good.<eos> But will it fix the problem?<eos> Only time will tell.<eos> I thought some homemade chicken soup would be perfect.<eos> And the compound carnosine... it purifies the blood and it aids in healing.
But will it fix the problem?<eos> Only time will tell.<eos> I thought some homemade chicken soup would be perfect.<eos> And the compound carnosine... it purifies the blood and it aids in healing.<eos> And it smells so good. ‭Mm.
- I'm sorry. I mean, he died.<eos> Uh, like I said, he was a senior board member.<eos> Does anybody else know the story?<eos> I hope not.<eos> It could ruin our hospital.
- That was a long time ago, Ms. Najafi.<eos> People will come back to a hospital if they get an infection, Sergeant.<eos> In fact, it's expected.<eos> But no one will come to a haunted hospital.<eos> We'll be discreet, but we have to check out every lead, even if it involves a story none of us believes.
What'd she try to take?<eos> A list of the patients that died in 1905.<eos> She wanted to research the families and see if they knew anything about Hateful Hannah.<eos> I'll have Nina run the names on the list, but that list is over a hundred years old.<eos> I doubt it has anything to do with our case.
So... not spontaneous human combustion?<eos> More like murder.<eos> I'll have Kent test the water bottle pieces for any explosive residue.<eos> And facial recognition gave you all those results?<eos> The sketch may look like our victim to the human eye, but if it's off by even a few millimeters, the software can think it's a different person.
She's gonna hate that she missed out on the fat bomb.<eos> [Chuckles] Well, it's actually a lipid-accelerating exothermic combustive device.<eos> No, that's not as sexy as fat bomb.<eos> Well, the office of the Chief Medical Examiner is not gonna write "fat bomb" as a cause of death.<eos> It's made of fat.
How is that possible?<eos> - Hey.<eos> - Hey.<eos> Oh, so did you go with the dark roast?<eos> Mm-hmm. It's great with the hazelnut cream.
That sounds good.<eos> Nina?<eos> Yeah, I'd like that.<eos> Frankie, would you get my coat?<eos> - It's on my chair.
Do you mind if we pray for you?<eos> Of course not.<eos> But I must emphasize... the prognosis, it's... it's out of my hands.<eos> We agree.<eos> It is in much higher hands than yours.
Do not hug me.<eos> Nice day for an exhumation.<eos> This a recent Mason's funeral?<eos> Well, according to the cemetery, yes.<eos> But according to the funeral home... It never happened.
What is it?<eos> I think it saved Monroe's life.<eos> He was bitten on his arm.<eos> The wound healed.<eos> It completely disappeared.
House is clear.<eos> No Mrs. Miller.<eos> I think we should go with the "she was forced to lie" theory.<eos> Check the 911 call.<eos> See what phone it was made from and what time.
We don't have to stop.<eos> I'm afraid we do.<eos> Adalind needs to understand how important family values are to the Cause.<eos> Our relationship isn't helping.<eos> Well, it's helping me.
The young man's attorneys are moving forward.<eos> Just give me a straight answer.<eos> I deserve one straight answer.<eos> Okay.<eos> Here it is.
Time's up<eos> Oh no Uraki, there are kids down there<eos> How is that possible?<eos> -Didn't they lock down the area?<eos> Don't blow it up yet I'll take care of it for sure, trust me.
There's one coming now<eos> Did she do it?<eos> It's working<eos> You did in fact beat me, but the world will not change<eos> It never has
Oh. Sporting equipment.<eos> Y-You have sporting equipment?<eos> Well, oh, it's just a... it's a... a golf ball that my brother threw at my head.<eos> You can still feel the dent.<eos> It's right next to the hockey puck dent.
Someone rigged the bed to electrocute him.<eos> Is he dead?<eos> Sorry, Castle, but this time, he really is dead.<eos> What a waste.<eos> To be given a second chance and have it taken away like this.
Ready?<eos> And just because you or I might not be able to see it doesn't mean it isn't there. Now, I certainly hope this man didn't kill his own child.<eos> Whoa!<eos> But at the end of the day my loyalty isn't to him.<eos> It's to the kid.
We do make a good team, don't we?<eos> Well, uh, t... we've been working together a long time.<eos> That's all.<eos> There's-there's nothing special about my relationship with Dr. Vaziri.<eos> It's, uh, no different than my relationship with any of the other interns.
Three faint punctures on the proximal end of the victim's left ulna.<eos> The wounds appear to be equidistantly positioned.<eos> And if you were to connect the dots, they'd form a straight line.<eos> The description of the injuries fits the edge of a serrated blade.<eos> For a blade to have created this injury, it would have first needed to transect the ulnar artery.
- Mommy says it's educational.<eos> Well, a frozen body was recovered from a melting Alaskan ice floe.<eos> Oh, that's just great.<eos> So now Christine can have nightmares about Popsicle Man.<eos> While medical examiners have yet to identify the body, it was found in the same northern Alaska region where billionaire explorer Henry Charles mysteriously disappeared 15 years ago.
I am on it.<eos> Angie, found the murder weapon.<eos> It's a high-end ice Axe.<eos> Yikes.<eos> Do you know whose it was?
Anything good?<eos> What? You think I speak French? Here, it's all yours.<eos> Okay.<eos> Here's what's gonna happen.<eos> I'm gonna go read this file, because it's in English.
I did look into the evidence.<eos> I also read everything I could about the body you found in France, the "scout" from the last heist, but nothing gave me cause of death.<eos> Well, that's because we could not determine it.<eos> The body was dumped in the waters off Saint-Tropez.<eos> It wasn't found until weeks later.
Right here.<eos> - Where is he?<eos> - The vault.<eos> But he closed the security door.<eos> So open it.
I can't believe you've come back.<eos> I-I didn't mean what I said about "Supernatural."<eos> It's underrated -- due for a reboot.<eos> And this bar -- it's not crappy at all.<eos> It's just like the one in "Cheers."
Better?<eos> What about us?<eos> What about Earth?<eos> Earth will be fine.<eos> It's got you... and Sam.
I was a Girl Scout.<eos> - A Girl Scout?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Still got the uniform?<eos> Yeah, but it's too small and it smells like cookies.
Vettes and Porsches parked on the streets of New York.<eos> But you're saying I stole a 2012 four-door from a valet lot in Connecticut?<eos> Any car will do when you're looking to commit a murder, right?<eos> And you're forgetting about the DNA.<eos> You planted it, obviously, because I didn't steal this car!
And with a little nudge, Zoe would attribute any physical evidence found to him and not you.<eos> Teri felt responsible for the whole chain of events.<eos> So to protect you and to leave your children with at least one parent not in prison, she tried to take the blame for both crimes.<eos> Fortunately for them, we understand they have very loving grandparents.<eos> Unfortunately for you, when lab work is done right, without bias, without assumption, it really does tend to convince a jury of a killer's guilt.
Chef, a word, please.<eos> It's cool, it's cool.<eos> My product... I need it back.<eos> Don't worry about it.<eos> It's well-hidden.
You need your friends around you.<eos> And you can rely on your family.<eos> That's what the injured are told, that families can help heal wounds.<eos> I'm sorry. I shouldn't have said that.<eos> Anyway, my family is falling apart because I'm no longer what it expects.
Which district are you struggling with? - District three.<eos> - District three.<eos> Ramani will never step down.<eos> - What if you deliver your list late?<eos> - It will be invalid.
Mr. Taro, you've been here for, what, 20 years, now?<eos> What have you done in that time?<eos> Not much has changed.<eos> I still hear the same things about our city.<eos> That it's dirty, that the traffic is the worst in Europe...
I never set foot there.<eos> I was on a yacht with some Norwegians.<eos> Then why a brooch was found there that night, with your hair on it?<eos> A brooch? - - Yes.<eos> How do you know it's mine?
[third phone rings] DiPaolo!<eos> DiPaolo.<eos> How about a glass of something you don't already have 20 cases of, as a thank-you?<eos> "A life-altering flourless chocolate torte that maybe came from Heaven."<eos> Actually, it came from the garbage, but, you know, why quibble?
Used to be the dealers had to take whatever you gave them but now, Antoine's offering them more.<eos> And they feel safe going over to him because he got a big operation up and running fast.<eos> Around the same time you decided to have a marathon group sex session.<eos> This is the kind of plain speaking I have craved.<eos> That orgy was his idea and it was a horrible mistake.
When you first appeared on the scene six years ago, the evidence suggests it was the work of a single man.<eos> It was a uniquely destructive force.<eos> Other serial bombers-- like Ted Kaczynski, George Metesky-- they were motivated by a misguided grudge against society, but the Bensonhurst Bomber was driven by something darker.<eos> He's not seeking revenge, he just has a passion for making things go bang.<eos> But the thing about passion is it can be taught, it can be learned.
So far up Mr. Goggle's...<eos> If we can even manage to get a word in.<eos> I don't understand why they were tracking us in the first place.<eos> Because they're the Justice Society of America, the single greatest secret force this country has ever known.<eos> If it's so secret, how do you know about them?
Maybe not.<eos> But I ask you, would I rather hold my son again or his armor?<eos> Your son, obviously.<eos> An armor is nothing but iron, leather, and silk.<eos> It can be replaced, but the man who wears the armor is...
I got a theory.<eos> What if when you interacted with your younger self in 1987, you...<eos> Inadvertently changed my past so... so that my memories from my new life are supplanting the memories from my old life, thus creating temporal dissonance.<eos> Yeah, that's exactly what I was thinking.<eos> Oh, it's a brilliant theory, which I happen to share with you, but it doesn't explain...
See?<eos> Oh, that doesn't sound good.<eos> Guys, it's up to us to show the Dominators we're better than this.<eos> Fascinating.<eos> The creature's nervous system is not unlike our own, which means it must be capable of experiencing pain.
Since your last plan was a total bust,<eos> I suggest somebody else do the strategic thinking.<eos> Let me guess, that's you?<eos> All right, so let's hear your brilliant idea.<eos> Well, I don't have one, but it's gonna be better than yours.
You mean people.<eos> Yeah, yeah.<eos> Um, I created another timeline.<eos> Uh, it's the one we're living in now.<eos> It's not as different as the last one.
I'm sorry, it's just something I need to see to know what I'm looking for. - Sure.<eos> - Great, thank you.<eos> Wait, why does this say the body's place of discovery was Williamson when it was found on the waterfront in Leawood?<eos> The body ended up in Leawood.<eos> There was a strong current this morning, so chances are that it originated from Williamson.
- That's good.<eos> Thank you, we had a Mirror Master on our Earth, Evan McCulloch.<eos> Wasn't a meta, though.<eos> He had some kind of mirror gun that he used.<eos> - How'd it work?
Oh, no, on this Earth, I believe you say...<eos> - Good morning.<eos> - Good morning.<eos> And it is, isn't it? I mean...<eos> The music on your Earth, well, it strikes a chord, no pun intended.
- Good morning.<eos> And it is, isn't it? I mean...<eos> The music on your Earth, well, it strikes a chord, no pun intended.<eos> Please, help yourself.<eos> I find a crew works best when it's well-fed and well-rested.
We're gonna help you figure this out, Caitlin.<eos> Let's get you to the lab.<eos> What's this?<eos> It's to test how your ability affects molecular motion.<eos> That shaft is solid tungsten, and it's heated to over 2,000 degrees centigrade.
A pattern.<eos> The creature's movements, they seemed random at first, but they were contained to a prescribed area.<eos> You know, like the creature was stuck in an invisible fence.<eos> Traffic cameras were down, right?<eos> Maybe it was being watched or controlled by somebody that needed to keep it in visual range the entire time?
Something like you'd see in a coma patient.<eos> I was in a coma after I got my powers.<eos> Maybe it's a similar process.<eos> Can we take him out?<eos> When a caterpillar is in its chrysalis, it literally breaks its body down into enzyme soup before rebuilding as a butterfly.
Growing up, I used to practice the Hippocratic Oath.<eos> I was obsessed with it.<eos> If anyone was even gonna step on a bug, I would say, "Do no harm."<eos> It's built into my DNA.<eos> Unfortunately, my DNA isn't what it used to be.
It just does that.<eos> I have no idea how.<eos> Your mask looks cool, by the way.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Actually, it still feels a little weird on my face.
Well, for all accounts, she's actually going pretty easy on him.<eos> Thanks for taking the time.<eos> Thank you for giving me a chance to explain my side of the issues.<eos> Well, I said I'd give you a month without any negative headlines.<eos> Clock's ticking, and it's ticking on the other thing, too.
If that's code for "are you still drinking," then my answer hasn't changed since the last 50 times you asked me.<eos> Oliver, I think we have a real lead on who Prometheus is.<eos> He's a member of the SCPD.<eos> ♪ I'm a one-man show ♪ What's with the music?<eos> It keeps the girls mellow.
They were not able to identify the owner of that account, but since I doubt even a man as Machiavellian as you would have lured Kurtz into spying on him only to kill him later, it would appear to support your innocence.<eos> You seem displeased.<eos> With myself.<eos> I often say detection should be an exact science.<eos> It should be cold, unclouded by emotion.
'Cause it's a pattern I've seen before.<eos> It's a gag she used to name her operatives for her own amusement.<eos> She used for her amusement?<eos> We've dealt with this organization before, Watson.<eos> It was run by Moriarty.
Your mom is just trying to do what's best for you, all right?<eos> So easy to lose our way, to be distracted by our egos, our desires, our anger, and...<eos> and fears, and forget what we're meant to do, and by forgetting, we hurt others.<eos> It happened to me this week.<eos> I had revenge in my heart, and, uh, you know where it left me?
Insomnia!<eos> The jewel in the crown of the Lucian kingdom.<eos> How foolish of me to forget.<eos> There is just one more trivial thing.<eos> It concerns your son.
Most all will welcome this peace.<eos> If you yourself have not heard their voices how can you claim to know their hearts?<eos> What of the mission to Tenebrae, Your Majesty?<eos> Is such clandestine action wise?<eos> If discovered, it will only serve to provoke the empire.
Give me the wheel.<eos> Go.<eos> You are without your magic.<eos> You noticed that, huh?<eos> It must have died with the king.
He is bound by the past, and lost in his lust for power.<eos> How the hell did they find us?<eos> Your hairpin.<eos> They're tracking it.<eos> Give it to me.
I couldn't save her.<eos> I was as helpless then as I am now.<eos> I couldn't show her the future she wanted.<eos> True power is not something that is found by those who seek it.<eos> It is something that comes to those who deserve it.
And that brings us to "Z" gauge, at a "you could easily swallow it, don't ask how I know," 1/220.<eos> I'm sorry, I have to ask.<eos> When I was five, I ingested a "Z" gauge locomotive.<eos> I spent the next three days saying, "I think I can pass it,<eos> I think I can pass it, I think I can pass it."
I just wanted to say how sorry I am.<eos> Tell me what happened.<eos> Tell me.<eos> One of Davies' men shot the gas canister.<eos> It was leaking, so we ran.
The vomeronasal organ.<eos> Also known as Jacobson's organ.<eos> It's a sort of... primitive olfactory receptor.<eos> It sits in front of the brain.<eos> When a snake flicks its tongue, it's gathering particles to process through its Jacobson's organ.
I'm sorry.<eos> Yeah.<eos> It's probably better she never saw any of this.<eos> There's nothing beautiful left in Caraquet.<eos> Well, Caraquet... the world... is not what it used to be.
Don't be scared.<eos> - Zoe, I...<eos> You guys...<eos> Your energy...<eos> It's glowing.
They were playing with it.<eos> Your gun?<eos> You have a gun?<eos> Yes, I do.<eos> But it's locked.
Just like you said... for protection.<eos> Have you used it?<eos> No.<eos> I haven't needed to, thank God.<eos> Thank God you haven't had it used against you. All right.
This is Dr. Robbins.<eos> I'm sorry. From where?<eos> Sometimes I wonder Yes, I am.<eos> Yeah, you bet I have a minute. How it would be<eos> There's a chance of some recovery of movement, but it's very small.
But he'll never walk again?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> It's very unlikely.<eos> The gun was locked up.<eos> It was supposed to be locked in a drawer. It was.
Infections have a nasty way of sneaking up on you.<eos> You're feeling pretty good, you think the infection's gone, and then it reappears... out of nowhere... when your body's still weak, when you've barely recovered...
- You sure?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Congratulations on the new house.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> And once the infection spreads, once it gets into your bloodstream, well, then you really have to watch it.
I feel like I've seen the bounds and pushed them a couple of times.<eos> - It's gonna rain.<eos> - It's not gonna rain.<eos> Told her to have the reception indoors.<eos> This wedding is doomed even if it happens because it's definitely going to rain.
Are you telling me that you think that's coming around again?<eos> That was different.<eos> How?<eos> Love definitely has bounds.<eos> I've seen where it ends.
And you were arrested before.<eos> I do my homework. So, you know there's a lot of ways it can play out.<eos> There seems to be one obvious one.<eos> Not really... because someone who goes to the trouble to stage a big show like the one that we just saw, doesn't make the mistake of leaving a gun in his locker, right?<eos> - It's my dad's gun.
You don't know what to feel.<eos> Should you be furious?<eos> Should you be frightened?<eos> Should you be sad?<eos> It can swallow you up or weigh you down or ignite a fire inside you.
I was with Mr. Branson.<eos> And I'm just feeling really guilty about it.<eos> Seth Branson?<eos> I'm sure you know our history.<eos> Except, it's not history.
I'm gonna find and stop whoever tried to kill you.<eos> There's a manhunt on for an escaped prisoner named Ruslan Krasnov.<eos> Ruslan is just the trigger man, he's not the architect of the assassination attempt.<eos> We've dealt with this organization before, Watson.<eos> It was run by Moriarty.
But how about the blood on yours?<eos> Give me the name.<eos> When the individual is brought to justice, you can read about it in the paper, just like everyone else.<eos> Don't drink the camel milk.<eos> It's expired.
I'm never going to let that happen.<eos> I have all the cards.<eos> Can you not see this?<eos> Change is coming.<eos> But it can be good for all of us.
The kids also captured.<eos> The kids?<eos> =The kids, Dong Yi and Mal Soon.=<eos> You have to hurry up come here.<eos> I'm not really sure the address. In front of my house, there's the main road, right? Pass it through the right you'll see a cottage.
Yeah.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> [Ruby] Ferg just called.<eos> A body turned up, middle-aged male.<eos> And it fits Vincent Parr's description.
Now this is a change of heart.<eos> You were so ready to leave Berlin.<eos> Not quite yet.<eos> The Station needs me now.<eos> It's a mess.
Mommy, pizza is here.<eos> Can I open the door for him?<eos> I just ordered it.<eos> It'll take a while.<eos> It's here.
Your mistress?<eos> - My-my wife.<eos> - Oh, delightful.<eos> Listen to the watch.<eos> The way it's ticking synchronizes with your heartbeat.
I don't know what you're saying.<eos> Vash zavtrak gotov.<eos> It's not important.<eos> What is important is that I have found someone.<eos> What good is love if it's one-sided?
Maybe.<eos> You're good.<eos> I know.<eos> Detective, interesting pool of blood through here.<eos> I'm assuming it belongs to Cinderella here.
Oh, she's here! Lovely.<eos> Did the mini kitchen come, too?<eos> Lucifer, you shouldn't have gotten her the doll.<eos> It's fine.<eos> You can say it's from you. Oh.
Of course you are right, Onoda-kakka, but wherever there is power there is subversion, whether in Manchuria or here.<eos> Kakka, may I raise with you again the subject of the films?<eos> You missed the point, Kido-tai'i.<eos> We are seen as weak.<eos> If a nation is seen as weak, it is weak.
You're not breathing.<eos> That's because I'm a little nervous.<eos> You needn't be.<eos> This device is not on a timer.<eos> It's designed to be detonated remotely, and since no one saw us enter, we're quite safe.
- Oh, thank you.<eos> FYI?<eos> The "here" your best thinking got you to is this bar, richer than you were a few hours ago by $100,000.<eos> I'm gonna buy that bottle.<eos> Don't buy it.
But it lasted for weeks during which time many other unfortunates like us came to join us.<eos> We did not know what he wanted from us and we couldn't begin to imagine.<eos> 1825.<eos> The slave trade, banned by France for 7 years, continued covertly between Africa and America.<eos> Although France had abolished slavery in 1794, Napoleon reinstated it.
And in truth, I think it's better than ours.<eos> When the music beats, our daughter can't sleep.<eos> Maybe you should go see her.<eos> If the music can turn the heads of grown men,<eos> God knows how it can turn the head of a girl of 13.
We found them in Paimpont forest.<eos> He told me he'd be away longer than expected.<eos> He sent me an SMS.<eos> Look at the time.<eos> It was sent after the victim's death.
Hey, how do I lock this?<eos> Hey, are you listening?<eos> Let it go.<eos> What?<eos> I don't think they know how to open it.
Jin-hee!<eos> Open it now!<eos> It won't budge!<eos> I can't open it!<eos> Smash it!
I know we can figure this out.<eos> This place can't be completely sealed.<eos> We'd run out of air, right?<eos> Wait, if air is coming in...<eos> It has to be going out.
How could I have missed that? What? What's wrong?<eos> - It's bugged!<eos> - What is?<eos> The camera in the storage unit.<eos> The killer put it there.
This is about us. And that's where we first met.<eos> I'm sure that this is it. But what is he trying to do?<eos> Why is he sending us there? Whoever's doing this is screwing with us.<eos> Sending us to a place we used to love, trying to ruin it... It's important to them because it's important to us.<eos> When my mom got sick, it was the only place where I felt okay, the only place i could forget what was going on.
Do you feel it?<eos> I feel... dizzy.<eos> Weightless. There's a window...<eos> And you can see the earth below.<eos> It's a blue, swirling marble.
If someone's trying to pilot it this way, they're gonna turn 'round the moment they see all these uniforms.<eos> Clara Meades?<eos> I'm Karin Parke.<eos> Did you pack a bag?<eos> - Yeah, it's by the door.
- Mm-hmm. - Rambling.<eos> Is that a problem?<eos> People sometimes talk more when they're afraid.<eos> Helps compensate for the fear.<eos> - Masks it, too.
You have something other than coffee for me?<eos> Look, Agent, I'm not one of those street-corner informants that you slip a few gringo dollars for a tip.<eos> No, sir. Then why are we here?<eos> Agent, you and I are like the snake and the cat.<eos> If the snake has the chance, it will kill the cat.
Look, Agent, I'm not one of those street-corner informants that you slip a few gringo dollars for a tip.<eos> No, sir. Then why are we here?<eos> Agent, you and I are like the snake and the cat.<eos> If the snake has the chance, it will kill the cat.<eos> And if the cat has the chance, it will kill the snake.
- Colonel, how are you doing?<eos> - Very well.<eos> I enjoyed your speech very much, Mr. President.<eos> I'm glad.<eos> It was also for you.
But if you're gonna run a cocaine empire, you need to have a lot of cash on hand.<eos> And getting cash back into Colombia wasn't easy.<eos> Let me put it this way:<eos> This is what a ton of cocaine looks like.<eos> And here's what the same ton of cocaine looks like when it's converted into cash.
- "But I feel good.<eos> I feel strong.<eos> And I have the will to fight all of these injustices.<eos> The government has made a mockery of our rights.<eos> It's allowed our justice system to become corrupted by murderers.
This is the sort of place where you can drive cars at speeds that you can do on the road but only if you want to go to prison afterwards.<eos> What, like 38 miles an hour?<eos> 39 maybe even, 40 from time to time.<eos> Now, we were hoping that we could bring it round the world with us like the tent.<eos> But unfortunately it's too heavy, and, as you are about to see, too bitey.
I've got it.<eos> I've almost got it.<eos> I've got him.<eos> That pod...<eos> It's identical to mine.
A bat bit me in the last one.<eos> Whiner.<eos> Hey, sis.<eos> You knew about this place, too?<eos> Yeah, it's like a block from my apartment.
Whiner.<eos> Hey, sis.<eos> You knew about this place, too?<eos> Yeah, it's like a block from my apartment.<eos> It's kind of like the old place.
Sway.<eos> Did Ms. Grant seem a little off to you?<eos> She's always like that with Clark.<eos> She goes gaga for him.<eos> She actually sent him a drunk text once. It was...
You wrote this story about a rooster.<eos> I don't remember the name of it.<eos> "Cock Tease."<eos> Yes.<eos> It was so messed up. But Mrs. Bumgarner loved it.
Yes.<eos> It was so messed up. But Mrs. Bumgarner loved it.<eos> She made you stand up, read it to the class.<eos> Your face turned red, your voice shook.<eos> But it was good.
It's bollocks.<eos> The people of Slovenia have no more idea than the people of the UK and the people in Sweden or the people of Spain what in fact is going on.<eos> I wouldn't profess to understand the detail of how it all works, and I think part of that is deliberate.<eos> One side knows, if one side is a priesthood and knows how it all works and the rest of us ordinary citizens don't know how it works, a massive transfer of power takes place.<eos> It was devised to make sure that the great mass of the people could not control government, ever again.
The Great War is in this as in many other aspects a great watershed in British history.<eos> During the war, there's incredibly detailed state control of a whole range of industries.<eos> By the end of the war, there's a feeling that there needs to be much more permanent regulation and control of society by the state.<eos> A company was no longer private property, it was a national asset, to be directed from above.<eos> The government increasingly thought that it should plan, it should control, it should regulate.
As for the shower - well, we've all seen Psycho - murdering girls like that is now strictly prohibited.<eos> Shampoo can get in your eyes and cause discomfort - 118 laws.<eos> EU bureaucrats seem terrified by towels for some reason, slightly more relaxed about radiators.<eos> There are 1246 laws relating to bread, but just 52 covering the crazy anarchic toaster.<eos> Just 84 laws covering fridges, but an impressive 12 000 laws cover milk - after all, it might go off.
They are unmoved by criticism, untroubled by popular discontent.<eos> But the frustration of ordinary people is beginning to show.<eos> We now have to focus on constructing a firewall to prevent contagion within the Eurozone.<eos> What you can see everywhere is a conflict between the visions of a rather narrow kind of professional middle class, which is dominant in European politics, and the reaction against it by the larger bulk of the European population.<eos> Eventually if you stuff dictatorship down the throats of people who don't want it, they will rebel.
[European rallies] Unfortunately, in many places, it's taking a very unpleasant form of right-wing populist nationalism.<eos> Extremism at both ends is being fostered by the anti-democratic nature of the European Union.<eos> What do we see?<eos> Far-right parties, ultra-nationalist parties.<eos> We don't know what the future of Europe is going to look like, but at the moment, it's not looking good.
The future consists of nations in Asia and America and Africa.<eos> Getting stuck in Fortress Europe is the worst thing that could happen to us.<eos> The idea that we have to stay in the EU for our prosperity is wrong-headed.<eos> Why do we need to attach ourselves to the one part of the world that is doing really badly?<eos> Within Europe we know what our future's going to be to some extent – it's going to be pretty stagnant, while the rest of the world roars ahead.
I just walked through.<eos> That's enough!<eos> Come here.<eos> Get them upstairs.<eos> This op's already taken longer than it should have.
The lizard could be anywhere.<eos> Which is not good because planes and ice don't really mix well.<eos> Oh, hey.<eos> Hey, hey.<eos> Is it alive?
Well, I don't think medical attention's his priority right now.<eos> I shot him in the shoulder, it tends to sting a little.<eos> Well, you speared Kovacs through the chest... He kept coming.<eos> Look, the mutation causes an adrenaline rush.<eos> It blocks the transmission of pain.
Not important.<eos> Ah, very well, Not Important.<eos> Can you bring me my bag?<eos> Now, why would I do that?<eos> It's for Jackson.
Safeties off!<eos> Let's go.<eos> All right.<eos> Shouldn't this stuff be in Fort Knox or something?<eos> It was.
Cover your mouth and nose.<eos> It's halothane.<eos> Knockout gas.<eos> Whoever's chasing the DNA is still here.<eos> There it is.
So you're wondering what the big cats do, right?<eos> Yes.<eos> Well, you're standing on it.<eos> When Leonard Pierce and the Shepherd founders first arrived, this island was barely 200 square miles.<eos> Now, it's 20 times that size, thanks to the saber-tooths.
All I know is that every couple months, there are underwater volcanic eruptions around the island and when the lava flow cools... more beachfront property.<eos> What was that?<eos> What's wrong?<eos> We're not tracking this cat.<eos> It's tracking us.
There's a car wash on the corner of Lincoln and 223rd Street.<eos> I'll meet you there.<eos> I'm taking you to your friends.<eos> Who are you?<eos> Someone who wants to see the world back to how it's supposed to be.
There are seven launch points around the island.<eos> The birds are ready when you are, Professor.<eos> I wish Chloe were here.<eos> Chloe would have loved this day more than anything.<eos> To see the animals, the world, back to the way it once was.
He's got no clothes in the suitcase! You know what it is, I'm starting to think about things now.<eos> It's actually-<eos> - Casey, it's not your fault, brother.<eos> It's not the writer's fault this show is so bad.<eos> And it's so bad!
I'm here to spare you from this.<eos> Kid, look... your music...<eos> - your music is always gonna be there.<eos> - Well, so will school.<eos> No! It's not.
You say-- "Hey!<eos> Give me that machine back!"<eos> They say, "No,<eos> "this magically appeared from nowhere, and is clearly meant for us, you give us your machine."<eos> "No, you don't even know what it does!" "We don't care, we're super crazy!"
- Why?<eos> - Well, the guy's a prick.<eos> Did you work closely with him?<eos> No, thank God.<eos> He used to be in charge of the old animal transfer unit, but it's abandoned now.
Is this, you know, a universe thing?<eos> Like, if I don't do this now, the universe goes all weird?<eos> The universe is already weird, Todd.<eos> If you don't tell her now, and we get... killed later...<eos> I'll go with Farah and take the machine back to the Spring Mansion, and figure out what the hell it does. Oh!
I have a theory.<eos> I have a theory, and I don't like it at all, but it's... it's my theory right now, and right now that's all I got.<eos> So, uh...<eos> I'm gonna explain it to you, and... if you understand it,<eos> I mean, if you follow it all the way through, you gotta tell me, you gotta help me, and you gotta confirm or deny whether it's accurate, 'cause... right now I feel like I'm losing my mind a little.
I like that he's there for you. I like that he's doing this even though he doesn't have to.<eos> Call him again.<eos> He's not much of a phone-answerer, in my experience.<eos> Once we plug in the machine, everything will become clear, I'm sure of it.<eos> You don't even know what it does.
Call him again.<eos> He's not much of a phone-answerer, in my experience.<eos> Once we plug in the machine, everything will become clear, I'm sure of it.<eos> You don't even know what it does.<eos> Well, I mean, clearly, it... clarifies everything?
Once we plug in the machine, everything will become clear, I'm sure of it.<eos> You don't even know what it does.<eos> Well, I mean, clearly, it... clarifies everything?<eos> Show me.<eos> Does it do that?
Well, the shark did, certainly.<eos> This "machine," where is it?<eos> Here, right here.<eos> We put it together ourselves, so some bits might be on backwards, but...<eos> This is it.
Just do it, I give up.<eos> You get hurt once and you give up?<eos> I can't get hurt.<eos> I'm always safe, I can't get hurt...<eos> Yeah, well, a roller coaster is safe, too, unless it goes off the tracks.
We won't be here, Todd!<eos> Come on, grab hold!<eos> I'm saving us!<eos> How are you going to save us with an Unlimited Energy Machine?<eos> It's not an Unlimited Energy Machine, and that's not the Soul Exchanger.
Um, I have to ask you a question from her.<eos> - Maestro. - Oh, Beppi.<eos> I've come to wish you merda, tanta merda.<eos> Grazie, grazie<eos> And to ask you whether you might consider to wear this camera during the performance. It's a tiny, tiny camera.
I've come to wish you merda, tanta merda.<eos> Grazie, grazie<eos> And to ask you whether you might consider to wear this camera during the performance. It's a tiny, tiny camera.<eos> - Camera.<eos> - Yes. It will give the world-wide audience a conductor's eye view.
Thank you.<eos> I don't remember a car accident.<eos> Old man in an old car, T-boned a new Mercedes.<eos> Pretty much right on top of you.<eos> Wall hadn't been under repair, it probably wouldn't have fallen.
Thank you, Dr. Cohen.<eos> Myra, please.<eos> I'm gonna start with some thoughts I have.<eos> And if I'm wrong about any of them, you stop me, all right?<eos> This refuge you've created has kept you going, but it's also trapped you in the past.
Myra, please.<eos> I'm gonna start with some thoughts I have.<eos> And if I'm wrong about any of them, you stop me, all right?<eos> This refuge you've created has kept you going, but it's also trapped you in the past.<eos> It lets you pretend you are a person to whom nothing has happened.

I'm making a citizen's arrest,<eos> - the kid stole my bag.<eos> - This bag here?<eos> - Give me that?<eos> - Worth knickin', is it?
Prince Theo will be arriving at the hospital in the next 30 minutes, and we will break to coverage as soon as it begins.<eos> This is CNB News.<eos> Stop.<eos> Uh, street's closed, mate.<eos> Turn it around.
We've gotten out of this before. We can do it again.<eos> - New circumstances, but--<eos> - M! How'd you cut the rope?<eos> After all our escape room problems, I invented this special hair clip.<eos> It's called Cam's Multipurpose Hair Clip with Assorted Tools to Deal with Any Dangerous Situation.
There's not much time.<eos> Give me your best wishes, Ciro.<eos> I know you, you're like me.<eos> This thing's eating your gut, like poison.<eos> It's consuming you.
Why do you ask?<eos> It doesn't matter.<eos> We won.<eos> And the Rhodia have a particularly cruel punishment.<eos> It is just.
Oh, God.<eos> When?<eos> On our way to the base.<eos> How many casualties?<eos> The blast was substantial enough to put my driver into a coma, but we both know it should have been in the megaton range.
You asked for a hint, I gave you one.<eos> -Look, I really need to go. -No, wait.<eos> Just one more question.<eos> This FBI business?<eos> Is it dangerous?
In fact, we're the ones who took it from him.<eos> The material's in that black bag on my associate's shoulder.<eos> In a bag that size?<eos> No.<eos> It is pretty heavy.
You've known the whole time. It must have been brutal.<eos> Okay, I can give you a neurotransmitter stimulant I developed for a mission<eos> - that should help you short-term, but...<eos> - Thank you for the second opinion.<eos> I wish it was a better one.
Just give me one second here. I'm almost done.<eos> There we go.<eos> Sit.<eos> How conversant are you with the theory of quantum entanglement?<eos> Um, I know it's the basis of how we transfer consciousness.
Because I'm green?<eos> Think of a turtle.<eos> Crossing the road.<eos> It doesn't care about the cars.<eos> It thinks the shell will protect it.
Think of a turtle.<eos> Crossing the road.<eos> It doesn't care about the cars.<eos> It thinks the shell will protect it.<eos> But in reality, it's fragile.
He's one of the best journalists I've ever known. And he has the apparel to match.<eos> Shabby, not so chic.<eos> Mr. Carr, it's... it's an honor to meet you.<eos> I've read your series on corruption in the mayor's office. It was...<eos> Well, it won the Pulitzer.
And more importantly, this is really gross!<eos> I mean-- [gagging]<eos> Sage, are you listening?<eos> You'll have to ask my soul.<eos> It controls my body's answering machine.
Stop poking me! I'm trying to give you an award.<eos> A little thanks would be appreciated, you know.<eos> [screaming in pain]<eos> Yeah, you're welcome! How long... [slurping] is this ceremony going to last?<eos> It's taking forever!

Of dying of sadness because my prized possession has been stolen.<eos> Your crown is on your head.<eos> I'm not talking about my crown.<eos> I'm talking about my beloved jumping bean.<eos> [Julien] It's a bean... and it jumps.
You like that?<eos> Wanna see it again?<eos> Oh. Actually it's not--<eos> How do you like the hand now, Julien?<eos> How do you like it now?
I was lost, but now I'm funky.<eos> Actually, he said "found," but I thought that was a cliche so I put a little KJ stink on it.<eos> King Julien, I knew you'd return.<eos> Here, take my hat for good luck.<eos> [laughs] It's yours.
Here, take my hat for good luck.<eos> [laughs] It's yours.<eos> Take it.<eos> Here!<eos> It's... just put your fingers on it.
And then what?<eos> The truth came clear and had to be said.<eos> I'm not sure it HAD to be said.<eos> That's what I mean, I couldn't stop.<eos> I wanted to, but there it was, being said.
There are enough batteries to produce enough hydrogen gas to level the building.<eos> When you hacked Evil Corp, you gave us access to the backdoor.<eos> You made it possible for us to infect them.<eos> I coded the femtocell malware for Darlene.<eos> But it wasn't supposed to be for this.
Eddie, let's go around.<eos> Eddie! He's just gonna do it again!<eos> Eddie!<eos> Pay the toll?<eos> Shove it up your ass.
Sweetie? Come on, let's go another way.<eos> Eddie.<eos> Don't!<eos> What happened to your hand?<eos> Your daddy kiss it for you?
Go.<eos> Shit.<eos> Katie!<eos> So... that show?<eos> Did you bring it up, or did Katie bring it up?
and now it just shows back up again. I just need you to tell me where you went last night after you left.<eos> I know how it sounds, but I'm not crazy.<eos> You're not crazy.<eos> Believe me, it's not just a television show, okay?<eos> It did something to my brother, and it can make people do odd things.
She had a hook. Katie, she...<eos> Where did she get a hook?<eos> She's here, but something's wrong.<eos> She won't talk.<eos> Look, I know you said that... this show, it can make people do things.
Learn how to grade papers next time, Mom.<eos> Okay? [Bethany] Okay, all right.<eos> Oh, the cream shot out of my package.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Oh, that's all right. It landed on my buns.
What choice do I have?"<eos> That´s good.<eos> He´s all right.<eos> How was the lecture?<eos> It was good.
You picked a really bad time to get yourself locked up.<eos> I'm scared.<eos> Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.<eos> I want you to go home, and I want you to get my gun.<eos> What? Keep it on you, just in case.
- What--what color's the sky?<eos> - Blue.<eos> - And what color is chocolate milk?<eos> - Pink!<eos> - [chuckling] No, it's not.
- Blue.<eos> - And what color is chocolate milk?<eos> - Pink!<eos> - [chuckling] No, it's not.<eos> It's chocolate colored.
[normal] The Thea Foss Theater.<eos> It's sold out. This is gonna be huge for my career.<eos> Um, have you seen my purse?<eos> What? Why are you changing the subject?<eos> [gasps] There it is.
We're fooling ourselves thinking that we could bring to the 21st what should have been left behind.<eos> I mean, Protocol 2...<eos> "Leave the future in the past." But we both decided...<eos> We can't make exceptions because it's convenient, or personal.<eos> I mean, this relationship... we've been holding on to all this time, it's jeopardizing our team, our covers, our mission.
You?<eos> Listen, I told you that I had evidence that an attack on the director was imminent.<eos> I had no choice but to act.<eos> Well, all I can tell you is... my mission didn't come to me as a text.<eos> It came from the director, personally.
Uh-huh.<eos> You know dark matter? What?<eos> Dark matter, you know?<eos> Yeah, the thing that's all around us.<eos> Do you know why we know it's around us? No.
But you were busy.<eos> But Matteusz says the Shadows might be able to help stop it.<eos> Can you do any... Shadow stuff?<eos> This weapon, never to be used.<eos> This weapon, in which we rest ourselves, so that it will never be used.
The anchor is prepared, Your Majesty.<eos> Once I attach it, it will hold the heart in your body and you will be whole again.<eos> The results should be immediate.<eos> And there, the anchor is set.<eos> It's failing... failing...
I fed one of these an hour ago.<eos> And from that single drop of blood, it's doubled, doubled, doubled again.<eos> And it's eating squirrels.<eos> Probably all it can manage at this point. But not for long.<eos> We think a single petal slipped in through a crack in space-time just last night, and look how it's proliferated.
Dreamers, look this way. Look at the others.<eos> Take in their faces.<eos> Then go find them.<eos> Can you hear the music?<eos> It's recording.
If you can get him there within the hour.<eos> [Ferg] Walt. You should go help Billy.<eos> I can drive Harp out to the feds.<eos> The landscape out here is stunning.<eos> It really is.
So, why is he chasing you?<eos> Well, I-I thought I lost this necklace, and then I see it on the neck of J.P.'s new wife.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Whoa.<eos> That asshole stole it from me and gave it to another woman.
Right?<eos> So, I-I saw them at the Blind Tiger just now and I took it back.<eos> You stole it right off of his wife's neck.<eos> No, I didn't steal it.<eos> It's mine.
So, what do you think happened?<eos> He slept with Mrs. Crandall, then he threatened to tell Tizz, so she killed him to keep him quiet?<eos> Or Tizz caught him in the act and lost it.<eos> I mean, she's been to that cabin.<eos> She knows where it is.
And beneath protons, we found quarks.<eos> And beneath quarks, we found strings.<eos> Only strings aren't even particles at all.<eos> They're just vibrations of energy.<eos> You think the world is so solid, and then it melts.
There's a layer beneath what's going on here<eos> I can't explain.<eos> I am not a patient on your couch.<eos> Well, you're certainly behaving like one.<eos> An emotionally-stunted boy who can't stand his own feelings of helplessness because it reminds him of the psychic trauma inflicted on him by his now catatonic mother.
A week ago, you offered the Belgian nine figures.<eos> Sometimes there are hidden layers of value.<eos> What do you dream about?<eos> Woody.<eos> We have this mad, passionate love affair. Then I wake up, and it's all a dream.
But psychological stress is.<eos> And since none of this is real, it's all psychological.<eos> What is Topeka?<eos> Places need names.<eos> Our dreams together, the whole megillah, it needed a name.
This is a very hard problem because you better enter the Mars atmosphere at an incredibly blazing fast speed.<eos> Mars atmosphere is so thin that by the time you hit the ground if you didn't start the engines, you'd still be supersonic, so you've got to basically point the engines into the wind at Mach 3,<eos> you gotta fire the rockets into the supersonic airstream, zero out your blast speed, deploy landing gear and land.<eos> And you got one shot.<eos> But rockets there really don't want to work, like there's a thousand ways that a rocket can fail and one way it can succeed.
They had been test pilots and flown in the early age of the jet engines, and more than a few of them died.<eos> Challenger now heading downrange.<eos> Obviously a major malfunction, we have no downlink.<eos> Sometimes painful things like this happen, it's all part of the process of exploration and discovery.<eos> The future doesn't belong to the faint hearted, it belongs to the brave.
The only way to separate it is to break it.<eos> We all knew someone could die here.<eos> But no one ever thought it would be Ben.<eos> We picked a place to bury him outside camp out in the regolith.<eos> The sun makes this pattern on the ground, when it sets behind the cliffs.
What will life be like in an early Mars colony?<eos> Let's take some stages in terms of how we might do things on Mars.<eos> There is exploration, somebody going out and coming back.<eos> The next stage would be some sort of research station.<eos> You would mostly resupply it from Earth. You cycle people in and out on a regular basis.
Mars and how far it got and what it was like.<eos> The history of science in the last few hundred years has been the understanding that the sciences that we know on Earth are the same sciences that happen out in the universe.<eos> Physics on Earth, it's the same physics that governs the motions of planets and stars in the cosmos.<eos> Chemistry on Earth is the same chemistry out in the galaxies and the gas clouds and all these things that formed in stars.<eos> But there's a fundamental science that we do not know if it's the same out there as it is here and that's biology.
The conditions for life must have existed here, but there's a lot of red sand to sift.<eos> End report.<eos> I'm working please.<eos> Dr. Kamen, do you have a moment?<eos> I don't mean to interrupt your work, but it seems to be never ending so I thought I would just drop by.
Main engine cut off.<eos> The first stage is returning to land as the second stage powers the OrbComm satellites to low Earth orbit.<eos> The fairings have successfully deployed.<eos> The first stage will soon begin its series of three burns to head back towards Cape Canaveral.<eos> Oh... where is it going?
Okay, this is bad.<eos> Potentially bad.<eos> That is that first stage, coming back down.<eos> History in the making guys.<eos> It's standing up!
But now that she's dead...<eos> She's an unavailable declarant.<eos> Like I said, you are a good lawyer.<eos> And I'm not pretending I let a solid witness disappear when that girl was a junkie and her story was inconsistent at best.<eos> And it still should've been presented to a jury, which is what we're trying to fix.
The shit has hit the fan.<eos> Jesus.<eos> This stuff legit? You're asking me if kiddie porn is legit?<eos> ! How the fuck should I know?<eos> That's some of the most hateful stuff I've seen in my life, and yet there it is.
They're coming!<eos> Frankly, my hands are too large.<eos> Will you shut up and let him speak.<eos> What's wrong?<eos> The sickness, it killed them all.
What ultimately happened is our board looked at the issues that ALEC worked on and decided that we don't do social issues, we're focused on economic issues.<eos> We jettisoned basically almost all of our legislation that was pre-2007. So we basically...<eos> Fresh slate going forward.<eos> A fresh start going forward.<eos> This industry knows that it's dying... and is actually preparing for the next thing.
So once you've been convicted of a crime, you are in essence a slave of the state.<eos> The stroke of a pen is not self-enforcing.<eos> And so, while the 13th Amendment is hailed as this great milestone for freedom, and abolitionists celebrate, and this is the end of a lifelong quest, the reality is much more problematic.<eos> Well, once that clause is inserted in there, it becomes a tool.<eos> It's embedded in the structure.
- Fuck your breath.<eos> Stay with me.<eos> We got pulled over for a busted taillight in the back.<eos> Police violence, that isn't the problem in and of itself.<eos> It's reflection of a much larger, brutal system of racial and social control known as mass incarceration, which authorizes this kind of police violence.
And I'm not messing around.<eos> Please tell me you're kidding me.<eos> Oh, come on, this is bullshit.<eos> You know my word is good.<eos> Yeah, and I told him that, and he doesn't want to risk putting a target on his back and then find out commuting his sentence really means cutting it in half.
You're a second-year law student, Rachel.<eos> I asked you to be a part of this because you're one of my brightest students, but I also asked you in particular because I didn't think you'd be so naive.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> Your job wasn't to talk to Mr. Bailey once and, after being moved by his tale of woe, tell me to jump him to the top of the pile.<eos> It was to assess his case and present evidence.
We're looking to expand ourselves.<eos> This space would have been perfect.<eos> Are you serious?<eos> Yeah.<eos> In fact, it's so perfect, I would have made you an offer on the spot.
I'm sure you do, but I don't think you're going to find what you're looking for.<eos> What did you just say to me?<eos> I'm sorry, but you match the description of a man I was told would be walking in here right about now.<eos> And what exactly is the description?<eos> I'd rather not say, but it fit you to a T.
I'm gonna say the same thing I did when they came at me the last time.<eos> My father-in-law's innocent.<eos> Is that it or can I go?<eos> One more thing, Kevin.<eos> An indictment's coming down any second, and once it does, that makes you every single inmate's ticket out of here.
You said that you were going to find Maria.<eos> So tell me, what are you doing here instead of out there tracking her down?<eos> Leonard, I know that this is difficult, and...<eos> Mr. Bailey, what Rachel means is that's exactly what we're going to do.<eos> Mr. Cahill, you better have a compelling reason why I shouldn't grant Mr. Specter a dismissal, or this thing is going to be over before it gets started.
You're on an island with two tribes.<eos> Oh, Jesus.<eos> Does the prosecution have any questions for the witness?<eos> Does frontotemporal dementia diminish intellectual capacity, or moral clarity?<eos> No, it does not.
I liked his songs.<eos> I admire how much Harry commits to our break-ups.<eos> I mean, this is a new detail, but he does usually go the extra mile.<eos> A few times, he's even cleaned the whole flat.<eos> Like it's a crime scene.
..A Woman Robbed.<eos> CLAPPING Now, I would ask you all to leave your genitals at the door and bring your minds to these pieces.<eos> I don't believe people always think about sex when they see a naked body,<eos> I believe they think about their own minds, their own bodies, and their own power.<eos> And that's what this show is really about... ..it's about power.
A trauma surgeon is gonna come see you.<eos> She'll decide how best to proceed.<eos> Will you cut me open?<eos> Probably.<eos> If the bullet shifts inside you, it could do a lot of damage.
Man, that's insane.<eos> We just heard.<eos> Our banger, Marco?<eos> CT chest showed the bullet isn't in the midline or touching the aorta.<eos> It's in the left paraspinal muscles.
You know, if the box is utilizing phase shifting --<eos> Ma-Maybe she's just a ghost.<eos> That's also a theory.<eos> Look, the alloy in the box itself is very rare.<eos> It's only made at Momentum Labs in three locations around the world.
We all saw him.<eos> It's sleight of hand, you moron, not a superpower.<eos> Let's see if you can make a bullet disappear.<eos> You want to do the honors?<eos> Where the hell is it?
It says her last words before she was burned alive on the stake was a-a-a curse on all future constables of Willard's Mill.<eos> Get a load of this shit.<eos> This is written in some kind of ass-backwards Mexican cha-cha talk.<eos> Supposedly, Claire's necklace helped you read all this baloney.<eos> Where is it?
I knew this place was too good to be true.<eos> You've been tracking my search history.<eos> Yeah, well, you were always a sucker for a breakfast nook.<eos> But don't worry... The place is yours.<eos> And it's rent-controlled now, so...
- I didn't ask.<eos> I know what you're doing.<eos> Trying to distance yourself from everyone else so they don't drown in your wake?<eos> I invented that move.<eos> It doesn't work...
Then I hit the street... and I died.<eos> And there's nothing.<eos> It's just darkness.<eos> Then I heard a voice.<eos> It was asking me if I wanted a second chance, did I want to punish those who hurt my brother, did I want to avenge my own death.
S.H.I.E.L.D. has it.<eos> It's safe.<eos> You're safe.<eos> Stay away from this equipment.<eos> It's very dangerous.
Dr. Simmons, we need your help.<eos> Is that a Terrigenesis cocoon?<eos> In progress?<eos> It's incredibly rare to see the actual metamorphosis.<eos> It only lasts a few fleeting moments.
I'm sorry.<eos> I know how this feels.<eos> My apologies, Agent May.<eos> I'll have you cleaned up in no time.<eos> Once we crack that bottle, it's open ... no going back.
Fucking asses!<eos> Hey!<eos> Me my gun you fuckers give back!<eos> - Scumbag!<eos> Give it to me, you asshole!
Unless you're planning to kill me.<eos> No, not at the moment.<eos> That was some ultimatum you gave Ms. Lawler out there.<eos> That's not why I agreed to see you.<eos> This list of yours that you're releasing, it could damage the careers of some very fine public servants, but it won't hurt me one iota.
He's seven.<eos> This is going to sound strange.<eos> We're good with strange.<eos> I used to have a drawing of this same boy.<eos> But it was 30 years old.
We're good with strange.<eos> I used to have a drawing of this same boy.<eos> But it was 30 years old.<eos> The ambassador got it for me.<eos> I found out recently it was on the back of a record album.
Aaron, it's already out there.<eos> Besides, he wasn't fired.<eos> That's perception. Nobody's gonna see it that way.<eos> Sir, you admit to this, you bring down your presidency before it even begins.<eos> Deny it, and you start your presidency off with a lie.
What I did was a bold move.<eos> I admit it.<eos> And I believe it was the best one.<eos> If you can't see it that way here's my letter of resignation.<eos> You can accept it at any time if you so choose.
The girl's naked body had been covered.<eos> There were signs that she'd been violently held down.<eos> Mostly on her arms.<eos> Her throat had an extremely deep wound.<eos> It struck me because of how deep it was.
Agent Wells.<eos> How are you doing?<eos> Same as everyone else, I guess.<eos> I just came from Andrews.<eos> The bomb we just found, the UXO, it may not be telling you what you think it is.
Now, as press secretary, you can help change that perception.<eos> You want to parade me around as the president's "friendly Muslim"?<eos> If that's what it takes to start changing hearts and minds, yes. - Unbelievable.<eos> - Hey, this is Washington.<eos> You seize opportunity when it presents itself, whether you like the motives behind it or not.
- Of the interns. - Well, Mike of the interns, find yourself a nice suit, and I'll see you there.<eos> Bye.<eos> We are going to a party!<eos> Yes!<eos> Okay, because the photon cannon is powered by electromagnetism, it left a radiation signature on Supergirl's suit after the blast, so we might be able to put a tracking algorithm...
It's already melting at a rate that'll put Helsinki underwater in the next decade. Sir, we...<eos> We don't know what this is.<eos> A frozen wolf?<eos> We found a stone spearhead in the body.<eos> It dates to around 3000 BC.
He's gone.<eos> My lords. We've reached the Well of Stars.<eos> And?<eos> There is no sign of the Kryptonian pod.<eos> Find it.
There is no sign of the Kryptonian pod.<eos> Find it.<eos> The ion trail has dissipated.<eos> I would not know where to look.<eos> Find it.
Do you have his files?<eos> Is that why you're asking if I -- if I still want it?<eos> You -- There's nothing on there, or you didn't get time to download?<eos> I didn't say the mission was aborted,<eos> I said it was compromised.
- Hi.<eos> - Hello. And this is my friend, Raj.<eos> Oh, I'm not on the patent. I'm just here because there's a bumblebee in my office.<eos> I saw it.<eos> It's big.
That's half our Berlin office.<eos> Ja.<eos> Sadly, they'll have to go.<eos> Perhaps we could just change all their names to Smith.<eos> A snail might take off its shell, but it's still a snail.
Sorry! This is for authorized professionals only!<eos> - You need to leave now.<eos> - I was not expecting that kick. That gun is definitely defective though.<eos> I tell you that right now.<eos> It should be destroyed immediately.
Welcome to Budding Blossom.<eos> What can I get for you today?<eos> You know, I'm not exactly sure.<eos> Well, I just got this new Sativa strain in.<eos> It's called "Jack the Ripper."
Can I get a little help over here?<eos> ! Rog! Let me go!<eos> Tase him again!<eos> Man, his situation was, like, all up in your... Yes!<eos> Yes, it was.
No, they're not.<eos> Listen, we're almost there, okay?<eos> They went away.<eos> I can see the front door.<eos> It's so close.
We need to go public on this now.<eos> - I wouldn't do that!<eos> - I know you wouldn't do that. You wouldn't also bother to change your shirt every... I don't know... week, but neither of these things are decisions you're making.<eos> Most of the vets in Jackson's group therapy are dead.<eos> Now, that's either a big coincidence, or this thing's bigger than it seems.
Well, now, this is a lovely party. - Mm.<eos> - It's a splendid afternoon. - More tea?<eos> - No thanks.<eos> My cup is still full.<eos> No, it isn't.
Correction.<eos> He could make me do... just about anything.<eos> At first he made me feel special.<eos> Then... I can't remember most of it. Thankfully.<eos> Post-traumatic amnesia, it's called.
But of course you have our full support.<eos> Thank you both.<eos> But I wouldn't be doing my job if I didn't also warn you the entire legitimacy of your presidency depends on this.<eos> If the mission is a success, you're Reagan.<eos> If it fails, you're Carter, and Congress will hold you accountable.
But we haven't finished everything yet.<eos> The bombs aren't here.<eos> They are at the stadium.<eos> Who gave you that info?<eos> Are you sure it's correct?
The bombs aren't here.<eos> They are at the stadium.<eos> Who gave you that info?<eos> Are you sure it's correct?<eos> Yes, sir, it's correct.
He was very close to Goyang Stadium.<eos> So, I guess he wants to die.<eos> I'll go find him immediately.<eos> Commissioner, we got the phone number.<eos> - Well, dial it already.
You crazy fool.<eos> Why're you going around like a mad man?<eos> Where's your brother?<eos> Look at that lamp.<eos> Does it look a little weird?
You'll never shoot.<eos> Wanna make a bet?<eos> OK, let's bet... on your losing.<eos> The bomb's wired to my heart.<eos> It will explode as soon as it stops beating.
Uh, could I just talk to you in my office for a second about the report you just sent in?<eos> No, what's up?<eos> You can just...<eos> What do you need? I just sent the report. I know what's in there.<eos> Well, I wanna talk to you about the, uh, control gap, 'cause it's not in there and it... it should be.
I'm Niala Boodhoo, and my guest is Jacob Malco.<eos> He's the creator of three graphic novels.<eos> His newest, Obscurity, is just out.<eos> Jacob, when you look at what happened between your first book, Conjugality, being such a success, being made into a movie, following that up with Infidelity, and the actual infidelity that happened in your life, I wonder how you feel like that affected your work.<eos> Yeah, the love story of Conjugality was... was compelling and sweet, and it... and it was real.
I don't know...<eos> Yeah, it was honest, but, you know, I... [stutters] You know, was I being honest with myself?<eos> I think there's an argument to say no, because the second book, I ended up meeting somebody else so was that love real?<eos> Was that romance real? It was.<eos> Did it ultimately sustain?
[Cheryl] Yeah, great.<eos> [Kyle] Grab a drink across the street.<eos> [Sophie] So, yeah, uh, thanks for your message.<eos> Yeah, the... the show was great.<eos> It was really, really good, um, so... um, yeah, we're all heading out now, so, um, I probably won't catch you tonight, but, um... maybe we can talk tomorrow.
Give me a call back and we'll get into more details.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Bye. [Sophie] If I get the part, then...<eos> I... um, you know, I'll...<eos> I'll probably be moving to LA, uh, 'cause it shoots in LA.
I, uh... after everything that happened, which is a long story,<eos> I lost hope.<eos> And one day I found myself standing on a busy street corner and... feeling completely alone, and I just made a split-second choice.<eos> But I survived because, as it turns out, I'm not alone.<eos> And I've had a lot of time to think about that choice, and I know... it was the wrong one.
This is between seats on the right-hand side.<eos> You park the car in position. You flip the switch, start the timer, and you get the hell out of there.<eos> How long have I got?<eos> Plenty, as long as you head straight for the exit.<eos> Frank, push this one on this side of the car. If you don't, it'll go off immediately.
Hey, Doc.<eos> Detective Hynes.<eos> I wake you?<eos> Uh, no. Uh, yeah.<eos> I went by your office yesterday since that worked better the first time, but it was closed.
So, I got my insulated bucket... pointed the tip of the gun into the bucket, fired everything off...<eos> Lo and behold, liquid.<eos> Hey, survived the most dangerous thing I did today.<eos> So, what this says is that this whole gun is going to work.<eos> It's going to fire off a stream of liquid, it just has to be in a cold, cold place.
I think the terrorists are going to notice this assault.<eos> Which is why I shall now cause a diversion.<eos> I'm gonna make a smoking doughnut in front of the plane to distract the terrorists.<eos> Oh, no, this is a disaster.<eos> Even when you turn the traction control off, it isn't fully off, so you just get miles and miles of dreary understeer.
We can't. Just because that little winged-mouse bastard is hanging upside down in there, feeling smug with himself cos I'm up this ladder, we can't knock the house down?<eos> We've got to do it, no choice, so get up here and get on with it.<eos> Hammond, I hate... I hate heights. You know I do.<eos> Many hours later, and with no help at all from Spider-Man, the roof was finally off and the bat was free to move.<eos> But would it? Why doesn't it go and live in there?
Hammond, I hate... I hate heights. You know I do.<eos> Many hours later, and with no help at all from Spider-Man, the roof was finally off and the bat was free to move.<eos> But would it? Why doesn't it go and live in there?<eos> Because, let's be honest, that's perfect if you're a bat.<eos> Yeah, well, it might, but it's got to decide to do so.
- And you're not gonna show the lap?<eos> Nobody's interested in watching an American being sawn in half by a glorified Beetle.<eos> It did 1:20.4.<eos> Right, so, now let's see what the M4 did. Let's put the time up.<eos> There it is.
Did you make it yourself? -No, it came... -A little leather pouch.<eos> It came with the car, believe it or not.<eos> Oh, so Ferrari sold it to you.<eos> Was it £600? I bet it was.<eos> No, it just came with the car!
We've got a picture of the bridge. It's a substantial thing.<eos> You know this bridge? A famous bridge?<eos> -That's a squirrel bridge?<eos> -Yeah, it's a squirrel bridge.<eos> Anyway, how many squirrels do you think have used it?
In fact, all you need is a massive former Cold War airfield with enough tarmac to accommodate the board for your board game.<eos> With a big enough slab of airfield, you can then lay out your grid, onto which you can place your battleships.<eos> And all you need for that is several thousand pounds' worth of old cars.<eos> But not any old cars.<eos> This stretch limo, for example, may have seen active service on hundreds of hen nights, but it makes the perfect aircraft carrier.
Interesting.<eos> It's very, very old. But it folds completely in half so that, in the old days, the horses could go through.<eos> Now, that's the Houses of Parliament, which are a series of houses in which we keep all our idiots.<eos> That clock thing, that's Big Ben.<eos> I know it's not what you call big, but... but we couldn't just call it Ben.
Amidst all this loveliness, though, there was one small elephant edging its way into the room.<eos> Chaps, I don't want to have to say this, but is the tide coming in or going out?<eos> I'm guessing in.<eos> There's no way up the sides of that.<eos> And if the tide comes in that far, which it does, we've had it.
Improved our lot no end.<eos> So the situation is...<eos> Hammond has broken his car, you're stuck, and mine's overheated.<eos> Are we going to say, James, that your idea was stupid?<eos> It was stupid.
The alternator...<eos> - You've had to fit a wing on it, which ruins the looks.<eos> It's not in the spirit of the beach buggy, but of a man desperately trying to justify a terrible idea.<eos> - It was a brilliant idea!<eos> - It doesn't work!
There is a sound...<eos> We can now differentiate between the sound of military and civilian aircraft.<eos> Take shelter, hero!<eos> Where would I take shelter in this building?<eos> If a barrel bomb fell here, it would destroy the whole building!
- A trick of the light?<eos> - No, no!<eos> What I saw was alive.<eos> It had a human shape.<eos> Where did it go to?
- I only come for the music.<eos> - Can't you play at home?<eos> My parents don't like it.<eos> They're wrong.<eos> One day I saw a violin in school. I was drawn to it, like it was waiting for me.
Electricity cuts made me lose everything in the freezer.<eos> This is interesting.<eos> "In the storm, "the Ballmer family left Chambéry airport.<eos> "The plane disappeared off the radar at 8.52pm.<eos> "It sent out no distress signal, it never landed.

"It sent out no distress signal, it never landed.<eos> "It probably crashed in the mountains."<eos> Is this to do with your case?<eos> They searched further north.<eos> It was never found?
And sparkle, and sparkle, and spin, and spin, spank, spank, spank...<eos> And gallop, and gallop... that's right!<eos> [Kimmy] Keep galloping!<eos> I'm sorry I'm late, I'm ready, but I can't find my crown.<eos> That crazy lady has it.
Come on.<eos> One more time around the village.<eos> Why are we stopping here?<eos> To take in the view.<eos> There it is.
I've seen enough to know that it was a mistake to trust them with this.<eos> Yeah, it took you 35 years to give them a chance.<eos> Why not give up on 'em right away?<eos> Maggie, they were playing Star Wars with the sperm gun.<eos> Rooster was waving it around saying...
Hit Abby instead.<eos> Can I get a whiskey?<eos> How are you doin'?<eos> How'd your conversation with Ed go last night?<eos> I mean, it went fine, you know.
Are we done here?<eos> 'Cause I'm not signing this.<eos> Well, I'm sorry to hear that.<eos> Beau, I should say at this point that I think you need to find your own lawyer.<eos> I'm gonna head back to the ranch... while it's still mine to go back to.
She does.<eos> I remember that<eos> I couldn't control my body sometimes.<eos> There was just this voice.<eos> It kept asking me to come closer. And when I did...
No, that's okay.<eos> You don't have to say anything.<eos> I will find the answer.<eos> The truth is out there.<eos> Or is it in there?
What do you think was in that injector?<eos> My free will.<eos> I don't think so.<eos> That medicine wasn't meant for you.<eos> It's messing with your mind.
My free will.<eos> I don't think so.<eos> That medicine wasn't meant for you.<eos> It's messing with your mind.<eos> It's making you paranoid and afraid.
You have that comment for me, or you just miss me already?<eos> Can I talk to you privately? Yeah.<eos> So, I have a very uncomfortable, likely inappropriate favor to ask you.<eos> Okay. I need you to hold that story on Leo for as long as possible.<eos> 'Cause it's true?
The cast iron melting, the marble crumble.<eos> Whoever did this, we're talking about a conspiracy of unparalleled proportions.<eos> I was scared, Mr. President.<eos> Doctor, I'm gonna need you to give me every single name that had access to this file.<eos> I put an ORCON classification on this file, which means the number of people who saw it is limited.

General, this is file 12-80C, a threat assessment created by the Pentagon<eos> Mr. President, I have never seen this before.<eos> I find that highly unlikely.<eos> This file was given an ORCON classification.<eos> I can count on my hand the number of people that have seen it.
What I'm about to tell you has to stay in this room.<eos> - Do you understand?<eos> - Of course.<eos> Yesterday I received a highly classified DOD file detailing how to blow up the Capitol.<eos> I believe it's what Al-Sakar used to plan and carry out the attack.
- Thanks. - Mm-hmm.<eos> I'm Agent Wells.<eos> I called earlier about looking at your surveillance footage.<eos> Yes, of course.<eos> Uh, it's in the back.
What's wrong with that?<eos> And that's not even true.<eos> Look at the hostess' napkin.<eos> -Holy shit.<eos> -Check it out.
I'm gonna show you how it all goes down.<eos> Look at this.<eos> This is a piece of liver.<eos> The registration is right here.<eos> The registration needs to stay in contact with living cells, otherwise it turns off.
Do they want us to wait?<eos> Escape...?<eos> If the Process locked me up here, I'm happy to stay.<eos> So if the Process told you to eat shit, you would?<eos> If it smelled good and it came from the Offshore...
-Hi, honey.<eos> -Hi, babe.<eos> What's going on?<eos> I was watching your speech from here.<eos> It was great as always.
It's better this way.<eos> Did you interact with Agent César?<eos> Not much.<eos> So, you didn't know what he thought about your performance?<eos> That it was a little below the curve?
Just as Mr. Cole gets home.<eos> Plus the fact that, by appearances, the only other thing missing is his laptop.<eos> This bag is dusty, bleached by the sun, apart from this area here.<eos> Now, this bag comes with a removable laptop sleeve.<eos> It sits right there.
My very existence seems to embarrass him.<eos> You know, if it weren't for me, our friend Sherlock would still think that the Sun revolves around the Earth.<eos> I was eight when I made that mistake.<eos> You chose to wear that vest this morning.<eos> It was a gift from a fan.
An asteroid 20 miles wide is hurtling towards us as we speak.<eos> You made your point last night, okay?<eos> We would both continue doing our jobs to the very end.<eos> The work we do is important.<eos> I think I could have done a better job explaining why it's important.

By the time the young noddies leave, they carry these hitchhiking seeds away to other islands.<eos> But sometimes the pisonia trees are too successful.<eos> If a fledgling, testing out its wings, drops to the ground, it can get covered with the seeds.<eos> Entangled and weighed down, if it can't free itself, the youngster will starve.<eos> The pisonia may have failed to disperse these seeds... ..but it will soon have fertiliser for its roots.
What's that coming out of her snatch?<eos> The Legions of Hell...<eos> Is that anatomically correct?<eos> I mean, assumed they'd be coming out of her arsehole.<eos> Should have put a ring on it!
Not quite.<eos> Well, I, for one, am really glad you're here.<eos> You know, it's not getting any easier.<eos> You know, time's not helping.<eos> Why would it?
Why would it?<eos> 'Cause everybody says that it does.<eos> People who say that don't understand.<eos> Time is cruel.<eos> It punishes.
I've waited 18 years to have a little us time.<eos> And I love our baby girl, but I am not waiting 18 more.<eos> Time to dream big, go big, and-and get out of our comfort zone a little.<eos> Here's the thing about our comfort zone:<eos> it's very comfortable. Stop.

And the border on the Danube had always been a problem. And, in fact, as it turns out, always would be a problem.<eos> The Roman army was the most formidable fighting machine that the ancient world had seen.<eos> The basis for their success was less their capacity for killing,<eos> and more their capacity for entrenchment.<eos> It was a capacity for digging fortresses, for fashioning all the infrastructure of a frontier force that served to ensure that the Roman frontiers were essentially guarded and held secure.
You ain't gettin' on this goddamn bus without it.<eos> You white people run this country. You don't run this bus, unfortunately for you.<eos> I know you think you do, but you don't." I'm like, "Sir, it's here."<eos> "You little cracker, I know what you're doin'. I recognize you."<eos> "Sir, it's here." "You goddamn devil. Get in the back of the bus."
Could have had their own stationery. Would've made a lot of money.<eos> The car thieves would read it. They'd be like,<eos> "Come on, man. It says 'no radio.' Can't you read?<eos> Let's go"<eos> The city was a hellhole, but it seemed more authentic.
I don't understand.<eos> Were you asking him to assign the case to someone in the squad?<eos> No, I just asked him to fast-track the .38 for fingerprint analysis.<eos> He made a call and, boom.<eos> Lab said they'd have it tomorrow.
Yeah, he's an FBI agent.<eos> Do you know him?<eos> As a matter of fact, we do.<eos> Didn't you get my message?<eos> I got it.
She drove a truck into a prison in broad daylight on Easter.<eos> So I'm saying points for brute force, maybe not finesse.<eos> All right, for my first contender, I'm working on an escape that is truly one of a kind.<eos> A hand-made craft built from scavenged parts... and an epic breakout... not from a prison, but from an entire country.<eos> It takes place in 1979, in an area under Communist control.
The science is still in its infancy.<eos> Eventually, we believe he may develop a greater connection to mankind.<eos> No way.<eos> This cannot be true.<eos> Look, I knew you wouldn't believe me, I wouldn't either, so I contacted Brian Ford, the researcher that discovered the story when it was recently declassified.
How did he do it?<eos> Here to help me figure it out, animal psychologist Dr. Aaron Blaisdell.<eos> Tell me, was Skinner completely crazy, or was he onto something?<eos> A little bit of both.<eos> He was crazy in the sense that the idea was to put a pigeon into a missile so that it can guide it to a ship and blow it up.
I'd like you to construct a new weapon.<eos> -Yes, general.<eos> -A catapult.<eos> -Yes, sir.<eos> -Then climb in it and launch yourself at that enormous Nazi concrete wall.
First of all, if the wind shifts you get drift.<eos> -One.<eos> -Secondly, it's such a slow descent, it gives your enemy ample time to just shoot your cargo out of the sky.<eos> So, the British came up with the idea that they would just strap rockets onto the cargo.<eos> That way it drops at terminal velocity and, at the last minute, ignites the rockets giving it a nice soft landing.
The once proud French nation is under Nazi occupation.<eos> Only the brave fighters of the Resistance continue the struggle.<eos> These fearless saboteurs are planning a daring strike to destroy the morale of Nazi occupiers.<eos> With the help of a secret weapon invented by American intelligence.<eos> -Do you have it? -Yes, I have it.
Parfait.<eos> I can't wait to use it on those Nazi bastards.<eos> Good luck.<eos> Using this weapon demanded immense courage.<eos> It could only be activated at close quarters.
One.<eos> I've done my tests.<eos> Now, I'm going full size, for real.<eos> The first thing I need to do is build a platform.<eos> It's gonna be 8-by-8 and extremely sturdy.
I've done my tests.<eos> Now, I'm going full size, for real.<eos> The first thing I need to do is build a platform.<eos> It's gonna be 8-by-8 and extremely sturdy.<eos> It also has to be very, very precise, because we realize that stability is an issue and the rockets have to be perfectly centered right in the middle.
With the first sled in place and the bungees looped and tied, it's time for a quick systems check.<eos> Okay, let me walk you through our whole setup here.<eos> Starting off with the winch.<eos> The winch is used to tension up the bungee cords.<eos> It's gonna be removed once we click into the quick release.
It's too late to bail out now.<eos> Now, while Tory is preparing himself on the bobsled track, I need to prepare myself here at Galaxyland.<eos> And that preparation consists of setting up my g-force measuring vest.<eos> Yeah. Oh!<eos> Like any piece of precision measuring equipment... it needs to be calibrated.
and things that go beep.<eos> It's high on my list of things that I love to hate.<eos> As usual, we'll rank our six contenders by testing them against three criteria.<eos> Number one, how long has the tech been annoying?<eos> Number two, how annoying is it versus how useful it might be?
And it can either move it, it can flip it, it can stop it.<eos> Or, if you like, bring it in for a gentle landing... before you stomp on it.<eos> So, you just, like, fully took down my drone.<eos> Skyjacking a drone is cool, but it doesn't give me that ultimate satisfaction... of just knocking a drone out of the sky.<eos> This British bazooka looks like it could take down the Death Star, but its job is to capture drones mid-flight.
Give me directions to a taco shop.<eos> -A taco is a snack food of Mexican origin.<eos> -No, not the definition of a taco.<eos> I know I should give voice recognition some slack.<eos> I mean, it has to push through the uhs and ums, and all the accents, and all those same-sounding words with totally different definitions.
Don't wait, call now!<eos> All right, there is a lot to be annoyed by traffic lights.<eos> Okay, let's break it down, so we can score it.<eos> One, how long have they been annoying?<eos> The first light was installed 150 years ago in London, and it was gas-powered.
Okay, let's break it down, so we can score it.<eos> One, how long have they been annoying?<eos> The first light was installed 150 years ago in London, and it was gas-powered.<eos> I mean, how annoying could it be if there was only one?<eos> Well, a month later it exploded, injuring the policemen operating it.
So, traffic lights could get less annoying in the future.<eos> But my final contender is set to get much worse.<eos> Hi. My name's Jim.<eos> My addiction took me to the gutter.<eos> It cost me my job.
Oh, perfect, I thought I was the only one that wasn't a doctor.<eos> Now, we have some tissue here.<eos> What is the tissue from?<eos> This is swine skin.<eos> And we use swine skin 'cause it's very much structurally the same as human skin, so we can predict what might happen in human skin.
If you have this much pressure in your intestine<eos> She can't take much more, captain!<eos> You're already dead.<eos> You win.<eos> This technology feels like it's stepped out of Star Trek.
Check out this guy.<eos> Neil Harbisson was born with extreme color blindness.<eos> So, he got doctors to implant an antenna in his brain.<eos> My antenna is a body part, and it allows me to hear colors.<eos> It sends the light frequencies to a chip at the back of my head, and then the chip transposes the colors into sound waves.
There's only one real way to find out.<eos> I gotta build this sucker and test it.<eos> So, we have little drive shafts.<eos> I'm enlisting some help from builder Jon Marcu.<eos> We have to create a device that basically scrolls paper from one side to the other, which is the map and it has to correlate with the speed of the car, so that the map moves as the car moves.
That is highly inefficient.<eos> Sorry.<eos> I'm starting to think this is why I could only find a couple references to the Iter Auto.<eos> My map's out again.<eos> I reckon it went out of business.
With four contenders duking it out for top spot, here's a fifth to add to the mix.<eos> This time, the focus is on me.<eos> This invention has taken the world by storm in just the last couple of years.<eos> You'll see it at any tourist landmark.<eos> It sells by the millions, but it's banned at Apple conferences,
You'll see it at any tourist landmark.<eos> It sells by the millions, but it's banned at Apple conferences,<eos> Disney parks and Wimbledon.<eos> Why?<eos> Because it's incredibly annoying.
And it was huge.<eos> No, literally.<eos> Physically gigantic.<eos> A series of control cables connected the keyboards to what Cahill called his music plant.<eos> It consisted of miles of cable, generators, banks of spinning rotors, alternators, transformers and switchboards.
No, literally.<eos> Physically gigantic.<eos> A series of control cables connected the keyboards to what Cahill called his music plant.<eos> It consisted of miles of cable, generators, banks of spinning rotors, alternators, transformers and switchboards.<eos> All told, it was 60 feet long, weighed almost 200 tons and it took up the entire basement floor of its building on Broadway.
There were also some technical issues.<eos> Customers would get crosstalk from a conversation on another line.<eos> Remember, this was a telephone-based delivery system.<eos> Ultimately, Cahill's invention was a victim of its time.<eos> It was doomed from the start by its enormous size and cost.
Trying to read a paper map on these streets?<eos> Please.<eos> Look at that... all of Los Angeles.<eos> This is ridiculous.<eos> This kind of traffic is supposed to be ideal for the crowdsourced app because it can adapt to conditions.
This kind of traffic is supposed to be ideal for the crowdsourced app because it can adapt to conditions.<eos> In 300 feet, turn right.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Why are you going this way?<eos> But it has its flaws.
In the war... you don't know what could happen.<eos> If it was suicide in Netanya... how many rockets have been landed... in Bethlehem, Ramallah, Nablus, Jenin, Gaza?<eos> How many thousands of children, women, old people, have been killed from this rocket?<eos> One ton, each one.<eos> They threw it at civilian people.
- [door opens and closes] - Father Ibrahim... opened it and let us in, offered us protection.<eos> He closed the door and said, "Don't be afraid.<eos> The most important thing for them was to find somewhere safe.<eos> The church was always the safest place during these times.<eos> Over the ages, it has always been the safest place.
And I mean, the bed was, like...<eos> I was just a few feet away.<eos> I could easily have just turned and... grabbed that gun.<eos> I don't really know how to use a gun.<eos> I don't know if it's loaded or not.
Maybe we should try it." And, "No, no, no."<eos> And then we just decided to try it.<eos> And actually, unbelievably, it works.<eos> It's a very simple mechanism.<eos> There's just a little spring and if you lift it, it'll just release, like magic.
- You're looking good.<eos> Very good. - Yes!<eos> Thank you.<eos> Art is material.<eos> It is wed intractably to the real world, bound by matter and matters.

I've come here as one who understands your worth.<eos> I've come to offer you wealth, power and pussy like you have never known.<eos> Um... whatever pussy you might be hiding under there, I can tell you we've no interest.<eos> You and I could own this city.<eos> If I was interested, it'd already be mine.
- Where is the bridge?<eos> Who is ready for pie?<eos> Voila.<eos> - Where is that contact lens?<eos> Ah, here it is.
Toby, Aaarrrgghh, you protect the Trollhunter.<eos> You are despicable.<eos> What are you gonna do?<eos> By my six eyes, I will find the bridge if it kills me.<eos> And you are going to tell me where it is.
Hold on, sweetie. You're gonna be okay.<eos> You're gonna be fine, I promise.<eos> Jim, hold on.<eos> Great Gronka Morka, the changeling was right!<eos> The bridge is complete, and it was here the whole time!
- Your life more important.<eos> Not pet.<eos> Wingman.<eos> Ditto, buddy.<eos> Now, let's go take care of that bridge and make sure it never opens again.
Such as Gunmar's Birthstone.<eos> - Why is it so powerful?<eos> Long ago, trolls lived underground, blissfully unaware of humankind above.<eos> Inevitably, our worlds collided.<eos> Trolls and humans each wanted the world as their own and fought for it.
- Oh, no!<eos> - Give me the ring!<eos> My soul...<eos> No.<eos> It's...
- Give me the ring!<eos> My soul...<eos> No.<eos> It's...<eos> It's gone.
Sword.<eos> Gunmar wants to deliver a message to Jim.<eos> That's why he's alive.<eos> That's how he escaped!<eos> Then I hope it's a short message because we don't have all day.
Just keep goin'?<eos> World domination, keep going to the moon.<eos> In 2007 Biderman became CEO and found himself in the middle of a media storm.<eos> I'm not necessarily encouraging infidelity<eos> I don't think it needs that much encouragement.
The Dumpster.<eos> The Dumpster.<eos> Go.<eos> Go.<eos> Hold it.
Take care of him.<eos> We should leave!<eos> We save as many of our people as we can!<eos> It's the loneliness.<eos> It makes us weak.
Like a real bomb?<eos> No.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> It's not dangerous.<eos> As long as these two aren't connected, it can't go off.

How's the pizza?<eos> - Not good.<eos> - No?<eos> No.<eos> You got to try it with the nuggets. It's a little better.
If we let go of it, we'll never find our way back.<eos> It worked!<eos> Once we've done that... we send the drone in to get eyes on Maddy.<eos> Keep it steady, now.<eos> Keep it steady.

- No.<eos> - How do you normally get down?<eos> - You can't. You're stuck.<eos> Wow, I can't believe you ate that cotton candy.<eos> And you know what's scary is it actually tasted kind of fine.
No, no, no. I need my typewriter.<eos> - Every story I've written... was on that Smith Corona.<eos> It's not just me.<eos> That typewriter is special.<eos> It has a soul of its own.
It's all just numbers.<eos> Computer codes being transferred electronically through the air.<eos> Right in front of us.<eos> The French poet, Paul Valery, was right when he said,<eos> "the future isn't what it used to be."
I spent the next 10 minutes kicking myself.<eos> "the next 10 minutes kicking myself."<eos> "What are the chances "I'd ever see this woman again?"<eos> "Fortunately, she left her magazine on the seat."<eos> I think you know who it was addressed to.
You and I are two of the angriest people I know.<eos> Oh, I was always taught to deny mine, which I did and still do.<eos> And that makes me envy you.<eos> Mm-hmm.<eos> See, your anger is still right up here on the surface, where you can look it in the face.
And that makes me envy you.<eos> Mm-hmm.<eos> See, your anger is still right up here on the surface, where you can look it in the face.<eos> Make friends with it, honey.<eos> Channel it for your own design.
There was a time I knew everything in the sky.<eos> Every satellite... every constellation... souvenirs of space walks and astronauts... and rockets launched by NASA in the '60s.<eos> As a kid, I looked up and felt the future.<eos> It belonged to me.
Not every noe lani is a puka lani.<eos> - Not every gentle mist is a gate to heaven.<eos> What is the future?<eos> The future isn't just something that happens.<eos> It's a brutal force with a great sense of humor... that'll steamroll you if you're not watching.
World went and got an upgrade since you died, Cage.<eos> Onboard drones, anti-air countermeasures, and fuel tanks big enough to circumnavigate the globe three times without ever landing.<eos> You can check your coat.<eos> I promise you, no one would dare steal it.<eos> I can't guarantee it won't walk off on its own.
Thanks for the assist.<eos> X takes care of its own.<eos> You got to be kidding.<eos> We failed.<eos> Xander, Marke activated the satellite and it's headed right for us.
It was you who lost the boy, and the sword.<eos> Have I not sacrificed enough?<eos> And have you not felt your power increase?<eos> With every kingdom conquered, with every level added to your tower.<eos> When it is capped with the silver from Gaul, you will have what you wanted.
One of the many would be conquerors of the universe who seeks to steal the secrets of the mana stone.<eos> The way your race has used technology to unleash its power is impressive.<eos> What do you know of the mana stone?<eos> What do I know?<eos> I know it did not originate on your planet.
The way your race has used technology to unleash its power is impressive.<eos> What do you know of the mana stone?<eos> What do I know?<eos> I know it did not originate on your planet.<eos> I know it was stolen in battle centuries ago!
Luckily, I knew a little magic of my own.<eos> But there was still one problem.<eos> Smurfette's name doesn't tell us anything about her.<eos> Okay, the physics are...<eos> It doesn't tell us who she is.
You're just in time to witness scientific history.<eos> What's going on in here?<eos> None of your business, Nosey.<eos> Well, all right.<eos> If that vegetable hat can tell us that Hefty is strong, maybe it can tell me what an Ette is.
How did you know he would?<eos> It's a conversation starter.<eos> - What did you tell him?<eos> - The truth.<eos> That it was a family heirloom.
Already on it.<eos> - But, Simon?<eos> - Yes, darling.<eos> I might have been wrong about the beard.<eos> It makes you a little, dare I say... Older.
- Always.<eos> You know me.<eos> Focus, darling.<eos> Our mission is to get the bank info from the valecross safe.<eos> It's in the Manchester suite.
The lieutenant is not giving you leave, son.<eos> You're going home, private.<eos> Sergeant major, there is no reason to be concerned about...<eos> Your war is over.<eos> No, it isn't over.
Outreach programmes to inspire children in school to think outside the box.<eos> To inspire in them a belief that...<eos> Yes, they can.<eos> There was a time when this port served thousands of ships around the globe.<eos> Now it can rise again.
That's it!<eos> There it is!<eos> That's the tree!<eos> I'm sure of it.<eos> It was downed by lightning at the time.
And then?<eos> Forgiveness does not establish a relationship.<eos> It's just relieving the lump in the throat.<eos> Mack, the pain inside you is devouring you.<eos> It is stealing your joy. And deforming their ability to love.
Taft?<eos> Raymond.<eos> How's the novel coming?<eos> Ah, it's... it's difficult.<eos> My publisher says it has to be 120 pages, minimum.
Have you accessed their memory banks?<eos> - Like the ship, Lulu's memory has been wiped clean.<eos> Since we're gonna be here for a while can we not do something about these fucking weeds?<eos> - I recommend transferring O'Neill to the recreation room.<eos> There is only one way in or out of the room, but it is a larger space and doesn't feel like he's in prison.
Things you never really supposed to have.<eos> Glen Crest put a proprietary code... At the DNA of every GC human.<eos> A fingerprint.<eos> It was supposed to be inert, a tracking code.<eos> And it is causing irreversible neurological problems.
What the fuck!<eos> Get your God damn foot off my car!<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> The foot's coming off right now.<eos> But before it comes off, let me just explain myself here.
So you take all the glory, thanks...<eos> - OK!<eos> - ...thanks all the same.<eos> Look, just solve the bloody thing, will you?<eos> It's driving me nuts.
Goodbye, Sherlock Holmes.<eos> You're out of time.<eos> - Tell me about your boss, Moriarty.<eos> - Who? I know it's him.<eos> It must be him.
I thought I was the only one, I thought I was the only one who got out.<eos> Where is he?<eos> I need to see him, now!<eos> Before you gave it to John, did you keep your memory stick safe?<eos> Yeah, of course. It was our insurance.
Everybody, keep your wigs on now!<eos> What?<eos> I didn't believe it when they said you were coming.<eos> I was up all night just thinking about how me and Gunpei dreamed of this moment.<eos> And now here it is.
Mean as hell.<eos> Now, he can handle them as long as he gets to them when they're still small.<eos> (ROARS)<eos> You don't wanna wake up the big one.<eos> - How big is it?
(ROARS)<eos> You don't wanna wake up the big one.<eos> - How big is it?<eos> - It's bigger.<eos> It wiped out his whole family.
Some of them advertise.<eos> Do they really?<eos> Serial killing is an expression of power, ego.<eos> A signature in human destruction.<eos> Ultimately, for full satisfaction, it requires plain sight.
- Soldiers.<eos> Tick-tock. Tickets, please.<eos> Hey, sis, don't mean to complain, but this one's empty.<eos> What happened? Did you run out of ideas?<eos> It's not empty, Sherlock.
We are the competition!<eos> This is war.<eos> Puppies are winning, and babies are losing.<eos> Thank you, Teddy.<eos> And if this new puppy is as cute as we fear... it could put the baby business out of business, baby.
We hired them and they steal from us.<eos> It is heresy of the highest order.<eos> All command modules... fire with the intent to kill.<eos> What's the nearest habitable planet?<eos> It's called Berhert.
Are you gonna keep going out of turn? Yes.<eos> Can I stay on Earth?<eos> I can't answer that.<eos> Why rain?<eos> Because it washes everything clean.
I was visualizing new and better ways of doing business.<eos> While my sister was CEO...<eos> What was the name of that lake?<eos> Moose Lake.<eos> Moose Lake. While my sister was CEO, dumping so much toxic waste into Moose Lake that it exploded...
anything's possible.<eos> What doesn't make sense... is there are no monasteries anywhere near where contact with the plane was lost.<eos> And Order of the Crane Mother... doesn't exist.<eos> Unless Kyle is an idiot who doesn't know how to do simple research.<eos> there's no mention of it anywhere. back from the dead.
Of course.<eos> Why did you wait this long?<eos> To come back, I mean.<eos> The way was closed.<eos> I had to wait for it to open again.
I am Madame Gao.<eos> Do you remember the katsura tree in the center of K'un-Lun Square?<eos> You've been to K'un-Lun.<eos> Its shade stretches on for miles.<eos> it smells like brown sugar.
He used to hide it in these big clay pots, have it ferment in the bell tower over the winter.<eos> Me and my friend Davos, when we were kids, we'd... we'd wait until the brothers had gone to sleep and we'd climb up the tower.<eos> We'd, uh... we'd sneak drinks and refill the pots with water so no one knew it was missing.<eos> The wine was so sweet.<eos> In the dead of winter, it tasted warm... like summer.
I liked it, too.<eos> You know, this cloak of... I don't know, bravado that you have...<eos> I know why you wear it.<eos> I do the same thing.<eos> It keeps people at bay, but... you know that you don't have to wear it with me.
Don't expect anyone here to be listening to a kid who got his MBA from a Himalayan monastery.<eos> Lawrence, you don't have to attack him.<eos> - Danny's plan is...<eos> - The idiotic dream of a child.<eos> Karen Page at The Bulletin seemed to like it.
Claire, too.<eos> I can handle myself.<eos> What about Radovan?<eos> I know where he is.<eos> Now I think I have a plan, but it's dangerous.
Her power is far-reaching.<eos> We can't take any chances.<eos> Good pace, guys.<eos> This place... it seems familiar.<eos> It should.
You're right.<eos> There's no room here.<eos> These blueprints show the exact layout of this entire building, and according to this, there should be a room right here.<eos> Why would a room be walled off?<eos> Because it's a secret room.
That was close.<eos> Well, it has to be something important.<eos> Otherwise it wouldn't have been hidden away like that.<eos> And this note.<eos> What does it mean?
- I'll put you in danger.<eos> - I'm done explaining this.<eos> What are you doing? Whoa! She is very strong.<eos> Sir, this is for your protection. We need this place to look closed.<eos> It is closed!
Believe me, this will drown you.<eos> What do you want with our city?<eos> Your city?<eos> This place belongs to the Hand.<eos> It always has.
- Come on, we should go.<eos> - Just give me a second here.<eos> - You hear that?<eos> - Mmm-hmm.<eos> The hammer's ruffling something before it hits the string here. Here.
You can't get into my head anymore.<eos> Now tell me... what are your plans with New York?<eos> Its time has come... to fall.<eos> The elevator.<eos> It's descending.
Nice, Now refining your location,<eos> There were discovered basement,<eos> There are locations that cause awkwardness.<eos> During 24 hours... Closer, Anybody see the man who disappeared behind a rock slide,<eos> And it is not visible,
Do not destroy my plan!<eos> No! It's my big idea!<eos> You're wrong again, Hoges,<eos> Those who create themselves,<eos> And signal the attack in Moscow has stopped as it has already begun.
Look at that smile<eos> I love it when you smile<eos> Make me happy<eos> I think this place makes you happy<eos> It's like it speaks to you
And Delaney's will leaves him everything.<eos> Including Nootka.<eos> Do we have a copy of the Nootka Sound treaty yet?<eos> Where perhaps our lawyers could pick it apart?<eos> It's yet to surface, Sir Stuart. And...
Oi! Get it loaded!<eos> How is your religion these days, Coop?<eos> My what?<eos> Your religion, your faith.<eos> After many years in your service, it is in rags and tatters, Your Highness.
As your father's clothes when he would go dancing on the foreshore and light his fires.<eos> Brace, where did my father keep his most important things?<eos> What is it you're looking for?<eos> The Nootka Sound treaty.<eos> It may be written on deerskin.
Explain to me why you crossed a river to watch me get shot.<eos> It was shallow and I needed a better view.<eos> Your turn.<eos> The saltpetre we stole had already been sold to the Royal Navy.<eos> So it belonged to the Crown.
Now I know the secret in her head.<eos> And it makes me so hard... and so angry.<eos> And she likes it.<eos> Since you came back, our fucking has become almost murderous.<eos> It exhausts us.
What time is it?<eos> It's me, boss.<eos> Sorry to wake you.<eos> We have a problem.<eos> That Rolling Stone article came out, and it's not good.
And so Glen finally got his face time with the president.<eos> Getting fired probably wasn't the kind of face time he was after, but, well, I guess you could say it was kind of a page in the history books.<eos> That was pretty exciting for me.<eos> But, sadly, while I would've liked to have thought that my story had made a difference, it didn't.<eos> It just became another celebrity-fall-from-grace story.
Just dump him somewhere while you were out.<eos> That's why I needed the car.<eos> Well, let's just get started.<eos> Look at the moon.<eos> It's so pretty how it reflects on the water.
Stiles.<eos> Your son.<eos> Uh-huh.<eos> And maybe it's just a random signal cross?<eos> Peter gave us the keys to the Jeep and it started right up.
The lightning strikes the rod, which sends the bolt down into the tunnel.<eos> We grab the Ghost Rider push him into the bunker, and we trap him there.<eos> Okay.<eos> How do you keep him from riding the lightning back out of the tunnels before you get him into the trap?<eos> Well, if the lightning strikes again, it'll just hit our rod.
I really hope it's not up there.<eos> Let's split up.<eos> Hey, look at this.<eos> The rift's not above us.<eos> It's below.
It pretty much rolls off the tongue.<eos> But, uh, the closest he could get was "mischief."<eos> His mother called him that until...<eos> I remember when, uh... When Stiles first got his Jeep.<eos> It belonged to his mother.
It may not be better. But at least it's not him.<eos> Noah.<eos> Come out of there.<eos> Did you know about this room?<eos> Why was it sealed off?
This was a bad idea.<eos> It's not a bad idea.<eos> It is a terrible idea.<eos> I told you where the transformer is.<eos> I told you how it works.
Your father is a ruthless con man who always has a devious plan to hurt everyone around him.<eos> What happens when he gets up out of that bed?<eos> You got a plan of your own?<eos> I have a plan.<eos> I don't know if it's devious.
She's old. She's up there.<eos> How was her body?<eos> What did that look like?<eos> I mean, it was tight.<eos> - It was tight?
Take a lesson from Johnnie Larch.<eos> I don't know Johnnie Larch.<eos> Johnnie Larch got out after five years. He gets to the airport, hands his ticket to the woman at the counter, who asks for his driver's license.<eos> He gives it to her.<eos> She says, "It's expired." He says, "It might not be a valid drivers license", "but it is a damn fine identification.
On my festival days, they still feast on eggs and rabbit and candy and they do it in my name.<eos> Serious question, my dear.<eos> I have no doubt that millions upon millions exchange tokens and observe the rituals of your festival, all down to the hunting of the hidden eggs, but does anybody pray in your name?<eos> Do they say it in worship?<eos> They mouth your name, but they have no idea what it means.
It was raining.<eos> You hear the rain?<eos> You hear it?<eos> Find it.<eos> Tell me when you've found it.
It's not a mic.<eos> With this I lodge a tiny tracker under his skin.<eos> It's like a mosquito bite.<eos> Here.<eos> It'll lead us to the hostages.
- That's correct.<eos> Where do those wavelengths go?<eos> My point is, a new plane of existence is out there.<eos> Yes, that is no longer in dispute. But you can't tell us what that is exactly.<eos> When you see a train leave the station... do you need to know where it's going to understand that you saw it leave?
Three months ago, I had a patient, really young, found out that she had brain cancer.<eos> Very sad.<eos> She reacted to that diagnosis as though I'd handed her a fucking winning lottery ticket.<eos> It wasn't because she hoped that maybe she was going someplace better. It was because the Discovery made her think that it was guaranteed.<eos> Well, yeah. Death used to be something we just had to live with, and now it's a convenient way to escape pain. That's okay.
I'm sitting in this old Hollywood, dark wood, red leather seat restaurant, and I'm in between my attorney and Milton Berle, and Milton Berle unzips his pants and whips his dick out.<eos> Just whips it right out in the restaurant right in front of me.<eos> And I'm trying to maintain eye contact, but it's very difficult.<eos> I kept looking down at it.<eos> He never tried anything, didn't try to touch me, didn't play with it, he just whipped it out and let it hang the whole dinner... the whole lunch.
He said, "Pops, you don't have to do that no more."<eos> He said, "'Cause you are what you are", "and I am what I am, "and no matter whatever comes out in the wash, we're beautiful."<eos> That's my boy telling me.<eos> I'm not saying I want to exit porn.<eos> I love porn for what it is and how it can develop.
You're just rosebudding it."<eos> I'm like, "What is rosebudding it?"<eos> And they're like, "Well, it's when you have a prolapse",<eos> "you know, like, your ass, like, prolapsed.<eos> "It flips inside out." Right?
They would never hire you again on set if they found out you were escorting.<eos> You're supposed to be untouchable when you're doing film.<eos> And so that means not everybody can get to you to shoot you or... not everybody could get to you to have sex with you.<eos> Otherwise, why would you buy the video?<eos> The video has to be the only place they can get it or it won't sell.
I'll clean it up. I have to go.<eos> Tony's waiting.<eos> Your helmet, please.<eos> Love the helmet.<eos> It's adorable.
I mean, no.<eos> Have you ever heard of the male gaze?<eos> The...? No.<eos> Well, we have.<eos> And we're not totally sure what it means, but you have it.
I mean, I know people talk.<eos> Relationships start.<eos> They end.<eos> I guess I always thought, "How much does high school stuff really matter?"<eos> But... I mean, it does. But, you know, it...
Though of course it was written by Paul Desmond, but whatever.<eos> If they want a spirit-raiser, how about "Gloomy Sunday"?<eos> Are you serious?<eos> That song's totally depressing.<eos> Or it's beautiful, if you have taste.
If we'd known she needed help before...<eos> All right, young people.<eos> Let the learning commence.<eos> We've got a film today, continuing on our World War II unit.<eos> It's full of facts, even though technically it's fiction.
There you go.<eos> Thanks.<eos> What am I supposed to be seeing?<eos> Just a shadow over the moon.<eos> Look, it's growing slowly.
A car for the night, with a driver?<eos> We're talking probably $500, probably more.<eos> - Why don't you take the Jeep?<eos> - The Jeep is a hundred years old.<eos> The Jeep's not a hundred years old. It's not even paid off yet.
Go away. -Hannah!<eos> Mom, he's not a customer.<eos> Oh. Oh, I see.<eos> I'm gonna go get my coat.<eos> It's in the back, so...
She's gonna die either way.<eos> When the Saviors come and find their buddies dead, if they know their elbow from their asshole and can follow an obvious spoor, they're gonna go to the weapons cache and then to the cabin, and they're gonna attack this woman. What's her name?<eos> Maybe they kill her, maybe they don't, but it's gonna show Ezekiel what he needs to do.<eos> Her name.<eos> What is it?
I, uh... I'm not a farmer.<eos> I need some help here.<eos> No, you don't.<eos> I saw a wild blueberry bush growing outside.<eos> If it's young enough, I'm gonna pull it up and replant it here.
Your favorite.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You still up?<eos> Emma, what is it?<eos> Dad's accident... where did it happen?
I haven't done this before.<eos> May, get in here!<eos> She's on, she's on.<eos> So how are you dealing with all of this? I decided to treat cancer like a contact sport.<eos> If I keep moving, it can't get me.
So today I found out, as I'm sure you may already know, Carley passed away.<eos> She was 19. Nineteen years old. And she spent the better part<eos> - The fact she was. - Able to stay positive. And upbeat and inspire people through all of it.<eos> Absolutely.<eos> She was the example for all of us and she was determined not to let cancer win and even though she succumbed to it, it didn't win.
That means you guard my body.<eos> Is that not right?<eos> Not when you're robbing a bank.<eos> At the moment, my body is going to the bank.<eos> It's not robbing it.
Crystal, I spoke to Tammy not half an hour ago.<eos> My decision stands.<eos> Denise has caused enough trouble here.<eos> Matt, are you aware of the term optics?<eos> I know, I know, people and PR use it way too much, but it does matter.
Now come on.<eos> My guys found something that's going to help us out.<eos> Are we going somewhere?<eos> The 77 line is my new temporary housing.<eos> Runs 24 hours, and it's never empty.
I think those words are outweighed by what he did for this town.<eos> He put this great city on the map.<eos> To take his name off of a building is to betray San Vicente.<eos> And I would rather die than to betray my city like that.<eos> Leave the name the way it is, the way it should be.
- than before the fire. - I'm not...<eos> I think it's fair.<eos> I'm not taking your money. Put it towards a new truck.<eos> My truck... My truck fits me.<eos> It barely runs.
Here we are, sir.<eos> Wine list and menu.<eos> Both Boss Hogs. Thanks.<eos> Kaplan couldn't fucking believe it, but the judge sustained it.<eos> He says if the dog is in the will, it has standing to contest.
Single plantation Kenyan.<eos> Sure.<eos> Nice to see something else from Africa in this building.<eos> Try the chair.<eos> It's engineered to stimulate thought and creativity.
You enlist or you get shot.<eos> At least it wasn't the anarchists.<eos> They killed all the friars from the monastery.<eos> Master Lluís, don't take this badly, but I don't care who wins the war.<eos> I just want it to end.
And thanks to you, that sod is now my husband.<eos> You should show me some respect. Now I really am the Carlana.<eos> Get out.<eos> Welcome, everyone. We thought we wouldn't be able to celebrate this year, but thanks to the generosity of the Lady of the Manor, we can honour our patron saint the Virgin of Olivel.<eos> The war has brought hunger, fear and hate, but it will never destroy our faith in the Holy Virgin of our village.
Anytime.<eos> Carrie.<eos> Hey.<eos> How was your day?<eos> Well, it started with someone throwing a coffee mug at me.
But I do not see God.<eos> He was there, within us all.<eos> Praise Him.<eos> Word of the victory is being spread throughout the land.<eos> People will hear that it was God-given.
I expect you to keep everything gleamingly clean.<eos> "Gleamingly"?<eos> Clean.<eos> The stove is a bit like a servant.<eos> You have to whack it sometimes to get it to work.
But then I did this piece, a street fashion, kids on the street thing.<eos> I'm surprised you asked for me.<eos> Some people are being moved around and off the team.<eos> The Masterson story.<eos> "War, what is it good for?"
If they show up, you tell them everything you know about how to find me, you understand?<eos> Vince is a dangerous man, but he's not crazy.<eos> As long as you don't get in his way, he's got no reason to hurt you or your family.<eos> I hope you get in the safe. You are guaranteeing me ten, even if it's like Al Capone's vault.<eos> If it's empty, how am I gonna get you $10,000?
So Lonnie grabs the kid out of the back of the car, puts him down on the ground face-up, pulls out his arm, right, between two cinder blocks, and he tells me, "Jump on it.<eos> "Both feet, hard as you can.<eos> Aim for the back of the elbow." Bam!<eos> Right?<eos> Now, you break an elbow like that, and it's just never gonna heal right.
Don't talk about Karen like that.<eos> Not even joking.<eos> I'm not joking. She's pretty hot.<eos> I especially like her black lipstick.<eos> Good, it'll match the black eye I'm about to give you.
And I'll chase you away, too.<eos> No, well, sad doesn't scare me.<eos> I am staying put until the cavalry comes.<eos> Train has gone way off the tracks out there.<eos> Oh, yeah, like it's chugging along in here.
- What's the problem?<eos> - It's got Hugh's hand.<eos> His heart rate is at 165.<eos> - Sho, can we trust the glove?<eos> - It's very tight.
It's squeezing.<eos> Kat. Kat, are you okay?<eos> Yes.<eos> The suit's thick enough.<eos> It's twisting up your leg.
And that would mean Zack was a teenager as well at time of death.<eos> Okay, I'll start the facial reconstruction and see if I can find anything in missing persons.<eos> What about cause of death?<eos> Nothing readily apparent, but look at the inferior margin of the L4 vertebra.<eos> The striae suggests that it was cut by some kind of saw.
The bone is smooth, but the contour is indented, which means the age is between 20 and 29, same as our victim.<eos> Good work, Ms. Warren.<eos> I concur.<eos> Except, look.<eos> It's also sharp with irregular projections.
The skull was still pretty covered in carbon, but I don't think I missed anything.<eos> And then go closer on the mandible.<eos> Oh, right, I see what I missed:<eos> the weathering to the mandible.<eos> It suggests bite collapse.
It's a parasitic roundworm.<eos> And the good news is this guy is still alive.<eos> Okay. I am so canceling that hay ride with Michael Vincent.<eos> Angela, I assure you the worm is not indigenous to the hay.<eos> It most likely came from within the victim and vacated after death.
Okay.<eos> Dr. Fuentes, I can't help but notice that you're not wearing your new jacket.<eos> Did I get the wrong size?<eos> No, no.<eos> No, no, it's perfect.
If I eat a sugary cookie, the sugar lures you in like the Trojan horse, but waiting inside that cookie is a huge load of butter or, shortening.<eos> And that's what fattens you up.<eos> And that's the part that leads to the diabetes, it's the fatty foods, not really so much the sugar.<eos> It's not that sugar's good for you.<eos> There's no nutrients in it.
But, you know, mostly everybody in this neighborhood got asthma or, either cancer.<eos> My neighbor there died from cancer probably just last year.<eos> My nephew down the street, he's got cancer, he's in terminal cancer, stage four.<eos> Not a smoker, not a drinker.<eos> And it's not in his lungs, it's in his lymph nodes.
My nephew down the street, he's got cancer, he's in terminal cancer, stage four.<eos> Not a smoker, not a drinker.<eos> And it's not in his lungs, it's in his lymph nodes.<eos> Now see if you live here and saw the way they do, we don't eat no pork.<eos> Well, I don't eat bacon because I know where it come from.
She was always...<eos> Don't think I'll ever forget what happened here today.<eos> And you will pay.<eos> You didn't mention my garden.<eos> Well, your garden is part of your backyard, so it's automatically included in the property that goes to Jenn.
- We're almost done.<eos> I'll be with you in a minute.<eos> Oh.<eos> And mention my lily pond.<eos> It's in my garden.
Actually, I have to say, I'm... I'm quite jealous.<eos> So all this is just a bunch of bullshit?<eos> Including the key?<eos> No, the key was real.<eos> And it means everything.
I told you to change that.<eos> Listen, I was right.<eos> You were wrong.<eos> Remember my bigfoot?<eos> It's called Heart Enterprises, and they're behind everything... the junkies, the racers.
Go on, now.<eos> Chad... look at these floors.<eos> But I...<eos> What did I say about mopping up?<eos> If this is place is going to shit, it's going to shit clean!
Lab rats for what?<eos> Bad monkey!<eos> Candy?<eos> - Not just candy... - What's in the candy.<eos> Heart wanted to reengineer sugar so it wouldn't make people fat, which smax doesn't.
Your skills do match nicely with our internal defense systems.<eos> Exactly.<eos> Glad you see it my way.<eos> Security is a big responsibility, Christopher.<eos> But it also comes with coveted perks.
Do you know where we are?<eos> This is Majora.<eos> Our home.<eos> They call us Barbarians, but it's not exactly barbaric, is it?<eos> The Seedmakers abandoned this resort because it didn't produce enough cash for them.
Claireview Rehabilitation Center for Women?<eos> You know it?<eos> We were inmates there. Tortured by their guards, their men, but we burned that hell hole to the ground.<eos> So if you're still trying to find Claireview, why don't you head up north and look for the crater?<eos> It might still be smoking.
A bit barbaric?<eos> Perhaps.<eos> Shamefully pedantic?<eos> Without a doubt.<eos> But by golly if it won't do the trick.
Both victims had damage to the prefrontal cortex.<eos> The Demonmust be feeding on negative emotions.<eos> Anger, hate, rage.<eos> Causing the host to violently act on those urges.<eos> So we continue to scan for venom and heat signatures. Try to narrow down the host before it strikes again.
Saps the nerve endings.<eos> Oh, I'm totally fine.<eos> Why did you call me here?<eos> Your bite...<eos> It was so strong.
She's about this tall, pigtails, always... wears a scarf.<eos> Hey, where'd you get that scarf?<eos> Nowhere.<eos> I found it.<eos> It's mine.
You are not my son.<eos> Clary is not your sister.<eos> Jace, don't.<eos> The mortal cup is still still out there.<eos> He's the only one who knows where it is.
I don't know.<eos> That's a good question.<eos> - Oh, where'd my yogurt go?<eos> - That's also a good question.<eos> Do you know where it went?
It's in our blood.<eos> Right.<eos> So, Gus, what's your last name?<eos> What nationality is that?<eos> Oh, it's, um, Scottish. German.
- Here.<eos> Okay, I'll clean it up.<eos> It won't leave a stain.<eos> Not so much a stain that I'm worried about, it's more, like...<eos> When a dog poops, it's marking its territory.
I--I went to go fill out a lease application.<eos> I don't know.<eos> But what?<eos> It's stupid.<eos> It asked questions, ok?
I don't know.<eos> But what?<eos> It's stupid.<eos> It asked questions, ok?<eos> It asked questions about the last 3 years.
That was Prometheus.<eos> I fired the arrows.<eos> Listen, earlier Thea was talking to me about not taking on other people's sins.<eos> What happened with Malone, that's on Prometheus, not you.<eos> Well, Quentin, that advice would mean a little bit more if it wasn't coming from Thea right now.
The D.A. came to me, and...<eos> You're referring to Adrian Chase?<eos> That's correct.<eos> He instructed me to revise the report to indicate that the Throwing Star Killer was responsible.<eos> This report, and you went ahead and signed it, even though you knew it was fake and then passed it along to the police.
If you knew what he wanted, then why would you train him?<eos> You killed his father, and I helped him in his pursuit of vengeance because by then you'd killed mine!<eos> I never told you my full name, did I?<eos> No, you didn't.<eos> It's Talia al Ghul.
If you kill me, you'll only really be killing yourself.<eos> ...4, 3, 2, 1.<eos> 145 seconds.<eos> That's how long my father struggled under the water before he died.<eos> According to my father's autopsy, your arrow pierced his aortic arch, but it didn't kill him.
Kovar is inviting key members of the government-- politicians and military mostly-- to the opening of his casino.<eos> Then kill them with sarin gas, even the innocents?<eos> It's not good for business.<eos> Yes, but being in charge of whole country is good for business.<eos> We need to get into that casino, and we need to stop the attack before it happens.
Well, that's why it saddens me to tell you that there was an attempt by Solntsevskaya Bratva to crash these festivities and assassinate every one of these government officials here tonight.<eos> But don't worry.<eos> We have them all in custody.<eos> I am told they-- they planned to stage a gas attack in this very room...<eos> But, uh, sadly for them, even though they were successful in launching the attack... it backfired and, uh, killed every single one of them.
I might have taken a peek at your IRC window.<eos> I guess you could say that I hacked the hackers.<eos> What?<eos> The pixilation algorithm is encrypted.<eos> I should've known it would be encrypted, but it's encrypted.
- What's weird?<eos> No power.<eos> Whole place.<eos> What are the chances that Oliver forgot to pay his electric bill?<eos> Infinitesimal considering I rigged the place so that it'd be off the grid and--
What, to Starling City or to this horrible place?<eos> Does that frown mean you struck out?<eos> Mm, not exactly.<eos> The concrete's a proprietary formula.<eos> It's owned by a specific construction company.
He needs his space.<eos> We can use a different warlock.<eos> There you are.<eos> Any update on the mole?<eos> Yeah. Whoever it was is a clever one.
Whatever he's guarding must be pretty important.<eos> It's the Mortal Mirror.<eos> Jocelyn had it?<eos> I know it's crazy. The mirror and the cup.<eos> I guess my mom knew Elliot would do anything to keep it safe.
Who wants chow mein and fortune cookies?<eos> - I do!<eos> Any luck?<eos> I'm getting closer to narrowing down the location.<eos> You understand that once you retrieve the mirror, it becomes property of the Clave?
The mirror is Lake Lyn.<eos> We need to leave.<eos> What happened? My position within the Institute was<eos> Where is the Mirror?<eos> I said, "Where is it?"

What is that?<eos> It's Joe's panic alarm.<eos> He must be on that train.<eos> There's no way that train can stop...<eos> It's not gonna stop in time.
- Everybody brace yourselves! - What's happening?<eos> We're gonna move the train.<eos> How are we gonna do that?<eos> I'll vibrate it.<eos> I'll vibrate it fast enough that it can phase through this.
Yeah, that's what I've heard.<eos> Cisco told me, or showed me, that you all haven't been a team in a long time.<eos> And I know that I'm the reason for that.<eos> Iris's death shouldn't have driven me away from you all. I mean...<eos> I mean, it should've driven me closer.
I just, um... it's getting hot in here.<eos> What else is unique about shellac flakes?<eos> It's the fire accelerant used in all of the arson cases associated with Heat Monger.<eos> [scoffs] Such an embarrassing name.<eos> I like it.
It's you.<eos> It's the same person.<eos> It's just confusing.<eos> Hand me the girard processor.<eos> It'll help me prime his neocortical and medial frontal lobes.
"Animal attack."<eos> A girl named Hayden Foster's in the hospital, and her brother lost his heart.<eos> Looks like a werewolf.<eos> Well, they don't usually leave behind survivors.<eos> Freak probably got spooked before it could finish the job.

And yes, at first I was shocked at how Sam and Dean operate.<eos> But what lady bevell doesn't mention is the lives they've saved, monsters destroyed, and outcomes made better not because of the code, but because of Sam and Dean Winchester's sense of what's right.<eos> And that is the crux of the matter.<eos> The code is not a suggestion.<eos> It's an absolute.
And that is the crux of the matter.<eos> The code is not a suggestion.<eos> It's an absolute.<eos> The code is what separates us from the monsters.<eos> It is the order by which we all live.
Um, every one of them had years of experience.<eos> We got a letter from Eileen.<eos> Eileen?<eos> She sent it four days ago.<eos> It went snail mail 'cause she thought that her phone and her computer were both hacked.
This path is fit for goats only.<eos> You be quiet and watch where you're placing your feet!<eos> Bless you.<eos> That ram we have dragged, it will not work.<eos> It will not force open the gates... but it will work in its own way.
Lots of light and brand-new textured plush carpeting.<eos> - All headed in the same direction.<eos> It's just lovely. Do you know what my favorite thing about the upstairs is?<eos> - The laundry chute.<eos> - Oh, it's amazing.

Baudelaires, are you familiar with the term "in loco parentis"?<eos> It sounds like Latin.<eos> Latin and legal.<eos> "In loco parentis" means "acting in the role of a parent."<eos> It is a legal term and it applies to Count Olaf.
I don't know, you're gonna have to ask Vince, man.<eos> Yeah, I'll call him later.<eos> Just tell him I did a good job, okay?<eos> Uh, I... I'll bring the car up front.<eos> Where is it?
Why you sittin' here in the dark?<eos> Yeah, I was wondering the same thing.<eos> Oh, my god, the afternoon I've had.<eos> Two hours ago, i take the sea bass out.<eos> No sooner is it prepped and resting than -- boom!
Perhaps the worst experience of my life.<eos> It was proven to me, in public, and beyond the shadow of a doubt, that there was a battery... a fully charged battery... almost next to my skin for the better part of two hours.<eos> And I felt nothing.<eos> What does that mean to you?<eos> This condition... to me, it's as real as that chair.

How about that for starters?<eos> He did give us the first one for free. Yeah, I know.<eos> Okay, how about this... how about we pay you $450 for the one that already aired, and then we take it from there?<eos> Guys, I don't wanna get technical on ya, but that commercial... it doesn't actually belong to you.<eos> Look, it's the real and intellectual property of Saul Goodman Productions. I don't think so.
Uh, can I sit, Jughead?<eos> If you want.<eos> - What are you working on?<eos> - My novel.<eos> It's about this summer, and Jason Blossom.
Probably the shot that killed Jason Blossom.<eos> We know exactly what the police know.<eos> That a gun was fired. That a boy was shot.<eos> We don't know by whom.<eos> We know when it was fired.
Or who doesn't want me to apologize for who I am...<eos> And what I want.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> My lipstick's maple red, by the way.<eos> In case you're wondering why it tastes so sweet.
Look, I... Forget I said anything, okay?<eos> All right.<eos> I changed my mind about Toledo.<eos> Can you just put me on whatever the next bus out of town is?<eos> I don't even care where it's going.
I've been working on something.<eos> Really?<eos> What... what are you working on?<eos> I'm working on a suspense novel.<eos> I think in the right hands, when it's complete, It'll make quite a good little movie.
- to an attorney... - I was just upset because my brother showed up out of nowhere...<eos> - One will be provided for you.<eos> - He can be a real asshole.<eos> Where's your proof?<eos> Where... where is it?
She wasn't nice.<eos> She was using Norman and she was using you.<eos> She didn't deserve to die.<eos> Death isn't about deserving.<eos> It's just part of the deal.
We don't get to do this very often anymore.<eos> I want it to be awesome.<eos> Well, I'm going to go work on the play.<eos> If girls' night turns out to be a bust, you should come visit.<eos> It won't, but thanks.
- And here you are, pretending to be dead!<eos> - It's not like that.<eos> These photos are about confronting death, showing that it can be beautiful.<eos> Death is not beautiful!<eos> It's final!
Did you know, back then, most surgeries were done by barbers?<eos> Really? I'd never trust you with my hair.<eos> Okay, now... I'll use an aspirator.<eos> It's kind of like a vacuum.<eos> It'll suck out the contents of the uterus.
PJs, everyone.<eos> I got matching ones.<eos> Um, I fixed the mirror.<eos> Or... at least, I tried.<eos> It looks perfect.
You can't blame this on me.<eos> Sure I can.<eos> The best bagels in town are baked by a bigot!<eos> I wish we'd spent five more minutes working on our chant.<eos> It features strong alliteration and ends in "bigot." It's perfect.
And they're tapping phones, and they're monitoring bank accounts, and I just...<eos> We need a new hub. I need a new hub.<eos> Okay?<eos> This place...<eos> It's away from every single law enforcement agency in the US and it's cash rich. Okay?
- Yup.<eos> You see, the beauty of fishing is that mostly nothing happens, so there's plenty of time to talk.<eos> And what did you want to talk about?<eos> About another item on your list.<eos> Look, I know why it's on there, but... you shouldn't want that.
Way to be objective.<eos> Don't answer him.<eos> - I like your hat.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> It's new.
- People keep asking me about it.<eos> - We were just baking.<eos> Nothing else.<eos> I mean, there was an incident with frosting, but it was totally PG.<eos> It was... It was PG-13, but...
Despite their differences, despite their suspicions.<eos> Together.<eos> We need to do the same if we're going to survive.<eos> Because the enemy is real.<eos> It's always been real.
Something activates the latent virus and only Arias knows what it is.<eos> But until we find that out everyone, living and dead, are his potential weapons.<eos> If we don't figure this out now there won't be little towns like this for you to drink your sorrows away in ever again.<eos> I created a vaccine.<eos> And I tried it on myself and it works.

By themselves, these viruses either have no potency or they run the risk of activating on their own.<eos> But when combined they become an effective, controllable bioweapon.<eos> Nicely done, professor.<eos> It's no wonder you survived Raccoon City.<eos> If the trigger's airborne, it's harder to control where it goes or who gets it.
Hey, Ana.<eos> How you doing?<eos> What do you say we get you outta here?<eos> Just gonna put this car jack underneath the steering column.<eos> It will release some pressure off your legs, okay?
Frankie, your car is in the middle of the street.<eos> Oh, fuck, I left my car in the middle of the street!<eos> Ooh! Nice.<eos> Oh, wow, it's a lot lighter than...<eos> Who cares? Mine. It's a lot lighter than mine.
Yes, he's handsome!<eos> I mean, he's not not-handsome.<eos> Now, Grace, that's exactly the kind of conversation you save for after the show.<eos> Grace, do you have the TV?<eos> Yeah, it's in my purse.
MI-6. They've been sent from outside the bloc to clean up our mess, which is not just embarrassing... It might have serious consequences.<eos> We need to find broussard and recover our host's artifact.<eos> And nothing in your resume or work so far makes me believe that you will be useful in this endeavor.<eos> Sir, I've been working in this bloc for six months.<eos> I... I know the history of the insurgency, how it's structured.
-Yeah.<eos> -I love saying your name. -Oh.<eos> -It's a delight.<eos> -That's nice.<eos> It rolls off the tongue. Kaley Cuoco.
- No, I can't.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> Look.<eos> Think about it, Sarah.<eos> Whatever this place is, it's the answer.
Well, it would've been five, but I turned down Rob Lowe.<eos> Twice, actually.<eos> It just feels like this pain isn't gonna go away.<eos> Ah, well, that's what I said about childbirth.<eos> But it did.
Twice, actually.<eos> It just feels like this pain isn't gonna go away.<eos> Ah, well, that's what I said about childbirth.<eos> But it did.<eos> And it will. Now...
- No.<eos> - Be easy, Hawk.<eos> - Can I come with you?<eos> - Taking control of your life, huh? - Trying.<eos> - That smell. You can't understand how wonderful it is.
We're going to over-prepare and then act like we're winging it.<eos> To each her own.<eos> So mote it be.<eos> I'm gonna take a shower. I smell like a brush fire.<eos> I'm gonna purify this chair because it would've been the last thing I saw before you shot me.
This isn't gonna work for me, Frankie.<eos> We have a meeting with Marla at 4:00.<eos> Oh, no.<eos> If your pain could talk, what would it say?<eos> It just said, "Ah!"
- Yeah. Okay.<eos> I think I might have partied in this.<eos> Oh, Jesus.<eos> Do you want to live in this food truck?<eos> Well... it does have a big kitchen.
Many times.<eos> Henry, is that juniper tree still there?<eos> - Oh, yes.<eos> - Oh, it has the softest grass.<eos> It feels delicious on your ass.
[Sheila] Oh, my... [grunts]<eos> - Would've been nice to have the lid.<eos> - [grunts] I couldn't find it.<eos> Right. [grunts]<eos> You'd think it would've been stored with the container, is all.
But...<eos> I jumped.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I wanted you to be happy, even for a minute.<eos> But it was alive, like Gary.
- Built-in mask.<eos> - No.<eos> He fell to the floor.<eos> Why?<eos> He didn't slip, he didn't trip, nobody was around him, he wasn't pushed, and he's holding his head like it was about to explode.
Third spot from the entrance on the right.<eos> - Anyone approach the car?<eos> - Not since I've been here.<eos> - We know which unit it is?<eos> - It's parked in the spot - Now you stay here, we'll check it out.
Previously on "Grimm"...<eos> I keep thinking I need to be carrying that stick, and I wanna know what's written on that cloth that's wrapped around it.
A stick?<eos> It's how Nick was able to follow Eve.<eos> The stick didn't go through.<eos> It can't.<eos> It doesn't belong there.
Come on, honey.<eos> Here we go.<eos> Nick and I met here to settle our differences about the key.<eos> Oh... that.<eos> Yeah, we both decided it couldn't fall into your hands.
I showed this to Renard and Adalind.<eos> It looks like Zerstoerer.<eos> And the staff he's carrying is pretty similar too.<eos> Except his had a lot of cracks in it.<eos> Well, I mean, if it's as old as this one, it would make sense it had a bunch of cracks in it.
Look what David is holding.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> I thought David killed Goliath with a slingshot.<eos> He had a staff too, but for some reason, that part of the story isn't promoted.<eos> Apparently David left this exact staff to his descendants, and the Davidic kings used it as a scepter until the destruction of the temple, when it miraculously disappeared.
We don't...<eos> And this big stick is supposed to help him make Diana his child bride and destroy the world as we know it.<eos> So long story short, we just have to destroy the Destroyer dude, or we're toast.<eos> There's still something about Zerstoerer's staff that's bothering me.<eos> It was completely cracked up, as if it had been put back together by a lot of different pieces, and not one of all of these texts references anything like that.

Yeah, something bothers me about it too.<eos> I mean, if it's as all-powerful as it's supposed to be and belonged to all the people it supposedly belonged to...<eos> Then how did this Zerstoerer guy get his grubby mitts on it?<eos> I was just reading about this.<eos> There's a prophecy about a staff with the power of the gods, and it can't be destroyed.
-[Alba] No, you won't lose your jobs.<eos> Carlos destroyed the rotary.<eos> I don't think he wants it to move forward.<eos> [Carlota] You don't? Well, I do.<eos> Because they're rebuilding it and Miguel says it'll be working in a day.
Katroina Bonnet, as I live and breathe.<eos> Pouis Pitt.<eos> I do declare.<eos> No, um, you see,<eos> Katrina, you need to work on your code name for me, 'cause it's way too obvious.
Okay, bitch, say something.<eos> - You seeing this?<eos> - Head down this row.<eos> Wait. Yeah, that room on your left.<eos> It's got an anti-decay charm on it.
No one gets in without an ID.<eos> - Mm-hmm. - Keep your eye out for vagrants.<eos> They're gonna want to use the bathrooms, can't let them.<eos> You'd think it'd be easy to tell the difference between a homeless guy and an art student.<eos> It's not.
But the sign says reserved.<eos> So, if you wanna sit, there's always the bar.<eos> This is ridiculous.<eos> Section's been empty all night.<eos> Hell, it's always empty.
- Yes, we know.<eos> We know. You went into huge debt, just to become more boring.<eos> It's crippling debt.<eos> And thanks for never leaving a tip.<eos> What they teach you is, you can't tell the market what it wants.
So... maybe you'd like to tell me yours.<eos> Why don't I show you instead?<eos> People are really expressing themselves in here.<eos> The floor is very sticky.<eos> It's very, very sticky.
Made a homemade suet...<eos> First off, it's Nasty Gal.<eos> Second, this message board should be called David Lynch's Elephant Man, because it's full of freaks and sad as fuck.<eos> You all saw that post, right?<eos> It's gone now, but I saw it.

Halston vintage.<eos> - It's perfect.<eos> - Yes.<eos> Hey. Even you need to give it up for the jumpsuit.<eos> It'd look good in a museum exhibit about lady astronauts from the '70s.
Yeah, well, I'd never put up with that.<eos> And maybe that's why I'm doing so great.<eos> You would get so fired from my job, because it's not for self-absorbed narcissists.<eos> I would never do your job.<eos> It's a joke.
What?<eos> Nah, we're just having some fun.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Well, now the fun is over.<eos> What if it isn't over, mein fuhrer?
So when are you two coming back to work for me?<eos> We're not.<eos> I didn't know you had a dog.<eos> I don't.<eos> It died.
Let me.<eos> Niklaus.<eos> We're here.<eos> This spell is strong.<eos> It's been reinforced over time, which means it's going to take time to break.
No one expects a tiny realtor lady to jump on their back and rip out their throat.<eos> Besides, there's something I enjoy about the kill.<eos> - Really?<eos> - Yeah. It's like a rush.<eos> It feels like I'm giving my body something it needs in an intense and powerful way.
If you want to cheer me up, while you're at Farm Station, get that weed we stashed behind the wall of your old bedroom.<eos> Just... yes.<eos> Music to my ears.<eos> Hey, you want a hug?<eos> Hey, blueprint for the hydro-generator, and don't forget, it's filled with hydrazine that combines with oxygen to make water, so go slow.
I don't know. Uh...<eos> This code is advanced.<eos> It's like fifth-generation syntax.<eos> I've never seen anything like it.<eos> Every time I keep trying to alter it, it kicks me right back to the ...
Now you are like an infant, unable to process these new emotions or the idea that you don't always get everything that you want.<eos> And you have yet to experience the thrill that killing can bring.<eos> Maybe I'll experience that now... with you.<eos> Destroy this body, sure.<eos> It was designed only for killing.
We have to refuel.<eos> Also, we had no choice.<eos> - Because of that room?<eos> - It's the only place that can contain Aida's teleportation ability.<eos> It's outfitted with technology we used to stop Gordon, the first guy we encountered with that particular skill set.
My plan will rebuild the world that you have grown accustomed to... one where Inhumans are hunted.<eos> And we control the rest.<eos> It doesn't hurt that both of us are unstoppable.<eos> But your plan is flawed.<eos> It's too clean.
I'm as surprised as you.<eos> What happened?<eos> The darkhold.<eos> My arm still hurts.<eos> Why won't it heal?
Yes, sir.<eos> My pleasure.<eos> Any other special requests?<eos> They had tuna at Loaves and Fishes yesterday.<eos> It looked good.
Anyway, she needs to sell her house.<eos> - Do you have a card?<eos> - No, but I have a pen.<eos> It has all our information on it, so... [items rattling] anyone can find us.<eos> Oh, my God, it was in my purse.
I thought about what you said in the car, and you're right, I'm not a killer.<eos> All right.<eos> I can do this alone.<eos> I got a new kill poncho.<eos> It's pink, you know, because why not?
- Yes, I do.<eos> I also know you still have time to go stop this sale from going through.<eos> Are you kidding?<eos> They signed the documents.<eos> It's already gone through.
I can't believe we did this.<eos> Let's get out of here.<eos> - I could leave.<eos> - Not yet.<eos> [Cole] There it is, yes... oh, God, no!
Let's get out of here.<eos> - I could leave.<eos> - Not yet.<eos> [Cole] There it is, yes... oh, God, no!<eos> Where is it?

Do it, or I will.<eos> Mr. Palmer.<eos> I take it you didn't get the memo.<eos> This case is over.<eos> Well, that's because it's not.
I don't like your husband.<eos> He's my ex-husband.<eos> Are you sure about that? You don't know about the little visit he paid me.<eos> Quite the menacing little twat.<eos> Anyway, it worked.
Oh, Jonesy!<eos> Thank God!<eos> Don't "Jonesy" me!<eos> We know about your special panic room.<eos> Where is it?
I usually am.<eos> I've got a lock on the delineator.<eos> Oh, no.<eos> What is it?<eos> Uh, it appears to be in Gertrude's territory.
Hey, look, even if my dad has turned there is no way he could have overpowered J'onn.<eos> Yeah. That's what I would have thought.<eos> Oh, thank God you're okay.<eos> Jeremiah's arm, the one we thought had nerve damage,<eos> it's been enhanced.
Always.<eos> Cadmus has them penned up in cells that are rigged to kill them.<eos> All Lillian has to do is press one button.<eos> I can't disable it myself. But in the DEO armory, there's a magnetic field disrupter.<eos> It will shut down the cages.

So, Winn bugged Henshaw and rigged a remote so I could beam us back if she double-crossed us.<eos> Hope for the best...<eos> Have Winn Schott prepare for the worst.<eos> Your stubborn pride still blinds you to the truth.<eos> Why is it turning back on?
Who's that?<eos> Oh, that's Cross-eyed Christian Fitness Mam.<eos> Don't worry, you'll get to know them all soon.<eos> - Do you like that wine?<eos> - Yeah, it's lovely.

Dammit.<eos> Edie, what's going on?<eos> I-I dropped my earring.<eos> Jesus.<eos> There it is.
What's on my mind?<eos> I mean, you see what's going on here.<eos> This is all him.<eos> It's a man who's never served.<eos> Wouldn't know what a real war was if it jumped up and bit him in the ass.
But you know what, Alice?<eos> When I was 11, he took me to the Summit Arena in Houston for this tour.<eos> And he wasn't that old then, but he was bald already, and he was the oldest guy there anyway by, like, a mile.<eos> And the Beastie Boys had this huge, um, inflatable dick on the stage. No, seriously. And they thought...<eos> It was, like, 9 feet, and they thought it was really funny to sort of, um... poke Dad with it for, like, the whole show.
I used to make my own paints from flowers and berries.<eos> These orange ones are the most vibrant.<eos> I like orange.<eos> Oh, there's a butterfly.<eos> I think it's stuck.
These orange ones are the most vibrant.<eos> I like orange.<eos> Oh, there's a butterfly.<eos> I think it's stuck.<eos> Yeah, it has a broken wing.
- Okay. You want me to help you rob the most deadly vampire on the planet?<eos> I will pass.<eos> If you're worried about a fight... allow me to even the odds.<eos> The stone is kyanite.<eos> It's been spelled to grant you total control of your werewolf nature, even during a full moon.
Here.<eos> There's something you need to see.<eos> This guy, Dominic... you trust him?<eos> Loyalty is good for business, and I give him a lot of business.<eos> This spirit... it's ancient.
Why don't you take out your frustration on that filthy jawbone our enemy seems so fascinated by.<eos> Gladly.<eos> "A man of words and not of deeds, is like a garden full of weeds."<eos> "And when the weeds begin to crawl, it's like a bird upon the wall."<eos> "And when the bird away does fly, it's like an eagle in the sky."
Did you see her come in?<eos> I'm gonna say good night to Hope.<eos> Hayley, wait.<eos> Impressive boundary spell.<eos> Unfortunately, it only lasts as long as the witch who cast it.
When that pendant was shattered, Elijah's mind shattered with it.<eos> He's most likely retreated to the innermost core of his consciousness.<eos> - How do we find that?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> It could be anywhere in over a thousand years of memories, but if I try fixing the pendant before finding him and healing his mind, he'll be permanently fractured, like casting a broken bone before it's been properly set.
I can't do this on my own.<eos> We're gonna need all the allies we can get.<eos> Vincent, Sofya... Klaus.<eos> Even Rebekah.<eos> Or else this fight's over before it starts.
Assuming I get to Elijah on time, it should at least slow the poison from the rosebush.<eos> But how are you gonna find him?<eos> You said he was cloaked.<eos> This is Marcel's venom.<eos> That rosebush was born from his blood, which means it has the same magical signature.
I'm familiar with the scent of fertilizer.<eos> I won't ask you again. What does it want?<eos> Why, freedom, of course.<eos> A spirit cannot manifest the true depths of its power.<eos> But when it's once again made flesh...
The Lockwoods, they didn't just safeguard the bone...<eos> They kept records with names, dates and locations.<eos> Turns out they had knowledge of other families that were charged with guarding the rest of the remains.<eos> Now, does the name Labonair mean anything to you?<eos> - It's familiar, yeah.
And I disagree.<eos> I think Boo's giving tree actually does more takin' away than giving.<eos> - How so?<eos> - The tree's a sign of goodness.<eos> But when it gets filled with cement, the tree symbolizes what's been taken from Scout, her innocence.
Nah. I just spoke to my girl in there.<eos> She didn't say shit about this.<eos> Maybe the riot hadn't started yet?<eos> Ain't you listening?<eos> It started yesterday.
Good morning.<eos> My name... is Tasha Jefferson and I'm an inmate here at Litchfield.<eos> Two days ago, our friend and fellow inmate, Poussey Washington, was murdered by a prison guard.<eos> Poussey Washington.<eos> And I'm sayin' her name again because it can't ever be said enough.
I'll ask the kid to just draw a little circle.<eos> And maybe, in the simple act of trying his best, maybe he'll win me over with a simple circle.<eos> Here's the impression your little circle made on me, John.<eos> It lacked focus, ambition, clarity, precision, dedication, passion and honesty.<eos> And well, it reminded me of you.
Tag!<eos> It's good to see you, bro!<eos> No, it's just awesome, man! - Oh yeah.<eos> - How was your flight?<eos> - Wow! - It was great.
She's got the old fishing hook.<eos> -So...<eos> -Has it got an instruction manual? [chuckles]<eos> I'm not really one for an instruction manual anyway, so, that's all right.<eos> But maybe if we find it in the book and it's edible, we can...
Where's Liam?<eos> Join me on stage, little brother.<eos> Put 'em up, Sparrow.<eos> Be careful, I've got the longer reach.<eos> Thank you again for coming, and please enjoy the palace. And everything it has to offer.
- The one percent. - Marie-Antoinette.<eos> - The one percent.<eos> - That's right.<eos> And I intend to keep this one-percent neck.<eos> I had it contoured last January after Colicchio told me that it had more rings than a Swiss roll.
- Oh, my God, I'm starving.<eos> -Commissary ice cream?<eos> -Fuck to the yes.<eos> Be all notified of gate time.<eos> "Amanda, I will not stop until my ass is so small it disappears entirely.
Emori.<eos> John, what's wrong?<eos> It looks like we may need my people, after all.<eos> There's a storm coming.<eos> When it hits, we need to be on the right side of that door.
Are we ready to go if we need to?<eos> We're prepped for fetal extraction.<eos> And this group is being set up to mimic a subhuman womb.<eos> The fetus will continue to develop normally?<eos> Exactly as if it were in a healthy mother.
The younger hunter asked the old people where he could get a boomerang like this."<eos> "The old people told him of a special tree, so the younger hunter headed out to cut himself a stronger and much larger boomerang.<eos> But the younger hunter did not notice that the tree's blood ran hot and poured like lava.<eos> It was the blood that made the older hunter's boomerang so powerful.<eos> It would cut through his prey, killing them instantly."
- He can't do that.<eos> - He's doing it.<eos> Well, then, we need to stop him.<eos> Its scales would shimmer under the water like jewels.<eos> And that fish was so big, so big, that whenever it moved its fin, huge waves would crash against the shore.
You're not the only one who's special, little brother.<eos> You used to fight for the right reasons, Waruu.<eos> The younger hunter, he crafted a stronger, much larger boomerang.<eos> He takes the boomerang, smears blood all over it like lava.<eos> It travels so fast and with so much power it cuts through the hunter, killing him instantly.
- Perfect water.<eos> Just cold as tits, right? - Uh-huh.<eos> So I open my fly box.<eos> It's not my fly box.<eos> And it's empty.
Um, this here...<eos> Right there. And the first time I came here, you pointed out this stream right here, and I saw that it flowed west.<eos> Okay? It's curious, right?<eos> Flowing west?<eos> So, if you trace that stream all the way here, all the way there, all the way up into Jefferson City... it hits the Missouri.

Maybe...<eos> Maybe a party's exactly what we need.<eos> I really miss your sister.<eos> You know, once this trial is over, I'm sure Meg will be in touch.<eos> Well, I hope it's over soon, then.
We're safer at your bunker.<eos> It's not stocked.<eos> - I told you, I ate everything.<eos> - So we restock it.<eos> You said it was big enough for two.
Dad and I looked at it last time we were there.<eos> It's probably fine, but let's hurry, just in case.<eos> Okay?<eos> Start the engine!<eos> Hurry it's getting thicker.
No one needs to die.<eos> You should leave.<eos> Please.<eos> The engine room is right below us.<eos> If it blows, you'll destroy the whole ship.
Okay.<eos> Idea.<eos> Do you guys remember the Sumerian shield charm we learned in PA?<eos> Like, to keep you safe from shattered glass or something?<eos> It's a simple spell, but that doesn't mean it's not powerful.
It's a swing state. - [Milo] Can you even imagine a Republican Gabe?<eos> "Chaz, come summer on my very big boat.<eos> The deck is made of endangered rhino bones."<eos> [laughing] "Roland, you must try the caviar.<eos> It's like the salty tears of poor people."
Reporting live from the Piedmont Hotel, the excitement is definitely...<eos> Better not let them see the name on your credentials.<eos> Those folks out there love their president.<eos> I love pound cake.<eos> Doesn't mean it's good for me.
And I say "Good shot."<eos> Good shot.<eos> But before all that, I'd like to talk about the original Honda NSX.<eos> We have a picture of it here.<eos> When that car was launched in 1990, it was considered remarkable because it was fast and exciting like a Ferrari, but unlike a Ferrari of the time, it was also incredibly reliable and very, very easy to drive.
Honda killed that car off 12 years ago.<eos> But finally, they've come up with a replacement.<eos> So I've been down to our track to see what it's like.<eos> This is it.<eos> It costs ã138.000. Around the same as a Porsche 911 Turbo S.
But finally, they've come up with a replacement.<eos> So I've been down to our track to see what it's like.<eos> This is it.<eos> It costs ã138.000. Around the same as a Porsche 911 Turbo S.<eos> And it has the futuristic lines you would expect of a rare-breed Honda.
And then there's the way it revs.<eos> Most turbocharged engines are a bit wheezy at the top end, but because the twin-scroll turbo in this is mounted in the V of the engine... just like it is in a Ferrari California, coincidentally, the rev counter is still a blur<eos> This engine is... it's a masterpiece.<eos> An absolute gem.<eos> So, while this may look like a Wolseley, it certainly doesn't go like one.

So, while this may look like a Wolseley, it certainly doesn't go like one.<eos> It has a top speed, in fact, of 191mph.<eos> What this car is is a Ferrari... wearing four-door sensi-panties.<eos> And that brings me onto this car's party piece.<eos> At normal speeds, it's very quiet and very civilised.

Time for Jeremy's Alfa Quadriplogio.<eos> That's not quick, mate!<eos> I'm sorry. That's rubbish!<eos> In the dry, it would have done a 1:15.<eos> - No, it wouldn't.
Yeah, real places.<eos> - They really are.<eos> Those place names are real.<eos> Anyway, we'll pick up that pointless test later on.<eos> - It's not pointless! - Yes, it is.
There's a gas station right around the corner from here.<eos> We can't go back out there.<eos> Well, how long do you think we've got before something happens?<eos> It seems like the mist comes and go, right?<eos> It's thicker when we're out there, and then it kind of disappears when we're not.
We can't go back out there.<eos> Well, how long do you think we've got before something happens?<eos> It seems like the mist comes and go, right?<eos> It's thicker when we're out there, and then it kind of disappears when we're not.<eos> Yeah, it was super thick when Mikhail, you know...
It seems like the mist comes and go, right?<eos> It's thicker when we're out there, and then it kind of disappears when we're not.<eos> Yeah, it was super thick when Mikhail, you know...<eos> Okay, okay.<eos> So we wait for it to withdraw a little bit, and then we make a run for it.
Lose my faith?<eos> How could I?<eos> I've just seen a demon appear and the smoke rising from the pit to torment mankind just as it's written in Gospel.<eos> I'm not scared because I'm losing my faith.<eos> I'm scared because it's stronger than ever.
Well, I thought you said all this was beautiful.<eos> Oh, it is.<eos> So is a volcanic eruption or a tsunami.<eos> Few things are more beautiful than destruction, but doesn't mean I enjoy it.<eos> So this mist, you hope it'll disappear again?
So is a volcanic eruption or a tsunami.<eos> Few things are more beautiful than destruction, but doesn't mean I enjoy it.<eos> So this mist, you hope it'll disappear again?<eos> Yes, of course.<eos> And it will... once it has what it came for.

It reacts to us somehow on a physiological level.<eos> I just don't know how yet, but if I can find out, then I can save people.<eos> This will slow your metabolism and your hormone output.<eos> Maybe I can slow how the mist reacts to us.<eos> If it doesn't attack after around 30 seconds, I'll know I'm on the right track.
Nathalie, where is Link?<eos> All right, it's okay.<eos> You don't have to tell me, but...<eos> The mist came.<eos> It saved me.
All right, it's okay.<eos> You don't have to tell me, but...<eos> The mist came.<eos> It saved me.<eos> It saved me from him.
Your Honor, may we allow the accused to speak?<eos> He can only make things worse for himself.<eos> Hey, guys, uh, I think I found something.<eos> Franklin's journals didn't have any more reference to the Despair creature, but he did reference the account of a freed slave who had a run-in with it at Valley Forge.<eos> Now, I located the account, but it's in some kind of handwritten code.
I heard your husband was on the chopper.<eos> My daughter, too.<eos> Well... sometimes the pilot sets down if there's weather.<eos> The sky was clear last night.<eos> Oh, yeah, it was.
Right. In the last ten months, three weeks and four days, did you ever lose hope?<eos> Good question.<eos> Did I ever lose hope?<eos> I can say that when I came to, I was completely stripped of hope.<eos> But the body does an amazing thing when it's pressed against a wall with nowhere to go.
But now I hear the number of marmot is diminishing.<eos> So this is why they've prohibited the hunting of marmot.<eos> Firstly, you put two hot stones into the rear legs, and a big stone in the butt.<eos> Then you put some meat, then two or three stones, then more meat, and more stones, until it's full.<eos> Last time we used a sharp stone, it poked a hole through the skin.
We have to make those people up there feel safe.<eos> Or they'll leave, all of them.<eos> We have to defend this ranch with our lives or they will be slaughtered, all of them.<eos> This place, this place is all we have.<eos> And right now, it is... teetering.
I gave it to someone...<eos> -What does it say?<eos> -I don't remember.<eos> Marga! Marga!<eos> The note, where is it?
When Aethelwold was here, he mentioned nothing of crossing into Daneland.<eos> What did he mention?<eos> He mentioned you, Lord, and how you took his crown.<eos> Aethelwold is permanently idle.<eos> My advice is the same as it has always been, you should put him on trial and then kill him.
Alfred has decided to give you this one last chance.<eos> Do you have a plan?<eos> Together, we will travel downriver, meet with the armies of Mercia and Wessex, make camp a short distance from Lunden.<eos> Do you have a plan of attack? Yes.<eos> It is not too dissimilar from your plan.
You come home safe. I got this.<eos> Raven says the black rain will be here soon.<eos> Raven's right.<eos> I used to love the rain.<eos> Now it terrifies me.
Ah, it's so good to hear your voice.<eos> I have bad news, Abby.<eos> The black rain's here.<eos> It's worse than we thought.<eos> It, uh... it burns on contact.
I have bad news, Abby.<eos> The black rain's here.<eos> It's worse than we thought.<eos> It, uh... it burns on contact.<eos> It kills.
Their whole theology was based on riding out the end of the world.<eos> I have bad news, Abby.<eos> Black rain's here.<eos> It's worse than we thought.<eos> It burns on contact.
I have bad news, Abby.<eos> Black rain's here.<eos> It's worse than we thought.<eos> It burns on contact.<eos> It kills.
The last guy just died, screaming in agony, and you want to try it again?<eos> Give us a better idea, Raven. Please.<eos> So what, we just go out there, hunt for someone else?<eos> No one's going anywhere in this storm.<eos> Then we wait for it to pass.
Be quick.<eos> Echo will send reinforcements.<eos> Where is it?<eos> It's beneath the altar.<eos> It's here.
_<eos> We were brought here for a reason, Gaia.<eos> Think.<eos> Is there another key?<eos> It... it would have a "12" on it.
I'm not here to speak about me.<eos> I'm here to speak about you.<eos> I'm very sorry that you lost your job, sir.<eos> But as to what I can do to help bring it back, the answer is nothing.<eos> It's gone... for good.
This group is actually part of a national program - that funds the arts in public schools.<eos> - Oh, that's wonderful.<eos> And, unfortunately, it, um, might all come to an end.<eos> You see, when the funding was approved, Congress put in a sunset clause, so the grant has to be renewed every five years.<eos> - When does it expire?
I offered to fly down and talk to them personally, But apparently her mother has a cousin who lives here, So... we flew them up instead.<eos> Some cases end well and you can... forget about them.<eos> But some some become a part of who you are.<eos> This job is going to change you.<eos> And not only that, it's going to show you who you really are.
- No, there's gotta be a...<eos> - Ahem.<eos> Hey! What? No, we're not molesting your robot.<eos> - What?<eos> - It kissed me, I didn't kiss it.
It's pretty fucking wild.<eos> There's, like, time travel, Oedipal shit...<eos> Sam, look at me.<eos> You make GLOW, I will make any... crazy time-travel sex-romp movie you want.<eos> What's it called?
Here's the "but." He puts the wrong date in the machine, and he goes back in time instead to the 1950s, where she's just a horny teenager, and she spends the rest of the movie<eos> Lookit, I've seen that movie.<eos> No, you haven't.<eos> I haven't made it.<eos> It's called Mothers and Lovers.
No, you haven't.<eos> I haven't made it.<eos> It's called Mothers and Lovers.<eos> Nah.<eos> Nah, bro, it's called Back to the Future.
Oh, boy, five whole minutes. (CHUCKLES)<eos> It's gum. This is gum.<eos> Gum isn't lunch.<eos> It's not even a snack.<eos> It's not very filling, but it's all they'll let you eat until dinner.
Actually, it's Professor Hobbs.<eos> Nice to meet you.<eos> Officially, no one who's here legally has met me.<eos> Unofficially, it's nice to meet you, too. I...<eos> I tried to get into your class, but it was full.
I can wash clothes, iron, dust, sweep and so many other things!<eos> There's no end to what I could accomplish given the chance.<eos> I'll take care of these dishes for you, Miss Cuthbert.<eos> You will see, I'll do them right.<eos> Be careful with the kettle. It's very hot.
My, my, you're the last folks I was looking for today, but I'm real glad to see you.<eos> And how are you doing, dear Anne?<eos> I'm well enough, thank you.<eos> What brings you by, Miss Cuthbert?<eos> The fact is, Mrs. Spencer, there's been a queer mistake somewhere and I've come over to see where it is.
Of course you're willing to talk.<eos> And the Azgeda alliance surrounds it.<eos> None of your people will get inside unless we come to terms.<eos> This war is inevitable.<eos> The only reason it hasn't happened before now is that Lexa commanded it.
Then we should break it open.<eos> Then it won't protect anyone.<eos> Bellamy will find a way.<eos> The black rain is keeping the clans at bay for now.<eos> But when it stops and they find out what your people did...
I've been looking everywhere.<eos> You shouldn't be here, Monty.<eos> None of us should be here.<eos> You know why that moon's red?<eos> It's really red?
- Give me the suit.<eos> - Hey, Murphy!<eos> Murphy, no!<eos> - What?<eos> - Look. You cut that suit, and it saves no one.
I got this.<eos> - Help the others into the Rover.<eos> - Ok. Come on.<eos> Clarke, you need to put on the suit.<eos> It was for Jasper.
- Help the others into the Rover.<eos> - Ok. Come on.<eos> Clarke, you need to put on the suit.<eos> It was for Jasper.<eos> At least now it'll do some good.
Good. Now we know the many ways we might die today, why don't you tell us what we have to do to live?<eos> How much further to the lighthouse?<eos> Oh, so you can talk.<eos> I wondered.<eos> It's right through these trees, sunshine.
-Sure.<eos> -Honey, you don't need to be here.<eos> -Oh, no, I think I do.<eos> -For this particular question?<eos> So, the cup is Dixie-cup sized... and it's got a sharp, plastic edge.
I was fucking laying there.<eos> There was a DJ over here on the one-and-the-two wooka-wooka thing.<eos> Right?<eos> And then they had this chocolate fountain.<eos> It was like a fountain, but it was chocolate!
And then they had this chocolate fountain.<eos> It was like a fountain, but it was chocolate!<eos> And you stuck the toothpick in the food, and you stuck it in the chocolate, and you stuck it in your mouth."<eos> Then, 'I want another drink! '<eos> Then they bring it, you drink it, it dribbles down and it gathers in your navel.
She's talking to a gorilla.<eos> I love gorillas. Who wouldn't talk to a gorilla?"<eos> Without thinking that my wife is sleeping, I just blurted out,<eos> "Ask it how much it can bench!<eos> Ask it how much it can bench!"
So, long story short, she's talking to this gorilla, and one day she decides to get it a little kitten.<eos> A little kitty cat, right?<eos> Immediately I'm thinking, like, "Don't get it a cat!<eos> It's a gorilla."<eos> It's gonna twist the thing's head off, throw the body over there, play with the head for a while.
This is its favorite part of the day.<eos> Its mind is engaged and it sees its little friend.<eos> And at this point, its vocabulary is, like, crazy now.<eos> The lady shows up. The gorilla's all amped up.<eos> It looks at her like, "Oh, shit!
So the lady's sitting there, she's like,<eos> "Well...<eos> Well, the... the kitty cat... it got hit by a car... and it's fucking dead."<eos> And the gorilla immediately took it in.<eos> It immediately took it in. It understood.
"Well...<eos> Well, the... the kitty cat... it got hit by a car... and it's fucking dead."<eos> And the gorilla immediately took it in.<eos> It immediately took it in. It understood.<eos> Like, its bottom lip started quivering, its eyes started watering up, it was signing "crying."
That's what you're leaving me with? I've got to have that in my fucking head?<eos> How is that the end of the video?<eos> Somebody, for fuck's sake, tell me.<eos> Dude, that gorilla understood the concept of death.<eos> If it understands the concept of death, it understands its own captivity. Okay?
Then she could have came back and broke that gorilla out of jail, right?<eos> Show up at night. "You're doing it!" Put on the jacket, hat. "Come on!"<eos> You take him down to the car, the only way to get him back.<eos> You've got to take it by car down to the harbor.<eos> That's the only way to get it back to the jungle.
Now, his job is to go in and take out the skills player... upset the other team.<eos> Seems he's pretty good at it.<eos> Fights can be strategic, too.<eos> A fight can change momentum, clear the air, break a stalemate.<eos> It also rallies the team against a common enemy.
- The topcoat, I know.<eos> - Want some water?<eos> Want me to keep going?<eos> I brought my engagement ring to Seattle.<eos> It's at the house in my jewelry bag, and I want you to have it.
-Nope.<eos> You aren't going anywhere, Thelma and Puh-lease.<eos> We can print those papers right here in our home.<eos> I know a gentleman with a printer machine.<eos> I hope it still works.
Marla, everybody.<eos> See?<eos> You need me.<eos> That better not be Marla's bass.<eos> It's already been processed.
Actually, can you keep a secret?<eos> My wife is very close to making an arrest.<eos> We think the killer might actually be here.<eos> She found evidence just tonight.<eos> It's in the car right now.
Then I heard you had a big, beautiful tumor in here.<eos> Let me see.<eos> That... is massive.<eos> That is a thing of beauty... the Sistine Chapel of tumors.<eos> It's invaded deep into her posterior mediastinum.
These tumors aren't beautiful.<eos> They're horrifying and smart and designed to choke the life out of someone before they have a chance to live.<eos> Exquisite.<eos> What is it?<eos> It's extended all the way into her esophagus.
We can't reconstruct her entire chest cavity.<eos> If it's in her esophagus, the chances are it's also invaded her spine.<eos> You'd risk paralysis if you tried to take it out.<eos> We can at least remove the tumor from the heart itself... relieve some of the symptoms.<eos> I mean, it'll grow back, but it'll be slow-growing... buy her some time.
Oh, you doctors, you crazy people.<eos> You just have to try, you just have to cut people open.<eos> Resecting the tumor load out of your heart will help your symptoms and buy you time.<eos> Yeah, this tumor, it's just, uh... it's part of me.<eos> It's like my hair or my boobs or my weird-looking toes.
Uh, can you help me out?<eos> Okay, yeah, one second.<eos> Yeah?<eos> The body adapts.<eos> It protects itself.
Okay, yeah, one second.<eos> Yeah?<eos> The body adapts.<eos> It protects itself.<eos> But it can't close off completely or we're not really living, right?
Oh, my God.<eos> Okay.<eos> All right, I think I... That's it.<eos> Tell me what you see.<eos> Uh, I see the rebar, and it's in...
Stop it!<eos> Help him!<eos> Nobody's gonna help you.<eos> Look, your name isn't Bryan Hunt.<eos> It's Jonah Dixon.
What's good?<eos> So, you know, I got this movie idea.<eos> I've been thinking about this movie idea. It's, like, great.<eos> You know? I really think it can get an Oscar or something. I don't know.<eos> If we really put a lot of effort into it, it could really compete for a Golden Globe or something.
Those earrings are really nice.<eos> Where'd you get them?<eos> These?<eos> I got them at this awesome store.<eos> It's called:
Can we go now?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Where are we going?<eos> Spring and Lafayette.<eos> The movie may be called Death Castle, but in my opinion, it's filled with a whole lot of life.
- Yeah, I'm on it.<eos> - He doesn't have superspeed without gravity.<eos> - Newsflash, Raymond: I don't need superspeed to kick your ass.<eos> What's the red button?<eos> - It separates the Lem from the command module.
There will be word games played, do not be alarmed by what I may say.<eos> I assure you, once this is over, they shall pay for what they have done to us all.<eos> Thank you, Lord.<eos> What is your price?<eos> It must be fair, or you can keep her.
Doctor!<eos> Look, a stone cairn - Pictish civilisation.<eos> The bird!<eos> What about it?<eos> It said "dark".
The bird!<eos> What about it?<eos> It said "dark".<eos> Yes, well that's why we're hurrying, because there's not much light at this time of day.<eos> But it talked!
What about it?<eos> It said "dark".<eos> Yes, well that's why we're hurrying, because there's not much light at this time of day.<eos> But it talked!<eos> Well, of course it did.
- So, if a perfectly rational donkey... - That's me!<eos> gets placed between two identical bales of hay, the donkey won't be able to choose one over the other, and so it will starve to death.<eos> That's perfect. I can just starve to death, and I won't have to choose.<eos> But, well, according to Spinoza, the donkey isn't actually rational because making a choice is a good in itself.<eos> Okay, so sometimes the donkey's just got to choose which pizza it's gonna eat.
He's still out there.<eos> Pixie dust doesn't dictate what I do.<eos> Nothing and no one does.<eos> Pixie dust doesn't dictate anything.<eos> It just shows you the possibilities.
You brought me here for a love spell?<eos> It's not a love spell.<eos> I know they don't work.<eos> This arrow is a tool.<eos> It will lead you to gaze upon the person you love most.
Remember how you said this arrow will lead me to gaze upon the person I love most?<eos> Well, there's a very thin line between love and hate.<eos> There.<eos> That's much better.<eos> Now it will lead me to gaze upon the person I hate most.
Hiding, are you?<eos> No.<eos> No!<eos> The spell should have worked.<eos> It should have led me to gaze upon the person I hate most!
If you're gonna kidnap me again, may I humbly request I'm allowed to finish my ale first?<eos> I'm not here to kidnap you.<eos> And I'm... I'm sorry about that.<eos> So, if you're standing here, can I assume that the villain plan didn't work out so well?<eos> It didn't.
Look, until I get the chance to meet some potential new recruits, I just need you to steady the ship and not fuck anything up, Brian.<eos> Understood, boss.<eos> Still, in the meantime, there's no harm me showing you how we get things done the Fitzpatrick way.<eos> You obviously are aware the name Fitzpatrick is synonymous with fucking things up.<eos> Yeah, well, unless you want it to be "synonymous" with getting the sack, I suggest you start showing your new boss some respect.
I'd like to report a missing briefcase,<eos> - so I would, so I would.<eos> - I'm sorry?<eos> A briefcase, yer big eejit.<eos> It fell out of a car somewhere in the West Essex area.
Yeah, yes.<eos> I fucking love it!<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Right, Philip, before we close the deal on the asking price right now, we're going to need to test-run that Jacuzzi bath.<eos> And it is a deal breaker for us, I'm afraid, isn't it, Sam?
I'm not paying for this until it's been corrected.<eos> That is what we ordered.<eos> Ronnie popped in on Tuesday and told me to take your name off. What?<eos> Are you sure?<eos> Yeah, it was definitely Ronnie.
You can tell me.<eos> I won't be angry.<eos> I fixed the dryer, Claire, and you get to be here for the moment of truth.<eos> Pull the pin.<eos> It works.
He turned his phone back on. No, he got another one, but we were up on it.<eos> He must've been suspicious because his signal dropped out right after his train departed. Beach 98th.<eos> He turned it off right here.<eos> Looks like he was headed toward the end of the IND Rockaway Line.<eos> Yeah, that's what it looked like, but the transit cops out there say he wasn't on the train when it pulled into the Rockaway Park Station.
I don't know what to say.<eos> This has been going on for so long, I have no idea what to tell you.<eos> I'm not proud.<eos> All I know is I can't sleep... thinking about our kiss.<eos> I... will admit, it was a good one.
- What happened in my mouth?<eos> - It isn't that bad.<eos> - Are you kidding?<eos> - It's bad.<eos> - It smells like perfume.
- Bye-bye.<eos> - Bye-bye.<eos> We'll give those ones to the squirrels.<eos> Hi, folks. I have some bad news from Ground Control.<eos> A storm system is over the Chesapeake, so we have to wait it out.
What?<eos> I'm fine.<eos> I think you might have some issues with your new job.<eos> I love my job.<eos> It's great.
I love my job.<eos> It's great.<eos> - I hate it.<eos> I hate it so much.<eos> - It's terrible.
He used our equipment to synthesize a virus, making it chlorine and UV resistant.<eos> Then what doesn't make sense?<eos> Well, what the virus does.<eos> It's basically a harder-to-kill serotype 40 adenovirus.<eos> It's non-lethal.
Well, what the virus does.<eos> It's basically a harder-to-kill serotype 40 adenovirus.<eos> It's non-lethal.<eos> It would just give people a mild gastrointestinal bug.<eos> So, Raymond Thorpe went to the trouble of custom-tailoring a virus so it would survive the city's water safeguards.
Because of diarrhea?<eos> In developing countries, diarrhea kills hundreds of thousands of children a year.<eos> But this is not a developing country.<eos> Compared to England, America's a pimply teenager.<eos> Yes, Thorpe's plan, had it worked, would've created some terror, but given the ease with which he could have stolen or synthesized a far deadlier bug, it's hard to imagine that his agenda was political.
- I know. I know.<eos> It just keeps going!<eos> I know. I've pretty much stopped responding to most of it.<eos> See, that's why the Whole Foods line is key.<eos> It breaks through the clutter.
I think I'm gonna head home.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Mm, this weed pen is really awesome.<eos> - I know, right?<eos> - See how it lights up? - I know.
Looked like a mountain lion.<eos> - You kidding me?<eos> How old's the carcass?<eos> Damn.<eos> Well, it's coming back tonight.
- Come on in.<eos> Hey, Heather, you've got company!<eos> Whoa! Something smells good.<eos> Yeah, we're making apple pie.<eos> It'll be ready in about an hour if you wanna sit and chat.
Grumpy?<eos> I don't get it.<eos> I tried to get them to make me one for Colt, but they wouldn't put "Shithead" on it.<eos> Hey, the storm's settling in.<eos> You're welcome to come in for a drink till it lets up.
Same ol' Maggie.<eos> Do you have any idea how much fun I had last night?<eos> Well, I have a pretty good idea.<eos> Yeah, yeah, the sex was fine.<eos> I'm sorry, it was great.
Not every sword stroke is a kill!<eos> A kill is something you must fashion.<eos> Whether man against man, or within a shield wall.<eos> Anything below the knee is vulnerable.<eos> A strike to the ankle won't kill you, but it'll open the door.
They were really good.<eos> Cool.<eos> Um, how about you?<eos> How was your day?<eos> Yeah, it was a pretty normal day.
It's amazing.<eos> All right.<eos> It tastes like feet.<eos> You're crazy!<eos> Ah, it's disgusting.
Yeah, that's probably a good rule.<eos> So how'd it go with Linda?<eos> Was it a tough breakup?<eos> I tried to break up with her, but she made me this fantastic stew.<eos> It tasted so good, I just couldn't do it.
-You want to go grab?<eos> -Yeah, sure.<eos> Cool.<eos> So how's the new gig?<eos> Yeah, it's good, it's cool.
All of it!<eos> One day you may be King.<eos> I hope so with all my heart.<eos> And yet, I know its burdens.<eos> They're very real, like forever dragging a stone up a hill, only to watch it perpetually roll back down again.
Give us a hand with the ladder!<eos> Get the buckets for Gilbert!<eos> Oh, no!<eos> - Where's the fire wagon? ! - Boys, let's go, let's go!<eos> It's on its way!
You know, this was one of my favorite creatures in the world.<eos> And you go, "Well, if it's happening to one of my favorite creatures, what else is it happening to?"<eos> And that's when I realized one of the biggest issues with the ocean is it is completely out of sight and out of mind, and that, essentially, is an advertising issue.<eos> You know, when you look at our planet, it's unique in the known universe because we've got an ocean that is the source of life.<eos> And it controls everything.
I thought polyp was an animal... not a coral was an animal with lots of polyps.<eos> -That make sense?<eos> -A coral is an animal with lots of polyps.<eos> But the polyp isn't an animal?<eos> Well... it's part of the animal.
Opening ceremony was the most heartbreaking day... in sports history.<eos> - Hi, Bryan.<eos> - The story just broke.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> Is it published or not?
LA may be a lot safer than Mother Russia, given the recent...<eos> - Bryan!<eos> - Yeah?<eos> Article is incredible.<eos> It's so very good.
Great.<eos> Almost done for today.<eos> Good session, Sam.<eos> I can see your bra.<eos> It's purple.
What was the effect?<eos> They told us the world was ending in a potential war zone... what did we assume was going to happen?<eos> - World War Three.<eos> - But it didn't.<eos> The trick with misdirection... don't look where the arrow is pointing, look where it's pointing away from.
Er... 6,000.<eos> How many have reached stage two?<eos> You cannot accept their offer.<eos> Why not?<eos> Because whatever the price is, it's too high.
What's up?<eos> I think the purpose of Connor's assault was to ensure that this warehouse was left wholly unguarded on a particular night five years ago.<eos> We're gonna go discern why.<eos> There a... reason you've got a totem pole in your bathroom?<eos> It's too big for the closet.
You comin'?<eos> So, how long have you been sick, Jack?<eos> The red lesion behind your right ear, it's a marker for basal cell carcinoma.<eos> Skin cancer.<eos> Doesn't look like you've been treating it, either.
Terrell holds his meetings here because it's across the street from the place. Shoreline 99 does control.<eos> Is it just me, Detective Bell, or do you hear that?<eos> Hear.. what?<eos> The sound of evidence being destroyed?<eos> It's coming from inside that building.
So when our leader, Terrell, said he had a way to get out, we was, like, â€œYeah.â€<eos> The syrup heist was his idea?<eos> No, a friend of his.<eos> This guy, you know, he had all the details figured out.<eos> Knew where to get the syrup, how to get the boats, where to bring it once it was on shore.
What's all this?<eos> I'm, reexamining the paperwork on the Connor Brunelle assault. Why?<eos> Jack Brunelle is in jail.<eos> We know that Frank Trimble assaulted his son, but the statute of limitations has expired. It's over.<eos> And yet I find myself drawn to this case for the uniquely challenging foe it presents.

I handled you.<eos> I broke your curse...<eos> the one you gave to Regina that started this whole mess.<eos> Well, that's just the thing, Miss Swan... the curse, that dark curse.<eos> It and all of the darkness you've ever faced, was borne out of one twisted soul... the Black Fairy.
Ooh!<eos> Maybe a Porsche.<eos> You've got to be kidding me.<eos> Lamborghini will do.<eos> How about I drive the sports car of your choice over your miserable little head until it squishes like a pumpkin?
We must free our people!<eos> [Shiro] All right, team, let's take that thing down!<eos> Form shield!<eos> Let's see how tough this magic cube is.<eos> Did it just absorb our lasers?
-Yeah. Wait.<eos> -How am I hearing you?<eos> -That's not important right now.<eos> We need to get your lion back up and running.<eos> I think we can heal your lion's body, but you must bond with its spirit if it is to fly again.
No, that's an old person virus, and I'm not old.<eos> I'm young. Well, young-ish.<eos> What are the slipperies?<eos> It's a common Altean virus that occurs later in life.<eos> It's not harmful and usually only lasts a couple of days, but it causes one's body to secrete extremely slick fluid.
The Galra just destroyed our ship's engines and left.<eos> -So the Galra were here. Lance.<eos> -Mmm.<eos> They've taken everything.<eos> We must get everyone off the planet before it dissolves completely!
Based on the coordinates that Ulaz gave us, we should be there within a few doboshes.<eos> I can't wait to see it!<eos> I mean, they were able to fold space-time, and that was just at an outpost!<eos> -Mm, the space taco.<eos> It left us too soon. -[stomach grumbles]
It's two black holes and a giant blue star.<eos> [Hunk] That's not better.<eos> No kidding. Just inside a black hole, the temperature is one millionth of a degree above absolute zero.<eos> But, just outside of that, it's hundreds of millions of degrees Celsius.<eos> Okay, it's like when you try to nuke a frozen burrito in the microwave, and it comes out all scorching hot on the outside, but it's still frozen in the middle, right?
Hey, Coran! I'm off to eat some planets.<eos> There's one now!<eos> -Nyum, nyum, nyum, nyum, nyum! -We'll see you soon!<eos> As you probably remember from school, the weblum is an enormous creature and an integral part of keeping our universe functioning.<eos> It survives off of the-- ...left over from dead planets.

[Coran] Stop hitting the teludav!<eos> [Coran] Princess, there's something I've been meaning to talk to you about.<eos> What is it, Coran?<eos> This plan of ours, it's...<eos> Well, it's dangerous, you know?
And then they sit on this cave full of cars.<eos> The underside actually becomes the front door of the homes of people arriving so we made the underside very, very colorful.<eos> Whenever we design homes, What would I think would be amazing?<eos> And I think in this case, it's almost like realizing a dream that an apartment block doesn't have to look like a big, boxy slab.<eos> It could be like this sort of man-made mountain.
The elevator arrives there so that when you come out, you have almost like a flat area here. And then you sort of... Then you just take off.<eos> I think a project like this can be sort of a beacon in showing the world... clean tech presents almost utopian possibilities.<eos> And I think the Steam Ring is a powerful symbol of exactly that.<eos> The chimney, instead of being a symbol of pollution, it becomes a celebration.<eos> We've worked with Realities United to design the chimney so that it puffs rings of steam.
That particular craft...<eos> There were some problems with...<eos> Number one, getting it onto the flatbed to take it up to Area 51.<eos> The interior craft was, uh...<eos> It didn't have any actual levers or flight control systems that we would identify as a flight control system.
- Yeah.<eos> You are the right hand of the future King of England.<eos> You stand, literally, to symbolize that.<eos> So, yes, you do have a place.<eos> And it means so much.
I don't.<eos> I need five minutes with this.<eos> - Open or closed? - Closed.<eos> Am I good with that statement?<eos> I marked it up. It's on my desk.
They want to wake up in the America that they fell asleep in.<eos> Dig deeper on the Kalabi lead. See if you can connect Underwood to it.<eos> So, this is the James S.

You don't over-think anything. Aww.<eos> Oh, you've made me the happiest man in the world.<eos> I don't know how to say this without sounding superficial, but I need a closer look at this ring.<eos> Yeah, sit down, sit down.<eos> It was my grandmother's.
It was a trap.<eos> Get the spy.<eos> I will end this firefight.<eos> Uh, everyone, the gravity generator won't maintain power much longer.<eos> If it goes down, we're just going to be uncloaked in open space.
-It was magic.<eos> -It must have been the komar.<eos> Zarkon has been trying to develop a device to extract the quintessence from planets.<eos> It appears he succeeded.<eos> [Coran] If it destroys planets, what did it do to the paladins?
Just let it pass.<eos> There's another way.<eos> We can choose to make my information public.<eos> I have a sizable nest egg.<eos> It wouldn't last forever but if we wanted we could destroy Westmorland and Neolution.
Drinking seawater makes people hallucinate.<eos> Haven't you ever read "Rime of the Ancient Mariner"?<eos> Sir.

Your arsonist was driving a fully-restored, vintage Ford Mustang, model year 1965, '66, '67 or '68.<eos> Color unknown.<eos> How can you know that?<eos> You say in your report you found a charred wastebasket inside.<eos> You thought it was used to splash petrol around the office.

Emmanuel Chiang and Steven Tucker have the highest point totals and will be headed to the final level.<eos> Before the action starts, let's check in with our two finalists.<eos> I'm not having any doubts.<eos> I'm going to go and give it my all.<eos> Strength, to me, is what you can do with your body, not necessarily how it looks.
My name is Roberto Perez.<eos> I'd like to honor my country's name and show everyone that Mexicans are great athletes.<eos> I've been practicing Olympic gymnastics for a while.<eos> Then I started to climb.<eos> I love what this sport gives me, because it's highly physically and mentally challenging.
She's here to make sure I don't beat you too soundly if you lie to me again.<eos> You sound confused.<eos> I'd be happy to set you straight, but I don't have any openings in my schedule today, ladies.<eos> Call for an appointment next time.<eos> Tom Saunders knew about a Venezuelan bombing three years before it happened.
Wish you could see his face when we confront him with this.<eos> Where is he being held?<eos> Good to see you, Holmes.<eos> Scheduled an exorcism?<eos> Is it for you or me?
No one's performing.<eos> She's just very open, very raw.<eos> So let's scan it and give it to Bob.<eos> The drum scanner I have was built by NASA in the '80s.<eos> It does something beautiful to the grain that you just can't get with other scanners.
-[colleague] Yeah.<eos> They can use that space to encourage and give sort of behavioral cues to people to eat more healthily, especially kids.<eos> Although it sounds like the hot dog is something that will be hung on to.<eos> Maybe that's okay.<eos> It just needs to be sort of framed in a different language, not advertised...
This is actually one year from when they started, still here.<eos> It's kind of nice.<eos> [Ilse] It's great to see it in the store.<eos> Looking at materials that we could work with, we came to love cork.<eos> Because it's very abundant, utterly sustainable, there's no waste.
I am still mystified by how something like that really resonates in culture.<eos> I mean, it predated Star Wars.<eos> So we must have hit a zeitgeist that was about to happen.<eos> But when I die, it will say, "Designed the Boston cover,"<eos> and I've lived with this horror ever since, and I think it may wind up being true.
-She hugs me.<eos> -Hugs you and she jumps on me.<eos> And she jumps and bites him.<eos> I learned how to pronounce Seymour's last name in school.<eos> I thought it was funny. I thought it was a funny-sounding name.
Yet, when I was working at CBS Records in the '70s, women in the design business at that time were agents, they were reps.<eos> You'd sit there and think, "Oh, my God, what are they going to do with me? What am I going to do with them?"<eos> It's quite wild when you see it firsthand.<eos> All of a sudden, you turn around and you go, "Oh, my God, that was sexism!"<eos> You know, there it is. And it's like any other -ism.
I mean, a l-- like, a lot of films.<eos> I mean, and is it possible that every single one of those films is bad?<eos> It's like when you have the idea for a movie, Devon, it's, like, in your mind.<eos> It's huge. It's like-- It's like the whole world's like your whole soul.<eos> And then you make the movie... and suddenly it's compared to every other movie that's ever been made, and something that was so big... becomes, like... like the tiniest Russian nesting column... like... a piece of sand.
And he told me this story about a man who was killed robbing a liquor store, about how that man's sibling then came gunning for the fellow robbers who he blamed.<eos> I don't know anything about that.<eos> Well, I believe that you don't, but the problem is I know about it.<eos> Now, all of those details were borrowed from an incident which took place in 2012.<eos> It made the headlines because both the liquor store owner and the surviving robber were both charged with murder at the same time.
It's obvious that I only cause problems for you.<eos> Since I left, everything's gone so well for you.<eos> Are you going to pretend that nothing happened?<eos> -That kiss was a mistake.<eos> -No, it wasn't, Alba.
-Is there any left?<eos> Do you like brandy?<eos> Are you asking because I'm a woman or because you want the rest?<eos> No, I don't even like it, but I've had a bad day.<eos> Looking at you, I'd say it was horrific.

[Kasdan] He went off into the desert, and made an extraordinarily fun, swashbuckling adventure, a film that had a huge impact on Raiders of the Lost Ark, and a hundred other movies.<eos> But it is the opposite of Paths of Glory.<eos> It makes war look like fun.<eos> [narrator] Stevens later said of the film,<eos> "It celebrates the rumbling of the drums and the waving of the flags.
Thousands upon thousands of Italian and German troops lay down their arms and surrender.<eos> The battle of North Africa, which has cost the Axis some 400,000 men in dead, wounded and prisoners, is over.<eos> The victory is won, and now the victorious Allied leaders look eagerly across the Mediterranean to the shores of Hitler's fortress Europe.<eos> [narrator] As Frank Capra continued to work on the Why We Fight films, his ambitions were growing.<eos> Capra's first installment had been an instant hit with the new Army recruits it was made for.
He was now working closely with director Anatole Litvak on the fifth and greatest of the Why We Fight films:<eos> The Battle of Russia.<eos> While Capra and Litvak worked on the film, the Red Army started pushing back the Nazis at Stalingrad, in one of the costliest battles of the war.<eos> [man] For the first time since the mighty German Army started its career of blitz, smashing into submission one European country after the other, that same German Army came up against a country... that did not submit.<eos> [narrator] Though it had been made as a training film, The Battle of Russia was so well-regarded that Capra received permission to release it theatrically.
And finally, we got down to colonels.<eos> And so they went, one after the other, until I was alone.<eos> I thought, "What assholes."<eos> The Army didn't like the picture at all.<eos> The reason was they thought it would demoralize troops, demoralize men who had never been in combat.
So much of his cinema was as much about the ear as it was about the eye.<eos> The performances and just the beautiful words that were written for Wyler to direct actors to speak.<eos> [narrator] Wyler returned to Hollywood, but he believed that his directing career was over.<eos> [Kasdan] After the liberation of Paris, Stevens and others thought the war was near ending.<eos> But, in truth, it wasn't nearly done.
I've made pictures for over 40 years.<eos> There was one that was particularly close to me because it was done right after the war.<eos> Most of the films are fictional, you know, are fictional stories, and didn't really involve me.<eos> But since I was in the service during the war, right after the war, I made a film called The Best Years of Our Lives.<eos> [applause] That film gave me a great deal of satisfaction because it contributed something to the social life of the time.
You're not going to work right away.<eos> You ought to rest a while, take a vacation.<eos> I have to make money.<eos> Last year, it was "kill Japs" and this year, it's "make money."<eos> [Spielberg] In effect, when they come home, they're still fighting the internal war, and that internal war is something that haunts them, it haunts their dreams, it haunts their waking hours, it haunts the choices they make,

Yeah, or maybe getting some of them out of my system.<eos> [Spielberg] And I watch The Best Years of Our Lives at least once a year.<eos> I don't think a year has gone by over the last 30 years that I haven't watched that film once a year, and try to bring people to see it for the first time, so I can relive it through their eyes.<eos> [narrator] Wyler's movie was praised as a masterpiece of American social realism.<eos> It won rave reviews and became the second-highest grossing film in history.

Just under half, if you go by the continuity.<eos> Half.<eos> This could be our biggest hit ever.<eos> Your movie.<eos> But in this shape, it'll die.

This is Dave.<eos> He tells dirty jokes for a living.<eos> That stare is where most of his hard work happens.<eos> It signifies a profound train of thought, the alchemist's fire that transforms fear and tragedy into levity and livelihood.
No, allow me, Mr. Brimmer.<eos> We do compensate our writers, better than any other shop in town.<eos> Right?<eos> No?<eos> See, my problem with you is, a walkout wouldn't cost you a dime, but it would hurt their careers immeasurably and shut down this lot.

And it sounds so weird to talk about myself like that because, as a cam model, I've become very much paid for my time.<eos> I'm excited.<eos> I got my passport, you know. I'm all ready to go.<eos> It needs some Australia stamps in it.<eos> [chuckling] It's so lonely.

Better.<eos> I found years of annual reports of Fred Kirby's time on the board of NYOOPI.<eos> Why would you want that?<eos> Because I hope to find evidence of embezzlement or fraud.<eos> Let's see how many people pay for that preposterous silver star when it becomes a mark of corruption.
"It was Pat's baby." It's irritating as hell.<eos> My intention was to give you the credit.<eos> See what it cost us, this little stunt your writers pulled by walking out?<eos> An embarrassment to the whole studio.<eos> It wasn't little, and it wasn't a stunt.

ACTUALLY, IT IS MAKING A TURN.<eos> NOW, IT IS TURNING AROUND.<eos> OH, DEAR, I AM SURROUNDED.<eos> Rafa, did I leave the monitor there?<eos> Is it there?
Not helpful.<eos> Fine.<eos> Let's investigate this problem scientifically, starting with what we observed.<eos> Jordan, a very nice, very cool, very real, and very alive-seeming human being.<eos> Further evidence of which, I touched her arm, and it didn't fall off.
There are leaves, twigs, muddy tires.<eos> This car had been into a swampy area, unquestionable.<eos> The car had been into swampy, muddy ground.<eos> And why is that car found with its rear end sticking out in the street right adjacent to the Carriage House Apartments, where the nun lived?<eos> Whoever put that car there wanted it to be found.
I was probably the last one to see her.<eos> This is the exact parking lot where her car was found.<eos> Once we converged here and met here, we contacted the state police.<eos> They responded rather rapidly, secured the area and told us, you know, "Hey, don't go in, don't touch nothing."<eos> The car is parked just the same as we're parked right now, and it was unlocked, and the keys were in the ignition.
I mean... I...<eos> I just forgot about it.<eos> Debbie's aunt gave us the... The necklace, told us to hold on to it.<eos> I looked at the stone and as...<eos> As you can see it's a light, light green, which is an August birthstone.
But also to tell you I would really like my letter, and I understand that's evidence, and if I'm not even allowed to touch it, could we...?<eos> Could I just look at it?<eos> Could I read it?<eos> They said they can't find it. It must have been lost.<eos> It existed.
Could I read it?<eos> They said they can't find it. It must have been lost.<eos> It existed.<eos> There's no doubt it existed.<eos> There's no doubt it was given to the police.
There's no doubt it was given to the police.<eos> There's no doubt the police had it. Where is it?<eos> Marilyn Cesnik, who's Cathy's sister, said that she received a letter after Cathy went missing.<eos> Yes.<eos> Could it have had a clue about what engagement present she had bought her?
Yeah, well, I know about the letter.<eos> I have information about the letter, that there was a letter received by her sister afterwards.<eos> But as far as I know, the letter isn't a part of the evidence anymore.<eos> The city would have had possession of that, and we've never seen it.<eos> So, what you're saying, I think, Robin, is that you know that it wasn't...

I knew it was gonna get a laugh when I said:<eos> "She's obsessed with squirrels, and she's kind of gotten me into it, too."<eos> But you just keep going to that main joke.<eos> That's a throwaway joke.<eos> It makes it extra cool.
They do that a few times.<eos> Then they go in close and they shoot, like, a tight shot where it's just, like... You only see, like, three of the characters.<eos> And when they exit that scene, like, in our minds we see the whole room because we've seen it before.<eos> But in reality, when they're shooting it, the rest of the room isn't even there.<eos> It's, like, filled up with, like, reflecting boards and cameras and lights and, you know, all this other shit, you know.
And my dad has no boundaries.<eos> I don't know if he flipped through these at all or didn't.<eos> Um, but it was Truly Tasteless Jokes book one and two.<eos> And I remember the first joke on the first page.<eos> It was a paragraph long, but I can tell it in two seconds.
And I was going to go, like, "Oh, fuck this." But I stayed.<eos> He looks down my throat, and he's like:<eos> "We're going to the emergency room."<eos> I had a... Like an abscess at the top of my... windpipe, which is where your breathing comes from.<eos> So, um, like, this abscess was either gonna grow another millimeter and stop my breathing and I would die, or it was gonna explode, and it's filled with poison, and that would kill me.
Don't worry, we're keeping an eye on him.<eos> Whoa, I just saw up your nose.<eos> Wait, okay, show me Raven again.<eos> You guys, look at his tail.<eos> It's braided.
Don't give us evils just because you got totally owned by Pony Squad.<eos> Well, Becky, you wanted to catch Ghost Pony, and instead you caught a horse thief.<eos> I don't know what I was thinking.<eos> You can't catch a ghost with a net.<eos> It'd go right through it.
Do you remember?<eos> That's really private.<eos> No, I don't.<eos> I can't remember that.<eos> It was probably a store-bought trick.
- Perfect. - [chuckles]<eos> - I can't let you rent that.<eos> - Is it reserved?<eos> I have a moral obligation to prevent any further decay of romantic expectations provided by the fallacy perpetuated by Hollywood romantic comedies.<eos> Also, it's very derivative of Annie Hall.
Not anymore.<eos> I think maybe it's time to start picking out your own clothes.<eos> But... how?<eos> There are so many clothes. And different colors and patterns and sizes.<eos> This shirt is called "fog gray," but fog isn't even a color... it's translucent.
No, we're gonna kill him.<eos> Chapter eight... photosynthesis.<eos> Who's excited?<eos> You guys all read this last night in your...<eos> When a lobster gets too large for its shell, it molts.
Is Mr. Bojangles here?<eos> - Hey, George.<eos> - Hello, Ex-President Reagan.<eos> You know, George, chopping wood is an art form.<eos> Hit the log in the right spot and it cracks open, like dry human bones on a hot summer day.
- No, Neil.<eos> Don't you get it?<eos> - What?<eos> My dick is all thumbs!<eos> It's got two left feet! It canâ€™t walk and chew gum at the same time!
'Cause spirit doesn't pay the rent!<eos> And spirit doesn't put food in your belly, or a shirt on your back.<eos> And spirit doesn't help you from feeling lost... and unloved.<eos> Spirit of Camp Firewood is a nice idea, but it's not real.<eos> And it never was.
And spirit doesn't put food in your belly, or a shirt on your back.<eos> And spirit doesn't help you from feeling lost... and unloved.<eos> Spirit of Camp Firewood is a nice idea, but it's not real.<eos> And it never was.<eos> And it never will be.
The totem!<eos> The spirit of Camp Firewood!<eos> It's real!<eos> That's what I've been trying to tell you all along.<eos> - It feeds off of our love. - Oh!
No, he's not.<eos> He's a vampire. And he's not been waiting here for hundreds of years, have you?<eos> I don't like your tone, Belmont.<eos> This place is old, but it's not been abandoned.<eos> It's alive and working.
Do you have a history with him?<eos> I simply don't like him.<eos> I was disgusted by his debut novel.<eos> Really?<eos> If you say so, then it must have been horrendous.
I don't mean to be rude but none of you could write a novel like this.<eos> How about it, everyone?<eos> Shall we meet again after reading this novel?<eos> If you insist so strongly, Mr. Chiba.<eos> But even if this is a novel that none of us could write, if it's not interesting, he won't get the prize.
THE CURSED HOUSE!<eos> THE OWNER IS THE SON OF A CONDEMNED CRIMINAL TATSUYUKI MICHIMA.<eos> THE CURSED HOUSE!<eos> The currently popular novel, Drifting Emotions, authored by the novelist, Shin Michima, who Nanaka lived with, is predicted to sell over one million copies.<eos> It has received the Japan Outstanding Literature Prize, after all.
[Keith] So, did the crew abandon ship?<eos> I don't know, but they couldn't have gotten far without their spacesu-- [screams]<eos> Those aren't empty!<eos> We located the second comet based on King Alfor's information.<eos> We managed to get it aboard, but it seems to be causing massive disturbances.
[Lotor] If Voltron disappears from our world, then we win.<eos> If they make it out with the comet, we'll take it from them.<eos> It's a win either way.<eos> [Pidge] This is the comet Commodore Trayling must've been talking about in his transmission.<eos> It seems to be caught between two realities, just like the ship.
-So, what changed?<eos> -The hoktril.<eos> Our civilization's most advanced technological achievement.<eos> [Lance] What does that do?<eos> It saps the fighting force from our enemies.
I'm gonna get to work on that right after we find Lotor.<eos> Hey, can we fire this up and see if it works?<eos> Maybe we didn't adjust the polarity correctly.<eos> -[grunts] -[whirring] [electronic beeping, dinging] Uh, guys!<eos> Guys, I found the comet, but it's booking it away from us!
Oh, I'm sorry.<eos> Go ahead, Shiro.<eos> We need to get that comet.<eos> They must be transporting it into that base.<eos> It'll be vulnerable during the transfer.
You just escaped from a Galra ship, and now you're talking about breaking back onto one?<eos> You're crazier than me.<eos> And I volunteered to live on an ice planet for five years.<eos> Is it possible or not?<eos> The cruiser is currently within range, but it's gonna make a jump to hyper-drive any time now.
Before all of this.<eos> That he's dead? Or that we have to go back?<eos> Both.<eos> It was a dream that I had that brought us here, remember?<eos> And it turned out to be true.
We haven't prepared.<eos> We can manage it.<eos> That's not all I mean.<eos> I'm not prepared.<eos> This path that he's on, I don't know where it leads, except that his enemies will be there.
Thank you.<eos> This bird is no good.<eos> I tell you, no good!<eos> The priest won't accept it.<eos> It's flawed.
Huh?<eos> - Do you want it?<eos> Anything else?<eos> It's no good, you know.<eos> - It can fly.
I control it by surrendering control?<eos> That doesn't make any sense.<eos> Not everything does.<eos> Not everything has to.<eos> Your intellect has taken you far in life... But it will take you no further.
From what?<eos> Other dimensional beings that threaten our universe.<eos> Like Dormammu.<eos> Where did you learn that name?<eos> I just read it in the book of Cagliostro.
Strange!<eos> You're okay.<eos> A relative term. But yeah, I'm okay.<eos> The cloak of levitation.<eos> It came to you.
A relative term. But yeah, I'm okay.<eos> The cloak of levitation.<eos> It came to you.<eos> No minor feat.<eos> It's a fickle thing.
Come on, move!<eos> - Hurry!<eos> - That's the express train!<eos> And it's not stopping!<eos> It's coming!
Room full of nightmares.<eos> Not going in there.<eos> I don't understand how I get wrapped up in this stuff.<eos> I had a good job at the MTA.<eos> Was it perfect?
Who ordered pancakes?<eos> Meg, I'm not ready to be alone.<eos> I'm not.<eos> I don't know how to reset my router.<eos> I don't even know where it is. I don't even really know what, exactly, it does.
You look great.<eos> - Are you finished, ma'am?<eos> - Yes, thank you.<eos> - How did you like your swordfish?<eos> - It was good.
- Call me Roberto, please.<eos> Well, I love being on a first-name basis with a gentleman.<eos> Come on.<eos> I love this park.<eos> It's my playground.
The headpiece like this.<eos> - You sure about that?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> Kathy, I really love your engagement ring.<eos> It is so special to me.
- You sure about that?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> Kathy, I really love your engagement ring.<eos> It is so special to me.<eos> It's been in Bob's family for over 100 years.
I had a Liam Neeson nightmare.<eos> I dreamt I kidnapped his daughter and he just wasn't having it.<eos> Hey, they've made three of those movies.<eos> At some point you have to wonder if he's just a bad parent.<eos> The worst part about cancer isn't what it does to you... but what it does to the people you love.
I've merely raised your stress levels high enough to trigger a mutation.<eos> You sadistic fuck!<eos> I've cured you, Wade.<eos> Now your mutated cells can heal anything.<eos> It's attacking your cancer as fast as it can form.
Sofia.<eos> What happened to you yesterday?<eos> You okay?<eos> Yeah. Yeah. I'm so sorry that I ran out on you like that.<eos> My head just, um... It felt like it was going to explode.
Are they doing construction out on the forest?<eos> - Cut right to the chase.<eos> - Help me fill in the blanks, please.<eos> You should have seen this town in its day.<eos> Now it's dying by decades.
- Help me fill in the blanks, please.<eos> You should have seen this town in its day.<eos> Now it's dying by decades.<eos> Year by year.<eos> It's shrinking like the skin on my bones.
- Jules, I've already seen this video. I'm still trying to forget it.<eos> Please, watch it again.<eos> What am I looking for here?<eos> The walls were already bloody before the attack.<eos> The room, it doesn't look right.
The second largest penis hunt in the state history.<eos> The man was Korean, so you better believe it took a long time to find.<eos> JARED: You're stereotyping Korean dicks.<eos> That's racist. I've seen Korean dicks bigger than you.<eos> Okay, after finding it, the guy brought it to me, and he said, "Do your due diligence in getting this dick where it's got to go. "
Are you not a super tool?<eos> You're not even Robbie Wheirdicht.<eos> You're Bob Stone!<eos> - (EXCLAIMS) I made that name up. - So what?<eos> - It's not real.
This talks about an intergalactic war.<eos> This concerns the whole universe.<eos> What about this one?<eos> Something about an enemy.<eos> It needs to be destroyed before it gets to us.
I mean, with your life.<eos> Did you have a plan?<eos> Yes, of course I did.<eos> And what was that?<eos> Well, I suppose it changed.
- I got you!<eos> Hold on! Hold on!<eos> - I can't hold on!<eos> My little glove!<eos> It's slipping off!
All right, well, that doesn't sound very real to me.<eos> Well, if it was real, I wouldn't have to invent it.<eos> I'm sorry, what's your name again?<eos> Tracey Hughes.<eos> And if you forget again, it's on all of the recent patents for Zenotek. You know what?
That's good enough, right there.<eos> You're going to do exactly what we ask of you.<eos> You got 10 times that amount strapped to your head.<eos> We can't open the vault.<eos> It's on a rotating time lock.
Dale, the boat's leaving!<eos> My crane's gonna take the goddamn derrick out.<eos> - It's coming down!<eos> - Get on the boat now!<eos> I gotta stop it or it's gonna kill us all.
- Come here!<eos> Hey!<eos> Where the hell you going?<eos> Just going up the trail.<eos> I can see where it ends from right here.
It's not safe.<eos> Stay away.<eos> Grandpa, did you take your pills today?<eos> The key to my gun cabinet, it was in the drawer.<eos> And now it's gone.
I remember that story.<eos> I also remember when you were a little child, Kolya, and your father and I took you hunting.<eos> You were 12, maybe 13 years old and you were so excited.<eos> And then we saw this buck and you raised the rifle, but the buck just looked at you, kept on grazing.<eos> It wasn't afraid.
We just got the Beretta deal.<eos> Get the fuck out of here.<eos> I swear to God.<eos> The Beretta deal was massive.<eos> It was 10 times bigger than anything we'd closed so far.
I've thought about it a lot.<eos> And I don't want you to walk away from this empty-handed.<eos> Cool.<eos> So I had Warren draft up a severance agreement.<eos> And I think it's pretty fair.
Once they reach the capital, nothing in the world can stop them.<eos> At a full gallop, it's two days to the capital.<eos> - There's no way we can catch them.<eos> - The wind is strong now.<eos> It blows from the north all day tomorrow.
- We need it to kill the queen.<eos> Once she is dead, The Tao Tei cannot function.<eos> Without her signal, their whole army will freeze.<eos> There is an underground canal here.<eos> Has it been breached?
Has it been breached?<eos> The Tao Tei should all be above ground.<eos> And the one we captured?<eos> We load it up. We feed him.<eos> And it will return to its queen. Good.
- He says you will live.<eos> We'll come back for him.<eos> They've broken through!<eos> Patience, William.<eos> And it will go to the Queen when it's done?
Geran, the work you do, the risks you take, entitle you to at least half of what we earn together.<eos> But the person you are, compared to the person I am, compels me to reject, to refuse what you ask for.<eos> It is a question of character, of refinement, of value, of virtue, of which you know nothing.<eos> Be comfortable in your place in life, Geran.<eos> It suits you well.
I want to understand.<eos> Fine.<eos> Algorithms make patterns, they don't break them.<eos> And this algo was designed to move in and out of hundreds of positions in fractions of seconds.<eos> Right. What it wasn't designed to do is consume large amounts of capital, accumulate leveraged positions or... Or hold a portfolio for any extended period of time.
I was just... I was just doin' my job.<eos> You know, I don't quit until the director tells me to.<eos> Your name is?<eos> My name is Lenny Libatino.<eos> It's... It's L-E-N-N-Y, not... Not the I-E.
No!<eos> No, it's not.<eos> Did Oogway teach you that little trick?<eos> Too bad.<eos> It only works on mortals.
Digger gets your take.<eos> (SIGHS)<eos> Look, Mr. Pescatore, I think it's a fabulous idea.<eos> Digger comes down here, takes over. We'll run Florida, we'll take over Cuba.<eos> But my take's gotta stay somewhere near where it is.
Not far.<eos> There's a hidden forest just up the Dorian River on the northwest side of the Sanctuary.<eos> They say they keep all their treasure there in that wood.<eos> Gold, silver, jewels, as far as the eye can see.<eos> If your mirror is shiny, it'll be in there somewhere.
You have got a plan?<eos> Aye.<eos> Is it any good?<eos> No.<eos> But it's simple.
Stay in my shadow.<eos> - Why?<eos> - Just do as I say.<eos> Hail, thou Great God Ra.<eos> Normally, when a bird lands on my boat, I kill it before it can shit.
Your other eye.<eos> I could steal it back for you, if you like.<eos> Don't test my patience, mortal.<eos> My name is not "mortal."<eos> What is it, then?
Father...<eos> I noticed the tower.<eos> Impressive.<eos> I built it for you.<eos> If it were any taller, it would be in my way.
Please.<eos> Would you like to see another magic trick?<eos> No.<eos> Yeah.<eos> It's called The Incredible... No. Disappearing...
You run out on these people, Goody, and you gonna be disappointing more than just them or me.<eos> Remember what you said to me when them Billy Yanks were kicking my sorry ass six ways to Sunday?<eos> - I remember. - Yeah?<eos> You asked me why I wanted to save a piece of rebel trash like you, and I told you the war was over.<eos> - But it ain't over, Sam.
What a pity.<eos> I'm not going to be in one shirt for 14 days.<eos> - Glutton! You have plenty of suits!<eos> You have my silk suit from Florence.<eos> - Yes, but I shortened it with the sword.
I did not know that I was destroying something.<eos> So those two unfortunate souls hid with me.<eos> This is a good material for an article.<eos> - Sure.<eos> I'll publish it in the morning.
This guy thinks retarded people get upset by aftershave. That's brilliant.<eos> How does that work, exactly?<eos> Is it, like, "Oh, no.<eos> The smell.<eos> I don't understand where it's coming from. Please, somebody help."
Hold on, hold on.<eos> Do you wanna just shit in your chair, maybe?<eos> Maybe.<eos> Ben.<eos> Ben, it's jammed.
- What's your last name?<eos> - Zorn.<eos> I know.<eos> Everyone thinks it's funny.<eos> It means "anger" in German.
But we enjoyed making the film, and especially with the director.<eos> The director was great, you see, and it made it much easier for us.<eos> United Artists said,<eos> "You ought to be able to make a good, quick, low-budget film with them,<eos> "as long as it's in the cinemas by July,
Which is why I think you can compare them in some ways, because the sheer volume of the invention.<eos> Hello again from Hullabaloo, London.<eos> Ladies and gentlemen, Mr Richard Lester.<eos> Richard, what do you think we could tell them about the new Beatles flick?<eos> Well, first of all, it's going to be different from the last one.
Hello again from Hullabaloo, London.<eos> Ladies and gentlemen, Mr Richard Lester.<eos> Richard, what do you think we could tell them about the new Beatles flick?<eos> Well, first of all, it's going to be different from the last one.<eos> It'll be in colour. It'll be a film that has a lot of plot, a lot of entertainment about it, and Ringo's in trouble again.
Let's get out of here.<eos> Mama?<eos> Yeah?<eos> Why is my name Hannah?<eos> Well, your name is very special because it is a palindrome.
Don't move!<eos> Hands up!<eos> Your attention.<eos> An official stamp belonging to the censor's office has been stolen.<eos> All shipment of articles will be suspended until it is recovered.
Though I dare say, you might learn something from it.<eos> The first hat I ever made.<eos> I thought I'd tossed it away long, long ago.<eos> He kept it.<eos> It's impossible for it to be here, and yet... here it is!
Oh, God.<eos> Now, you supposed to be little miss biology.<eos> Don't tell me you afraid of a dead frog.<eos> Get him, girl.<eos> Oh, God. It looks like it's throwing up - from its neck.
- Bye, Emma.<eos> Bye.<eos> Hey, Evan?<eos> Tell your Dad I put his pliers in the mailbox.<eos> It's not my Dad, but okay.
The law requiring us to return a slave back to his master, we must never obey.<eos> "Now, therefore, I, Abraham Lincoln, President of the United States, "by virtue of the power in me "vested by the Constitution and the laws,<eos> "and to cause the laws to be duly executed."<eos> JAMES: This war is a terrible tragedy for our nation.<eos> JOSEPH: That it is.
What's wrong with you?<eos> It's supposed to be a celebration.<eos> It's a celebration of your faith, not mine.<eos> Well, that's the virtue of wine.<eos> It doesn't discriminate.
I stayed away because I knew that as long as I was alive, Mu Bai would not ask you to marry him.<eos> Nor in your death.<eos> Such was his honor.<eos> You feigned your death for nothing.<eos> It wasn't feigned.
I was just getting ready to say, I know where there's a bridge for sale.<eos> I'll tell you this.<eos> It don't matter to me if it was the devil.<eos> It don't matter if the devil give credit.<eos> - Somebody got to give it.
But he got your name, though.<eos> One morning, Saint Peter was looking at his book, and he was marking it up for the Judgement, and he let me see your name.<eos> He got it in there under "M."<eos> He got Rose's name.<eos> I ain't seen it like I seen yours, but I know it's in there.
Rose, it's just that...<eos> Ain't nothing you can say, Troy.<eos> Ain't no explaining it.<eos> The fella that give me this quarter had a whole mess of 'em!<eos> I'm gonna keep this quarter till it stops shining.
The pathology report?<eos> Yes, that I tested positive for breast cancer.<eos> You do that? You send that in an email, really?<eos> No, I have your pathology report right here in front of me.<eos> It's negative.
Eleven o'clock, thank you very much.<eos> Okay, now we control her dating app.<eos> - He bought it.<eos> When you enter, you will trigger his alarm.<eos> I can silence it, but it will send him a signal.
I dinged my pelvis again.<eos> Tell me everything.<eos> Okay.<eos> So, right off the top, Bryce ordered a Nicoise salad but he asked for the tuna to be really well done.<eos> But if it's a quality piece of tuna, you don't wanna have it...
And fugu for the lady.<eos> Thank you, Ping.<eos> Fugu?<eos> The infamous pufferfish.<eos> When prepared incorrectly, it can lead to paralysis or even death.
I know a fair amount.<eos> That is very cool.<eos> You can touch the feathers if you want.<eos> Yeah, a lot of people don't know that. It was a demon.<eos> It's actually pronounced Quetzalcóatl.
It's making a real comeback.<eos> I'm not talking about hipster real estate trends.<eos> I'm talking about vengeance, Tattoo!<eos> Death is coming to Brooklyn.<eos> And it's got buck teeth and a cotton tail.
How does that song go again?<eos> They come from the North, right?<eos> Way up there in the mountains where few people have ever been.<eos> But sometimes, a dragon gets lost from its family and winds up very, very far from home.<eos> They say it lives in these very woods.
Except me.<eos> You saw a dragon?<eos> I sure did.<eos> I sure did.<eos> What'd it look like?
You saw a dragon?<eos> I sure did.<eos> I sure did.<eos> What'd it look like?<eos> Well, it was green.
Green all over.<eos> Except for his eyes.<eos> His eyes were red.<eos> Like hellfire.<eos> Before I could even blink, it rears back its head, opens its mighty jaw, and shoots out.
We need to call in a chopper, because this dragon can fly.<eos> A dragon?<eos> Jack, you dragged me all the way out here for a dragon?<eos> I don't know how to explain it, but he's telling the truth.<eos> It was here.
A dragon?<eos> Jack, you dragged me all the way out here for a dragon?<eos> I don't know how to explain it, but he's telling the truth.<eos> It was here.<eos> It's still in there.
No one ever saw that dragon again.<eos> And I never told another tale about it.<eos> I didn't have to.<eos> Not after that day.<eos> Folks looked high and low but, it was nowhere to be found.
END<eos> I think he had a heart attack.<eos> - We write a song.<eos> - We write a song.<eos> - It is called "boat". - "Boot".
It's Umbris.<eos> Well, at least he picked an empty planet this time.<eos> Yes, however, it is a volatile planet.<eos> Its core is made up of pure melluvium.<eos> Blowing it up will result in a chain reaction that will destroy the entire system.
Just returning from patrol.<eos> Copy that.<eos> Deactivating shield grid 24 A.<eos> Once inside, Ratchet and Clank will make their way through the Star Cracker chamber to the inner core.<eos> When Ratchet exposes the stabilizer, it can quickly be disconnected... Yes.
Now, when I'm done, I'mma come out clean and give myself to the law.<eos> Take me.<eos> Handcuff me to the bed.<eos> All right.<eos> Babe, put that baton down because if you break it, I'mma have to pay for it.
Because I'd love a wonton or two.<eos> It's not racist if I say it.<eos> Where are we going?<eos> First, you have to get to the north hallway.<eos> It leads to the other wing of the house.
Out the cab, Slim!<eos> Hurry up!<eos> Turn around!<eos> You know who this truck belong to?<eos> Yeah, it belong to me.
Go to the ship.<eos> Superman's probably there already.<eos> Perry, it's not for a story.<eos> Jenny, get her a chopper to Gotham.<eos> And forget the heliport. Put it on the goddamn roof.
If you had any left.<eos> I got one round left.<eos> The spear.<eos> Alfred, the spear. It's pure Kryptonite.<eos> It's back in Gotham.
Yeah, the Dutchman. He fixed it.<eos> - Fixed what? - He... Jerico!<eos> Jerico, what did the Dutchman fix?<eos> Heimdahl's first shot.<eos> Whatever it was, wherever he tried to send it... it comes back for him.
But the one you have to watch out for... Is the cuckoo bird.<eos> Do you know how the cuckoo bird survives?<eos> By preying on a mother's weakness.<eos> The cuckoo bird is too clever to raise its young.<eos> Instead, it sneaks... Its eggs into the nests of simpler birds.
I was told you were as well, Mr. Bouchard.<eos> So tell me:<eos> - What do you think he's doing?<eos> - What do you think you are doing?<eos> I brought you the pointer, and now it's gone.
Sienna.<eos> There are too many of us down here.<eos> You won't get to that bag before we do.<eos> No.<eos> But I can make sure it breaks.
Well, your mom has told me about what's been going on and I'm here to help, if I can.<eos> Would you like to talk about it?<eos> You know, when I was about your age, um, I was visiting my mom at a hospital and I saw an angel.<eos> Yeah.<eos> It was standing next to a little boy's bed.
Would you like to talk about it?<eos> You know, when I was about your age, um, I was visiting my mom at a hospital and I saw an angel.<eos> Yeah.<eos> It was standing next to a little boy's bed.<eos> It was just gently touching his cheek and then it stopped. And it looked right at me.
You know, when I was about your age, um, I was visiting my mom at a hospital and I saw an angel.<eos> Yeah.<eos> It was standing next to a little boy's bed.<eos> It was just gently touching his cheek and then it stopped. And it looked right at me.<eos> Of course, my mom and the nurses did not believe me, but I knew it was real.
"I was there at your first breath.<eos> "You didn't ask for me.<eos> "But I will follow you until your death."<eos> Your name.<eos> You didn't ask for it. It was given, when you were born.
You'll be out by 7:00, right?<eos> The first workers get here at 7:00.<eos> Yeah.<eos> What's the best truck you got on the lot?<eos> Well, it's supposed to be my 16th birthday present.
I missed you, too.<eos> They're a family.<eos> He was looking for his parents.<eos> I got the truck.<eos> It's stationary.
Please, Tribune.<eos> Gently. Gently.<eos> Come, Clavius, soak this day away.<eos> Fill his cup.<eos> Keep it filled.
I don't wish the mantle you wear.<eos> Spare me.<eos> It's your path, too.<eos> Your ambition is noticed.<eos> Where do you hope it will lead?
- Is that right?<eos> No, she never touched you.<eos> - Oh, really?<eos> Dude, that beautiful little beauty mark on her vag.<eos> It's, like, on the right side
Let's go!<eos> - Eddie, get back inside!<eos> - Eddie. - Eddie.<eos> - Matt, open the trunk right now!<eos> - The light says it's open.
It was just a dream.<eos> No, it felt real.<eos> I know.<eos> Your mind is the most powerful I've ever seen.<eos> It can convince itself...
- Give me the key. Okay.<eos> All right.<eos> All right. I'll let her out, okay?<eos> - Just let me get the key.<eos> - Where is it?
To stop an asteroid?<eos> The last two asteroids Fell exactly in the same spot.<eos> And it will happen again.<eos> We need to go there and see what attracts the asteroid.<eos> Once we know why it is coming We will find out how to send it to another place.
Once we know why it is coming We will find out how to send it to another place.<eos> This plan is so stupid that i wish it had a face i can smash!<eos> Let me get this straight.<eos> instead of running away from a deadly asteroid You want us to run directly towards it ?<eos> I know it sounds sub optimistic , but the good news It is that it will kill us anyway.
Indeed it is, Miss Crawly.<eos> Top of the morning to you.<eos> I made you some coffee.<eos> You did?<eos> Where is it?
Call MI6, see if we can get Micro Forensics to hurry this up.<eos> We need the whole team here in two hours or it's not worth it.<eos> I'm very sorry.<eos> In my culture... death is not the end.<eos> It's more of a stepping-off point.
Thank you, sir.<eos> "Consequences"?<eos> Secretary Ross wants you both prosecuted. Had to give him something.<eos> I'm not getting that shield back, am I?<eos> Technically, it's the government's property.
Yeah, it took the world 70 years to find Barnes... so you could probably do that in about half the time.<eos> You know where they are.<eos> I know someone who does.<eos> Not sure you understand the concept of a getaway car.<eos> It's low profile.
You did everything for them.<eos> So they'd love you.<eos> It was never enough.<eos> Maybe the gods found you for a reason.<eos> Maybe the ocean brought you to them... because it saw someone who was worthy of being saved.
- You will board my boat... - Goodbye, Moana. ...sail across the sea...<eos> I'm not killing myself... so you can prove you're something you're not!<eos> ...and restore the heart of Te Fiti!<eos> The ocean chose me!<eos> It chose wrong.
I've delivered us to where we are<eos> I have journeyed farther<eos> I am everything I've learned and more Still it calls me<eos> And the call isn't out there at all<eos> It's inside me
Okay, okay.<eos> Next time, use your shoe.<eos> I love this song.<eos> - This a Thai song? - Yeah.<eos> It's so good.
And today felt like jumping out of an airplane.<eos> Or like, you know, like having sex.<eos> Kim!<eos> Tanya's got scotch.<eos> It won't last long, so...
Don't fucking hide.<eos> Kim, you know the frog in the pot of water?<eos> You raise the temperature bit by bit, the frog doesn't notice?<eos> That's what this place and that's what this job does to all of us.<eos> It changes your perception of what's normal until until here we are.
I just found him over there.<eos> - It's okay, it's okay. - There you go.<eos> There we go.<eos> Yeah, it might be purulent.<eos> - It might be what?
But in a way, that cabin made us happy.<eos> No one could find us.<eos> Everyone thought we were dead.<eos> And if you were to run away today, right now, where would you go?<eos> I read once that when a train hits, it can rip the clothes right off of you.
My name is Sophie.<eos> Well, jump, Sophie.<eos> This be where all my dreams is beginning.<eos> Oh, my...<eos> As a dream comes whiffling by it's so silvery soft, it was making like a tiny little buzzing, humming sound, like music.
It's behind you on your elbow!<eos> No, not that elbow! The other one!<eos> Now it's on your foot!<eos> The other foot!<eos> It's on your bottom!
It be a trogglehumper.<eos> What are you going to do with it?<eos> I locks them up, you wicked beastie, you.<eos> What does the bad dream say?<eos> It says...
What is Sophie's dream?<eos> Your golden phizzwizard.<eos> I don't see much of them anymore.<eos> But what does it say?<eos> It tells a story of a little gal.
But in the end... she remembers the good deeds.<eos> Now, Sophie, I... I know... that story be your heart's desire.<eos> I knows it.<eos> The dream, it came to you, didn't it?<eos> It be Sophie's dream.
OK.<eos> So what's the plan?<eos> Over.<eos> There's a convoy pinned down by fire from a group of guerrillas just over the border.<eos> If everything goes well, it should be passing by your current location in about 52 hours, Sergeant.
I will not hear her name spoken again.<eos> Cassius, I share your outrage.<eos> Whatever has possessed you?<eos> If we don't act decisively... the war will be at your gate within a fortnight.<eos> And that is precisely where it will remain.
They protected you so that one day you could lead.<eos> Your mother left you a gift.<eos> Oh, that's very kind of you, but I have no use for jewelry.<eos> The ring is not the gift.<eos> It contains the gift:
Should we cower in the safety of these walls...<eos> - while he picks us off one by one?<eos> - Curb your insidious comments, Semira.<eos> This coven has held for 15 centuries.<eos> - It will hold for 15 more.
Ya know, here's a question:<eos> Somebody builds a safe in the back of a grocery store, right? Yeah.<eos> - And we found it.<eos> - Precisely.<eos> And we assume it's filled with money, or drugs or whatever... it's filled with stuff?
Guddu!<eos> Mum, I love you very much<eos> Guddu, I miss you very much<eos> The train on platform two is a decommissioned train<eos> It is not taking passengers
If Hawaii is something that we decide would be better for you, I'll go.<eos> Janine, how did the White House conversation go?<eos> I made it quite clear that we were in possession of an authentic FISA court order.<eos> They wanted to see it; we refused.<eos> Now I just pray that it's actually authentic.
Yeah, but it's such a blanket statement you don't like jazz.<eos> What are you doing right now?<eos> Nothing.<eos> I just think that people, when they say that they... you know, hate jazz, they just...<eos> They don't have context, they don't know where it comes from.
You know, jazz music that I know?<eos> - What about it?<eos> - From my life? - Mmm-hmm?<eos> - I just find it relaxing.<eos> It's not relaxing. It's not, it's not.
You know, I sure like talking to you.<eos> You are in so much more trouble than I thought.<eos> Hey, over here! Pass it!<eos> Travis: Is this seat taken?<eos> No, it is not.
I'm not burning your steak.<eos> We were lucky. The sheriff's retriever was a patient of mine.<eos> Travis would have spent the weekend in jail.<eos> But I never got the truck out of the bog.<eos> It's there to this day... Bullfrogs' motel.
No. Don't touch that.<eos> Why didn't you watch my movie? - Hey, goodbye.<eos> - Come and watch with me.<eos> - Have a great night. - Come on.<eos> It's still playing.
Thanks.<eos> I thought so.<eos> Why did you just throw cold coffee on me?<eos> I got it in the hallway.<eos> I thought it was hot.
Little guy, stringy hair.<eos> I think they went out through those doors.<eos> Hey, Chet?<eos> Hey, Chet.<eos> Amelia's film, where is it?
Repeat, it's in the projector.<eos> But we already checked that.<eos> - Spliced in.<eos> - What?<eos> It's spliced into the middle of it, right in the other film.
Jesus.<eos> Hello?<eos> Hello?<eos> It's me. I got a new car.<eos> You like it?
- It was Adams, of course.<eos> Yes, it was Adams.<eos> Murderous jealousy.<eos> He'd written a paper for the Royal Astronomical Society on the obliquity of the ecliptic.<eos> And then read another that seemed to surpass it.
Just a little crispy.<eos> Won't you sit down?<eos> That's what people really are, you know?<eos> Dust, waiting to be distributed.<eos> And it gets everywhere, doesn't it?
Always here.<eos> Always together.<eos> You have a magnificent brain, Moriarty.<eos> I admire it.<eos> I concede it may be even be the equal of my own.
No way!<eos> I won't do it anymore! Not ever!<eos> Not do what, goddammit?<eos> Is your body so precious?<eos> Does it wear out by screwing?
Which part does the sun rise from?<eos> Which part does it set?<eos> How far does the light fall?<eos> I want to see all that Uncle.<eos> A bird's offspring should not leave its nest... until it's ready to fly, Sarman.
Excuse me.<eos> Hello.<eos> A letter came for you.<eos> Turn on your video.<eos> It's from the drama school.
Because I have the four friends.<eos> They're green ninjas.<eos> Give us the ooze.<eos> Hi.<eos> Where'd it go?
We're on the move.<eos> We have to get above the exit!<eos> What, are you crazy?<eos> We can't be seen!<eos> That purple ooze is our only shot at being normal, and it's heading toward the front door.
The night Naz was arrested, he lost a lot.<eos> He lost his freedom to return home to his family, to his school, to his night job that helps pay for that school.<eos> But what he didn't lose, and what none of us can lose, were his Constitutional rights to an attorney, to a fair and impartial trial by you, his peers, and to the presumption of his innocence beyond a reasonable doubt.<eos> We hear that term a lot.<eos> But what does it really mean, huh?

Thank you.<eos> Hey, how's the Pop Music Award thing coming?<eos> Good.<eos> I've called producers. I'm waiting to hear back.<eos> Please stay on them because you know how important it is to him.
Come on.<eos> You know that.<eos> God.<eos> Can we talk about this helmet?<eos> It's crazy heavy, and it's really hurting my back.
Hands where I can see them!<eos> Transporting any weapons?<eos> No, what's the problem, bosmang?<eos> Show us your transponder.<eos> Says here it's expired.
- For a hat?<eos> - Yes!<eos> We do that when there is danger of if someone is very ill.<eos> A hat isn't someone.<eos> And it poses no danger.
- She's depressed.<eos> - Not pregnant?<eos> - She had an abortion. I don't believe you.<eos> Take off that silly hat!<eos> Whose is it, anyway?
It's a cursed hat.<eos> - Cursed?<eos> - Yes.<eos> On the contrary, this hat brings good luck.<eos> It's saved several lives.
- Cursed?<eos> - Yes.<eos> On the contrary, this hat brings good luck.<eos> It's saved several lives.<eos> You know whose it is?
Mittrand?<eos> He certainly might.<eos> Worse, Mittrand's the devil!<eos> If you would please pronounce his name correctly.<eos> It's Mitterrand.
And?<eos> I assume you've seen the initials inside?<eos> Yes.<eos> And so, unless I'm mistaken, it doesn't belong to you?<eos> I assume you know who it belongs to?
- Good evening, Mr President. Have a seat.<eos> - There's a reward.<eos> - I don't want it. Since you don't want the reward, let me tell you a secret.<eos> I lost this hat in Lyons.<eos> It's travelled a long way since.
I've been waiting to tell you.<eos> -No, you go first. -No, you first.<eos> Look at you.<eos> Where's your ring?<eos> It keeps falIing off.
I love you and I miss you.<eos> I love you and miss you so much.<eos> Me too, my love.<eos> I want a kiss.<eos> I told you her ring was too big, that it kept falling off. well, it fell off.
Listen. I think you're wrong about that.<eos> It's your choice to make, but I want you to understand something: That there's a lot of... hey.<eos> Pick up... what hap... what is that?<eos> You can't leave your fishing rod like that.<eos> I don't know why the hell it keeps dripping.
Uncle Lee, are you fundamentally unsound?<eos> Get in the fuckin' car.<eos> Can't obey your orders until you unlock the door.<eos> Shut up.<eos> It's not like the motor's gonna die tomorrow, but Joe said it keeps breaking' down like a son of a bitch.
He isn't going to stay here forever.<eos> And out there he needs you.<eos> It's time, Ser Davos.<eos> Open the door and the men inside can rejoin their brothers in peace.<eos> We'll even set the wolf free north of the Wall where it belongs.
Maybe "children"?<eos> Yes. "Mom and Dad" is clear.<eos> We know the bottle has been in the sea for a long time.<eos> The algae are at least six years old.<eos> The letter is written in tar, so maybe it was thrown from a boat?
Then here's your best option:<eos> a legal-aid lawyer.<eos> And here's what you get for your money.<eos> It's a guy who starts his day in court, fishing a half a dozen random case files out of a wire basket, meets with his clients for a half hour before going in front of the judge,<eos> takes the first deal off it, goes around the corner to Starbucks, comes back with his latte, opens up the next file, and does the exact same thing six times a day, every day.
And keep her and her people quiet. Okay?<eos> All right, let's go!<eos> I want access to every surveillance camera in the city.<eos> We'll do a grid search for that fucking triage van.<eos> It's out there somewhere.
Um, I'm sorry. Do you have a letter from your uncle?<eos> You talked about that.<eos> - The lawyer handed it to me with the deed.<eos> - Would you mind if I take a look at it?<eos> It's actually in my car.
I didn't have the honor.<eos> What did you think?<eos> Very well written... but it preaches to the converted.<eos> I don't think so.<eos> I dislike how it confuses radicalism and terrorism.
You're not strong enough, Bunny.<eos> What if it... kills you?<eos> Oh, then I shall die happy.<eos> Death has been my constant companion for almost 50 years.<eos> I've lived day to day never knowing if my body, if it'll succumb and my... my... my... my reason desert me.
The one and only.<eos> I need to find your daughter.<eos> She still carrying on about that ring?<eos> It ain't worth shit.<eos> Maybe it reminds her of better times... back in the day.
How convenient for you that I can't.<eos> Look, you texted me.<eos> What do you want?<eos> You see that van parked over there?<eos> I bet if you looked inside, it's filled with all of those Justin Hammer guns from the heist.
That's power.<eos> Did Luke really do all of that?<eos> You never really know what anyone is capable of.<eos> Go on, get some rest.<eos> You'll come back to the club in a few days when it opens.
Not seeing it bothered you, didn't it?<eos> 'Cause seeing is my thing, right?<eos> That's what made me such a good point guard.<eos> 'Cause I could see everything in my head.<eos> I knew exactly where people were gonna be, so I put the ball right where it needed to go.
She'll use that to close the deal. Hmm?<eos> We got a call.<eos> - Is it her?<eos> - No.<eos> It's from inside.
I'm done running.<eos> How many of these you own, brother?<eos> Looks like this place don't wanna be a barber shop anymore.<eos> Maybe not.<eos> But whatever it is, it's gonna be famous.
Do Mom and Kyle still have the wagon?<eos> Yeah, but there's something wrong with it.<eos> - What?<eos> - I don't remember.<eos> But it runs?
So what the fuck happened?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Well, that's exactly what you want to hear from your head of programming.<eos> We haven't finished the diagnostic yet.<eos> Clearly it's exhibiting some aberrant behavior.
He was. Is dead.<eos> By rumors has many crimes In the Federation of Arizona, He recently arrived in the northeast corridor.<eos> The reactor 12 has been turned off.<eos> He killed 28.<eos> Hidden by intelligence, it is in the death zone 714.
Stop the fire, stop the fire, Kix!<eos> That is an order!<eos> Where is the?<eos> Do we have eye contact?<eos> Negative, it's gone.
People do it all the time.<eos> They call, they make an appointment, they come in and lie on my couch.<eos> - Come and see for yourself.<eos> - I-I like this spot.<eos> It affords you a 360-degree view of your surroundings, and it's not patrolled by Boston cops.
Yes, it is. I'm getting my hat.<eos> Okay. Wait.<eos> You have a special wedding hat?<eos> It's just a little hat.<eos> It's only right for weddings.
- Do I need my boots? - Yep.<eos> 911 got a call about an explosion this morning.<eos> By the time the unit got here, jogger had found a finger.<eos> Where?<eos> It fell out of a tree right in front of him.
Did the uniforms find any other bombs<eos> - or bomb-making materials?<eos> - No, just a bag of carrots.<eos> Okay, well, I'll reach out to the bomb squad.<eos> They're gonna want to find the other pieces of the device, make sure it's fully detonated.
A Parisian getaway.<eos> - Good for you, Ma.<eos> - Yeah, well, I decided to seize the day.<eos> - And the hat.<eos> - Am I pulling it off?
You understand me?<eos> Thank you, Dr. BOGAN.<eos> Emily, come on, you're a good nurse and a good person.<eos> This was just a freak accident that will never, ever happen again, right?<eos> No. No, it won't.
All right.<eos> Bless us all.<eos> May the Lord protect us as we do his bidding.<eos> The demon inside her, it has access to all her memories.<eos> It will tell lies to hurt you, to piss you off.
Show our men where their loyalties belong.<eos> Show them what Lannisters are, what we do to our enemies.<eos> And take that stupid little castle back because it's ours and because you can.<eos> You'll stand trial soon. I need to be here for you.<eos> It will be a trial by combat.
Go on, Ser Davos.<eos> Your uncle, Lord Commander Mormont, made that man his steward.<eos> He chose Jon to be his successor because he knew he had the courage to do what was right, even if it meant giving his life.<eos> Because Jeor Mormont and Jon Snow both understood that the real war isn't between a few squabbling houses.<eos> It's between the living and the dead.
- Would you?<eos> - Look around.<eos> The city has come back to life.<eos> - You made a pact with fanatics.<eos> - I did and it worked.
Have a drink with me.<eos> And you?<eos> What's your excuse?<eos> I have tried wine before.<eos> It made me feel funny.
Let me assure you, these Demons are real.<eos> Not only did they kill the Chosen but also my aunt, Pyria.<eos> The Ellcrys will bear a seed.<eos> That seed must be carried by one of the Chosen to a place called Safehold.<eos> There it will be immersed in the Bloodfire.
The world is at a tipping point.<eos> Without you, all will be lost.<eos> Bremen...<eos> We need to find a door out of here.<eos> I think this is it.
And what if I don't want that?<eos> The choice is no longer yours to make.<eos> Without training, you won't stand a chance of surviving the Darkness that is about to descend.<eos> Pie?<eos> - It's actually pretty delicious...
Thanks, you're the best.<eos> You know what?<eos> You fire Rob.<eos> So how was the move out of the Springwood?<eos> Uh, you know, it's funny it didn't end up actually happening.
Well, I'm down.<eos> Off.<eos> I think I slept on something.<eos> Sword uncomfortable.<eos> The helmet, I know where it is.
It's making us look bad.<eos> Okay, how about this?<eos> We're trimming the fat, staying lean.<eos> The old roster had no coherence.<eos> It was a cornucopia of disparate sounds.
I'm delighted.<eos> Well...<eos> Wait.<eos> This letter came, it's for you.<eos> Is it for you?
- No.<eos> - Then give me the cup.<eos> So what are you going to do?<eos> You can still catch the 8:00 bus.<eos> It stops in the square.
How is it?<eos> Not too gamey?<eos> Overcooked.<eos> Try the other joint.<eos> It is much more tender.
Why are you doing this?<eos> I was there.<eos> Remember?<eos> When you first caught the Wayne case.<eos> I know what it means to you.
You'll tell me the way out?<eos> Yes.<eos> Okay.<eos> There's an elevator.<eos> I'll tell you where it is, but... can you pick a lock?
I don't know what problem you're trying to solve here.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> This is a stack of prime real estate in Manhattan. We can't charge rent on a jungle gym.<eos> My father didn't build the tallest skyscraper in the Northern Hemisphere for a little rent money.<eos> It's not the tallest skyscraper.
I just don't want to give you false hope.<eos> There's a possibility he's not coming back.<eos> Mom, Dad's still here.<eos> Can you give us a minute?<eos> You know how the cat's been acting funny? Well, that's because it's Dad.
[sighs]<eos> You can't escape, Titus!<eos> Has the train to Biloxi left yet?<eos> Nope.<eos> It's running two hours late.
Anything interesting? - No.<eos> - Really? - No, nothing.<eos> - It seems like maybe you do.<eos> - Yeah, I, there's this stupid movie. It's so stupid.<eos> - What's it called?
- Really? - No, nothing.<eos> - It seems like maybe you do.<eos> - Yeah, I, there's this stupid movie. It's so stupid.<eos> - What's it called?<eos> - It's called The Stones.
Randy: Yeah.<eos> Oh, my God. Well, we definitely have to see Julian.<eos> So, what do you think, Candy?<eos> What... I think we strip you fucking buck-naked, I strap you down on the fucking roof of my pussy-wagon and I drive around this park with your fucking little wiener swinging in the wind!<eos> And Randy, I fucking know it's small!
But it's not your decision, okay? It's done.<eos> If he's not here on Monday, I'm not going into makeup.<eos> Yes, you are because you are under contract.<eos> I'm 12. My contract means shit.<eos> It actually does mean shit, okay?
Well, then...<eos> Tom Quince.<eos> Are you ready?<eos> We need to wait for the stuff.<eos> It'll come and it'll all be OK.
- Where are you going?<eos> - I'm leaving.<eos> What are you going to do for a passport?<eos> I have a passport in the name of Thomas Quince.<eos> Where is it?
Nice meeting you again.<eos> I demand to be set free. Now.<eos> Now!<eos> Please drink.<eos> No, thank you. It may taste strange, even bitter, but it will help you adapt to the altitude.
That certainly helps explain Clementine, the host we retired.<eos> It seems yesterday's demonstration was a hoax designed by Ms. Cullen.<eos> - Was it?<eos> - I examined the code.<eos> It had been altered.
- Was it?<eos> - I examined the code.<eos> It had been altered.<eos> A clumsy set of fingerprints left by one of QA's technicians.<eos> When you find a cancer in an organization, you must cut it out before it can spread.
What do you get when you cross The Godfather with a lawyer?<eos> An offer you can't understand.<eos> Never heard that one.<eos> And believe me, I have nothing but the utmost respect for your profession.<eos> I mean, it's a pillar of...
That suit you're wearing... did you buy it off the rack?<eos> Please don't tell me it looks like I did.<eos> If it did, I wouldn't have asked.<eos> So why do you prefer a tailor-made suit?<eos> Because it fits you and you alone.
It's the bill for the seed.<eos> And one from Aunt Jocasta.<eos> Good, we haven't heard from her in months.<eos> Now, did ye get the ploughshare fixed?<eos> Smitty says it's broken straight through.
And I just... closed the door on that night, walked away... and I haven't looked back ever since, until now.<eos> Now I look at Ross and Kincaid and all the others being turned into soldiers, being trained, putting up a brave front.<eos> All I can hear is Max Lucas... crying out for his mother in the dead of night.<eos> And for two years... I've tried to stop this war from coming.<eos> Now that it's here, I'm not sure I'm ready to go to war again.
And get a musket ball between the eyes for their trouble.<eos> Not if he's prudent.<eos> And lucky.<eos> There's no other way about it.<eos> If the ground can support a man on horseback, it can support infantry.
Please be careful of the blood; the floor is slippery.<eos> I bring you the blessing and gratitude of my father.<eos> Your deeds today will be forever remembered.<eos> If this victory had been obtained over foreigners, my joy would be complete.<eos> But as it is over Englishmen, it brings a damp chill over my heart.
For me.<eos> Because that's what I wanna do.<eos> Got it?<eos> That's really smart.<eos> It's just, I had this big plan and it didn't work out.
Stay in touch.<eos> Hey Bobby! I wanted to tell you that I can't make it tonight.<eos> Something came up, its an emergency.<eos> I have to re-schedule.<eos> But I laid everything out. I opened the wine to let it breathe.
...people on the cliff.<eos> People are jumping.<eos> They got hurt and won't wake up.<eos> I saw his head go away.<eos> It just went away.
You can confirm that there's no presence of any pathogenic agents?<eos> No, mulder.<eos> I mean, there's nothing.<eos> Something's there.<eos> Some material appears apparent, but it's also not there.
You did the right thing, you fought global warming, you love all the little animals.<eos> Well, Friday come, Wednesday maybe, garbageman takes the trash away.<eos> It's not your problem anymore.<eos> Magic!<eos> But it is your problem, because it piles up in the landfill. And the plastics leak toxins into the water and the sky.
I want to believe that mothers have a greater purpose for all of us.<eos> I agree.<eos> A child is not a tool to spread hatred.<eos> But where does the hatred end, though?<eos> Maybe it ends where it began, by finding a common language again.
I don't think that's the mutation Sanjay was referring to.<eos> Did you find anything else on the autopsy?<eos> Well, there were no abnormalities in Dr. Sanjay's brain.<eos> The opener destroyed the acoustic nerve and then went into the cerebral cortex.<eos> It's weird, because the opener goes in at 90 degrees and then it veers off at 60 degrees up into his brain, like he was hunting for something.

It ended up in the auditory cortex.
I was going too fast. And there was an animal in the middle of the road.<eos> I-I panicked and I crashed.<eos> I thought I was gonna die.<eos> But that's when I heard the sound.<eos> It was so loud and piercing; it hurt.
- No, don't. - Who the fuck do you think you are?<eos> Just pop the trunk, honey.<eos> I got it.<eos> That's all right, I got that. That's fine.<eos> It's right underneath here.
That's all right, I got that. That's fine.<eos> It's right underneath here.<eos> There you go. Just right under there.<eos> Just got a lot of things in here.<eos> It's just right under there.
But even if you did, Kara, it wouldn't be this.<eos> Because this isn't real.<eos> And deep down, Kara. Deep down, you know it.<eos> (RUMBLING)<eos> I can't promise you a life without pain and loss because pain is a part of life. It's what makes us who we are.
Because this isn't real.<eos> And deep down, Kara. Deep down, you know it.<eos> (RUMBLING)<eos> I can't promise you a life without pain and loss because pain is a part of life. It's what makes us who we are.<eos> It is what makes you a hero.
I also need a warrant.<eos> You want me to write up a warrant?<eos> I'll write it up.<eos> You just have to attach your brag sheet,<eos> - get it to a friendly judge. - What's it for?
I'm sorry you got tazed, but it's on you, buddy.<eos> Joey Marks know how you treat the customers here?<eos> Joey who?<eos> He owns this shithole.<eos> Glitter Toe Entertainment owns this shithole, and I happen to like it.
A name keeps coming up as a possible witness. It turns out the name's an alias for a C.I. who was working for Majors.<eos> This guy was on keep-away status back then.<eos> We're looking at nearly 40 years gone by, so I'm thinking the C.I.'s probably not making cases anymore.<eos> And you want the name?<eos> It's gotta be in one of these snitch boxes, right?
Why start a fight you can't win?<eos> Because Orus is dead... and father, destroyed.<eos> Because of you.<eos> Your body will settle in time.<eos> It will relax, and then the milk will flow.
Too late for that.<eos> Every woman is different.<eos> We're beyond lies, Mother.<eos> My body speaks.<eos> It says I am not a mother.
And the Blue Sky has not grown thick with ice.<eos> - So said Genghis Khan.<eos> - As last you predicted.<eos> "Victory does not come to he who lives by the rules.<eos> It comes to he who makes the rules... he who imposes the rules on his enemies."
How can I be fucking certain?<eos> Watch the attitude.<eos> Our friends are businessmen, and you are very bad for business.<eos> You tell them this whole thing is gonna blow over.<eos> The smoke is gonna clear, and when it does we're gonna pick up right where we left off.
Others are prepping for the storm evacuation protocols.<eos> Okay, well, we need to get out to the farm right away.<eos> We need to talk to the owner. He's waiting for us.<eos> We are now receiving footage of the typhoon making landfall in Cambodia.<eos> It's moved north and is due to hit Thailand in 24 hours. - Oh.
Oh, this is weird.<eos> -He's never this late.<eos> -I'm telling you, his stupid plan failed.<eos> I thought you liked his plan.<eos> Yeah, but obviously it was stupid, or he'd be here.
I just saw him on patrol, you know?<eos> Dumb luck.<eos> So that quarry, that's, uh... that's state-run, where they found the boy, huh?<eos> Yeah, well, that's funny.<eos> 'Cause, you know, I know for a fact that it's run by the Sattler Company.
Clary, please.<eos> Clary, come on.<eos> I don't see the mortal cup!<eos> We searched.<eos> It's not in the loft.
Clary, come on.<eos> I don't see the mortal cup!<eos> We searched.<eos> It's not in the loft.<eos> Just because you couldn't find it doesn't mean it isn't there.
"Downtown," like, the city?<eos> Yeah, and we're not asking.<eos> Look, maybe one day things will get better, but... right now, there's nobody safe around here.<eos> Did you hear what happened to Adele's shop?<eos> It got busted up last night.
Regina, I can't.<eos> I have to go with Zeke to his internship interview with my tío today... and shit, there's no way he's not gonna be asking about the song.<eos> Which he's paying for.<eos> I'm gonna have to lie to him again. Tell him everything's great, everything's fine.<eos> The song is great, which it clearly ain't.
The new song?<eos> It's fly, tío.<eos> Good.<eos> Well maybe you can debut it at my fundraiser tonight.<eos> I'd love to, but it's not quite ready yet.
Best hope he rhymes as good as he paints.<eos> ♪ When I first came out My brothers said to me ♪<eos> ♪ Go by the name of Pretty Dizzee D ♪<eos> ♪ The name was too long For the goddamn song ♪<eos> ♪ But I made it sound so differently ♪
Poor guy. Oh, gee, I didn't know.<eos> He only told me 50 fucking times.<eos> So when does the whole empathy thing kick in for you?<eos> I did take the liberty of seating him next to you tonight at dinner, so who knows how this evening will end?<eos> I think it just did.
Jesus Christ, I'm talking about Frances.<eos> You need to focus on her, not on this, because she is the important shit.<eos> ( sighs ) Nick, is everything okay at home? Is Diane threatening to kill you again?<eos> Everything is great at home.<eos> The incident, as awful as it was, actually saved my marriage.
Look, this is bullshit.<eos> I can have a retrieval team out here in the morning.<eos> It's policy.<eos> We just need the control unit.<eos> We found a stray up here, but I don't think it got here by accident.
And to the horror of everyone, he killed that little cat.<eos> Tore it to pieces.<eos> Then he just sat there, confused.<eos> That dog had spent its whole life trying to catch that... thing.<eos> Now it had no idea what to do.
Look, Destin, in a second, I'm gonna walk out of here and your friends are gonna wonder what this was all about.<eos> Now, your answer can either be, "I'm helping behavior track a problem,"<eos> or "I'm a creepy necro perv."<eos> Up to you.<eos> Five minutes, then it's going in the incinerator.
You're supposed to be resting.<eos> We're riding a train full with explosives through scalping territory.<eos> Not sleepy.<eos> Can I ask you something?<eos> This place you're looking for, what makes you so sure it exists?
Just an extravagant display intended to attract a mate.<eos> All of art, literature, Bethoven, Mozart, William Shakespeare, Michelangelo and the Empire State Building, ... just an elaborate mating ritual.<eos> Maybe it doesn't matter that we have accomplished so much for the basest of reasons.<eos> But, of course, the peacock can barely fly.<eos> It lives in the dirt, pecking insects out of the muck, consoling itself with its great beauty.
No, thanks.<eos> This is for you.<eos> Wow.<eos> How was your flight?<eos> It was good.
What do you think of Loïe?<eos> What is Loïe?<eos> My stage name for my dance.<eos> You dance?<eos> I think it's beautiful.
It's over. Okay?<eos> Plus, it's gonna get dark soon.<eos> But I love Time Hump.<eos> You got to do more stories.<eos> Uh, maybe... the gingerbread tastes weird because there's a spell on it.
Well, anywho...<eos> There's no need for tears or declarations today.<eos> I was saying that... for the future.<eos> Gotta think about it!<eos> But the day should end as it started, without obligations, without intention.
- Boondee.<eos> Boondee.<eos> Boondee.<eos> You told me you wanted to get out of the Zone, yeah?<eos> Now, I know this place isn't everything, but it's almost everything.
- Over to you.<eos> - I can't.<eos> Whoever's in there, it's safe to come out.<eos> Follow the smoke.<eos> It will set you free.
Let them start in the field to drag stones to the dike.<eos> Miss Hammershøi.<eos> But he can't.<eos> Elmer's clubfoot always gets hurt if he has to carry heavy things.<eos> Well. It'll likely go.
She'll be right back.<eos> This happens at all our weddings.<eos> Kimmy, what is going on with you?<eos> I'm enjoying my cake.<eos> Here, try some before it's all gone.
Why?<eos> Well, it's just the worst possible time for this to be happening.<eos> Is your computer acting up again?<eos> My computer is more than acting up.<eos> It's taking over my mind.
Pearly gates?<eos> No, no, no, no, no, no.<eos> Not yet, anyway.<eos> You ever hear of the phoenix?<eos> Yeah, magical bird, when it dies, it immolates itself, and from the ashes another one arises.
Lawyers, accountants... the whole thing.<eos> Guys at his shop are prepping their résumés.<eos> Well, if it was just smoke, they'd issue a denial...<eos> Keep working.<eos> Yeah. They're treating this article like it's a warrant.
Nice speech at the meeting yesterday<eos> Generally, this town is light years ahead...<eos> So there's a competing town?<eos> Other towns could land the deal?<eos> The main issue is that it gets built in this general area
Generally, this town is light years ahead...<eos> So there's a competing town?<eos> Other towns could land the deal?<eos> The main issue is that it gets built in this general area<eos> Whatever the outcome, it's a huge benefit for the government What's this deal about?
Right.<eos> You can read that in my report. But there's no evidence of another shooter.<eos> You just tell us, detective, did you pull your weapon?<eos> I drew my weapon, but I never fired.<eos> Look, I know this sounds crazy, but the shot sounded like it came from a high-powered rifle on a nearby rooftop.
Are you bringing a bulletproof vest?<eos> Always.<eos> That won't work if you get shot in the head, though.<eos> That's correct.<eos> Luckily, few people aim for the head, because it's a difficult target.
Okay.<eos> Bye.<eos> I stayed up late last night.<eos> Lots of speculation about the prize.<eos> Is there a chance Rolf Inherad and Oil for Development will get it?
Sorry to hear that.<eos> You know the story behind this, don't you?<eos> Someone's killing people and burying the proof.<eos> Why did you have me look into that city planner?<eos> Did you know it was related to Elias's partner, Bruce? About that.
I imagine it could.<eos> But does your Machine know the password?<eos> Or more importantly, does it know what would happen if the virus is launched?<eos> Have you told it the truth, Harold?<eos> That it may destroy Samaritan, but it would kill your Machine as well.
I'm giving you the opportunity to save your Machine, which you so clearly love and loves you in return.<eos> For what purpose?<eos> Samaritan would consider your Machine a much-needed peer for what promises to be a fantastic voyage.<eos> This virus you uploaded is nothing but a tragic mistake.<eos> Tell me, after it's eradicated both ASIs, what then?
Okay, how does that feel to you?<eos> Good.<eos> Fine, fine.<eos> - Is his collar okay? - Yeah.<eos> It's very nice.
What's it like up there?<eos> The sun was out.<eos> You gotta get my ring.<eos> I stashed it up there when he brought me in.<eos> It's in the bathroom.
- What?<eos> - Enough time goes by, Things change.<eos> Look.<eos> Here's your bridge. - Mm-hmm.<eos> - Here's your tributary, where it should be... - Okay.
I did, but I forgot something, so I came back.<eos> Good for you, Ricky.<eos> You ever been up in that jungle before?<eos> It's not a jungle; it's the bush.<eos> There's about a million hectares of it, buddy.
Guaranteed four to five spins a day. - Gonna be huge.<eos> - Okay.<eos> What about ACR? You dropping anything?<eos> Yeah, I'm laying down a killer track in New York right now.<eos> What's it called?
We need to cut it open.<eos> We don't know what's inside this thing.<eos> Yeah, exactly.<eos> What if the suit isn't protecting it from us?<eos> What if it's protecting us from it?
The rolodex?<eos> Our database.<eos> Justin Albert Kim-- he lasted three weeks in boot camp in Coronado before he broke his leg and medical-ed out.<eos> I've been able to flag several locations of interest.<eos> This might be nothing, but we need to follow the string until it's cut. Oh.
I wish I'd packed my clubs.<eos> But I'm guessing you didn't call me out here for golf.<eos> You've been briefed on the situation at Isodyne?<eos> Just crossing the t's on that report right now.<eos> It will be very uncontroversial.
- If we obtain more zero matter, Cal, then the council answers to us.<eos> This is insane.<eos> People thought Galileo was insane.<eos> This plan will work, Cal.<eos> It will work.
Why were you trying to steal this from the vault in New York?<eos> Maybe I was hired to steal it.<eos> Maybe the pin is not just a pin.<eos> Maybe that pin unlocks the secrets to every major decision made in this cesspool of a country.<eos> Maybe it just matched my blouse.
He's only one of many.<eos> Do you have any idea how deep the rot goes in the SSR?<eos> 33-23-33...<eos> Your idealism blinds you, Peggy.<eos> And it will kill us all.
Sorry.<eos> Say something about my dick.<eos> Your dick... it feels so good. - Yeah?<eos> - It does, right? - Doctor.<eos> - It does feel good. - Okay.
- I think my dick fell asleep.<eos> I don't know if I, like, sat on it weird, or, like, pinched an artery, but, like...<eos> my big dick fell asleep.<eos> Oh, no.<eos> It fell asleep?
What does that mean?<eos> If we're going to end this once and for all, we need to open the rift, knock the Zero Matter out of Whitney, and send it back to wherever it came from.<eos> It's not that easy.<eos> We have no real understanding about how the rift works.<eos> Discovering it in the first place was a fluke.
We can't give this to them.<eos> They'll be sitting ducks.<eos> We can't put this intel into the hands of a terrorist.<eos> We can, but only if we can track them down before they actually use it.<eos> We could plant a worm into an attachment so that, when the recipient opens it, the worm pings their location.
You think it's weird, a guy who dances?<eos> When I dance... I let everything around me come inside.<eos> And I don't cheat.<eos> Dance doesn't lie.<eos> It's sacred.
I need to know what happened.<eos> Monty...<eos> Please.<eos> We landed in the snow.<eos> Your father said it absorbed some of the impact.
- Good.<eos> - Otan...<eos> Emori, get in the boat.<eos> Now give me the pack.<eos> It's all yours, Chancellor.
I gave her a heads-up.<eos> She knows, like, this isn't, like... the hottest ticket in town.<eos> So, it's fine.<eos> Where did you get that toaster?<eos> Oh, it came with, uh, the Springwood.
We're talking 1970s terrorists with 21st-century weapons.<eos> And since we don't know where Savage went...<eos> We don't have to find Savage.<eos> We just have to find the other piece of my suit.<eos> Which shrinks because it's made of an alloy which mimics intra-molecular compression of dwarf star, thus emitting Alpha Particles.
Laurence Laurentz.<eos> And you look wonderful, wonderful.<eos> How do you feel?<eos> Uh, well, this here collar is a little tight.<eos> No, no, no. It's nicely fit, looks a marvel.
You did?<eos> Did you see where Mr. Flaherty put the flash drive?<eos> In the emergency kit.<eos> All right, Sophie, show me the flash drive.<eos> There it is.
The family that owned it gave it to the state in the '30s.<eos> The state turned it into a living history museum.<eos> Every elementary school for 50 miles used to come here for field trips.<eos> The place was running a long time before the modern world built up around it.<eos> I think people came here because they figured it'd keep running after the modern world broke down.
And you don't know how many people they have?<eos> No.<eos> Uh, I mean, no.<eos> I saw a place where they stored food.<eos> It wasn't that big, so...
Those things'll kill you.<eos> They already have.<eos> I'm a dead woman walking.<eos> Which puts us in exactly the same boat.<eos> Ah! My arm feels like it's on fire.
If I believed in the old words, I would pray for him.<eos> But that's gone for me now.<eos> Perhaps that is the root of what has been troubling me.<eos> I have left my faith.<eos> Or it has left me.
Good.<eos> Coordinate with your mom but keep the circle tight.<eos> Then there's the matter of campwide surveillance.<eos> You want us to spy on our people?<eos> We can't do what's needed to defend this camp if every order I give is leaked before it can be executed.
You gotta see it.<eos> Anna Gunn is amazing in it.<eos> But look, people can deal with the time jump.<eos> All right?<eos> Just don't make it jarring.
I was beginning to fear something terrible had happened.<eos> So I made up my mind if you didn't come for me I'd climb up into some tree and stay up there all night.<eos> It would be lovely to sleep in a tree.<eos> Wild, crooked, white with bloom.<eos> Can you imagine in the moonlight how it would look?
Yeah, I just can't stop thinking about Brooke.<eos> You know, she's searching.<eos> She's hurting.<eos> Yeah, that's the thing about atheism.<eos> It doesn't take away the pain; It just takes away the hope.
- Yeah.<eos> - Right, so, we flat paper people would perceive this 3-dimensional cube as many separate 2-dimensional moments.<eos> As time passing -- the point on the line traveling through space and time.<eos> But, in fact, the cube, the line is fixed.<eos> Yeah, it's just sitting there.
Perhaps you practice your politics here.<eos> Spread goodwill among your own people.<eos> - My army's bigger than his.<eos> - Oh, excellent news.<eos> You were fine with war when it was with Ariq.
Important Kaidu.<eos> It has been hard to get out here to you, Mother.<eos> You put me out here.<eos> The tree had medicine, you said.<eos> It had spirit.
-Good.<eos> Your female instinct, what does it tell you?<eos> I don't have one.<eos> Of course you do.<eos> It just wants nurturing.
They might follow it.<eos> If ever I'm cursed with visiting your homeland, you may guide the way.<eos> Until then... stay quiet.<eos> Cast the raptor out.<eos> Have it favor the north.
He also performed brain surgery.<eos> You were trephined. This has to be the room where I met the Master in the past!<eos> Help me.<eos> Uncovered memories are sometimes suppressed for a reason.<eos> The mind protects itself from what it doesn't want to know, the castle pulling up the drawbridge.
So there's no way he's coming close to an explosion or an ATV.<eos> Hey. Your body is not a commodity.<eos> You tell you what you do with you.<eos> Chet, first of all, my body is a commodity, okay?<eos> It's my living.
You okay?<eos> Shut the door.<eos> All right, has anybody seen my messenger?<eos> Nothing yet, boss.<eos> Great, can you please just let me know the second it arrives?
What the hell is that? Hmm?<eos> Oh, that's my progeny.<eos> This is the future of the Wilton line.<eos> That caterwauling ball of flesh is the result of you cheating on me with your wife.<eos> It came out of her vagina.
Seriously, this is just me, okay?<eos> This is not about some game.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> Man, I don't like what this place is doing to everybody.<eos> Hell, I don't like what it's doing to me. What's it doing to you?
We're looking for a friend.<eos> There is a place.<eos> They send you there, you never come back.<eos> You can hear the screams all night.<eos> This place, where is it?
This a happier dance.<eos> The happiest dance.<eos> After we have gone through a long suffering, then we are happy to go back and dance and to express ourselves.<eos> I studied here ten years ago with some colleagues, scientists from Vanuatu.<eos> For you, is it strange to imagine that someone would come here to work, to study how the volcano works, how it erupts?
The mountain was expected to explode at any moment, and 70,000 people were rapidly evacuated.<eos> The fear was intense because of the memory of an event that took on apocalyptic proportions.<eos> It was known that, in 1902, on the neighboring island of Martinique, Mount Pelée exploded.<eos> The signals that La Soufrière issued in Guadeloupe were almost identical to what had happened. It was measured in 1902.<eos> So, everybody was afraid it would explode, and it would explode with very, very massive force, many times an atomic bomb, Hiroshima-size.
Button it up, Mary.<eos> Nobody wants to go to jail behind your mouth.<eos> I'll do my best, sugar.<eos> Not a great place for three of y'all be having car trouble.<eos> We didn't pick the place, Officer. It picked us.
That is a negative, CAPCOM.<eos> This poses a grave danger to the mission.<eos> Tell them not to jettison the retro-package.<eos> NASA is confirming there is some sort of malfunction with the capsule's heat shield... and it may not stay in place.<eos> If the heat shield's loose... the retro-package straps might hold it in place.
-Oh, my God, my cock.<eos> Oh, my God, my cock is really hard.<eos> I know, baby.<eos> No, it's really hard.<eos> Like, right now, it's really hard.
Like, right now, it's really hard.<eos> -I know, Vinnie...<eos> -Oh, God.<eos> -Vinnie, put it inside me. -Yeah?<eos> Oh, my God, it's in you.
There's an old tale, from Ireland, where I once lived.<eos> We have there an ancient tradition of keening.<eos> After a death, the old women gather together and sing the most poignant and beautiful lamentations.<eos> It's a way to sing the soul to a better place, a place of divine peace or rapture even.<eos> But several years ago, the old men of the Catholic Church decided they did not approve of this pagan practice as it circumvented their rituals and mysteries.
Mine is doing it too.<eos> Mr. Douglas has a compass.<eos> What are you gonna do with it?<eos> Follow it. Seriously?<eos> Where do you think it goes?
This is Alex's house.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> This is where the compass led us.<eos> What compass?<eos> Why is it doing that?
- Come on.<eos> - Miss skrillex.<eos> Go ahead.<eos> Welcome to the lion's den, kid.<eos> Sonic, this time I want you to throw the laser off the wall, and then it can kind of boom off of her buns.
- Fucking faggot!<eos> Let's cool off.<eos> When did you become a homophobe?<eos> You see, we paid for this bus, right?<eos> And it broke down, and there was this riot.
- No. There's no mistaking it, Lieutenant.<eos> This belonged to Betsy Ross.<eos> Nothing left but a ruin.<eos> Shame what's become of this place.<eos> In its day, it was glorious.
And there may be a day in the future where I do.<eos> So for that reason... I will do this.<eos> No.<eos> In chess, we call that move a sacrifice.<eos> On the face, it presents a loss, but in the end, gives tactical superiority.
The hangar doors are still jammed.<eos> We managed to pry them open halfway, but until I get a new feed pump, we're grounded.<eos> Not necessarily.<eos> Coulson has another way.<eos> But it's risky and irresponsible.
She'll hear everything.<eos> Every death, every dying scream, all at once.<eos> That's going to kill her.<eos> Not only that...<eos> Her own dying scream could be so powerful that it might kill everyone around her as well.
No.<eos> But if you try to kill my son again, I'll put you in one of these myself.<eos> She's still mad.<eos> That's the worst plan I've ever heard.<eos> Okay, the plan is perfect and it'll work perfectly, especially if you agree to drive the van.
She did it. Kira did it.<eos> Five minutes to get to Lydia.<eos> Where's the card reader?<eos> It should be here.<eos> It has to be here.
Damnatio Memoriae.<eos> That's what they wanted.<eos> They wanted Sebastien to remember his name.<eos> Scott, you know the myth of what happens when you call a werewolf by its given name?<eos> It turns back to human.
It should be me.<eos> If you get me close enough, I'll do it.<eos> We're not killing your best friend.<eos> That belongs to me.<eos> It's a family heirloom.
We're not killing your best friend.<eos> That belongs to me.<eos> It's a family heirloom.<eos> I'd like it back, please.<eos> It's all yours.
So he can... what?<eos> Stop time?<eos> No, no, no.<eos> Look at the time code.<eos> It's still running.
I... no, I got to go.<eos> Where are you... finding Turtle is what's important right now.<eos> Yeah, this is important to me too.<eos> But we need to see if your speed still works. I think...<eos> I think it still works.
Hey!<eos> Hey!<eos> You can't tow this Jeep.<eos> Paperwork says I can.<eos> It's reported as abandoned.
Hey!<eos> You can't tow this Jeep.<eos> Paperwork says I can.<eos> It's reported as abandoned.<eos> And now it's not.
Beats the hell out of me.<eos> I mean, that thing was a junker back in the day.<eos> God only knows who'd want it now.<eos> Maybe somebody dumped it there?<eos> Is there any way to trace the history of the Jeep after it was stolen?
Some might say death is inevitable, and yet here I am a thousand years old, sipping an exquisite aged whiskey while a beguiling muse sits across from me.<eos> I am the perfect picture of health and vitality, a master of my fate, a conqueror of death itself.<eos> Yaah! See?<eos> That's exactly my point.<eos> You make some glib, throwaway line about death as though it means nothing to you, but it does.
No one can help you.<eos> Do you understand?<eos> Young, healthy, a tad unsophisticated, but not bad.<eos> Listen to the heartbeat.<eos> It will tell you when to stop.
What?<eos> They can't...<eos> They can't fix her.<eos> What do you mean, they can't fix her?<eos> The damage to her spinal cord, it's...
They can't...<eos> They can't fix her.<eos> What do you mean, they can't fix her?<eos> The damage to her spinal cord, it's...<eos> Oliver, it's permanent.
You saw what kind of man my brother was, what kind of man he is.<eos> He's your family. You said he was a good man.<eos> Maybe part of him still is. I don't know.<eos> Get down.<eos> The damage to her spinal cord, it's permanent.
Mr. Dennis says you're no longer presenting the power cell to the board.<eos> Well, my dry run was an epic disaster.<eos> Yeah, I know.<eos> It was... It was a spectacular failure.<eos> Like, it was really bad.
Please tell me that the nails are the clue and not what's on the laptop's hard drive because there are 3 nails running straight through this thing. Yeah.<eos> The bad guys went a little crazy with that nail gun.<eos> Yeah. According to Andy, they're called the Demolition Team, former GRU, IRA, and Mossad.<eos> They're experts at precision demolition. Now they work for HIVE.<eos> I got a look at the laptop before it got shot up, and there were blueprints on the screen.
Just months ago, I was a dive instructor.<eos> Couldn't dream of taking a life.<eos> I wouldn't.<eos> This place truly is Hell.<eos> It makes monsters of us all.
That was Reiter.<eos> But there's another way off the island.<eos> And here I thought you'd never use the comm gear I gave you to radio for a trip home.<eos> Well, I lost it for a while, and the job wasn't done.<eos> And now it is.
Let's go.<eos> They said I was crazy in 'Nam.<eos> Said that's what the jungle does to a man.<eos> I knew.<eos> The war wasn't over there, it was here.
He told me he wants to destroy time... So there'd be no more death.<eos> He made it sound almost beautiful.<eos> Well, it's not.<eos> Death is like... everything.<eos> It's a time clock that makes us better.
Well, it's not.<eos> Death is like... everything.<eos> It's a time clock that makes us better.<eos> Makes us love harder.<eos> I don't know, I think it's, like, maybe... what makes us human.
We can walk out of this room, find her together.<eos> You're never gonna see Daisy again.<eos> Oh, go ahead.<eos> Destroy this body.<eos> It's well-worn.
-I don't know.<eos> It's just... different.<eos> You want to leave?<eos> What is that coffee table doing floating out in space?<eos> And this chair? Looks like it dropped out of a wormhole from the Tang Dynasty.
-Oh, brother. -There's a brown sweater, Xanax, mouth guard.<eos> -God, I hope there's a case on that.<eos> -Well, the Xanax will not be upstairs because he keeps that with all his other drugs, which are with the spices in the kitchen.<eos> Well, that makes about as much sense as a sarape on a velvet couch.<eos> And the brown sweater is in a cedar box he keeps in the closet so that it will smell like the cabin where he first read Catcher in the Rye.
Alert the pack.<eos> Anyone sees Vargas, kill her.<eos> You were trapped in the precinct all day.<eos> If that demon wanted you dead, it certainly had the opportunity.<eos> It's not after me. It's after Clary.
Oh, it's on.<eos> Get him, Bar.<eos> Not fast enough, Thawne.<eos> I will never lose to you again.<eos> This war between us, it ends now!
Yeah, yeah, I would...<eos> I would love that.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> - Okay.<eos> My head feels like it's in a vise.
I don't know.<eos> Saving the girl that I love and the world at the same time?<eos> Feels pretty right to me.<eos> The jet's shaking pretty good.<eos> I hope it...together.
He's your relation. No, I couldn't possibly!<eos> Boy.<eos> You look like a sweet lad.<eos> May I ask you to run this letter in through that door, drop it on the big desk just inside, and then run back out?<eos> Who's it for?
Are you quite sure?<eos> I saw him with my own eyes.<eos> Finn must have come back when Davina resurrected me.<eos> The spell was tied to the blood of the Mikaelson line.<eos> Either it worked on him, or he found a way to hijack it.
Your feelings may not have changed, but mine have.<eos> I've been lying to myself, trying to hold on.<eos> But the part of me that loved you, the part of me that hoped for your redemption...<eos> That part was human.<eos> And it's gone.
Finn!<eos> - Oh, what's happening? !<eos> - What's happening?<eos> What's wrong with him?<eos> His body, it's dying.
And Freya is certain this power will be enough to kill Lucien?<eos> Yes.<eos> But we'd be placing Davina in terrible danger.<eos> The only thing protecting her from the Ancestors is Freya's circle.<eos> Now, if it is broken...
For what purpose, my Lord?<eos> A necessary ruse.<eos> And I now possess all of Palmer's knowledge and memories.<eos> Thus, using Palmer's memories, I have located the other nuclear device.<eos> - Where is it?
I am so sorry for your loss.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Did you, uh, explain to her that the old furnace was lethal?<eos> Uh, actually, I did, yeah.<eos> I told her that it could be lethal.
Who's "Hyperion"?<eos> Apparently, he's a big F-ing deal.<eos> All right, the plan, therefore, would be to hit the metro and abduct him at the MacArthur Park station.<eos> Judging by security presence, it looks like Wilshire and Vermont is the final destination.<eos> But we want to hit the train further upstream, here in the tunnel before it enters MacArthur Park station.
-Good, good changes. -Good changes.<eos> The mascot competition was a tipping point for us.<eos> -Yeah.<eos> -You know.<eos> I mean, it was just a fiasco.
Look... there was a boy... and his father bought him a falcon for his sixth birthday.<eos> Are you seriously telling me a story right now?<eos> Please, just listen.<eos> His father told him to tame the bird.<eos> Make it obedient.
His father told him to tame the bird.<eos> Make it obedient.<eos> That's crazy.<eos> And the boy would spend every day with that falcon.<eos> It would scratch at him.
Luke, are you okay?<eos> What happened?<eos> Uh... you should see the other guy.<eos> We were attacked by a Forsaken, if you can even call it that.<eos> Anyway, it's dead.
I want you to help me put the shelf locks on.<eos> It's Saturday.<eos> We're going to put together a baby sling.<eos> Isn't the baby a little young for a sling?<eos> It's for the sink.
Ivan the Terrible massacred thousands.<eos> King Herod ordered the killing of every male infant under the age of two...<eos> ..and if Jesus Christ himself hadn't been slumming it in a manger... he would have slaughtered him too because a younger, faster king was coming to take what he had.<eos> You think this place is made of wood and stone?<eos> It's built on blood.
Marci came by, though.<eos> Some of the higher-ups at her firm were impressed with my opening argument in the Castle case.<eos> Yeah, I'm not surprised.<eos> Neither am I. Not anymore.<eos> Castle case was in many ways a disaster, but... it made me realize I'm really good at my job.
If I knew that... this conversation wouldn't be necessary.<eos> That's not a lot to go on.<eos> You can be sure his goods will be well-guarded by professionals clearly more capable than my own.<eos> But I fear that the path you've chosen... isn't going to be an easy one.<eos> Yeah, it never is.
Right. Yeah.<eos> Have you ever seen a therapist?<eos> You know, for your pent-up anger and your trust issues. And your attraction to very dull men.<eos> Let's just focus on the case, shall we?<eos> Well, I will, once it's interesting. Oh!
Because He didn't have faith in me.<eos> I felt that way once, too.<eos> But now I know, deep in my heart, God has a plan for me.<eos> Oh, His plan for me was quite clear.<eos> How do you know it's finished?
Please.<eos> You shouldn't trick children.<eos> That shows who you are.<eos> Look at your sweater.<eos> It's ruined.
You shouldn't trick children.<eos> That shows who you are.<eos> Look at your sweater.<eos> It's ruined.<eos> It's dirty.
Yeah, it's a winner.<eos> Hey, that star on your arm...<eos> - I earned it.<eos> You will too with effort, whole sleeve of 'em.<eos> So what does it mean?
And then I... got here, and... it's amazing I survived as long as I did not knowing that I was a Magician.<eos> I can't go back.<eos> So, okay.<eos> There's a spell if they question you so they can't read your minds. I'll write it down.<eos> It's bulletproof.
They will consume you.<eos> Change you... into something else.<eos> - Now that I have your attention. We test to discern your discipline.<eos> Your area of concentration.<eos> It is what you are, and with the right guidance, you may safely rise to unknowable heights.
That's why he... he hated me being an exterminator.<eos> You know, someone who kills for a living.<eos> He feared that darkness in himself and in me.<eos> The war caused many atrocities, Mr. Fet.<eos> It exposed the worst in human behaviour.
"Yummy." Yo, are you guys seeing this?<eos> Oh, yeah, we see it.<eos> All right, any ideas?<eos> Viscosity of asphalt lowers as its temperature lowers.<eos> Yeah, yeah, yeah, and it hardens.
Nope, not working.<eos> Not working.<eos> Something brighter.<eos> ...looking down with her wide, endlessly patient eyes.<eos> They would twinkle with red, blue and yellow light, just as the damned Jesus fish had when it pulled him out of the fog and into hell.
But we have to separate that out.<eos> It can't affect our plan.<eos> Because that's the one thing... that we have figured out.<eos> When Walker and Vasquez... betrayed us, pulled the Secretary of State right out from under my feet, there was no room for doubt, and you made me remember that.<eos> We took a path... a difficult one, because we had no guarantee where it was going to lead us.
"ICO occupies Kurdish stronghold."<eos> How many of you have heard of ICO?<eos> They're Muslim extremists taking over oil fields in Syria.<eos> The media is barely covering them because the White House is turning a blind eye.<eos> As the Governor of New York... I can't turn a blind eye to terrorism because it's been right here on our doorstep.
And?<eos> Was it like with Joshua?<eos> Did you see it come out?<eos> I told you, it's not always like that.<eos> Then how can you be sure it's gone?
Uh, yeah, I'm fine.<eos> What happened?<eos> With the rest of the breaches closed, the energy surge to this last remaining breach must have destabilized it.<eos> Well, what does that mean?<eos> As long as it's unstable Barry and Cisco will be trapped over there.
[in normal voice] I like this guy, he's got good hustle.<eos> Hey. What's the secret, you guys?<eos> Oh, you're so serious.<eos> I have a joke in Spanish.<eos> It takes 12 minutes to tell.
You said you liked swimming, so that's the logical next step.<eos> -That could be fun.<eos> -Yeah. I did train for that half marathon that one time.<eos> If you have a wish, you can do anything.<eos> If you have a wish, you put it in a can.
I'm not talking about my cologne.<eos> That's why I hang back and wait for him to get specific.<eos> My mustache.<eos> I've been growing it for weeks, and the two of you have been conspicuously silent.<eos> It's very dashing.
I'm just a regular person, like you.<eos> I have people put on my pants one leg at a time.<eos> That's so funny.<eos> Barbra, today is his birthday!<eos> Well, technically, it was three weeks ago.
They also make fudge that'll knock your balls up your ass.<eos> How can you be serious about this?<eos> This is insane.<eos> No, baby. This is the sanest decision I have ever made.<eos> The cancer has come back. It's everywhere.
Do you recognize this woman?<eos> Never seen her in my life, but if she's some big deal, I can keep my eye out.<eos> Sure, that'd be great.<eos> Thanks. You look like the sky's about to fall.<eos> The sky's fine right where it is.
If the public don't trust us, they don't listen to us, and if they don't listen to us, people end up dead.<eos> Now, there are 4,000 innocent lives being held inside those gates, and their one goal is to stay healthy.<eos> Our one goal... make sure those gates hold.<eos> Because if they don't, every person in this city is at risk of exposure.<eos> And once that virus is out, it is out. - You hear me?
- What was her suit like?<eos> - Hey. - Hey, it's a valid question.<eos> - It is, actually.<eos> How was her suit constructed?<eos> It was good.
- Hey. - Hey, it's a valid question.<eos> - It is, actually.<eos> How was her suit constructed?<eos> It was good.<eos> It was very good.
Let us help you, please.<eos> That is all the help I need.<eos> How does it feel to know that I am faster than you will ever be?<eos> See you around.<eos> The lightning, it's turning blue.
At least now we know why.<eos> You find Jesse?<eos> She went out.<eos> Barry, what is it?<eos> It's just right before Eliza disappeared, her lightning, it turned blue.
That's it!<eos> Good boy.<eos> - It's wriggling.<eos> - Of course it's wriggling, it's a worm.<eos> It'll stop wriggling once you put it on the hook.
Thank you.<eos> Rich man or beggar, it does not discriminate.<eos> Death doesn't care about fleeing your demons,<eos> or making amends for them.<eos> It doesn't care about any of that.
Killed us both!<eos> You shouldn't keep secrets!<eos> I wanted peace!<eos> We've all seen what war does to the world!<eos> It makes refugees!
You follow its instructions, you will enhance the Speed Force in your system and run faster... than you ever thought possible.<eos> If this doesn't work... I'm coming back.<eos> Dr. Wells, we need you.<eos> Time to go home, Flash.<eos> Okay, our satellite has finally found our floating friend and it's coming back.
It's... it's...<eos> Forget it.<eos> It's okay.<eos> I know that your store's important to you.<eos> Yeah, I know, but it's not...
They talked to you?<eos> Who was it?<eos> Giles?<eos> Younger cop. Big guy.<eos> Said I left some DNA in it.
- Yes.<eos> We selected different birds, seeking to emphasize the natural touch representing Martín's identity.<eos> This one here, with the moon in the background, is a Tacuara,<eos> I think it's the one that best represents you, Martín.<eos> With this one, we had a problem with the beak, but it is typical in this area.
All right.<eos> This is where we split up.<eos> The entrance to the tunnel is right over there.<eos> Yeah.<eos> We know where it is.
This city is screwed up because of you.<eos> It was quiet and normal.<eos> Until you rode in on your high horse, talking about science and changing the future.<eos> You didn't stop to think about what your particle accelerator could do to others.<eos> You only thought about what it could do for you.
- They did find him.<eos> Professor Sunderland and March found him trying to open a portal near the Welters stadium.<eos> Where are they taking him?<eos> Have you ever been in this room before?<eos> It was designed at the turn of the century for a sect of incredibly delicate experiments.
Where are they taking him?<eos> Have you ever been in this room before?<eos> It was designed at the turn of the century for a sect of incredibly delicate experiments.<eos> Mechanism within the walls, prevent any spell casting, it is, in fact, a clean room.<eos> It was not intended for this... this purpose, but it will do.
Should be quick. I'll get it there now.<eos> What did you change?<eos> I took out the paragraph about love.<eos> - That's the best part.<eos> - It was too soft.
My mind keeps racing, over and over and over again.<eos> What we could've done differently. How we could've covered our tracks.<eos> The people we should've kept closer...<eos> I'm frightened, Claire.<eos> If we can't stop the damage, we have to control it, Francis.
Entrusted to anyone who sits behind this desk is something far more elemental, the very survival of our nation.<eos> And I, as your president, must confront the storm before us.<eos> That storm is terror.<eos> More dangerous and unpredictable than any hurricane.<eos> It has endangered us abroad.

That storm is terror.<eos> More dangerous and unpredictable than any hurricane.<eos> It has endangered us abroad.<eos> It has endangered us at home.<eos> And right now, it has placed James Miller in the gravest of dangers.
I'm better when I write things down, 'cause I can just fix them later.<eos> I can make the code work.<eos> I like it when the code works.<eos> Do me a favor-- tell me the sky is green.<eos> But it's not.

I like it when the code works.<eos> Do me a favor-- tell me the sky is green.<eos> But it's not.<eos> It's blue.<eos> To be more accurate, it appears blue because of diffused sky radiation.
Well, you saw the scar tissue, Jackson.<eos> You said it yourself.<eos> It's just like your arm.<eos> If we can figure out what happened to him, then we can stop it from happening to you.<eos> His arm looks like it was bitten off.
You said it yourself.<eos> It's just like your arm.<eos> If we can figure out what happened to him, then we can stop it from happening to you.<eos> His arm looks like it was bitten off.<eos> More like it was gnawed.
Are you alone?<eos> Alone and unarmed, as promised.<eos> Well, I'm alone, but I don't go anywhere unarmed. Sorry.<eos> I'm here because I care about my daughter.<eos> And if the war continues, it will destroy the kingdom, but more importantly, her soul.
You--you don't look like his daughters.<eos> Yeah, no, I was making a joke about them.<eos> No, it was good.<eos> It was a good joke.<eos> No, it wasn't.
[Whispering] To have her killed.<eos> Let me see your ring.<eos> You know what that is?<eos> A noose.<eos> It kills you slowly, day by day.
I let my brother drown so I could save myself.<eos> So that's why you're hallucinating him?<eos> Because some faux version of your brother is upset with something that you did in a fake reality?<eos> The hellstone is trying to tell me something.<eos> It's trying to prove a point.
I'll catch up with you guys.<eos> Hey, I waited for you at our lunch table, but you didn't show up.<eos> Yeah, I wasn't hungry.<eos> Well, I saved you a cupcake, anyway.<eos> It's a little mushy, but...
Like taking over the world.<eos> Max, we have to hide that crystal again, somewhere phears can never find it.<eos> I don't have it.<eos> What?<eos> Max, where is it?
Now, what's this all about, Max?<eos> If I told you, you wouldn't believe me.<eos> Try me.<eos> I found the crystal in a box in my house.<eos> It was left there by some scientists who used it to trap an evil ghost, but somehow, he escaped and possessed the body of a reality TV show star up at the old grover mansion.
Yeah, of course.<eos> Good.<eos> I'd really like to have my crystal back, Max.<eos> You would?<eos> It's so beautiful, Max.
I can see where they are. I'm curious, Shadowhunter, who knows so much about Portals, did you never wonder why this Portal shard doesn't behave the way normal Portals do?<eos> Normal Portals can only take you to places you've been.<eos> I guess I never really thought about it.<eos> I see Isabelle is the smart one in the family.<eos> Your Portal shard works the way it does because it's a piece of a Portal from another dimension.
Never call me again.<eos> What the hell is that thing?<eos> Let's go.<eos> Did you kill it?<eos> It went through?
Ragnor!<eos> Shax demon.<eos> Creature took me... by surprise.<eos> How could a Shax demon get past Ragnor's wards?<eos> It must have followed us.
I feel more nervous wearing that dress than I ever have on the battlefield.<eos> I think that's pretty normal.<eos> Lydia, I need to talk to you about something. What is it?<eos> Valentine sent a Shax demon to track us on our mission today.<eos> It killed Ragnor Fell. By the Angel...
Nothing, Mother.<eos> - Drink up.<eos> - Don't drink that.<eos> It's poison.<eos> It's not.
And why we're going.<eos> Damian Hall's body was found in a place called Aokigahara.<eos> You're heard of it, Clara.<eos> Aokigahara is a park at the base of Mount Fuji.<eos> Its name means "sea of trees," but it has another more nefarious name...
Fuck you!<eos> So, you're the one? Abdi's savior.<eos> What is he to you?<eos> A good name, Abdi.<eos> It's supposed to mean loyalty.
This is a whole 98 % of why I came to this program, and I'm really excited about this. Um...<eos> "It's a relationship where I can be strong and powerful in my life, yet when I look at him, I melt.<eos> It's a relationship where I am free, like I am dancing in the stars because I feel the strength and presence of my man, and know that nothing could ever shake that.<eos> It's a relationship that makes me feel like a giddy girl, where his heart and chest are the place where I can feel the masculine heart of the universe.<eos> His body, when it touches me, it is safety, warmth, strength, power, calm, adventure, and allows me to access the entire universe.
Just watch it for that, and maybe that'll make them think about what's possible for themselves.<eos> What about giving people a better understanding of who Tony Robbins is?<eos> I don't know that many people give a shit.<eos> Honestly, if that's what your film's success is based on, I think you're in trouble.<eos> I think it's gotta be based on something bigger than that.

Can you see that little yellow star at the end of that curve?<eos> It comes from near there.<eos> Formed in the heart of a red hole and stabilised in pure dwarf star crystal!<eos> The gemstone is intuitive...<eos> it knows what you want and draws energy from the nearest star to make it happen.
Ok. Goodnight.<eos> Grant, you need to concentrate!<eos> What's happened to me?<eos> Intuitive crystal, plus too many comic books.<eos> The gemstone is giving you what it thinks you want.
So I'm a superhero now?<eos> Well, once the gemstone is gone from inside you, you'll be back to normal.<eos> - It will pass.<eos> - But how will it get out?<eos> Like I said, it will pass.
- Help me!<eos> - Oh, you'll be fine!<eos> The ship will have blown up long before you've been strangled to death!<eos> - And what's plan B? !<eos> - I have no idea, but it's going to be a very big relief when I think of it.
The Author's power is far greater than that bearded old man wanted you to believe.<eos> I destroyed the quill. Oh, yes, yes, I know what you did.<eos> We hear it all down here.<eos> But I'm guessing you don't know much about the quill, do you?<eos> The sorcerer bequeathed the quill to all of you, but it is not a simple pen.

The sorcerer bequeathed the quill to all of you, but it is not a simple pen.<eos> It is a magical energy. It is a living, breathing entity.<eos> It's alive?<eos> Oh, yes. And when you broke it, Henry, you sent it right down here to the Underworld, its purpose unfulfilled.<eos> It epitomized unfinished business.
They see us as the culprits.<eos> Culpable for what?<eos> It's fog.<eos> Fog is fog.<eos> It comes and it goes away.
Are you saying you were after my job?<eos> Of course I wasn't.<eos> But who the hell am I kidding, you know?<eos> I mean, I'm not Frodo.<eos> Once I got that ring of power, we all know it would've consumed me.
- And what's your goddamn plan? - Excuse me?<eos> Jessica, our reputation's taking a beating.<eos> We need to rehabilitate it.<eos> That means pro bono, and you know it.<eos> One free case is not going to move the needle, no matter how worthy it is.
He's representing himself?<eos> I'm not saying that.<eos> Then what exactly are you saying?<eos> I'm saying I have a plan, but I need you to sign off on it.<eos> Oh, whatever it is, I'm in.
He's a Harvard lawyer.<eos> He's qualified to speculate.<eos> - Overruled.<eos> - No, you're right.<eos> It'd probably get overturned, but if you think that's why I said what I said, then obviously you don't know me.
You're less than a day from prison, and you're thinking about dresses and flowers?<eos> - Harvey...<eos> - You know what? I'll be your best man on one condition.<eos> That ship has sailed.<eos> The hell it has.
What happened to your real family? Besides zombies?<eos> Right.<eos> Kind of a dumb question.<eos> Got a name?<eos> It's Ten Thousand.
- Hey...<eos> - Jane's tracker just came back online.<eos> - How? I implanted a second tracker on her belt.<eos> You what?<eos> It's programmed to start transmitting two hours after she left.
When they couldn't find any debris, they figured the transponder had been turned off.<eos> So if we turn it back on...<eos> Yeah, hopefully someone can see where we are.<eos> Doc, give us a hand, which one is the transponder?<eos> Here, it's off.
I need to find the people who did this, the people who tattooed Jane.<eos> Please.<eos> This job is all that I have.<eos> No.<eos> It's all you had.
The last time we followed one of his paintings, it led us to a bomb.<eos> We can't just go in there waving our FBI flag.<eos> Well, then... let's not go in as FBI at all.<eos> This dog can really smell bombs?<eos> Well, if it can't, then it's one terrible bomb-sniffing dog.
But this many Ahmadis in the U.S. is a very disturbing development.<eos> They wouldn't take that risk unless an attack was coming.<eos> We need to find out where Maya was before she was discovered.<eos> It could be where the clan was hiding.<eos> Finding that might be the only way to stop this attack before it happens.
I figured you might be missing home, so I got some orange flower water.<eos> D.C.<eos> I start in two weeks...<eos> Or should I say, "We do"?<eos> There's a flash drive. It'll decrypt Ryan's computer passwords.
Alex, you got a sec?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Okay, we've been going over Miranda's timeline, all right?<eos> Her entire week.<eos> It doesn't match the Voice at all.
I answered, and this voice tells me to rent a van and park it on Arthur Avenue in the Bronx.<eos> At first, I refused, and then they texted me photos of my sister, her little kids.<eos> After that, I stopped asking questions.<eos> What was the make and model of the van?<eos> It was gray.
I think somebody's trying to scare you, toy with you.<eos> Why?<eos> I picked up this case, like, an hour ago,<eos> - how could...<eos> - It be connected to you?
Oh, they went to Luxor. Started up again there.<eos> So they moved their new capital... ..right next to the Valley of the Kings.<eos> - You're back.<eos> I'm so sorry. I wasn't meaning to pry.<eos> I found the catalogue for 55 and I thought it might be useful for you
- It's the end of an age, gentlemen.<eos> Let's see this season out and move on.<eos> - You shouldn't be reading this.<eos> - Why not?<eos> If there's a war, it's going to affect all of us.
Lady Evelyn.<eos> Mr Carter.<eos> Having sunk the greater part of my fortune into this dig, I expect this means I shall be ruined.<eos> We should have seen this coming.<eos> We all knew which way the wind's blowing, and it's blowing the British out of Egypt.
- Well, yes.<eos> Yes I do. - I can't, it's awful!<eos> My name is awful?<eos> You think my name is awful.<eos> It's a little bit awful.
Yes.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> These past years have been an extraordinary privilege.<eos> To be... so close to beauty I wish it could've lasted longer.<eos> And as for Tutankhamun himself it was Lord Carnarvon's wish - and it is mine also - that his body remain where it was laid to rest.
Who's the science now, bitch?<eos> - Oh, boy, look at that.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> So, the tumor is living, but the surrounding tissue's necrotic.<eos> It was feeding off him. Buried down there in the cold dirt under the Hendrix garage.
Very duro.<eos> You best uh, come with me to the lavatory.<eos> Please take me to the lavatory.<eos> Is that your leaning tower?<eos> It's not leaning any more.
Another one thought she could do it all on her own.<eos> We had to make a deal, S.<eos> You bartered my mother behind my back.<eos> Cosima needs a cure, I need this bot out of my face.<eos> It's trying to make me sick, S.
It's over.<eos> Where are we?<eos> What is this place?<eos> It used to be the edge of the known world.<eos> It still is.
I love to hear your stories.<eos> You're amazing!<eos> I promise you will do it. Someday?<eos> Why you don't drink the juice?<eos> It's good for your health!
I don't know that I'm the --<eos> Benjamin has shown aptitude with neither blades nor munitions.<eos> Perhaps his failings lie in the weapons... perhaps it's the teacher... and perhaps it's both.<eos> Hey, look, you know.... the man I shot to save Carol -- the stick couldn't have saved her.<eos> Has it saved you?
People want someone to follow.<eos> It's human nature.<eos> They want someone to make 'em feel safe.<eos> And people who feel safe are less dangerous... more productive.<eos> They see a dude with a tiger, shoot -- they start tellin' stories about finding it in the wild, wrestling it into submission, turning it into his pet.
Oh, crap.<eos> Are you okay down there?<eos> Your penis?<eos> I mean, that guy, he... clomped on it.<eos> Or is it... Down for the count?
No.<eos> Separation was small.<eos> Baby's heart rate is normal.<eos> Here, listen.<eos> There it is.
What are you looking for?<eos> My mirror.<eos> Where is my mirror?<eos> It's not there?
What are you looking for?<eos> My mirror.<eos> Where is my mirror?<eos> It's not there?<eos> Not unless it's suddenly turned invisible.
I mean, he's all over.<eos> Oh, God.<eos> Stop.<eos> Look, just because I sit behind a desk all day does not mean your job is harder than mine.<eos> As a matter of fact, it does.
I'm tryin'.<eos> Caputo's got a different brand going on.<eos> There go my girl.<eos> P, please tell these bitches that my job is just as hard as digging' a ditch.<eos> - It's not.
This is it.<eos> This is it.<eos> Now what do we do?<eos> Once I cut into her, I need you to force the incision open.<eos> Keep it from closing out so I can get to whatever's killing her.
Most of us.<eos> We need to know there's a plan.<eos> Right now.<eos> Well, I got a truck parked downstairs, John.<eos> I just need to wait for the valet to bring it around.
This is where we're supposed to hold up and stay safe for a few days?<eos> - Come on. - Yes, sir.<eos> We're gonna need a bigger bunker for starters.<eos> Very funny, asshole.<eos> It's underground.
Yeah, we have all made mistakes, friend.<eos> I have spent many a night wherein I ruminated on the errors I've made.<eos> But then it strikes me, it was the wrongs done to me that put me down the well of tribulations.<eos> So I set myself upon a mission of vengeance.<eos> And let me tell you, friend, it shall be biblical.
You got to clench those cheeks together, nice and tight.<eos> So you get them so hard you can crack a walnut on them.<eos> - Ooh.<eos> - Ooh, my. That fanny's hard as Detroit steel, Daddy.<eos> Yeah, it ain't the only thing.
I dub thee agent.<eos> You can even take my office, because I quit.<eos> - What?<eos> - Who needs the headache?<eos> Thirty years I threw into this job and it destroyed me from the inside out.
Okay, so how do we deal with this Bill guy, because I can't stop thinking about pancakes.<eos> - It's Baal. - It's Baal.<eos> Oh, Jesus.<eos> We need the Kandarian dagger.<eos> - Where is it?
Oh, Jesus.<eos> We need the Kandarian dagger.<eos> - Where is it?<eos> - Oh, someone confiscated it.<eos> Tell me where it is.
- Where is it?<eos> - Oh, someone confiscated it.<eos> Tell me where it is.<eos> Okay.<eos> It's in the evidence locker.
And in this moment as I was beaten by the living,<eos> I was bitten by the dead.<eos> A hand found me and I saw Luciana.<eos> She brought me back here. We waited for death to come.<eos> - But it didn't?
- Are you trying to kill Victor? We need the supplies. - Translate for me.<eos> - Translate.<eos> Who are they talking about?<eos> What is his name? What is the boy's name?<eos> Is it Nick?
I've been telling people I didn't need the trappings of fame, that I was better off, happy with my little B-plus life at my little B-plus hardware store in little B-plus Olympia, Washington.<eos> B-minus children.<eos> But it's a lie.<eos> I miss the warmth of the spotlight on my face.<eos> The thrill of telling a joke and feeling it land.
Unicorns are for babies.<eos> The movie I want to make isn't glamorous or sexy.<eos> You don't get to be the big hero everybody loves. You get to be a guy who works at a gas station, who gets in a fight with his daughter about jellybeans.<eos> That's the whole movie.<eos> It's small and it's real. And you'd get to work with a director who sees you.
But you don't have to die for it.<eos> I'm not planning on dying.<eos> - The faith we have, it has protected us.<eos> - It's a lie.<eos> It doesn't mean it hasn't worked.
...while also being driven around by them. -Wow!<eos> Something for everyone.<eos> -Demand is skyrocketing.<eos> That's why we need a bigger office space.<eos> You come to work, clock in, you put sugar in your coffee, and watch it slowly disappear into nothingness.
Getting this nomination from the two friends he loves the most-- you and also me-- would really mean a lot to him.<eos> [sighs] Okay.<eos> But did you really think he was that good in the movie?<eos> Oh, I haven't seen it.<eos> It seemed long.
Remember.<eos> The hosts' malfunctions were colorful.<eos> What did you say?<eos> The human mind, Bernard, is not some golden benchmark glimmering on some green and distant hill.<eos> No, it is a foul, pestilent corruption.
You forget about it. You want to actually do this?<eos> Are you out of your fucking mind?<eos> This coffee is really good, though.<eos> - In what way, specifically?<eos> - I don't know. It's bold without being bitter.
Imagine my surprise discovering a second crime scene.<eos> It seems that this young woman was strangled, her body sunk, only to pop up two days ago.<eos> I'm surprised we didn't hear about that.<eos> Well, we probably would have, were it not for the fact that this creek separates Idlewild Park from North Woodmere Park.<eos> It also happens to be the border between Queens County and Nassau County.
There was a tree in the grassland.<eos> A sad and lonely tree.<eos> It spoke to me.<eos> What did this tree say?<eos> It led me there.
Well, it's not.<eos> He's a bloody preacher, for Christ's sake.<eos> He's a preacher, all right?<eos> You know, his job is to... is to, uh...<eos> T-To tell you the truth, I don't... I don't know exactly what his job is, but I know it's not walking around, just casting judgement.
We can't stop Myriad's signal, but we can piggyback off of it.<eos> We're lucky. This TV station is old.<eos> Not that old.<eos> Not old-old.<eos> But old enough that it uses broadcast technology instead of digital.
We don't have time for this.<eos> Jaha's backpack.<eos> What about it?<eos> All right, it runs the A.I. And if we destroy it, I'm pretty sure we can destroy her.<eos> I know where it is.
Oh, thanks for the heads-up.<eos> What is it you wanted to show me?<eos> Uh, I created a program to check Drea's computer for spyware.<eos> What made you think there would be spyware?<eos> Well, she never accessed any social media accounts from her computer, so I thought maybe she felt it wasn't secure.
The rain has stopped.<eos> I stop.<eos> On the corner, a boy in a yellow raincoat holding his mother's hand.<eos> I think it's probably best if we, uh, stand as far away from the bus as we can.<eos> It's not gonna catch on fire or anything, is it?
I stop.<eos> On the corner, a boy in a yellow raincoat holding his mother's hand.<eos> I think it's probably best if we, uh, stand as far away from the bus as we can.<eos> It's not gonna catch on fire or anything, is it?<eos> It could explode into a fireball! Oh, no, ma'am.
I don't, not with me.<eos> Would you like to use my phone, Mr Bus Driver?<eos> Oh, if you don't mind. Thank you.<eos> So, what's gonna happen to this bus?<eos> Um, well, a... a big truck is gonna come and tow it back to the depot. - Awesome.
And thank you, my love.<eos> You look a little drained.<eos> You're home a little late.<eos> Was your day OK?<eos> Well, it was until the bus broke down.
We'll get there.<eos> We should know in about 15 minutes.<eos> - You got the tranquilizer?<eos> - Right here.<eos> Yeah, but it's gonna take about five minutes to really take effect.
You said you felt it.<eos> Yes.<eos> He's there.<eos> We just got to keep looking.<eos> Ramse... even if this place exists, it could be anywhere in the world, and we don't have maps or records from after the plague.
- Yes, sir.<eos> - Right away, sir.<eos> Was that gunfire?<eos> What are you doing?<eos> This new way to Titan, does it involve the Machine?
Call yourself "Bleeders"?<eos> Kill everybody that passes?<eos> You eat 'em too, huh?<eos> Headed to a place about 30 miles west from here.<eos> It's called Titan.
Headed to a place about 30 miles west from here.<eos> It's called Titan.<eos> You know what I'm talking about?<eos> - Do you?<eos> - I don't know what it's called, but there's a place with lights and sounds.
It is him.<eos> Those coordinates say Titan should be right here.<eos> I told you it wasn't.<eos> The tracker you were using was hooked up to the transponder in the Humvee that burned down.<eos> It sent you in the wrong direction.
How do you know?<eos> I've got built-in satellite, Wi-Fi, and AM-FM radio, and he's on every channel.<eos> Soon I will begin scanning and cataloging every species on this planet, in order to create a precise record for posterity.<eos> Well, that doesn't sound so bad.<eos> Once finished, I will shrink your planet to a more efficient file size, place it inside a glass bottle, and store it safely in my library of civilizations for all eternity.
If the Captain knew you were lying, he'd...<eos> Well, I don't know what he'd do, but I'm afraid to find out.<eos> Afraid?<eos> Hal, you aren't afraid of anything.<eos> Your power ring, where is it?
Hal, you aren't afraid of anything.<eos> Your power ring, where is it?<eos> That green ring?<eos> The Captain took it when he fished me out of the sea as payment to be on his crew.<eos> It's locked up in his chest.
I just finished cataloging everything on the Earth,<eos> I am ready to shrink.<eos> Well, we have a surprise for you, Brainiac.<eos> The Shrink-ray 2.0.<eos> - You will notice, it is even superior to...
- Why?<eos> Well, it's just indiscreet.<eos> - And I haven't got the job yet.<eos> - What about that tree?<eos> It's blocking all the light.
I moved in for the kill.<eos> But then one wrong brushstroke and it got away once again.<eos> I've just been talking to Jock about your 80th birthday.<eos> No, don't mention it.<eos> Because it happens on the same day as the opening of Parliament, they've decided to combine events and hold a reception in your honor at the Great Hall.
Well, are there any works that you're referring to in particular?<eos> I was thinking especially of the Goldfish pond here at Chartwell.<eos> The pond? Why the pond?<eos> It's just a pond.<eos> It's very much more than that.
More than 20 times.<eos> Well, yes, because it's such a technical challenge.<eos> - It eludes me.<eos> - Well, perhaps you elude yourself, sir.<eos> That's why it's more revealing than a self-portrait.
My Sleep Number bed is stuck on the nap setting.<eos> Calm down.<eos> This is exactly why I sprung for a new generator.<eos> Which, you're welcome, just kicked in.<eos> Now, granted, it doesn't power everything.
Yeah, but we did say he'd need a place that was secluded to hold his victims while he tortured them, which that place definitely wasn't.<eos> What if we're looking for a team, with dominant to our submissive?<eos> Esposito, he said that matadors have assistants, people who work to weaken the bull before the final kill.<eos> Yeah, but we were correct about the profile.<eos> We were right about the stressor, it led us to Simon.
- I don't know about that.<eos> Keeping the country safe is big business right now. - It's getting bigger.<eos> - Don't you start, Saul.<eos> There's a reason that we haven't had another 9/11.<eos> - It's called vigilance.
For starters.<eos> And anything else you can think of.<eos> Okay. First of all, I don't think that failure to show up at a court date constitute--<eos> The case is dead, Donald.<eos> It's dismissed.
Well, what's the good news?<eos> Your friend Alma called.<eos> How the fuck did he get the case reinstated in state court?<eos> It was dead in state court.<eos> I saw it die.
What are we gonna do?<eos> Mom's gonna be home any minute.<eos> "Hola, papi. Have you seen my computer?"<eos> "Oh, sure, Mom.<eos> It's over there, where that naked girl's entertaining her school's basketball team."
She and my father patched things up, but I don't know.<eos> I guess I kept him at arm's length.<eos> And then, when he wrote that book, it was like he was thinking about himself again.<eos> Speaking of people who think they can get away with things, look at the seat.<eos> Note how close it is to the pedals.
Let me think, let me think.<eos> The Borns Tech case perhaps?<eos> No, it wasn't that.<eos> Let's see.<eos> It was the Senator Judiciary Nomination Committee.
I'm hereby designating this matter as complex.<eos> So, we will be dispensing with conventional rules of discovery.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> The complex case program. It's been around since 1996.<eos> When a case is considered too complicated for a lay jury to understand, it is deferred to a complex litigation manager, which I happen to be.
So what do you plan on doing with that finger?<eos> Chief!<eos> So, you've got zombie-dar.<eos> That explains so much.<eos> Of course, you're not just wandering around the streets waiting for it to go... off.

Major comes home with a dog one day, right?<eos> A dog you later learned belonged to one of the victims.<eos> I...<eos> There was a dog, yeah.<eos> Uh, but it was returned to its owner.
Uh, but it was returned to its owner.<eos> I think.<eos> I mean, I wasn't there, I have no... No idea?<eos> You asked me about the dog.<eos> You wanted assurance it was in a good home, didn't you?
Was one crossed over the other?<eos> Yeah, I think so.<eos> The cap had to be from Camp Russell.<eos> The old firing range at Quantico?<eos> Isn't it shut down?
You know, it happens all the time.<eos> Some judge probably ordered a prisoner release due to overcrowding, and Meeks must have just slipped through the cracks.<eos> Sulzbach may have discovered that he had access to Meeks' file.<eos> According to Sulzbach's cell phone records, his last call was to the department of corrections psychologist.<eos> It lasted all of 5 seconds.
That's not true.<eos> You survived.<eos> You created this space, the space in your head the monster couldn't get to.<eos> But that place never went away.<eos> It was still here for you when you needed it.
There's the moment when you realize you love a woman, and the moment you realize you're gonna marry her.<eos> I want to hear about the second one.<eos> It was the end of last year.<eos> I'd gotten in late from a case.<eos> It was a bad one.
It is not my concern.<eos> My concern is this case.<eos> You're not getting two years to try this case.<eos> I'm not asking for that, Your Honor.<eos> Listen, this case either moves forward, or it stops.
It's not possible.<eos> But it is.<eos> You're holding it.<eos> Tell me about the film you saw.<eos> It's like a newsreel.
I can't deal with it.<eos> So I granted her that small thing.<eos> At last.<eos> Happy?<eos> It really suited me.
A government contract in the Middle East during a war?<eos> That's great, honey.<eos> Kip, eat your food.<eos> Well, I think the war is wrong. Yeah?<eos> Well, regardless of what you think, it's going to happen.
But I couldn't.<eos> I was asleep.<eos> You didn't think the war was right?<eos> I never really thought about it being right or wrong.<eos> It just made us rich.
Which is probably why that movie sucks.<eos> Here we are talking about Frozen, and yet, you got burned.<eos> Miss, I'm so sorry.<eos> How can you not like that movie?<eos> I just think it gets more credit than it deserves.
Maybe Dunning had an enemy, they followed him in...<eos> And shot him twice in a building occupied by 15 heavily armed bikers?<eos> I have to believe there were easier times and places to do the man in.<eos> Has the rug turned up?<eos> It has not.
Wh-- are you saying someone else did?<eos> After you turned in last night, Marcus informed me that the missing rug had been found.<eos> The one from the video?<eos> The police traced it from the gang's Dumpster to a landfill.<eos> It had been soiled in precisely the way the bikers said it would be.

Unfortunately, the GPS was turned off on his cell.<eos> We still don't know what he was doing in that neighborhood.<eos> What about calls?<eos> Last call he made was at 5:30 to a law firm in midtown.<eos> It only lasted a minute.
Sell him the superconductor project.<eos> It's not ready, but we need his investment.<eos> Let him feel like the whole thing hinges on him.<eos> The price isn't 100 anymore.<eos> It's 400.
- We're sitting here together now.<eos> Thullander Industries is the only one of our businesses with a focus on solar cells.<eos> Energreen is strongest with wind.<eos> Thullander is developing solar panels.<eos> It's a lousy idea to cut a well-functioning division because it doesn't fit a random profile.
- Yeah.<eos> She put the article up anyway, so what the hell was that for?<eos> She must have put it up before.<eos> It's been shared on the media.<eos> It will spread out of the country soon.
You know firsthand that breakups are hard.<eos> Fine.<eos> If you insist on making me a part of this, yes, I knowledge how painful they can be.<eos> However, pain has an evolutionary purpose.<eos> It provides information from the environment that, uh, behavior isn't good for us.
Yeah. Thank you. Okay, please...<eos> Can you stretch your mind just a little bit there?<eos> Do you think the state of Israel has a right to exist?<eos> I think that that is an absurd question.<eos> It already exists.
You understand.<eos> How could you order a guarantee claim on such short notice?<eos> I'd like to ask you to leave.<eos> You're still insulted that you weren't included in the IPO.<eos> But it was conducted with great results.
By the time he got his bearings, he was immediately arrested for the double homicide of his brother and father, being the weapon was in his name.<eos> And how do you know Clyde?<eos> He was my cellmate.<eos> This place made him crazy.<eos> He thinks it's cursed. Yeah.
Is she okay?<eos> If you say you need him, you must need him.<eos> I'll have RT stop by.<eos> Son, y'all know y'all can't jump.<eos> I tracked the last package to the Midtown post office it was mailed from.
I'll have RT stop by.<eos> Son, y'all know y'all can't jump.<eos> I tracked the last package to the Midtown post office it was mailed from.<eos> However, there's no evidence on the security footage of anyone mailing it from inside the station.<eos> It was probably dropped in a nearby collection box.
I can name it whatever I want?<eos> All right, tell you what.<eos> When we pull up, the first thing that comes into your mind, that'll be the name.<eos> Really?<eos> Now, it's coming up here on the right.
Now, it's coming up here on the right.<eos> Just keep those eyes on the road.<eos> Now, I don't have the keys yet, so we can't go in.<eos> I just closed on the place.<eos> It's a bit of a fixer-upper, but it'll get there.
Yes, Dr. Witlin is my oncologist.<eos> How bad is it?<eos> I'm afraid it's a bird.<eos> With cancer, it's either a turtle, a rabbit, or a bird.<eos> A turtle you can easily catch, a rabbit you can chase, but a bird, once it flies away...
Where's she buried, man?<eos> The storage room of my crab restaurant in Inglewood.<eos> The Crab Grab.<eos> I remember that place.<eos> - It's closed now.
- No one else has access to it?<eos> - No.<eos> We're a really small business.<eos> I've got nothing to do with this.<eos> I can barely turn a computer on without crashing it.
Is there a carriage release?<eos> I don't know.<eos> What is that?<eos> It's a handle that releases the door.<eos> It should be on a track above the car.
Look, the long and short -- it's like a game of hot potato.<eos> You got to keep paying it forward.<eos> If you don't, you die.<eos> Melissa, this curse started with you.<eos> And I think it wants to end with you.
They all do.<eos> Hundreds of heartbroken women come to me, but they never learn.<eos> I mean, a month, a year, however long later, they all come back -- same story, different man.<eos> So you tweak the curse?<eos> Now it not only punishes the cheaters, but the foolish women who want them back.
Hey.<eos> That staycation beard's really taking shape, dad.<eos> It's starting to trap food.
Hey.<eos> That staycation beard's really taking shape, dad.<eos> It's starting to trap food.<eos> Yep.<eos> It's gone from itchin' to bitchin'.
- Of course. But I can think of a few ladies I wouldn't mind multiplying with after our elders give us their blessings.<eos> - I heard that. - Oh!<eos> We love girls!<eos> As long as you guys are here, I need an outsider's opinion.<eos> I'm working on a song, but these guys think it's too soft.
Staying here a few more days may help me kick this sickness a little faster.<eos> - There you go.<eos> - Wait a second.<eos> I thought I already packed my laptop.<eos> Why is it on the hallway table?
We were hoping you could explain how it got there.<eos> We shot this a few months ago.<eos> I think it'll help explain a few things about the Gus machine.<eos> You named your killer robot Gus?<eos> Oh, it wasn't designed to kill.
We shot this a few months ago.<eos> I think it'll help explain a few things about the Gus machine.<eos> You named your killer robot Gus?<eos> Oh, it wasn't designed to kill.<eos> It's supposed to carry gear for the infantry, like a pack mule.
And to me, uh... to me, she was the woman, you know?<eos> And she died.<eos> Well, I thought she did.<eos> And I lost myself.<eos> Yeah, the pain was, um... it was very intense, so I began to self-medicate, and then my work began to suffer, and I-I made these small mistakes.
Husband's dead, though; she lived alone.<eos> Not entirely alone.<eos> Shih Tzu, if I'm not mistaken.<eos> There was a dog.<eos> Says here somebody picked it up.
I said her name.<eos> I forgot.<eos> It's all right. Garcia, were you able to trace it?<eos> No.<eos> I was so close. But I have the cell tower it pinged off of.
I mean, this is highly theoretical magic.<eos> It has never been used,<eos> - But it can work. - You have the ingredients?<eos> All but one.<eos> So it was never used.
Your suggestion was news to me.<eos> Not what I asked!<eos> How long have you known the answer?<eos> For example, My thinking was, hey, the transfer spell worked on Ric's babies.<eos> Maybe it'll work on the scar.
Well, you know, you've gotta understand that Dad's...<eos> He's in free fall now 'cause of the ranch. He's in crisis mode.<eos> And... did you just call yourself a beaver?<eos> It's a totem pole thing.<eos> And by the way, the bottom of the totem pole is the most important part, 'cause it holds up the whole pole.
- Yeah.<eos> All I really want is just to be right here with you.<eos> But if this is all, you know, too much,<eos> I-I, um, I-I totally understand.<eos> I did bring that record player all the way from home, and it's really heavy. And that is one of my favorite songs.
Here it is. Look at the, uh, date on the back.<eos> - Oh! And Lorelai... - Huh?<eos> The virus protection software I told you about.<eos> Want me to pop it on your computer?<eos> -Where is it?
- Oh, God.<eos> - What?<eos> - What?<eos> - I swallowed a bug. - Oh. Well...<eos> - It's lodged in there.
Nice to see you, Francie.<eos> I miss Doyle.<eos> Calm down.<eos> I miss the sex.<eos> It was volcanic.
It just got so boring in that room.<eos> And there's nothing good to watch on TV.<eos> - And the drapes smell funny.<eos> - And I'm afraid of my pack.<eos> I think it's gonna come to life in the night and kill me.
And for the love of God, hurry back.<eos> - Finn, isn't that a guy?<eos> - Only till next Tuesday.<eos> How's your foot?<eos> - I do not think it's broken.
- No! I talk now!<eos> You should be ashamed of yourself.<eos> - Forget what you've done to this hot mess.<eos> - Thanks, Michel.<eos> Turning her into a sighing, moping, broken shell of a person who won't let anyone park in your space even though it is right next to the back door and other people's aren't.

She must have found out about the lawsuit.<eos> Nelson, you filed without talking to Avery?<eos> Why?<eos> Avery is the USA. This is weird. Riley has a second e-mail account.<eos> She's been logging in and out almost every day for the past two months, but it's empty.
Alessandra, yes.<eos> Bien, bien.<eos> Grazie.<eos> Grazie.<eos> I wanted to share this place, because it is very dear to me.
Every member gets his or her own key.<eos> My associates and I each keep a copy of the second key on our person at all times.<eos> One of us is always within 30 minutes of this spot.<eos> And we're never all together at the same time.<eos> That way the bunker's always secure until it's needed.
Bet you don't even have a generator.<eos> What is it?<eos> That lock plate's new. Paint's been retouched.<eos> Someone forced that door open, and the concrete here is chipped.<eos> It's been scrubbed.
I believe he is in North America.<eos> Sasha Antonov.<eos> I've never heard that name.<eos> The name Antonov comes with a heavy price.<eos> It affects my children as well, so we've been living in hiding with Katia, Alexei, all of their lives.
We're going there now. It's time to war up.<eos> Easy, hannibal.<eos> We should also talk about leaking your plan to politico - if this doesn't work.<eos> - No, that'll backfire.<eos> Maybe, but it'll be out there.
Jesus, Norma.<eos> No, I just told you we'd go to the Christmas tree thing.<eos> Oh, right.<eos> Did you know that Norman had this letter?<eos> It's... it's meant for Emma.
No, I just told you we'd go to the Christmas tree thing.<eos> Oh, right.<eos> Did you know that Norman had this letter?<eos> It's... it's meant for Emma.<eos> It's from her mom, and, uh, I found it here the other day.
How about smiling?<eos> See, but it wasn't the whore's burgundy corset that gave me pause, gentlemen, nor was it the healthy merkin perched between that sweet dove's legs.<eos> No, it was that she had a tail.<eos> An honest-to-goodness tail as perky as a pretty puppy dog's<eos> But it wasn't wagging, so I was game.
- He probably couldn't! - No!<eos> He said it had to be an Earp!<eos> That if I buried the talisman in the pet cemetery, it would stop Mom and Dad from fighting!<eos> Move your butt, girl!<eos> It's here, beside Picachu the hamster's final resting place.
Dr. Jackson Avery?<eos> That's right. Do we...<eos> You've been served.<eos> What's your next move?<eos> Do you take your best shot and see where it lands?
Yes, Mrs. Park?<eos> This ring belonged to my mother-in-law.<eos> I've been keeping it for Joon's future wife.<eos> Shall we make it official?<eos> It's so beautiful.
This ring belonged to my mother-in-law.<eos> I've been keeping it for Joon's future wife.<eos> Shall we make it official?<eos> It's so beautiful.<eos> Do you like it?
Let's focus on... bubbles.<eos> One... two... hmm.<eos> Can I have another piece, Mom-Mom? I lost mine.<eos> Oh.<eos> I think I found it. Oh, no!
- Not for me. Then give me the Lead.<eos> Out of all the chances I have given you, you have one chance left.<eos> What are you gonna do with it?<eos> - I don't have it.<eos> - What? All I know is, it's still somewhere in the triangle.
Stop it!<eos> You stop it!<eos> It's good glue.<eos> Thank you.<eos> It's incredible!
Yes, she is!<eos> She's not gonna let him die. Hey, get up!<eos> You promised me you could do this.<eos> Valerie, stop the spell right now. It's too strong for you.<eos> It's killing you.
So, it could be a robot with wheels on it.
Is that the contract?<eos> How's it look? I mean, we all good?<eos> Well, actually, there's some issues with it.<eos> Like what? Give me an example.<eos> Well, like, it doesn't specifically say the name of the restaurant, and the location is kind of unclear.
Enough to salvage a little pride.<eos> You were proud of cheating?<eos> Just talk to Trevor.<eos> He'll tell you.<eos> I've been complaining about that robbery ever since it happened.
There.<eos> Still there. What's still there?<eos> Proof.<eos> That the robbery was not designed to fund some heretofore unidentified scheme.<eos> It was designed to conceal some heretofore unidentified scheme.
And God bless you.<eos> The letter is for Mister Grant.<eos> As you can see, the seal is unbroken.<eos> It's, it's not for you.<eos> It's for Mr. Grant.
Say hi to Emily for us.<eos> Will do.<eos> This contract looks good to me.<eos> I'll say it looks good.<eos> It's in my proprietary font, Shelvetica.
You're just mainly awkward cos I have sprung some cancer talk at you.<eos> Anyway, I five-starred every doctor, every nurse, every high-four consultant that we had.<eos> Ding. Ding. Ding.<eos> The cancer didn't give a shit.<eos> It just kept growing.
I want you to tell me the truth.<eos> Does Missy Dietler know you couldn't hold your mud?<eos> Oh, heavens no.<eos> The Turkish silt was thick enough to prevent her from feeling it, so...<eos> Was it thick enough to hide you wanting to go sleep after?
One is for perishables.<eos> The other one is for curing and aging our own meat.<eos> That is completely impractical.<eos> Dude, dude, our place is called Thirio, right, meaning "beast."<eos> Now, if it's called Scallop, sure, fine, whatever, but it's not.
Now we nose the wine.<eos> It's wine jargon.<eos> Y-- you smell it.<eos> What does the wine tell you?<eos> - It's better than my stuff.
As hard as it is to believe, Maura could be wrong.<eos> She's not wrong.<eos> Alice went to Canada to try and fool us.<eos> She snuck back to try and surprise us.<eos> This is all part of her plan, and it failed.
Kent, are you trying to say that the test was inconclusive?<eos> - Maybe a little bit too conclusive.<eos> - What does that even mean?<eos> Well, it means that our test didn't return - one DNA profile from our victim's body.<eos> - It returned five.
- What...<eos> Okay, yeah. I needed the audio/vis... whatever.<eos> After all this, I feel like I owe you a drink.<eos> Oh, uh, uh, my flight leaves in an hour, so...<eos> So what if it left in two?
Most of these logins look like warehouse supervisors, - but this one's anonymous.<eos> - That's how our crooks got the code.<eos> Is there any way to trace that login?<eos> Yes, but it could take more time than we have.<eos> Okay, well, we know when they got the code, so let's just look for it every time it was used going forward.
Hey, Korsak, look at this.<eos> - You see the insulation?<eos> That vent looks bigger than the other ones?<eos> Yeah.<eos> It's magnetized.
Well, I do have an extra set of clothes in my office if you'd like to dig in a fresh shirt.<eos> At this point, it'd be a public service.<eos> This ring belonged to Donna.<eos> What kind of stone is that?<eos> It's too light to be a sapphire or blue topaz.
So Michael and Edward were both targets.<eos> Well, Edward was just a little luckier than Michael.<eos> Well, get the buckshot down to the crime lab.<eos> Maybe we can get fingerprints or DNA off it<eos> - if it was handloaded.
Looks like he was 20 years sober.<eos> It also looks like he was old-school with his contacts.<eos> Probably a number for Mary in there.<eos> Okay, I'll make the call.<eos> - No, it should come from me.
Sorry.<eos> Well, as long as you're here.<eos> Well, I thought about it, and...<eos> I'd like a job.<eos> And if it's not too much trouble, I'd like it to be in front of as many people as possible.
right there.<eos> and our plan will be perfection.<eos> It's a happy day.<eos> honey?<eos> for starters My coat may be cute but it's way too thin for this weather
People love a fairy tale.<eos> It's beautiful.<eos> Oh, one more thing.<eos> Do not take this ring off, because it would be extremely painful for your children.<eos> It's very nice, thank you.
Start the truck!<eos> Start the truck!<eos> Start the damn truck!<eos> What do you think I'm trying to do?<eos> It won't start!
Got out just in time.<eos> The books are safe. At least for now.<eos> What's wrong with Eve?<eos> Well, she had a fight with Bonaparte and was hurt.<eos> She has a pulse, but it's weak.
What?<eos> A full-blown Zauberbiest?<eos> Like nothing I've ever seen before.<eos> We used the stick to heal her. What do you mean?<eos> It didn't work?
A full-blown Zauberbiest?<eos> Like nothing I've ever seen before.<eos> We used the stick to heal her. What do you mean?<eos> It didn't work?<eos> Well, we thought it did, and then she Woged and had some kind of seizure.
What the hell was that?<eos> They're in.<eos> Everybody into the tunnel!<eos> Tunnel? What tunnel?<eos> But we don't know where it leads.
I don't want a coffee bar, Diane.<eos> Sometimes, I feel like you don't listen to me.<eos> Yeah, a coffee bar probably won't work anyway.<eos> This block is such a notorious boneyard for small businesses.<eos> Oh, but it's perfect for a gallery.
- Yes.<eos> Something is wrong.<eos> - What, what?<eos> What happened?<eos> No, we followed the river, it should have taken us all the way to Caraquet.
Time to find this override.<eos> We're at the fourth station, it's got to be over there.<eos> You need to look for a red door.<eos> We don't throw that override, the accelerator won't be able to absorb the ants' energy.<eos> No one said it would be locked.
Should I be worried that you guys know how to build an electric chair?<eos> Right now you should be grateful.<eos> We are gonna fry this little sucker.<eos> Blow its fuse before...<eos> Before it can blow mine.
And my name is Seeley Booth, and I'm a special agent with the FBI's homicide division.<eos> When I'm called out to a scene where the remains are badly burnt or decomposed, I call in Bones.<eos> He calls me "Bones." Mm-hmm.<eos> Even though I'm his wife and the mother of two of his children, he still refers to me by a nickname I despise.<eos> Well, you used to despise it, but now I think you like it.
Dr. Saroyan takes herself pretty seriously. Phew.<eos> Look, all dead bodies smell, okay?<eos> But dead bodies found in a landfill and covered in leachate, which is basically a viscous trash water, they, uh, they tend to smell worse.<eos> When I first started I had to dab peppermint oil under my nose to mask the smell.<eos> I actually tried growing a mustache, thinking that it would block the smell.
The width of the beams on her racket were too thin to have created these injuries.<eos> There appears to be a fracture on the distal shaft of the fourth metacarpal.<eos> A boxers fracture.<eos> The victim must have punched his killer.<eos> If the punch was delivered with enough force to break the victim's hand, it may have been powerful enough to injure our killer.
It's pretty, but I don't know that much about diamonds.<eos> Lance gave me his mother's ring, so we never had to pick anything out.<eos> I want to show you this.<eos> You can put a serial number on a diamond?<eos> Yeah, and when it's this big, you better.
Yes, we're able to etch microscopic markings that provides a degree of security our clients require.<eos> Now, what about the diamond that we found?<eos> Who does that belong to?<eos> I remember that particular diamond quite well; I marked it myself.<eos> It's part of this.
The rich today are no different from the kings and queens of old.<eos> They like expensive, pretty things no one else can have.<eos> No, what-what I meant was, specifically, who does that dagger belong to?<eos> Ah, well, that's another twist.<eos> It was on loan to a jewelry store for a display of "Crown Jewels of the World," but jewel thieves stole it three days ago, the day it arrived.
No, what-what I meant was, specifically, who does that dagger belong to?<eos> Ah, well, that's another twist.<eos> It was on loan to a jewelry store for a display of "Crown Jewels of the World," but jewel thieves stole it three days ago, the day it arrived.<eos> Oh, that's awesome.<eos> I mean, it's not awesome that it was stolen.
Aubrey asked me to look into Chadwick Grey, the guy from the Gem Society who put the microscopic code on the diamonds.<eos> And? And... before he worked at the Gem Soc, he sold jewelry in Paris at the first shop robbed by the Marquise.<eos> We looked into Mr. Grey. You used to work selling jewelry, and the last place you worked was robbed by thieves going after historical knock-off jewels.<eos> That robbery is what made me want to help secure such items.<eos> It led me to the Gem Society.
I looked under the table.<eos> The jars knocked because the table knocked.<eos> By a really strong ghost.<eos> Hodgins, would you shut up and listen?<eos> Your foot is three inches off the ground when it rests in the footrest of the wheelchair.
Those aren't good Samaritans.<eos> Roman's men.<eos> Coming to finish what they started.<eos> My seatbelt is stuck!<eos> It won't open!
That plan was a good one when Andrew Barnes was alive, but maybe... we can persuade his replacement to go back to the original.<eos> Get the intel on the others.<eos> Thanks, Jason.<eos> The new plan is sustainable and has a green space.<eos> It has everything in the planning agreement and we make decent money.
It's not, but we're forced to use it.<eos> Andrew Barnes was murdered.<eos> He was against the original plan.<eos> Murdered?<eos> If it went through now, it might raise... unnecessary questions with the public.
- Whatever it is, we gotta stop it.<eos> - I fear that there is only one way to do that.<eos> - Okay, I don't know what you wanted me to do, but I did it. - Excellent work, Jax.<eos> - What's going on?<eos> - I am piloting us on a collision course with the torpedo, now, with any luck it will hit us before New York City.
The system you live in is sick.<eos> Why do you think more and more girls come to me, wanting to join the caliphate?<eos> Because they're young and impressionable.<eos> Because they have rejected the West's attempts to brainwash them into a life of endless consumerism.<eos> You can shovel the sand of an entire desert into a bucket, but if it has no bottom, the bucket remains empty.
He just phoned.<eos> It turns out that the job wasn't legit.<eos> Something bigger is going on, something bad enough that he told me to go Code 44.<eos> Uh, what does Code 44 mean?<eos> It means abandon everything and everyone.
You lying, little bastard.<eos> What makes you think he's lying about being alone?<eos> Look at his neck.<eos> See that tiny love bite?<eos> It's new.
What were you doing there when Hayley and Marcus were breaking in?<eos> I was the bait for that idiot Ned.<eos> The computer system required two separate security keys.<eos> You can't just hack in and upload a worm.<eos> It had to be embedded while a secure portal was open.
Don't be.<eos> See, you're the person that got me through it all.<eos> You know how?<eos> Our plan.<eos> It kept me going for six years, gave me the will to escape.
Look, it's like those-- those Internet contracts, you know?<eos> You click "agree" just to get on with your life.<eos> Did you sign the contract?<eos> Yeah, yeah, I signed it.<eos> Then it's valid.
I remembered something else about Nordkoster.<eos> When Wendt came to ask for the phone, he had a suitcase with him.<eos> He left it there when he went away.<eos> That's weird.<eos> - - Yes and when I opened it, it was empty.
Can I give it a shot?<eos> Sheriff?<eos> Matt and Emmy just called in.<eos> They said they saw some fog rolling in by Jasper Hills.<eos> Did they say where it was headed?
Before barging in, I just wanted to check for hex bags or a --<eos> That.<eos> What you want?<eos> I'm working on a spell.<eos> It requires a second.
The end times shouldn't bother you, though, Row.<eos> You a rat.<eos> Find your way off any sinking ship.<eos> Damn right.<eos> The spell I'm working on is Book of the Damned magic, and it can get us back.
Well, Rowena said it would. Oh.<eos> Yeah.<eos> It's a Book of the Damned spell, boyos.<eos> Take this wee crystal.<eos> It'll suck up all the blimey ghosts.
Junior, is that part of the tour?<eos> What's the problem here?<eos> (ENGINE STALLING)<eos> Uh, the tram.<eos> It won't start.
I'd be offended if you didn't.<eos> (SIGHS)<eos> So, Mister...<eos> Eh, what is in a name?<eos> It is nothing but a word that our mother writes in our underwear, when we go to camp. No?
I think he's avoiding me.<eos> Really?<eos> What's your secret?<eos> I think I should just go to Barb's.<eos> Let that little dog mess around on my leg for a while, maybe it'll lose interest.
And how do you know it isn't, Mother?<eos> 'Cause I grow kale in my garden.<eos> Maybe next time I come by the bar, we'll smoke a salad together.<eos> Your trailer is as good as new.<eos> Actually, it's better than new.
There's an alligator down here!<eos> Did he say "alligator"? Okay, okay!<eos> Finding a way out now!<eos> There's an exit!<eos> It's a few yards behind you, but you'll have to dig your way out. Go! Go!
You want to know more about me?<eos> Fine.<eos> My mom came to the U.S. in 1980.<eos> She met your dad, got knocked up.<eos> For a few years, he held it together, we were a family, and then one day out of the blue, he takes apart our TV, says it's sending messages that could hurt us.
Yeah.<eos> One night I was, um... I was parked outside of Marissa's place.<eos> And I saw this guy leaving.<eos> He was wearing a Baja sweater.<eos> It-it had this white and green pattern on it, and the hood was up, so I couldn't see his face.
You feeling okay, Aidan? Yeah.<eos> I'm fine. Six more plates coming out!<eos> Come on, VIP table.<eos> I have for you a Manzanilla sherry from Spain.<eos> It's a match made in heaven for the grilled sheep's-milk cheese in front of you.
They almost got divorced, did you know that?<eos> - No. Because of the beach case.<eos> Mom says he was totally obsessed with that.<eos> He wanted to solve it, it wasn't an ordinary case.<eos> How come it was so special?
Composed mostly of bleach and potassium chloride.<eos> Bensonhurst Bomber's signature recipe.<eos> Still smell the chlorine.<eos> It was hidden inside a soccer ball.<eos> The victim, Tom O'Leary, picked it up and it exploded in his hands.
Well, I'm glad it hasn't gone to your head.<eos> Where'd you get that?<eos> Uh, it must have happened when I fell after my grandfather decked me.<eos> Hey, that fabrication room's pretty cool.<eos> Can it really make clothes from any era?
Out there is history. And nobody knows more about it than me.<eos> Well, we've been managing just fine without you.<eos> Your suit looks a bit cumbersome.<eos> Oh, actually, I made it to fit me perfectly.<eos> It's constructed out of a proprietary alloy, and it's been battle-tested quite a bit.
He is a thief and a murderer.<eos> He's also a Legend, and Mick hasn't been off the ship since we dropped your team off at the JSA.<eos> With his last words, he told me his killer was a time traveler.<eos> You know, we've been tracking someone who's been trying to alter history.<eos> We think it's the same person that gave Krieger the super-serum.
- Fascinating.<eos> Which is why you'll keep what I'm about to tell you a secret.<eos> Even from the rest of your team.<eos> The ATOM suit is made of and powered by dwarf star alloy.<eos> It's strong enough to withstand bullets, arrows, and explosives.
Which is why you'll keep what I'm about to tell you a secret.<eos> Even from the rest of your team.<eos> The ATOM suit is made of and powered by dwarf star alloy.<eos> It's strong enough to withstand bullets, arrows, and explosives.<eos> - So it's impenetrable?
This is a godsend.<eos> We know how the rebels are planning to take Champion Hill, and when they do, we will be there to give them hell.<eos> Set our cannon battery up on the western ridge. - We will light them up like the Fourth of July when they roll over that hill.<eos> - What's your name, son?<eos> - Oh, it's Ja...
- Oh, gotcha.<eos> Hey, listen. Don't worry about it, okay?<eos> There's only one Harry.<eos> Oh, I wanted to tell you.<eos> The molecular decelerator, it wasn't working.
I saw a transformer explode as this thing passed by it.<eos> - That is weird.<eos> - What's weird about that?<eos> Monster didn't even lay a finger on it.<eos> It exploded before it got to it.
Heh heh heh. You would not believe how surprised and delighted we were to find out that you were one of those, um... What was... what was the term the councilman used?<eos> - Crony capitalists?<eos> - Right. That you were one of those crony capitalists who pushed poor people out of those neighborhoods, hiding behind a shell company of course.<eos> The same company who owns controlling interest in a real estate developer who just filed for permits to redevelop Orchid Bay for commercial uses.<eos> Your opposition to this rezoning, it's not political.
Everyone, thank you so much for coming.<eos> My favorite Christmas movie is "Die Hard."<eos> Heh. It's true.<eos> My second favorite Christmas movie is. "It's a Wonderful Life," and, I was very lucky to be able to rewatch that movie last week.<eos> It reminded me how much work I still have to do, how much work all of us still have to do, and it inspired me to recommit myself to making our city, our home a better and a safer place.
It's an online survey, which asks its subjects to score a series of statements, from a scale of "strongly agree" through to "strongly disagree."<eos> "Killing to protect a loved one is understandable, even if the act is premeditated."<eos> "Taking pleasure in torture is even worse than murder."<eos> I think taking this test would be torture.<eos> It is a little macabre.
Said you were rather cryptic about your reasons for being there.<eos> Nothing untoward.<eos> I was simply looking for an item that I had lost track of.<eos> Years ago, I had brought an antique ring over from London.<eos> It was intended as a gift for the Countess of Morcar.
I'm taking the test because you said Arthur Tetch took it.<eos> I'm listening to upbeat music because taking the test is analogous to eating drain hair.<eos> I came across this song and the lyrics seem fitting for reasons that will become clear.<eos> I take it you learned something when you went to see your father.<eos> As part of our efforts to determine who profited from the Colombian oil deal, we reviewed financial records from the day that it was announced.
There's this Russian deli that Johnny used to steal beer from. And we'd get the perfect buzz on and ride that thing all day long, until we were sick.<eos> That doesn't sound at all smart.<eos> Nah, it wasn't.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> This game here? Mmhmm? Johnny figured out if you put just the perfect spin on the ball... hit the back rim... it goes in every time.
We need to channel whatever energy we have right now.<eos> We can call you when the baby comes.<eos> No, I want to stay. I want to... want to be of help.<eos> Ohhh... Remember, the pain is not bigger than you.<eos> It is you.
She would've wanted you to have it.<eos> I will carry it with me always.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Do you have any idea what this peace means?<eos> It means our homes are gone all of them forever.
And home!<eos> We are less than 20 minutes away from the signing of this historic treaty.<eos> I received word of the king's order to deploy.<eos> I'll see to matters in the city.<eos> You have your mission, and it won't be easy.
Excuse me, brother.<eos> Where's the Sacramento bus?<eos> Ain't no Sacramento bus out of here.<eos> You sure?<eos> Where does it go from?
And I will.<eos> I am a very patient man.<eos> And I am right, which makes me even more patient since she is overreacting.<eos> I know it and she knows it, though she's not ready to admit it yet.<eos> So I am biding my time until she apologizes, at which point I will haul my ass back into our bedroom where it belongs.
I'm starving, too.<eos> No, I'm ready to get married.<eos> I have proposed to you twice, and you still haven't given me an answer.<eos> I bought you a ring.<eos> You told me not to get rid of it, so it's just sitting in a drawer, collecting dust.
You've done a pelvic before, haven't you?<eos> Yeah, plenty, plenty, but t-this doesn't feel right.<eos> Don't tell me it doesn't feel right.<eos> It's my freaking cervix.<eos> Just check how dilated it is, and get out of my va...
There is an ambulance coming! Ben!<eos> Ben!<eos> Even if they were here now, they can't help me.<eos> You can. I-It's coming.<eos> It's coming.
Yeah, yeah, you're right.<eos> We-we were supposed to make a delivery to that address two nights ago.<eos> Supposed to?<eos> George-- the guy that works that route-- his truck went missing that night.<eos> It was stolen?
Welcome to the family.<eos> So, did you enjoy the show this morning, Ashley?<eos> I'm really sorry about that.<eos> Don't be sorry. You got a sneak peek at the world's most epic dick.<eos> It is perfection, isn't it?
Your furnace works?<eos> Okay, nobody has that much electricity. Not around here.<eos> The ARQ powers the house.<eos> The second the furnace turns on... pull this pin, dump this canister into the chute.<eos> It feeds the entire house.
Cash for trash. Cash for trash.<eos> Ember, you're fund-raising for your Tech Fair project, right now?<eos> Especially now!<eos> My anaerobic digester doesn't need electricity.<eos> It runs on good old-fashioned compost.
It's when a starved body can't process an excess of new food.<eos> The body shuts down... dies, even.<eos> For centuries, our people have been starved of prosperity and opportunity.<eos> You can't just open up a buffet and expect a starving person to make smart choices.<eos> You have to feed the starved body a little at a time so that it can get well again.
But you don't want to audit it or anything?<eos> I do, but... look. I'm not investing in the code, I'm investing in you.<eos> I know what you're capable of, so I'm investing in the idea.<eos> Even if the code didn't work... - It works!<eos> - I'm sure it does.
Hi, Ove Gardman.<eos> - Hi.<eos> Wendt's murder is linked to Nordkoster, from now on it's one single case.<eos> There was an earring inside the coat we found.<eos> What was it like? -
So Wendt thought Linn was involved?<eos> What do you think?<eos> Probably we'll never know for sure.<eos> - - We could check this out.<eos> The letter is signed "Adelita" and it was sent a week after she was murdered.
Let's continue then.<eos> This letter was sent from Sweden to Dan Nilsson in Costa Rica.<eos> Dan Nilsson being Nils Wendt's alias, were you aware of that?<eos> No, I always thought he was dead.<eos> It's written in Spanish. It goes: "Dan, we're not made for each other."
No, I always thought he was dead.<eos> It's written in Spanish. It goes: "Dan, we're not made for each other."<eos> "I have a chance for a new life, I won't be back.<eos> So?<eos> The problem is... it was written a week after she had drowned in Hasslevikarna.
Are you prepared for that kind of scrutiny?<eos> That would be unfortunate, but we would weather the storm.<eos> - What else?<eos> - The Wayne name still has meaning.<eos> It's a symbol of light and hope.
I was insensitive and rude.<eos> Hmm. Does Alfred know you have his car?<eos> No.<eos> Why tell him?<eos> It's mine, not his.
Let's get back to that nagging little word -- "should."<eos> It's uncharted territory.<eos> I-I can't promise the spell with last forever.<eos> There's no known magic for that.<eos> But it will last.
I like a Fifth Pentacle of Mars.<eos> It's got more character.<eos> Because character is what really matters right now.<eos> Sam... This is awkward, I'm owning that.<eos> But the demon... I think it's in your mom.
Have some food ready.<eos> I'm not your cook.<eos> Sir, to update you, our spies in the Pacific States have accessed a top-secret report.<eos> The Resistance car was recovered from the Karen Vecchione shooing.<eos> The kempeitai believe it came from the High Castle hideout.
Oh, wait, where's the double heart platinum<eos> - you just showed me?<eos> - Well, it was right here.<eos> Did I put that away when I pulled out the sapphire?<eos> Oh, here it is right under this box.
- They do.<eos> - Good morning.<eos> - Good morning.<eos> Vortigern's tower...<eos> It sealed Merlin's fate with Pendragon.
- What? Come see.<eos> Is it because of this dough that the guy got killed?<eos> We'll have to sweep the area.<eos> We found your tree.<eos> We went to the woods and found it.
Kilian, could the white dragon be a woman?<eos> I don't know.<eos> This is an important question.<eos> Close your eyes, focus and visualize the white dragon.<eos> Is it a man or a woman?
You want me to show you the combo? Please.<eos> Hey.<eos> Why is this body always so tired?<eos> "This body"?<eos> Well, maybe 'cause it works nights.
Shit. That's all I'm trying to say.<eos> Can we just take a break please?<eos> - What, your ankle?<eos> Just one second.<eos> - Babe! - It's just a little sore.
Just one second.<eos> - Babe! - It's just a little sore.<eos> You gotta go to the doctor.<eos> I'm gonna make the appointment.<eos> It's getting better.
- Babe! - It's just a little sore.<eos> You gotta go to the doctor.<eos> I'm gonna make the appointment.<eos> It's getting better.<eos> It's just sore.
It's an online marketplace.<eos> It's how I find work sometimes.<eos> And you do this in public?<eos> Yeah, I don't use my own computer.<eos> In case it gets stolen by a thief like you.
Thanks for today.<eos> Yeah, win-win.<eos> What if I was to take him for good? Mnh-mnh.<eos> You couldn't afford it.<eos> If there was an amount, how much would it be?
This case.<eos> This case, it just...<eos> I let it get under my skin. And I forgot!<eos> It's my job to protect the innocent just as much as punish the guilty.<eos> But we can't do this job if it doesn't get under our skin, can we?
- It's the Tesla.<eos> - Unlock it.<eos> - Unlock it! - No.<eos> It opens automatically when you walk up to it, it just knows.<eos> How does it know to pop the trunk?
I saw it somewhere.<eos> Excuse us a moment.<eos> Toxicology say the cake's clean.<eos> They also said:<eos> "Thanks, it was delicious."
- There's no physical sensation. - Fuck!<eos> Yes, there was!<eos> - Cooper, you need to calm down.<eos> - I know because I felt it, okay?<eos> I felt her arm, it was warm, and I felt her fucking stab me in the shoulder.
Yeah.<eos> I'm-- Just wondering what's going on with the strike.<eos> You know I'm not supposed to really talk about it.<eos> I know, I know, I just, like--<eos> It can't go on that much longer, right?
Thank you, Pacho.<eos> - We're safe!<eos> - Pass me the ball.<eos> - Here you go.<eos> - Here it is.
- Were you?<eos> - This was boring me to death.<eos> It was like being stuck in a Victorian woman's novel.<eos> I'd rather that than being stuck in a telephone box with a panicking gorilla.<eos> - Rubbish. - It was trying to kill me.
Yes, Ms. Grant.<eos> Does this dressing look drizzled on?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - No. No, this lettuce is drowning.<eos> It's floating on a sea of ranch, like little Kate Win slet's in Titanic.
But then he'll throw you away, like a used condom.<eos> So, why didn't you kill him?<eos> It meant another war, everyone against everyone.<eos> They'd have come from Piscinola, Ponticelli or center of Naples and taken everything, I couldn't let that happen.<eos> Your place is by my side, where it's always been.
SWITZERLAND<eos> It's very pleasant arriving in Zurich - the station's lovely, the bit round it's lovely - in fact, everything's lovely.<eos> But then, this is the wealthiest city in the world, ranked as having the highest quality of life in the world.<eos> All the clichés are true: everything is so neat and efficient, the people are so polite and obliging, and the buildings are beautiful.<eos> This place is wealthy, and it's obviously been wealthy for centuries.
And I'm not leaving my friends.<eos> You should know that.<eos> Yeah, I do.<eos> The scrambler should be down by the cockpit.<eos> It'll be patched into the comms.
But we're too close to standard flight paths.<eos> It'd be different if we had an EMP on board.<eos> I could build an EMP.<eos> Now you want to kill the pilots?<eos> The electromagnetic pulse won't kill them, it'll kill their planes.
The police are here, but we don't know if they've contained them, we don't know where to go.<eos> If that gorilla gets out here, he's gonna slaughter all these people, and us.<eos> Fireman key.<eos> There's no fireman or key.<eos> If we can jam the key, we can send the elevator back down to the lobby, it'll take the gorilla with it.
Remission?<eos> - Wait, remission from what?<eos> Cancer.<eos> He had cancer.<eos> Wait, is it gone?
- Wait, remission from what?<eos> Cancer.<eos> He had cancer.<eos> Wait, is it gone?<eos> It was, but now it's back.
He had cancer.<eos> Wait, is it gone?<eos> It was, but now it's back.<eos> What?<eos> So it's not gone?
Dad, I'm over here!<eos> Markie...<eos> That's what happened to me.<eos> You okay?<eos> Yeah, I got too close to the edge and it gave way, twisted my ankle.
Who shot Fred?<eos> There were two men hiding under the bridge.<eos> One we released from his body, the other still lives.<eos> They threw the goddamn dog off the bridge.<eos> Did you see it come out of the water?
Did I only make mistakes?<eos> Yes.<eos> But did it all work out?<eos> Kind of!<eos> I had a plan, and I put it into action, and it went off flawlessly.
Have you... have you been drinking?<eos> Have you been drinking?<eos> Okay.<eos> That dog... is the most important thing here.<eos> Because it's Lydia Spring.
Why is it, do you think, that Rainey didn't let us build another altar?<eos> Had us holed up in some rotted-out mansion basement, had us in some decrepit zoo building?<eos> It's so he could control it.<eos> The altar is sacred--<eos> It's electrical!
The prosecutor to the Court of Security.<eos> What for?<eos> I'd like to see your report.<eos> It's confidential.<eos> It belongs to the collective memory.
Please.<eos> Lie to me again, and I'll leave.<eos> And I will make sure the whole world knows why.<eos> Mm-hmm, yeah. Yeah.<eos> I'll make sure your divorce lawyer has a copy of the next article in the series as soon as it runs.
[Jenk] Oh. - I doubt Pinkie's held a gun in his life. - [zipper closes]<eos> Maybe it's another Dick Cheney situation where one of them shot the other.<eos> If Pinkie's so inexperienced, why did Dan invite him along?<eos> Dan needs an audience.<eos> You know like they say, if a bear shits in the woods and nobody saw you shoot it, did it really die?
Look!<eos> Travelers like ourselves have been building and assembling components for this for over a year.<eos> To do what with it?<eos> There's an asteroid on a collision course with Earth called "Helios 685."<eos> It hasn't been detected yet, but when it strikes the Atlantic Ocean in 18 months' time, the wave will knock out most of the Eastern Seaboard, resulting in environmental effects, shortages, and wars from which there will be no recovery.
It's a hydrogen fuel cell.<eos> You're going down, Justin!<eos> We just need to make sure we don't go over this red line.<eos> This is a closed system.<eos> If the water reservoir reaches 100 degrees Celsius, it'll boil, build up pressure, and the whole thing will blow.
I'm totally not prejudiced.<eos> I come from a planet more beautiful than you could ever believe.<eos> We.<eos> We come from that planet.<eos> It was paradise.
I come from a planet more beautiful than you could ever believe.<eos> We.<eos> We come from that planet.<eos> Shoot it now or it'll kill us both!
So is no-one going to ask about the robot?<eos> Wait!<eos> Jesus, Ram.<eos> You meant what you said?<eos> You didn't care if it killed you.
Wait!<eos> Jesus, Ram.<eos> You meant what you said?<eos> You didn't care if it killed you.<eos> But it didn't.
Jesus, Ram.<eos> You meant what you said?<eos> You didn't care if it killed you.<eos> But it didn't.<eos> It left me with the rest of my stupid life, didn't it?
You didn't care if it killed you.<eos> But it didn't.<eos> It left me with the rest of my stupid life, didn't it?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, it did.
My mum!<eos> What on earth is this mess?<eos> What's going on?<eos> I've spoken to a few. None of them seem to remember anything. Which seems really convenient.<eos> The lankin probably does it so it can come back and feed again.
Yes. I'll check out the zombie moat while I'm at it.<eos> Well, the zombie moat seems to be working nicely.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I followed your specs exactly.<eos> It's a little thin on the Z side.
Some of the refugees won't take no for an answer.<eos> I just saw two of them inside the fence.<eos> The natives are getting restless.<eos> We need that vaccine now.<eos> It should be ready within 48 hours.
We need that vaccine now.<eos> It should be ready within 48 hours.<eos> And you're making sufficient quantities?<eos> As you instructed. 10,000 doses.<eos> But I need to do more testing before we use it on humans.
You were under Murphy's control.<eos> The bite on your neck.<eos> What?<eos> I gave you a dose of the original HZN1 vaccine.<eos> It counters his bite and frees us from Murphy's control.
014 needs protection.<eos> He wrote a backdoor hack that a faction in the future is desperate to get their hands on.<eos> What faction?<eos> A group is trying to topple the director, and they wanna use my code to do it.<eos> - I came here to hide it, so it's useless.
What faction?<eos> A group is trying to topple the director, and they wanna use my code to do it.<eos> - I came here to hide it, so it's useless.<eos> - Not useless.<eos> How's it gonna help you in the 21st?
I was depleted.<eos> I lost.<eos> I just didn't want to leave Bekir behind.<eos> Wanting death is a weird thing.<eos> Having it be your only escape.
Come on! -[gasps] -What do you want me to do with these?<eos> [Maurice] Shipment's canceled!<eos> Shipment, schmipment, we still have a mango shortage on our hands.<eos> [all yelling] [Timo] This is the flight recorder I installed in the Mega Gecko's cockpit.<eos> It should tell us what happened in King Julien's final moments.
Um, your son!<eos> Ah, yes, where is--<eos> Oh, my goodness, I've forgotten his name.<eos> It begins with an "R"?<eos> No, no, no, I think it starts with an "L," dear.
Ah, yes, where is--<eos> Oh, my goodness, I've forgotten his name.<eos> It begins with an "R"?<eos> No, no, no, I think it starts with an "L," dear.<eos> Of course it does.
No, it's not Rodney.<eos> It's-It's Brodney.<eos> Eh... Pretty sure it's pronounced "Rodney."<eos> No.<eos> It is...
Look, King Julien, I designed it myself.<eos> Red, white and feet.<eos> -Not bad, Mort.<eos> -[Mort giggling] Glad to see your lemur spirit is coming out.<eos> Even if it is a little creepy.
Pretty sure.<eos> Look, Your Majesty, this crazy tournament means a lot to Clover.<eos> If she really wants to go to this thing, you can't stop her.<eos> And maybe you shouldn't.<eos> Grammy always said, "Set the butterfly free and if it gets caught in the spider web, there's gonna be a whole bunch of spider babies come springtime."
- Our chemistry can't handle it. - Then let it go! Not yet.<eos> Ask me again.<eos> Make me tell you the truth.<eos> What is it?<eos> Is it alien?
- Hi!<eos> - Hi.<eos> I love your movie.<eos> Well, thanks.<eos> It has got to be one of the worst things I've ever seen in my life.
Just sayin'.<eos> Okay.<eos> I can do this. Just give me a moment...<eos> Mimosas coming up.<eos> I once left orange juice in my fridge so long, it tasted like a mimosa.
They're just gonna give you ice and Advil like last time.<eos> You're gonna feel terrible when I'm in a wheelchair.<eos> Which, by the way, would fit easily in the back of this award-winning minivan.<eos> Fine, we'll go to the E.R. Just stop selling me on the van.<eos> You're right. It sells itself.
Stephanie was snoring, there were six kids getting up to pee and the one kid who didn't.<eos> Well, you know what you need.<eos> Yeah, what I need are all 23 people to adhere to my carefully crafted schedule.<eos> I was thinking more like a kiss.<eos> Well, that would cut into my basting time, but... it would stop me from complaining.
If you want any other details, the answer is suck a dick.<eos> Wait here.<eos> Remember that movie?<eos> I used to love it growing up.<eos> It's not really scary, but gory.
You sound like a talented young lady.<eos> Do I know talent?<eos> You bet I do!<eos> Right, well, I'm gonna perform a monologue for you.<eos> It's really good. It's from this amazing play that--
[man on TV] Her artistic style transformed over the course of her life.<eos> During her darkest days, she experimented with brush-loading techniques to add texture to the canvas.<eos> In her late twenties, diagnosed with...<eos> [Keith] How's your neck doing?<eos> Oh, well, it's a little lonely. [chuckles]
I mean, so I can lead you to the front of the parade, where you belong, on your, uh, float.<eos> [gasps] A float?<eos> [chuckles] Patrick, make Miranda a float.<eos> I'll build you the exact float you're hoping for, Miranda.<eos> Okay. [chuckles] Well, it better actually float, though.
Enough with the viral video!<eos> No, no, but listen.<eos> I came up with an original song.<eos> It's sure to go viral.<eos> It's called "Where My Baes At?"
- No one else could've done it.<eos> - How?<eos> She uploaded a command while pretending to save Marcy's life.<eos> How?<eos> When she saw my code, it was sent back as visual information through the quantum bridge created during transfer of consciousness.
The director's had teams working on core elements for months.<eos> First components arrived the day I came back to the 21st.<eos> - This is a quantum frame.<eos> - Yes, it is.<eos> If things get bad enough that the director has no choice but to escape the faction, it can send itself here to the 21st.
Covers the whole farm in a 100-yard radius. Nothing will penetrate it.<eos> No electronics, no GPS, no telemetry of any kind in the 21st or the future.<eos> So we're invisible to the faction right now.<eos> And to the director.<eos> It won't be able to send a messenger or consciousness here, let alone itself.
So we're invisible to the faction right now.<eos> And to the director.<eos> It won't be able to send a messenger or consciousness here, let alone itself.<eos> As soon as we know the director's back online, we'll be safe and we can turn off the defenses.<eos> Then it can either come back to the 21st or stay where it is.
Yeah. You... you have Japan?<eos> Okay, great.<eos> Yeah, no, I'll hold.<eos> I didn't expect to spend my day like this.<eos> Is it over?
Why would I stay?<eos> Here is a letter.<eos> I found it among Miss Bai's things.<eos> Sorry,<eos> It didn't have an envelope, so I opened it.
We've spoken to Staffordshire, Merseyside, half a dozen other forces. No one's gone anywhere near our witnesses.<eos> And we can't find a Detective Galen anywhere on the National Register.<eos> Okay, let's stop calling him Galen.<eos> He wants us to do that.<eos> He wants that name in our heads, so it directs our thinking.
It's a big business.<eos> This is why Ruben is in his pool, dead.<eos> Alec, where are you?<eos> A neighbor just told us that Fairweather borrowed her caravan sometimes.<eos> It's in a field by Welsh Lane, up towards Winsford Flashes.
He's a regular collector of nostalgia.<eos> Oh, sorry, Bob.<eos> Jacob's medical file.<eos> -Why would you hide a key?<eos> -'Cause it's incriminating.
Okay.<eos> It's not just about capturing form. - Mmm. - Or reproducing the real.<eos> Yeah. I'm trying to invite the spectator into the work.<eos> - Right, of course you are. - Start a dialogue. Skye, where do you keep the corkscrew?<eos> Uh, it's, um, on the counter. By the sink.
"Get fucked up.<eos> Never recover.<eos> You can't handle this.<eos> It's 16,000 times more than what you ever want.<eos> This cookie is the size of a cookie, but it's meant to be shared by 22 people."
Or she.<eos> Where?<eos> You found a dead body up in that tree?<eos> - No, down in that tree.<eos> - It's hollow.
You're cut off, like a little bubble of freedom.<eos> Freedom to crack open the mini-bar and eat $10 Toblerones.<eos> Now who's the cynic?<eos> There's something off about this deal.<eos> It's not... normal.
- (LAUGHTER)<eos> - Yes, I have that, too.<eos> Because I had a testicle removed.<eos> You see, I have cancer.<eos> And it appears to be winning.
The launch of Daedalus was the beginning of our historic 7-month journey to Mars.<eos> But it wasn't easy to reach the red planet.<eos> We needed visionaries to guide the way.<eos> Mars and Earth are sister planets.<eos> The young Mars had rivers and lakes, it even had an ocean.
We needed visionaries to guide the way.<eos> Mars and Earth are sister planets.<eos> The young Mars had rivers and lakes, it even had an ocean.<eos> If there was water on Mars, couldn't there possibly be life?<eos> Is it habitable?
Every piece of hardware we've got is running into this junction box.<eos> It's too much.<eos> We don't have a choice Robert.<eos> We have one shot to deploy that dome.<eos> It doesn't go back in the box.
And that was with six drones in the air twelve hours a day.<eos> There's not a single tube that shows any sign of a horizontal entrance.<eos> They have to deploy. Wait!<eos> I think I have something.<eos> We ignored this horizontal entrance because it was clogged with breakdown debris and too far from the nearest candidate skylight to be part of the same tube system.
If they fail, I don't care how much you invested, we're out.<eos> But when everything is telling you you already lost.<eos> If they fail, everyone's out.<eos> There's nothing you can do but believe.<eos> We ignored this horizontal entrance because it was clogged with breakdown debris.
But he's got a very dysfunctional carpenter, psychologically sick, so he has to take him along cause he can't leave him with the crew because it's going to create chaos.<eos> On Mars, just like the Nineteenth Century explorers, you might see fragmenting of the crews and you find these dynamics in these historical records and you see how problematic they are for the success of the mission.<eos> Someone wrote this at the end of the Fourth Century, St. Augustine:<eos> My memory contains my feelings.<eos> Not in the same way as they are present in the mind when it experiences them, but in a quite different way.
That is easy to say, John, but how exactly?<eos> What is it, son?<eos> I, um, I got a letter.<eos> What does it say?<eos> It's from the Commander's Office.
I didn't have an alibi witness. I had a no-show who vanished into thin air.<eos> Well, you could've asked for postponement to have time to find her.<eos> And I would have, except for one thing:<eos> when I pressed her as to what the two of them were doing at the time of those murders, she admitted they were both on meth.<eos> Gallo's filing came back, and it needs to be filed by his attorney of record.
So how'd it go?<eos> You know that book reminds me of when we were sitting on the porch.<eos> You were about 3, and you said the words "outer space" just like that, out of the blue.<eos> And I asked you if you knew where outer space was, and you pointed down the street and said, "Down there."<eos> Well, I guess that's where I thought it was.
In the film, you see black people being a threat to white women.<eos> All the myths of black men as rapists was ultimately stemmed by the reality that the white political elite and the business establishment needed black bodies working.<eos> What we overlook about Birth of a Nation is that it was also a tremendously accurate prediction of the way in which race would operate in the United States.<eos> Birth of a Nation was almost directly responsible for the rebirth of the Ku Klux Klan.<eos> It had received this romantic, glowing, heroic portrait.
Longer sentences, three strikes and you're out, almost 60 new capital punishment offenses...<eos> And then comes the Congress with a proposal for a $30 billion federal crime bill of 1994 that was heavily loaded towards law enforcement incarceration.<eos> I propose a 21st century crime bill to deploy the latest technologies and tactics to make our communities even safer.<eos> That omnibus crime bill was responsible for a massive expansion of the prison system.<eos> And beyond that, it provided all kinds of money and perverse incentives for law enforcement to do a lot of the things that we nowadays consider to be abusive.
- Harvey, Rachel has law school.<eos> And besides that, this is something that I want to do.<eos> Donna, I don't give a shit about Louis and his tenants.<eos> Well, I do.<eos> Because we all said that we would give everything we had to get this place back to where it was, and right now, Jessica has a prospect waiting for you in the conference room.
All right, that's enough for today.<eos> But, Naomi, if you're gonna impugn another lawyer's character, you should know that in the eyes of a jury, it doesn't say great things about your own.<eos> Rachel, can I speak to you for a minute?<eos> I'm sorry, professor, I have another class in five minutes.<eos> They say coffee's for closers, but it's not.
No problem.<eos> I had to toss that shit.<eos> You threw away my prune juice?<eos> Let me put it this way, if my asshole had an asshole, that's what it would smell like.<eos> That's what it's supposed to smell like.
Do you remember my Innocence Project case?<eos> How could I not?<eos> Badass Rachel.<eos> Well, thank you.<eos> So I took it, but now they're saying that it doesn't qualify.
Well, then I better bring it to my office and sign it.<eos> Oh, and for what it's worth,<eos> I didn't try to weasel out of your deal.<eos> I did everything I could to keep it in place.<eos> Well, now it's back in place.
It's a cleansing agent.<eos> When it's salted?<eos> What they clean cast-iron skillets with, not soap and water.<eos> They scour it with a big fistful of salt.<eos> You think your blood pressure is a cast-iron skillet 'cause I can assure you it's not.
Yeah, right.<eos> Yes, that's starting...<eos> - Tomorrow.<eos> - No.<eos> Yeah, it starts tomorrow.
And, erm... ..there.<eos> You're a natural.<eos> LAUGHTER<eos> No, really, though, this sexhibition isn't about me trying to get you all aroused, it's about the beauty of sex.<eos> And how it brings us all together.
You're a natural.<eos> LAUGHTER<eos> No, really, though, this sexhibition isn't about me trying to get you all aroused, it's about the beauty of sex.<eos> And how it brings us all together.<eos> How it excites and connects, how it opens people's minds, after all, sex got us all here.
Mr. McGregor has a pituitary tumor.<eos> A big one.<eos> Appears to be pressing on the optic chiasm.<eos> Which, if his vision is impaired, could explain why he fell.<eos> How long do you think it's been there?
I'll be right back.<eos> Legally blind?<eos> He can detect sharp lights and block images, probably how he made out my size earlier.<eos> But anything more than a few feet away is likely just a blur.<eos> His pituitary tumor, is it operable?
All this -- the meetings, the waiting...<eos> I do not miss that part of the job.<eos> It'd still be your job if you put up half a fight.<eos> This room -- does it seem...?<eos> Like it was decorated by someone who needs to unclench?
Really bummed I missed that.<eos> No, you're not.<eos> Sir, it was quite unsettling.<eos> We need to do something about your arm.<eos> I heard it snap.
Read the book!<eos> Perhaps I could read the book. Huh.<eos> I'm sorry. What did you mean... "not human"?<eos> Because Radcliffe and I built her, okay?<eos> Her mind can't be corrupted because it's just programming.
Well, it's both ... powering not just the cell, but Eli himself.<eos> But it's also the perfect insurance policy to keep us all at bay.<eos> Now ... Now, when you say "fail-safe"...<eos> See this beryllium lid?<eos> It's a neutron reflector rigged to drop at the touch of a finger.
If the prosecutor thinks with the murder of the witness, you and I would have - to do something, who would be in danger?<eos> - I certainly do not.<eos> - Of course not, bastard.<eos> - The storm will pass, what else.<eos> No matter how strong the wind blows, it will not upset me.
Eva!<eos> Did you see my messages?<eos> I forgot my sweater at your place.<eos> Yeah, I saw. I'll look for it.<eos> No, but I have to come get it at your place because I know what it looks like.
I don't know you.<eos> There are stages to a demonic possession, my friend.<eos> Right now, my guess... the demon's gone possum.<eos> Gathering its strength, waiting to show its ratty little teeth.<eos> And when it does... I'll kill the bastard.
How's Casey?<eos> She looks okay, no?<eos> No.<eos> Things are worse.<eos> The demon... it-it can move things. It can hurt other people.
I want to talk to you about your personal life, specifically, your relationship with Paige.<eos> Well, I don't really want to do that right now.<eos> Are you aware she's in dire financial straits?<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> Well, the trouble stems from her...her condition, or rather, the expensive treatments it requires.
He could have something on her.<eos> Maybe it's Stockholm syndrome.<eos> Maybe. But I think I've devised a better theory.<eos> You'll recall that Aaron Stone recently visited a family lawyer and that he and Beth are set to celebrate their tenth anniversary.<eos> Yeah? But while I'm not privy to the details of their prenuptial agreement, I'd not at all be surprised if it were about to lapse.
No.<eos> No, that is not true.<eos> I w... I was not...<eos> We know you saw a lawyer about your prenup.<eos> We don't know when it expires, but ten years is a nice round number.
The thing that struck me the most was the break-in.<eos> Nothing had been stolen.<eos> And there was no evidence that someone had climbed the wall.<eos> Immediately, I could tell it was a staged break-in.<eos> It could have no other function than this, throw off suspicion from someone who has a connection to the house.
It's soaked in blood.<eos> Therefore, she had it on her when she was killed.<eos> This has been ripped.<eos> The part with the clasp is missing.<eos> Here it is.
Therefore, the burden falls on us.<eos> What burden? To end mankind's constant state of war so the real work... progress, perfection... can finally begin.<eos> By killing millions of people?<eos> Josef, this war will be terrible, yes, but this will be the last war.<eos> And when it is over, we will have a world united and at peace for the first time in human history.
- For round two.<eos> Alex, we have a problem.<eos> - Do we have eyes on Hank?<eos> - No.<eos> The whole thing is gone. The fight club's been cleared out like it never happened.
Oh, the DEO mainframe is correlating all incoming data, generating possible targets.<eos> How does that work, exactly?<eos> Well, for instance, the police got an incoming tip about a sketchy-looking van scoping out the Federal Reserve on bridwell Avenue.<eos> So we analyze the lead and see if it's viable.<eos> And... is it?
Plus, you know, I would feel bad if you went and got yourself killed when I could've helped you. Blah blah...<eos> I've been thinking about my suit.<eos> Oh, please. I already have something in the works.<eos> Just trust me, okay?<eos> Do me a favor, do not run into the line of fire until it is ready.
Look, I'm sorry, okay?<eos> I know I don't hold the copyright on caring for Kara.<eos> But we're out of time, man.<eos> I need that suit now.<eos> When it's ready, I'll will let you know. No.
The bars are made from Nth metal from Thanagar.<eos> They're unbreakable.<eos> So, what is this place? Who are these people?<eos> It's called Cadmus.<eos> It's run by scientists who want to wipe aliens off the face of the planet.
I'm studying you, watching how you put up with people<eos> I know you detest, like me.<eos> How do you do that?<eos> Calde told me about the pith helmet gag, Monroe.<eos> Don't worry. It's going back in.
Put that down, Nathan.<eos> I don't want to be up all night with you sick.<eos> Hi, Monroe.<eos> Tell me, Red, what do you notice about your Sheba head?<eos> That it's sitting on someone else's set.
Hi, Monroe.<eos> Tell me, Red, what do you notice about your Sheba head?<eos> That it's sitting on someone else's set.<eos> No.<eos> It's sitting on someone else's finished set, whereas your Sheba head isn't really a head at all, which is why I'm sending it back to the mill.
You wouldn't be saying it at all.<eos> That's the point.<eos> These spies are from a fictional country.<eos> It's totalitarian, murderous.<eos> So the only way Gyssling could complain it's about the Nazis Is to admit they behave the same way. And he can't.
You mean that it has been send from one of our computers?<eos> Most likely.<eos> Then it can be anyone from the company.<eos> I don't get this computer thing.<eos> I stop using it, and it switches off.
Then it can be anyone from the company.<eos> I don't get this computer thing.<eos> I stop using it, and it switches off.<eos> It's the screen saver.<eos> When I turn it on it doesn't work.
Just answer the question.<eos> Yes. I watched it.<eos> Wouldn't you?<eos> Tell me what you saw.<eos> Uh... it shows a bomb, an A bomb, destroying San Francisco, and members of the Resistance being executed in the street by Nazis and...
No... he'll be trying to get Meridia as far away from her as possible.<eos> Please, you have to find her.<eos> Once we took the search parameters off Charles and focused on the daughter, we got a hit.<eos> Not a lot of 15-year-olds are taking last-minute flights out of the country.<eos> A private jet to Mexico City out of Teterboro was just hired by a Larry and Sophie Morris, but it was paid for by the same shell company that was paying Michael and Bridget.
Have you ever, uh, been to this place before?<eos> Nope.<eos> Have you?<eos> Yeah, I love this place.<eos> They have, uh, good pizza, they make a really good, um, salad. I don't remember what it's called.
I could see the lake, but now...<eos> Hey, Bella.<eos> What's going on?<eos> What happened... what happened to the lake?<eos> Oh, it's there.
Hey, Bella.<eos> What's going on?<eos> What happened... what happened to the lake?<eos> Oh, it's there.<eos> It's not going anywhere.
A single, fatal blow to the aortic arch... two inches off the center line, approximately at the second button.<eos> Aim for the spine.<eos> Maintain eye contact, Doc.<eos> Downside of this strike...<eos> It has to be made with sufficient force to break through the chest cavity and sufficient accuracy to find its target.
We used to run these drills, sneak and peek.<eos> You mean he had a fake I.D.? Yes.<eos> Very well-executed.<eos> Totally legitimate-looking.<eos> At first glance, even at second glance, it was...
Basically, this is a Faraday suit, and it is way more conductive than we are.<eos> That's perfect.<eos> That's awesome.<eos> Meet Tesla coil showman and Aron's partner in crime.<eos> When the electricity touches the suit, it would much rather crawl along the surface than go inside the monkey, who's not very conductive.
Oh, I don't drink coffee, makes me shit, big-time.<eos> Can you drink tea?<eos> Tea's good.<eos> The guy in the bowling alley, he called me a seer.<eos> It's what the pricks call us, it's so lame.
So I'm looking for a kid named Chris, okay?<eos> He's got dark hair, from Milwaukee...<eos> Guys, I'm not a cop.<eos> I'm a firefighter.<eos> I-I've recovered his backpack, and it's got meds in it...
Dearing is one of your clients.<eos> I can explain that.<eos> Have you ever heard the expression "arsonist firefighter"?<eos> What?<eos> It refers to a firefighter who starts fires just so he can put them out, be the big hero.
And things get worse when you put your foot down.<eos> I'm not going to say that it's like being attacked by a bear because it isn't.<eos> But it is like being in a room with a bear that's thinking of attacking you.<eos> At the moment I've turned the engine down on this knob here to its minimum setting.<eos> It's only producing 500 horsepower.
Holy cow!<eos> The engine is now producing 820 horsepower.<eos> And the speed just beggars belief.<eos> The bear is in attack mode.<eos> The figures say it'll do 0-60 in 2.9 seconds.
And has a top speed of 208 with that wing on the back.<eos> But it feels a hell of a lot faster than that.<eos> The other thing you get for your money is a squadron of mechanics.<eos> But sadly... not a handbrake.<eos> Right, what I've done now is I've taken... yes... I've taken the steering wheel off, so I can't put it in gear to stop it rolling away.
- Why don't they use jet?<eos> - Exactly. Anybody would like to have some jet in their car.<eos> Actually, we've been doing a little bit of experimenting, Hammond.<eos> I've made a prototype. This is a gearstick with a jet knob... on the top. It's brilliant.<eos> I mean, it's not polished yet, but you change gear.
Than what, my damn toothbrush?<eos> OK.<eos> Right to the end of the Isn't now, and into Your Name Here.<eos> Hard on the brakes, keeping it all in check, and surely he'll appreciate the turbos punching him out of the corner.<eos> Turbos on an engine is God's way of telling you it ain't got enough cylinders.
Right, now I'm away from Hammond's luxury sports car resort, let me tell you a little bit about this remarkable car.<eos> It's powered by the 2L turbocharged engine from the Ford Focus ST, giving 250 horsepower.<eos> That's mounted in the middle, right behind my head there, driving the rear wheels through a no-nonsense, old-school six-speed gearbox.<eos> Now, 250 horsepower doesn't sound like a huge amount in the modern world, but this car, made with an aluminium spine and composite tub, and all the rest of it, weighs less than three quarters of a tonne,<eos> so it is genuinely quick. Look...
I meant C3! I meant...<eos> Yes!<eos> Oh, yes!<eos> Yes!<eos> That mistaken shot wasn't just a hit, it had changed everything.
Well, it's longer and deeper... and wider.<eos> Mm. But it doesn't have any cheese in it.<eos> Why can't you just leave me alone?<eos> I'm just saying, everything in America comes with cheese, apart from the Grand Canyon.<eos> Whereas this canyon does come with cheese, and it's delicious.
The mighty Mustang has filled the American with vigour, and he's being surprisingly tidy.<eos> That's what us Americans want, we want to smoke the tyres.<eos> We want this thing to just get shit and get.<eos> Literally no idea what he's on about. It's just a noise.<eos> When this thing stops, man, it stops on a dime.
And that is the funny thing - you take something ordinary, write a car name on it, and suddenly it becomes expensive.<eos> This bear, for example.<eos> I know about bears.<eos> It's an acrylic fibre, stuffed with industrial waste.<eos> £2.75. But, because it's got a Honda T-shirt on, £10.
Well, tonight, thank God it's him instead of us knocking the Christmas tree over. Absolutely right.<eos> Anyway, erm...<eos> This year marks the 50th anniversary of the greatest battle in motorsport history.<eos> The story begins in the 1960s, when Ford realised that they could sell a lot more cars if they were a lot more successful on the racetrack.<eos> So they formulated a brilliant plan, but unfortunately it went disastrously wrong, didn't it, Bob?
Out of that insane timetable emerged this.<eos> The Ford GT.<eos> Thanks to its sleek shape and the body that stood just 40-inches tall, it promised to cut through the air like a missile.<eos> Add a 4.2L V8, and the magic target of 200mph seemed in the bag.<eos> The trouble is, a racing car is just a collection of hopes and dreams until it gets on the track.
- What engine is it?<eos> - V8!<eos> I've put a V8 in a beach buggy! Well, no, you haven't.<eos> You've parked your beach buggy quite close.<eos> It's not in it!
I've put a V8 in a beach buggy! Well, no, you haven't.<eos> You've parked your beach buggy quite close.<eos> It's not in it!<eos> - It isn't in it. - No.<eos> You've reversed into a V8, but not quite hard enough. It's only gone in a third of the way.
Do you have any idea how difficult it is to fit a V8 to a beach buggy?<eos> - Well, it doesn't fit! - It's obviously impossible.<eos> Exactly, it's impossible.<eos> This is no ordinary V8.<eos> It started out in life as a 3.5 litre V8 from a Range Rover, but I've modified it, so it produces 180 horsepower.
- So all I've got to do is reattach the top bolt... mend the pipe and find three gallons of water... which I shall get from a passing motorist, and I'll be on my way.<eos> - All I could do with a hand with is just lifting the car up so I can reattach the, um...<eos> Well, is there anybody here?<eos> - There's... - I suppose a motorist will pass eventually.<eos> The one that gives you water will also lift it up for you.
I wish I'd fitted that suspension on my car.<eos> How is this car gonna stand up to this punishment all day?<eos> Well, since it had been designed by me and made from 40-year-old components, the answer was depressingly predictable.<eos> The alternator, as you can see, has come off its hinge.<eos> The bolt's supposed to go in there and it's just come off.
- You're not.<eos> ...your car was created by the swinging '60s and endorsed by Steve McQueen, one of the coolest people who ever lived, and yet, somehow, you have managed to make your beach buggy boring.<eos> - It is a bit. - It is boring.<eos> - It's a boring firework display. - It is.<eos> - It's boring in that it works.
- No, James. - It doesn't work!<eos> The only thing that has gone wrong is a small leak in the petrol tank.<eos> Everything else about it has constantly worked.<eos> Do you know, every time I've overtaken you, I've looked and thought, "That's dismal."<eos> It isn't. It has an elegance and a purity.
He's good.<eos> I like him to defend my friends, not my enemies.<eos> If I don't go to jail, I'll go to Quebec.<eos> Far away from this damn mountain.<eos> It took too much from me.
Actually, uh, can't tell you.<eos> Okay. Yeah, I... I promised this, uh, person that I wouldn't say anything.<eos> So... No problem.<eos> But, uh, you know, I can say there was a kiss.<eos> And it was not too shabby.
Yes, I think it is.<eos> I want you to know... I wouldn't change a thing about our marriage.<eos> Neither would I.<eos> You always did say how much you enjoyed the first snowfall.<eos> Yeah, and you always did say what a pain in the ass it would be, come morning.
So much of it is luck anyway.<eos> How would you feel if they came in here and paid for one out of ten beers?<eos> Oh! I'd be ecstatic.<eos> I'm sure the next batch will go better.<eos> Yeah, it will.
Yeah, and if Colt asks, that's how many it's supposed to be.<eos> Look, I think your father really believes what he says, but eventually he just goes back to the way he's always been.<eos> Remember that Christmas we bought him that John Wayne DVD collection and he just used it as bookends for his John Wayne VHS collection?<eos> Yeah, it's like that year we got him his first computer.<eos> He left it in the box for six months, and then used it as a desk for his typewriter.
This is, like, a... major life decision.<eos> I talk to you before I decide to change brands of shampoo.<eos> Yeah, and it's really fucking annoying.<eos> Almost as annoying as when you ask me how your ass looks in them jeans.<eos> Okay, first of all, I'd never ask you that, 'cause I already know it looks good.
Oh. My pleasure.<eos> You know, hanging out with babies is kind of like hanging out with drunk people. They babble incoherently, cry till they get another bottle, and shit themselves.<eos> Oh, and thank you...<eos> I'm sorry. I forgot your name.<eos> Oh, it's, uh, Umberto.

Good story.<eos> - You can have it.<eos> Make a movie.<eos> - I am going to make a movie about you. Okay...<eos> - Do you wanna know what it's called? - Yeah.
I killed Majid Nassar.<eos> Press the button, sir.<eos> Mr. President, step away from the desk.<eos> The toxicologist just performed the spot test for thallium poisoning.<eos> It was positive, sir. There's no way Atwood could have known it was thallium.
-Exactly!<eos> And the Process doesn't care if you're in a wheelchair, or if you came flying or jumping.<eos> You must have faith in the Process.<eos> Son, this chair makes you stronger.<eos> It's your secret weapon.
Ágata, it's over.<eos> Come with me.<eos> Cássia, I want you to find out everything you can about this candidate, okay?<eos> I'm not sure about this test.<eos> I don't know if it's selecting who we need for the Offshore.
Trust me.<eos> Trust me.<eos> It's okay.<eos> Cássia, I'm already fixing the alarm.<eos> No, it went off by accident.
-[Fernando] Go, go, go!<eos> Close it.<eos> -Go, go!<eos> [Ezequiel] The official test is only the first part.<eos> It's meant to analyze how they organize tasks and resources.
Do you want it?<eos> It's a magic ring.<eos> You want it?<eos> I have this ring.<eos> Do you know who it belonged to?
But I saw he was murdered.<eos> And you know what the news always says-- see something, say something.<eos> He always had a laptop with him, but he never used it in here.<eos> After he'd eat, he'd take it out there to the parking lot.<eos> He'd do a little work on it, just standing over there, by the wall, and then get in his car and go.
The noddies too have a problem.<eos> As their chicks grow, so the pisonia trees develop seeds that are sticky and equipped with hooks.<eos> By the time the young noddies leave, they carry these hitchhiking seeds away to other islands.<eos> But sometimes the pisonia trees are too successful.<eos> If a fledgling, testing out its wings, drops to the ground, it can get covered with the seeds.

You kind of get used to it at night, just hearing a constant splat on top of the tent.<eos> But, as you can see, all of the kit, I'm afraid that's getting splat on as well.<eos> And, when the wind changes, it brings a noxious reminder that they're camping on an active volcano.<eos> It's the first time we've smelt sulphur, which is welcome relief from smelling penguins.<eos> It's smoking away.
If they find out we've been hiding her...<eos> They won't.<eos> Nine days since the girl arrived.<eos> Have you noticed any change in her?<eos> The demon is rallying itself... - 'cause it knows we're winning.
- It's tripled in strength.<eos> What's your point?<eos> If we fail here, we are unleashing an ancient violence into the world.<eos> Well, let's not fail then.<eos> And if it can't complete the integration, then it will kill the girl out of spite. - You know this. - So, what are we supposed to do?
All the more reason to keep her away.<eos> You saw how it woke when she was in here.<eos> She could help us draw the demon out.<eos> Bait the whale.<eos> You never give a demon what it wants.
Night, Mom.<eos> No, it's not a no, it's a condition.<eos> My staff comes with me.<eos> And also, I want a bus.<eos> Wednesdays and Sundays, we'll run it back and forth from St. Anthony's to St. Bridget's.
No, the feather... where did you get that?<eos> In the book.<eos> Um, can I... 162.<eos> "I knew then that the demon would never rest,<eos> "never stop, "until it had taken Regan for its own.

The Emperor is not to be bothered with trivialities.<eos> Cleander has redirected shipments of grain from Egypt, stashing them away for just the right moment.<eos> But what he fails to predict, is that the food shortage, and spreading famine, create the perfect conditions for the return of the plague.<eos> Gentlemen. Try the wine.<eos> It's delicious.
Streets have been destroyed, temples burned to the ground.<eos> Lives have been lost.<eos> But I'm here to tell you this is not a bad thing.<eos> In a forest, fire is far from a catastrophe.<eos> It's a necessity.
Lives have been lost.<eos> But I'm here to tell you this is not a bad thing.<eos> In a forest, fire is far from a catastrophe.<eos> It's a necessity.<eos> It burns out the dead wood, allowing new growth, new life.
But nobody ever saw it.<eos> You just heard about this place called Greenpoint.<eos> Nobody would be on the G train. That was like, "What are you doin'?<eos> G train?"<eos> It's packed now. In those days, it was deserted.
They have their reasons, folks.<eos> It's not for us to say why they did.<eos> They have their thing.<eos> I'll tell you a Polish joke right now.<eos> It won't be the same, but it'll still be funny.
What you did for me. I just wanted to say thank you.<eos> What?<eos> Nothing.<eos> It's just, um... the table was...<eos> i-it was evidence in a 78-year-old murder I was trying to solve.
I can't tell you anything more about it.<eos> I saw the plane hit the building.<eos> It changed everything.<eos> [George W. Bush] From this day forward... any nation that continues to harbor or support terrorism will be regarded by the United States as a hostile regime.<eos> The only way to defeat terrorism as a threat to our way of life is to stop it, eliminate it and destroy it where it grows.

Can you shake your head if you can hear me?<eos> Can you hear me? Okay.<eos> All right, I see you a lot better now. Okay, go ahead.<eos> Taking the TB test was an infringement on our rights as believers in Islam.<eos> It contains phenol. Phenol is an alcoholic substance.
First, we three-quarter fill the balloon with cold air.<eos> Then apply the burner.<eos> This is so cool.<eos> As the trapped air heats up...<eos> -Look, it's going up.
I kind of feel like we're a little crazy right now.<eos> The air-blower was effective, so it didn't take more than 10 minutes to fill the balloon with air.<eos> Fire in the hole.<eos> Peter added hot air with the burner, so that the balloon slowly filled and eventually stood up.<eos> It's rising.
He was crazy in the sense that the idea was to put a pigeon into a missile so that it can guide it to a ship and blow it up.<eos> Putting a pigeon in a bomb is definitely nuts, not to mention immoral.<eos> But in theory, it might have worked.<eos> One pigeon pecks the ball as it comes toward him and knocks it toward the other.<eos> If it goes past one pigeon, the other pigeon can eat.
The thing is held together with wood screws... probably some Elmer's glue.<eos> Elmer's glue?<eos> You're kidding me.<eos> I've heard rumors it was powered by a BMW motorcycle engine... it was powered by a lawn mower engine.<eos> You know, you look at this- - At this car and it's such a piece of garbage.
You're kidding me.<eos> I've heard rumors it was powered by a BMW motorcycle engine... it was powered by a lawn mower engine.<eos> You know, you look at this- - At this car and it's such a piece of garbage.<eos> This can't have been powered by much.<eos> But from a distance, it looked good.
The winch is used to tension up the bungee cords.<eos> It's gonna be removed once we click into the quick release.<eos> The quick release allows us to be far away while this thing fires off.<eos> Here's the sled.<eos> It's gonna be un-weighted for this test because we just wanna see how the bungees are gonna perform.
I'll meet you in the middle.<eos> - All right.<eos> - Let's go to war.<eos> War. Huh.<eos> What is it good for?
Skyjacking a drone is cool, but it doesn't give me that ultimate satisfaction... of just knocking a drone out of the sky.<eos> This British bazooka looks like it could take down the Death Star, but its job is to capture drones mid-flight.<eos> I think I can make a rough-and-ready version that's just as effective.<eos> My drone-catcher-net-gun is a DIY hardware store special.<eos> It's made of plumbing parts glued together.
Thanks.<eos> Yes.<eos> Thank you for holding.<eos> Your call is important to us.<eos> Is it really important to you? If it was so important, I would be talking to a human being and not a stupid recording.
Clocks chimed.<eos> And in between... there was sweet silence.<eos> Now, some of us have to endure 1000 beeps per day.<eos> And the big question is why?<eos> How did it replace simpler devices like the buzzer, the horn, the bell?
All we have to do is pulse a voltage to it, like this: And voila... you get a beep.<eos> Now, because it was cheap and easily scalable, the beep began to appear in devices from the smallest all the way to the largest.<eos> Even making the leap into the final frontier.<eos> In October 1957, the Soviets launched Sputnik.<eos> This tiny satellite beeped continually as it orbited the Earth every 98 minutes.
"Where's my jetpack?"<eos> I believe that, finally, that day is so close we can almost touch it.<eos> That is a day I'm looking forward to.<eos> I want one of these, as far as the sci-fi promise, that is really close.<eos> I mean, it looks like it flew right out of a sci-fi movie.
That's the future.<eos> The waveguide is a light delivery device, like an optic fiber, that can be tailored to the size of the wound.<eos> So, now we think that the wound is sealed, we can turn the laser off.<eos> And what we do at the end is we actually just snip the waveguide off.<eos> It's a biodegradable polymer which will simply dissolve in the body.
There's something you don't see every day.<eos> Patch the hole with stem cell material, cover with dye, and hit it with the laser for 10 minutes.<eos> Laser on.<eos> I've done some weird stuff in my time, but patching a pig's colon is definitely up there.<eos> Okay, it's sealed.
Why?<eos> Because it's incredibly annoying.<eos> It's the selfie stick.<eos> Or as some people like to call it, the narcissist-stick.<eos> I mean, the selfie stick was so popular, it ranked TIME magazine's Top 25 Inventions for 2014.
Using a large array of massive, metallic tone wheels for those notes, and after adding a keyboard...<eos> You guessed it.<eos> Basically, Cahill created the world's first synthesizer.<eos> Now, it was so complicated, it required two organists.<eos> And it was huge.
Like the heroic pioneers who blazed their way into the history books on the Bonneville Salt Flats...<eos> He's out of control.<eos> giving up just isn't a part of Tim's vocabulary.<eos> Which means before long, I find myself back on yet another runway, with yet another official from Guinness World Records, and yet another wheel design.<eos> It's a plastic rim.

[whistling stops] Going within someone else's body, I mean... uninvited, you know, [stammers] it's just huge.<eos> And I survived 'cause I took my mind away.<eos> I thought, "You can never, ever harm my essence, my spirit.<eos> My body is only part of me.<eos> It's not the whole of me.
We will be forever in the prison.<eos> And no chance to be in the Israeli jail again.<eos> [speaking Arabic] We may never see our families again, but in the end, a freedom fighter must make a choice.<eos> [man on TV] The standoff here is central to the immediate future of this entire city.<eos> Until it's resolved, Israeli troops will remain on the streets.
Come to my house.<eos> You took me in.<eos> Let me help you.<eos> Rajan, we may be married, but my body is mine.<eos> It is not a field of land to be purchased and plowed.
Tonight, we're going to...<eos> Have sex.<eos> Yeah.<eos> When I'm in the ring... there are times when my body moves without me telling it to.<eos> It moves without me thinking, "I should do this, I shouldn't do that."
Have sex.<eos> Yeah.<eos> When I'm in the ring... there are times when my body moves without me telling it to.<eos> It moves without me thinking, "I should do this, I shouldn't do that."<eos> It moves in harmony to the moment.
You were too good a dancer to be a straight boy.<eos> I love you, Mama.<eos> Why do you like watching this silly movie every year?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I guess I like what it believes in.
I love you, Mama.<eos> Why do you like watching this silly movie every year?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I guess I like what it believes in.<eos> What does it believe in?
Stalkling.<eos> Very nasty.<eos> - Stalkling?<eos> - Stalkling?<eos> It was flying in daylight.
You struck a blow against a stalkling?<eos> - What gallant bravery!<eos> - Well, it was more like luck than...<eos> Incredibly heroic and brave and Trollhunter-ish.<eos> Once a stalkling marks its target, it... well, stalks it till death.
- Not a word.<eos> It's... It's beautiful.<eos> Welcome to Heartstone Trollmarket.<eos> This place is beyond...<eos> It's beyond beyond!
So I searched for stones that would have a significance to his past...<eos> Birthstone.<eos> - Indeed.<eos> Such as Gunmar's Birthstone.<eos> - Why is it so powerful?
And from it, Gunmar was born.<eos> Birthstone, okay.<eos> Where would we find that?<eos> Birthstone gone.<eos> It was plundered before any good could come from it.
Oh, I'm sorry. Hold on. - It's the hospital.<eos> - Of course.<eos> Well, I do have to get back to work, but I've got a few more minutes.<eos> Mmm. This tea is really nice.<eos> Yes. I'd say it has a certain enchanting quality to it.
- Three, two... - You have to know this.<eos> - ... one. - We're gonna die!<eos> - Time is up. - Death!<eos> Death is the answer.<eos> It begins and has no end. And ends all things that begin. "Death."
We spike the coffee.<eos> Shadow Staff.<eos> I use my Warhammer to take out his goons.<eos> Then, I ever so gently remove the ring.<eos> - But what if it doesn't come off?
Shadow Staff.<eos> I use my Warhammer to take out his goons.<eos> Then, I ever so gently remove the ring.<eos> - But what if it doesn't come off?<eos> - Why would it not come off?
You know, I'm a bit surprised how well we work together.<eos> You know, I'm still gonna take you down after all this is over.<eos> Perhaps, if we get through this, I could talk to my constituents about the Eye of Gunmar.<eos> I assume you're still interested in finding the last Triumbric stone?<eos> - You know where it is?
This hack is one of the largest data breaches in the world.<eos> I was in a meeting and all of a sudden my phone started dancing across the table, and I'm trying to concentrate, and I'm looking over and I'm seeing the names of business associates, my business clients, friends of mine,<eos> people I had met on Ashley Madison contacting me.<eos> And my heart sank.<eos> The hack appeared very strange because it was so hollywoodesque as if it had been scripted.
Let's go, bro.<eos> Bro, come on.<eos> Don't use your cell phones.<eos> We've been trying, but we can't get a signal down here.<eos> We need to get out of this airport right now before it burns to the ground.
I have done all I can to protect them.<eos> We have been surrounded by predators since the shipwreck.<eos> (INFANT CRYING)<eos> The jungle consumes everything.<eos> It preys on the old, the sick, the wounded, the weak.
But he was supposed to be the only casualty.<eos> Aside from the entire country of people you're enslaving, of course.<eos> Would you pass the pepper?<eos> (GROANING)<eos> It can also serve as a necklace.
- What do you want?<eos> - Me? I would like to stop him.<eos> - A ghost.<eos> - Ghost?<eos> No, it's not ghost.
Yeah, he moved to town a few years ago.<eos> Very mysterious.<eos> Very sexy.<eos> I love his scent.<eos> It's like mint and BO.
- Dude. Dude, get off me.<eos> - Listen very carefully.<eos> That's the Abominable Snowman.<eos> You don't get that nickname by accident.<eos> And it crawled out of a book.
You don't get that nickname by accident.<eos> And it crawled out of a book.<eos> - That doesn't just happen, Zach.<eos> - I'm going after Hannah.<eos> Look, I read what it did to Pasadena.
- Brian.<eos> Brian.<eos> You are Lono.<eos> I'm so touched by the hula. Aren't you?<eos> It's just such an expressive gift.
- Thank-you notes, huh?<eos> - How was winter prom?<eos> - Nice.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> - It was good.
There aren't enough bullets in the world to kill me.<eos> (GROANS)<eos> John Connor talks too much.<eos> Follow me.<eos> The timer, it sped up.
This is business, Suge.<eos> Come on, man.<eos> Anyway, what's this you workin' on, cuz?<eos> I like this. So look, you know, it's a new track for this new movie.<eos> It's called "Deep Cover." Ooh.
Tartan's the Honda of Albania.<eos> JAMES:<eos> Why'd you get an Albanian car, Dad?<eos> Renting a family car on Memorial Day weekend... doesn't leave you with a lot of options. But this baby is pretty sweet. It's got all the latest Albanian technology.<eos> Check it out.
- The muffin.<eos> RUSTY:<eos> Dad to the rescue.<eos> Thank God.<eos> Wait, where's it going?
went up?<eos> - Wasn't that strange?<eos> No, it's housing. Housing is always stable.<eos> Low risk.<eos> It's solid.
Oh, really?<eos> Well-- well, I was.<eos> That's cool.<eos> I was on the design team for that suit I was wearing.<eos> But it's the only reason I was able to survive as long as I did.
That's cool.<eos> I was on the design team for that suit I was wearing.<eos> But it's the only reason I was able to survive as long as I did.<eos> They weren't supposed to be used long-term, though. It's beat up now.<eos> It's damaged.
Wait.<eos> You got a generator?<eos> Engine's fried.<eos> It's my fault. it's--<eos> When it stopped working, I was goofing around. I was just-
I'm in love with her.<eos> Careful!<eos> Love will cost you more than you think.<eos> - The engine's dumping' exhaust!<eos> - What the hell! You said it was pristine!
Pump the brakes, my Russian friend.<eos> We might be engaged, but I'm my own woman.<eos> Besides, I wouldn't be wearing my engagement ring.<eos> Remember?<eos> It's only just been stolen.
Steven, it seems to me that you're using my case to promote your cause, gay marriage.<eos> That is exactly what I'm doing.<eos> This is the case that I've been waiting for, that I've been dreaming about.<eos> This is going to put this issue in the national spotlight, it is going to turn the tide for gay marriage.<eos> My fight is not about marriage, it's about equality.
Who are you?<eos> I'm no princess.<eos> I have no carriage, no parents, and no dowry.<eos> I do not even know if that beautiful slipper will fit.<eos> But if it does,
I'm right here.<eos> As long as you can still grab a breath, you fight.<eos> You breathe.<eos> Keep breathing.<eos> When there is a storm... And you stand in front of a tree... If you look at its branches, you swear it will fall.
There was no more to be done.<eos> Right?<eos> Yeah.<eos> We all saw him.<eos> When there is a storm... And you stand in front of a tree... If you look at its branches, you swear it will fall.
The best sleep you will know when you are not dead.<eos> And you are cheating death.<eos> Go on, take your clothes off.<eos> I have a clumsy, unattractive body.<eos> It's not unattractive.
Where is the mother of this child?<eos> I came to Mexico a virgin.<eos> And I leave it debauched.<eos> My body was a stranger.<eos> And now it becomes familiar in its sheer vulnerability.
And, and look what he wrote to Stalin, "Dear Stalin..."<eos> You don't address the Premier of the USSR like that.<eos> Upton did, and he's a writer.<eos> "You may have heard "that I have taken the job of financing a moving picture, "which the Soviet director Sergei Eisenstein<eos> "It is going to be extraordinary work "and I think will be a revelation "of the moving-picture art.
I changed my conviction<eos> Because you were arrested<eos> No<eos> I'm certain my plan would have succeeded, if my conviction had been right<eos> Since it hasn't succeeded, I'm convinced it wasn't meant to succeed and that my conviction was wrong
-Yeah.<eos> Are you guys okay?<eos> I mean, what happened?<eos> We hit a white-tailed deer.<eos> It was huge.
It wasn't my choice.<eos> It was time for goodbye.<eos> You understand that it is too far?<eos> I cannot carry this body with me.<eos> It will be like an old abandoned shell.
- Oh, wow!<eos> - It's your serious face.<eos> I would have preferred a driver, but it's a nice welcome.<eos> Dad, this light doesn't work.<eos> What do you mean it doesn't work?
- It's your serious face.<eos> I would have preferred a driver, but it's a nice welcome.<eos> Dad, this light doesn't work.<eos> What do you mean it doesn't work?<eos> I got Bob. Okay. Nope, it doesn't work.
I was dematerialized and reassembled.<eos> Is everyone alive?<eos> Are my parents alive?<eos> I don't know.<eos> You must have killed the alien before it could send me to the right place.
It's never been tried, but if it works, you can... train him to do what you want.<eos> What do you mean, "if it works"?<eos> It's a new project I'm working on.<eos> It makes the robot have a mind like a human.<eos> But it's like a child in the beginning.
Ma'am, listen.<eos> This is the work of Deon.<eos> It's the work of some rogue program that he's been writing... and last night he brought a droid in here... and it was sentient.<eos> And have you seen this? Do you know?<eos> It's committing crimes, the monster.
I could pick up quarters with it, if I wanted to.<eos> I haven't wanted to yet.<eos> I shouldn't be telling you this, but Rob's penis has a kink in it.<eos> I can't think of what it's called.<eos> It's kind of, like, crimped?
I was showboating.<eos> I am so sorry about that.<eos> You talking to me?<eos> Uh, Robert Pacino.<eos> Why don't you try sticking your head up your ass? See if it fits?
Why don't you try sticking your head up your ass?<eos> Why don't you try sticking your head up your ass? See if it fits! See if it fits!<eos> Stevia!<eos> Why don't you stick your head up your ass?<eos> - See if it fits?
Stevia!<eos> Why don't you stick your head up your ass?<eos> - See if it fits?<eos> - Pass.<eos> Why don't you stick your head up your ass and see if it fits?
The new editor arrives on monday.<eos> So I'm sorry buddy, but... I got to ask you.<eos> What the hell do you know?<eos> How's the cake?<eos> It's really good.
No, I grew up in Ohio but my mom is from Southie.<eos> I see you got it.<eos> I've never even seen Back Bay.<eos> So, what happened on that first visit, Joe?<eos> Well, it was very nice at first.
But I'm not sure that anyone outside of 2 knows what we've been up against.<eos> This is The Nut.<eos> The Capitol's headquarters for all offensive operations.<eos> It's manned by both military and civilian personnel from District 2.<eos> As you can see, the fortress lies so far beneath the bedrock, it's untouchable.
It's the deviation factor.<eos> Look. Here's the refuge.<eos> If you run these drills 24 hours a day at full speed, the drill is going to deviate, like this.<eos> Or like this.<eos> In fact, it can bend 20 different ways.
No, no, no, Don Lucho. That's a negative.<eos> The mountain is completely unstable.<eos> You need another option.<eos> We know.<eos> We know it's unstable, but it's the only way.
The metal cage is designed to haul the 33 miners, one by one, from 700 meters below ground to the sunlight they haven't seen now for 62 days.<eos> GUARD:<eos> Open it up.<eos> Okay.<eos> It's sinking.
How fast?<eos> Too fast.<eos> You see this green line?<eos> We marked this stone yesterday.<eos> You see how far it has come down?
But you and I both know you're not gonna walk away from the find of the century because of whose name's gonna end up in the textbooks.<eos> Like our little friend said, you're Tesla, and I'm quite content being just another Edison of the world.<eos> Jim Beale. Project log, final entry before zero hour of the experiment.<eos> A piercing sound has been cutting through every synapse of my brain ever since I opened the first end of the wormhole.<eos> It's finally ceased.
The whole story got a lot more involved.<eos> That's why it's not done yet.<eos> I wanted to see how it played out.<eos> Yeah, but it's not actually me.<eos> It's just a version of me.
We're taking the train of thought!<eos> The train, of course!<eos> That is so much faster!<eos> But how do we catch it?<eos> Well, it kind of goes all over the place, but there is a station in imagination land.
He was your age and he's not an old fart.<eos> Who is this motherfucker?<eos> - You're bothering me!<eos> You're pissing me off, damn it!<eos> - I want to know who it is.
- Yeah.<eos> What's my dog's name?<eos> Uh, Australia.<eos> It's a sheltie you've had since you were 10.<eos> You left it with your cousin, ramesh.
I do not want it to work!<eos> You know what?<eos> "Boov" rhymes with "groove."<eos> Shake your Boov thang.<eos> It is shaking in a most undignified way!
That is the Boov motto.<eos> Yes, but we're not doing that.<eos> I have a plan.<eos> Is your plan to run away?<eos> Because other-way-wise, it is stupid!
- Hello, Mr. Parsons.<eos> Lord almighty, John Henry.<eos> I ain't seen you since you went off to war.<eos> I asked the saloon to order some sipping cider from Cheyenne for me.<eos> Would you see if it's arrived please?
I need to understand why you didn't come back.<eos> I think I'm entitled to that much.<eos> I'll say this, and I will say no more on the subject.<eos> The thought of coming back to you... was the only thing that got me through that damn war.<eos> And when it was over, I swear to you on my life, I tried coming home.
I could feel the life going out of her.<eos> And then she breathed again.<eos> So I squeezed harder.<eos> And then... I realized I couldn't... I couldn't put her in the suitcase like that.<eos> It was too big.
Stay close behind me.<eos> REESE:<eos> The fire alarm's right up here.<eos> PFEIFER:<eos> What if it doesn't work?
The fire alarm's right up here.<eos> PFEIFER:<eos> What if it doesn't work?<eos> REESE:<eos> It's gonna work.
Why?<eos> It's the way I am.<eos> When you said "negotiate," what did you mean?<eos> I already have a contract prepared.<eos> It's fairly detailed.
She's just in a meeting.<eos> Something I can help you with?<eos> Yes, Jules spilled soy sauce on her Saint Laurent jacket.<eos> Can you take it to the photo studio? There's lots of cleaners and stuff in there. Sure.<eos> Where is it?
Hey, Matt, did a... morning.<eos> Morning.<eos> Is that all dry-cleaning?<eos> These three are. These two are laundry. And this button...<eos> I mean, it's loose, so... - Okay.
The Kartenhoff.<eos> The oldest in human possession.<eos> The very meteorite which made this crater.<eos> Think about it.<eos> So many years up there, alone, silent, building momentum until it chose to make its mark on Earth.
The very meteorite which made this crater.<eos> Think about it.<eos> So many years up there, alone, silent, building momentum until it chose to make its mark on Earth.<eos> A huge, unstoppable force.<eos> Except it did stop, didn't it?
But I have something none of them have.<eos> - A fuel-burn algorithm. - Yes.<eos> The EXR.<eos> They all want it.<eos> It's legal.
Let's finish the job.<eos> I really hope this makes us even.<eos> Now go be a hero.<eos> The vibranium core's got a magnetic field. That's what's keeping the rock together.<eos> If it drops?
Now go be a hero.<eos> The vibranium core's got a magnetic field. That's what's keeping the rock together.<eos> If it drops?<eos> Right now, the impact will kill thousands.<eos> Once it gets high enough? Global extinction.
He can wield the hammer, he can keep the Mind Stone.<eos> It's safe with the Vision.<eos> And these days, safe is in short supply.<eos> But if you put the hammer in an elevator...<eos> - It would still go up.

And your mop is plastic and it looks strange.<eos> I don't know anything about charts.<eos> Or business, frankly.<eos> But I do clean my own home.<eos> And I made this mop... because it is better than anything else out there.
Or business, frankly.<eos> But I do clean my own home.<eos> And I made this mop... because it is better than anything else out there.<eos> Please give me a chance.<eos> I like that it's plastic... because it's so light in my hands, it's like nothing.
But I do clean my own home.<eos> And I made this mop... because it is better than anything else out there.<eos> Please give me a chance.<eos> I like that it's plastic... because it's so light in my hands, it's like nothing.<eos> It's also ten times more absorbent than any other mop on the market.
That is an enormous amount of absorbent cotton... on a very small mop head.<eos> Now I'm done with the bathroom, and I haven't wrung the mop once.<eos> Let me ask you a question.<eos> Would you take this mop... where you were just cleaning the bathroom... and around the toilet, and all of those germs... and take it into the kitchen... where your family eats, where you feed your children?<eos> I take this mop head, I put it in the washing machine... it comes out clean like new.
Make sure you get down there.<eos> Yeah, that's it.<eos> It's made of plastic, so it's lightweight, but very durable.<eos> Go in. Go in to the hands.<eos> It's extremely absorbent... with 300 continuous cotton loops... that I looped myself when I designed it.

Oh! "Charles." I mean, "Charlie Brown."<eos> She's not here?<eos> On her way to summer camp?<eos> So the bus hasn't left school yet?<eos> But it's about to leave?
Two weeks?<eos> Really?<eos> I thought you said two days.<eos> He just got dumped over email. He's devastated.<eos> Babe, his bag is his whole apartment. It's huge.
Stop.<eos> She's a little shy.<eos> Does that name mean anything to you?<eos> Why?<eos> Should it?
Stay close! Hold on!<eos> Hold on to Leila!<eos> Get back!<eos> Get back into the circle!<eos> Where is it?
Get out of my bank, you beast!<eos> I know what you're thinking, but not yet.<eos> Hold it.<eos> How is this jackass stuck?<eos> If it got in here, it can certainly get out!
Yes, all right.<eos> Strike three!<eos> You're out!<eos> No, no, the ball was... too low.<eos> In order for it to count as a strike, it has to pass through the... strike zone.
Help me with this.<eos> Quick!<eos> Whoa, what's going on?<eos> Sir... we were unable to acquire the droid on Jakku.<eos> It escaped capture... aboard a stolen Corellian YT model freighter.
Sir... we were unable to acquire the droid on Jakku.<eos> It escaped capture... aboard a stolen Corellian YT model freighter.<eos> The droid... stole a freighter?<eos> Not exactly, sir.<eos> It had help.
Come on, baby, don't let me down.<eos> - What?<eos> - Compressor.<eos> Inform the First Order... that Han Solo has the droid they want.<eos> And it's aboard the Millennium Falcon.
Quick!<eos> That's one hell of a pilot!<eos> The girl I've heard so much about.<eos> The droid.<eos> Where is it?
The scavenger... resisted you?<eos> She is strong with the Force.<eos> Untrained, but stronger than she knows.<eos> And the droid?<eos> Ren believed it was no longer valuable to us.
And yet he still remains in the capital.<eos> We have eyes upon him every moment of the day and night.<eos> He's patient.<eos> But his act doesn't fool me.<eos> Nor should it you.
I'm coming, I promise.<eos> I'll be there at your wedding.<eos> What's the grin for, Bud?<eos> I saved the fish.<eos> It swam away.
May I?<eos> - May I eat now?<eos> - Sure.<eos> So why don't you tell us how your day was today?<eos> It was superb.
What, I don't know.<eos> And I don't like not knowing.<eos> What I saw was a dreamer facing defeat.<eos> Did you see his suit?<eos> It was beautifully tailored, but at least a decade old.
Come on, Edith, come with me.<eos> Let's take you upstairs.<eos> I thought you said the dog was dead.<eos> I left it out there on its own.<eos> Thought it would perish in the cold.
Let's take you upstairs.<eos> I thought you said the dog was dead.<eos> I left it out there on its own.<eos> Thought it would perish in the cold.<eos> How has it survived all this time?
What is it?<eos> Firethorn berries.<eos> They're very good for you.<eos> You don't like it?<eos> It's a little bitter.
I'm afraid nothing gentle ever grows in this land.<eos> You need a measure of bitterness not to be eaten.<eos> What was that?<eos> That's the east wind.<eos> When it picks up, the chimneys form a vacuum and with the windows all shuttered up, the house...
We needed the company.<eos> Thomas?<eos> Uh, not for me, thank you.<eos> Drink your tea.<eos> It'll warm you.
What did you say?<eos> Crimson Peak.<eos> That's what they call it.<eos> The ore and the red clay leach up from the ground and stain the snow.<eos> It turns bright red, so,
Hey, Sam, how's your boring salad?<eos> Mmm, it's actually delicious.<eos> Everybody always says that about their salad. They're all a bunch of fucking liars.<eos> No, I love it.<eos> It's really good.
Oh, my God. I can't believe Nick Webber knows the name of the cat wrangler.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Crazy, right?<eos> You know, I just have to tell you, I really love this song so much.<eos> It feels so personal.
Fuck!<eos> Live?<eos> - I think Frank is up here.<eos> -Good.<eos> celebrate this day as it has been for all Norwegians since our founding fathers at Eidsvoll
Oh!<eos> What's that?<eos> Nothing.<eos> Just the angry soul.<eos> It ate Grandma.
You all right, Jonny?<eos> Did you do that?<eos> What do you think?<eos> The guy looks like you, though. Doesn't he?<eos> Of course it looks like me.
This is not a time to do that!<eos> I know, I just wanted to take the edge off the nerves.<eos> But in retrospect, it may not have been a good idea because I feel like...<eos> I feel like... my penis is whispering to me.<eos> It's saying terrible things.

Sully.<eos> What's with the room?<eos> Supposed to be for archives.<eos> I know what it's supposed to be.<eos> But what's it for?
Right.<eos> Okay, so you're going through this rough patch and then all of a sudden you find yourself in the middle of...<eos> I guess we got to call it a surreal experience.<eos> Walk me through that. What was that like for you?<eos> Well, when you're staring death in the eyes, and it's staring back at you... it's scary.
But if you control the bull, you get style points.<eos> Is that how you do the hand?<eos> That?<eos> The bull is judged too, on speed, agility and power.<eos> Whether it bucks or blows out, turns back around on you.
- His first cowboy hat.<eos> - That is so cute!<eos> Never took it off.<eos> He ate in it. He slept in it.<eos> He even tried to glue it to his head so it wouldn't come off!
So, Don, I'm sure that little slut told you all about us, didn't she?<eos> She told me enough.<eos> - Did she tell you how big my dick was?<eos> - We did not get into specifics about that.<eos> It's big.
- We did not get into specifics about that.<eos> It's big.<eos> - Is that right?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> It is big.
Don't try to beat us.<eos> You can't.<eos> We're the best.<eos> And now I really must go rest my neck.<eos> It is sore from looking down on you.
- Okay. Just give me a second.<eos> - We don't have a second.<eos> Hear that?<eos> That's not a bad trip, okay?<eos> That is death and it's about to knock on our back door so please can we go now?
This is my banjo hand!<eos> The dog doesn't have the finger.<eos> What?<eos> The dog doesn't have the finger!<eos> It's in my hair!
Shh.<eos> Be quiet!<eos> What does a deer say?<eos> That is not what a deer says.<eos> If it says anything, it sounds like this:
It's white gold and diamonds.<eos> That's how my husband smuggled money into this country as presents for his vain, dumb trophy wife.<eos> How much is that bag worth?<eos> - I don't know, I have limited mental capacit...<eos> - How much is it worth?
Did it work?<eos> Are you pleased?<eos> The assistant director said it did.<eos> What made you think of a film about people losing their jobs!<eos> Mom, it's not a sad film, it's full of energy, hope.
- Would you come here, please?<eos> - Just a minute.<eos> Look what I found in the drawers.<eos> Why are you wearing your grandmother's robe?<eos> - I had a shower and found it.
One million pounds.<eos> I trust that you have brought the treasuries?<eos> I think I'll keep the money. And the vase.<eos> You cheated me in our last deal.<eos> I paid three million for that tapestry, then found out it is worth only one!
Don't worry, sir. I'm all right. I am all right.<eos> No, no, man!<eos> My little sproutling.<eos> - What?<eos> - Has it been compromised?
- Just like any other fight.<eos> - (SCOFFS SOFTLY)<eos> This fight?<eos> I seen it before.<eos> It gets as bad as it can get and most of the time, you don't win it.
I'm not a big cake...<eos> I make cakes. Yes. I see the connection.<eos> Now you can wear a cake.<eos> How did you know I don't care for traditional jewelry?<eos> I can't seem to stop looking at it... and it can't stop looking at me.
Stay there.<eos> Will you be a loyal subject and help your king?<eos> Yes, My Lord.<eos> Tell me where Alcaman's palace is.<eos> I know it's here.
You've done a good job protecting...<eos> How do we get it?<eos> We can't fight them.<eos> We're outnumbered.<eos> Now prove yourself smart and tell me where it is.
- I made a decision that was based on, um, you know, just the desire to get the movie made.<eos> And I was given an ultimatum by the head of the studio that if I didn't start the movie on a specific day, they weren't gonna make it.<eos> -[Zemeckis] My first choice for the part was unavailable because he was in a TV show.<eos> So Eric is a really good actor, and I made the decision to put him in the movie, but it turned out that his instincts and the type of comedy that we were doing wasn't really gelling.<eos> - It became clear as the picture progressed that the humor just wasn't working the way it should.

Adam, if you need to make, call me.<eos> I'll pick you up.<eos> - Of course, that's not what the movie is about at all, but I loved that my mom, to her, that's what the movie was about, a boy who goes back in time and hangs out with his mom.<eos> - I was so excited about it.<eos> I made my parents, who were separated at the time, go see it with me, 'cause it had such a generational theme to it.
-The tern stole it from us.<eos> There's plenty of area for it to relocate.<eos> Nature always comes first, especially regarding adult playgrounds.<eos> Is that clear?<eos> There's been an eagle in the area, but it may be gone...
Fuck, I need that amp.<eos> I need it.<eos> It's first and last, okay?<eos> It's a vintage amp.<eos> It's worth a lot.
Security threw me out.<eos> So I sit at home all day<eos> I wake up at nights, anxious, in a sweat<eos> I had my appendix operated<eos> It's been leaking ever since
Eleven details?<eos> When you're married as long as me, you'll understand.<eos> She knows what she wants. It's great.<eos> The sex is great.<eos> It's rough.
I will go so far as to say that you are my most valuable writer.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I reread your latest draft of the Dr. Conners piece, and I-<eos> - I have to confess, I spoke too soon.<eos> It is very good.
It is very good.<eos> Really?<eos> It really is.<eos> Really?<eos> Yeah, it's very good.
When everything is concentrated on making profits for the big corporations, what you see is that human rights, the environment, workers' rights get lost all together.<eos> You see that workers are increasingly exploited because the price of everything is pushed down and down and down, just to satisfy this impulse to accumulate capital.<eos> And that's profoundly problematic, 'cause it leads to the mass impoverishment of hundreds of millions of people around the world.<eos> [woman] If you write to these companies, they'll send you their code of conduct.<eos> And it's beautiful, and it says, "Oh, yes, we take responsibility for the conditions under which our product is made, you know, the product that you buy.
Certainly I'd recall what had become of her, whether she was victim or culprit.<eos> But that night...<eos> I couldn't remember any of it.<eos> All I knew for certain was that the case was my last... and it was why I left the profession, came down here, retired to my bees.<eos> So, I decided to write the story down on paper... as it was, not as John made it.
He made me the hero.<eos> It was his way of bestowing a kindness.<eos> He knew no other manner... in which to write the character he had created.<eos> After all those years, John didn't know me at all.<eos> Why he took the glove I can only surmise, was it to prevent it becoming too powerful a reminder, to keep it from being a well of sadness... to which I might return?
Okay, listen to me.<eos> What made you jump out the truck, Jack?<eos> Ma said in my head.<eos> Okay, what exactly did she say?<eos> Jump when it slows down, but I couldn't.
He comes home early from bowling while his skinny white wife is still out with her girlfriends, and I suck his dick until tears come to my eyes.<eos> I have to rub Vaseline all over my lips, because his dick is so big, it feels like my mouth is gonna rip at the corners.<eos> What?<eos> Wait.<eos> How big is it, really?
Move it. She's made us.<eos> Ms. Clinton, come with me.<eos> Mr. Jefferson, stay here.<eos> And then can we can get me to the frickin doctor?<eos> My foot feels like it's going to fall... forget it.
Who?<eos> My mom.<eos> She died a year and a half ago.<eos> She had cancer.<eos> I mean, well, first she had breast cancer and then she had a mastectomy, but it decided to hang around and travel to her lungs.
My mom.<eos> She died a year and a half ago.<eos> She had cancer.<eos> I mean, well, first she had breast cancer and then she had a mastectomy, but it decided to hang around and travel to her lungs.<eos> So, I guess you could say it wanted to be with her just as much as everyone else did.
A man was walking toward you.<eos> A man who couldn't breathe.<eos> I've been to that dark place, too.<eos> It's not a place for pure souls.<eos> It is very dangerous.
When I was 7 years old, the doctor said I won't live to 10.<eos> When I was 10, he said I won't get past 15.<eos> I'm 43 years old now. Many doctors said it's a miracle.<eos> My pacemaker... used to run on 2 batteries. Now they use a chip.<eos> If it stops, I die instantly.
It's like Roman Holiday.<eos> Oh, Hymie, this is nothing like Roman Holiday.<eos> Roman Holiday had a guy with a name and a body they could give the award to.<eos> There is no Robert Rich.<eos> Who gets the thing if it wins?
Oh, Hymie, this is nothing like Roman Holiday.<eos> Roman Holiday had a guy with a name and a body they could give the award to.<eos> There is no Robert Rich.<eos> Who gets the thing if it wins?<eos> Well, maybe it won't. I mean, it's not that good.
To take the blame.<eos> Well, there you go.<eos> Hello. Hi, Sammy.<eos> Oh, do you know that Kirk Douglas gave me this bird?<eos> It's a distraction. No.
And right after I quit, you can re-shoot all my scenes.<eos> You see, Ed, for better or worse,<eos> I am Spartacus.<eos> There's a picture coming out.<eos> It's called Spartacus.
I just don't want to drop him.<eos> ~ Can I ask you a question?<eos> ~ Of course.<eos> Would it be all right if I came up later and had another look at your balcony?<eos> I think it's one of the Seven Wonders of the World.
-No.<eos> His name is Wilhelm.<eos> He was on the walls today.<eos> I used to serve him.<eos> It is a firm rider ... cruel and ruthless.
These other things that just didn't add up.<eos> They weren't logical, they didn't make sense.<eos> So all kinds of red flags started popping up.<eos> I dunno what's gonna happen with this case, But we are gonna document everything.<eos> Looking back on that day, it turned out to be a day That really changed my life forever.
To hear Courtney's own lawyer, Kurt and Courtney's entertainment lawyer, Rosemary Carroll,<eos> The godmother of Frances Bean, Somebody that knew them better than almost anybody,<eos> Telling Tom that They were in the middle of a divorce,<eos> That Kurt was drawing up a new will, And most importantly, I think the tape<eos> That really had me reeling, Was hearing Rosemary Carroll looking at the suicide note And immediately concluding that it's a forgery.
This is the worst case scenario as far as perhaps him being in a house with someone else.<eos> Sir.<eos> The landline to the apartment's up and running.<eos> If it's him, we've got him located someplace.<eos> This case is breaking so fast, Alex, it's hard to get a breath and it moves to a new phase.
- Business? You and Pete are unarmed security guards.<eos> Don't wait up.<eos> Why don't you ever water the grass?<eos> Why would I water the grass in the winter?<eos> Because you never water it even in the summer and it's always dead.
Mine is 20 minutes up the road in rush hour traffic.<eos> - Tell me something.<eos> - If it's about Mom, I don't wanna hear it.<eos> It's not about Mom. I know you live in a condo... but if you had grass would it be dead or alive?<eos> It would be alive.
'Cause I'm just some stupid fucking girl?<eos> You know, you never... actually gave me a chance to show you what I was capable of.<eos> But you're right.<eos> I didn't finish your formula.<eos> This whole time... you were looking for the "X" factor... when it was right there in front of you.
Steve.<eos> He was 50.<eos> You have my attention.<eos> The Cape gannet.<eos> A diving bird capable of generating speeds of up to 75 miles per hour, turning itself into a missile as it collides with the face of the sea.
And this is not some quaint academic discovery... stuck in the back of an obscure medical journal.<eos> Bennet Omalu is going to war with a corporation... that has 20 million people, on a weekly basis, craving their product, the same way they crave food.<eos> The NFL owns a day of the week.<eos> The same day the church used to own.<eos> Now it's theirs.
Flyboy?<eos> Hurry! Slide down.<eos> They'll be comin' for us.<eos> If I'm gonna trust you, I need to know your name.<eos> It's Hook.
Oh, wow, if it's Bernville, and it's autumn and it's after 6... don't be caught dead without the Bernville Camp for Boys tuxedo.<eos> Made from the finest Dacron in Akron, rubber capital of the world.<eos> It is smart, dashing and now, the Bernville Camp for Boys tuxedo.<eos> If you gotta be bad, but you wanna look good, this is the tux for you... and you, and you and you.<eos> It comes in a rainbow of colors, red, yellow, tan and brown.
- De La Cruz, man, El Diablo.<eos> I don't know about Montgomery anymore.<eos> That's the devil's greatest trick.<eos> What you doing in here, Billy?<eos> You best let that shit out before it eats you alive.
- Shut up!<eos> What, you gonna cry?<eos> Over them?<eos> They made their choice, and they knew their day was gonna come.<eos> And when it comes, are they sorry?
You're supposed to produce it upon request.<eos> How am I supposed to know you're not a villain, kidnapping this woman, without a warrant in your possession?<eos> What's your name, buster?<eos> Well, it certainly isn't Buster.<eos> It's Oswaldo Mobray.
But it's the stew that's got me thinkin'.<eos> Now, how long you said Minnie been gone?<eos> A week?<eos> Si.<eos> See... my mama used to make stew, and it always tasted the same, no matter the meat.
Well, it's about damn time!<eos> Best coffee on the mountain.<eos> I don't know about all that.<eos> Stagecoach drivers like it, passengers not so much.<eos> Most find it a mite too strong.
Okay? I'm talking cold that'll freeze the snot right in your nose.<eos> I'm talking wind that'll cut through your jacket and carve you up like a Ginsu knife.<eos> In fact, most folks in Cicero were scared of winter.<eos> But not Jimmy.<eos> Jimmy would wait around all summer and when September finally rolled around and he'd feel that first cold wind come sweeping off Lake Michigan he knew it was coming.
A basketball weighs between 550 and 650 grams.<eos> - Did you know that?<eos> - No, I didn't know that.<eos> Yes.<eos> The weight's different for men's and women's games, but that's roughly how much it weighs.
Why didn't you tell me that before, when you gave it to me?<eos> I wanted to wait until I took ye back to Lallybroch, so ye'd know the place was as much yours as mine.<eos> Now, I dinna ken when, if ever, we'll get back there.<eos> - Jamie... - That...<eos> That thought doesna pain me as much as it once might have.
- What was that?<eos> If we distract it ...<eos> I might have a clean shot at it with this wand.<eos> Split up. Surround ...<eos> Or, it will pick us off one at a time.
She coats my... hair with sunflower oil.<eos> She's not my fat tart.<eos> What's that ring?<eos> A gift from Babeth.<eos> What's written on it?
Before what?<eos> Before I met you.<eos> - Have you changed?<eos> - I'm off everything.<eos> One coffee's exceptional. For me now, it's a psychotropic.
I'm going to America.<eos> To perform?<eos> Exactly.<eos> But my performance will not just be a show.<eos> It will be a coup.
But look at the date!<eos> The coup is three weeks from today.<eos> Jean-Louis and Jeff arrive next week and I still have no access to the North Tower roof.<eos> Are you going to be able to walk on the wire with that foot?<eos> Yes, it will heal by then, but what am I going to do tomorrow?
But when Papa Rudy's happy, his dogs get a double ration of food.<eos> The most fantastic moment for me was when I saw you answered my shooting signal.<eos> At that moment, I knew the coup would be a success.<eos> What you mean? We almost lost the arrow.<eos> It was on the edge of the building.
Some kind of an experiment?<eos> That's not Boise, okay?<eos> I know Boise.<eos> Your mind is lashing out, Ethan.<eos> It doesn't want to accept the truth, but trust your own eyes, everything you've seen today.
- All right, all right, I get it.<eos> If I run into a gay fat guy named DiGiorno Stuffed Crust, send him your way.<eos> That was a joke.<eos> Did humor get killed off in the apocalypse, too?<eos> No, I think it died about five seconds ago.
You can't do it today?<eos> Then write down your address.<eos> Why my address?<eos> We run a late-night delivery service.<eos> It suits you perfectly.
Jess?<eos> Is America Works a reaction to the president's low approval ratings?<eos> An effort to offer some sign of progress ramping up to the elections?<eos> We've been working on this plan since day one.<eos> It has nothing to do with the approval ratings.
I'm sure if you could see her, she will change her mind.<eos> Do you think I'm well dressed?<eos> What happens?<eos> My dog Brian is dead.<eos> It was only four years younger than me.
I'm sorry.<eos> I was also very sad when my dog died.<eos> What was its name?<eos> His name was Tommy.<eos> It was the last gift from my father before he died.
You know it's for the best.<eos> Don't fight it.<eos> Just accept it.<eos> You see what happens when you try to fight it?<eos> Every 30 years or so the goddamn place just wakes up and it demands new blood, and our town is forced to deliver it.
I know this isn't what you expected... but if you'd just hand over the money... I'll get you Carmen.<eos> You scum-sucking pig.<eos> Hand over the money.<eos> You go screw yourself.<eos> I admire your courage... but it's not worth it.
Maybe.<eos> It seems like you like hard-to-get, And i've made it pretty easy for you.<eos> What are you saying?<eos> If the rest of the footage backs that up, I think i might be in love with you.<eos> Well, it does, and chet owes you 50 bucks.
I'm not asking you to move in or anything.<eos> Just stop living like a homeless person for a night.<eos> Where's the ring?<eos> Uh, I took it off, okay?<eos> I took it off.
Now.<eos> - Tonight.<eos> - May I ask why?<eos> This fight with your father.<eos> The more public it gets, the more visible it gets, the greater the liability I will be for you.
Don't even say his name.<eos> Just tell me where they are!<eos> I am so sorry, Ethan.<eos> Something must have gone wrong with the timer.<eos> It was meant to go off at the fence.
Go on, get back to work.<eos> Bruno...<eos> What did you say that stone was called?<eos> Heliotrope.<eos> It gets its name from the sun because its magic powers come from the surfs rays.
- What does this stone look like?<eos> - All vve know is ifs black.<eos> Forgive me for interrupting... but this stone... this stone!<eos> - This stone...<eos> - What does it look like?
- What did you say?<eos> Come on, I'm going for a swim.<eos> There's a lake clown there.<eos> - What? - The ladies' lake.<eos> - That's What the peasants call it.
- Walk away?<eos> This venture is on shaky footing.<eos> How long before the street realizes this?<eos> How long before the mob is outside your door again?<eos> What happens if this time it won't go away?
The next contact I'll make will be to arrive in Charlestown harbor with you in my possession.<eos> If I sense a trap or my demands are unmet, I'll kill you and throw your body into the bay.<eos> Do you understand?<eos> She's writing the letter now.<eos> I want it on its way to Charlestown before whatever's going to happen here tomorrow happens.
How's your speech?<eos> Do you need any good jokes for it?<eos> The ice drill's en route.<eos> - Really? - Mm.<eos> Left Oslo this morning, so it arrives on Wednesday.
Well, I have no choice. You know that.<eos> The mines are mined out.<eos> There's no future apart from tourism, is there?<eos> Tourists, that's all the glacier really means to you, isn't it?<eos> It means businesses staying in business, Charlie, shops, bars, hotels, restaurants, hire firms, camping equipment.
Oh, no. He stood in a bear trap.<eos> What?<eos> The pulse.<eos> Yes?<eos> It's right here.
- Have you packed the cannon?<eos> - Yes. - Have you packed the chainsaw?<eos> You didn't pack the chainsaw?<eos> Go get the chainsaw, man!<eos> The cement still hasn't dried, but it should be fine by tomorrow night.
It's Vivian!<eos> Do not move!<eos> Evan!<eos> Evan, I'm so sorry I'm late, but that storm blew branches out all over town.<eos> It even knocked two traffic lights out.
You kill me?<eos> Morire plague anyway.<eos> If the worms do not kill me first.<eos> I need to find eel.<eos> It is the key to saving a dear friend.
Okay, well, this is progress, isn't it?<eos> Yes, I guess.<eos> I mean, I found it in Stoddart's study.<eos> He was looking at the images himself, but the scan has Pettigrew's name on it.<eos> And it's creased and folded, as though it's been passed around quite a bit.
Really?<eos> You've never left the Keys.<eos> I went to Orlando once, but it was too cold.<eos> You said the grouper was fresh.<eos> It is fresh.

I think you're really nice, Lena.<eos> Do you want to hold him for a bit?<eos> Head up.<eos> When I was a kid, I'd pretend to have a dog. It was an amazing dog.<eos> I'd pretend it would walk me to school every morning.
I'd pretend it would walk me to school every morning.<eos> All the way there.<eos> Yes, all the way...<eos> - And I'd pat him and tell him to go home.<eos> And it would go home.
Once you go down this road, what if there's no turning back?<eos> I know how you all must feel.<eos> How desperate you must be to go home and be embraced by Nassau again.<eos> But I'm here to tell you, that place no longer exists.<eos> It has been taken from us by a madman.
How on earth is one supposed to dance to it?<eos> Well, you do a sort of slow foxtrot.<eos> Like this.<eos> Do you know, I haven't seen Tom for five days?<eos> Strictly entre-nous, if he doesn't start putting a bit more effort into this romance, it's all just going to fizzle out.
Excessive tilt.<eos> Tilting to 11 with all the gusts of wind.<eos> Copy that.<eos> Everyone, hone in on Martinez's suit.<eos> It'll get you to airlock.
All the other COs are busy, so they send me.<eos> I go.<eos> I get more out of the asset in one night than he's gotten in six months because I knew what I was talking about.<eos> So, I write up the report.<eos> It gets circulated everywhere.
Maybe you should.<eos> I couldn't.<eos> Can't abandon Charlie's...<eos> He knew this place was fierce, merciless.<eos> It's... vivid... and unsullied... and wild.
All right.<eos> They say the mezcal worm is an aphrodisiac.<eos> If a man and woman eat the worm together, then their night will be a delirium of ecstasy and passion.<eos> They say that, huh?<eos> They also say that it's a ferocious irritant of the urinary tract.
- Two.<eos> One mechanical, the other digital.<eos> If we get past the rolling encryption code, I'll have to drill through six inches of reinforced steel to disable the tumbler system.<eos> Job can handle the encryption code.<eos> - It changes every 12 minutes.
"Jim."<eos> If I go, bowling and I throw a strike, one thing happened. Ten things did not happen.<eos> Jim, my people are not bowling pins. As much as your guy may have treated them as such.<eos> If... Let me finish. Let me finish.<eos> If your house is insured for $100,000. And, a tornado carries it away, it carried away one house.

Let me finish. Let me finish.<eos> If your house is insured for $100,000. And, a tornado carries it away, it carried away one house.<eos> It did not pick up every stick of furniture. And, destroy it in a separate incident.
What, you couldn't have done better, Torstein!<eos> I don't care about that game.<eos> I want you to cut off my arm.<eos> - Why not keep it?<eos> - Because it's killing me, stupid.
I like to experiment between our cultures.<eos> Plowing, fertilizing, and sowing seed are the very basis of life.<eos> Indeed they are.<eos> Well, give this plow to your settlers.<eos> Let them see if it works.
All the pain is going away.<eos> I am taking your pain.<eos> Hush, good boy.<eos> There is no more pain.<eos> No more pain, it's all going away.
Harbard is not a human being.<eos> Harbard is a god.<eos> He came to visit.<eos> And such a visit must always be celebrated.<eos> Even if it leads to death?
Harbard is a god.<eos> He came to visit.<eos> And such a visit must always be celebrated.<eos> Even if it leads to death?<eos> If it leads to death, it also leads to life.
Rollo.<eos> I have nothing to say to you, priest.<eos> Except this...<eos> Where is your arm ring?<eos> Where is it?
I'd like to speak with my guests privately for a moment.<eos> Wait in the hall, please.<eos> I believe there is a way that I can help you achieve your intentions for the future of Nassau.<eos> And I am ready to do it.<eos> However, my plan will require an act of you, Mr. McGraw, if it is to succeed.
You see, the thing is... To be honest, Aunt Etta, I know you and mom had difficulties and I just thought we could get it out there and deal with it.<eos> Dear, maybe now's not a good time.<eos> It's Christmas, what could be a better time?<eos> Christmas is all about forgiveness and family and tradition.<eos> If you just believe, if you let that spirit in, it fills you.
Listen good, you gotta bring the creature back to the grove.<eos> But you gotta be careful, it won't come willingly.<eos> It's tasted human pleasures.<eos> What about Will?<eos> The only way is to bring the changeling back, but don't let it sense your intension, it senses things.
But you gotta be careful, it won't come willingly.<eos> It's tasted human pleasures.<eos> What about Will?<eos> The only way is to bring the changeling back, but don't let it sense your intension, it senses things.<eos> It cannot feel threatened.
Your husband blew up a truck last night on Main Street.<eos> - Nearly killed my son.<eos> - I'm so sorry, Ethan.<eos> Something must have gone wrong with the timer.<eos> It was meant to go off at the fence.
Oh, my God!<eos> That was awesome!<eos> Hold on tight.<eos> We're gonna give you an even closer look at our Mosasaurus.<eos> It had 88 teeth!
What do you think?<eos> Want to take one home?<eos> Hey, don't joke.<eos> When I was your age, I rescued a wolf pup.<eos> It was, like, two months old.
Hey, don't joke.<eos> When I was your age, I rescued a wolf pup.<eos> It was, like, two months old.<eos> It could barely walk.<eos> It used to sleep by my bed.
Never mind.<eos> He's likely caught up in the evacuation.<eos> You're sure there's nobody else who can fly a helicopter?<eos> We don't need anyone else.<eos> You think it's out there?
He's likely caught up in the evacuation.<eos> You're sure there's nobody else who can fly a helicopter?<eos> We don't need anyone else.<eos> You think it's out there?<eos> I mean, I know for a fact it is definitely not out there, all right?
Along there.<eos> Apples, fresh apples!<eos> Fresh apples!<eos> The tower.<eos> Where is it now?
Maybe he knows.<eos> Heidi, you can't talk to a beggar!<eos> Heidi!<eos> This way.<eos> There it is.
You're not allowed to say.<eos> Damn!<eos> Come on, goats!<eos> Where is the wheelchair?<eos> Heidi, where is it?
Damn!<eos> Come on, goats!<eos> Where is the wheelchair?<eos> Heidi, where is it?<eos> It's not here.
Heidi, where is it?<eos> It's not here.<eos> It's not here either.<eos> It can't just disappear.<eos> Grandfather, it's not here.
It's not here.<eos> It's not here either.<eos> It can't just disappear.<eos> Grandfather, it's not here.<eos> - What? It's gone?
Is there a trick to get it out of the moomoo?<eos> I only know how it goes in.<eos> Oh, man, Zeki, really?<eos> Shake her, Meike, and then like I said.<eos> - Can it slip into my innards?
- Hey, not so loud.<eos> Somebody might hear.<eos> Excuse my indiscretion.<eos> I forgot how important your job is to you.<eos> Maybe it is now.
My name is...<eos> Kunibert Sturm.<eos> No.<eos> Your name is Wallisch!<eos> No, it's Kunibert Sturm.
I shall not detain your husband long, madam.<eos> Perhaps a tea?<eos> Seed cake?<eos> Arabella does not care for seed cake.<eos> It is a thing that she particularly dislikes.
That is a different kind of magic to that which... ~ It is not modern magic.<eos> ~ So? It is not straightforward.<eos> I would think one would have to negotiate with the trees.<eos> You've moved churches and rivers.<eos> I cannot think it would be so difficult to move a forest - it is not so very large.
I regularly demand the impossible of my engineers, generals and officers. I see no reason to make an exception in your case.<eos> ~ I'm at the limit of my magic.<eos> ~ Find other magic!<eos> Do not give yourself too much grief.<eos> Your mist may have lost him his cannon, but... it saved our lives.
Megan?<eos> We have no time.<eos> There's a western tunnel. It leads to an elevator.<eos> I know the code.<eos> It will take you to the Mountain Complex... to David.
Forgive me, Your Majesty but this statement mocks the court.<eos> You appear to be the only one laughing, Minister.<eos> Every man has the right to prove his merit.<eos> A son does not inherit his father's wisdom simply by wearing his turban.<eos> Even a sandalwood tree needs time to age before it produces fragrance.
(A Hindu tradition of giving blessings)<eos> Thank you for keeping my honour, My Lady.<eos> It lightens my mind.<eos> Don't forget My Lord...<eos> This welcome stops at the threshold, it doesn't extend to the heart.
- How are you?<eos> - Good.<eos> And you?<eos> I like your hat.<eos> It looks good on you.
And you?<eos> I like your hat.<eos> It looks good on you.<eos> - Do you think so?<eos> - Yes, it looks good.
Let me see this.<eos> I know the CIA has intel on this man.<eos> Now, are you going to give me access or not?<eos> Technically, the room isn't white.<eos> It's more of a... burgundy.
- I can't...<eos> I'm losing control!<eos> Control your emotions.<eos> There's another way.<eos> Don't destroy the talisman - it's too powerful... too important.
Is she OK?<eos> - What's happened?<eos> - What happened to her?<eos> This place needs a human consciousness to restore balance, right?<eos> And... and it responds to my emotions?
You're flickering.<eos> Why are you flickering?<eos> You still don't understand, Andy.<eos> We think we've found another altar.<eos> It's miles away, and we don't have much time.
It's the only way out.<eos> (Banging) Don't go.<eos> There's no room for fear.<eos> What's down there, let it tear down the walls, let it set you free.<eos> His scent is here, but it's weak.
Stop!<eos> Aleister wasn't able to control us as wolves.<eos> What if Clay can change?<eos> Clay?<eos> It's him.
Essentia crescat.<eos> One skin cell, one strand of hair, that's all I need to grow a piece of Aleister.<eos> There is no getting used to this.<eos> What will this spell accomplish?<eos> It will kill Aleister.
A premonition of something that will happen.<eos> The Undoing has begun.<eos> Unless we kill him by sunrise, all the witches will be dead.<eos> What will the spell accomplish?<eos> It will kill Aleister.
Come and say that to my face.<eos> Don't get too close!<eos> If she gets your blood in that bowl, you'll be dead in seconds.<eos> She won't break the Circle.<eos> It's the only thing protecting her.
When the plums ripen next year, I'll make you a batch without alcohol.<eos> The plums are from our garden?<eos> Yes, that's right.<eos> You can see our plum tree from here.<eos> Didn't you notice it?
Yes, that's right.<eos> You can see our plum tree from here.<eos> Didn't you notice it?<eos> Look, there.<eos> It grows a lot of plums.
Eddie, my boy, you know that I love you.<eos> And why not?<eos> You're a genius, you shit gold, and Oscars are made of gold.<eos> But this film is different.<eos> It's humane, you know?
And why not?<eos> You're a genius, you shit gold, and Oscars are made of gold.<eos> But this film is different.<eos> It's humane, you know?<eos> It's deep, it's ambiguous.
- I can't.<eos> - Why not?<eos> It's my penis.<eos> - Go on. - My penis is very small. It went smell.<eos> It was huge before and now it's small.
Yeah, well you're so stupid right now.<eos> Come on, let's go.<eos> Where'd you put the purchase order?<eos> I can't find it.<eos> It's right there.
I'm the personal trainer.<eos> Oh, that's the wrong thing you wanna be right now. Motherfucker!<eos> Baby, you're the best.<eos> Darling.<eos> Emma's mind feels like it's about to explode.
This was forwarded to me.<eos> It's for you.<eos> - From the disciplinary tribunal?<eos> I'm getting legal assistance.<eos> - It's not from them.
Anne's replacing all our chairs with these posture balls.<eos> She's got a whole truckload.<eos> So I'm gonna need your chair, Doris.<eos> I like my chair.<eos> It has a back.
On the way back... I saw a huge bear down on the foreshore dragging its kill across the rocks and the ice floes.<eos> I knew at once what this was going to be.<eos> I pulled over, took my rifle... ran down onto the foreshore.<eos> The bear... was leaning over its kill, and... and in a split-second, I took aim.<eos> I could see that what it was tearing apart wasn't a seal.
Please. Help yourself and tell me what you did. Nothing.<eos> I swear.<eos> I swear to God I didn't do anything.<eos> The procedure is painful.<eos> It's invasive and possibly... unethical. And I don't want us to be railroaded.
It's all so pretty.<eos> The way the light hits things, I mean.<eos> But there's so much I don't remember.<eos> That's a result of the accident that brought you here.<eos> It robbed you of your memory, you see.
And I can't imagine anyone has looked at them in years.<eos> In the 11th century a Carthusian monk known to us only as Brother Gregory began to lose his mind.<eos> He said he was possessed by a demon perhaps the father of all demons the fallen angel himself.<eos> In any event, this demon spoke to him in the Verbis Diablo.<eos> Brother Gregory wrote down what it said on whatever was to hand.
- Yes.<eos> But I can't remember which ones.<eos> Pretty, isn't it?<eos> We must prepare for battle.<eos> When it comes, it comes fully and to the end.
And honestly... those aren't very sensible shoes.<eos> But I'm frightened.<eos> What horrors might it contain?<eos> Behold the evil wonders of Lucifer.<eos> I don't admit to my real name, it's beneath contempt.
What do you think of my beard?<eos> - I'm sorry?<eos> - My beard.<eos> I've had it for as long as I can remember.<eos> I don't know that it entirely suits me.
Why don't you take that?<eos> This is your house now.<eos> We'll have to replenish the stores.<eos> I know the forest.<eos> It'll supply us.
Do you know of the medical neurosis called the phantom limb?<eos> It's not uncommon when people lose an arm or a leg or such.<eos> When I lost my arm, I was constantly reaching for things with it.<eos> It seemed so real.<eos> But it wasn't.
You want a brandy?<eos> Because Duck's going to get the check.<eos> Well, unfortunately, we've discovered that the cancer has spread from the lung and metastasized to the bones and to lymph nodes in the mediastinum.<eos> I don't understand what you're saying.<eos> It's aggressive and it's very advanced.
Come down.<eos> Only to throw you under a train.<eos> Come on.<eos> I only have one question. I better have gotten that lousy job.<eos> You did, and it's not lousy.
Come have a seat.<eos> I have some serious news.<eos> It's bad news.<eos> Your mother is sick.<eos> She has lung cancer and it's very advanced.
Hey!<eos> Things are getting testy out there. Come on.<eos> We better move this along.<eos> Vincent's boundary is too strong, but what Davina and I can do is cast a disruption spell.<eos> It would temporarily neutralize all magical objects in this compound, including the compound itself.
License and registration, please, ma'am.<eos> Uh, yes.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Um... I, um, don't have my license on me right now.<eos> It's at my house.
Good fucking question.<eos> Dame.<eos> Fuck.<eos> Inmate, there've been complaints about moldy rice.<eos> I need you to show me where you store it.
Of course, I play Edwina.<eos> I know she has freckles and a more ample bosom than I, but I think we can use our imaginations.<eos> How do I put this constructively?<eos> This piece of writing is".obscene.<eos> It's pornographic.

Maybe later.<eos> My back is acting up.<eos> You're sweet, my friend. Thank you.<eos> The pain is moving around.<eos> It travels from my back, down my arms. Sometimes in my hips. Lower.
Look what happened the last time you told her one of our secrets.<eos> Look, look.<eos> Everything is gonna be fine, okay?<eos> We'll run the DNA test.<eos> It'll show that he was the father, and then hopefully, the laptop will prove that he was on the roof of the sorority house.
You want the charges dropped against your client, I understand, Ms. Keating, but the evidence you're presenting here today in court is circumstantial at best.<eos> That's only because a key piece of evidence against Mr. Keating is being held hostage by Ms. Parks.<eos> I have no idea what she's talking about, Your Honor.<eos> My husband's laptop is being held in police lockup.<eos> It likely contains his cell coordinates, proving that he was at Kappa Kappa Theta house the night of the murder.
Oh, it's from his grandma!<eos> Hm. My engagement ring is gone!<eos> I lost it!<eos> - What is that?<eos> - It's a fake.
Of course I do.<eos> I gave it to my husband on our wedding day.<eos> Any idea why we found it in the woods?<eos> I'm on it.<eos> Of course I don't know how it got there.
I'm on it.<eos> Of course I don't know how it got there.<eos> Right.<eos> There was also a fingerprint on the ring.<eos> Do you know who it belongs to?
Goodbye, kids.<eos> Love you!<eos> Goodbye, Mom!<eos> The probability of a 6,000-mile-diameter meteorite hitting Earth is almost zero.<eos> But it doesn't need to be that big. Six miles in diameter would be plenty!
- Get your scissors away from my rug!<eos> - Fine, fine.<eos> I'll go alphabetize the spices.<eos> No. They're in order of how often we use them.<eos> Leave the allspice in the back where it belongs.
That it is.<eos> It's the consistency that kills me.<eos> I can't get around it.<eos> And there's that weird metallic taste.<eos> Is it metallic?
You found out that your best friend was going to be your son-in-law, And it was a bridge too far.<eos> You snapped. Ravi:<eos> Stop!<eos> Hold that position!<eos> The angle of the brush, it had to be swung from above javier by someone taller, But if javier was on the bottom step... (ravi grunts)
It's not like Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, right?<eos> Some bald guy with horns isn't gonna rip my heart out.<eos> Dude, that movie's an imperialist fantasy that makes the followers of a beautiful and peaceful religion look like a bunch of bloodthirsty barbarians.<eos> You love that movie.<eos> Yeah, it's pretty great.
You name it, we're doing it.<eos> Basket weaving at the craft museum.<eos> Well, you named it.<eos> Oh, here's another one.<eos> I wish that the apple pancake mix was on the top shelf because it starts with an "A," but I don't put it there because I don't want you breaking one of your little legs when you're supposed to be making my breakfast.
I've brought your pan back, but it's a bit burned.<eos> God almighty!<eos> How could you... lt's easily replaced.<eos> You silly thing, Janka! What can do I with that?<eos> Throw it away. It's easily replaced, I told you.
Yes, sir.<eos> My father used to mine soil and rocks, and sometimes, he said...<eos> Ah! His tools!<eos> He said sometimes, the heavens would drop a rock to the Earth, a rock full of riches.<eos> It is north of the wall.
Are you sure?<eos> Look.<eos> The druids prophesized that a favorable omen would show in the sky.<eos> And it has.<eos> A dragon has returned to our lands, and I believe it brought you to us.
Look.<eos> The druids prophesized that a favorable omen would show in the sky.<eos> And it has.<eos> A dragon has returned to our lands, and I believe it brought you to us.<eos> It saved your life.
Bonded, just like Merlin said.<eos> If you die, so does the dragon.<eos> So valuable.<eos> Brude chose the moon to be his spirit guide.<eos> When it ebbs, at dawn, his powers will be at his weakest.
Good evening.<eos> I'm Noah Meluban. The General Security Services inventor.<eos> Look, I bought this pruner in a gardening store.<eos> I added here at the edge two nails.<eos> I learned in Cambridge that the penis has such an elastic tissue that it heals in no time.
And then it can't be proven.<eos> Shall we talk about you guys a bit?<eos> I broke it.<eos> He broke it.<eos> Give me the computer even if it's broken.
You better believe it.<eos> How come we always enter through the back door?<eos> Because we never use the front entrance of our house.<eos> Why not?<eos> Because then it would get dirty.
- What the fuck? !<eos> You've spent your life trying to understand what happened to you.<eos> If you don't let me go, you might never find out.<eos> - Oh, my God, I'm losing my mind.<eos> - No, it's just expanding.
Okay. Okay.<eos> But you know where the penis goes, right?<eos> - The penis goes in your mouth.<eos> - The vagina.<eos> It goes in your mouth.
Jesus.<eos> Just--<eos> It's in the mail, okay?<eos> The check.<eos> Just-- if it hasn't come by Tuesday,
Missionary? Let's do it right here.<eos> Kurt? Why don't you get out your big old cock and just shove it right in her.<eos> - That's enough.<eos> - How about that? - That's enough. - You don't have to do circles anymore,<eos> - because it's big. We've all seen it.
- Just get on with it.<eos> - On with what?<eos> What you're here for.<eos> There's no way this little visit could possibly mean anything good for me.<eos> It's very good for you.
- Thank you, Your Grace.<eos> - Thank you, Your Grace.<eos> - Take the head. - Pardon me, Your Grace.<eos> I would take it, if you don't mind.<eos> It could prove useful for my work.
Oh, Aunt Dorothy, it's so great to see you.<eos> Yeah, well, your sister's no Mother Teresa, but at least she swings by every once in a while to make sure that I'm not dead.<eos> So, where's the nog?<eos> I need to get merry.<eos> Uh, It's in the kitchen.
I just wanna get these rewrapped for the kids.<eos> It's important.<eos> The snowplow?<eos> The keys were in the ignition and it was beat to hell.<eos> But if it runs, I drive it back here, then everyone piles in the car and follows, while I clear a path in front of us.
You OK? You're tense.<eos> - No, not at all.<eos> - Yes, you are.<eos> Look at your chest.<eos> It's going in and out like a piston.
- I know the way.<eos> I love your lipstick.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> I said, I love your lipstick.<eos> It doesn t stain cigarette butts.
Me?<eos> I m on the side of love.<eos> I ve always been that way.<eos> You have to like the war to make a choice. I don t like it.<eos> It s always taken away what I ve loved the most.
I kille her.<eos> It ha to be me.<eos> How was Ron's house?<eos> What o you think of this place?<eos> Well, I think it seems... nice.
It was open.<eos> I aske Gabriel to close it.<eos> Go.<eos> I in't bring it in.<eos> It got insie on its own.
It's not in your nature.<eos> What do you want?<eos> It's just that it's your birthday tomorrow.<eos> I always like to get my presents early.<eos> Makes your special day feel longer 'cause it starts the day before.
Who cares?<eos> He stole the idea and doesn't deserve his own joke.<eos> Is that really true?<eos> Of course, that's how you know it's a good joke.<eos> It not only entertains, it informs.
It would be humiliating.<eos> Well, now we have two reasons.<eos> They have it.<eos> Please, can we watch it? Please?<eos> Fine, but I'm telling you-- it's terrible.
And failing that, suggest that his mother enjoys a string of both human and non-human lovers.<eos> Sheldon, my name's on that paper, too.<eos> There's no upside to doing this.<eos> He just left another comment.<eos> What does it say?
Ooh!<eos> Okay, let's hope one of the clues is written on a pair of clean underwear.<eos> Mr. and Mrs. Wolowitz?<eos> As far as I can tell, your bag arrived in Los Angeles.<eos> So, where is it?
Oh, got the key!<eos> So, that's the key to the door?<eos> That's it?<eos> We spent $200 on six minutes of fun?<eos> It's like when you bought that remote-controlled helicopter, and it just... flew away.
I think I started to suspect it was a bad movie when I looked at the script and saw the title,<eos> Serial Ape-ist 2:<eos> Monkey See, Monkey Kill.<eos> Uh, spoiler alert:<eos> after the monkey sees, it kills.
It really is.<eos> Oh, you guys are very sweet.<eos> So, Penny, listen, I saw your movie.<eos> Oh, wow.<eos> I wish it was better.
I'll be hitching my pants up to my armpits and complaining about the awful music the kids are listening to.<eos> It is awful, isn't it?<eos> Listen to that noise.<eos> Hang on, hang on.<eos> It's working!
We did not.<eos> That's not true.<eos> Can I speak to you alone for a second?<eos> Oh, sure.<eos> It came from Tiffany's.
Much better!<eos> Hans Peter? My husband?<eos> The Camino robs you of all of your strength... and gives you three times as much back.<eos> And to all those who cannot walk the Camino, rest assured, this Way is only one of an endless number of possibilities.<eos> It isn't a single way but a thousand ways.
Hans Peter? My husband?<eos> The Camino robs you of all of your strength... and gives you three times as much back.<eos> And to all those who cannot walk the Camino, rest assured, this Way is only one of an endless number of possibilities.<eos> It isn't a single way but a thousand ways.<eos> And it asks only one question of everyone: "Who are you?"
Who's HP'?<eos> That's my grandson.<eos> My boy. Our boy!<eos> Sooner or later this Way will shake everyone to the core.<eos> You have to walk it alone, or it will not reveal its secret.
Well done.<eos> Welcome to Santiago.<eos> - Thank you. Something inside me struck a giant gong.<eos> And the sound will reverberate.<eos> I know it will slowly fade, but if I prick up my ears, I'll be able to sense its echo for a long time.
- Where are you taking me?<eos> - Home.<eos> The Boltons have Winterfell.<eos> The marriage proposal...<eos> It wasn't for you?
It's her name I need, not her virtue.<eos> Then I have delivered everything I've promised.<eos> And you prepared for the consequences.<eos> When the Lannisters hear I've wed Sansa Stark to Ramsay.<eos> The Lannister name doesn't mean what it once did.
My father, who publically sentenced me to death?<eos> I'd say his thoughts on having me killed were abundantly clear.<eos> Is that why you killed him?<eos> Someday, if you decide not to execute me, I'll tell you all about why I killed my father.<eos> And on that day, should it ever come, we'll need more wine than this.
There's many factors.<eos> - Spite doesn't have to be one of them.<eos> - I was on the fence till you showed up.<eos> Thanks for helping me decide.<eos> Wave bye-bye to your cash cow because it's leaving the pasture.
So I seek out psychotherapists just to save the DKK 875 an hour plus taxes? That's a lunatic question!<eos> This is all highly offensive.<eos> Can I go on without interruptions?<eos> Good.<eos> So, I try and hug the bird, but, oh, no. It just pulls away from me.
- What tower? Your tower?<eos> - The stork tower.<eos> The island's had a stork from back when my sister and I were children.<eos> But then it just disappeared.<eos> I put up hay and food in case it returns.
It wasn't my hate that kept me going. It was my love...<eos> Previously on Falling Skies.<eos> Since I woke up with the spikes, I feel like... I'm drawn to you.<eos> Espheni power core, was never on earth in the first place.<eos> It powers the entire Espheni war machine.
It's not some claustrophobic little closet that smells like acetone.<eos> Room to grow.<eos> Dream big, I say.<eos> Got a decent-size conference room.<eos> Not as big as Hamlin's but, you know, it's cosy.
So how do we get started?<eos> Do you need us to sign that little paper?<eos> I am... I am very sorry, but I'm afraid I can't take your case.<eos> My schedule is just...<eos> It's just chock-full right now.
Get your strength back.<eos> So, you stay lying down, you.<eos> And it's okay, I'll be right here.<eos> That night, I had a dream.<eos> Next week, we'll discuss economic concepts... it felt so real, even though I knew it couldn't be, or wasn't yet.
Like catching a ball...<eos> He just sticks out his hands...<eos> So, now, everybody's out, and I'm thinking how the heck is this pilot, right, how's he gonna get out?<eos> But he maneuvers off the port bow and he hovers there for the longest time doing, you know, what we learn later, uh, taking off his flight suit.<eos> And somehow he rolls the bird on its side, and just before it hits the water, he jumps.
Why do you keep looking out the window, Will?<eos> You like the snow?<eos> You know, for some people, snow brings on a very specific feeling.<eos> Uh, some love it.<eos> It feels clean and pure, like a... fresh start or a beginning.
You like the snow?<eos> You know, for some people, snow brings on a very specific feeling.<eos> Uh, some love it.<eos> It feels clean and pure, like a... fresh start or a beginning.<eos> For others, it's frightening.
Unless she gets the right medication, she'll soon be dead.<eos> You know the problem with buying medicine in this country is that you never know if what you're buying is real... or counterfeit.<eos> The doctors assure me that these will have an immediate impact on your mother's health.<eos> What do I have to do for them?<eos> All you need to do is protect this bag and make sure it arrives at this address by midnight tonight.
Looks like this laddie's on his way.<eos> All right. Let's get you inside.<eos> Jenny, it feels to me that this baby is breech.<eos> He's in the wrong position.<eos> The head should be down here, but it's still up here.
"pale death visits with impartial foot<eos> "the cottages of the poor and the castles of the rich."<eos> These were made for Mary Stuart.<eos> Real barrel of laughs, that one.<eos> You know, I don't mind death As long as it comes under an open sky.
We must hold everyone in government accountable to the law.<eos> But we must not manufacture our interpretation of the law to erode constitutional authority.<eos> We can prosecute presidents, but not the presidency.<eos> We have to assume this is happening.<eos> We need to end her campaign before it begins.
Yeah. Complete and total.<eos> Yes, ma'am, we're having trouble with the power as well.<eos> It's most likely related to the storm.<eos> Parrish!<eos> Check the backup generator and make sure it's fueled.
Of course, it's only a drop in the bucket.<eos> I swear, everyone I know has had problems with them.<eos> I had one.<eos> The computer in the engine, it locked in the middle of the Rockies.<eos> Yeah, it decided I was overheating and that was it.
Never mind, I forgive you.<eos> You've got me now.<eos> Gigs, can we turn the annoying bot off?<eos> I can't, sir.<eos> It has an infinite Helium-3 battery.
Battle Creek is, like, a step down from Boise.<eos> Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.<eos> Right here... think I got something.<eos> Boy, someone must really hate you.<eos> Looks like a print, but... it's unlike any print that I've seen before.
The ring of the Magi.<eos> Where is the ring?<eos> I don't see a ring.<eos> The five maidens are your five fingers, and the serpent is the sacred ring.<eos> You know where it is.
And the ring?<eos> He appeared not to know about the ring.<eos> But you could tell he was lying.<eos> Yes.<eos> I'm reasonably sure he knew where it was.
You know what this means?<eos> You don't?<eos> No.<eos> Do you expect me to believe that?<eos> Where is it?
- Guess?<eos> What good is that if he doesn't know?<eos> He does know!<eos> Why is it so important?<eos> It belonged to King Aegeus.
What have you been doing with yourself?<eos> You look so different.<eos> You look exactly the same.<eos> Good, you found my backpack.<eos> Yes, it was in the storage room.
I warn you. If you lay hands on a Spanish citizen, there will be dangerous consequences.<eos> The French will never let you leave with that cipher.<eos> Perales will arrange something.<eos> I have never understood irrational hatred.<eos> It stifles every decent impulse, destroys common sense and reason.
Get On with it.<eos> You never asked me my real name.<eos> Because I don't care.<eos> I'll give you a clue.<eos> It's not Anne or Your Majesty.
They were not from God.<eos> I renounce them.<eos> What are you saying? They've corrupted you somehow...<eos> This holy war was a phantom of my imagination.<eos> It can only end in your deaths.
Your towering stature can help us finance the new Knick.<eos> The donors want to see you performing magic in the surgical theater, not you hunched over some microscope.<eos> That's a waste of your time at that.<eos> I don't see how excessive use of narcotics is worthy of scientific study.<eos> Because it needs to be cured and it should be treated like any other disease.
I saw you beat this slug three weeks ago.<eos> Pinned him faster than he did you.<eos> That match was fixed.<eos> What was that, fella?<eos> It was fixed.
I paid you in heroin.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Everyone knew you were the famous Dr. Thackery.<eos> You say I fixed it with a gold earring?<eos> It belonged to my mother.
When was this taken?<eos> Last week.<eos> It has to be removed.<eos> How?<eos> It's taken over her esophagus.
It has to be removed.<eos> How?<eos> It's taken over her esophagus.<eos> There's no way to remove it without tearing out her throat.<eos> Well, it can't stay in there.
Won't happen. I am with you.<eos> 100 per cent.<eos> You won't have to anything or go anywhere.<eos> It was the war, Mel.<eos> It affected us all.
Hey, you want your reputation back?<eos> We need to know... now.<eos> We didn't put a test batch of substances out there.<eos> A snail-mail parcel with a tiny amount of ingredients went missing.<eos> We didn't circulate this shit. Why would we when it's not commercially ready?
You're right, i did.<eos> Why don't you get the hell out of my office And go laugh somewhere else?<eos> Oh, you want to hit me now?<eos> Yeah, well, why don't you go ask mike ross about my headlock?<eos> 'cause it's a goddamn vice.
I've been working for seven hours because if i tell harvey What's going on before i have a fix, He is gonna pull the plug.<eos> Well, then maybe the plug needs to be pulled.<eos> Rachel, just because joe henderson is A bullshit plaintiff doesn't mean They didn't cover things up.<eos> It doesn't mean that they did.<eos> Okay, fine. Why would he ask for that report If he knew it would hurt our case?
Clever woman, your mother is.<eos> You make all the moves, yet, somehow, she wins all the games.<eos> We know about the man you sent to Minos' camp... the Dorian.<eos> Bold move.<eos> Was it a success?
Well, where are they?<eos> Looks like it's just us here... brother.<eos> A bronze bull?<eos> I'll need 200 men and 4,000 swords to smelt into its Armour.<eos> And of course, I'll need all our craftsmen, carpenters, and blacksmiths to work night and day if we're to have it ready in five days.
Three!<eos> General Kastor, see that Daedalus has what he needs.<eos> But Majesty, we have yet to hear how this bronze bull will open the gates of Athens.<eos> Isn't it obvious?<eos> It will ram them.
I will cut you, Athenian.<eos> Stand back.<eos> Guard!<eos> Where did you find that bird?<eos> It flew into my room, Majesty.
- Why?<eos> - Because I'm pre-med.<eos> But why do you want to be a doctor?<eos> Do you even know the satisfaction level of doctors today?<eos> - It's like 5%.
Know what?<eos> Whether you're the cat or the mouse?<eos> You remember that viral video where the bobcat snatches the shark out of the ocean?<eos> It's sick.<eos> And up to that moment, I bet you the shark thought it was the apex predator.
He's... he's AWOL right now. I'm sorry, Sam.<eos> I went by to see a friend of his, a kid studying to be a priest.<eos> He kept saying he hadn't heard from Walt. I just wanted to slap the taste right out of his mouth.<eos> You know, you may not want to make that layer any thicker.<eos> You know, anymore paint, and it'll run and sag.
I still have scars on my stomach from the second-degree burns.<eos> Stop it!<eos> Fucking monsters.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> That locker room might have made my father the man that he is, but it also made me the woman that I am.
He was my husband, I loved him, but I... I couldn't say goodbye.<eos> But you have now.<eos> I don't believe it's possible.<eos> Death doesn't let you say goodbye.<eos> It just... carves holes in your life... in your future... in your heart.
Coming to the match?<eos> - Are you going?<eos> - All the girls in the village are.<eos> They've organised a bus to take us.<eos> Where does it go from?
It's origins are European, yes.<eos> The enclosures open only from the top, yes?<eos> - Just as you specified.<eos> - And the incinerator?<eos> It's being prefab in another facility.
Who do you know that hates you that much?<eos> No idea.<eos> Look, you don't want me here, I don't want to be here. So, why don't you just drop me off at the next port and I'll be on my way?<eos> What?<eos> Once a kill warrant is written, it's guaranteed. Meaning?
What do you want to know?<eos> No, I mean, if you could just give me some pointers and...<eos> Probably easier if I just did it.<eos> There's this doctor, Joseph Rawlings, but he changed his name in 2007 when he came here from England.<eos> Now it's Richardson.
- It's the truth.<eos> You didn't sign the PRP.<eos> I didn't sign the what?<eos> It's the retrofit...<eos> It's the retrofit proposal to overhaul this bucket before it breaks apart. - Ah.
Hi Dagny.<eos> God you're beautiful.<eos> Famous words to a succubus.<eos> The last thing your mother said to me was your name.<eos> It means new day.
It found us.<eos> Don't be afraid, Clarke.<eos> Death is not the end.<eos> We are not dying here.<eos> I need your spirit to stay where it is.
Good.<eos> And, uh, your mother wanted to be here, too.<eos> I know, but the wounded in Tondc need her more.<eos> Field commanders, today's the day we get our people back.<eos> The enemy thinks it's safe behind its doors, but it's not.
And, uh, your mother wanted to be here, too.<eos> I know, but the wounded in Tondc need her more.<eos> Field commanders, today's the day we get our people back.<eos> The enemy thinks it's safe behind its doors, but it's not.<eos> When it realizes that, it will fight back...
My name is Alie.<eos> How do you know my name?<eos> Thelonious.<eos> It's a good name.<eos> It has a double meaning.
We don't know that I have to be in contact with it.<eos> All we know is that we need it. No, no, no.<eos> All we know is, he says we need it.<eos> We don't even know what he wants us to do with it.<eos> Okay, step a time, all right? We play it safe, we learn whatever this spell is, how it works, and we keep the Blade out of my hand. Wait a second.
These questions... of good and evil, as important as they are, have no place in a court of law.<eos> Only the facts matter.<eos> My client claims he acted in self-defense.<eos> Mr. Prohaszka's associates have refused to make a statement regarding the incident.<eos> The only other witness, a frightened young woman, has stated that my client was pleasant and friendly, and that she only saw the struggle with Mr. Prohaszka after it had started.

Peg had a kinda emergency, and you know.<eos> Well...<eos> You know that check you gave me? For the down payment?<eos> Yeah?<eos> Yeah, it bounced.
Figure we'd agree Friday.<eos> If you don't got the money, I'll go ahead and sell to him.<eos> The other buyer.<eos> Like I said, he's up in Sleepy Eye.<eos> Take a look at that grinder, will ya? It's making a funny noise.
It's, like, stuck in my head. What?<eos> What book?<eos> It's about this guy who, every day, he pushes this rock up this hill.<eos> Like a boulder.<eos> And then every night, it just rolls back down.
No!<eos> Then, as he killed both friend and foe alike, it became clear that Hanzee was on a mission.<eos> To find the beautician and her butcher's assistant husband, and silence them once and for all.<eos> Again, the question of why has puzzled historians for decades.<eos> It's true that they had seen him execute Dodd Gerhardt, and that they were the only ones left who could reveal his treachery for what it was.
I'm...<eos> What did you do?<eos> It took a while, but I healed you, brought you back from death using this.<eos> Your pendant.<eos> You said it would protect me.
Look, D, nobody in this city is safe with this witch Dahlia coming around.<eos> Now Klaus is off the rails and he won't trust anyone and he won't share the one weapon that'll take down this witch.<eos> If things go south, that dagger might come in handy.<eos> Kol gave me that dagger for my protection.<eos> I'll be the one who decides if it gets used.
What did you do to me?<eos> Hope's blood is now in you.<eos> You are now the bait.<eos> And this body is still linked to Davina and those children.<eos> If I leave it and it dies, then Davina and the others die with it.
In my youth, wolves and witches had a peace.<eos> Voodoo queen I knew showed me how to use herbs to tell when magic's afoot.<eos> Combine Solomon Seal and Snapdragon and burn them.<eos> If the smoke is white, all's clear.<eos> If it's black, there's a hex in the air, and if it's red, well, then you know you're in trouble.
Then I recalled what I saw when I looked inside your mind, the day you all swore and oath to stand by one another always and forever.<eos> There's strength in such vows.<eos> I can assure you it has not been free of consequence.<eos> That is an understatement.<eos> Ask me, that vow's been more trouble than it's worth.
In every moment, a choice exists.<eos> We can cling to the past or embrace the inevitability of change... And allow a brighter future to unfold before us.<eos> Such an uncertain future may call for even more uncertain allies.<eos> Either way, a new day is coming, whether we like it or not.<eos> The question is will you control it, or will it control you?
Some days, you control the demon...<eos> This is my house!<eos> You ok?<eos> And other days, it controls you.<eos> And it is always hungry.
This is my house!<eos> You ok?<eos> And other days, it controls you.<eos> And it is always hungry.<eos> It feeds on lust, on longing.
And other days, it controls you.<eos> And it is always hungry.<eos> It feeds on lust, on longing.<eos> And while you may slumber, the demon never sleeps.<eos> It tempts you into crossing every line you've ever drawn...
And it is always hungry.<eos> It feeds on lust, on longing.<eos> And while you may slumber, the demon never sleeps.<eos> It tempts you into crossing every line you've ever drawn...<eos> All while it hunts you... Haunts you... Renders you incapable of telling friend from foe...
It feeds on lust, on longing.<eos> And while you may slumber, the demon never sleeps.<eos> It tempts you into crossing every line you've ever drawn...<eos> All while it hunts you... Haunts you... Renders you incapable of telling friend from foe...<eos> But once it has turned your loved ones into enemies, the demon will have consumed you whole.
Well, come on then. Let's get you back in your proper body, though I'll likely have to torture Freya and Esther to do so, which actually might be quite fun.<eos> No, Nik.<eos> I'm staying put.<eos> Eva's gone for good, but her body, this body is still linked to Davina and those children.<eos> I can feel it, and if I leave it, then it dies, and Davina and the others die with it.
Previously on "The Originals"...<eos> We take hope and the pack, and we leave town tonight.<eos> This body is still linked to Davina and those children.<eos> If I leave it and it dies, then Davina and the others die with it.
Looks like a VIP area.<eos> Probably where they're holding Tatsu.<eos> There's a lot of muscle in front of that door.<eos> This club is a Triad front.<eos> It will be heavily guarded.
This club is a Triad front.<eos> It will be heavily guarded.<eos> But will you do anything to get her back?<eos> Yes, I would.<eos> I told you it would be heavily guarded.
I'll be careful.<eos> I love you, sweetheart.<eos> I love you, too, daddy.<eos> One of the aldermen has a pacemaker.<eos> If it's remote programmable...
I'm not afraid of this man and you shouldn't be, either.<eos> He should be afraid of us.<eos> Then we'll stay.<eos> Your helicopter is back on the roof.<eos> I didn't crash it. Turns out... It actually had keys.
Clearly it comes from your mother's side of the family.<eos> It's pretty amazing how much Malcolm taught you in such a short time.<eos> Yeah.<eos> He's father of the year.<eos> Your fighting style, it-- it reminds me a bit of Sara.
Did I mumble?<eos> We follow his lead.<eos> For now.<eos> Guys? I set up a proximity alarm to detect any unauthorized entry to this level.<eos> It's going off like crazy.
I'm scrubbing footage from surveillance cameras at the remaining three locations.<eos> Don't move.<eos> - Nice threads. - Thanks.<eos> Felicity, the briefcase is empty.<eos> It's empty-
- Hey. Well, the breakage indicates that the door somehow Had zero viscoelasticity when it hit the ground.<eos> - What does that mean to normal people?<eos> - Sorry.<eos> Uh... The steel shattered like glass.<eos> It was frozen, joe.
Two of the four victims in critical condition just died.<eos> Crime Scene processed the scene.<eos> There's no physical evidence suggesting the ride was tampered with.<eos> Witnesses didn't notice anyone at or near the computer room.<eos> Doesn't mean it wasn't hacked.
I hate to burst your hacker gossip bubble, Nelson, but this computer was not remotely hacked.<eos> You sound certain.<eos> 'Cause I am.<eos> It's physically impossible for this computer to connect to the Internet.<eos> It's been completely air-gapped.
You sound certain.<eos> 'Cause I am.<eos> It's physically impossible for this computer to connect to the Internet.<eos> It's been completely air-gapped.<eos> The park made sure it didn't have Bluetooth or Wi-Fi so no one could hack in.
Wait, wait, wait, what about the no-food policy?<eos> Oh, that's for everyone else.<eos> Okay, so I always order a Large and Tasty from the sub shop around the corner with bacon, but the Large and Tasty doesn't come with bacon.<eos> Something you'd only know if you're familiar with the menu.<eos> The bacon is disguised because it looks like part of the sandwich.
[ scoffs ] the entire time?<eos> You never slipped up once?<eos> You never thought maybe somebody you knew saw you?<eos> Only thing I can think of is one night, I felt like a car was following us.<eos> It pulled into the motel behind us And was still there when we came out.
It pulled into the motel behind us And was still there when we came out.<eos> Danni thought I was being paranoid.<eos> Did you get a plate number?<eos> Nope. Make, model?<eos> It was a little red, maybe burgundy, economy car.
After Iris took off her bracelet, it was like something happened.<eos> Iris told me her parents made her wear this.<eos> The bracelet is made of Adamantine.<eos> We don't need your help.<eos> If the bracelet's made of the same material as the box, maybe it can contain her, too.
Bo, your hand.<eos> Nyx is gone.<eos> The bracelet worked.<eos> No.<eos> It didn't.
Harlan.<eos> I'm so sorry to keep you waiting.<eos> Please, don't get up.<eos> How's your lobster?<eos> It tastes like it was caught this morning.
I'm so sorry to keep you waiting.<eos> Please, don't get up.<eos> How's your lobster?<eos> It tastes like it was caught this morning.<eos> Well, it was.
An insect lacks morality to agonise over.<eos> Will agonises about inevitable change.<eos> Almost anything can be trained to resist its instinct.<eos> A shepherd dog doesn't savage the sheep.<eos> But it wants to.
We just lost the signal.<eos> Richard Davis must be on to us.<eos> We need to find a way to track him.<eos> Nelson, find a cell catcher.<eos> It'll grab any cell signal in a one-mile radius.
He deserves the truth.<eos> At this time next week, I'll have an actual office in the back.<eos> Are you here for your paycheck? Yeah.<eos> Great.<eos> I think it's over by the register.
I think you are.<eos> Why else would you have given such credence to Elizabeth Barton?<eos> Because when she speaks, she is inspired.<eos> With my own eyes I have seen a golden letter sent by Mary Magdalene... Mary Magdalene, yes.<eos> Actually it was written by Father Bocking.
What are you doing, Frank?<eos> Taking off soon.<eos> And I'm signing the place over to you.<eos> All the way.<eos> It's yours.
Stronger.<eos> It gives you something most people don't have.<eos> Bad as this is, wrong as it is, this hurt...<eos> That's what pain does.<eos> It shows you what was on the inside.
I can not figure out why.<eos> Now, I think I understand why.<eos> I do not know where you sleep. You'll sleep here.<eos> While it's too late, slay the dragon!<eos> It already reaches for a handheld you.
Now, I think I understand why.<eos> I do not know where you sleep. You'll sleep here.<eos> While it's too late, slay the dragon!<eos> It already reaches for a handheld you.<eos> Already it reached to you!
Why Igor does not come to you?<eos> If it does not come, then ... You know what that means. - You are whether oath!<eos> Unable Armand.<eos> The dragon came before.<eos> So, it will not come to you.
Not that different.<eos> We were supposed to sit down together at your house in Baltimore. Just the three of us.<eos> You were to be the guest of honour.<eos> But the menu was all wrong.<eos> Yes, it was.
The teacup's broken.<eos> It's never going to gather itself back together again.<eos> Not even in your mind?<eos> Your memory palace is building.<eos> It's... full of new things.
It's never going to gather itself back together again.<eos> Not even in your mind?<eos> Your memory palace is building.<eos> It's... full of new things.<eos> It shares some rooms with my own.
I was just... on my way to see you.<eos> Really?<eos> Whatever for? I wanted to celebrate your deliverance.<eos> Perhaps then you'll drink a cup of Dionysian wine with me to clear the air.<eos> It's from my most celebrated vine.
Profits will be divided up equally among us.<eos> Four shares, instead of five.<eos> Leland?<eos> What, I'm going against the three of you?<eos> I like my head where it's at.
They'll handle the logistics.<eos> Any questions?<eos> Yes. Why not do it at night, when the street's empty?<eos> The answer's easy.<eos> For a country to break with Turkey, it must be very scared.
You're all responsible.<eos> His feet were on the ground. He could have stood up, saved himself.<eos> No second thoughts.<eos> He's been waiting for this day for 20 years.<eos> And it finally came.
Her past doesn't matter.<eos> People come to New York and start new lives, and it gets complicated.<eos> And you, of all people, don't get to judge her.<eos> Your greatest accomplishment in life is pulling off that lipstick, which you have to let me borrow.<eos> It looks awesome.
I will discover who was responsible for this, Sire.<eos> I swear it.<eos> The King is dying! The King has been poisoned!<eos> - I'll stay, find out what's happened.<eos> - This is Rochefort's plan. Whatever it is, it is well advanced.
The investigation is ongoing, although we did not find a body.<eos> The amount of blood in the house would indicate that the victim's wounds were fatal.<eos> Mona Vanderwaal was murdered.<eos> They know that thing's empty, right?<eos> It's a casket and it still weighs a ton.
I'm sure a lot of exciting things happened in your life.<eos> - Will you talk about it?<eos> I have a letter from the man you saved.<eos> You have to read it.<eos> - It's really touching.
I thought of you often while he is fighting for this.<eos> It's amazing what you've accomplished.<eos> I wonder why fights now, with whom you live and what you do.<eos> Now I live in the south and I have a farm.<eos> I am small, but it's mine.
If I still got recognized on the street, which I don't.<eos> Mostly at book signings, which I don't recommend if you write your book.<eos> I didn't ask you here to discuss my book. - No?<eos> - I want to discuss yours.<eos> I'm working on a piece, and it won't go to print unless I get a comment from the White House.
I'm gonna be up three straight days once this hurricane hits.<eos> I need to get all the sleep I can.<eos> That's a good idea.<eos> I'll leave you be.<eos> Have one of the stewards wake me when it hits the coast.
I'll leave you be.<eos> Have one of the stewards wake me when it hits the coast.<eos> Francis.<eos> Francis?<eos> Where did it make landfall?
Francis?<eos> Where did it make landfall?<eos> - It didn't. - What?<eos> The hurricane turned.<eos> It's due east now.
Where did it make landfall?<eos> - It didn't. - What?<eos> The hurricane turned.<eos> It's due east now.<eos> It might hit Bermuda.
- It didn't. - What?<eos> The hurricane turned.<eos> It's due east now.<eos> It might hit Bermuda.<eos> But it'll, uh, dissipate quickly now that it's reaching colder water.
Found only in his trash.<eos> He claims it isn't his.<eos> And there seems to be some question about whether your initial search was wholly legal.<eos> Maybe somebody didn't wait for the, uh, warrant to be issued?<eos> So, what, we should have just left the scene so the old lady could burn it while we went to a judge?
Go, Belle. Find Angelina.<eos> Go on, find her!<eos> She loses the scent in the smoke.<eos> My compass got soaked.<eos> It's busted.
Just make the bomb think it already exploded.<eos> I can't even alter one character on a single line of code.<eos> I have never seen anything this sophisticated. So we're back to a manhunt again.<eos> Hey, Krummy, take a look at this code.<eos> It was just added four hours ago. When the target adjusted the trigger threshold down to 750K.
You got a better idea, Nelson?<eos> Actually, I do.<eos> I saw an exploit on Tobin's site.<eos> It's a piece of malware that turns off cell phone ringers.<eos> He's gonna need to update that code, adjust it to the tablet.
You're not that smart.<eos> You're a step above script kiddie.<eos> Hey, I was, uh, gonna try and help you guys out, but if you're gonna insult my skills...<eos> It's incredibly sophisticated code.<eos> It highlights a big flaw in Public Electric printers.
No, Michelle is not going anywhere.<eos> Maybe not.<eos> But Devon is.<eos> So this office printer wasn't on the same network as the other printers? No, it was.<eos> Then why didn't it burn?
Maybe not.<eos> But Devon is.<eos> So this office printer wasn't on the same network as the other printers? No, it was.<eos> Then why didn't it burn?<eos> Was it offline or unplugged?
Besides, my taste buds are as half-dead as the rest of me.<eos> Dr. C, I hear you got a John Doe for me.<eos> He's right over here, Detective.<eos> Yeah, I'll never how you can eat down here.<eos> That's why I leave my coffee at the bottom step, so it doesn't get that morgue-y smell.
First, you have to look the part.<eos> Come on.<eos> Golden got something on that "Chubb182" username.<eos> Guy's name is Larry Gerald.<eos> It's linked to a "Show Us Your Powers" account.
Look.<eos> These... things... connecting all the cocoons and they're all coming from up there.<eos> Julia, I'm scared!<eos> This cocoon, it's... different.<eos> It's larger.
It was at that dive bar in Marrakech.<eos> Your tall friend kept buying me drinks, but all I could look at was you.<eos> His name?<eos> What was his name?<eos> I think it was James?
I imagine well, knowing how well you always have done in school.<eos> Now, last I remember, you were interviewing for some associate's jobs,<eos> - which I think is... - I'm not giving the ring back.<eos> Aiden gave it to me with a promise to spend the rest of our lives together.<eos> This technically means it was not an engagement ring, and according to the Pennsylvania supreme court case
- We need to change our look.<eos> - Cheer up.<eos> What's wrong with you?<eos> This hat is so cool!<eos> Do you like it?
Okay, I'm done. Bye, ladies and gentlemen! See you never!<eos> Shit!<eos> Lose something?<eos> You know what I love about good apple pie?<eos> It's not too sweet.
I'll write you another check.<eos> I know, right?<eos> The high life.<eos> And this is nothing.<eos> Well, a golden cage might be gold but it's still a cage.
The Santa Muerte were dead.<eos> You truly have a devil inside.<eos> I'm just trying to keep it inside this prison.<eos> As long as I'm in here, I can't cast it out.<eos> All it has to do is watch the clock go down.
At least try.<eos> Bloody John Constantine.<eos> Center of attention again.<eos> This demon will try to use our weaknesses against us.<eos> If it emerges, don't listen to it.
Right now I'm more worried about April's heart than mine.<eos> Did you get a plate from the hospital camera?<eos> Yes, okay.<eos> The getaway car is a rental near 102 and Lex.<eos> - It was just returned.
Not many snipers can make hits from that distance with that kind of accuracy.<eos> That should narrow it down, right?<eos> I wish. Truth is, the shooter could have been anybody.<eos> Now, these Bittakers, they can choose any number of their contacts to call in a hit.<eos> Shooter could be any nationality, he could be any age -- Nah, it's a regional guy.
He wanted to be transferred to Arkham.<eos> BULLOCK:<eos> It's really good work, Ed.<eos> What's this Batinski's deal?<eos> It's Buchinsky.
We'll get him.<eos> - We got 17 hours to do so.<eos> - I love the name.<eos> It's catchy.<eos> It has drama. The electrocutioner.
No, don't be angry, no.<eos> Such good news.<eos> My boy has a club.<eos> Will have a club.<eos> There's still a few loose ends to tie up, but soon, it will be mine.
- Yes.<eos> I've been suspended and won't be seeing you anymore.<eos> So I wanted to return this pencil.<eos> I took it from your office some time ago. I kept meaning to return it.<eos> It used to be longer.
And without control, Maroni killing you is no longer a hypothetical... it's a foregone conclusion.<eos> That's why I wanna reopen it.<eos> Under your care.<eos> I can have the club?<eos> - It's mine?
Your days of sneaking around spying on Maroni are over.<eos> You're with me now.<eos> Publicly.<eos> Things are gonna be much different.<eos> So spruce up the place. Get it open.
You make her come home... leave this baboon... then I'll consider your offer.<eos> Madam... she'll be home for Sunday Mass.<eos> You have my word.<eos> This place is a dump. Real nickel-and-dime.<eos> It's worth far more than that, Gabe.
And the rest?<eos> The charity ball?<eos> Presumably to have access to Mr. Bunderslaw.<eos> Selina stole the key to his office safe.<eos> I went there today. It was empty.
I thought the readings were a mistake, that I put the thing together wrong.<eos> Been struggling to, uh, um...<eos> Something's wrong with the data in my head.<eos> What are you saying?<eos> So, I was thinking how the heart monitor seemed to shatter from the inside out, but it was still on your wrist when we found you --
It's Bobbi. She set off some kind of E.M.P.<eos> She's gone.<eos> Mack, too.<eos> He embedded a scanner into little Lola's engine.<eos> It was programmed to find anything with vibranium.
You've got to be kidding me.<eos> Can you hear it?<eos> No, not the stone.<eos> The mountain.<eos> It's the loudest thing here.
Right.<eos> Because I didn't think of that.<eos> At least your sarcasm still works.<eos> They disabled the arm.<eos> It's dead.
It will be easier if we're together.<eos> Go.<eos> Find it.<eos> This is it.<eos> It's here.
Did you know that she was inhuman?<eos> They both were.<eos> So you, of all people, should understand why they'd want to keep their location a secret... what they're so afraid of.<eos> Cargo hold's secure.<eos> Or as secure as it can be with a teleporter in the mix.
You finish indexing Lincoln?<eos> Yes.<eos> But, um, I actually went to get... well, I ...<eos> I thought you might like this.<eos> Snagged it off the bus before it went down.
I've learned that more painfully than most.<eos> And now I've come to accept it.<eos> It is not for me to lead, but to illuminate.<eos> I've seen the future... and your plan.<eos> Does it succeed?
SHIELD? - No.<eos> Their way is what got us here.<eos> - You started this war.<eos> This war started decades ago, when SHIELD was founded to guard the world against people like us.<eos> And it will never end.
She said she would hide me, but she lied.<eos> She was gonna give me to the cops.<eos> Do you trust me?<eos> Did you kill Bug?<eos> This place, no one knows where it is.
It's funny.<eos> A lot of stuff gets stolen from Howard Stark...<eos> Cars, bombs, death rays.<eos> Actually, the death ray's accounted for.<eos> It's in Nevada, I believe.
Mrs. Vistain, um, your husband...<eos> - Was that your first marriage?<eos> - Arthur?<eos> Lord, no, he was my third.<eos> Kept his name, thought it sounded like royalty.
No... but it might knock him off balance.<eos> Get him mad, maybe enough to make a mistake big enough to matter.<eos> I got something I'm working on, might help push that bald prick over the edge.<eos> No, I want you to keep your head down, until this is over.<eos> My head's fine where it's at.
Excellent!<eos> And about time, if you don't mind me saying.<eos> Now...<eos> Where's my ring?<eos> It's gone.
Our royal custom depends on shielding heirs to the throne from the outside world.<eos> I had all the toys and trinkets I could want...<eos> And daily lessons from my strict tutors, but... almost nothing else.<eos> One day, when I was eight, this stone was thrown through my window.<eos> It broke the cup on my bedside.
Yes, but...<eos> Oracle... can I kiss you?<eos> No.<eos> No?<eos> If the kiss doesn't mean what it should, then it won't work.
No.<eos> No?<eos> If the kiss doesn't mean what it should, then it won't work.<eos> Why?<eos> What should it mean?
No... This must have something to do with the ring.<eos> May I take another look at it?<eos> "The Tone."<eos> That's why Hermes called it "the Tone..."<eos> It makes a noise... which, in our world is harmless, but here in this speed of time, oh, we must be very careful with this.
It makes a noise... which, in our world is harmless, but here in this speed of time, oh, we must be very careful with this.<eos> Unless...<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> The noise it made shook this great temple.<eos> It moved so fast, the vibrations of noise caused the earth to, well... move.
- It was barely a rumble.<eos> - Were you in Sylmar in 1971? !<eos> Because I was! I saw a little boy crushed by a tree.<eos> - You did?<eos> - Well, it was a lawn jockey, but it looked like a little boy.
Previously on 12 Monkeys...<eos> - The core is dead.<eos> - It can't be repaired.
Contrary to what you may've heard, Colonel Foster did not find a cure to the plague.<eos> This is the 2033 mutation of the virus... a second iteration of the original plague.<eos> Foster's basing his research on the first mutation, not the current one.<eos> But the virus has mutated twice more since 2033.<eos> Now it is an entirely unique microorganism... something quite alien... something we'll probably never fully understand.
Now it is an entirely unique microorganism... something quite alien... something we'll probably never fully understand.<eos> His vaccine won't work.<eos> Foster lied.<eos> Why?<eos> Because it gives his people hope... just as it gave you.
Let me show you.<eos> What the hell is that thing?<eos> That is our salvation.<eos> The virus is not yet done with us, Mr. Cole.<eos> It will mutate again and again until not even the immune are left standing.
Follow me.<eos> Took us years to assemble with every still-functioning server, processor, and hard drive within 500 miles.<eos> We created a massive network with a single function.<eos> To find a cure for the plague.<eos> You can't cure this thing. Not the way it mutates.
Safe, it's clean, it's organized.<eos> They said they found a cure for the plague.<eos> There is no way to predict the mutations.<eos> Foster's got a room full of computers, that's why they need their core.<eos> They say that they're able to predict when the virus is gonna change. And that they're also able to create a cure every time it mutates.
Fake being a psychic.<eos> I've got a lot of balls in the air.<eos> Yet here I am, getting ready for a date.<eos> The last time I sweated an outfit choice was the night Major proposed.<eos> Of course, I did it the five nights leading up to the proposal, because I was sure it was coming.
It seems the venom deformed the baby.<eos> Better for you not to see that.<eos> It's my fault, I tried to abort...<eos> We'll plant this tree on the grave.<eos> It will grow, become tall and strong thanks to the baby's breath.
We should get rid of her now.<eos> No. I told you, the Witness has spoken.<eos> She's too important.<eos> That van's been off the grid since 2011.<eos> Before then, it was licensed for refrigeration at a dozen companies.
No. I told you, the Witness has spoken.<eos> She's too important.<eos> That van's been off the grid since 2011.<eos> Before then, it was licensed for refrigeration at a dozen companies.<eos> It's been used as a mortuary van, landscaping, transport, even a goddamn ice-cream truck.
I'm glad I got to know you.<eos> Viral strain M510 was derived from remains discovered during a private core sampling expedition in the Himalayas, mid 1980s.<eos> Now, from the preserved tissue, we extracted a previously unknown pathogen which we genetically modified at Markridge into this weapon, which we will be deploying in Chechnya for Operation Troy.<eos> If released in this room, this virus would kill every one of us in two to three hours.<eos> Leland said it would be controllable.
- The monkeys are here. They're after me.<eos> I beat 'em to the virus.<eos> Cole, whatever you do, do not open that case.<eos> I know that. I need to know how to destroy it.<eos> It has to be in here somewhere.
Dr. Peters, you know Dr. Railly?<eos> - We've crossed paths.<eos> - What do you have to say about this?<eos> This virus is the deadliest ever created.<eos> If there's the slightest possibility of it falling into the wrong hands,
You look too young for that.<eos> That is what they tell me.<eos> Are you gonna watch the accelerator turn on tonight?<eos> I wouldn't miss it.<eos> They say it's going to change the world.
I haven't been in this house since that night.<eos> Bar?<eos> This mirror--you remember it?<eos> Yeah.<eos> It belonged to my grandma.
Bar?<eos> This mirror--you remember it?<eos> Yeah.<eos> It belonged to my grandma.<eos> How is it still here?
But there is no normal life for us.<eos> You will always risk your life to try and help people, and I will always be the guy that runs into that pipeline for you.<eos> The quantum splicer.<eos> It was used to separate you once.<eos> Maybe it could be of use to keep you you.
You don't look so bad yourself.<eos> Am I being pranked right now?<eos> What do you think?<eos> I can't believe this.<eos> The day started out pretty terrible but it's turning out pretty damn good.
Here's hoping.<eos> So, what's next?<eos> In your last letter, you said you had something big in mind.<eos> I've had 20 years to come up with the perfect trick.<eos> It's going to be... my masterpiece.
Charging in three, two, one.<eos> Barry.<eos> Joe.<eos> That is it for the defibrillator.<eos> It is completely fried.
We're gonna save both of them, Iris.<eos> - I promise you.<eos> - Hold up.<eos> I put a tracker in the tranq dart you shot Grodd with.<eos> - As soon as it activates... - No, Cisco.
There's water!<eos> That's right.<eos> You were on a boat.<eos> A refugee boat.<eos> It was sunk by terrorists.
She's amazing.<eos> But when she practices that thing, it is painful, right?<eos> Why not piano?<eos> I mean, it's the same price, you know? And doesn't sound so bad.<eos> At least, if you can't play that proper, it sounds... 2571.
- Ugh! I'll take you.<eos> I'll just drive you.<eos> No, no! Listen, cockbrain, you've gotta get your shit together.<eos> Your car is blazing hot.<eos> - You gotta stash it somewhere.
What the hell are you doing here?<eos> Well, Ed and Steph asked me to.<eos> Chris, don't trust him.<eos> Steph, what the hell's going on?<eos> Chris, if he takes the money, we'll never see a penny of it.
What are you doing?<eos> What the fuck are you doing?<eos> What are you.?<eos> Let me see it. You think I care about the money?<eos> It's all federally insured anyway.
- Yes.<eos> Now, if you were to play, it would mean only what you wanted it to mean.<eos> Play for me, Jakob.<eos> Perhaps I was wrong earlier when I spoke about your mother.<eos> Perhaps your silence wouldn't horrify her as it does me.
ALL: (CHANTING) King Vortigern!<eos> King Vortigern!<eos> King Vortigern!<eos> I understand that your actions were very noble, of defending this whore's honor.<eos> How unfortunate it was at the expense of my Viking guests.
It seems as though you found a way to use the sword.<eos> ARTHUR:<eos> I wasn't controlling it.<eos> Here.<eos> It was controlling me.
I don't have to remind you of what will happen if he doesn't come.<eos> I'll start with the little boy.<eos> Now, take the girl and go.<eos> This venom will induce that which is hidden from you.<eos> It will show you things you do not want to see.
Fire!<eos> Target locked!<eos> We broke through the defensive aura.<eos> Secondary engines severely damaged.<eos> It's adrift.
And I'm telling you, Commander, that order is wrong.<eos> I will bring that ship and its captain in.<eos> You will stand down!<eos> Its engines are coming back on line!<eos> It's breaking away, sir.
A demonstration is required.<eos> It is difficult to kill that which does not truly live.<eos> My construct is not powered by science.<eos> It's powered by the mind.<eos> Alive because I will it into existence!
We will intercept them on the ground.<eos> They cannot leave here alive!<eos> Some type of central control system linked directly to the recipient's brain.<eos> Barbaric.<eos> Was it actually alive?
I mean...<eos> - Hey, Smurfette.<eos> - Hey.<eos> That thing's safe, right?<eos> Is it safe?
- Ready, Hefty?<eos> - Roger that.<eos> It works!<eos> This thing really gets me.<eos> It's able to hone in on Hefty's dominant trait.
Hey, everybody?<eos> My light is going out.<eos> That is it!<eos> I'm punching us out of here.<eos> It's collapsing.
That's not a great idea.<eos> Flying's not really my thing.<eos> Have you ever flown before?<eos> Well, no.<eos> Well, then how do you know it's not your thing?
And every two months you're getting a gig for 40 bucks at some dive?<eos> You don't want that.<eos> I don't even like this thing.<eos> No!<eos> And it doesn't like you, either.
Bye, guys.<eos> You know, at some point, I'm gonna have to start walking home on my own.<eos> I'm 14.<eos> Not on my watch, lovie.<eos> This neighborhood is not the same as it was 40 years ago.
I'm 14.<eos> Not on my watch, lovie.<eos> This neighborhood is not the same as it was 40 years ago.<eos> Right.<eos> It's safer and more gentrified.
I should shave it off at the first opportunity.<eos> I like you with a little scruff.<eos> I'll take that into consideration.<eos> - The united nations<eos> - Relief agency has pledged aid to the region, but the money's been held up over fears that it simply won't reach those in need.
Listen...<eos> You want to give all this money to children?<eos> Th-they are so little. Maybe they don't eat so much.<eos> Your money. You're the boss.<eos> Just make sure the money gets where it needs to go.
But what?<eos> You know, we fucking had it, sergeant.<eos> The people were with us.<eos> The water was gonna flow.<eos> It wasn't ours to have, ocre.
Yes.<eos> Did he choose your dress?<eos> No.<eos> - You like it?<eos> - It's very nice.
We got the money.<eos> - What?<eos> - How much?<eos> The money.<eos> What do you call it?
Where's Papa?<eos> Take me to him!<eos> Look, Cogsworth.<eos> A beautiful girl!<eos> Yes! I can see it's a girl.
Another little gift from the enchantress.<eos> A book that truly allows you to escape.<eos> How amazing!<eos> It was her cruelest trick of all.<eos> It was just another curse.
Hello.<eos> - I like your tat.<eos> - Oh. I saw it on the back of a truck once.<eos> I thought it was cuckoo.<eos> It is... cuckoo.
-Do not get too excited about it.<eos> What have you found?<eos> From the beginning, nothing has been a coincidence.<eos> The ship was never in real danger.<eos> It was purposely put close to Titan's atmosphere shortly before we arrived.
We just had rain last night.<eos> We got three houseguests and a sink full of dishes.<eos> All right, all right.<eos> The pump station that supplies us is a mile and a half from here.<eos> Sometimes it gets itself shut off.
I hold nothing against Musa.<eos> And we don't kill.<eos> Listen up lf l wanted to take orders, I wouldn't have set out to start a business.<eos> Take the money and scoot. Move it.<eos> Musa sent it for you.
- He might understand... - Cut the crap!<eos> No need to use your brains I don't need anyone's advice!<eos> Go on, get back to work. Go!<eos> What good is yelling? Will it get our money back?<eos> Or, will it help build the colony?
To kill a mockingbird.<eos> I just didn't think that I would need it.<eos> Well I'm sure that there's an English copy of it somewhere.<eos> No, I don't want a copy. I want my copy.<eos> It wasn't a journal, it was I guess more of a log.
This is that water.<eos> When the ice melts, it cuts through the base and it creates this river.<eos> The glacier slides a little further, it refreezes, it...<eos> It's just this constant cycle.<eos> Life is resetting, it's reinventing.
When the ice melts, it cuts through the base and it creates this river.<eos> The glacier slides a little further, it refreezes, it...<eos> It's just this constant cycle.<eos> Life is resetting, it's reinventing.<eos> Jenai, it's trying.
You heard of the USS Lawton?<eos> Neither did the public.<eos> Out of a thousand young men on that ship, I was the only survivor.<eos> They told my family she was sunk in battle, but I know what I saw.<eos> It had no conscience.
Yes.<eos> Whatever you tell us, stays in this room. I think I speak for everyone.<eos> Well, what is the worst thing you could do?<eos> Tell them your darkest secret.<eos> Because, if you tell them, and they decide they rather not know... You can't take it back. You can't unsay it.
Two of you work for me. And one of you of course, is my lovely daughter. Faith.<eos> You are the people I need to hear me.<eos> I have made millions, for myself for the people around this table, for millions of people I've never even met.<eos> There are charities that I support who wouldn't exist without me.<eos> If life is a balance sheet, and I think it is, well, I believe I'm in credit!
Not any more, though.<eos> There's a pin prick at the top of the paper.<eos> The past few months, it's been on open display on a wall.<eos> Conclusion? Relationship is over.<eos> The paper has been exposed to steam and a variety of cooking smells. So, it must have been on display in the kitchen.
By instinct, we place them at eye level, where there's natural light.<eos> The sun's only struck the bottom two-thirds, but the line is straight.<eos> But, because the top section is unaffected, we know the sunlight can only be entering the room at a steep angle.<eos> If the sunlight was able to penetrate the room when the sun was lower in the sky, then the paper would be equally faded.<eos> Top to bottom, but no. It only makes it when the sun is at its zenith. So, I'm betting that you live in a narrow street, on the ground floor.
Stop laughing at me!<eos> Sherlock!<eos> Stop it! Stop it now!<eos> Is it true he's been treated in your hospital?<eos> It's not actually my hospital.
No one made her do it, no one could ever make her do anything.<eos> But the point is, you did not kill her.<eos> In saving my life she conferred a value on it.<eos> It is a currency I do not know how to spend.<eos> It is what it is.
The motion sensor is activated.<eos> If any of us move, the grenade will detonate.<eos> It'll certainly destroy this flat and kill anyone in it.<eos> Assuming walls of reasonable strength, your neighbours should be safe, but as it's landed on the floor, I am moved to wonder if the cafe below is open.<eos> It's Sunday morning, - so it's closed.
People leave their bodies to science. I think cannibals would be so much more grateful.<eos> Oh, isn't that sweet?<eos> Maybe you should sit down.<eos> I wrote my own version of the Nativity when I was a child. The Hungry Donkey.<eos> It was a bit gory.
Not in the face, though.<eos> Please. I promised my brain to the Royal Society.<eos> Where would you suggest?<eos> Well, I suppose there is a heart somewhere inside me.<eos> I don't imagine it's much of a target, but why don't we try for that?
Yes, the baby's fine.<eos> Who was that?<eos> That was me!<eos> The baby's fine.<eos> It won't budge!
Where are you taking me?<eos> Come on, come on.<eos> Look. Look!<eos> Oh, it's beautiful!<eos> I was afraid it wouldn't take to the soil... but it rooted quickly.
Come on, come on.<eos> Look. Look!<eos> Oh, it's beautiful!<eos> I was afraid it wouldn't take to the soil... but it rooted quickly.<eos> And soon, it'll be everywhere.
Not if you do it like that.<eos> Oh... I was raised alone on Ego's planet.<eos> I do not understand the intricacies of social interaction.<eos> Can I pet your puppy?<eos> It is adorable.
Concentrate.<eos> You can do it.<eos> Bring it back.<eos> Yes!<eos> Yes, now shape it.
But leave the eye here.<eos> Why?<eos> He's gonna wake up tomorrow... and he's not gonna know... where his eye is!<eos> That's a desk.<eos> We told you it was this big.
"Raccoon." Whatever.<eos> How do we kill a Celestial?<eos> There's a center to him.<eos> His brain, his soul, whatever it is... Some sort of protective shell.<eos> It's in the caverns... below the surface.
I think I packed a small detonator.<eos> A detonator is worthless without explosives.<eos> Well, we got these.<eos> Is that thing strong enough to kill Ego?<eos> If it is, it'll cause a chain reaction... throughout his entire nervous system.
It's pretty simple, all right?<eos> 15 minutes, tops.<eos> Okay, the starter.<eos> Let's try the brakes.<eos> It doesn't have brakes.
It's one of four ambulances.<eos> Come on!<eos> You found Waldo.<eos> I'm Gardner.<eos> This fire, it's so warm.
Look at this.<eos> I've never seen anything like it before.<eos> Oh, my God, what is that?<eos> His heart is grossly enlarged.<eos> I gave him some valsartan, but... It doesn't look good.
Anyway, um, I'm getting off track. Um...<eos> Since I couldn't spend any money on Mars, and I was up there for six years, it turns out I actually have a lot of it.<eos> So, I bought a ranch house in Boulder, Colorado.<eos> Mmm. I like to ski and the people are really nice.<eos> Yeah, it's a pretty big house.
Isn't this Lucy's beloved fearless pig rider?<eos> She is.<eos> And that's our best super pig.<eos> Well, what's the hiccup?<eos> Why is it still alive?
At an estimated triple profit...<eos> Hitting the market in two weeks...<eos> With a revolutionary, synthesized opiate offering security and versatility.<eos> Pills, patch, powder, drops.<eos> It's 100% pure... 100% of the time.
Have you been talking to Danny?<eos> No.<eos> Then what are you trying to say?<eos> You wanna know the truth about that meeting?<eos> It was brutal.
- This is crazy.<eos> - It's not crazy.<eos> People die from this.<eos> If this synthetic heroin gets on the streets, it'll affect your students.<eos> It'll be on their streets, and everything you've done for them will have been for nothing.
Man...<eos> I was there a long time.<eos> They aren't all great memories.<eos> How about how you got that tattoo?<eos> Well... it's not exactly a tattoo.

Do you want the money or not?<eos> There is no money.<eos> Of course there is.<eos> The offer doesn't expire for another two days.<eos> Oh, it didn't expire.
There is no money.<eos> Of course there is.<eos> The offer doesn't expire for another two days.<eos> Oh, it didn't expire.<eos> It was rejected.
Of course there is.<eos> The offer doesn't expire for another two days.<eos> Oh, it didn't expire.<eos> It was rejected.<eos> The hell it was.
- Already?<eos> This isn't mine.<eos> This is a set up. Someone set me up!<eos> You cannot search my car without cause.<eos> It was on the seat.
- I'm worried about him.<eos> - Ward has a problem, Joy.<eos> You know that, don't you?<eos> Yeah, Dad, I know. I know he has a problem.<eos> I've talked to him about it, and it hasn't helped.
Come out of the darkness so I can see you.<eos> The battle is won.<eos> Harold.<eos> I've wasted too many years hating whatever it is you are.<eos> You're going to prison. it's gonna be nowhere near as nice as the one you spent the last 13 years in.
It's gotta be a significant number for your grandfather.<eos> Do you know his birthday?<eos> It's may 21st...<eos> But I don't know the year.<eos> What was it?
I'm gonna get started.<eos> Hello, everyone, my name is Jane Young, and I'm the director of the science museum.<eos> First of all, I wanna thank you all so much for being here.<eos> As many of you know, there has been major cutbacks to our school systems, and that is one of the reasons, one of the reasons, why it is so important to keep a place like the science museum open.<eos> It is one of the last places that our children can come to learn, and be inspired, and have fun.
How are we doing?<eos> Good. Okay.<eos> I gotta say, this is pretty amazing.<eos> All this thanks to our first adventure.<eos> It took a while, but it was a doozy.
Let him in so he can help.<eos> - Even if that heart is damaged?<eos> - Especially if it's damaged.<eos> Matthew, I want to talk frankly.<eos> - Please. - This other life you led... is your heart still with it... or is your heart with the one who walked through it by your side?
- No, I just mean...<eos> I thought you already did that.<eos> - What do you mean?<eos> - The car.<eos> It's been there since last night.
- He's centering his anima.<eos> Mmm, sure.<eos> Uh, I'm not into that mystic stuff.<eos> It's not "mystic stuff."<eos> It's just a different way of viewing the world.
Uh, I'm not into that mystic stuff.<eos> It's not "mystic stuff."<eos> It's just a different way of viewing the world.<eos> - Quite different.<eos> It's about perspective.
- We still don't know.<eos> Where did they take Danny?<eos> Midland Circle makes the most sense.<eos> What from the architect?<eos> He was planning on blowing up the building. Collapsing it straight down into the hole.
I'm so sorry.<eos> It is not your fault.<eos> It's not.<eos> It's the job.<eos> Danny... uh, wanted to say that he has connections... at this hospital, and it's a... It's a state-of-the-art kind of place, so...
Because my fucking nephew, killed a dog.<eos> And he stole a car.<eos> A car... which currently is among our inventory.<eos> So we're giving everything up for a car?<eos> It's not just a car.
And he stole a car.<eos> A car... which currently is among our inventory.<eos> So we're giving everything up for a car?<eos> It's not just a car.<eos> It is John Wick's car.
Not just for me.<eos> For all of us.<eos> For everyone under the Table.<eos> Yes, killing someone who has a seat at the High Table does create a problem.<eos> But it's your problem, baby.
We breed them with that magnificent bucking stallion you've got in there.<eos> Full market value, then we set the colts free on my property.<eos> You win.<eos> What's your price?<eos> You say this prep program was a mistake, that it's hideous and wrong and that all horses should be free.
Now, I sense some nervousness in this room. 'Cause we've had a little bit of a public dispute, but, Stella, come on up here.<eos> We have managed to find some common ground.<eos> Thank you, Meredith. But I'm not taking your offer.<eos> 'Cause I know that the work we've done on my ranch is good. And the prep program, it's a link between man and animal.<eos> It rehabilitates the convicts and gets the horses healthy and ready for adoption.
You can't walk away from this Dom<eos> We're gonna have this conversation one way or the other<eos> See that's the funny thing about fate<eos> It's cunning<eos> It can bring you beautiful things and it can also bring you moments like this
- That's who I am<eos> - Is it?<eos> Let me ask you something Dom, what's the best thing in your life?<eos> - Family<eos> - No, it's not
Am I the only one seeing this?<eos> Oh, this oughtta be good<eos> Use God's eye.<eos> We put our lives on the line.. Running around the world trying to figure this thing out<eos> It can find anybody, right?
Wait a second, wait, wait.<eos> Simple solutions might just cut it<eos> In order for God's eyes to give up all this false pings, Means they have to be using a free relay<eos> Watch these two<eos> Which means it has a decaying sync quantanizer
That's a million dollar show car<eos> The point is to not draw attention<eos> It's reverse psychology<eos> Dom will never see it coming<eos> It's neon orange,
- How long?<eos> 60 seconds<eos> Alright, Dom, You've one pulse left in that EMP<eos> That sub is heavily insulated<eos> You're gonna need to be right underneath it, for this thing to work
In Leyman's terms... She just carjacked a submarine<eos> We can't let it get away.<eos> There's the control room<eos> If you can get me into that warehouse I can tap with network and counter hack Cipher<eos> Keep it from flowing into water
Boom, baby!<eos> That's alright!<eos> Back in the sink<eos> Where is that smile?<eos> There it is!
Roberta. - Oh my God!<eos> - My poor, poor baby.<eos> What a night you've had.<eos> Baby, I see your light.<eos> It's, like, blue.
- Dad, this is Kip.<eos> - It's a pleasure to meet you, sir.<eos> How do you do?<eos> I'm sorry about the misunderstanding.<eos> It's my fault.
- It's a pleasure to meet you, sir.<eos> How do you do?<eos> I'm sorry about the misunderstanding.<eos> It's my fault.<eos> That's very generous of you, but I'm pretty sure it's all my fault.
Hardly the action of a savage.<eos> Thank you, Mr. Thoyt, you may leave us.<eos> Mr. Pettifer, I hope the report from the Africa desk is as thorough as the one from Mr. Wilton in the records office.<eos> According to charter records, he went to Cabinda aboard a ship called Cornwallis, then boarded a ship called the Influence, bound for Antigua.<eos> It was a slave ship.

Toward the end, you said my father rarely ate.<eos> Aye, he lived on air and honey beer.<eos> From where?<eos> From a man in Feather Lane.<eos> Look, it was cheaper than the tavern and, er, your father only gave me coppers.
The Prince Regent has decided to decline your offer.<eos> - For crying out loud, Godders.<eos> - He will not offer you a monopoly.<eos> So... doesn't that mean the game is up, James?<eos> No, it's just begun.
I told him two shillings. I guessed you'd pay.<eos> Hold on.<eos> Nitrous oxide. They call it "laughing gas".<eos> I provide it for entertainment at society parties.<eos> It's good money.
Every year, July 10th.<eos> July 20th is the anniversary of the sinking...<eos> Of the sinking of the sloop The Influence.<eos> Not the ship's real name, of course.<eos> Its name was changed and papers altered when it took on human cargo in the port of Cabinda.
I thought the name of the ship in question was the Influence.<eos> Its real name is the Cornwallis.<eos> But in the port of Cabinda on the West African coast, its name was temporarily changed.<eos> But wh-wh-why...<eos> wh-why was its name changed? Because, on July the 5th, it was loaded with a cargo of slaves.
But these slaves were loaded by East India Company directors anyway.<eos> As part of a thriving illicit network.<eos> It was done for personal profit.<eos> The ship was officially registered as departing Cabinda empty.<eos> That is why it sailed with only a skeleton crew.
An actress... who enjoys walking with a man with human flesh in his teeth.<eos> You know, you can even buy a song about Delaney now. In Covent Garden, for a penny.<eos> I-I'll return when you're sober...<eos> It's about a cannibal who plans to eat the Prince Regent.<eos> So it can only be about Delaney.
Famously volatile.<eos> Given to explosive fits of rage.<eos> May he rest in peace until he's reignited with his Saviour.<eos> Slow, slow, slow over the potted roads.<eos> The chlorate is still there, it's just sleeping.
The gloves are off.<eos> the mouse for Wellington's cat!<eos> And know you this, I saw him there<eos> Standing on the deck<eos> It was the cursed Bonaparte! I threw a rope around...
Is that something you picked up in Africa, maybe?<eos> How many more are left?<eos> I gave your name to our friend.<eos> He said something about a piece of land up there in the Pacific.<eos> He said that you've been swaggering all around town with it in your hat like a... peacock feather.
Put your things in here.<eos> I'll let you spread them out how you like.<eos> Why is this my room?<eos> This was General Whelan's room.<eos> It's got a great bathroom here.
Karzai ain't that guy.<eos> You gotta understand, what we're trying to do here is like raising a child.<eos> And a child needs two parents.<eos> Two parents who love it and each other very much.<eos> That's what it needs, above all else.
I'm fine, Willy.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> And so Glen finally got his face time with the president.<eos> Getting fired probably wasn't the kind of face time he was after, but, well, I guess you could say it was kind of a page in the history books.
It is.<eos> I, uh... I own and... And manage the Bates Motel.<eos> It's... it's on the old highway before the bypass.<eos> I've driven by there.<eos> I love your house; it's amazing.
Gary, I can't.<eos> He couldn't be trusted to keep his mouth shut, so... I had Gary take him out, too.<eos> What happened to the money?<eos> We kept the gold in a storage locker.<eos> And when we went to collect... it was gone.
No, I...<eos> I am, but I'm also against not having sex after marriage.<eos> Give me a break.<eos> ♪ Sitting at My Casio keyboard ♪<eos> ♪ Thank God it's built To prerecord ♪
Let him go!<eos> Thank you for volunteering, Herr Argent.<eos> At least we found his cell.<eos> That means something.<eos> It's a relic.
He ate his brain.<eos> Scott was right.<eos> I was wrong.<eos> I'm sending you back.<eos> It wasn't his brain.
- Mm-hmm.<eos> Is it finished?<eos> Indeed.<eos> You can roll this painting up and put it in your carry-on.<eos> No matter where you take it in the world, it's worth 14.
- What am I doing?<eos> - What is this shit?<eos> No, no, no.<eos> This car doesn't have plates.<eos> No, because it's brand new.
- What is this shit?<eos> No, no, no.<eos> This car doesn't have plates.<eos> No, because it's brand new.<eos> Can you not see it's brand new?
Let's just figure out another way to move the money.<eos> And try to fly with cash?<eos> You kidding me?<eos> The painting's the best way to walk through customs with $14 million.<eos> - It's beautiful.
I'm Amy.<eos> You're moving into my house, though.<eos> So, no, I'm not your neighbor.<eos> This is my house.<eos> No, this was Karen and Rick's house, and now it's my house because I bought it.
End of discussion.<eos> Holt, whatever it is, I think it's intended for Julia alone.<eos> Look at me.<eos> I know you're upset that I watched it.<eos> But we can't let it be for nothing.
You knew her?<eos> Everyone knew Evelyn.<eos> She was kept under the church.<eos> I found a room.<eos> It was like a prison.
That's what we offer.<eos> That's what we represent.<eos> You feel you've been treated unfairly?<eos> I feel misrepresented in the media.<eos> Put a pillow over that feeling and bear down until it stops kicking.
So how was your drive in?<eos> It was fine. We actually hit a deer.<eos> What?<eos> Oh, no.<eos> Is it dead?
Yeah. That's horrible.<eos> Are you guys all right?<eos> Yeah. It just fruck us out.<eos> It did?<eos> Yeah. It came outta nowhere. We got it pretty good.
What?<eos> My exercise.<eos> I didn't mean to scare you.<eos> Yeah. Yeah.<eos> And did it work?
"With your natural gifts and our determination," "we could both be part of something greater."<eos> "Something perfect."<eos> "The Coagula procedure is a man-made miracle."<eos> "Our order has been developing it for many, many years,"<eos> "and it wasn't until recently it was perfected"
"Jeremy's wrangling method sounds way less pleasant."<eos> "I'm supposed to answer any outstanding questions," "concerns you may have so far."<eos> "Apparently, our common understanding of the process" "has a positive impact on the success rate of the procedure."<eos> "You could give a shit, right?<eos> "Let me just tell you what it is."
We have better equipment these days.<eos> My word! That's totally new!<eos> A Biro with a mic!<eos> We had those in your chancellery back in 72.<eos> It's not a mic.
Like... my coffee table. I've had it for years and I've probably looked at it a million times, but after he... Familiar objects just became distorted and unfamiliar.<eos> I started to hate my ceiling fan, my cereal bowl, my tea kettle.<eos> Okay, last question.<eos> Are you legitimately suicidal?<eos> If you knew what came after... this life... do you think it would affect your decision-making or maybe even make you change your mind?
Bunnies, kittens, pigs, monkeys.<eos> What happens to them after they die?<eos> I mean, I feel like they really deserve an afterlife.<eos> Do they have their own animal afterlife?<eos> And if they do, is it subdivided by species?
What?<eos> On his left arm in that exact spot, there was a different tattoo.<eos> - How is that possible?<eos> - I don't know, but in the lab, I saw it.<eos> It wasn't a lighthouse. It was waves on his arm.
All right.<eos> I'm coming.<eos> I didn't know, so, I couldn't stop it.<eos> Slow down and tell me exactly what happened.<eos> He hooked himself up to the device. He wanted to prove that it works.
Slow down and tell me exactly what happened.<eos> He hooked himself up to the device. He wanted to prove that it works.<eos> - Dad's hooked up right now?<eos> - Yes.<eos> We need to tell him that it works.
- And she drew a bath.<eos> - I know.<eos> And in the Pat Phillips recording, he has a different tattoo on his arm.<eos> I always said the afterlife was a different plane of existence.<eos> But... what if it's a different plane... of this existence?
And I went, "How much?<eos> 50,000?<eos> Okay."<eos> So that made the myth of the black dude with the big dick in white society, it made it real.<eos> It made it real for society, and they went, "What?"
I mean, it's an entire act, so why not?<eos> I mean, yeah, of course I'd like to have a script, something to actually do, work on.<eos> Not just... plop up camera there.<eos> That takes all the mad movie magic out of it.<eos> Yeah, the Internet wasn't around when I first got into the business, and then it destroyed the business pretty much.
We won't do the full spread every day, but it's nice to start off right.<eos> So, how'd your project end up last night? With Tony.<eos> Fine.<eos> For history, right?<eos> Yeah, uh, it's, um, it's this oral history project, about, like, students who came before us and stuff.
You can't imagine the first thing about my life right now.<eos> Bryce is a total vampire.<eos> That thing on your neck is huge.<eos> Oh, I know, right?<eos> Maybe you say it's nothing, Alex.
If you're going to do a memorial, I'm going to take pictures.<eos> Mrs. Baker. Hi.<eos> I'm Courtney Crimsen.<eos> I'm so sorry for your loss.<eos> I hope you like it.
You should know.<eos> But then, the pictures you took that night aren't the reason you're on this tape, are they?<eos> We're talking about one picture in particular.<eos> Goddamn it, Tyler.<eos> How bad is it?
- Yeah.<eos> I think I'm just gonna... pass the project on to the next student.<eos> Sounds very collaborative.<eos> A colleague of mine is studying collaborative learning theory.<eos> It actually strengthens your synapses.
You're going, right?<eos> - Well, I...<eos> - Can you drive?<eos> Because I'm restricted, and Courtney's dads are just strict, and Ashley's car's old.<eos> - It's not that old.
Wait, wait, wait. Be careful!<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> Well...<eos> I love this car.<eos> It has that new car smell.
Like, if you wanted to, I could help you finish the paper.<eos> Oh, my God! Clay, really?<eos> Thank you.<eos> I mean... that damn book is hard.<eos> Like, the sentences are so long, then it's, like, in Spanish...
No talk.<eos> We'll communicate through semaphores.<eos> I can see how you'd think I'd be the one person to laugh at that, but...<eos> Where's your bike?<eos> I uh... messed up the crank... so I left it with Tony, to fix it.
Ex nihilo nihil fit.<eos> "Out of nothing comes nothing."<eos> I just don't like it when people read my... things.<eos> Every poem you write should be like someone reading your things.<eos> It should be terrifying and incredibly embarrassing.
So humiliating.<eos> It has been brought to my attention that Ryan's publication now includes poetry.<eos> And since we're doing sonnets this semester, and since you're all going to be distracted by it anyway, I thought we would take a minute to parse the work of this poet.<eos> There's a sort of naked vulnerability to it that I like.<eos> It's quite intimate.
I'm sorry to bother you at work.<eos> I wanted to give you something.<eos> It's from Hannah.<eos> Well, it's not Hannah's, but there's a poem... that she wrote.<eos> It's really good.
You say the school had no idea my daughter was suicidal, but you published a poem in that school paper that says exactly what she was feeling.<eos> Okay, hang on.<eos> This isn't a school-sanctioned publication.<eos> This is one of the students' independent art projects.<eos> It's distributed on campus.
This is one of the students' independent art projects.<eos> It's distributed on campus.<eos> Teachers were discussing this poem in class when they should have been getting help for the kid that wrote it.<eos> Okay, to be fair, this was published anonymously.<eos> Did anyone try to find out who wrote it?
MR. PORTER: Hey, Ryan, thanks for coming in.<eos> I wanted to ask you a question about this poem.<eos> Do you remember where it came from?<eos> Someone slipped it into my locker last year.<eos> - Yeah, I thought it was well-written.
So you didn't actually find it on campus.<eos> Isn't that the whole conceit of the magazine?<eos> Sometimes I get submissions anonymously.<eos> Why are you asking me about this?<eos> It seems that Hannah Baker wrote it.
Are you more of a beer person or a beer person?<eos> Tough call. Uh...<eos> I'll take beer.<eos> Excellent choice, madam.<eos> Tonight, it is being served lukewarm in questionably clean cups and devoid of any flavor. - Cheers.
I want my bike.<eos> Your bike?<eos> Seriously?<eos> Yes, you fucking asshole, I want my bike.<eos> It's out back, behind the building.
Fucking beer everywhere.<eos> It wasn't Jeff's fault.<eos> The stop sign on the corner had been knocked down earlier in the night.<eos> I don't know. The cops thought it was Jeff's fault, I guess.<eos> But it was already down.
- Hell if I know.<eos> Have we found a smoking gun?<eos> School magazine.<eos> The graffiti.<eos> Lainie's concerned that we painted over it, says it could be construed as destroying evidence.
I like the name Hannah.<eos> At that moment... everything was perfect.<eos> And for the first time in a long time... I could imagine a future where I was happy.<eos> How good life could be.<eos> And I know you felt it too.
We can make it.<eos> We can.<eos> We're the ones who live.<eos> Lose the car?<eos> It's somewhere safe.
Yeah, they got a kettle... No, thanks.<eos> Okay. I'll be back in 10.<eos> Enjoy your new place.<eos> Good mornin', sunshine.<eos> Is it just as cozy as you remember?
You can keep watch tonight.<eos> We gonna win today?<eos> Yeah.<eos> We're gonna need batteries for that walkie, too.<eos> Get it working again.
You know... we don't have to get it done tomorrow.<eos> We can take our time.<eos> If we go another day, another one after that, it's fine.<eos> I mean, the place is clear.<eos> It's locked up tight.
They can't.<eos> The need more guns, more people, more time, more excuses.<eos> I memorized everything Daryl and Carl told Rick about the inside of Negan's place.<eos> Jesus made me a map of the outside.<eos> It's far away.
The need more guns, more people, more time, more excuses.<eos> I memorized everything Daryl and Carl told Rick about the inside of Negan's place.<eos> Jesus made me a map of the outside.<eos> It's far away.<eos> It's well-defended.
Look at this?<eos> Jay, this isn't what we talked about.<eos> Well, I think a lot of times in real estate, it's about managing expectations.<eos> Now, this is the first time this house has been shown. This is the first showing.<eos> So, if you like it, we should write up an offer today.

Wakin' in the dawn of day<eos> Phone ringing' off the shelf Watch that jab.<eos> It's hard to explain Come on!<eos> Yeah, yeah. How'd your audition go?<eos> It was humiliating.
It's the damn pumps.<eos> What pumps?<eos> The pumps up at the delta.<eos> There's plenty of water there.<eos> It's just not coming here.
Look, I followed the scorpion.<eos> He's working for someone. Who?<eos> I don't know...<eos> But it's got nothing to do with your dad... Hiring workers, it's all part of something bigger... By getting farmers to sell their land.<eos> Why? If the land's not worth anything... Why would anyone want to buy it?
They've all been bought by corporations... Not one private owner.<eos> It doesn't make sense.<eos> Okay, I'll be right there.<eos> So, what do you got?<eos> I tracked the signal from your phone, this is where it ends.
Okay, have fun in what's left of my brain.<eos> I'm gonna transfer to yours.<eos> Oh, there's not enough room for all my genius, so I'm leaving you with my fear of wicker furniture, my desire to play the trumpet, my tentative plans to purchase a hat, and six years of improv workshops.<eos> Comedy comes in threes.<eos> It's a trap!
Hey Car, are you ready...?<eos> Oh my God. That dress is gorgeous.<eos> Mom got you the prom dress.<eos> - She said we could pick it up. - If I made elite.<eos> It's beautiful.
Well, I was talking to Rebecca, and she said you owe me a date.<eos> Well played.<eos> So I was thinking. How about the zoo?<eos> It's a date.<eos> But it has to be sometime in the afternoon because I practice pretty much every day.
Oh, for heaven sakes, how do you kids feel about the house?<eos> - It's great.<eos> - Nice windows.<eos> It's really open. The feng shui is all right.<eos> But more importantly, do you like it?
Go over there.<eos> Go!<eos> I heard you've been spending some time with this piece.<eos> This reminds me of a painting that was in the house that I grew up in.<eos> It's not the actual painting, but it's the memory of it, and it brings me back to a happy time.
So, I showed him where the book was, keep it on a chain. Why do you keep your phone book on a chain?<eos> Well, remember in the '70s?<eos> People used to steal 'em.<eos> Anyhoo, he looks through it, and then just tears a page out.<eos> Which, it's a public book, which... Meant for everyone. So, I raise a ruckus.
We were talking, and...<eos> You were talking about my ass with your boss? No.<eos> I was using his computer on account of vermin ate through my cord, and he just... He asked if I still had you as a con, and I said...<eos> I hate that word, "con."<eos> It's so negative.
No, I'm afraid not.<eos> Shall we choose a vessel?<eos> No, I'm not...<eos> Here's a tune.<eos> It's called A Christmas Song.
Shall we choose a vessel?<eos> No, I'm not...<eos> Here's a tune.<eos> It's called A Christmas Song.<eos> Looks like it's destined to become one of the Yuletide season's genuine standards.
Can we go eat already?<eos> All right, sure. Just give me a sec, sweetie.<eos> Sit down.<eos> So, how's my screenplay coming along?<eos> You know, it's... It's pretty good, actually.
I never asked 'em to. Well, he wants you to come back.<eos> Found the motel from the photo.<eos> Got a lead on this actress, I think, Vivian Lord.<eos> Wow. So, what do you want me to tell the new chief?<eos> Tell him I saw the ocean and it was wet.
Yes, sir.<eos> Thank you, sir.<eos> And you're gonna sign a paper saying that you're not gonna sue us for wrongful termination or whatever half-cocked scheme comes into your head once the shock wears off.<eos> You got my word.<eos> We had your word, for all the good it did us.
In case he decided to say no.<eos> He stashed it in a bus locker.<eos> A lot of good that did him.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Look, it may not help Shane, but it might help you and the kids get set up.
I know that, and I have money put away.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Well, whatever it is, it ain't enough.<eos> Look, it's not just the money I'm thinking about.<eos> I'm keeping this baby. I want to raise it right.
The only person who knows where I am right now... is me.<eos> The majesty of God is undeniable.<eos> Listen.<eos> The knowledge of God is infinite.<eos> It's fuckin' majestic.
Get out of here!<eos> What did your pillow say to you?<eos> What...<eos> No, no, no.<eos> It spoke to you. What did it say?
The fact of the matter is he removed his ankle device.<eos> It was a clear act of deception and contrary to the terms of his electronic supervision.<eos> The DA makes a point, counselor.<eos> That device isn't a swatch watch.<eos> It's supposed to stay on.
But I always thought she was just a placeholder, you know?<eos> Then this baby comes along.<eos> And gets in the way of everything.<eos> If that one little sperm had just stopped short, I'd be preaching lies on TV right now.<eos> And now it's gone.
I'm looking at a whole goddamn book.<eos> And the only thing in question is the ending.<eos> Do I actually find out what's wrong with you and solve your problem, or do I spit the words "I told you so"<eos> right into the hole I carve in your brain after you OD'd on drugs you never should have taken?<eos> Either way, it's going to be a great book.
Crys, I swear I'm not having any visions.<eos> I need Anne's keys.<eos> You know what that poison does to you, Dad, don't you?<eos> - Turns your heart into stone.<eos> I-It works.
Crys, leave this.<eos> I don't want you getting involved.<eos> They told me about this drug that you took.<eos> Why are you taking it?<eos> It's for anxiety.
I'm sure it'll go pretty quick.<eos> This neighborhood's on the rise.<eos> So it's not going to be for you?<eos> I got my dream house in escrow, KD.<eos> I don't mind if you stay here until it sells.
Crystal, what are you doing here?<eos> Pernell is following me around like a lost puppy.<eos> I just needed a break from everything.<eos> This might cheer you up.<eos> PJ's manifesto, it's up to 400,000 views.
I see the "for sale" sign's gone.<eos> You sold the house already?<eos> No.<eos> I'm moving in.<eos> You liked it that much?
I don't need Pernell.<eos> I could never be a preacher.<eos> I get stage fright.<eos> Like crippling.<eos> When I was a kid, it was so bad, I had to use a puppet to do oral presentations in class.
We'll buy him three.<eos> Yeah, right! We can't even afford a toy one.<eos> I know how to get one.<eos> By the way, how did you get such a nice horse?<eos> Picó gave it to me.
- Mossad can't be trusted to be even remotely objective on this.<eos> - What do you suggest?<eos> - Saul Berenson.<eos> The nuclear arrangement started with Saul.<eos> He wants it to work.
That means no surprises.<eos> They found the money.<eos> The $5,000.<eos> It was in your bedroom under your mattress.<eos> Yeah, so it wouldn't get stolen.
They found the money.<eos> The $5,000.<eos> It was in your bedroom under your mattress.<eos> Yeah, so it wouldn't get stolen.<eos> Well, the FBI is saying it's material support for a foreign terrorist organization.

His name is Saad Mahsud.<eos> He's a friend.<eos> The guy that I made the videos with.<eos> And he'll confirm what you're saying?<eos> That it was just a loan for travel.
You're saying he's the enemy?<eos> Not on this.<eos> Not on Iran.<eos> The nuclear arrangement started with Saul.<eos> He wants it to work.
You cover the Israelis like paint.<eos> Technical glitch.<eos> So?<eos> There's a... a Russian traveling carnival that features a squirrel that's running on a wire wheel.<eos> The squirrel thinks it's turning the wheel, but if it stops running, its feet get caught in the wires and the squirrel breaks its paws.
Yeah. Yeah, there's some psychological issues.<eos> Including violent outbursts.<eos> He hated it at the V.A.<eos> Still, you moved him into your house.<eos> No, in-into the basement. It's a separate apartment.
Okay.<eos> So, I'm seeing Facebook accounts, Instagram, Twitter... 4chan, 8chan, fuckin' LinkedIn, whatever.<eos> We're there.<eos> And this interface masks your identity.<eos> It did until it stopped working.
If I can get to Athens-- And I think I can-- only you and Father Matsoukis know about the rectory.<eos> The rectory?<eos> Of course.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> And here I thought all these years that it would be our little hideaway
- Mommy!<eos> Hi!<eos> Hi, sweetheart.<eos> We'd gone to search a warehouse.<eos> He had intel that it was a bomb factory.
Previously on Homeland...<eos> This video of my son is not political speech.<eos> It is not someone's protected opinion.
Any idea what the Solicitor General was doing on the ground at the time of the explosion?<eos> Apparently an investigation of some kind was under way.<eos> - When the bomb detonated?<eos> - Correct. The residence was booby-trapped, that much is clear.<eos> Worst case, it's an ISIS safe house. For Chrissake, keep your voice down.
May 14, 2007, the day he was killed.<eos> Rudy, you were there that day, out on patrol with Captain Keane, weren't you? - Mm-hmm.<eos> - You want to tell us what happened?<eos> Yeah, we had, um... Well, we'd gone to search a warehouse in Sadr City.<eos> Um, we had Intel that it was a bomb factory.
- No?<eos> - No.<eos> They had support from inside our own intelligence community.<eos> The deal with Iran has been formally adopted.<eos> It's settled policy.
I watched it.<eos> This financier he's talking about is a Mossad agent.<eos> The whole thing is a charade.<eos> The only charade was the deal itself.<eos> It never had a chance.
And he didn't give a shit what he had to do to get 'em.<eos> But he did three tours.<eos> He must have taken some risks.<eos> We'd gone to search a warehouse in Sadr City.<eos> We had intel it was a bomb factory.
You have ID?<eos> Okay.<eos> I'm sure each president can remember a time not that long ago when there was this consensus-- you are entitled to your own opinions, but you are not entitled to your own facts.<eos> This video of my son is not political speech.<eos> It is not someone's protected opinion.

Somebody calls me "deplorable,"<eos> I think they should say it to my face.<eos> You've got bigger issues-- our friend here shooting videos of the two of us together.<eos> He says the whole thing's a misunderstanding.<eos> It's not.
But nothing before that?<eos> No.<eos> I'm told you took a video while I was here of Mr. O'Keefe and me.<eos> I didn't.<eos> Where is it?
This is Lord Uhtred of Bebbanburg and of Wessex!<eos> It's sport, Lord, a pastime.<eos> Your sport is over.<eos> Pick up your sword.<eos> Pick it up.
Hmm. "Money" sounds familiar, but--<eos> The bank. I'm from the bank.<eos> Ah, yes, the bank.<eos> Well, welcome to my humble home.<eos> It does seem to need a little work.
The bank. I'm from the bank.<eos> Ah, yes, the bank.<eos> Well, welcome to my humble home.<eos> It does seem to need a little work.<eos> Well, I realize it's not as fancy as the Baudelaire mansion, but perhaps, children, with a bit of your money, we'll be able to fix it up, make it nicer.
You can hang my underwear on that rack when you're done washing it.<eos> This is the backyard, which needs weeding, mowing and pruning.<eos> It is also where you will chop wood.<eos> Bathroom number seven, the only one you are allowed to use.<eos> It has all the usual amenities, though the management regrets to inform you that the shampoo is not tear-free.

It's okay, Sunny, he's gone.<eos> He's horrible.<eos> Did you see the tattoo on his ankle?<eos> A tattoo is just a decorative pigment on skin. It's not a sign of a wicked person.<eos> Unless it's on a wicked person.
Do you have a paper and pencil to take notes?<eos> Always.<eos> - What's that?<eos> - It's something my parents had.<eos> - What is it?
How can I feel you touching me if I'm not touching myself?<eos> When you jerk off, do you think about your hand or do you think about something else?<eos> I am something else.<eos> Capital exists beyond the auspices of ethics, morals or even law.<eos> Does it feel this real because we're so close?
And this, arguably one of his greatest paintings.<eos> An iconic work of individuals setting aside their differences for a common good.<eos> Yet, in its day, this painting was ridiculed, called "a mess," "the work of an amateur."<eos> There were stories about the gents who hired Rembrandt refusing to pay because they were unhappy with their likenesses.<eos> The painting was so unappreciated that when they moved from one hall to another, they decided it was too big, so they just slashed chunks off the bottom and the side.
No, we should get out of here.<eos> The devil!<eos> She's the devil!<eos> [Amanita] ...toilet paper gets stuck to your fucking shoe.<eos> You step on it with the other foot and then it sticks to your other foot and then it takes for-fucking-ever to get rid of it.
This is ridiculous.<eos> I... I have...<eos> I'll get you the ten grand. I'm sorry about that.<eos> There's really no way to get to the car?<eos> It's in the impound lot, Katie, the impound lot.
Trust me, you've made the right decision.<eos> You two will be so happy here!<eos> Can't believe we finally got our own home!<eos> I told you we'd get there.<eos> I can't believe it came fully furnished.
It's in my way.<eos> - What?<eos> - I'm super mad at you.<eos> Is this because I wouldn't let you use my apricot facial scrub?<eos> It was at the end of the tube, I swear.
Tablescape. It's called tablescape.<eos> - Oh, hello. We're in here.<eos> You know if the phone works?<eos> Oh! Merry Christmas.<eos> It does.
Every single cell is simultaneously a muscle cell and a nerve cell and a photoreceptive cell.<eos> So the creature, as a whole, is, in a very real sense, all muscle, all brain, all eye.<eos> As such, Calvin now possesses the means to interact with its environment, including the use of what appears to be proto-appendages.<eos> I'll demonstrate.<eos> But notice how it's approaching and not retreating.
"...and that there was more of it during the night.<eos> "We can observe, too, how the recollection of a dream,<eos> "which was still lively in the morning,<eos> "will melt away, except for a few small fragments..."<eos> This book doesn't have pictures in it, does it?
I'm just saying you can't compare Calvin to anthrax.<eos> Stop... Stop calling it fucking "Calvin."<eos> We don't know what that thing is.<eos> Yeah?<eos> And you're in there, and you're playing around with it like it's your buddy.
- The system won't give me access to it.<eos> - Full manual.<eos> Shut them down, okay?<eos> How smart is this thing?<eos> It feels the airflow.
- Just shut it down!<eos> Shut it down now!<eos> - We are on it.<eos> Guys, it's gone.<eos> - It got out.
Maybe it was your fault, maybe it was my fault, maybe...<eos> I don't know, it doesn't matter, does it?<eos> Getting this thing on board was a risk, and we knew it from the beginning.<eos> I took it.<eos> It's just surviving.
I thought your parents went up to see you.<eos> They did, but, uh...<eos> I read your book.<eos> We all have.<eos> It caused quite a stir around here.
- Are you kidding? - Why didn't you...<eos> - oh, oh, oh.<eos> - There we go.<eos> Are you sure I can't interest you in an elixir?<eos> It... it's small batch and very fresh. - No, thank you.
Uh, so there is no security cameras, but he asked if you tried the "find your iPhone" program.<eos> No, I turned it off 'cause of international data. Oh.<eos> Uh... He turned it off because it'd be expensive for international data.<eos> That's too bad.<eos> It would have been very useful to have it on in this case.
No, I turned it off 'cause of international data. Oh.<eos> Uh... He turned it off because it'd be expensive for international data.<eos> That's too bad.<eos> It would have been very useful to have it on in this case.<eos> Well, he said that's too bad, because in this case, it would've been very useful to have it on.
Yeah.<eos> That's a better idea.<eos> Look, that's the thief!<eos> I'm a good detective.<eos> Call your phone and see if it rings.
I'm sorry, Mario.<eos> Just a second.<eos> What do you think?<eos> The telephone is in the sauce?<eos> No, but it smells spectacular!
Can we also have a little taste?<eos> Not for you!<eos> Get out of here! Go!<eos> Go outside!<eos> It tastes perfectly cooked.
What's up?<eos> What's wrong with you?<eos> Why are you so sad?<eos> You still thinking about that girl?<eos> I just haven't met anyone I had a connection with like that in a long time, and it's gonna go away for a stupid reason.
By deconstructing space-time into a higher number of dimensions our tower is able to create a mirrored echo of our local universe.<eos> You're copying the entire universe?<eos> ...symmetry down to every last quantum particle with one crucial difference.<eos> The echo universe will be devoid of organic compounds.<eos> Instead, it will be a lifeless cosmos providing a limitless amount of matter that can be transformed into power.
One, two...<eos> It's not working.<eos> We need to apply side pressure.<eos> Okay, try it again.<eos> - Pull! - It's out.
Truth is, Donny I don't really know where home is anymore.<eos> Will Porter, please call in as soon as possible.<eos> You know, Donny, there are a lot of very important very smart people in these towers.<eos> And they wanted Uncle Will to move halfway across the world move our home after it goes through all to be part of a very special project.<eos> It's something that could help a lot people, you know?
Shit!<eos> You get to the tower and you end this!<eos> You end this, Will!<eos> Truth is, Donny they wanted Uncle Will to be part of a very special project.<eos> It's something that could help a lot of people, you know?
Tell me.<eos> We're moving to Oregon.<eos> What... what are you talking about?<eos> I bought a place with the insurance money, and I bought a new car.<eos> Well, it's a new used car, but it's a Mercedes, and we're gonna pack some shit; we're gonna get in that car; we're gonna go to a new place;
- But Mom!<eos> - Do it now!<eos> Here's some... here's some money.<eos> There's a... there's a motel, the Kings Motel.<eos> It's just... just up the road. You can stay there.
I'm a hairdresser now!<eos> No, seriously, I know of a job that might interest you.<eos> We'll talk about that later.<eos> Wow, the house is lovely!<eos> It still needs a few touches... Some pictures on the walls...
No, seriously, I know of a job that might interest you.<eos> We'll talk about that later.<eos> Wow, the house is lovely!<eos> It still needs a few touches... Some pictures on the walls...<eos> It looks great.
Hello.<eos> I left a message on the phone.<eos> I was with Marta, from school, and two other girls.<eos> You want to live your life?<eos> Then you can pay for it.
- Mama Gus!<eos> I guess I just, uh, became self-aware of how dorky this conversation is, and I don't want anybody to overhear us, so...<eos> Those girls can't hear you! It doesn't matter.<eos> Oh, we can hear you.<eos> Yeah, it's the dorkiest conversation ever.

She's a great tambourine player.<eos> What the fuck?<eos> That's nothing to brag about.<eos> Anybody can play the motherfucking tambourine.<eos> That is not true. It is a difficult instrument to play.
But here...<eos> You know what?<eos> What?<eos> No.<eos> Oh. If it was latent, it could be...
Did you kill my father, Agent Booth?<eos> There's been a shooting.<eos> It was the safe house where we put Max and the kids.<eos> I just got a location for Kovac's phone.<eos> It's in a moving car, headed south.
Please tell me that son of a bitch is either dead or in custody.<eos> And if I have a choice, I choose dead.<eos> Yeah, well, I'm afraid that it's neither.<eos> The phone was a decoy, okay?<eos> It was taped to the bottom of a delivery van.
Well, we just got to wait.<eos> You know, right?<eos> The lab is...<eos> It's-it's a mess.<eos> But it's usable, and she's there now.
It's not.<eos> All right, Bones, look, you got to give it some time, all right?<eos> I know guys from the service who have lost their memory, okay, and it comes back.<eos> No, this is not just a simple case of amnesia-- it...<eos> my brain, it's... it's different.
I wish you'd told me you were into model trains.<eos> I would have brought Lance Jr. with me.<eos> I am not playing with trains, Daisy.<eos> I am making a map.<eos> Since Booth couldn't track the drag marks, I customized an old Jeffersonian display so it can match the particulates found in Ian's injuries to specific locations in the woods.
Trust me, if I've learned anything being in this chair, it's that happiness comes from accepting what you have.<eos> But what if what I have is just one big question mark?<eos> Yeah. Tell me about it.<eos> Look at this thing.<eos> I mean, it's so insane that it's actually kind of brilliant.
He told me he was overmedicated.<eos> Well, if he did, then he lied.<eos> All right, let's just pretend for a second that I believe you.<eos> He tell you why he needed that money? No.<eos> He said it was urgent.
Hey. You're on it.<eos> So, the accomplice's car - has no license plate on it.<eos> - Yeah, and those windows are too tinted to give us an I.D.<eos> What about the car itself?<eos> Well, it looks like a junker, like it's just a bunch of mismatched parts.
The clothes on this guy are perfectly preserved.<eos> Dr. Hodgins, look at the cuff - on his right arm.<eos> - I need you to tell me what you see.<eos> I am seeing what appears to be dried blood.<eos> And if it's from the lobbyist...
Is chicken better?<eos> It's a question of whether you wanna be shot or, hung.<eos> The flesh food that I would eliminate from the American diet would be poultry, would be turkey and chicken. A brilliant advertising campaign has convinced people that oh, it's white meat, it's healthier.<eos> The leading source of Sodium, in the American diet for adults is chicken.<eos> It can be labeled all natural chicken but, be injected with salt water.
I just thought of them as a standard part of a healthy diet.<eos> But, then I found a study suggesting that eating just one egg a day can be as bad as smoking five cigarettes per day for life expectancy.<eos> Yolk of a hen's egg is the most concentrated glom of saturated fat and cholesterol.<eos> It is made to run a baby chicken for 21 days with no outside energy.<eos> It is pure fat and cholesterol.

They get fungal infections, they get bacterial infections, you've got to feed them anti-fungals, antibiotics, and these substances accumulate in the fish flesh as well.<eos> I always knew that pollution was bad for our health, but I had never thought about the environmental pollutants affecting food.<eos> Dioxins being the most toxic, man-made chemicals known to science cause all sorts of things.<eos> They cause endometriosis, they cause cancers, they cause endocrine disruption problems.<eos> But, most of your exposure, 93 percent of it, comes from eating meat and dairy products because it climbs up in the food chain so effectively.
And that Dioxin will accumulate in its fat, which includes the milk and the meat and anyone eating meat or dairy products is gonna get that dose of Dioxin.<eos> So, it climbs up the food chain in every step.<eos> Men have no way in their bodies to get rid of dioxins, but, women have two ways.<eos> They're both involving having a baby.<eos> One is that dioxin crosses the placenta into the growing infant and the other is that it comes out from the breast milk.
That molecule drives cholesterol into the artery walls.<eos> And the people who will consume this flesh-based diet are contributing to plaque building up, they may lose weight on this diet and that's good, but, what's happening inside your arteries, Paleo friends?<eos> What's happening is that plaque is building up, and these are the folks who drop dead at the gym at 39.<eos> Boy, he was lean and he looked really good, but, where is that cholesterol going?<eos> It's going into your artery walls.
Turns out Dr. Walter Kempner from Duke University back in the 1940s was reversing some of our worst killer diseases with diet alone.<eos> And the diet he was using was not only strictly plant-based but, it was made up of white rice, fruit and table sugar.<eos> And he was reversing diabetes, he was reversing malignant hypertension, reversing heart disease, the diabetic complications, reversing diabetic blindness.<eos> So, these people basically had death sentences, went to him, and were given basically sugar.<eos> You know, this horrible diet, but, it was strictly plant-based.
Cholesterol.<eos> Heterocyclic amines.<eos> E. coli, you know, if you think about it, there is nothing in an animal-based diet that you can't get in a healthier form somewhere else.<eos> The only other vitamin is vitamin B12.<eos> It's not made by plants, not made by animals either, made by little microbes that blanket the Earth.
- Running.<eos> - For two hours?<eos> You'll be the one that benefits when I have abs.<eos> Y-You left your phone.<eos> It kept ringing.
- For two hours?<eos> You'll be the one that benefits when I have abs.<eos> Y-You left your phone.<eos> It kept ringing.<eos> I saw it was Bonnie, so I answered it.
Connor, it's Annalise.<eos> I need all of you to come to the house.<eos> I got your voice-mail.<eos> So I went to the house.<eos> It was open.
I object, Your Honor, on the grounds of hearsay.<eos> The D.A. is referring to a supposed out-of-court statement of which we have no proof.<eos> Here's the proof, Your Honor.<eos> The prosecution enters into evidence this affidavit from the Federal District of Mexico City.<eos> It contains a statement from Ms. Castillo confessing that she made a false claim of kidnapping as a teenager.
I mean, I know she works, but...<eos> She is a single mother.<eos> I can give you this beautiful recipe for a pear cardamom pie.<eos> - That sounds complicated.<eos> - Oh, it's simple.
I'm trying to help him.<eos> The fuck you are.<eos> Look, I don't want to hurt you.<eos> But you fix him right now, or this knife is going in your throat.<eos> No, it won't, Grace.
What have you guys been eating this whole time?<eos> I mean how... how are you even alive?<eos> We scavenge during the day when it's safe.<eos> We've got food stored.<eos> Well, it's enough to last a few years.
No, this race...<eos> Is the greatest sacrifice in human history.<eos> It's a bloodstained altar, the gore-soaked peak of a Mayan temple, the smoke from an erupting volcano on Mount Olympus!<eos> And that pleasing aroma is not for God.<eos> It's for Heart Enterprises, the most powerful corporation in the known universe!
I guess Heart should have left me in charge.<eos> It worked on her before.<eos> You only shocked her before.<eos> She's right.<eos> They built it for killing drivers on the race, - not for during the after party.
Can't let you do this, Sheriff. I ain't asking you.<eos> You know this isn't right.<eos> I ain't taking life advice from a tin star.<eos> Out here, justice is in the hand of the man holding the gun.<eos> And it's swift.
Fuck.<eos> What's happening?<eos> - Do you want to live or not?<eos> - Yeah, I want to live.<eos> Adrenaline's our only play, but it's got to be a hell of a lot.
So, how was your fancy dinner?<eos> I can't wait to try this beef "bourbonnon."<eos> Bourguignon.<eos> We finished it.<eos> It was that good.
It's my boyfriend.<eos> He...<eos> I came home last time after coming to see you, and I said that we should cool it. And he got angry, he's just a different person when he uses.<eos> He can...<eos> And he sells everything, just pills, coke, Fentanyl, and I won't touch that shit 'cause I know it's too addicting.
He injected Jonathan with demon blood.<eos> Why would he do that?<eos> He's sick.<eos> He thought demon blood would make our unborn child strong.<eos> And it did.
Why would he do that?<eos> He's sick.<eos> He thought demon blood would make our unborn child strong.<eos> And it did.<eos> But it also made him... evil.
I promise.<eos> Well, you look like you could use a drink.<eos> And a towel.<eos> Just your phone?<eos> I'd ask what happened to yours, but I'm guessing it got wet.
Nothing, I'm fine. - Yeah?<eos> Mmm-hmm.<eos> - Yeah. Remember Aunt Cheryl?<eos> She had melanoma.<eos> It was a freckle.
What is it?<eos> What's wrong?<eos> - Let go.<eos> - The sound in my head.<eos> - It's coming from Valentine, isn't it? - What sound?
It's not possible. What is it?<eos> Tell me!<eos> What is Valentine doing to me?<eos> It's not Valentine.<eos> It is an angel.
Together.<eos> - If Dad were here he'd understand...<eos> - Well, he's not.<eos> Alec... I don't want to fight with you.<eos> This dinner, it should be about family.
Yeah, it's a Shadowhunter party.<eos> Are you okay with that?<eos> Didn't think he had it in him.<eos> Guess your date didn't go so well.<eos> No, it went great.
Your bite...<eos> It was so strong.<eos> But then...<eos> Vampire venom is more powerful than yin fen.<eos> It also wears off quicker.
Strange name for a weapon of mass destruction.<eos> Simon, we're not going to let him activate it.<eos> I'll do whatever it takes.<eos> Clary, you might be a Shadowhunter with all kinds of crazy abilities, that doesn't mean you can stop the inevitable.<eos> It's not inevitable, all right? It can't be.
Like a real-life Fault in Our Stars.<eos> That's not the plot of that book at all.<eos> - Really? - No.<eos> Oh, I never read it.<eos> I just kind of thought that's what it was about.
But now that he has the warlock girl, He's cast me aside.<eos> I'm myself again.<eos> good story, but I've heard better.<eos> Wait, in the vision from Ithuriel, the demon that destroyed the Sword had a clawed hand.<eos> Exactly. It has nothing to do with you.
You have something we need. I would like to<eos> - broker a deal with you. - How did you manage<eos> - to defeat him?<eos> - I gave him the amulet.<eos> It's a compass.
Rip just has a fragment of it.<eos> What inspired you to write it that way?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I just had this old piece of wood.<eos> I thought it'd be a cool movie prop.
What inspired you to write it that way?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I just had this old piece of wood.<eos> I thought it'd be a cool movie prop.<eos> - Where is it?
My thinking exactly.<eos> Now, it's possible the box could contain his son's birth certificate and the like, but...<eos> Given the exotic nature of the care that's been taken here,<eos> I would have to assume...<eos> - It's the rest of the Spear.
Now, it's possible the box could contain his son's birth certificate and the like, but...<eos> Given the exotic nature of the care that's been taken here,<eos> I would have to assume...<eos> - It's the rest of the Spear.<eos> When was it last accessed?
Because we've only got one shot at this.<eos> Remember, as long as you stay still, he can't sense you.<eos> Easy, Eobard.<eos> Easy.<eos> It won't stay trapped for long.
Since when are they taking orders from you?<eos> I don't know, but I kind of like it.<eos> She had something in her hand.<eos> She had her phone in her hand.<eos> Well, it didn't look like her phone, and I don't trust her, so I told them to move.
- A plane.<eos> You think you can find your way back to it?<eos> Yeah, probably, but...<eos> Malcolm, can you fly a plane?<eos> If it's anything like the 3 Gulfstreams I used to have, yes.
Well, that was excellent.<eos> - Yes. - Should I box this up?<eos> Oh, nah.<eos> Here, uh... Here's the card.<eos> - Yeah, thanks, Marty. Yeah, well, I've had better vindaloo, but I liked it okay.
- Okay.<eos> - Hey, there.<eos> - Hey. I was just reading that part where they were making fun of the Robert Cohn character.<eos> I had no idea how anti-Semitic this book was.<eos> Oh... yeah. I'm, like, ten pages in and I really like it, but, um, I just haven't had a chance to read a lot. - Sorry.
There is no way of pinpointing his IP or his GPS from his phone, which is probably just a burner anyway.<eos> That's good.<eos> How is that good?<eos> Military men tend to be creatures of habit.<eos> If Walker's using a burner, odds are it's the same model he used in the states.
In fact, it's the most popular gun in America.<eos> The land of the free, home of the incredibly stupid.<eos> We are not having this conversation now or ever, guys.<eos> Where are we with the gun?<eos> Nowhere. It hasn't been used in any prior crime.
- 18 people, by the way.<eos> - What? The mall shooting.<eos> 18 people killed, 12 injured.<eos> One's a quadriplegic now.<eos> Look, I know where you're going with this, but the feds had an assault weapons ban for years, and it did nothing.
That's what the mayor said.<eos> Come to say good-bye?<eos> Clear your conscience maybe? Heh!<eos> My conscience is clear.<eos> The hell it is.
And you're still in bed with these people?<eos> What? You make it sound like it's a bad thing.<eos> I mean, Pandora's just a tool.<eos> Sounds to me like this could be a weapon.<eos> Ok, and is there a problem if it is?
Chase anticipated this play.<eos> I never said that he wasn't clever.<eos> So am I.<eos> What's your toy doing?<eos> It's detecting resonance frequencies upstairs.
Finally we're getting somewhere.<eos> Confess.<eos> Oliver, we've been betrayed.<eos> Viktor, he--<eos> I am so very proud of this casino and what it means for our country.
I became what I had to become.<eos> You asked why I changed.<eos> That is it.<eos> This video has been authenticated by 3 different experts.<eos> And it hasn't been doctored or altered in any way.
How insane is "slightly insane"?<eos> Well, that depends on how you feel about setting off an explosive arrow in a room full of flammable gas.<eos> Careful, Rene.<eos> That seal is pure titanium.<eos> It has a melting point of between 1,600 and 1,700 degrees Celsius.
That's good.<eos> Let's get cooking.<eos> Careful!<eos> If the powder is one gram under, the grating won't blow.<eos> What if it's one gram over?
It used to be a Queen Consolidated holding company back in the day.<eos> I know.<eos> My father brought me here when I was younger.<eos> Said the building was named after me.<eos> Felicity's says it's been abandoned for about a month due to some toxic gas leak.
Said the building was named after me.<eos> Felicity's says it's been abandoned for about a month due to some toxic gas leak.<eos> Chase wanted everyone cleared out.<eos> It seems that way.<eos> It's a hell of a big building.
- How would Chase distribute it?<eos> It's aerosolized, so pretty much any way he wants.<eos> We have to find out where Chase is storing this thing and stop him before he releases it.<eos> Cyclotrizane degrades pretty quickly.<eos> Which means that it gives off trackable emissions.

Quentin doesn't know about her.<eos> That's why Chase will send her right there.<eos> We need to get the safe house on the phone now.<eos> You know what the worst part about a safe house is?<eos> It's not being able to use your cell phone.
Did Ollie--uh!<eos> I'm so sorry, Daddy.<eos> What do we know?<eos> You mean besides this being the horror version of "Groundhog Day"? Look.<eos> The security camera footage is grainy, but it's good enough to see Black Siren giving her best Laurel impression.
I always thought it was either stupid or ridiculous.<eos> I never really took it seriously.<eos> Until now, right?<eos> Yeah. I have this really bad feeling.<eos> It's right in the pit of my stomach.
Nick?<eos> He's not here.<eos> Maybe they're still in the tunnel dumping bodies.<eos> We're losing her, Nick.<eos> I hope that thing does what we think it does.
Are you sure?<eos> I'm not Valentine's son.<eos> Yet, the same blood runs through both your veins.<eos> The blood of the angel.<eos> Please, show me what it can do.
It's simple, really.<eos> All I ask is a kiss.<eos> You want one of us to kiss you?<eos> The game isn't for me.<eos> It's for you, Clary.
They said I was too pretty for their world... Too human.<eos> So they made me hideous.<eos> But they also taught me how to use my demon blood... how to... draw from its power.<eos> See, I may be grotesque in my own skin, but... with it I have power that you could only dream of.<eos> Then why keep the Verlac boy's visage if you're weaker for it?

So Jace and Clary are at this beach?<eos> Assuming they went through together.<eos> But none of it makes sense.<eos> How were they able to create a portal inside the Institute?<eos> Clearly, it wasn't a normal portal.
Assuming they went through together.<eos> But none of it makes sense.<eos> How were they able to create a portal inside the Institute?<eos> Clearly, it wasn't a normal portal.<eos> Whatever it was, there's something strange about the portal for the wards not to recognize it.
I was worried.<eos> I didn't know where you went.<eos> It was at least an hour until I found the blood... in the snow.<eos> I thought something terrible had happened.<eos> But it wasn't my blood, was it father?
I can't believe I forgot.<eos> It's OK, Alexander.<eos> If we can't go to the Cape, I'll bring the Cape to us.<eos> Lobster tails and champagne to toast to a successful Downworld meeting.<eos> - It went well?
What?<eos> How can you tell?<eos> The blood from his eyes, I've seen it before.<eos> It's a warlock incantation.<eos> It's basically their version of a cyanide capsule.
Greek alphabet, huh?<eos> Who knew dating a college boy would come in handy.<eos> Oh, no.<eos> Was it the word "dating?"<eos> No, no! It was the word college!
You're not answering your phone.<eos> It's off.
I was afraid of the distance, but, you know, it is not that bad.<eos> And it feels nice to be out of the congestion.<eos> So, that was it?<eos> That feeling of entrapment, that prompted the move?<eos> It's a little unorthodox.
Where'd you go?<eos> The West Village.<eos> We met at a café.<eos> - At that hour?<eos> - Yeah, it's open till, like, ten-ish.
- At that hour?<eos> - Yeah, it's open till, like, ten-ish.<eos> They serve beer and wine at night.<eos> And amazing coffee.<eos> What's it called?
All right, you guys ready?<eos> Yeah.<eos> As you've heard tonight, we have a philosophy of no secrets.<eos> So, as a way of connecting more truthfully, we have this little ritual.<eos> Don't worry. It's fun.
Modeling's a huge way that kids learn to be social.<eos> I mean, there are clear lines being drawn, even here.<eos> Jean, could you speak more to that?<eos> Well, the truth is, bully or victim, the feeling's just the same.<eos> It's insecurity and fear.
I now think there's a lot more to the story.<eos> I think he could be a sociopath.<eos> I hate when people throw that word around.<eos> Yeah, but if the shoe fits...<eos> In his case, it might be true.
Yeah, well, any other time I might be shy or scared, but... not now, not tonight.<eos> You sure about that?<eos> Yeah, I'm ready for the full Sidney experience.<eos> Sounds like an epic game.<eos> Maybe it is.
- Hey!<eos> Hey.<eos> Hi.<eos> We're still good for our date, right?<eos> - It's nothing fancy.
Okay, I'll see you at school.<eos> Perfect.<eos> Hey.<eos> You drive a mom car.<eos> It's my sister's.
I just, I need your help right now.<eos> Honey...<eos> I'm in over my head, and, um, I'm scared.<eos> There's a car outside.<eos> It's been parked there all day.
Some of you already know that I'm a cognitive behavioral therapist, and so I've been asked tonight to speak about how to prevent bullying in schools.<eos> But it's really not that simple.<eos> So, I don't want to rattle off statistics here.<eos> I want to address the root causes of bullying, and talk about what motivates that behavior.<eos> It often comes from a deep-seated lack of stability.
Why aren't you happy?<eos> What do you want that you do not have?<eos> At the moment, peace and quiet.<eos> No need to seize the last word, Lord Baelish.<eos> I'll assume it was something clever.
My wife just had our first baby.<eos> - Boy or girl?<eos> - Oh, who knows?<eos> You think soldiers get ravens with news from home?<eos> - I hope it's a girl.
There has been an Ibis and Jacquel in business here for 200 years.<eos> Pins for the bones.<eos> Threads for the muscles.<eos> Paint for the skin.<eos> We need to tend to your flesh as best we can as it can't tend to itself anymore.
America.<eos> Their America.<eos> There aren't just two Americas.<eos> Everyone looks at Lady Liberty and sees a different face.<eos> Even if it crumbles under question.
Look, it's early days, but... first tests show that her blood is attacking the cells in her body.<eos> Wait, that's the opposite of how my blood causes cells to regenerate.<eos> Precisely. Can we use my blood to save her?<eos> Listen, I don't think that your blood is the key to saving Iris.<eos> But I do think it might be exactly what we need to take down Yorkin.
If at first you don't succeed, try, try again.<eos> You have to stop him.<eos> I don't have it in me right now.<eos> I need you to get your blood into him.<eos> It'll counteract his cells and negate his powers.
We need to talk.<eos> Perhaps some sort of new metal akin to a Luttinger liquid?<eos> What do you think?<eos> Man, I don't know what this is.<eos> All I know, it just came off the armor of some Hindu speed god, so...
What do you think?<eos> Man, I don't know what this is.<eos> All I know, it just came off the armor of some Hindu speed god, so...<eos> It's like the box the philosopher's stone came in.<eos> It simultaneously exists and doesn't exist.
The future has not changed.<eos> All right.<eos> Well, we have two months to make sure that it does.<eos> Okay, well, we should approach this the same way we approach any other problem... start with what we know.<eos> Problem can't be solved if it's not understood.
Magic or tech, doesn't matter.<eos> You're not getting out of these.<eos> Maybe not.<eos> You let me go, I will tell you Savitar's greatest secret.<eos> It's the key to defeating him, the key to stopping him.
[chuckles] It's all coming together... in the worst way.<eos> You said you made Savitar? - How?<eos> - Peep this.<eos> Four years from now, future Flash creates... a time remnant to fight Savitar.<eos> But Savitar lets that remnant live so that it can later become Savitar.
It's a closed loop.<eos> No beginning, no end.<eos> It's just one endless cycle.<eos> Classic chicken and the egg scenario, I think, eh?<eos> A time remnant, it's, um... it's like a duplicate of you, right?
But if the Speed Force Bazooka doesn't start working soon, we're gonna have to start calling it the Speed Force Epic Fail.<eos> - Why? What's the problem?<eos> - Okay.<eos> The accelerometer.<eos> It sucks a hell of a lot of air watts, - which is measured...
- There's no time to test it now.<eos> - What is that thing?<eos> This can send electrical charges through the transmitters in his suit and theoretically, should jolt his memory.<eos> You want to electroshock his brain?<eos> Won't that fry it even more?
All right.<eos> I got about six hours and change until Cade takes Stefan's life, unless I give him that book.<eos> What's he want with it?<eos> I don't know.<eos> But if it saves my brother's life, I don't care.
It's the room where you found the journal.<eos> It's full of the sirens' treasures.<eos> There's tools and weapons.<eos> What is this?<eos> And what is it made from?
Bea, open the door!<eos> No, Bea!<eos> Don't leave me!<eos> Bea! I know their secret, Bea!<eos> It's in here!
Why do you only seem to care about loss when it's your own?<eos> Because... say it with me, Ric...<eos> I'm selfish.<eos> You have absolutely no idea... how important that journal was.<eos> I'm gonna take a shot and say that it was an instruction manual to kill Cade.
All good.<eos> She knows exactly what to do.<eos> And the girls are out like logs.<eos> I'm a little embarrassed that I suggested the problem was us,<eos> - when it was right in front of our eyes.
Enjoying what little life he had left with sex or friends.<eos> Or sex with friends.<eos> I just figured that's where you were going with that.<eos> Yeah, well, I mean, I don't know how down he was to party, but, you guys, I've seen a lot of messed up stuff.<eos> This toxin tore through his body like it was burning him from the inside out.
The choice is yours alone.<eos> Well, that's dramatic.<eos> When did you get this video?<eos> Yesterday.<eos> At first, I thought it was some sick joke.
Well, that's dramatic.<eos> When did you get this video?<eos> Yesterday.<eos> At first, I thought it was some sick joke.<eos> Fans send bizarre letters to my manager all the time, but this was sent directly to my personal e-mail, and it was so... disturbing.
So, he might actually be the first victim?<eos> I mean, the only difference is he has hot spots all over him, almost like the poison...<eos> Spilled on him.<eos> Exactly.<eos> But this stuff is so strong, Dan, that it killed him anyway.
But we'll get through this, buddy.<eos> No.<eos> No, that photo.<eos> Hold on one second.<eos> Where is it?
You do the opposite.<eos> Who's Malibu's closest rival?<eos> The lab in here is closed for renovation, so maybe he's here.<eos> Well, well, isn't this a surprise.<eos> It's locked, Detective.
It was slit with a knife.<eos> I'm not really sure this is our kind of thing.<eos> We don't know that.<eos> His blood could've been drained.<eos> It could've been?
Move, move, move, move, move.<eos> Claire.<eos> Okay, Claire, it's us. You know us.<eos> That thing ready yet? It's ready.<eos> It's ready.
That chain around your neck?<eos> Was nothing.<eos> A stylish accessory.<eos> This vessel... That's your true prison.<eos> It's been warded with runes and spellwork from the Cage, carved into every molecule.
Call it a miracle.<eos> Cass?<eos> What was that?<eos> It was, um... It was me.<eos> But it was also...
That completes my examination.<eos> Okay, drexel, as much as I enjoy playing doctor with you day after day, I need to blow this joint now.<eos> I beg you to be patient.<eos> Until I get the security device shut off, you completely belong to crowley.<eos> Okay, if it's at minimum power, and I'm at maximum power, I'll roll the dice, man.
These electrodes sync your Delta waves with Mary's forming a psychic link.<eos> But to enter her psyche will take a certain measure of concentration and skill.<eos> And as there's no time to teach you how to reach the necessary therapeutic dreamstate, I'm banking on this.<eos> Hypnotic agents laced with a potent sedative.<eos> It's enough to knock an elephant on its trunk.
Hey, listen to this -- two-headed calf was born in Lava Hot Springs, Idaho.<eos> That's weird.<eos> That is weird.<eos> Yeah, but not our kind of weird.<eos> Look, whatever this thing is gonna be, it -- it's gonna be big and bad --
A sword!<eos> Sven.<eos> Yes.<eos> It is me, Sven the One-Eye.<eos> Pick it up.
No, we go in as agreed, together.<eos> We cannot risk the both of us being killed.<eos> Yes, we can.<eos> This is for Alfred, you must save your sword for Kjartan.<eos> If it is for Alfred... I will go with you.
Is that so?<eos> I'm sorry Mr. Poe bothered you.<eos> [chuckles] I'm glad he did, because I want you three children to feel more at home here, now that I am your father.<eos> As you know, I have been working hard with my theater troupe, and I'm afraid I may have acted a bit standoffish.<eos> The word "standoffish" is a wonderful one, but it does not describe Count Olaf's behavior toward the children.
"Standoffish" refers to a person who, for various reasons, is not associating with others.<eos> It is a word which might describe somebody who, during a party, might stand in a corner instead of talking to another person.<eos> Gustav?<eos> Jacquelyn here. [sighs]<eos> It would not describe somebody who provides one bed for three people to sleep in, forces them to do horrible chores and strikes them across the face.
Participate how?<eos> [chuckles] I'm... [choking]<eos> The play is called The Marvelous Marriage, and is by the great playwright Al Funcoot.<eos> We will give only one performance, this Friday night.<eos> It tells the story of a very handsome and good-looking man, played by me.
Anything? Would you, for instance, consider marrying me during tomorrow night's performance?<eos> I would never, ever marry you.<eos> Hmm. Children... your sister is like a stick behind a stubborn mule.<eos> My sister's not a stick.<eos> Any animal owner will tell you that a stubborn mule will move toward the carrot because it wants the reward of food... and away from the stick because it wants to avoid the punishment of rump pain.
- Come inside.<eos> Come in, come in.<eos> Welcome to my home... um... uh...<eos> Well, there's a spare room upstairs.<eos> It's small, but like I said, I have three young children living with me,
There is no money!<eos> The safe is empty!<eos> Now would be a good time to get goin'.<eos> Have you ever known money to just disappear?<eos> It leaves a trace.
Can I help you find something?<eos> Yeah, I'm looking for a book.<eos> I don't know the author or the title.<eos> Do you know the genre?<eos> Just know it's about revenge.
I overheard Audrey talking to him, sayin' that he owed her.<eos> Why doesn't she just go to the cops?<eos> Let's just say... the Dockery money is not entirely kosher.<eos> We're supposed to report it if we get cash as collateral.<eos> It's not the kind of money that can be reported.
Where is it?<eos> I will not have dirty money in my house.<eos> It's not dirty money.<eos> It's my money.<eos> Who keeps that much money in a bag unless it's dirty money?
It's my money.<eos> Who keeps that much money in a bag unless it's dirty money?<eos> You have no right to go through my stuff!<eos> We have every right!<eos> Where did it come from?
I mean, in my experience, the bigger the lie, the harder it can be to dig out.<eos> I'll cross that bridge when I come to it.<eos> Hey, guys, think we're set with the lamps.<eos> Uh, could someone give me a hand with this phone? Gracias.<eos> It's open!
Oh, I'm fine.<eos> Thank you, Howard.<eos> Lunch is served.<eos> Swim, honey.<eos> Get it before it's soggy.
- Rose, Myrtle, Helen.<eos> That chair yoga really works, huh?<eos> You all look 10 years younger. Oh!<eos> - You honeydripper.<eos> - Hey, hurry up. It starts in five minutes.
Let's clear the table.<eos> Load it up.<eos> Locked and loaded.<eos> Here comes a new game.<eos> First number up... it's N-31.
You must.<eos> I'm senior captain of the River Vixens.<eos> Is cheerleading still a thing?<eos> Is being the Gay Best Friend still a thing?<eos> Some people say it's retro, I say it's eternal and iconic.
That doesn't make any sense, does it?<eos> You know, this is the most honest talk we've had in a while.<eos> And I'm glad that you want to do the right thing.<eos> I can see that. Even under the shiner.<eos> Archie, if you know it's the right thing to do, even though it's tough, even though it might... It might cost you. You gotta do it.
Yes, yes, we've all heard your tragic origin story.<eos> I'm so, so sorry, Ethel.<eos> That's horrible. Not as horrible as being a suspect in your own brother's torture-murder case, but we all have our crosses.<eos> In the meantime, River Vixen practice starts in five minutes, sluts, so...<eos> They're ruining our lives, and to them it's just a game.
Valerie's brother?<eos> - Hey, what's up?<eos> - Hey. He used to be on the football team.<eos> But I quit. When I saw Chuck's playbook.<eos> And I may know where it is.
I'll go to the car on the lost highway off of Route 40.<eos> Is that Jason's jacket?<eos> We need to get Sheriff Keller and then we need to get Polly.<eos> What makes a place feel like home?<eos> Is it warmth and familiarity?
I'll find you someplace safe, here in Riverdale.<eos> Please, Polly, I cannot lose you again.<eos> This is an upgrade from the tin can we used to work in.<eos> Wasn't sure you were gonna take me up on the offer.<eos> Wasn't sure it was real.
Please, Polly, I cannot lose you again.<eos> This is an upgrade from the tin can we used to work in.<eos> Wasn't sure you were gonna take me up on the offer.<eos> Wasn't sure it was real.<eos> I'm not gonna lie to you, it wasn't my idea.
Polly told them.<eos> So if they haven't been by yet, they will be.<eos> Did you ever talk to Jason?<eos> Personally? My guys gave him some product.<eos> When it wasn't delivered, we figured he'd took off with our stash, until...
Baby, I have just made a mess of things.<eos> Your father found out about Fred and me.<eos> Someone went to him before I got a chance to say anything...<eos> Oh, my God, Dad knows?<eos> Yes, and on top of that, the Blossoms are still after the drive-in land, and Fred still doesn't know that we own it.
It was the ultimate cliffhanger.<eos> Clifford Blossom had killed himself.<eos> But why? Life's not an Agatha Christie novel.<eos> It's a lot messier.
Riverdale must do better.<eos> We must do better.<eos> Fred.<eos> Have you given any more thought to my offer?<eos> Yes, it is a, uh, very generous offer.
Mother!<eos> White Horse Bar.<eos> Good afternoon, I was just wondering if a woman named Norma happened to be there last night.<eos> Yeah, she left her car in the parking lot all night.<eos> It's still here.
I... was just gonna call a cab.<eos> I have to go pick up my car.<eos> Where's your car?<eos> It... it was stolen.<eos> They just found it in a parking lot outside of a bar, but I... I need to go pick it up now.
Yes, I do, indeed.<eos> And if you need any recommendations for hikes or things to see, I'll be more than happy to help you.<eos> I'm gonna put you in room one.<eos> Room one?<eos> Yes, it's closer.
She's so weird.<eos> It's inappropriate.<eos> Yeah, she messed up.<eos> She crossed the line.<eos> And I will make a motion in court to suppress your confession on the grounds that it was made during duress and cognitive impairment.
"How long did it take you to write your book? "asked the sturdy, broad-shouldered young man.<eos> "To write it, three months.<eos> "To conceive it..."<eos> I certainly hope that's not the new novel.<eos> It's a fictionalized interview to promote "Paradise."
Welcome.<eos> Monty. It's good to see you, old man.<eos> Monty's chairman of Cottage Club, class of 70...<eos> I'm told your book was an overnight success.<eos> And it's all about this beloved institution.
Professor Gauss, I'm Zelda, Scott's wife.<eos> I'm so honored to meet you.<eos> The pleasure is all mine, my dear.<eos> Congratulations on your tremendous success with the book.<eos> Yes, I hear Hibben doesn't like it.
Jonah might be super into fashion.<eos> You don't know.<eos> Take down the photo, Lo.<eos> Why? What's the big deal?<eos> It's of you and my boyfriend.
- you two were still dating...<eos> - Uh, objection. She couldn't know if anybody might imagine that.<eos> - Um, sustained?<eos> - Withdrawn. One more thing.<eos> You took the photo, it was on your phone and you posted it to your account. Right?
- Uh, objection. She couldn't know if anybody might imagine that.<eos> - Um, sustained?<eos> - Withdrawn. One more thing.<eos> You took the photo, it was on your phone and you posted it to your account. Right?<eos> Yeah, it was a selfie.
- What? - Since when?<eos> Thank you, Miles, but I don't think we have to cancel the play.<eos> Yeah, but I said I didn't want to hurt anyone.<eos> I know.<eos> With a few small tweaks, I think we can make it suitable for a high school audience.
Yeah, it's not like you actually had an abortion.<eos> And that would be a reason to be ashamed?<eos> No, but... abortion's a big deal.<eos> I mean, you're kinda killing a baby.<eos> Well, I think, technically, it's an embryo.
Where are you three headed? Uh, to celebrate Lola's bravery.<eos> Did you save a cat from a tree?<eos> No, she shared the story of her abortion online.<eos> Franks!<eos> The whole point of the video was to own it.
What am I supposed to do, read her mind?<eos> You should read this book.<eos> I'm finding it very illuminating.<eos> Break-Up or Breakthrough?<eos> It's actually explaining why we have problems with our relationships. Dad.
I'm finding it very illuminating.<eos> Break-Up or Breakthrough?<eos> It's actually explaining why we have problems with our relationships. Dad.<eos> Mmm. A father we barely see.<eos> It suggests we use the CAT technique to build trust.
Thank God.<eos> I've been dying.<eos> Nolan managed to get Bram off the bus to the Factory and transferred into a labor camp.<eos> That's the good news?<eos> It's outside the walls, but not too far.
I've been dying.<eos> Nolan managed to get Bram off the bus to the Factory and transferred into a labor camp.<eos> That's the good news?<eos> It's outside the walls, but not too far.<eos> And it's not the Factory.
The middle class is evaporating?<eos> Or the American Dream is dead?<eos> You wouldn't be sitting there listening to me if the latter were true.<eos> You see, I think most people just have a fundamentally flawed view of money.<eos> Is it simply an agreed-upon unit of exchange for goods and services?
You see, I think most people just have a fundamentally flawed view of money.<eos> Is it simply an agreed-upon unit of exchange for goods and services?<eos> $3.70 for a gallon of milk?<eos> Thirty bucks to cut your grass?<eos> Or is it an intangible?
- I need a second opinion.<eos> Can you please tell Zig he looks hot in this outfit?<eos> I look ridiculous.<eos> Let the lady decide. I dunno.<eos> I think it kinda goes well with the black eye.
I've written short stories, too.<eos> Listen, I'm not raining on your parade.<eos> I, uh, just question if writing is enough to pay for convertibles<eos> - and iPhones and...<eos> - I know it's a hard career.
What's Hunter gonna say?<eos> Honestly, I don't know.<eos> What if he hates it?<eos> I'm more worried about what you think.<eos> ♪ Tell me, is it black or white? ♪
No, but I realized I gotta go easier on myself.<eos> Make my health a priority.<eos> The songs will come when they come.<eos> - What about your audition?<eos> - If it's meant to be, it'll happen.
I would have told him not to come.<eos> And he's here anyway.<eos> You don't have to believe him.<eos> Let him mine the dragonglass.<eos> If he's wrong, it's worthless.
You don't have to believe him.<eos> Let him mine the dragonglass.<eos> If he's wrong, it's worthless.<eos> You didn't even know it was here.<eos> It's nothing to you.
- I'm glad he didn't catch you.<eos> - Me too.<eos> Your father gave me this sword.<eos> Changed the pommel from a bear to a wolf.<eos> But it's still Longclaw.
Because I believe in you and the world you want to build.<eos> But the world you want to build doesn't get built all at once.<eos> Probably not in a single lifetime.<eos> How do we ensure your vision endures?<eos> After you break the wheel, how do we make sure it stays broken?
Based on what's happened before this time it feels different.<eos> Someone new could be behind it.<eos> - Is that the vaccine simulation? - Mm-hm.<eos> The infected are exhibiting different traits this time around.<eos> I'm attempting to suppress the artificial virus because it seems to be the base of the infection.
We're going to be so happy.<eos> On second thought I'm going to replace your arm with Sara's.<eos> Maybe that will change your mind about me.<eos> He's gonna use the trigger virus on New York?<eos> That's what it looks like.
He's not trying to turn a couple thousand.<eos> He's trying to turn them all.<eos> We need to take out those tankers.<eos> Professor Chambers' research says the virus can't handle heat.<eos> It's got the same flash point as gasoline.
You know I do.<eos> But, Robert, his singing voice?<eos> Flatter than West Texas.<eos> And even the most basic dance moves. Watching him was like...<eos> You know how when a baby horse is first born and it tries to get up and walk around for the first time?
I sleep with you and you let me.<eos> Look, those idiots are not coming back anytime soon.<eos> Oh, you don't know that.<eos> What if they realize they forgot to take my antique roll of Civil War authentic twine?<eos> I wouldn't worry, it's pretty cleverly disguised as garbage.
The gazelle seeks its daily nutritional needs...<eos> The zebras continue their daily trek along the savannah seeking out the rain's latest harvest.<eos> I'll come back tomorrow for my car.<eos> I'll take an Uber home and then another Uber here for my car.<eos> Just leave my car where it is.
Eat.<eos> So, they caught you going under the wall.<eos> What did you see there?<eos> Nothing.<eos> It was empty.
I shot a dummy!<eos> Are you carrying now?<eos> - Sol, pat her down.<eos> I only came back to find out if that repulsive implement of death is out of my house yet.<eos> It happens to be our house and no.
Are you carrying now?<eos> - Sol, pat her down.<eos> I only came back to find out if that repulsive implement of death is out of my house yet.<eos> It happens to be our house and no.<eos> You have to get rid of it!
Honestly, I wasn't scared.<eos> I was angry.<eos> I was hoping that this wouldn't be so complicated.<eos> I don't want the house.<eos> Dad left it to you.
You don't owe me information.<eos> I don't owe you information.<eos> This bed it terrible.<eos> It's fine.<eos> It's fine.
No, shared custody, Mr. Gutteman.<eos> I'm talking about shared custody.<eos> Ms. Leon, I think you're confused.<eos> Shared custody is not an option on the table at the moment.<eos> Well, maybe it should be.
- Yeah. Well, I wouldn't recommend it.<eos> It didn't end well.<eos> But you do whatever you have to do.<eos> Dying is not the answer.<eos> I know it feels like a good solution right now, but you want to live.
Where is it?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I drank my piss.<eos> Noah, come on, I brought you your breakfast this morning myself.<eos> Where is it? There.
I never wrote that.<eos> Yeah, you did.<eos> It's right here... on the page, clear as day.<eos> "Soon the thought was plaguing him constantly," even when he was awake.<eos> What if he accidentally tripped on her ventilator cord and it came out of the wall?
You love dogs?<eos> I seize any opportunity to add to my actor's toolbox.<eos> Should I have the opportunity to play a pet sitter in some future project, I know how they'll feel.<eos> That's a real dedication to your craft.<eos> It's my life.
Could I borrow that book for a couple of days?<eos> Well, this is the coffee table book.<eos> Well, you've already taken it off the coffee table.<eos> Yeah, you have a point.<eos> But it'll go back over there soon.
-Yeah.<eos> Elvin's a blues guitarist. Blues guitarist.<eos> His voice is very gravelly, and so, he wrote this song and didn't feel it was right for his voice.<eos> So he, uh... He let his, uh, backup singer, Mickey Thomas, sing the song.<eos> And it went on to be a big hit. Big hit.
Where is that?<eos> - Is Susan all right?<eos> - Answer the question.<eos> On the west side of the island, there is a boathouse.<eos> It's at a river mouth downstream from the village, but...
Why?<eos> Now.<eos> All satellite maps to the island are blurred, but Susan's compound is<eos> down here, boathouse, here, and the village is up here somewhere.<eos> They call it "Revival", but that's all I know.
There's a clinic across the camp with a red cross on the door.<eos> This is the key. Okay?<eos> Come on, let's go.<eos> I hid your treatment in the back of a fridge.<eos> It's ready. I'll find you and Charlotte.
You like it?<eos> Okay, upload it.<eos> Right.<eos> It will take a moment.<eos> It's running.
- That smell. You can't understand how wonderful it is.<eos> - I do.<eos> It's summer to me.<eos> Has been my whole life. - But you can't appreciate it until you've been away like I have.<eos> Someplace so cold and forbidding, so utterly devoid of life, you can't know how precious it is, how vulnerable.
And the tomato juice. And the hot sauce.<eos> - Yeah, we'll leave those out, too.<eos> - Then it's just vodka.<eos> That's all I really wanted.<eos> Did you really have heartburn last night or was it something else?
Well, that's the name of one of the more powerful texts on Battle Magic.<eos> "Last Hope Options." Yes, of course.<eos> Pixies love puzzles and riddles.<eos> Especially those that make humans look stupid.<eos> She gave me the title of the book that we're searching for, but I'm afraid that it will be very hard to find.
I know all about tough sells.<eos> That's why my car kite never took off.<eos> Is that a kite you fly out of your car?<eos> Patent pending.<eos> Don't try to steal it.
We're purple people.<eos> Okay, I love your product.<eos> I mean, I love your product.<eos> Yeah, everybody who tries it does.<eos> I think it could be really right for us.
Wow, that's a long way to go to stalk somebody.<eos> Right, like you're not weird as fuck.<eos> I'm gonna go pick an orange out of the punch.<eos> - That's your house?<eos> - Yeah. All 160 square feet of it.
Oh, them.<eos> Here.<eos> Well, thank you.<eos> Let's see.<eos> Uh-huh. Well, first off, the date is wrong, it's not July.
Here.<eos> Well, thank you.<eos> Let's see.<eos> Uh-huh. Well, first off, the date is wrong, it's not July.<eos> It is, in fact, July.
It is, in fact, July.<eos> Right, right.<eos> I was just testing you.<eos> Unless you were testing me.<eos> No, no, I know it's July.
I'm guessing a thong.<eos> All right, I'm shopping and then going straight to Robert's opening night.<eos> You're wearing your power cologne.<eos> It's over, lady. You're toast.<eos> Spill it.
My God, this is America, everybody takes pills.<eos> It's not just the pills.<eos> I was much happier not knowing.<eos> Now I'm going to wake up every morning thinking about spots on my brain.<eos> Every time I stumble over a word I'm going to think, "It's happening again!"
I've heard about you.<eos> So, you know I can make you tell me.<eos> And you know that knife that you're holding in your hand won't stop me asking.<eos> No.<eos> But it'll stop me from saying.
- You want me to look in a puddle? - Please.<eos> OK, I'm looking.<eos> - What am I looking at?<eos> - Your reflection.<eos> - Yep. There it is.
Because it gives her special powers? No!<eos> Because her face isn't symmetrical.<eos> Look!<eos> Look into the puddle.<eos> Your face looks wrong, because it looks right.
- A really posh kitchen, all metal.<eos> What happened with the doors, though?<eos> Did you run out of money?<eos> What you are standing in is a technological marvel.<eos> It is science beyond magic.
- A Dalek.<eos> - A what?<eos> - A Dalek.<eos> - What's a Dalek?<eos> - Never mind, it's a Dalek.
- Welcome back.<eos> I've been here before.<eos> Right. So I guess you don't need a tour.<eos> Where's my room?<eos> It's not like Daddy's place, honey.
- Here's the parking lot stuff.<eos> - There he goes.<eos> Stop it.<eos> Well, we got a plate.<eos> It's a little blurry.
Stop it.<eos> Well, we got a plate.<eos> It's a little blurry.<eos> - No, we can clear that.<eos> - Then run it, put out an APB.
You have no idea what this means to us.<eos> Actually, I do.<eos> I have a son.<eos> How did you find that monster?<eos> Honey, it's just a man.
And the heavier the sleeper, the more melatonin.<eos> An Alpen can sense that.<eos> It's like a drug addict - with a drug.<eos> - Why would an Alpe keep attacking the same victim?<eos> Because when the body's overcompensating, the brain produces even more melatonin when it's not sleeping.
Door locked.<eos> Window locked.<eos> Window locked.<eos> All right, so... this... is the room.<eos> Um, it is... it... I mean, palatial.
Do you mean about what you saw in them?<eos> I mean how do go through them.<eos> I don't think that's such a good idea.<eos> This skull thing tried to grab me and pull me into wherever it was.<eos> And it almost killed you.
I mean how do go through them.<eos> I don't think that's such a good idea.<eos> This skull thing tried to grab me and pull me into wherever it was.<eos> And it almost killed you.<eos> I think it will kill me if I don't do anything about it.
And it almost killed you.<eos> I think it will kill me if I don't do anything about it.<eos> So maybe you should stay away from it.<eos> Nick saw it too.<eos> What if it comes after him?
I think it will kill me if I don't do anything about it.<eos> So maybe you should stay away from it.<eos> Nick saw it too.<eos> What if it comes after him?<eos> I thought it went away when Nick saw it.
- Please.<eos> There might be something in them that could help us fight this thing.<eos> Those books could be just as dangerous.<eos> Waiting for this thing to come after me, or us, would be more dangerous, and Adaline,<eos> I think one of the reasons it is connecting to me is because I can see those symbols.
Mrs. Cutler was suffering from severe dementia.<eos> She was becoming restless in recent weeks.<eos> I changed her meds to try to make her more comfortable, but there's only so much we can do at a certain point.<eos> Has she ever exhibited any violent behavior?<eos> Aggressive behavior is not uncommon in later stages of Alzheimer's or dementia, and it can be very frustrating for caregivers.
- Close it!<eos> Close it!<eos> Diana, stop! Stop!<eos> Oh, my God, I think we're too late.<eos> Nick, it's opening!
Just try.<eos> We can't hide out here for the rest of our lives.<eos> We won't have to.<eos> This thing is gonna find us one way or another.<eos> And when it does I'm gonna kill it.
Do you know it?<eos> No.<eos> On a bad day, you can put it on and forget everything. Listen.<eos> There are better songs.<eos> But if it helps you forget your troubles...
It wasn't my decision to make. It was management's.<eos> So I hope you can carry out your task.<eos> The operator protocol.<eos> Learn it as if your life depended on it.<eos> I can assure you, it does.
-I think I lost it at Beltrán's house.<eos> -What?<eos> Maybe I dropped it there.<eos> It all happened so quickly.<eos> I know I had it in the car before I went in.
-What?<eos> Maybe I dropped it there.<eos> It all happened so quickly.<eos> I know I had it in the car before I went in.<eos> I searched the car, and it isn't there.
Francisco, I need your opinion here.<eos> You still haven't patented the rotary, and you've called the press.<eos> It's our invention.<eos> The patent is just bureaucracy.<eos> But it's necessary.
Debug my processor?<eos> Reboot my motherboard?<eos> - Please, I just need to update your vox in peace.<eos> - If I wanted my vox updated, I'd be talking to someone with a lot more experience than you.<eos> - Ms. paulsen, i know you know this but I will remind you for the 37th time-- that vox is our computer's operating system, and it needs to be updated once a quarter.
I promise you will get your interview, okay?<eos> - Okay.<eos> - Harvey, we have a problem.<eos> - What is it?<eos> - Of course it's about Mike.
- What about it?<eos> - Louis tried to lie to me.<eos> He said it was some sort of mix-up, but when I asked Donna about it, she told me that you were the one who went to see that man for me, not Louis.<eos> Look, Harvey, it's okay, you can tell me.<eos> It was about Mike, wasn't it?
- Louis tried to lie to me.<eos> He said it was some sort of mix-up, but when I asked Donna about it, she told me that you were the one who went to see that man for me, not Louis.<eos> Look, Harvey, it's okay, you can tell me.<eos> It was about Mike, wasn't it?<eos> - No, it was about leverage.
Not the family.<eos> I saw a symbol of the Rayburn family.<eos> And that's wrong.<eos> I don't want you all to try to hold on to it.<eos> Or all the sorrow that it's brought on.
Can't stop it.<eos> The water.<eos> It's gonna keep coming.<eos> And there's nothing we can do about it.<eos> - It takes whatever it wants.
It's gonna keep coming.<eos> And there's nothing we can do about it.<eos> - It takes whatever it wants.<eos> - What are you talking about?<eos> The sea, it takes everything.
You were going to sell the inn?<eos> - Did you know about this?<eos> - What does it matter now?<eos> They had experts here poking in every corner, measuring this and that.<eos> They said it's gonna be underwater in ten years.
- What does it matter now?<eos> They had experts here poking in every corner, measuring this and that.<eos> They said it's gonna be underwater in ten years.<eos> Maybe less.<eos> It's worthless.
- He agrees.<eos> Belle.<eos> I never wanted to hurt you or Rocky.<eos> I know that.<eos> Sometimes it feels like I just let life... just take me wherever it wanted.
If you like that sort of thing. I don't.<eos> Are we gonna have to listen to this one song over and over the whole drive?<eos> I'm just trying to figure it out.<eos> Tammy said "a walk to the peak" was god's favorite.<eos> It is kinda catchy.
Alarm bells will go off the second I pop in.<eos> I didn't go to school there.<eos> I mean, how am I supposed to find this book?<eos> "Best bitches"?<eos> It's the only one the bodega had.
It can happen lots of different ways.<eos> Well, this morning I was celebrating because I kind of... figured out life.<eos> Oh, yeah. So, is it dangerous?<eos> Nah, some live with them for years and never know they have them.<eos> But if tissue becomes strangulated, meaning the blood flow to it gets cut off, it could become necrotic, and that's potentially lethal.
Oh, my goodness.<eos> It's a 1940s debutante dream straight out of the window of Bonwit Teller.<eos> How'd I miss that? Oh!<eos> What I wouldn't give to keep this dress in a box, wrapped up in paper for the rest of eternity.<eos> It's so beautiful.
BRB!<eos> Gonna see if my hummingbirds came back.<eos> Made a homemade suet...<eos> First off, it's Nasty Gal.<eos> Second, this message board should be called David Lynch's Elephant Man, because it's full of freaks and sad as fuck.
This is some strong-ass shit.<eos> It tastes like the sun's piss.<eos> Holy shit.<eos> My life looks so different.<eos> It's pretty crazy.
No one knew you had to go.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> Sophia.<eos> - A watched pot never boils.<eos> - Well, I mean, eventually it'll boil.
On occasion.<eos> Then I want you to say the next time you think to pull something like this, you have the common courtesy to tell me before you do it.<eos> I suggest a warm bubble bath and a pint of Chunky Monkey.<eos> Because if you're not good to yourself, how can you expect anyone else to be good to you?<eos> And for your information, the initial program was vanilla bean and an Enya CD, but it learned from you.
I suggest a warm bubble bath and a pint of Chunky Monkey.<eos> Because if you're not good to yourself, how can you expect anyone else to be good to you?<eos> And for your information, the initial program was vanilla bean and an Enya CD, but it learned from you.<eos> Pretty awesome, right?<eos> No, Benjamin, it's not pretty awesome.
And I wanted to come have a little chat with you before you got it into your head that you could go behind my back and cut a deal without an admission of guilt.<eos> - What?<eos> - Look, I don't give a shit how much you offered, you're not gonna buy your way out of this thing without telling the world what you did.<eos> I don't think you understand what the word settlement means.<eos> I understand what it means to you, I just don't give a shit.
I was asking what it was like to work with Zane, not Kaldor.<eos> Rachel, I'm serious.<eos> I learned a lot about your father while I was there and I'm telling you, it was all good.<eos> What about his temper?<eos> Well, maybe it wasn't all good.
I have the element of surprise.<eos> No one expects a tiny realtor lady to jump on their back and rip out their throat.<eos> Besides, there's something I enjoy about the kill.<eos> - Really?<eos> - Yeah. It's like a rush.
You puked up a lot of fluids.<eos> Here.<eos> Take your time.<eos> There you go.<eos> I'd bring you the phone but it's mounted to the wall.
Yeah, there's a little spur line there off the 11.<eos> Lise.<eos> Lise.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Curry's phone went out in the middle of nowhere and there it sat for five hours until it died.
She had it in her hand, Aida...<eos> in her hand!<eos> She just couldn't get out with it.<eos> Your previous model had the Darkhold book in her hand.<eos> And all the answers it holds.
She just couldn't get out with it.<eos> Your previous model had the Darkhold book in her hand.<eos> And all the answers it holds.<eos> I've only glimpsed it, but it opened my eyes to possibilities beyond my wildest imaginings.<eos> It can show us how... how to live forever.
And, uh, hopefully, he takes my advice and lays low for a while.<eos> It's for the best.<eos> Yeah, absolutely...<eos> Even though the program did show promise.<eos> Well, promising or not, it was a mistake.
Keep the title, but when it comes to operations,<eos> I'm calling the shots.<eos> We were so close.<eos> Your previous model had the Darkhold book in her hand.<eos> And all the answers it holds.
Once I've studied it, I-I'd be able to determine... No.<eos> No.<eos> No one's touching it.<eos> When this is over, I'm destroying the book myself.<eos> Because it's dangerous, yeah.
Okay.<eos> Aida, I want you to access your information cache.<eos> Locate the sunset protocol.<eos> I have it, doctor.<eos> Activate it.
- So what's running him?<eos> You ... you ... you telling me thing is a... alive?<eos> - Fitz, please. Stop.<eos> - No, of course not.<eos> All I'm saying is it has a brain.
I think it's time The Superior sends some men of his own.<eos> Anton Ivanov, a reclusive industrialist<eos> - with a submarine. - Bingo.<eos> You said you wanted to destroy the Inhumans and the thing that brought them upon us.<eos> - What is it? - A man.
I believe so.<eos> I've lived here for many years.<eos> Great!<eos> But that ... that book ... you really shouldn't... touch that.<eos> - It's ... It's dangerous, powerful.
- I'm aware.<eos> - I read it while you were sleeping.<eos> - You did what?<eos> ! I specifically said it was mine to examine, decipher ...<eos> You said it would help me find a solution ... - to eliminate the Inhuman problem.
Agent Simmons?<eos> It's not good news, I'm afraid.<eos> The serum that's been giving you your strength... it... is...<eos> potentially lethal.<eos> So you're saying it's...
It's not good news, I'm afraid.<eos> The serum that's been giving you your strength... it... is...<eos> potentially lethal.<eos> So you're saying it's...<eos> I'm saying it's Russian roulette.
So he left me.<eos> - Ran, really.<eos> - What is it?<eos> Glioblastoma multiforme.<eos> I know, it's boring.
I'm closing the door he opened... allowing alien races to infect our world and convincing men like you to protect them.<eos> And I will make you admit, to me and yourself, that this is true.<eos> - I'm searching fragments of code across all lines of communication.<eos> Now, it was going slow at first, but once I found the right fragment...<eos> Ah, there it is.
All of these things you've done, all of the energy spent, the hatred.<eos> And you know what the funny thing about it is?<eos> I have no idea who the hell you are. I've been on hundreds of missions in my time.<eos> This one you're so upset about, I was sent to retrieve an object.<eos> If I'm being honest, I don't even remember what it was.
Yeah. Maybe we could ask someone who wasn't on the op...<eos> Agent Fitz.<eos> Yes, coulson, sir.<eos> We haven't been able to locate the submarine on satellite.<eos> In your best estimation, do you think it has missile-launch capabilities?
Aida... sort of killed me, as well. What?<eos> !<eos> How did she go against her programming?<eos> She found a loophole.<eos> I mean, it was really rather clever.
On my mark.<eos> I was so certain.<eos> I guess this isn't where she's building the damn thing.<eos> No, this is where she's building it, just not in this world.<eos> And now I know what it will do.
What do we do with Fitz?<eos> What do the two of you remember of your Framework lives?<eos> As much as I remember about this life.<eos> - The only difference is, I know...<eos> - It wasn't real.
No.<eos> Not a dream, Simmons.<eos> A life.<eos> But this is you, right?<eos> I mean... Does it feel... As real as...
Can you take me to mack?<eos> I fear you're too late.<eos> Look.<eos> Aida's shutting down the framework.<eos> It's collapsing on itself.
Hear me out, general.<eos> We offer a solution, a path to putting S.H.I.E.L.D.<eos> And their inhumans away once and for all.<eos> This book opened my eyes to the truth about inhumans.<eos> It contains a plan to defeat them, and you can all be a part of it.
Make yourself at home.<eos> Orhan, Sony. I haven't introduced you.<eos> Ömer, my husband.<eos> I came across your book a year ago... Thanks to Deniz.<eos> And I really liked it.
If you don't want to talk, suits me.<eos> Or I could tell you what day Katie Pine was killed.<eos> I was thinking about it last night.<eos> The coroner said the petechial hemorrhaging was preserved because the tissue was frozen but we know from the melt water that it was above zero when Katie was dumped.<eos> So it must have snapped cold soon after within three days or the tissue would have degraded.
You will bear children for them.<eos> Welcome to the friggin' loony bin.<eos> Blessed are the meek, dear.<eos> What'd they do to her?<eos> "If my right eye offends thee, pluck it out."
Blue Oyster Cult.<eos> Blue Monday.<eos> Our car was that color.<eos> We bought it off Craigslist.<eos> It smelled like maple syrup.
It smelled like maple syrup.<eos> Luke said it was a leak in the radiator, it was probably bad for kids.<eos> After we got it fixed, I missed that smell.<eos> And so did Hannah.<eos> She said it smelled like Saturdays.
They can't just do this.<eos> They can't.<eos> They can.<eos> We've been under martial law since D. C.<eos> Yeah, but that was about preventing another attack. And it was about, you know, capturing terrorists.
You just might as well keep drinking, 'cause if we're not having fun, what the hell are we doing here? Yes!<eos> Copy that.<eos> Svetlana...<eos> You know this office isn't gonna pack itself up, right?<eos> It's not packed because one of us has been at work for the last three hours.
What is it now?<eos> Take a look.<eos> Where'd you get this?<eos> It doesn't matter where I got it.<eos> It's out there.
An Aunt escaped last night, from the Needham Red Center.<eos> Well, the Eyes will catch her.<eos> She crossed the border.<eos> Gave an interview to the Toronto Star.<eos> It's already up on their website.
You're a decent guitar player, not great.<eos> So... you take a few classes in hotel management.<eos> Try improv. But your object work is never what you want it to be.<eos> What's... What's object work?<eos> It's like making a fucking sandwich, only it's not really there.
- Hey, Rick!<eos> - Hey, Joel. Can you pop your trunk for me?<eos> Those are words you never wanna hear from a cop. [chuckles]<eos> Come on, I want to check the cargo space.<eos> See, I love my bike, but the only thing it holds is ass.
Zero to 60 in one-point-fuck seconds.<eos> - [chuckles] Hi, honey!<eos> Where'd you go this morning?<eos> What's in the bag?<eos> Is it a present? Is it for me?
- Honey, it happened. I heard from him.<eos> - Heard from who?<eos> That guy Anton with the medieval Serbian book that might have a cure for... Whoa.<eos> Your eye is a little wonky there.<eos> Ever since I shoved it back in, it occasionally drifts.
- Okay. Happy about that.<eos> Less happy about being called a horror show.<eos> Ooh, wait, right there.<eos> Yeah, yeah.<eos> - Okay, now press it until you hear a pop.
The last time I was there, I saw a baby wearing an outfit that said,<eos> "My parents fucked nine months ago and all I got was this lousy T-shirt."<eos> Fact:<eos> liquor is the best and least suspicious way to get someone to throw up.<eos> Fact: I hate when you do the fact thing, especially when it's not a fact.
Because I wanted to give someone the chance to take it off the market.<eos> And it needed to be someone with the confidence to call his mother "Mommy."<eos> It's typical you would have us meet you here.<eos> Gambling's for suckers, you know?<eos> It's only gambling when the results are unknown.
Then trust when they make me the offer, I'm gonna act outraged, tell them we'll never do business with them, and they'll give us an extra 5% right there.<eos> - So what'd you think?<eos> - I thought it was impressive.<eos> Then I think you're easily impressed.<eos> - You didn't like it? - I liked it just fine.
For once, we're not gonna have to worry about making rent. Yeah.<eos> Right.<eos> That's not a joke.<eos> Wait, you're telling me that $50,000 can really make that big a difference to the clinic?<eos> I'm telling you that I know in corporate law, money doesn't matter unless it's in the millions, but... here, $50,000 makes all the difference in the world.
I know, and then they said they would fight us to the ends of the earth.<eos> So I pulled out every trick in the book.<eos> And I got them to make you an offer.<eos> An offer sounds like a buyout.<eos> That's because it is a buyout.
Because of this.<eos> It's a picture of Shannon at her cousin's wedding.<eos> They sent it to me along with her denied claim.<eos> Please tell me this picture is over five years old.<eos> It was taken eight months ago.
I think, after you see this, you're gonna wanna save every nickel you have.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Now, correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe that's a memo between Acumen senior management and their sales force outlining their policy of doing whatever it takes to avoid paying claims.<eos> Well, this thing can be interpreted a dozen different ways.<eos> It doesn't prove a thing. But it proves that we're not just talking about my client anymore.
It'll be okay.<eos> We're gonna look out for each other.<eos> Mayday.<eos> Luke told me once where the term came from.<eos> It's French.
I need to be romanced.<eos> Let us pray.<eos> Maybe some flowers.<eos> You could write me a poem.<eos> It doesn't have to rhyme.
Do you remember the sublet we had in Sommerville?<eos> This is bigger.<eos> It is.<eos> Yeah, this is much bigger.<eos> It's a lot bigger.
Tell them to get lost.<eos> You got money over?<eos> We did.<eos> I barnstormed it through in my neck pillow.<eos> Yeah. It's not in there.
We need to make an alibi.<eos> I'm working on it with Ed.<eos> She has...<eos> The detective has a photograph of me, too.<eos> Yeah, it's six hours later here.
Actually, I'm in the middle of a...<eos> Listen, I think I might have made a mistake.<eos> I offered Catherine money not to have the baby.<eos> Oh, Jesus.<eos> I want the baby to be happy, so I thought the best way to do that would be for it to not be born.
- Yeah, just...<eos> - Are YOU OK?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I'm just lying in the back of Melissa's car.<eos> It's a bit smelly.
- Are YOU OK?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I'm just lying in the back of Melissa's car.<eos> It's a bit smelly.<eos> It's not as smelly as our car, but it smells like lemon grass and burger meat.
Now, go show 'em how it's done, birthday girl.<eos> I suck!<eos> Oh, baby, you don't suck.<eos> Can I show you how to keep your wrist straight?<eos> It's working, right?
Piscatella's gonna take care of it.<eos> Piscatella's not taking care of anything.<eos> He's never stepping foot in my prison again.<eos> This doesn't look like your prison anymore, does it, Boss?<eos> Not that it ever was.
See, all we gotta do is, we gotta light a fire, right?<eos> And then, when they open the door to let us out, we... we pounce.<eos> And what makes you think they'd let us out?<eos> Burning is an ugly way to go.<eos> It'd be better in here 'cause at least we'd suffocate.
And for little Sunny, it is a rattle.<eos> - It makes a little noise.<eos> Do you like them?<eos> It's very generous of you, Aunt Josephine.<eos> Well, I know my home isn't the warmest place, but if you follow the rules, it will be a safe one.
It'll be good to have something hot for a change.<eos> I just wanted to get a warm cardigan that's flattering to my figure.<eos> You're going on a date?<eos> Don't be vulgar, Violet.<eos> It is not a date, necessarily.
Oh, Captain! Oh, Captain!<eos> I'm hobbling as fast as I can, Josephine.<eos> Well, good evening, children.<eos> My name is Captain Sham, and my home is the sea.<eos> No, it isn't.
Perhaps we should sail this fragile and flammable world together.<eos> - Sail?<eos> - Yes, I'm a sailboat rental agent.<eos> Is that anything like a real estate agent?<eos> It's actually quite similar.
It's actually quite similar.<eos> Absolutely not.<eos> See? I have my own business card.<eos> "Captain Sham's Sailboats.<eos> Every boat has it's own sail."
Oh, Captain, you have made a serious grammatical error here.<eos> What?<eos> This card says "it's," I-T-apostrophe-S.<eos> That always means "it is."<eos> You don't mean to say "Every boat has it is own sail."
I'll work on that ladder.<eos> ? I, I, I ?<eos> ? I love the sea ?<eos> ? The reason I'm a sailor 'cause ?<eos> ? It's the only way to be ?
? I love the sea ?<eos> ? The reason I'm a sailor 'cause ?<eos> ? It's the only way to be ?<eos> ? The reason I'm a sailor 'cause ?<eos> ? It's the only way to be ?
- Monarch.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> What does that have to do with your book?<eos> Absolutely nothing, but what can I do?<eos> It's your book, your empire.
Break through it, damn it.<eos> What's taking so long?<eos> Guys, move it.<eos> Faster!<eos> It's not budging!
I cannot expose him.<eos> This protein you're working on.<eos> NR...<eos> NLRP2.<eos> Do you really think it'll help people have babies again?
Maybe this is why your team loses so often.<eos> - Pardon the interruption... - Excellent timing, Gideon.<eos> Your daughter Lily's algorithm has identified a location for another piece of the Spear.<eos> Well, when it rains, it pours.<eos> Where is it, Gideon?
Ugh, pity.<eos> Basically, your king now does anything I want him to do, so if you don't him to spill your blood all over this floor,<eos> I suggest that you hand over your fragment of the Spear.<eos> My patience is running short.<eos> The fragment... where is it?
How can your team protect the Spear?<eos> You couldn't even protect Dr. Mid-Nite.<eos> - I'm not going anywhere, and neither is the fragment.<eos> Fascinating.<eos> It seems to contain some sort of sophisticated receiver.
- No idea.<eos> - Whoa, wait, what?<eos> Well, I've seen it done, had it done, never taken a trip myself.<eos> Given that you're entering his subconscious,<eos> I suspect it will look like someplace familiar to our old Captain.
Don't call me that.<eos> Would you prefer it in the human tongue, wife?<eos> I am no longer bonded to you.<eos> The nest has been cold these 300 years without you.<eos> It was always cold.
We have to start treating Lena Luthor like a hostile.<eos> The evidence is too overwhelming.<eos> Winn? If you watch that video, I know you'll find something. I did.<eos> It's...<eos> It's clean.
Lucky for you, I have some tape for that.<eos> Come on, I'll help you put it on.<eos> See how nice everyone is, once you leave the city.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> You said it was broken?
No!<eos> - No!<eos> No!<eos> - The painting.<eos> Where is it?
Yes. It seems to be another one-off incident.<eos> It's under control.<eos> - Is that why you called?<eos> - No, actually. I called to get an update on the Daxamite ship.<eos> At the moment it seems to be in low orbit.
I almost forgot. I want to give you elevator access, so you can come up to this floor without an escort.<eos> Security just needs your thumbprint and they'll issue a badge.<eos> Is that good?<eos> I was looking through your designs and there's a small problem.<eos> It requires an element that doesn't exist on Earth.
I want us to work together to create a transmatter portal.<eos> We have them where I come from.<eos> L-Corp has already built a large-scale generator ring.<eos> We can easily adapt it for this.<eos> The portal would help your planet immensely and it would help me get home to mine.
Come on! Go, go, go!<eos> Go! Get out of here!<eos> Come on, go!<eos> The building is coming down!<eos> It's working.
Previously on Supergirl...<eos> To new friends!<eos> The portal would help your planet immensely and it would help me get home to mine.
A child learns how to walk.<eos> They sing. A group of people come down from a hike from the mountains and they, they dance.<eos> And a couple, they go on their first date and they throw a damn festival!<eos> And all of a sudden, the secret to happiness just dawned on me.<eos> It's human connection.
..of upper juniors.<eos> That book must be fascinating.<eos> What are you reading?<eos> Pinochet's autobiography?<eos> Christ! It's not an autobiography, it's a biography.
- Don't we, Anthony?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Of course. We all do.<eos> So, you want to put the house on the market, yeah? Yeah.<eos> So, I'd say is worth a fair amount now, isn't it, our house?
We painted it, it's all Dulux Heritage colours now, isn't it? - Oh, yeah.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> We bought it about two and a half years ago, so I'd say its value is...<eos> Yeah, I got you a great price for that, I remember.<eos> But, um, right now I'd say it's not going to be worth a lot more than what you paid for it.
Yeah.<eos> I'm not going to do that.<eos> - You don't want kids? - No, no, I do.<eos> I mean, biologically and psychologically, I want to be a dad.<eos> Frankie made Rob a paper boat the other day, and I mean, it was shitty, it sank, but I'd like a little person to make me a boat.
Yeah, all they have to do is put them to bed and then just sit there.<eos> She doesn't just sit there.<eos> You know when we went to see Jason Bourne? When we got back the living room smelt of sex.<eos> No, it didn't.<eos> Well, it at least smelt of solo sex.
Managed to get him in the door before the barfing started.<eos> But he's fine now.<eos> You cleaned up.<eos> It's done.<eos> It was nothing.
If this isn't something that you want, you need to say so.<eos> It is.<eos> I ran the numbers twice.<eos> The money Cardinal used to buy chips is straight from the bank.<eos> It doesn't come from Corbett.
You're grasping, Detective.<eos> How do you know about Catherine?<eos> How do you even know her name?<eos> Cardinal wouldn't expose his home life to you.<eos> Well, he must have let it slip.
But, of course, we both know that executive privilege could've negated your having to appear at one of those shops.<eos> Jim?<eos> I'm going to help you with your slag heap.<eos> I hope that means that I can count on you.<eos> Of course that's what it means.
A little bit?<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> What's this book about anyway? What...<eos> What are the structural dynamics of flow?<eos> It studies the difficulty in moving an element from A to B.
I'm gonna be a daddy?<eos> You're going to be a great dad.<eos> But not here.<eos> Look, baby, wherever we go, our baby's gonna be a part of my bloodline.<eos> And it won't be at peace if it's not connected to its heritage.
For my unborn kid.<eos> So... I start looking for forms of magic that you can't defend against.<eos> Can't find anything.<eos> And then, one night, I walk into my house and I find tnotebook just sittingn my table.<eos> It's an instruction manual.
Dad. I don't feel so good.<eos> Look, guys. I know what we're up against.<eos> There's a faction of our own people, witches.<eos> They've started to make human sacrifices to a spirit called the Hollow.<eos> Now, this thing is dark, it's angry, it's very powerful.
And I was able to shut it out, but a lot of people have a harder time doing that.<eos> Like your wife.<eos> You know, there's a difference between what we project and what we have inside of our hearts, what we try to hide inside of our hearts, right?<eos> Now that thing, it took everything that's dark and twisted inside of me and it used it against me.<eos> It used it again my wife and it ended up taking everything that I've ever loved away from me.
It used it again my wife and it ended up taking everything that I've ever loved away from me.<eos> So, then, you have every reason<eos> - to want to remove it from this earth.<eos> - Yeah. But let's say that we run into that thing today, Elijah.<eos> It's gonna take everything that you want to keep buried, it's going to use that and make you do exactly what it wants you to do.
Invite me here, confront me?<eos> Whatever this thing promised you,<eos> - it's not gonna deliver.<eos> - You're wrong. The Hollow rewards those who are loyal.<eos> Maybe if you did what it asked you to do, things might be different.
Okay, they're alive.<eos> These kids are linked to that ritual.<eos> We can't free Marcel and Klaus unless we break the spell.<eos> How do we stop this?<eos> I don't know! It's a sacrificial ritual.
It means the Hollow.<eos> The Hollow is coming.<eos> The Hollow wants power.<eos> The kind that only comes from sacrifice.<eos> This thing is dark, it's angry, it's very powerful.
The kind that only comes from sacrifice.<eos> This thing is dark, it's angry, it's very powerful.<eos> Everything that you want to keep buried... it's going to use that and make you do exactly what it wants you to do.<eos> They wanted us here. They want to channel your power and anchor the Hollow to the living world.<eos> It will feed... and it will rise.

The Ancestral Realm.<eos> When Vincent blew the link, he must've set it free.<eos> How do we get this thing off Marcel?<eos> Purification could work.<eos> Unless it comes back.
There has to be a way to save him. Freya, you still have the antidote we used to cure Marcel's bite?<eos> I have it, yes.<eos> But I don't know if it'll work against the poison of the rosebush.<eos> You guys aren't listening, okay? Even if we do cure Elijah, we still have a big problem, that's called the Hollow.<eos> And it's just gonna keep coming at us until it resurrects.
I assure you, it's not gonna kill her. It's just gonna drop the Hollow's spirit out of her.<eos> Then I'll sacrifice Klaus and put the Hollow away for good.<eos> All right, I got it.<eos> You think you got it.<eos> This thing stole Elijah's blade, which means not only is it wearing your girlfriend's face, but it's got the weapon that can kill you.
I'm just looking for Freya.<eos> What do you need of her?<eos> Just a favor.<eos> This thing has been haunting the city for a very long time.<eos> And before today, the only thing I knew about it was that it was a spirit practicing very dark magic, and it was trying desperately to get back into this world.
Hope.<eos> You see, it's precisely because of her that I have to assert my involvement.<eos> Let me help. Tell me what you know.<eos> This thing wants to be reborn.<eos> This morning, Vincent said that whenever it resurfaces, it does so in four distinct locations. I can't tell why.

Tell me what you know.<eos> This thing wants to be reborn.<eos> This morning, Vincent said that whenever it resurfaces, it does so in four distinct locations. I can't tell why.<eos> It's looking for something.
Once your spirit's free, I can use Klaus to cast a spell to imprison her for good.<eos> Remember, Hayley, this won't work if you don't trust me.<eos> You know what to do.<eos> Marcel.<eos> Tierra, of course, means land. As in all the hearts will defend it.
- Yeah.<eos> She is a B and E magician.<eos> Don't put down anything around her that you're fond of.<eos> Hey. Why do I buy you a phone if you don't answer it?<eos> It's charging.
Fuck.<eos> Let me ask you this, John. Would you like to have a breakfast?<eos> In my room, say? The Electress of Saxony?<eos> Breakfast is the meal where...<eos> Well, it's the optimistic meal, John.
She's not a bad mom, I'm guessing; I'm guessing she's just a good cop.<eos> What does she have on you?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Her daughter drew a picture of me.<eos> It's pretty good.
You're an awesome tutor.<eos> When the Vikings invaded, they used to pull their longboats out of the water, turn them upside down and live in them as houses until they'd pillaged and looted enough to build new ones.<eos> So?<eos> You didn't see a space ship outside, did you?<eos> When the settlers first landed, they must have lived in it and built out from it, so it's still here, somewhere inside this building.
- Why?<eos> Those pods, what's in them?<eos> - I got it wrong.<eos> I got it very, very wrong.<eos> The colony ship isn't on the way, it's right here.
No more than I do, sir.<eos> Yes, but you're someone who knows more than he tells.<eos> Well, I'm not one to speculate...<eos> But you can't help it because you're a man of intelligence.<eos> They won't let us smoke in here, so I assume it's fuel.
You know how I feel about marriage.<eos> I've been clear on this since college.<eos> Most people have that opinion in college and then they grow out of it.<eos> Stop trying to make me you, okay?<eos> I've chosen this life and I like it!
I think it could be really empowering for her to sort through all those really confusing and scary emotions and turn them into something good.<eos> And, look, I know that a lot of people say that theater is a dead art form performed by the rich for the even richer, and...<eos> I guess I do agree with that to some extent, but...<eos> I still really believe in it.<eos> I think it has the power to transform lives.

Okay.<eos> Um, as was mentioned five seconds earlier, I'm Tasha and I'm going to teach you an improv game called, "Yes, And..."<eos> Has anybody ever heard of "Yes, And..." before?<eos> Perfect!<eos> Okay, well, it is super simple.
"You're so right. That cat video was cute and funny."<eos> That's amazing.<eos> You're like a genius or something.<eos> - You don't think it's awful?<eos> - No, I think it's trash.
Tell me about one of your plays.<eos> Nah, let's just change the subject.<eos> I don't...<eos> I thought theater was all you cared about.<eos> - It is.
Well, yeah.<eos> Sure.<eos> Cool.<eos> Because your mom already told me I could stay for dinner.<eos> And so far, it smells dope!
She is very different to anyone that I would ordinarily be friends with because she's very quiet and very introverted and isn't incredibly emotional or expressive.<eos> She's just really steady, and I think I'm gonna value that hugely on the boat.<eos> You can tell with Emma she just loves rowing.<eos> She's just so happy as soon as she gets onto the oars.<eos> [Emma] It's one of those sports that when you start it you kind of get hooked because it's more than just the actual exercise bit.

It's amazing.<eos> Don't even have, like, an engine to ruin that for us.<eos> Is it me or does it feel like we're standing still?<eos> I now realize why people love rowing.<eos> It is so soothing.
Don't try to stop us.<eos> Nobody's stopping you.<eos> She doesn't have to point that thing at us.<eos> I think it's just her finger.<eos> No, it's not.
Well, tell her it's cancelled.<eos> Dude, she jabbering' like The Exorcist.<eos> I don't want to get puked on.<eos> Well, I can't play Mama right now.<eos> You see a problem, you deal with it.
I work hard all day.<eos> I want to come home to somebody who... takes care of themselves.<eos> Is that so much to ask? Okay, so I'm your new project now?<eos> Go back to your little craft fair.<eos> It's not a craft fair. It's a memorial installation.
We ain't done yet.<eos> But I'm dehydrated.<eos> Tough shit.<eos> Shouldn't drink all that hooch.<eos> Now I want you to punch this face like it's the person you're most angry at.
If something was gonna happen between us, it would've happened by now. Don't you think?<eos> I'm into Claire. I thought you knew that.<eos> I like Diaz and all, but we can't all go down for what she did.<eos> You can't pull the lever.<eos> You got to let fate take its course, or it comes back to haunt you.
Plus, that shit was dark.<eos> You girls have been busy.<eos> So, now, tell me, was this murder also part of your nonviolent protest?<eos> The murder ain't the point.<eos> The point is our education program ain't never been no education program, even before it was put on hold for some alleged murder.
Bottom?<eos> Yeah. It's from A Midsummer Night's Dream.<eos> I didn't know it either, but I... I looked it up.<eos> It feels like it's there, but then it's not there.<eos> My grandpa lost part of his right leg in Vietnam, and he totally felt like it was still there, too.
Oh, no good.<eos> No good.<eos> But don't worry.<eos> Your face is under there.<eos> Oh! And it's beautiful.
It really is about getting up in the morning, looking in that mirror and sayin', "Self, you're great."<eos> That, and a little bit of lipstick, that is all the medicine you need!<eos> Go on, get out of here.<eos> Go on!<eos> What if your self still has a headache, even after you tell it, "You're great"?
Yo, you was killin' it in there!<eos> I know.<eos> That's why this better be motherfuckin' important.<eos> Look, we got a... a little problem.<eos> Great, it's a little problem. Little means you can handle it.
- With what, exactly?<eos> - Uh, lithium.<eos> Look, I read somewhere it's good for... for crazy.<eos> Are you kidding me?<eos> You don't even know what it does.
- No, come on, get one.<eos> Another one, where, you know, in a place where people can see it this time.<eos> It's not... My tattoo is not for me.<eos> It's...<eos> It's for other people.
Well, if there's one thing our people understand, it's rationing.<eos> Besides, once we close those doors, it'll be one meal a day for the next 5 years.<eos> Try one meal every other day.<eos> Hunting parties are coming back with less and less.<eos> Thanks to your friend Niylah, we're preserving more meat than ever, but it's still not enough.
Do what you want. I've got a ship to seal.<eos> I'll drive.<eos> The end is coming.<eos> Hear me as I say it this time.<eos> The end is coming, and it's coming soon.
That's good.<eos> That's good. Mmm.<eos> I would like to thank the American people for their overwhelming support tonight.<eos> As your next president, I do not take this mandate lightly.<eos> In fact... it is heavy as hell.
But I won't walk away after the election.<eos> I want complete oversight of all relevant departments, including the CA.<eos> And no one can see that footage.<eos> Anything else?<eos> It's amazing.
It was your Uncle Jimmy's.<eos> A house.<eos> Jimmy owned a house in the city?<eos> You know he worked for me sometimes.<eos> It's yours now.
Jyra!<eos> That's enough!<eos> I am so sorry for your little girl.<eos> Let her be now, Koen.<eos> Is it alive?
You can't order me to do anything.<eos> I think you better leave.<eos> Tell me.<eos> Ebola was no match for the subject's blood.<eos> It's destroying every disease known to man.
But I used to watch them whenever I got the chance.<eos> She had long, curly hair.<eos> She was wearing the most beautiful dress.<eos> That dress was the whitest thing you've ever seen.<eos> And it had a blue ribbon wrapped around her like a belt.
Come with me.<eos> You happy crashing with this mob?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I saw your son at the warehouse.<eos> The blue light thing coming from his chest, smashing through steel like it was nothing.
My DNA comes up as positive for subhuman.<eos> Why is that?<eos> My darling, we're having a baby, just like we dreamed of.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> It's gonna be the healthiest child that's ever been born.
You did this to your wife!<eos> So that we can raise our child together.<eos> We can be an example to those that come after.<eos> When were you gonna tell me?<eos> - What, after it was born?
They appear to have been... stunned only.<eos> Are you suggesting it's not dangerous?<eos> Not at all.<eos> I'm just gathering as much information as I can.<eos> If you can't tell me what it is, what it wants, how we can deter it?
Killing more people won't change anything.<eos> We fight now.<eos> We fight for sovereignty.<eos> That won't get you anything but bloodshed.<eos> When has this land ever not had bloodshed on it?
There's an audition.<eos> I'm not running it.<eos> They're looking for unconventional women, whatever the hell that means, and I thought of you.<eos> I'll have my girl follow up with the details.<eos> It's not porn.
Hair pulling?<eos> - You don't like wrestling?<eos> - Well, I don't really know wrestling.<eos> You don't think wrestling is acting?<eos> It's not, is it?
- Well, I don't really know wrestling.<eos> You don't think wrestling is acting?<eos> It's not, is it?<eos> It's...<eos> It's more like a sport with costumes?
- What's Wendy's job? Getting groceries.<eos> If you don't like your jobs, you're free to go find a real job and help out the family.<eos> - How long are we here?<eos> - Is your cartel after us?<eos> It is not my cartel, and no one is after us, pal.
Okay. You know, if... if you do, you can just ask.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Charlotte won't even call us Mom and Dad.<eos> I've never hated the sound of my own name more.<eos> You should've seen her when I told her I couldn't get that ice cream. It was like Medusa.
The IRS won't let you buy anything of value with it.<eos> So you better get that money into the banking system.<eos> But here's the problem.<eos> That dirty money is too clean.<eos> Looks like it just came out of a bank vault.
Looks like it just came out of a bank vault.<eos> You gotta age it up.<eos> Crumple it. Drag it through the dirt.<eos> Run it over with your car.<eos> Anything to make it look like it's been around the block.
That mixture goes from an American bank... to a bank from any country that doesn't have to listen to the IRS.<eos> It then goes into a standard checking account... and voilÃ.<eos> All you need is access to one of over three million terminals, because your work is done.<eos> Your money's clean.<eos> It's as legitimate as anybody else's.
She's a fucking thief.<eos> Hello?<eos> How's my money, Marty?<eos> Um, it's good.<eos> Uh, it's better than expected.
Um, it's good.<eos> Uh, it's better than expected.<eos> It's starting to move.<eos> I haven't even seen a million yet.<eos> So when you say "It's starting to move,"
Hey.<eos> I was just out on the lake,<eos> - and there is this property and...<eos> - Um, listen, Wendy.<eos> It's half-built, it's stalled and it's for sale.
I've been trying to tell you since yesterday about that half-built house on Sunrise Beach.<eos> What about it?<eos> Well, I used the money from the Chicago house and I bought it.<eos> Now, I'm no expert, but I'm pretty sure you can inflate construction costs and launder money through it.<eos> And quite frankly, I don't give a shit if you like it or not.
Well, I used the money from the Chicago house and I bought it.<eos> Now, I'm no expert, but I'm pretty sure you can inflate construction costs and launder money through it.<eos> And quite frankly, I don't give a shit if you like it or not.<eos> 'Cause I feel pretty good about it.<eos> It's a good idea, and I did it for our family.
Who the hell is that on the pole?<eos> We needed to class the joint up if we ever wanna make any money.<eos> - And this was Marty's idea?<eos> - Mm-mm. Mine.<eos> I looked at our inventory and I felt that it was lacking.
We'd be stuck.<eos> So?<eos> I mean, we'd need... we'd need capital.<eos> It'd cost a lot up front.<eos> No. It doesn't have to be a big place.
I'm pissed off, too.<eos> Well, what exactly is the issue?<eos> - The specific issue?<eos> Yeah, it's a...<eos> - Exactly. Boy, it's complicated.
You...<eos> I'm just a fucking accountant.<eos> You're not just an accountant.<eos> - Scotty, did you get my prescription?<eos> - Yeah, it's on top of the microwave.
Search your soul, Martin.<eos> You'll know.<eos> Jesus Christ.<eos> Life is simple, really.<eos> It's all about hard work.
Yeah, he's the guy that saved our asses.<eos> More than once.<eos> He financed your whole campaign, and you didn't have any problem with that a few months ago.<eos> He's saving my business.<eos> Roy's the reason that my life is... Is pretty much the best it's ever really been, John.
I ran back for him, and he was...<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Did you see what it was?<eos> And the radio?<eos> It wasn't working.
Why would you kill us when you know we're all gonna die soon, anyway?<eos> We're not here to kill you, Clarke.<eos> We're here to take your ship, a ship you restored to save your people, not mine.<eos> That ship is a backup plan.<eos> It'll hold 100 people tops.
We are tapped out.<eos> We are doing men's work.<eos> Is it fair?<eos> My heart doesn't beat anymore.<eos> It's wasting away day by day.
And, Rob, this is your wedding rehearsal.<eos> You could at least wear a jacket.<eos> - It is a jacket.<eos> - It's a sweater.<eos> Well, it's kind of like a jacketed sweater.
I'll be right back.<eos> Aw, baby...<eos> Baby, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.<eos> I just grabbed the first thing I could find.<eos> It just needs to be taken out in the back, just a little bit.
Oh, goody.<eos> Heroin.<eos> I always suspected this was how I'd go.<eos> Potassium chloride will shut down the heart.<eos> Adrenaline will kick-start it.
It's the biggest story of the day. Doesn't mean it's well written.<eos> Otherwise, great job.<eos> Love the picture, Peter.<eos> Who, what, when, where, why and how.<eos> You got two out of six. And it's superficial.

Did you get any orders?<eos> I noticed that the car park was still full of Mercedes G-Class.<eos> - I saw that. - Listen.<eos> I could put this into an auction, one of those posh, up-market ones, and it would sell for ã120.000.<eos> It would not!
Basically you do your number ones up there. Operate the pumps. They send the results up, across, and into the water purification system.<eos> It emerges from that as purest drinking water.<eos> Food. I'm gonna need it.<eos> I've got a chicken.<eos> It lays eggs. They go in there.
Oh! That's my own urine!<eos> - Are you two doing this?<eos> - Yes, he is!<eos> I'd get out of the way if I were you.<eos> The trouble with the chicken is, it moves around, making this a...
Let's get on now and see what's what.<eos> Now, for this to be a proper Alfa Romeo, there must be... something wrong with it.<eos> Think about it. A person who's kind to his mother and punctual and sober and well-dressed, he's an Audi.<eos> And nobody wants a friend like that.<eos> If you're going to form a relationship with a car, if you're gonna develop a bond, it's got to have human qualities.

Yeah, but honestly, Jeremy, that doesn't mean anything.<eos> If Alfa Romeo launched a dog turd, you'd say it was brilliant.<eos> It is! I'm not making it up!<eos> You heard it. You saw it.<eos> It's a fantastic car.
And with that... with that you get four-wheel-drive.<eos> So that one will work in the wet, will it?<eos> Hammond, when somebody has a baby, OK, do you go up to it and... "Look at my new baby that I've...<eos> Eurgh! It's really ugly!"<eos> Well, only if it's ugly.
One day, BBC documentary, wheel arch.<eos> Yeah, from just four cars.<eos> That's all we had. Four cars. That's all you need for a reef.<eos> Right, here's the boat we've selected.<eos> It's a little bit damaged.
And then we had to secure it in place.<eos> I don't understand ratchet straps. Er...<eos> There's water coming into the boat.<eos> - No, there was some in when I bought it.<eos> - It's leaking.
Firing up the machine!<eos> Sadly, though, Jeremy's turn of speed only made things worse.<eos> Power! Power!<eos> Come on! Slow down!<eos> It's falling apart!
It's a Series II.<eos> - That makes it a Series II?<eos> - Yeah. I thought Series Ils had the lights angled.<eos> I think we're getting stuck on this.<eos> - It's a Land Rover.
In truth, all great environmental projects are beset with problems.<eos> And ours, through no fault of our own, except James's, was no exception.<eos> Save it! Stop!<eos> So, in the end, our new reef wasn't quite as spectacular as we'd hoped.<eos> But it was a start, and one day it'll be the core of something a thousand miles long...
What about that car makes it for women?<eos> Well, they said it had a smaller-than-usual steering wheel - and a more reliable engine.<eos> - Oh, yeah, of course, because men don't want a reliable engine, do they? - It's only women!<eos> - I hate reliable engines.<eos> Also, you can drive it standing up, which is what women did in the 1920s.
- Exactly. - Right. Now...<eos> You know Tesla? Tesla believes it's pioneering the electric car.<eos> There was a Scottish company back in the '60s which made an electric car.<eos> I've got a picture of it here.<eos> Oh, god! It's called the scamp. It had a top speed of 35mph, a range of 20 miles.
- Zagato spyder.<eos> All biturbos.<eos> I think this was designed when it was owned by citroen, which was bankrupt at the time.<eos> Then there was some guy in America who had a bit of Maserati. And then the Italian government, or fiat, they all sort of had bits of it.<eos> They ran around going, "we made a new car. Look." It was exactly the same, it just had a new name.
He was brilliant.<eos> That is the problem.<eos> That is the problem, but, Hammond, i have a solution. Ok?<eos> No, don't scoff. Don't scoff.<eos> This is a system that is cheap, works anywhere in the world, and you can fit it to any car, no matter how old it is.
Let's not get bogged down with "ooh, can't speak French."<eos> Let's get to the point which is, James may, you lost and you broke the company yacht.<eos> - You did.<eos> - Hang on a minute. My car got closer to england than yours did.<eos> Yes, but the other thing it got closest to was the bottom of the sea.

My car got closer to england than yours did.<eos> Yes, but the other thing it got closest to was the bottom of the sea.<eos> All of that is irrelevant because my car was the best, cos it didn't go wrong at all.
All of that is irrelevant because my car was the best, cos it didn't go wrong at all.<eos> Mine was perfectly reliable. Mm-hm.<eos> Mine was as reliable as James's arms.<eos> And the extraordinary thing is, no-one can work out what was wrong with it.<eos> It fell off the back of a lorry.
Seats don't massage you as you drive along, it can't park itself. Erm...<eos> But you do get a DVD player.<eos> And how 1996 is that?<eos> This car, then, is sparsely equipped and annoying.<eos> However, it's also rather good.
- Yes.<eos> - I'm attached to it, I mean.<eos> That's what I mean.<eos> One would hope so, yeah. You wouldn't want to see somebody else having fun with it.<eos> - No, it's mine!
We're not that stupid.<eos> Just as if you leave the gate unlocked at the lion closure at a safari park, we don't all run in and have a picnic.<eos> In the last 15 years, Britain's economy has grown by 58%, whereas Germany's has grown by 102%.<eos> And that's because we're all doing 20 miles an hour and they're doing 200.<eos> Speed is good for business, and it saves lives as well.
I got this from one of those survivalist types.<eos> I wanted a family car, but Toby thought it was so cool.<eos> Guy said he bought it because it was a bugout vehicle, you know, so old it didn't have a circuit board, in case aliens or whatever came and fried our technology.<eos> I... I don't know anymore.<eos> I just know it's one of the only ones that works.
A forest ranger I knew years ago told me about a mother brown bear who gave birth to three cubs.<eos> The rangers stayed nearby to keep an eye on them and make sure the cubs were safe from other predators, but they were shocked when the mother killed the first two cubs.<eos> They intervened and took the last baby, a male.<eos> Why did it do that?<eos> Well, while they were caring for the cub, they discovered that it was suffering from fever and infection.

I didn't know about Praimfaya.<eos> You can tell them that.<eos> I never meant to hurt anyone.<eos> The sword doesn't care what you meant.<eos> It just cuts.
Jenny doesn't need us.<eos> Really?<eos> Alex, the Catholics who founded Maryland thought that this cave was home to the Sicarius Spei.<eos> The slayer of hope.<eos> All right, this thing is the living embodiment of despair, and it doesn't just kill its victims.

I'm trying!<eos> It's too strong.<eos> Plus, I don't think it's normal webbing.<eos> I think it's nerves of some kind.<eos> Whatever that thing is, it's gonna come back soon.
America, North America, Earth.<eos> Geoff wants to know what it's like out there.<eos> Chaos.<eos> Ruin.<eos> And it changes you.
I mean, it's not too shabby at night either.<eos> Mm, but this, in the morning, just feels right.<eos> This does feel right.<eos> And the crazy thing is, I don't even have the urge to reach for my phone.<eos> I don't even know where it is. And I don't care.
Barbecuing is something that black people and white people have always done.<eos> Barbecuing used to be something you did just for fun.<eos> Now it is something people can make a business out of.<eos> [in Afrikaans] I found this place and cleaned it up by myself.<eos> Before me, it was a dump.
Inside it is like a roast.<eos> Then we leave it, for about a month.<eos> During that time, the raw wood above almost completely dries out.<eos> The raw wood is inherently flammable, of course.<eos> So when it reaches a certain temperature, the heat breaks it down and it turns to carbon.
I'd like to see salmon patties on there, but no one's done that yet.<eos> Nah, just bacon, eggs, snags.<eos> Just your basic shit.<eos> That's what a barbecue is.<eos> It's not like putting a hangi down, where you've got to spend hours and hours.
It brings people together.<eos> All right?<eos> Well, that's, that's my opinion.<eos> [man speaking in Mongolian] Countryside living generally is really nice.<eos> Maybe because it's our ancestral land.
[cheering and applause] [in Spanish] It is a spiritual environment for each of us, where different conversations are held.<eos> The asado calls us and reunites us.<eos> I believe that is the thing, the essence of the Uruguayan asado.<eos> For all Uruguayans, the theme of the asado is the same.<eos> From a very young age, let's say from when you're a baby, you're already experiencing asados, because it's a tradition from many years ago, from our ancestors.
You can only live on the coupons you receive from the United Nations.<eos> You have to find another income.<eos> Most of the people living in the camp have to create one.<eos> This restaurant is considered... one of the first in the camp.<eos> It was the first shawarma and falafel restaurant.
I learned it in Syria, at a restaurant I worked in for seven years.<eos> I established my life when I came here. I organized my life.<eos> I never thought I'd have work here.<eos> Or that I could continue my trade here, my life here.<eos> For sure, it has lots of spices, too many to name.
And that's where there'll be a fire box at one end of the cooking pit and a chimney at the other.<eos> And so the chimney pulls the heat and the smoke over the meat.<eos> We work hard, we play hard.<eos> We do everything in a very big way and barbecue is another one of those things.<eos> It's very big. It makes a statement. It's bold.
Texans are just that way.<eos> To my way of thinking, hands on cooking is... my way to fly.<eos> You have to drink the Kool-Aid to do this.<eos> There's just no other way around it.<eos> It's a difficult job, it's a harder life.
[man speaking in English] Our method is real basic, a very simple seasoning and a lot of tender loving care in the cooking process.<eos> You know, Ms. Tootsie's been doing this for, you know, 40 plus years.<eos> A lot of what we do is based off of what she's done for many years.<eos> [Ms. Tootsie] Well, just here in Central Texas, I mean, that's all we know is barbecue.<eos> Long and slow is the secret, I think to brisket 'cause it is a tough cut of meat.

And I don't care what they tell you in Washington D.C. Because no man sitting behind the desk in the Oval Office in 2016 has given us that right.<eos> It is those brave men and women that have raised their right hand.<eos> They've sworn to defend the Constitution of the United States of America, against all enemies, foreign and domestic...<eos> When Edgar and I took over the restaurant, we had a sign up.<eos> At one side, it said "Colored Only," and then the other was for whites.
It seems to be etched into our DNA.<eos> We all gravitate to it in a way that is very predictable.<eos> There's fire, there's meat, there's people gathering around.<eos> Everyone understands barbecue, everyone feels that this is just a part of their life.<eos> It's inseparable. Such as air and water.
We all gravitate to it in a way that is very predictable.<eos> There's fire, there's meat, there's people gathering around.<eos> Everyone understands barbecue, everyone feels that this is just a part of their life.<eos> It's inseparable. Such as air and water.<eos> It's that much of a common fabric in the life of Texans.
Fire is an essential part of it.<eos> [woman speaking in Spanish] This business I inherited, comes from my grandfather.<eos> He taught me from when I was young.<eos> Then I started helping him out.<eos> It is a family business, a family affair.
[in English] It wouldn't fit on this fella's towball, because he had a bigger towball.<eos> And it wouldn't fit over.<eos> [in Maori] The rule of the hāngi once it is in the ground is, if everything is all good, and your hāngi is in the ground, the only thing left is to have good thoughts,<eos> to have good thoughts, to say good things, not to say any bad words in or around the hāngi.<eos> To encourage laughter, so that it generates a good spirit and a good feeling which I believe positively affects the outcome of the hāngi.
You were just making sure those bodies stayed buried, huh?<eos> They better stay buried.<eos> You're a guest here, son.<eos> Get right with the past or get off my land.<eos> It's their land.
- What's your book say about it?<eos> Your little Ladder book.<eos> Yeah, I did my research.<eos> What's your book got to say about what's happening in America?<eos> - It was written in the '70s, so...
- Yes.<eos> - What, he's mine, or he could be mine?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> That's the truth.<eos> But it could be yours.
The king fears a coup.<eos> He wants the rebels' names and the date of the coup.<eos> You can count on having our collaboration and service.<eos> Nothing, no trace of the money.<eos> [man] Beltrán said it should be here.
I don't need anyone's permission to do what I do with my life.<eos> Doña Lola?<eos> Oh, God, I called her a tart.<eos> Really, that's not me.<eos> It was the anisette.
What is that?<eos> That structure, there?<eos> It is a place for prayer, Lord.<eos> A church, Uhtred?<eos> Not quite, Lord. It is a shack, with a cross attached.
That structure, there?<eos> It is a place for prayer, Lord.<eos> A church, Uhtred?<eos> Not quite, Lord. It is a shack, with a cross attached.<eos> If it is for the purpose of prayer, then it is a church.
She is my wife.<eos> Aethelred, they're teasing you.<eos> Perhaps we can begin with a cup of ale?<eos> It's a long walk from the river.<eos> A cup of ale it is, Lord Uhtred.
You have my word, priest.<eos> If all your men fight like this, Alfred will have no trouble throwing you out of Lunden.<eos> Put down your sword.<eos> Thank you, lord.<eos> It was a bit on the heavy side.
Please.<eos> You gotta help us.<eos> Hurry!<eos> There's fresh water.<eos> God, it burns.
I mean, I'm not sure I could let a white man colonize my body, and I never thought Sam would either.<eos> So do you feel personally betrayed?<eos> No.<eos> I mean, it's complicated.<eos> I know the heart wants what it wants, and we're all one and all that shit, but... how many times we've had the narrative that black men aren't good enough and that we need a white savior?
I won't allow my blood to kill any more innocent people.<eos> Luna, please.<eos> Your blood is the one thing that can save us.<eos> My blood is a curse.<eos> It will, however, keep you from following me into the rain.
Look. The center.<eos> Still think it's a coincidence?<eos> Where did you get this?<eos> Oh, I found it.<eos> And I now believe it's so it could lead me to you.
Where did you get this?<eos> Oh, I found it.<eos> And I now believe it's so it could lead me to you.<eos> Tell us about the symbol.<eos> Where does it come from?
Oh, I found it.<eos> And I now believe it's so it could lead me to you.<eos> Tell us about the symbol.<eos> Where does it come from?<eos> It's the holy symbol of our order.
Mother.<eos> Gaia, please.<eos> Skaikru helped you protect the Flame.<eos> Help us now.<eos> It adorns the crypt of the first Commander,
Bullet went straight through, no lasting damage.<eos> How the hell does this happen?<eos> Just relax, all right?<eos> We need to wash our hands of this right now, before it gets back to us.<eos> Peter, blood doesn't wash out, it stains, which is why we keep moving forward.
I got a job offer, too.<eos> Don't tell me.<eos> They want you to chair the department.<eos> No.<eos> It was from the president.
It was an honest mistake.<eos> Hell, it wasn't even a mistake.<eos> I mean, you know I agree with you.<eos> So, what's the problem?<eos> Is it the timing?
That's funny.<eos> Nobody's reached out to me.<eos> Well, he's reaching out now.<eos> I want to remind you, this bill is not about taking guns away from people.<eos> It's about making sure they don't fall into the wrong hands in the first place.
No dice.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> The plate's from a White House pool of vehicles.<eos> You're sure?<eos> That's what it says.
What do you mean?<eos> The plate's from a White House pool of vehicles.<eos> You're sure?<eos> That's what it says.<eos> I need to get a name. Hundreds of people work there. Any one of them could have accessed it.
She delivered on her promise with the gun bill, so we feel the President should deliver on his.<eos> President didn't promise the Speaker anything more than gratitude.<eos> What, are you kidding me? No.<eos> If the bill passes...<eos> When it passes.
President didn't promise the Speaker anything more than gratitude.<eos> What, are you kidding me? No.<eos> If the bill passes...<eos> When it passes.<eos> If it passes, then the White House will definitely owe the Speaker a debt.
There's a series of vehicles heading to the property with the silo.<eos> Whatever the hell they're doing, they're definitely doing it out there.<eos> What's with the book?<eos> Well, there's no author and no copyright.<eos> It's obviously self-published, but listen to this.
So far, we've identified cells in Montana, Arizona,<eos> Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and New Mexico.<eos> Now, the FBI's Joint Terrorism Task Force on Domestic Threats is moving teams into position so we can coordinate the raids, not tip them off.<eos> You know, I read their "manifesto."<eos> It was ridiculous.
My favorite president is Franklin Roosevelt.<eos> I wanted to show you something.<eos> When do you think this picture was taken?<eos> I expect during the war.<eos> Any idea when it was published?
Lloyd and his followers believed that American greatness was in its decline and that somehow, we were no longer heirs to the generations that pushed back the tide of fascism, put men on the moon, and relegated the Berlin Wall to the pages of history.<eos> In short, these people believed that our best days were behind us and that they, themselves, knew better how to remake our country.<eos> They were wrong... in every possible way.<eos> They debased the American Dream and disrespected the incredible sacrifices made by so many to build and sustain our nation.<eos> And even though the fabric of America may have been frayed by their violence and hatred, I stand here rejoicing in the fact that it was never torn.
After that, when they're off doing...<eos> You want to leave Bea?<eos> She's been like a sister to us.<eos> Did you see her face?<eos> She liked it.
Laying around in your cozy bed, while time is running out for the two of us.<eos> What is it, huh?<eos> You interrupted our game.<eos> You're a loser, just like Case.<eos> Pity it had to come to such a bad end.
I'm back, Dave.<eos> And I'm feeling like my old self again.<eos> Now, listen close and I'll tell you where you're gonna find her.<eos> *CRIMINAL MINDS* Season 12 Episode 09 "Profiling 202" Precisely Synchronized by srjanapala<eos> What matters this is to be expecting evil... "Before it comes?"
We think it's because he gave us his exact location, he had to move fast because he knew we were coming.<eos> She had defensive wounds.<eos> Yes.<eos> The M.E. Believes that she tried to fight back at some point, probably when he first grabbed her.<eos> She also had someone else's blood on her, enough to run a sample through CODIS and we were able to confirm that it belongs to Yates.
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold on.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> There wasn't room in the limo, and I don't have a car.<eos> Also, may I say that script was your best work since Blood Disco?<eos> It has the surrealist quality of your early works like Oedipussy, Venus in Chains, Gina the Machina, but with a more subversive message about the limitations of feminism and nuclear power.
And in wrestling, that is the foundation upon which we need to build.<eos> - But I'm Indian, not Arab.<eos> - I'm Cambodian.<eos> Backstory. Wrestling is not about backstory.<eos> It's about type.
I just don't understand how they, um, stand up like that.<eos> Well, they like attention.<eos> The only other boobs I've seen in person are my brother Tommy's.<eos> I've actually never lived with girls before, so, I'll probably stare sometimes, 'cause you're basically just like an alien from another planet.<eos> Well, every night before bed, I put lotion all over my body, because it is scientifically proven to be the only thing that stops aging in its tracks.
I had a baby six months ago.<eos> My hips are still in the wrong place, every time Cherry makes us jump rope, I leak a little, but, you know, I'm here.<eos> It's not the workouts.<eos> The problem is you think wrestling is stupid.<eos> Well, it is stupid.
John, I'd like to embrace you and send you a non-verbal message to you saying "I get you, I know how you feel."<eos> You're just human.<eos> Hello, Club Member."<eos> That's what cuddling's about.<eos> I think you could use it.
That's what cuddling's about.<eos> I think you could use it.<eos> How does it work?<eos> You just come together.<eos> It's the easiest thing in the world.
- Yes.<eos> - Are you able to eat what you want to eat?<eos> Well, uh...<eos> They sometimes bring us airline food and they sometimes bring us, uh, Lebanese food,<eos> - and it's different, but it's delicious.
My identity is here.<eos> The time when I could slip away and be someone else is long since past.<eos> I have a good life.<eos> I have a wonderful, fairy-tale life.<eos> It does come with certain restrictions.
(YELLING) Fire!<eos> Fire! (VOICE ECHOING) Fire!<eos> Fire!<eos> - (OVER PA) Fire! Fire!<eos> - Where am I? If you're in a town where the workers have been warned never to talk about a terrible fire, not because it was too terrible...
Hey, boss. He's on his way.<eos> - He... - (PHONE CUTS OFF)<eos> He's on his way.<eos> In the book The Great Gatsby, there's a famous sign shaped like a pair of eyeglasses.<eos> Does it represent an optometrist?
(WHISPERS) We have to get out of here.<eos> A dictionary.<eos> But why are you showing this to me?<eos> You can't read.<eos> The quote that Sunny found scrawled on the inside cover has been said by many of my associates over the years. It goes...
Matthew's been terrible set on it.<eos> Well, I hope and pray it works all right.<eos> Only, don't say I didn't warn you if he burns Green Gables down or puts strychnine in the well.<eos> I heard of a case over in New Brunswick where an orphan-asylum child did just that, and the whole family died in fearful agonies.<eos> Only, it was a girl in that instance.
Wouldn't it be lovely to be a blossom?<eos> Yesterday, you wanted to be a seagull.<eos> And the power and the glory forever. Amen.<eos> I like this prayer.<eos> It's lovely.
Although it can't be denied your hair is terrible red.<eos> But there may be hope for it.<eos> There was a girl in our class who had hair every bit as red as yours.<eos> Do you recall, Marilla?<eos> But when she grew up, it darkened to a real handsome auburn.
Be thankful knowing your banishment will be short.<eos> Praimfaya awaits.<eos> The water's cold enough.<eos> Your pulse is already dangerously slow.<eos> Tell me again how you're gonna drop the electrical current to restart your heart once it stops.
-I just...<eos> I can't believe you don't want to have a child so bad that you would sabotage it.<eos> -You think I broke it on purpose?<eos> -Yeah.<eos> -I didn't break it on purpose.
I'm thinking, "Thank God it's a black guy,"<eos> meaning, "Thank God that ego that is in him..."<eos> When that thing floated down from the heavens, or the cosmos, whatever the hell Joel Osteen shit you believe...<eos> All right?<eos> When that thing was floating down, it could have landed in anybody.

When that thing floated down from the heavens, or the cosmos, whatever the hell Joel Osteen shit you believe...<eos> All right?<eos> When that thing was floating down, it could have landed in anybody.<eos> Thank God... it landed in a black guy.<eos> Thank God it got wrapped up in that, trapped within that.
All right?<eos> When that thing was floating down, it could have landed in anybody.<eos> Thank God... it landed in a black guy.<eos> Thank God it got wrapped up in that, trapped within that.<eos> It's safe in there.
It's just all pure evil.<eos> There's no, like, teenage boy-band years, like...<eos> You google a picture of Adolf as a baby.<eos> You look at that thing, you're like, "Dude, drown that fucking thing!<eos> Drown it! Take it down to the river, stick it under a rock.
You google a picture of Adolf as a baby.<eos> You look at that thing, you're like, "Dude, drown that fucking thing!<eos> Drown it! Take it down to the river, stick it under a rock.<eos> If you don't do it, I'm gonna fucking do it.<eos> I swear to God, it's looking at me.
What's wrong with you?"<eos> "Is there something that I need to know?<eos> So the lady's sitting there, she's like,<eos> "Well...<eos> Well, the... the kitty cat... it got hit by a car... and it's fucking dead."
"You knew before I knew."<eos> I don't have an ending for this.<eos> I don't.<eos> And in a weird way, now you know how I felt.. When I watched that video.<eos> You know what it was? You know what it was?
I did that joke all around the country, all right, and the gorilla always died, 'cause Jesus wanted it that way... and that was it.<eos> And it fucking bombed in every goddamn city in this country except for Dallas, Texas.<eos> That was the only place where they got it.<eos> And I'm not shitting on Texas.<eos> It bombed in Houston, Austin,
Enough about them.<eos> They have a share for us, too.<eos> - Is that your memoirs?<eos> - Yes. I finished my book.<eos> It's a story about my sestras.
I call it, Orphan Black.<eos> Boy, that's weird.<eos> What is...<eos> It's cool. 'Cause we are all orphans, right?<eos> Yeah, that's what it is.
Light's pretty much our favorite metaphor around here.<eos> But light isn't just a figure of speech we Meyerists happen to like.<eos> It's a material thing.<eos> A necessity, light is what we rely upon to move through the world.<eos> Without it, we lose our bearings. And we can even lose our minds.
- You...<eos> Are you trying to find dirt on me so you can trade it at the salon? I mean... - No.<eos> - What?<eos> - Absolutely not, Eddie, no.<eos> - What is it then?
That's why I'm asking you right now, all of you, to reach into your pockets and give.<eos> Give deeply.<eos> Consider... Consider how little that money means to you.<eos> It's another status handbag, some obscenely expensive bottle of wine you buy and show off at a dinner party.<eos> To the people we're helping, it could mean the difference between life and death. - All right.
What else did he say?<eos> Just that he misses you.<eos> I don't have a lot of time today, but... would you... wanna get breakfast with me or something?<eos> Yeah, I'd love to.<eos> It's a cute place.
That's why they get up in the morning...<eos> To go mano-a-monomyth with the darkness.<eos> To win the elixir and save the world.<eos> Because villainy is real.<eos> It has guns and scars and tattoos, and it's licensed to drive.
To go mano-a-monomyth with the darkness.<eos> To win the elixir and save the world.<eos> Because villainy is real.<eos> It has guns and scars and tattoos, and it's licensed to drive.<eos> It wants nothing but to murder and take. And it's coming for them all.
That's a coincidence.<eos> Yeah.<eos> - Hop in, man. I'll give you a ride.<eos> - No. I'm on my bike.<eos> It's around the corner.
You know that if you had possessed the Flaming Sword, the weapon that guarded Eden, the weapon that can cut through anything, even the Gates of Heaven itself, well, you would've won that rebellion.<eos> Why are you dwelling in the past?<eos> The fact is, I didn't have the sword, and Dad destroyed it soon after, so...<eos> What if I told you that the sword was right here, on Earth?<eos> And it's already in your possession. What?
Lucifer. Does someone want to tell me what the hell is going on?<eos> Get me out of these damn things.<eos> "The piece is here."<eos> Well, what do you know.<eos> It fits perfectly.
Well, what do you know.<eos> It fits perfectly.<eos> Yes, I think this is what Uriel was trying to tell me.<eos> Just before he died, he whispered in my ear, "The piece is here."<eos> I mean, I thought it was nonsense, but... this must be why the sword wasn't working.
- It sounds worth our time, actually.<eos> Agreed.<eos> Why didn't you just lead with that?<eos> The lock's damaged.<eos> Is it?
I like you.<eos> You guys, it's a record label.<eos> The symbol on the phone we found is the label's logo.<eos> And they choose to publish this music of their own free will?<eos> It's a vanity label.
You guys, it's a record label.<eos> The symbol on the phone we found is the label's logo.<eos> And they choose to publish this music of their own free will?<eos> It's a vanity label.<eos> It exists only to make this one guy's music.
The symbol on the phone we found is the label's logo.<eos> And they choose to publish this music of their own free will?<eos> It's a vanity label.<eos> It exists only to make this one guy's music.<eos> Okay, well, who owns it?
I... - I love you more.<eos> Dan.<eos> Hey.<eos> Look, that phone...<eos> I think it is way more important than we thought.
Dan.<eos> Hey.<eos> Look, that phone...<eos> I think it is way more important than we thought.<eos> It might be the key to taking down Bianca.
This phone could be the key to taking down the entire Ruiz empire.<eos> Yeah, but how do we crack it if cyber couldn't even do it?<eos> Time.<eos> That idiot didn't install a program that can remotely wipe the phone.<eos> And it's an older phone with just a fourdigit code.
Is this a joke?<eos> Well, if it were, I would have chosen something funnier, like Douglas Adams or Freud.<eos> Are you certain... that this is all that was in the safety deposit box?<eos> Well, how is a book supposed to ignite the sword?<eos> Maybe it's an instruction manual.
- Yeah, it's a word.<eos> If that's a word, it is fucking stupid, and you should never use it.<eos> Although, I mean, this whole thing is fucking stupid.<eos> So why shouldn't you make up your own vocabulary.<eos> - It's not stupid. - Off.
- So, this is happening.<eos> - Hey, you.<eos> Come in.<eos> The water's warm.<eos> - It's so warm.
And, sorry, but I'm gonna wear whatever the fuck I want.<eos> - Is that the jacket?<eos> It's lovely. Can I...<eos> Yeah.<eos> It's pretty great.
Come on in.<eos> It's, uh...<eos> You don't need an invitation.<eos> Did you really have a date?<eos> It wasn't a date.
Oh, my.<eos> They're saying we're finally gonna have a grandchild.<eos> Is that right?<eos> Is that true?<eos> - It'll really be Emma's baby?
So, just be a gentleman and spread your legs.<eos> That sounds like more than a six, I'll be honest.<eos> All right, it might be a nine.<eos> Another life, you know?<eos> Yeah, maybe it's happening right now. Yeah.
I would like to explain.<eos> Mer, I have surgery.<eos> I got to go.<eos> You should feel a cold sensation right now.<eos> It might burn a little, but only for a moment.
You keep your face low and stay as far away from the fire as you can.<eos> I can't!<eos> I... I can't.<eos> I can't.<eos> My leg... it's stuck.
I'm coming.<eos> Don't panic.<eos> - Oh, God, just... - Ow!<eos> Ow! Move it off, please!<eos> No, no, honey, it's keeping all the blood in your leg.
This is gonna sound insane.<eos> No, trust me.<eos> It won't.<eos> They knew me.<eos> They said it was for Ricky Gustavo.
Thank you.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I wanted to thank you, Link.<eos> I want to thank you for your sacrifice.<eos> I want you to know it will not be in vain.
And if I don't continue to try, I have no reason to be alive.<eos> More violence, Father?<eos> Do you know what a trial by ordeal is?<eos> Tell me.<eos> It is a test of life and death, where the proof of innocence is survival.
Let him go.<eos> We don't have to do this.<eos> What else is there to do than to fight the evil?<eos> What else is there in life?<eos> It's in you.
We don't have to do this.<eos> What else is there to do than to fight the evil?<eos> What else is there in life?<eos> It's in you.<eos> It's really in you.
(quietly): Arabic...<eos> Arabic...<eos> I know that symbol.<eos> I've seen one just like that in the Histories.<eos> JAKE: Where is it?
Okay, well, we have access to all of the maintenance systems, right, including ventilation.<eos> Right. I thought of that, but the building switches to a self-contained air supply.<eos> All the outside vents are closed.<eos> Well, what if tell the system that the air supply has been used up?<eos> Then it would have to switch into backup mode and vent air from the outside.
Presumably, that's where we'll find the last piece.<eos> Intense.<eos> Of course.<eos> What?<eos> Where is it?
You were going to cheat out of your deal by cheating death itself.<eos> If I never die, I never have to lose my soul.<eos> George Washington hid the Philosopher's Stone pieces on the strongest ley line intersection.<eos> That's where we'll find the last piece.<eos> Where is it?
If we can procure the final piece of the Talisman first, we'll thwart his plan.<eos> Can this thing really make him immortal?<eos> Its transmutative power is unmatched.<eos> It has but one limitation:<eos> It cannot create something from nothing.
Tap, close your eyes.<eos> Got something.<eos> The signal's... strong, but it's erratic.<eos> - Okay. - Whoa.<eos> Feels like it's... close, but it's...
Got something.<eos> The signal's... strong, but it's erratic.<eos> - Okay. - Whoa.<eos> Feels like it's... close, but it's...<eos> It's yanking me all over the place.
Some kind of ancient archer.<eos> The Talisman must be right below us in this crypt.<eos> But we can't get down there with that thing taking potshots at us.<eos> We must have woke it by poking around with the Scepter.<eos> If it's some kind of guardian, it won't follow us if we retreat.
- Good.<eos> Go!<eos> I only caught a glimpse of it but the Jackal mask and bronze-tipped arrows were clearly Egyptian.<eos> Fitting, if this piece of the Talisman was hidden by Benjamin Banneker.<eos> It sounds territorial, like a supernatural guard dog.
I only caught a glimpse of it but the Jackal mask and bronze-tipped arrows were clearly Egyptian.<eos> Fitting, if this piece of the Talisman was hidden by Benjamin Banneker.<eos> It sounds territorial, like a supernatural guard dog.<eos> You're right, it was like we woke it searching for the Talisman.<eos> It didn't pursue us.
Fitting, if this piece of the Talisman was hidden by Benjamin Banneker.<eos> It sounds territorial, like a supernatural guard dog.<eos> You're right, it was like we woke it searching for the Talisman.<eos> It didn't pursue us.<eos> Once we were out of range, it just let us go.
Well...<eos> Think it's over?<eos> That's the last we'll hear from Dreyfuss?<eos> I'd like to believe it... but evil has a manner of raising its head in a way we least expect.<eos> But if it should... we shall face it together.
All right.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Why am I not eating this every week?<eos> I've always thought lunch is the most important meal of the day.<eos> Yes, it is.
Jenkins.<eos> The homophobic Swede. And that's what he called himself.<eos> Do you know what a centerboard is?<eos> Centerboard?<eos> It's a part of the sailboat that you can't see.
The homophobic Swede. And that's what he called himself.<eos> Do you know what a centerboard is?<eos> Centerboard?<eos> It's a part of the sailboat that you can't see.<eos> But it keeps the boat upright and allows it to be steered.
Daddy's just helping us.<eos> I like you back together.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> I have to get this thing off.<eos> It itches.
1,000? You know, it changes you.<eos> Look at Sarah.<eos> You'll do whatever it takes to fend for them.<eos> The business of running a religion changes you.<eos> It's not a business.
Look at Sarah.<eos> You'll do whatever it takes to fend for them.<eos> The business of running a religion changes you.<eos> It's not a business.<eos> Yeah, it is.
- Guidance?<eos> - It was the darnedest thing.<eos> The Lem appeared for a second, but it looked like it was about to crash on the lunar surface.<eos> - Where the hell is the command module?<eos> - It's spinning off course.
My grandfather's happiness, my father's happiness, that's real.<eos> -Excusetheinterruption.<eos> Butyoumightwanttobrace forimpact.<eos> - Good news, we found the command module.<eos> Bad news, it's heading straight for a bunch of space rocks.
One which would bring the bearer unimaginable power.<eos> Have you heard of the Spear of Destiny?<eos> I came across numerous obscure references to it in my studies.<eos> Of course, such a divine artifact could never actually exist.<eos> But it does.
If we had used the Spear when we had the chance...<eos> I might have been tempted to use it to change my own future.<eos> Now... we've got nothing to lose.<eos> Marty, Marty, Marty.<eos> I know you've been working so hard on this project, and I wanted to come by and say thank you, but if it doesn't come online in the next few minutes,
- Aah! There's a knife and there's a lot of blood.<eos> Who has the knife?<eos> Who is stabbing Rosa?<eos> I don't know.<eos> It's in my hand.
Yes, he said there was another person in that motel room, but...<eos> Who has the knife?<eos> Who is stabbing Rosa? Reid:<eos> I don't know.<eos> It's in my hand.
Aethelflaed, hear me.<eos> There will be no rest.<eos> None.<eos> A life with Erik is what I want.<eos> It is best for me and it is best for Wessex.
You have a poor wretch, toiling in the fields, burning in summer, shivering in winter.<eos> He works all day, every day for nothing more than a loaf of bread and a pot to piss in.<eos> His children die of disease, his wife dies giving him children.<eos> Yet, when that land is threatened, something stirs. Why?<eos> It is the land that feeds him.
A traitor! You should at least consider doing the same!<eos> What am I to do with you?<eos> Your injury and your appetite for wine have robbed us both of your worth.<eos> You no longer serve a purpose.<eos> Then, with your permission, Lord, I shall return to my estate and my wife at Devonshire. Whilst it is still a Saxon estate.
Yeah.<eos> Well, where is he?<eos> I'm sorry. That creature killed him.<eos> What is it? That thing, where did it come from?<eos> It killed him?
What is it? That thing, where did it come from?<eos> It killed him?<eos> Yeah.<eos> He was covered in this, like... black slime.<eos> It knows where we are, and we'll all die here, in the dark.
Shall I tell you what's in there? No.<eos> It's called the Eater Of Light, and we held it back.<eos> Every generation, a new warrior went into the gate and fought the Eater Of Light so it couldn't break through.<eos> But the creature did break through.<eos> It broke through and it destroyed the whole Ninth Legion.
Why's it going dark?<eos> The sun's setting.<eos> No, it's the beast.<eos> It's circling us, it's looking for a way in.<eos> It's getting stronger again.
No, it's the beast.<eos> It's circling us, it's looking for a way in.<eos> It's getting stronger again.<eos> It's strong enough to feed.<eos> Every hour of sunlight that feeds it makes the world darker and the beast stronger.
Sorry?<eos> Monster!<eos> There!<eos> It's coming!<eos> It's here!
[with heavy accent] Ah! I am your downstairs neighbor, Isabellica Delmonicos.<eos> Yep, I am one of the rich A-holes who live in this building.<eos> I work in finance, producing nothing, destroying everything.<eos> God, I suck!<eos> Also, I got a leak in my apartment. I think it's coming from your bathroom.
There's no need.<eos> We're here.<eos> What is this place?<eos> Mother's spell book never would have led us here.<eos> It's practically dripping with light magic.
I know.<eos> Incredible, isn't she?<eos> What's up?<eos> I thought Cachet's number one salesman might like some lunch.<eos> It's only cheese, but I swiped a Penguin from Robbie's school dinner tin as a little treat.
To the uninitiated.<eos> But you add some knowhow and some bullshit, and this lump of fucking plastic turns into something far more eyecatching.<eos> Coxy laid out the doubleglazing business for me.<eos> Since Thatcher handed us the right to buy your council house, the world and his wife were madly renovating their newly owned dream homes.<eos> White gold was just plastic, a cheap alternative to timber, but it brought the cost of making brandnew windows down to peanuts.
Good, because while I've been standing here freezing my nuts off,<eos> I couldn't help thinking this conversation would have been much more comfortable in a beautiful doubleglazed porch.<eos> You always did know how to make me laugh, Vincent Swan.<eos> Interesting place for a personalised number plate.<eos> I quite like it.
They'll be asleep.<eos> Yeah, come on.<eos> Get away from my wife, you arsehole!<eos> Gotcha!<eos> Mate, you should have seen your fucking face, it was priceless.
Now, you and I both know he couldn't have vanished<eos> The Statue of fucking Liberty... but look into his eyes. Tell me he doesn't 100% believe that he just made her disappear for real.<eos> What you're looking at there, folks, is the secret of sales.<eos> Believe in what you're selling.<eos> I'd forgotten that, and it's almost cost me everything I love, my wife, my kids, my money.
USA! USA!<eos> They will take on the most physically and psychologically demanding obstacle course in the world... the ultimate battle of man versus beast.<eos> Twelve will enter, but only one can prevail.<eos> This is Ultimate Beastmaster.<eos> I don't know where this thing came from or how it got here.
I just wanna see somebody conquer it!<eos> Welcome to Ultimate Beastmaster!<eos> - I'm Terry Crews.<eos> - And I'm Charissa Thompson.<eos> And I'm with Terry, I have no idea where the heck this thing came from, but I am so glad it's here, because we have a front-row seat, Terry, to a global phenomenon.
Now the going gets tough.<eos> My boys next door, Rafinha and Anderson, are getting excited because up next is Brazil's Ricardo Oliveira.<eos> When I was 12 years old, I participated in a soccer crowd fight.<eos> Very dangerous.<eos> I managed to drop that life because it wasn't good for me.
Look to your right.<eos> Before this class is through, all of you will know how to make herb-roasted chicken! Ohh!<eos> I know this recipe.<eos> - I could make this chicken in my sleep.<eos> - How about we try it awake?
There's got to be a better way of doing this.<eos> On the contrary, Mitchell.<eos> It's simplicity itself.<eos> I dislodge the nest.<eos> It falls into the trash can.
I just have to... dangle my body out over the edge and then reach blindly for that top rung of the ladder you're not supposed to use.<eos> But I'll be in in a little bit.<eos> I got a few things I got to do.<eos> Got to maintain the roof.<eos> It's your house's hat.
I know what you think of me, USIC, this whole project.<eos> You were right.<eos> I didn't know.<eos> When I came here, I didn't know it's not just about saving the Earth.<eos> It's about so much bigger, so much bigger than I ever knew.
Good morning. Rise and shine.<eos> You done, Stay-Puff?<eos> Sorry, I had a few setbacks.<eos> This isn't even the new system.<eos> You know, I tried that system and, it was bunk.
This isn't even the new system.<eos> You know, I tried that system and, it was bunk.<eos> Maybe you built it backwards.<eos> I didn't, just trust me.<eos> It was shit.
Get EMT down here!<eos> Come here, come here.<eos> You admiring yourself, Ms. Traub?<eos> Or are you checking for blood spatter from when you murdered your ex-husband?<eos> When we found all that blood at Rockaway Beach, we thought it belonged to Preeda Boonark or Ryan's accomplice.
You admiring yourself, Ms. Traub?<eos> Or are you checking for blood spatter from when you murdered your ex-husband?<eos> When we found all that blood at Rockaway Beach, we thought it belonged to Preeda Boonark or Ryan's accomplice.<eos> We were wrong.<eos> It was Ryan's.
What is the Fall Fun Fair without Team Hendrix?<eos> I can't stop thinking about M.K. and Cosima out there all alone.<eos> Why do I love my sisters so much when they're ruined my life.<eos> Hey, your life isn't ruined.<eos> It's just waiting for you to come back and sparkle it up.
I got a high tolerance because of CrossFit.<eos> I've heard that. - I'm a doctor, and that is accurate.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> Hey, how is your eye?<eos> It's looking pretty rough.
So you feel trapped?<eos> What?<eos> No.<eos> I love my life.<eos> I just sometimes wonder what would happen if it was blown to smithereens and I got to start all over again.
What have you done?<eos> Which is why your friends and I have organized a very special...<eos> Night of surprises!<eos> I helped with the sign!<eos> It's beautiful, I love it.
I don't want to play Linda Tripp. I always play Linda Tripp.<eos> I never get to play the good characters.<eos> Come on, the play is not terrible.<eos> We're doing this for Sam.<eos> It's sweet.
We're doing this for Sam.<eos> It's sweet.<eos> - The play's really good.<eos> - Yes!<eos> It seems irrelevant and depressing, given the way things turned out.
You've gotta think it through.<eos> We had a plan and now you don't...<eos> Shut the fuck up.<eos> Streetcar was awesome.<eos> It was shit and this is shit.
- My hand!<eos> - You said we were fine!<eos> This thing has broke my foot!<eos> No!<eos> It's going in!
- You said we were fine!<eos> This thing has broke my foot!<eos> No!<eos> It's going in!<eos> It's going in the pool.
Wait, you took turns dressing up like a clown and creeping around Mount Pleasant, but you weren't buddies?<eos> It was a job, for a company called AdRupt.<eos> Have you guys ever heard of prankvertising?<eos> Prankver-what?<eos> I-It's like guerilla marketing.
He introduced that virus into the water supply and in all likelihood, killed a man in the process, just to give New Yorkers a few urgent trips to the toilet.<eos> Why?<eos> So, if I'm following everything you said, our-our terrorist doesn't want to kill the people of New York, he just wants to give them a bad case of the runs.<eos> Actually, bad might be something of an overstatement.<eos> An expert at the lab where the virus was created said that it would have run its course in a matter of days.
Now remarkably, one of the only publications to look past the hysteria and explore the consequences of Thorpe's actions, was this one. The Daily Newswire?<eos> You got to be kidding me.<eos> I can see the paper is mostly bollocks, but the metro reporter is tip-top.<eos> Every New Yorker knows...<eos> Every New Yorker aside from you, that is... That their water is the champagne of municipal hydration, because it arrives virtually untouched from the most pristine watershed in the country.
Steve's dead.<eos> Did you know that?<eos> Shit.<eos> I had this feeling when I was climbing. It's like I was... full.<eos> Only way I know how to describe it.
- Don't interrupt me!<eos> You know what the worst part is? I can't even be mad.<eos> Who am I gonna be mad at? Heather, for wanting to keep her baby?<eos> You, for wanting to support her? The baby?<eos> It's a fucking baby!
I meant I love you.<eos> I love you, too.<eos> Ugh, you're the worst.<eos> Just to be clear, this food belongs to the bar.<eos> It's only here temporarily.
Your cigarettes will be right here in the morning.<eos> Was supposed to be me.<eos> What's that?<eos> It was supposed to be me.<eos> Colt's about to have a baby and it isn't mine.
- Was it?<eos> - What's that supposed to mean?<eos> It means the second Colt and I get into an argument, you're sleeping with him without any protection.<eos> What, you think I wanted this?<eos> Well, if the condom doesn't fit, don't wear it.
It's not, man.<eos> Get to it on Monday.<eos> Yeah, the thing is, they want the new system up and running by 9:00 a.m. Sunday.<eos> Okay, but between you and me, I mean, how are they really gonna know?<eos> It's a tracking system.
You're giving me fucking emphysema!<eos> Thank you.<eos> Yeah, you're welcome.<eos> All right, fine. How far is the restaurant?<eos> It's right there.
So, I said, "Honey.<eos> Honey, look, there's Elsa from Frozen!"<eos> And she turned to look, and I grabbed her cell phone and I threw it overboard.<eos> And after that, we had the best time.<eos> Unfortunately, it was her mom's phone.
Okay, you... you hide McGriddles in my desk at school so I can find them in the morning.<eos> Sure, sometimes I don't check my desk for a week or two and the janitor has to get rid of it with gloves... but I appreciate the gesture.<eos> You make life exciting.<eos> Why can't we have fun?<eos> Remember how easy it used to be?
I'll be honest with you.<eos> - I came here to check you out.<eos> - What?<eos> I'm the father of Heather's baby.<eos> It's my first kid, so... I...
So, Mr. Bennett, any news on the...<eos> Actually, we met today, decided we're better off as friends. Oh.<eos> And I was already picturing you two and me and Colt on a double date.<eos> When you pictured that, was hell frozen over?<eos> Actually, I think it's for the best.
What are you doing here?<eos> Saying goodbye.<eos> I'm leaving tomorrow.<eos> What? I thought the offer on the bar fell through.<eos> Yeah, it did.
You'll be surprised what they'll do for a couple of big tips.<eos> What did you hear?<eos> What is that?<eos> !<eos> It's a pig-a-let!
If that's who I think it is, we hate her so hard.<eos> Last night, I was robbed.<eos> That's right.<eos> There I was at Lily's dance recital, breathlessly anticipating my baby's first-ever ballet solo.<eos> Okay, here it comes.
I may have a sad love life, but I don't need my mommy trying to boost my self-esteem.<eos> And if you really want to give me some confidence, how about a picture of me on your desk, and not just Haley and Luke.<eos> First of all, I didn't give you those flowers.<eos> Second of all, there is a picture of you.<eos> - Where is it? - Mm-hmm. [knocking]
Okay, put that back in the deck.<eos> All right.<eos> And what I'm gonna show you right now is, what I have is a tiny car.<eos> - Mm. - That is a very tiny car.<eos> But the thing about this car is that it's a magic car.
Denise, put on your dress so you can look nice for dinner.<eos> Man, this is some bullshit.<eos> Denise, that does not look like the clothes I picked out for you.<eos> What happened to that nice dress?<eos> It didn't fit right.
You don't got to worry about me getting pregnant.<eos> Why?<eos> You got that UID thing?<eos> Okay, first of all, it's not a UID.<eos> Okay? It's not a thing.
Why?<eos> You got that UID thing?<eos> Okay, first of all, it's not a UID.<eos> Okay? It's not a thing.<eos> - It's the IUD.
Aw. Well, I'll be here.<eos> That's true.<eos> Um, are you guys gonna do any fun New York stuff?<eos> Well, we're supposed to go to this cool museum upstate.<eos> It's called Storm King.
Um, are you guys gonna do any fun New York stuff?<eos> Well, we're supposed to go to this cool museum upstate.<eos> It's called Storm King.<eos> Have you ever been there?<eos> No, I've heard it's great, though.
Well.<eos> I am king of kings.<eos> And I can give you that legal right.<eos> I will give you legal claim to the kingdom of East Anglia.<eos> It's a large kingdom.
Anne's not like the others.<eos> You're too soft with her, Matthew.<eos> We'll not ask her too many questions when she gets back. Can we agree on that?<eos> I don't want to open a can of worms.<eos> She'll learn to like it, and that's that.
!<eos> - She ran inside!<eos> - Did it slow it down? - What were you thinking?<eos> Fire... fire needs oxygen.<eos> Closing windows and doors deprives it... - Oh, my word!
Can nothing be done?<eos> Our only hope would be to somehow raise the amount of the loan.<eos> We have to try.<eos> Everything of value will have to be sold, right quick.<eos> It's a fearful sum.
How may I help you today?<eos> I am here to return a dress.<eos> - Is something wrong with it?<eos> - Not a thing.<eos> - Do you not like it?
I am here to return a dress.<eos> - Is something wrong with it?<eos> - Not a thing.<eos> - Do you not like it?<eos> - It is my very favourite thing that I have ever possessed in life.
And if you cut it into pieces, each piece can form a new specimen.<eos> It regenerates. In many ways, it's immortal.<eos> Its secret is a gene called FoxO.<eos> It governs the production of stem cells in the organism.<eos> We humans have it as well, but it's less active in us.
If that virus can kill a healthy, grown man...<eos> Has your wife been infected?<eos> Has she got it?<eos> I just don't understand how.<eos> That means it's everywhere in here.
Everywhere! - It must have been one of us.<eos> - But we clean our hands meticulously.<eos> We need hazmat suits.<eos> If it's airborne, we're already in trouble.<eos> But it's probably droplets.
Well, there was a small issue with one of them...<eos> We're awake.<eos> Good.<eos> What is... What is wrong with my baby?<eos> It's gonna be fine.
That this was a threat across the planet to coral reefs, which would happen very quickly and cause a lot of damage.<eos> Back in the '80s, we started looking at this weird phenomenon.<eos> Large sections of-- of reefs were turning white, literally over a couple of weeks.<eos> And no one really knew why this was.<eos> As we did more and more experiments, it turned out that it wasn't a disease, it wasn't too much light.
Does that really matter?"<eos> But when you talk about the ocean... it's like your body temperature changing.<eos> And imagine your body temperature rises one degree centigrade or two degrees centigrade.<eos> Over a period of time, that would be fatal.<eos> And that's the seriousness of the issue when you look at it in terms of the ocean.
Good morning.<eos> Coral bleaching in Hawaii has gained a lot of attention.<eos> -So much that...<eos> -[Vevers] This isn't a natural cycle.<eos> This is a phenomenon directly attributed to climate change, and it's something that we've only seen in recent years.
But over time he's been proved right, time and time again.<eos> [Hoegh-Guldberg] I just love the reef.<eos> That's why I did this.<eos> That's why I came here when I was 18 to this island and started to study the reef.<eos> It wasn't because I thought it was gonna disappear or I was trying to battle a problem called global climate change.
[Rago] We designed something originally to do this project without emotions.<eos> And when we began doing this manually at Lizard Island... you have the emotional ties to it.<eos> You are down there.<eos> And to sit there for a month, and every single day, watch something new around you die that you saw yesterday... it's just difficult.<eos> You forget what it looked like at the beginning.
Then it was...<eos> it was a totally different mindset, because the reef was there forever, there was no question about it.<eos> -Yeah.<eos> -I even wondered why you would wanna make it a marine park.<eos> It's so big, nothing's gonna touch the Great Barrier Reef.
We have... this mountain bike.<eos> Loading up the Thule rack.<eos> And this is my entire life in the car right now, set up, ready for insanity.<eos> I'm getting ready for the single hardest amateur cycling event in the world.<eos> It's basically a miniature Tour de France for insane people.
I did.<eos> This is my morning pill-popping routine.<eos> And then I prepare the testosterone.<eos> Yes, testosterone propionate.<eos> It's really thick.
To redeem.<eos> Okay, let's back up one sec here.<eos> My concern is that it's something they would use to discredit you.<eos> Oh, of course.<eos> So, the first criminal investigation against you, when was it and what happened?
If an athlete needed to be swapped, you could swap 'em.<eos> But in Sochi, because of the Olympics, I am under double control.<eos> Both from IOC, WADA and I don't know who.<eos> Level of security is stunning.<eos> It's unbelievable.
I'll be dead.<eos> Can we stop talking about you being dead?<eos> You're not going anywhere.<eos> Wow, this chicken's really good, honey.<eos> Thanks. It's a dry rub.
And somewhere, unnoticed...<eos> Sorry!<eos> ..in silence or in darkness...<eos> Dammit!<eos> ..it has already begun.
Yet, the front door is secured with brand new Medeco- shrouded padlock shackles, and there are four Arecont Vision Dome Cameras around the perimeter.<eos> Someone has gone to a lot of bother to roll out the unwelcome mat.<eos> And you think that someone is the Shoreline 99s.<eos> Terrell asked Reggie to meet him at this donut shop, and we thought they were using it as as a gang front.<eos> Well, I think it might be gang front adjacent.
40 minutes.<eos> Marcus!<eos> Hey. August 23, 2009.<eos> A man is watching a hockey game in a bar in Harlem.<eos> It is Montreal's Canadiens against New York's Rangers.
Have you heard of tolling, Mr. Trimble?<eos> It's a legal term.<eos> When a crime is committed...<eos> Assault, for example.<eos> The statute of limitations on that crime begins the moment it is reported and continues to count down until the time expires.
And if you're still unclear about the concept of tolling, don't worry, because the 20-odd years you might get for criminal assault in the first degree should give you plenty of time to work it out.<eos> So, are we doing this?<eos> We are.<eos> Your phone rang.<eos> Yeah, it was the captain.
So I need a sign of good faith.<eos> Mm.<eos> And why?<eos> It's not like I could defeat you anyway, even with this sword.<eos> Then hand it over.
Well, it's only a risk if I lose.<eos> Have a seat.<eos> The Sorcerer's mansion?<eos> Well, what are we doing here?<eos> It's at the nexus of the most powerful magic in Storybrooke.
Now you are mine in every way.<eos> You will do exactly what I say... always.<eos> Now, you will find The Savior.<eos> And when you do, you will kill her.<eos> And then, when The Savior dies, the sword will do what it must... free me from this prison.
I'd had enough of this, so I came up with a new way of trying to prove my car was better than his.<eos> James, can I just ask, why have you brought me to London Airport?<eos> Because I want to prove that my car is faster than yours.<eos> That's funny, because I just heard you say that your car's faster than mine.<eos> Yeah, it is.
And I was in for a treat, because joining Roger Daltrey on stage was legendary guitarist Wilko Johnson.<eos> The fabulous Wilko Johnson!<eos> "Station waiting for a charge request from the vehicle.<eos> Initialisation. Charging."<eos> It's not charging.
To find out if he was a driving god, Clarkson and I arranged for Richard Hammond to take part in a drifting contest.<eos> Yeah, we did. We fixed up the car for him. We fixed up the competitors.<eos> We did everything.<eos> This is the car.<eos> It started out as a Nissan 200SX, but it's been fitted with a 700-horsepower 6.2L V8 and a modified steering rack, so it can do this.
Air intakes here with carbon and bag filters.<eos> Here...<eos> - So you did all this on your own?<eos> - Yes, check it out.<eos> I filter the water using osmosis and boil it, so everything's reused.
We have to stay focused and get to the others...<eos> -You're outside of your lion.<eos> Great. -I know we have to find the others.<eos> I'm just saying maybe this thing can help.<eos> Also, it's a mermaid.
[Coran's voice] My name is Coran and I'm a gorgeous man.<eos> Why would a society full of literal tech wizards use spores to send a distress signal?<eos> Who cares?<eos> When do we get to see that city?<eos> Actually, Pidge, the distress signal isn't coming from the city. It's coming from... the forest.
Just look at Ulaz.<eos> He sacrificed himself to save us.<eos> For all we know, his sacrifice was a ploy.<eos> One life means nothing to Zarkon.<eos> It means something to me.
Let's just say, "Number 44?<eos> Your order's up."<eos> Enjoy your meal.<eos> What did you do to her face?<eos> It's cracking!
Is that a hologram?<eos> His suit has the ability to create a virtual mindscape, reflecting its wearer's greatest hopes and fears.<eos> And, at this moment, your friend desperately wants to see you.<eos> What is it with you and that thing?<eos> It's the only connection I have to my past.
Good for you!<eos> Scaultrite is an important substance, with thousands of commercial and industrial uses, including fabrication foam, insect night vision goggles, teludav--<eos> Uh anti-fungal klanmüirl lotion and other such lubricants.<eos> What's wrong with the video?<eos> It's ten thousand years old.
And I love that.<eos> I love this kind of tension, especially in editorial, but a lot of the calls I got were out of desperation.<eos> So I think Chuck Close said, "Inspiration is for amateurs.<eos> Us professionals, we just go to work in the morning."<eos> The one thing I really love about that quote is it relieves you of a lot of pressure.
Like moving around the light, and all of a sudden, there's a highlight or a shadow and then, "Oh, now there's something happening."<eos> You can't sketch that.<eos> I never was a reader because I never want to escape from anything, I want my real life to be interesting.<eos> But then I read a book, The Invention of Slowness, I think is the title.<eos> It's about a guy who is so incredibly slow in his perception that he can... He actually sees shadows moving.
We found a lot of ways to solve the problems in a completely unproblematic way.<eos> Even though it's a very small building, with a small budget, I think it had an impact, and it won a handful of awards.<eos> And I think it showed that even something that is essentially like a hut for boy scouts, which is typically more like a barrack building, like sort of off the shelf, almost like a trailer, that's what it normally is,<eos> and with the same resources you could get something that was completely different.<eos> I think that definitely opened people's way of thinking about architecture, what a building could be and what it could do.
It's quite amazing that this will be the children's hill.<eos> It begins all the way up there!<eos> It's high up, even though it's the children's hill. Yeah, that's right.<eos> It's too cool!<eos> Of course you can say you put an Alpine ski slope on the roof of a building. It's a building, it's not a mountain.
I don't want to sound like a Debbie the Downer, but no matter how many times you come up against the Communications Decency Act it's always gonna shut you down.<eos> Since my daughter was sold on Backpage she's a totally different person.<eos> She's traumatized.<eos> That spark and fire I used to see in her eyes is gone.<eos> Well, it's forever changed her.
"The three so-called flying saucers had been recovered in New Mexico."<eos> "Each one was occupied by three bodies of human shape, but only three feet tall."<eos> The case's become the number one document viewed on the FBI website after we released this.<eos> Now the craft was a more or less an oval or egg-shaped craft.<eos> It wasn't saucer shaped.
We had contact with an unidentified flying object that had entered our airspace.<eos> We had it on radar for almost an hour.<eos> The order was given by Admiral Train, to try and get this object forced down out of the sky if at all possible, by whatever means possible.<eos> What was really driving him nuts was this thing absolutely had complete control of the situation.<eos> And could just be wherever it wanted to be.
What was really driving him nuts was this thing absolutely had complete control of the situation.<eos> And could just be wherever it wanted to be.<eos> Just in a matter of seconds.<eos> One minute off the coast of Maine, and the next minute it's in Norfolk headed south towards Florida.<eos> After that we found out that it wasn't the Russians.
And could just be wherever it wanted to be.<eos> Just in a matter of seconds.<eos> One minute off the coast of Maine, and the next minute it's in Norfolk headed south towards Florida.<eos> After that we found out that it wasn't the Russians.<eos> They didn't care who it was or where it was from.
Frankly, it was devastating.<eos> Initially, I have to admit, the CIA Director, I thought, to be honest with you, that he was, um, sort of picking my brain to find out what I knew, as opposed to really not knowing.<eos> And by the time the three-hour meeting was over it was quite clear that the emperor had no clothes.<eos> He later denied the meeting.<eos> It happened for a brief...
He said, "Do you know why they killed Marilyn?"<eos> Mr. President, the late Marilyn Monroe.<eos> And I said,<eos> "Well, I didn't until I got this document."<eos> It's a virtual death warrant, because she was found a couple of days later.
"Ace in the hole technologies."<eos> So secret they didn't even talk about it.<eos> November 12th of 1988 was their dog and pony show, a classified military exhibit at Norton Air Force base.<eos> And then often, a separate section of the hangar behind a curtain, which was opened up once everyone had gathered, were three of these so-called Alien Reproduction Vehicles, or ARVs.<eos> The craft itself was hovering off the floor with no landing gear underneath it, nothing supporting it from above.
So if they wanted to hoax an alien invasion they could do it, and they could do it in a way that's a 100% believable.<eos> They started doing all kinds of psychological warfare entrainment of the public by staging hoaxed events.<eos> Such as cattle mutilations,<eos> "Oh, it's a flying saucer who did that."<eos> It's a covert paramilitary program, human.
Wresting power from the hands of these powerful oligarchs and corporations is going to require a revolution.<eos> One of the more hopeful events that happened over the last decade was what I called "The French Initiative."<eos> I get a letter from the Ministry of Defense, and it's dated 16th of January 2007.<eos> Urgent.<eos> And it's signed by Admiral Pierre Moran.
At what?<eos> Help me, Meemaw.<eos> [Jacqueline] ♪ Oh, Meemaw ♪ ♪ Meemaw ♪<eos> ♪ We're hungry for your dish ♪<eos> ♪ It's mostly corn ♪
Oh, darling, good.<eos> You can help me decide.<eos> Now, magenta says, "A queen must be seen to be believed."<eos> But, the white says, "new beginnings."<eos> Yeah, but it also says "virgin".
Madam President, people will die.<eos> Which is why I'm surprised you won't agree to my terms.<eos> I can't agree to the terms without the approval of my State Councillor for Foreign Affairs.<eos> There are 112 people aboard the vessel. 113 if you count Mr. Peterson.<eos> Now, it will go under in 20 to 32 hours.
Then we'll regroup and make sure we're on the same page.<eos> Okay.<eos> We need to head back.<eos> "Beware entangling alliances," Mr. President.<eos> You know, that quote is often attributed to Washington, but it was actually Jefferson who said it.
Even if you're impeached and convicted... you still make history.<eos> Augustus Underwood was just another redneck who died fighting for the wrong side, forgotten by everyone but you and me.<eos> But if Francis Underwood is removed from office?<eos> Your legacy won't die.<eos> It'll be solidified.
Gelsemium.<eos> For migraines.<eos> I get them all the time.<eos> It comes out of China.<eos> But don't worry, it's herbal.
In a very short period of time, I pretty much became the lead designer.<eos> One of my very first projects was the Air Max.<eos> I felt like this was an opportunity to think way differently.<eos> Nike was encapsulating gas inside a urethane airbag for a cushioning component.<eos> I thought, "Let's make the bag a little bit wider, make sure it's stable, but then let's remove part of the midsole, so we actually see it."
-[Fox] That's insane.<eos> -[Tinker] Isn't that crazy?<eos> That's really great!<eos> Design is-- it just never really stops.<eos> It just sort of keeps on going and you keep thinking about things and you keep trying to refine.
I come back excited from meetings, because she's always coming up with information I would've never known or discovered by any other means.<eos> A new stimulus every time, many in a meeting.<eos> [Es] Normally, throughout the process there will be a number of meetings.<eos> There might be five or there might be 25.<eos> And it might take a year or three years or three months.
The more I practice and the more I begin to be more self-reflective in the practice, which is happening now, really, then I begin to ask: why do I need to engage with these people?<eos> What relevance is this work to me? Why do I need to...<eos> What can I bring to it?<eos> It's interesting, isn't it, because the word "show" suggests that you're revealing something.<eos> It doesn't suggest finding.
What would you have to show if you hadn't been looking and finding and seeking?<eos> This is going on a truck tomorrow night, going to Belgium.<eos> So I looked at some footage of babies playing with those sorting boxes, where you pick up a triangle, you pick up a circle, you pick up a square and you try to slot it through different apertures in the box.<eos> It's actually extraordinary footage to watch, because what's happening in their brain is every time they discover something new, they're getting a little dopamine rush, which is why we're biologically selected to be in love with new things.<eos> This baby literally, either when it does go through or when it doesn't go through, either of those instances is a new sensation, and it gets a little reward.
Right there, you just said you thought you saw Sandra Bullock.<eos> I already know the ending.<eos> It wasn't her.<eos> End of story.<eos> Yeah, but you don't even know who it really was.
Uh, well...<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Haley, when I woke up this morning, I just had this feeling.<eos> And I know this is sudden, but like any mid-to-large market weatherman, I trust my instincts.<eos> And it might have something to do with turning 45, but today my instincts told me not to wait another second to spend the rest of my life with the woman I love.
Wrong cord!<eos> What have you done?<eos> Geez, it seems like Joe's crib's damaged beyond repair!<eos> No, no, it's fine.<eos> It just Froggered across the street.
I got the tickets online.<eos> Easier than buying them at the venue, I guess.<eos> What is the venue, uh, by the way?<eos> You can't buy them at the door.<eos> It's a private concert.
Easier than buying them at the venue, I guess.<eos> What is the venue, uh, by the way?<eos> You can't buy them at the door.<eos> It's a private concert.<eos> It's just for the fan club.
He debased himself in ways you can't imagine.<eos> You said it wasn't that bad.<eos> What are you watching?<eos> Our neighbor sent me a video.<eos> It's of Haley and Mitchell.
She's probably just making sure it works, right?<eos> So that bitch stole my car.<eos> On a positive note, it is nice to see a woman break into a previously male-dominated field.<eos> My makeup was not insured.<eos> It's the perfect solution.
♪ You'll always be ♪ ♪ The love of my life ♪<eos> Did you give her the present yet? No.<eos> No, not yet.<eos> She gets so many things at Christmas, so I'm going to wait a little bit.<eos> I want to keep it a surprise, okay? So you have to keep it a secret.
He didn't leave a trace of himself on the lobby security camera either.<eos> And it's pretty interesting that their system suffered a glitch 20 minutes before Kotite took a header.<eos> Again, I offer the possibility of a killer ghost.<eos> Actually, I think whatever happened to that surveillance video is our best clue.<eos> It's an expensive system, so whoever knocked out those cameras had to have a certain level of technical sophistication.
I wrote for MTV's Singled Out.<eos> You're welcome.<eos> I wrote for All That on Nickelodeon.<eos> Yeah, applaud.<eos> Then, when I was 23, me and Dave Chappelle wrote Half Baked, so, at this point, my system of keeping myself afloat via accomplishments was working beautifully... until it stopped.
A bunch of other people waiting for other doctors, fill out the form, old magazines.<eos> They call me back into his office, put an I.V. in my arm, drip ketamine into it, and I tripped my fucking face off.<eos> On a Tuesday afternoon in a doctor's office, immobile, out, music festival level, not on this plane. Gone.<eos> And it lasted about 45 minutes, but the comedown was rough.<eos> When I came out of it, I felt like I just came out of surgery, which makes sense because it is an anesthetic.
I tried to hide behind the woman, and she kind of forced me out of hiding.<eos> Like, hiding kind of comes naturally to me.<eos> And there's part of me that still loved to do it.<eos> I love to find someone to hide behind, but this is the right thing to do. Me doing stand-up by myself is the right thing to do.<eos> It's just more honest, you know?
And then, back to men... Just gigantic creeps.<eos> Women, you gotta understand, it's not even really our fault.<eos> It's testosterone.<eos> It's a creepy hormone.<eos> It's got nothing but bad ideas all day.
Get me more power.<eos> I must connect to the Black Lion.<eos> Kolivan, I'm in. Now, what?<eos> Now, you need to reset the system, using the codes that Thace obtained.<eos> It'll be down for a dobosh.
- No, no, I don't.<eos> - What do you think?<eos> We have to know if the trait is heritable.<eos> You're going to harvest her eggs.<eos> This is where it got in.
- What do you think?<eos> We have to know if the trait is heritable.<eos> You're going to harvest her eggs.<eos> This is where it got in.<eos> But it's injured.
This is where it got in.<eos> But it's injured.<eos> We'll find it.<eos> No, it won't be necessary.<eos> I know where it is.
Lock the door behind me.<eos> - The roof...<eos> Red. Roof, red.<eos> - What?<eos> It was red.
He was concerned that O.G. might require medical assistance.<eos> So I began investigating right away.<eos> And?<eos> I noticed an odd pattern of lights in the corner of the video.<eos> I realized it was two different billboards flashing outside O.G.'s window.
Implying that, for reasons unknown, the killer paused his attack for half an hour before delivering a final, fatal series of blows.<eos> Well, these head wounds aren't consistent with the butt of a gun.<eos> They are not.<eos> They were inflicted with a pointed metal object, perhaps a hammer claw or garden trowel.<eos> Well, whatever it was, the killer took it with him when he left.
Well, whatever it was, the killer took it with him when he left.<eos> Who brings a gun and a garden tool to commit a murder?<eos> Hopefully, this might provide some insight.<eos> I resisted the temptation to examine it before I could establish proper chain of custody.<eos> You think it was the victim's?
So?<eos> So, why did the arsonist use a waste basket?<eos> Why not a gas can?<eos> I'll tell you why.<eos> Because the petrol didn't come from a can, it came from a car, which was parked right here.
So, why did the arsonist use a waste basket?<eos> Why not a gas can?<eos> I'll tell you why.<eos> Because the petrol didn't come from a can, it came from a car, which was parked right here.<eos> It was siphoned.
Do not call me.<eos> I'll be in touch in a few days.<eos> I hope some day we'll be back together as a family, the three of us.<eos> - The phone's ringing.<eos> - It's not mine.
Your daughter reported your husband for murdering you.<eos> Your problem is that absolutely no one can confirm your story.<eos> - Put that down.<eos> - A call from a patient can be vital.<eos> - Put it on the table.
I was joking.<eos> Yes, well, we both know that I don't have a sense of humor at times.<eos> But, uh, yes, I am taking my leave.<eos> What do you mean, "leave"?<eos> This team has functioned far better in my absence than it ever did under my leadership.
Well, now this thing wants a fingerprint.<eos> No way.<eos> First of all, I sanded mine off after the Lufthansa heist, and that thumb I found--<eos> Lillian, this thing is gonna solve all your problems.<eos> I don't-- You can use it to feed your cats with this automatic cat feeder.
What? No, I know people have legs.<eos> Lieutenant Dan doesn't.<eos> [exhales sharply] Cyndee, that is not the kind of help Kimmy needs.<eos> [sighs] The key is being able to cry on cue.<eos> Imagine you're biting into a delicious stick of butter and then it's just cheese.
Hey.<eos> How are you?<eos> Good.<eos> I wanted to return this book.<eos> Thanks. Hope it helped.
Just cruises by the first Point Thruster.<eos> And he swings his way right onto the Coil Crawl.<eos> Now, Phillip has to quickly make his way through these metallic rings and pipes because, remember, this thing will start sinking the moment he steps in.<eos> Let's see if he can use some of that fancy footwork to get across here.<eos> You can see it starting to sink.
Trying to grab that Point Thruster.<eos> Just misses! - Oh, into the Coil Crawl!<eos> - He runs into the Coil Crawl!<eos> He is making his way through this Coil Crawl exactly how he should be doing it, and that is fast, because that thing sinks.<eos> It's sinking right now, but he's out of it, which is great.
That's it! Give it your all!<eos> Amazing, I loved the level.<eos> I tried to play it safe and save strength for the finals.<eos> So I couldn't do the trapeze, that would've been fun.<eos> But I enjoyed, and I loved it.
It's a great vibe, I felt really good.<eos> Get ready for a showdown!<eos> USA's Charles Robinson versus Mexico's Roberto Perez in Level 4!<eos> It's the moment of truth, Level 4 of the Beast.<eos> But, before we kick it off, let's take a quick look back at what our two finalists endured to get here.
So he decided to write a book.<eos> Cut to the big day.<eos> He hangs up his wig, moves to New Jersey, we settle in here, and to his utter shock, he likes retirement.<eos> Whole book thing falls away.<eos> It was gonna be a "how to" about opening and closing arguments.
Cheryl Perth filled in the one day Saunders spilled a secret worth killing over.<eos> We're lucky that Saunders melted down during a pre-trial hearing.<eos> If there had been a jury, they'd all be dead, too.<eos> I know it sounds crazy, but something about Chinese astronauts, Venezuelan toilet bombs, or gold under the pyramids has gotten everyone killed.<eos> We just have to figure out what it was.
It didn't hurt. And it also helped that he could blame the bombing on his competitor.<eos> The cyclonite was traced to Colombian rebels who support the opposition.<eos> All right, I'm convinced.<eos> I'm also utterly flummoxed.<eos> How the hell did a London barrister know about a fake assassination attempt in Venezuela three years before it happened?
Gephardt added it to the Fidel Files himself?<eos> It's what he had in mind all along.<eos> That's why he was so keen to get his hands on the files.<eos> They're a Trojan horse.<eos> If he had posted this online by itself, there'd be a million questions about whether it was real, where it came from.
That's why he was so keen to get his hands on the files.<eos> They're a Trojan horse.<eos> If he had posted this online by itself, there'd be a million questions about whether it was real, where it came from.<eos> People would just say he filmed it in his basement, but now the shoe's on the other foot.<eos> You've got to prove it isn't real.
Through this picture, she will give other people in a similar position great strength.<eos> So when I press the shutter... Hold that. something amazing happens.<eos> Yes! It's 500th of a second, but it's freezed an event.<eos> You're looking for a moment when you feel you're as close to the soul as possible.<eos> That's what good design is, when it liberates you, and it allows you to do that, to help you feel something very powerful.
But I see it differently.<eos> We spend 87% of our lives inside buildings.<eos> How they are designed really affects how we feel, how we behave.<eos> Design is not just a visual thing.<eos> It's a thought process. It's a skill.
How they are designed really affects how we feel, how we behave.<eos> Design is not just a visual thing.<eos> It's a thought process. It's a skill.<eos> Ultimately, design is a tool to enhance our humanity.<eos> It's a frame for life.
It was for the media and advertising and film crowd, so my proposal said it should be this very informal place that you could just treat as if it was your own.<eos> Like a family house of a friend where the parents have gone away for the weekend and left the keys to the drinks cabinet.<eos> And now, that doesn't seem so radical, but really then, it was the first of a kind.<eos> And then Nick asked me to do the next Soho House in New York.<eos> And that's really where the studio began because that's when I brought people in to help me, and it grew from there.
They developed a style of design and illustration that combined pop colors, wit and intellectual thinking.<eos> It's where I really started to understand that type had spirit and did not have to be some clean, mechanical-like thing that was simply doing its job.<eos> It could be this marvelous thing to engage with.<eos> Seymour has the studio above me.<eos> It's a bigger studio, and he makes more paintings.
But I couldn't stay out of town that long, I have to come back to town.<eos> [both] Yay! Otherwise, I won't have any ideas.<eos> When I started designing environmental graphics, it let me design in the physical world and that was at a time when the most interesting design had become digital.<eos> I was making large-scale lettering on buildings to create a sense of place, as well as to get somebody to navigate their way through it.<eos> Design exists beyond screens. It has an impact in real life.
In the first column, George Bush was first and Al Gore was second.<eos> And then on the other side was Pat Buchanan.<eos> She had the holes that you punched in the center, except for the holes weren't where you thought they were going to be.<eos> You assume that if the first hole belonged to George Bush, that the second hole, right below it, would belong to Al Gore.<eos> But in fact, it belonged to Pat Buchanan, because the holes were staggered.
You're not changing somebody.<eos> You're making them a more perfect vision of where they started.<eos> So the job is to traverse these different roads and try to get either an individual, a group of people, or a whole corporation to be able to see.<eos> [Paula] In 1998, Citibank was merging with Travelers Insurance Company.<eos> They wanted a logo that reflected the merger and they wanted to launch it in the newspaper three weeks after hiring us to do it.
There are two Is in Citi. It means the edge of the arc can line up with the two Is.<eos> There were a million meetings trying to get by 'em.<eos> "What if you do it this way, or that way?<eos> Show it to me on stationery, show it to me on a card.<eos> It's got to be red on top and blue on the bottom.
Putin uses it.<eos> Litvinenko's 2006 poisoning from polonium-210 is the most famous in recent history, but cyanide, dioxin, thallium, sodium fluoride, those have all been used as murder weapons by Russian operatives.<eos> Quite a repertoire.<eos> Those are just the ones that have been identified.<eos> Poison breaks down very quickly, so it's incredibly hard to trace, especially when it's masked by other symptoms.
No physical contact.<eos> I just want to hug my son.<eos> I said step back, ma'am.<eos> Nurse is on her way down.<eos> Reid: "Life can only be understood backwards, but it must be lived forwards."
- Babe.<eos> - In here.<eos> I think I hate this fucking town.<eos> How was Dick's class?<eos> Uh, it was full, so I didn't get in.
What's going on?<eos> Clear your next six weekends. - Geoff: All right.<eos> I'm writing a play.<eos> - Really?<eos> - Yeah. It's, uh, it's about a couple from New York.
Clear your next six weekends. - Geoff: All right.<eos> I'm writing a play.<eos> - Really?<eos> - Yeah. It's, uh, it's about a couple from New York.<eos> It's not about a couple. It's about a woman.
We've got people canvassing the neighborhood, checking the local hospitals, seeing if anyone was reported missing.<eos> But given what we just heard, it's hard to imagine that the victim survived.<eos> Any chance you sent the police to the wrong street?<eos> The system's been tested a hundred times, Michael.<eos> And the mayor's office has the stats, so you know it works.
I can vouch that the shooting took place where BulletPoint said it did.<eos> I found a shell casing a little further down the block.<eos> It likely fell from the vehicle that drove the crime scene away.<eos> Its odor confirmed that it had been fired recently, and its caliber matched the system's analysis.<eos> I'd like to ask more about how the system works, what it records and when.
The Rotary 7 is the future of telecommunications.<eos> It's a long way off.<eos> I need to present the project, build the prototype...<eos> One step at a time.<eos> [Marga] If it works, you'll be rich?
Keep it.<eos> I have more.<eos> Maybe you don't care about your life.<eos> No wonder.<eos> It's not a great life.
[softly] I've got nothing to say to you, Francisco.<eos> [Victoria] Problem solved.<eos> Here's your identification.<eos> You can relax now.<eos> It's not solved yet.
Is that a yes?<eos> -Miss Aguilar, is that a yes?<eos> -Why don't you call me Lidia?<eos> [Alba] Then there are those who believe that only the heart knows what we really want.<eos> That it's the compass that can guide us to happiness.
She's trustworthy and very discreet.<eos> No.<eos> No.<eos> For me, a child is a blessing.<eos> [Alba] Yes, but at times it isn't.
It's part of what I want, I can't deny it.<eos> But my dreams go much farther.<eos> I'm thinking about the future, not just the number of subscribers.<eos> The telephone is a new invention.<eos> We don't know how far it can go.
-[both chuckle] 100 pesetas?<eos> Are you implying that we don't pay much?<eos> I want to invest in your project.<eos> Consider it an investment.<eos> I know it's not much, but you have to start somewhere.
-Find her?<eos> Doña Lola, aren't you ashamed of yourself?<eos> [Alba] Don't you know eavesdropping is a sin?<eos> At your age!<eos> It was a matter of life and death.
I have to run an important errand for a friend.<eos> I have to go.<eos> [Alba] Treachery destroys even the greatest of unions.<eos> Feeling that someone you love, a friend, a lover or a son, is doing something behind your back has only one possible outcome, and it isn't a happy one.<eos> Trust is earned day by day, but it's lost in an instant, like a glass of water spilled on the floor.
[Indalecio] With all due respect, Carmen, Ricardo signed his last wishes, specifying that Francisco would take charge of the company,<eos> Elisa would be the main shareholder, and Carlos would have an income as long as he gave up any claim to the company.<eos> But you decided not to give it to the notary.<eos> Otherwise, we wouldn't be having this conversation.<eos> Although it's not a will, per se... it expresses what the deceased intended, and so--

- With a show of solidarity.<eos> Up next, our third competitor in Level 2, Santiago López from Mexico.<eos> I'm proud to be 100% Mexican.<eos> I started gymnastics when I was three.<eos> It defined me as a person.
Look at that!<eos> Are you seeing this?<eos> Can you see it?<eos> Felipe is one of the best climbers in the world.<eos> Now, this obstacle may be a little bit tougher for Felipe, because it relies less on his climbing skills.
All right, let's see if he can get his grip.<eos> He's making good progress.<eos> That tube is sinking quickly.<eos> Once he gets to the top, he'll need to jump to the Dreadmills as quickly as possible.<eos> It's starting to sink into the Beast's blood.
- He did it! He did it!<eos> Whoo-hoo! - Go for it, bro!<eos> Let's see how Felipe Camargo finishes Level 3.<eos> He's on the first pole, and already looking like he's having some trouble.<eos> This obstacle should play into his strengths, since it relies so heavily on climbing ability.
- Yeah, he's got it!<eos> He grabbed the top!<eos> Korean Kim Yunhwan!<eos> There's his younger brother watching on as Yunhwan now has to make the jump on Faceplant.<eos> That rope can really do a number on your hands if you don't get a good, firm grip on it.
Faster!<eos> Go!<eos> Man!<eos> If you get out of the Digestive Track fast enough, you'll have a higher angle on the jump to the Dreadmills, but when it's lower, it's just that much harder, as Yoshitaro just found out.<eos> It moved down faster than I thought.
I cannot believe this!<eos> He's not gonna make it.<eos> Now, Bruno did a good job.<eos> He got in Digestive Track, but he had no strategy on how to get up, and unfortunately for him, he gets stuck in a flood of blood.<eos> As soon as you step on it, it levels down.
You cannot let yourself get dizzy on this thing.<eos> See, right when he spins, right there. You gotta jump, right?<eos> - Your disorientation skills...<eos> - 'Cause the longer you stay... on the spinning gears, the dizzier you get, as he tries to regroup.<eos> And it's going faster than you remember!
Guys, unbelievable performance by Heeyong Park!<eos> Park Heeyong!<eos> I made it! I made it!<eos> We have our Level 4.<eos> It is Felipe Camargo from Brazil versus Heeyong Park from South Korea!
How fucked up is that?<eos> We started legalizing weed before immigrants.<eos> When I was a kid, I was told weed was a drug.<eos> "Don't do it.<eos> It'll ruin your life."
When I was a kid, I was told weed was a drug.<eos> "Don't do it.<eos> It'll ruin your life."<eos> "Don't do it.<eos> It'll ruin your life."
I've been trying to get in shape.<eos> You guys, I went to the gym today.<eos> Man, I'm going inside tomorrow, but...<eos> I had to find it first, dude!<eos> It's right next to my McDonald's. I had no idea.
There I am in the bedroom.<eos> "How is it outside, chicken?"<eos> "I wish I could be a cage-free kid, but..."<eos> "gangs."<eos> This chicken is expensive because I'm paying for the hobbies it had when it was alive?
"How is it outside, chicken?"<eos> "I wish I could be a cage-free kid, but..."<eos> "gangs."<eos> This chicken is expensive because I'm paying for the hobbies it had when it was alive?<eos> This chicken's $20 a pound because it played the cello and it liked to surf.
Drive-by honey-roasted.<eos> And don't misunderstand me.<eos> I grew up poor, but I grew up happy.<eos> You know? Like, you don't need money to be happy.<eos> It fucking helps, but... you don't need it.
Isn't it weird to think that people don't know what encyclopedias are?<eos> They don't know the pain of having to do homework with that shit.<eos> Getting a book report...<eos> Having to go to the library, hoping the volume hasn't been stolen yet.<eos> You show up, it's gone.
I already had my first beer when I was 14.<eos> Not a fan.<eos> Max gave you a beer?<eos> At 14?<eos> It wasn't Grandpa.
This is Jackson Oz.<eos> You are not Jackson Oz.<eos> No, it's not.<eos> A friend of mine created a virus that poisoned every search engine.<eos> When you look for a photo of me, it's replaced by that doctored image.
No thank you.<eos> I've already missed too much.<eos> I don't want to lose anything else.<eos> I promise you, we will find a way out of this.<eos> We'll find out who did this and we'll get this thing out of my head, but for right now, it stays.
Ovulation.<eos> Ovulation?<eos> Now, unfortunately, the egg wasn't viable, but even so, no one else has been able to achieve this feat.<eos> But our goal is not just ovulation.<eos> It's to bring a child to term.
The tissue sample, it's grown into a fetus.<eos> Into a baby hybrid?<eos> But how?<eos> I don't know.<eos> But this egg, I think it's calling for help.
Wait, Clem.<eos> Don't worry, Dad.<eos> Not going anywhere.<eos> So... how did you end up with the plane?<eos> Well, we saved the world on this thing, I thought I should keep it in the family.
What is the name of this land?"<eos> "This land over here?<eos> This is called India."<eos> "Well, my good man, I am here to tell you that India is now under the British Empire."<eos> "And I'm glad that I can tell you that India is exactly where it was yesterday."
Who are we?<eos> ' Oh, my God!"<eos> It was because of that voice, the first black president voice.<eos> And I'll never forget the day I saw a picture... of Barack Obama meeting Nelson Mandela for the very first time.<eos> It's a beautiful image, and it's of the two men in silhouette.
All set.<eos> What's that?<eos> A housewarming gift for Raj.<eos> Well, a bunch of fake snakes better not spring out of it, 'cause that was a lousy anniversary present.<eos> It's nothing like that.
Beverly believes I unconsciously consider my old room an escape hatch.<eos> Is that bothering you? Yes.<eos> I don't care for unconscious thoughts.<eos> My brain and I are best friends.<eos> It should tell me everything.
Learning anything?<eos> Well, sloth babies cling to their mothers' bodies for almost a year.<eos> I'm going back to work after only four months, so I've learned I hate myself, I hate sloths, and I hate you for bringing me here.<eos> Me I get, but that sloth is pretty cute.<eos> It's not just the sloth.
Weren't you at least able to bring the helmettals back?<eos> Damn it.<eos> You know we don't have the tech to make that stuff anymore.<eos> What about food?<eos> It was all dried up.
I quote:<eos> "From time to time, the illustrated papers show how a Negro has become a lawyer, a teacher, perhaps even a minister.<eos> It never dawns on the degenerate, middle-class America that this is truly a sin against all reason, that it is criminal madness to train a born half-ape until one believes one has made a lawyer of him."<eos> This book was written 20 years ago.<eos> The plan which it foreshadowed has become a reality.
Well, I hope you're more cooperative tomorrow, for your own sake.<eos> Hey, Tom, it's Ray.<eos> I left a package at your place last night.<eos> Make sure you get to it before Natalie does.<eos> My name's not on it or anything, but it's in your mail.
Mr. Brady asked if you might, uh, investigate.<eos> It was just one.<eos> You can bully all the rest of 'em if you want to, but I'd be careful with that boy.<eos> He's too smart, he gonna see right through you before long.<eos> It was just one.
The restaurant fell still.<eos> I was shocked.<eos> I didn't mean to say it out loud, but it just came out.<eos> "OJ!"<eos> He stopped, turned around to see who said it, saw my black face and correctly assumed it was me.
Obviously, Bill Cosby was a hero to me.<eos> And she doesn't know what it feels like to think that your hero might've done something so heinous, my God, you can't imagine.<eos> It'd be as if you heard that chocolate ice cream itself... had raped 54 people.<eos> You'd say to yourself, "Oh, man, but I like chocolate ice cream.<eos> I don't want it to rape."
Good night!<eos> Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!<eos> I forgot.<eos> The fourth time I met OJ Simpson.<eos> The fourth time is not the funniest time, but it was the last time I'd see the Juice.
Hmm. Please.<eos> So, you were saying, uh, your fictional world.<eos> Brinel.<eos> Yes.<eos> Yeah, the script's not done yet, but it's going to be perfect.
Still haven't found a replacement for him?<eos> Talent like that doesn't grow on trees, Pat.<eos> Well, see you two around.<eos> What's wrong with the Sally script?<eos> It is a bit flat.
Please.<eos> You like the title?<eos> Yeah, I like the whole script.<eos> The characters, scenarios... all very strong.<eos> And it has real thrills in it.
Perhaps we can sit in silence.<eos> No, no, I...<eos> I brought a baby into the world.<eos> Beautiful baby.<eos> Was it great.
So full of promise.<eos> But, Father, my baby has taken a turn.<eos> My baby is... in crisis.<eos> And I'm scared. Hmm.<eos> Stuck, waiting for news. It might not survive the weekend.
So you call it Untitled.<eos> No, I don't call it anything.<eos> When I first saw your work, Dick, the word "art" seemed so inadequate.<eos> This was something much more ancient and unnamable.<eos> It evoked in me a feeling of boundlessness.
No, I don't call it anything.<eos> When I first saw your work, Dick, the word "art" seemed so inadequate.<eos> This was something much more ancient and unnamable.<eos> It evoked in me a feeling of boundlessness.<eos> It was fucking terrifying.
See ya.<eos> - [door opens, closes] - That piece didn't come through. Oh.<eos> Who?<eos> Laura Aguilar.<eos> The donor thought it wouldn't resonate well with our collection.
Now I think the noise is... it's not out here, you know?<eos> So... just thinking about... taking some risks.<eos> Hmm. You know what?<eos> I'm going to play you a song.<eos> Sylvere: As unorthodox as this whole thing has been, it has brought me a deeper respect for love... its ingenuity and it's refusal to be categorized and set down to fossilize.
About what?<eos> Well, I know a secret.<eos> About you.<eos> And you can ask me as many questions as you like to figure it out.<eos> But you only get one guess as to what it is.
Thank you.<eos> _<eos> Reid: It's not possible.<eos> Even if you are pregnant, the baby's not mine.<eos> Except for the part where it is.
Don't fumble it now.<eos> You're at the one-yard line.<eos> You're not pregnant with my child.<eos> You got pregnant with Wilkins to put me in as compromised a position as possible.<eos> But it should be mine.
You're at the one-yard line.<eos> You're not pregnant with my child.<eos> You got pregnant with Wilkins to put me in as compromised a position as possible.<eos> But it should be mine.<eos> I wish it were mine.
So we went inside of the building and sat there.<eos> And that's where we met that guy, Gates.<eos> Before that, we had been on Periscope every day for several hours, and that day was no exception.<eos> My video was about 3-4 hours long.<eos> It depicted our entire day.
Come on.<eos> Sometimes I'm anxious to get online.<eos> You know, like, "Are people gonna like me today?"<eos> -We're playin' a game. -Hey. If you guys wanna play.<eos> It's hit-and-miss.
Let's go.<eos> -Have him face this way, though.<eos> -Okay. -It's not comfortable.<eos> -[Tony] Just for some--<eos> -It looks great, though. -[Tony] Yeah, it looks great.
[Donny] What's that?<eos> Another motorcycle? -No, I might buy a boat.<eos> Send me a picture of it first.<eos> He's sending me a picture of it.<eos> Is it a rowboat?
Another motorcycle? -No, I might buy a boat.<eos> Send me a picture of it first.<eos> He's sending me a picture of it.<eos> Is it a rowboat?<eos> No, it's an 18-foot boat. -Oh.
Regardless of the fact that I'm 40 years old, I don't know, I have this different mindset for my life.<eos> I want to thoroughly enjoy every moment.<eos> And if you ain't having fun in life, then you are doing this thing way wrong.<eos> My name is Jessica.<eos> Dating, it's awful. [chuckles] It's downright dirty awful.
Roger has a great understanding of the media. He understands politics and he understands politicians.<eos> And he always likes to take on somebody that at least has a good chance of winning, and sometimes it doesn't work out.<eos> He's had some people that I said, "What are you doing with these people?" But, you know...<eos> But he loves it and he loves the game.<eos> He has fun with it, and he's very good at it.
He had been through a lot, obviously, but I think he was just as resilient as ever.<eos> His greatest single quality is resilience.<eos> And that's the purpose of my tattoo.<eos> It's not an ideological statement.<eos> It's a reminder that in life, when you get knocked down, you have to get up off the canvas and keep pushing, get back in the game.
George, should the American people take the Reform Party seriously?<eos> Well, not if Donald Trump is their leader.<eos> Donald Trump is being supported by a fellow named Roger Stone, who is a longtime political activist who had worked for Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan.<eos> It looks to me like Pat Buchanan is going to get in the water, and a Trump-Buchanan race, it'd be a great race.<eos> It's unexpected.
All right, well... you need anything else?<eos> What is it?<eos> Paige says that she loves me, but I don't know if I love her.<eos> And Zahid says you just know, but I don't just know.<eos> And there's so much new stuff in my life, and I don't like new stuff unless it's exactly like the old stuff, but everything is new... dancing, love, Olive Garden.
I had some free time.<eos> I thought I'd see what you were doing.<eos> Here are some questions that I have.<eos> What exactly is a never-ending pasta bowl?<eos> It must end somewhere.
[Hannah] A rumor based on a kiss ruined a memory I hoped would be special.<eos> In fact, it ruined just about everything.
As a society we tend to shy away from these hard topics.<eos> Sometimes in cinema we do that, too.<eos> This is great because it says, "No.<eos> This is a problem and it needs to be addressed."<eos> [Asher] The whole issue of suicide is an uncomfortable thing to talk about, but it happens, so we have to talk about it.
We're storytellers, and our job, probably more than anything, is to entertain.<eos> But you get a piece of material like this that's about something, you know, you take that seriously, and-- and you really hope the discussion begins and will continue.<eos> [Yorkey] We wanted to begin by telling the truth about what effect these events would have.<eos> We felt like if we could tell a story, not only with integrity, but hopefully one that had a chance to really resonate with young people who don't necessarily get a steady diet of truth in their entertainment,<eos> [Langford] With the photo that's taken of Hannah, it was innocent, but an unflattering photo out of context, posted by a guy with a particular rep, or saying something, or spinning the story some kind of way can destroy someone.
She can't go around and personally remedy it for everyone.<eos> [Boe] It's definitely a generational thing because my whole middle and high school, when we got home, all we would do is hop on, either it was Myspace, Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram.<eos> So, that's our whole world, is our school, and then social media.<eos> So, that's why when you're being cyberbullied, you're being attacked by so many people who are hiding behind, you know, a computer screen.<eos> [Dr. Hu] Adults don't realize how much cyberbullying is hurtful because it didn't exist when people my age were younger, and cyberbullying doesn't end when the school bell rings.
He's a popular guy, he's an athlete, and that it's so common for a victim to feel like, "No one would ever believe me."<eos> Bryces exist.<eos> They exist on every single campus, and in every facet... of life, and I think there's an immense amount of misinformation for young men around what consent even is.<eos> That's the disconnect in how we're poorly educating men and young women, and how we're failing them, because we're not educating them on what real consent actually looks like.<eos> [Flynn] It just needs to be a part of a conversation.
- Roasted Guinea pig. - Huh?<eos> - They blowtorch the hair right off of it.<eos> - It's like the national dish of Peru.<eos> - Did...<eos> - Or is it Ecuador?
Fair enough.<eos> Right.<eos> Okay, how's my face look?<eos> It's good.<eos> How's it feel?
Check the publisher and year of publication.<eos> Farraday, 1963.<eos> The original publisher was the other company that Mr. Keating mentioned, Turnleaf Books.<eos> And that book is no mere how-to.<eos> It is, in fact, widely considered to be the magician's bible.
I'll get dressed.<eos> No need.<eos> Look in the folder.<eos> The storage unit which held the records was gutted by a fire a decade ago.<eos> It was confirmed as arson, but a culprit was never identified.
You told him he'd regret it if he didn't back off.<eos> Yeah, I did.<eos> But there's a big hole in your theory.<eos> Why would I kill a guy over a book when I could just go buy another copy?<eos> Because the book you wanted is rare, and, for obvious reasons, it was discontinued after the Second World War.
It's where Fred Astaire would go before shooting every dance number he ever did.<eos> To throw up.<eos> Yes.<eos> How charming.<eos> It was, actually. In its own way.
- No, I'm just curious. - Some of it must still be a surprise.<eos> But, what are we going to do at the cafe?<eos> Just drink coffee and enjoy ourselves? Or is something happening?<eos> It's nothing dangerous.<eos> It's just a cafe.
Is. I'm sorry.<eos> She, um, disappeared... a few days ago.<eos> She ran away.<eos> She had a hard life.<eos> And, yes, I am taking it personally.
And how will you explain to the board why you refused to recoup our costs on a dead picture?<eos> You would do this to me?<eos> I agreed this afternoon.<eos> Pat, thank you for the gift.<eos> It's not a gift.
To these phenomenal things?<eos> Would I have given up?<eos> I gave up.<eos> I gave up my homosexuality for much less.<eos> My desire for men was something so shocking to me that it, probably, made me want to be a woman.
That if you put your heads together, you'll figure out a solution to your predicament and maybe even come to realize that Rae's experiment isn't so deranged after all.<eos> Whoa. What a cool charm bracelet.<eos> I've never seen one like it.<eos> Thanks. I made it myself.<eos> It's a constant reminder of things I love.
Have a drink.<eos> It's on me.<eos> I have a question.<eos> I heard this car was sold here.<eos> It's a black Azera, 51GA 3458.
Cut it out, Ramón.<eos> Weed, how much?<eos> Blow.<eos> I like my plants better, Chapo.<eos> They're cheaper. But it won't last.

Coming round, there's somebody in the way.<eos> Cyclists everywhere.<eos> Typical French.<eos> But on a circuit made up mostly of public road, the race retains some of its peculiarities, and a sense of danger.<eos> It's challenge that's drawn F1 legends like Derek Bell, and Jacky Ickx, but because it's open to amateur drivers has also lured Hollywood stars like Oscar winner Paul Newman, who famously finished 2nd overall in 1979,
That's a big blow for Bart and the team.<eos> There's an element of "Shit."<eos> Your first thought is just to assess the driver's situation.<eos> Is he okay? Is he hurt?<eos> We're hearing they are going to try and get that car at the garage under its own power, just trying to keep it in the race.
We've got engine adaption engineers, gearbox engineers, aerodynamic guys, suspension guys, engine guys...<eos> They'll be analyzing this data live which I then pass back to the drivers to make setting changes on the car.<eos> On the steering wheel itself we've got lots of different switches, and these can change all sorts of things on the car.<eos> We can change engine mappings, we can change hybrid mappings.<eos> These fully optimize the car to make sure it's running in the sweet spot.
But if I got it back, there was a chance we could get it back out.<eos> I had a few hairy moments on the way but managed to... To get it back to the pits.<eos> Well, when it rains it pours for Nissan's new LMP1 fleet.<eos> The number 23 car has ground to a halt now at Arnage, driven by Olivier Pla. And marshals in attendance with fire extinguishers.<eos> It is smoldering gently.
This offer's not just good. It's too good.<eos> What're you talking about?<eos> - You think they're not gonna pay?<eos> - I mean this isn't the number you give to make someone go away.<eos> It's a number you give when you need them to go away.
All I want is for your wedding to be exactly what you want.<eos> And what I want is gonna take some time, because, dad, you were right.<eos> I want to...<eos> Enjoy it and make time for it.<eos> So Mike and I are gonna set a date, but it's not gonna be for a while.
I did get in touch with Cathy's cousins in Pennsylvania who were initially pleasant, but sort of said, "We've had enough pain, leave us alone.<eos> We don't have anything to tell you." We sort of respected that.<eos> We wanted to try to get in touch with the family to ask them:<eos> "Does green mean something?<eos> Was it the bride's favorite color?
I never knew it.<eos> We never, ever once discussed it.<eos> Did you hear the interview?<eos> You've heard it?<eos> So, you hear how it plagued my brother also.
He went back to the back room... and he handed me... her vagina.<eos> And he said, "You need to understand, we're going after somebody viciously."<eos> And he was justifying his roughness with me.<eos> So, it was a picture of her vagina?<eos> It was a black... No, no.
And he was justifying his roughness with me.<eos> So, it was a picture of her vagina?<eos> It was a black... No, no.<eos> The vagina was wrapped in newspaper.<eos> So, it was...
If there's nothing, tell us that.<eos> Just don't put us in a closet and hope we go away one day.<eos> Thank you, Mr. Chair, Madam Vice-Chair, members of the committee.<eos> This bill was, uh... Been back and forth in front of this body since about 2003.<eos> For some reason, this bill has been interpreted to be an attack on religious organizations and it's died repeatedly.
That was pretty good.<eos> And then in the summertime, he went to camp and blossomed and was a star and was, like, everything he wanted to be.<eos> And so, parents, they just think...<eos> You know, he just thought, "No, camp is great.<eos> It will define her. It will be her joy.

- June?<eos> It just was June.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> I love it so much.<eos> It's not perfect.
- And you trying to do the right thing doesn't change the fact that you gave your word.<eos> - Rachel...<eos> We've been through enough for you to know that I'm still gonna love you in the morning, but you have to ask yourself:<eos> What is your word worth?<eos> 'Cause with the way things are going, it's not gonna be worth very much.
Are you still going?<eos> I don't even have a dress.<eos> I might be able to help you there.<eos> I wore it for my school dance.<eos> It was the most beautiful thing I'd ever seen.
Okay, come on.<eos> Come on, phone.<eos> Come on.<eos> Mom! Mom, the phone's ringing.<eos> It's not gonna ring all day.
Thinking they'll make less noise, whereas this will make so much more noise.<eos> Really, indulge the crinkle as you undress your Swedish Fish, the Lamborghini of the gummies.<eos> Or perhaps you brought yourself a Werther's Original, the AMBER Alert of caramels.<eos> Now, those of you familiar with our oeuvre, which means eggs, will recognize this play.<eos> It's a little more autobiographical than our other plays.
- Oh, Hello.<eos> We draw on 70 years of a life lived.<eos> A first job, a second marriage.<eos> When you open your cab door into a city biker as a silent protest against Mayor De Blasio.<eos> It's a play about those emotional moments in life, like when you get a multi-vitamin caught in your throat and it burns so bad that you bail on your daughter's wedding.
That guy is sick as a dick.<eos> - Audiences like to be screamed at.<eos> - Correct.<eos> The backbone of contemporary American theater is screaming stuff.<eos> For starters, it wakes the audience up towards the end of the third act.

- Porcupine please.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> Is there a center mark for me to stand?<eos> OK, that'll do.<eos> Ravi, can you write a "G" on that so I know it's for George and not Gil?
Late! Late!<eos> Ravi, late! Excuse me.<eos> As soon as he says "1960's," you come in fast with the groovy music.<eos> Ravi, you got to hit that cue or he's gonna go bananas.<eos> No, no, I'll go banana bread on you, and it will be too dry to swallow.
- I don't want to go there now.<eos> - You could be deported very quickly.<eos> - You know, Trump is doing a remake.<eos> - Oh, he is?<eos> Yeah, it's called No Amigos.
- Is that your new novel?<eos> - This?<eos> No.<eos> A new play I'm working on.<eos> Frankly, it's about me and you.
George, this is the best play I've ever read.<eos> Thank you.<eos> - I guess I just have one question.<eos> - Of course.<eos> How does it end?
No. A robot, maybe?<eos> [gasps] Doctor, that object is emitting radio signals.<eos> Is it, really?<eos> [thunder crashing] [gasps]<eos> [Françoise] Wait a minute. It's only around this farm.
How embarrassing will it be if we show up to the reunion and we're still just hangin' out?<eos> When are we gonna take the next step?<eos> Mark, you know how important maintaining my independence is.<eos> You mean maintaining that flea-trap studio down in the Village.<eos> - Well, it's my flea trap. - [sighs]
I want to thank Grand Rapids, Michigan, for making me a fighter, and New York City making me a man.<eos> I hope, through this, I inspire people that hard work can get you anywhere in life.<eos> Balcony looks pretty good to me.<eos> This is a property that I bought.<eos> The house is shitty right now, but I own it.
I said, "I'm not scared to fight, I'm not even scared to lay down.<eos> The only thing I'm scared of is to see how many people that's here for me right now, in this moment, after I lost, disappear."<eos> The only thing I could do is go back to the gym, reassess myself with my team and try our best in the next go round.<eos> Two years in the life of American boxing will teach you a lot about the sport's issues and problems... but mostly about its champions.<eos> Boxing has never been a perfect sport and it never will be.

Did you get through?<eos> - Everything's in place, boss.<eos> - Hello, boss.<eos> Let's get the money and leave for El Salvador.<eos> Put it here.
Now lose it again.<eos> That shirt is terrible, bro.<eos> It's not even shiny.<eos> I love it.<eos> It's 100% cotton, which is my favorite percentage of cotton.
That shirt is terrible, bro.<eos> It's not even shiny.<eos> I love it.<eos> It's 100% cotton, which is my favorite percentage of cotton.<eos> And it has eight Antarctic whales on it, which is higher than I've seen on any other shirt.
Okay, wow!<eos> That just happened, didn't it?<eos> What kind of bush-league power play are you trying to pull here?<eos> You get me up in front of these kids, and you try to show me up in my theater?<eos> It is not your theater.
Oh, by the way. Have you read this?<eos> THE EASYGOING MESSIAH BY YUZU HANAKI<eos> Oh, is that his new book?<eos> Yes.<eos> It became a million-seller on its fourth day.
There is nothing wrong with that.<eos> AYANE HIROKAWA<eos> What do you think of that celeb-on-celeb interview?<eos> What do I think?<eos> It's disgusting.
Hey, come on!<eos> Why are you so negative?<eos> Help me out, here.<eos> The cover is gloomy.<eos> It doesn't stand out.
Novel.<eos> Yes?<eos> Is your new book selling?<eos> I'm not sure.<eos> It was sold out when I looked in the bookstore.
I'm not sure.<eos> It was sold out when I looked in the bookstore.<eos> Really?<eos> That's fantastic, Michi!<eos> I doubt that it was sold out.
It has been announced!<eos> PRESS<eos> It was unanimous and overwhelming.<eos> We committee members were overjoyed to come across a masterpiece like this for the significant 50th anniversary of the prize.<eos> Though the winning work, Drifting Emotions , has the word "emotions" in the title, there is no single emotional expression in it.
Isn't that great?<eos> Lots of people are reading it.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Aren't you happy?<eos> It's not selling because it's interesting.
The number of mysterious women was reduced to four, and our odd lifestyle instantly became extraordinary again.<eos> The fire occurred at the home of the novelist Shin Michima.<eos> EPISODE 10 DISBANDED<eos> The deceased woman appears to have been living with Mr. Michima.<eos> According to the neighbor who reported the fire, it started on the first floor and spread quickly.
Form sword!<eos> Keep Voltron engaged until the cargo ship is out of range.<eos> Do not be drawn in.<eos> The sword strike is his most deadly blow.<eos> [growls] It's too quick!
Oh, I hate the klygarg.<eos> How do I get on it again?<eos> [male 2] Enter your password.<eos> -[male 1] Right. What's my password?<eos> -I don't know! It's your password!
Honerva has really softened you up, my friend.<eos> I never thought I'd see the day the great warrior Emperor Zarkon was married, to an Altean alchemist, no less.<eos> Honerva, working hard as always.<eos> Many thanks for the gift.<eos> Allura loves it.
This is where things become more interesting.<eos> Altean alchemy can accomplish some incredible feats of engineering, as you know.<eos> But in testing my ship, I started to feel some sort of psychic link.<eos> I'm not sure how to explain it, but the ship wasn't just reading my mind.<eos> It was communicating with me.
Did you put something on it?<eos> Yeah, Neosporin.<eos> It was expired, but...<eos> That stuff doesn't expire.<eos> It just gets less effective the more it sits around.
Take it.<eos> Take it with you.<eos> It's a hard thing you have to do.<eos> Yes.<eos> We leave this village as it is.
I knew you'd ask that.<eos> But listen well, because I'm only going to tell this story once.<eos> I was a good girl, strictly raised and betrothed to Joseph.<eos> When one morning my room filled with light.<eos> It was white light like the sun, but with no heat or pain.
But listen well, because I'm only going to tell this story once.<eos> I was a good girl, strictly raised and betrothed to Joseph.<eos> When one morning my room filled with light.<eos> It was white light like the sun, but with no heat or pain.<eos> It was pure like the air itself was glowing.
A majestic, gravity defying mix of power... balance and dare-devil courage.<eos> And more than a few bruises.<eos> As Icarus and Sir Isaac Newton both discovered... what goes up must come down.<eos> In the world famous training camp at Garmisch in Germany... you will find the world's elite ski-jumpers.<eos> ...such as the Flying Finn, Matti Nykänen, showing how it's really done.
His disciples followed him like sheep.<eos> Seduced by false doctrine.<eos> And he stole the forbidden ritual, right?<eos> Yes.<eos> What did it do?
Mordo, the London sanctum has fallen.<eos> The New York one has been attacked twice.<eos> You know where they're going next.<eos> Hong Kong.<eos> You told me once to fight like my life depended on it... Because one day, it might.
I'm sorry.<eos> That book you're holding is utter nonsense.<eos> I don't even know how you got that.<eos> I thought I burned both copies.<eos> It's on Amazon.
Along with a ghost emoji now, thank you very much,<eos> - that does a little dance.<eos> - You know what?<eos> That book was our baby.<eos> And you abandoned that baby before it even learned to fly!
Erin, if you don't believe in this stuff anymore, then why were you looking for the book?<eos> A man came to see me at my work saying his building was haunted.<eos> What building?<eos> The Aldridge Mansion.<eos> It's obviously a joke.
I mean, it's, like, coincidence.<eos> Also, I got chased by a ghost.<eos> What?<eos> You know, up above us was the old New York prison.<eos> It's the first place in New York that they electrocuted people.
Right away.<eos> Please, all of you.<eos> Fernando was down here when something crawled out of a wall vent, and...<eos> I heard him screaming, so I went to check, and that's when the "thing" was tossing Fernando all around the room.<eos> I thought it was gonna kill him.
I could see that.<eos> Anyway, if you could just mosey around, you'll probably bump into it.<eos> 'Kay, girls?<eos> All right.<eos> Well, we know it's down here somewhere.
I know it's out.<eos> - So it's hard to put the cat back in.<eos> - It's not impossible.<eos> - But that's why they have that saying.<eos> - It's a nonsense saying.
You found my pipe.<eos> I got it at the dumpster yesterday.<eos> I'm gonna use it to make a proton shotgun.<eos> Pretty cool, right?<eos> If it doesn't work, we can just swing it around and break stuff, so it's kind of a win-win.
- Well...<eos> What did you do, Kevin?<eos> I did a lot, actually.<eos> I'll have you know that I walked over to the power box, pushed a bunch of buttons.<eos> Everything got sucked into the portal, then it closed up.
Where is it?<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> I told you what happened.<eos> Where's the car?<eos> - It's on the other side.
I forgot to introduce.<eos> This is my mentor, Dr. Rebecca Gorin.<eos> This is reckless, Jillian.<eos> All someone has to do is sneeze too hard and everyone in this building is going to disintegrate.<eos> It's completely unstable.
Maybe you should just leave it in there. Maybe you shouldn't shake it like that.<eos> What, it's gonna make the pee go in there.<eos> No, it doesn't work like that. That's not a Polaroid.<eos> I'm gonna be the best auntie, ever.<eos> I'm gonna give that kid whatever it wants.
Hmm. Considerin' I just read the Japanese let a fellow marry his own pillow, I tend to agree with you.<eos> - Much worse is on its way.<eos> - Pillows?<eos> That's a slippery slope.<eos> Indeed it is.
I just did.<eos> Twice. Hmm.<eos> So, you're gonna keep goin' with this preacher thing, huh?<eos> How's that workin' out for you?<eos> It's good.
'Cause we're hitting each other with a lot worse things than bones, boyo.<eos> No, seriously.<eos> Listen to me now.<eos> Misery loves company, does it not?<eos> It's the hope that sets men at one another's throats here.
I'm sorry, Mr. Bob.<eos> But what is "boom"?<eos> Boom... Uh...<eos> Grow.<eos> You gotta understand that Bob's a gardener, and he sprinkles a little water on the money, and all of a sudden it blooms.
No.<eos> Ospina.<eos> It's a nice-looking ring.<eos> What's that, a coca leaf?<eos> You know, most of the assholes I meet think it's a maple leaf.
And there are a lot of folks with noses.<eos> God gave us free will, so who am I to stand in the way of someone who wants to indulge in self-destructive behavior.<eos> - Salud.<eos> - Oh, thank you.<eos> The politicians think it's a drug war, shoot them up, Dirty Harry, but I say it's a business like any other.
And for the first time in my life, I don't feel alone.<eos> We weren't supposed to find each other.<eos> But we did.<eos> He makes me feel like my life isn't over.<eos> Like it's just beginning.
My welcome speech used to be full of euphemisms like...<eos> "This may hurt a little." "This may cause you some discomfort."<eos> But I've grown blunt.<eos> This workshop is not a government-led program.<eos> It's a private institution that turns reclamation projects like yourself... into men of extraordinary abilities.
Any suggestions?<eos> Well, you want to name it something child-friendly.<eos> Child-friendly?<eos> Really?<eos> Because it's a toy, that's what you're saying.
Gas, air, injections, morphine.<eos> Bridget, remember your yoga.<eos> - To hell with yoga.<eos> I totally agree.<eos> It's supposed to be relaxing ... but I'm busy all the time to tighten my sphincter so I will not fart.
You've turned into catastrophes triumphs ... with your pure, joyful, indefatigable, contagious zest for life.<eos> You have this pregnancy almost accomplished on your own ... despite one insane mother, oppressed women and cheating boyfriends who do not deserve you.<eos> Just a moment.<eos> Just a moment, dear, and we see your beautiful baby.<eos> What if it's not yours?
You're right about that.<eos> I think the Lord put you here because he wants me to get something off my chest. He wants me to clear my conscience and he wants me to ask for forgiveness.<eos> Robert. What I did to you at that rally in senior year was a cowardly act. It's something that I've regretted every single day.<eos> Yeah. I mean, bullying is a national crisis.<eos> It can leave people with a lifetime of pain.
What the hell is going on?<eos> Okay, listen, listen.<eos> I've been a fool. All right?<eos> I thought that my life was a failure. I thought that it wasn't special.<eos> But it is special. It's special because I have you in it.
- He has been a little...<eos> Who you bragging to?<eos> And this used to be called Blair?<eos> Sort of.<eos> There was a town called Blair back in the 1700s, but it was discovered abandoned.
-The computer's not working today.<eos> -You don't have one working computer?<eos> -You don't have one copy of your book?<eos> -It's a virtual book.<eos> -Ah, then it's not a real book. -No, it's real.
-You don't have one copy of your book?<eos> -It's a virtual book.<eos> -Ah, then it's not a real book. -No, it's real.<eos> It's real, okay?<eos> It's just online.
I opened it for you. It's not a big thing.<eos> Stay close to them.<eos> Let me know when it is done.<eos> Tonight... we take back our country.<eos> It's my country.
I don't even have things.<eos> I... I don't have things. I don't even have a home.<eos> And what about this house?<eos> This?<eos> It's awfully cold.
And you were a mother to all of us, and that's a very good story.<eos> The entire country watched the funeral from beginning to end.<eos> Decades from now, people will remember your dignity and the majesty.<eos> They'll remember you.<eos> It will serve a definite purpose.
She wants them to always remember, for one brief, shining moment, there was a...<eos> Yeah, Camelot.<eos> I hope you have a good night, Mrs. Kennedy.<eos> He wrote down every word.<eos> Did it help heal you?
Yeah, Camelot.<eos> I hope you have a good night, Mrs. Kennedy.<eos> He wrote down every word.<eos> Did it help heal you?<eos> It's been reprinted all over the world.
You can thank me later.<eos> Hell, I'll thank you right now.<eos> We just lost bomber 9... and bomber 13, sir.<eos> Command, we can't get to the top of the ship.<eos> It's too heavily armed.
What about our car?<eos> We'll get a new one when you get your license.<eos> On the bus, everybody!<eos> Tell the General we're up and running.<eos> Bring it in.
I don't know. He just... he said that he wanted to come home.<eos> Oh, now he wants to come home now that he's knocked up some homeless girl!<eos> Hey!<eos> I am not homeless, okay?<eos> I'm just sleeping in my van, but a window's broken, and it's not a safe place for a baby.
No one knows how to do it, but you ask.<eos> Well, I've never had anyone to ask.<eos> Well, don't eat the grass. Don't eat the grass.<eos> I guess I shouldn't knock it before I try it.<eos> It's not good.
I'm the mother, not a suspect.<eos> Unfortunately, Mrs. Ford, we need to consider all possibilities.<eos> It's my job to determine how you planned for the safety of this child.<eos> Is that your first kid?<eos> No, it's my third.
We know you can not read.<eos> You're stupid. You can not read.<eos> Day, kid. We are finally in the land of camels.<eos> I wrote you about.<eos> The sea is as blue as in Bandol. It's so hot that diving barely cools.
Guys, she's going rogue!<eos> But being here with you today... Makes me realize that true happiness is possible.<eos> It is!<eos> True happiness is a lot closer than you think.<eos> It's right here.
Come on, eat!<eos> Eat!<eos> No!<eos> Happiness isn't something you put inside.<eos> It's already there.
Wait.<eos> You can actually understand me?<eos> And I can actually understand you?<eos> The bath salts are showing me the real world.<eos> It's fucking lifted the veil of non-reality!
Thank you.<eos> No, not about that. Although hacker college does sound awesome.<eos> It's AnywAir.<eos> I've been doing it wrong.<eos> I... I've been treating the power grid as if it was a seamless source of Internet. It's not seamless, it's messy.
Power's still on.<eos> Yeah, I'm honestly shocked by that.<eos> No Internet yet, though.<eos> It could take a few seconds.<eos> If it works, you'll have a connection alert. -No.
- Who's Armand?<eos> - Their boy.<eos> Boy?<eos> - Bianca has a child?<eos> - It's not hers. It's Alex's kid.
Our family home. Three hours south of Tel Aviv.<eos> Felix seems to love it.<eos> He loves the sea.<eos> Me, I do not like it much myself.<eos> There is something idiotic about it.
Fuck!<eos> Have we found Gabe Welch?<eos> Uh, no, we're still looking.<eos> What about Michael Atwood?<eos> Uh, I got units placed outside his place, but it's empty.
Sure, he was a mouth-breathing, snot dripping 8-year-old who couldn't find his fat ass with both hands, but he was clueless enough to think<eos> I wasn't the worthless piece of shit everybody else thinks I am.<eos> Including me. I also found what was the closest thing I ever had to an actual girlfriend.<eos> She liked the job I had at the time, especially while I was in uniform.<eos> Sounds like a happy ending, don't it? - But, you see...
- Is she still burning?<eos> - There's still flow, Mr. Jimmy.<eos> Oh, come on. Please.<eos> Please!<eos> It's still burning, Mr. Jimmy. We gotta go.
Hardly see you these days.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I'm just super busy at work.<eos> I told you, this project is like the biggest thing we've ever done.<eos> It's killing me.
I'm sure.<eos> I am sure.<eos> Where's my dress?<eos> What's wrong with that?<eos> Simon will love it.
- Sorry about this!<eos> - No!<eos> My bad.<eos> Congratulations!<eos> It's a boy!
Hey!<eos> That's my toothbrush!<eos> Get it out!<eos> All right, class, thought for the day.<eos> Water is the softest thing, yet it can penetrate mountains and earth.
Very stern views on good and evil, which I share.<eos> Evil is evil, not rooted in a social circumstance.<eos> Not about being deprived.<eos> Not even controlled by God.<eos> It's an entirely separate human force.
Arms in the Sudan, billions.<eos> Female trafficking, billions.<eos> An eighth of the world's fucking economy black as black. We all know that.<eos> Blood money.<eos> That's all it is.
Female trafficking, billions.<eos> An eighth of the world's fucking economy black as black. We all know that.<eos> Blood money.<eos> That's all it is.<eos> It can be in a box under a drug lord's bed or in a city bank next to the vintage port. It doesn't change colour. It's still blood money.
We need to be fucking thugs, you understand?<eos> Understood.<eos> All right, good.<eos> Let's kill this shit.<eos> But it was a complete disaster.
Okay?<eos> Turkish.<eos> Made in Turkey.<eos> Not anymore.<eos> Now it's an Albanian towel.
You might as well go get a hat, Papo.<eos> What did he say?<eos> He says he'd like you to consider taking a hat with ya, that's all.<eos> Get some sleep.<eos> Whaddya know about this weather, it's killin' me and young Eldon here?
This black powder.<eos> It turns air into fire.<eos> And kills a dozen men at one time.<eos> - It is a weapon of our dreams.<eos> - What if it's just a myth?
General, it goes all the way through.<eos> Tao Tei have breached the wall.<eos> They're smarter than we thought.<eos> - Summon my commanders immediately! - Yes, General!<eos> Have a look. See if it's gone out.
If you want, I'll put you on his trail.<eos> - This dirty skunk is lying!<eos> - No, no, I'm not!<eos> - Do you know his hideout?<eos> - It's just over a mile from here, up the Madrona Canyada.

When I was a senior in high school, I wanted this special dress for prom.<eos> I told myself that spending $100 on a trashy dress that I was gonna wear one time to an event that I thought was silly in the first place, was...<eos> - Wasteful.<eos> - Yes. But Vera Wang made this black, strapless classic.<eos> It was more expensive, but you could wear it to all kinds of future events.
I let everything it slip away.<eos> No!<eos> "Bennie, sorry I had to take off.<eos> Don't take it personally.<eos> I'm leaving you this phone because I think it might be of use.
Give me the phone.<eos> We can do this the hard way... if you'd prefer.<eos> Sure. Let's do this the hard way.<eos> Captain Tang, the phone has proof. Victor Wong is the Matador.<eos> It can only be unlocked by his thumbprint.

So the guy I replace went Section 8.<eos> Why?<eos> Does it matter?<eos> I heard it's 'cause this squad's so bad he was afraid you'd get him killed when the 5th Wave hits.<eos> It's your squad, too, now.
You did good in school, had a bunch of friends.<eos> You probably played football.<eos> You might have even been team captain.<eos> Life was easy.<eos> And then, all of a sudden, it wasn't.
I swore if I made it home, I would never follow orders again.<eos> I left a soldier. I came home an outlaw.<eos> I lived one robbery to the next.<eos> A good day was filled by sleep, and a good night spent running too hard to look back.<eos> I lived that life for 10 years until it caught up to me.
Yeah. Yeah, I probably should have said something.<eos> She's got two more little ones in her left boot.<eos> It's no longer important.<eos> If your face is the last thing that I'm meant to see, then I'm grateful.<eos> It should be the last thing you see.
Tell me about it.<eos> My gosh! You'd think in a neighborhood like this you wouldn't have to worry about something like that.<eos> I'm so sorry about that, Tim.<eos> Yeah, well, Jeff, here's the thing about trust.<eos> Once it's gone, bad things happen.
No, no. Let him be. Let him be.<eos> Early birthday present.<eos> What?<eos> Wanna look? Yes!<eos> What is it?
- No, I wouldn't miss it.<eos> - For you.<eos> A hunting horn.<eos> From the skull of a ram that flattened 10 gods slower than me.<eos> It's beautiful. Yeah?
- Don't I mean enough to you?<eos> Be a dear and fetch me some clean water.<eos> Would it kill you to say "please"?<eos> I'm really not in the mood to argue.<eos> Go get it for me.
Ha! I have it!<eos> Its mystery.<eos> Its essence.<eos> Its truth.<eos> It's lettuce!
You intend to get that reward?<eos> - That depends.<eos> Got a business proposition for you.<eos> Well, does this business involve her?<eos> Yes, it does.
You asked me why I wanted to save a piece of rebel trash like you, and I told you the war was over.<eos> - But it ain't over, Sam.<eos> - Yes, it is.<eos> No, it isn't. No, the killing's not over.<eos> It keeps going on and on and on.
And the palace is mine since father's death, I'm the oldest.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> As a member you voted to cancel the rule of the oldest.<eos> So my children have an equal right to inheritance of Montmirail just like you!<eos> Don't let it embarrass your political career!
I'm hungry!<eos> For 25 sous you pay my way, I hope.<eos> At the table, one does not talk about money.<eos> - I don't see them anymore.<eos> Boil the meat properly, don't want any worms in it!
We're doing something.<eos> Come on.<eos> You ready?<eos> Get ready for the most spectacular standing-piss in human history.<eos> - It's not gonna work. I promise you.
Come on.<eos> You ready?<eos> Get ready for the most spectacular standing-piss in human history.<eos> - It's not gonna work. I promise you.<eos> - Oh, it's gonna work.
- Finding Nemo.<eos> - How much?<eos> - Sykes!<eos> Aren't you a little old for that, soldier?<eos> No, Sarge, it's for...
- How much?<eos> - Sykes!<eos> Aren't you a little old for that, soldier?<eos> No, Sarge, it's for...<eos> It's for my daughter.
Like his soul or...<eos> I don't know.<eos> Billy.<eos> Most of the time, that's how it works.<eos> Life gets so dark, and we think all the light's gone out of us, but it's always there.
You think we should?<eos> The hell are they gonna do, Billy, send us to Iraq?<eos> What's that all about?<eos> - Norm's fancy-ass new stadium.<eos> - It's huge.
We feel like we've already got enough risk in our lives.<eos> Now, I understand that 100,000 might have been an overly optimistic number, but after all they've been through, my men don't deserve to be stuck in somebody's bottom line.<eos> Now, if you can just find it in your heart...<eos> Sergeant Dime, my offer stands.<eos> Now, it may not be as much as you fellas were hoping for, but from what I hear, it's the only offer you've got.
This is worldwide. It is happening right now.<eos> Okay.<eos> That's... Class is dismissed.<eos> For now, we're simply asking for cooperation while authorities assess the object.<eos> So, you're saying it's not ours?
Okay.<eos> That's... Class is dismissed.<eos> For now, we're simply asking for cooperation while authorities assess the object.<eos> So, you're saying it's not ours?<eos> Do you even know if it's from Earth?
January looks forward to the new year and back to the old.<eos> And this island looks in the direction of two different oceans.<eos> You're going to make our baby so clever.<eos> How do you know it's just one?<eos> Maybe it's twins. Or triplets.
Get the baby to the house.<eos> Where have you been?<eos> Where have you been?<eos> You're safe now. There. You're safe now.<eos> It's a girl.
Give her a chance to catch her breath.<eos> It's all got to go in the log, sweetheart.<eos> You know I have to report everything straight away.<eos> What if the boat belongs to a ship?<eos> It's a dinghy, not a lifeboat.
I know you have all traveled over great distances today to celebrate a very special thing.<eos> The light.<eos> And I want to thank you all for coming here today to honor it.<eos> 40 years ago today, Janus light was first lit.<eos> And for 40 years it's been a beacon of security in the face of danger.
Is he okay?<eos> Many of you have...<eos> Your brothers, your sons, your fathers. Didn't come back from the war.<eos> I don't know why God picked me to survive it.<eos> I don't know what right I have to be given life while it is taken from others.
Her father, a football player.<eos> Football!<eos> Ferocious, like Teresa.<eos> My cousin wants to know the opinion of a famous writer about her dress.<eos> Do you like it?
Do you like it?<eos> I don't know why...<eos> I drew it myself.<eos> Yeah, I...<eos> It's at the dressmaker's.
-No, Isabel.<eos> -No.<eos> No, you can't!<eos> My dress!<eos> It's my dress!
There are matters here... which might benefit from your attention.<eos> After my next voyage... you won't have to worry about anything.<eos> Am I permitted to worry about tonight?<eos> I do wish you'd worn that yellow dress.<eos> If it's good enough for the dowager empress of China... then it's good enough for the Ascots.
What'd he look like?<eos> He was dressed like a cowpoke except for the ski mask.<eos> I think he ran to a car that was parked out front of the diner.<eos> You saw the car?<eos> It was green.
You saw the car?<eos> It was green.<eos> How old?<eos> I don't know cars, mister.<eos> Well, was it a nice car or an okay car, or a real piece of shit?
It was green.<eos> How old?<eos> I don't know cars, mister.<eos> Well, was it a nice car or an okay car, or a real piece of shit?<eos> It was a real piece of shit.
Really?<eos> Mmm.<eos> It's been put in a trust.<eos> What's that mean?<eos> It means no one can sell it.
- The power's erratic. - Here, take this.<eos> Hey.<eos> You asked why I would turn against Umbrella, and I promised you an answer.<eos> Soon after the T-virus was released, a secret file was uploaded to my data stream.<eos> It was a recording of a meeting of the Umbrella high command dated 17 months before the viral outbreak occurred.
Come on! That's it!<eos> Follow me!<eos> Let's go.<eos> The bad seed returns.<eos> Or is it the prodigal daughter?
This is what you're after, yes? The antivirus.<eos> The cure to all this.<eos> Well, there's only one vial.<eos> And we're a half a mile underground in a sealed facility.<eos> I drop it here, the antivirus goes nowhere, and your hopeless dreams will die sooner rather than later.
I should have killed you in Washington. Yeah.<eos> He only has to evade you for another few minutes, and the last remaining human outposts will fall.<eos> We need an intercept path and the fastest way to the surface.<eos> Already done.<eos> If you release the antivirus, it will kill all organisms infected with the T-virus.
Try not to eat it all, okay?<eos> It's all we've got.<eos> This is very, very alarming...<eos> Is that my phone?<eos> You left it upstairs.
Those are words from your mother.<eos> "And unto 2,300 days, "then shall the sanctuary be cleansed."<eos> Mr Miller and those who listen to him suffer from a grand delusion.<eos> They claim that Jesus will return by a certain date. Yes, it's not the first time the end of the world has been prophesied by a fool.<eos> Nor will it be the last.
Your husband has had another stroke.<eos> - He's already much improv... - (JAMES MUMBLES)<eos> No, don't try now.<eos> You have facial paralysis.<eos> It's common after this kind of incident.
Peace doesn't work.<eos> So now you try a legion.<eos> That's not my choice.<eos> All they want from Rome is their land back.<eos> It was never their land.
So now you try a legion.<eos> That's not my choice.<eos> All they want from Rome is their land back.<eos> It was never their land.<eos> It belonged to you, the wealthy.
The Emperor doesn't heed my words as he did my father's.<eos> The sword must be removed from here at once.<eos> It is safest here, Shu Lien.<eos> Nothing is safe if West Lotus claims that sword.<eos> It must be taken to Wudang Temple, high up in the mountains.
Sir Te was honored by masters of pen and sword alike.<eos> If his house has need, men of the Iron Way should heed for the honor of his cause, not promise of riches.<eos> My friend is right.<eos> This warrant is not for you.<eos> And if I say it is?
He is Meng Si Zhao.<eos> Known as Silent Wolf in the west.<eos> He is Wei-Fang, who found his way back through the dark.<eos> She is Snow Vase, the warrior who fulfilled her vow... and brought redemption to the woman who raised her in the Iron Way.<eos> We take the sword to Wudang Mountain where it will be safe.
Mills, game time.<eos> Let's go!<eos> Take a look.<eos> What do we got this time?<eos> What does it look like?
Now if you had $200, what would you do?<eos> Fix the roof, or buy a TV?<eos> I'd buy a TV.<eos> And when the roof started to leak, if it needed fixing, I'd fix it.<eos> Where you gonna get your money from? You done spent it on a TV.
Alberta had the baby.<eos> Yeah?<eos> What she have?<eos> What is it?<eos> It's a girl.
They...<eos> They couldn't do nothing for her.<eos> What about the baby?<eos> Baby all right?<eos> They say it's healthy.
I can't.<eos> Tough.<eos> I need to see that face.<eos> I need to see that face of yours.<eos> Even if it is all pink and blotchy.
I'm not here to judge, Mr. Regan, I'm here to fix your problem.<eos> So, if you've touched a computer in the last five years i need to know when, where, and why.<eos> This might take a while.<eos> This fucking house.<eos> It means nothing to me.
- Take it apart, Mike.<eos> - Ah, damn it! Come on.<eos> We have to move quickly, Mr. Regan.<eos> Hey, where's my phone?<eos> Where is it? Where is my phone?
It's not a negotiation. ...stuff.<eos> Okay.<eos> A bed inside a sofa.<eos> That's neat.<eos> Well, it's old, but it's comfortable, so...
You know what I call that?<eos> A victory. I win.<eos> Whatever.<eos> Oh, it is comfortable.<eos> It's comfortable...
Max, it's the end of the line for me.<eos> Yes! Mmm...<eos> Why? Why?<eos> What's the matter, Maria?<eos> Maria, your face, it wears a thousand sorrows.
Who are you guys?<eos> Huh? Who are we? Who are we?<eos> We are the Flushed Pets...<eos> Thrown away by our owners and now we are out for revenge!<eos> It's like a club, but with biting and scratching.
If he wakes up, he could take out the whole town and everyone in it.<eos> Jack, he's a monster.<eos> It's not a monster.<eos> It's an animal.<eos> And it's hurt and it's scared.
- Hi.<eos> - Hi.<eos> I was just in the area and want to talk to you about Jesus.<eos> Have you ever thought to let the Lord in your heart?<eos> Yes, I know that the personal data, because it is my data.
Alles ok, slime?<eos> You know that some people fall in love with their cars.<eos> I am in love with a robot.<eos> Rodney has my car more and more loved than me.<eos> It's a really nice car.
These people depend on us!<eos> First off, it's always summer.<eos> We live in a desert.<eos> And second, that promise is still in effect!<eos> It's a 100% valid promise, and you can redeem it in one hour.
Not this time.<eos> Are you sure, Victor?<eos> He looks awfully dangerous.<eos> Teleport me to the ship.<eos> It's impossible, sir. It's shielded.
Get in here now!<eos> Uh, please.<eos> You're not going to believe this. We finally decoded the Deplanetizer plans.<eos> We found his next target.<eos> It's Umbris.
Happy travels, my ass.<eos> We ain't going nowhere.<eos> Answer that phone.<eos> It's not my phone.<eos> It's in your pocket.
Use the bathroom downstairs. Get down there.<eos> Okay, I need you to go over to the window and open it.<eos> Okay, I see it.<eos> I see it. I see it.<eos> Okay. All right, it's open.
The third cylinder wasn't firing.<eos> - Remember that, Nangi? - No.<eos> You didn't happen to catch the license plate number, did you?<eos> Oh, for sure.<eos> It was 2-9...
Besides, I think we got it.<eos> We got it up there, thank you, Yakety-yak!<eos> You laid it all out beautifully. What?<eos> Are you looking for the serum?<eos> Well, it's right here.
What does a rock have to do with homeland security?<eos> Homeland security?<eos> No, no, no, ma'am, planetary security.<eos> The fragment is of a radioactive xenomineral.<eos> We suspected it might have bio-interactions, so we took the sample to AMRIID,
Not that there's likely to be a next generation.<eos> Thank you, sir.<eos> This is every call made from the Russian's phone.<eos> Two mentions of business with the White Portuguese.<eos> And it's continually transmitting blacked-out data to the personal residence of Alexander Luthor.
The end.<eos> Uh...<eos> The word "philanthropist" comes from the Greek.<eos> Meaning a lover of humanity.<eos> It was coined about 2,500 years ago.
What the hell is it, Calvin?<eos> These are live images from the top of the LexCorp tower in downtown Metropolis.<eos> Military aircraft are on the scene.<eos> This thing emerged from the Kryptonian crash site just moments ago.<eos> Thankfully though, the work day is over in the downtown core. It's nearly empty.
Projectile 2?<eos> Superman, Mr. President.<eos> Projectile 2 was Superman.<eos> Sir.<eos> It's moving.
No tricks.<eos> Send her over, Keenan.<eos> And the money?<eos> Somewhere close.<eos> And that's where it stays until I have my daughter.
I can't! We're locked out, sir!<eos> Missile away! Repeat! Missile away!<eos> Punch in the self-destruct code before the fish can arm itself!<eos> Alpha 30, echo 40, Bravo Hotel.<eos> Negative. It's not responding.
Tell me about glassmaking.<eos> - Glassmaking?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Fire makes glass.<eos> It's so hot it melts the stone.
Make sure Inferno is unleashed.<eos> Seek and find.<eos> Long road but here we are.<eos> Better me than the Americans.<eos> You're going to want to tell me where it is.
That makes sense, doesn't it?<eos> Yes.<eos> So we agree we're opening it.<eos> Well, that explains it.<eos> It is mine.
And only 50 years to double again to four billion people in 1970.<eos> We're nearly at eight billion now.<eos> Bartlett gives the example of a beaker.<eos> With a single bacterium in it, one that divides and doubles every minute.<eos> If you place the first bacterium into the beaker at 11:00 and it's completely full by 12 at what time is the beaker still only half full?
What in God's name has this client gotten us into? - Uh...<eos> - No, no, no.<eos> It is rhetorical.<eos> When are we due to receive the client's video?<eos> It just arrived.
It's healthy.<eos> I've seen many acts of God:<eos> Famine, typhoons, cholera.<eos> And you know what?<eos> Sometimes, it hits the right people.
Are you still in possession?<eos> You had the pointer and we had you.<eos> It was all working seamlessly until Miss Brooks stole you away.<eos> To make sure the virus is released.<eos> It appears.
Here.<eos> The doorway.<eos> I wish it would've happened differently back then.<eos> We didn't look after it.<eos> It fell apart.
"Kneel within the gilded museum of holy wisdom.<eos> Listen for the sounds of trickling water.<eos> Follow deep into the sunken palace."<eos> - I hear water flowing under these stones.<eos> - Where does it go?
- This is the city's water supply?<eos> - Well, not anymore.<eos> We've modernized.<eos> - But there is water in there?<eos> - Yes, it eventually filters into the earth.
Come on, don't do this, Sienna, don't.<eos> You'll be murdering innocents.<eos> Yes, people will die, a lot of them, but the crisis will be averted.<eos> It's what nature demands.<eos> The problem won't just be slowed down, it'll be solved.
We ready?<eos> Then let's get started.<eos> I'd like you to sit quietly and close your eyes.<eos> Envision yourself in a halo of glowing white light.<eos> It will protect you.
I had this crazy dream.<eos> Saw this thing.<eos> When I woke up... Couldn't get it out of my head.<eos> So, thought maybe this might help.<eos> Hey, I know I'm no Picasso, but I didn't think it was that bad.
He dragged me right back into the room and told me I had to face my fears.<eos> And I was scared to death.<eos> But then I remembered what this nun had told me in catechism.<eos> "God will be there for all who need."<eos> So, I grabbed this crucifix out from my nightstand, right? And I tell whatever's under there that it better leave, or God was gonna kick its butt.
Yes, and?<eos> Reginald has decided to stay at Churchill to hunt with Charles.<eos> He cites the fine open weather. What nonsense.<eos> Weather's not open at all.<eos> Well, maybe it is there, or it was when she wrote.
So theoretically, the deep lakes could have something like that.<eos> I mean on land.<eos> A giant sea creature on land.<eos> Well, no.<eos> Because its body evolved in a water environment, so it wouldn't be able to move with the effects of gravity pulling on it.
Do you think you could give me a ride home?<eos> I don't live too far away.<eos> But it was kind of a scary walk in the dark.<eos> I don't have a car.<eos> It doesn't run.
I don't live too far away.<eos> But it was kind of a scary walk in the dark.<eos> I don't have a car.<eos> It doesn't run.<eos> It's not...
Dylan's not gonna like this.<eos> I'm not really concerned with what Dylan likes. Okay?<eos> I'm doing this for us.<eos> - What is wrong with this thing?<eos> - Hey, relax, it's just a kid's toy.
You know the only difference between your father and mine?<eos> Mine's still alive.<eos> Get him up.<eos> So, this is the man who spent a lifetime plotting against me.<eos> I wouldn't have known your face if it had been on a billboard outside my bedroom window.
And we're the only ones that even know that he's alive.<eos> We can't just walk away.<eos> That's not what the Horsemen do.<eos> There's a quote.<eos> It's actually by the magician that made me wanna do this in the first place.
Deadly.<eos> Can I get him back?<eos> My husband.<eos> I don't know.<eos> Wherever that thing comes from... it takes them with it.
It's like a dark mass.<eos> And it dove down there. Down underground.<eos> Someone ought to do something about it.<eos> It's everywhere, this thing.<eos> It's out of control.
They think this is related to Grindelwald's attacks in Europe.<eos> I was there.<eos> This is a beast.<eos> No human could do what this thing is capable of, Madam President.<eos> Whatever it is, one thing is clear.
I was there.<eos> This is a beast.<eos> No human could do what this thing is capable of, Madam President.<eos> Whatever it is, one thing is clear.<eos> It must be stopped.
This is a beast.<eos> No human could do what this thing is capable of, Madam President.<eos> Whatever it is, one thing is clear.<eos> It must be stopped.<eos> It's terrorizing No-Majs.
All right, you wanna take the book home? Look at it over the weekend?<eos> Call me if you get stuck or whatever.<eos> On a weekend?<eos> You gotta be kidding me.<eos> It's just, uh, it's just one chapter.
I wanna go home.<eos> You still on hold?<eos> Yes, I am.<eos> Where is this hospital?<eos> It's here, where do you think?
The body, was it anointed?<eos> We had no time.<eos> We just wrapped him with myrrh and aloe.<eos> That's what you see, sweat and herbs.<eos> Bring it.
- We just did!<eos> We're stuck!<eos> - Heave it.<eos> Hoist the net, Andrew.<eos> - It's caught on something.
- It's fish.<eos> - We're stuck on the bottom.<eos> - We're not moving!<eos> - It's fish.<eos> It's fish.
The water pressure's too much!<eos> You're not gonna get that thing open!<eos> - Todd! Unless you equalize the pressure inside and out you're not getting that damn thing open!<eos> How are we gonna do that, Spock?<eos> It has to be completely flooded, alright?
You're not gonna get that thing open!<eos> - Todd! Unless you equalize the pressure inside and out you're not getting that damn thing open!<eos> How are we gonna do that, Spock?<eos> It has to be completely flooded, alright?<eos> Jesus! It's not filling up fast enough!
Hold... hold on!<eos> Jesus! Now, besides the leakage you gotta remember this thing is airtight.<eos> We're not in a regular car, alright?<eos> Look, there's supposed to be an emergency oxygen system.<eos> I can't tell if it's activated or not.
I, I don't remember.<eos> -How do you not remember something like that?<eos> Uh, maybe because this poor soul is dead who gave his body to science only to be ridiculed by the size of his penis?<eos> Oh, my God. You can say the word, professor.<eos> It's cock.
Like Eddie said, I might not make it.<eos> Wait.<eos> Wait, wait.<eos> Matt. Matt, you said the car has GPS, right?<eos> - And it's working?
Wait, wait.<eos> Matt. Matt, you said the car has GPS, right?<eos> - And it's working?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> See? We just have to wait 'cause it's working.
Arnie Gentile called.<eos> He has the ACARS data.<eos> The left engine was still operating at idle.<eos> Not possible.<eos> I felt it go.
The left engine was still operating at idle.<eos> Not possible.<eos> I felt it go.<eos> It was like we were stopped in midair.<eos> Arnie said there was a chance it was sub-idle, that it still coulcfve had thrust.
Why? What do you mean?<eos> It's just-... We got another notice about the space in Butte County.<eos> We'll find a tenant.<eos> It just takes time.<eos> Yeah, you've been saying that for nine months, Sully. It's still vacant.
The security cameras show you logging on.<eos> Just get on the floor.<eos> Do I have to tell you this is the most dangerous time since the Great War?<eos> They're cutting budgets while the barbarians are at the gate.<eos> The system's failing us, Jax. It's broken.
Really.<eos> I just, you know, love all these precious little updates about you and Dr. surfboard.<eos> - Good for you.<eos> - Oh, shut up.<eos> Another argument that Internet addiction disorder doesn't belong in the dsm 'is that it's frequently symptomatic of other disorders.' 'depression, anxiety, trauma.' often, it's an escape from things we don't wanna deal with.
A challenging one.<eos> Oh, my god.<eos> God.<eos> Is that the video?<eos> I thought you said it was in your messages.
This is important.<eos> You see that lass over there? What?<eos> Sharon Osbourne?<eos> No.<eos> She's gonna release this deadly virus, and it's gonna kill poor people like us, because she thinks that we are scum.
Why can't I go with you?<eos> I told you, I work alone.<eos> Wait there.<eos> Always good to see your face.<eos> Even if it's not yours.
Where are they going?<eos> Up, straight up.<eos> Alex...<eos> - What?<eos> - Destroy it!
It's worth a shot.<eos> Kurt?<eos> There's some kind of animal in there.<eos> It's no animal.<eos> It's a man.
- Why do you keep saying that?<eos> I told you before, it was just a line in a bar.<eos> - Give me your phone.<eos> - Why? - Why not?<eos> - Because it's my phone.
Michi was right.<eos> The forest does make you see things.<eos> Look.<eos> I found a place. It might have a radio.<eos> It's a ranger station.
We don't know yet.<eos> - Hey, do you have a phone?<eos> - Why?<eos> Just give it to me.<eos> I left it in the apartment where you kidnapped me.
Shut up, Peter.<eos> Humanity welcomes you with hope.<eos> What humanity?<eos> This hole looks radioactive.<eos> Or at least it was so in the last 200 years.
The universe A vast expanse of space and matter.<eos> It includes everything we see and everything we know.
The universe A vast expanse of space and matter.<eos> It includes everything we see and everything we know.<eos> Since the beginning of time, we wonder how it came to be...
And by the way , you look no thing like your profile picture<eos> " Franthen " you must stop dating outside your species.<eos> We can solve this!<eos> Is this about the bikini?<eos> I did not know it was poison ivy.
And looking fabulous<eos> Buck has saved us before, right?<eos> - But what if he can't this time?<eos> - I do not know what to believe.<eos> But I fear that our lives will over before it begins.
- Buck?<eos> - Your space rocks!<eos> We can divert the asteroid with a magnet that size!<eos> That thing is enormous!<eos> - It's massaive, it's...
Thanks to Geotopia!<eos> It's lovely!<eos> Now let's find a way to launch it into space.<eos> Wait,You want to destroy our home?<eos> It will be destroyed either way.
Oh, but this show is gonna pack them in like it did in the good old days.<eos> They were not good old days, Mr. Moon.<eos> They were magnificent.<eos> And that theater of yours, it was a palace of wonder and magic.<eos> But, Nana, it still is. Yeah, right.
Mike?<eos> Right.<eos> Mike here says you got his money, and it's in that box.<eos> No, no, just hold on a moment here.<eos> That's prize money, and it's not Mike's unless he wins it fair and...
I just...<eos> No, no, don't go!<eos> Has anyone seen my glass eye?<eos> On...<eos> It's right here, Miss Crawly.
That's how I wish it happened.<eos> Binarily Augmented Retro-Framing... or BARF.<eos> God, I gotta work on that acronym.<eos> An extremely costly method of hijacking the hippocampus... to clear traumatic memories.<eos> It doesn't change the fact that they never made it to the airport... or all the things I did to avoid processing my grief, but...
- These need your signature.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> I suppose neither of us is used to the spotlight.<eos> Oh, well, it's not always so flattering.
Vision's keeping her company.<eos> Oh, God, Tony.<eos> Every time I think you see things the right way...<eos> It's 100 acres with a lap pool.<eos> It's got a screening room.
You would like to hear that one again.<eos> Please.<eos> He don't even consider what I want.<eos> All he cares is about is a stupid family tradition.<eos> - It's your family's.
They have.<eos> How was their offer?<eos> Insufficient.<eos> That is a shame.<eos> If it was more you might be able to get their apple business.
In the beginning... there was only ocean... until the mother island emerged.<eos> Te Fiti.<eos> Her heart held the greatest power ever known.<eos> It could create life itself.
And when we look to the future<eos> There you are<eos> You'll be okay In time you'll learn just as I did You must find happiness right where you are<eos> I like to dance with the water The undertow and the waves<eos> The water is mischievous Ha! I like how it misbehaves
Don't!<eos> We have to find Maui. We have to restore the heart!<eos> There is no heart!<eos> This is just a rock! No!<eos> It's your mother!
- Jackson.<eos> All right.<eos> Well, I am so happy that our family is together.<eos> Thanks for putting on this feast.<eos> It's all local and, um, organic and non-gmo, so...
Mosley, Prank Monkey, Peyton.<eos> Some of these pictures are from at least 6 months ago.<eos> This one's from last summer.<eos> He's been watching us for almost a year?<eos> I don't know, but hold on, there's a video here. It says Peyton Video 3.
He figures out all my passwords.<eos> Which is kind of sexy.<eos> So, when I came home last night, Scott was on my laptop, wondering why...<eos> Scott's behavior is not normal.<eos> It's a form of emotional abuse.
So, when I came home last night, Scott was on my laptop, wondering why...<eos> Scott's behavior is not normal.<eos> It's a form of emotional abuse.<eos> Are you ever afraid of Scott?<eos> It's not abuse.
It's a form of emotional abuse.<eos> Are you ever afraid of Scott?<eos> It's not abuse.<eos> Not if you don't care, and I don't.<eos> Maybe it's become a normal state for you.
Okay and why is that gonna happen?<eos> Okay, well, it'll happen because most of you people are too goddamn comfortable to see it.<eos> You kids don't understand.<eos> This country buys out the subversives.<eos> It turns the rebels into fashion trends.
Sorry about what happened.<eos> The Rosario thing.<eos> Well, now we're even.<eos> It was my fault.<eos> I felt like it'd be an opportunity for everyone, but to be honest, I made up that story to get you all here and I couldn't see the mountain of shit waiting for us.
What's happening?<eos> What's this all about?<eos> Did you speak to her?<eos> Did you tell her about my conversation with those two?<eos> I thought it was relevant.

An online hub for men's rights actmsts.<eos> They were founded by a man named Paul elam.<eos> It's a website called " a voice for men" that's run by a man named Paul elam...<eos> Which is "male" spelled backwards, but it is his real name apparently.<eos> It's a gathering of women haters.
That's power he's losing over his life in order to make his contribution, his sacrifice, his way of loving.<eos> And this has been translated into the culture of<eos> "you make more money than women do, you must therefore have more power."

"you make more money than women do, you must therefore have more power." Meet Warren Farrell, best-selling author and self-styled social anthropologist, leading an assault on our traditional thinking about men.<eos> I asked my girlfriend at the time to buy me as a gift,<eos> I think it was for Christmas or my birthday,<eos> Warren Farrell's book "the myth of male power,"<eos> which she did, and it just changed my whole life.
Yeah, I was...<eos> I was about to get in the shower, and I thought I heard a noise.<eos> Noise?<eos> What was the noise?<eos> It was nothing.
Thank you.<eos> Thank you, thank you.<eos> Now while you're here, please grab my radio.<eos> My radio, the radio.<eos> Look, it's... it's right there in the pack.
Manager.<eos> It's at McDonalds?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I brought you a present.<eos> It's from Josie, really.
-Stand against the wall.<eos> -Yeah?<eos> -Yeah.<eos> With your arms...<eos> The bookcase is 5 feet wide. I want to visualize it.
Of course, you won't go blind!<eos> There we go.<eos> -Glass of wine? -Yes, please.<eos> I didn't recognize the car.<eos> Whose is it?
Varga, what have we said about you thinking?<eos> The poison will dissipate.<eos> I need this blood untainted, and I need it now.<eos> It cannot be rushed.<eos> It must run its course.
The poison will dissipate.<eos> I need this blood untainted, and I need it now.<eos> It cannot be rushed.<eos> It must run its course.<eos> It's definitely the car.
You know what you must do.<eos> Water is the path.<eos> Selene.<eos> Praise the day... when it ends.<eos> Praise the ice... when it holds.
Water is the path.<eos> Selene.<eos> Praise the day... when it ends.<eos> Praise the ice... when it holds.<eos> Praise the sword... when it kills.
- Are you all right, Bert?<eos> - Fuck no, I'm not all right!<eos> I haven't had a cigarette.<eos> So what was it you needed to talk to me about then, Captain?<eos> You guys down at Property had tagged this little puppy and it's goin' up for auction this week.
You guys down at Property had tagged this little puppy and it's goin' up for auction this week.<eos> Okay.<eos> - I want it as a gift to my son-in-law. - That's... very thoughtful of you.<eos> Well, ya know, he's a good kid.<eos> Would you mind heading' down to the O.P.G. and checkin' it out?
And then I saw... A brown skinned child across that field.<eos> And he was standing beside me. And it was right there and I could feel it so strongly.<eos> And for the first time in my life I felt something good...<eos> I felt good.<eos> And I knew it was guiding me. And I knew that I was going to be fine.
The Emperor is awaiting my report.<eos> One would hope that he and Lord Vader might've been here for such an occasion.<eos> And I thought it prudent to save you from any potential embarrassment.<eos> Your concern's hardly warranted.<eos> If saying it would only make it so.
It's just so hard not to think of you.<eos> Think of where you are... my Stardust.<eos> Saw... the reactor module, that's the key.<eos> That's the place I've laid my trap.<eos> It's well hidden and unstable.
Check stabilizers.<eos> Bodhi, where's the lab?<eos> The research facility?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Where is it?
Bodhi, where's the lab?<eos> The research facility?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Where is it?<eos> It's just over that ridge.
Stardust.<eos> Papa.<eos> I've seen your message.<eos> The hologram, I've seen it.<eos> It must be destroyed.
-I actually just signed.<eos> -Okay, thank you very much.<eos> Too much independent spirit for you?<eos> No, I just don't really like bashing my country.<eos> It's my country too, and right now it has blood on its hands.
We don't. - Of course we do.<eos> JSOC and CIA have their people in the field.<eos> What's the program name?<eos> Epic Shelter.<eos> It was originally some backup program for uh... Catastrophic site failure. -Yeah.
- And here's Level 4.<eos> Please. This is the interesting stage, the hibernation stage.<eos> Kinda like suspended animation. Comatose, unresponsive.<eos> The heart eventually stops, or so we thought.<eos> But it actually slows so that it's virtually untraceable.
Call her.<eos> I'm not gonna call her.<eos> And the thing is... you're acting like life's got me on the ropes.<eos> I want to be on the ropes.<eos> Okay? I'm letting life hit me 'til it gets tired. - Oh?
So...<eos> Here's what we know.<eos> Yeah?<eos> It's definitely "Chicken on a Stick," and your play is gonna be a triumph.<eos> It's a one-woman show, so it's just me...
I don't care if I know<eos> Just where I will go<eos> 'Cause all that I need's this crazy feeling<eos> The rat-tat-tat of my heart<eos> Think I want it to stay
You coffee?<eos> Yes.<eos> Here and dinner and breakfast?<eos> Yes. We do not resound meal in your room. Only for bedridden patients.<eos> Do you like it here?
Save your lies for someone who has time to hear them.<eos> I told Spencer it was okay if she and Caleb got together.<eos> How did this get so complicated?<eos> You're writing a book with the guy you used to be in love with.<eos> It's about his dead girlfriend.
Wait, her phone's ringing.<eos> Oh, come on, Mary, keep talking.<eos> - Can you hear the other person? - Shh.<eos> Don't shush me.<eos> The signal keeps dropping in and out but it's definitely a man.
What do you believe?<eos> I believe... In the moon, the stars.<eos> It's that feeling that I'm a part of something so much bigger than myself that I will never, ever begin to understand.<eos> And it's something that I cannot control, no matter how hard I try.<eos> So, if you can tell me where that comes from and why it is so damn beautiful...
Got to thinking that life is held together by choices, one after the other."<eos> Oh, so cute! "All shapes and sizes."<eos> So cute.<eos> "Right or wrong doesn't matter, because life just keeps unfolding.<eos> It won't wait around for you.
Oh, so cute! "All shapes and sizes."<eos> So cute.<eos> "Right or wrong doesn't matter, because life just keeps unfolding.<eos> It won't wait around for you.<eos> If you sit still, it could pass you by altogether."
Holland March home?<eos> What the fuck?<eos> Mr. March, we're gonna play a game.<eos> I think you have the wrong house.<eos> It's called, "Shut up unless you're me."
Fuck it, it's... It's a rental.<eos> We're only here until we rebuild the old place anyway.<eos> Rebuild?<eos> Yeah.<eos> It burned down.
Yeah, just get some rest.<eos> What do you think?<eos> I like her.<eos> I like her dress.<eos> It's a nice dress.
How'd you know my name was Buddy?<eos> WOMAN". The Malibu sedan.<eos> This year's edition is looking spectacular.<eos> Come and see it, folks.<eos> It's just a bunch of cars.
You!<eos> A moment.<eos> When was this?<eos> Yesterday morning.<eos> The bride's face, how is it described?
I am currently attempting to have a perfectly normal conversation with you.<eos> - Please don't.<eos> - Why do you need to be alone?<eos> If you are referring to romantic entanglement, Watson, which I rather fear you are, as I have often explained before, all emotion is abhorrent to me.<eos> It is the grit in a sensitive instrument.
- Stay here, Watson.<eos> - What?<eos> No. All the doors and windows to the house are locked.<eos> This is the only way out, I need you here.<eos> But the sound was so close, it had to be from this side of the house.
Yeah, I suppose we should.<eos> I have access to the top level of the MI5 archives.<eos> Yep, that's where I'm looking.<eos> What do you think of MI5's security?<eos> I think it would be a good idea.
Yes, Watson, we did.<eos> The sound of breaking glass.<eos> Not a window.<eos> Just an old theatrical trick.<eos> It cannot be true, Holmes. - It cannot.
Isn't that right, Lady Carmichael?<eos> One small detail doesn't quite make sense to me, however.<eos> Why engage me to prevent a murder you intended to commit?<eos> It doesn't quite make sense. It doesn't quite make sense.<eos> Of course it doesn't make sense, it's not real.
My heart flees alike<eos> This breeze Rustling...<eos> O heart, take wings, rustle with glee, town after town, in all quarters let me flee<eos> My heart blooming with laughter<eos> My body in it's tow bursting after
- What's this?<eos> - It's a car.<eos> Really?<eos> The steering is on the wrong side.<eos> No, it's actually on the right side.
Yeah.<eos> Dr. Stockman.<eos> We just got confirmation, sir.<eos> The "package" is shipping later tonight.<eos> Well, make sure they're tracking it every step of the way.
- Guess who's on it.<eos> That's not what happened.<eos> That footage has been altered. It's been edited.<eos> We checked its authenticity.<eos> It's clean.
Hacking into the main data core.<eos> Ship's designate is the Technodrome.<eos> Commanding Officer goes by the name of Krang.<eos> I don't know that guy, but I hate that guy!<eos> If Krang were to finish building this thing, it wouldn't just be a ship.

And Andrea was unhappy with that?<eos> "Outraged" is the word.<eos> Outraged you were to get half her mother's estate, which included the home on 87th Street, which has a current market value of about 10 million dollars.<eos> That's right.<eos> So outraged she filed an appeal in a probate court in hopes it would agree with her you deserved nothing.
So the knife was already in your pocket?<eos> No.<eos> I took that with me, too.<eos> Why?<eos> Because I knew how it looked.
I took that with me, too.<eos> Why?<eos> Because I knew how it looked.<eos> You were drunk, drugged, scared, and in a blind panic.<eos> But you still knew how it looked?

And our DJ, Francis, moved to Japan to hunt dolphins, like a dickhead.<eos> But it turned out all of that was just a blessing in disguise because it turned me into Conner4Real.<eos> I dropped my first album.<eos> And what can I say?<eos> It was a smash.
Right, right, right.<eos> But like where was it, though?<eos> Because that motherfucker was gone.<eos> We've gone over this.<eos> You know I've got to tuck my shit back so it doesn't get tangled up in the garments.
Oh yeah, totally!<eos> It's right here!<eos> Fuck, yeah!<eos> Let's see it.<eos> Put it up.
Two hours.<eos> Grant me that, before ye speak.<eos> For the memory of the friendship that I once had for you, which you have now murdered as certainly as you did my chieftain...<eos> I'll give ye two hours, and then I'll damn your soul to the fiery pit.<eos> You can see how flat and open and boggy it is.
You know I'm an engineer?<eos> Show me drive diagnostics and core levels.<eos> Life support.<eos> What's going on?<eos> Oh, I don't know, ask the ship, it seems to know everything.
_<eos> _ _<eos> _<eos> Tell us, Madame Fraser, what do English ladies call a male member?<eos> Ah, well, I've... heard it referred to as "peter."
She dropped her ice cream.<eos> How do we clean it?<eos> It's okay.<eos> Problem solved.<eos> Wash it away.
Cascade news 3.<eos> Let's hit it.<eos> I'm jazzed and we're going to be live very, very soon.<eos> Can I ask you, is the makeup intentional?<eos> Do you think it's too much?

Hi, Jules.<eos> Ooh! Look at Roger.<eos> He looks good. Well, thanks for having me.<eos> Does he look too orange?<eos> His face looks like it's covered in Cheetos dust.
It was the best, it was...<eos> I don't even know where it came from.<eos> I don't know how I did it.<eos> I mean, that was awesome.<eos> And I gotta tell you, seeing your face now. It is busted.
Cathy, that part's true.<eos> Hey, Roger.<eos> I just want to say thank you for a wonderful couple of days.<eos> Switching gears a little bit, um, I lost my cell phone charger in there.<eos> It's a Samsung android s3.
Switching gears a little bit, um, I lost my cell phone charger in there.<eos> It's a Samsung android s3.<eos> It's like the s4 but a fewer prongs.<eos> You know how they just change the chargers for no reason.<eos> I know this is a weird time to bring it up, but it is a discontinued model.

(Both hoof)<eos> (Music)<eos> ♪ Dirty thoughts, dirty streets, Dirty passages, dirty mass, Dirty mummification and filthy cops,<eos> Find me in the crowd, I will not be alone today.<eos> The stuff, it gnaws at you alive.
Nee.<eos> No.<eos> - You wanted to see me!<eos> No, I happened to be here and wanted to see if your house was still standing.<eos> It stands.
No.<eos> - You wanted to see me!<eos> No, I happened to be here and wanted to see if your house was still standing.<eos> It stands.<eos> - Yes, it stands.
You can see him if you want.<eos> What happened to him?<eos> Just a cardiac arrest.<eos> You know his heart's very weak at this point.<eos> It just gave out.
Yeah. Yeah, he's doing real well too.<eos> Hey, how's Joe doing? He gonna be okay?<eos> Yeah, he's fine.<eos> Where's the practice?<eos> Is it at the school? No, they practice at Gloucester around.
Okay?<eos> Are you askin' me or telling' me?<eos> I'm tellin' you that's the best I can do.<eos> Then what the fuck do you care whether it's okay with me or not?<eos> It's 45 minutes away.
I know you never... maybe you don't want to talk to me.<eos> - It's not that.<eos> - Let me finish.<eos> However... my heart was broken.<eos> It's always going to be broken.
Leave us alone!<eos> I get fresh towels.<eos> (Sob)<eos> The baby is dead.<eos> It poisoned her body.
Press, go!<eos> Press, press!<eos> Pressing, pressing!<eos> I feel my head.<eos> It is there.
I feel my head.<eos> It is there.<eos> Done, done!<eos> (Baby cries)<eos> It's full.
Thank you very much.<eos> Does Jonas already know?<eos> What?<eos> - That you expect a baby.<eos> Is it from him?
Do not you want to see the banquet?<eos> Come over!<eos> (Music)<eos> We can not do that.<eos> - Whom should it disturb?
Come over!<eos> Mistress?<eos> I can not remember anyone who is our gun master A scream.<eos> How did you heal his leg?<eos> - It was not the leg.
But then Christian knightly tamed him.<eos> No one else did that.<eos> Drago is the fastest horse I know.<eos> What is he lacking?<eos> I can lower his fever, but it comes back.
It was a long and arduous journey.<eos> And some of us have been sacrificed.<eos> A lot of work is coming to us.<eos> But look at the country!<eos> It will reward us richly if we know how to use it.
No.<eos> The house will be sealed for a while.<eos> You got some place you can stay?<eos> I don't live there.<eos> It's Andrea's house, her mother's.
They said you had a knife on you.<eos> You didn't, right?<eos> I did.<eos> What knife?<eos> It was there.
Let's just have a drink here.<eos> It's an Irish recipe.<eos> I... made it myself.<eos> I call this program the Cypher Wizard.<eos> It uses some of the same logarithms I use in code breaking for the government.
Open your books.<eos> There's no time for class.<eos> Okay, then.<eos> Then consider this quotation of Rousseau's.<eos> "If there were a nation of gods," "it would govern itself democratically."
I think we spoke on the phone.<eos> So... we want to show you how we intend to redesign your textbook.<eos> To discuss this new edition before undertaking anything.<eos> We want to maintain the specificity of the 2004 version.<eos> It remains an anthology devoid of commentary that might come between teacher and student.
But sales figures give our competitors a big lead.<eos> Our aim is to strengthen its quality as a reference book, while striving to meet market expectations.<eos> Look through it at home.<eos> In short, our aim is to upgrade the textbook, to humanize it.<eos> To give it the pedagogical makeover it needs.

- What?<eos> Sure I did.<eos> I didn't have the honor.<eos> What did you think?<eos> Very well written... but it preaches to the converted.
My roof is your spot?<eos> You just can't fuck around right over there because neighbor's be tripping.<eos> That one bitch...<eos> and I don't say bitch a lot, but... that one bitch, specifically, comes out here bugging out.<eos> Well, it's my roof now.
Do I see a pair of rabbit ears?<eos> - Oh, Whitey.<eos> - Bunny.<eos> How was the golf?<eos> It was nice enough, thank you.
Yeah, that's right.<eos> See, most convicts...<eos> I mean, they got any kind of paper at all, it's some "study in your cell at night" GED bullshit.<eos> See, me, I like school, so I did it right.<eos> I mean, life wound up taking me where it took me, but still, right?
Can you explain to them that if this bullshit ends up costing American lives, I'm gonna come back here and cut all their throats myself, starting with him.<eos> You tell him that.<eos> What a shitshow.<eos> State got a report from the Benghazi Medical Center that said a crowd of Libyans brought in an American male alive.<eos> They used Scott Wickland's phone, said it came from Chris' pocket.
I can say things while you sleep.<eos> Your dreams will ken the truth of them.<eos> Read this.<eos> "My Lord Broch Tuarach, "you are hereby ordered to proceed at once "with your men to...<eos> Exile is what it is.
It's a miracle they didna shoot me in my good eye.<eos> Damn it, where's my knife?<eos> My lady.<eos> Well, where'd you get that?<eos> Milord gave it to me.
God will provide for us.<eos> We do His bidding.<eos> May He have mercy on us all.<eos> I've dissolved some more arsenic in this tea.<eos> Mary, arsenic will bring color to his cheeks, but it won't help his cough.
Allegedly.<eos> Allegedly.<eos> Thing I can't figure out... why would somebody... go through all this hell outside, cause all this mayhem, and then leave the money behind?<eos> To take it off the streets.<eos> Once it's logged, whoever it belongs to doesn't have access to it anymore.
That was me as a kid.<eos> And I could find Waldo faster than anybody.<eos> That's what a photograph does for me.<eos> A photograph freezes time.<eos> It allows you to look at things, slow down, think about what's out of place, and then fill in the blanks.
Breathe.<eos> You've got no scars.<eos> Nothing.<eos> That lab was totally destroyed.<eos> You mean it worked?
The only way he can win at this point is if he can control who comes in and who leaves.<eos> Either way, I gotta get you someplace safe.<eos> What the hell?<eos> Lucky Luciano used to own this building.<eos> It still has a lot of prohibition nooks and crannies.
They don't know who gave who what.<eos> They'll try to find out.<eos> - What's ketamine?<eos> - Why? It's what was in the vial he had in his pocket.<eos> It's an anesthetic vets use on horses when they do surgery.
Why would anybody take that?<eos> Why would Michael Jackson take propofol?<eos> ... Same reason.<eos> He took it to sleep, didn't he?<eos> Well, it worked for that.
Set it down there.<eos> Do you see what I'm saying?<eos> I don't think I do.<eos> You're stabbing somebody with a knife.<eos> Sometimes it goes so deep, it hits bone, which causes your hand to slip onto the blade.
With the strength of our father, we'll cut the head from the serpent.<eos> We'll destroy them all.<eos> Somethin' wrong?<eos> There was a meeting a few nights ago.<eos> And although I was not privy to what was said, I can only assume by the secrecy that it was not altogether productive.
Their dream house.<eos> What about it?<eos> I don't understand.<eos> Where is it?<eos> It doesn't exist.
Okay, just bring the jar.<eos> Grab your backpack.<eos> Get me some shirts and a pair of pants.<eos> How can he lock you out of your own house?<eos> It's his house.
He's got heart trouble.<eos> - No, no, no, no. - Get off.<eos> Just give me my money.<eos> We don't have it anymore.<eos> It's gone.
Now we can get your tools back.<eos> Where did you get this?<eos> Mom.<eos> - No, we're taking it back.<eos> - Well, it's for fixing the car.
Where's your bracelet?<eos> You were always Romano's favorite.<eos> - What's that, Nandi?<eos> - A piece of paper.<eos> Turn it over.
Pretty fucking aberrant, Bernie.<eos> Your hosts get sick, they get lost, but this is grotesque.<eos> Is it a problem with the update?<eos> Possible, but not likely.<eos> If it's the unlikely version, how many hosts have you updated so far?
You're right.<eos> This place is one thing to the guests, another thing to the shareholders, and something completely different to management.<eos> So enlighten me.<eos> What do you think management's real interests are?<eos> You're smart enough to guess there's a bigger picture, but not smart enough to see what it is.
Can you walk on that leg?<eos> Yes.<eos> You're going to make it, brother.<eos> Ice teaches all humility.<eos> It shows us our limits.
Humanoid mutants are fully capable of reproducing different types.<eos> That is the only thing that the creator did well.<eos> Are you doing something deep, not Kix?<eos> "Does that book teach you all that?" -Open mind.<eos> It helps me understand, what I do.
Then do it.<eos> This cabinet council meeting is now adjourned.<eos> Let's get to work.<eos> There's so much bureaucracy involved. Every action requires a meeting.<eos> Come on, don't knock red tape. It's the foundation of democracy.
The way I see it, the more knowledge, the better.<eos> Now let's clear some space.<eos> Nice to meet you.<eos> I'm Rando Yaguchi. This is from GSDF's latest unmanned surveillance system.<eos> It froze shortly after the attack.
The capital and the government are in shambles right now.<eos> It's a good opportunity to rebuild it right.<eos> And speaking of which, once the relief and reconstruction bills have been passed, the event that will happen afterwards is the next election. To resuscitate Japan and its 3.6 million refugees, we'll need a new leader and a new cabinet.<eos> This country was devastated before but it rose from the ashes.<eos> It'll do so again.
- Still working on the footprint.<eos> - What about the blood?<eos> The D.N.A. tests are in process, should be back any minute.<eos> - But the blood's 0-positive, so...<eos> - It's not hers.
It was real?<eos> Is there a place where we could talk?<eos> I had never done anything like that before.<eos> Honestly, my life here is pretty boring most of the time.<eos> You would think with all these kids running around, it'd be anything but boring.
- Uh, he lives in Philadelphia now.<eos> - How do you know that?<eos> He entered a residential treatment facility for anger management.<eos> He sent me these letters apologizing for his behavior.<eos> He says it's part of the program.
Oh, God. The pleats take forever to iron.<eos> Oh, Kent.<eos> You're wearing a dress.<eos> No, Jane.<eos> It's a kilt.
No, I mean, this is what I wore to marry your father.<eos> I just...<eos> I wanted Emily to have it.<eos> Only if you like it.<eos> It's pretty.
I just...<eos> I wanted Emily to have it.<eos> Only if you like it.<eos> It's pretty.<eos> Yes, it's gorgeous, it's beautiful.
William's mom and dad speak very highly of you.<eos> They tell me you're in medicine.<eos> She's a nurse at County.<eos> What an honorable profession.<eos> Do you like it?
FATHER AVITAL: You mustn't say that.<eos> Emily's gone.<eos> I can see that now.<eos> I protected this evil thing for too long.<eos> Allowed it to kill way too many people.
Order up!<eos> I know what you're thinking.<eos> "What the heck do I need a five spindle for, when I barely sell enough milkshakes to justify my single spindle?" Right?<eos> Are you familiar with the notion of the chicken or the egg,<eos> Mr. Griffith? I mention it because, well, I think it applies here.
Those things put a roof over our heads.<eos> At least over mine.<eos> What do you mean over yours?<eos> Over "our" heads.<eos> It's a good roof, Ray.
I just found a way to save you, me, and all the owner-operators literally hundreds of dollars a year in electrical costs.<eos> And what would that be?<eos> Two words, powdered milkshake.<eos> I'm telling you I came across a remarkable product called Inst-A-Mix.<eos> Like I say, it's a powdered milkshake.
Until you build more equity in your home or pay down the loan, there's nothing I can do.<eos> My business is booming.<eos> Unfortunately, that's immaterial.<eos> Well, I've got 13 locations in nine states.<eos> - It's a home-equity loan.
- It's a home-equity loan.<eos> - Then give me a business loan.<eos> These thirteen locations, you own them?<eos> - Me personally?<eos> - It's your business, correct? - You own it?
There's 100,000 of them down there.<eos> We can't fight our way out.<eos> We wait till dark, and then we'll find her.<eos> I'm very attached to this knife.<eos> Don't worry. It didn't touch you.
It's hard to walk in this.<eos> It's beautiful.<eos> You're beautiful.<eos> This venison, it's very tasty.<eos> Is it from today's hunt?
- North of the Wall?<eos> You're a wildling.<eos> The Seven Kingdoms have waged war against these savages for centuries and here I sit hosting one in my hall thanks to my son.<eos> See that sword?<eos> It's called Heartsbane.

It's called Heartsbane.<eos> It's been in our family for 500 years.<eos> It's Valyrian steel.<eos> Only a handful of them left in the world.<eos> It's supposed to go to my firstborn son after I die.
If it please, my lady, I understand how you feel.<eos> I don't know you, Ser...?<eos> Davos, my lady, of House Seaworth.<eos> You needn't ask your maester about my house.<eos> It's rather new.
You have my word.<eos> You have until nightfall.<eos> You gave it to me for a purpose.<eos> I've achieved that purpose.<eos> It's yours.
You have until nightfall.<eos> You gave it to me for a purpose.<eos> I've achieved that purpose.<eos> It's yours.<eos> It will always be yours.
Seven blessings.<eos> Your Grace... that old rumor you told me about.<eos> My little birds investigated.<eos> And?<eos> Was it just a rumor or something more?
Is that what you meant about Amberle?<eos> Before she entered the Ellcrys, you said something terrible would happen if I didn't go with her.<eos> When you touched Amberle, did you see anything like this?<eos> Yeah, this symbol.<eos> It was in the room where they died.
Look at all these engravings.<eos> This must be the place.<eos> The Druid's book showed a symbol.<eos> We need to locate it.<eos> It's got to be some kind of key.
My parents might disagree, if I could dig their bodies up from beneath your floor and ask them.<eos> I know you hate Elves, but we don't murder prisoners of war.<eos> If your parents were prisoners here, we would have released them when the war ended.<eos> Perhaps they chose to start a new life, free of their burdens.<eos> Your ear... it's like mine.
A seashell.<eos> It belonged to my mom.<eos> Said it reminded her of where she came from.<eos> Have you ever seen the ocean?<eos> It's like the biggest bath you ever saw.
You don't have to tip.<eos> Fuck taxis, man.<eos> Uber's changing the world.<eos> And you own this car, right?<eos> It's, like, a nice car.
The helmet invulnerable!<eos> Before Hanzo could claim the armor and unite the pieces to reveal their true power, he was attacked by the Moon King's beast.<eos> Oh, yes!<eos> Kill the chicken!<eos> Rip it to pieces.
No. No.<eos> Yes.<eos> Kubo, look.<eos> The sword unbreakable.<eos> It could be a trap.
Kubo, look.<eos> The sword unbreakable.<eos> It could be a trap.<eos> Allow me.<eos> What, it's not a trap if you do it?
I don't got this.<eos> I don't got this!<eos> Oh, for crying out loud!<eos> I invoke the sword unbreakable!<eos> It broke.
I invoke the sword unbreakable!<eos> It broke.<eos> So, does it just mean the handle or...<eos> I'm a little disappointed with this magic sword.<eos> It's not the right sword, you idiot!
I'm a little disappointed with this magic sword.<eos> It's not the right sword, you idiot!<eos> Look!<eos> The sword!<eos> It's in his head.
Wait, you're being nice to me.<eos> Don't tell anyone.<eos> We did it, Beetle.<eos> We got the sword.<eos> Whoa. Put that down, it's sharp!
Well, I said I was teaching him how to shoot, not fish.<eos> Fishing is tomorrow's lesson.<eos> - Give me that.<eos> Grabby monkey.<eos> Now try it.
-(LAUGHING) - Well, why not?<eos> Gloria thinks there should be a ballet company out here. - Oh, yeah?<eos> - I hate the ballet.<eos> Get her to do that modern shit you love.<eos> I thought you enjoyed it last time. I did.
Get me a prescription.<eos> - You'll have to pick it up yourself.<eos> - I'll send somebody.<eos> And the photo?<eos> It's gone.
- You'll have to pick it up yourself.<eos> - I'll send somebody.<eos> And the photo?<eos> It's gone.<eos> What if it comes back?
It could hold you back in the elections.<eos> You know...<eos> I don't care if he feels betrayed.<eos> Anyway, that's what I wanted.<eos> I usually like black, but it doesn't suit you.
Come with me.<eos> When he had his car accident, he was given powerful analgesics to ease the pain... and morphine worked best.<eos> But morphine is highly addictive, so next he moved on... to cocaine, but he doesn't take it often.<eos> But still, it's a stressful time for him...<eos> If it's not cocaine, what is it?
ON JUNE 7, 1940, THE KING AND THE CROWN PRINCE WERE FORCED TO LEAVE THE COUNTRY.<eos> THREE DAYS LATER THE NORWEGIAN FORCES CAPITULATE.<eos> FROM LONDON, THE KING AND PRINCE COLLABORATED WITH RESISTANCE GROUPS ACROSS THE COUNTRY.<eos> THE KING'S CHOICE WAS A UNIQUE INTERVENTION IN THE POLITICAL PROCESS<eos> IT REMAINS A FIGHTING SYMBOL FOR A FREE NORWAY, DEMOCRATIC AND INDEPENDENT.
It's one of the most effective substances in the world for rapid temperature reduction.<eos> This liquid helium, where do you get it?<eos> - Why do you need it?<eos> - He doesn't, dummy.<eos> He just wants to know where it comes from so we can track down the guy that blasted our colleague with it.
Easy, Ed.<eos> I'm sure Harvey was just being colorful.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah. I was just being colorful, Ed. I'm sorry.<eos> It's extremely rare and expensive.
Test subject 014 is in his 40s, appears to be in good health, and shows no signs of damage sustained during vitrification.<eos> I'm now ready to commence the reanimation experiment.<eos> You are correct.<eos> Wayne Enterprises does manufacture liquid helium.<eos> For years, it was used as part of our cryogenics program.
Wayne Enterprises does manufacture liquid helium.<eos> For years, it was used as part of our cryogenics program.<eos> Cryowhatics?<eos> It's the branch of physics dealing with the production and effects of extremely low temperatures.<eos> My understanding is that there were some promising experiments being carried out in the program, but, alas, it was shut down.
Previously on Gotham...<eos> Last night some psycho froze a cop to death.<eos> He was using supercooled liquid helium.<eos> It's one of the most effective substances in the world for rapid temperature reduction.

Of course.<eos> They're for my condition.<eos> Your heart?<eos> I have a hole in it.<eos> It keeps getting bigger apparently.
!<eos> Where is it?<eos> !<eos> I want my ice cream!<eos> What flavor is it?
Where is it?<eos> !<eos> I want my ice cream!<eos> What flavor is it?<eos> ! What flavor is it?
I can't.<eos> Listen to me...<eos> - That's far enough.<eos> - Alfred! Well, look around you, Master Bruce.<eos> Listen, I've no idea what you are, but whatever that thing is... it's bloody dangerous.
I'll wager Strange has her in the secret lab where he created Azrael.<eos> But Strange runs Arkham.<eos> He's seen there every day.<eos> The lab must be accessed through Arkham.<eos> You're thinking it's underground.
But guilt is useless.<eos> Love, Jim.<eos> Love is our guide.<eos> Time's up, I'm afraid.<eos> In the spirit of intimacy and honesty, I have been speaking about your life as if it had a future.
It's too late. - All right, all right, all right.<eos> It's too late. They fucked us.<eos> Ahmet offered Zeppelin their own label. - What?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Yeah, you believe that shit? He had it in the fucking deal.
- I knew it.<eos> That's terrific.<eos> When can I purchase a copy?<eos> - Christmas.<eos> It's a Christmas album. - Oh.
That's terrific.<eos> When can I purchase a copy?<eos> - Christmas.<eos> It's a Christmas album. - Oh.<eos> What you gonna call it?
You are so clever.<eos> The whole staff loves you.<eos> I have never seen the professor laugh so much.<eos> I love your smile.<eos> It lights up your eyes.
No, I don't want to be here.<eos> It's just the medicine.<eos> Trust it.<eos> It's just the medicine.<eos> Every time you end the life inside of you, it will come back stronger.
We're almost together again.<eos> You are so close now.<eos> What's that picture?<eos> It's called an icon.<eos> It's a symbol of faith.
Haver of pussy okay, so we'll get everything squared away immediately.<eos> Hi, is this Allison?<eos> Yeah, you responded to my ad online.<eos> Yeah, the webcam stuff.<eos> No, no, no, no, it's nothing like porno.
Hi, is this Allison?<eos> Yeah, you responded to my ad online.<eos> Yeah, the webcam stuff.<eos> No, no, no, no, it's nothing like porno.<eos> It's nothing like porno at all.
Uh, no, Cookie Crisp is number one for me, but it's in my top five, I would say.<eos> - Is that, like, made of cookies?<eos> - Yeah, it's like tiny cookies.<eos> - That does not sound healthy.<eos> - It's cereal.
- Running, you ass!<eos> Look, he can't just murder people with a gun, okay?<eos> That's fucking boring.<eos> What if the murderer strangles someone?<eos> Because strangling is scary 'cause it's really personal, 'cause you have to, like, look 'em in the eye when you do it.

All the great philanthropists of our time are businessmen.<eos> They're entrepreneurs, innovators.<eos> My save haven project for refugees, which we began in '98, is the true expression of my belief in a commitment to the wider world.<eos> Because my good fortune means nothing unless it also lifts up my fellow man.
- Mr Roper?<eos> - Yes, sir.<eos> Thank you so much.<eos> My safe haven project for refugees, which we began in '98, is the true expression of my belief in a commitment to the wider world.<eos> Because my good fortune means nothing unless it also lifts up my fellow man.
- Oh, all right.<eos> Pretty, isn't she?<eos> I went to New York to buy a painting and came back with her.<eos> Liar. You said you were buying a horse.<eos> It was a painting of a horse.
I want your reassurance that there is no risk attached to this transaction.<eos> Can you give this assurance, Mr Roper?<eos> We had a minor issue.<eos> Internal.<eos> It's been investigated and addressed.
Please come inside.<eos> Let's see if we can feed and sustain you before we get down to business.<eos> And did you get the sweater?<eos> Great.<eos> Does it fit?
We have received intelligence of our own.<eos> We are changing the guard.<eos> Good.<eos> How was your meeting?<eos> It was fine.

Kurdistan. And the satellites couldn't make anything of it. So... the Head of Station sent me.<eos> That's not entirely true, I volunteered, actually.<eos> Mr Burr was absolutely furious when he found out.<eos> But, you know, what's the point otherwise?<eos> And... when we got there, it was a sports day, well, it had been a sports day.
They said no.<eos> I've lost my boy and I need to know where he is!<eos> Right, so this is what we know.<eos> A British ship called the Leila Jane docked in Istanbul two days ago.<eos> It's got no right to be anywhere near Istanbul, it should be in the Azores and it should be full of crop sprayers.

Who was driving that car?<eos> Don't worry, sir.<eos> Here he is.<eos> And would you believe it, Mr Barghati, he doesn't even have a driving license?<eos> It has a tandem warhead fitted with two shaped charges, guaranteed for penetration of surface and base reactive armour.
Yep. I think we should do that.<eos> We sold our house!<eos> We sold our house!<eos> We did it! Whoo!<eos> Don't get too psyched because you haven't sold it yet.
Fuck!<eos> Get out of the way!<eos> I got your weed!<eos> Move!<eos> Which one is it?
Give me the fucking weed!<eos> Who's laughing now, clown?<eos> Who's laughing now?<eos> Ow! Stop!<eos> It's garbage!
Who's laughing now, clown?<eos> Who's laughing now?<eos> Ow! Stop!<eos> It's garbage!<eos> It's not weed!
"No, I won't. I'm not coming for you."<eos> Yellow stars.<eos> What color for her dress? Mmm?<eos> What is the water doing?<eos> It's boiling.
That's why I live here. It's a different life.<eos> I'm trying to bring who I really am into focus.<eos> I would have offered you these quarters for your comfort, but I couldn't.<eos> Why is that?<eos> Well, a hundred years ago... the President of the Republic died in this bed, and it has to be kept this way for all time.
You stole my phone.<eos> You stole my phone. Yeah.<eos> He stole my fucking phone.<eos> You stole my fucking phone! Where is it?<eos> Where the fuck is it?
You stole my phone. Yeah.<eos> He stole my fucking phone.<eos> You stole my fucking phone! Where is it?<eos> Where the fuck is it?<eos> Where is it?
Why?<eos> What happens tomorrow?<eos> I don't know, but he's gonna make some big announcement, possibly expose Vincent.<eos> I mean, this Duncan guy is legit, he's been investigating all the exposure threats DHS covered up-- cold cases, maulings, vigilante stuff.<eos> And since his blog is starting to gain traction with the fringe crowd, we've got to stop him before it goes wide.
But he took a turn when he got older, okay?<eos> You can't ignore that!<eos> How can you be okay with him being here after what he did?<eos> He made a mistake and he did a horrible, unforgivable thing, and... damn it, he's paid for that.<eos> It's ruined his life, and I'm gonna be here for him.
Oh... for you.<eos> What is it with y'all and these things, huh?<eos> Well, it's perfect for lonesome travelers like us, right?<eos> It's gloves, a new piece, and keys for your loaner car.<eos> Now, it's parked downstairs.
I'm not going to tell.<eos> It's a hole in the roof and you spend your last money on a three day wedding?<eos> - It doesn't even count as a real wedding.<eos> - It does for us.<eos> And by the way, it is Glenn's last money, not mine.
You'll do.<eos> What are you uploading?<eos> 35 years of vitally important data.<eos> It's more information than any single drive could hold.<eos> A host's brain, however, especially once it's been emptied out, like this poor schmuck, is quite capacious.
Jealous.<eos> Totally.<eos> Oh, I forgot. ‭I got you a present. One sec.<eos> Such a beautiful wrapping job. It's a shame to open it.<eos> It's a gift. Be grateful.
You going to tell me what we're doing here?<eos> I've got a problem.<eos> Okay.<eos> This problem, I can't solve it myself.<eos> This problem, is it a who or a what?
You want me to quit Davis Main? That's fine!<eos> I never wanted that job in the first place.<eos> I can't get through to you.<eos> Life is not one big game of Let's Make A Deal.<eos> Yes, it is.
- Tell me how that helps me.<eos> - You won't have to talk to the cops.<eos> You won't have to do any time.<eos> There's no killing, but your Tuco problem it goes away.<eos> It's all there.
Hey, Gesualdo, could you skip vacuuming tonight, please? Hey. Five minutes.<eos> Just give me five minutes.<eos> Here's how we're gonna handle this travesty of justice.<eos> Wexler v. Hamlin Hamlin McGill? You want me to sue my own firm?<eos> Filing's all typed up, it's ready to go.
- I mean, tonight. - Tonight?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Well, I mean, finish your hot dog first, but...<eos> Now, you put that letter into Howard's office tonight.<eos> It's on his premises. You've officially given notice.
Jimmy, I got it.<eos> - You got Mesa Verde?<eos> - Yes!<eos> I mean, there's nothing in writing yet, but the lunch went...<eos> It kicked ass.
- Is it?<eos> Aye, unless ye want him running back to Scotland to seek his vengeance and that would most likely end up with Jamie being arrested and hanged whether he kills Randall or not.<eos> But I'm living a lie.<eos> Hey.<eos> You're keeping a secret to save his life and if it keeps the lad from running off in a blind fury only to meet his maker at the end of a rope, I'll be keeping that secret with ye.
You're friends with the Comte St. Germain?<eos> You may call us rivals.<eos> A lady's maid knows what does and does not occur in her mistress' boudoir.<eos> What I sell is bitter cascara.<eos> Makes the enemy suffer visibly, but it doesn't kill them.
Poison, really.<eos> It will rid you of the child, but it can also kill you.<eos> But what other choice do I have?<eos> Do you want the baby?<eos> Of course I want it. It's my lover's.

Claire.<eos> There's nothing you could have done.<eos> I should have tried to get him.<eos> If you had, you would be dead, just like the soldier, the corporal.<eos> I know that... because I told myself the same thing right after it happened.
Alice, that's right.<eos> You are responsible for looking after the honey water.<eos> Begging your pardon, I don't see what good sweet water's going to do for bullet wounds.<eos> Well, for the wounds themselves, nothing.<eos> But it will help keep the patients' blood pressure up.

And the Mafia wakes.<eos> Welcome back to Mafia show.<eos> Playing with the risk of dying.<eos> The game that changed her mind.<eos> It can be requested at the time, who has not awakened this morning.
Oh, God.<eos> Please, you got to help me!<eos> No, no.<eos> You have to help me.<eos> I'm new at this murder game, and, Jesus Christ, is it a thrill.
And when it comes to you spirits, I am captain!<eos> So listen up, mateys!<eos> There are six criteria that the U.S. Department of Interior uses to determine if a place is worthy of being called an historical landmark.<eos> This hotel fits them all.<eos> The one thing it does not yet possess is time.
This hotel fits them all.<eos> The one thing it does not yet possess is time.<eos> Age. August 23, 2026.<eos> That will make it 100 years that this hotel has stood.<eos> And on that day, it will earn its rightful distinction as an historical landmark.
How long does it feel like?<eos> Like I don't exist.<eos> Is that why you've been acting out and killing those people?<eos> I had no idea that my business was dead.<eos> Oh, it's not dead.
Like I don't exist.<eos> Is that why you've been acting out and killing those people?<eos> I had no idea that my business was dead.<eos> Oh, it's not dead.<eos> It's dying.
And maybe, just maybe, I had a little something to do with that.<eos> A little kindness, acceptance.<eos> That transformed me in ways nothing else ever could.<eos> I never thought life could be this good.<eos> Or that it might end.
-Where is she?<eos> -The master bedroom.<eos> Mrs. Hale mentioned that she might take a nap.<eos> - Is my room made up?<eos> - It's being dusted right now.
Come here.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Just chilling.<eos> Barb, is that my shirt?<eos> I don't know, is it?
Keeping it fun over 50?<eos> Who else has the wrong date, Mimi?<eos> The venue!<eos> I gave it fancy to the venue!<eos> I left your dress at a restaurant and now it's gone like so many steaming nugs.
Well, you're in a different river.<eos> The Euphrates, 'cause you 'fraidy a bunch of stuff!<eos> Kimmy, after what we've been through, just because you're out doesn't mean it's out of you.<eos> That's not true. If you're tough, you leave that stuff in... Past.<eos> And if it tries to get out, you just lock it up forever, in a bunker, like a Kimmy!
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for coming to support First Americans for Turtle Island.<eos> When the Pilgrims landed in the New World...<eos> Okay, but when the Pilgrims landed, they continued the mistreatment of indigenous peoples started by Columbus.<eos> Wait, what is this gala for? I saw "First Americans" and assumed it was some kind of super-PAC.<eos> And I thought it was for Turtle Island, that private island where people like me go to dress like turtles and do stuff to turtles.
Buy yourself a hat.<eos> What's this?<eos> $1,500?<eos> Hmm... going to Florida for a few days.<eos> I don't want this money, if it came from anything fishy.
She is very pretty.<eos> Dear Bobby,<eos> It's raining here today.<eos> Very pretty, but a little melancholy.<eos> Leonard says, its the poignancy of life, and not only do we have to embrace its meaninglessness, and celebrate life because it has no meaning.
Yes, it's over. It's all over.<eos> Oh! I'm so sorry.<eos> What happened?<eos> I brought him an anniversary present, it was our paper anniversary, so, one year...<eos> It was a Valentino letter, it was beautiful... it was a letter signed and written by Valentino.
Well, as you know... uh, Morgan was our third attempt.<eos> Our first full-term subject... developed internal features externally.<eos> It's not working.<eos> It's dropping.<eos> It expired, not long after its so-called birth.
Jealous?<eos> Maybe.<eos> But why?<eos> It... made a perfect risotto.<eos> Made it like it was nothing.
I am something new.<eos> There is no appropriate label.<eos> Do you think it's safe to say... that your consciousness is superior?<eos> No.<eos> It's just different.
- Need help?<eos> I don't have my phone.<eos> Do you think you could call me a tow?<eos> - What happened?<eos> - I don't know. It just quit.
Try to keep up!<eos> So, my guess would be the fuel pump?<eos> - Great.<eos> Shut your guess-hole.<eos> - Oh, come on! It's gotta be under warranty.
And, again, seriously, about the dogs...<eos> - Well?<eos> What is wrong with this thing?<eos> Why can't I dial out?<eos> Because it's not... Hey, wait.
It's been a long time since I killed anybody.<eos> You killed some of the bikers?<eos> They tried to wood-chipper me! - No. I meant...<eos> - Although to be fair, if you open what you think is an empty trunk, and suddenly there's a guy in there, you're gonna overreact.<eos> Kind of like that time I walked into that motel room, and it was full of seagulls.
I know, Cyril, but think of the alternative.<eos> His hands are tied.<eos> And yes, yes, dude, I will pay you, but the money's not in my house.<eos> It's, it's, it's--<eos> It's in Tom's house, and-and Bill's house.
Why don't we just find his mother?<eos> Why, just so she can bury him?<eos> Yeah, because trying to kill Barry has gone so well for you in the past.<eos> Yeah, Lana, but this time it's, um...<eos> Were you gonna say, "This time it's personal"?
And I get it.<eos> I get why you did.<eos> - I wore it bec...<eos> - Because, come to find out, you and I find ourselves - in the same boat. - What?<eos> And it's a totally shit boat, and the cargo is pathetic petty jealousy.
That's not a white shirt.<eos> Well, it's whiter than yours.<eos> Come on.<eos> I've done this before.<eos> It's the wrong color.
He's not back in prison for some other crime.<eos> And wasn't in prison for some other crime before your testimony put him there.<eos> It wasn't a mistake.<eos> The appellate court disagreed.<eos> It had a different interpretation, that's all.
One is missing.<eos> Couldn't it be somewhere else in the house?<eos> No, I checked everywhere.<eos> It's not there.<eos> If this missing knife was there, presumably, it could cause the same wounds to the victim as this one?
This is the basement level.<eos> Correct.<eos> - What's this?<eos> - The front gate.<eos> I notice it's ajar.
Correct.<eos> - What's this?<eos> - The front gate.<eos> I notice it's ajar.<eos> It's ajar because it doesn't close.
You know who said that?<eos> Me.<eos> - Where? - A testimonial dinner.<eos> Your praise sounds so sincere.<eos> Are you saying it wasn't?
You think it's any better out here?<eos> Back off.<eos> What are you gonna do, Travis? You feel strong?<eos> Please, let me explain the rules of the boat.<eos> Rule number one, it's my boat.
Back off.<eos> What are you gonna do, Travis? You feel strong?<eos> Please, let me explain the rules of the boat.<eos> Rule number one, it's my boat.<eos> Rule number two, it is my boat.
Please, let me explain the rules of the boat.<eos> Rule number one, it's my boat.<eos> Rule number two, it is my boat.<eos> And if there remains any confusion about rules one and two,<eos> I offer rule number three, it's my goddamn boat.
The billboard outside cutler's office.<eos> At the time of the murder, there's no artwork on it or graffiti.<eos> That street art was put up this morning. After cutler's murder.<eos> Maybe the artist that put it up there is saying something or saw something.<eos> I'm gonna see if it's signed or if anybody knows who made it.
Something's there.<eos> Some material appears apparent, but it's also not there.<eos> I used backscattered electron imaging to separate and identify inorganic particles from organic materials, and I found neither.<eos> There's no organic material on this band-aid, but there's no inorganic material either.<eos> It's not alive.

Mulder, you've got the lens pointed the wrong way.<eos> Yeah, it's the new camera app. But look.<eos> It shot blood at me. From out its eyeball, Scully...<eos> I think. It was hard for me to see, because I had blood in my eyes.<eos> I haven't done the blood analysis yet, but it's probably residue from the prior attack on this victim.
Maybe this is some GMO experiment run amok by some military-agro-big-pharma corporation.<eos> Maybe this guy is its chief geneticist, who recklessly experimented on himself and now transforms into a fiend who needs to feast on human flesh.<eos> To which I know you're going to say...<eos> "But, Mulder, that sounds like the paranoid ravings of some lunatic madman."<eos> I don't know what this thing is, Scully, and I don't know exactly how it came to be, I just...

No, a job.<eos> My craze wouldn't be satiated until I found steady work.<eos> So I walked straight into town and rather tragically I... I found something right away.<eos> Now, this model comes with 3,000 gigabertz of pixelbitz...<eos> It's perfect for me.

I found something right away.<eos> Now, this model comes with 3,000 gigabertz of pixelbitz...<eos> It's perfect for me.<eos> I have no idea what I'm saying, and neither do my customers.<eos> You can see from the shape of it that it's quite rectangular...
MAN: When the Founding Fathers signed the Constitution, that's when.<eos> The same document that's supposed to protect my freedom of speech.<eos> MAN: But not your freedom to hate!<eos> What is wrong with you?<eos> WOMAN: It is not a freedom to hate!
Oh, Susan, enjoy the absurdity of our world.<eos> It's a lot less painful.<eos> And believe me, our world is a lot less painful than the real world.<eos> Yeah, why are we driving this old thing to Marfa?<eos> Because I just had it completely rebuilt.
It's a lot less painful.<eos> And believe me, our world is a lot less painful than the real world.<eos> Yeah, why are we driving this old thing to Marfa?<eos> Because I just had it completely rebuilt.<eos> It's a classic.
Why don't you go ask in there, man?<eos> I'll see you in a minute, okay?<eos> Okay, sweetie?<eos> We're going to my camp.<eos> It's in White Creek near the trailer where they took your folks.
-(MONITOR FLAT LINING)<eos> (MACHINE POWERS DOWN)<eos> What the hell happened here?<eos> It's a symbiotic defense.<eos> If we pull that thing off by force, it'll kill Kara.
ALEX:<eos> No!<eos> I'm trying to remind you of the truth.<eos> Life isn't perfect.<eos> (SOBS) I know it can be hard and it can be lonely.
(SOBS) I know it can be hard and it can be lonely.<eos> Especially for you.<eos> You have sacrificed and you have lost so much.<eos> I wish you could've had a life with your family.<eos> But even if you did, Kara, it wouldn't be this.
Those pristine prints on Allen's leather jacket? No matches. Not local, not national.<eos> Mm-hmm. Figures.<eos> Anything else?<eos> S.I.D. found trace evidence of old blood in the trunk of his Bentley.<eos> And it's not Allen's.
Play.<eos> You motherfuckers, I'm gonna kill you both.<eos> The tracking App.<eos> The pin will tell us where her phone's at.<eos> They would have turned it off after she called.
At least you know it is a movie. That's something.<eos> Of course I know it's a movie.<eos> Anyway, tell Griffin about the blood in the car.<eos> Give him the GPS data, let the Feds figure it out.<eos> Even if it doesn't pan out, you've made the effort.
She said he was headed north on 14 toward Lancaster and Palmdale, which is ground zero at the moment.<eos> Ex-cop.<eos> Knows the moves.<eos> He would have ditched the car by now, right?<eos> That was our assumption, too. We're waiting for it to turn up.
- September.<eos> - Till then, he's got the gag walk.<eos> What do you think it means?<eos> Above my pay grade.<eos> Can't say I'm sorry that it got out.
A Time Master's sacred charge is to do no harm to the timeline.<eos> Can you imagine what a timeship would look like in, say, Victorian England?<eos> Holographic indigenous camouflage projection.<eos> Indeed.<eos> It's called the Waverider.
Can you imagine what a timeship would look like in, say, Victorian England?<eos> Holographic indigenous camouflage projection.<eos> Indeed.<eos> It's called the Waverider.<eos> It's been my ship for over a decade.
It's been my ship for over a decade.<eos> Shall we?<eos> Excuse me, would you mind, um...<eos> Thank you.<eos> Whoa. I bet it uses ionic propulsion.
Please.<eos> That's gonna draw them here.<eos> I need light.<eos> Michonne, towel.<eos> Hold it here.
You ever read that book "Catcher in the Rye"? Yes, sir.<eos> You think it ought to be in the library?<eos> Uh...<eos> Yes?<eos> That book has prostitution in it, among other things.
It's after him!<eos> -He's in danger.<eos> We have to find him! We--<eos> -What exactly was this thing?<eos> It was some kind of animal, you said?
-He's in danger.<eos> We have to find him! We--<eos> -What exactly was this thing?<eos> It was some kind of animal, you said?<eos> Uh, no, it was... It was almost... human, but it wasn't. It...
We have to find him! We--<eos> -What exactly was this thing?<eos> It was some kind of animal, you said?<eos> Uh, no, it was... It was almost... human, but it wasn't. It...<eos> It had these long arms and...
-What exactly was this thing?<eos> It was some kind of animal, you said?<eos> Uh, no, it was... It was almost... human, but it wasn't. It...<eos> It had these long arms and...<eos> it didn't have a face.
It was some kind of animal, you said?<eos> Uh, no, it was... It was almost... human, but it wasn't. It...<eos> It had these long arms and...<eos> it didn't have a face.<eos> It didn't have a face?
- It's all so close.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Exactly.<eos> I mean, it's all within a mile or something.<eos> Whatever this thing is, it's... it's not traveling far.
- But again, this is all...<eos> - Theoretical.<eos> But... but what if this gate already existed?<eos> Well, if it did, I... I think we'd know.<eos> It would disrupt gravity, the magnetic field, our environment.
- Theoretical.<eos> But... but what if this gate already existed?<eos> Well, if it did, I... I think we'd know.<eos> It would disrupt gravity, the magnetic field, our environment.<eos> Heck, it might even swallow us up whole.
What do yours say?<eos> North.<eos> Makes no damn sense.<eos> Maybe the gate moved.<eos> No, I don't think it's the gate.
You didn't say there was a drawing.<eos> Yeah, there was a drawing of a... an adult and a child.<eos> -It said "Eleven" on it.<eos> -Was it good?<eos> It was a kid's drawing, Joyce. It was stick figures.
It was a kid's drawing, Joyce. It was stick figures.<eos> Wasn't Will.<eos> Earl...<eos> The night that Benny died, Earl said he saw some kid with a shaved head with Benny.<eos> Now, I pressed him, he said it might be Will, but maybe...
We have to find it again.<eos> You wanna go back out there?<eos> Maybe we don't have to.<eos> When I saw it, it was feeding on that deer.<eos> -Meaning it's... it's a predator, right?
But it doesn't hunt in packs like them.<eos> It's always alone, like... like a bear.<eos> And remember at Steve's, when Barb cut herself?<eos> -And then, last night, the deer...<eos> -Hmm, it was bleeding, too.
We have to go back to the station.<eos> What?<eos> Your mom and Hopper are just walking in there like bait.<eos> That thing is still in there.<eos> And we can't just sit here and let it get them, too.
It has to be dead.<eos> It has to be.<eos> Come on.<eos> Is that my house?<eos> It was hurt.
Sergeant Willis of the New York City Police Department.<eos> - Are you Mrs. Finestra?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - So the car was impounded?<eos> - It was on the street, ma'am. Half a block from the site of the collapse of the Mercer Arts Center.
I'm insisting they rename the band. Oh, yes, please.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Did your mom talk to you about that?<eos> The heirloom.<eos> Yeah, it's beautiful.
So I'm gonna help you, but you gotta be straight with me. Come on.<eos> A few, including you.<eos> - Does your family know?<eos> - No. If you decide you want this inheritance, and uh, you're willing to prove that you're Chelsea, it becomes public record.<eos> Anyone has access to the will once it goes through Probate.
Big, bright, explosive.<eos> Have you seen Shao's latest?<eos> "Clan of the Dragon Fist."<eos> Wait. Shaolin Fantastic has a new piece?<eos> -I gotta check it.
It's a stupid idea.<eos> -Stupid.<eos> -Look, man. The gun's a personal choice.<eos> That Clan of the Dragon Fist piece was fly.<eos> But let it be your last, and focus, Grasshopper.

Yeah.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - Okay, we're, uh... Here's the tune.<eos> - "Oogie Boogie Disco Biscuit."<eos> - It's a party anthem.

Sometimes I come home from work and I'm happy.<eos> I actually feel happy.<eos> And then I see your car there parked and I realize you're home and my heart... sinks.<eos> Is this about my old job? Is that what this is about?<eos> I want to save my life while I still care about it.
- Shh. - Oh, sorry.<eos> Just have to be quiet 'cause he's sleeping.<eos> How long has he been sleeping?<eos> 43 hours.<eos> Technically he's in a coma, but it's a medically induced coma, so it's more like just sleeping.
- The baby is quiet?<eos> - The baby is quiet!<eos> - Why didn't you say anything?<eos> - Oh, no!<eos> Why is it quiet?
You've travelled all over these parts.<eos> Isn't there anywhere we could go?<eos> Well, there is a place<eos> I heard about down south... where the mountains meet the sea.<eos> They say the water's so pure there, it'll wash the past clean off you. And you can start again.
Well, then everything... everything changed.<eos> Changed how?<eos> Wyatt disappeared while out on maneuvers.<eos> He came back with some strange ideas.<eos> He claimed this land didn't belong to the old natives or the new settlers, that it belonged to something that had yet to come... that it belonged to him.
See?<eos> Memory, improvisation, self-interest...<eos> And at the top?<eos> Never got there.<eos> But he had a notion of what it might be.
Now that we're all friends, you can call me Lawrence.<eos> And why don't we settle in?<eos> It's a long ride to the front.<eos> You want a sip of this swill?<eos> Don't worry, it ain't nitro.
This place you're looking for, what makes you so sure it exists?<eos> I'm not.<eos> My life before, I was ...<eos> so sure of the world.<eos> But now it feels like a lie.
Dolores.<eos> I've been pretending my whole life.<eos> Pretending I don't mind, pretending I belong.<eos> My life's built on it.<eos> And it's a good life, it's a life I've always wanted.
He may have moved them.<eos> What's behind this door?<eos> What door?<eos> - What is this place?<eos> - It's a remote diagnostic facility.
Hospital want passport and he not agree.<eos> It's for medical records. It's confidential.<eos> A doctor or a hospital won't report him to the police.<eos> If it spreads, he could lose his leg.<eos> He has to go every week until it heals.
Are you a reporter?<eos> No, I'm a doctor.<eos> I work at the practice opposite, on the expressway.<eos> Excuse me...<eos> Which lump of concrete was it?
Never seen her.<eos> What are you trying to involve me in?<eos> I'm not accusing you.<eos> I just want her name to let her family know.<eos> - You are accusing me, it's my van.
My assistant record your name.<eos> Clear?<eos> Away now.<eos> - You Must think there lighting effects.<eos> This dress is too small. But with greater it is beautiful. How old are you?
"Nailed to the ground, we watched."<eos> "Deciduous beauty, more beautiful than life itself."<eos> And Mercure de France writes:<eos> "Art that is stunning."<eos> You have another room. Here it is too stuffy.
Let me see your hand.<eos> - That's a big cut.<eos> A lot of letters you wrote.<eos> You know, they say that cheating's not about the other person.<eos> It's about you and... your need for feelin' sexy or whatever. Being desired.
Ah, you see? Just like a barrister.<eos> Go straight to my weak point.<eos> Um, well, I know the libretto to The Magic Flute.<eos> That's, uh... That's all the German I have.<eos> It's probably not very useful in our forthcoming encounter.
It takes 20 times more cyanide to kill lice than it does human beings.<eos> Twenty times! Just Leuchter didn't know that.<eos> Oh, this whole thing is infuriating.<eos> I know.<eos> It beggars belief.
I would venture to suggest Pictures at an Execution.<eos> My execution.<eos> The word "denier" is particularly evil.<eos> For the chosen victim it is like being called a wife beater or a pedophile.<eos> It is enough for the label to be attached for the attachee to be designated a pariah, an outcast from normal society.

The roof of the gas chamber was supported by concrete columns and wire mesh pillars.<eos> Professor?<eos> In your simulation, that is the roof in this big photograph here?<eos> Uh, yes.<eos> It is the self-same roof?
You can see the pillars with the wire mesh columns next to them.<eos> You have drawn in those wire mesh columns, have you not?<eos> In the sketches and on the computer?<eos> One of my students did, yes.<eos> But the wire mesh is an addition, it is not based on drawings and blueprints, is it?

I don't care.<eos> You're here, you're not. That's your problem.<eos> You're home. You come, you go, you stay.<eos> Fine. Not everything's so great in your small life.<eos> - 'Cause it is small.
- Nope.<eos> And we do all the landscaping. We maintain the pool.<eos> I still can't believe he built that thing by himself.<eos> Yeah, well, you don't know your son too well, then.<eos> Well, if you're gonna show it, it's a little too personalized.

Enough to get a business plan together, to redevelop, to approach the bank for a loan.<eos> How much?<eos> $30 million.<eos> And, what, Jarrod Slade's just gonna hand over the money just like that?<eos> It's already in our bank account.
Can we at least talk about this?<eos> There's nothing to say.<eos> Nerida, please.<eos> This redevelopment deal really gonna happen?<eos> If the numbers crunch our way, just might. It's looking pretty good.
Get the hell off me!<eos> Please, no.<eos> You want our blood?<eos> You want our blood?<eos> That's what you're really after, isn't it?

That's how we met.<eos> Yes, Kimberlina wanted to be a dirty blonde and I happily obliged.<eos> Wow! They're not kidding when they say this stuff attracts women!<eos> I could smell you from the kitchen.<eos> It's my own unique body spray combo of Dark Temptation and Excite.
No, no, no, no!<eos> Okay, Cosmo.<eos> Mom says you gotta stop going in the house, but I have a better idea.<eos> Your very own potty trainer!<eos> It worked for me and it can work for you.
Just because I didn't get the clinic doesn't mean my dream can't come true.<eos> Maybe I should open my own clinic.<eos> Oh! And a window.<eos> Maybe the universe is telling me it's time to do my own thing.<eos> If it's my dream, then it's up to me to make it happen.
Why, thank you.<eos> No, not the room, my hair.<eos> I love my hair.<eos> Kimmy, we love the room.<eos> It's like our own little honeymoon suite on steroids.
But as you can see, we have formed an impenetrable circle around you.<eos> Fernando, I'm sorry, but this just doesn't feel right.<eos> I don't want our family on the racing circuit.<eos> Ramona is really happy here, and I love living with Stephanie and D.J. and her boys.<eos> I like my life the way it is and I'm not ready to change it.
Okay, I'm close.<eos> Why would he let them implant something in his cheek?<eos> They said it was a biometric study.<eos> A dentist inserted this tiny little grain, but now...<eos> It's growing.
- God damn it.<eos> Did you even try to talk him out of it?<eos> He wouldn't listen to reason. They're not gonna be happy about any of this.<eos> - Can you see? Do you need more light? - It's good.<eos> It's right there.
- Follow your gut.<eos> - Exactly.<eos> And leave the managing to the managers.<eos> Life is hard enough without dwelling on every little thing.<eos> And... man, is it hard.
I'm sorry for you. No, I really am.<eos> All you over there in Central Point don't know up from down. All mixed up.<eos> Part Cherokee,<eos> Rappahannock, part niggra, part white.<eos> Blood don't know what it wants to be.
Erling, are you alright?<eos> -What's in that parcel?<eos> -What this is?<eos> Are you curious?<eos> Who do you think it's for?
What kind of order?<eos> You know I can't talk about that.<eos> -Do you usually change clothes?<eos> -I haven't been with another woman!<eos> I followed an order and had to change my shirt because it had blood on it!
-Yes, the book...<eos> -Did you read it?<eos> -Haven't you started?<eos> -I'm not done yet.<eos> It's a little slow, but it's... It's really interesting.
-Haven't you started?<eos> -I'm not done yet.<eos> It's a little slow, but it's... It's really interesting.<eos> -What's interesting?<eos> -Well, it's got...

That's an order.<eos> Sigurd.<eos> Sigurd Sønsteby.<eos> Thank you very much for this amazing meal.<eos> It's great.
There are no female officers in the Continental Army.<eos> It's a pet name.<eos> I... call him Crane.<eos> Regrettably, the veil of secrecy precludes our sharing of details, Betsy.<eos> We are to restore a powerful, supernatural artifact, and it is our only hope against a foe who holds the fate of the world in his hands.

You were right, we need to look into this trafficking<eos> It's very strange that he didn't have a phone<eos> - The Lithuanian? - Yeah<eos> Maybe he tossed it when we were chasing him<eos> Maybe it's buried under a ton of snow out there Good point.
- I need to show you something.<eos> What?<eos> Listen<eos> It's the ice.<eos> It's condensing
It's hard to let good people go.<eos> And I know you're not the type to take other people's feelings lightly, Harold, but that's what I like about you.<eos> You've got a good heart.<eos> Go with it.<eos> It won't steer you wrong.
Ah, you can't be too careful these days.<eos> Like I said, they're after me, not you.<eos> Just give me the docs, and I'll be on my way.<eos> I figure whoever is running those black ops must have considerable resources.<eos> And before I broke their last phone, it rang.
He admitted it on his deathbed, the guy who took the photo of the Loch Ness monster.<eos> -Have you seen that picture?<eos> -It's photoshopped.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> It's a pike.
Excuse me.<eos> -You have a nice house.<eos> -Thank you.<eos> -Expensive?<eos> -Yes, but it's inherited money.
Hi!<eos> It's Sharif Zamani's phone.<eos> -You took it?<eos> -Yeah. At the ceremony, I called a number he got a text from, and I could hear a phone ringing in the crowd.<eos> -Did you find out who it was?
Even I appreciate a fairy tale ending, Harry.<eos> Family politics, over-cooked meat, monogamy.<eos> What's not to love? Hmm.<eos> Bear takes one scoop of kibble twice a day.<eos> Oh, and if you could answer the pay phone, should it ring.
No. But the one I did catch isn't going anywhere.<eos> I didn't figure an assassin would faint at the sight of his own blood.<eos> Hang on.<eos> I think I just found our target.<eos> Which of the Turners is it?
Hang on.<eos> I think I just found our target.<eos> Which of the Turners is it?<eos> None of them.<eos> It's Maggie, the wedding photographer.
Permit for demolition of Tunnel 85.<eos> You feel like going underground, buddy?<eos> Finch, any luck with those photos?<eos> I'm recovering a deleted photo from her camera's memory now.<eos> It was taken the night before Don Juan's big race.
Mr. Reese, how's Detective Fusco?<eos> Still won't see me.<eos> Think you could help me find info on someone?<eos> You know if I'm going to help you with your cover job, I should request a stipend from the NYPD.<eos> It's for Root.
Having a little trouble with the laptop.<eos> I caught it doing something new.<eos> It's attempting to send out electromagnetic pulses, trying to connect with the whole network of Samaritan-infected devices around the world:<eos> laptops, printers, phones.<eos> It's a modified version of the Funtenna hack.
That's what Max found.<eos> What did Max find?<eos> Electromagnetic pulses cause buzzing in the AM radio signal.<eos> Buzzing that most people would write off as harmless interference, but a trained Samaritan operative...<eos> Would recognize it as hidden code.
When the time comes, you'll know what to do.<eos> And I know this is an ugliness you never wanted, but sometimes you have to fight a little.<eos> We're fighting a war that's already over.<eos> All this mayhem?<eos> It isn't some plucky underground resistance movement.
And I know this is an ugliness you never wanted, but sometimes you have to fight a little.<eos> We're fighting a war that's already over.<eos> All this mayhem?<eos> It isn't some plucky underground resistance movement.<eos> It's an extinction burst.
But it's the only way to stop Samaritan.<eos> I sense a tone of regret in your voice.<eos> Call it responsibility for the situation I've put our friends in.<eos> They've always been aware of the risk, Harold.<eos> But it started with me. Yes.
Oh...<eos> Sometimes I wonder if we couldn't have done something more... meaningful.<eos> You mean the DoD project.<eos> Harold, that's ancient history.<eos> I know, but I sometimes think if we'd have kept trying, maybe it would have worked.
Thank you for that.<eos> You're welcome.<eos> Now I'm afraid this is where I'm get off.<eos> The entire building is shielded in copper mesh.<eos> It's a Faraday cage.
From your precious Machine, no doubt.<eos> You think you've won, but you haven't.<eos> What I think, Harold, is that it's time we had another talk.<eos> Our game of cat and mouse seems to be coming to an end.<eos> I don't consider this a game, and it's not over yet.

This is what I do, remember?<eos> When you came to me, you gave me a job.<eos> A purpose.<eos> At first, well, I had been trying to save the world for so long, I... saving one life at a time seemed a bit anticlimactic.<eos> But then I realized... sometimes one life... If it's the right life... That's enough.
Ok. Love you.<eos> And no doughnuts!<eos> I'm not sure why I said that.<eos> The brain is a remarkable thing.<eos> It can... it can re-wire itself, repair itself.
The selected AirPort network "Johnson" requires a password.<eos> Password.<eos> "Prairie" failure to authenticate.<eos> Password, password.<eos> Where is it?
Uh... there's, uh, there's no electricity here.<eos> But you live in the neighborhood.<eos> Could I get your password?<eos> Our Internet's down.<eos> It's important.
But I also want to make sure you control the narrative.<eos> That you profit from it.<eos> And did it heal them?<eos> All the money?<eos> It's given his family a security that they've never known.
How do I get back to the others?<eos> Now you know sacrifice.<eos> Now you are ready for what comes with this gift.<eos> Swallow it.<eos> It's the seed of light.
Lots of shit doesn't make sense, man.<eos> Don't be a douche. OA wouldn't say she's an angel and then vanish.<eos> No, that's exactly what an angel would do.<eos> Homer told me his football coach once said to him,<eos> "Knowledge is a rumor until it lives in the body."
Lie down.<eos> Suck your thumb like a baby.<eos> We got lucky.<eos> We thought that the gas was knocking us out cold.<eos> It wasn't, it was making us compliant.
What do you study?<eos> You.<eos> And people like you.<eos> Your uncanny skill level, given how long you've been playing, is miraculous to your audience.<eos> It's inexplicable.
Just what?<eos> I don't even know.<eos> I have worked so hard for this--<eos> Yes, you've worked so hard, but you do not know what life is, Alfonso.<eos> You don't know how hard it really gets.
She's had these night terrors ever since she was a girl.<eos> Her nose bleeds and, um...<eos> it's quite terrifying for her.<eos> Our family doctor, years ago, prescribed medication...<eos> It didn't work.
Her nose bleeds and, um...<eos> it's quite terrifying for her.<eos> Our family doctor, years ago, prescribed medication...<eos> It didn't work.<eos> - It helped a little.
Here's to, uh, family. Uh, um...<eos> To family... to all the families.<eos> The house looks nice, Dad.<eos> Thank you. We just redid the foyer.<eos> - It's very spacious. - Mm-hmm.
That's not where I was heading at all.<eos> What?<eos> No, I was gonna sing that pah-rumpa bum-bum song.<eos> You... you were?<eos> But, you know, it's out there now, so I guess that's good.
Move.<eos> Move! Yeah.<eos> I've been in this game a long time. 'No child left behind' is our motto.<eos> Well, it's not, you know, the official motto, but it's definitely mine.<eos> Also, as part of the transition process, I'll be needing to inspect your property, just to make sure that it's up to our high standard.
And found one called "Home", so I called you.<eos> - You have my phone?<eos> - Looks that way.<eos> Thank you! That's great.<eos> Where did you find it?
You're going to call them and cancel.<eos> Yes, you are.<eos> They'll be surprised, maybe even annoyed, but it's not a problem, you'll make another appointment.<eos> And I'll take you on an unforgettable experience.<eos> No, I'm serious. It'll change your life.
But I worked for many years with my first husband, Diane's father.<eos> He had a textile business. - Remember? - Yes.<eos> - Remember?<eos> - Yes.<eos> It was something else.
Yeah, I was thinking maybe Chalet Suisse?<eos> Double date.<eos> Who are you trying to impress?<eos> Hannibal's contract's up.<eos> So it's not so much a date as a business meeting.
PENNY:<eos> Holy shit, it looks like a toilet.<eos> SKIP: With a turd?<eos> CASPER: Just a bowl.<eos> SCOTT: Fuck, now it's like the duck and the rabbit.
- Faster.<eos> Through here.<eos> Did you hear that noise?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - It's the wall.
We're not gonna nick the whole ship, you dimwit.<eos> - We're gonna rob it.<eos> - This is bollocks.<eos> Look how heavily guarded that boat is.<eos> It's perfect.
Look how heavily guarded that boat is.<eos> It's perfect.<eos> No, it's pretty ducking far from perfect!<eos> There's no way we can get near the gold.<eos> If there's even any on board it'll be guarded like a virgin's honey pot.
If there's even any on board it'll be guarded like a virgin's honey pot.<eos> We're not going for the gold.<eos> Then what are we going for?<eos> Gunpowder.<eos> Gunpowder, is it?
But to be clear, we don't really have anyone?<eos> To be clear, I am making a play.<eos> That's what I like to call "the prisoner's dilemma."<eos> No, you don't like to call it that.<eos> That's what it's called.
- I don't see him caving.<eos> Mm, I think he will.<eos> You know, my fucking eyes are watering here.<eos> How many pints of that shitty toilet water do you splash on yourself every morning, Spyros?<eos> You think maybe it's gonna help you get some tail?
Amenities for customers only.<eos> Then I need a room.<eos> For how long?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Does it have a phone?
Don't need a prime number.<eos> - It's okay.<eos> - Yes... no, we do.<eos> Room 607 is a private residence.<eos> - It's not available.
Not deliberately, in any event.<eos> ♪ Wrong or right ♪ But... Would he kill to cover up the research that we've been conducting?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I think he would.<eos> It's bigger than you think it is.
Yeah.<eos> I think he would.<eos> It's bigger than you think it is.<eos> Bigger than even Mr. Chadwick thinks.<eos> What is it?
I'm starting to think I make a pretty good secret agent.<eos> Not your best hypothesis.<eos> A lapel pin?<eos> I've seen this symbol before.<eos> What's it mean?
Now they're pretending it never happened.<eos> If only you could prove that.<eos> Watch the Isodyne film.<eos> See for yourself what they're hiding.<eos> I already read the book, and it stunk.
And that's when the developing process comes in.<eos> You're using silver nitrate.<eos> That's what photographers use to bind images to celluloid.<eos> Come on.<eos> It's the strategic scientific reserve.
We call it the memory inhibitor.<eos> You place it like so.<eos> No.<eos> Well, you put it to the subject's temples.<eos> It disrupts the pathway of the prefrontal lobes.
Well, you put it to the subject's temples.<eos> It disrupts the pathway of the prefrontal lobes.<eos> It makes them forget the last two minutes.<eos> Amazing.<eos> And it works?
Quite the setup.<eos> Help me with this.<eos> What are those lights for?<eos> Security system.<eos> Looks like it controls the locks on the doors.
We've disguised two-way communication radios for both you and Mr. Jarvis...<eos> A pair of glasses for him and... This for you.<eos> Do you have any questions about your objective?<eos> I am a little confused about this doohickey.<eos> Why don't you come over here, show me how it works?
You tell him about that girl?<eos> What girl?<eos> A few nights ago, one of Hugh's storage facilities was raided.<eos> The atomic material used in a prototype rocket was stolen.<eos> My intel says it was Peggy Carter.
You haven't eaten in days.<eos> I shall make you a meal fit for a king...<eos> A true Hungarian feast.<eos> I've never had Hungarian food before.<eos> Is it any good?
Unfortunately, Daniel's dealing with Vernon Masters.<eos> He won't be coming.<eos> Are you ready?<eos> Miss Carter, do you not feel that the sudden and inexplicable appearance of this signal is... rather convenient?<eos> It isn't inexplicable, Mr. Jarvis.
You're more beautiful today than the day I met you.<eos> You are a terrible liar, Joe.<eos> Hey, I'm not lying!<eos> That mark on your face is nothing to be ashamed of.<eos> It's power.
Bram.<eos> I love you.<eos> I love you too.<eos> What happened to the beach photo?<eos> Did it get broken in the fire?
I think your emotions are getting the better of you.<eos> -From a man who knows.<eos> -From a man who knows.<eos> You're going to deny a man with a bad heart who's about to go under the knife?<eos> My heart may not be strong right now... but it knows what it wants.
It could be tomorrow, could be next month...<eos> And once I get them I start the installing and configure them.<eos> Come to Muscat!<eos> Look, I came to the seaside for the weekend.<eos> - Wow. - It's beautiful.
Whoever died first would send the other a sign.<eos> A sign?<eos> From the afterlife?<eos> You could call it that. You could call it a million things.<eos> But how will you know it's a sign?
I just wanted Maureen to be at peace with this place. And with Lewis' spirit.<eos> I... I just wanted to say one last...<eos> Lewis would have been very happy that this house is yours again...<eos> And I'm very glad too.<eos> Now, it's your house and...
Holy-- - Whoo!<eos> You found the car!<eos> - I found it, all right.<eos> Yeah, nearly took it for a damn spin.<eos> It's gonna be real hard to get at, though.
You found the car!<eos> - I found it, all right.<eos> Yeah, nearly took it for a damn spin.<eos> It's gonna be real hard to get at, though.<eos> - It's deep.
Kind of ruins the joke.<eos> Uh, sarcoma's like a form of cancer.<eos> - Cancer?<eos> - What? No. Not like cancer-cancer.<eos> It's, like, malignant tumors, usually, like bone or muscle, or fat...
Nope?<eos> Nobody?<eos> I win. - It didn't even work!<eos> - The second one did.<eos> As we suspected, it's a machine that cuts a fissure between our world and the Zero Matter dimension.
I am, indeed.<eos> I'll just get Mrs. Jarvis settled, and then I'll be happy to take you wherever you need to go.<eos> Oh, that won't be necessary.<eos> I've already rung for a taxi.<eos> It'll be here any moment.
You didn't have to come all this way.<eos> Oh, but I did.<eos> Shall we?<eos> Well, the paper's too big so we need a larger typeface, but the ink is good.<eos> JIMMY: Print it in two halves. CHARLES:
I'm on top of the liquor.<eos> I am the monkey in charge of bananas.<eos> What's my secret?<eos> This little device right here.<eos> I just take a little blow... (Blowing) (Electronic beep) and it tells me when it's time for a little top-up.
Jesus Christ.<eos> All right, okay. All right, that's good.<eos> That's... That's good. All right, open the fucking gate.<eos> Oh, my fuck!<eos> You got popsicle all over Lucy's car, and it was just waxed!

Man, it's (beep) awesome!<eos> Tons of dope! (Crowd laughing) So you actually allow people to smoke dope in the casino while they're gambling?<eos> Is that legal in Canada?<eos> Well, I mean, the cops don't bother us, right?<eos> I mean, it's private property, so we basically do whatever the (beep) we want.
Where's this money from?<eos> I told you, a collection.<eos> Cartier, from a collection?<eos> Stop worrying.<eos> Make the most of it.
I'm not doing it just to be nasty.<eos> Why do the poor stay poor?<eos> Because the rich take it all.<eos> No, because the poor don't dare. You have to dare to be rich.<eos> Visualise the money and it'll come.
To waste you?<eos> Are you scared or not?<eos> Then you caress.<eos> I couldn't even fit one tit into this top.<eos> It's tiny!
What did you do with my money?<eos> I'm talking to you!<eos> - You whore, just like your mum!<eos> - Shut it! Don't tell me to shut it! You little whore!<eos> Where is it?
- Sounds like Scrubby when he needs food!<eos> - Hmm! It's painful, mates.<eos> Let's get outta here.<eos> Oh!<eos> Personally, I think it sounds beautiful.
They say her body rejected the fetuses because they were deformed.<eos> Now, you must excuse me.<eos> I have to put this animal out of its misery.<eos> What's wrong with it?<eos> Wandered off where it wasn't supposed to be.
Remarkable creatures.<eos> Anywhere else on the planet, this species lives a dozen years, at most.<eos> Here, in our aquifer... they can live 300.<eos> For the human physiology... the effect of the water can be quite toxic as you have discovered.<eos> Unless, of course, it is properly filtered.
What's he talking about?<eos> I'm talking about Mount Weather.<eos> The medical facility in that mountain is state-of-the-art.<eos> They relied on blood to survive.<eos> It's still all there.
I know you had nothing to do with Mount Weather.<eos> That's why I didn't tell Lexa you gave me the knife.<eos> This is what your mother wanted all along.<eos> What do you want?<eos> Spit it out.
Kill her.<eos> Take her power.<eos> Damn it.<eos> What happened to that Raven Reyes confidence?<eos> It's a 12-digit code.
The people there are not a threat. We need that land.<eos> With the loss of Mount Weather's resources, Arkadia will be starving in less than a year.<eos> With all due respect, sir, you still haven't answered Monty's question.<eos> You know the answer.<eos> Every field must be cleared of stones before it's tilled.
Let me ask you this.<eos> Do you honestly believe that there are enough smart people on these 13 stations to save us, that their calculations are right, that there is enough air to last two centuries, enough food?<eos> A.L.I.E. 2 will run all the possibilities.<eos> She'll see the mistakes before we ever make them.<eos> It will know our wants and needs because they're its wants and needs.
This was my last assignment.<eos> I promise, Ylva.<eos> You said you were going to finish the house, and the storehouse should be done.<eos> I know.<eos> It will be completed.
We recorded our last set. We killed.<eos> It's...<eos> I left my phone in the van. Let's go get it.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Where is it going?
What do you got there, man?<eos> Like, how did you...<eos> You can't just leave it on the desk.<eos> - Oh, my God! - Yeah!<eos> How do you not have it password protected?
- Who?<eos> - Gus.<eos> Gus, that little bassist?<eos> We went on a date last night to a magic show.<eos> It was fun, but I think I might have fucked it up.
Gus the tutor.<eos> - What?<eos> - Okay, here's what happened.<eos> He wrote a spec script. He asked me to read it.<eos> It was awful.
Let's just hurry up and get that particle tracker so I can get the hell out of these go-go boots.<eos> Remember, when we meet my former self, it is imperative that we don't let on we're from the future, so let's just be cool.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> I'd forgotten how handsome I was.<eos> My hair, it's so thick and silky.
Yeah, well, my hieroglyphic is a little rusty.<eos> Lapidary hieratic, actually.<eos> An ancient language lost to the ages.<eos> Don't you know how to read it?<eos> It was a language known only to the clergy.
Who's that guy?<eos> Uh, Mr. Smitrovich takes pictures for our newsletter.<eos> Our understanding of the true workings of history gives us access to the levers of power.<eos> Your studio, for instance, is a pure instrument of capitalism.<eos> As such, it expresses the contradictions of capitalism and can be enlisted to finance its own destruction.
Tell me the second they call back.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> What's going on there, Mr. Mannix?<eos> Looks like you're expecting rain.<eos> No, it's nothing.
I'm not saying only writers are being exploited.<eos> I mean, look at yourself, Baird.<eos> The studio takes pretty good care of me.<eos> What are you, a child?<eos> I think what Herschel's trying to say is, just because the studio owns the means of production, why should it be able to take the money, our money, the value created by our labor, and dole out what it pleases?
Since you're going to your car, I thought you might wanna take this.<eos> What is it?<eos> From DeeAnna Moran.<eos> Thank you, and she doesn't need to adopt her baby after all.<eos> She asked Joe Silverman out for dinner last night, and I guess it went well.
You can't be filming Lucy when she's in fucking bed and stuff! (Dishes crashing)<eos> Get the fucking... away from me.<eos> Okay, boys, brand new formula.<eos> You're going to fucking love it.<eos> Take lots of notes, all right? How fast it kicks in, how strong it is, how long it lasts, everything.
Jesus, fuck my ass!<eos> Shut off the fucking camera!<eos> What the fuck is taking so long?<eos> Julian: It took us a while to find the fucking thing.<eos> It was hidden behind this.
Come on, man, you did good in here.<eos> You like the way I bust in the door? Wasn't it gangster?<eos> Reed.<eos> How was your date last night?<eos> It wasn't a date, grandpa.
Not again.<eos> Mr. Zogu, Alex.<eos> We've been working on a pretrial motion for almost a year now, while...<eos> We've been working on a pretrial motion for almost a year now, while you've been out on bail and the U.S. Attorney is finally making us an offer.<eos> To be quite honest, it looks pretty fair.
Yeah, sure I have.<eos> Yeah.<eos> So, what they did, they built a big wooden horse...<eos> They built a big wooden horse and placed it outside the walls to the city.<eos> It seemed like a magnificent present.
It was a treatment that used an MRI machine to target the bad cells and not kill the good ones.<eos> I had no idea they had gotten that far.<eos> Well, they were conducting some secret, non-FDA approved clinical trials.<eos> Butch and some other guys were the guinea pigs.<eos> - And it was working?
- Money makes people crazy, Charlie.<eos> - I know. I know.<eos> Did you bring the tablet?<eos> Of course, of course.<eos> It's right here.
- Exactly.<eos> Who buys cocaine?<eos> - Cokeheads, mostly.<eos> - People who can afford it.<eos> It's a luxury drug.
And they'd sum up what it was about And all they'd learned. And--so they could move on to next week's show<eos> With no baggage.<eos> - So? - Well, life just ain't like that.<eos> - No.<eos> No, it ain't.
MAN: Under the beds!<eos> NELLY: You've no right.<eos> COLEMAN: Where are they, Mrs Cosgrave?<eos> NELLY: They're out I told you.<eos> It's empty.
Withdraw your statement, Coleman.<eos> It's a pack of lies anyway, say you were mistaken.<eos> Is this the money your father reported stolen?<eos> That was taken by a slavey, my mother ill-advisedly took on. This money's mine.<eos> Now it's yours.
(SCOFFS) Whose law?<eos> British law.<eos> Exactly.<eos> Law only functions when society believes in it.<eos> I have to go back to where it holds more sway, where I'm not seen as some foreigner in my own country.
That's my favorite. Soon as I get it, you will.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - Yes? This thing at the bottom right here. You're talking about the drink, right?<eos> I am, but...<eos> It's not medical.
Is this 'cause I tried to get you that stuff?<eos> Yeah.<eos> And you remind me of someone I used to know.<eos> Well...<eos> I hope it tastes better than it looks.
Come in, let's chat.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I came to this place once before, when it was a museum, this, um, Chamber of Commerce thing.<eos> Love that painting.<eos> I never figured it'd be mine, here it is.
You give us supplies, we'll save Craig and take care of Negan and the Saviors, permanently.<eos> I'm sorry, I find this whole conversation pretty funny.<eos> I mean, you balked when I proposed that your people work for our supplies, but now... isn't that exactly what's happening here?<eos> See, I had leverage and I used it.<eos> It wasn't personal.
Maybe a weapons locker, an armory.<eos> Okay.<eos> We get in there, secure the armory, that's how we end it.<eos> That's how Carol ended it here.<eos> But we don't know if they have an armory or where it even is.
To us?<eos> They didn't do anything.<eos> So, if you didn't already have plans, I was thinking of making my beef jerky stroganoff.<eos> I'm good, thanks.<eos> It's not exactly a nice porterhouse, but I promise it's better than it sounds.
What I believe...<eos> I'm not right.<eos> There is no right.<eos> There's just the wrong that doesn't pull you down.<eos> It hasn't pulled me down.
I'm not right.<eos> There is no right.<eos> There's just the wrong that doesn't pull you down.<eos> It hasn't pulled me down.<eos> I think it will.
Dead.<eos> I'm gonna find them, and we're gonna string them up-- alright, I hear ya.<eos> I hear ya. That's why I avoid the political stuff.<eos> Not my thing.<eos> Besides, I've heard it can be dangerous.
All the lies that the zionists tell about Nazi Germany, that's what's actually happening right now!<eos> The irony of it!<eos> That's why we gotta be smart.<eos> That's why the event has to force the zog to show its hand.<eos> It's gotta reveal the men behind the curtain.
I was exhausted.<eos> Don't worry about it.<eos> That's what this job does to you. Keep at it another ten years and you'll turn into a real asshole...<eos> like me.<eos> It's totally secure.
Smells about right.<eos> Okay, let's test it.<eos> Test it?<eos> You got a mass spectrometer in your bag?<eos> No, we'll just see if it burns.
I was skeptical but the proof is in the pudding, and here I sit before you... resplendently who I am,<eos> entirely because of her ministrations.<eos> I beg you to see her.<eos> Life, for all its anguish, is ours, Miss Ives.<eos> It belongs to no other.
Beautiful painting.<eos> Is this her only piece in the collection?<eos> Maria Kreyn?<eos> I saw her solo show in Oslo.<eos> There is another piece, but it arrived too late for the opening.
I saw her solo show in Oslo.<eos> There is another piece, but it arrived too late for the opening.<eos> A recent work?<eos> On loan from a private collection.<eos> I think it's my favorite of hers.
Bartender.<eos> Which is proof that I am terrible at weddings.<eos> I don't know. Sounds like you had more fun at my wedding than I did.<eos> And if you really hated weddings... you would have never bought yourself this dress.<eos> It is a good dress.
What?<eos> Well, I've been wondering what to get you for a wedding present.<eos> Oh, come on.<eos> It's a museum piece.<eos> It's worth a fortune.
Oh, come on.<eos> It's a museum piece.<eos> It's worth a fortune.<eos> Even you can't afford it.<eos> You really like it?
You lied!<eos> No. No.<eos> Please don't.<eos> The EMP will give me brain damage.<eos> You know it will.
You know it will.<eos> Please don't do this.<eos> - Don't listen to her.<eos> - Please.<eos> You know it will.
You know I'll help in any way I can.<eos> Yes, thank you, Henry.<eos> Now, you were intending to take me to your lab.<eos> Oh, yes, my lab.<eos> It's right over there.
She'll bring those Shadowhunters with her.<eos> They won't get past the front door.<eos> Even if they do, we've got them vastly outnumbered.<eos> Have you ever tasted Shadowhunter blood?<eos> It's heavenly.
If the Lieutenant were here, she would say something... tough yet encouraging, of which I would wholeheartedly concur.<eos> She is very good at that.<eos> I get why you want to find her so badly.<eos> That thing wasn't human.<eos> And it wanted to kill us.
If desperation truly is the onryo's lure, it would surely head to more populated areas.<eos> This road is the opposite direction.<eos> Next closest exit is West Point.<eos> This... this thing feeds on desperation, right?<eos> Could it be tracking not just people who are desperate, but people who are desperate to find Abbie?
This... this thing feeds on desperation, right?<eos> Could it be tracking not just people who are desperate, but people who are desperate to find Abbie?<eos> Its focus could be that specific.<eos> Why?<eos> I think I know where it's headed.
Its focus could be that specific.<eos> Why?<eos> I think I know where it's headed.<eos> There's only one person who is as desperate to find out what happened to Abbie Mills as you.<eos> It's going after Daniel Reynolds.
Ward's dead.<eos> And here we are, chasing a man who may be the last head of Hydra, and our orders are to surveil him?<eos> Why?<eos> So he can come back to haunt us later?<eos> There's a pattern emerging, and it always ends badly.
Safe for now.<eos> Don't panic, sir, but your life is in --<eos> For Mother Russia!<eos> As I was saying, don't panic, sir, but your life is in danger.<eos> But if it can go solid, then we should be able to fight it.
How'd you do that?<eos> Did you see that?<eos> How the hell are we supposed to --<eos> Daisy!<eos> Whatever this thing is, it's here.
I was just deciding that now, actually.<eos> Something dark, I hope.<eos> Well, it's between black and ivory, and to tell you the truth, this ivory is so beautiful...<eos> Oh, for God's sakes, don't wear ivory.<eos> Even with your figure, it'll accentuate all the wrong places.
-The anger, it's biblical.<eos> -Uh, gas prices?<eos> -Yeah, gas is school.<eos> Gas is work. Gas is the family trip to Disneyland.<eos> Every cent it goes up is another six points on the anger index.
Well, because we were spending everything we had on the race.<eos> I remember I used to think this place was a palace, though.<eos> -It was.<eos> -Not compared to the ranch.<eos> Well, it was a palace because it was ours.
Meechum, I need you to do me a favor.<eos> There are no clues at the moment as to who may be responsible, but Gaffney PD is taking the canvas picture down<eos> - within the hour for further examination.<eos> On primary day.<eos> I can't verify anything yet in terms of who it is, or even whether it's real, or--
All right.<eos> Bring the box back here.<eos> Don't let it out of your sight.<eos> As far as I know, there's only one photograph.<eos> Meechum says it's still at the bank.
It causes implosions. Mm.<eos> That's weird. Weird how?<eos> That they got their hands on it?<eos> Nitramene isn't stable enough to be used in a gel-based explosive.<eos> Or at least it shouldn't be.
I'm gonna go call Coulson.<eos> Do we take this debris back with us, study it?<eos> Uh, yeah, sure.<eos> If... if you've been working out.<eos> 'Cause it weighs like 100,000 tons.
What's that... what's the stuff called?<eos> - Sodium what?<eos> - Sodium hydrogen acetate.<eos> What?<eos> I don't think it's working.
Problem is, that's just one cell.<eos> This is nationwide.<eos> Tell me something.<eos> How'd you get that ATCU target?<eos> Was it fed to you?
Sir?<eos> That's an order.<eos> Sir, there's got to be another way. Uh-oh, Coulson.<eos> Seems your puppy doesn't have his teeth yet.<eos> Lincoln, sometimes we do the wrong thing for the right reason because it has to be done.
Well, whatever you do I am never going to apologize to Mrs. Lynde.<eos> Never!<eos> Then I think what you should do is just stay right here until you reconsider.<eos> Anne? I have your breakfast.<eos> It's out here when you want it.
And in the meantime, could you chose one of these for church?<eos> Marilla?<eos> I chose this outfit for church today.<eos> That's good.<eos> It's plain and simple.
And if they don't pay, then we seize their property.<eos> And if they resist... Well, let's not kid ourselves. Enforcement is always at the end of a gun.<eos> Mr. Endler, you are out of order. I charge you with contempt!<eos> I accept the charge, because I have nothing but contempt for these proceedings.<eos> If we're going to insist that a Christian's right to believe is subordinate to all other rights, then it's not a right.
You're exiting the tracheal artery.<eos> You should see the first fragment.<eos> No sign of it.<eos> Did I miss it?<eos> It's the size of an iceberg.
There's a gathering tonight in celebration of it.<eos> And clearly you want us to go so we can get ourselves killed.<eos> - Clearly.<eos> - What is the vessel?<eos> It's the remains of Prince Khufu of the Middle Kingdom.
Focus, Raymond.<eos> Remember, you can do this.<eos> It's not the suit, it's you that Kendra needs right now.<eos> Well done, just one more fragment to go.<eos> It's the biggest one yet.
Oh, yes.<eos> On that score, I cannot disagree.<eos> What're you planning on doing with Carter's body?<eos> Oh, you'll see.<eos> Mr. Blake informs us that you were hoping to steal our master's fortune, but while money has its uses, it is not the source of his power.
Indians travel with the livestock.<eos> That's the goddamn law here, friend.<eos> Before you speak another word... I ask you to consider this...<eos> How valuable is your life?<eos> Do you hold it dear?
That's my job, right?<eos> Yeah. For tonight it is.<eos> I feel for you guys.<eos> I do. I saw you got a care package from your mom.<eos> Did you open it? Mnh, I did.
- You know, wearing a head scarf doesn't actually make you a terrorist.<eos> But wearing pigtails at your age - does make you retarded.<eos> - That's true.<eos> Can we not use that word this season.<eos> - It's a micro-aggression.
Oh, I want a network.<eos> It's just... I might want you, too.<eos> How do you feel about the Bahamas?<eos> Let me guess. You own a hotel.<eos> Actually, it's an Eco-resort on its very own archipelago.
- Cameras off! Come on, now!<eos> - What do you mean "no"?<eos> You and me, we need to have a different kind of conversation right about now.<eos> - Not right now, Daddy.<eos> - You're carrying my baby. - You don't know that. - You're saying it's not mine?
You and me, we need to have a different kind of conversation right about now.<eos> - Not right now, Daddy.<eos> - You're carrying my baby. - You don't know that. - You're saying it's not mine?<eos> I'm saying that I don't know whose baby it is.<eos> Beth Ann, whose baby could it be?
You two can split it. So that's it, huh?<eos> This is just what we do at the end of every season now, just humiliate the suitor?<eos> Now, that is a show that I would watch.<eos> Can't you see how unfair this is to Darius, Quinn? After everything we put him through, he deserves an ending.<eos> This is an ending... just not a happy one, but it's about as real as it gets.
-Are you serious?<eos> -I'm serious.<eos> Let me just be the first to apologize.<eos> But, look, I did find this dress.<eos> You know, it could be great. White looks amazing on you -- pop at sunset.
We think Ward's body was possessed, for lack of a better word, by it, the creature...<eos> And he burned them or something?<eos> Honestly, right now-- We have no idea.<eos> When I was there, it knew everything that will did, even after he was... gone.<eos> Which means whatever this thing is has Ward's memories, so why hasn't it come after us? Maybe it's not interested in us.
When I was there, it knew everything that will did, even after he was... gone.<eos> Which means whatever this thing is has Ward's memories, so why hasn't it come after us? Maybe it's not interested in us.<eos> Can't believe I'm hearing this.<eos> Well, we know it destroyed an entire civilization over there.<eos> Who knows what it has planned here?
Don't worry, Jefferson, we are moving far too fast for anyone to track us.<eos> I'm afraid that's not true.<eos> Someone is tracking us.<eos> I thought this ship was cloaked.<eos> It is.
Chronos.<eos> I suggest you all strap yourselves in.<eos> It's going to be a bit of a bumpy landing.<eos> Initiating emergency landing protocol.<eos> How's it going, Gideon?
What a colorful team you've assembled for yourself.<eos> I thought that you were...<eos> Chronos?<eos> He was killed in the crash, I'm afraid.<eos> I was sent to scuttle his time ship, lest it be discovered by the Soviets.
He's not a god.<eos> As far as we know, he was a slave to the Kree.<eos> What better beginning for a god?<eos> They called him "Alveus." Do you know that word?<eos> It's Latin.
As far as we know, he was a slave to the Kree.<eos> What better beginning for a god?<eos> They called him "Alveus." Do you know that word?<eos> It's Latin.<eos> It means "Hive,"
Who needs space?<eos> Because I've got something magnificent right here.<eos> A picture of space.<eos> One of my prized possessions, that is.<eos> - I don't know why it makes any significance to
Tell me how to stabilize Firestorm.<eos> If Einstein had the opportunity, he would have traveled back in time to prevent the creation of the atomic bomb.<eos> How can I in good conscience lead the world to the invention of something far more destructive?<eos> You don't really have a choice.<eos> This toxin, it's not lethal, but it will make you wish that it were.
We're in the Temporal Zone.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> No one should be able to...<eos> You were saying?<eos> A scan of the vessel suggests that it is the bounty hunter Chronos.
I built this.<eos> The owner had a dream.<eos> After that, he built this building.<eos> A building to be used for prayer.<eos> It looks like a chicken?
So, look at the... powder.<eos> It blows in the wind, it's very fine grain, it's all floodplain, it's all silt.<eos> But it all started as volcanic rock from the highlands, from the rift margin, ground up over millions of years, distributed out here, and redistributed by the Awash River.<eos> If you die today, your body will decompose on the floodplain.<eos> If the hyenas don't chew all the bones up, the next time the river floods, this soft, silty material will be carried in, and it will encase your bones.
- Moya means, in Afarinia, "head. "<eos> Got the moya.<eos> We got a moya!<eos> The extraction begins.<eos> This fragment is of particular importance, as it is part of the cranium.
The extraction begins.<eos> This fragment is of particular importance, as it is part of the cranium.<eos> Time for a Shakespearean moment, perhaps, to soliloquize on... my deep ancestry.<eos> I can see the curvature.<eos> It's the biggest piece we have so far.
And from the bases of these cones, lava gushed out at a phenomenal rate.<eos> This is very, very hot lava, very, very fluid, and it poured down the valleys, filling them to depths of 100, 150 meters.<eos> These primordial occurrences influenced the sense of mythical poetry of the Icelanders.<eos> There is a text that defines the spirit of the people.<eos> It exists only in a single manuscript.
The codex was given as a present to the king of Denmark by an Icelandic bishop in the 17th century.<eos> The Royal Codex, or Codex Regius.<eos> In 1971, Denmark returned it to Iceland.<eos> Knowing that it constituted the soul of the country, the codex was put on Denmark's largest battleship and escorted by a whole fleet.<eos> No amount of money in the world would be enough to purchase this manuscript from Iceland, although it is battered and crumpled and filled with holes.
A unique opportunity presented itself to us.<eos> The near-impervious country opened its doors to a joint scientific program between the University of Cambridge and North Korean volcanologists.<eos> And so we were invited to film there.<eos> But everything we saw was an act of presentation, and we went for it.<eos> There is no other way to see this enigmatic country other than how it wants to present itself.
That is why the guerrilla soldiers, collected their pad wads from their own padded clothes, and then made that blanket for our dear Kim Jong-il.<eos> The birthplace of the socialist revolution manifests itself in collective formations of the North Koreans.<eos> In the country's biggest stadium, more than 100,000 people participate in creating a unique art form.<eos> The picture of the hut in the snow is not a painting.<eos> It is made of human pixels.
Yeah. They're famous photos.<eos> We know them.<eos> About this monument, it dates back to what time, roughly?<eos> It dates back to the early 20th century.<eos> It was erected by the heavenly people living around this area.
Excuse me.<eos> Okay, ladies. Let's say grace.<eos> Bow your heads.<eos> Dear Lord, thank you for this meal.<eos> We ask that you bless this food so that it may bless our bodies.
For you it is.<eos> Euler's method.<eos> Yes.<eos> But that's ancient.<eos> But it works.
Euler's method.<eos> Yes.<eos> But that's ancient.<eos> But it works.<eos> It works numerically.
Oh, God. I'm licking your neck.<eos> Kissing your ears.<eos> My hand is on that big mountain in your pants, and I am unzipping you right now.<eos> And I'm pulling your shirt off real slow.<eos> No, no, no, it's a button-up.
My hand is on that big mountain in your pants, and I am unzipping you right now.<eos> And I'm pulling your shirt off real slow.<eos> No, no, no, it's a button-up.<eos> -I unbutton it real slow.<eos> -No, no, no, tear it off.
-I unbutton it real slow.<eos> -No, no, no, tear it off.<eos> -Pulling it off. It's off.<eos> -Tear it off.<eos> It's off, the buttons, they're everywhere. They're everywhere.
We're... we're Geronimo.<eos> Bram.<eos> It's weird.<eos> I just found this place last week.<eos> It's some kind of food distribution center.
How's that?<eos> Somebody's always one step ahead of us.<eos> There's only one way that can happen: if we've got a leak.<eos> You think I'm the leak.<eos> I'm pretty sure it ain't Beau, and I'm sure as hell it ain't me.
I'll tell you what.<eos> You find me that lens, and you and I are gonna figure out what those RAPs are doing up there.<eos> You wanted to see me?<eos> You know how that thing works?<eos> It's a computer.
You find me that lens, and you and I are gonna figure out what those RAPs are doing up there.<eos> You wanted to see me?<eos> You know how that thing works?<eos> It's a computer.<eos> It's software with a keyboard terminal.
I am nothing.<eos> I am no more than a blade of grass.<eos> But I am.<eos> You think you know evil?<eos> Here it stands.
I ain't telling anybody about it either. Edge of nowhere.<eos> And that's smart.<eos> Off the radar.<eos> How's the hunting'?<eos> It's good.
CARNY OWNER:<eos> Ah, there you are.<eos> So, had enough time to look over the property?<eos> It's what you're looking for?<eos> Well, it's garish, ugly and smells like piss.
Desmodus rotundus.<eos> It feeds entirely off the blood of other living animals.<eos> So, of course, I believe what you said because I know such monsters exist.<eos> There are creatures whom God has cast into darkness and cursed to the night.<eos> This animal feeds off blood because it must.

They need us!<eos> Alex, you know we're having trouble locating your parents.<eos> And since you can't remember anything, we have a method, an unusual method that might help you remember.<eos> But I need you to be okay with it.<eos> I also need you to know that it's probably gonna hurt.
And I'm reading and... it starts explaining my life to me.<eos> "The Ladder," folks.<eos> First book of Meyerism.<eos> Everything... from the suffering... to the emptiness.<eos> It got me.
Eat, sleep, rave, repeat. Eat, sleep, rave, repeat! Eat, sleep, rave, repeat!<eos> - Your soul mate?<eos> - I just have a feeling, you know?<eos> He sent me this song and it was like he knew me.<eos> Like, he knew it would be the perfect song to send me.
I'm the one who pays you.<eos> I don't want to do this forever.<eos> This restaurant that I struggled to build is not good enough for you?<eos> No, dad. No.<eos> It's not that it's not good enough.
You want him to go out there and faint? Is that what you want?<eos> I can't do it.<eos> What?<eos> I really appreciate the offer.<eos> It's the most amazing opportunity I've had in my life, and maybe the most amazing one i ever will have, but I just think my priorities are a little bit... slow down for a second, kid.
Ten months.<eos> - What did you do for sustenance?<eos> - Strange.<eos> It's like I don't need to eat, drink or sleep.<eos> Problem isn't hunger. It's monotony.
I thirst, Pandora.<eos> I hunger.<eos> It causes me pain.<eos> The beacon is too slow, too weak.<eos> It needs to be bolstered, charged.
With what? You're alone in the Archives, literally doing nothing.<eos> Yes, I can understand why you would think that, but I...<eos> Zoe, I am, uh...<eos> It's very difficult to explain.<eos> Can you just tell me what it is?
We got lucky.<eos> It was a place he used to patron back in your day, but it was called something else then.<eos> The Ridotto Theatre.<eos> Yes, I know it well. Wait. So you know the insignia?<eos> It's on a weird door?
Especially when it comes to you.<eos> He thinks I need protecting.<eos> A shame he doesn't know how strong you are, Skye.<eos> But your home is with me now. It's -<eos> - It's actually Daisy.
- It's a prosthetic.<eos> Well, you certainly weren't afraid you were wrong.<eos> What tipped it?<eos> That your eye's not entirely human. What?<eos> Mammals don't have ciliary muscles in their vascular layer, but that eye does, so what is it?
In the future, my friends may not be heroes, but if we succeed, they will be remembered as legends.<eos> Previously on "Legends of Tomorrow"...<eos> We're in the Temporal Zone. I don't understand.<eos> No one should be able to...<eos> A scan of the vessel suggests that it is the bounty hunter, Kronos.
The car is my sister's.<eos> She lent it to me, and I'm not sure where...<eos> Don't worry...<eos> I'll get mine.<eos> Yeah, it's the starter.
My husband would like to, well, I... work too much and not...<eos> I don't know very well. Oh, well, don't be dismayed.<eos> I had Dani, well, Daniel, he does not like me to call him Dani, was I was almost 40.<eos> A child changes your life.<eos> But it also gives you everything.
And the Garridos suspect that you and your lover are the culprits.<eos> Because she's now dead, the only one that remains... is you.<eos> What does this puzzle suggests?<eos> What does it suggests to you?<eos> It makes me think of the hotel room mystery.
That day she was off work, I just told you.<eos> They went to the hotel because they had arranged a meeting with Laura.<eos> - I tell you that this photo shows...<eos> - This picture is fake, Mr. Doria!<eos> And it's rigged. It's a composite.
The prosecution has no witnesses.<eos> It was all my invention, which I shaped, gradually, with the details you gave me.<eos> - I tell her that this photo shows...<eos> - This picture's fake, Mr. Doria!<eos> And it's faked. It's a composite.
Previously on Teen Wolf...<eos> - What are they?<eos> - Dread Doctors.<eos> There's a dead girl.<eos> You know it wasn't Kira.
What about his heart?<eos> I heard it jump, but only once, and only for a second.<eos> That doesn't mean he was lying.<eos> Not really.<eos> The rest of the time it was steady. When did it jump?
The symbol of an Alpha and his pack.<eos> Whose pack?<eos> Scott's.<eos> It was more than a symbol, wasn't it?<eos> It was a promise to reunite them.
But isn't it just a teenager like us?<eos> Isn't it just a kid underneath?<eos> They don't care about that.<eos> The Doctors, they needed a body because they couldn't resurrect the Beast out of thin air.<eos> That kid underneath, whoever it is, just a side effect.
That kid underneath, whoever it is, just a side effect.<eos> All the Doctors care about is the Beast.<eos> So what happens if it does remember?<eos> I'm not sure.<eos> The thing probably doesn't even know it turns back to human during the day.
They found it.<eos> They were looking for Noah, but they found a symbol.<eos> A circle inside of another circle, carved into a wall.<eos> The symbol of Scott's pack.<eos> It was more than a symbol, wasn't it?
Are you saying that thing's going to be out there tonight?<eos> I'm saying... People are going to die.<eos> A lot of people.<eos> Mason said it's not just to transmit frequency.<eos> It's high powered.
It's high powered.<eos> Like an ***<eos> And that's causing it to shift?<eos> No. I don't think it's just that.<eos> Last night Argent said that it's getting smarter.
Basically, it was all we were able to get considering all the fire, blood and carnage.<eos> How many size 10s are out there?<eos> Only one with Parrish's blood on the sole.<eos> So are we going to try to get the game canceled?<eos> No, no, we're going to play, but we're just going to hope really hard that it doesn't turn into a blood-soaked massacre.
Aren't we kind of missing out on a chance to catch this thing?<eos> We don't have the "who," but we have the "where" and the "when."<eos> There's too many people.<eos> And we still don't actually know if it's going to happen.<eos> It just might end up being a regular lacrosse game.

Lydia.<eos> Stiles, I'm... I'm not so sure I actually have that authority.<eos> You're the County Sheriff.<eos> You can't cancel a high school lacrosse game?<eos> It's a charity game which generates tens of thousands of dollars.
Two traits too often found in the same mind.<eos> The man who created the first was known only as "The Surgeon."<eos> Using practices in the farthest edges of pseudo-science, he harnessed electromagnetic fields in the masks... infusing them with a unique and deadly power.<eos> I'm not putting this thing on.<eos> You want to know who it is?
