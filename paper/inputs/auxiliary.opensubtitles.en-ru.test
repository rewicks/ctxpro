Your friend.<eos> What's that supposed to mean?<eos> Batou.<eos> Can you hear me?<eos> Who did this stunning work on you?
Copy that, sir.<eos> I know where to find her.<eos> I didn't ask you to come here.<eos> You never ask.<eos> But I always do.
It feels real.<eos> Why didn't you stop him?<eos> I dunno who to trust anymore.<eos> You trust me, right?<eos> Yeah, I do.
We need someone who can move like them, fight like them.<eos> We need someone who can walk into a tornado, and come out the other side like it was a damn gentle breeze.<eos> You know someone like that?<eos> No.<eos> But Gibbons did.
And possibly my fur coat.<eos> I'd forgotten how beautiful the view is up here.<eos> Oh, I, uh, see you found your coat.<eos> Well, you promised to take care of it for me.<eos> And I did.
Don't deny it, you shit.<eos> It's hard to put down a good book.<eos> Yes.<eos> Who doesn't love to read books?<eos> I do, as a normal person.
It means you get mad.<eos> You do something big and you can't take it back and it's too late, and then...<eos> Crazy.<eos> I do that?<eos> I do that?
I know how hard that can be, okay?<eos> A long time ago, he broke up with me to go out with you, so I get it.<eos> But you have to stop now.<eos> I fit into this family.<eos> You never did.
Right.<eos> Yeah, well, uh...<eos> Roger got me a job in his office when he worked for the Ford Motor Company.<eos> I'm quite good with numbers, so I worked out a way to steal $125,000.<eos> So I did.
Yeah, well, uh...<eos> Roger got me a job in his office when he worked for the Ford Motor Company.<eos> I'm quite good with numbers, so I worked out a way to steal $125,000.<eos> So I did.<eos> What did you do with it?
I hope you all got to dance to your heart's content.<eos> Do you still have the golden bird?<eos> Oh, Nanny Jo.<eos> You don't even remember it, do you?<eos> No, of course I do.
You know what they say? Showing up is 90% of love.<eos> Yeah, and not being an asshole is the other 10%.<eos> He didn't show up.<eos> No, you didn't.<eos> Neither did I.
I'm Matt Brody.<eos> Ready for duty.<eos> "Ready for duty"?<eos> Okay. You got any papers or anything like that?<eos> I do.
We gotta move without him.<eos> Yeah, but we need our lookout.<eos> What's your deal? You like torturing guys?<eos> - No.<eos> - Yeah, you do.
Shut your mouth.<eos> - What is it?<eos> - It's all right.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> - It did it again.
The Councilman's boating accident was no accident at all.<eos> He had no smoke in his lungs, his neck was broken in multiple places.<eos> Which means he was probably dead before that boat even caught on fire.<eos> And our investigation has found that all of this shady shit leads right back to the Huntley.<eos> You don't do investigations.
- Yeah.<eos> Plus I'm high as a motherfucker right now on Devil's Urchin.<eos> You stabbed yourself with one of those?<eos> I thought that was supposed to kill you.<eos> It does.
It changes the situation.<eos> It may indicate a far more serious condition.<eos> You don't believe in such voices?<eos> No.<eos> No, signore, I do not.
I want to know...<eos> Why do you think that I'm a good person?<eos> Do you remember when you were a little girl, you used to take turns riding all of the horses in the stable so that none of them would feel left out?<eos> Do you remember that?<eos> I do. Mm-hmm.
We like our stories to end with the promise of hope.<eos> Happily ever after and all that.<eos> Is that as clear as it gets?<eos> Too bad real lives don't have that structure.<eos> Or, hell, maybe they do.
We know their transportation routes.<eos> Oof! Now we're warming' up.<eos> Come on, ideas.<eos> Burn his favorite palace down.<eos> How you gonna do that, then?
There is someone, but... I'm not really sure what's gonna happen.<eos> Oh!<eos> Okay-<eos> But does he play out, like, make money playing and stuff'?<eos> - He does'?
Does Dad even look at you?<eos> He's so... strange.<eos> We've... waited so long to be free of that man, and now...<eos> Do you think about forgiving him?<eos> No, I don't.
We've... waited so long to be free of that man, and now...<eos> Do you think about forgiving him?<eos> No, I don't.<eos> - You pray for him?<eos> - No, I don't.
You gotta do it.<eos> Why are you crying?<eos> Because I'm happy.<eos> Your old girlfriend... she asked you to go off with her.<eos> Why didn't you?
Devil.<eos> I need to talk to you.<eos> I know.<eos> I love him.<eos> Of course you do.
We don't have to have any secrets between us.<eos> Why is he after you if he's not attracted to you?<eos> Did you ever sleep with him?<eos> Yes.<eos> You did?
The word embarrassed me.<eos> I've always been afraid to be myself.<eos> I thought there was no one there.<eos> I don't believe anything that you're saying.<eos> Yes, you do.
Now, she's using you.<eos> Look. Despite what you might think despite my my better judgment i care about you.<eos> Somewhere in there, fighting to get out is a good man.<eos> You don't know that.<eos> I do.
Look at you.<eos> You're so different.<eos> I mean, sorry, but it's true.<eos> Do you know how to start a fire with just rope and a stick?<eos> I do.
I want so much more Than they've got planned<eos> The woods are lovely.<eos> I only wish I recognized them.<eos> Do you know where we are, Philippe?<eos> Because I don't.
It's-it's fine.<eos> It just slipped a little bit.<eos> Uh, no, I think we want to come back up now.<eos> No, no, no, no.<eos> We don't.
Hey!<eos> I asked you a question.<eos> Who are you?<eos> You know who she is, Logan.<eos> No, I don't.
Hey, look at 'em.<eos> Look like dinosaurs with their 20-ton bodies and tiny little brains... shucking their cloned-up super corn.<eos> You know it tastes like shit, too.<eos> Why do people eat it?<eos> They don't.
Someone's going down for this.<eos> I'm firing one of you two today.<eos> Tell you what, how about we'll go one better.<eos> How about I fire you both?<eos> He did it.
I'm firing one of you two today.<eos> Tell you what, how about we'll go one better.<eos> How about I fire you both?<eos> He did it.<eos> You did it.
How about I fire you both?<eos> He did it.<eos> You did it.<eos> I mean, you did do it, so...<eos> He did it.
I just knew it.<eos> - Wait, I'm sorry, what do you mean, you knew I wouldn't stand up to them?<eos> That came out wrong.<eos> What I'm saying is that, you know, sometimes, you just let people push you around.<eos> - I do?
Campbell, you have to train a dog to smell specific drugs, okay?<eos> How do you think this thing works?<eos> I don't know how it works.<eos> I thought you guys knew how it worked.<eos> We do.
And I want you to believe me right now.<eos> I want you to believe me when I tell you everything's gonna be okay.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> - I believe you.<eos> - You do?
That's not technically a song.<eos> That's kinda like a rap.<eos> It still sound good, don't it?<eos> It did!<eos> It did.
Thank you for letting me stay.<eos> I didn't mean for this to happen.<eos> It's just hard sometimes.<eos> I get it.<eos> No, you don't.
I couldn't keep up with your knots.<eos> She thinks that's because of me?<eos> Why are you doing this?<eos> - I don't know what you mean.<eos> - Yes, you do.
Perfect opportunity, and look at that one - she's smiling.<eos> Oh, Inspector, this is clearly a waste of time.<eos> And if there's nothing...<eos> I know what happened to your son.<eos> You do?
I will destroy you.<eos> You're completely at my mercy.<eos> Mr Baker.<eos> Well, that completes the set.<eos> No, it does not.
Hey, Sherlock.<eos> Yes.<eos> I... so like you.<eos> Did I ever say?<eos> Yes, yes, you did.
And you are done with the world being explained to you by a man.<eos> Who isn't?<eos> So all he needed to do was find the first available lunchtime appointment with a female therapist within cycling distance of your surgery.<eos> -My God, he knows you.<eos> -No, he doesn't.
"I've confessed to my crimes.<eos> "Please forgive me."<eos> How would that have any effect?<eos> You don't know her.<eos> Oh, but I do.
I spent a whole evening with her.<eos> We had chips.<eos> I think she liked me.<eos> You don't know Faith.<eos> You simply do not.
(CHUCKLING) You maintain an impressive facade.<eos> I think it's about to break.<eos> Did you know?<eos> -She came to Baker Street.<eos> -No, she didn't.
It's okay.<eos> Let him do what he wants.<eos> He's entitled.<eos> I killed his wife.<eos> Yes, you did.
Okay. Though I should mention that it is possible for any given text alert<eos> -to become randomly attached to... -Happy birthday.<eos> Thank you, John, that's very kind of you.<eos> Never knew when your birthday was.<eos> Well, now you do.
This is insane.<eos> This is unnecessary.<eos> -No, your security is compromised, and we don't know who to trust.<eos> And that justifies dressing up?<eos> Yes, it does!
Did they tell you to keep three feet from the glass?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Be naughty, step closer.<eos> - Why?<eos> - Do it.
Of course you can.<eos> Why can't you?<eos> - You know why.<eos> - No, I don't know why.<eos> Of course you do.
If people knew where babies really came from, they'd never have one.<eos> Same thing with hot dogs, by the way.<eos> Going upsies!<eos> So how come I don't remember this place?<eos> You did.
My Dad says, "Those who can, do."<eos> "And those who can't, supervise."<eos> Your father is a hippy.<eos> What happens when you grow up?<eos> We don't.
It's a Ravager funeral.<eos> Yeah!<eos> Yeah!<eos> He didn't let us down after all, Captain.<eos> No, he did not, son.
Yeah!<eos> Yeah!<eos> He didn't let us down after all, Captain.<eos> No, he did not, son.<eos> He did not.
They're not gonna let us just walk.<eos> Are they?<eos> They're bound to be looking for us soon.<eos> You have something I want, Ray.<eos> Yes, I do.
You live in... town, don't you?<eos> Yes.<eos> You live by the school?<eos> How did you know that?<eos> I just do.
Come with me. Come on.<eos> Just a second.<eos> Dougie?<eos> Ma'am, do you know this man?<eos> Yes, of course I do.
The hell are you doing?<eos> Please, Chad, use another restroom.<eos> Clear this with the sheriff?<eos> I'll tell him if you don't.<eos> Yeah, you do that, Chad.
- We're fine, Batman.<eos> Listen, I just wanted to say that I'm really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really... s-s-s...<eos> Sorry?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Whoo! I did it!
Yes.<eos> When... when we were kids... we would eat them together.<eos> Nobody would know that but Danny.<eos> but a bunch of MM's doesn't prove anything.<eos> It does.
Dredged up so many old memories... these feelings that I've, I don't know, pushed down.<eos> Locked away.<eos> - That make any sense?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Yeah, it does.
What felt good was hurting those guys.<eos> Really good.<eos> Scared me.<eos> Yeah, well, the world hasn't exactly been kind to us.<eos> But maybe doing something like this...
Yeah, well, the world hasn't exactly been kind to us.<eos> But maybe doing something like this...<eos> Walk where I walk, and they'll never see us.<eos> Come here.<eos> Thanks for doing this.
He's...<eos> - Uh, indisposed.<eos> - Understood.<eos> And call me Wayne.<eos> Your father did.
Does that make you... uneasy?<eos> No.<eos> It does.<eos> I sense your fear.<eos> No, you don't.
Danny, we don't know what's causing it.<eos> The EPA cleared us.<eos> Fifteen cases of cancer can't be a coincidence.<eos> Do you think that I don't care about those people?<eos> I do.
Voted them all out.<eos> - Joy, Danny...<eos> - Danny?<eos> Uh... Do you know where Ward is?<eos> No, sir, I don't.
What are you talking about?<eos> Hey!<eos> - That's it.<eos> - It didn't work.<eos> Maybe it did.
Um, we need a moment.<eos> Can you make sure we aren't disturbed?<eos> You might wanna check the file I left on your desk.<eos> - I don't understand.<eos> - Oh, yes you do.
Just do it.<eos> Tell her that they're from me.<eos> Tell her that I'm thinking about her.<eos> - You can trust me.<eos> - I do.
- Gunshot.<eos> - Where?<eos> - In the penthouse.<eos> - How do you know that?<eos> - I just do.
I wish I could.<eos> Look, I've been down this road before.<eos> - I know what we're up against.<eos> - I know who you are.<eos> No, you don't.
- I know what we're up against.<eos> - I know who you are.<eos> No, you don't.<eos> Trust me.<eos> Yes, I do.
We can take care of this.<eos> "We"?<eos> There is no "we."<eos> Vigilantes don't have jurisdiction.<eos> The NYPD does.
And I'm not dumb enough to think I can try and stop you.<eos> I'm here because I'm trying to help you keep your two lives separate.<eos> So they don't lump you in with Mr. Bulletproof and Super Joan Jett in there.<eos> - You understand?<eos> - Yeah, I do.
Oh, I had to use the bathroom super bad. Oh.<eos> So, this is the hangout spot then, huh?<eos> Yeah, yeah, yeah, these are my friends.<eos> Oh, so that - must make you Prudence then.<eos> - Yes. - Uh-huh. Yes, it does.
Sì signora.<eos> John.<eos> Gianna.<eos> There was a time not so long ago in which I considered us as friends.<eos> I still do.
- ain't gonna last forever. - Okay.<eos> Yeah. Goddamn it, though, - he's really gonna bang her?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Did Mac put a camera in my mom's room?<eos> No, I did.
I decided to follow her this morning. Cassie never gets her tip, does she, Dee?<eos> No. Because I refuse to tip for coffee.<eos> - I think it's dumb.<eos> - Uh-huh. So if you were buying circus peanuts and candy sour worms and cigarettes, I think we all know what that means about the ticket in question, don't we?<eos> I don't.
It's not a trick. The soda gun is clogged, I cannot make drinks.<eos> I don't know.<eos> I don't trust Charlie today.<eos> You know, I made him a valentine... He hasn't given me shit yet in return.<eos> Why the hell did you do that?
Oh, why don't we just trick... Cricket doesn't work here though.<eos> - But that's free labor.<eos> - Yeah, yeah. - That's kind of better.<eos> You're not... you're not getting... Hey, just do your jobs!<eos> Just do your jobs.
- Like...<eos> - Unless... Oh, my God.<eos> What?<eos> Charlie, he doesn't want us to work at all.<eos> - He doesn't?
I mean, what is that?<eos> Unless...<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Dennis doesn't want us to work the bar.<eos> - He doesn't?
No, no, no, nobody's been poisoned. - They're just...<eos> - Plenty more poison where that came from! - Uh, there is no...<eos> - So, don't even think about trying to get another worm, Frank. And there are no-no worms.<eos> - Nobody has worms.<eos> - Well, not anymore they don't.
My birth mother died when I was four.<eos> She was an addict, crack.<eos> You could fill in the blanks.<eos> - Why didn't you tell me that?<eos> - I did..
It's over.<eos> I know how difficult it is for you to, Open up to me and... tell me these things.<eos> You gotta mean the world to me.<eos> It means you love me.<eos> Yes, I do.
- How do you know that?<eos> - I saw you.<eos> I watched you.<eos> I know you love him.<eos> I do too.
Bye, Trish.<eos> - You gave her your number.<eos> - Oh, don't start.<eos> - So what?<eos> Yes, I did.
Good luck going down that road.<eos> And what do you think she'd say if she saw how her child is living now?<eos> Do you honestly think she'd be pleased?<eos> That she's living a somewhat normal life?<eos> Yes. I do.
I don't know.<eos> Just tell me.<eos> I would if I could.<eos> But I don't know.<eos> And neither does anybody else.
You like this deal?<eos> I love this deal.<eos> They think they're gonna lose.<eos> Yeah.<eos> They do.
Not polite to assume, you know?<eos> "Marriage"?<eos> Marriage! You don't have...<eos> You go before a judge and you swear to love, honor and cherish each other Until death do you apart.<eos> And do they..
Look at her and tell me I'm wrong.<eos> She is the perfect example of these humans and unworthy of your sympathy in every way.<eos> Destroy her, Diana.<eos> You know that she deserves.<eos> That they all do.
You're back.<eos> Okay, Hildur... finally.<eos> Oslo's decision is that I have to sign off on all subsidy payments.<eos> Erling, you and I came to an agreement...<eos> No, no, no, no, we didn't.
Okay.<eos> Like some kind of puppy, that you tolerated or... or... found amusing... or cute or... loyal or obedient or...<eos> You're not cute.<eos> You never said anything to make me think anything other than all that.<eos> - I don't.
Health issues.<eos> Ever since...<eos> Oh. Well. Vincent, I'm sorry my husband isn't here.<eos> I'm sure Eric would like to say goodbye properly.<eos> - He did.
But the point is, you see...<eos> You didn't die, did you?<eos> Not even over there, where everyone dies.<eos> No.<eos> No, I did not.
I am.<eos> I like to see what lies beneath.<eos> You have goodness in you.<eos> What goodness?<eos> You do, you do.
I hope now is not inconvenient.<eos> Wait!<eos> I wrote a fucking book about chemistry.<eos> If you've got any questions about chemistry, then read that.<eos> I already did.
Who knows?<eos> Our American friends.<eos> You feel me, don't you, when I break in?<eos> - No.<eos> - Yes, you do.
Against people.<eos> For nine years, you have been campaigning for a Royal Commission to investigate the drowning of these 280 slaves, which you say was done deliberately.<eos> It is my belief that some very powerful men in London were involved in an illicit shipment of slaves for personal profit, were complicit in the deaths of those slaves and in the subsequent concealment of the facts.<eos> And you believe that those men are senior directors within the Honourable East India Company?<eos> Yes, I do.
Yes, a good man who killed his wife for convenience.<eos> You know nothing.<eos> Always cow-eyed about your sainted mother.<eos> Or maybe it's about time you know about your mother.<eos> I do.
- On behalf of justice.<eos> - Oh, justice.<eos> Hello.<eos> You believe in justice?<eos> I do.
I have the very same mark on me... from when I was taken prisoner in Africa.<eos> What is it?<eos> You tell me.<eos> You don't speak but you do have answers.<eos> You do.
- What?<eos> If I were caught passing company secrets to a Delaney...<eos> You're not going to get caught because I will protect you.<eos> You know, at the seminary, I was in love with you.<eos> Of course you do.
I hope these pajamas are okay.<eos> They've been in my locker since the time that dog got lost in here.<eos> They're beautiful, Lucy.<eos> Do you remember that night, Andy?<eos> Yes, I do.
Excuse me.<eos> - Hey, sweetheart.<eos> - Hey, mom.<eos> Mona, I didn't know you would be coming tonight.<eos> Neither did I.
Okay.<eos> Please, Wren.<eos> Please, Wren!<eos> - I can't do this!<eos> - Do it!
But Charlotte missed the game.<eos> Why are you giving them so much power over you?<eos> I am the power.<eos> Don't you get it?<eos> No. I don't.
Hey, there.<eos> Hey.<eos> You know me, right?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, of course, you do.
- I believe you did.<eos> - I did not say that.<eos> - I believe you did.<eos> - No.<eos> No, I didn't. I...
- I did not say that.<eos> - I believe you did.<eos> - No.<eos> No, I didn't. I...<eos> - You did, Dick.
Let's just - stick with the "damn."<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Definitely.<eos> - Much better.<eos> - Do that.
We're just asking for one night off.<eos> Well... not quite sure what to say.<eos> Just thought the crepes would be a special treat, but... we... we don't have to have 'em.<eos> Not if people don't want them.<eos> No, we do.
Have you thought about seeing a counselor?<eos> My God, we don't need a counselor.<eos> Couples fight.<eos> You telling me you and Perry don't ever fight?<eos> No, we do.
Oh, wait, wait, so, now I'm supposed to trust Peter Hale?<eos> I want you to trust me.<eos> I heard Stiles on that radio, I'm sure of it.<eos> - If you had heard it too...<eos> - Well, I didn't.
They were everywhere.<eos> Some of the kids were running.<eos> But for everyone else it, it was like there was nothing there.<eos> They couldn't see a thing.<eos> We did.
Remember?<eos> He can still hear you.<eos> Then he can hear me say he needs to shut up so we can figure out how to fight the Ghost Riders.<eos> You don't need to figure it out.<eos> Because Douglas already did.
That's ridiculous.<eos> We went to Big Sur.<eos> No.<eos> We always wanted to go to Big Sur.<eos> We did.
You also need a transformer that can handle five billion joules of electricity.<eos> I know where to find one and I can show you how it works.<eos> I'll tell you if Malia promises not to kill me.<eos> She promises.<eos> No, I don't.
She was the only one left.<eos> She had to fill a void.<eos> So she filled it with her son.<eos> And you saw this kid?<eos> We all did.
Mistres of the Western Fields,<eos> Vessel of Truth and Solace.<eos> Sorry to keep you waiting.<eos> You should have sent someone ahead.<eos> I did.
Cordelia stars with C.<eos> Look, if you're gonna risk your life to see The Wizard, it'd just be nice to know that you have the right coat.<eos> Well, don't you want to see him, too?<eos> Don't you want to find out who you really are?<eos> - Of course I do.
You were quite alone when we found you.<eos> That's not possible.<eos> She wouldn't have left me.<eos> Well, she might have thought you were dead.<eos> We did.
What do you want from me?<eos> You're my friend.<eos> Why are you laughing?<eos> Do you even know what a friend is?<eos> Of course I do.
Because of me.<eos> And now... I've betrayed another.<eos> I knew you couldn't be so mean to leave me here.<eos> But I am.<eos> I did.
- Yes.<eos> Then do something.<eos> I can't.<eos> Don't you remember anything that happened between us?<eos> Of course I do.
Eamonn, is it true?<eos> War is coming?<eos> Soon.<eos> Who taught you that song, sister?<eos> Why, the Wizaed did.
I remember.<eos> I don't want trouble with any of you.<eos> I want ojo.<eos> Why did you take to a witch who wanted to kill me?<eos> Because the one from the west almost did.
Please, fix her!<eos> Fix her like you fixed me.<eos> Please!<eos> She can't die!<eos> Do for her what you did for me.
- There doesn't have to be a war.<eos> - Is that why the wizard animated the stone giant?<eos> Because he wants peace?<eos> - He didn't.<eos> I did.
- He didn't.<eos> I did.<eos> - how wrong roan was about you.<eos> - He didn't know me.<eos> Now he does.
My name is Woodes Rogers, and I am the next governor of New Providence Island.<eos> Spain... what did you have to promise them?<eos> That I would secure the remains of the Urca de Lima's gold and return it to Havana.<eos> You set aside some of the gold?<eos> She did.
They tell me Laura's dead.<eos> Let me out early.<eos> Coming home.<eos> I bought it. I d... I did!<eos> I did.
Damn right I'm a hustler, swindler, cheater, and liar.<eos> That's why I need assistance.<eos> Fine.<eos> You've told me what you want, but you want to know what I want?<eos> Of course I do.
I lost count on the Ativan.<eos> I'm interrupting.<eos> You were saying your piece.<eos> No, I'm not.<eos> People did enough talking today.
In the presence of a queen.<eos> Heh, forgot it was Easter.<eos> Well, it is Sunday, 16th of April, seven days after the vernal equinox.<eos> I love Easter.<eos> Many do.
What do you think gods do?<eos> They do what they've always done: They fuck with us.<eos> They fuck with all of us.<eos> Just don't take it personally.<eos> I don't.
I hate feminism, Mum.<eos> It's boring.<eos> - See what we've raised?<eos> - I like wearing make-up.<eos> - Everyone at school does.
- No, not Logan, I knew the guy who came at me.<eos> I think your mom got in my head, alright.<eos> I think she got in my head...<eos> Yeah, and it worked I thought.<eos> - No, it did not.
Fuck your vocabulary.<eos> Okay? This is gibberish.<eos> You may have to consider that you didn't see what you saw.<eos> - Or...<eos> - Or you did.
THE BAR<eos> Marta, stop calling. My battery's low.<eos> Something simple. That skirt and the pink sweater<eos> I wore the other day to dinner, remember?<eos> You don't?
Yeah, sure!<eos> And I'm part of your dream?<eos> Why not?<eos> I know you. You play the machines every day.<eos> I don't, just now and then.
There's no bomb!<eos> Tell them.<eos> - Do you know him?<eos> - Yes.<eos> No, I don't. But neither do any of you.
We're not sure, but on second thoughts<eos> Amparo may be right, we should take precautions.<eos> - I'm sure I didn't touch him.<eos> - Me neither.<eos> - You did, you liar!
What works'?<eos> - And before that?<eos> - "I injected one, but it did nothing."<eos> - Injected one?<eos> - Who did?
That has never happened for this school.<eos> All we need is a little more cash to improve our training facilities, and we'll bring home that trophy.<eos> Plus... did I mention... how incredibly hot you look today?<eos> - You did.<eos> - Well, you do.
- He's okay.<eos> He said it was a mistake, but... (sighs) he was at the hospital and he, like, escaped or something, and we thought that he might be on his way back to L.A.<eos> He had mentioned that he has a bunch of, like, film festivals and meetings coming up.<eos> I'm really sorry to hear that, but you know Emmett and I broke up two months ago, right?<eos> No, I... I didn't.
All right.<eos> I love hockey.<eos> I love Amanda. I love supporting her dreams.<eos> Yeah. And you love coffee.<eos> Yes, I do.
- It's a real...<eos> - Let's hear it.<eos> Okay. So we go to Persikof's lawyer...<eos> Mm-mm. What, you know him?<eos> I do.
Looking for something?<eos> What would I be looking for?<eos> You tell me.<eos> Do you even know my name?<eos> - 'Course I do, Clay.
I met Helmet.<eos> Clay doesn't count.<eos> You met him at work.<eos> - I feel like that should count.<eos> - Of course you do.
The hot chocolate?<eos> No.<eos> Why did you and Hannah fight?<eos> I don't get it.<eos> Of course you don't.
What I think... is that you wouldn't do something like that.<eos> I thought you loved Jessica.<eos> I did.<eos> I mean...<eos> Maybe I even still do, but...
Ow! Come on, Alex, play or don't.<eos> We're getting killed!<eos> Fuck you, Montgomery.<eos> - Dude, you team-killed me!<eos> - Yeah, I did.
I heard you, man.<eos> The car alarm.<eos> I live right over there.<eos> Besides, you're not the first one to come look at the famous window.<eos> We all did it.
Honey, our daughter is gone.<eos> Christ, Andy, I know that!<eos> I have to know why.<eos> I need to know why.<eos> And if you don't, I...
- I look like a punk rock dog. - Mmm-hmm.<eos> What?<eos> Justin, what?<eos> You said you wanted to do this.<eos> I do.
Like, real, and... I fell in love with that.<eos> Real.<eos> So, yeah, I took pictures of her, but that's because girls like that don't hang out with the yearbook guy, with me.<eos> Why didn't you just talk to her?<eos> Why didn't you?
You answered, "video games."<eos> Favorite kind of music, "obscure indie bands."<eos> Favorite reading materials, "fantasy and sci-fi"?<eos> Dude, why not just say you watch Lord of the Rings on repeat.<eos> I don't do that.
You always seemed like a good guy.<eos> Don't think too hard.<eos> I promise.<eos> I won't.<eos> Then again, they almost always do.
When you've been married as long as we have, the best you can hope for is... takeout and some red wine.<eos> That's not true.<eos> He buys you flowers all the time.<eos> That's true.<eos> He does.
I mean, yeah, I guess I remember.<eos> Why?<eos> Hannah matched with Marcus.<eos> Did she?<eos> Oh, yeah, right, yeah, she did.
Any time.<eos> Yeah, thanks.<eos> I'm going to play mind games with you, just like you played with me.<eos> No.<eos> No, I-I didn't.
Yeah, thanks.<eos> I'm going to play mind games with you, just like you played with me.<eos> No.<eos> No, I-I didn't.<eos> No, I didn't.
So, uh, other than the Dewey Decimal System, what else has the library got going on?<eos> Well, I like to think we are a place where people can come together, find their tribe.<eos> Do you write?<eos> You look like you write.<eos> I don't.
Hannah...<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I didn't mean to make you feel embarrassed or humiliated.<eos> I know what that's like.<eos> You do?
It'll all be fine, okay?<eos> Once these stupid fucking tapes are done.<eos> Can we at least get high?<eos> -You don't even smoke.<eos> -Yeah, I do.
Was it?<eos> Or was it fucking amazing?<eos> That was fucking amazing.<eos> Like... I thought I was gonna die!<eos> But you didn't, did you?
Sometimes you judge people...<eos> I mean, we all do.<eos> Sometimes you just... live to regret it.<eos> You don't know what you're talking about.<eos> Yeah, no, I probably don't.
I mean, we all do.<eos> Sometimes you just... live to regret it.<eos> You don't know what you're talking about.<eos> Yeah, no, I probably don't.<eos> I usually don't, so...
- We shouldn't be talking about this.<eos> - Is he turning you in?<eos> He didn't say.<eos> You like Clay, don't you?<eos> Of course I do.
Maybe she was afraid.<eos> I was so pissed off at Jeff.<eos> And at Hannah, for making it all her drama.<eos> I didn't know.<eos> Well, now you do.
Jesus, Tony.<eos> Death, and rape, and what the fuck is next?<eos> What did I do that Hannah thought was worse than that?<eos> Don't you know what happened?<eos> No, clearly, I don't.
Uh, do you...<eos> Do you want a drink?<eos> I believe you promised me a drink, in fact.<eos> And a ride on your bike.<eos> I did, didn't I?
Okay.<eos> But she's not telling the truth about the way things happened.<eos> She's telling her truth.<eos> Why do you always act like you know?<eos> Because I do.
And I don't know what's gonna happen when you find out hers.<eos> Hey, Mom.<eos> Hi, Clay, it's Mom.<eos> Yeah, I just said that.<eos> So you did. Yeah.
No, no.<eos> What does she say next?<eos> I mean, does she say what she did?<eos> Does she say why?<eos> She does.
I'll go.<eos> But tell me what's going on, okay?<eos> Tell me what's wrong.<eos> You don't want to be with me.<eos> But I do.
But tell me what's going on, okay?<eos> Tell me what's wrong.<eos> You don't want to be with me.<eos> But I do.<eos> - I really do.
About fucking time, you guys.<eos> These cards are getting stale.<eos> Come on, sit down.<eos> Jess and I had this thing planned.<eos> - No, we don't.
I think it's clear what they know.<eos> Look around.<eos> What do we all have in common?<eos> We don't know who got the subpoenas.<eos> Sheri didn't.
Look, I know it's weird, but I was hoping to buy some weed.<eos> It's kind of an emergency.<eos> You want to buy some weed.<eos> From me.<eos> Yes, I do.
So you need some weed, huh?<eos> Yeah, um, I do.<eos> 'Cause you got yours confiscated the other day.<eos> - You heard about that?<eos> - Yeah, everybody did.
Or he failed, and my fate is sealed.<eos> Okay, Mom, I'm off.<eos> Wait, wait, whoa, whoa. Hey.<eos> When do we get to hear about this project?<eos> You don't.
I might have hurt Hannah's feelings... a little bit.<eos> But I didn't mean to.<eos> Hurt her feelings how?<eos> I thought she wanted to date me.<eos> She didn't.
What if we knew what we did wrong?<eos> I don't think Clay Jensen hates you.<eos> I don't know him all that well, but he doesn't seem the type to hate anyone.<eos> It's like it doesn't even matter what you say.<eos> Maybe it does.
An encounter?<eos> Yeah, you could say that.<eos> Did...<eos> You don't want to talk about this.<eos> No, I do.
I can have that for you...<eos> His door is closed behind me.<eos> Right.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> - But you didn't.
Justin.<eos> Justin.<eos> You know the real story, right?<eos> You know what's true.<eos> I do now.
It's critical for commerce. This is known to the world.<eos> Meet me at the jetty.<eos> Are we ready to depart?<eos> Don't remember talking about bringing on new people.<eos> Ah, we didn't.
Richard: How do you know each other?<eos> We go back to the start.<eos> Well, the King is ready to see you.<eos> Did you find Carol?<eos> I did, yeah.
I'm just real sorry they're gone.<eos> Negan murdered Glenn and Abraham, beat them to death.<eos> Terrorized the Hilltop, set loose walkers just to make a point.<eos> I used to think the deal was something we could live with.<eos> A lot of us did.
Previously, on AMC's "The Walking Dead."<eos> I can't believe he would just take our stuff and go.<eos> He obviously doesn't wanna be found.<eos> Yes, he does.
What the hell's wrong with you?<eos> You're bleeding.<eos> They did that to you.<eos> You know what they are.<eos> I do.
You don't know me.<eos> I know... that Carol, living on her own like that... she might as well be dead right now.<eos> She gets hurt, she dies, if she catches a fever, if she's taken out by a walker... if she gets hit by lightning -- anything -- anything happens to her, I'll kill you.<eos> I would die for the Kingdom.<eos> Why don't you?
Look, whatever it is you're holding on to... it's already gone, man.<eos> Wake the hell up.<eos> You're the same as me, Daryl.<eos> You don't know shit about me.<eos> No, I do.
Better than that.<eos> You can call next, but it might be a while.<eos> Oh.<eos> Did you make the pills?<eos> I did.
We just need to find some guns and...<eos> Do you know where we could find that many guns today?<eos> This week?<eos> This year?<eos> No. You don't.
What was it?<eos> It was a deer.<eos> I owe you a deer.<eos> From before. When they were outside the gate.<eos> Yeah, you do.
Olivia would still be alive.<eos> Spencer would still be alive.<eos> And now they're gone, and I'm here because I was stupid enough to listen to you.<eos> But you were.<eos> And you did.
Like you.<eos> Right now.<eos> You don't know shit about shit.<eos> You're right.<eos> I don't.
Someone gave it to me, someone who helped me.<eos> She put her ass on the line for me.<eos> She saved my life, you know?<eos> She didn't have to.<eos> But she did.
She saved my life, you know?<eos> She didn't have to.<eos> But she did.<eos> That means something now...<eos> It does.
I'll talk to Ezekiel.<eos> I'll tell everyone what I did.<eos> And I'll live the rest of my life making up for it.<eos> Did you tell him?<eos> Did you?
Killed Spencer, Olivia...<eos> Jesus brought Rick and the rest here because...<eos> Rick wants to fight them.<eos> You wanted to know.<eos> Now you do.
I was... looking for something to read the other day.<eos> You can have the bullets.<eos> I didn't know you had a gun.<eos> I didn't.<eos> I do now.
And neither will you if you just say "yes."<eos> Please say "yes."<eos> He would want you to.<eos> He wouldn't.<eos> I do.
I want you to sit.<eos> Hey, Cyndie.<eos> You promised.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I did.
Put your hands on your head.<eos> I didn't have a choice.<eos> Why are you here?<eos> I said I didn't have a choice.<eos> But you do, both of you do.
Do you seek to extinguish everything of who you were?<eos> I don't seek it, but... I'm stuck.<eos> You want the Saviors dead?<eos> Morgan.<eos> Yes, I do.
I'm not letting you let my sister die!<eos> Drop the gun!<eos> I wasn't gonna let her die, you [bleep] moron!<eos> Aww. The point is he thought I was going to.<eos> I totally did, by the way.
Whatever you want.<eos> But I'm not that, either.<eos> I'll write down "no religion."<eos> Why did you want to come to Finland?<eos> I didn't.
I'll take you to Mirja, and tomorrow we'll escort you to the police.<eos> You're the best brother in the world.<eos> Remember how I teased you as a child?<eos> When you were really thin.<eos> No, I don't.
Third runner up.<eos> - In the Olympics that's bronze.<eos> - Now see, that's the kind of thinking that's gonna take us straight to the top.<eos> So, I got it Ray.<eos> I did.
I wasn't aware of that.<eos> May I ask what your concern is?<eos> Aren't you the least bit surprised by his recovery?<eos> I believe in miracles.<eos> I don't.
Not at all.<eos> Tell me a little bit about yourself.<eos> I'm an only child.<eos> I attended the local comprehensive school and won a scholarship to read medicine at Cambridge.<eos> I did my postgraduate degree at Oxford, then a doctoral thesis at M.I.T.
Married or divorced?<eos> I'm sorry?<eos> Your finger.<eos> You used to wear a ring.<eos> Now you don't.
Just a few minutes.<eos> Well, it's just a quick call, just to catch up, innit?<eos> Be vague.<eos> I didn't mean to...<eos> No one ever does.
Well, sir, I work here, so that's...<eos> I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.<eos> Sir?<eos> You're gonna have to leave.<eos> I just did.
You think there's a special level of hell for people that killed their loved ones on Christmas Eve?<eos> I wanted the stamps, see?<eos> My dad gave me a car, but I wanted the stamps.<eos> What 17-year-old boy wants stamps when he can have a cherry-red corvette?<eos> But I did.
I've... I've crossed enough paths to know that one in four people are rock stupid.<eos> Even the smart ones have got some kind of delusion they believe in, whether it's gods or ghosts.<eos> Do you believe in love?<eos> Yeah, I believe the shit out of love.<eos> Did you always?
And he picked you.<eos> Congrats.<eos> Do you know that old story, Pinocchio?<eos> No.<eos> No, I don't.
What you weren't supposed to do was take matters into your own hands, break the law.<eos> - I'm sorry, Reda.<eos> I fucked up.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> You did.
Understood?<eos> Something you should know.<eos> What?<eos> Iran doesn't want a nuclear weapon.<eos> It never did.
By pursuing a parallel program in North Korea.<eos> "Appears to be."<eos> The evidence is more than credible.<eos> Saul calls it conclusive.<eos> Mr. Berenson does.
Which brings us right back to what we were discussing the other day.<eos> Who on Earth is advising her?<eos> I know what you're thinking.<eos> - You do?<eos> - Of course I do.
- Asked her point blank,<eos> "Are you advising the president-elect?"<eos> - She said no.<eos> - And you believe her?<eos> Yeah. I do.
It was... It was all over the Internet.<eos> You've never seen it?<eos> No, I-I didn't want to.<eos> Of course.<eos> But I do now.
- It won't.<eos> - Well, we're gonna be asked why we're not bringing a civil suit, that's for sure, why we're not sending a clear message to law enforcement. I... I think they got the message.<eos> What about Sekou?<eos> Doesn't he deserve to be compensated?<eos> Of course he does.
Sure.<eos> Mr. Hashem, you haven't eaten a thing.<eos> Here. Don't mind if I do.<eos> So Simone told me you got me my job back.<eos> - Yeah, we did.
- Well, don't worry.<eos> I was with Franny.<eos> We were fine.<eos> A man came to school, and he had painted hair, and he scared Mommy.<eos> No, he didn't, sweetheart.
Protection?<eos> Even my mom was looking at me funny.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Well, guess what. People are looking at me, too.<eos> These people here do.
- Is this about the bomb?<eos> - No. Tovah Rivlin, Mossad agent.<eos> I need what you have on her... Movements and contacts for the past two weeks.<eos> So, even if we had such information...<eos> You do.
Okay.<eos> I'll go down there and check it out.<eos> If that guy...<eos> If he's involved in the bombing, like those photos suggest, but he wasn't working with Sekou, I don't even know what we're saying here.<eos> I don't, either.
Did you... did you see anything else?<eos> Did he put a bomb on the van?<eos> You said...<eos> "P-Protect Franny."<eos> And I did.
How many times in your life are you gonna be alone with the next President of the United States?<eos> I guess I don't trust you.<eos> And why is that?<eos> You backed away from the war.<eos> I did, yep.
Great name.<eos> I named him when I was little.<eos> That's all I could say.<eos> Do you like rabbits?<eos> Yes, I do.
When I left this morning, I asked him to protect my daughter.<eos> And he is!<eos> From people throwing rocks, from this army you've got out here.<eos> - You don't know that.<eos> - Yeah, I do!
General, you were in the Pentagon on 9/11.<eos> That's right.<eos> You had a plane come right through your office window.<eos> Where did you run to?<eos> - We didn't.
However complicated my life was, his was 1,000 times more.<eos> It didn't end well.<eos> At all.<eos> Maybe I was afraid she would remind me of that.<eos> And did she?
I knew where everything was heading.<eos> I... I knew.<eos> And I pushed him toward that.<eos> I-I really... I really don't like this.<eos> No one does.
I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> You stay.<eos> I would never hurt you, Peter.<eos> You know that.<eos> I don't.
I told you to leave him alone.<eos> And I told you there were other opinions.<eos> You answer to me, you fuck.<eos> To me, you hear that?<eos> Yeah. I do.
Andrew Keane just ran away.<eos> Cowardice runs in the family.<eos> Dar Adal's handiwork.<eos> You don't know that.<eos> Of course I do.
He had multiple contacts with each of the core conspirators Of course he did-- in the context of his job.<eos> We're in the process of evaluating those conversations now.<eos> David, you sent me out there to personally assure people this would never happen.<eos> You- - You used me.<eos> Yes, we did, and for good reason.
When Pallis gets here, you need to tell him what you just told me.<eos> I-I know...<eos> I know it won't be easy, but at least I understand, now, what happened here. You don't.<eos> - Quinn--<eos> - You don't.
She didn't deserve this, okay?<eos> - Any of it.<eos> She's...<eos> - No. No.<eos> No one does.
I would love to, but I don't have a patient in 3.<eos> Your, uh, Magic Mike?<eos> I told Williams to discharge him.<eos> You did?<eos> Of course you did.
Congratulations, by the way.<eos> "The fault, Dear Brutus, is not in our stars," "but in ourselves."<eos> Think Joel used to say that before he, uh, went into surgery.<eos> Joel loved him some Shakespeare.<eos> Yes, he did.
Rhymes with Durst.<eos> - Nora. - Hmm?<eos> How'd you break it?<eos> I don't wanna lie to you.<eos> Then don't.
Ginny's not feeling well, so...<eos> Ginny?<eos> Who's that?<eos> You know who she is.<eos> I honestly don't.
You brought your book.<eos> It's not my book. It's Matt's.<eos> But it's about you.<eos> Are you finally gonna read it?<eos> - I already did.
Sorry?<eos> The woman at the bus stop who gave me her baby.<eos> That was a test, right?<eos> We have no idea what you're talking about.<eos> Sure you don't.
You mean David Burton.<eos> You know him?<eos> That woman, she said he was a friend of the captain.<eos> I'd hardly call him a friend, but I know him, sure.<eos> We all do.
You said you quit.<eos> - I did.<eos> - Then you don't need it.<eos> Please give it back.<eos> Like I did with Lily?
You're just gonna leave him?<eos> Well, here's the good news.<eos> If this thing with Kevin doesn't work, who gives a shit?<eos> Officer Koalafart here is gonna drown in the flood tomorrow along with all the rest of us.<eos> But if it does work, sweet Lorelei...
Indeed, it does.<eos> So, is this the part where you call the DSD and shut this operation down?<eos> Do you remember when we were kids after Mom and Dad died, when everyone at the church wouldn't take their eyes off us?<eos> And they'd take us to the movies and bowling and PuttPutt just to keep us busy?<eos> Of course I do.
I made promises. I said I would come back with $16,000 in my pocket and a working pocket.<eos> I was gonna shower Mikey with gifts.<eos> Orchestra seats at a Mets performance. Mud flaps with a sexy man on them.<eos> Wait. This whole time you didn't get paid?<eos> Technically, I did.
He said he'll sell it to the terrorists if we don't give him what he wants.<eos> I am still waiting to find out what that is.<eos> Do you believe he'd really do that?<eos> He's angry, and he's unstable.<eos> I do.
What are...<eos> The Rangers were living under new identities that only three people had access to, the directors of CIA, NSA... and you.<eos> And you think I gave them up?<eos> No.<eos> I don't.
He's also very paranoid.<eos> Carter, Grimes has already gotten away from you once.<eos> We can't let that happen again.<eos> Eric, you and I were operating alone because we didn't know who we could trust.<eos> Now we do.
Dad?<eos> One of our major pipelines had been blown up a year before.<eos> We were facing a catastrophic production shortfall, and my regional director cut a deal.<eos> So you bought oil from terrorists, then?<eos> No, I didn't.
The war really changed him.<eos> I just... never realized how much.<eos> Did you report your observations to your superiors at the time?<eos> No.<eos> I didn't.
I never wanna use a toothbrush again.<eos> Why aren't you cleaning?<eos> My list was very specific.<eos> We finished it.<eos> No, you didn't.
I know you killed Sara Patrell.<eos> Who?<eos> There will always be unfortunate necessities during the construction of a monument such as this.<eos> I thought a cop would understand that.<eos> Angelica did.
It's ridiculous.<eos> I pay a fraction of what it costs you or everyone who lives in Kibera for running water or electricity.<eos> We say there's nothing as expensive as being poor.<eos> Why? Because our government, like every other government, doesn't care about poor people or places like Kibera.<eos> But you do.
I was hoping it'd be you.<eos> Why?<eos> Fuchs doesn't see what you are.<eos> He doesn't know.<eos> But I do.
- The Cannibal?<eos> Clustercide.<eos> Story is he ate his own.<eos> - Do you know his real name?<eos> - No one does.
So when I say, "Go take a flying fuck at a rolling doughnut, Gorski," he can hear that?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I deserve it.<eos> He says he deserves it.<eos> Damn right he does.
- Lito, this is a bit awkward.<eos> I thought your lawyer was gonna talk to you.<eos> I know.<eos> He said that I needed to talk to you.<eos> Oh, he did, did he?
The fake ID is a breeze.<eos> There is only one little problem...<eos> Do you know anything about tending bar?<eos> No, nothing.<eos> She doesn't, does she?
I just wanted you to know that I love you.<eos> And that you aren't alone.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Lito, you have to get up, right now!<eos> If you don't do it...
That's right, kid. In your Hollywood debut, you will be falling in love with three-time Academy Award-winning actor<eos> Blake Huntington.<eos> Why do you care so much about those things?<eos> I'm guessing he already told you what he did with his.<eos> Of course I did.
"And he judged of others by himself, not believing in what he saw, but was convinced that every man had his real, most interesting life under the cover of secrecy and the dark of night."<eos> The Lady and the Dog.<eos> It is.<eos> Iberian Dreams reminds me of Chekhov.<eos> It does.
- Nice.<eos> You know, they say a trained professional can always tell when someone's lying.<eos> That's an exaggeration.<eos> We don't always know.<eos> But right now, I do.
You're a man of vastly untapped potential, Alan.<eos> Your current employment in no way suits your talents.<eos> You were selected from a pool of tens of thousands of people.<eos> I don't recall applying for anything.<eos> You didn't.
- Oh, hello.<eos> We're in here.<eos> You know if the phone works?<eos> Merry Christmas.<eos> It does.
Don't worry.<eos> - Kat is less than a minute out.<eos> - Vent the airlock.<eos> - What about decompression?<eos> - Just do it.
I belong up here.<eos> I don't want to go back down to eight billion of those motherfuckers.<eos> I need you to say you trust me.<eos> Yeah?<eos> I do.
Sometimes the water is high and sometimes it's low.<eos> And for the last day, the water has been very, very, very low.<eos> - I hate water.<eos> - Yes, of course you hate water.<eos> Who doesn't?
Take him down.<eos> They can't.<eos> Can you?<eos> I'm no use to them dead.<eos> - Do it now!
There is no other way of looking at this.<eos> Zack is a convicted murderer.<eos> He tried to kidnap you.<eos> And he wanted to kill you.<eos> Then why didn't he?
Always ended up with a black eye, and the same old mess.<eos> I broke out that bedroom on my own.<eos> And now I'm going to break away from him.<eos> I want you to succeed, Trudy.<eos> I really do.
Doctor, the Order of St Raymond Nonnatus is sister Mary Cynthia's family now, and she's already left for the Mother House.<eos> She'll be seen by a Chichester doctor as soon as she arrives.<eos> - Dr Turner.<eos> - Sister... did you see Sister Mary Cynthia before she left?<eos> No, I did not.
You have to make your way through some pretty dense jungle up there.<eos> It just appears that Stephen didn't have one with him.<eos> But he... he must've done.<eos> My thought exactly.<eos> But, yet, he didn't.
And then all you had to do is travel on your own passport and pretend to be her.<eos> I don't know what I was thinking, I mean, I wasn't thinking.<eos> Who at the observatory knows about this?<eos> No-one.<eos> Did Stephen?
Unlike you, my memory will never degrade with age.<eos> Okay, let's just stop the chitchat here, shall we?<eos> Let's just get with the program and get this over with.<eos> So... did you, AMI, attack Ian Goldberg?<eos> No, I did not.
All we can do now is pray.<eos> We went through all 832 voicemails on the FBI tip line.<eos> No leads.<eos> Check them again.<eos> We did.
You're asking me to break the law.<eos> I'm asking you to make a mistake.<eos> Forget to lock up.<eos> Come on.<eos> We did it, Mike.
This is very radicalized neighborhood.<eos> Whoever set you up couldn't have set you up in a worse way.<eos> Throw your phones out the window.<eos> I don't want anyone tracking us.<eos> Do it!
I agree, but she is dangerous.<eos> Why?<eos> Because she snapped a pic of me taking care of a friend?<eos> Hackett knows what Alison and I have been through.<eos> Everyone in this town does.
What is this about?<eos> This is about you, and where you were yesterday when you were supposed to be here.<eos> And what you're willing to do to protect a lie.<eos> I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> Yeah, you do.
I'm so sorry that she just took off, uh...<eos> Someone saw her getting into a cab outside the trauma clinic.<eos> Her therapist, her parents we've all been looking for her for hours.<eos> She didn't tell you that she was coming here?<eos> No, she didn't, so...
Alison Rollins sounds like a mouthful of muffin.<eos> Ezra's still in New York, right?<eos> I-I'm not babysitting this pillow by myself.<eos> Okay, well, our place is loud enough already, Caleb snores.<eos> - No, he doesn't.
Ezra's still in New York, right?<eos> I-I'm not babysitting this pillow by myself.<eos> Okay, well, our place is loud enough already, Caleb snores.<eos> - No, he doesn't.<eos> - Yes, he does.
Sort of explained.<eos> What do we think this means?<eos> It means that the world is much smaller than we ever thought.<eos> Lucas lied to us he said he didn't know anything about Charlotte.<eos> Maybe he didn't.
- Nicole's dad?<eos> - Nicole's... dad.<eos> How are they?<eos> They want me to come back.<eos> - Nicole does?
I think I would just gotten assistant coach.<eos> You don't have to leave.<eos> Who am I if I stay?<eos> Nobody wanted this.<eos> Somebody did.
It's not a game or a computer.<eos> There's electronics in it but the heart of the thing is mechanical.<eos> It was lovingly handmade.<eos> Mona, you have to help me play this game.<eos> - Do what?
- Mona, please.<eos> - Don't ask me to do this.<eos> Mona, I am begging you.<eos> You are the only one who knows what it's like to make something like this.<eos> Yes, I do.
May I?<eos> Of course.<eos> The whole drive up, I thought about just staying on the road.<eos> Just following it someplace else.<eos> And why didn't you?
Then tell us who handed you the cash to make the transfer?<eos> Unless you'd rather tell the state board.<eos> Look, no..<eos> II don't have names.<eos> Alright. I never did.
The missions before, they were for the good of the country, but...<eos> No, this one wasn't about country.<eos> It was about you.<eos> Nobody wants to die to their old life, Sara.<eos> And Michael didn't.
Thank you.<eos> It's all right.<eos> Killing ain't right.<eos> Yeah, I read the Bible.<eos> You did?
We got your wild card ready to go.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Me that should be thanking you.<eos> You brought me all this way.<eos> We did it together.
- I know.<eos> Ahh... Hey, look.<eos> Um, now that everybody's coming back, I just...<eos> I don't want you to think that I expect anything.<eos> Uh, what if I do?
But there I am, just jogging down Wilshire Boulevard.<eos> I'm a full-on crazy person, and I'm jogging at the light...<eos> - She was on the way to the hospital. She just gets a bit nauseous because of, um... the chemo.<eos> You don't like it?<eos> No, I do.
It's all right, I've got her.<eos> We'll take care of her.<eos> Now, you and Gemma both live here?<eos> - Did you live on the island together?<eos> - No. Well, she did, most of the year.
We always stay over in Ambersea.<eos> At the Westcliff Hotel.<eos> So you didn't see Gemma at all on Tuesday?<eos> - No.<eos> - I did.
- No.<eos> We believe they were staying in Ambersea.<eos> I was in The Anchor all night for Sophia's party.<eos> What time did you go home?<eos> Er... well, I didn't, really.
I wasn't even close enough to touch the guy when it kicked off.<eos> But the judge didn't like my face, so...<eos> And you've got no idea why Gemma would've been calling your probation officer?<eos> If I knew, I'd tell you.<eos> But I don't.
But first, I'm going to deal with that asshole.<eos> Oh, I've been waiting to put a bullet in your fucking head<eos> - for a long time.<eos> - Vince, I swear to God.<eos> - I don't...
I was asleep.<eos> Right.<eos> You, uh...<eos> You asked me to trust you.<eos> I didn't.
I don't know.<eos> Oli, you got to go to the police.<eos> - No.<eos> - You can tell them that you cleared her phone because she threatened you.<eos> - She didn't.
Just... I need you.<eos> We were told you wanted to make a statement?<eos> About the murder of Wes Gibbins.<eos> What about it?<eos> I did it.
It should have been you.<eos> We were told you wanted to make a statement?<eos> About the murder of Wes Gibbins.<eos> What about it?<eos> I did it.
Yes.<eos> Who told you?<eos> Nate.<eos> He just wants to know if Frank knew I was pregnant.<eos> Did he?
Every action you take right now has consequences for us.<eos> - Michaela.<eos> - This is my life on the line, and I've worked too hard to have it ruined because someone opened their fat mouth!<eos> You understand... right?<eos> I do.
Hey, yo!<eos> Why you kill that boy?<eos> Hey, I'm talking to you!<eos> Annalise had nothing to do with this.<eos> Of course she did.
They charged Frank.<eos> And?<eos> They charged him as your co-conspirator.<eos> I thought that I could do this, Annalise.<eos> I really did.
Better.<eos> You told me I could come and see you and talk to you when I was ready.<eos> No, I told you to talk to me when you finally wanted to come clean.<eos> So unless you're here to say you didn't actually see Frank in the basement that night...<eos> I did!
- Of course it is.<eos> Can I just speak?<eos> I know you, Annalise, and, yes, I just called you Annalise, which I think is appropriate, considering where we are in our relationship.<eos> You can call me whatever you want.<eos> I just did.
And you're being naive.<eos> Okay, I'm being naive.<eos> And yet, here I am, going through her phone records because you wanted me to.<eos> By the way, you never told me that she called you over to the house that night.<eos> Uh, yeah, I did.
Marry me.<eos> I mean it.<eos> Marry me.<eos> I didn't do it because I was trying to be some saint.<eos> I did it out of guilt.
I'm very well, in fact.<eos> How...?<eos> I always told you I'd get better.<eos> You just never believed me.<eos> Sure I did.
So...<eos> Look, if you want to blame someone, you should blame me.<eos> Jimmy, you're a good friend.<eos> She doesn't deserve you.<eos> No, she doesn't.
Uh, hi, Andrew.<eos> I'm Sara Scofield.<eos> Thanks for taking the time.<eos> By any chance, did my husband Jacob Ness ask you to work on my cell phone?<eos> Yeah, he did, uh, yesterday.
All right, I see you.<eos> Come on, hurry.<eos> Get this off of me.<eos> Hold your hand still.<eos> Just do it already.
I'm in Marseilles. - Marseilles?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I've been working on a couple deals.<eos> I got $100K in my hand. But I want off the hook.<eos> Sure you do.
Jimmy will most likely break in while he thinks I'm sleeping...<eos> I mean, I wouldn't put anything past him.<eos> It just makes the most sense He'll try to steal the tape under cover of darkness.<eos> You really think he's going to do that?<eos> I do, indeed.
God, do it!<eos> Prax, it's not Mei.<eos> Move!<eos> Alex, we're in.<eos> Do it!
He injected Jonathan with demon blood.<eos> Why would he do that?<eos> He's sick.<eos> He thought demon blood would make our unborn child strong.<eos> And it did.
What are you talking about?<eos> I've done nothing wrong.<eos> Five years ago, my father was mauled to death by a white wolf.<eos> That was you.<eos> You did that, didn't you?
He tried tracking you with his parabatai rune, but now, it's like he's stuck in some kind of nightmare and can't wake up.<eos> He was looking for you, so you're the only one who can help him.<eos> Okay. I'll... I'll get there.<eos> But you can't. The Clave still wants you dead.<eos> Yeah, well, who doesn't?
I'm so sorry.<eos> There's something I need to tell you about where I've been and who I am.<eos> It's all right.<eos> I know.<eos> You do?
Okay, Mom...<eos> Mom, listen.<eos> I know I'm back, but I...<eos> I can't have you freak out if I'm out all night or if I sleep all day.<eos> The band does a lot of late-night gigging.
There's just something I need.<eos> The ultimate five-disc collector's edition of Blade Runner.<eos> Final Cut is, like... my favorite film of all time which is what I...<eos> What I should have said to you.<eos> - But you didn't.
- But you didn't.<eos> - No.<eos> Instead I acted like a...<eos> A replicant?<eos> I did, didn't I?
Which you had with you when you time-jumped<eos> - off the Waverider.<eos> - I don't know...<eos> - what you are talking about.<eos> - Yes, you do.
Half of these would bankrupt the city.<eos> The alternative being there's no city left to bankrupt.<eos> We don't have any cards to play, partner.<eos> We got no moves.<eos> GORDON: Yes, we do.
I thought it should be personal.<eos> You were just trying to make me think I had the upper hand.<eos> (chuckles): It all fell into place.<eos> How did you know that Barbara would show up at the warehouse?<eos> I didn't.
She told me that prometheus<eos> Now whether or not that is true, she was going to give us valuable intel on him.<eos> She's playing you, Oliver.<eos> I understand that you're suspicious of her, and I know this Laurel is from another earth, that this is not our Laurel, but we don't know why.<eos> We don't.
I will take on his guards.<eos> Yurievich--<eos> Yurievich is mine.<eos> Please tell me you didn't sleep down here.<eos> I didn't... Sleep.
Hey.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> Um, your mom sent my mom a permission slip.<eos> - Do you not want me here?<eos> - N... No, of course I do.
Right.<eos> You know, the other guys said when you get in one of your moods I should just let you be, but, um, to be honest, brooding really kind of gets on my nerves.<eos> They told you about me?<eos> They tell you about Prometheus?<eos> Yeah, they did. W-W-Why?
I don't know--<eos> I know you've seen this scumbag.<eos> He lives in this neighborhood!<eos> I don't know everybody, dude.<eos> I don't!
He challenged the omnipotence of the gods.<eos> You see, because, like you, they play judge, jury, and executioner.<eos> But Prometheus took away their power.<eos> If that's what you're gonna do to me, you'll need to come up with something better than whatever this is.<eos> I did.
And you...<eos> Are no one's hero.<eos> Everything and everyone that you love will wither and die at your touch.<eos> Good riddance.<eos> What do we do about Kovar?
This is all that we found on your target from all available video sources... Cell phones, traffic cams, security footage.<eos> Please promise me you're never gonna make a Felicity version of this.<eos> The world doesn't need to know how often I'm at the wine shop.<eos> I guess it's too much to hope that Chase took off his mask on camera.<eos> Actually, he did.
The good, the bad, and the ugly I know, and you don't need to punish yourself or isolate yourself, but what you need to do is stop pushing me away because I'm not going anywhere, Oliver!<eos> Do you get that?<eos> What do you want me to do, John?<eos> I've told you what I am, who I am, and even if you don't believe it, I do.<eos> I do.
You're the one who seems to have a problem with the way that I've been running Argus, which is particularly interesting to me since neither one of us has a job that fits the conventional definition of morality.<eos> Well, what's that supposed to mean?<eos> You're upset because Argus is locking people up without due process when you and Oliver and your team of masked recruits has been playing judge and jury for years now.<eos> Lyla, I can't believe you'd actually compare team Arrow to this--this-- this clandestine government superagency!<eos> Well, I just did!
I think they're leaving.<eos> There are patterns on this cloth.<eos> Here?<eos> I don't see 'em.<eos> You don't?
You know where?<eos> It's an abandoned house.<eos> From the description, it sounds like the one on Sparhawk Street.<eos> Do you know that?<eos> Yeah, I do, I do.
Itwon'tendout there.<eos> If we continue to force their hand, sooner or later, they will invade.<eos> Mars is an island.<eos> If we cripple their Navy now, they can't touch us.<eos> Chrisjen: But if they do?
We could've what? Worked out a deal?<eos> With a man who casually murdered countless belters.<eos> A man who was a threat to all human life, and that is why Miller shot him.<eos> He didn't have the right to make that decision.<eos> But you do?
We have a gunship of our own.<eos> Slugging it out with a stealth is not gonna get it done.<eos> If you want to take that station, you need to land an assault team.<eos> Do you have any idea of the resistance inside?<eos> No, we don't.
We look out for each other.<eos> You sure he's clear on that?<eos> Pretty sure.<eos> You did hear the part about him throwing me off the ship without my helmet, right?<eos> -I did.
Killed or displaced a quarter of the entire population on earth during his conquests.<eos> Today, that's the equivalent of 10 billion people.<eos> Eros is hardly a rounding error by comparison.<eos> And that justifies all of this?<eos> Of course it does!
I don't care who controls the project. So long as I can get back to my work, with no restrictions.<eos> So we have an understanding?<eos> We're going to need complete access to the data.<eos> As well as the names of everyone responsible for setting this in motion.<eos> Done.
Those are my words from my letter.<eos> Scott, you used my words?<eos> Oh, well...<eos> You made me a part of your wonderful book for the whole world to read?<eos> You really did it.
Scott, you used my words?<eos> Oh, well...<eos> You made me a part of your wonderful book for the whole world to read?<eos> You really did it.<eos> We did it.
Yeah, but I didn't expect anybody to object, did I?<eos> This was a test, folks, and you all failed.<eos> You really did.<eos> - No, I just...<eos> - Yeah, woman, you really did.
- The video chat? Yeah.<eos> It's got a great tech.<eos> We're growing like crazy.<eos> In fact, that's why we need funding, to keep up with the users, and I think it could be really good if we could just keep it going.<eos> No, you don't.
Missandei.<eos> It is hard for me to say goodbye to you.<eos> Why?<eos> You know why.<eos> I don't.
"All I know is there's more than I know."<eos> Yeah, I think that might sound wiser than it is.<eos> Wow. Okay, wiseass.<eos> So you know what happens after you die?<eos> Yes, I do.
Do not say a word.<eos> Do not tell him anything.<eos> You don't have to.<eos> I already know you.<eos> No, you don't.
Do not tell him anything.<eos> You don't have to.<eos> I already know you.<eos> No, you don't.<eos> Sure I do.
With you?<eos> That's why they call me Mr. World.<eos> And if they don't agree?<eos> I get it.<eos> I do.
The dead, when they come back, are tenacious little bastards and hang on until they're done, and then they're gone.<eos> Hey! Hey!<eos> I know a charm that could lift grief from a grieving heart.<eos> Do you know a charm that can stop bleeding?<eos> No, I do.
We're good.<eos> Officer Andrew Dove, six years with the GCPD, twice decorated.<eos> Up for promotion in six months. Well, congrats, pal, 'cause you're going to Blackgate, and they love cops there.<eos> I stopped being a cop a long time ago.<eos> The hell you did.
Just like you did the other one!<eos> You couldn't have helped it!<eos> And afterward, you would have hated yourself!<eos> Well... we'll never know, will we?<eos> I did it for love.
Did you order the hit on my father?<eos> No.<eos> I respected your father.<eos> Much more than the son he left behind.<eos> But someone did.
And do you know why it does?<eos> People are afraid.<eos> And fear breeds hopelessness.<eos> I'm supposed to believe you care about the people of Gotham?<eos> I do.
Where are we?<eos> Where we are is not important, James.<eos> What matters is why you're here.<eos> You know why I killed my uncle.<eos> Yes, I do.
Half of these would bankrupt the city.<eos> The alternative being there's no city left to bankrupt.<eos> We don't have any cards to play, partner.<eos> We got no moves.<eos> Yes, we do.
I thought it should be personal.<eos> You were just trying to make me think I had the upper hand.<eos> It all fell into place.<eos> How did you know that Barbara would show up at the warehouse?<eos> I didn't.
But he doesn't go back.<eos> I saw him.<eos> In the future, with me and Iris and Savitar, he was there.<eos> I mean, that must mean we don't let her take him back.<eos> Maybe we do.
Harrison Wells was always there for me, so I guess in some weird way, I just... I want to be there for Harrison Wells.<eos> - Anyway... - Yeah.<eos> So what are we doing here?<eos> I thought you didn't want Dad to know we're going after this arms dealer.<eos> Yeah, no, I don't.
Joe already suspects something's up.<eos> You going out there like that, it just hangs a bell on it.<eos> This story is going to change lives, Barry.<eos> Why do you think that you're the only one allowed to risk your life to do good?<eos> I don't.
- And you should've too.<eos> - I know, Joe.<eos> Look, I can understand why they didn't want to tell me because they didn't grow up under the same roof that you did.<eos> They don't know... they don't know what my baby girl means to me,<eos> Barry, but you do.
No, no.<eos> Not at all.<eos> But Gypsy did say I could do some pretty incredible things<eos> - with my powers...<eos> - Yeah, she did.
- Why?<eos> Because of your dad?<eos> Because Barry is going to find him.<eos> Look, you don't know that, okay?<eos> You don't.
I told you I needed you.<eos> I could not defeat Solovar in combat, but you could.<eos> You did, and now I am the ruler of Gorilla City, and all the gorillas will follow me.<eos> Solovar never wanted to attack Central City.<eos> You do.
Just, uh, hanging out.<eos> What're you... what're you thinking about?<eos> Wally.<eos> He wants me to stay here with him.<eos> Yeah, he does.
Okay, so other than Savitar taking scaring-the-bejeezus-out-of-us to a whole new level, did we actually learn anything?<eos> - Please say yes.<eos> - Maybe.<eos> When I mentioned the Stone, he questioned whether or not we'd really gotten rid of it.<eos> We did.
- All right?<eos> All right.<eos> Why not?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I do.
Julian, please.<eos> I should have told you.<eos> I can't believe that you would keep part of that Stone.<eos> Do you not remember what Savitar had me do with that?<eos> Yes, I do.
You going somewhere?<eos> Yeah, I just wanna get back to S.T.A.R. Labs and train.<eos> Seeing as how you exploded on Barry in front of everyone, might want to wait on it.<eos> Well, the truth had to come out, so...<eos> Yeah, it did.
I get it. I also know that sometimes, the old adage is true.<eos> When you get bucked from the horse, best thing you can do... get right back on the damn thing and ride, Wallace.<eos> Ride!<eos> Hello, Barry Allen.<eos> - How do you...
I need you to make me a promise, okay?<eos> If things don't go our way...<eos> - if Savitar kills me...<eos> - He won't.<eos> - if he does...
Hey, dummies.<eos> My palm scan still works.<eos> I don't want to have to do this.<eos> I know you don't.<eos> But I do.
On me, let's go.<eos> Thank you.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - I know how hard this must be.<eos> No, you don't.
I went to the future.<eos> How far?<eos> Eight years from now.<eos> I needed to talk to myself and find out who Savitar was.<eos> Did you?
- What? Wh...<eos> I call Barry Allen to the stand.<eos> Raise your right hand, please.<eos> You swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth?<eos> I do, yes.
Just three musketeers working away.<eos> Just like old times, huh?<eos> Hey, Julian, did Caitlin ever tell you about our time working on the Particle Accelerator with Ronnie?<eos> No.<eos> No, she did not.
I don't care what I have to do.<eos> I swear to you, I will find you a cure.<eos> Caitlin, I love you.<eos> I don't love you, Julian.<eos> I never did.
Wh...<eos> I call Barry Allen to the stand.<eos> Raise your right hand, please.<eos> You swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth?<eos> I do, yes.
Just three musketeers working away.<eos> Just like old times?<eos> Hey, Julian, did Caitlin ever tell you about our time working on the Particle Accelerator with Ronnie?<eos> No.<eos> No, she did not.
I don't care what I have to do.<eos> I swear to you, I will find you a cure.<eos> Caitlin, I love you.<eos> I don't love you, Julian.<eos> I never did.
- I belong completely.<eos> - What?<eos> Yeah, lacking a clear sense of purpose sometimes.<eos> - But then you arrived.<eos> - I did?
- What?<eos> Yeah, lacking a clear sense of purpose sometimes.<eos> - But then you arrived.<eos> - I did?<eos> - Oh, yeah, I did.
Yeah, lacking a clear sense of purpose sometimes.<eos> - But then you arrived.<eos> - I did?<eos> - Oh, yeah, I did.<eos> - Oh, yeah, you did.
- Yeah, you helped.<eos> - I didn't...<eos> I didn't...<eos> - I didn't help.<eos> - Yes, you did.
What are they doing?<eos> Call it extra credit.<eos> I found some descriptions of an antique church bell in your family estate records.<eos> Wait, we have an estate?<eos> Oh, we did.
So... I did find this syringe on the scene.<eos> It had a tiny bit of poison left in it, so, yeah, in theory, someone out there may have been dosed.<eos> Okay, but the other poisons had corresponding antidotes, yeah? Mm-hmm.<eos> Did you find anything to match this one?<eos> I did.
Put it down.<eos> Who was your muse on that, huh? !<eos> Who was your muse, Lucious?<eos> Oh, do you remember this one?<eos> Because I do.
- Yeah, he needs to talk to his mother.<eos> Maybe you should go talk to yours.<eos> - Mom, please.<eos> - That makes sense.<eos> You guys do the family thing, man.
Mama, please, will you leave?<eos> Okay.<eos> You've got 30 seconds to convince us why we should let you live.<eos> Look, I didn't need to be here right now. I could've gone to Witness Protection and taken Bella with me.<eos> Well, why didn't you?
Do me a favor and call Jamal.<eos> Hey, man, come on. You don't want to be doing this.<eos> Why don't you just go home?<eos> You don't know what I want to be doing.<eos> Yeah, I do.
Hey, man, come on. You don't want to be doing this.<eos> Why don't you just go home?<eos> You don't know what I want to be doing.<eos> Yeah, I do.<eos> We both do.
She's dangerous.<eos> I still think it's payback for Angelo.<eos> Your daddy don't even realize it.<eos> I'll give it a month before he makes her kick rocks.<eos> And what if he doesn't?
- She came for me.<eos> I don't want to hear that.<eos> No, if they're going low now, though, then we can go high for once.<eos> Isn't that cute, you learned something from Michelle Obama.<eos> Yes. I sure did, yeah.
You'll have to keep better track of your things, Castiel.<eos> Can I ask you a question?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I-I get wanting revenge.<eos> I-I really do.
I don't believe in torture.<eos> Doesn't work.<eos> Oh, I've seen folks waterboarded, cut on.<eos> And they talk.<eos> Ooh, they do.
Prince of Hell.<eos> It's just a name.<eos> Doesn't mean anything.<eos> Still, the crown is yours if you want it.<eos> I don't.
It's not a bad life.<eos> Speaking of...<eos> Now that you've heard what I have to say, places to be, vampires to behead.<eos> You got a line on vamps?<eos> I do.
Let's get it done.<eos> I'd like that.<eos> Great.<eos> And I'd like a beer.<eos> What did you do?
He just... he just kicked.<eos> Do you want to...<eos> No.<eos> It's not a big deal, Castiel.<eos> He does it, like, 20 times a day.
We take the grace from the baby, from the nephilim, and then the baby just becomes...<eos> Human.<eos> Human.<eos> Wait a minute. That extraction, it nearly killed you.<eos> Yeah, but it didn't.
I-I took it online.<eos> First-time mothers, labor can be 12 to 18 hours, sometimes longer.<eos> It... Although, given this is the child of Lucifer and a quasi-celestial being...<eos> They didn't cover that online?<eos> They did not.
Oh, I wouldn't say that.<eos> It's better than this.<eos> Well, I don't know.<eos> Ain't so bad here, if you like killing angels.<eos> And you do?
- No, we can't!<eos> What if another woman gets raped while we're still discussing?<eos> How would you feel, living with that for the rest of your life?<eos> - I know it's a hard balance.<eos> - You don't, actually.
- Joe Miller.<eos> We should have just thrown him over that cliff while we had the chance, mate.<eos> But we were merciful, weren't we?<eos> We...<eos> Yeah, we did what good people do.
Yeah. More or less.<eos> There were a few of Jim's business associates, you know, suppliers and stuff, who I'd maybe met just the once.<eos> Did you witness the fight between Jim and Ed Burnett?<eos> No.<eos> No, I didn't.
I tried to talk to you earlier, at the football, but there were too many people around.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I heard what happened.<eos> I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> You do.
Look...<eos> What I'm saying is, I didn't attack Trish.<eos> Why would I?<eos> If I wanted to have sex with her, I could.<eos> And I did.
- It wasn't me.<eos> - We'll need your computer.<eos> I think it'd be better if you just told us what the text was supposed to mean.<eos> I didn't send any bloody text!<eos> - Well, someone did.
I'm his girlfriend.<eos> And you're now admitting to sending this text to his wife?<eos> - Ex-wife.<eos> - Not yet.<eos> Yes, I did.
What did you find out?<eos> I got everything you asked for.<eos> I found Joe Miller.<eos> It's time to put things right.<eos> - We did that...
Two years ago... almost.<eos> June 2nd. It was a Saturday.<eos> Do you know who the person was, that did this to you?<eos> No.<eos> I still don't.
- Same on the way back?<eos> - Same on the way back.<eos> - That makes sense.<eos> - Glad you're happy.<eos> Except you didn't.
Saturday morning.<eos> What?<eos> No...<eos> - Trish...<eos> - We did.
She asked me to go along with her, for her ABE interview with the police, when she gave them her full statement.<eos> OK.<eos> It was pretty harrowing.<eos> Just... the detail of what happened to her.<eos> What he did.
Why'd you plead innocent?<eos> Why'd you make us go through that trial?<eos> Show me your phone, Mark.<eos> Why?<eos> Just... do it.
It's pathetic, innit?<eos> What do I do now?<eos> So you not only stole back your phone, you kept what I deleted and you added even more.<eos> - Do you know how much that cost?<eos> - Yeah, I do.
Get up!<eos> Stand up!<eos> Who of you shared the photos of my daughter around the school?<eos> - Dunno what you mean.<eos> - Oh, aye, you do.
You are not very good at it.<eos> And look at you.<eos> You're exhausted.<eos> I want to talk to my solicitor.<eos> Yeah, you do that.
It's a telephone number.<eos> Do you know whose phone number that is, Lucas?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> For the tape, please.<eos> - No, I don't.
Where are the medical files?<eos> They're all right here.<eos> They're all in Russian.<eos> You translated them?<eos> No... but she did.
- It tickles.<eos> It's good.<eos> I don't know much about...<eos> conditioner or stuff like that.<eos> Probably neither did Henry.
"Acting in the role of parent."<eos> That's right.<eos> And that's me.<eos> You see, Violet can get married if she has the permission of her legal guardian.<eos> And she does.
- Use Sunny's.<eos> You stayed up all last night trying to find out Count Olaf's plot.<eos> It's my turn.<eos> I didn't help us.<eos> Yes, you did.
Call my wife!<eos> This is ghastly!<eos> This is phantasmagorical!<eos> You are police officers!<eos> Do something!
And you will make sure that it does not.<eos> You will protect me and my role.<eos> It is to your benefit to have me as governor.<eos> You should act out of rationality, not emotion.<eos> You didn't.
Dake gets our trial?<eos> You had to have known we couldn't prosecute it.<eos> The conflict is too deep.<eos> You said you had a workaround.<eos> Yes, I do.
All right, I went and I tried the door.<eos> All right?<eos> Then I got out of there.<eos> You saw the body?<eos> Yeah, I did.
Then I went, I looked in the RV.<eos> All right, and I got the fuck out of there.<eos> Shit, man, I knew I should have called 9-1-1.<eos> - Didn't want to snitch.<eos> - No, I didn't.
Trying to help other people, it helps me somehow.<eos> At least sometimes.<eos> I'm sure you know what all that feels like, yeah?<eos> Yes.<eos> I do.
Admit it and move on.<eos> And everyone will know I'm a whore.<eos> I understand why you didn't tell us.<eos> Please, you have no idea.<eos> Actually, I do.
How's the finger?<eos> Those fuckers got away.<eos> What about the tag number?<eos> I didn't get the tag number, so...<eos> Oh. I did.
I didn't get the tag number, so...<eos> Oh. I did.<eos> Didn't I say that?<eos> No.<eos> I did.
Uh, Pete and I lost a client yesterday.<eos> We wanted to make sure her collateral was, um, secure, and I couldn't open the safe.<eos> Oh, I changed the combination.<eos> Didn't I tell you?<eos> - No, you didn't.
Oh, really, is that all it is?<eos> You think I miss being in the game.<eos> Katie, you're so good at it, I mean, come on.<eos> No, I do miss it.<eos> I do.
Uh, they said to put my things in the mailbox.<eos> Yes, please.<eos> Anything with a battery.<eos> Did your brother ever have a key to the house?<eos> Before the recent trouble, he did.
Yeah!<eos> And then, um... and then we went and got, uh, it was a-a-a raspberry Linzer torte in Innsbruck?<eos> - Mm. - To make ourselves feel better?<eos> Mm. You said, "We'll never finish this!"<eos> And then we did.
How long exactly?<eos> Nearly 10 years.<eos> How did you come to know him?<eos> His brother asked to hire him in the mail-room at our firm.<eos> - And you did.
- That's yours.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> Please raise your right hand.<eos> Do you swear or affirm to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth?<eos> I do.
Split me apart at the seams, like a murderer confessing on an episode of "Perry Mason."<eos> Well, I'm sorry to disappoint you, Jimmy.<eos> Have I answered your questions to your satisfaction?<eos> Do you have anything else?<eos> Yeah, I do.
You don't want to know.<eos> But we would need to be shooting in the next 15 minutes.<eos> Now, there's "Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat."<eos> Why don't they make, like, a Moses musical?<eos> - They did.
But we would need to be shooting in the next 15 minutes.<eos> Now, there's "Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat."<eos> Why don't they make, like, a Moses musical?<eos> - They did.<eos> - They did.
Any of it. On that, we can agree.<eos> Yeah, I know.<eos> That's why I'm here.<eos> I wanna hire you again.<eos> Do what now?
Usually we turn a blind eye, unless it's causing a problem.<eos> What if it is causing a problem?<eos> - Then things get fun. - Mm.<eos> Van, I think I know how to fix the photo situation.<eos> Already done.
You don't think the finger guns are a little much?<eos> - Hey Van! - Pew, pew, pew.<eos> Hey! You tell me.<eos> - Know what the best part is?<eos> - Yes, I do.
Act like you're talking to your wife or something.<eos> My wife dumped us eight years ago.<eos> Have you seen Mattie?<eos> You need to move to your right, towards the airplanes... fast as you can. - Why?<eos> - Just do it now, please.
So we're just gonna hand him over?<eos> Wait a minute, how the hell did they find out we have him?<eos> - I don't know yet.<eos> - Did anyone else know, apart from us? No, no.<eos> They did not.
- No, I didn't do that.<eos> I swear on...<eos> If they knew about the two CIA officers and the meeting place,<eos> - why didn't they know about you? - I don't know.<eos> But now they do.
Which is?<eos> My mom says I should never speak to you again.<eos> But I...<eos> Even though you don't like me like that, I still want us to be friends... Best friends.<eos> You do?
Are you living mannequins suggesting I had something to do with my brother's death?<eos> We're just curious.<eos> What do the police think happened?<eos> I'll tell you what I told them, which is that Jason did fall into the water.<eos> We both did.
Weatherbee just asked me if I knew anything about Jason.<eos> And?<eos> What did you say?<eos> Nothing.<eos> That I didn't.
Jason.<eos> He's gone...<eos> I know.<eos> I know he is.<eos> No, you don't.
- For divas of color?<eos> Maybe, maybe.<eos> Look, this isn't LA or New York, this is Riverdale, and people's minds are opening up, but do you have any idea how much hate mail my mom got when she was elected mayor?<eos> I campaigned for your mom, I get it.<eos> No, no, no, baby, you don't.
A relationship... I was married to a man who would come home from work every night, late, and drunk, and with a temper.<eos> One night, I ended up in the emergency room with broken ribs and a shattered collarbone.<eos> The next morning, he barely even remembered the fight, and he promised that it wouldn't happen again.<eos> But...<eos> It did, again.
You dragged me out of the Blossom house, and then you don't talk to me the whole way home.<eos> Dad, Jason and Polly were engaged.<eos> Did you know that?<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Of course you did.
Just that I had a few words with our director/host, and reminded him that he's heard you sing on numerous occasions.<eos> Even though it compromises my artistic integrity.<eos> Cutting to the chase, you have a slot if you want it.<eos> Veronica, thank you, but you saw what happened.<eos> We all did.
Oh, of course not, honey.<eos> She's welcome back.<eos> Where will the baby sleep?<eos> Sweetie, um, we've talked to your sister about this, and she's agreed to put the baby up for adoption.<eos> Polly did?
She's carrying Jason's baby.<eos> That trumps everything.<eos> Do you know where she is?<eos> If I did, I wouldn't tell you.<eos> - Oh, my God, you do.
But Mr. Andrews still doesn't know that Daddy is the buyer?<eos> All of which is to say the timing of this shower is just...<eos> It's not ideal.<eos> Plus, I can't believe Alice even wants to come, from what you've told me.<eos> She doesn't.
You want to play house with her, and throw her a baby shower, fine.<eos> But the very next day, all of those things will still be true.<eos> And she's supposed to what?<eos> Raise a child?<eos> Mothers do it every day.
Archie.<eos> If music be the food of love, play on, play on.<eos> Did you know this week's the official start of maple syrup season?<eos> I...<eos> No, I didn't.
That means partnering with people like you, good people.<eos> This is why Cliff Blossom bought out my crew?<eos> Sent thugs to beat up teenagers?<eos> Clifford didn't send those thugs.<eos> Hiram did.
Valerie, hi.<eos> I thought you should know,<eos> Cheryl poured some insane poison into my ear about how close you two are getting.<eos> She legit thinks she's going to steal you away from me or something.<eos> - No, she doesn't.
I thought you should know,<eos> Cheryl poured some insane poison into my ear about how close you two are getting.<eos> She legit thinks she's going to steal you away from me or something.<eos> - No, she doesn't.<eos> - Yes, she does.
- Yeah. You better.<eos> These kids are more on the ball than the Sheriff.<eos> Let's go.<eos> You do know my dad has a drinking problem, right?<eos> Of course I do.
- Hi.<eos> - Hey.<eos> Right this way.<eos> I thought you said she wanted me to be here.<eos> She does.
Do not push me tonight, Mom, because I will push back.<eos> If FP confesses, he might drag us into this.<eos> Talk about our dealings with the Serpents.<eos> But at least we'll know if Dad hired him to...<eos> And if he did?
I don't know, wistfully.<eos> - Wistfully?<eos> - Longingly.<eos> Like you liked Betty.<eos> I do.
Just humor me now.<eos> Mr. Holland, you're Ms. Wirth.<eos> Why is this so important to your case?<eos> - I have no idea.<eos> - Sure you do.
Can you give us a minute alone, please?<eos> Without physical evidence connecting you to the murder, we have reasonable doubt.<eos> We have it.<eos> But with you offering them your blood and spit on a silver platter, who the hell knows what they're gonna find?<eos> You don't, Perry Mason.
Let me.<eos> You know it when you see it. You're on a subway.<eos> You see someone talking to themselves, maybe they're a little disheveled, and you think to yourself,<eos> "-a crazy person."<eos> We all do it.
You don't need to have Dr. Baldridge try and make sense to you of what was going on in Mr. Wilson's mind leading up to the attack, because you know there's no sense to be made.<eos> You can see that sitting right there... is a sick man.<eos> And I needed you to see it.<eos> So much so that I took Lester off his medication so you could see his illness for yourself.<eos> And you did.
That's the funny thing about freedom.<eos> It gives our enemies the freedom to destroy us.<eos> Cut a deal.<eos> O'Boyle said Jafar is not interested in a deal.<eos> Of course he did.
With Teddy just now, there was a thing.<eos> You all right?<eos> Yes, of course.<eos> Also, stop doing that.<eos> Doing what?
Coming up to me with your concern.<eos> You don't get to do that anymore.<eos> - Come on.<eos> - You didn't choose me.<eos> Nobody does.
What do you say, Dr. Palmer, want to save a life together?<eos> It's okay, baby.<eos> He's getting worse by the hour.<eos> Please tell me you have good news.<eos> We do.
Who's that?<eos> I recognize him from somewhere.<eos> Follow him, go.<eos> What?<eos> Please, just do it.
Oh, I love it!<eos> Signs of indecision appear early in life, Holden.<eos> Mom, Charlie doesn't want to see<eos> - what happened when I was six.<eos> - Yes, I do!
Mom, Charlie doesn't want to see<eos> - what happened when I was six.<eos> - Yes, I do!<eos> - Yes, thank you.<eos> - Yes, I do!
He'd better learn.<eos> He basically married the heroine of his stories.<eos> This city doesn't make a lick of sense to me.<eos> I don't know what I'm doing here.<eos> No one does.
Good God.<eos> You look incredible.<eos> I'm sorry that I was so thoughtless.<eos> I tried the group out.<eos> I really did, but...
Oh, and...<eos> There is a baby that has been squawling for an hour.<eos> Please do something to make it stop.<eos> I don't hear a baby, sir.<eos> You don't?
He never stops moving, except for that damn flute.<eos> Uh, Tana's a wonder.<eos> We should have hired him the minute we got here.<eos> You said it yourself. You don't want to cook and clean.<eos> No. I don't.
I love it. I swim every day.<eos> I thought, oh, that's where I belong.<eos> But then I have to come out.<eos> I have to come out, don't I?<eos> Oh, yes, yes, of course, you do.
Oh, well, this is just what I needed.<eos> Oh, it is so comforting to be among friends.<eos> Montgomery certainly misses you two.<eos> That'll have to be their cross to bear, because I do not miss Montgomery.<eos> I do.
Montgomery certainly misses you two.<eos> That'll have to be their cross to bear, because I do not miss Montgomery.<eos> I do.<eos> - God, Beadsie.<eos> - I do.
Here, here.<eos> I haven't thrown a dart since I was a young man.<eos> It's like riding a bicycle.<eos> So, did Zelda mention the family supper?<eos> Yes. Yes, she did.

Have fun with the Muggle.<eos> Oh. Hi, George.<eos> It's George.<eos> Do you know my name?<eos> Of course I do.
Who is Robert?<eos> You just yelled, "Robert, no."<eos> What? No.<eos> I didn't.<eos> Uh, yeah, you did.
- But I don't want to hurt her.<eos> - You know, I'm proud of you, Josh.<eos> I mean, usually, when you get upset, you run to the nearest pretty girl, like...<eos> Ben Affleck runs to the nearest role with a Boston accent.<eos> I do?
- You know, I'm proud of you, Josh.<eos> I mean, usually, when you get upset, you run to the nearest pretty girl, like...<eos> Ben Affleck runs to the nearest role with a Boston accent.<eos> I do?<eos> He does?

Ben Affleck runs to the nearest role with a Boston accent.<eos> I do?<eos> He does?<eos> Yeah, you do.<eos> And he does.
She's torn, right?<eos> And your little comment possibly tips the scales against me.<eos> Did you ever think of that?<eos> Mm, mm, I guess I didn't.<eos> No, you didn't.
Did you ever think of that?<eos> Mm, mm, I guess I didn't.<eos> No, you didn't.<eos> I guess I didn't.<eos> No, you didn't.
Okay. That's enough.<eos> That's enough.<eos> - You good? - Good.<eos> Did they find her?<eos> Yeah, they did.
I was informed that you had taken a mental-health day.<eos> Dawn, hi.<eos> Can I talk to you about this later?<eos> I meant to talk to you, but I...<eos> But you didn't, did you?
Oh, I just heard about Kevin.<eos> Honey, I'm so sorry.<eos> I'm gonna go to Christine's.<eos> You want to come?<eos> Yeah, yeah, I do.
- Well, it was.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> The people in it hadn't had a wash?<eos> You know very well what I mean.<eos> I don't.
I love him!<eos> He loves me!<eos> I know he does!<eos> He wrote Jennifer Sometimes for me!<eos> - No, he didn't.
They weren't soldiers going into battle -- they were men doing a job.<eos> And it could've been avoided.<eos> Mrs Shelagh Turner.<eos> Your turn.<eos> Do your best for them.
Shelagh?<eos> You must've seen babies that lived as long as mine did.<eos> Yes.<eos> Do they have fingers and toes?<eos> Yes, they do.
I mean he could've...<eos> Anything could've...<eos> Something really terrible...<eos> I know, I know.<eos> But it didn't.
- Lucky you.<eos> The only thing in mine is the faint aroma of wee.<eos> It reminds me of when we went camping.<eos> Best holiday ever.<eos> Oh, don't.
She's leaving on the boat with a chaperone.<eos> She's going back to Somaliland?<eos> Deka didn't say anything about leaving.<eos> She didn't know.<eos> None of us did.
I will get this figured out.<eos> And to answer your question... no, I didn't do it.<eos> I didn't ask you that.<eos> Yes.<eos> You did.
You do remember my name.<eos> I thought since maybe I hadn't heard from you, you might have forgotten.<eos> You shouldn't be calling me.<eos> You didn't think I'd just stay in my hole, did you?<eos> Maybe you did.
And I know that we left things badly, but we've had a lot of good...<eos> What do you want, Cyrus?<eos> Going forward, I need you to stay quiet about me... about us.<eos> The way I see it, we had a... misunderstanding about the plan, and I don't blame you for that.<eos> I don't.
Pinto and Butkiss got such crap, right?<eos> ‐ Yeah.<eos> ‐ Remember Benson Butkiss?<eos> ‐ Yeah, I do.<eos> I sure do.
And I'm not beholden to my ancestor's vows.<eos> Then why are you here?<eos> Because I need your help, and you need mine.<eos> Did you see three dragons flying overhead when you arrived?<eos> I did.
It's the fastest way to win the war, but you won't do it, which means, at the very least, you're better than Cersei.<eos> Still, that doesn't explain why I need your help.<eos> Because right now, you and I and Cersei and everyone else, we're children playing at a game, screaming that the rules aren't fair.<eos> - You told me you liked this man.<eos> - I do.
It's hard for me to fathom.<eos> It really is.<eos> If someone told me about the white walkers and the Night King...<eos> You probably don't believe me.<eos> I do, actually.
It really is.<eos> If someone told me about the white walkers and the Night King...<eos> You probably don't believe me.<eos> I do, actually.<eos> You didn't before.
- I did, yes.<eos> I forbade it because it is dangerous and rarely successful, especially on someone of that age.<eos> You could have infected yourself and others.<eos> You could have devastated the entire Citadel.<eos> But you didn't.
- I'm at war.<eos> I'm losing.<eos> What do you think I should do?<eos> I never thought that dragons would exist again.<eos> No one did.
Daenerys is not her father.<eos> She's even willing to suspend the hostilities if Cersei agrees to certain terms.<eos> If you want Cersei to bend the knee, you can ask her yourself.<eos> I- - I don't.<eos> And Daenerys doesn't.
- Who's that?<eos> Your father.<eos> I suppose you favor your mother.<eos> You knew him?<eos> Of course I did.
A mountain like an arrow head.<eos> Are you sure?<eos> We're getting close.<eos> Do you know what I like about you?<eos> - I honestly don't.
Go on.<eos> Alright.<eos> I just got bit by a dead bear.<eos> Aye.<eos> You did.
Yeah, on three.<eos> - One.<eos> Three.<eos> - Okay. - Okay, hey, did we remember - Ed and Trish?<eos> - Yes, I did.
What time did you leave the club yesterday?<eos> Must have been about six.<eos> A couple of the lads were still training.<eos> Trust these lads to lock up, do you?<eos> Course I do.
Jeb Cornish weighs in at 100 and 70 pounds!<eos> You must have known Roy Tomkins, too.<eos> Must I?<eos> He used to work as a doorman for Mr Nelson.<eos> Plenty of boxers do.
It was reported as a John Doe.<eos> Homeless man in Hollywood.<eos> Took a few days to make an ID.<eos> Some people don't get obits, do they?<eos> No, they don't.
Cave Cave Deus Videt.<eos> "Beware, Beware, God Sees."<eos> You speak Latin?<eos> No.<eos> Google Translate does.
Tuan, that wasn't why we were...<eos> it's alright. My organization will forgive me.<eos> I said that you both did a lot of great things during our work together.<eos> But I had to point out there were certain lapses regarding your cover arrangements, which I told you about during the operation.<eos> Yes, you did.
But I had to point out there were certain lapses regarding your cover arrangements, which I told you about during the operation.<eos> Yes, you did.<eos> I also put in my report that I believe the success of the mission was risked at the very end, because your commitment to achieving our goal was overridden by certain petty bourgeois concerns.<eos> We were afraid Pasha would die, Tuan.<eos> But he didn't.
Yeah.<eos> You know, you're really very beautiful.<eos> Knock it off.<eos> You still get embarrassed when somebody gives you a compliment?<eos> Well, I don't. I... no.
How should we spend it?<eos> Marius was here last night.<eos> - Bullshit.<eos> - He had a gun, and he was going to kill anyone who came between you and him.<eos> - Why didn't he?
It's pretty nice, huh?<eos> Well, it's on a golf course.<eos> What do you think, Spartacus? - Hmm?<eos> - Oh... you love it just like Mama, don't you?<eos> Hmm? Yes, yes you do.
Well, not yet.<eos> Couple of replacement parts, some man hours.<eos> If anybody can fix it, it's you, Holden.<eos> You saved all this?<eos> Of course I did.
What do you want?<eos> I want you to help me get Marius.<eos> - He's not a good guy.<eos> - We don't know where he's at.<eos> - Your wife does.
I want you to help me get Marius.<eos> - He's not a good guy.<eos> - We don't know where he's at.<eos> - Your wife does.<eos> - No, she doesn't.
Stay away?<eos> So are these people dangerous?<eos> Where is Holden?<eos> I told you, I don't know.<eos> - Then who does?
Haven't you ever wondered why you were able to survive so long in that coma with no ill effect?<eos> That place you spent those 12 years... it kept you alive.<eos> Kept me alive?<eos> The Realm almost killed me.<eos> But it didn't.
I liked those stories we read, especially about the fish who got too big for the pond.<eos> That's a really good one.<eos> You don't believe in the Greatest Day, do you?<eos> No.<eos> I don't.
Lindsey says you have to believe in the Greatest Day to be a part of it.<eos> I just don't want you to be left behind.<eos> I know what Lindsey says.<eos> She's just a girl, love. She doesn't have all the answers.<eos> And neither do I.
Yeah.<eos> You disappeared, brother.<eos> - But I read your book.<eos> - You did?<eos> We all did.
Noah's not doing well?<eos> No, he's not.<eos> Okay, so did you reach Nina?<eos> She come to get him?<eos> Um, no, she didn't.
He-he...<eos> This has to end right now.<eos> He's twice your age and he's using you.<eos> You have no fucking idea what you're talking about!<eos> Yes, I do!
You can't go anywhere, not like that.<eos> Vik said he would take a look at you before work.<eos> That's not necessary, thanks.<eos> I'm happy to leave if you want me to.<eos> He doesn't.
Vik said he would take a look at you before work.<eos> That's not necessary, thanks.<eos> I'm happy to leave if you want me to.<eos> He doesn't.<eos> You don't.
I know you.<eos> I know you.<eos> What?<eos> You don't know me.<eos> You don't.
I know you.<eos> What?<eos> You don't know me.<eos> You don't.<eos> - I do. - You don't.
What?<eos> You don't know me.<eos> You don't.<eos> - I do. - You don't.<eos> I do.
You don't know me.<eos> You don't.<eos> - I do. - You don't.<eos> I do.<eos> No, you don't.
- Fucking backwoods shithole.<eos> I got out.<eos> And you got stuck there.<eos> - I don't want to hurt you, man. - Yes, you do!<eos> - You... - No, I don't.
Why'd you do that?<eos> 'Cause I had an affair.<eos> Why'd you have an affair?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Yes, you do.
- No?<eos> - No.<eos> No, I remember our last night in Buenos Aires.<eos> You played me this song.<eos> I did.
Vanessa can't even get herself out of bed.<eos> Poor thing.<eos> So sudden.<eos> You know how it is with these kinds of things.<eos> I do not...
Because she's an innocent victim.<eos> Well, that's never been a problem for Jake.<eos> Jake believes my father might have some bigger plan, and that Jennifer could be the key to figuring it out.<eos> What?<eos> And you don't?
You are being played.<eos> The warrant was served by the attorney general himself, who accompanied Vice President-Elect Beene to Maryland Hamilton Federal Penitentiary.<eos> Tell me you're not seriously considering making this a death-penalty case against Cyrus.<eos> The chief of staff doesn't make these decisions.<eos> The president does.
Please.<eos> Huck, what was she driving?<eos> Huck, don't you dare give up on me.<eos> You hear me?<eos> Do you? !
You used to be a big dog, and now...<eos> - Now what?<eos> - Now I barely recognize you.<eos> - I get it, Liv.<eos> - You don't.
No, I didn't give it to you!<eos> What does that mean?<eos> Forget it.<eos> If you have something to say...<eos> I don't.
This is the Oval!<eos> I was born for this!<eos> This is mine!<eos> You don't want to win this way.<eos> Yes, I do!
I was born for this!<eos> This is mine!<eos> You don't want to win this way.<eos> Yes, I do!<eos> You don't!
- I know that.<eos> - Well... good for you for learning something.<eos> Are we done?<eos> Rowan, I know... about the boxes they sent you.<eos> Do you?
You really want me to answer that?<eos> I asked you to be a friend.<eos> I told you about all the horrible things I did because I needed a friend and you agreed, and now you're holding it against me.<eos> You asked Liv to forgive me.<eos> She did.
Like, we can move to Tahiti and be assassins for hire.<eos> Or, you know, we could, protect Tahitians from assassins.<eos> You want to be a gladiator in a swimsuit?<eos> Look, my point is just because Olivia traded in her white hat for the White House doesn't mean we have to stop being gladiators.<eos> No. It doesn't.
Don't you, baby?<eos> Don't you remember?<eos> Don't you remember?<eos> Don't you remember?<eos> Don't you? !
Don't you remember?<eos> Don't you remember?<eos> Don't you? !<eos> Don't you, baby? !<eos> Don't you?
Been on my "Eat, Pray, Love" ish.<eos> As much as I would like to hear about, but, as you say, tick, tock.<eos> How have you been?<eos> As if you didn't know.<eos> I don't.
Mellie, I'm sorry.<eos> Don't be.<eos> I'm sure there are a dozen people who would've loved to do what you did.<eos> I failed.<eos> No, you didn't.
I told him it was irr-elephant. [irrelevant]<eos> I heard you were the new Interim Chief.<eos> Yeah, that's the rumor.<eos> I didn't think you'd want to be Chief again.<eos> I don't.
To genetically improve the human race!<eos> We all contribute and we all benefit.<eos> I-I had some pretty beneficial science stolen from me.<eos> Do you know a Rachel Duncan?<eos> Oh, we do now.
Now, where's Helena?<eos> - Uh, in the woods!<eos> - What's her back-up plan?<eos> - I don't know her back-up plan!<eos> - You do.
- What's her back-up plan?<eos> - I don't know her back-up plan!<eos> - You do.<eos> - No!<eos> No, I don't.
If I win, she goes.<eos> They all go.<eos> They are bound by ancient law to leave this planet in peace.<eos> - She's not gonna win.<eos> - But what if she does?
Come.<eos> Jasper. How are you?<eos> My Lady Margaret.<eos> Who would have thought to find us here like this with Henry on the throne.<eos> I did. I always did.
Unlock the door!<eos> So, this is how the King of England behaves towards a lady?<eos> Towards a whore and you have said yourself that's what you are.<eos> Well, if I am a whore, you will not wish to wed me, will you?<eos> I do not.
There's nothing.<eos> And...<eos> The soldiers who were there, who came there to collect you, they were...<eos> They were told to slaughter any boys they found there.<eos> And did they?
Because if I do not marry him, yet have his child,<eos> I am shamed to everyone, and any other life for me is gone in any case.<eos> The stable boy brought news from home.<eos> Lady Margaret told the soldiers to murder any boy they found there.<eos> And did they?
 What?<eos>  Some guy followed me after I came to the center.<eos> I freaked out.<eos>  I don't know anything about anyone following you.<eos>  Sure you do.
 How?<eos>  My mother just did her thing that she does, her golden handcuffs, just in case I thought I could escape and be my own person.<eos> Nope, she makes it known that I am hers and always will be.<eos>  I don't get it.<eos>  Yeah, you do.
Yours and mine.<eos> No one else's.<eos>  Hey.<eos> I saw Lisa leave.<eos>  She did.
Then, finally, I say, "I want to leave."<eos> And the leader we called him Father.<eos> Father says to me, "You can't leave,<eos> "because even if you do, I'll come to you in your dreams."<eos> And he did.
What hospital do you work at again?<eos> Holy crap!<eos> I knew we were going through changes, but I didn't think...<eos> They were gonna kill my E.R.?<eos> Well, they did.
She keeps putting up this front like she can handle anything in the world.<eos> But I know her and she's scared.<eos> I just with there was something I could do.<eos> It's your mom.<eos> Of course you do.
Well, Amy Brookheimer just hung up on me.<eos> Doesn't get lower than that, does it?<eos> Oh, you are really loving this, aren't you?<eos> Well, I just didn't wanna tell you "I told you so," but...<eos> - Because you didn't.
Yeah, come on.<eos> Help me get him outta here. Hell no.<eos> I ain't touching no dead. That's bad mojo.<eos> Man, I thought you didn't believe in that shit.<eos> I don't. He did.
It feels delicious on your ass.<eos> I mean, we used to sneak out at night and, - oh, for hours we would...<eos> - Bigby, please.<eos> Are you telling me you don't even remember that tree?<eos> Of course I do, darling.
Screw Broussard.<eos> Think he gives a shit about us?<eos> Then where the hell is he?<eos> - You know where.<eos> - No, I don't.
But it's BB.<eos> Badge, please.<eos> Go ahead.<eos> Did you know that LA's Deputy Proxy was coming for a visit?<eos> No, I did not.
I know it's over.<eos> If Homeland catches up to me, I can't run.<eos> And I won't be able to hold out.<eos> You don't know what you're asking.<eos> Yeah, I do.
Your whole cell almost fell apart today.<eos> You need to be there to protect them from themselves.<eos> I never asked for this.<eos> To have my face plastered all over the bloc like some kind of revolutionary.<eos> No, you didn't.
And they're putting it into t-the face creams<eos> - you all use... the girls.<eos> - Hold up.<eos> They do not put foreskins in face creams.<eos> Yes, they do.
I got rid of the body.<eos> I wiped down the whole damn house.<eos> - To prove your loyalty.<eos> - Yes, to prove my loyalty.<eos> And you did.
Why did Nick look like Daddy?<eos> Uh, it's complicated.<eos> Daddy was in trouble, and... we were trying to help.<eos> Why didn't you help him?<eos> - I did.
Uh, it's complicated.<eos> Daddy was in trouble, and... we were trying to help.<eos> Why didn't you help him?<eos> - I did.<eos> - We all did.
I can't be this vulnerable all the time.<eos> I know, I know.<eos> It's exhausting.<eos> You know that saying, "Waiting for the other shoe to drop"?<eos> I do.
Beard.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> - I don't know this guy.<eos> - What?<eos> You don't?
- No, I mean, I don't know him personally.<eos> He's the guy from the park.<eos> Monroe, do you know him or not?<eos> Yes!<eos> We both do!
Hey, Dan, let's try and keep it down in your room.<eos> I'm tired of getting calls, you hear me?<eos> You hear me, Dan?<eos> No more calls.<eos> Hey. You did it again.
Yes, I understand.<eos> Anything else?<eos> - Sounded legit.<eos> - Yup.<eos> It did.
I know it sounds callous, but it's how our community works.<eos> And you know this Gevatter Tod?<eos> No.<eos> Do you know how to make contact?<eos> Yeah, we do.
- Nick!<eos> - Oh, my God.<eos> - Mommy, it worked.<eos> I got Nick back for you.<eos> Yes, you did.
We won't have to.<eos> This thing is gonna find us one way or another.<eos> And when it does I'm gonna kill it.<eos> I don't think it's gonna be that easy.<eos> No, neither do I.
Nick's here.<eos> Oh, God, I'm glad you're back.<eos> It's just awful about Hank and Wu.<eos> - They didn't deserve that.<eos> - None of them did.
I can't.<eos> - You can.<eos> With the Strength of One's Blood.<eos> - We tried that.<eos> - You didn't.
- Can you not wait till morning?<eos> - I want to see her now.<eos> Chastise him for his insolence.<eos> - Show him who's the master here.<eos> - Aye, do!
I might wish the timing were better.<eos> The war's getting deadlier and everything in this world seems less certain... except for you.<eos> - Are you so certain o' me?<eos> - Perhaps I don't deserve to be.<eos> No, you do not!
Ted'n proper.<eos> With a chile to raise an' another on th' way?<eos> A farm t' run an' a mine beside?<eos> How th' menfolk 'ave th' cheek to expect us t' do their bidding'!<eos> Lucky we never do.
Ask him.<eos> I must go.<eos> I do not ask you not to be reckless, for I know you cannot promise something which is so against your nature.<eos> She don't care for me.<eos> She never did.
- Our honeymoon?<eos> I prefer not to speak of such a thing.<eos> All the more to tease me?<eos> I pray you, do not imagine...<eos> But I do, my dear.
Emphasising the excellence of the match.<eos> The goodness and piety of the groom.<eos> I'm sure she'll be delighted.<eos> She would be, if she thought I loved him!<eos> But I do not.
Should you be venturing downstairs, ma'am?<eos> Let me help you back to your room.<eos> What, and have me miss the entertainment?<eos> Were you not instructed to clear the pond, down to the very last specimen?<eos> An' so we did.
I'm no lover of company these days.<eos> With the exception of my wife's.<eos> Sometimes Ross do make no exception.<eos> Well, if I have my way...<eos> Which you frequently do!
Unless, of course, you screw up.<eos> What's the occasion?<eos> I'm just giving back to my staff who has given me so much.<eos> You want your old job back, don't you?<eos> I do.
There's no point in complaining about it.<eos> We signed up for this, and there's no sense in playing the victim.<eos> You go after what you want, and you make no apologies about it.<eos> Do you think I deserve to be chief resident?<eos> Yes, Cassie, I do.
Why not? Put it back exactly where you found it.<eos> Those are sadie's.<eos> Her emergency stash.<eos> My bad. Didn't know.<eos> Well, now you do.
I'll just leave it here.<eos> I was gonna tell him, you know.<eos> I was gonna tell him that he's the one that should be managing partner.<eos> Louis, you may have your flaws, but he had no right to talk to you like that.<eos> Yes, he did.
Harvey, you never miss your flight.<eos> And the last time you said you did, you were lying to me then, too.<eos> - Donna...<eos> - Please tell me you didn't change your mind about seeing her.<eos> I didn't.
- I figure that, because Benjamin updates everybody else's computers remotely, and once a quarter he's down here, pretending not to like my act, so unless you want me to focus my rapier-like wit on you,<eos> I suggest you walk your pretty little self back into your office.<eos> - Benjamin.<eos> I knew it.<eos> - No, you didn't.
that you filed construction plans with the city, claiming that the building was empty, which is punishable under the criminal code.<eos> - No, Mr. Ross, you won't show them anything.<eos> He will.<eos> Did you think I wouldn't check up on you when all of a sudden, a queens legal clinic starts acting like a midtown law form.<eos> Well, I did.
- Where do you think I'm going?<eos> I'm gonna see that asshole and set him straight.<eos> Turkey, no Mayo, extra pickles, like you like it.<eos> - Do you want me to fix Rachel's problem or not?<eos> - I do.
- Oliver...<eos> - Except now you told me i can't handle it, and that's gonna be boring a hole in my brain, making this thing a thousand times harder.<eos> - Well, I can't take back what I said, but what I can do is stay here all night to make sure you prove me wrong.<eos> - I don't know.<eos> - Yes, you do.
- We're going to win this.<eos> - One more time, but this time mean it.<eos> - We are going to win this.<eos> is file a motion to dismiss.<eos> - Actually, they already did.
Do you promise that the testimony you shall give in the case before this court shall be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?<eos> I do.
But you see these edges?<eos> Clearly defined, which usually means it's benign.<eos> Usually.<eos> Many, many people live their whole lives with grapes in their brains, and never even know it.<eos> But now I do.
- How do you know?<eos> - Miranda told me.<eos> She said you're checking to see if there's a match with the mother and father on our database.<eos> When?<eos> - When did she?
We'll do yours and Mary's.<eos> Oh, where I come from, you don't tell anybody your year.<eos> Mummy? You want to have a peek?<eos> No.<eos> I don't.
They think that he's just some kind of dirty old man, and he is not.<eos> He is so much more interested in empowering women than he is in sex.<eos> He's helped a lot of women who don't have anything.<eos> That's good.<eos> How does he do that?
Last three worlds I've been in haven't had any fucking oxygen.<eos> My fingers just--they just-- they just keep shorting me out.<eos> What happened?<eos> Did we kill The Beast?<eos> We did.
You remember Lasaro?<eos> That creep who made the Margolem?<eos> I twisted his arms and/or balls a little, and he gave up the spell.<eos> Living clay is hard to come by, but Fogg left his stash so unprotected, it's like he wanted me to steal it.<eos> So I did.
Wow.<eos> Between this, your nasal passages, the skin tag epidemic and the foot surgeries, you really had a lot of medical procedures.<eos> Tara, I know what you must be thinking and I swear, I will not pass any of my maladies onto our child.<eos> Louis, I wasn't thinking that, but you do understand that biologically this isn't your child.<eos> Of course I do.
Yeah, but you're a bagel guy.<eos> This place is like croissant central.<eos> Then maybe I just came in here hoping to spend some quality time with you.<eos> Are you saying you want to hear about my night with Tara?<eos> Of course I do.
This woman wants to know that she's special to this firm.<eos> If I walk in there by myself, she's gonna laugh me out of the room.<eos> Then why didn't you tell that to Harvey?<eos> Because I know how important Mike is to him and I didn't want to let him down.<eos> - Then don't.
Hey, I'm really young.<eos> And really ambitious.<eos> I'm not saying otherwise, captain, but I can wait.<eos> And I like my life the way it is, you know?<eos> Yeah, I do.
And really ambitious.<eos> I'm not saying otherwise, captain, but I can wait.<eos> And I like my life the way it is, you know?<eos> Yeah, I do.<eos> I really do.
Have you went to see him yet?<eos> Not yet.<eos> I did it with Kadeem.<eos> When you go visit him in prison, all that's gotta be covered up.<eos> He didn't do it.
Better than almost anyone else I know.<eos> Not anymore.<eos> People change.<eos> What?<eos> No, they don't.
I don't know how to do it.<eos> Maybe you're right.<eos> Or maybe you don't deserve it.<eos> Bro.<eos> But a Custer does, right?
All this time?<eos> Probably since Texas, probably since she came back downstairs at the casino.<eos> After all that lying, why in the world would I ever trust you?<eos> I wanted to tell you, mate.<eos> Really I did.
I took him down.<eos> Took him down how, Jesse?<eos> I cut his harness. From the ceiling.<eos> I didn't kill him.<eos> - You didn't?
Why?<eos> What's going on, is she okay?<eos> She's fine, we're just following up on a complaint.<eos> And Quinn told us you saw someone standing across from her apartment in the morning, and then again that same night.<eos> I did.
Hi.<eos> My name is Jimmy Sanguinetti. I'm here to see Erin Lindsay.<eos> Regarding?<eos> Does she know this?<eos> She does.
That picture's taken right before you chased her in the woods where she was killed.<eos> Come on, man.<eos> Why is that funny?<eos> 'Cause... 'cause you think you know what went down.<eos> - And you don't.
Not here.<eos> Forget it.<eos> You're a waste of time.<eos> Look, look, I want you so bad.<eos> I really do.
- I'm sorry.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> You ever find anyone to claim Sam?<eos> No, I didn't.<eos> So I did.
Your campaign against Holland, Sire, is just, but it is your moral conduct that stirs God to act.<eos> Your Church and your God cannot condone a double adultery.<eos> Your continued relations with a married woman are incurring a debt, and the reckoning is not yet paid.<eos> I do not respond well to threats, Bishop.<eos> Neither does the Almighty.
and there it sat for five hours until it died.<eos> Keith London's phone went east also along the rail line until it died.<eos> But then Curry turns up back here.<eos> No, he never left.<eos> His phone did.
It's at the high end of standard.<eos> So, it would've cost us slightly less if we'd have just...<eos> Paid the troll?<eos> Well, that's true, but can you put a price on dignity?<eos> Apparently, I just did.
Tate, we keep having the same argument.<eos> We won't. Not anymore.<eos> I mean it.<eos> Look. I am the way I am. If I don't make you happy...<eos> You do, april.
You been binging on "dr.<eos> Quinn, medicine woman" again?<eos> I'm just saying, things were different.<eos> Like, guys didn't need to tell women every single thing. They were feeling.<eos> My father never did.
Like my mom.<eos> Right.<eos> So if you only have one chance, Wouldn't you want to fight like crazy.<eos> To keep going for as long as you can?<eos> I did, but...
No surprises.<eos> Ready to put today behind me... no pun intended.<eos> Nick, when I was examining your abdomen,<eos> You thought you felt something.<eos> You didn't, did you?
The funny thing about feelings:<eos> You know, we think that if we push them down hard enough, that they'll disappear.<eos> Never quite works out that way.<eos> I could've killed him.<eos> Yeah, well, you didn't.
- Someone other than Fitz?<eos> Oh, well, of course, Fitz, but he has been rather distracted lately.<eos> - Distracted how?<eos> - Aida. You know how boys can be with their robots.<eos> Actually, I really don't.
- I knew the dangers and ...<eos> - And you thought I was one of them.<eos> You didn't want that technology to fall under the control<eos> - of a Director you didn't know.<eos> - No, I did not.
Every molecular detail the same, just... with a little less hurt for each of us.<eos> What do you mean, "hurt"?<eos> Imagine if your greatest regret could be wiped away.<eos> Do you know what that would be?<eos> I do.
Oh, Aida, that doesn't matter.<eos> Reality is just perception.<eos> They perceive it as real, which makes it real.<eos> They might not believe that.<eos> Yeah, but I do.
That's where I programmed the backdoor to get out.<eos> Reality is just perception.<eos> They perceive it as real, which makes it real.<eos> They might not believe that.<eos> Yeah, but I do.
- No!<eos> - No!<eos> Ward, I have nothing to do with the Resistance!<eos> Over here! Unh!<eos> Well, I do.
We have to get somewhere safe.<eos> Ladies.<eos> Is she your source in the Resistance?<eos> Ward, I have nothing to do with the Resistance!<eos> Well, I do.
No matter.<eos> We've got plenty of ways of making you talk.<eos> No, Fitz.<eos> You don't want to do this.<eos> Yeah, I do.
Yes, Father?<eos> Listen to me very carefully, son.<eos> You know I've always loved you.<eos> Only ever wanted what was best for you.<eos> Yeah, of course I do.
I understand you better now.<eos> How deeply you love.<eos> You do understand me, don't you?<eos> Yes, Leopold.<eos> Now I do.
You don't understand, do you?<eos> Even if you defeat this body, I will build more.<eos> You cannot stop me.<eos> Never say, "You can't stop me,"<eos> 'cause the minute you do...
And you didn't ask why?<eos> Of course I asked.<eos> He said he needed... he needed to cause a distraction, that night, in that area.<eos> I didn't know anyone was going to be killed.<eos> I didn't.
It means his freedom.<eos> Something happened, and it means his freedom.<eos> He called you, I know, from this place on this night.<eos> You've already broken the rules.<eos> No, I didn't, Tom.
And that's where I'm gonna send you.<eos> I told you I did it before.<eos> Go ahead, Preacher.<eos> Send me to Hell... along with your filthy stinkin' soul.<eos> Do it!
Is that your guitar?<eos> Yeah.<eos> - You play it?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Of course you do.
But you don't know that, Moira, okay?<eos> You don't know that.<eos> It could happen.<eos> Okay, all right, um...<eos> If it does...
No worries.<eos> He probably just wants a blowjob.<eos> What did he say?<eos> When he asked to see you alone?<eos> He didn't.
- Do you want to play?<eos> - Love to.<eos> But I have work to do.<eos> - And, in any case, you know the law.<eos> - Yes, I do.
Hi.<eos> Ofdaniel has been convicted of endangering a child.<eos> The punishment for that crime is death by stoning.<eos> I know how difficult this is, girls.<eos> I do.
Because if he didn't know, it's just bad luck. Harvey, he's the goddamn CEO.<eos> He knew.<eos> He kept it from us, and he kept it from the guys buying his company.<eos> - You don't know that.<eos> - Yes, I do.
And more importantly, why'd you need the sale to go through so quickly?<eos> I told you, I have another opportunity.<eos> And what if I said the real reason was you knew you vodka business was about to be sued for using another brand's recipe?<eos> I would say I did not know that.<eos> - Well, now you do.
I don't know what to tell you, Tulip.<eos> Where are you going?<eos> I'm gonna go talk to a man about the end of the world.<eos> You want to come?<eos> 'Course you don't.
The most able.<eos> And yet, only one of you will prove worthy enough to join our ranks.<eos> But before we begin, are there any questions?<eos> Do you validate parking?<eos> No, we do not.
Belushi.<eos> You name it.<eos> You... will be my right-hand man.<eos> The Grail killed Abraham Lincoln?<eos> Mm. Yes, we did.
No, Harvey, there's got to be someone else.<eos> Vanessa doesn't do this kind of thing and you know it.<eos> I swore that I would never do business with that son of a bitch again.<eos> I know that, Louis.<eos> But if we don't do this...
It's a letter from Allen Fields.<eos> Shit.<eos> He's putting us in review based on our recent affiliations.<eos> - You know what that means.<eos> - Yeah, I sure as hell do.
I'll write you a check for ten million right here.<eos> Ten million?<eos> The hell are you talking about?<eos> You told them you'd get them a hundred, didn't you?<eos> Yeah, you did.
Yesterday, she asked me what I was having a bad day about.<eos> And the truth is, it was pretty much about Mike.<eos> And I want to tell her about it, but...<eos> You don't know how she'll react.<eos> No, I don't.
You're right.<eos> I bought them to say thank you for doing whatever it took to make sure I got my shot at getting into the Bar.<eos> Wait, does that mean that...<eos> Yeah.<eos> We did it.
I'm fine, Donna.<eos> What can I do for you?<eos> I know you know Benjamin and I have been working on a business.<eos> But I'm not sure that you know that we brought on Stu as an investor.<eos> - I didn't, Donna;
Now...<eos> Mr. Chairman, if I may.<eos> Last winter, Mr. Ross pled guilty to defrauding the citizens of New York.<eos> Therefore, I propose we reject his application right now because Mr. Ross is a felon and the New York Bar does not accept felons.<eos> Mr. Chairman, with all due respect to the new board member, you do.
See, right there, Mike, that sounds like the bullshit artist I met in prison.<eos> So you tell me right now.<eos> Did you pull some shit to make this happen?<eos> Damn, Mike, if you can't be straight with me, this conversation ends right here.<eos> Yes, I did.
He didn't roll over, Donna.<eos> I went over it with Benjamin, and we can't get the overlap under 30%.<eos> I also ran it by my own attorney and he was shocked at what Louis was able to get us.<eos> So you're telling me you want to take it?<eos> We do.
She always has. No, Harvey.<eos> She wants both of us.<eos> And she's not going to stop until she gets both of us.<eos> - You don't know that.<eos> - Yes, I do.
The timing device.<eos> That was his invention.<eos> - You bloody coward.<eos> - You tried to kill me.<eos> No, I didn't.
That bridge is fifty feet high.<eos> The water was shallow.<eos> There were rocks.<eos> I barely survived the jump myself.<eos> Yes, but you did.
He said we were playing hide and seek.<eos> Did he say who you were hiding from?<eos> You.<eos> But you found me.<eos> Yes, yes I did.
You!<eos> You can reveal it to us.<eos> You were meant to show us the way.<eos> - I don't know how.<eos> - Yes, you do.
A society that has reduced its carbon emissions by 78% in three years?<eos> A society in which women can no longer read your book.<eos> Or anything else.<eos> No.<eos> I didn't.
Find Rachel at the bar.<eos> Wait.<eos> How do they know I was there?<eos> I don't know.<eos> They just do.
And you lied to me.<eos> It's over for you, Tony.<eos> After all we'd been through, she should have stuck by me.<eos> - Must have stung a bit, though.<eos> - Yes, it did.
There's Julie Matlock, demanding editor, fiercely-protective mother, domineering wife.<eos> And there was also Nadine Hunter, charismatic but haunted woman, born under an unlucky star.<eos> Depression, alcoholism, a college sweetheart buried in the past.<eos> And then, to cap it all off, she's convicted for a murder she did not commit.<eos> - Did not?
Well, you know, JP, it might not be a bad thing.<eos> What?<eos> Look...<eos> It's not that I don't like Catherine.<eos> Of course I do.
But we thought we'd come to you first, Peter.<eos> Look, if it helps to jog your memory, we could show you some CCTV footage.<eos> Or maybe you recall Victor Pearce calling you about the very same thing?<eos> - You know about that?<eos> - We do, yes.
- But it has to have been one of them.<eos> - Yes, it did.<eos> - Sir? - Mm?<eos> The church service, we said we'd go.<eos> Oh, yes, so we did, yeah.
- Yeah.<eos> Straight up.<eos> Cool.<eos> Do you like Reese's Peanut Butter Cups?<eos> Yeah. I do.
Yeah, it's six hours later here.<eos> I know. Weird, right?<eos> You haven't been photographed since you were 19 years old.<eos> I was.<eos> I did, yeah.
We reduce his edge.<eos> Is this, um... is this last night's or this morning's?<eos> What if I don't want to answer?<eos> Well, maybe shower before heading to the office.<eos> I already did.
So no parade down main street in my honour then?<eos> I'd settle for a smoothie and one sad stripper.<eos> Look, the town needed a plausible, nonsupernatural explanation for what happened.<eos> - And they already hate you, so.<eos> - They really do.
He's what Black Badge made him.<eos> Though they lied to him about that, too.<eos> That's why I was in Purgatory.<eos> I was trying to help him find out what he... we are.<eos> What they did to us.
Now you're sober, you can tell us more.<eos> I... I swear, I didn't do it.<eos> You took her to the drugs unit in Homerton hospital.<eos> - Who told you that?<eos> You did, you moron.
I'd never hurt her.<eos> But you were her boyfriend and you never came forward.<eos> David, I know about you and Julie-Ann.<eos> No.<eos> No, you don't.
Well, you have arrived just in time.<eos> I know you've seen many unusual things.<eos> - Yes, we have.<eos> - And you must have many questions.<eos> - Yes, we do.
I lost my husband to the Lachrymose Leeches.<eos> Good heavens!<eos> I had absolutely no idea.<eos> I swear.<eos> None of us did.
Rip.<eos> Rip, it's Sara.<eos> Come on, it's Sara.<eos> You say her name as if she's supposed to matter to me.<eos> She doesn't.
It's not a bad idea at all.<eos> Run!<eos> What happened?<eos> She may have picked up my scent!<eos> Yep, she definitely did.
Sit down, Professor.<eos> His heart is beating way too fast.<eos> I said sit.<eos> I know you think I'm overreacting...<eos> No, I don't.
Well, this group speaks very highly of you too.<eos> Nice to meet you, Rip.<eos> For real this time.<eos> Well, everyone is being very uncharacteristically pleasant, but we're all hoping you know where the final piece of the Spear of Destiny is.<eos> I do.
I was going to tell you.<eos> I told him to tell you last night.<eos> I told you both weeks ago.<eos> - You all knew?<eos> - Um, I didn't.
- What are you looking at?<eos> - What?<eos> - All right. Hey! - Whoa, whoa!<eos> - Holster your sidearms!<eos> - Yes, do that, please.
- Drinks for you guys? Awesome.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Hey, do you play pool?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - No, you don't.
But the second part about us not being a match...<eos> I didn't mean that.<eos> No, you're good. You are good.<eos> Well, you got rid of Mxy...<eos> I did.
- Boo! - I know, I know.<eos> Speaking of which, um, can we just keep this quiet?<eos> What you...<eos> -You don't want people to know?<eos> -No, no, I do.
Yes, sir.<eos> I hope one day we get him back.<eos> We will.<eos> Did you get your job back?<eos> - Yeah, I did.
Because they are, like, the best in the city.<eos> I gotta say.<eos> Yeah, they are the best in the city.<eos> You know that because I told you about this falafel stand.<eos> Oh, yes. Yes, you did.
Turn it off!<eos> I can't.<eos> Why won't it turn off?<eos> I don't know, she must've made it self-sustaining somehow.<eos> What did you do, Mother?
Faster than a speeding bullet.<eos> Okay.<eos> Is this going to work?<eos> - Most likely.<eos> - And if it doesn't?
I thought that we'd never be able to come home again.<eos> Now, look.<eos> We got a fresh start, Ray.<eos> I told you everything would work out, didn't I?<eos> Yeah, you did.
And they die.<eos> Better not to be born at all.<eos> We should kill them, so they don't suffer.<eos> And this?<eos> Who did this to you?
Well, she wasn't a good teacher,<eos> She wasn't qualified for the job.<eos> She didn't even teach them how to use latrines<eos> Their uncle chose her, and he feels very guilty for the mistake.<eos> But he did right with you.
You never tally your sheet until the lockup period is over, but even I have to admit it does feel great.<eos> You did a good thing here, son.<eos> You absolutely did.<eos> I hope that's true, Dad.<eos> I really do.
He was a mathematician at an aerospace company.<eos> His division and his job went away, and it never came back.<eos> I imagine that affected the homelife.<eos> Yeah.<eos> It did.
For you.<eos> That is something you, you learn very early on, not to ah, judge by volume.<eos> That... that could be a laptop, or maybe it's just a blender.<eos> Yeah, oh it's funny, you know, people, they ask me that all the time.<eos> They do.
And you even said so yourself, Ken, that you have an awfully big mouth.<eos> I...<eos> I lost a dear friend.<eos> I loved Tim.<eos> Everybody did.
-It's serving him in the polls.<eos> -Donald.<eos> Let's... take a step back for a moment.<eos> I underestimated you.<eos> I did.
Peter did very well.<eos> Oh, it was such a shame to have missed that.<eos> We had the slowest journey up. Stopping at all the churches.<eos> Chokey loves an old church, don't you, darling?<eos> Oh, I sure do.
You white folk despise the coloured man.<eos> You think he doesn't have a soul.<eos> Not at all.<eos> But don't the coloured man breathe the air same as you?<eos> - He do.
It's exculpatory evidence and it was suppressed by AUSA Valdes.<eos> AUSA Valdes, please approach the bench.<eos> Is this true?<eos> Did you have knowledge of this incident?<eos> I did, Your Honor.
A crime scene.<eos> It's terrible, isn't it?<eos> She was her best friend, has she told you?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, she did.
Helen Weeks?<eos> It's me!<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> Don't tell me you don't remember?<eos> No, of course I do.
So, what are you saying, you think Poppy's still alive?<eos> I think she might be, yeah.<eos> I think it's possible.<eos> You don't believe her, do you?<eos> No. I don't.
Tell me it's not his.<eos> Helen, tell me.<eos> I don't know.<eos> Oh, shit!<eos> I really don't.
Well, actually, because I felt like it.<eos> - What if I steal it from you?<eos> - On you go, then.<eos> I don't know how it works.<eos> Well, neither did I.
To modernize.<eos> To put this old horse out to pasture.<eos> Yeah, well, I'm sorry about Phil, but this place doesn't fucking run without you.<eos> I do need you. Especially since I just let Steph Reed go.<eos> You did?
But he hasn't written back.<eos> He's at an officer's camp.<eos> He's treated fairly.<eos> Have you actually seen him?<eos> I did, ernst.
Be my partner.<eos> In life, in love, in endless scientific pursuit.<eos> Let's build a beautiful bohemian existence together.<eos> I don't know what that means.<eos> You do.
Why?<eos> Well, scientists think that light travels through its own special, invisible medium.<eos> They call it the ether.<eos> Yeah, but if it's invisible, - then how do we know it's there?<eos> - We don't.
No, because in my heart, the two of us are one.<eos> It's our name.<eos> Einstein, 'one stone.' this paper, every paper, it's both of us.<eos> I couldn't do any of it without you. You know that.<eos> No one else does.
Shh. Oh, God.<eos> I got to go to work.<eos> Hey, you can do this.<eos> - Shh. - I have faith.<eos> At least one of us does.
She really is, even in my belly.<eos> I don't know if I've ever loved anyone like that before.<eos> But you must know what I mean.<eos> Sure.<eos> Yeah, of course I do.
- Are you ex-police?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Ah. - 26 years. Avon and Somerset.<eos> But you don't get used to that, do you?<eos> No. No, you don't.
We've been trying for three years.<eos> Well, thanks for your time, Mr Holland.<eos> Writing a book about something that happened 40 years ago.<eos> That doesn't sound like the Jamie Marshall we've been getting to know, does it?<eos> No, it doesn't.
I'm sure there were a lot of guests at the party who don't show up in random photos taken between those times.<eos> Mm.<eos> Did you see your son while you were up there?<eos> He was running nearby.<eos> No, I didn't.
Doesn't seem like the kind of person who'd chuck a rock through somebody's window.<eos> Clearly has an alibi, even with the time change.<eos> But she seems more interested in lawsuits and insurance.<eos> Maybe something's being covered up here.<eos> Something to do with that building.
So we punch in nice and tight right there, and...<eos> Oh, now what do we see there on the gun barrel?<eos> I don't see anything.<eos> No.<eos> You don't.
Because she's slippery.<eos> I was in East Anglia today and I went past the place where... .. where my unravelling started.<eos> That's hard to remember.<eos> Like it never happened.<eos> But it did, didn't it?
You're right.<eos> It's not his fault.<eos> I told Kevin I believed he didn't do it.<eos> And I said I'd prove it.<eos> And I didn't.
You've bloody won!<eos> Thank you, mate.<eos> This is incredible.<eos> I told you it would happen, didn't I?<eos> You did.
No, I think I'll scorch this motherfucker myself.<eos> Tommy, I have to figure out what Markham was gonna do with the recording.<eos> Just destroying his laptop won't confirm that there was only one copy.<eos> All right.<eos> You better do it.
Tommy's my friend.<eos> I was in negotiations with the Bassett Hotel Group at the time.<eos> I'd invested all of my liquid money with them, so I needed the immediate cash.<eos> I'm sure that put your family in a pretty tough spot.<eos> It did.
Now, switch clothes with him.<eos> How'd it go in court?<eos> Not well.<eos> I thought you were going to your bosses with the information you got.<eos> I did.
And how did Mr. Sandoval respond?<eos> That he wasn't going to turn the tapes over to you because it shone a bad light on the prosecution.<eos> I also reported doubts about Mr. St. Patrick's guilt to John Mak, who, in turn, ensured that I was formally kept out of strategy on the case.<eos> Do you now believe that my client is innocent of killing Agent Knox?<eos> Yes, I do.
Open wide.<eos> So Mitch went to jail, and you and Topher struck it rich.<eos> What then? I couldn't understand why I wasn't happy, so I spent my money.<eos> Hoping things, material possessions, hallucinogenics, would bring me peace.<eos> They didn't.
And?<eos> And...<eos> Did any of them have brains in their digestive systems?<eos> No.<eos> No, they didn't.
We are expanding our reach.<eos> We'd like to see if you can run both coasts.<eos> But Ghost can't be anywhere near it.<eos> Do we understand each other?<eos> Yeah, we do.
Yes, they dismissed the charges against James, but there's no guarantee they won't try again.<eos> He's already made up his mind.<eos> I can't stop him.<eos> - I don't have to do it, though.<eos> Actually, you do.
Can I get you anything to drink or...<eos> No, no, I'm good.<eos> I couldn't stop thinking about what you said, Angela.<eos> Did you know that Saxe was in the MCC when Lobos' would-be hitter was shanked?<eos> No, I didn't.
Just came by to check in.<eos> I feel like you and I need to talk.<eos> Sure.<eos> What'd you want to talk about?<eos> You sure you don't any?
How many of y'all took the stands at your all's trials?<eos> Raise your hand.<eos> Wow!<eos> Ain't that some bull?<eos> Well, neither did I.
Yeah.<eos> No. No, I wouldn't do that.<eos> Mine is gonna be so much better.<eos> How she even get pregnant?<eos> She didn't.
Yeah, well, change is very important, actually.<eos> When my mom would, uh, catch my dad cheating, she would just... get a new hairdo, wax the bush, try some new eye shadow.<eos> Whatever. - Yeah. And that worked for her?<eos> - Well, no.<eos> But fucking his brother did.
- Oh, God.<eos> Not now. Not now.<eos> Anybody else got somethin' they want to say?<eos> - You want some, too?<eos> - No. No, I don't.
I'm her mother!<eos> Daya, it's me!<eos> Don't tell them anything!<eos> You got rights!<eos> - Does she?
- Suzanne.<eos> Suzanne!<eos> It's time for your medicine.<eos> - I don't take medicine now.<eos> - Yes, you do.
Are you talking about my trying-to-help-you thing?<eos> Or are you talking about my speaking-in-general thing?<eos> Why can't you just say you want to see what's going on?<eos> Fine.<eos> I do.
She cut a hole in the fence.<eos> Are you saying the hostages weren't released as a result of negotiations?<eos> Negotiations?<eos> No, no, no, no, no.<eos> I did it for the deal.
If her symptoms improve, then we'll treat the adults.<eos> Thank you.<eos> His father got floated for stealing medicine to save him.<eos> Who knew he had it in him?<eos> I did.
Good morning, America.<eos> God bless America, and thank you.<eos> And we're out.<eos> Okay, guys.<eos> You did great.
God bless America, and thank you.<eos> And we're out.<eos> Okay, guys.<eos> You did great.<eos> - You did it.
Babies ripped from mothers' arms.<eos> Slaughtered.<eos> My God.<eos> So, of course, they fled.<eos> As our ancestors did from Egypt.
Then when you are feeling better... you can come to America and live with me.<eos> I should have been better to you, I know that now.<eos> I am much better at theory than practice.<eos> I do hope you know, though... hope you've always known... how so very loved you are.<eos> Perhaps you didn't.
Uh...<eos> What the fuck kind of friend are you? !<eos> - I don't love him!<eos> - Oh, my God.<eos> Of course you don't.
No!<eos> - Come on.<eos> - I'm not gonna fight you!<eos> Fight her!<eos> Do it!
Science must never be used for violence.<eos> Do you think Adolph Hitler shares your moral reservations?<eos> You must contact Roosevelt. He will listen to you.<eos> That's the trouble, Leo.<eos> What if he does?
The fetus' élan vital is... entangled with your soul.<eos> I mean, I have read about this, but I've... I've never seen it in person.<eos> You will need to find a Mudang.<eos> It's their area.<eos> Yeah, we did.
'Cause that doesn't feel right either.<eos> I don't know what's right.<eos> My best friend in the world does crazy shit and doesn't trust me and doesn't listen to me.<eos> It is not that simple, and you know it.<eos> I don't...
I can help you track down a number for his parents.<eos> They're overseas.<eos> How'd you know it was a gang?<eos> Those guys have a look, you know?<eos> No. I don't.
Well, I'll be in there with you.<eos> He's no problem.<eos> Yeah, yeah, I still think I'll just observe from here.<eos> Okay.<eos> Well, I did a psych rotation in residency.
Be in touch when you find the lab.<eos> I will.<eos> You stay safe, too.<eos> Have a seat.<eos> What did I do now?
Listen to High King Bambi.<eos> You're alive.<eos> Nice of you to join us, asshole.<eos> Really does sound like you got it all handled.<eos> I do.
Obergruppenfuhrer.<eos> I have the rsd for protection.<eos> The fuhrer's guard doesn't normally take assignments.<eos> Outside of his protection.<eos> They do for an operation.
-Tara, please.<eos> Get your stuff out of our house.<eos> I want to sleep there tonight.<eos> -Where'd you sleep last night?<eos> -I didn't.
But we all have different ways of getting our kicks.<eos> He's my husband.<eos> But I don't own him.<eos> Do you want to talk to him or will I?<eos> I already did.
Offer her a partnership.<eos> I don't care what.<eos> But I do care about having to uninvite half of Dublin's biggest hitters and of looking as big a fool as you already do.<eos> Do you understand?<eos> I do.
This is real, Vincent.<eos> This is my life.<eos> Ray.<eos> I understand.<eos> No, you don't.
You need to tell me the truth.<eos> Why?<eos> Ada didn't.<eos> No, she did, because Sean was trying to sell the fireplace.<eos> Yeah, but he didn't.
PETE: Rafferty Towers.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Hey.<eos> How much did you say the rent would be here?<eos> I didn't.
Yeah.<eos> Cheers.<eos> Social services don't just take away people's children for no reason.<eos> Don't they?<eos> No, they don't.
Wow. Okay.<eos> Thank you so much, Meg.<eos> You know what to do.<eos> Yeah, yeah.<eos> I do.
They're barbarians.<eos> I am so sorry, Lizzie, for your plight.<eos> Oh, you are so beautiful.<eos> You had such promise.<eos> And I still do.
It is not at our hand.<eos> It works to our advantage. Surely you can see that, Lizzie?<eos> Did you write to Francis Lovell?<eos> Order him to kill the king?<eos> Of course I did. I...
Because he will not give up the crown while he is breathing.<eos> Even if he wanted to, his mother would not let him.<eos> You have changed your tune.<eos> I thought you wanted him as dead as I do.<eos> Of course I did.
Even if he wanted to, his mother would not let him.<eos> You have changed your tune.<eos> I thought you wanted him as dead as I do.<eos> Of course I did.<eos> I do.
Nobody.<eos> It's a thing that happened, not something anyone did.<eos> That is the kind of thing I'd say.<eos> You vetted the info yourself.<eos> I did.
I'm going fast and I'm relaxing.<eos> What's wrong with that?<eos> But the futuristic four-wheel drive isn't the only piece of 23rd-century engineering on the NSX.<eos> The aerodynamics, for example, are so clever, they can cool all the motors while providing vast amounts of grip-enhancing downforce to the front and rear wheels.<eos> And it does all this without anything as old-fashioned as huge wings and spoilers.
And let me guess.<eos> You have a solution.<eos> - Yes, I do.<eos> - God.<eos> Yes, I do.
- He did.<eos> He said, "Smell my jacket." I said, "Why?"<eos> He said, "Because it smells of old record players."<eos> - Mate, that is weird.<eos> - But it did!
Imagine fighting someone with half a brain.<eos> This imbecile wasn't even in the room when you took him down, so you should ask yourselves,<eos> I have a notoriously high center of gravity.<eos> It's true.<eos> He does.
I cannot bug anyone who can knock me unconscious.<eos> So that leaves you.<eos> You forgot five.<eos> Nope.<eos> I didn't.
L'un des flux antimatière transducteur a été compromis par une déficience dans l'un des accélérateurs de particules.<eos> What did you say?<eos> L'un des flux antimatière transducteur a été compromis par une déficience dans l'un des accélérateurs de particules.<eos> He said one of the antimatter transducer feeds has been compromised by an impairment in one of the particle accelerators.<eos> I did.
- San?<eos> - That isn't my name.<eos> What have you done to my android?<eos> She isn't your android. She doesn't belong to you anymore.<eos> The hell she doesn't.
What say you, Teku?<eos> You are most generous, Heika.<eos> But, in order to receive these gifts, you must publicly recant.<eos> Do you renounce your actions against the throne?<eos> No, I do not.
We were just in the Pollux system.<eos> [THE ANDROID] That's correct.<eos> So we just traveled half a lightyear?<eos> That still doesn't explain why the stars are out of position.<eos> [THE ANDROID] Maybe it does.
[Teku] This is what you get when you try to rule through fear alone.<eos> Discontent is growing.<eos> Teku is overreacting.<eos> You don't see it because you don't venture beyond these walls.<eos> I do.
It's, like, o-Oslo syndrome, or something like that.<eos> Just stop it.<eos> Did you really think you had a shot with me?<eos> I... I didn't...<eos> I... Of course you did.
I'm hoping we can talk.<eos> I can leave, but you know I'll be back.<eos> Now that we know you're here, we will find you... Eventually.<eos> I know you.<eos> Yes, you do.
My family's at the mall.<eos> I've gotta get to them.<eos> What if it doesn't have any keys?<eos> - I'll bet Mia knows how to hotwire.<eos> - Of course I do.
You'd do the same.<eos> You have the only working car.<eos> You're my only chance.<eos> - You understand that?<eos> - Yes, I do.
Yes.<eos> Let me finally be a mother to you now.<eos> Let me help you die.<eos> I don't want to die.<eos> I don't.
Let me finally be a mother to you now.<eos> Let me help you die.<eos> I don't want to die.<eos> I don't.<eos> Oh, baby doll, yes, you do.
I know exactly where we are.<eos> Oh, not exactly. "Approximately."<eos> But I know where we're going.<eos> You said you knew a shortcut through the wall.<eos> I did, yeah.
My dad works. But we do other fun stuff.<eos> Oh, I don't doubt it.<eos> Butkiss was a fun guy.<eos> - You know my dad?<eos> - I do.
Oh, I don't doubt it.<eos> Butkiss was a fun guy.<eos> - You know my dad?<eos> - I do.<eos> Well, I did.
Fucking wisdom, fucking Light, your fucking leader fuck all of you.<eos>  If you need to release, fine.<eos> Just release it to me.<eos>  ho, you you have no idea what I have to release, what I have to say.<eos>  I don't, but
 He was already dead!<eos> The moment he had cancer, it told you.<eos> It told all of us that he was a man.<eos> Just a man!<eos> I didn't do that.
I know, right?<eos> I feel great.<eos> No, dude, you're on fire!<eos> - It doesn't exist.<eos> - Yes, it does.
I feel great.<eos> No, dude, you're on fire!<eos> - It doesn't exist.<eos> - Yes, it does.<eos> - No, it doesn't.
I didn't bring you out here.<eos> The clue in the ledger brought you out here.<eos> No, you did.<eos> Charlene didn't know the name of the Alaskan town I lived in as a kid.<eos> You did.
What is it, then?<eos> We haven't had a proper kill in quite a while.<eos> I'm going to really enjoy this.<eos> Please tell me you have a plan.<eos> Yes, I do.
Everything to gain by converting you to his cause.<eos> That's my argument, you know.<eos> All right, fine, it makes no sense that it's a trap, which is exactly why it has to be one.<eos> You're going to accept.<eos> I already did an hour ago.
He won't speak to you, Sadavir.<eos> Chrisjen, this may be our only chance to stay in the game.<eos> They're already making weapons. - They're testing them...<eos> - You honestly believe that Mars would use this protomolecule to destroy Earth?<eos> Yes, I do.
Even more reason to kill it now.<eos> I guess you got your wish.<eos> Mars is in the protomolecule business now, just like everyone else.<eos> You know we don't know that for sure.<eos> Yeah. We do.
Would you like me to go have a talk with Ralphie and ask him if it's okay if you could have a bath?<eos> I don't think that's a good idea.<eos> Why not?<eos> Because he doesn't like girls.<eos> - He doesn't?
Sex.<eos> Where did you hear that word?<eos> My dad.<eos> I think it's something that you should talk to your dad about.<eos> I already did.
You know yourself better.<eos> And your feelings are a lifeline connecting you back to that place, screaming at you from your core, "Don't forget me."<eos> Don't forget.<eos> I don't like to lie."<eos> I don't.
And... you'll get the governor's mansion for your efforts.<eos> And Connerty's started.<eos> You got one of those Cheroots?<eos> Fundadores.<eos> Yes, I do.
People are telling me I can't miss your party.<eos> No, because those people think the only way to advance is by following the rules and social mores.<eos> They have no fucking idea why we do what we do.<eos> I don't think I'm any better than them.<eos> Of course you do.
Sure.<eos> What is it?<eos> Why are you just in the neighborhood?<eos> Do you ever feel alone, a little scared sometimes?<eos> I do, but you don't.
And then I learned something that I knew would hurt her.<eos> And I just couldn't resist punching her in the face with it.<eos> It's a natural urge.<eos> But it didn't make you feel good.<eos> No, it did.
Do you have any memory of that moment?<eos> Any details, any specifics?<eos> You know, during my first win for Congress, he was cheating on me during the entire campaign and said it was my fault.<eos> - I didn't know that.<eos> Okay. - Yeah, absolutely he did.
'Cause I don't wanna do this again.<eos> - Gonna snap some for you right now.<eos> - Get a picture of this.<eos> It's very sweet and thoughtful of you.<eos> - Oop, I did a selfie.
You loved me.<eos> - Stop it!<eos> - You still love me now.<eos> - What?<eos> ! - You do!
- I understand.<eos> You know what, I saw that Tom James being interviewed on the television about the two of you.<eos> - Oh, good.<eos> You saw that?<eos> - Yeah, I did.
- I came as soon as I heard Hawk was in trouble.<eos> - Why didn't you call me?<eos> - Look, I am so scared.<eos> I've called Libby DeKaan a thousand times, and I'm really afraid I messed up.<eos> - No, no, no, no, you did not.
- And you think all this shit wasn't happening in the '70s?<eos> White man who wrote your book left it all out, didn't he?<eos> - No.<eos> Doc acknowledged that we were destroying ourselves with violence and pollution.<eos> He didn't, but the...
- You mean you'd like to convert?<eos> I'm sorry to interrupt, but we should go.<eos> I have essays to write.<eos> - Converting would suggest that I already follow a religion.<eos> - You do.
You saw Geoff at the cricket.<eos> He's hardly Zafar's biggest fan.<eos> I doubt he'd welcome his daughter seeing him.<eos> You knew?<eos> Of course I did.
- You know?<eos> How it looks.<eos> What it means.<eos> - It shouldn't matter, but...<eos> - But it... does.
I need a nap.<eos> After I dance is when we usually lose most of the class.<eos> Now, before I teach you the actual moves, I want you to just feel your body and let it go.<eos> Who wants to give it a shot?<eos> Oh, I do!
Did I do that?<eos> Did I do that?<eos> And tease.<eos> And tease.<eos> I did do that.
You lying to me now?<eos> Ma...<eos> I was with Caroline last night.<eos> But I didn't see him naked.<eos> I did.
Whoa, Ma, I... I only got engaged to be engaged 'cause Dad was sick, and I wanted you to be happy.<eos> But now I'm with Caroline, and...<eos> Caroline makes me happy.<eos> - I do?<eos> - She does?
But now I'm with Caroline, and...<eos> Caroline makes me happy.<eos> - I do?<eos> - She does?<eos> You do.
Caroline makes me happy.<eos> - I do?<eos> - She does?<eos> You do.<eos> She does.
Fine, Caroline, I'm just gonna come out and say it.<eos> I like to bowl.<eos> And you're sure you don't wanna go with the dead people thing?<eos> But bowling's just a hobby, right?<eos> Something you only do...
Two more pins and we're going to Detroit.<eos> Waiting for my ball to drop.<eos> Story of my life.<eos> This guy knows what I'm talking about.<eos> No, I don't.
Just awful.<eos> Bad people, bad, bad people hurting the very thing that gives us life.<eos> And now Mother Nature has had enough.<eos> I don't know what to do.<eos> Yes, you do.
You just need to open your eyes.<eos> Tell me how to open them.<eos> Feel your purpose.<eos> - I don't know what my purpose is.<eos> - Yes, you do.
I bet you haven't even cried.<eos> Your mother had the biggest heart you could ever imagine.<eos> I've cried every day.<eos> You don't know how to do that.<eos> Of course I do.
She loved me!<eos> No one could love you, not the real you!<eos> Alex loves me.<eos> Until she finds someone that could fuck her!<eos> I did!
We have to warn the others!<eos> Off the hour. It's a warning.<eos> The germans must already be there.<eos> They were supposed to come by train.<eos> They didn't.
'Cause it looks to me like you freakin' chicken doinkers...<eos> Mega freaking chicken doinkers!<eos> Were trying to dominate those three young girls, and that does bother me.<eos> Did you not see us?<eos> Because we definitely did, fair and square.
You want me to give you a hickey, don't you?<eos> No, I don't, but thank you for offering.<eos> You're a sweet man.<eos> He wants me to give him a hickey.<eos> - He doesn't.
No, I don't, but thank you for offering.<eos> You're a sweet man.<eos> He wants me to give him a hickey.<eos> - He doesn't.<eos> - I don't.
It's rad, I swear.<eos> If this is being a zombie, then bring it on!<eos> This is torture and I'm not even enjoying it.<eos> Tell me again how we know the peeping tom had a criminal record?<eos> We don't.
Yes, I'll try.<eos> No, I understand your concern, Senator.<eos> Student loan reform is a priority for you, so it will be a priority for the president and me.<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, I do.
Get me the vice president on the phone.<eos> That is not going to help.<eos> Well, how do you intend on dealing with it?<eos> Donald.<eos> -Don't do it.
- Where has she gone?<eos> Nowhere.<eos> She's dead.<eos> Do you want to see these photos?<eos> Aye, I do.
She was so fixated on getting out of the village.<eos> She was a bit trapped, wasn't she?<eos> No way of getting out off her own back.<eos> Parents never paid her a penny.<eos> Ah, but you did.
Or down the pub with Jack.<eos> What about the evening, say after six?<eos> We were definitely in all evening.<eos> You remember. We talked about how awful it'd be to be sleeping in some muddy field.<eos> We did, yeah.
And if she didn't send them... .. well, who did?<eos> I take it you did go home last night?<eos> Mia was killed five weeks ago.<eos> So she didn't send those texts to Jason.<eos> No, she didn't.
That's okay.<eos> I'll take over from there.<eos> Okay, we'll ride this out together.<eos> So, we have a plan.<eos> Yeah. Yeah, we do.
You're all done.<eos> You just stabbed me in the back?<eos> No...<eos> Well, technically, yes.<eos> Yes, I did.
Are you my personal savior?<eos> A-Are you my spiritual guide?<eos> 'Cause you're just as lost as I am.<eos> I didn't want to lie to you, Charlie.<eos> Truly, I didn't.
Enhanced interrogation.<eos> He knows.<eos> Kurt and I go way back, don't we, buddy?<eos> I thought you said you didn't know anything...<eos> I didn't, Jane.
Does the FBI wanna tell that to the thousands of Americans whose lives are at stake?<eos> You're on US soil.<eos> That's FBI jurisdiction.<eos> Our building has a first-class medical suite.<eos> We do the surgery there.
He'll never trust me again.<eos> I'd say getting your memory wiped was the best thing that ever happened to you.<eos> Think about who you were and who you are now.<eos> You got a chance to start over.<eos> And now, Roman does.
Well, experience in other offices would give me a shot at an executive position someday.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Anyway, you said you wanted me to take a desk job.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yes, I did.
Let's see how Roman feels about this.<eos> Are you sure that's a good idea?<eos> This is a chance to prove your value to the team and get you out of this cage.<eos> Don't you want that?<eos> Of course I do, but...
Are you out of your mind?<eos> I hit them in the vest.<eos> Those vests have seams.<eos> What if you got them between the plates, - or if you missed?<eos> - I didn't.
Look me in the eyes and tell me that you're not working with the cops.<eos> Kat, listen to me.<eos> We're not working with the cops.<eos> I don't buy it.<eos> And neither does Abel.
When I told her I loved her.<eos> What?<eos> I just told her what she wanted to hear so she wouldn't kill us.<eos> I didn't feel anything.<eos> Maybe I never did.
- Not yet.<eos> But I swear I am going to get you out of here.<eos> You think I really loved her?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I do.
Here you go.<eos> Place is a bit sparse.<eos> Haven't had much time to decorate.<eos> At least your doors open when you want them to.<eos> They didn't always.
I didn't listen.<eos> Because you were too close to the mole?<eos> How did you get over it?<eos> That feeling of... being betrayed.<eos> I... I didn't.
- Yeah.<eos> What are you gonna do?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Well, it's okay.<eos> Because I do.
Did I say that?<eos> Okay, bye.<eos> Okay.<eos> Who wants to go to the grocery store? Huh?<eos> All of you do.
- So what then?<eos> - What?<eos> What happened, huh?<eos> And don't tell me that you just, you drifted.<eos> - We did, Jack.
For a long time.<eos> But I'm happy now.<eos> I like my job and I have an apartment with exposed brick.<eos> - You love exposed brick.<eos> - I really do. Yeah.
Really?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> - Yeah. I do.
- Yeah.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> - Yeah. I do.<eos> - You do. - Yeah.
Why aren't you with all your friends at Kevin's party?<eos> No one wanted to learn how to Vogue. What?<eos> Why not?<eos> They all like Kevin more than me.<eos> - Everyone does.
Bye.<eos> Okay, okay, so who was your first celebrity crush?<eos> Aladdin.<eos> - Did you say Aladdin?<eos> - I did.
I don't know.<eos> Hey, you've said three whole words since we left the show.<eos> Are you gonna tell me what the problem is?<eos> - I don't have a problem, Rebecca.<eos> - Yes, you do, Jack.
Wow, I didn't know you had to try so hard to be a good guy, Jack.<eos> I thought that you deserved something for yourself.<eos> - You know what?<eos> I thought...<eos> - And now I don't.
All right.<eos> Uncle Kevin, Grandma?<eos> - Picking the green one?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> You gonna do that one?
Sorry.<eos> It wasn't a come-on.<eos> Oh, it would be okay if it was.<eos> I could do worse, and, you know, honestly, I actually really get the whole girl thing.<eos> I do.
I know.<eos> I'm dead.<eos> You killed me, and I got to say, not cool, man.<eos> I didn't.<eos> Yeah, you did.
The crispy pork with Chinese broccoli is probably our most popular dish.<eos> It's fantastic.<eos> We don't eat pork.<eos> You know what?<eos> I do.
Well, that fits with the phone being stolen by the killer.<eos> Tim had a hi-tech security system installed in his flat, and the cameras fed direct to his computer.<eos> There's no images stored anywhere else.<eos> It's another reason we need to find his phone and computer.<eos> - Yeah, we do.
- I didn't do it.<eos> - Someone else must have.<eos> - Beast makes a mess,<eos> - Beast gets to live in it. - I didn't do it.<eos> I didn't do it.
Are you seriously suggesting that Nick is a suspect?<eos> No.<eos> One step at a time.<eos> I'd just like to know if Mr Huntley saw anything on the night in question that might help us with our inquiries?<eos> No, I didn't.
The high street youth club, with a tenner between them.<eos> Nando's.<eos> On a school night?<eos> You don't want to talk to me, Roz?<eos> Of course I do.
So, making secret plans with the enemy is more important. Than your own people knowing what's going on?<eos> I suppose so when you're sending agents to their death.<eos> It had to be done, neil, And I know that is hard for you to understand.<eos> They didn't have a chance.<eos> No, they didn't.
It's likely that the attackers tortured and questioned him.<eos> Or perhaps he discovered you had facilitated.<eos> The escape of the spies. And it was you who killed him?<eos> He didn't.<eos> And I didn't.
That he might be playing you, using your trust...<eos> I told you.<eos> I know what I'm doing.<eos> Really?<eos> Because I don't anymore.
So what?<eos> Ideas are cheap.<eos> Everyone's got ideas.<eos> Your idiot butler probably has ten Oscar-winning ideas.<eos> - I do.
Where did you go after you left the company of Mr. McClaren?<eos> I was expected at a business dinner.<eos> With my superior, Leslie Claret.<eos> What time did you attend this dinner?<eos> I didn't.
You're reading John wrong, Leslie.<eos> How so, Tom?<eos> He's a terrific kid.<eos> You'd be glad to know him, Leslie, if you knew him.<eos> I do, Tom.
Human Mabubifarti?<eos> Yeah.<eos> God, I love that name.<eos> Um, does anybody know how to play piano or keyboards?<eos> I do.
At least he's the right age.<eos> What are you saying?<eos> Roger Moore is by far the best Bond.<eos> Nobody thinks that.<eos> Well, I do.
Someone else gets there first.<eos> I mean, it's like why bother even trying to make anything that you really care about?<eos> Because that's what you do.<eos> You're probably the only one who still cares about my work.<eos> I do.
It was you.<eos> What was me?<eos> When I was a kid, in my world, you gave me some advice, and it changed my life.<eos> You became the swan.<eos> Yeah, I did.
When Baelfire rejected my magic, I respected it.<eos> I just wasn't brave enough to follow it.<eos> My whole dark life, I've sought out those who are light... like you.<eos> So, what, you don't want him to kill Emma?<eos> No, I don't.
It's... just a movie.<eos> Yeah, obviously, I know that.<eos> Do you think I'm stupid?<eos> Nobody thinks you're stupid.<eos> Oh, s does!
The rest of her sentence...<eos> 20 years to life.<eos> That's longer than she's been alive.<eos> You want to know what she did to end up in here?<eos> No. I really don't.
You are to see her.<eos> I'm to help you.<eos> "Richard."<eos> You believe me then?<eos> Yes, I do.
After he left the hospital, he stayed with us for a few nights, but...<eos> Did you know... He wasn't sick?<eos> That... that he had powers?<eos> He spoke of voices, visions.<eos> Did you?
You're having a breakdown...<eos> a stress response.<eos> Your power is kicking in to save you.<eos> It created me.<eos> You did.
Eh, it's what's in the air.<eos> Larry, stop!<eos> As your attorney, I'm advising you not to answer anything.<eos> Heidi, you have no authority to subject him to this test!<eos> Actually, I do.
And now you'll have to.<eos> See you in court.<eos> Oh, yes, you will.<eos> We should probably let go.<eos> I already did!
Your parents, Baudelaires, wanted to raise you in a quiet world, far away from the fiery injustices that were threatening all of us.<eos> They were trying to keep you safe.<eos> - It didn't work.<eos> - No.<eos> No, it didn't.
The dying man.<eos> And this place.<eos> The mausoleum.<eos> But I don't know when this is.<eos> Yes, you do.
She, um... She lives in L.A.<eos> I've been to her church.<eos> But, uh... none of that matters because... I woke up with someone who... who thought I was a good person.<eos> And... And I'm not.<eos> So, what I did...
So, the AIC hasn't contacted you yet?<eos> I told you I'd tell you if they did.<eos> Yeah, well, you told me a lot of things in our time together, and not all of them have been true.<eos> I thought we made a deal, that you wouldn't persist with this if I decided that...<eos> We did.
I probably drove her into his arms.<eos> Nazi!<eos> I left a lengthy apology on her voice-mail.<eos> How'd she respond?<eos> She didn't.
I know how this sounds.<eos> I thought about not even telling you, but...<eos> You should've stuck with that.<eos> I just, thought you should hear.<eos> And I did.
I felt like I had to pick a side, and it was so much easier to choose the parent who didn't have a new girlfriend.<eos> So, now you have to tell me everything.<eos> I mean, the last I heard, you were engaged to some woman, and she just broke it off.<eos> Liv.<eos> She, uh... She did do that.
Not what it looks like.<eos> That's Felix's one-night stand, and I was not staring at her chest.<eos> Except for one, but that's it.<eos> Okay, I believe you.<eos> You do?
Dude, I was ready to leave two days ago, but you asked me to stay for breakfast.<eos> You told me to take a bath and lay out on the balcony!<eos> I gave you a Jacksonville jiggler, which, you know, puts a lot of strain on my lower back.<eos> I have never been so happy to leave and go back to my boyfriend.<eos> I did it.
She was killed.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> He felt obliged to tell the girl's mother.<eos> Does he know how dangerous...<eos> He does.
Yeah.<eos> What happened to your arm?<eos> Fighting off the ladies.<eos> You know how it is.<eos> Or maybe you don't.
Well, I'm fairly certain it means she wants to talk.<eos> Okay, is she the single most selfish person on the planet?<eos> She literally made you eskimo brothers with Satan.<eos> - She doesn't deserve face time with you.<eos> - She doesn't?
Everyone will be there.<eos> My father wants me to look pretty. And play the happy wife.<eos> If he only knew.<eos> Listen, I don't want to tell you what to do...<eos> Then don't!
Schmidt's gonna be there?<eos> That's right.<eos> What are you thinking?<eos> Does helene bauer know how to dance?<eos> Of course she does.
More likely norway.<eos> I was recently in oslo.<eos> Our informants report increased. Allied activity in the north sea.<eos> So it went well?<eos> What did?
But everything you do. Will affect this fight.<eos> The people you see, The people you don't.<eos> The people you save...<eos> Ania?<eos> The people you don't.
Totally.<eos> Thank you for the rain check.<eos> Actually, uh... I don't, uh, want a rain check.<eos> I mean... I do.<eos> Obviously, I do, but... I don't.
I might be able to prove my innocence, but only if I can get out of here.<eos> The inspector will never allow it.<eos> But...perhaps there's another way.<eos> Did you get rid of that drunkard like I asked?<eos> I did.
Do all priests read minds, Father?<eos> No.<eos> I was so pretty, so young.<eos> Do you know, the camera adored me?<eos> Everyone did.
I felt really stupid.<eos> You're not.<eos> Never occurred to me, all that time, that he didn't even... He really didn't even miss me.<eos> - You don't know that.<eos> - Oh, I do now.
You're not.<eos> Never occurred to me, all that time, that he didn't even... He really didn't even miss me.<eos> - You don't know that.<eos> - Oh, I do now.<eos> I really do.
And I'm too messed up to do it?<eos> Spit it out, S.<eos> Do you want to have this baby?<eos> Raise a child.<eos> Do you?
Send me some help and get everything ready to go.<eos> What?<eos> Virginia!<eos> Sir, I think it would be best if you stayed here.<eos> - Do you?
Concrete floors don't pour themselves, do they?<eos> Well, I don't pour them but I do help the clients with the designs.<eos> - Right?<eos> Yeah.<eos> - Yes, you do.
Well, I don't pour them but I do help the clients with the designs.<eos> - Right?<eos> Yeah.<eos> - Yes, you do.<eos> Yes, he does.
And you?<eos> You found somewhere to go.<eos> I mean, you... I mean, you... you found a place that has the answers that you need, you know?<eos> It probably saved your life.<eos> Yeah. It did.
as we call it, because that mind tells us our private thoughts can hurt.<eos> But the truth is, Eddie, we're entitled to our own thoughts.<eos> What do you want your baby to know, Mary?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Sure you do.
I'm so sorry about all of this.<eos> Roman, I understand that you're angry.<eos> But I need your help.<eos> A friend of mine is missing, and you may know where she is.<eos> No, I don't.
I don't even know who that man is.<eos> How can you know what you have or have not done?<eos> I thought you couldn't remember anything.<eos> Unless, of course... you do remember.<eos> I don't!
It's his first impression on employers, his glance across a crowded bar at his future spouse.<eos> I am saving the thing his mother loves the most.<eos> Wow. You're fancy.<eos> And you just want to waltz in here and have our young surgeons practice on all of that?<eos> Because what? 'Cause he did a hand?
Mom, I really wish that you...<eos> - Hey, Maggie.<eos> - Hey.<eos> I invited Dr. Avery.<eos> Of course you did.
- Yes.<eos> You see a problem in our marriage, will I hear about it, or will some consultant come and kick me out of our bedroom?<eos> Stop.<eos> You know me better than that.<eos> No, Catherine, right now, I don't.
- Instead of... you want to devote your time to bringing this hospital down and me along with it.<eos> Hey, I can't stop you.<eos> And I am done.<eos> Steri-Strip and dress the wounds, please.<eos> - Yeah, well done.
- Yeah, well done.<eos> - Yeah, uh, good job, Warren.<eos> Really?<eos> Well, don't you think so?<eos> No, I do.
Is it because of Maggie?<eos> She'll get over it.<eos> No.<eos> I don't want to be with him.<eos> Okay. You do, though.
- April, April.<eos> A title is only as good as the person who earned it.<eos> Grey is very good, but when she wasn't here, the person they turned to was you.<eos> Oh, I know...<eos> Do you?
I wish we had.<eos> I thought you said you and Dr. Cohen - had clean margins in the mastectomy.<eos> - Yeah, we did.<eos> But then, a spot showed up on the latest scans alongside the chest wall here.<eos> - So you didn't.
Okay, give me a minute.<eos> Adrian.<eos> Hey.<eos> I didn't know we had a meeting.<eos> No, no, we didn't.
- Please.<eos> Diane.<eos> You didn't like any of the applicants?<eos> For the assistant's job?<eos> No, I did.
She was also my first crush and also the star of my first, um...<eos> "funny dream."<eos> Yeah, Lorraine used to bring out - the holy terror in Phil.<eos> - Oh. It seemed like he wanted to be spanked by her.<eos> No, I did not.
I appreciate all of it.<eos> So, you talked to Robin?<eos> How did it go?<eos> Did you tell him about the baby?<eos> I did.
Okay, uh... I got to go.<eos> You're a terrible kisser.<eos> Must suck to be on the outs with Lucifer.<eos> He hates it when people manipulate him.<eos> I didn't.
Sure.<eos> Probably.<eos> Listen, what would be really helpful is turning feelings into something, like a weapon.<eos> Well, I think I know just the class.<eos> You do?
If He has a problem, He sends an emissary, like me, or maybe a burning bush.<eos> So how does this God Johnson know Samael?<eos> My name.<eos> Wait, I know.<eos> - You do?
Well, I'm thinking we might not need to do that anymore.<eos> I will never forgive him, if that's what you're getting at.<eos> The point is, Mum, that I think Dad...<eos> sincerely misses you.<eos> Well, of course I do.
And cut.<eos> It's a little dark, buddy.<eos> - Hmm. - You know, just try to have fun with it.<eos> But I thought you told me this helped you work through difficult personal matters.<eos> I did.
The cleaner's dead?<eos> What?<eos> Oh, that's unfortunate.<eos> I certainly had nothing to do with that.<eos> But if you didn't, then who did?
That is it.<eos> That's not what I was told.<eos> Well, then you were told wrong, and I'm happy to recommend some to you as well.<eos> I am sorry for your troubles, but I have no stake in this.<eos> You do now.
So that's it.<eos> The Rices didn't update their case worker...<eos> So they violated their affidavit.<eos> And if the Reddings found out, then they've got a case for custody.<eos> Which they clearly did.
Yeah. I think there are boundaries.<eos> I know.<eos> You're probably right.<eos> Well, you got me into this, so I felt like I had - a right to say something.<eos> - You do.
Retail.<eos> Cadet Martin Brown.<eos> Let's start with you.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> How you doing, Martin?
When did you become a grumpy old man who doesn't like people?<eos> I like people.<eos> I don't like Riggs.<eos> If you want to go to dinner with the guy, go to dinner.<eos> If you don't, don't.
It would hurt me, because there's zero indication he needs one.<eos> Smoking-related mesenteric ischemia...<eos> It could be that.<eos> Do you smoke?<eos> My grandmother did.
Oh, hey, don't mind me.<eos> I'm sure you have all the answers.<eos> I'll just be over here, all gnarled up.<eos> Do you know what the TB protocol is?<eos> Well, in fact, I do.
I'm going to stretch my legs.<eos> What are you...?<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Well, you said to come in here.<eos> - No, I didn't.
What are you doing?<eos> Well, you said to come in here.<eos> - No, I didn't.<eos> - Yeah, you did.<eos> You did that thing with your eyes.
Excuse me.<eos> Did you say erectile-dysfunction drugs?<eos> Yes, ma'am.<eos> Hopefully somebody on board has some.<eos> Well, actually... we do.
I was wrong.<eos> I had a patient full of worms today.<eos> Did you take any pictures?<eos> What?<eos> Did I...
Yes, that's me.<eos> Hi. Did you tell Holly I'm here?<eos> Yes.<eos> Listen, Corey.<eos> We did, we did.
Can we speed this up a little?<eos> I want to get out of here.<eos> This is getting you out of here, so...<eos> I don't want you making any more decisions for my child.<eos> We didn't.
They're fine.<eos> She's the only friend I have.<eos> She's okay.<eos> You don't know that.<eos> I do.
She's the only friend I have.<eos> She's okay.<eos> You don't know that.<eos> I do.<eos> I do.
You?<eos> Creep.<eos> God.<eos> But God doesn't love me.<eos> Of course He does.
Well, often the first step is baptism, to open your heart... to let the sin out.<eos> Being gay is not a sin.<eos> Isn't lying a sin, Father?<eos> You lied about my son, didn't you?<eos> No, I didn't.
You're thinking of "Wuthering Heights," and nobody jumps off a cliff.<eos> Okay, well, then explain it in a nonliterary fashion.<eos> I write about owls, remember?<eos> You know who I was before I met you.<eos> Do I?
Your father's right.<eos> The only monster down here is the Dark One.<eos> You killed those villagers.<eos> I didn't.<eos> You did.
I just... I don't know if you accepted my apology.<eos> Yes.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - Actually, no.<eos> No, I don't.
come on, could your grandfather get any cooler?<eos> - I think I may have found a way to track commander Heywood.<eos> - Don't worry, Mr. hunter.<eos> We've already found him.<eos> - You did?
Incasewe don't...<eos> Makeitback.<eos> -I 'mnotdyingonthemoon.<eos> -Sign--signingoff.<eos> - Certainly not doing it in a tin can with the likes of you.
- Martin, are you sure about these calculations?<eos> I'mpilotingmanuallyhere.<eos> - Did I or did I not win six carlins?<eos> - No.<eos> - Yes, I did.
I should like to believe you.<eos> Tell me, why do you seek the grave of Gawain?<eos> Eh... it's a long story.<eos> I enjoy long stories.<eos> Yeah, he does.
One which would bring the bearer unimaginable power.<eos> Have you heard of the Spear of Destiny?<eos> I came across numerous obscure references to it in my studies.<eos> Of course, such a divine artifact could never actually exist.<eos> But it does.
No.<eos> If he destroys the Spear, that means this reality cannot be rewritten.<eos> Okay, we better get that Spear before he can make that happen.<eos> But even if we find it, we don't know how to access its powers.<eos> Rory does.
- Timing's everything.<eos> - Yeah, it is.<eos> Hey, did I ever thank you?<eos> For being there for me when I was laid up?<eos> Yeah, you did.
We are preaching to ourselves, too.<eos> We can all learn from God's words.<eos> - No one expects you to be perfect.<eos> - Yes, they do!<eos> The Church does.
Oh, yeah.<eos> It's Rich Eisen.<eos> You know Rich, right?<eos> Did I tell you I asked him to be the co-host of my TV show?<eos> No, you didn't, Michael.
Prove to me I didn't get shot for nothing.<eos> Splendid, so we got a wanted man on the loose in Munich, multiple intelligence agencies looking for him, and no idea where he is.<eos> We didn't prepare for this.<eos> We don't have a plan.<eos> But we do.
I may know one or three.<eos> Why don't you two go and get Owen's IDs while we work on finding him?<eos> How?<eos> He doesn't want to be found.<eos> Yes, he does.
This... This is a person.<eos> I don't know who she is.<eos> I don't know what she did...<eos> Exactly.<eos> You don't.
I don't know who she is.<eos> I don't know what she did...<eos> Exactly.<eos> You don't.<eos> They do.
Your mother's death was his mistake, but this will be yours, Daniel.<eos> You can't stop him, Alex.<eos> Do it.<eos> I know what you're feeling right now.<eos> No, you don't!
You can't stop him, Alex.<eos> Do it.<eos> I know what you're feeling right now.<eos> No, you don't!<eos> Yes, I do!
Trust me.<eos> It won't end what you're feeling right now, and it will not bring her back.<eos> It will not bring her back, Owen.<eos> Boy, pull the trigger!<eos> Do it! Do it!
It will not bring her back, Owen.<eos> Boy, pull the trigger!<eos> Do it! Do it!<eos> Daniel, give me the gun!<eos> - Do it!
SDRs, test aliases, recruiting assets.<eos> This is your curriculum.<eos> They're encrypted.<eos> It's a code very few people would recognize.<eos> But you do.
It's about a happy couple and an evil man named Scarpia intent on stealing the woman away.<eos> He's a bad, bad, evil man.<eos> Does he get away with it?<eos> No!<eos> He doesn't!
I literally just raked that.<eos> Is that why you've been acting so weird?<eos> I don't want someone exactly like me.<eos> I love that we challenge each other.<eos> You do?
- What's a fluid link?<eos> - No idea.<eos> But the TARDIS can't go anywhere without it.<eos> - Who told you that?<eos> - You did!
Don't you?<eos> And now he's wondering why.<eos> You speak Latin?<eos> I don't!<eos> Neither do I. Not a word.
Telepathic field?<eos> So now that we all understand each other, how do we all sound?<eos> You sound like children.<eos> You sound like children, too.<eos> You all do.
Slow do-- hey.<eos> Hey, you said the diamonds would be at the warehouse.<eos> No, I didn't.<eos> I said you'd get them back if you went to the warehouse.<eos> You didn't.
Emma took it.<eos> You were right.<eos> - Elizabeth, you know her.<eos> - Clearly, I don't.<eos> You do. More than any of us.
I didn't need to find her.<eos> I just needed to... make sure no one else can.<eos> This doesn't excuse what you've done.<eos> No.<eos> No, it doesn't.
- We met at the gym.<eos> - The gayest place to meet someone!<eos> Titus, you were away for months on that cruise.<eos> Was I not supposed to have any friends?<eos> I didn't.
I quit!<eos> You just lost the best client you ever had.<eos> Have fun sitting in court by yourself!<eos> I-I don't think he understands how this works.<eos> He does, okay?
You know what I want.<eos> Tell me what you want.<eos> - Owe you one.<eos> - Get what you wanted?<eos> We both did.
- There's no need...<eos> - No, she thinks I'm insane.<eos> No, I didn't say you're insane, I said it's insane!<eos> We'll see who's making an absolute mountain out of a molehill!<eos> Do it.
And right to our faces.<eos> She's having an affair.<eos> That could be it.<eos> Deceiving her husband before he was killed.<eos> So, maybe she did it.
And if you want me to let him go, you give me what you're wearing round your neck.<eos> That's it, isn't it?<eos> You killed him.<eos> Of course I didn't kill him.<eos> Yes, all right, I did.
A thief and a bigamist.<eos> Keep your voice down.<eos> Why?<eos> Doesn't Cora know about your other wife?<eos> Of course she does.
It's the only God I know.<eos> Cora, what are you burning?<eos> Please, will you read?<eos> You don't even believe in God.<eos> Ronnie did.
Perhaps he saw you together.<eos> I wouldn't hurt him!<eos> This is my fault, isn't it?<eos> I didn't take care of them.<eos> No one did.
She looked back.<eos> Oh, my heart...<eos> I don't deserve to be forgiven.<eos> Yes, you do.<eos> We all do.
As a friend.<eos> And as someone who loves you.<eos> I forgive you.<eos> Geordie... I forgive you.<eos> What did he like, your boy Oscar?
- Sorry.<eos> ..and forsaking all others, keep thee only unto him so long as you both shall live?<eos> I will.<eos> And who giveth this woman to be married to this man?<eos> I do.
A lot.<eos> But...<eos> I've never had a boyfriend before.<eos> I don't know how to do that.<eos> Yes, you do.
You wouldn't find any signs of Margaret, anyway. She hated my trekking poles.<eos> She said the very sight of them made her want to bash her own head in.<eos> Wait.<eos> - You don't think...<eos> - No. I do not.
I do, Your Honor.<eos> Mr. Davis... is the chief benefactor of the East Peck Historical Society, who fire the commemorative cannonballs.<eos> Shortly after I approached him with incriminating information, a cannonball flew through my window.<eos> That doesn't just happen.<eos> Actually, it does.
Look...<eos> What?<eos> She's frightened with a kid.<eos> If we're honest, she'll know she can trust us.<eos> Hey, do me a favor.
And realizing it leads to empathy, but empathy leads us to help others, to make sacrifices in our own life for the benefit of someone else.<eos> His crucifixion was the ultimate example of that.<eos> Yeah. Of course, you're important, too.<eos> I hope you know that.<eos> I do.
Which, I don't even know if he knew the part about...<eos> Forget about that part.<eos> Anyway, then he told me the bad news is his boss... My boss's boss... Is so pissed, he wants me fired.<eos> Well, can he do that?<eos> Just because you did that?
Can I talk to you guys for a second?<eos> S-sure.<eos> Everything okay?<eos> S-so... You know how I've been doing really well at school recently?<eos> We sure do.
He wanted to send you a letter, but it's not allowed.<eos> He's the reason I talked to your parents.<eos> He insisted.<eos> He wants what's best for you.<eos> We all do.
- Good night.<eos> - Bye.<eos> See ya.<eos> Why does this bother you so much?<eos> It just does.
See ya.<eos> Why does this bother you so much?<eos> It just does.<eos> The Centre has nothing to do with them, come on.<eos> And so what if they do?
What do you mean?<eos> Well, sometimes you can't save their lives, and they die.<eos> Yeah, it happens.<eos> You keep them all in your heart?<eos> Yeah, I do.
But you know what?<eos> I got some pretty good fucking ideas, and Gavin actually listens to those ideas.<eos> It took a while, but he respects me.<eos> And you know what, Richard Hendricks?<eos> You clearly fucking don't.
Yeah, I felt fine the entire time.<eos> What'd you do?<eos> Did you reduce the latency?<eos> I didn't.<eos> You did!
When the fuck were you gonna tell us?<eos> - Tell you what?<eos> - You know what, fat sack of shit.<eos> - Richard, do you know what?<eos> - No, I don't.
- Don't beg, Richard.<eos> - I'm not.<eos> According to the employee handbook, which you wrote, an employee cannot leave without giving two weeks' notice.<eos> You... you read the handbook?<eos> - Yeah, I did.
What the fuck?<eos> Shit.<eos> We must've left the work lights on all night.<eos> Well, do we have jumper cables?<eos> - Jared did.
- Yeah, but when she has her shade back, she'll get it.<eos> Trust me.<eos> Um... Speaking of shades, since this is probably the last time I'm going to have one...<eos> - Look, you do not have to do this.<eos> - Yes, I do.
- You know Mayakovsky banned me from seeing Alice for 48 hours?<eos> He said that I am upsetting her.<eos> - Well, he's not exactly wrong.<eos> - Trying to help.<eos> - You did.
Wait.<eos> Doctor Severin said it could be pressure on the optic nerve.<eos> Morgan told me to say that.<eos> - What?<eos> - He did?
And before I knew what he was doing, he grabbed a knife from the kitchen counter and ran himself through with it.<eos> Well, not once, not twice.<eos> Three times.<eos> I tried to save him.<eos> I did.
- Harry.<eos> - No, no, no, no, no, no, no.<eos> - Now's not the time.<eos> - I told her.<eos> You did?
I'm surprised he didn't try to stay.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> I mean, this is a good place to shop for victims.<eos> A lot of your immigration cases deal with at-risk women.<eos> No, Ryan never did any field work.
He was, but he's been very busy lately.<eos> He's working on a drug deal.<eos> It's taking up all of his time.<eos> He's eager to impress the, heads of SBK, and that doesn't concern you.<eos> Of course it does.
What?<eos> You said don't buy a gun.<eos> You said that you would help me.<eos> I want to help you.<eos> I do.
Joel!<eos> What are you doing?<eos> What I should've done in the first place.<eos> You don't want to do this.<eos> Yes, I do.
But there's a reason I've never been responsible for anyone Or anything else.<eos> Except for lives, as a doctor.<eos> Yeah, look how that turned out.<eos> Well, it's a long way to fall.<eos> Ow. Why did you do that?
About death?<eos> If that's illegal, arrest me.<eos> If you think I'm a criminal, arrest me.<eos> You don't get to play god, Mary.<eos> None of us do.
Wait. She knew about it?<eos> I, troy dixon, choose to take my life.<eos> I think you might know my husband, troy dixon.<eos> You don't get to play god, mary.<eos> None of us do.
Yep, he's a cop.<eos> Mary, Mary.<eos> What have you gotten yourself into?<eos> You realize you're trespassing, right?<eos> Yeah, I do.
I mean, come on.<eos> But here's the thing.<eos> Here's the thing.<eos> Mary, I believe she wants to help people.<eos> I do, I do, but you?
No.<eos> You are nothing like her.<eos> What the hell, Nicole?<eos> I was just seeing if you still had the will to live.<eos> You do.
You are being followed by the police, and now you're helping somebody escape police custody.<eos> I don't even know what this has become.<eos> - You don't understand.<eos> - I didn't have a choice.<eos> Well, I do.
- Because you're a psychopath.<eos> - Jess.<eos> Jess, I need you.<eos> I love you.<eos> No, you don't.
Come in!<eos> Christ.<eos> Did I order you?<eos> No.<eos> Mary did.
I know that look.<eos> He went to meet Mary.<eos> All right, let's go check out the Larimar.<eos> I already told Mary, that I don't want anything to do with your business or any of it.<eos> Okay, well, you did at one point.
He said that if I gave him our client list that he'd forgive me my debt, which I did, which was... stupid.<eos> Go to Grady's house.<eos> You'll find a vault full of drugs, including pentobarbital.<eos> You like scotch?<eos> I do.
The fucking best man has to.<eos> If any man or woman knows just cause or impediment why these two should not be joined together, let him now speak, or else hereafter forever hold his peace.<eos> Do you, Michael Sadler Berryman, take Flora Agnes Talbot to be your wedded wife?<eos> I do.<eos> Do you, Flora Agnes...
You must never get caught.<eos> We will never speak of it.<eos> But, darling, I...<eos> Please, don't you love me at all?<eos> Of course I do.
Am I like you?<eos> Of course you are.<eos> Dinner with Claudie next week, before her twins arrive.<eos> Well, she'll make a better mother than I ever did.<eos> You did all right with me.
What? You got something for me, cop?<eos> Over there!<eos> I don't see him.<eos> I thought you said he went this way.<eos> He did.
But the other one, that's, that's a fairy tale.<eos> Are you saying that I hired Raymond Thorpe?<eos> Is that it?<eos> I don't even know him.<eos> Actually, you do.
What?<eos> I don't understand.<eos> You have a new weapon<eos> - to kill Reynard? - No, you do.<eos> I do what?
Because you know her too.<eos> It's Alice.<eos> Honestly, I don't think that she knew anything about Shades.<eos> No, of course not.<eos> That Alice didn't.
You did, too.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> You agreed to do whatever it took to save him.<eos> But I didn't.<eos> Well, you did.
And that's two whistles sold.<eos> Let's go!<eos> I hate this. This thing is really stupid.<eos> You just sold two?<eos> Yes, I did.
Don't forget it.<eos> ♪ ♪ Okay.<eos> Adam.<eos> Alice has something that she wants to say to you, Don't you, honey?<eos> - Yes, I do.
This is a great workout.<eos> No!<eos> Sorry, sorry!<eos> Guys, come look!<eos> I did something very bad.
Yeah.<eos> I grew up watching a bunch of sports with my dad.<eos> What about you?<eos> Do you watch any sports?<eos> I do not.
Right?<eos> How did he propose?<eos> Did he pull out all the stops?<eos> Do you know what "pull out all the stops" means?<eos> Yes, I do.
It was us that wouldn't let you see her.<eos> At the time, you represented hope for her, Kelly.<eos> Did something happen?<eos> No, no, not that.<eos> But yes, something did.
Who said I...<eos> Duwan, I did 12 years.<eos> You owe me the truth.<eos> Now, you told me to draw Charlie outside, and give him a beatdown but you never said nothing about shooting him.<eos> No, I didn't.
You love ragnar lothbrok.<eos> You love Judith.<eos> Right?<eos> Do you love me, father?<eos> Do you?
He wanted land here.<eos> He wanted to make settlements so our people could live and they could work.<eos> And we all know what happened.<eos> Yes, but in those days he did not hold a king to ransom, nor did he have a great army.<eos> We do.
The Church has no such place.<eos> How can you be sure?<eos> Because I have authority over all France. That includes you.<eos> Do you know a priest in Paris, Father Etienne?<eos> No, I do not.
Well, you do, and it's annoying, and judgey, to be honest.<eos> You know?<eos> Like you know something I don't.<eos> Okay.<eos> Do you?
If I was an escaped murderer, where would I hide?<eos> Where?<eos> Oh, I have no idea.<eos> I just thought if I gasped I could force an epiphany.<eos> And I did.
You were taught to follow her your whole life.<eos> It makes sense that you would feel this deep connection to her.<eos> But if I have these feelings toward somebody who is such... a monster... what does that make me?<eos> You could have stopped this months ago.<eos> You didn't.
Why is she so invested in me?<eos> You're a Met.<eos> You have to be a Met.<eos> You don't understand.<eos> I don't.
Hey, what's this button? "Autopilot"?<eos> Oh, that allows the plane to fly itself when I need a break.<eos> W-What do you mean, "a break"?<eos> You don't have to fly the plane?<eos> Of course I do.
A traitor.<eos> But that's not true.<eos> To them it is.<eos> You don't know.<eos> No one does.
- I concur.<eos> This was a real hack job.<eos> Hi, mark Devereaux.<eos> - He plays detective Cole tracker on the show.<eos> - Yeah, he does.
Get up.<eos> You're gonna call Mike and tell him you got a primo.<eos> My bad.<eos> I didn't know that you had feelings like that for Severide when you guys dated.<eos> I didn't.
You know what, Hank?<eos> It feels like I'm being stiff-armed here.<eos> You and me got history. Is that what it is?<eos> I thought we'd buried all of that.<eos> So did I.
A wonderful day... all planned.<eos> The only thing off the cuff is this speech, and, you know, it's still, you know, kind of... I think... very great.<eos> Well, congratulations, Ray.<eos> You win.<eos> We all do.
High five.<eos> Ugh! What happened to the flat iron?<eos> ! Who cares?<eos> Your mom doesn't use it.<eos> No, she doesn't!
- You have no idea.<eos> He'll come.<eos> Oh, the things some people will do to take down a vacation.<eos> I made it.<eos> You did.
We lost 12.<eos> You need to know what becoming a zombie now means.<eos> - I think I do.<eos> - Trust me.<eos> You don't.
It's a simple choice, Iraxxa, the oldest one in the book.<eos> We must live together.<eos> Or die together.<eos> You dare to touch me?<eos> Yes, my dear. I do.
What's so special about her?<eos> - She's different.<eos> - Different how?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Yes, you do.
- Yep.<eos> So weckler didn't commit suicide.<eos> He was murdered.<eos> - Did you see who did it?<eos> - She never does.
Even if you found the person who assaulted your son, that's all we can charge him with... assault, not murder.<eos> Well, he could go to jail for years.<eos> If he's got priors, it could be decades.<eos> You don't know what will happen when you find him.<eos> Nobody does.
That's why we're here.<eos> Today is the last day anyone can help Connor.<eos> It's five after 8:00.<eos> You got about 16 hours to find the man who attacked my son.<eos> And if you don't...
The man in the diner, you said he'd give you till midnight, right?<eos> I'll answer your questions all day long, but I'm telling you right now I'm not your guy.<eos> All right, well, what about your husband?<eos> We cracked the code you two used.<eos> Maybe he did, too.
I'm so sorry.<eos> I'll let you know as soon as I can, okay?<eos> Thanks, honey.<eos> - Did you find something?<eos> - Uh, we did on the security footage.
Okay, and what about the boy? Is this him?<eos> Yeah, looks like him.<eos> Car's gone.<eos> You didn't say she checked out.<eos> She didn't.
What did you think would happen?<eos> That you'd get on your proud, little soapbox, make your speech, and they'd just, what, slink away into the darkness?<eos> Please don't do this.<eos> You asked me to pick a side.<eos> Well, I did.
There's a difference.<eos> Well... not yet, anyway.<eos> You really thought it was a good idea to represent him... my former partner, current captain.<eos> Good morning, honey.<eos> And yes, I did.
More proof that Davies hired Barton to bust him out of custody.<eos> All right, let's tell Avery.<eos> Okay, now we get a warrant.<eos> We make a legitimate arrest.<eos> We do this by the book.
And the committee found in your favour.<eos> The old boys' network looking after their own.<eos> And Simon was disqualified.<eos> Do you know what he did?<eos> Do you, you pathetic old man?
Says the man whose seats are made from Jackie Stewart's old trousers, which they are.<eos> - It's- -<eos> - Whatever!<eos> The fact is, in the office, we decided we'd had enough of them bickering and told them to go out and do a proper road test.<eos> So we did.
And he was, so we immediately progressed to the next level.<eos> Just before we start, JÃ©rÃ´me, are you going to make this look really annoyingly easy?<eos> Yeah, you are.<eos> OK.<eos> He did.
You're a good person.<eos> You risk everything for your country, and I hope I can live up to your example.<eos> Is Harry gone?<eos> I don't know, and I don't care.<eos> Yes, you do.
Dunno, maybe he got the E.<eos> He has to sack one of us. What?<eos> !<eos> How do you know?<eos> - I just do!
Yeah, but that's the thing, you see.<eos> There's no other way up to his room apart from this staircase.<eos> And I had full view from our table in the dining room the entire ten minutes.<eos> I would've noticed anyone going up and coming back down again.<eos> - And I didn't.
Six months, isn't it?<eos> Yes, and three days.<eos> And in all that time, you've never had one argument?<eos> I-I guess we just, you know, sort of, get on.<eos> Or rather, we did.
It's give and take.<eos> Isn't that what they say about a good marriage? Huh?<eos> Yes.<eos> You're right.<eos> They do.
[laughs] Oh! Okay!<eos> Oh, ho, ho, ho, ho! Not really.<eos> He didn't really knock him on his ass.<eos> - Felt good. [laughs]<eos> - Kinda. Emotionally, he did.
Course he does.<eos> He wants to know how we got eyes and ears into poland.<eos> So you told him all he has to do is turn.<eos> A high-ranking ss officer?<eos> I did not.
On options.<eos> You're telling me faber. Can't pull a few strings to get us papers?<eos> What use is he then?<eos> You don't trust faber?<eos> Course, I bloody don't.
Okay.<eos> That's a start.<eos> Do you know who?<eos> No.<eos> But-but Dale did.
- No, it's a phase.<eos> RJ will turn around.<eos> I mean, when he finds out how much a ticket to New Zealand costs.<eos> You love her?<eos> I do.
Last night.<eos> I drank too much, and, um...<eos> I didn't intentionally do it, but I cheated on her.<eos> Want talk about it?<eos> We just did.
I agreed not to tell anyone if he supported me to take over as General Manager.<eos> Are you satisfied?<eos> I brought Alistair down a peg or two those last few months.<eos> He hated it, but I won.<eos> And I didn't do anything criminal.
- What's all that about then?<eos> - I really don't know.<eos> Your garage carries out assessments of vehicles involved in crashes on Saint Marie.<eos> You looked at Torey Martin's car after the accident.<eos> - Yes, yes, we did.
Sir, the insurance company confirm they looked at Torey's car.<eos> - And? - It's as Archer said. Nothing wrong with it whatsoever.<eos> All the evidence points to Archer blackmailing Jerome Martin.<eos> - We just don't know what he was blackmailing him over.<eos> - No, we don't.
But you've already got one.<eos> I've seen you 'gram all those inspirational quotes with it.<eos> You're not leaving.<eos> This ends now.<eos> What does?
I would listen to my lawyer, who is telling you that nothing good will come out of confronting Rutger.<eos> Hey, where are you going?<eos> To... get some fresh air.<eos> Don't you trust me?<eos> Of course I do.
Coming out of the sky, a man in a golden helmet is lifting the bus to safety.<eos> Hey, now, we all just saw Alex run out of here, and then...<eos> - you don't think...<eos> - About him naked?<eos> Yes, I do.
Just... look, it's 1,000 bucks.<eos> Grasp the furniture.<eos> Teddy ratted you out.<eos> What?<eos> He did?
Calm down, I had to put somebody down, and you're kind of sort of reliable and capable in a middle school hall monitor kind of way.<eos> Oh, locker break-ins dropped 24% on my watch.<eos> I have no doubt they did.<eos> Look, I know I overstepped my bounds...<eos> Yeah, you did.
You may be dying, but I am here to make sure it's not fatal.<eos> Do you remember who I am?<eos> John.<eos> Of course I remember.<eos> But no one else does.
Serious.<eos> Well, it's got to be connected to LIN28A.<eos> Did Krystal just fall arse backwards into something big again?<eos> I do not know how the girl does it.<eos> Seriously, you don't?
Now.<eos> What's this?<eos> - You tell me.<eos> - You stole this from me.<eos> Brie did.
I don't know.<eos> Why?<eos> Oh, somebody from the Herald called.<eos> They were just wondering if you knew her.<eos> I don't.
It was a wager.<eos> The potential gains made it necessary.<eos> It was a complete waste of my time.<eos> If you don't start turning things around, you're going to be out on your fucking ass. You understand?<eos> I do.
- I'm working on that.<eos> I'm not interested.<eos> He needs you.<eos> I need you.<eos> So does the country.
You said it yourself.<eos> You're only acting.<eos> I agreed with Usher because he will sacrifice everything to get Brockhart into office, which makes Conway weak, ready to lose.<eos> I thought you saw what I saw.<eos> I did. I do.
It's nothing.<eos> -Okay.<eos> -What?<eos> You wanna tell me what happened in the White House today?<eos> No, I don't.
Hello?<eos> Happy birthday.<eos> - Who is this?<eos> - Come on, you must know by now.<eos> - No, I don't.
You're full of promises, Ms. Davis.<eos> The information about Macallan is still out there and Ahmadi is, oh, so elusive.<eos> You've been sabotaging me from the moment you stepped into my house.<eos> You don't care for me very much, do you?<eos> No, I don't.
We have to wait a little bit.<eos> They make you take a physical before you enter, so...<eos> Just a precaution.<eos> I didn't know you had a dog.<eos> I don't.
It was me and Dominic that were talking to him, - but it was, what... a few minutes?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I asked him if we could use his boat the next day for a fishing trip for a party of five, he said yes and to meet him at the harbour at two o'clock the following day.<eos> And did you see him again after this conversation?<eos> No, no, we didn't.
No.<eos> Mom, it's gonna be okay.<eos> We'll find him.<eos> We don't even know where he is.<eos> Yes, you do.
How?<eos> It was easy.<eos> We just all shared a tiny bit of your curse.<eos> I take it Emma hasn't told you my secret.<eos> Oh, she did.
It seems he kept one alive.<eos> A true believer wouldn't do that, now, would he?<eos> That's not possible.<eos> He wouldn't disobey me like that.<eos> And yet he did.
He kicked some dude's ass.<eos> I wasn't planning to hook up with him, but after he took his shirt off and dominated in the ring, I was like, "Come to mama."<eos> Seriously?<eos> You should've seen him.<eos> I did.
You heard me.<eos> Why?<eos> Personal experience has taught me military secrets should stay secret.<eos> With all due respect, just because you served in Vietnam doesn't give you a monopoly on national security protocol.<eos> In my office, it does.
Then maybe you can accept this: if you value your rights and your freedoms, sometimes you have to ask men and women to go to far-away battlefields to die for them.<eos> And if you ask your fellow Americans to risk their lives for your liberties, then you don't get to second-guess it all after the fact.<eos> You realize this would probably cost us our case.<eos> I don't give a damn.<eos> I do.
Trevor found his way.<eos> Doesn't mean I have to agree with it.<eos> Do you even want to know what it was gonna say?<eos> No.<eos> I don't.
Yes, he told us about your mum.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> Bet he didn't tell you it was only a month ago.<eos> No.<eos> No, he didn't.
I've been trying to get a warrant for Kotite's phone records.<eos> I'm hoping we can track this guy down from the call that Kotite must've made after you goosed him at his club yesterday.<eos> A warrant would be worthwhile, but I can guarantee you that he did not call his assassin after I left.<eos> Obviously, he told the guy to go down to the cemetery to clean his mess up.<eos> He did.
I told you, I'm not sure when I'll be back.<eos> This will take as long as it takes.<eos> Margaret, stop!<eos> You got my text.<eos> Yes, I did.
You want I should show you the pictures of what he did to his boy?<eos> You could just say that you forgot that you have an appointment.<eos> At 7:00 on a Thursday?<eos> You just said you don't want to go.<eos> I don't.
For the sake of that boy.<eos> Cut the crap!<eos> It's not crap, Ms. Sanders.<eos> You remanded Malik into foster care?<eos> No, our system did.
If it's any consolation, I think that what you did was brave and heroic and awesome.<eos> Yeah. Because you're my partner.<eos> You're not my boyfriend.<eos> But if you were my boyfriend, you would feel emasculated, because chicks, we're not supposed to be the heroes, we're supposed to be the damsels in distress, waiting to be rescued by guys like you,<eos> not the ones doing the rescuing.
Hello?<eos> Who are you?<eos> Who put you in there?<eos> Is this a sick joke?<eos> You did!
Wrong door, sir.<eos> You're the ugliest chambermaid I've ever seen.<eos> Myron, my sincere condolences.<eos> - Who died?<eos> - You did.
You know.<eos> She thought that it'd be healthy for, you know, for you, for us, if I know all of your... you know.<eos> Nope.<eos> She didn't tell you squat.<eos> No, she didn't.
I told her to take some time off, but...<eos> Too many crazies to fix?<eos> Now, I just wanted to point out a first in your partnership.<eos> You didn't take the shot... but he did.<eos> Yes, he did.
Too many crazies to fix?<eos> Now, I just wanted to point out a first in your partnership.<eos> You didn't take the shot... but he did.<eos> Yes, he did.<eos> Yes, he did.
Yes, they are.<eos> Listen to her, Susan.<eos> How are you going to exploit Kira's mutation?<eos> Don't you know?<eos> - No, no, I don't.
- They've stopped to the East.<eos> - They're taking her to the Old Wing.<eos> That's where we used to work.<eos> I thought they closed down the Old Wing.<eos> We did.
- We are family!<eos> - I know.<eos> I knew it when I saw you, which is why I told him I couldn't find you.<eos> - Didn't tell them where you are.<eos> - You didn't?
- This is nonsense.<eos> - Is it?<eos> Because my source was quite certain that Reddington has donated millions to your foundation.<eos> - You have no proof.<eos> - But we do.
Nobody here would bother to waste a word on the guy, let alone a bullet.<eos> It was a knife.<eos> Whatever.<eos> You asked to see me, Your Majesty?<eos> I most certainly did.
I'm not sorry he's dead.<eos> But I'm not happy, either.<eos> More importantly, I didn't kill him.<eos> Not sure anyone would blame you if you did.<eos> I didn't.
Well, you've got the education, you certainly have the talent.<eos> You've got the drive to go above and beyond, and... I'm still on the shop floor making barstools.<eos> Yeah.<eos> You see what I'm getting at?<eos> I do.
Now let's go, come on.<eos> I cannot wait until you get married - and have a kid. - Whoa!<eos> Do you know something I don't know?<eos> That you're insane?<eos> Please, somebody just do it.
You burned down your office to cover your tracks?<eos> $100,000 is more than enough to replace some old computers and open a new office.<eos> Tendu said he was gonna pay you a hundred thou?<eos> He didn't say he would do it.<eos> He did it.
- Did they make their bust?<eos> - They save the precinct? - No, they decided to try to bring in a bigger fish.<eos> They're not gonna make the hearing.<eos> - So Jake's doing the right thing instead of the selfish thing?<eos> You did this to him.
But you know what Al's been up to.<eos> You can't read the morning paper without seeing his name.<eos> Keep it down, will you?<eos> My wife and kids don't know my real name.<eos> Nobody does.
I just want her to remember that.<eos> How about I remind her, huh?<eos> Tonight.<eos> Might help if you returned my lipstick, though.<eos> I did.
The last person to speak so freely to me is now peeling bananas with their feet.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Well, you wouldn't be so upset unless what I was saying was true.<eos> Do you have a better idea of how I can get what I want?<eos> As a matter of fact, I do.
And I won't give it up. Zelena.<eos> Zelena.<eos> Enjoy life as a statue.<eos> Maybe Dorothy will come back and save you.<eos> She did what?
I left a dozen messages, but I haven't heard back.<eos> Gold.<eos> Gold's got her in the back of his shop.<eos> I-I'm not not proud of what I did, but I did what I thought was best for myself.<eos> We both did.
- Listen, listen, listen.<eos> - Okay.<eos> A few people died today down at that shop.<eos> Don't you want to help us know why?<eos> Of course I do.
I'm sorry.<eos> I mean, I'm not... I'm not gonna be here much longer 'cause I'm putting in my notice next shift.<eos> No.<eos> No, you... you can't let him win.<eos> - Well, he did.
Hey, man.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I loved Lexi.<eos> We all did.
"There's a surgeon, a one guard for the Bulls."<eos> I want to grab Olinsky and tell him it's gonna be okay... but it's not, never will be.<eos> The confession...<eos> I didn't actually hear it.<eos> Who did?
Read the title of chapter three.<eos> "Trials: It's All A Con."<eos> And I think I'm his mark.<eos> I never thought Dylan could do something like this.<eos> But you do now?
So I just try to provide a little guidance.<eos> Golden Glove.<eos> That's right.<eos> Rog, you know who we're talking to here?<eos> Yeah, I do.
Consider taking my job.<eos> I'm gonna retire, and I already mentioned you to the guy that makes the decisions here, so...<eos> Ho-Hold on.<eos> I know you love being a cop, Roger.<eos> I did, too.
Oh, he looks sad again.<eos> Well, I really envy your relationship.<eos> Other than you two only having sex once a year, you're the perfect couple.<eos> You-you know about that?<eos> Uh, yeah, everyone at the university does.
I told them to eat a bag of dicks.<eos> - Yo!<eos> - Sorry.<eos> You said that shit?<eos> Yeah, I did, verbatim.
You are the great evil.<eos> You and your son are destined to destroy each other.<eos> Now that nap time's over, it's time for battle.<eos> You found the other half.<eos> Indeed I did.
After tomorrow, there'll be no getting rid of me.<eos> - Promise?<eos> - Aye.<eos> So... did they trust you?<eos> Of course they did.
What do you hope to see?<eos> The real thing.<eos> The real thing can be real messy.<eos> I know that.<eos> You do and you don't.
Oh, man.<eos> Animal outside my house.<eos> Where I live, your sister lives, your nephews sleep.<eos> I never thought it would go this far.<eos> Well, it did.
They threw me out after I exposed their mission here.<eos> Well, now you have your answers, Alex, so I'll...<eos> Harry...<eos> I know how you feel.<eos> - No, you don't.
Well, now you have your answers, Alex, so I'll...<eos> Harry...<eos> I know how you feel.<eos> - No, you don't.<eos> - Yeah, I do.
_<eos> So, you don't trust me.<eos> I don't trust anyone.<eos> - Well, I trust you.<eos> - No, you don't.
Just act like you have one.<eos> Our appointment's in an hour.<eos> You almost ready?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Hey, thanks... for doing this.
Shh.<eos> Just so you know, that guy in the parking lot hit me.<eos> He wasn't in a car, but okay.<eos> Just say you want to drive.<eos> I honestly don't.
Gonna take a wild guess here and say Darren was stealing valuables from his drywall jobs.<eos> Probably fencing them, too, which is why he could afford a second home.<eos> You sure nothing's missing?<eos> I was telling the truth, I honestly don't know.<eos> I do.
So unless two million-dollar guitars found their way into Cosmo's orbit, we're looking at what's left of the Lady Frances.<eos> Killer was smart enough to clean up, but they missed this bit.<eos> That's blood.<eos> You don't think the guitar was the murder weapon?<eos> I do.
A rival banger got his address and that was that.<eos> And you're quite certain you can't identify the person from Atlantic City?<eos> No. Sorry.<eos> You paid for the time?<eos> Yeah, I did.
♪ Revenge, revenge, revenge is gonna be mine ♪<eos> ♪ Revenge, revenge, revenge is gonna be mine ♪<eos> - Let's go.<eos> - Wait, you want revenge on a crocodile for taking your hand?<eos> Yeah, afraid he did more than that.
saving time already.<eos> Genius.<eos> I was gonna say,<eos> "Why does anyone think Sheldon's a genius?"<eos> But I didn't.
Could have played that on my harp.<eos> Just roll the clip.<eos> Sheldon: So tell us in your own words about that magical moment when fun with flags was born.<eos> I honestly don't remember.<eos> Sheldon: Sure you do.
I tried.<eos> She's not answering my calls.<eos> Which really hurts because I bought her that phone.<eos> I made a huge mistake.<eos> No, you didn't.
Remain in the car, please.<eos> Sir, you will remain in the car.<eos> Joe.<eos> - Do you even know what this place is?<eos> - No, I don't.
His name is Varian, and he's some kind of wizard.<eos> Wow!<eos> A real wizard?<eos> Do you think he'll have one of those pointy hats, and, like, a robe and a staff and cast spells?<eos> No, I do not.
Listen...<eos> You want to be a good leader?<eos> Let your soldiers believe in their success.<eos> - And when they find out the truth?<eos> - Maybe they never do.
Will they pull the plug on this operation?<eos> They wouldn't do that.<eos> We just need a new angle, a new plan.<eos> What we need is to admit we screwed up.<eos> We didn't.
I did it to save everyone else.<eos> Well, you exposed yourself, and now, you should leave the team.<eos> Yeah, I should.<eos> Yet I don't want you to.<eos> You don't?
- It's so exotic.<eos> - Huh?<eos> Do you think he's from overseas?<eos> You don't know what boo means, do you?<eos> Yeah, I do.
What do you mean?<eos> These were supposed to be bimberries.<eos> You know, for someone who was careless enough to leave...<eos> Don't you know dimberries cause hyperactivity in rodents?<eos> Uh, yeah. Who doesn't?
There are like 25 of these things.<eos> Let's just get out of here, Arnwaldo. Hey!<eos> Don't call me Arnwaldo.<eos> Besides, don't you at least wanna know whose basement this is?<eos> No. No, I don't.
And my sister doesn't need one since she didn't do anything.<eos> She hasn't even been charged.<eos> - Why?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> Your boss does.
She financed the attack.<eos> Now...<eos> It's not true.<eos> We all know that.<eos> But the country doesn't.
I knew that no matter how much you'd hate me for what I'd done, you'd do the right thing for your country.<eos> You can't be corrupted Kurt.<eos> Stop calling me Kurt!<eos> You don't know me.<eos> Yes, I do.
- 'Cause it's a giant turd.<eos> - It's the worst.<eos> It's unusable.<eos> You guys don't even like it.<eos> - Yes, we do.
We can't subpoena them.<eos> So we need to break in to the bank's computers.<eos> We need a hacker.<eos> Does anyone know a hacker?<eos> Boyle does.
Damn, those are nice.<eos> Must be her apology for yesterday's behavior.<eos> Nigga, you sent these to Amber to apologize to her.<eos> She just sent them back.<eos> - I did?
Thank you all for your support while we worked on our Air Force project.<eos> And please know that we could not have done it without you, so cheers.<eos> Cheers.<eos> You know, it's nice of you to acknowledge us, but this is your accomplishment.<eos> Yeah, you guys did this all on your own.
Oh, snap!<eos> It is on!<eos> Hey, Teddy.<eos> What you up to, buddy?<eos> What wizard did this to you?
They must've really cared about you.<eos> You know, you haven't lost at everything.<eos> You did beat me at the Green Arrow game all by yourself.<eos> That's right...<eos> I did.
And she's like, "I'm not having this piece of shit's baby." [audience laughing]<eos> And that's why abortion is the last line of defense against shitty people in the species.<eos> So, we need them to abort every shitty baby. [audience cheering]<eos> I mean, all animals do this.<eos> Animals do it late.
- You're unbelievable, you.<eos> - What can I say?<eos> I'm wasted in promotions.<eos> How do you sleep at night?<eos> Oh, sorry, you don't.
- Yeah!<eos> - ..do you fancy being on my Christmas team?<eos> - Oh, yeah.<eos> - What?<eos> - Yeah, I do.
I told you, you can't.<eos> Little Miss Vanderpanties is in solitary, down in the sub-basement.<eos> Yeah! And why do you think that is?<eos> How the hell should I know?<eos> - Wh... because you do!
Little Miss Vanderpanties is in solitary, down in the sub-basement.<eos> Yeah! And why do you think that is?<eos> How the hell should I know?<eos> - Wh... because you do!<eos> - No, I don't.
So, uh, what are we doing?<eos> Are we just--<eos> Do you not see the phone to my ear?<eos> I- - I do, but-- What?
Oh, sweet Jesus Lord God Christ, not some freaky metal robot legs!<eos> [meows] That'll do, Schnuckiputzi.<eos> [meows] And also, it's not just the legs.<eos> No, you crazy Kraut bastard, I don't want any part of those parts!<eos> But your employer, Mr. Trexler, does.
And yet they left you your lighter.<eos> Wait. When I got pistol-whipped, I was talking to an English guy.<eos> We don't have an English guy.<eos> I... you have to remember me!<eos> Uh, actually, I don't.
Wait. When I got pistol-whipped, I was talking to an English guy.<eos> We don't have an English guy.<eos> I... you have to remember me!<eos> Uh, actually, I don't.<eos> And also, I don't, so...
- Adoption?<eos> - No.<eos> I mean... not "no". I mean, I know...<eos> Know that you have options?<eos> Because you do.
You know I'm not a bad guy.<eos> And you got into my truck... after you decked me.<eos> You said you have answers.<eos> About the venomous vixens.<eos> - I do.
I see you're still a bitch.<eos> You have to try this.<eos> Bacon.<eos> They should put this on everything.<eos> They do.
Hey.<eos> Am I the biggest cliché ever?<eos> No.<eos> I know what you're going through.<eos> Of course you do.
- You had no plan out there, huh?<eos> - Oh, I still had time.<eos> They hadn't cocked their guns yet.<eos> Why?<eos> Did you?
I couldn't.<eos> You never would've hired me.<eos> I meant when they started coming after us.<eos> I was hoping I wouldn't have to use it.<eos> Well, now I do.
I'm here to tell you you're backing the hell off my firm.<eos> I know what you're here to do, but let me ask you this.<eos> Does your firm know what it is that you did?<eos> But if you don't let this shit go, they're not gonna be the only ones I tell.<eos> And not just what I did.
I know what you're here to do, but let me ask you this.<eos> Does your firm know what it is that you did?<eos> But if you don't let this shit go, they're not gonna be the only ones I tell.<eos> And not just what I did.<eos> What you did.
And not just what I did.<eos> What you did.<eos> I let this shit go, and it comes back and hits you in the ass.<eos> You're gonna sign something saying I had nothing to do with this.<eos> I already did.
I just, er...<eos> I just tell you what happened?<eos> I give you my word on it.<eos> She always wanted me to play with her.<eos> I always did.
The devil lied.<eos> Why should we be surprised?<eos> Do we not know the devil for a liar?<eos> Do we not know his works to be illusion?<eos> Of course we do.
That doesn't make sense.<eos> They came to us for this merger.<eos> They must've gotten a better offer, because they buried an escape clause in the addendum.<eos> - You know what we have to do.<eos> - Yes, I do.
And guess who builds those prisons.<eos> Wait a second.<eos> Are you telling me to go back on my word because your client's bullying you?<eos> Harvey, I thought we were in this together.<eos> - So did I.
- I said drop 'em.<eos> - No.<eos> - Excuse me?<eos> I may not be name partner yet, but you don't get to tell me who my clients are.<eos> Yes, I do.
You want to run that by me again?<eos> I just ran it by you.<eos> What you are doing is a mistake.<eos> I don't think so, and Donna doesn't think so, which means--<eos> Actually, Harvey, I do.
- Oh, Becky.<eos> Girls, this is William, he's an alienist.<eos> - You won't know what that means.<eos> - Neither does he.<eos> - No-one does.
- What did you just say?<eos> Where you going?<eos> Like I said, I need to find Donna.<eos> I want to know right now, do you know where Mike is?<eos> - No, I don't.
Amen.<eos> She's gonna be back home before you know it.<eos> I don't want Mama to come back.<eos> Oh, you don't mean that.<eos> You do too.
She's gonna be back home before you know it.<eos> I don't want Mama to come back.<eos> Oh, you don't mean that.<eos> You do too.<eos> You do too.
It's all a test.<eos> Every single thing he expects of us... listen to me.<eos> Every single thing he expects of us, we have to do.<eos> Do you understand?<eos> - Do you?
- Yeah, I'd like that.<eos> - Yeah, okay.<eos> Thanks, I'll be good.<eos> I know you knew Frankie Belmont.<eos> No, I didn't.
Well, yeah, but if we go to trial, we have to establish motive.<eos> And so far...<eos> There's an explanation there somewhere.<eos> I didn't even notice her.<eos> None of us did.
No!<eos> You're a Belmont!<eos> This is all your fault.<eos> I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> Yes, you do.
I am calling you defeated, Trevor Belmont.<eos> You fought your battle and you decided you lost.<eos> We didn't have a choice.<eos> Perhaps.<eos> But we do.
So you're going to die for nothing?<eos> For people you don't know?<eos> I don't know any of you, but that doesn't matter, does it?<eos> My family, the family you demonized and excommunicated, has fought and died through generations for this country.<eos> We do this thing for Wallachia and her people.
Killing you was the point.<eos> Living through it was just a luxury.<eos> I will incinerate you before your fangs touch that man's throat.<eos> I thought I was your legendary savior.<eos> So did I.
No, you didn't.<eos> A good mama deserves to see her son again.<eos> She don't deserve to see him like that.<eos> No.<eos> No, she don't.
That's murder, ain't it?<eos> You know what the penalty for murder is, don't you, lieutenant?<eos> Yeah. Hmm?<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Yeah, you do.
Who?<eos> Moses?<eos> Uh-huh.<eos> They took him. They took our boy.<eos> Who did?
I want him to go to a school.<eos> I don't want him to drop his eyes every time a white man walk by.<eos> I don't want him to be a "boy" no more once he turn into a man.<eos> Don't you want that too?<eos> Course I do.
We can't get married anywhere else.<eos> Up north, I guess.<eos> We don't know anybody up north.<eos> I understand your client wishes to change his plea, counselor.<eos> Yes, he does, your honor.
Arrogance and fear still keep you... From learning the simplest and most significant lesson of all.<eos> Which is?<eos> It's not about you.<eos> When you first came to me... You asked me how I was able to heal Jonathan pangborn.<eos> I didn't.
-Unless you ate something weird.<eos> Then it wasn't the ghost.<eos> Kinda hard to suss that out after the fact though.<eos> I didn't soil myself.<eos> He did.
No, I think that's because we told very, very scary ghost stories, and I think the other kids were terrified of us.<eos> That's what was actually happening.<eos> So, how did y'all get into ghosts?<eos> Did one of you see one?<eos> Yeah, I did.
Hi.<eos> Ozzy rocks!<eos> Yeah!<eos> Yes.<eos> He certainly does rock.
People always move on.<eos> Sheriff in New Mexico reports a UFO encounter.<eos> The crew of the SS Ourang Medan dies mysteriously.<eos> The entire town of Langville, Montana, goes missing.<eos> It does?
Thanks for the upgrade.<eos> Rowan, ya big bully!<eos> Hope this guy knows how to ride a motorcycle.<eos> Rowan, not Kevin!<eos> Yeah, he does.
Anything.<eos> Hell yeah!<eos> Second floor is mine.<eos> You can't claim a whole floor.<eos> -I just did.
Glass.<eos> Okay, MacGyver, no woman's gotten this far, but, um...<eos> You had a plumber cut your water?<eos> No.<eos> I did it myself.
But you're allowed to have guests.<eos> Yes.<eos> But my guests aren't allowed to slide down the trash chute, naked.<eos> I didn't go naked down the...<eos> - Robin did that.
- Yes.<eos> - Why?<eos> Really? I...<eos> Do you not want me to?<eos> I do! I...
Eleven.<eos> Did you drink this?<eos> No.<eos> Oh, thank God.<eos> You did.
I can totally handle all of this by myself.<eos> I'm an independent woman.<eos> My God, seriously?<eos> But I don't want to.<eos> I don't.
The place I'm gonna take you gentlemen... listen to me now...<eos> it's downright naughty.<eos> Whoo!<eos> We know what you're talkin' about.<eos> No, you don't, Dave.
I'm sure it's the job to end all jobs, Tulip.<eos> I imagine they'll be singing songs about it.<eos> Pretty damn close, actually, yeah.<eos> Tell me you don't want to. Tell me you don't miss it.<eos> I just did.
- Level up.<eos> I'll announce it Sunday service.<eos> Oh. Okay.<eos> Thought I could make it work.<eos> I really did.
But it's ours.<eos> And for the first time in my life...<eos> I don't feel alone.<eos> We weren't supposed to find each other.<eos> But we did.
First floor.<eos> Gold-class breakfast.<eos> This is deck chief Gus Mancuso.<eos> Who the hell planted a tree on my ship?<eos> Who did that?
"And what have ye there in the basket?"<eos> "And what have ye there in the basket?<eos> "Ye tight little fairy just fresh from the dairy,<eos> "Will you give me some cream if I ask it?"<eos> He did it to everyone.
No.<eos> Gave up 1,891 days ago.<eos> Not that you're counting.<eos> Since when did you smoke?<eos> I don't.
It might be the only chance I'm going to get.<eos> Look, one broken, out-of-date condom I might have believed was an accident.<eos> But two?<eos> You wanted it.<eos> Maybe I did.
Jack.<eos> Let me take you to set.<eos> Great.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I do, sometimes. Yes.
And the next week, that is to say, on the 11th of the month at Jude's baby christening to be exact, uh, following the consumption of quite a lot of alcohol, Mark and I, well, we had similar relations?<eos> And this is the funny part, I suppose.<eos> Owing to these relations, uh, the resulting life form currently residing in my tummy could actually, in fact, be either of yours.<eos> I know I should have told you both before.<eos> But I just didn't.
I mean, let's face it.<eos> Things could be worse.<eos> He is pretty fucking amazing.<eos> He's richer than God, and he has a very nice-sized puppet.<eos> He does.
- No,no.<eos> - Yeah, we got a big problem.<eos> Your friend, here, really insulted my friend and he needs to apologize.<eos> I don't think he does.<eos> He doesn't.
Of that dress you wore in Vienna.<eos> I know that it's hard to see it right now, but you have your whole life ahead of you.<eos> That's a terrible thing to say.<eos> That's a terrible, terrible thing to say.<eos> But you do.
You tell them we're calling it off.<eos> We'll motorcade to the cathedral.<eos> And then we'll bury him, and we put an end to all this.<eos> I don't give a damn anymore.<eos> I don't.
And yet, every night, when I climb into bed, turn off the lights, and stare into the dark,<eos> I wonder...<eos> Is this all there is?<eos> You wonder?<eos> Every soul on this planet does.
Thank God you're okay.<eos> It's been a while.<eos> I had 20 years to get us ready.<eos> And we never had a chance.<eos> We didn't last time either.
Activate the shield!<eos> Shield engaged.<eos> Lt. Whitmore, clear the blast zone.<eos> Surprised to see me?<eos> Do it.
Lt. Whitmore, clear the blast zone.<eos> Surprised to see me?<eos> Do it.<eos> Push the button, Tom.<eos> Do it, Tom.
The gods must be punishing me, don't you see?<eos> This is what I get for giving in to my disgusting urges.<eos> I'm such a whore.<eos> Sweet bun, I must admit I too sometimes have urges... impure thoughts.<eos> We all do.
No, it's starting.<eos> No.<eos> Oh, no, no, no.<eos> Come on. Sing.<eos> - Do it.
They killed Carl.<eos> Those fuckers.<eos> Did he suffer?<eos> No...<eos> Oh, yeah, yeah, he did.
They truly are monsters.<eos> Those monsters are gonna kill Brenda.<eos> She's somewhere out there in a cart.<eos> I tried to warn everyone, they didn't believe me!<eos> Of course they didn't.
And it's dope.<eos> This guy's smart.<eos> I mean like, fuck-a-guy smart.<eos> Know what I'm saying?<eos> Yeah, you do.
Look at me.<eos> I was in a good mood.<eos> - I love spoilers.<eos> - No.<eos> Yes, I do.
Why? Why?<eos> Why do you even like him?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Yes, you do.<eos> Yes, you do.
- Stop it!<eos> What is the matter with you?<eos> I... I know what this is about.<eos> No, you don't.<eos> Yes, I do.
You have no compassion.<eos> Actually, I'm just bored, because I know everything you're going to do before you do it.<eos> - Sure you do.<eos> - Oh, you don't believe me?<eos> No, I don't.
You're mad. Who was that man?<eos> He put foolish thoughts in your mind.<eos> He helped me.<eos> I love him.<eos> No, you do not.
He devised an experiment...<eos> He kidnapped an Ymbryne, not knowing or caring whether she would survive the experiment.<eos> But the fate of Barron and his group was more horrifying still.<eos> Why didn't Barron turn into one?<eos> He did.
All troops to the Wall!<eos> - Nothing?<eos> - No.<eos> - How do you know he won't betray us?<eos> - I don't.
Perhaps we were both wrong.<eos> We are more similar than I thought.<eos> Thank you General.<eos> - Are you sure you don't want to go back?<eos> - Of course I do.
- Real?<eos> - Yeah, what if they still are?<eos> And, what? You think Stephen Renney is one of them?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> - Yeah, well, I do.
It's in your blood.<eos> The Apple is everything.<eos> Your mother died to protect it.<eos> She had no choice.<eos> I do.
[Toll] You guys get that, right?<eos> I know it sounds like a terrible idea.<eos> We prefer to dance with who brung us... Dr. Clyne. You get that, right?<eos> "Dance with who brung you"?<eos> No, actually, I don't.
Arteries spurt blood.<eos> And veins?<eos> Bleed.<eos> I think you need to practice your boy/girl dating talk at home before you come out.<eos> Yeah, I probably do.
There is only one question that any military court need ask of the accused.<eos> Do you deny disobeying Colonel Sangston's direct orders?<eos> Well, do you, Private?<eos> - No, sir.<eos> I don't.
Ordered his son, Little Tony, to kill Francis.<eos> Kid fucked it up.<eos> Francis ran, became a federal informant in return for protective custody.<eos> Could have turned my career around if only I'd listened.<eos> I didn't.
- What's this...<eos> Shut up.<eos> Sit down in the chair.<eos> You ever see a match-grade round traveling 3,000 feet per second go through a window?<eos> Nobody does.
But I restore lives, not Dana! Me!<eos> Men, women, children, I give them hope.<eos> Make them whole.<eos> Do you even know what that's like?<eos> Yes, I do.
Safer than a savings account!"<eos> - I didn't say that.<eos> "Home run after home run...<eos> Walt Camby!"<eos> - I didn't do that!
I don't wanna be more!<eos> I like who I am.<eos> You don't even know who you are.<eos> What do you...?<eos> Of course I do.
You can't, can you?<eos> Dad, why does she keep staring at me like... that!<eos> Try to keep up.<eos> I don't really know how to dance!<eos> Of course you do.
Now why won't you show me?<eos> Because I don't know it!<eos> You what?<eos> I don't know it, okay?<eos> No one does.
Daddy, here's a shell for you.<eos> That's great, dory.<eos> You found another one.<eos> - I did?<eos> - Oh, yes, you did.
Turn around.<eos> Take a deep breath.<eos> You all right?<eos> How are we supposed to fight the Others if we don't even know what they are?<eos> Actually, we do.
Have you lost your mind?<eos> How did you make me strong?<eos> How did you draw the weakness out?<eos> What did you do?<eos> What did you DO?
Jeff... I was at the end of my rope.<eos> The financial pressure was crazy.<eos> Groceries and tutors and... I got four kids under 13 in braces.<eos> Do you understand?<eos> Do you, Jeff?
Let's go again.<eos> This time, the bait needs to dangle longer.<eos> I must strike the weak spot from behind.<eos> And how do you know they have a weak spot?<eos> I don't.
I told him something that he wasn't ready to hear.<eos> What?<eos> Well, believe it or not, I know something that's going to happen.<eos> I can't explain how I know.<eos> I just do.
Check it out.<eos> Beautiful, honey.<eos> Then we can put them together.<eos> - Check it out.<eos> How does a crown?
Thank you much.<eos> Let's go get a room.<eos> Welcome to the Comanche 66.<eos> Do you have a reservation?<eos> We do not.
Okay, well, we knew that.<eos> He's your son?<eos> Adopted.<eos> Do you know the birth father?<eos> Yes, I do.
Needless to say the position of Vice Admiral, it's yours.<eos> No one deserves it more.<eos> Vice Admirals don't fly do they?<eos> No.<eos> They don't.
Strange, that.<eos> Oh, you can mock.<eos> Didn't you ever love anything that much?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, I did.
I'm a ginger, but I'm a natural redhead.<eos> Not that you're ever gonna find out.<eos> Because you will never be invited into my basement.<eos> I don't wanna see your basement!<eos> Yes, you do!
- Hi.<eos> - Did you sleep over?<eos> - Oh, God, no.<eos> What, have a sleepover here? Ew.<eos> - No, he didn't.
If he agrees to help us, Max is as good as found.<eos> Cool!<eos> Fabulous!<eos> Tell me you got that!<eos> Oh, heck yes, I did.
That you can hear its roar at night.<eos> They say this, they say that, but, as far as I know... not one soul has ever actually seen this dragon.<eos> Except me.<eos> You saw a dragon?<eos> I sure did.
You need help.<eos> You need Pete.<eos> Did you see that?<eos> Did you just see that?<eos> I sure did.
Don't sell the tech stocks. Don't do that.<eos> Milly Willy.<eos> Make a fuss, perv, and it'll hurt so bad you won't believe that it could hurt like that, all right?<eos> Did you tell anyone what you saw today?<eos> - Did you?
It sucks.<eos> You were hitting that booze too hard for a nice girl.<eos> You need to get Luke out of your head.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - You do.
Like we would ever do that.<eos> No way.<eos> Come on! Do it.<eos> He's not gonna do it.<eos> Do it!
Sly bunny.<eos> Dumb fox.<eos> You know you love me.<eos> Do I know that?<eos> Yes. Yes, I do.
You were choosing between very different products with different heritages, sensibilities, techniques.<eos> - Well, that's gone now.<eos> - What happened, in your view?<eos> - I thought you studied our case.<eos> - I did.
- What happened, in your view?<eos> - I thought you studied our case.<eos> - I did.<eos> - Schwinn went to China.<eos> - We did.
To make a sleeping bag out of our clothes.<eos> We cut up our jackets and we taped them together and made a big, wide sleeping bag.<eos> And we slept there in our long underwear.<eos> - And you shared the sleeping bag?<eos> - We did.
Did you know I lost my daddy?<eos> Yah!<eos> He gave me Ellie, for my birthday.<eos> If we do not dig deeper, its trunk sticking out.<eos> Do deeper.
It's a perfect match.<eos> We don't need anything else.<eos> I know that you think you do.<eos> And God knows there's a big part of me it feels the same.<eos> But we don't.
What are you hoping to find?<eos> Dr. Tennant told me not to come back without the patient file.<eos> He's try to call.<eos> Do you have the PID?<eos> I don't.
I will not be lectured by the man who let Gellert Grindelwald slip through his fingers.<eos> Madam President, I'm sorry to interrupt, but this is critical...<eos> You better have an excellent excuse for this intrusion, Ms. Goldstein.<eos> Yes.<eos> I do.
You were just saying what?<eos> I mean, you know, some Arab dude she was with.<eos> Describe him.<eos> You know, an Arab dude.<eos> No, I don't.
Never saw him before.<eos> Nope, nope.<eos> You know the girl?<eos> I mean, not per se, you know what I'm saying?<eos> No, I don't.
Like cops, who else is there?<eos> Uh, I talked to one. - Why?<eos> - What do you mean, why?<eos> Tell me he told you you had to?<eos> He didn't.
Bring him!<eos> I know how this ends.<eos> Then tell Yahweh's you are coming, courtesy of Mars.<eos> It must pain you to know that the one true God, chooses us over you.<eos> But not today, he didn't.
Pilate will not let this rest.<eos> I've endangered you.<eos> They have a tracker.<eos> They can't know we are up here.<eos> They already do.
Just walk a little further.<eos> Why?<eos> To be close.<eos> Simon, do you love me?<eos> Yes, with all the heart, I do.
I mean, she was always so bright.<eos> Sohappy.<eos> To think she was carrying around all that pain, all that unhappiness every day.<eos> I should've seen it.<eos> But I didn't.
Fuck!<eos> Are we clear?<eos> Yeah.<eos> We fucking made it.<eos> We did it.
Are we clear?<eos> Yeah.<eos> We fucking made it.<eos> We did it.<eos> We did it.
Middle East peace symbol Schlomo Khalidi... looking much better, is here too.<eos> So much color and noise.<eos> And there will be plenty of both at the end of the match... because the final whistle will trigger what we are told will be... the biggest firework display ever seen at a sporting event.<eos> When we was kids... did you ever think that we'd end up going to the final together?<eos> Yes, I did, brother.
Yes?<eos> Go fuck yourself!<eos> Yes! Yes!<eos> Yes!<eos> We did it, Seb!
I think there's something seriously wrong with my eyes.<eos> Fine, Scott.<eos> And afterwards... why don't you stop by the principal's office and explain to him... that you're disrupting class again?<eos> I trust you know the way.<eos> - Yeah, I do.
Don't worry, Scott.<eos> There's not much to see.<eos> Hey, wait.<eos> I didn't tell you my name.<eos> No, you didn't.
A good neighbor... a good worker.<eos> I want to believe that's who you are.<eos> It is.<eos> But nobody in this town really knows you.<eos> Yes you do.
- Moira will be waiting on the plane.<eos> - Wait.<eos> What?<eos> Not all of us can fully control our powers.<eos> Then don't.
I know the headmistress.<eos> You'll be safe there.<eos> "Headmistress?" What is it, a convent?<eos> Do you want to live?<eos> Do you?
In fact, you sold them to insurgents.<eos> And these are now empty.<eos> Do you know who I am, Major?<eos> Yes, General.<eos> I do.
The waitress who's refilled your coffee three times?<eos> That's her.<eos> Neither of you had any idea who the other was.<eos> - I knew it all along.<eos> - No, you didn't.
I will be listened to.<eos> I am as old as this land, and I will...<eos> What do you know about anything?<eos> I know everything about you, Conor O'Malley.<eos> No you don't.
I am as old as this land, and I will...<eos> What do you know about anything?<eos> I know everything about you, Conor O'Malley.<eos> No you don't.<eos> If you did...
You finally said it.<eos> Why didn't it kill me?<eos> I deserve punishment.<eos> I deserve the worst.<eos> Do you?
I guess not either.<eos> But we're going to have to learn.<eos> - I know.<eos> - You do know, don't you.<eos> Of course you do.
Do what you love, then you'll be great, 'cause you won't be afraid anymore, because you'll actually be doing it.<eos> Right?<eos> Look, do you love to sing?<eos> I mean, do you really love it?<eos> Of course I do.
He goes, he can come back with a drawer full of medals, and they will hate him even worse than before.<eos> J.C.<eos> It ain't gonna make no difference no how.<eos> Do you run, Mr. Davis?<eos> Do I'.
This girl, she wanted to get pregnant.<eos> I think she was ordered to get pregnant.<eos> Isupposel should be flattered.<eos> I think all things considered, you're actually better off in America.<eos> I don't...
After all this time now.<eos> Tsk! It must really be something.<eos> You know, you got a felon on the books here.<eos> You know that?<eos> I do.
- Yeah?<eos> You feel it?<eos> I do.<eos> You have me.<eos> You didn't before, but you do now.
Hey, I'm just trying to understand... why your people decided to send...<eos> How do I phrase this?<eos> You.<eos> My people didn't send me.<eos> The ocean did.
Of course, the can-canteen, yeah.<eos> "The restaurant."<eos> You're not in France now, you bleedin' spanner.<eos> Do you smoke?<eos> - Do you?
Yeah, it looked all right.<eos> It's a bit shit.<eos> That supposed to look like they're jumping in or something?<eos> Yeah.<eos> It doesn't.
We have exams.<eos> We need to prepare for them.<eos> Yeah, they're midterm exams.<eos> They don't mean anything.<eos> Yeah, well, they do to my ma.
Even Nic?<eos> You don't want Nic for yourself?<eos> Nic?<eos> No.<eos> I don't. No.
I am sorry, but we have to go.<eos> My shoes.<eos> Shit.<eos> You wish to interview me, Mr. Ahmadzai?<eos> I do, Mr. Sadiq.
"I plot to get what I want "and I end up in prison.<eos> "I dig pits to trap others and I fall in.<eos> "I should be suspicious of what I want."<eos> I don't know what that means.<eos> You do.
And Afghanistan should be on our air more, period.<eos> With the resources we have over there,<eos> Afghanistan should definitely be on our air more.<eos> But the problem is, as much as everyone loves the troops, they don't actually want to watch them on the news anymore.<eos> They just don't.
- We want to honor her life.<eos> - It's the least you could do.<eos> What's that supposed to mean?<eos> You know.<eos> No, I don't.
She just told me she got another job.<eos> Shame.<eos> I thought you guys were kind of a good team together.<eos> Mmm.<eos> So did I.
Your wife hit me on Friday night.<eos> No.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, you did.
I just need to talk to you.<eos> I don't wanna hear anything you have to say.<eos> Where's Tom?<eos> He's lying to you.<eos> He always does.
I saw you.<eos> Why did Megan get in your car?<eos> Did Megan get in your car?<eos> No!<eos> Yes, she did!
Just left us all alone...<eos> You brought this on Megan.<eos> In a way, you killed her.<eos> But I didn't.<eos> You did.
I want you to play it for me.<eos> I know the story.<eos> She was a very brave woman.<eos> I thought they wouldn't find me here.<eos> But they did.
- She has a plan.<eos> - For Christ's sake.<eos> Well, I'm not entirely happy about it either, Jimmy.<eos> - Why would you not tell her that?<eos> - I did.
- Who said anything about driving?<eos> I just assumed.<eos> It's too far to walk.<eos> So you didn't go to St Ninian's beach?<eos> No, I didn't.
Well, some of the blame is mine.<eos> I was twice his age and at least twice as sober.<eos> I should've known better.<eos> It's just... Sometimes, someone pushes your button, you know?<eos> Maybe you don't.
I wish I could hear it.<eos> Here.<eos> It be's very soft.<eos> Do you actually hear what these dreams say?<eos> Yeah, I do.
Not like it happens to me.<eos> I speak in the most terrible wigglish.<eos> Well, uh, I think you speak beautifully.<eos> You do?<eos> You really do?
It's a shame that your return is not under more festive circumstances.<eos> It is said that the Western Coven was utterly destroyed.<eos> Yes, it was.<eos> It's a blessing you escaped with your life.<eos> Well, many did not.
- And what of the Lycans?<eos> We are too far removed for them to take notice... and even if they did, our climate is quite an obstacle to warm-bloods.<eos> This coven wouldn't exist... - without your mother's grace.<eos> - You knew my mother?<eos> All vampires do, my boy. No.
Hey, yo, Jake!<eos> - I think they want you.<eos> - Everybody wants me.<eos> - Let's go, man.<eos> - I don't.
- I think they want you.<eos> - Everybody wants me.<eos> - Let's go, man.<eos> - I don't.<eos> Yeah, you do.
- Everybody wants me.<eos> - Let's go, man.<eos> - I don't.<eos> Yeah, you do.<eos> No, I don't.
Krystal's gonna be pissed 'cause we missed the pick-up.<eos> So I just need something to grease the wheels, like a peace offering.<eos> But I did the sale. It's my money.<eos> I've got it.<eos> - No. We did the sales.
So I just need something to grease the wheels, like a peace offering.<eos> But I did the sale. It's my money.<eos> I've got it.<eos> - No. We did the sales.<eos> - No, I did the sale.
-And who did we just track?<eos> Not who, what.<eos> We're targeting bad guys' cell phones. Sometimes a SIM card.<eos> Okay. And how do we know the bad guy is in possession of the bad cell phone?<eos> We don't. - Of course we do.
Does that mean you're willing to go back and face trial?<eos> Absolutely. If it was a fair and public trial.<eos> Unfortunately that's not what would happen right now as long as the Espionage Act is being used against whistleblowers.<eos> Do you still think it was worth it?<eos> -Yes, I do.
Well, it matters because... if you're going to give up your dream.<eos> I think it matters that you like what you're playing on the road for years.<eos> Do you like the music that I play?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I do.
Oh, excuse me.<eos> I'm carrying a dead body and I have his schwantz in my face.<eos> So, I'm sorry I'm not Bakishnarov.<eos> You can't even say Baryshnikov.<eos> You did, didn't you?
And the idea was that we were gonna, you know, like make this experimental film, like an artistic film.<eos> - Porno film.<eos> - It's not a porno.<eos> Look, do you even know who my mother is?<eos> Yes, we do.
Yeah.<eos> Well, that guy said he was going for a drink.<eos> You take the roof bar.<eos> I'll take downstairs.<eos> - Well done, kiddo.
Well, Gena?<eos> Wait a bit.<eos> I'm selecting the right patch.<eos> Hack, you hacker.<eos> Done.
For any decision to be made, you need 50 % plus one share.<eos> -So, Novikov?<eos> -Absolutely right.<eos> Did Novikov have any conflicts with the shareholders?<eos> No, he didn't.
Get your things and get out from my house.<eos> I won't go anywhere.<eos> Okay.<eos> I'm calling the police.<eos> Please do.
Svetlova.<eos> Our secretary.<eos> Dasha, come to my office.<eos> Mr. Guskov, didn't you arrive at 11:15 PM to Novikova's house?<eos> Yes, I did.
To synthesize the preparation and understand its influence on me.<eos> Why did you slander psychiatrist Kuleshov?<eos> His real name is Salamatin, he is the father of Polina, who suffered from the doings of Professor.<eos> And he keeps her in a glass dome in some shelter.<eos> Yes, he does!
Julius Caesar in the corner.<eos> He's read it all.<eos> He knows every battle ever fought.<eos> - Does he know about the real thing?<eos> - None of us do.
And there's a road splitting it in two.<eos> We're wide open.<eos> Okay.<eos> Do we have shovels?<eos> We do.
The United Nations went from peacekeeping to peace enforcement.<eos> And your mission has failed.<eos> Did you forget about your fellow Irishmen left out in the field?<eos> What do you mean?<eos> Because I didn't.
And I'm detecting traces of neutronium, the critical ingredient required for creating a controlled black hole.<eos> Which is the only thing capable of rupturing the space-time continuum.<eos> And you know what that means!<eos> No.<eos> I don't, Donnie.
Even if that price is our souls?<eos> That won't happen.<eos> We won't let that happen.<eos> We have to trust in this.<eos> In this I do.
I understood why she felt like that.<eos> You understood it but filed a countersuit against her.<eos> Did that help diffuse her outrage?<eos> No.<eos> It didn't.
Any case, there's nothing else to do.<eos> We're out of witnesses.<eos> We're done.<eos> I want to call Naz.<eos> No, you don't.
Oh, we've heard.<eos> A lot of foreplay, too?<eos> No.<eos> She didn't want a lot of that.<eos> She didn't.
Andrea.<eos> Tragic death.<eos> Nice girl by all accounts.<eos> I mean, she had her personal problems, but who doesn't?<eos> You do.
Well, Aquaspin agrees with you.<eos> They're concerned about ticket sales.<eos> What? But it's an 18,000 seat place.<eos> Nobody sells that out.<eos> Hammerleg did last week.
No, I didn't do it, or did I?<eos> No, I didn't, or maybe I did not do it.<eos> Did you? I didn't do it, or I did.<eos> Who knows?<eos> I don't.
Excuse me.<eos> Can somebody move?<eos> Mariah Carey, your hair smells and looks great.<eos> Did you know Aquaspin has hair dryers and flat irons?<eos> No, I didn't.
I'm comin', I'm comin'.<eos> - Oh, Jesus!<eos> - Oh, patch him up.<eos> I'm not Shed, I don't know what I'm doing.<eos> - Neither did he.
Not enough fuel!<eos> We die for sure.<eos> That's your problem, not mine.<eos> How do you know what's waiting at those coordinates?<eos> - I don't.
The lift had to be down!<eos> Wait for me.<eos> They'll feed us their vile apricot chicken.<eos> The Vaunoy cook very well.<eos> Sure they do...
Hi, Dad, I'm sleeping.<eos> I know. I know, OK.<eos> Go back to sleep.<eos> Dad, did you get my card?<eos> I did.
Yes, sir.<eos> Shut up.<eos> You know, I've seen a school of sharks tear a boat to pieces like it was made of cardboard, because some kid threw a band-aid in the water.<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> Yeah, he did.
You know, I've seen a school of sharks tear a boat to pieces like it was made of cardboard, because some kid threw a band-aid in the water.<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> Yeah, he did.<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> No, you didn't.
You want to keep it down, you fucking morons?<eos> My kids are sleeping.<eos> I am so sorry. I mean...<eos> Lee, you want to get these fucking pinheads out of my house please?<eos> Yeah, I do.
Okay, Minnetonka, Minnesota. Same difference.<eos> What about my mother?<eos> The judge would never let that happen.<eos> And anyway, no one knows where she is.<eos> I do.
Hey.<eos> You made all that?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes.<eos> We did it... together.
Come see.<eos> Get you ass off the hammock now.<eos> I will throw you out, if this continues.<eos> Did you order from the Venus catalog again?<eos> No, I didn't.
Let me ask you somethin', okay?<eos> Just in the world and life, what do you need a barrel that long for?<eos> Great question.<eos> How 'bout it's two o'clock in the morning and some methed-out lunatic is trying to break into your house to rape and murder your kids?<eos> What do you do then?
Oh, I doubt that.<eos> I wanna talk to the boy again.<eos> And I wanna live forever.<eos> I had to ask.<eos> You did.
You've had your time.<eos> Now let another rule.<eos> I heard you lost your mind during a storm on the Jade Sea.<eos> They tied you to the mast to keep you from jumping overboard.<eos> They did.
He will not leave this to the voters.<eos> He does not believe in the American system.<eos> Angel, believe in me.<eos> I can make this happen.<eos> We do.
Our boy is gonna get himself killed.<eos> I'm unarmed.<eos> You know this lunatic, Dante?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I do.
- I'm not fuckin' around.<eos> I need to know.<eos> Do you need to know or does your husband?<eos> You know I hate it when you call her that.<eos> Course I do.
I read your book.<eos> - What is it?<eos> - An incredible text on terrorism.<eos> - You never mentioned it.<eos> - What? Sure I did.
I said that because I want you and Little Sam to be safe.<eos> That's all I want-- to become a maester so I can help Jon when the time comes so you'll be safe.<eos> Us and everyone else in the world.<eos> I don't care about them.<eos> Well, no, I do, but I don't really.
I don't care about them.<eos> Well, no, I do, but I don't really.<eos> I care about you and him.<eos> I know that, Sam.<eos> And he does, too.
Innocent games.<eos> Fun games.<eos> Drinking games.<eos> We do not drink.<eos> Until you do.
Why would Steve do something like this?<eos> Wait, does he think he stopped growing?<eos> Yeah, that's right.<eos> I know what this is about.<eos> You do?
Well, you know, there are some other candidates to hear, Bunny.<eos> - Hmm?<eos> - Some more.<eos> - Do you know any of them?<eos> - I do.
I just think that both you and Barbara stand to benefit.<eos> Besides, I'm terrified no-one will come.<eos> Hello, Phyllis.<eos> - Ooh, do you want to join Trixie's new Keep Fit class?<eos> - I do not.
Me clothes are soaked.<eos> Would you, erm, fetch me mac for me, so's I can go out through the hall?<eos> Of course.<eos> Has this happened to you before?<eos> Well, it does, doesn't it, to women?
Your daughter is welcome to lodge here with us.<eos> I think that's a most suitable suggestion.<eos> So do I.<eos> I don't know...<eos> I do.
Everything is perfectly clear.<eos> Could I buy you a cup of tea?<eos> We've a great deal to do and no time for tea.<eos> I shan't ask you a thing about it but you don't have to pretend nothing's happened.<eos> We all do that too much of the time.
Thinks she'll make her sick again.<eos> I keep telling her she won't, but don't make no difference.<eos> Jeanette don't care about her being a carrier.<eos> She just wants her Nana Meg back.<eos> We all do.
No need to scrub those poor hands till they bleed.<eos> I'm always going to have it, aren't I?<eos> Meg...<eos> I know what typhoid can cost a family.<eos> I really do.
Look, you can run all you like, but it won't go away!<eos> We love each other, don't we?<eos> You said you loved me, when we did it.<eos> And I meant it.<eos> I really did.
It hasn't been baptised.<eos> I should've baptised it myself.<eos> You don't have to be a priest to christen a baby, did you know that?<eos> No.<eos> I didn't.
But leave it till tomorrow.<eos> I'm not drunk, Mr Hereward.<eos> Giving up something you really want is hard.<eos> I know that.<eos> You do?
Was it a girl?<eos> Yes.<eos> I knew.<eos> Always knew.<eos> Yes. Yes, you did.
I wished so hard for her.<eos> Maybe I shouldn't have.<eos> Maybe I'm being punished.<eos> - But God knows I love my boys...<eos> - He does.
Just take him.<eos> He's yours.<eos> I'm a mum, Mum.<eos> And I don't even know where to start.<eos> You just did.
- Are you coming with us?<eos> I shall be following behind, just to be on the safe side.<eos> But you don't need me -- you've got him.<eos> You really have -- and he knows how to take care of his family.<eos> Yes, I do.
"Bullcrap" ain't a curse, man.<eos> I don't curse.<eos> - [imitating Luke] "I don't curse." - [laughs]<eos> You don't cut hair either, negro.<eos> Like, really, what do you do up in here, bruh?
I'm guilty of a lot of things that people will never know about.<eos> I guess it's karma's way of reminding me... that she can be a bitch.<eos> You should tell the group that.<eos> You really do care, don't you?<eos> I do.
Hell... even the Koreans.<eos> All loyal.<eos> We're all good.<eos> So... when do I get my Judas?<eos> You don't.
So, this Luke Cage was a bartender at Harlem's Paradise?<eos> Actually, I believe he was the dishwasher.<eos> He was filling in for Dante that night.<eos> One man is linked to a criminal, the death of four people, the destruction of a restaurant, and you don't find him suspicious?<eos> Of course I do.
What I do is more like CrossFit.<eos> Always full of surprises.<eos> And I hate that.<eos> I don't know shit about you.<eos> Nobody does.
Is that normal?<eos> As long as you stay on the clock, it doesn't matter.<eos> The secret to every great lie is it has to run parallel to the truth.<eos> Every moment wasted brings you one step closer to jail.<eos> So what do we do?
- I didn't screw anybody.<eos> Come on, now.<eos> You don't deserve to represent the people of New York, let alone protect them.<eos> That's not true and you know it.<eos> I do.
This stops now!<eos> This stops now!<eos> This stops now!<eos> Yes, it does.<eos> Yes, it does.
-You are not listening to me.<eos> Luke Cage is innocent of everything.<eos> And after we have him in custody, we'll verify it.<eos> Look... I trust you.<eos> I do.
You can take a seat.<eos> Mr. Cage.<eos> My name is Inspector Priscilla Ridley.<eos> You realize there is a warrant still out for your arrest.<eos> I do.
- I had to take her.<eos> - Where is she?<eos> She disappeared.<eos> Did she say anything?<eos> Yeah, she did.
As far as I know. That's all I have.<eos> Otomo patched up his prison in "Evernow," and check out what was just recorded in a high school three miles from here.<eos> I called your new hit woman, and I sent the team in to back her up.<eos> I'm at Union Wells High School... That's all very good, but if Tommy has seen this, we need to send Otomo.<eos> I already did.
- We need a picture of the three of us.<eos> - Yeah!<eos> - Oh, no, no, no.<eos> - Come on now.<eos> Yeah, we do.
NO, I-I like it. I...<eos> I was imagining Charlie dancing in her dress.<eos> Do you dance, Mr. Church?<eos> There are those who play music... and there are those who dance to it.<eos> And the rare person who does both.
These stores are expensive.<eos> Let me.<eos> I'll never have a child of my own.<eos> You don't know that.<eos> No, I do.
She said, "Stay here with us."<eos> She said, "We don't have much, but everything we got..."<eos> we'll share with you."<eos> And did he stay?<eos> He did.
Because for the first time, he felt safe.<eos> For the first time, he wasn't afraid.<eos> He felt happy-<eos> And he promised that if he ever saw... that ladybug again... that he was going to thank her.<eos> Did he?
Here's the top of the vagina, and there's the balls.<eos> It's starting, you guys!<eos> None of us are safe anymore!<eos> I didn't know vaginas had balls.<eos> Yeah, no, they do.
Can my father and I please have the room?<eos> Father, you need to send this Druid away.<eos> People are starting to talk, they don't understand why you're under his thrall.<eos> You mean you don't understand.<eos> No, I don't!
And when she asked for my blessing, I refused.<eos> Because she didn't love an Elf?<eos> Because she loved you, Allanon.<eos> I thought she understood that there was no future for us.<eos> Well, evidently, she didn't.
Here.<eos> What's this?<eos> The speech.<eos> I wrote it.<eos> I did the speech for you.
She's back to normal.<eos> - "She's back to normal"?<eos> - What?<eos> Kaminski said "She's back to normal".<eos> Did he now?
Did you enjoy yourself?<eos> Did you enjoy taking her virginity?<eos> Did you enjoy making her a woman?<eos> - Did you?<eos> Did you?
- You've broken confidences.<eos> - Only when I thought it necessary.<eos> - I can't break the rules like you do.<eos> - I don't break the rules!<eos> - Yes, you do.
What about last night?<eos> What about it?<eos> Did you see Chloe last night?<eos> Jesus, Adam?<eos> No... I didn't.
What you think you're gonna achieve?<eos> Patronizing me, you fucking hypocrite.<eos> What are you on about, Travis?<eos> See, I know what you're up to.<eos> - Do you?
I wanted to know about Gillian.<eos> Why would you ask about that?<eos> - You know what happened.<eos> - No, no, I don't know.<eos> Yes, you do.
I think she was selling for someone.<eos> It would help us if you answered the question, Miss Macy.<eos> How did you know it was ecstasy?<eos> Doctor.<eos> I didn't.
It's vital that I see him.<eos> I need to get a blood sample.<eos> I'm not supposed to give out addresses.<eos> There's lots of things that aren't supposed to happen here,<eos> Sandra, but they do.
Nobody knows.<eos> My family was threatened and now my daughter's dead. Come on, come inside.<eos> It must be someone who knows what's up there. What we've done.<eos> No one knows.<eos> Grayson does.
You can see here, the indentation on the head, neck, and lower spine.<eos> Weapon?<eos> Some kind of angled iron.<eos> Maybe a part of a machine or ... - So basically you don't know<eos> - No, I don't
Don't. Be happy for me.<eos> What do you really want, Barbara?<eos> I want to know what happened to Chloe.<eos> I'm sorry. Of course you do.<eos> We all do... We all...
So?<eos> More than half the town believes in spaceships.<eos> But you don't believe she did it?<eos> No.<eos> I don't.
No one can understand the pain.<eos> Renae ... It's Chloe's funeral today.<eos> Roy should have stood by you, all those years ago, that's the truth of the matter.<eos> He had his faults.<eos> We all do.
Watch out now.<eos> Huntington's gonna fire you, you don't fall in line.<eos> Why?<eos> Because I won't blow myself up?<eos> Did four clean sweeps today.
John Campbell cannot afford the political fallout of my death.<eos> - He will pay.<eos> - He's brought the cavalry onto us.<eos> And they have Indian trackers, who are going to find us.<eos> - And when they do...
- He will pay.<eos> - He's brought the cavalry onto us.<eos> And they have Indian trackers, who are going to find us.<eos> - And when they do...<eos> - If they do.
He's killed Delaney.<eos> He'll kill Durant, too.<eos> We both know what he's capable of.<eos> You saw him take out a man's eye.<eos> I did.
How many times have you told your patients that just because they make one mistake doesn't mean they have to make two?<eos> Hundreds of times, darling.<eos> But I talk to prisoners.<eos> They rarely listen.<eos> - And when they do?
- I-I don't want her worrying about me.<eos> - Like you could ever stop her?<eos> But I, uh... I understand.<eos> You know how much I care about you, Maura?<eos> - I do.
Come on, Vince.<eos> Who doesn't love a gondola?<eos> Ma, she could get seasick.<eos> You never know.<eos> - Does she?
- Yeah.<eos> But, um... dropping everything and jetting off to Europe...<eos> I don't know why, but... it's hard for me imagining myself getting carried away like that.<eos> - I know why.<eos> - You do?
Oh, I love them.<eos> You told the cops you and I went out for burgers last night, right?<eos> Hmm?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Mm-hmm. You did, huh?
I would expect so, Your Honor, barring any acts of God or further child-care crisises from Ms. Clark.<eos> Your Honor.<eos> I am offended by Mr. Cochran's remarks, as a woman and as a mother.<eos> Mr. Cochran may not know what it's like to work a 70-hour work week and also take care of a family, but I do.<eos> And many other people do, too.
You'll never hear another word about it.<eos> I handled it.<eos> Baby, you knew all that about me when we got married.<eos> Yeah, I knew it, Johnnie, but my friends didn't.<eos> My family didn't.
I handled it.<eos> Baby, you knew all that about me when we got married.<eos> Yeah, I knew it, Johnnie, but my friends didn't.<eos> My family didn't.<eos> My pastor didn't, Johnnie.
We're done.<eos> We've been dealt a king and a ten.<eos> I don't know why you want to ask the dealer for another card.<eos> Because I know it's an ace.<eos> No, you don't!
Oh, let me rephrase.<eos> Other than the two victims, did this incredibly precise DNA matching show anyone else's blood and DNA at the scene of the murders?<eos> It did, uh, just one individual.<eos> And does this same DNA match the blood you found on the back gate at Bundy?<eos> Yes, it does.
This is about winning this case.<eos> What is your idea?<eos> Another plea bargain?<eos> If Marcia Clark cross-examines him, it will be an unmitigated disaster, and you know it.<eos> What if we do a mock-cross?
These tapes will allow Mr. Simpson to walk free.<eos> Well, let's not get... too cocky.<eos> I mean, we haven't heard them.<eos> Look, lucky breaks don't just fall from the sky.<eos> Oh, yes, they do, Mr. Scheck.
That's what gets us to the planted glove.<eos> Now, look, I appreciate your passion.<eos> But we've been hired to defend a client, not to burn down a city.<eos> Now, I'm sorry that you're disappointed, and I understand...<eos> No, you don't!
She was running away from the man who said he'd kill her.<eos> She saw the explosion coming.<eos> Why else fill a safe-deposit box with threatening letters from the defendant, a will and police photos of past beatings?<eos> She knew that the bomb could go off at any second.<eos> And then it did.
Your hair, everything.<eos> Beautiful.<eos> Do you know where he is?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, I do.
Churchill is the go-between but it's against government policy so everything must be kept a secret.<eos> You know it's begun.<eos> They started the business tonight.<eos> No.<eos> I didn't.
You're a much better talker than Theon Greyjoy.<eos> That so?<eos> I had to work hard to get him talking.<eos> But he talked.<eos> They all do.
His father's dead.<eos> Ramsay killed him.<eos> - And now he has Rickon.<eos> - We don't know that.<eos> Yes, we do.
They remember the Stark name.<eos> People will still risk everything for it, from White Harbor to Ramsay's own door.<eos> I don't doubt it.<eos> But Jon doesn't have the Stark name.<eos> No, but I do.
I wonder if you're the worst person I've ever met.<eos> At a certain age, it's hard to recall.<eos> But the truly vile do stand out through the years.<eos> Do you remember the way you smirked at me when my grandson and granddaughter were dragged off to their cells?<eos> I do.
They don't believe in your Seven.<eos> They're from the Brotherhood. They follow the Red God.<eos> Aye, well, all are welcome here.<eos> Anyway, we got nothing for them.<eos> Sure, you do.
Fight them?<eos> Kill them?<eos> It'd be you against all of them.<eos> I mean, these people don't know how to fight.<eos> You do.
Where will you go?<eos> Essos is east and Westeros is west.<eos> But what's west of Westeros?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Nobody does.
Trust me, if my soup didn't kill you, nothing will.<eos> Thing about Gatins, right, is he used to be pretty.<eos> I was a famous kisser.<eos> You lads know how to kiss proper?<eos> Course we do.
I was your sister's prisoner once.<eos> She hit me on the head with a rock if I remember correctly.<eos> Yeah.<eos> She should have killed you.<eos> Perhaps, but she didn't.
As long as he lives, Ramsay's claim to Winterfell will be contested, which means he won't live long.<eos> We can't give up on our brother.<eos> Listen to me, please.<eos> He wants you to make a mistake.<eos> Of course he does.
I take full responsibility for my many sins and unburden myself of my desires.<eos> My only remaining wish is to devote my life to the Seven.<eos> May I be a living example of their grace for others to witness.<eos> You understand fully what this means?<eos> I do.
Can my father and I please have the room?<eos> Father, you need to send this Druid away.<eos> People are starting to talk, they don't understand why you're under his thrall.<eos> You mean you don't understand.<eos> No, I don't!
And when she asked for my blessing, I refused.<eos> Because she didn't love an Elf?<eos> Because she loved you, Allanon.<eos> I thought she understood that there was no future for us.<eos> Well, evidently, she didn't.
It happened when I hit the water.<eos> I floated downstream, and it slammed into this jagged rock.<eos> Thought I was going to drown.<eos> Do you think he made it?<eos> Of course he did.
Come on.<eos> Fancy meeting you here.<eos> Elf Hunters, huh?<eos> Do you know anything, or not?<eos> Of course, I do.
You wanna move in together?<eos> -Yeah.<eos> -Yeah.<eos> -I mean, do you?<eos> Do you--
Last one.<eos> Do you know where it is?<eos> The armor?<eos> No.<eos> No, I don't.
What are they singing?<eos> It's beautiful.<eos> Many say the song's about what happens when we die.<eos> How we don't just disappear.<eos> We don't?
You're talking about me in the past tense.<eos> Look, I didn't know what to expect coming here.<eos> I mean, when I saw you the other night, you seemed different.<eos> Well, you just said I seemed good.<eos> You do, okay?
That's no life.<eos> Julieta, we're all doing as well as we can.<eos> Do you know what it would cost to put your mother in a nursing home?<eos> I thought you hired a woman to care for her.<eos> Sana'a does.
Come with me.<eos> - Did you find him?<eos> - We're close.<eos> - You know you don't have to do this.<eos> - Yes, I do.
We have to move it.<eos> Wait.<eos> It's been cut down.<eos> Bellamy: You don't know that.<eos> We do now.
Fuck!<eos> What am I doing, Ray?<eos> I don't know how to be a husband.<eos> No.<eos> No, you don't.
Yeah!<eos> Here it is, paid in full:<eos> one year's rent.<eos> Free rent for a year! We did it!<eos> We did it! Free rent for...
- We don't need that.<eos> - I'm on the pill.<eos> - Cool.<eos> You can't have a boy in your bed.<eos> - You do.
Like taking bricks out of the wall of your fucking house.<eos> - Do you want to bring the house down, Arthur? - Ah...<eos> If you're soft on rebellion, it'll grow.<eos> Bloody "soft on rebellion".<eos> You did the right thing, John.
- Oh, shut up.<eos> - Bad luck...<eos> - Shut up.<eos> How do we know this foolish man will hand over the diamonds - when we're done?<eos> - We don't.
No, honestly, it's all right.<eos> Vodka!<eos> I sewed your buttons back on.<eos> I wanted to see if I did a good job.<eos> Yeah, you did.
Big whoop.<eos> You got me. I'm cool.<eos> It's all good.<eos> I said I'd catch him.<eos> And I did.
Besides, I thought your chat with Dr. Thompkins would keep you occupied.<eos> And I thought you were against therapy.<eos> Well, that's before I realized you're so keen on keeping secrets.<eos> If I had told you what Selina and I had planned, you would have stopped me.<eos> Because I didn't,
You told me it was over, Jim.<eos> You swore to me.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I knew in my heart that it wasn't, but I let you lie to me.<eos> I didn't.
I know what you're doing.<eos> Alfred told me everything.<eos> He shouldn't have done that.<eos> I understand how you feel.<eos> No, you don't.
He shouldn't have done that.<eos> I understand how you feel.<eos> No, you don't.<eos> No, you're right.<eos> I don't.
Walk away in a huff?<eos> Now I know you know something.<eos> If you're providing aid and shelter to Jim Gordon, anything-- a glass of water-- I will bust you like a bum I never met.<eos> Cap, I wish I knew where he was.<eos> But I don't.
Smart girl.<eos> Oh, you're an animal, Bullock,<eos> - you know that?<eos> - Oh, yes, ma'am.<eos> I do, I do.
Ah...<eos> Stumbled onto a mugging.<eos> And Jim Gordon couldn't just walk by.<eos> Where'd you sleep?<eos> I didn't.
Whoever it was, he covered his tracks well.<eos> But I have something.<eos> A recording of his first call to I.A.<eos> I.A. secretly records everyone who calls in.<eos> They do?
Right, so you were framed for the murder of that other police officer.<eos> You escaped from prison, you then tracked down the man that framed you and you were promptly shot in the leg.<eos> Right, so, answer me this, Detective.<eos> Do you have any idea how you're gonna get out of this awful pickle?<eos> Yes, I do.
I said, where's The Lady?<eos> ! No one knows!<eos> Wrong answer.<eos> Someone knows.<eos> I don't.
- Oh, boy.<eos> All right, listen. The case may not be quite as urgent as once thought.<eos> Um... I dug it up out of my desk so you'd have something to do on weekends because you seemed so lonely.<eos> - You cited chatter from the streets that Garibaldi had resurfaced.<eos> - I did. I did. I did.
I brought him in last month.<eos> - Hey, Detective Boyle.<eos> - Hi, Isaac.<eos> The only good thing is, now this whole trio doesn't have to work together anymore.<eos> Yes it does.
Gina, hey, how's the stalling?<eos> Great; the tow truck just got here, so that'll buy us at least an hour.<eos> Tow truck? What the hell did you do to my car?<eos> Bitch, I told you I was gonna wreck it.<eos> You did.
I'm sure Diaz gets it.<eos> She's so in touch with her feelings.<eos> And me, hmm.<eos> After what I've seen, after what I've done, I don't know that I deserve to be happy.<eos> Of course you do.
- But I would be honored.<eos> - Thank God.<eos> - I'm gonna kiss you now.<eos> - Oh, you don't have to.<eos> - Already did it.
Here we go.<eos> What the hell?<eos> We agreed you weren't gonna do that.<eos> You disobeyed a direct order from your handler.<eos> Yeah, I did.
Some cats just don't take to their new family.<eos> When I met your father, I hoped it would work out.<eos> I know it's stupid, but sometimes I feel like my dad's looking out for me through the cat.<eos> You miss him.<eos> I do.
with me?<eos> Really?<eos> [Abbie] Yeah.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I do.
You know, I'm recovering from cervical cancer.<eos> I know.<eos> Your hair smells good.<eos> I make my own shampoo.<eos> Of course you do.
I know it's confusing.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I can... I can help you get over that.<eos> I don't want to get over that.<eos> Yes, you do.
- You what?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I invited Carl to watch the DePaul game with us tonight.<eos> - I told you.<eos> - No, you didn't.
- Yeah.<eos> I invited Carl to watch the DePaul game with us tonight.<eos> - I told you.<eos> - No, you didn't.<eos> Yes, I did.
Killing someone.<eos> Wow.<eos> Pretty sure that would be illegal.<eos> What, are you trying to rip me off?<eos> I already did, you moron.
Let's go. Nobody wants you here, Frank, just go.<eos> I'm your father.<eos> I may not have always been a great one, but I'm still your father and I'm gonna walk you down that fucking aisle.<eos> Do we have a problem?<eos> Uh, no, we don't.
Who cares about the teachers?<eos> The students like you. Don't they?<eos> The students.<eos> See? They like you, right?<eos> No, they don't.
That's what I'm talking about!<eos> - Eat shit, Belinda Brown!<eos> - Did you see that?<eos> You see how it just went everywhere?<eos> Fuck yes, I did.
They're happy together.<eos> They've been going out for four years.<eos> What? !<eos> You knew about this?<eos> Sure, everyone did.
Okay, me too.<eos> Got it?<eos> Oh, my bladder is quivering.<eos> Do you know Steve Jobs stunk and cried all the time?<eos> I did not.
Come on.<eos> Holy shit!<eos> Yes, Neal!<eos> Twelve o'clock!<eos> Holy shit! I did it!
What's that mean?<eos> Jesus, you're the most clueless pet owner I've ever known.<eos> No wonder the fucking thing ran away.<eos> - Did you remember to give it a thing called "cat food"?<eos> Yes, sir, I did.
I... I'm sure we will cross paths again.<eos> Okay.<eos> They just killed me off the show.<eos> - What?<eos> They did? - Yeah, they did.
Would anyone notice straight away?<eos> Not if I was clever about it.<eos> Ah, well, luckily you are clever, Jonathan. 'Cos I checked.<eos> Did you?<eos> Course you did.
They're my father's.<eos> It's private.<eos> Oh, sorry.<eos> I didn't realise it meant that much to you.<eos> Yes, you did.
What do you want, Ms Burr?<eos> I want to make you an offer.<eos> Come and work for me... and afterwards when it's all over, I will look after you.<eos> Resettlement, new name, new identity, new life.<eos> An offer to do what?
Do you think I should tell her?<eos> Maybe.<eos> If it's worry for your boy, forget it.<eos> He knew what he was getting into.<eos> Did he?
- I'm going to get you out of here.<eos> I promise.<eos> I took a photograph of your list on my phone.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Why on earth did you do that?
- You're a good man, Joel.<eos> - Yeah, I know.<eos> The convoy has been identified and is being tracked by US military satellites.<eos> - You want a visual?<eos> - 'Course I do.
Shit on a biscuit!<eos> Colorful language.<eos> You've always been good with words.<eos> Don't act like you know me.<eos> Oh, but I do.
Thank you, Arlene.<eos> I need to talk to you about Ann Rutledge.<eos> Do you have any idea... how much danger you're in?<eos> So you believe me?<eos> Yes, I do.
What do you say we get out of here and get some much needed RR?<eos> We got a few weeks before we head out.<eos> I got us a gig in Kiev for, uh... Harold Rolston.<eos> We don't work for Reuters.<eos> Yeah, well, we do now.
I doubt that.<eos> We all know people, Damien.<eos> Ann Rutledge.<eos> You know her?<eos> I do.
They said it was an accident.<eos> Be careful, Damien.<eos> I've seen more than my fair share in my day.<eos> Not much surprises or frightens me.<eos> Ann Rutledge does both.
We can't put a gun to his head and just say, "Bring about the apocalypse."<eos> There are very mysterious forces at work.<eos> I brought you in.<eos> Remember, Ann?<eos> Oh, I do, John.
Do you want to go see Alice? I'm here.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Well...<eos> I can't keep coming around.<eos> Then, don't.
You're not just gonna let her walk out of here?<eos> Shut up.<eos> Hey, Miss Nobody.<eos> Did you really think that I was gonna let you leave?<eos> No, actually, I didn't.
Well, you're too old to be slinging drinks, so...<eos> Thank you.<eos> You know how to reach me?<eos> No one knows how to reach you.<eos> - He does.
Thank you.<eos> You know how to reach me?<eos> No one knows how to reach you.<eos> - He does.<eos> - Yeah, I do.
Don't disparage yourself, Fedya none of us will believe it anyway.<eos> Then I'd better say nothing about myself at all.<eos> How is your mazurka coming along, Natasha?<eos> Well, we thought we were doing very well, until Denisov told us we were doing it all wrong.<eos> - You did.
You will.<eos> But will I?<eos> I'm sorry, Nikki, I just don't like him.<eos> Why on Earth not?<eos> Everyone else does.
The marshal there, Count Rostov, has failed to produce half the men required of him.<eos> The army still needs to be maintained, even in this time of so called peace.<eos> Rostov needs someone to ginger him up a bit.<eos> Do you know the man, at all?<eos> - No, I don't.
Say no, and I'll go to Petersburg, and never bother you again.<eos> But...<eos> Do you think you could love me?<eos> Yes. Yes, I could.<eos> Yes, I do.
Well... people can change.<eos> I suppose you think I've changed.<eos> I don't know.<eos> I remember we had, uh, a few laughs in college, but it's been a while.<eos> Oh, yes, we did.
What ideas?<eos> No, tell me.<eos> Tell me.<eos> You know just as well as I do, Ken.<eos> No, I don't.
Well, I was up for tenure, again, and I didn't get it, again.<eos> Aerospace positions are difficult to come by.<eos> Norah was on the selection committee, and I was upset.<eos> Why, she didn't vote for you?<eos> As a matter of fact, no, she didn't.
No way.<eos> That's nine.<eos> Nine?<eos> I know what it is.<eos> Oh, you do, do you?
Care to put your money where your mouth is, memory queen?<eos> - Okay. 100 bucks.<eos> - All right, done.<eos> You got it.<eos> - Done.
Okay, so check it, boss.<eos> I got a search warrant for Rhonda's personal computer.<eos> - Mm-hmm. - I remotely accessed it, and it's got mostly personal stuff on it except for one large protected file, heavily encrypted.<eos> Yeah, but you cracked it, right?<eos> - Of course I did.
Oh, come on.<eos> You know you want it.<eos> You're in over your head, cop.<eos> Trust me, you don't wanna do this.<eos> As a matter of fact, we do.
I can tell you've got something.<eos> Yeah.<eos> You are not gonna believe this.<eos> Look, now, I spent the whole day on Gibson Rowan's computer.<eos> He definitely did Barton's murder.
Hold on, Reverend.<eos> I didn't come to see the boy.<eos> Not to help, at least. I came 'cause...<eos> I don't really know.<eos> Sure you do.
Excuse me?<eos> You want me to watch your kids the entire day?<eos> Well, what...<eos> Well, I don't think that this really falls under my job description.<eos> Well, it does today, Mr. Russell.
What's the urgency?<eos> Well, I think you're going to be needing this.<eos> What are you up to now?<eos> You have every right to live any life you wish.<eos> We all do.
- Yeah?<eos> What's holding your attention on this little screen?<eos> Uh, here, look.<eos> I could send you the clip if you want it.<eos> Yeah, you do that.
Ellen, for goodness sakes, turn down the drama.<eos> The neighbors are gonna think someone's dying over here.<eos> Daddy!<eos> Hey, don't suppose any of you kids want any ice cream, do you?<eos> - I do!
The neighbors are gonna think someone's dying over here.<eos> Daddy!<eos> Hey, don't suppose any of you kids want any ice cream, do you?<eos> - I do!<eos> - You do?
Right there.<eos> - That's the sound of victory.<eos> - Jimmy, stop selling.<eos> And don't act like you don't see the problem here.<eos> - I don't.
- Yes.<eos> A few days ago.<eos> - And you didn't say anything to anyone?<eos> No.<eos> I didn't.
That's great!<eos> Please let me be there when you tell Howard. Please.<eos> So why the sad puppy eyes?<eos> What, you don't want that job?<eos> No, no, of course I do.
Yeah.<eos> Do you like it?<eos> If you're happy, I'm happy.<eos> Do you like it?<eos> Yeah. I do.
But I am Kim Wexler, attorney at law, and you are Jimmy McGill, attorney at law.<eos> Both free to practice as we see fit.<eos> Separate firms under one roof.<eos> We're both headed uptown, so why can't we share a taxi?<eos> You do things your way and I do them mine.
Maybe you needed better teachers.<eos> That could be.<eos> Can I do the drill now?<eos> - You promised. - Oh.<eos> I did, didn't I?
He sabotaged me.<eos> Buddy, what are you, uh...<eos> Please. Don't bother.<eos> You and I both know ‭exactly what I'm talking about.<eos> I don't.
Two flats means you take every second letter, beginning at the start of the section.<eos> Three sharps means you take every third letter, beginning at the end.<eos> Does it make sense?<eos> Aye.<eos> Aye, it does.
A word with ye, Uncle.<eos> Listen, lad, I ken ye're trying to do what ye think is best, but I was teaching men to fight while you were still sucking your mother's tit, God rest her.<eos> So I think I know a wee bit more about this than you do.<eos> No.<eos> No, you don't.
My client is a loving family man.<eos> And three: He is innocent.<eos> Deandra Reynolds, you were the one that told the police that Bill had spiked the punch with bath salts.<eos> That's correct. But you didn't actually see him do it, did you?<eos> No, I did not.
With shrimp...<eos> Just a sec.<eos> Go ahead. -Shrimp, galangal, coriander seeds... Remember the scarf?<eos> It was knotted, on the pillow, and you said: "Look! They've even tied the knot!"<eos> I did?
He looked just as confused when I told him I got into university.<eos> But he confused me the most when he caught Relu smoking.<eos> I don't know if I told you...<eos> Relu the rebel?<eos> No, you didn't.
- Go get the file.<eos> Is Big Man okay?<eos> - It's, uh, it's Amituana.<eos> - You know, he's a member of the Samoan royal family.<eos> - Huh. No, I didn't.
-Not what you'd expect.<eos> Noisy. Um... lonely.<eos> No privacy.<eos> You know, my wife's gone.<eos> - No, I didn't. - Mm-hmm.
Because you don't know that the Boyd brothers can't be in the presence of anyone from Captain Moulton's crew.<eos> 'Cause you don't know which of the street merchants is in the pocket of the brothel madam.<eos> You don't know.<eos> You don't know... you don't know.<eos> But I do.
But wherever we land, Anne and I will be taken care of.<eos> Taken care of?<eos> How?<eos> You set aside some of the gold?<eos> She did.
She's not to be underestimated.<eos> Spain. What did you have to promise them?<eos> That I would secure the remains of the Urca De Lima's gold and return it to Havana.<eos> You set aside some of the gold?<eos> - She did.
It's just someone's notes. Fragments.<eos> Is there anything of value in it?<eos> Not unless we have an interest in invading Nassau, which I don't think we do.<eos> Do we?<eos> No, we don't.
And at the moment, the only thing the law wants with Jack Rackham and Anne Bonny is their necks in nooses.<eos> To have that protection, we'll need to assume new identities.<eos> So we change our names for a bit.<eos> - Who gives a shit?<eos> A little bit. I do.
Will you inform her of our suspicions about the source of the leak?<eos> Davis...<eos> Davis, you remember the time the captain...<eos> Do you know him?<eos> I do not.
Now, if you and I are to lead these men together, you must learn to know its presence well<eos> so that you may use it...<eos> Rather than it use you.<eos> You have some experience with this, I imagine, living in fear of such a thing within you?<eos> Yeah, I do.
We can't let them.<eos> We can't leave. Not when every cent we have is tied up in that house.<eos> If it was a fight they wanted, it was a fight they were gonna get.<eos> Looking back, I understand why the court gave Mason full custody.<eos> What kind of mother does the things I did during those times?
He's really pissed, but I think I talked him off the ledge.<eos> Well, thank you for that.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> I understand.<eos> Really I do.
Hey, gang, say hi to the Flemings. - Hey, guys.<eos> - Hey, what's up?<eos> Wait, I don't understand.<eos> Do your employees live here?<eos> Uh, maybe some of them do.
Did you have intercourse or not?<eos> Scotty, shut it.<eos> Dad, I'm just trying to connect the dots here.<eos> Look.<eos> Yeah, we did.
I owe you two an apology.<eos> When I get nervous all kinds of crap comes flying out of my mouth and I know that's not how you guys roll.<eos> No.<eos> I was just trying to make a good impression. Yeah.<eos> Well, you did.
Oh, man.<eos> That's it.<eos> Dude, I thought I was gonna make it.<eos> I know.<eos> You almost did, but...
- Thank you. - You're welcome.<eos> * A bad mother fucker standing next to me Boom!<eos> Boss, let me get this straight.<eos> You want me to hack into Stephanie's boyfriend's computer and find out if there's any record of him starting a foundation?<eos> Yes, I do.
- Go ahead.<eos> - Wait, really?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Told you to get that seat at the table, bro.<eos> You did.
Come up with some cock-a-meme title.<eos> I always have some errands to run.<eos> Oh! I'll do anything.<eos> You know anybody in town?<eos> No. I don't.
You said it yourself that it's possible to have feelings for two people.<eos> You love him too?<eos> I don't believe it.<eos> Well believe it.<eos> I do.
I love you.<eos> I have loved you for over a year.<eos> I handled the best I could.<eos> Maybe it was handled poorly at times.<eos> But in the matters of heart, people do foolish things.
But Mongols made me feel sexy.<eos> The Mongols?<eos> The reefers.<eos> But you called them, what?<eos> He did.
And she let it happen.<eos> Let's make her pay.<eos> Do you have your own room key?<eos> No.<eos> I do.
- Frazer's explained, yes.<eos> I wonder, do you recognise this man?<eos> For the purposes of the tape,<eos> I'm showing David a picture of a male individual.<eos> I do, yes.
Why are you protecting him, David?<eos> No-one has any idea how bad Gortnacull House was.<eos> Only those that were there.<eos> - I have some idea.<eos> - No, you fucking don't.
I heard.<eos> I'll call you later.<eos> I know you will.<eos> I love you, Henry.<eos> I really do.
Help.<eos> Help.<eos> Hey, Keem.<eos> Why?<eos> I didn't do this to our family.
- Yeah.<eos> '11, 12, 13.<eos> I heard him.'<eos> - Do you know what he meant?<eos> - 'Yeah, I do, I do.
Now, this here is a copy of the Our Child accounts.<eos> - He asked me to look at them.<eos> - Why didn't you tell us before?<eos> Because I didn't know who you were.<eos> I do now.
Yeah, why not?<eos> Why have you been telling lies about Paul?<eos> I haven't.<eos> You said he left comments on your videos.<eos> He did.
Look, I need $40 for HBO.<eos> D'accord ?<eos> Okay.<eos> Did you get that job?<eos> Yeah, I did.
Mr. Waits is gonna direct us to the crime scenes, and we will be on top of his every move.<eos> Maybe we should loosen his shackles.<eos> - We don't need a lawsuit here.<eos> - No fuckin' way.<eos> Bosch, just do it!
Cameras everywhere, total coverage.<eos> Remote control.<eos> You can punch in on a pimple.<eos> - You know rich people.<eos> - No, I don't.
- It's good to see you, Harry.<eos> Tony went to Las Vegas frequently for business.<eos> Did he always drive?<eos> He didn't like to fly.<eos> Oh, who does these days?
And a few weeks later, he contacted me and invited me out here.<eos> Which I don't understand.<eos> That's the type of man he was.<eos> I think that he even thought that if I met his wife I would come to like her.<eos> But you didn't?
The what?<eos> The riddle of the two barbers!<eos> Understand that, Florence, and you understand who killed Dan Hagen.<eos> You know who killed Dan Hagen?<eos> Yes, I do.
He didn't bring the money.<eos> Senator Stay Puft, rebuttal?<eos> I didn't bring it, because... because I don't have it.<eos> - Wha...<eos> Well, who does?
Yeah, so how do you wanna die?<eos> Home invasion.<eos> You break into my house, I startle you, you shoot me.<eos> I assume you have access to a firearm?<eos> I do, yeah-
Yes!<eos> or... - the bullies who tormented a scrawny teenage boy with no friends?<eos> - You! Because I find it interesting that you were bullied in school, and now as an adult you're a bully.<eos> Do you want to talk about how you bully me?<eos> I do, Cyril.
Why, just so she can bury him?<eos> Yeah, because trying to kill Barry has gone so well for you in the past.<eos> Yeah, Lana, but this time it's, um...<eos> Were you gonna say, "This time it's personal"?<eos> Yeah, but I didn't.
Square gets the square!<eos> And I get going.<eos> You guys validate?<eos> Mr. Shapiro, please, as I said on the phone, the Figgis Agency values your business, and I can assure you this internal affair doesn't reflect our ability as investigators, so...<eos> - Yes, it does.
Why would she be in the refrigerator?<eos> I don't know.<eos> You said look everywhere.<eos> - Yeah, he's right.<eos> You did.
- What bet?<eos> - No, shut up.<eos> I would think "person" was implied.<eos> Yeah, no, I just didn't wanna get in that head space and then, you know...<eos> No, I don't.
And plus, Jerkleton, I've got this.<eos> Spanish Fly.<eos> - Right?<eos> - Pam, that shit doesn't work.<eos> Yes, it does.
I think I'm supposed to be somewhere.<eos> But I also think I want the lavender instead of the sandalwood.<eos> Right?<eos> - Oh, who remembers?<eos> - I do.
Why not the police?<eos> - I...<eos> - I don't know, Cyril.<eos> Maybe he wanted to be interrupted every five seconds.<eos> I don't, actually.
- No, no, no, no, no.<eos> Goddamn it.<eos> What the hell, man?<eos> I needed that.<eos> No, you didn't.
Goddamn it.<eos> What the hell, man?<eos> I needed that.<eos> No, you didn't.<eos> Yes, I did.
- Eww!<eos> - What?<eos> Don't ask.<eos> You'll gag.<eos> She certainly did.
- Well, he and Veronica have been in her dressing room for a while now.<eos> And since apparently Archer's penis is like a crack pipe...<eos> What, in size and/or shape?<eos> They said if he has sex with Veronica, she'll fall head over heels for him.<eos> Oh, they did, did they?
- She's a real menace.<eos> Shut up, and they all saw me.<eos> - I didn't.<eos> - What?<eos> Yes, you did!
All right, Grabney Coleman!<eos> What?<eos> It's about the murder.<eos> Oh, Sterling, I know exactly what you're going to say.<eos> - You do?
It's about the murder.<eos> Oh, Sterling, I know exactly what you're going to say.<eos> - You do?<eos> - And I know exactly what to do.<eos> - You do.
Where did you go?<eos> I like a change of music.<eos> How the hell is this your era?<eos> - You hid from me.<eos> - One, I did not.
But he'd be on Doximity, probably... the medical version of Linkedln.<eos> Could you not just have stopped when I said great?<eos> Good morning! Light reading?<eos> Do you even know what pulmonology is?<eos> Yes, I do.
Yes, it's a private sponsor certification form...<eos> It's a copy of the same private sponsor cerification form that was submitted to the Senate Ethics Committee to pre-authorize Senator Jacobs' travel to Indonesia.<eos> Look at the handwriting on that form, Ms. Sloane.<eos> Do you recognize that handwriting?<eos> Yes, I do.
At the gas station.<eos> There's a security tape.<eos> What was going on there?<eos> You know.<eos> I don't.
And he followed them in his hearse.<eos> You don't know that.<eos> He waited for them to leave. There's no other reason.<eos> And the cops haven't even bothered talking to him.<eos> But you did.
Detective, what made you so sure so quickly<eos> The mountain of evidence.<eos> So why bother questioning him?<eos> Sometimes a suspect wants nothing more than to confess.<eos> - Did he?
My dad's the only person in the world who believes me.<eos> Your mother does too.<eos> No.<eos> Well...<eos> I do.
Why?<eos> Because he needed it.<eos> He was distressed. He was having trouble breathing.<eos> So, instead of taking him to the hospital, which is how it's supposed to work when something like that happens, you removed evidence from the crime scene?<eos> Yes, I did.
Even if it's not worth doing it.<eos> Come on Schöll!<eos> Show us you're a man!<eos> Shoot him!<eos> Do it!
- You know we don't talk about work.<eos> - We do if there's something wrong.<eos> You should have gone to the gala.<eos> Hm?<eos> Why didn't you?
You tell me.<eos> Look, we raised nearly half a million pounds last night.<eos> Do you have any idea what difference that's going to make?<eos> You just don't get it, do you?<eos> No, Lisa, I don't.
It's okay, son, I got this.<eos> Get him out of here.<eos> So, is this a social call?<eos> 'Cause my memory could be failing me, but I don't remember inviting you to visit.<eos> - You didn't.
You got me.<eos> Who the fuck are you?<eos> A concerned citizen.<eos> I don't think you want to mess with me.<eos> I do.
I can't... I can't do this, Kurt.<eos> I know.<eos> It's not always gonna be like this.<eos> You think you can still get him out?<eos> No, I don't.
Just everybody disappeared all at once.<eos> You know?<eos> It's all my fault.<eos> Job knew the risks.<eos> We all did.
- How is he?<eos> - Innocent and Brock knows it.<eos> Well, the evidence says otherwise and the sheriff has to follow up.<eos> You got something for me?<eos> I did.
I hear you went native while I was away.<eos> That's one way of putting it.<eos> - You got another way?<eos> Listen, Job, I tried to find you.<eos> We all did.
That's my mother's sweater.<eos> It is.<eos> She never wears it.<eos> - It looks good on you.<eos> - Most things do.
It's not lack of confidence.<eos> You've got a secret.<eos> Or secrets.<eos> Maybe I just don't like you.<eos> But you do.
And I know that until you make peace with this, you can't be the parent that your children need.<eos> So go finish it.<eos> Where's my drugs?<eos> - They took everything.<eos> - Who did?
You're an animal!<eos> An animal!<eos> This feels good!<eos> Oh, don't stop!<eos> Don't...
Susan, keep seeing him if you have to, live with him, I don't care, but do not marry him.<eos> I understand what you see in Edward.<eos> I get it. - No.<eos> - No, wait, I do.<eos> - No, you don't. No, you don't.
I understand what you see in Edward.<eos> I get it. - No.<eos> - No, wait, I do.<eos> - No, you don't. No, you don't.<eos> - Yes, I do.
What is that?<eos> Oh, my God, it's so cool.<eos> It's this app that lets me watch Willow while she's in her crib. Really?<eos> Do you not trust your nanny?<eos> No, no, I do.
- Mmm-hmm.<eos> - All right, let's go, Tony.<eos> Now, we're going to a place you might remember, and you can help yourself out by telling me about it.<eos> But if you don't remember,<eos> Tony does, all right?
It's a shame.<eos> But I didn't have nothin' to do with it.<eos> - What's this place?<eos> - You know this place.<eos> - Honest to God, I don't.
How'd you know I wouldn't keep it?<eos> Anyway, that's not why we broke up.<eos> - We just weren't right for each other. - No, no, no.<eos> - How do you know that?<eos> - I just did.
Anyway, that's not why we broke up.<eos> - We just weren't right for each other. - No, no, no.<eos> - How do you know that?<eos> - I just did.<eos> I... - I do.
She has always relied on me...<eos> Ever since you sent her here.<eos> I'm sure you had hoped that she would find people that would take care of her.<eos> Who would love her like she was their own.<eos> I did.
(ALEX PANTING)<eos> You pulled me out?<eos> How could you?<eos> I told you to stop him!<eos> - I did.
And I didn't even care, like, at all, because it was you.<eos> What... what?<eos> I had, like, a huge crush on you in high school.<eos> You knew that.<eos> No, I did not.
You knew that.<eos> No, I did not.<eos> What?<eos> Oh, whoops.<eos> No, I didn't.
Wow.<eos> Um, who else?<eos> We need more friends, obviously.<eos> No, we don't.<eos> We don't?
It's like he's mulling it over.<eos> You think he had an existential crisis?<eos> I think there's something fucked up going on with his cognition. And I think you feel exactly the same way that I do.<eos> Do we know where the error originated?<eos> We do.
It's just some business he has to take care of over there.<eos> I'd be happy to look in on you guys if you'd like.<eos> No need.<eos> We're managing.<eos> We always do.
Let's keep an eye on probate, see how the estate settles.<eos> The thing is this guy was a money launderer.<eos> Who knows what he's got squirreled away and where?<eos> The widow, maybe?<eos> Yeah. Maybe she does.
Look, it's garbage, Harry.<eos> I talked to the captain.<eos> You're going home.<eos> But he wants to know about you and Kirsch first.<eos> He does or you do?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Good.<eos> Hey, I thought this new contract was supposed to guarantee us separate accommodations?<eos> It does.
Look, until I know what I'm dealing with, I'm not taking any chances.<eos> Fuck this.<eos> This isn't our town.<eos> We don't even know where to begin.<eos> I do.
It's open.<eos> My son was working undercover for Internal Affairs.<eos> Special Operations Division.<eos> I had no idea.<eos> No one did.
I've seen the video from the store.<eos> I saw how upset you were.<eos> Yeah, yeah, I was.<eos> I know you didn't know what was going to happen to my son that night.<eos> No, I didn't.
I had no idea you'd grown up to be a detective till I saw your name in the paper... yours and Marjorie's.<eos> That case had nothing to do with my mother.<eos> It was just a lawyer dragging her name through the mud, trying to get to me.<eos> You said you know who killed her.<eos> Yes, I do.
Then I got on a train, and I left.<eos> I left the town, I left the life.<eos> What about the detective?<eos> Do you remember his name?<eos> No, I don't.
Yeah.<eos> Detective Bosch.<eos> Ms. Chandler.<eos> Didn't I say our paths would cross again.<eos> Yes, you did.
Tell me you love Nergüi.<eos> Kokachin...<eos> Go now.<eos> I won.<eos> I did it.
This just all feels so sudden that, uh...<eos> - I don't know what to say.<eos> - Just say yes.<eos> Well, I want to say yes.<eos> I really do.
- Hey.<eos> So, I just got a voice mail from my mom, 'cause she is at the airport.<eos> Did you... did you fly her in for the party?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yeah, I did.
You really think a dance is all it takes?<eos> Mom, I know that Schmidt is not what you imagined.<eos> Or what I imagined.<eos> I never thought I would fall for the slim-hipped ghost of Tom Cruise.<eos> None of us did.
You really were.<eos> I mean, KC and I were, we weren't going anywhere.<eos> Let's be honest.<eos> I just want to find somebody, Cece;<eos> I really do.
Did you just call me Marty?<eos> No.<eos> Did I slur?<eos> I think I'm just tired and a little drunky.<eos> Mm. So you did or you didn't?
I like you, John.<eos> We've known each other for a long time.<eos> But this job is a lot more complicated than putting away bad guys.<eos> - I think I understand that.<eos> - No, you don't.
Listen, it doesn't seem like they had much of a relationship.<eos> Still, John...<eos> Still what, Kevin?<eos> It doesn't change anything.<eos> It doesn't?
When did you know he was dealing drugs?<eos> I was suspicious when he had all that money.<eos> I knew he wasn't making all that money working here.<eos> You never said anything to me about it.<eos> No, I didn't.
- Okay. Okay, we can stop.<eos> My brother was fucking killed!<eos> Do you understand that?<eos> - Kevin...<eos> - Do you?
We're executing a warranted search of this property.<eos> - Step aside, sir.<eos> - This is fucking harassment.<eos> I'm calling my lawyer.<eos> You do that.
- Oh, I did.<eos> It's the truth.<eos> Gene is dead because of me.<eos> It's not because of you, Martha.<eos> I did it.
Good.<eos> Good.<eos> And then we'll figure out what to do next.<eos> When did you get Henry that cologne?<eos> I didn't.
Kiss! I'm sick of this bit.<eos> How did they do that?<eos> It's a conspiracy!<eos> - Well, I guess we have to!<eos> - You don't!
Ms. Dunhill has volunteered, but it's not possible for her to chaperone alone.<eos> Will you help?<eos> This Thursday?<eos> Oh, I-I hate to say no.<eos> Then don't.
You two should appreciate all the time you have.<eos> We're getting nowhere.<eos> All that guy does is complain.<eos> Comfort her. Pick her up.<eos> Why don't you do it?
You're not serious.<eos> It's neoclassical.<eos> I don't suppose you know what that means.<eos> No, you're right.<eos> I don't.
Like Mr. Fantastic.<eos> Yeah, except I can't fight evil with it.<eos> So, did he call?<eos> Keep your voice down.<eos> Did he?
Yeah, but obviously it was stupid, or he'd be here.<eos> If his mom found out a girl spent the night--<eos> He's in deep shit right about now.<eos> Hey, what if she slept naked?<eos> Oh, my God, she didn't.
You promised that you'd go.<eos> You're coming.<eos> We're gonna have a great time.<eos> He just wants to get in your pants.<eos> No, he doesn't.
Well, maybe it's his ghost.<eos> Maybe he's haunting us.<eos> -It's not his ghost.<eos> -So how do you know that?<eos> -I just do!
You're just a junkie.<eos> A small town cop who had a really bad week.<eos> Took one too many pills this time.<eos> You made a mistake coming back here.<eos> No, I didn't.
- I can't believe it worked.<eos> - What worked?<eos> We got the phone out, we managed to call you.<eos> No, you didn't call us.<eos> He did.
Perhaps an entire complex.<eos> I just hope they have insurance.<eos> Unexpected archaeological discovery insurance.<eos> You don't have it.<eos> Of course we do.
That's why we lived in here when we were kids.<eos> Hey.<eos> I don't usually open for breakfast, guys.<eos> You want another?<eos> I do.
Okay, you went this far, get right to it.<eos> You have a problem.<eos> You greased some fellows in my union.<eos> If you say I did.<eos> I do.
The Bryan Connerty at the settlement conference... he would've stormed out of here the moment I walked in.<eos> But you stayed, and you listened.<eos> Hmm. And like you said... I stare at the lions at the zoo, too.<eos> Doesn't mean I wanna be one.<eos> Sure, it does.
You are all black around the mouth.<eos> -You too.<eos> Do you think Christian was afraid to be ... gay?<eos> I do not think he did.<eos> But what if he did?
What?<eos> He is the only thing that has kept me sane this last year.<eos> And I love him.<eos> - Ugh. - I think.<eos> No, you don't.
When he wakes up.<eos> - Really?<eos> - Yes.<eos> They said it was a severe heart attack brought on by a combination of factors, including that thing that I did with the gun, which I totally didn't mean to do.<eos> Of course you didn't.
I thought I wanted to know all the details, but you know what?<eos> This is just too much details.<eos> Okay, well, I'm happy to stop, because this is just...<eos> Did you ever tell him that you loved him?<eos> N-no... no, I never did that.
- We were trying to have a conversation with the kids.<eos> Do you r... you remember?<eos> Did... did Grandpa die?<eos> - What?<eos> - Oh, shit, did he?
- So, you don't know what he said?<eos> - With the fuss, I didn't understand.<eos> Where was Charlie between eight and one o'clock?<eos> - He was with me.<eos> - Doing what?
- Copy that.<eos> - Do you have the money?<eos> - We do.<eos> Switch the GPS on.<eos> Done.
What is wrong with me?<eos> Junior.<eos> Hunter.<eos> You know why I built my office entirely out of glass even though birds can't see glass?<eos> I do not.
Well, it means...<eos> I'm putting you in charge of your very own department.<eos> You are the new head of Letter Sorting.<eos> I didn't even know we still got letters.<eos> We do!
You don't know.<eos> - I know.<eos> If you don't know, then why do you wanna be boss?<eos> - I know.<eos> - You don't.
- we're amazing.<eos> And we think<eos> - Yes, we are.<eos> - That you're amazing.<eos> - Yes, we do.
This is a shade.<eos> Sacred native lore.<eos> They make figures of them.<eos> 60.<eos> And what does the shade do?
You know, supposedly, it makes the things more lifelike, but, really, it's just a vanity project from the megalomaniac who started this place.<eos> And frankly, I don't know why the suits at Delos put up with it.<eos> Sorry, I'm afraid I'm gonna have to cut you off.<eos> - Do you know who I am?<eos> - I do.
Iknowshe's, like,yourfriend, or- -I guess.<eos> But--but ifI didn'tdo it , they--they'djust getsomeoneelseto, andthenthey'dbe suspiciousofme ,so ... soI saidyes.<eos> ButI didit foryou.<eos> Always doing things for other people, aren't you?<eos> Time to do one more thing.
You said that you didn't want to be part of the interview process, so they picked someone this morning.<eos> Jack Barker.<eos> He's an incredibly skilled, top-notch CEO.<eos> I don't care who he is, okay?<eos> None of us do.
Solomon only had his throat blowed open.<eos> So, Solomon comes home, right? Did some pretty heinous shit in Vietnam...<eos> - Allegedly.<eos> - "Allegedly" does some pretty heinous shit in Vietnam, but nothing comes of it. It gets swept under the rug.<eos> Or maybe he didn't do nothin'.
Thank you.<eos> Have you... have you... have you heard any more, - from the cops?<eos> Why, you talk to 'em?<eos> Yeah.<eos> - Yeah, I did.
- Well?<eos> - Uh... something's chasing me.<eos> Pokey, every time I turn around you think something's chasing you. - What is it this time?<eos> - You forgot to latch the door.<eos> - Yes, I did.
-We're done now.<eos> Okay.<eos> Come out.<eos> We know you're in there.<eos> No, you don't.
She is God's gift to the boys.<eos> And I might add, to us doctors, as well.<eos> I got the impression Dr. Summers disapproves of lady volunteers.<eos> For Miss Hastings, he makes an exception.<eos> We all do.
For you.<eos> No, no, no. That...<eos> That's on you, not me.<eos> - I never asked for that.<eos> - Of course you did.
Who did this?<eos> ! The devil.<eos> The devil did this.<eos> I almost killed someone tonight.<eos> Why didn't you?
- The shrink.<eos> She was called for a psych eval.<eos> She said you knew about it.<eos> Damien didn't mean to hurt me.<eos> Oh, but he did.
Y'all looking to upgrade?<eos> Having kids?<eos> No, not any time soon.<eos> - Nothing like that. - Is that why he came to see me and asked me for money?<eos> He did?
It's the very worst in this war. Now he's brought this shit back here to Memphis.<eos> So you want justice for Quan Thang, Senator McGovern, or is it your dead friend? Which is it?<eos> You didn't serve, Tommy.<eos> Now what the hell does that have to do with anything?<eos> I did.
Oh, come on, 'course you do.<eos> It's not every day you see the two most handsome men in Memphis.<eos> Now, you're gonna tell us where your boss keeps his stash, you understand?<eos> Well, I can't tell you what I don't know.<eos> I don't...
- I understand.<eos> - You've got God and miss Dix on your side, dear.<eos> Do as you deem fit.<eos> You don't want to see Mr. Bullen, miss.<eos> Yes, I do.
- You've got God and miss Dix on your side, dear.<eos> Do as you deem fit.<eos> You don't want to see Mr. Bullen, miss.<eos> Yes, I do.<eos> No. No, you don't.
I shot a civilian, Art.<eos> They're gonna take you to I.A. to be formally interviewed.<eos> I don't know who she is. I don't know.<eos> You saw a gun.<eos> No, I didn't.
Yes, yes. Yes, of course.<eos> Unless you've solved it already.<eos> No, no, no. I...<eos> I was expecting... You didn't put the request in.<eos> No, I did.
I was in college.<eos> Trish Kellogg and I spent every Valentine's Day just hiding out, eating milk duds.<eos> I'm not sure that had anything to do with a serial killer.<eos> Didn't the police catch this lunatic?<eos> They did.
That would explain the cleaner crime scenes.<eos> Except none of those men had drugs in their system.<eos> How in the world?<eos> I have no idea.<eos> But, maybe this guy does.
(Sighs) And the case was closed.<eos> Or so they thought.<eos> What're you getting at?<eos> Tax rolls show a Wayne Lewis owned the house back in 1994.<eos> Still does.
Did you know she had a P.O. Box?<eos> What?<eos> She got a text message about a package.<eos> I didn't even know that she had a post office box.<eos> I didn't, either.
It could happen to us.<eos> So we need to be prepared.<eos> To that end, say "hello" to our new and improved compliance department.<eos> These assholes work here now?<eos> That, they do.
What you should have done, if you were really playing an elevated game, was come to me with what you had.<eos> See, if I had something better to give you in exchange for you holding on to it...<eos> You have never been willing to play any kind of game with me.<eos> I didn't know you were ready to play in the bigs, man.<eos> Now I do.
Hmm...<eos> You're afraid... that if this gets out, it'll be a scandal. Yeah, you're afraid you're gonna lose all that love you got for "Boom Boom Boom Boom."<eos> Trust me, this gets out, it's not good for nobody.<eos> It ain't gonna get out, Lucious.<eos> Just as long as you do right by your sons.
Could be.<eos> They're well funded with Saudi money via Qatar.<eos> Maybe they gave him some of that money.<eos> That's what we need you to find out.<eos> And if they did?
Why would you do that?<eos> Might be because you could've killed me the other night but you didn't.<eos> Or maybe I like knowing you're out there, a ghost, still doing what needs to be done.<eos> How'd you know it had a false bottom?<eos> I didn't.
That's not an instinct we should hope to nurture in any artificial super intelligence.<eos> Not even one that we call our own.<eos> She's our only ally in this war.<eos> You need to learn to trust Her.<eos> But I do, Ms. Groves.
Turns out she's out there changing the world while the rest of us are wearing headphones, and now she's gone, and nobody cares.<eos> You care.<eos> Another missing persons, three days gone.<eos> You know how this ends, don't you?<eos> No, and neither do you.
What's not to love?<eos> Bear takes one scoop of kibble twice a day.<eos> Oh, and if you could answer the pay phone, should it ring.<eos> Mr. Reese, have you managed to secure an invitation to the wedding?<eos> I did.
Sure.<eos> Sounds like the protestors have been out to get her father for years.<eos> Think they're about ready to make good on their threat to put him down?<eos> I'm more inclined to think that someone in the Turner family wants to make sure that this wedding doesn't happen.<eos> Because if it does,
A well thought-out plan takes time.<eos> We haven't survived this long by virtue of rash decisions.<eos> Yeah, 'cause actions aren't really your thing, huh?<eos> Did you even look for me?<eos> Of course we did.
What if it signaled Samaritan when we plugged it into some kind of network device?<eos> They would know where Finch is, the Machine, and they'd attack.<eos> Come on.<eos> Finch, do not plug the USB into anything that is not air gapped.<eos> I already did.
you know we belong together.<eos> We'll work through this, but first... I need to get you to safety.<eos> But nothing's safe.<eos> Do you know where we are?<eos> What they did to me?
What do you mean?<eos> I could turn on you at any moment, and even if I don't, I could lead them to the Machine.<eos> That'll never happen.<eos> I don't know if I'm calling the shots anymore...<eos> And neither do you.
- Ms. Shaw.<eos> It's good to have you back home.<eos> Harold, do you know how they found you?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I do.
And please tell Ms. Shaw this is not her cross to bear.<eos> This lapdog has the same card.<eos> Temporary Resolutions.<eos> You want to tell me how this all-seeing eye thing doesn't see us coming?<eos> It does.
He knows you're not.<eos> He slipped up.<eos> He went back to the place he and Grace had their first date.<eos> Harold has a weakness.<eos> We all do.
Officer Reed there is a good man, just not a very smart cop.<eos> There we go.<eos> Now, where were we?<eos> I didn't teach you how to love.<eos> Of course you did.
What are you doing here, Pierce?<eos> I guess you could say I'm championing a new cause.<eos> Champagne, social elite.<eos> Don't you usually hate these things?<eos> I do, don't I?
Tell me, after it's eradicated both ASIs, what then?<eos> Then we go back to letting humanity determine its own fate.<eos> Surely you're not that naive.<eos> You know another ASI would soon arise.<eos> Not for certain I don't, and neither do you.
Many mistakes.<eos> But we helped some people.<eos> Didn't we?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, we did.
Get a team together and let's move.<eos> Got it.<eos> I never should have taken these down.<eos> I gave up.<eos> Well, we all did.
Who?<eos> Him.<eos> You haven't even talked to that guy.<eos> Come on, man.<eos> We don't do a lot of talking.
Does he write letters to the dogs?<eos> Are you serious?<eos> Well, that would be like the home run, right?<eos> I mean, that's what we need.<eos> - Does he?
So, who won that round?<eos> You or the porcelain?<eos> Porcelain's undefeated.<eos> I'm sorry about that, I thought everyone left.<eos> Yes, they did.
She said it so casually.<eos> In the next room, my six-year-old daughter was being taken off life support.<eos> And this woman says "collateral beauty."<eos> People don't know what to say in those moments.<eos> No, she did.
Just turn it off.<eos> You hired people to follow me?<eos> Make video?<eos> No, that wasn't the initial intention.<eos> No, we did.
Nina!<eos> Prairie believes her father's alive and sneaking her messages about where to find him in dreams.<eos> She also believes her dreams are premonitions, and that the Russian Mafia are after her.<eos> Kids tell tall tales.<eos> I did myself.
Come on.<eos> Last bite, last bite.<eos> You gotta go brush your teeth, all right?<eos> I did.<eos> No, you didn't.
Uh, here, ketchup at midnight, mustard at four o'clock, mayo at eight o'clock.<eos> Good stuff, okay?<eos> Did I have an NDE?<eos> No.<eos> I didn't, but I, uh...
Excuse me. Mrs. Johnson?<eos> Nancy Johnson?<eos> - Hi... - Excuse me.<eos> I don't. I...
What was Hap recording?<eos> What did it mean?<eos> He was recording the soundscapes of our NDEs, trying to map out what it was that people call "the other side."<eos> Yeah, I... I put that part together.<eos> Bullshit you did.
You could have stayed with Khatun.<eos> With your father.<eos> But... you chose to come back.<eos> I didn't choose to come to Crestwood.<eos> Well, maybe you did.
- Lorna left me.<eos> - Oh, no.<eos> Yeah, she, she walked out, left a note and, and I'm so upset!<eos> Well, we're gonna break up too unless there's a major change.<eos> But my wife already did.
All right.<eos> Do I know you?<eos> Oh, yeah. Um...<eos> I really liked your poem.<eos> No, he didn't.
I'm doing this for me, Marn.<eos> I'm doing this for me.<eos> Desi, I like the wall.<eos> - This fuck... this fucking...<eos> - I do.
(SCREAMS)<eos> SCREAM ECHOES, BIRDS CAW<eos> (GROANS)<eos> I don't really think you're a bastard.<eos> Yeah, you do.
I can hear well enough.<eos> Sid.<eos> Don't you hear that?<eos> - Listen.<eos> - I don't.
And let's not forget the Boston Tea Party.<eos> Speaking of that, did you read that a study found that green tea is very good for you?<eos> Much healthier than the kind we drink.<eos> I don't like Chinese's tea.<eos> I do.
If I wind up in prison, I am never gonna take a shower.<eos> I can promise you one thing, that she will not be here long.<eos> Yeah, meanwhile, her accomplice was captured.<eos> You know, thank God the guy doesn't know where she is.<eos> Um, he... he does.
Happy anniversary!<eos> Happy anniversary?<eos> - You didn't remember.<eos> - Yes, I did. - What day is today?<eos> - Okay, I didn't.
Jorge!<eos> Yeah, I do this almost every day.<eos> It's just... you're crazy.<eos> I don't see what's so funny.<eos> I do.
That's great.<eos> Hey, I didn't know there was a shortcut to get down here.<eos> You know it, right?<eos> - Of course.<eos> - Sure we do.
Fix me a cup of coffee and I'll say hi to your parents.<eos> You have no idea how much I miss all of this.<eos> If it weren't for Jorge's ideas, we'd still have it.<eos> He only wanted to give us a hand.<eos> And he did.
I'm leaving on the count of three. It's my only way out.<eos> - Why did you lie to me?<eos> - I didn't lie to you.<eos> - Yes, I did.<eos> - Yes, you did.
Take it from me, I'm from Albacete and we've got our thing too.<eos> You sure do.<eos> You've got me hooked.<eos> -L'll handle it.<eos> - Do that.
Trainee Chang, how are we supposed to believe that our client killed his sister when you haven't even produced a body?<eos> Because the circumstantial evidence is enough for a murder conviction, assuming that we have excluded all reasonable hypotheses.<eos> Have you?<eos> The FBI believes that it has.<eos> I, on the other hand, do not.
I think you can.<eos> But you won't because if you wanted to kill me, you would have pulled that trigger already.<eos> Just like you would have done to yourself.<eos> You don't know what you're talking about!<eos> Actually, I do.
It has all kinds of secrets in it. Your son Charlie is alive.<eos> Those assholes were close enough to take a picture of my son, and we still don't have him home.<eos> How long you been spying on me, lying to me, selling me out to those killers you work for?<eos> I did it to protect you.<eos> - Bullshit! - You did it for you.
- Nice to meet you.<eos> - Nice to meet you.<eos> Up top.<eos> They don't... you guys wouldn't want to go for a swim, would you?<eos> - I do.
- Nice to meet you.<eos> Up top.<eos> They don't... you guys wouldn't want to go for a swim, would you?<eos> - I do.<eos> - You do?
You need to call your father, have him take you and Gracie and Hudson and go up to the Green Zone.<eos> I need?<eos> You need to tell me where you are.<eos> Can you do that for me?<eos> Maddie already did!
- Oh, my God.<eos> Oh, my God, one is, like, going raw dog on me.<eos> I'm so impressed, Shoshanna.<eos> I feel like you used to be really work-driven and now you've learned to slow down and just enjoy life.<eos> Yeah, I did.
Maybe it's because Mum was always easy on you or your face is so symmetrical, but it's left you soft.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> I'm sorry to be the one to tell you things that you don't want to hear, but I know you, Jessa.<eos> I know you.<eos> No, you don't.
I'm sorry to be the one to tell you things that you don't want to hear, but I know you, Jessa.<eos> I know you.<eos> No, you don't.<eos> Okay, Romeo.<eos> No, you don't.
And it's this... That I'm accepted as I am.<eos> Completely.<eos> For my good qualities, sure, but also for all... of my filth.<eos> And I appreciate a woman who is that giving.<eos> I truly do.
♪ Tense music ♪ So it's all about Purkheiser.<eos> Now we know that for sure.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Did you see her react?<eos> - I did.

Okay.<eos> You're here to shoot me again?<eos> No.<eos> I don't know anything about them.<eos> I never did.
Martha told me that you found out about our little sex romp in the van.<eos> - Can I take your order?<eos> - And you know, you're my brother, and I wanted to come to you and let you know that<eos> I love Martha, okay?<eos> - No, you don't.
Rigging an election is a serious accusation.<eos> All the more reason to listen to Peggy.<eos> Where are those newspapers?<eos> I-I had to leave them behind.<eos> Well, of course you did.
Okay.<eos> The best chance that we have of getting close to Whitney without being detected is her husband's campaign fundraiser tomorrow night at the MacArthur Grand Hotel.<eos> Not an easy ticket to get.<eos> Howard Stark donates money to all the political candidates to ensure good favor with whomever wins, so Mr. Jarvis has two tickets secured.<eos> Of course he does.
Everything I've got.<eos> That's a lot to lose.<eos> But I won't lose.<eos> Yes, you will.<eos> And when you do...
Bring him out!<eos> Agent Carter.<eos> Jason, you're solid.<eos> - How?<eos> - Peggy, don't do this, please.
Peggy?<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Getting you out of here.<eos> Peggy, you need to leave.<eos> We both do.
Sorry it has to end like this.<eos> Do you want to do the honors, Chief Thompson?<eos> No.<eos> From what I hear, your way is a lot cleaner.<eos> Don't do this, Jack.
What happened to Lewis is very exceptional.<eos> You can get up.<eos> Everything is fine.<eos> You just need to keep avoiding both intense physical efforts and extreme emotions.<eos> Like Lewis did...
You see this door...<eos> It's only like slightly ajar.<eos> I also this that... the soul... continues to exist after death.<eos> I don't really know if I believe in that.<eos> But Lewis did.
He understood things that went unspoken.<eos> He did.<eos> Maybe because he knew he was going to die.<eos> I mean I felt that he saw things which I didn't.<eos> Maybe you do too.
That she came to say goodbye to him.<eos> That it felt like a dream, but not, that it was very real.<eos> He could smell her, he could see her so clearly... you know?<eos> Do you believe that?<eos> Yeah, I do.
He could smell her, he could see her so clearly... you know?<eos> Do you believe that?<eos> Yeah, I do.<eos> It's not a religion thing, but I...<eos> I do.
- Have you been here long?<eos> - No. No, not too long.<eos> Really?<eos> She said you were the first one here.<eos> She did?
But you were like... When I met you, you were like...<eos> - You were like... - "Hi, I'm Gus.<eos> What's your major?"<eos> I didn't say that all the time.<eos> Yeah, you did.
Hey.<eos> Come here, you handsome son of a bitch!<eos> You glorious kook!<eos> - You know Joe Manfredi?<eos> - Yes, we do.

Mm!<eos> It was so serious!<eos> I can see.<eos> You guys live together?<eos> Uh, yeah, we did.
- Thanks for coming.<eos> - Hey, anytime you tell me there's a new talent I should see, I am there.<eos> Yeah.<eos> - What'd you say this girl's name was?<eos> - I didn't.
What, so she can thrive?<eos> So she can bloom?<eos> You don't even know her!<eos> I mean, do you even understand how talented she is?<eos> Yeah, I do!
You know, I think as cool as it is to be on the cover of Businessweek,<eos> I've lost sight of why I wanted to work with these artists because I've lost sight of myself as an artist.<eos> And I have to admit, the tour for Layla is probably as important for me as it would have been for her.<eos> Want to do 10 dates for the hell of it?<eos> Yeah, I do.
What's going on?<eos> Cash asked me to come.<eos> Couldn't say no to my daughter.<eos> You understand that, don't you?<eos> No, I don't.
Really think you're winning her over.<eos> Honestly, if we don't turn the dial up, she won't rule in our favor.<eos> We need to use our alternate strategy.<eos> Look, I know that you don't want to do that.<eos> - I don't.
Do not speak for her.<eos> You never knew what Mom wanted, because you never took the time to ask.<eos> We had a belief system.<eos> That doesn't mean you couldn't love me.<eos> Mom did.
I don't know how to get us there.<eos> You don't have to know how.<eos> Just have faith that you will.<eos> Well, we found our way back to each other, didn't we?<eos> Yes, we did.
The cops screwed up, and three people died in the crossfire.<eos> There was an investigation, but in the end, Chicago P.D. stuck together.<eos> They blamed the ATF, and they blamed the state police, and they blamed the FBI.<eos> I just wanted somebody to stand up and tell the truth, like I had in the NFL.<eos> But they didn't.
Let me remind you we are an impartial committee, and it's important the views you express here today are yours and yours alone.<eos> I'll ask again...<eos> Do you believe Elias Harper acted alone?<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> I do.
Yeah, I see your point.<eos> Did you get what you came for?<eos> Well, I came to bring someone back to New York.<eos> So, yeah.<eos> I did.
_<eos> And you will use it, too, in honor of our guests this evening.<eos> Now sit.<eos> We have more important matters to discuss.<eos> Yes. We do...
Hopefully, one of us'll get lucky.<eos> Like that's ever happened.<eos> Where are the guards?<eos> Protocol would be to leave someone behind.<eos> They did.
We're too late, anyway.<eos> It's already dark.<eos> Raven...<eos> The Raven Reyes I know doesn't give up. She does now.<eos> No, she doesn't.
- I've been better.<eos> Yeah. We all have.<eos> We need to talk about your sister.<eos> Two of our people died today because of her, not to mention the ash-poisoned soil, making the land useless.<eos> The Grounders did that.
Not everyone agrees with Chancellor Pike.<eos> Kane doesn't.<eos> Octavia doesn't.<eos> Your people did not vote for Kane.<eos> Some of them did.
He's in good hands with the boys.<eos> So, um... you, Alec, and Jace are... what, like, family?<eos> Translation, you want to know if Jace and I are a thing.<eos> Why would I care?<eos> Because you do.
- Oh, like, 'cause you like the Lakers... - Uh-huh. ...and then I saw the Lakers won, so...<eos> Lot of people like the Lakers, bro.<eos> - Hey, Wyatt.<eos> - Yeah. You know Gus here wrote a Witchita script, right?<eos> You did?
Lot of people like the Lakers, bro.<eos> - Hey, Wyatt.<eos> - Yeah. You know Gus here wrote a Witchita script, right?<eos> You did?<eos> He did?
- Do you have butterflies?<eos> - Oh, yeah, I have butterflies, and I have a heart murmur, and I got the Hershey squirts.<eos> - But I thought you liked him.<eos> - I do.<eos> I do.
Well, I don't know.<eos> What is up? I thought we had a good time the other night.<eos> - Did we not have a good time?<eos> - Yeah, no, totally.<eos> - We totally did.
Did we land dentine ice?<eos> What?<eos> Sorry, I repurposed the dentine pitch.<eos> But you see what I'm saying?<eos> Yeah. I do.
Of course, I would have replaced the word "Francine"<eos> with "Dentine Ice" in most instances.<eos> Roger...<eos> I like it.<eos> I really do.
Hello?<eos> Yeah, he has it now?<eos> No, have him stay on set, I'll go to him.<eos> Sorry, Cuddahy, work emergency.<eos> Still do work there, for the day anyway.
He wrote The House of Ahasuaris.<eos> Enormous hit.<eos> Made the studio millions of dollars.<eos> Did you see any of those millions of dollars, Ben?<eos> I did not.
And then one day you wake up, and you don't want to go into the office.<eos> You don't wanna make arrangements for people you don't know and don't give a shit about.<eos> You...<eos> You don't wanna do it.<eos> You just don't.
She wants you to pick it up.<eos> You scared, huh?<eos> Oh!<eos> Anybody else want a taste of Blue Thunder?<eos> Uh, I do. Yeah.
It's America.<eos> We think noblesse oblige is a new entrée at Olive Garden.<eos> You know, there's a book that could help you with that.<eos> Sarno?<eos> It didn't.
His father was a shoe salesman... in Philadelphia.<eos> W-well, he talked like a farmer, knew his stuff.<eos> We became friends and, uh...<eos> And he helped you out.<eos> Yep, he did.
Felt like... freedom, you know?<eos> Like I could taste it.<eos> The Galápagos?<eos> I almost got on my boat today and didn't get back off.<eos> Why didn't you?
Open targets in the dunes.<eos> All of us sweating and swearing.<eos> Sure as hell beat sitting on our asses 30 clicks to nowhere waiting for our humpbacked friend to defecate the keys to our transport.<eos> Camels don't eat keys.<eos> They do, it did.
Nothing.<eos> Hey.<eos> You did good finding this place.<eos> Tried to tell you you weren't ready.<eos> We both did.
The administration needs Wall Street money to compete.<eos> Nobody wants this to look like some kind of crusade.<eos> I'm doing my job.<eos> I don't think about what it looks like.<eos> Well, the AG does.
Oh. Great.<eos> And I would if I were sure, you know?<eos> Sure?<eos> You're the one who told me.<eos> I did.
If we pretended today you worked for me, you know what I would tell you to do.<eos> Go home.<eos> Hey. Hey.<eos> Thanks for coming down.<eos> I did it.
I happened to see the file.<eos> If it goes ahead, the building work will last a year.<eos> Then, it'll be very noisy at night.<eos> I have no idea, but I can call the agency.<eos> Yes, please do.
Can you remember what time, love?<eos> I was...<eos> I should've called her.<eos> I just...<eos> I just didn't.
Hold on.<eos> Say he's telling the truth.<eos> Why did she want cash quickly?<eos> And why not turn to the family?<eos> We done a background on them?
She says she went to the pub because she worked there.<eos> Withholding information is as good as lying.<eos> I didn't lie.<eos> Just didn't occur to me, that's all.<eos> She did a couple of shifts now and again.
And it fits with the manner of her death.<eos> That was cruel.<eos> Kicking her when she's down.<eos> I know you think I didn't see ya.<eos> But I did.
Are you sure you're telling me everything you know?<eos> Yeah.<eos> So what's your motive for writing these comments? Hm?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I just did it.
I don't know.<eos> And if I was, so what?<eos> Well, for a start, you've obstructed an investigation into your mother's death.<eos> - That not bother you?<eos> - Of course it does!
30 odd miles, that's nothing to a fit bloke like you, is it?<eos> Not when you're in a nasty mood.<eos> No, I wasn't.<eos> I didn't go anywhere.<eos> Yes, you did. You liar.
- Okay.<eos> - Make his a double.<eos> Do you hear that?<eos> What is that?<eos> Claire, what did you do?
I'm sorry.<eos> It just...<eos> Would...<eos> Would you like to ask me something?<eos> No, don't.
I don't care.<eos> Mm, ah. I know alcoholics drink for volume, not flavor, but this taste like burnt hair.<eos> Did you even look at the talking points?<eos> You know what?<eos> I didn't.
"The Herald," "The Post,"<eos> "New York Times"...<eos> page three over the fold...<eos> - Well, no one reads that one.<eos> - I do.
Somebody get me an almond-milk latte.<eos> - Gus!<eos> - What? - It's his family.<eos> - So? So, I promised him I would give him a heads up before we ran with anything.<eos> Well, I didn't.
You know I do.<eos> Today's miracle was created not just by the citizens of Maine, but by its tireless law-enforcement officers, particularly Supervisory Special Agent Gabe Clements of the FBI and Detective Nina Meyer.<eos> On behalf of the whole city, let's thank them for being our heroes!<eos> I-I meant to give it to you for Christmas.<eos> Why didn't you?
I think he's got the yips or something.<eos> We need to make sure he's not crashing.<eos> We'll go scoop him up.<eos> DeGiulio knows about our informant.<eos> Of course he does.
I don't wanna stop you, Chuck.<eos> No, we were just finishing up.<eos> All right, get out there and make some fucking money.<eos> You got a handle on this?<eos> I do not.
We need to get circular with our thinking.<eos> Turn the impediments into our own blockers.<eos> Don't worry. I know what I'm talking about.<eos> He wanted to see me?<eos> He did, but not right now.
You wanted to?<eos> I think I should have, maybe.<eos> Last time you did?<eos> - Oh, I don't know.<eos> - Sure you do.
Fuck, yeah.<eos> [helicopter blades whirring] [beer sloshes] You know, I think you're right about me, Lu.<eos> I'm not your ballsy big sister who doesn't give two shits.<eos> I'm not your ballsy big sister who doesn't give two shits. The old me would've told Bobby to go fuck himself for blowing me off to talk to Wendy Rhoades all night.<eos> So why didn't you?
I didn't say you're closed off about everything.<eos> Just everything emotional.<eos> It's just standard dude stuff, I guess.<eos> I'm sorry, I don't want you to think I'm being super critical.<eos> No, I don't.
No.<eos> I was afraid.<eos> I didn't have anywhere else to turn.<eos> I didn't know where else to turn.<eos> And now we do.
Assuming Bobbi and Hunter.<eos> The other figures moving in the room... assume bad guys.<eos> One of them has powers, so best we avoid him.<eos> To that end...<eos> At S.H.I.E.L.D., we do better than duct tape.
Maybe you're not supposed to get over it.<eos> Some things you can't move past.<eos> They scar you, change you permanently.<eos> I don't know what happened there, on that planet.<eos> I do.
All available guards to lock-up.<eos> - Go.<eos> - Sir.<eos> I don't suppose you know anything about this.<eos> As a matter of fact, I do.
Give me the kit.<eos> I know you don't want Ontari to get the Flame.<eos> She murdered those kids, children you raised.<eos> Lexa's spirit would never choose - to do something like that.<eos> - Yes, she did.
Announce my ascension.<eos> You don't have the Flame, Ontari.<eos> Don't talk to me as if I'm a fool, Roan.<eos> No one knows that.<eos> He does.
Sign me up.<eos> What the hell was that fo...<eos> I know all about you, John Murphy.<eos> - Ah, you do, huh?<eos> - Yeah. I do.
Just curious.<eos> I don't.<eos> If I wanted to hear some college kid whining about how being 19 was hard, I'd ask Tamara.<eos> - What about you, Matty?<eos> - I don't.
Anything.<eos> Could you tell me where to find the Mortal Cup?<eos> I wish I could... but I don't know.<eos> Clary knows.<eos> No, she doesn't.
Try to get him outside.<eos> We'll send the containment module down to the South exit.<eos> Yeah, be careful.<eos> He's an assassin, and we don't know what his powers are yet.<eos> Perhaps we do.
So, you do not work for S.H.I.E.L.D.<eos> - I do not.<eos> - Doesn't exist anymore.<eos> And you're telling me they don't work - for any U.S. government agency. - No.<eos> They do not.
So do you know why he stayed with the Reverend Haleford over Christmas?<eos> Church just down the road from you.<eos> Oh... We... We thought he was at the fairground.<eos> - Oh, I thought you kept in touch.<eos> - Yeah, we did.
- Well, that's just as well.<eos> You've got two witnesses sat here saw you throw the first punch.<eos> You said you were looking at the Pevenseys.<eos> I just wanted to ask that fairground owner whether he knew Brendan.<eos> And did he?
I'm sick of my mum trying to break us up.<eos> Was that the only reason?<eos> Yeah.<eos> - Does Harris love you?<eos> - Yeah, of course he does.
- So did you whack him a bit too hard?<eos> - You killed him.<eos> - No.<eos> You don't remember when Harris broke his arm?<eos> Well, yeah, of course I do.
You're gonna shut off your brain... and breathe into your body.<eos> - Close your eyes... relax... and let me do all the work.<eos> What the fuck?<eos> I thought you cut the throttle cable.<eos> I did.
Uh, lunch, beers, finish up the bike.<eos> Good?<eos> Good.<eos> I picked up a couple steaks.<eos> No, you didn't.
We can't all just run off to some other...<eos> No one put a gun to your head!<eos> You didn't have to take this house.<eos> You could've sold it.<eos> But I didn't.
But I promise I will make sure they take good care of you because you were the best horse ever.<eos> A true friend.<eos> Even if sometimes I might have taken you for granted, you were always there for me... and you never held it against me if I got a little bitchy because you knew how much I loved you, even if I didn't say it<eos> as much as I should have.<eos> But I did.
A true friend.<eos> Even if sometimes I might have taken you for granted, you were always there for me... and you never held it against me if I got a little bitchy because you knew how much I loved you, even if I didn't say it<eos> as much as I should have.<eos> But I did.<eos> And I do.
But of all the people that I don't see I don't see Caleb the most.<eos> Or the least.<eos> Uh, it's nice you keep in contact.<eos> I barely see any of my friends from high school.<eos> Oh, we didn't, uh, for a while.
-No.<eos> -Good.<eos> Your female instinct, what does it tell you?<eos> I don't have one.<eos> Of course you do.
And you left them there.<eos> I thought you'd left me.<eos> Well, I said I was coming back.<eos> - You did?<eos> Yes, you did.
Ahmad was injured.<eos> My best guess is they've sought shelter.<eos> You mean your best hope.<eos> You know the likelihood of surviving the steppe, on foot, north of Khantai Gorge.<eos> I do, very well, as do my trackers.
Maybe.<eos> -That's not what I'm meant to be.<eos> -And I am?<eos> -So you want it?<eos> -What if I did?
- I'm so sorry.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> So, I'm just finding my feet again.<eos> You understand?<eos> I do.
Ugh. Rich-girl problems are the worst.<eos> Look, you may have called, but I still said yes.<eos> I was excited to come here.<eos> I actually thought that I might meet someone.<eos> Oh, and you did.
You show me how it's done.<eos> Okay.<eos> Cynthia was right.<eos> I stole my kid.<eos> I did.
Awesome.<eos> - You're fired. - Hey.<eos> That's my focus puller.<eos> You can't fire him.<eos> And yet, I just did.
- What?<eos> Chet has the suitor?<eos> How did you let Darius out of your sight?<eos> You should've had a P.A. superglued to his ass.<eos> - I did...
Copy that.<eos> I didn't mean to hurt her.<eos> You know that, right?<eos> She stepped on my hand.<eos> I really didn't.
You lied about foster care today, - even after I told you about my cousin. - What?<eos> You lied about everything your mother, the scars.<eos> That's not right.<eos> - Not right at all.<eos> - I didn't.
You have gone on a couple of dates and kissed, like, two girls.<eos> Rachel, he's leaving.<eos> This show is not worth...<eos> Do you know that there's a reporter on set?<eos> Do you?
Okay, it is a very grave situation.<eos> Very grave.<eos> Rachel said he was okay.<eos> Well, Rachel doesn't know what she's talking about, okay?<eos> - I do.
Still in your dress, huh?<eos> Um, my zipper got stuck.<eos> Okay, thanks.<eos> Jeremy can't get away with this.<eos> He didn't.
You know what that looks like?<eos> Do you know what that feels like?<eos> You told the whole world that I was too demanding, that I was some kind of sassy, stuck-up bitch.<eos> - I never said that, Ru...<eos> - You did.
Tiffany's not the only one who can be a football princess... or a queen.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Finally... someone who gets me.<eos> Aww. I do, honey.<eos> I really, really do.
I'm sorry.<eos> Coleman told me.<eos> - Him and Yael, they...<eos> - Yeah, I know all about them.<eos> No, no, you don't.
So I guess I have you to thank for Booth reaching out to me, huh?<eos> Oh, no, it was all his doing.<eos> Turns out the network really loves their little boy wonder.<eos> No, I'm saying you told him to cut Rachel out.<eos> Yeah, I did.
- Yeah?<eos> Good. - Yeah, I am.<eos> You know, Madison wants to get you in hair and make-up<eos> Are you taking orders from Madison now?<eos> Yeah, just doing my job, just doing my job.
I forget that you guys don't get to see it.<eos> That is not fair!<eos> Just because I'm trying to stay classy in a room full of skanks, like...<eos> I get that.<eos> I totally do.
I felt it was time.<eos> Time for what?<eos> To reveal my true self.<eos> You said you killed him.<eos> I did.
We're square.<eos> Thank you.<eos> She'd been very upset a couple of months ago in class.<eos> I gave her my number, in case she wanted to talk.<eos> And did she?
Which means it did.<eos> Playing Tonk.<eos> Is that right?<eos> - No, you di'int.<eos> - Yes, I did.
- Where's Stephanie now, Gideon?<eos> I was foolish.<eos> I thought that I could bring back the Hydra and guide it the same way Stephanie commanded that horse.<eos> I taught her to have faith in it as a god.<eos> And she did.
You know what?<eos> Forget that.<eos> Um, I'm sorry I even asked.<eos> - You want me to be your alibi? - No.<eos> No, I don't.
- Hey, baby<eos> Hi!<eos> Hey!<eos> Please don't tell me I miss someone's birthday<eos> - No, you didn't
Hi!<eos> Hey!<eos> Please don't tell me I miss someone's birthday<eos> - No, you didn't<eos> - No, you didn't, mamma
Yeah.<eos> Will, I know you're in there.<eos> Open up.<eos> This better be good, like I won the lottery good.<eos> You did.
Where does this evidence go?<eos> Jesus.<eos> This is very bad.<eos> You understand that, right?<eos> Yes, of course we do.
I'm... I'm curious.<eos> Uh, Geronimo's capture.<eos> Did you let our Hosts know?<eos> Do they know that we have issues with the Resistance?<eos> Of course they do.
Yes, um, after you escaped into the hole, how did you perfectly re-attach the Raquel Welch poster from inside the hole with a tautness that a rock could pierce?<eos> Does it really matter?<eos> It does to me.<eos> Did you even like the movie?<eos> I did very much up until that point.
Do people die like this?<eos> Yes.<eos> But you won't.<eos> How do you know that?<eos> I just do.
But you won't.<eos> How do you know that?<eos> I just do.<eos> That's ridiculous!<eos> You just do!
You know, uh...<eos> They always told me the world down there was no good.<eos> They'd gone and they'd lost everything that made life worth living.<eos> But me and you, we know that ain't all true.<eos> Oh, we do?
Know something?<eos> I don't know what to say to you.<eos> You already said it without saying it's what I'd say.<eos> I cannot go back down there, G'win, and you know it.<eos> Do I?
As a husband and a father.<eos> I mean, well, this isn't the sort of thing I'd agree to do normally, without an important reason.<eos> Of course.<eos> Did I ever tell you I started out as a lab assistant?<eos> Of course, I did, right?
Yes.<eos> I can try.<eos> I hope this is a new beginning for us.<eos> We deserve it.<eos> Yes, we do.
My father enlisted me in the army.<eos> Wanted to make a man of me.<eos> But I could've refused.<eos> I could've deserted.<eos> Well, why didn't you?
I would never harm anyone.<eos> I can't even imagine wanting to.<eos> Please.<eos> You must believe me.<eos> Oh, I do, Mr. Balfour.
I can't even imagine wanting to.<eos> Please.<eos> You must believe me.<eos> Oh, I do, Mr. Balfour.<eos> I most certainly do.
- Sorry.<eos> - You ruined it.<eos> Why would I want to ruin your yearbook photo?<eos> Maybe because you haven't signed up for your own photo yet?<eos> Yes, I did.
I don't even know if he goes here.<eos> Do you go to this school?<eos> What's your name?<eos> You haven't signed up for your own photo yet?<eos> Yes, I did.
Update --<eos> Feel like sharing?<eos> If it becomes a thing, I'll let you know.<eos> You didn't tell him about Daisy.<eos> No, I didn't.
No, he's not.<eos> Oliver Queen is dead.<eos> How did Oliver die?<eos> I don't know.<eos> No one does.
It wasn't me.<eos> It wasn't me, I don't know where he is.<eos> Hold on. Hold on.<eos> You suspect that Tomás Garrido was the person in the room?<eos> Don't you?
I'll wait for you in the Hotel Bellavista.<eos> **He couldn't have known about the swamp.<eos> The area where you buried him is full of swampy lakes and the locals know it.<eos> Tomás Garrido only had to toss a coin in the air and wait for you to bite.<eos> And you did.
- What are you doing? - Calling the police.<eos> Listen, it wasn't our fault, it was the damn deer.<eos> Are you crazy?<eos> - What if he saw something?<eos> - He didn't.
They're alive.<eos> I mean the Chimeras.<eos> Some of them, not all of them.<eos> I know.<eos> Oh, you do?
I'm pretty sure you'll get a chance.<eos> Well, not down here.<eos> We've been walking around for hours and all we've been able to find is some stupid snake sculpture on the wall.<eos> You think it's important?<eos> You didn't.
Have you ever actually put that thing on someone?<eos> Not in years.<eos> Close the doors, would you?<eos> How do you know it still works?<eos> I don't.
I have a guy on the inside.<eos> And stop changing the subject.<eos> Do your thing.<eos> It didn't work.<eos> No, it didn't.
Please...<eos> You can't help him.<eos> That's big.<eos> No one said it was that big.<eos> I did.
In the cellar.<eos> You'll find what you're looking for in the cellar.<eos> Go ahead.<eos> Release the arrow.<eos> Do it, Marie-Jeanne.
Don't listen to her.<eos> I'm not going to stop, Malia.<eos> I'm taking back what you stole from me.<eos> I didn't steal anything.<eos> But you did.
Thank you so much for joining me.<eos> I know how busy you must be.<eos> But we're gonna be working together on this eviction so I thought, well, let's break some bread.<eos> I've always been friends of y'all, you know that.<eos> Mm, I do.
Me getting sick?<eos> Why is that funny?<eos> You dying' after spending half a year in that box.<eos> I don't know, but I find that very funny.<eos> Of course you do.
I can't figure you out, Barry Allen.<eos> That is because I work hard to hide who I really am.<eos> You don't have to hide with me.<eos> I just have to really trust someone if they're gonna know the truth.<eos> Do you?
Even better.<eos> Go gays!<eos> Now get out of my face!<eos> I don't get paid to lock up after you losers.<eos> Yes, you do.
I'm genuinely curious because it must be wonderfully liberating to only see what you want to see.<eos> You know what I'm curious about?<eos> - Hmm. - Why the Phoenix Stone made my mother a character in my hellscape when it had so many other options of torture to choose from.<eos> And this is why I begged Bonnie to get Stefan out first.<eos> Well, why didn't she?
We are returning to camp.<eos> I insist.<eos> You are not yourself.<eos> Do you want leave to see your peach of a sweetheart?<eos> Do you, Henry?
Ha ha ha!<eos> You love this, don't you?<eos> I'm gonna die knowing my own son hates me.<eos> Yes.<eos> He does.
The moment he looks at you as he looked at me.<eos> The moment you know he is in love with you, you're going to do something for me.<eos> You will drink this blood of mine, and then you will slit your own throat and bleed out silently.<eos> You will want to cry out, but you will not make a sound.<eos> She did this to me.
Led by that unquenchable desire to slay his children, Mikael descended, accompanied by a small army.<eos> He laid to waste everything that I built.<eos> So... we had no choice but to run.<eos> Come with me.<eos> Aya did not.
- I need a number.<eos> Nine, eight and a half, I....<eos> Eight and a quarter.<eos> She had notes.<eos> Did she?
Yeah, well, be glad that they do because if they thought that we had a new A, they would march straight down to the police station.<eos> You guys, our stalker already warned us.<eos> Okay?<eos> If we talk to the cops we're gonna have targets on our backs.<eos> We already do!
I already told you everything I know, John.<eos> I'm not here to ask you any questions, Andy.<eos> Thank you for coming.<eos> Yeah, I'm, uh...<eos> Glad I did.
Vengeance and retribution are useless pursuits.<eos> For one thing, they don't pay.<eos> I'm here for Rubicon, and you--you're gonna give me the codes to access it.<eos> You know I can't do that.<eos> I do.
I don't even know why I'm surprised.<eos> You're surprised because you're hoping that he's the parent you've always wanted him to be, the parent you deserve.<eos> In an extremely ironic role reversal, my mother was smarter than me.<eos> She said, "People don't change, no matter how much you want them to."<eos> Some people don't.
There's only one way o prevent that.<eos> My father once told me of an elixir known as Lotus, capable of countering he effects of the Lazarus Pit.<eos> A secret weapon developed by the League's enemies.<eos> Do you have it?<eos> I do.
Reiter's pet.<eos> You don't know what you're talking about.<eos> I know you killed Vlad.<eos> I watched.<eos> We all did.
Palmer Technologies' power cell.<eos> Exactly. Once I solved that, I knew this might actually work.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> I don't know what to say.<eos> I do.
Yeah, well, if you were listening to her little asides, you would know that was not true.<eos> John--heh heh--you were the one who told me to give her time.<eos> OK.<eos> Do you want to get back together with her?<eos> I do.
Something you're free to challenge on cross-examination.<eos> Continue, Ms. Lance.<eos> What else did you do for the defendant?<eos> He wanted me to give him access to the SCPD computer network.<eos> I did it.
What else did you do for the defendant?<eos> He wanted me to give him access to the SCPD computer network.<eos> I did it.<eos> He wanted me to give him the departmental patrol schedules.<eos> I did that.
[Clatter]<eos> Alex?<eos> Hey. Morning.<eos> And here I thought you were gonna sleep past breakfast.<eos> I... I almost did.
No bees.<eos> What--are you ok?<eos> Does the word Ravenspur mean anything to you?<eos> If this is something to do with your father, honey--<eos> So it does.
I might have something.<eos> Now, until the FBI gets their way, smartphones are protected by encryption.<eos> If you don't enter your passcode after enough times, then the device bricks itself, right?<eos> Curtis, I don't even have the time to tell you that I don't have the time.<eos> You just did.
I know. When you two were married, it was like living at the gap.<eos> Hey, what did Noah mean when he said that he didn't have much choice in the matter when he left?<eos> I always just assumed he disappeared.<eos> He didn't disappear, hon.<eos> I did.
Hey, what did Noah mean when he said that he didn't have much choice in the matter when he left?<eos> I always just assumed he disappeared.<eos> He didn't disappear, hon.<eos> I did.<eos> We did.
I did.<eos> We did.<eos> I had a 7-year-old daughter, and I know all about gambling, and I wasn't willing to take the bet that your father could possibly change.<eos> He let me believe that he abandoned us.<eos> Well, I don't...
Shattered.<eos> We shattered his arm.<eos> You what?<eos> ! I never told you to do that!<eos> You didn't?
It's true.<eos> No one ever takes the time to ask how I feel.<eos> Brian's the only one.<eos> They don't get us, Bonnie, and you deserve better than this.<eos> We both do.
Uh, actually, you owe me $20.<eos> Ew. Here's $50, go change your underwear.<eos> It won't come off.<eos> Hey, Peter, you want to earn another ten bucks?<eos> Course I do.
- What?<eos> - You're pretty smart.<eos> Went to college, got your education, sitting behind your desk.<eos> You think you know me.<eos> Well, yes, I do.
It's definitely haunted.<eos> You know, some people think that ghosts are just replays. Traumatic events recorded into their surroundings... Into time.<eos> And there are the sedatives.<eos> You don't believe in ghosts, do you?<eos> I don't.
It always begins with death. Doesn't it, Alfred?<eos> I'm as astonished as you are, Master Dick.<eos> Anyone mind filling me in?<eos> How do you know her?<eos> I just do.
You just don't look the part.<eos> What's a cop supposed to look like?<eos> Not as hot as you.<eos> Did I just say that out loud?<eos> Uh... yeah, you did.
I think we got another beatboxer in the office.<eos> Ders, go in there and then rap over his flow, and I'll FaceTime Pauly.<eos> - Yeah, I'll do that, yeah.<eos> - You got his number!<eos> Yes, I did.
I let you go, you'll deliver the Waverider.<eos> Yes.<eos> Do we have an accord?<eos> You think your friends will believe you were able to escape?<eos> Not unless I do this.
Is this Leonard Snart coming to God in his final moments?<eos> Hardly.<eos> Just wishing I could take a few things back.<eos> I should've left Mick in future Star City.<eos> Why didn't you?
Told you.<eos> Those pirates picked the wrong guy to mess with.<eos> Since when does Rory even know how to fly the jump ship?<eos> How did he even find us?<eos> Actually, I did the flying.
Friends who will turn on you, who will try and sabotage the connection we share.<eos> Only because they don't understand, but they will if we can make them share our connection.<eos> You want to put your friends through the Kree experiment.<eos> Once Radcliffe has worked out the kinks, yeah.<eos> Yeah, I do.
Anyone so much as sneezes, and it might kill you.<eos> So until you've fully recovered, you are a prisoner... you're my prisoner.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I-I just don't know what to do.<eos> None of us do.
We needed to drain actual Kree blood.<eos> Which is what I have pumping through my veins.<eos> Coulson used it to bring me back after Quinn shot me.<eos> Ward should remember.<eos> He does.
I lost her, Sidney.<eos> I loved her and I lost her.<eos> Some days I can barely go on.<eos> - I didn't think you liked me.<eos> - I didn't.
Get off me!<eos> Please, Mr Redmond!<eos> Please.<eos> - You knew where he was.<eos> - I didn't.
- may be put into writing...<eos> So what does the day hold for you?<eos> Nothing eventful.<eos> - Do you remember when we first met?<eos> - Course I do.
- The Bishop will have something...<eos> - to say about this.<eos> Yes.<eos> I knew you were going to say that.<eos> He did.
You remember that-- you remember that trip to Italy? It was so amazing.<eos> - Amazing times.<eos> - It was so amazing.<eos> Do you remember the thing you kept doing in Naples?<eos> You don't?
Not once.<eos> So, don't take the moral high ground.<eos> You just sound like the hypocrite you are.<eos> I need to know exactly what happened to Robbie Morton and Michael Thompson before I continue to protect you.<eos> No, you don't!
You walked away... .. and you closed the door, and then, you just left him there?<eos> And you just pretended to look for him?<eos> I wanted Michael to get the blame when Robbie was reported missing.<eos> I thought you would find him! I did!<eos> I really, really did!
He would have died if I hadn't helped him.<eos> I took him home and made him coffee.<eos> but I doubt it.<eos> I get up early....<eos> I did something terrible.
Unless you're arresting and charging me, I don't have to give you prints.<eos> And any prints you DO take without my consent are unusable in court.<eos> So, again -- no.<eos> - You know your rights.<eos> - Aye, I do.
I know...<eos> I know you need answers.<eos> I will do my best.<eos> Do you reject sin so as to live in the freedom of God's children?<eos> I do.
I will do my best.<eos> Do you reject sin so as to live in the freedom of God's children?<eos> I do.<eos> Do you reject the glamour of evil and refuse to be mastered by sin?<eos> I do.
I do.<eos> Do you believe in God, the Father Almighty,<eos> - creator of heaven and Earth?<eos> - I do. Do you believe in Jesus Christ, his only son our Lord, who was born of the Virgin Mary, was crucified, died and was buried, rose from the dead and is now seated at the right hand of the Father?<eos> I do.
- Good!<eos> Go!<eos> What the fuck?<eos> I thought you cut the throttle cable.<eos> I did.
'Asha, it's Jimmy Perez.'<eos> Michael Thompson and Robbie Morton - they were father and son.<eos> Did you know that?<eos> No.<eos> I didn't.
- Ah, Ms. Winters.<eos> General Halabi, this is Stella Winters, another potential investor from London.<eos> A pleasure to meet you, General.<eos> I think I found Edith's jewels.<eos> You did not.
General Halabi, this is Stella Winters, another potential investor from London.<eos> A pleasure to meet you, General.<eos> I think I found Edith's jewels.<eos> You did not.<eos> No, I didn't.
So... is there any way that you want to talk about what's going on with you and Val?<eos> Uh, it's complicated.<eos> No, it's not.<eos> She'll forgive you.<eos> I did.
You two look cozy in here.<eos> Shouldn't you be in the Security wing, Shawn?<eos> What is wrong with you?<eos> Do you not know those people are?<eos> I do.
Zara!<eos> So that's it, then.<eos> They've gone.<eos> I don't suppose she gave you a check.<eos> She did.
And technically, I can't trust you.<eos> I mean, I shouldn't, right?<eos> So what are we gonna do?<eos> We don't even really know each other.<eos> Yes, we do.
I want to help.<eos> You want to help me steal a bracelet?<eos> I want to help you not die.<eos> You don't know anything about these people... who they are or how they work.<eos> No, I don't.
Even the QR19 software couldn't find a match.<eos> So we don't know anything.<eos> We don't know where she is, what she's doing.<eos> We have no way to find her.<eos> We actually do.
Sweetie.<eos> You will have an affair with your personal trainer.<eos> You know, who knows?<eos> We just don't know.<eos> We don't, do we?
Well, I said no, of course.<eos> W...<eos> I'm not gonna sit here and say to you and Morgan that marriage is an outdated concept and then turn around and marry him.<eos> Yeah, but you love him, don't you?<eos> Of course I do.
Nothing else matters.<eos> That he loves me.<eos> And then he returned the money he'd stolen from a Kuroqi princess.<eos> I don't suppose she gave you a check.<eos> - She did.
- Go.<eos> Thank you so much.<eos> I think you messed something up.<eos> Really?<eos> No, I didn't.
You know you didn't kill me.<eos> I did.<eos> How do you know that?<eos> Mother told me.<eos> You didn't.
I love you.<eos> Say something else.<eos> No.<eos> You don't love me.<eos> Yes, I do.
Criminal organizations are faster because they don't forgive inefficiency.<eos> At the risk of seeming too materialistic, Your Eminence, do you know how much the Vatican coffers lose for every day that passes without any new papal merchandizing on the market?<eos> Not exactly.<eos> - Now do you understand why I need the Holy Father's immediate approval?<eos> Yes, I do.
No... how?<eos> By learning people's secrets and threatening to reveal those secrets to the Pope.<eos> One bottle of gin doesn't make an alcoholic of me.<eos> Agreed.<eos> One bottle doesn't.
You have sinned, Esther.<eos> We know and we understand that this was a moment of weakness.<eos> It happens.<eos> As a boy, whenever Napoli, my favourite soccer team, was in serious trouble, don't you think I found myself being a little sympathetic toward Avellino?<eos> Yes, I did.
Last of all, just a few short weeks before the elections, the Pope says just two words:<eos> "non expedit".<eos> - Do you know what that means?<eos> - No.<eos> No, of course you don't.
- Why didn't you think of that'?<eos> It has to be in writing.<eos> - You need the proof before they arrive.<eos> - Don't you ever think ahead?<eos> - Yes, I do.
But I do need to tell you something.<eos> - Whatever it is, you can tell me.<eos> - I have reason to believe that my mother is insane and might be killing people.<eos> - You know if you make that accusation, I will have to report this to the authorities.<eos> - I do.
Or be blown to bits.<eos> Did you notice the heat?<eos> - I increased the temperature because ...<eos> - We figured it out, yeah.<eos> Yeah, I did.
- I remember that pain ... sick with guilt, anger.<eos> I know why you went to face Hive alone.<eos> I tried.<eos> I tried to defeat him.<eos> - I did, but I ...
I don't suppose you came with any concrete ideas.<eos> I have one.<eos> Coulson's gonna need your help.<eos> I don't know what he's planning, but ...<eos> - I do.
- Well, she's 17... - It's normal.<eos> - She's going out with Gregorio.<eos> - So ? They're an item.<eos> - I don't like him.<eos> - She does.
- Guerrilla warfare.<eos> What happened ?<eos> I found condoms in her bag.<eos> No !<eos> - God, what if Rosa does that ?
- It might be fun.<eos> - Think so ?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Come on ! Let's do it.<eos> - Do what ?
Yes, it's like when we played truth or dare as kids.<eos> So what ?<eos> We used to jerk off together as kids too.<eos> - I didn'tjerk offwith you.<eos> - No, you did it alone.
- No.<eos> Yes...<eos> I don't know, a bit.<eos> - You never wanted to before.<eos> - I do now.
So you better tell the Inspector.<eos> Tell him what?<eos> That Owen did it!<eos> We don't know that for sure.<eos> Course we do!
We have no mass, no confession.<eos> All we can do is pray.<eos> How did you know we were here?<eos> Who told you?<eos> Did one of the faithful?
Taking Out The Trash.<eos> - Charming.<eos> We'll have to ring Special Branch to even use the password.<eos> Some 14-year-old on the other side of the world can access it, but we have to ask if we're allowed.<eos> No, we don't.
What?<eos> You put me back on envelope duty?<eos> Brett will set you up.<eos> Charlotte, I don't understand.<eos> No, apparently you don't.
You serve at my pleasure.<eos> Whatever I've been kind enough to give you, I can take back just as quickly.<eos> Like the medical care we're providing for your son.<eos> I would never to anything to jeopardize my position with you.<eos> Well, you did.
I get it.<eos> You'll always protect me, no matter what.<eos> Even if I hate you for it.<eos> You deserve to be free of Klaus.<eos> We all do.
The hunger.<eos> I'd like to blame my anger on Finn, but it's been growing worse since I came back.<eos> I never did learn how to keep it in check.<eos> I never really cared to.<eos> But now you do.
Is it not enough that we're forced to play her wretched games?<eos> Freya saw a vision of herself buried alive.<eos> Aurora will do everything in her power to bring about this miserable prophecy.<eos> Let's go stop her, shall we?<eos> What did you do to me?
This is a fight to the death, and I won't lose.<eos> Why are you doing this?<eos> You really need to ask that?<eos> Can you honestly defend them?<eos> After what they did to me?
You can't get in unless she invites you.<eos> Hmm, perhaps I'll lure him out another way.<eos> If killing his girlfriend didn't get him out of the house,<eos> I don't know what will.<eos> I do.
I kept Hayley breathing!<eos> I kept white oak from piercing your cold, black heart.<eos> I did everything!<eos> We know.<eos> No, you don't.
I kept white oak from piercing your cold, black heart.<eos> I did everything!<eos> We know.<eos> No, you don't.<eos> No, you don't.
Van Nguyen.<eos> All grown up, I see.<eos> Not that it matters, man.<eos> This ain't got nothing to do with you.<eos> Actually, it does.
I'd like to see you try.<eos> You're brandishing your antiques at me.<eos> I suppose I would be scared if I thought you were quick enough to use them.<eos> You really did not think this through, did you?<eos> Actually, we did.
What the hell did I say if you woke me up again?<eos> !<eos> Huh?<eos> !<eos> - Just do it already, man.
!<eos> Huh?<eos> !<eos> - Just do it already, man.<eos> - Yeah, do it already, man, yeah.
Mole mass and mass mass?<eos> Stoichiometry?<eos> I don't get any of it.<eos> Do you?<eos> Of course you do.
Hey, kid!<eos> Aah!<eos> You don't remember our faces.<eos> Say it.<eos> I don't, I don't.
Yeah, when was that?<eos> I don't know.<eos> It was probably about... about 15 years ago.<eos> You got a last name for your father?<eos> Uh... n-no, I don't.
What's she want with him?<eos> Don't know.<eos> Oh, you pay your respect to the Bren'in, for she had a long reign.<eos> And that ends tonight.<eos> Yes, it does.
And it turns over when you put the key in.<eos> Thought they weren't hiring yet.<eos> I made a good impression on the right people, I guess.<eos> And they give you a truck?<eos> For managers, they do.
One phone call, that's it.<eos> Did you want people to get hurt?<eos> No, I did what you asked me to do.<eos> Does Foster have guns?<eos> Does he?
He died by his fire, and so will you.<eos> All right. All right.<eos> You're right, Ma.<eos> All right, I deserve to perish.<eos> I do.
No.<eos> You're all we got, fa.<eos> You're the only one that knows what we should do, knows the price of our living'.<eos> You tell Shurn that I pain for her, and I'm sorry about her Tice.<eos> Did already.
And you do agreeth with me on that?<eos> W-well, yes, ma'am, but...<eos> Who is that?<eos> You know who it is...<eos> And so do i.
- Stay right there!<eos> You heard him, Foster.<eos> - We got orders to shoot.<eos> - Well, go on!<eos> Do it then.
This is witches' glove.<eos> I've never tasted anything like it.<eos> Now don't worry. Just a touch.<eos> You don't know everything that I do.<eos> No, I don't.
My guy doesn't know anything.<eos> How 'bout yours?<eos> Well, he didn't kill Breece.<eos> - Well, how do you know?<eos> - 'Cause I do.
That's why you're paying for it.<eos> We had a blast.<eos> You should have come.<eos> Wings and ass don't go together, Neil.<eos> Sure, they do.
I don't want to fight with you.<eos> It's just, uh...<eos> I just wish that it'd ended up better between you and me, you know?<eos> We would be scratching each other's eyes out by now.<eos> But I do, too.
I'm gonna be out late tonight.<eos> Why?<eos> Where are you going?<eos> I miss him.<eos> We all do, Bear.
How are you?<eos> Can I help you?<eos> Did you fix a furnace for a Norma Bates?<eos> Oh, um, yeah.<eos> Yeah, I did.
She was my wife.<eos> I am so sorry for your loss.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Did you, uh, explain to her that the old furnace was lethal?<eos> Uh, actually, I did, yeah.
You did.<eos> I'm sure I can contribute more if I was just put in a position to.<eos> Did you know the Mandels?<eos> No.<eos> Not many people in the LA art community did.
- Break them.<eos> I always have to watch her.<eos> I'm not her parent.<eos> You and Dad are.<eos> - You do it.
Plus, he kept asking what Valentine's room looked like.<eos> He was interested in Valentine's style?<eos> Fascinating...<eos> No, he thought I might have seen something that could help us find him.<eos> And did you?
Then I'm glad you did it for you.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You have an interesting effect on people, Clary Fray.<eos> He helped save Luke's life.<eos> You all did.
She made provisions just in case it did. The potion, Dot...<eos> Jocelyn said that I should tell you everything about our past.<eos> - That it would unlock you. - What does that even mean?<eos> I don't know!<eos> But you do.
War changes people.<eos> Sometimes they see things they can't unsee.<eos> Come home to find home's not there anymore.<eos> It changed.<eos> Or maybe they did.
What did Hector say?<eos> Oh, he just said I, uh, I made a miracle out of him.<eos> I told you.<eos> I told you everything would work out, didn't I?<eos> Yeah, you did.
If we needed to, I would have called Luke.<eos> I just want to know if he's all right.<eos> I saw him.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> You did?
I think, uh... I think I might have helped save a little boy.<eos> Reverend says that I saved you too.<eos> All I know is I put you here.<eos> I made you like this.<eos> After what you did to me...
If I drove it out of her too, then why is she lying in there like a fucking-- like that?<eos> You know, exorcisms, they're different as the souls they taint.<eos> Now, it's gone.<eos> And when it went away... that thing, it took part of Sarah with it.<eos> Yeah, but what if it didn't?
Things may have gone very wrong for Old West you and whoever she loved who wasn't Carter.<eos> But?<eos> But Old West you didn't know Ray Palmer.<eos> She didn't love Ray Palmer.<eos> You do.
My choice.<eos> And I'm sorry.<eos> I'm alone in the world, Matthew.<eos> Do you know what that feels like?<eos> Of course you do.
Would be fun, like old times.<eos> Oh, you and I, we have very different ideas of fun.<eos> You can say whatever you want.<eos> - But I know you...<eos> - No, you don't.
Oh, you and I, we have very different ideas of fun.<eos> You can say whatever you want.<eos> - But I know you...<eos> - No, you don't.<eos> You don't, not anymore.
Oh, my God.<eos> You have a pair on you. Mmm?<eos> This may come as a surprise to you, but I've actually moved on in the ten years since you left.<eos> I'm seeing someone now, which is only part of the reason why I have zero interest in ever starting anything up with you ever again.<eos> Of course you do.
Sleep even better when he's dead.<eos> Uh, dead?<eos> Well, lethal injection, probably, although the electric chair is a possibility.<eos> New York doesn't have the death penalty.<eos> Yeah, but Delaware does.
Then I heard her shout.<eos> Scream.<eos> It was a grown man.<eos> Who did you see?<eos> I didn't.
- Can we please just--<eos> - Just a sec.<eos> Okay, um... look.<eos> - All right, you see him?<eos> - Sure do.
Where is Frank Castle?<eos> Not here.<eos> Did you have anything to do with his release?<eos> You don't have to answer that.<eos> No, I didn't.
I don't know what you expect from me... but we're finished here.<eos> Mr. Donovan.<eos> Vanessa.<eos> You asked me if I remember the art gallery.<eos> I do.
Tracking heartbeats is kids' stuff.<eos> Time to go deeper.<eos> Track their breath.<eos> Sooner or later, they gotta... exhale.<eos> When they do...
Let's get you out of here.<eos> Hello, boys.<eos> Do you remember when we met... you told me you'd never abandon me?<eos> It's funny. For the life of me... I can't remember being so naive I'd believe you.<eos> But I did.
Now you could either try and kill us, and prove them right.<eos> Or you could save Stick... and prove them wrong.<eos> You never know when to give up, do you?<eos> No.<eos> And neither does he.
This guy's a ghost.<eos> He works alone or close to it.<eos> I just--<eos> -How do you know?<eos> -I just do.
Without this, I'm not alive.<eos> I'm not. Not really.<eos> And I know that now, thanks to you.<eos> I don't know what we are together, and if we have any chance in the future...<eos> I don't...
They knew that Frank's team had to come to them.<eos> Fish in a barrel.<eos> So to speak.<eos> Only fish don't know they're gonna die.<eos> These men did.
What happened that day?<eos> The day your family was so tragically killed.<eos> It's okay, Frank.<eos> - I understand, it's difficult.<eos> - Do you?
Oh, my God.<eos> If we don't move real soon, we could get ourselves killed.<eos> How about we play this like Chicago?<eos> Could work.<eos> What the hell did you do that for?
Got it.<eos> Lindsay was last seen talking to the lead scumbag.<eos> The founder, Carver Cruz.<eos> So he was interrogated?<eos> Yep, but his lawyer did all the talking.
Get out here, you coward!<eos> It's okay.<eos> I got this.<eos> - I know him.<eos> - No, you don't.
Detective Douche?<eos> If you desire something, just take it.<eos> Lucifer, what are you doing?<eos> Hello.<eos> You finally did it, Nick.
Are you okay?<eos> I'm fine.<eos> Why?<eos> Oh, Nick told you what happened, didn't he?<eos> He did.
Don't mind my brother.<eos> He's just a bit... simple.<eos> We meant no disrespect, truly.<eos> I thought you told me you wanted your wings back.<eos> I do.
Oh, my God, that's... that's terrible.<eos> So why didn't you call the police right away?<eos> Well, I told Lucifer.<eos> He said... he said that he would call the police.<eos> And I did.
Not that I can tell, but maybe I missed something.<eos> What?<eos> The cheater therapist turned out to be terrible at cheating.<eos> Why didn't he tell Dr. Medina he was using him as a cover story?<eos> Maybe he did.
Are you sure?<eos> Very much so.<eos> Very well.<eos> If, uh... if you think it's best.<eos> I do.
I know you, Danny Boy.<eos> You forget, this ain't the first time we've been partners.<eos> I looked the other way a few times.<eos> - That didn't make us partners.<eos> - Sure, it did.
Uh, I was here.<eos> Taking confessions.<eos> Mrs. Madison had a lot to say, took up the whole hour.<eos> By chance, does Mrs. Madison have a limo driver?<eos> She does.
Maybe he's trying to convince Connor to turn himself in.<eos> No. He's probably trying to hide the little miscreant.<eos> Put his faith in God, not the police.<eos> Why do you care about a priest?<eos> I don't.
A few bad apples shouldn't paint us all in a bad light, now should it, ma'am?<eos> But it does paint you as suspects.<eos> Hey, look, just because we have a reputation as outlaws doesn't mean we had anything to do with a murder.<eos> You like being considered a criminal, don't you?<eos> Yeah, you do.
Would make anyone mad with rage.<eos> She made everything about her.<eos> So you could just murder her!<eos> Sure.<eos> But I didn't.
Sorry.<eos> The preacher.<eos> Preacher's wearing a cuff link.<eos> So what?<eos> A lot of guys do.
I'm not evil.<eos> I punish evil.<eos> - Yeah, but, but you're, you know... - The Devil, yes.<eos> And you think you know who that is, don't you?<eos> The whole world does.
Don't shoot him. He's unarmed.<eos> Oh, you don't know that.<eos> Maybe I have a gun.<eos> Hands in the air!<eos> Do it!
- Yes, ma'am.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> Lucifer's prints are gonna be on that gun.<eos> - You don't know that.<eos> - I do.
Why do I feel like I'm walking death row?<eos> Should I order my final meal now to save time?<eos> Dan says he has it handled.<eos> You do, right?<eos> I do.
Is killing Detective Decker really what you want to do with it?<eos> I don't.<eos> No, of course you don't.<eos> You want to live, don't you?<eos> I do.
You're not gonna be alone either.<eos> Thank you,<eos> Kara.<eos> She didn't deserve what happened to her.<eos> No, she did not.
J'onn.<eos> I should have known... (SIGHS) This isn't your fault.<eos> (SIGHS)<eos> If I hadn't pushed you to use your powers, none of this would have happened.<eos> But it did.
(SIGHS HEAVILY)<eos> - J'onn, look at me. - (SHUDDERING)<eos> There's no shame in surviving.<eos> If your family would have lived, you wouldn't want them to be ashamed.<eos> But they didn't.
We fight.<eos> Kara, I'm tired of being the last.<eos> Tired of having lived.<eos> You, of all people, know how heavy it is to survive.<eos> I do.
- Where the hell were you?<eos> - Fuck's it to you?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I made a huge mistake.<eos> - We all did.
Straight down the line, Sidney.<eos> Straight as an arrow.<eos> How does a man die alone in a locked cell?<eos> You believe me, don't you?<eos> Of course I do.
No way on God's green earth.<eos> I will not be in a room with that boy until he apologises properly.<eos> It doesn't seem fair, really.<eos> She's always saying things that upset me.<eos> Of course she does.
(SIGHS) Why Cambridge?<eos> Does my husband have to know?<eos> As long as we agree it won't become a regular occurrence, not in my city at least,<eos> I think we can draw a line under it.<eos> Does Sidney?
Emile gets out two weeks ago, and the gun comes back.<eos> - Where is he? Unfortunately, Steph, our list of Emile's known associates is over 12 years old.<eos> Unless you can recall something.<eos> Hey. Maybe we drag up all this old crap, and we don't find the shooter.<eos> Or maybe we do.
And they both have airtight... what more do you need?<eos> Do you think Price is just suddenly gonna break down and name the third man?<eos> You don't even know if there was a third guy in that car.<eos> Yes, I do know.<eos> I do!
Mark was in love with her.<eos> Thought about Rachel night and day.<eos> Obsessed.<eos> He told you that?<eos> No, she did before the Price trial.
What?<eos> Do you believe them?<eos> Your patients.<eos> Just between you and me.<eos> - Yes, I do. - Hmm.
- Hm-mmm.<eos> But I know the feeling.<eos> I hate speaking in public.<eos> Just don't forget to breathe, 'cause I actually... I threw up last night before the concert.<eos> You did?
Nothing is.<eos> Jude.<eos> I'm sorry, okay?<eos> I want to stay.<eos> Really, I do.
Yes, this is she.<eos> I'm sorry, Dr. who's office?<eos> I don't understand.<eos> I never sent my mammogram over to a Dr. Kopak.<eos> Actually, you did.
Okay, thank you very much.<eos> Yes.<eos> You had the radiologist send my film over to another doctor, Mom, for a second second opinion?<eos> Really?<eos> Maybe I did.
If you don't press charges...<eos> I can't stop this from happening.<eos> Understand?<eos> You don't even know.<eos> - Oh I don't? - Nu-uh.
Long time, no see, right?<eos> Man, I had to ask Teresa for your number, and...<eos> Hold on, man.<eos> You do-you do remember me, right?<eos> Yeah, I do.
He is coming to kill us.<eos> You have got to give me back my power!<eos> I've got to save you!<eos> - Do you remember that night?<eos> - Your father does.
- What's this?<eos> - Cannabis oil.<eos> High in antioxidants, being used to suppress cancers, among many other things.<eos> I take a drop under my tongue every morning.<eos> - Do you?
Yeah?<eos> Do you know how to sync this to your phone?<eos> Um... probably not.<eos> Doesn't your dad work at Best Buy?<eos> Oh, yeah, he does.
Doesn't your dad work at Best Buy?<eos> Oh, yeah, he does.<eos> Just in marketing.<eos> So you don't get any free stuff?<eos> I do, but mostly office supplies.
- Isn't that funny?<eos> - This is so funny.<eos> Where'd you find that?<eos> Well, I had someone make it for you.<eos> You did?
Hmm?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes.<eos> You said yes.<eos> I did.
I need to call you back.<eos> Principal Dwight?<eos> What are you still doing here?<eos> I did it.<eos> You did what?
If we keep cramming standard tests down our kids' throat, we're gonna end up with a bunch of standard children.<eos> I don't know what stinks more, your attitude or my suit.<eos> And that's really saying something, because my suit is covered in poop.<eos> Nobody cares what you think anyway.<eos> I do.
I don't know what stinks more, your attitude or my suit.<eos> And that's really saying something, because my suit is covered in poop.<eos> Nobody cares what you think anyway.<eos> I do.<eos> She does.
Luilichang.<eos> Luilichang.<eos> It's a flea market.<eos> - You know where it is?<eos> - I do.
Can I keep it?<eos> A souvenir?<eos> Don't worry; I'll buy you a drink.<eos> We don't want a Luftwaffe getting a bad name, do we?<eos> No, we don't.
Missus.<eos> And I'd like to clarify this point now, Dr. Fahy, if I may.<eos> You said "physical response," but the correct term is "physiological response," is it not?<eos> Sure, if you want to be technical.<eos> I do.
That's not faith.<eos> That's science.<eos> That's what parachutes do.<eos> They open.<eos> Not all the time, they don't.
He was Jesus' earthly father.<eos> He, uh, dreamed a lot, and, well, in those dreams, he was visited by angels.<eos> And, uh, one day, an angel appeared to him and told him that he must take the Virgin Mary as his wife.<eos> Does everyone understand what--<eos> They do not.
I was hoping you'd crack it for me.<eos> You want my help? Seriously?<eos> Look, I know you think I betrayed you...<eos> You did betray us!<eos> Okay, maybe I did.
Boom!<eos> Ha-ha!<eos> You manage to crack the file?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, I did.
Get your bag.<eos> - Could I speak with him, please?<eos> - It's Haylie Grimes calling.<eos> I got an inklin' that you know where them traitors is hiding' at, don't you?<eos> I don't.
Now you're the one lying to me.<eos> - Well, he's gone now. - That's all that matters, right?<eos> Gone how?<eos> Your fa thinks you've killed him.<eos> So did I.
- Let's move out.<eos> Thought I might find you here.<eos> You taught me how to fish in this creek when we were kids.<eos> - You remember that?<eos> - Mm, 'course I do.
You know why?<eos> Because I love you.<eos> I do.<eos> I love you.<eos> Always did.
Get some sunshine.<eos> -Dude.<eos> -Come on.<eos> You know what I mean.<eos> Yeah, I do.
-No, I don't know any...<eos> -I know this.<eos> -Yes!<eos> Me, too.<eos> -You do?
The Master cannot love.<eos> So he takes it from others, feeds upon it, along with their blood.<eos> I don't know if you can feel love, Quintus.<eos> But I can.<eos> And I do.
You wouldn't have wanted me to do that.<eos> So what can I do for you?<eos> - I want to come work for you.<eos> - Work for me?<eos> - Doing what?
The signal paralyzed their communication systems when it paralyzed them.<eos> They just went off his grid.<eos> You want to seal him in this, the device can help you do that.<eos> It worked on strigoi, but do you think it could also incapacitate the Master?<eos> I do.
Elizalde, you and the big guy, you go first.<eos> Why don't you go first?<eos> You got the guns.<eos> That's right.<eos> We do.
Put the gun down!<eos> Put the gun down!<eos> - Let go of her, piece of shit!<eos> - You don't got a clear shot,<eos> - bitch! - I do.
What did you do last night?<eos> I went to work-- the club.<eos> Did you have a nice night with Agent Knox?<eos> I didn't see him last night.<eos> Well, I did.
- Good.<eos> OK, so I've been back to the hotel, talking to staff, and a few people who spoke to Mr Green yesterday said that he was a really nice guy, friendly, typical holiday-maker, but I do have one lead.<eos> - You have?<eos> - Yes, I spoke to a receptionist and she says she organised a taxi for Mr Green at about 4pm.<eos> She did?
What stories would these be?<eos> Well, I had no idea you had a family nickname.<eos> I... I don't.<eos> Oh, come on, Humphrey, you remember.<eos> I don't!
I can confirm that a Marcus Knight took out a safety deposit box with us in February of 2010.<eos> Six years ago?<eos> Yes, and three days ago, he presented himself and his key to the branch, emptied his box, closed down the account, and handed back his key.<eos> Do you know what he'd been keeping here in those six years?<eos> I don't.
Marcus was your one-time company secretary.<eos> looked after the key to his safe deposit box for the last six years.<eos> This is not the behaviour of someone who has hate in his heart.<eos> - You didn't kill him.<eos> - Too damn right I didn't.
Yes, it would certainly look that way...<eos> Whoa!<eos> You did say I don't have to avoid them.<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, I did.
Is it true?<eos> Yes, Your Highness.<eos> And?<eos> Does Count Odo talk freely of his ambitions?<eos> Yes, he does.
- By whom?<eos> - By the King.<eos> He has made himself King of Mercia, at my expense.<eos> And now I am nothing.<eos> Ecbert did this to you?
Mr. Graff, I want to assure you none of this was approved by the Bureau.<eos> Just talk to my lawyers. Okay, honey?<eos> Stand down.<eos> Did your C.I. know that warrant was fake?<eos> No, ma'am, he didn't.
Just talk to my lawyers. Okay, honey?<eos> Stand down.<eos> Did your C.I. know that warrant was fake?<eos> No, ma'am, he didn't.<eos> None of the agents did, just me.
Only time he ever asked for my help with a case.<eos> And when he asked for your help, what did you do?<eos> Those are my granddad's old boxes, and my dad's case files are over here.<eos> Does my dad know you're here?<eos> No, he doesn't.
Dad, just go through it with me.<eos> See if I missed something.<eos> These parents came to me.<eos> They said their son was better than this, and I believed them, Dad.<eos> - I did.
Yes ma'am, I think we do.<eos> Kevin Whitfield's parents came to us.<eos> Said his death wasn't an O.D.<eos> If I'd have stopped it then...<eos> No, the Bureau didn't.
Emile Sayles, enters her life and takes control not just of her piano but nearly everything she does.<eos> He pushed her until she broke.<eos> And you think she's still under his influence?<eos> Yes, ma'am.<eos> I do.
I overheard you and Mary back at Peng's.<eos> I know about the tank.<eos> Mary's got a plan to fix it.<eos> Didn't sound like that was gonna happen.<eos> No, it didn't.
What do you want?<eos> Oh, uh... I'll take a cutter.<eos> Cutter?<eos> Don't know what that is.<eos> Sure you do.
Why?<eos> I expected that call every day for 15 years.<eos> Because the Jimmy Pritchard I knew was no quitter.<eos> So I asked Mary if I could use her company to help find out what really happened.<eos> And you did.
Mr. Pritchard, Mary is waiting for her transfusion on the second floor.<eos> You know, if this works, then we try it on others.<eos> You know how many lives you could possibly save?<eos> Must make my blood pretty valuable.<eos> It does.
There was a riot.<eos> Three cons escaped.<eos> Cops caught one, but there are two murderers out there in Seattle.<eos> I did the math, and I know what was happening right before those lights went out.<eos> Well, so do I.
I-I said, "Why would I do that?"<eos> He said 'cause they've already deposited money in my account.<eos> He says it looks like I'm being paid for something, so I might as well go ahead and go along with it.<eos> - And if you said no?<eos> - I did.
Alexa, there should be 14 new products at the new production presentation, but I only see 13 new products on this list.<eos> Why was this one removed?<eos> Mary said she needed it.<eos> Did she say for what?<eos> No, Otto, she didn't.
You were 50 years on the job.<eos> Yeah, about that.<eos> You ever see anything like this?<eos> No, Son.<eos> Pretty sure I never did.
You're working this case and you won't ask for help.<eos> It's like you're punishing me for being cured.<eos> I thought we were good out there together, and you did, too.<eos> The two of us.<eos> I did.
They're mounting up.<eos> I knew you wouldn't wait for backup.<eos> You want to wait?<eos> No.<eos> I don't.
Don't you dare be sorry, Sabine.<eos> I feel the same way.<eos> You know, the truth is, I work with men all day and right now, I cannot believe how nice it is to be talking to a woman.<eos> - I thought I told you to go away.<eos> - You did.
Get the DJ booth moved to the center of the dance floor or I can't perform here.<eos> The legendary DJ Taj. It's great to meet you, man.<eos> We're so excited for you to join us.<eos> He doesn't shake hands.<eos> - I really don't.
I don't know. I thought maybe you could teach me how to move the money around.<eos> Then I could do it.<eos> How did you set this all up?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Tasha did all that for me.
Okay.<eos> You ready?<eos> Yeah, give it to me.<eos> Come on.<eos> We did it!
His manners, his speech, his drinking...<eos> - He needs a drug and alcohol program?<eos> - No.<eos> He used to drink a lot.<eos> And now he doesn't.
And the weird thing is, what's ironic is the real Frida Kahlo, she hurt her leg and it impacted her entire life.<eos> Huh. That is ironic.<eos> I don't think I knew that.<eos> You know, maybe I did.<eos> Yes, I did.
What lengths haven't you gone to for me?<eos> I know you.<eos> I have a basis to make that call.<eos> - Kate was my wife, and I knew her.<eos> - Maybe you didn't.
A woman I dated, Tina Sawyer, showed up at my loft last night.<eos> - And I might have seen her at work.<eos> - Is this the woman Cornell interviewed?<eos> - Dad tell you?<eos> - After the cops did.
We saw each other for a couple of months.<eos> Then things got weird.<eos> And you didn't see the red flags?<eos> She always had an explanation.<eos> Yeah, the Cray-crays always do.
I shouldn't be nervous about a little speech.<eos> Yes, there is that.<eos> There's also something else.<eos> You love me?<eos> I do.
Where's Liam?<eos> Who?<eos> Liam Connors... Brown hair, about this tall.<eos> Sorry. I don't know any Liam.<eos> Sure, you do.
You know?<eos> And I think... yeah... it would just fit through.<eos> Ooh. Do we have a match on your dating app?<eos> Actually, yes.<eos> Yes, we do.
Set up a meet.<eos> I need her to sign some paperwork.<eos> Hey, how did things go with Tariq the other night?<eos> He didn't show.<eos> Ghost did.
Families are supposed to stay together, not break up.<eos> But if I do know one thing about your old man, Tariq, he loves the crap out of you.<eos> And no matter what happens, your Uncle Tommy always got your back.<eos> Forever.<eos> The fuck you gonna do with a baby?
'Keisha, it's our shop.<eos> And it ain't exactly on the Upper East Side.<eos> I was protecting us.<eos> You know how to use that?<eos> Yeah, I do.
- Mom, here.<eos> Danny, if you can hear me, I'm here with our son.<eos> Tell him... Tell him Frankie almost rolled over yesterday.<eos> Okay, he didn't almost roll over yesterday.<eos> Yes, he did.
Okay.<eos> All right, bye.<eos> You need me to break you out of here?<eos> I can totally do it, I mean, I've studied how to do it.<eos> No, I-I don't.
Yeah?<eos> Rebecca Hamilton. Um...<eos> I work for the bank.<eos> Oh, how do you know me?<eos> I don't.
All things considered?<eos> You think so?<eos> You think it's all gonna be okay?<eos> Kind of.<eos> Yeah, I do.
I actually believed it.<eos> Hmm, so did I.<eos> I just...<eos> I wanted so bad to believe that there was someone out there who loved me.<eos> And now someone actually does.
Scott Evans, your new editor.<eos> - Oh, Iris...<eos> - West, I know.<eos> You wrote the story about the recent Geomancer attack.<eos> - Yeah, I did.
It is the Lord's power. Oh!<eos> Then why'd the Lord give it to him?<eos> He doesn't even believe!<eos> - It is not my will to question God.<eos> - But you do.
Come on.<eos> I'll drop off Liam.<eos> We'll just go up and look at the bedrooms.<eos> I get the biggest one.<eos> No way, I do!
Well, you would need a parent to co-sign.<eos> Even then I'm afraid that you would never make board approval.<eos> What, black folk money ain't no good here?<eos> I don't follow.<eos> Nah, you don't.
Stop what?<eos> Quit trying to create the perfect father-son moment.<eos> He's never gonna change.<eos> You don't know that.<eos> Yes, I do.
LEAVE ME ALONE. OH.<eos> WE GOT THIS, GIRLS.<eos> MARCH IT OUT.<eos> WELL, FOR WHATEVER IT'S WORTH, DAD, I DIDN'T NOTICE.<eos> GLORIA DID.
Carlos is the one person that knows that you did not do anything wrong.<eos> Where the fuck are we gonna find him?<eos> You said the DEA doesn't know where he is.<eos> The DEA doesn't know where he is.<eos> But I do.
He just needs to talk to my brother.<eos> About what?<eos> You know, my family's helped Carlos a lot, and now we need him to help us, so if you could just tell him to contact my brother.<eos> I don't even know if I'll hear from him again.<eos> - But if you do?
This is Major Alex Carnahan, Zone 6.<eos> He'll be running point.<eos> Well, then maybe he ought to get on it before some kid from the Middle East gives us all the plague.<eos> Zone 6 will get it done, Billy.<eos> We always do, just like last week's game against you fine fellas from Zone Two.
Food drop failed, so they're bringing in the big guns before they try another one.<eos> But it failed because of her.<eos> I mean, she rushed the timeline.<eos> You really think that matters?<eos> You really do.
From my hacker friend.<eos> A biohazard package was delivered to Burns from the CDC two days before the outbreak.<eos> - From the CDC?<eos> - Yes. You actually think they sent Burns the virus?<eos> Of course I do.
- Open up!<eos> - Today...<eos> We're getting out!<eos> Your job was to find a spot where they would not see us taking the child.<eos> And they didn't!
Anyway, picnic?<eos> Absolutely.<eos> You look nice.<eos> - You like my picnic shoes?<eos> - Oh, wow, I do.
That one's 65 seconds, which is good.<eos> When contractions are longer than a minute, it means you're getting close.<eos> Okay.<eos> How do you know that?<eos> Uh, I-I don't.
- Yes.<eos> - Right now?<eos> - Yes!<eos> - Just tell me they train cops to...<eos> - Yes, they do.
Still a terrible outcome, but a shorter one.<eos> You're saying it could make death worse.<eos> Significantly.<eos> Or it could save her.<eos> Do it.
I'm not mad at you, Thomas.<eos> Not even a little bit.<eos> No one is, not even Quentin.<eos> I didn't mean to make Mary sick.<eos> Of course you didn't.
Another one?<eos> There's no way we're gonna get through here.<eos> We're going this way.<eos> You have no idea what you're doing, do you?<eos> Yeah, I do.
You said I should start a life here, right?<eos> And Zoom's over there, and we're over here, so there's nothing to worry about.<eos> There's always something to worry about.<eos> Okay, well, you said Barry and them are good people and I should get to know them.<eos> - I did.
Oh, my God.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> No worries.<eos> Um, I'm gonna go make the kids pancakes.<eos> Yesterday we did chocolate chip.
You'll be hunted like dogs.<eos> Yeah, it's risky.<eos> But the truth is, we don't know how long we have left.<eos> Eric didn't know.<eos> None of us do.
I can help.<eos> What do you know about guns?<eos> You aim and squeeze and your target dies.<eos> How do I know I can I trust you?<eos> You don't yet.
This was a mistake.<eos> I shouldn't have told you.<eos> No, no.<eos> Sabine, I know what it feels like.<eos> I do.
but, um... he got sick.<eos> He got weak.<eos> So weak that there was nothing left of him.<eos> And he begged me... to help him.<eos> And so I did.
No.<eos> But I am gentle.<eos> So from this one gentle man to you four gentlemen, can we guarantee that upon receipt of the desired information, you're not going to toss me into the street?<eos> You sold them?<eos> Of course you did.
Pauline and St Pierre will be destroyed by it.<eos> I have to protect him.<eos> Pauline means more to me than you could possibly imagine.<eos> I will protect her.<eos> Then do so.
- Double your money.<eos> Surely if he could accomplish that, ma'am.<eos> Don't trust him, every breath is a lie.<eos> He must have the money he made from the sales.<eos> Yes, yes, I do!
Just keep moving.<eos> I'll think of something.<eos> Regent Treville.<eos> I knew my brother would finally pardon me.<eos> He didn't.
Treville's plan has worked.<eos> Gaston believes your son has been taken out of Paris to safety.<eos> Where is he truly?<eos> Please tell me you know.<eos> I don't...
Then we could try one more time to reach an agreement.<eos> I should have told you everything from the start.<eos> No.<eos> I wasn't thinking straight, I might've put the boy in danger.<eos> But you didn't.
The midwife betrayed you.<eos> What made you so cruel?<eos> Why would you bring a child into this world?<eos> Don't you know?<eos> Oh, you don't, do you?
Others could live, and no one will know who or what will be affected, but I promise you, when you come back, things will be different.<eos> And only you will know what those differences are.<eos> Well, if that's what I have to do to stop Zoom, then so be it, because if I don't, and Zoom gets my speed before I learn how to stop him, everybody I care about, everybody in this whole city... their world will never be the same anyway.<eos> Um... Do you really think you can do this?<eos> Yeah, I do.
That's about as good a first step as any.<eos> - I got some parts for it.<eos> - Let's go for it.<eos> You don't know how to stop - a Time Wraith?<eos> - None of us do.
I mean, I don't even know what "like me" means anymore.<eos> Well, having an affair a month before your wedding seems like a really weird way to figure it out.<eos> It's not an affair.<eos> I've been with. - Do you not want to get married?<eos> - Of course I do.
And, actually, she was... She was judging me.<eos> She was the judgy one.<eos> Apparently, she's weirded out that I'm marrying Harry because Harry was married to my sister, but you guys don't think it's weird, right?<eos> Oh, God.<eos> Do you?
I was standing there and I'm watching all my frustrations come flooding out on this poor guy and his bike.<eos> I could have killed him, Karen.<eos> Take a big sip.<eos> - Now.<eos> Do it.
No, no, no, no, no.<eos> I mean, how do you want to do this?<eos> You girls live together, right?<eos> Would be easier to just go to your place and do it there?<eos> Do what where?
So, what do you think?<eos> I love it all.<eos> Oh, I am so glad.<eos> So, why does it look like you actually don't love it?<eos> I really do.
Yeah, I was, okay?<eos> But then those texts just popped up, and they were not even the worst ones.<eos> Yeah, but you still sent them to Gawker.<eos> Well, Stacey deserves to know the truth.<eos> Yeah, she does now.
But then those texts just popped up, and they were not even the worst ones.<eos> Yeah, but you still sent them to Gawker.<eos> Well, Stacey deserves to know the truth.<eos> Yeah, she does now.<eos> So does Troy Baker.
- for all the world to see.<eos> - So this is about my book?<eos> This is about you... living in a morally questionable universe that isn't appropriate to raise a child in.<eos> But yes... I found your book exploitive and disturbing.<eos> Faith and I both did.
We're gonna have more children.<eos> Faith's not Vivian's mother.<eos> Maybe not.<eos> But I am Vivian's father, and she is my wife, and she knows the proper way to care for and raise a child.<eos> And I don't?
Well?<eos> No.<eos> Um... not well.<eos> You know, Harry, I-I tried.<eos> Really, I did.
He didn't do anything.<eos> Yeah, I know, but it's his nephew.<eos> You know, I really don't want to give up everything I've been working toward and start from scratch, but then I feel like I'm being selfish for even thinking that way.<eos> I like Joss.<eos> I really do.
- No, you just...<eos> You can't go in there over prepared, especially not with a guy like Jason Hughes.<eos> - He's super off the cuff.<eos> - You know who Jason Hughes is?<eos> Of course I do.
- It wasn't entirely your fault.<eos> - It wasn't my fault at all.<eos> He is a pompous blowhard who didn't let me get a word in edgewise.<eos> And he had the audacity to ask me to come back, if you can believe it.<eos> - He did?
Not when your first book was only somewhat successful.<eos> I can't afford to take another year off to write something on spec, and I don't know how to get another deal without an agent.<eos> Maybe I should give up.<eos> Maybe I don't have another book in me.<eos> Of course you do.
So what does that make you, then?<eos> The rebound?<eos> You don't know anything about our relationship.<eos> Yeah, you're right.<eos> I don't.
So, what else should we talk about?<eos> Stop it.<eos> I know what you're doing.<eos> I know I said I don't want to talk about the book pages, but I lied.<eos> I do.
I love your brother.<eos> Do you remember?<eos> You remember him?<eos> The guy that you wouldn't tell about the whole secret relationship in the first place?<eos> Lucky for you I didn't.
Go, go, go.<eos> Can I just say I'm glad you called?<eos> I didn't think you were going to.<eos> To be honest, I wasn't sure either.<eos> Why did you?
We're organizing.<eos> - I take it you haven't told him yet.<eos> - Not yet.<eos> He was supposed to go on his tour two days ago, but he postponed.<eos> - Mm-hmm. - ‭I'll do it.
Actually I am.<eos> Trying to get ready for the big opening and all that.<eos> - Right.<eos> - Thought I said I'd call you if I...<eos> Yeah, no, you did.
And the truth is, it was obviously the right thing because now I have a baby, a book, and a new practice.<eos> I don't know how serious you are, but you're never gonna be 100% sure.<eos> That's what I'm afraid of.<eos> Well, sometimes you just have to close your eyes, jump, and trust the net will appear.<eos> Hmm. And if it doesn't?
Even if that were true, which it's not, how would you know?<eos> Are you speaking to Scott a lot these days?<eos> Did he tell you himself?<eos> No.<eos> Joss did.
You all knew him.<eos> You worked for him.<eos> And when he got drunk, he was a totally different person.<eos> One time, I thought he was gonna kill me.<eos> But he didn't.
Completing The Circle".<eos> The Circle?<eos> That's what Shannon and Ben were talking about.<eos> Do you know what it is?<eos> No, I don't.
Good for you.<eos> He's hot, girl.<eos> Give me five.<eos> I met him doing shots at this dive bar and he dared me 20 bucks to go next door and get a tattoo.<eos> But you didn't. Oh, yeah.
Sorry.<eos> - Evelyn.<eos> - It's all right.<eos> I know what "We need to talk" means.<eos> - You do?
She doesn't have a clue.<eos> And she doesn't know anything about The Circle?<eos> The Circle?<eos> Do you know what it is?<eos> No, I don't.
Let me try something.<eos> Listen to the sound of my voice.<eos> You love prison.<eos> You want to go back to prison.<eos> No, I don't.
What are you talking about?<eos> Forget him.<eos> Once they're talking business, you're on your own.<eos> So, Marisol, you wrote a book?<eos> I did, yeah.
I haven't seen him in 20 years.<eos> But it's the first man I ever loved.<eos> Probably the only man.<eos> I understand how you feel.<eos> You do?
Is she crying?<eos> This could be it.<eos> I was terrified that Spence would find out the baby wasn't his.<eos> I knew I had to come forward about the rape, so I called Hugh and I told him I was turning him in.<eos> But you never did?
Oh, I knew her.<eos> And so did my husband... Spence Westmore.<eos> - The man who killed her?<eos> - Oh, he didn't kill her.<eos> You did.
Spence is innocent.<eos> He still broke out of prison.<eos> But Kill Face forced you to escape.<eos> Isn't that right?<eos> Yes, yes, he did.
Would you take 60/40 maybe?<eos> - Not now, Cooler.<eos> - Cooler, shut the fuck up.<eos> I didn't know that you felt that way.<eos> Yeah, well, I do.
That cost three bucks, Chip.<eos> Is that the watermelon that was in your fridge?<eos> - Yeah, and it's gone!<eos> - Yeah... because you ate it.<eos> - No, I didn't.
Yeah.<eos> You know what?<eos> It could've been worse.<eos> Good thing you remembered who he was.<eos> I didn't.
- So, you talk to your guy?<eos> - Uh, which guy?<eos> About the store.<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> I just did, as a matter of fact.
I get it.<eos> No.<eos> I get it.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - No, I do.
- And then this?<eos> - Was this part of the plan?<eos> - No.<eos> This just happened.<eos> No, it didn't.
I... I've... No, I've never done that.<eos> People love a good roped ass.<eos> - Hmm. - A well-roped ass.<eos> Yeah.<eos> My ex-wife sure did. Oh.
Hell, you ain't normal.<eos> If you was normal, you wouldn't be sitting out here in the middle of the dirt.<eos> Thanks, Eddie.<eos> I think he means that as an insult, right?<eos> No, I did not.
- Okay.<eos> Fine.<eos> No!<eos> You can't hit the ball, man.<eos> - I didn't.
Are his vitals okay?<eos> Yeah, they're perfect. Cool.<eos> It's like having a pit-stop attached to your chest.<eos> Guys, I can go faster.<eos> Do it.
Then we do another snatch and grab mission.<eos> By the time we scale those cliffs, Zoom could already...<eos> I need a minute!<eos> Barry, I know you... can't give up your speed to that monster, but... I also know that I want to get my son back, and I don't know what to do.<eos> I do.
I'll see you later.<eos> Did you call ahead and let 'em know we're coming?<eos> "Hi, this is Reverend Anderson,<eos> I'm just calling to see if you're still 100 percent demon-free."<eos> No, I did not.
Amen.<eos> I'll come by tomorrow.<eos> You really think that's gonna make any difference?<eos> Prayer?<eos> Yes, I do.
This is what I'm talking about!<eos> His sign!<eos> For he walks amongst us.<eos> Right here, right now!<eos> The same way that he did at that mine.
- You lost that on your own.<eos> - Oh, Jesus, come on.<eos> Did it feel good, Mark?<eos> Doing what you did to him?<eos> Yeah, fuck yeah, it did.
For him to know that I've beat the count.<eos> Round two.<eos> You really think he's the devil?<eos> You saw what he did to me.<eos> Yeah, I did.
Allison. Hey, baby.<eos> There's so many things I need to tell you.<eos> Things I should have told you a long time ago.<eos> And I wanted to.<eos> The other night on the porch, I did.
But doesn't matter now.<eos> I'm not gonna stick around much longer.<eos> Wait, I...<eos> I thought you said your powers don't work inside this cell?<eos> They don't.
And then all of a sudden, those cars came at us.<eos> And it was like the world froze.<eos> Like... you and I were the only two people in the world.<eos> I didn't even know what I could do yet, but I knew that I could save you.<eos> And I did.
Suit or no suit... that guy is a hero.<eos> That's everything you asked for.<eos> How do you sleep at night?<eos> Knowing you've destroyed so many people's lives?<eos> I don't.
Okay.<eos> Wally West.<eos> I'll see you at home.<eos> You wanted to see me.<eos> Yes. I did.
Wes, this is good.<eos> It means she's gonna be okay.<eos> Wes, it's all working.<eos> - You don't know that.<eos> - I do.
I can't trust you to do anything.<eos> What do you want?<eos> I don't know what this means.<eos> I'm not your mother.<eos> I don't...
Nate, I'm sorry.<eos> Sorry.<eos> I just...<eos> You know me.<eos> You do.
Injuries like Ms. Sinclair's are consistent with a fall, but there are other points of impact in the evidence which lead me to conclude that the body was struck prior to the fall.<eos> Perhaps if the defendant previously attacked her with an object... - Did you call her?<eos> - Hell no.<eos> The judge just threw out your statement.<eos> What do we do?
Ms. Keating, aren't you lying?<eos> I don't know.<eos> You don't know?<eos> Then how can we trust anything that you think you saw or heard that night, including your claim that Catherine Hapstall shot you?<eos> She didn't.
Five years, minimum security if she testifies against Philip.<eos> Okay. Please, Annalise...<eos> No.<eos> It's not your job to worry about me.<eos> Yeah, I do, though.
Jason lied to you.<eos> He stood there over your son while he bled out.<eos> Hate won't win.<eos> Don't you get that?<eos> Well, it just did.
What does that mean?<eos> Wes shot Annalise, not me.<eos> She told him Rebecca was dead, so he shot her in the stomach because he wanted her dead.<eos> And... I don't blame him.<eos> But somehow she does.
- Who did?<eos> - My foster family.<eos> They thought it'd help me acclimate.<eos> And you believed that?<eos> No, of course you did.
I love you.<eos> Just tell me.<eos> Did he do it?<eos> Kill Mom and Dad?<eos> Maybe I did it myself.
Because you want me to ignore what you did.<eos> That's not what I'm asking for.<eos> Then why are we down here?<eos> To find out if I told Annalise?<eos> Well, I didn't.
- She's thinking about it.<eos> She'll say yes.<eos> My point is I might have to go to church so I can atone for my sins.<eos> Mm. You have to believe in God for that.<eos> Or maybe you do now.
So, you want to change your life, or are you happy just to stay Annalise Keating's bitch?<eos> Frank.<eos> Just tell me.<eos> We found her.<eos> Well, Oliver did.
After everything that he's done...<eos> You act like he beat me.<eos> No, the worst thing he did was to move across town.<eos> How do you know he's not gonna leave again?<eos> I don't.
Um...<eos> It was bad morally.<eos> I feel that.<eos> I just don't want you to think that I didn't... enjoy it.<eos> Because I did... uh, thoroughly.
Whoo-hoo-hoo! Y'all better watch out.<eos> She's gonna want to kill me, too.<eos> She won't.<eos> You don't know that.<eos> I do.
Is that what people want?<eos> A piece of you?<eos> Do you play video games?<eos> No.<eos> My kids do.
I'm trying to give you the out.<eos> Please just take the out.<eos> I don't want an out.<eos> - I know who you are.<eos> - No, you don't.
Please just take the out.<eos> I don't want an out.<eos> - I know who you are.<eos> - No, you don't.<eos> Yeah, I do.
- Does it...<eos> Does it matter? Just, um... you promised.<eos> Yeah, I know... to give you space and time.<eos> I just didn't expect you to take so much of it, is all.<eos> Yeah, neither did I.
- Shut the fuck up, would you, Chip?<eos> For once.<eos> Take the gun, put it in your mouth or whatever, and just spare us all the extra words.<eos> George, I appreciate everything you've done for me.<eos> No, you don't.
Where are you taking her?<eos> That was the last time I saw her.<eos> They sent me on assignment that night.<eos> It wasn't till I got to bangkok that I heard rumors about them trying to turn a Hexenbiest into a warrior, but nobody told me if it worked.<eos> It did.
- By herself?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Where is she now?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> - Well, somebody does.
What does this guy want from you?<eos> After all this time?<eos> I don't know.<eos> He thinks we had a relationship.<eos> We didn't.
You mean what she did.<eos> What you did.<eos> You still think you're talking to Juliette.<eos> I don't know who I'm talking to.<eos> Yes, you do.
Look.<eos> I need to talk to you guys about something.<eos> Oh, that kind of talk.<eos> You guys know about Black Claw, right?<eos> We do.
No!<eos> No.<eos> What did you do to my son?<eos> You thought you could give The Flash his speed back?<eos> Well done.
What's this?<eos> Three keys.<eos> Some of what we lost.<eos> We didn't lose it.<eos> You did.
I block the door at night to keep out the murderers.<eos> I know that it's weird, but... it's just one of my things.<eos> It's okay.<eos> I totally get it.<eos> You do?
You got to get this thing out of here now.<eos> Fine, fine.<eos> I'm sorry, man.<eos> Thought you wanted a wild party.<eos> I do.
Fine, fine.<eos> I'm sorry, man.<eos> Thought you wanted a wild party.<eos> I do.<eos> I... do.
Uber guy's going to say, "One stop or two?"<eos> Which is basically like saying, "Your place or mine?"<eos> Except I don't have to say anything.<eos> - Sounds like you got it all figured out.<eos> - Yeah. Yeah, I do.
- Cool.<eos> That's really nice of you, man.<eos> Do you know how that date went, by any chance?<eos> Like, did...<eos> No, I don't...
Sometimes it's good to let go of the past.<eos> Yeah, but does this need to be one of those "sometimes"?<eos> Are you ever going to sign our divorce?<eos> I think it might help untangle you, set you free.<eos> - I did.
- Hey.<eos> - Hey.<eos> Sorry.<eos> I didn't mean to startle you.<eos> No, you didn't.
I don't have anything like...<eos> I don't even have a cell phone.<eos> Can I get you a drink or...?<eos> I thought you didn't drink.<eos> - I don't.
Charteris at least had one foot in the real world.<eos> And was your man, our man, on our side.<eos> Whereas Tommy Lascelles... he's stuck in the land that time forgot.<eos> - You asked to see me, sir.<eos> - I did.
Ask Secretary Durant to meet me in the Oval. Yes, sir.<eos> Mr. President.<eos> Coffee table.<eos> The funny thing is I didn't even have to ask him to do it.<eos> He did it on his own.
And that's not an opportunity people always get before a parent dies, and I'm grateful to have had that.<eos> And what am I doing here?<eos> I'm here because my mother wanted me to be.<eos> Yesterday, before she passed, she said to me,<eos> "Claire... do this.
Then why did she come to him instead of him coming to her?<eos> Look, I'm not gonna get into the weeds on this, but let's just cut to the chase.<eos> The allegations that you're making are just as ludicrous as they were the first time we met.<eos> I had nothing concrete then.<eos> This time I do.
Don't remind me!<eos> When I told you to get close to the Khan, you chose the path.<eos> You chose Byamba, not me.<eos> And you used it to your advantage.<eos> Of course I did!
Did you know about this?<eos> You're going to make me read it?<eos> It's Byamba's military assignment... as foot soldier.<eos> You removed that from my desk.<eos> -I did.
Sit down, would you, please?<eos> Okay.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Did you think about what I said?<eos> I did.
I was the call you made when you dropped your first body.<eos> You were the first person to know I fuck with girls.<eos> Now we gonna play each other like this?<eos> Candie didn't know what you meant by "Ghost."<eos> I do.
We both have blood on our hands.<eos> Hard to get off.<eos> And yet, you're still here.<eos> Only because you saved me.<eos> I did, didn't I?
I fought for you, Miranda.<eos> You do a lot of things, Liam.<eos> But we both know fighting for me is not one of them.<eos> I messed that up.<eos> Yeah, you did.
Last time we spoke, I know things got a little heated, but I hope I can count on you.<eos> For what?<eos> Well, in the time of crisis, a group needs a leader, and you're that leader.<eos> I didn't ask for that.<eos> Yeah, well, a leader never does.
Yeah, a terrorist.<eos> I did what needed to be done.<eos> Whatever you did clearly isn't the same or we wouldn't be having this talk.<eos> You have no idea what I did.<eos> No, I don't.
I...<eos> I can't let you take the blame for this.<eos> Let... Let me go talk to them.<eos> Maybe I can convince them to go easy on you. I...<eos> They did.
I'm gonna need you to open up the back, too.<eos> I think we need to talk about Caleb.<eos> Caleb stole your money and met with a woman who gave him this.<eos> I think they're related, but I don't know how.<eos> Maybe you do.
But I could spot their tells from my apartment.<eos> A nervous knee, a finger twitch.<eos> Handler didn't blink... just like you.<eos> It's true the world doesn't know where my son is, but neither do you.<eos> Only I do.
When I was 17, I was part of an organization.<eos> - Like a cult?<eos> - My dad rescued me.<eos> My son's a greater danger to himself than you know.<eos> But I do.
What now?<eos> I saw wagons filled with those barrels on a road that doesn't lead to Cambulac.<eos> And you know every road to Cambulac?<eos> It's my home.<eos> Of course I do.
You wanted to be a wrestler, you wrestled!<eos> ...You wanted to be a warrior... you fought!<eos> Yeah, well...<eos> - I didn't want to be the Khan.<eos> Well, I did.
Then, if somebody finds him, they won't be looking for us and that might buy us some time.<eos> That's... actually... a smart idea.<eos> All right.<eos> This is all I could find.<eos> I did the feet.
One!<eos> Do it, do it.<eos> I can't. I can't.<eos> Hey, buddy, look, we don't want to hurt you.<eos> - I do!
Um, I know.<eos> Well, you know, I didn't think he was gonna do it.<eos> But then I was pretty sure that, you know, he was gonna come back.<eos> So I'm-I'm not exactly sure if this, like, affects things m-moving forward. Yes.<eos> Yes, it does.
Maybe that's all part of it.<eos> A whole other conversation happening with your smile.<eos> Do you want to fuck?<eos> I used to not say what I think.<eos> Now I do.
If you are able to tell us who murdered her and we are able to secure a Case on the strength of your information, then I see no reason why we cannot release you.<eos> Joel Kransey.<eos> You know where he might be?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, I do.
Whoa, whoa.<eos> I'm not an actor.<eos> No, come on.<eos> We're all acting all the time.<eos> - Then you do it.
- Oh. - Of course we don't mind.<eos> I'll pay for the utility bill this month.<eos> - Not necessary, Mother.<eos> - Oh, I insist.<eos> Of course you do.
- Yeah, I'm just worried about you.<eos> Is... is Mike really pissed at me?<eos> No, he's just sad, I think.<eos> He misses you.<eos> We all do.
You stay here.<eos> I'll pick you up later.<eos> OK if I take the car?<eos> I don't actually know that many people...<eos> Yes, you do.
Look, we can keep going over this, or we can move on.<eos> I might need to destroy your computer.<eos> You're not destroying my computer.<eos> - Did you send them to anyone else? - No.<eos> Did you?
The problem is...<eos> How can they not know?<eos> They don't pay 'em!<eos> No, they do!<eos> The biscuit factory does.
That might make me happy.<eos> Sure!<eos> Absolutely.<eos> Except I haven't got one.<eos> Oh, you do!
He talked about bringing you milk.<eos> And how he upset you by bringing his friend and how much he wishes he hadn't done that now because that seemed to spoil everything.<eos> Did he...?<eos> Did he say owt about me chucking petrol all over him?<eos> He did.
That were Lewis.<eos> And I had to kill him, cos he come at me with that knife!<eos> I know.<eos> But nobody believes me.<eos> I do.
- What've you got for me?<eos> - I think you'll be pleased.<eos> I didn't, and I told you I wouldn't, do anything illegal.<eos> You're not going to tell me you didn't do owt.<eos> I did do something.
When has doing anything legally got anybody like me anywhere?<eos> Frances, you're going to have to do what I've asked you to do.<eos> Or what I'm thinking is... ..this... ..you and me... ..it's not going to work, I'm sorry.<eos> I thought you understood me.<eos> I really did. I do!
Yeah.<eos> And we already had those photos.<eos> Can we trace the numbers receiving the texts?<eos> Negative.<eos> Or the number doing the texting?
I'm just gonna stay here and wash some mugs.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> We are looking for Ingrid Bower.<eos> I am Ingrid, can I help you?<eos> You just did.
I know she's dead.<eos> I'm asking you if you'd ever hurt them.<eos> I wouldn't.<eos> I don't owe Juliette anything.<eos> But I do.
- Stop!<eos> - Stop!<eos> Stop!<eos> Everybody calm down!<eos> Don't do this!
Verity, I lost my child.<eos> How could I bear it if I lost Ross too?<eos> Ask me, Enys.<eos> Am I cleaning it to put away or do I intend to use it again?<eos> Do you?
You have 30 minutes to answer every question I ask.<eos> And if you lie, I'll know.<eos> Because I've spent the past 10 years of my life studying men and their lies before I kill them.<eos> Do you believe me?<eos> I do.
Maybe something similar happened to her.<eos> And that's how we get her to come to the table.<eos> I pretend to be that kind of client.<eos> How do we know that's gonna work?<eos> We don't.
I, um, I had her tested that morning, and I found out that night...<eos> That she had early onset of dementia.<eos> Most likely Alzheimer's.<eos> Did you test yourself?<eos> No, you didn't.
- No, we need it.<eos> - So does she.<eos> If I had more, I'd give you more.<eos> Yeah.<eos> But you don't.
A rune on the hand, a rune on the heart, a union is born.<eos> What's that warlock doing here?<eos> Izzy...<eos> - did Alec invite Magnus?<eos> - I did.
We're forever linked, you and I.<eos> How do you know I don't want to stake you?<eos> Do you?<eos> No.<eos> I do.
Clary!<eos> Damn it.<eos> I wish my mom had left us something.<eos> Some sort of clue.<eos> Maybe she did.
Agent Mojtabal, stand down. Aram.<eos> Aram, look at me.<eos> Look at me.<eos> I don't blame you for letting me out.<eos> I don't.
'See?<eos> There it is.<eos> 'And, as Celia crosses over, it's gone.<eos> 'Oh, yeah, I never noticed.<eos> - 'No, people don't.
She was pregnant.<eos> She told you?<eos> No.<eos> But when I read about her murder, I-I realized she didn't want to give birth to a new baby till she knew that the one she gave up had everything he needed.<eos> I did.
Yeah.<eos> I wanted to adopt, too.<eos> What?<eos> I-I thought you didn't want kids.<eos> Of course I do.
He wants to shame me.<eos> Disgrace my name.<eos> Would he be justified in his quest?<eos> I want you to know who it is you're protecting.<eos> I do.
Except she found out the truth, confronted you, and that's why you killed her.<eos> I didn't kill Robyn.<eos> I-I didn't even know she found out the truth.<eos> Look, Linda, it's time to come clean.<eos> I just did.
- Is Genji your aunt?<eos> - Oh, hey, Alice.<eos> - Is that Genji?<eos> - Do you guys know her?<eos> Everyone does.
Eh, I feel... decent.<eos> Eh, there was some dizziness, headaches.<eos> That's why I went in.<eos> - Does Mom know?<eos> - No, she does not.
You're late.<eos> I'm what? Who are you?<eos> You always ask the same questions.<eos> I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> You never do.
- You are a fraud.<eos> - Meriwether?<eos> What's she doing here?<eos> She knows about me.<eos> She does.
Isn't that right, Miss?<eos> Miss Honoria?<eos> Huh?<eos> Oh, erm, of course we should.<eos> Yes, please do.
Damn my sister!<eos> Must she constantly be an obstacle to me?<eos> I am a Havisham too.<eos> - That must count for something.<eos> - Yes, it does.
We'd better get you home.<eos> Can you walk?<eos> Of course.<eos> It's passed, I don't know what happened.<eos> Well, I do.
- That's all he knows.<eos> He saw some paperwork regarding it, and when he asked Mr Marley about it, he snapped at him.<eos> Bob would not like to know I told you.<eos> In confidence, I have your word?<eos> Yes, you do.
When I'm on NZT, I can think through all the different - angles, every perspective. - Then shouldn't you have known that I was gonna shoot Casey?<eos> You texted me.<eos> Yeah, I... I didn't think you'd shoot.<eos> Lower your weapon.<eos> But I did.
Yeah.<eos> That'll do.<eos> They need you upstairs right now.<eos> I saw the news.<eos> Of course I did.
art forgery.<eos> You know, Bob Ross always made it look so easy.<eos> Happy trees, happy clouds.<eos> Bob didn't paint psychologically disturbing naked people.<eos> Well, Winton Miller did.
Special Agent Harris.<eos> Mrs. Finch. May I come in?<eos> Thank you for having me over.<eos> I assume if you knew anything about Brian's whereabouts, you would tell us, yes?<eos> I don't.
Uh, no.<eos> Again, that's Madalena.<eos> Isabella is in Hortensia.<eos> I don't think he knows what he's talking about.<eos> No, I do.
The tie.<eos> I was filling in for someone.<eos> It's okay, happens to all of us.<eos> Yeah.<eos> It does.
Apparently, I'm bad for optics.<eos> He suggests I stop talking about frame jobs and faked deaths and take a plea.<eos> So no one else believes that Sofia's alive?<eos> Do you?<eos> Yes. I do.
Dismissed.<eos> This little girl was left in a bag, totally helpless.<eos> No one knows where she came from or who left her there.<eos> - Doesn't that remind you of someone?<eos> - Of course it does.
Honey, this is your health, okay?<eos> I take it he has a pretty full schedule?<eos> Well, our business is day to day so you never know when it's,<eos> - you know, about to get busy.<eos> - I do.
No.<eos> My mom didn't do anything.<eos> You have to tell them that.<eos> How do you know that?<eos> I just... I do.
You better.<eos> Your queen doth love what you do with your scepter, King Frank.<eos> Oh, God.<eos> Your king... is about to blow his load into your moat, my queen.<eos> One thing before you do, my regal stallion.
Basically, yeah.<eos> All right, put out an APB but strictly a find and follow.<eos> Do not engage.<eos> Report contact only. You know how to contact Meisner?<eos> - We do.
What if it's something that used to be important back then, but isn't a very big deal now?<eos> You know? Like eyeglasses.<eos> Eyeglasses?<eos> Did you know the first pair of eyeglasses was invented in the 13th century?<eos> - I did not.
He- he's coming back.<eos> It's fine.<eos> Come here.<eos> Did you touch this?<eos> No, no, I didn't.
They?<eos> How many more are there?<eos> More than we can survive.<eos> Do you see them, master?<eos> I do.
Don't believe it.<eos> I'll never kill myself.<eos> I think I could die right now.<eos> You don't really know me...<eos> Neither do you.
That's unfortunate.<eos> You're in the land of lies.<eos> You're really good at it.<eos> Do I know how to be a real shit?<eos> I do.
Somebody else made you go to that cabin.<eos> Somebody else chopped your hand off...<eos> - Ah, no, I did that.<eos> - Somebody else killed your girl.<eos> No, I did that too.
You got all this... Veronica's family tree, likes and dislikes?<eos> Oh, you got that wrong.<eos> - Where?<eos> - "Doesn't like beef-drizzled nachos."<eos> Uh...yes, she does!
Called him all kinds of names for being white.<eos> James found those boys.<eos> Gave them what they had coming to them.<eos> They never bothered Tommy again.<eos> No one did, as a matter of fact.
I saved both our lives, and you are gonna kick me out?<eos> After everything he said to you, you still care about him?<eos> He sent you to jail!<eos> He took away your business.<eos> Everything he did to me, to us.
- Are you serious?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Look, I drew specs on Superman.<eos> Everyone knows they're the same person.<eos> Well, Lois Lane doesn't.
And the other half saving the world.<eos> - How do you cope?<eos> - How do you cope with a career and a baby?<eos> How do you know I have a baby?<eos> I did my research.
Yes, of course.<eos> - He's downstairs right now.<eos> - I see.<eos> - And, yes, I said "he".<eos> - Yes, you did.
And you are light.<eos> Yeah. OK?<eos> That's what I love about you.<eos> You hear me?<eos> You did.
Seizures. Pain.<eos> Until you go mad. Or die.<eos> You know, if La Llorona is here to rescue Amaru, we're in deep shit.<eos> I doubt we'll survive.<eos> You did once. Didn't you?
Do you wanna die?<eos> Or do you wanna live?<eos> If you prefer the latter, you need to check your shit at the door, and start acting like a real crew.<eos> Now, why in the fuck should we listen to you and your meat-sack brother.<eos> Don't.
We're gonna get you through this, you need to trust me.<eos> Even when you're in the dark.<eos> Even when you're falling.<eos> I trust you, sweetheart.<eos> I do.
Reba, do you remember in third year when you got that really nasty eye infection and I had to read to you?<eos> You were doing that paper on "pride and prejudice:<eos> Gender and role reversal" "in 19th century literature."<eos> How did I even remember that, right?<eos> I do.
And it didn't go off without its hiccups, but, um... I got it done.<eos> No one died.<eos> So you'll talk to Shahir?<eos> You'll book the surgery.<eos> I already did.
Let's go.<eos> I appreciate your condolences, Madam Secretary.<eos> But they won't bring back President Ostrova, nor will they alter the fact that Ukraine abrogated the ceasefire by assassinating her.<eos> President Ostrova wanted peace.<eos> She didn't.
Cheers.<eos> Cheers.<eos> Cheers.<eos> You got to admit, we make a pretty good team.<eos> We do.
You have many questions.<eos> And tell me, which is right question to begin with?<eos> Wrong.<eos> Who are you, and do I know?<eos> Yes, I do, Jamie St. Patrick.
Can you lift up your shirt, please?<eos> Wow.<eos> Must've been quite a fall.<eos> It didn't really hurt, no.<eos> But it does now.
Then that's how long we have to get her away from him.<eos> Keep them here, no matter what.<eos> Okay.<eos> Okay, do you remember before, when I told you that I wanted to die?<eos> I did, for a very, very long time.
She was the one who pulled me back.<eos> I don't think I can go on without her, but...<eos> I mean, the thought of taking away her happiness and holding her back... that's worse than the thought of losing her.<eos> So you don't want me to try and stop her.<eos> I did before.
- It's all been a lie.<eos> - No. You helped so many people because we made them believe in you.<eos> But this is...<eos> You kept saying I had a gift.<eos> You do.
Hopefully, the pilot strike will end soon and I can get my old job back.<eos> Oh, the strike ended a month ago.<eos> What?<eos> ! Why didn't you tell me? !<eos> I did.
Well, God bless the children that had to listen to that.<eos> Well, it's gonna be very interesting, Earl.<eos> I don't think I ever remember you playing sober.<eos> You always said the junk gave you the funk.<eos> - I did?
You did well to get here.<eos> I gather half the Downing Street staff didn't?<eos> It wasn't easy.<eos> Just crossing the road you take your life in your hands.<eos> Well, then don't.
We don't know where he is right now.<eos> Why are you looking for him?<eos> I don't understand...<eos> you arrested Ms. Burnap.<eos> We did.
He has no friends, no life.<eos> You know how to pick 'em.<eos> What, the ones who need help?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I do.
- What's her problem?<eos> - She's in a mood.<eos> I said to tell her that I needed a minute.<eos> - You didn't tell me that.<eos> - Yes, I did.
Like I'm in charge for a sec? Now, uh, Ms. Roberts...<eos> What do you want to know?<eos> Two years ago, I felt a pain in my right tibia.<eos> She's got a real mind for this stuff.<eos> They did labs, P.E.T. scan, the works.
Sweetheart, we should consider this.<eos> Maybe...<eos> I went to three different hospitals before I came here, and they all said the same thing.<eos> They said, "go to Grey-Sloan.<eos> Do to Dr. Karev."
Near here.<eos> Where'd you go to high school?<eos> Jefferson for a while.<eos> What year did you graduate?<eos> I didn't.
How can I help?<eos> You can... take me swimming?<eos> - You look like...<eos> - I just walked here.<eos> Yeah, I did.
And when they come at him to turn on you, I don't want her within 1,000 miles of this place.<eos> I'm sorry, Robert.<eos> I can't do that.<eos> And you know why.<eos> I do...
What I know is, the last time you came to me,<eos> I told you I never wanted to hear Mike Ross's name again, and once again, here you are, asking me to do something for the person that destroyed our relationship.<eos> Scottie, I'm not here to argue with you.<eos> But you still want to know what I'm going to do?<eos> I do.
You almost went to jail for helping them once before, and I couldn't take that.<eos> And the thought of losing you once again...<eos> So you know that they need my help.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I do.
Where's McCarthy?<eos> What a fine and fearsome creature you are.<eos> Magnificent in every way.<eos> You don't know me.<eos> Oh, but I do.
And you didn't hear anything?<eos> I've been... taking a tonic to help me sleep.<eos> Why didn't the poltergeist kill you, too?<eos> I don't... I don't know.<eos> I do.
Are you crazy?<eos> No, I'm smart.<eos> All they have is an anonymous tip and no corroborating evidence.<eos> You sign this affidavit saying that I was in your class, their whole case gets dismissed.<eos> And what if it doesn't?
- Why?<eos> Because Marcus actually knew what the hell he was doing.<eos> You know what, Harvey?<eos> If you don't want to invest, don't invest, but I don't need a lecture from you on what a bad businessman my father is.<eos> Yes, you do.
You better watch yourself.<eos> What the hell are you doing?<eos> It cost her her relationship with me!<eos> You didn't know about that, did you?<eos> Well, now you do.
I'm an attorney. I can't destroy evidence.<eos> But you? You can do whatever you want.<eos> You trust me to do that?<eos> No, Mike.<eos> Jessica does.
No.<eos> Which I can't do today, because I have a meeting with the dean.<eos> Now, I came in here to be alone so I can deal with my shit, so if you don't mind, I would like to be alone so I can deal with my shit.<eos> Hey, did you find something in the discovery?<eos> Yeah, sure as hell did.
I understand you not giving me a second chance then.<eos> But I'm begging you... give my firm one now.<eos> Louis, even if I wanted to, it won't work.<eos> - You don't know that.<eos> - Yes, I do.
Scottie, I didn't tell him to do that.<eos> Well, then, I guess you two are having the same problem we did: You don't talk to each other.<eos> Since you chose him over me it's not my problem anymore.<eos> I didn't chose him over you.<eos> Yes, you did.
Now you have it too.<eos> David Green.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> So you do remember me.<eos> Of course I do.
And what exactly is that?<eos> Donna, he may not be my enemy, and you may not be my enemy, but as long as we're in this trial run, I'm not trusting you with anything.<eos> That's my boy.<eos> Jessica Pearson, I wasn't aware we had an appointment today.<eos> We don't.
Ms. Zane, take the stand.<eos> We can skip swearing her in since she's just gonna lie about it, anyway.<eos> Objection!<eos> Ms. Zane, if you got married six weeks after dating the defendant, why are you engaged to him right now?<eos> Because we did it on a whim.
You can skip trying to cheer me up, because it's not gonna work.<eos> - Rachel...<eos> - I don't want to hear it.<eos> He humiliated me in front of the entire firm.<eos> Yeah, he did.
What are you talking about?<eos> Try to imagine how he treated me when I left him for Louis.<eos> Maybe you do know.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I do.
No further questions, Your Honor.<eos> Your Honor, prosecution calls Donna Paulsen to the stand.<eos> Don't worry, Donna.<eos> She won't ask you point-blank if you knew Mike was a fraud.<eos> What if she does?
Ms. Paulsen, it's my understanding that you arranged Mr. Specter's interviews for the position currently filled by Michael Ross.<eos> Is that correct?<eos> I assisted in the process, yes.<eos> Did you find it suspicious that Mr. Ross wasn't listed on the Harvard class ranking from his first year?<eos> - No, I didn't.
Your Honor...<eos> Mr. Specter is within his rights.<eos> Mr. Kirkwood can take the stand.<eos> How did you know he'd testify?<eos> I didn't until just now.
- Yeah, so were you.<eos> - You were great.<eos> She was better.<eos> Everything she said was true and the jury knows it.<eos> No they don't.
Donna, I need your help and I need it right now.<eos> What's going on?<eos> Is the jury back?<eos> No, I need to know if Stephanie Liston still works<eos> - at the U .S. Attorney's Office. - She does, why?
I know, because he'll never be convinced.<eos> Which is why we need to go to Gibbs together...<eos> - Goddamn it, Jessica, we don't have any time!<eos> Did it ever occur to you that if Mike gets found guilty, the first thing Harvey is going to do is walk in there and take the bullet for me and you?<eos> - No, it didn't.
Well, I'm gonna unmake it, because the judge hasn't ratified it yet, and until she does, nothing is done.<eos> Harvey, stop.<eos> No, you listen to me.<eos> If you think I'm gonna let you do this, you're out of your goddamn mind.<eos> Do what, Mike?
Get me Louis.<eos> Michael.<eos> Gloria, what are you doing here?<eos> I came here to be with you for the verdict, but they told me you made a deal.<eos> I did.
Are you crazy?<eos> You're asking me to decimate my firm for a deal you don't even know she'll take?<eos> - I'll make her take the deal.<eos> - You don't know that.<eos> Yes, I do.
- You don't know that.<eos> Yes, I do.<eos> Jessica, we have a chance to save Mike and let the people who want to go, go.<eos> And what if it doesn't work and we lose everything?<eos> Then we do.
So, how'd it go?<eos> The job fell through.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> I thought you already had it.<eos> I did.
Should either of you betray the other, they will destroy your families.<eos> You'll want some time to think it over.<eos> I do hope you see the merit in my proposal.<eos> We do so love a wedding.<eos> Yes, we do.
You'll want some time to think it over.<eos> I do hope you see the merit in my proposal.<eos> We do so love a wedding.<eos> Yes, we do.<eos> Yes, we do.
I do hope you see the merit in my proposal.<eos> We do so love a wedding.<eos> Yes, we do.<eos> Yes, we do.<eos> Yes, we do.
You're getting married!<eos> It's crazy.<eos> I just wish...<eos> Despite everything she's put me through, I wish my mom could be there.<eos> Of course you do.
28 seconds.<eos> Look, I'm not sorry for firing her.<eos> You called her the "B" word.<eos> I didn't call her a bitch.<eos> Actually, you did.
He told me you're estranged.<eos> And my name is Elizabeth, by the way.<eos> He couldn't find you, so...<eos> Anyway, he says it explains everything.<eos> Yes, it does.
I checked.<eos> He just cleared U.S. airspace.<eos> They're onto the 11th floor. Go.<eos> 15 seconds and counting.<eos> All right, do a full vertical sweep.
No.<eos> Are you currently romantically involved with any other co-worker or subordinate, Agent Weller?<eos> No.<eos> So... do you have any theories on who it is?<eos> Do you?
Jane is not the mole.<eos> Then why did Roman ID her?<eos> You're a Russian counterintelligence agent.<eos> You've had years to bust this spy ring.<eos> You didn't, why?
Just... just to see your face.<eos> You were there with me, the whole time.<eos> In the pouring deluge, in those brooding mountains... .. you were there the whole time.<eos> I, uh... I don't know how to stop this.<eos> Fortunately, I do.
Go home.<eos> You sure?<eos> I can lay on the horn till the neighbors come down.<eos> Is that something you learned in your women's self-defense class?<eos> Yeah, Mel did.
The what?<eos> Your wife was almost two months pregnant, Mr. Jacobs, despite her tubal ligation.<eos> You didn't know, did you?<eos> No.<eos> I didn't.
Perhaps he thought a talking dog was commanding him to offer her spirit to the gods.<eos> He didn't seem crazy to me.<eos> In my experience, a grown man who keeps a photograph of his mother on his desk at work is capable of anything.<eos> Harris Waylon Greer suffocated women with plastic bags.<eos> Someone did the same thing to his daughter.
Someone killed Ellen three nights ago, and then, last night, they tried to kill me, the guy she was sleeping with?<eos> You think it was her husband Ernie.<eos> He found out about us, he killed her, he almost killed me.<eos> You told the police you didn't see the face of the guy who attacked you.<eos> No, but do the math.
So you killed her?<eos> We had a deal.<eos> I miss something?<eos> You already close another case?<eos> As a matter of fact, Detective, you did.
He abducted me and tortured me.<eos> Oscar killed Carter and rescued me.<eos> He showed me a video.<eos> It was a recording I made for myself before they erased my memory.<eos> You did this to yourself.
He showed me a video.<eos> It was a recording I made for myself before they erased my memory.<eos> You did this to yourself.<eos> And did you believe them?<eos> That you did this to yourself?
How's everything going?<eos> Good.<eos> You can talk to me about anything.<eos> You know that, right?<eos> Yeah, I do.
And you let Evan step into her shoes.<eos> I'm gonna talk to you however the hell I want to talk to you.<eos> You flip the minnows to get to the sharks.<eos> Do you even know how Narcotics works?<eos> - Actually, I do.
We're just gonna have to let it play out.<eos> The man takes a spider outside.<eos> How can he be capable...<eos> All due respect I'm not sure you know what he's capable of.<eos> Oh, but you do?
Oh, my God!<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> - I thought if I could just... if I could just bring him back...<eos> - God...<eos> - And I did.
Oh, my God.<eos> - I thought if I could just... if I could just bring him back...<eos> - God...<eos> - And I did.<eos> And I did...
Do you think that matters?<eos> He helped him.<eos> He knew him!<eos> He... he... he...<eos> Everything about him, more than we ever did!
I didn't want to lose my license.<eos> Even if I had reported it, it wouldn't have mattered.<eos> There's very little follow-up in the system.<eos> You know that.<eos> Yeah, I do.
Adam?<eos> I think that's enough.<eos> Let Adam answer the question.<eos> He clearly doesn't know him.<eos> - Do you?
He swore he didn't do it, and I believed him.<eos> What was the boy's name?<eos> Eric.<eos> Monsters don't remember names.<eos> Girl Scouts do.
Once we're there, I'll call the police.<eos> I will let them know where to find you.<eos> I'll be nice and dead by then.<eos> I don't want to go with him.<eos> Then don't.
I have to go now.<eos> No.<eos> I have to.<eos> No.<eos> Please don't.
What?<eos> Give up control when it's the one thing that makes you happy?<eos> Desperate times.<eos> I'd own you.<eos> You already do.
Not at first.<eos> When did it start?<eos> When we were older.<eos> When we started fighting back.<eos> And he did that to Adam, too?
You're using me to send a message to the girl?<eos> Kirsten: He was told things that I was meant to hear and then he was killed.<eos> Black Sedan.<eos> Can't make out the plates.<eos> But maybe you did, Cameron.
Cameron? Cameron?<eos> I can't believe this.<eos> Please... tell me you got the license plate number.<eos> No.<eos> No, I didn't.
Something big was bolted down here.<eos> - Do you feel that?<eos> - What?<eos> Come in.<eos> Yeah, now I do.
Why?<eos> Maggie: I didn't know anything about this chamber.<eos> This is your lab!<eos> How could you not know?<eos> - 'Cause I didn't.
I'm gonna increase security.<eos> You're not going anywhere without an armed detail.<eos> - No.<eos> - You don't get to tell me...<eos> Yes, I do.
Congratulations.<eos> For?<eos> Effective immediately, you're promoted to acting director of the Stitchers Program.<eos> Not sure I want the job.<eos> Sure you do.
Ah, no.<eos> Not really.<eos> This is like that Star Trek episode where Kirk and the Romulan Commander battle each other but in the end develop a deep, mutual respect.<eos> Ah, I have no idea what you're talking about.<eos> -I do.
No dark!<eos> No light! There is only us.<eos> There is no us!<eos> Okay?<eos> Don't... No us!
I'm here!<eos> LAURA: They're fed and ready to go.<eos> Where the hell is the laundry fairy when you need him?<eos> NICHOLAS: Mom. You forgot to sign our permission slip.<eos> Of course I did.
I didn't know if I'd ever forgive him.<eos> - But you did.<eos> - It took time.<eos> A lot.<eos> - But I did.
Well... I don't know.<eos> I don't remember the actual...<eos> actual event.<eos> - Well, then you don't know...<eos> - I don't!
No, it's fine, it's fine.<eos> 45 minutes is not that long to wait.<eos> [groaning]<eos> If it's your life story, and... and you looked like a beaver...<eos> I did.
I looked like a beaver.<eos> Everyone made fun of me, but my mom told me to be proud and show everyone what me and my big teeth could do.<eos> If it's your life story, and... and you looked<eos> - like a beaver...<eos> - I did.
But without... without Al-Qadi, it's only a matter of time before our coalition falls apart.<eos> There are only so many blows you can take before you're done.<eos> I think I'm done.<eos> You knew I'd come, didn't you?<eos> Of course I did.
It's nice out here.<eos> Yeah. Yeah, it's perfect.<eos> You know what today is?<eos> Or... would have been?<eos> Of course I do.
No, don't do that.<eos> You could've let me die.<eos> You should've let me die, but you chose me.<eos> Yes.<eos> I did.
How do you know of this place?<eos> Is there anyone else with you?<eos> What do you know about our mission, hmm?<eos> Who knows you're here, huh? !<eos> You do.
That'll cause an explosion big enough to bring this plane down.<eos> Jane... I'm sorry that I brought you here, all right?<eos> I chose this life, you didn't.<eos> You never had a choice.<eos> Yes, I did.
How do you know it's hers?<eos> If they were really the same...<eos> I know.<eos> And I know why you gave me this mission.<eos> You do?
I've got issues.<eos> I don't believe you.<eos> I know you.<eos> - And I know that you love me, too.<eos> - No, I don't.
I can't do this anymore.<eos> - What?<eos> - I don't feel the same way.<eos> - I know that you love me.<eos> - No... I don't.
They share a cabin out there.<eos> Owen's student was found outside in a field.<eos> These guys never change their M.O.'s.<eos> Send us the cabin address.<eos> Just did.
We searched his belongings for... explosives and computer equipment.<eos> We weren't looking for hidden parachutes.<eos> Rich was the one decoding Ahktar's Squancher messages, so he lied about the Gatsby party so he could wear it.<eos> Yeah, but how'd he know we'd bring his entire storage locker to him?<eos> He didn't.
Taylor?<eos> It's you, isn't it?<eos> It's nice to meet you.<eos> Don't you remember me?<eos> Of course I do.
Did you remember him?<eos> Were you just saying that?<eos> Did we, uh...<eos> Did we used to go fishing... on a bridge over a stream?<eos> Yeah... we did.
- It's just a drill.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> You know what else started as just a drill?<eos> No.<eos> Well, neither do I.
What he was asking me to do was... morally ambiguous at best.<eos> I went along.<eos> Told myself that it was for the greater good, but in my gut, I knew that was a lie.<eos> Didn't sleep well back then.<eos> Still don't.
What does it matter if you're walking away?<eos> How did you find me?<eos> I asked Coombs to show me how to use the Cellphone Trace Protocol program in case you were ever late for a swap.<eos> You didn't tell her where I am, did you?<eos> I didn't.
I start at the D.C. field office tomorrow.<eos> Oh, so it's like your graduation, too.<eos> Well, I better get up there, or nobody's going anywhere.<eos> And here I thought you didn't want me to make it to this day.<eos> I didn't.
To who?<eos> The FBI?<eos> I knew whoever was doing this was inside the Bureau.<eos> That doesn't mean it was Ryan.<eos> No, it doesn't.
Do you regret it...<eos> Sacrificing your career for his?<eos> I mean, you're stuck here at Quantico while Kent is on track to becoming Assistant Director.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I did for a while.
Uh, let me just close down shop.<eos> Ah, you must be...<eos> Raina.<eos> When you introduced yourself earlier, I... I knew you had figured out it was me.<eos> Yes, I did.
Yeah, they did, but they're not anymore.<eos> They only met up with you for one final cash infusion before disappearing for good.<eos> Caleb was too afraid to tell you.<eos> Caleb said that?<eos> Yeah, of course he did.
Hey, no. We cannot tell Eric.<eos> There is no "we".<eos> You have to tell him.<eos> My best friend thinks I killed his wife.<eos> No, no, no, he doesn't.
And that will tell you what, exactly?<eos> I'll find out tonight.<eos> Time isn't on our side.<eos> You find Shaw, you come home in garlands.<eos> And if I don't?
Join the club.<eos> Just not my country club.<eos> Everything's gonna be okay.<eos> How do you know that?<eos> I don't.
In an underground prison.<eos> - The Underworld.<eos> - I'll only be gone for a day.<eos> - Come back to me.<eos> - I always do.
This is just the antechamber.<eos> This is the burial chamber.<eos> The seals are still in tact.<eos> You found something wonderful.<eos> Yes, we did.
Well, the first thing would be to get them clear of the confined space. Out into the dry air.<eos> Yes, yes.<eos> Do you love her?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, I do.
Oh, when's your call time?<eos> 6:00.<eos> I'm first up with Kell.<eos> Aw, we missed the good stuff.<eos> No, you didn't.
I don't know.<eos> Is it?<eos> They're owned by Brightborn?<eos> I knew there was something about Adele.<eos> No, no, you don't.
- you're mincing.<eos> - I don't know what that means.<eos> Donnie, do you have any gay friends?<eos> - No.<eos> - Yes, you do.
You can't do this. I need him.<eos> He needs to pay for what he did to Niki.<eos> I know, alright?<eos> I know about Helsinki.<eos> Did Beth?
Raised by Aldous Leekie. Sent off to boarding school.<eos> Topside...<eos> Helsinki?<eos> You weren't supposed to know about Helsinki.<eos> Well, I do.
You still feeling it?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I haven't had a two-day hangover in a long time.<eos> How are you?<eos> I almost did something desperate.
She's not a threat to Neolution.<eos> Not my call.<eos> I just need to find her.<eos> Well, I don't know where she is.<eos> I don't.
- Alison?<eos> Are you, uh... You all right?<eos> - Let me... Let me help you with this.<eos> - I'm sorry. I don't know what came over me.<eos> Oh, well, I do.
Took me a while to realize what the cell regeneration rates mean to you.<eos> You knew this was on the table, Cosima.<eos> It was there when you gave us Kendall's cancer cells.<eos> You don't even care about a cure, do you?<eos> Of course I do!
And we all looked at each other, and we just smiled.<eos> Wow!<eos> Was that too loud?<eos> I do not usually drink.<eos> (singsongy): But I do now!
Because it's us.<eos> Did you say all that just 'cause you want to get laid?<eos> No.<eos> No, but, uh... did it improve my chances?<eos> - Yes, it did. - Mm-mm. Mm-mm!
- So, who did it?<eos> - Well, it could have been you.<eos> A charge for assault on file, anger issues, Zoe had a bad attitude and didn't show you the respect you think you deserved.<eos> - But that doesn't make me a murderer.<eos> - No. No, it doesn't.
This... .. is the photograph we enlarged, only to discover that within it was the image of Zoe's actual murder taking place.<eos> The other ten or so images are the ones that were taken around it, and there was something about them that bothered me, something that I couldn't quite get my head round, and then it hit me -- they were all framed identically.<eos> The angle didn't change once.<eos> And you presumed we'd never notice.<eos> But unfortunately for you, we did.
And you think he's right... that we shouldn't fight?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I mean... I don't know if I know enough to know.<eos> [Chuckles]<eos> Maybe you do.
It's not about what I think.<eos> People can... They can try and set you in the right direction, but they can't show you the way.<eos> You know, you got to find that for yourself, and...<eos> I thought I had it.<eos> I did.
Take care of yourself.<eos> - I will.<eos> - Do you promise?<eos> Always watching, always ready, remember?<eos> I do.
I love her.<eos> She's my daughter.<eos> But she isn't mine.<eos> I had to accept that.<eos> I did.
No.<eos> I had to do it, too.<eos> Yeah, we all had to... for some milk and some corn.<eos> That wasn't the only reason.<eos> And yeah, we did.
I just thought I was dead out there.<eos> And I got to the shore, and I just passed out.<eos> It's the bridge on Windsor.<eos> You... you know how to get there?<eos> We do.
It's my favorite thing.<eos> You'll never make it.<eos> Yeah, I will.<eos> Let me help you.<eos> You already did.
You know what that means, right?<eos> You know what that means, right?<eos> Ye... Yes.<eos> I love you, Negan.<eos> Oh, of course you do, darlin'.
You probably think I'm a lunatic.<eos> Come on.<eos> Let's go figure out what to do with you.<eos> I didn't want to come back here.<eos> I don't...
We had sex last night.<eos> It was an accident.<eos> Okay.<eos> Is it gonna happen again?<eos> It already did.
Well, the picture of me and the baby.<eos> Iconic. You know, somebody really should write all this down.<eos> Write what down?<eos> These stories.<eos> Well, maybe somebody already did.
Iconic. You know, somebody really should write all this down.<eos> Write what down?<eos> These stories.<eos> Well, maybe somebody already did.<eos> Nobody did.
Write what down?<eos> These stories.<eos> Well, maybe somebody already did.<eos> Nobody did.<eos> No, somebody did.
I guess anything's possible, but... he's in Park Slope with his wife and kids.<eos> Seems pretty happy to me.<eos> Yeah, I was out at the house last week.<eos> He worships the ground his wife walks on.<eos> At least he did.
I do not want to go all legal on him.<eos> And I hope you don't have to.<eos> Hopefully, he'll listen to reason.<eos> You don't know Lenny.<eos> No. I don't.
I want it from you. No one else makes them right.<eos> I'm sorry, Ally.<eos> I mean, Miss...<eos> You know my husband's on the board of this club.<eos> - Of course I do.
Do you want to go after Matty?<eos> See if he's okay?<eos> There was no part of me that wanted to follow Matty McKibben.<eos> For the first time, I didn't feel anything for him... not love, not hate, just indifference.<eos> No, I don't.
Maybe I'm the idiot.<eos> Luke, I'm sorry.<eos> It's just... it's something I have to do.<eos> If you don't want to wait...<eos> I don't.
- Five years probation,<eos> - $14 million in resti... - No jail time?<eos> You think these women want to get dragged through a trial?<eos> I think those women want justice.<eos> I do!
- No.<eos> - In fact, it was 8 miles from either of those places.<eos> Didn't measure.<eos> Do you know how many coffee shops are between your house or office and there?<eos> I don't.
Your Honor, someone has to speak for these victims.<eos> You don't speak.<eos> You ask questions.<eos> And if nobody else saw the doctor dosing...<eos> Someone else did.
Doc says she thinks she could be the key to the whole thing.<eos> How are we gonna protect her if we're dead?<eos> We need a plan.<eos> Well, it sounds like you already got one.<eos> I do.
Previously on "Van Helsing..."<eos> It was murder.<eos> You don't know that.<eos> Yeah, we do.
I put him under to ease the pain,<eos> But when he wakes up he's on his own.<eos> It's gonna hurt like hell, But we can't spare any more analgesic.<eos> I understand.<eos> Really, do you?
Why would I do something stupid like that?<eos> Because that's the only way a group of people trying to live here can safely go about their daily lives.<eos> That is why.<eos> You got a pencil?<eos> I do.
Do you want some?<eos> ! Somebody help us!<eos> Do you like how that feels?<eos> !<eos> Do you?
What, are we just gonna leave her here?<eos> Keep advancing.<eos> What do we do now?<eos> Well they still have to make it through the UV lights and there's no way that's gonna happen.<eos> And if they do, then what?
I mean, they had to think that you were gonna help with this mess somehow or they wouldn't have committed so much manpower to keeping you alive.<eos> And I never felt "stuck" with you, for what it's worth.<eos> Axel.<eos> You know what I'm saying.<eos> Yeah, I do.
So Susan, huh?<eos> We're friends.<eos> Special friends, it looks like.<eos> You wish.<eos> Yeah, kinda do.
It's her...<eos> Sheema!<eos> She's the one...!<eos> I would do anything for the cause. You know that.<eos> I do now.
Look at you, man!<eos> Lookin' good.<eos> You got change?<eos> Feels good.<eos> It does.
They were more special.<eos> Why were they more special?<eos> Because they were good.<eos> They never fought.<eos> But you did.
Yeah, so I'm calling about Dani Duncan's contract.<eos> You need to come up on those numbers.<eos> Because we both know Dani is on fire right now.<eos> Everybody wants her.<eos> They do?
You need to come up on those numbers.<eos> Because we both know Dani is on fire right now.<eos> Everybody wants her.<eos> They do?<eos> No, they don't.
And who wants to be impotent?<eos> You're late.<eos> You knew I was at dinner with my father.<eos> I don't like waiting.<eos> Then don't.
You're working.<eos> You seem good.<eos> What?<eos> You thought you'd find me drunk, playing Russian roulette with the nuclear codes?<eos> You did.
I'm not the obvious choice, then.<eos> You and I both know that's not true.<eos> You don't talk to her?<eos> No.<eos> I don't.
No.<eos> I don't.<eos> You?<eos> No...<eos> I don't.
No?<eos> Hold on.<eos> You hung up on me.<eos> No.<eos> No, you really did.
In other words, the cyanide must have been added directly to her glass.<eos> But how?<eos> Well, thanks to the Commissioner here, we were able to identify three people who might have been able to slip cyanide into the glass.<eos> That is assuming we discount the Commissioner himself here.<eos> - Which we do.
You look good.<eos> What happened?<eos> Yatt were thick as thieves.<eos> - How come he turned you revenant?<eos> - He didn't.
You have all the time in the universe... - literally.<eos> - No, I don't.<eos> And how can you stand there in judgment and accuse me of rejecting my gift?<eos> Do you have any idea how much I've done since I was first struck by lightning, how many people I've helped with the power that you gave me... what I've sacrificed?<eos> Of course we do.
It helps you determine which risks are worth taking.<eos> I think that's something for both you and Wally to take to heart.<eos> I met your little red friend tonight.<eos> Aren't you going to ask me if I killed him?<eos> You didn't.
- Even Zoom.<eos> Harry and Jesse are from Earth-2.<eos> How do we keep the pulse from hurting them?<eos> Oh, Detective, I didn't know you cared.<eos> Yes you did.
So all of Zoom's meta-humans are locked up in Iron Heights?<eos> Most of them.<eos> Some are somewhere else.<eos> I don't want to know.<eos> No you don't.
He was developing her.<eos> You think you're clever?<eos> You're working me?<eos> - You still don't trust me.<eos> - No. I don't.
- Hey, come on.<eos> I still love you.<eos> Hector loves me.<eos> You love him?<eos> Of course I do.
Why the rush?<eos> Opportunity was on the table.<eos> You always have opportunities.<eos> Do you know what headquarters thinks of us?<eos> They don't.
And I'm not someone who loves to apologize.<eos> Uh-huh, right, but you're loving it now, aren't you?<eos> Oh, loving it.<eos> Want another one?<eos> - Yeah, I do.
Not here.<eos> Not where we're going.<eos> We don't know where we're going.<eos> Mom?<eos> Yes, we do.
All brain function has ceased.<eos> So she's not gonna bounce back?<eos> I'm afraid she'll need to stay on life support until she expires.<eos> Did you still want to do her nails?<eos> - Oh, yes, I do.
I'm bankrupt.<eos> I have to begin again.<eos> I have to close half the Ninth Ward tomorrow.<eos> I got to look those people in the eye.<eos> So don't.
- Yeah, you've met my daughter Catherine? - No.<eos> And this is her special friend Marjorie.<eos> I want to get a picture of all of us.<eos> No, Mom, we don't want to take any photos.<eos> Sure, we do.
I know all about your meeting with Marwood and Purcell.<eos> I know all about how you're trying to fuck me with that abstinence program of yours.<eos> Underneath this whole honorable, decent, wholesome Boy Scout crap of yours, I know exactly who you are.<eos> - Oh, you do?<eos> - Yes, I do.
That's all that happened, okay?<eos> - Chris, let me go.<eos> - You have to believe me.<eos> You can't say anything.<eos> What if I do?
- What?<eos> - What?<eos> God, this was their real demand from the beginning.<eos> I mean, those islands didn't come out of nowhere.<eos> Actually, they did.
New Hampshire, wow.<eos> Wow, New Hampshire.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> I did this.
Because black laughs matter.<eos> Is that a joke?<eos> Yes, it is.<eos> I don't get it.<eos> Yes, you do.
And do you know the name of that company?<eos> Google, right?<eos> You said it at the beginning of the story.<eos> You're right.<eos> I did that wrong.
Promote other websites to outrank the bad Nucleus news?<eos> Do you have any idea how big a fucking job that is?<eos> Don't you swear at me.<eos> We don't work here anymore.<eos> For 10 more days you do!
That won't be cheap.<eos> Jeez, man. I'm sorry.<eos> That sucks.<eos> So, where did you sleep last night?<eos> I did not.
- A box.<eos> They make a box.<eos> - You can't make that shit up.<eos> - But you literally did make it up.<eos> Yes, I did.
You stay away from Celia.<eos> Do you hear me?<eos> Travis is coming over that hill.<eos> When he does, that's when we move.<eos> What if he doesn't?
I can bring Travis back.<eos> - No.<eos> - Mom, listen, nothing can touch me.<eos> - You don't know that.<eos> - I do.
- He's just--<eos> - I'm not the boy's daddy.<eos> I just thought that-<eos> - I don't know what's happening to him.<eos> Yes, you do.
What are you doing here?<eos> I came to bring you back. She really needs you.<eos> She's hurting.<eos> - Come on.<eos> - So does he.
She's hurting.<eos> - Come on.<eos> - So does he.<eos> You found him.<eos> No, I didn't.
Dude, it's not like that at all.<eos> It's just this house has, like, nine bedrooms.<eos> You have any idea how scary that gets at night?<eos> So I just wanted to have some roommates around, but, um, you know, I felt weird charging them rent, cause, you know.<eos> No, I don't.
That's good, Ash.<eos> Very good.<eos> You know what you have to do now though, don't you?<eos> No.<eos> I don't.
Like you, I would prefer that he not fear.<eos> And yet we are running out of medicine.<eos> Nicholas, when we run out of cake and drugs, where will we turn?<eos> Comfort is no supplement for faith.<eos> You do that girl no favors.
He was gone before it began.<eos> When everyone began to die, we sent for our mother, but we lost contact with Mama when she was south of the city.<eos> - We should look for her.<eos> - We have.<eos> Pablo did.
I couldn't breathe.<eos> I know that feeling.<eos> No, you don't.<eos> I never thought in a million years I'd put a ring on her finger.<eos> But you did.
Might not be.<eos> I changed my mind.<eos> Your bedside manner is abysmal.<eos> You didn't seem like someone who liked sugar coating.<eos> I don't.
In defeating Baal, he achieved more than I did in thousands of years.<eos> Man, you can really taste the angel dust.<eos> But no matter how baked I get, you're still gone, buddy.<eos> Man, I wish I could just go back in time, and undo all this.<eos> So just do it.
Man, I wish I could just go back in time, and undo all this.<eos> So just do it.<eos> Hey.<eos> Hey.<eos> "Do it?" Do what?
You know, he was... he was sick and we were still figuring shit out. We didn't know how it worked.<eos> We didn't know what was gonna end up happening to him.<eos> We knew there was no way he was not gonna turn.<eos> Troy knew that, so he made us promise not to let that happen to him.<eos> And we didn't.
Oh, you get it?<eos> What is it that you get?<eos> What you're trying to teach me.<eos> I mean, you don't even like James.<eos> No, I don't, son.
We'll have a luau.<eos> Yeah, somebody called me that in high school, and the nickname just stuck.<eos> - Pakistani Denzel.<eos> - I mean, I don't see it.<eos> But everybody else does.
Eric, we're so far from home.<eos> We aren't gonna see home again, babe.<eos> We're gonna make it. There's no turning back.<eos> Do you really think there's hope?<eos> Yes. I do.
We're working as hard as we can.<eos> There's a little girl working on the problem right now, and apparently, she's incredibly smart and funny.<eos> You got it figured out, babe?<eos> Babe, I have no idea what any of this means.<eos> Heidi, yes, you do.
I've had it myself.<eos> Whatever he did... he had a good reason.<eos> But you don't know what that reason is?<eos> 'Cause if you do, you know I can help.<eos> Of course I don't.
She's saying something happened that she didn't want to happen.<eos> That is so not true. We didn't even have sex.<eos> Okay, if that's the case, just give us a DNA sample, and this whole thing goes away.<eos> - Whoa, I don't... - Do you have a warrant?<eos> - Yes, we do.
What's the matter, were you down in that darkroom with her too?<eos> You know, she's only 15.<eos> You're 18. Know what that means?<eos> Whoa, whoa, whoa, I did not touch her.<eos> Yeah, but Chris did though, didn't he?
During the course of our investigation, we became aware that Chris Roberts was a member of the school's unofficial secret society, the Cherry Pickers Club.<eos> What did your investigation find out about this club?<eos> Club's one purpose, to deflower female students, and then to record the names of those conquests on a wall in the library behind a portrait of the school's founder.<eos> The defendant recorded Abby's name on that wall?<eos> - Yes, he did.
How far did you go?<eos> I put my fingers inside her.<eos> I couldn't have done anything else even if we both wanted to, because I finished early.<eos> Did you have sex with Abby Stewart?<eos> No, I did not.
Shahir, look, my brain can wait.<eos> It's her first lead surgery.<eos> Come on.<eos> You remember your first time.<eos> Yeah, I do.
Kristine needs my help to cross over.<eos> Charlie, come on.<eos> Alex, the last time she asked for my help, I turned her away, and then she wrapped her car around a tree.<eos> Well, you can't blame yourself for that.<eos> I kind of do.
No.<eos> Mr. President did not.<eos> I should write that down.<eos> Do you know the meaning of "off the record"?<eos> Of course I do.
I want to know, is Fitzgerald Grant hell-bent on making a difference in the final days of his presidency, or is he happy just tending the store?<eos> I want to know if the man I voted for thinks he succeeded or failed.<eos> I have no ulterior motive here, aside from wanting to write a damn good article.<eos> Do you want me to write a damn good article?<eos> Of course we do.
You know what I mean?<eos> Well, I am an overachiever.<eos> Once I put my mind to something, I commit.<eos> Tell me you brought more.<eos> Oh, damn straight I did.
Extra drivers booked.<eos> The ambulance has to be restocked and crewed.<eos> Routes to major trauma centers have to be plotted as well as the distances to Marine One and Air Force One.<eos> The football has to be in attendance, as does the mobile command center.<eos> - We never did any of this with Olivia.
- What-what you got?<eos> Hit me. Okay, first of all, how many pull-ups can you actually do?<eos> Because I saw you do 24 once.<eos> I don't want to overestimate, but...<eos> Uh, maybe I do.
He went to Mystic Falls.<eos> Damon's gotten himself into some trouble with Julian.<eos> - What?<eos> - No, I-I told him he didn't have to worry, that I would stay here and look after you.<eos> Yeah, of course you did.
- Move.<eos> - No.<eos> Move.<eos> You know what? You got no idea what you just did.<eos> Actually, I do. I do.
Second chance she'd stolen in Boone?<eos> What was she talking about?<eos> I don't know.<eos> She tried to help you, and you lied to her!<eos> No, I didn't.
How's that for a normal teenager?<eos> - Sure, that's good too. - Mmm.<eos> - So, have you read it, the bill? - No.<eos> No, she hasn't sent it over yet.<eos> - I did.
_<eos> _<eos> _<eos> Trust me, I know how difficult this is.<eos> You don't.
Logan was wrong, of course.<eos> Good ol' William... couldn't get you out of his head.<eos> He kept looking. Worried you were out there alone, afraid.<eos> He knew he'd find you.<eos> And eventually, he did.
It was when Arnold died, when I suffered, that I... began to understand what he had found.<eos> To realize I was wrong.<eos> But you kept us here in this hell.<eos> Bernard, I told you, Arnold didn't know how to save you.<eos> I do.
Dr. Manning?<eos> You okay?<eos> No.<eos> I think my water just broke.<eos> Oh, my God. It did.
All right, it's his first day.<eos> - He'll be fine.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Well, at least he's got a big sister to turn to when he needs someone to show him how it's done.<eos> Yeah, he does.
Um, V, sometimes it's like... Like you don't understand me or...<eos> Even believe in me.<eos> It sucks.<eos> What?<eos> Of course I do.
So I called him, then I texted him, then I Snapchatted him;<eos> Never heard back from him.<eos> Next thing I know, he's on a waterslide with some skank.<eos> And he tagged me in the picture.<eos> - No, he didn't!
No, I'm good.<eos> Chili, I'm trying to talk to you.<eos> About what?<eos> That woman almost died today.<eos> Yeah, but she didn't.
You said you had something for me?<eos> What is this really about?<eos> What's what really about?<eos> You said you wanted my help finding Hector Mendoza.<eos> I do.
Sir?<eos> Sir?<eos> The president hung up on me.<eos> I'm sure he doesn't blame you.<eos> No, no, he does.
Queen Elizabeth... like it's a big secret!<eos> We're not stupid, Maureen.<eos> - We're not deaf!<eos> - I never called her that.<eos> - I didn't!
We're not stupid, Maureen.<eos> - We're not deaf!<eos> - I never called her that.<eos> - I didn't!<eos> I didn't!
- We're not deaf!<eos> - I never called her that.<eos> - I didn't!<eos> I didn't!<eos> - But she did!
Hey!<eos> Get away from him now, you filthy, little gobshites.<eos> It's me you're lookin' for, right?<eos> And honestly, boys, I don't know how you keep finding me.<eos> Truly, I don't.
Can I get an "amen," boys?<eos> Mom, no.<eos> Make the kid watch.<eos> I know you.<eos> I do.
Absolu...<eos> Yes, absolutely.<eos> - Oh, really?<eos> - Mm-hmm.<eos> I did.
You know about him?<eos> What he is?<eos> - Jesus.<eos> - That's right.<eos> You did.
It was an accident.<eos> Yes.<eos> I should've listened.<eos> That's right.<eos> But I didn't.
Can I get an amen, boys?<eos> - There we go.<eos> - Make him watch.<eos> I know you.<eos> I do.
! I...<eos> I don't know.<eos> Where is he?<eos> I don't know.<eos> None of us do.
Why would...<eos> We should not be messing with the DEO.<eos> You know about the DEO?<eos> No. You just told me about them.<eos> - No, I didn't.
We should not be messing with the DEO.<eos> You know about the DEO?<eos> No. You just told me about them.<eos> - No, I didn't.<eos> - Yeah, you did.
Red sunlight?<eos> Yeah.<eos> No!<eos> You wasted your ammo.<eos> No, I didn't.
Um, Ms. Grant just told me...<eos> Lucy quit.<eos> You told her I was Supergirl and she left the city?<eos> No, I didn't tell her.<eos> - You didn't?
Well, there you go.<eos> Everything you need to know, you know.<eos> You're 10R, after all.<eos> Well, I don't know what Eddie's hiding.<eos> Huh. Don't you?
You know what might make us good is you jumping in this lake.<eos> Oh, yeah?<eos> Yeah.<eos> You want me to jump in the lake?<eos> - Yeah, I kind of do.
Weaponizing alien abilities for military purposes.<eos> What do they do to humans?<eos> Does Clark know where it is?<eos> No.<eos> No one does.
That's the thing about being a superhero.<eos> You have to somehow be prepared for the unexpected.<eos> Something happened to me a few weeks ago.<eos> I was exposed to this substance that made me crazy.<eos> I did a lot of horrible things.
And all you're doing is betraying her.<eos> I was with Astra in her final moments.<eos> We forgave each other, we paid respect to our blood bonds.<eos> - She didn't want this.<eos> - Of course she did.
I'm not alone.<eos> I'm, uh... I'm with Ms. Grant.<eos> Why wasn't Cat affected?<eos> Maxwell Lord protected her and himself.<eos> Of course he did.
It'll ride the wave without anybody knowing a thing.<eos> -CAT: I have one question for you, Max.<eos> -MAX: Shoot.<eos> The earrings, how did you know I would wear them?<eos> I didn't.
Oh, you're gonna be when I sue you.<eos> Uh, why... why would you sue us?<eos> I never gave permission for the school to use it to put on that play.<eos> So you're liable.<eos> Yes, you did.
But the power went out.<eos> And when I looked through the broken window, I saw something.<eos> What did you see, exactly?<eos> You're not gonna believe me.<eos> They certainly didn't.
I'm deadly serious.<eos> You ever miss life on the road? Nah.<eos> Nah, I had my fun.<eos> You want to know the secret to living a long and happy life?<eos> Actually, yes, I do.
You want to know the secret to living a long and happy life?<eos> Actually, yes, I do.<eos> Follow your heart.<eos> You do that, all the rest just figures itself out.<eos> I did that.
But the report suggests the skin of the victim's face was removed while he was still alive.<eos> You remember the case we handled with the alien sightings?<eos> Yeah, the missing cow ovary mystery.<eos> Never figured that one out.<eos> Well, actually, we did.
- Maggie, I was just...<eos> - I'm already in the hot seat with Blair.<eos> I don't need you taking any risks with this case.<eos> - You can't bench me now.<eos> - I just did.
No, it is not about you.<eos> It's just how I want to live my life now, that's it.<eos> Just unafraid.<eos> Kirsten, you know how I feel about you.<eos> You do.
Kirsten, you know how I feel about you.<eos> You do.<eos> I know what you must have seen when you were in my head.<eos> And you... you might not feel the same way.<eos> Maybe you do. I...
Cops...<eos> Sorry, hmm?<eos> Josh?<eos> You called the cops?<eos> Of course I did.
I'm...<eos> I'm addicted.<eos> Who's she in love with?<eos> You really want to know?<eos> Yes, I do.
I just want to spend time with him.<eos> I want so badly to go back to the way things were.<eos> ♪ Romantic moments you had ♪<eos> ♪ That he didn't know were romantic ♪<eos> ♪ Or maybe he did a little ♪
How about that?<eos> Are you blackmailing me?<eos> Oh, you know what they say, one person's blackmailing is another person's love story.<eos> Who says that?<eos> Me. I do.
Man, she looks hot in her little legal outfit, right?<eos> I'd pound that gavel.<eos> Guys, nobody wants to watch this silly trial.<eos> Hey!<eos> Yes, they do.
I just wanted to make everyone happy.<eos> And, I don't know, I wanted you to be proud of me.<eos> You wanted me to be... proud of you?<eos> I didn't know you thought about me that much.<eos> Of course I do.
Previously on Crazy Ex-Girlfriend...<eos> Let's delve into your childhood.<eos> Oh, I was afraid you'd say that.<eos> - I used to like her.<eos> - You still do.
Who knows?<eos> I don't even think about that anymore.<eos> Why not?<eos> Didn't you go all the way to LA just to tell her you dig her?<eos> Yes, I did, Chris.
- I know as much as all you do.<eos> - So you'd say?<eos> - If you knew something?<eos> - Aye.<eos> But I don't.
Who else was here at the time?<eos> Skinny, paying bed and board.<eos> And Johnny Blackwood.<eos> He and Red never saw eye to eye.<eos> A lot of folk didn't.
Is it always somebody else's fault, the chaos that surrounds you?<eos> It's always you, John, at the centre of the heartache, the turmoil.<eos> You left here, destroyed our father's life, returned years later and lied your way into the town I built.<eos> - I had no choice.<eos> - You never do.
You're not the first and you won't be the last, love.<eos> I'm such an idiot.<eos> The world is full of men like Rory.<eos> Promise the earth to get what they want.<eos> Well, he did.
There's a great wall of boulders blocking the tunnel.<eos> Mr Blackwood and his brother are trapped down inside.<eos> Want my advice?<eos> Aye.<eos> Aye, we do.
The country of your birth.<eos> The people here.<eos> Your own flesh and blood.<eos> Well, I would've done if they'd accepted the woman I love.<eos> But they didn't, so I don't.
- I did, too.<eos> Obviously, not hard enough.<eos> No.<eos> You never apologized.<eos> To your papa, I most certainly did.
Says who?<eos> Me.<eos> I thought you hated that place.<eos> I do.<eos> We all do.
No, it's not that.<eos> I was just thinking how I'd like us to spend more time together.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> We spend all our time together.<eos> No, we don't.
The grey, old men?<eos> The men with moustaches?<eos> They hate me.<eos> - They do not hate you.<eos> - They do.
It's wonderful.<eos> - Is there anything you'd like to ask us?<eos> - Does your wife know?<eos> - No, ex-wife.<eos> - She does.
I was just thinking it's been two days with no one trying to kill us.<eos> It won't last.<eos> I know. But are we just supposed to spend the time between attacks dreading the next one?<eos> Not like we have much of a choice.<eos> Maybe we do.
Jasper's actually smiling.<eos> Clarke. Let it go.<eos> We can't just leave.<eos> It's not like we have much of a choice.<eos> Maybe we do.
Your word?<eos> I served your father with distinction for 20 years.<eos> You shipped me out to Staten Island the day he left the building.<eos> This has got nothing to do with that.<eos> Of course it does.
We went into the basement.<eos> There were rats, he passed out, we kissed.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> And you like him.<eos> No. No, I don't.
Uh, earwax is doing better than old Caroline.<eos> Come on, Caroline.<eos> Let's shake these asses and get them passes.<eos> Do you think I should shave my back for tomorrow for Game Con?<eos> My mom does.
A week?<eos> There goes the "no sex while Max and Caroline are awake" rule.<eos> That wasn't sex you were having in front of us?<eos> Max, Caroline, I don't know how I'll ever repay you for getting Eunice off my back.<eos> I do.
I can't stop thinking about that note.<eos> What if it was meant for me?<eos> Look, I know you're focusing on finding your father, but honestly, it sounds like a stretch, Stretch.<eos> Not all roads lead to Daniel Stinger.<eos> Yeah, but what if this one does?
There's nothing to tell.<eos> All right? We went out once and she blew me off.<eos> I just wanted a second chance.<eos> She didn't have to call the cops.<eos> She didn't.
Why did you stay?<eos> And don't even tell me it was "for the rewards of teaching."<eos> Really?<eos> You want to hear about this?<eos> Of course I do.
- Did they suddenly sprout?<eos> Mm. Oh. Time it goes to work, my precious.<eos> Oh, God.<eos> Why'd you tell him?<eos> Why didn't you?
You did the right thing.<eos> At least you didn't kill her.<eos> She's lucky you aren't a better shot.<eos> How did she know about the Stitchers program?<eos> She didn't.
There's no trace of Kim's mind manipulation left.<eos> Good.<eos> Thank you for what you did at the studio.<eos> How did you know that I'd snap out of it and not shoot you?<eos> I didn't.
I forgot my mittens.<eos> I have to pee.<eos> Oh, for God's sake.<eos> I asked you if you needed to pee before you got in the car.<eos> Yeah, well, at the time, I didn't.
You're very close.<eos> Something feels wrong.<eos> I know.<eos> I remember this.<eos> - You do?
Guess what I've got.<eos> Mr. Bray.<eos> I take it from your self-congratulatory expression, you have found the missing bones.<eos> I did.<eos> We-we did.
Mr. Bray.<eos> I take it from your self-congratulatory expression, you have found the missing bones.<eos> I did.<eos> We-we did.<eos> Hodgins did.
We had one glorious night in Puerto Vallarta, but there was a 30% chance of a hurricane, which is 100% too much for a Jew.<eos> But... we did manage to bring a little Puerto Vallarta back with us.<eos> Oh, my damn.<eos> Alan loves it.<eos> - You do?
But... we did manage to bring a little Puerto Vallarta back with us.<eos> Oh, my damn.<eos> Alan loves it.<eos> - You do?<eos> - I do.
And it should be cool.<eos> And I want it to be cool.<eos> But it's not cool yet.<eos> I get it.<eos> No, I don't.
Well, at least we got our first awkward bondage experience out of the way.<eos> Hey, I said "first," and then I said "said."<eos> Hey, high five for getting our feeling back to all of our proper places.<eos> You know, I actually do have a fantasy.<eos> - You do?
The two aren't...<eos> No, that's...<eos> They're two different situations.<eos> I mean, clearly, my mother had been keeping us apart and we were meant to be together.<eos> Mm, I did some research.
Oh, wow.<eos> Morning.<eos> Good morning.<eos> You know, I really do love you, Becca.<eos> Of course you do.
You know, he loved me.<eos> He did.<eos> But of course I couldn't have that.<eos> Did you snoop around my room?<eos> Oh, you did, didn't you? !
She never told me any of this.<eos> Why?<eos> Because she didn't want to hurt you.<eos> Because someone did love you.<eos> Someone still does.
I always knew he was an abandoning piece garbage, but, geez, I thought at least I could blame my mother for it.<eos> Can't believe she never told me that story.<eos> She never misses an opportunity to rub things in.<eos> Maybe you misjudged her in some way.<eos> Maybe I did.
It's on the new Catfishing Channel.<eos> Oh, my god, it is so good.<eos> I-I binged the entire thing.<eos> Okay, I know what's happening.<eos> - You do?
- Do you know what time it is?<eos> !<eos> - I'm half an hour late.<eos> - I told you to stay here!<eos> - No, you didn't!
!<eos> - I'm half an hour late.<eos> - I told you to stay here!<eos> - No, you didn't!<eos> - Yes, I did!
Thanks.<eos> You're good with bikes.<eos> I won the Tour de France ten times.<eos> - I know who you are.<eos> - You do?
It was dark...<eos> I couldn't avoid him.<eos> Did you go to jail?<eos> No...<eos> I didn't, unfortunately.
Take him down.<eos> Take him down now!<eos> He's not a Lycanthrope.<eos> - You know?<eos> - Yeah, we do.
- Sam!<eos> What happened to me?<eos> The Witness took control of you.<eos> I don't love you!<eos> You did once.
Then what are we still doing here?<eos> For what?<eos> Why continue this?<eos> You know why.<eos> No. I don't.
God damn it, Jennifer.<eos> Today is September 23, 2044.<eos> The day I die.<eos> This didn't have to happen.<eos> It already did.
- If you hurry, I can...<eos> - Oh, no, I can't do that flight.<eos> I strongly encourage you to get on the earlier flight unless you want to spend the night next to that guy.<eos> Why did he fall asleep on that wet spot?<eos> He didn't.
- You.<eos> I want to kiss you. - Someone like me.<eos> - I do want to kiss you.<eos> - No, no.<eos> - Yes, I do. - No.
Please sit down.<eos> - You want to, too.<eos> - You must...<eos> - Oh. - I can tell.<eos> - I don't!
Your ex-husband went to see Gina Larson yesterday.<eos> Okay. I give up.<eos> Who's Gina Larson?<eos> Like you don't know.<eos> I don't.
- No, I can't.<eos> Besides, you have already stated your ability to run the ship without me for some time.<eos> In jest, my dear boy, when you become mutinous and presumptuous.<eos> You know how much I depend on you.<eos> - I do.
- Golf?<eos> - Anything else?<eos> - Oil painting.<eos> - I'm told he paints landscapes.<eos> - Oh, don't they all?
Your Majesty, I've had the opportunity to think about your very kind offer to become your Private Secretary.<eos> And I'm afraid I must decline.<eos> Why?<eos> In this instance, I really do believe you'll be better served by Michael.<eos> No, you don't.
At the end of the bar.<eos> - Hello.<eos> - Hello, Porchey!<eos> - You found the place all right?<eos> - The taxi driver did, yes.
Terrible despair.<eos> Hiding like a Leviathan.<eos> Like a sea monster.<eos> - You saw all that?<eos> - Yes, I did.
Do you honestly think i would do anything to put Caroline at risk?<eos> What the hell is going on here?<eos> Stefan, go.<eos> We can take it from here.<eos> How we doing?
She could sense that something was off.<eos> You know, the late hours, no family ever around.<eos> Elizabeth wanted to tell her who we were, and I didn't.<eos> We fought about it for months.<eos> And then we did.
- Our next Blacklister.<eos> Manuel Orentez Esteban.<eos> Leader of Pinochet's Caravan of Death that institutionalized a state-sponsored system of terror through abuse, abduction, and murder.<eos> According to our database, he died in 1989.<eos> Except he didn't.
Let me think.<eos> Okay, what I'm thinking is, um, did you help Agent Keen fake her death?<eos> Aram!<eos> Not helpful, I know.<eos> Okay. But did you?
- Local oscillator.<eos> - The oscillator.<eos> Right. Of course.<eos> Okay, if you could rewire it, you might be able to turn the PLL receiver into this-- ...into a low power mono FM transmitter that produces a signal that you can trace.<eos> You do?
But if this whole skinny-dipping thing ever even happens, you have nothing to worry about.<eos> - Easy for you to...<eos> - You're still talking.<eos> You have nothing to worry about because nobody's going to be looking at you, because all those other kids are gonna be too preoccupied with their own insecurities.<eos> But I-if they do?
So be honest with me.<eos> You like Governor Vargas' free-education plan, don't you?<eos> That's correct.<eos> And you want to see it implemented around the country?<eos> I really do.
It's Sunday-night dinner.<eos> Can I come in?<eos> Um, this is a surprise.<eos> You keep saying that you don't want to eat at the house.<eos> Well, tonight, I do.
I know you're thinking of doing something else with your life.<eos> I get it, I do.<eos> You're not a one-trick pony, and it's a trick... y decision.<eos> You see what I'm doing here?<eos> I do, I do.
That sex train.<eos> Do you hear it?<eos> Chugga, chugga, chugga, chugga, his dick!<eos> You know what I'm saying?<eos> No, I don't.
I was tending to the garden.<eos> Nice toss, by the way.<eos> That's the exact kind of throw that would beat a soft nickel, assuming that the safety bites it on a fake pump, of course.<eos> Didn't know you knew so much about football, Billie.<eos> She doesn't.
Don't talk like-- You're not in slo-mo.<eos> - Maybe I was.<eos> - You're not.<eos> Did you ever think I was for a second?<eos> No, I didn't.
Guy I hooked up with while I was on the inside.<eos> Nobody you would know.<eos> That's reassuring.<eos> Look, I would tell you that you can trust the dude, but really, I shouldn't have to, because you should trust me.<eos> I do, Levi.
Danny, you haven't exactly been participating.<eos> What's your take on all this?<eos> Uh, my take on, uh, this is, um-- sorry-- it's stupid, and I'd like to just go take a nap if that's okay.<eos> So you don't see the value in anything we do here?<eos> I-I don't.
That's right.<eos> I was, uh, just wondering, sir, if it might be possible for you to teach me that.<eos> I don't work here.<eos> Sorry.<eos> You... You don't?
- I wanted to see how you were.<eos> How are you feeling?<eos> - Oh, he smells like heaven.<eos> Think he knows me?<eos> - Of course he does.
- I know that too.<eos> - So, I don't want to give anyone the wrong impression.<eos> - It amazes me how dumb a doctor can be.<eos> Everybody knows you like Natalie.<eos> - They do?
Really, mike?<eos> Because a woman who cries sexual assault. Might just be looking for attention?<eos> Or... or maybe she was confused.<eos> Maybe she really did want it. Maybe she did.<eos> Maybe she did,
You're a famous author.<eos> And you've been to prison.<eos> Sir thomas malory wrote le morte d'arthur. When he was prison.<eos> Did you know that?<eos> No, I didn't.
I want to come with you.<eos> What?<eos> I want to Walk.<eos> I want to Walk with you.<eos> Son, you, uh... you do this alone.
That's not what he did, Leonard.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> Do you actually want to know what he worked on?<eos> Yes.<eos> No, you don't.
I think the President's in town or something.<eos> Miss Senate, Miss Kittridge, and Mr. Letts were all here on time.<eos> The litigant bringing the case can't be bothered.<eos> Well, if protocol seems to count--<eos> - Judge: It does!
No, because it's hard enough.<eos> But I promised you.<eos> If you want this baby, half as much as I do, you are never gonna forgive yourself if you keep this promise.<eos> I don't know what to do.<eos> Yeah, you do.
But tomorrow, we're gonna fix your boot,<eos> I'm gonna get you to your kingdom, drop you off, and then I can go and rescue Isabella.<eos> All you care about is saving your precious Isabella.<eos> You don't care about me.<eos> Nobody does.
was it? did you... save him?<eos> Everyone's on board.<eos> Let's go home.<eos> Sir. Sir. Stay with me.<eos> I did.
I don't think we will be fighting over Myung Ju.<eos> Let's be on the same side when we do fight.<eos> It feels good to drink during the day.<eos> Do you know that we have never said "I love you" to each other?<eos> We did it with our actions instead of with words.
If she did, you got to wonder who killed her to keep her from getting it.<eos> Actually, we may already have a pretty good idea.<eos> Charlotte Konig was suing your company for $100 million, correct?<eos> She claimed we stole her process for turning algae into biofuel.<eos> Did you?
Yeah, I didn't like it.<eos> Can I come in?<eos> Yeah, sorry.<eos> See my hat? "Take a byte out of Silicon Valley."<eos> I do.
♪ Don't remember ♪ not tonight.<eos> Doug!<eos> What the hell are you doing?<eos> He knows.<eos> Don't you?
Yeah.<eos> Okay, then.<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> He got the message.<eos> Damn right he did.
I've done some really bad things.<eos> Let me out!<eos> Hurt people.<eos> You got any idea what I'm about to do to you?<eos> Yeah. I do.
I made copies of his files and assigned each case its own room.<eos> As you can see, the library tells the tale of a hate crime, a church burnt to the ground in 1981.<eos> The arsonist, never identified.<eos> You think that's who killed Underhill?<eos> I do not.
I had to make sure you weren't trying to cheat me.<eos> I told you not to use it.<eos> This could ruin everything.<eos> - I think I know what I'm doing.<eos> - No, you don't.
That it sucks out of people.<eos> Right. Here's more.<eos> "And when it melts into the skin, "age disappears, but it becomes highly addictive, "shattering lives, and making monsters of those who use it." Oh.<eos> Well, there's a happy ending.<eos> Not done.
I think you can probably manage, don't you?<eos> I've been observing all the ladies, but none of them dance as well as you.<eos> Please, will you do me the honour?<eos> - If you insist.<eos> - I do.
Okay.<eos> So, Brittany, get an IT guy to blow these images up, and then all three of you go through this list, and find somebody that knows what this shit is.<eos> You don't think the video would be enough?<eos> With this judge?<eos> No, I don't.
There, there.<eos> Are you hungry?<eos> Yes, you are.<eos> Your mummy knows exactly what you need, doesn't she?<eos> Yes, she does.
No. No, no.<eos> There's no way that Jack would give Salib his location.<eos> Not even to save his family in Afghanistan?<eos> Remember those dirt bikes we rode in Joshua Tree?<eos> Oh, yeah, of course I do.
He's not in.<eos> Therefore, I must by law allow this lawsuit to proceed.<eos> Mr. McBride has filed for a number of discovery requests and moved for an expedited discovery schedule.<eos> Well, obviously, we'll need a few months to comply with those requests.<eos> No, you don't.
That if Mr. McBride brought up Rachel Kennedy, I should hit back with...<eos> He told you to speak?<eos> Really?<eos> Yeah.<eos> He did.
Why would you think that?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Free-floating anxiety.<eos> It wasn't because I reached out to Lucy Kittridge, was it?<eos> Why did you?
Molly!<eos> Mol!<eos> Hey, stranger.<eos> Hey, Harry. Have you seen Molly?<eos> Sure did.
- Tell her?<eos> I'm gonna go grab a box of crap that she gave me.<eos> Honey, Jen just took someone from the yard sale over to Heather's house.<eos> I was wondering if you knew what was going on.<eos> I do not.
I believe you know him.<eos> And his family.<eos> Well, he's 20, so we can charge him as an adult.<eos> The question is, how do you know him?<eos> I don't, personally.
I'll make a statement.<eos> No, you won't.<eos> I'm not allowing a statement.<eos> That's fine because Ms.Reagan-Boyle already got Kyle Miller to make a statement, vindicating her.<eos> He did?
I can guarantee you she went out the door, George.<eos> Sir, either way, I suggest we keep an eye out for a mysterious veiled lady.<eos> - What do you make of that?<eos> - Looks like ivory.<eos> It certainly does.
So you thought your secret was safe, until your father came to town.<eos> All he really cared about was finding Gloria.<eos> - He had heard rumours she married rich.<eos> - He wanted money?<eos> Of course he did.
- Don't ask.<eos> What's that?<eos> You want to hear how we spent our evening?<eos> - No, he really doesn't.<eos> - No, I don't.
Not only control, but make them stronger.<eos> Ha! Seems Galavant has brought the wrong covered dish to the potluck dinner.<eos> Ha! They're kind of attacking everyone, our men included.<eos> Well, you make a cake, you break a few eggs.<eos> So, how do we do this?
In jail.<eos> The Regina Sumner case?<eos> Hi, Pam.<eos> You don't know me.<eos> I do!
I just had these done.<eos> You know, you have no idea what that sword makes you do.<eos> Of course I do...<eos> Not.<eos> No, I don't.
Put down that cat.<eos> Wha...<eos> Richard, you're... You're alive?<eos> You didn't go to war?<eos> No, I did.
You hooked up with "The Stick" back in the day.<eos> A one-timer. I date CEOs, not gangsters.<eos> The night Cassidy bit it, she came back from her break screaming about how she just caught Nick banging some other chick, and that she was gonna send his ass to jail.<eos> Did anyone else see Nick here that night?<eos> We all did.
Look, we know where Nick is.<eos> We've got squad cars heading over to pick him up as we speak.<eos> But if anyone knows who the other woman is...<eos> I saw Helvetica grinding him in the storage room once.<eos> You did not.
Tell you what, I'll count down from five. If you hang up before I get to zero, I'll assume it's true.<eos> Five...<eos> What are you doing?<eos> You asked me to go through Bailey's records.<eos> No, I didn't.
When I heard she was dead, I told him I wanted out, or I'd go above his head.<eos> He told me, I'd better not talk to anyone, unless I wanted to end up like Bailey.<eos> Thank you, buddy.<eos> Now, um, what informant did you say this was?<eos> - We didn't.
I'll laminate the map, but not the inventory.<eos> We'll need to update that as it changes.<eos> Ah, old Liv.<eos> Don't let anyone tell you the girl doesn't know how to party.<eos> Because you do.
Temporary insanity, that's all it was.<eos> I'm done with old me.<eos> You can trust me with almost anything.<eos> You should know that.<eos> I do.
Bye.<eos> Hey.<eos> Liv. I wasn't really expecting company.<eos> You said I should think things over.<eos> I did.
I want it open. Leave it open.<eos> All right.<eos> It's a stupid chart.<eos> I never said you were stupid.<eos> Oh, yes, you did, and you don't do it again, and you definitely don't do it during the deposition.
No one ever died because Donald fucked them.<eos> And don't kid yourself.<eos> Lucy knows exactly what she's doing.<eos> You know who I really hate, though, right?<eos> - You do.
We had a lot of stuff in there...<eos> Um, newspapers... pictures of the family, coins, stamps, some predictions.<eos> Father Anan came over last night.<eos> Did you know that?<eos> No, I didn't.
...a killer known for strangling his victims and leaving no trace at the scene except for his eerie calling card:<eos> a small silver handbell.<eos> ...six victims from 1999 to 2002, before the murders abruptly stopped and the case went cold.<eos> Many of you remember the terror that gripped our city during that time.<eos> I certainly do.
Do you know... that if you cut a worm in half, both sides stay alive?<eos> Jack.<eos> Let me talk to your Uncle Garrett for a minute, okay?<eos> You said you'd never come back.<eos> I did.
So I tapped into an oversaturated yet popular market with the coders.<eos> Check it out.<eos> You invented an energy drink?<eos> No, no.<eos> Callen and Sam did.
Listen.<eos> I know you only go to the meetings because you got a nudge from the judge.<eos> Yeah, that's right.<eos> - But if you ever need someone to talk to...<eos> - I don't.
Hi.<eos> I'll see you guys later.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> Well, I just thought maybe we could get a coffee or something.<eos> I don't...
Thanks.<eos> My parents don't usually like me drinking coffee.<eos> That should be the least of their worries.<eos> Do you smoke weed?<eos> I do.
- is a lie. - No, it's not.<eos> Yeah, this family treated Danny like shit for years.<eos> Is that a lie?<eos> You know nothing about it.<eos> - Oh, yes, I do.
It's for, um... I'll tell you later.<eos> Thank you, T.<eos> Tommy, why'd you do that to Holly?<eos> Ghost told me what happened.<eos> He did?
Over metro D.C. in less than 30.<eos> Damn.<eos> Hell of a day to quit smoking.<eos> Didn't know you smoked, ma'am.<eos> I don't.
We won't know what it is until... Until we do the autopsy.<eos> Right, right.<eos> Yes.<eos> But if I didn't know any better...<eos> Well, clearly you don't.
Not going anywhere.<eos> Your life is in danger.<eos> Not the first time.<eos> - You don't understand.<eos> - But I do.
But you need special technology that erases the location data in real time.<eos> It fits in a briefcase.<eos> - Do we know how to do that?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Who else does?
Those who see blue rats are always right.<eos> I've given 30 years to the company.<eos> And I've been unfailingly loyal.<eos> I really believed in it.<eos> And I still do.
- We use our brains.<eos> - Yes, but my brain is telling me we should use magic.<eos> I mean, we have the greatest collection of magic in the whole world, right here in this building.<eos> And we never put it work for us.<eos> - I do.
- Yes, but my brain is telling me we should use magic.<eos> I mean, we have the greatest collection of magic in the whole world, right here in this building.<eos> And we never put it work for us.<eos> - I do.<eos> - You do what?
I think that without the Ankh, and without a host body to inhabit, we don't have much to worry about there.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> All right, let's get this over with.<eos> I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> Oh, yes you do.
- There's not much I can do about that.<eos> Okay, you know what, you know what, we'll discuss this amongst ourselves.<eos> I mean, uh, nobody wants to see how the sausage is made,<eos> - am I right?<eos> - No, they don't.
Why you hate me so much?<eos> - I don't...<eos> I don't hate you.<eos> I don't hate you.<eos> - Oh, my God, you don't?
- Yes. - Chicago.<eos> So... the money, the fake I.D.'s.<eos> I have fake I.D.'s because hospitals hate pharmaceutical reps and it gets me through the door.<eos> I carry Canadian cash because I do a lot of business there and I don't trust banks.<eos> Who does?
He's showing her credentials.<eos> The LAPD detectives are incredibly proud of their badges.<eos> They wear them clipped to their belt or jacket or on a chain.<eos> They don't carry creds.<eos> No. But we do.
I was buying food for dinner.<eos> For who?<eos> Savannah.<eos> Do you love her?<eos> Yes, I--I do.
They didn't promote my album.<eos> ...CD packaging and breakage.<eos> Almost everything was online.<eos> I mean, I don't... I don't... I don't remember negotiating any of this stuff.<eos> You probably didn't.
You fired me.<eos> And I've never worked there.<eos> We want you back.<eos> And we want you to come with her.<eos> Diane does?
Not going anywhere.<eos> Your life is in danger.<eos> Not the first time.<eos> - You don't understand.<eos> - But I do.
And it is so, so wrong.<eos> God, it feels so good.<eos> You didn't have to go that far.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I did.
You feel it in your hearts? all:<eos> Yes.<eos> Do you feel it in your souls?<eos> All: Yes.<eos> Well, I don't.
He's here right now. all:<eos> No! And make no mistake about it.<eos> What he wants is your immortal soul.<eos> - All:<eos> No! - He does.
If there's anything there, we should get an image.<eos> Got some Aramaic here.<eos> And some form of Latin.<eos> I think what you got here is very, very old.<eos> We do too.
That's where you met Vera.<eos> She was young, impressionable.<eos> You were a Detective Sergeant.<eos> How could she refuse you?<eos> But she did.
How can you even question it?<eos> His denial seemed sincere.<eos> And I don't believe he would have chosen hemlock.<eos> Nobody in their right mind would choose hemlock.<eos> Plato did.
The shock made you give up your job, the Church and embrace the bottle.<eos> I suspect you were looking for life's exit door before you left your own party.<eos> But when Iris Lightman told you the name of the monster who had caused you all this grief, it was the final straw.<eos> And you had to know George very well to know that he was Max.<eos> And you did, didn't you, Henry?
I'm one of the few people that can identify him.<eos> Let me be your eyes and ears, my Lord.<eos> You can see yourself out.<eos> I answer to a higher authority than you, Inspector.<eos> Indeed he does.
Yeah, pretty sure the smoke would've got her before the, uh...<eos> So I didn't speak to my father for two years after that.<eos> You held him responsible.<eos> I did.<eos> You still do.
Remember, I am in no pain.<eos> You are my people.<eos> I'm your people.<eos> Do you solemnly swear to tell the truth, so help you God?<eos> Yes, I do.
It's what makes this so sad.<eos> How could they have deliberated for one day?<eos> That makes no sense.<eos> Oh, did you call Gina?<eos> - No, Marva did.
Oh, Billy.<eos> You know me, don't you?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I know you.<eos> I sure do.
I sure do.<eos> And that feels good.<eos> To be known.<eos> But...you think you're the good guy, don't you?<eos> No, Donnie, I don't.
Like an idiot, Stefan didn't renew the minutes on his cell phone.<eos> We'll call you when we connect.<eos> Come on, Bon. I want to beat traffic.<eos> You know where he is.<eos> Yeah, I do, Enzo.
You take me to the Man in the High Castle.<eos> Take me and I can describe it to him frame by frame.<eos> You've got a lot of goddamn nerve. Ask him.<eos> Ask him if he wants to see me.<eos> Already did.
Yeah, I know.<eos> Then you will accept your friend's confession.<eos> Confession?<eos> He confessed?<eos> I did it, okay?
What if...?<eos> What if I could burn our names off the gravestones that Hades made for us, the ones holding us here?<eos> I looked for a spell like that.<eos> It doesn't exist.<eos> Actually, it does.
Why do you defend Rumplestiltskin?<eos> He kidnapped you.<eos> He made you a servant.<eos> You should want him dead, too.<eos> Yeah, well, I don't.
Belle, you can trust me.<eos> All right.<eos> He said that if I let you and Gaston face each other and one of you ends up in the River of Souls, he'll then tear up the contract on our baby.<eos> And you turned him down.<eos> Of course I did.
Oh, no. I've got it.<eos> A.L.I.E.'s gone.<eos> Yeah. I figured.<eos> Clarke, you're not acting like someone who just saved the world.<eos> Because we didn't...
What?<eos> Howie, you forget how much of our early dates involved you doing magic and me doing this.<eos> Fine.<eos> I had reservations about you, too.<eos> No, you didn't.
Howie, you forget how much of our early dates involved you doing magic and me doing this.<eos> Fine.<eos> I had reservations about you, too.<eos> No, you didn't.<eos> No, I didn't.
I'm...<eos> I'm just so cold.<eos> I still love her, you know? I mean, I really love her.<eos> Yo, man, I hate to tell you this, but I got to close up shop.<eos> Sure, of course you do.
- Yeah?<eos> Ruiz hit me up... about that payment.<eos> He ain't never gonna reach his full potential unless we set up a meet, you know, between he and Milan.<eos> You know how that motherfucker is.<eos> Yeah, I do.
Thank you.<eos> My father used to own one just like it... well, for a little while.<eos> Hey, Ruiz...<eos> You know what it's like to be betrayed.<eos> - Yes, I do.
Tommy, I didn't expect to see you back tonight.<eos> What's going on?<eos> A few days ago, you asked me if I was one of you.<eos> I did.<eos> Yeah, you did.
I have no idea.<eos> Regan!<eos> ETU's suddenly a breeding facility.<eos> I didn't see that one coming.<eos> No one did.
My parents are dead, aren't they?<eos> Truth is, we don't know much about anything about... your parents, about you, about any of it.<eos> So you don't know shit.<eos> Not about me.<eos> No one does.
Are they still alive?<eos> The humans know more than I do.<eos> The ETU has more intel on us than they've shared with you.<eos> They know exactly where your parents are, I don't.<eos> Well, who does, Jackson?
- Flynn...<eos> - I know what you are.<eos> I've seen one.<eos> I know what's inside you.<eos> No, you don't.
I love you.<eos> You shouldn't have come looking for me.<eos> Why didn't you tell me the truth?<eos> Think how you would've reacted.<eos> Other Hunters did.
But I refused to come in.<eos> I had a family, you and Emme.<eos> I couldn't imagine living without you even if it meant being someone I never really was.<eos> I wanted you more.<eos> I still do.
I gotta take care of something.<eos> Just a quick work trip.<eos> I'll see you as soon as I get back.<eos> - Flynn, you don't understand.<eos> - I do.
Hunters, are reverting to your alien shells because Musa is planning a nuclear attack, and that's how you'll survive.<eos> You have no idea what you're talking about.<eos> We did well in raising your daughter for you, don't you think?<eos> By turning her against her own kind?<eos> - No. No, I don't.
- I was a child.<eos> A baby!<eos> - That baby would have died anyway.<eos> Its mother was a drunk, living in a slum.<eos> I did it a favor and I did it for you!
Shh.<eos> He saved us at the hotel.<eos> - What were you doing there?<eos> - Trying to help.<eos> And I did.
How primitive.<eos> Yes.<eos> We understand each other.<eos> Not even close.<eos> Oh, but we do.
They do however, help me enter the mind of whoever might have wanted to murder my father.<eos> Not a long walk, I confess.<eos> You going somewhere?<eos> Yeah, do you remember Fiona Helbron?<eos> I do.
I've been, uh, thinking about you.<eos> Spending time with you that day, I enjoyed it.<eos> That doesn't happen very often.<eos> Also, you're very handsome, and you smell nice.<eos> A lot of people don't.
I mean, you're not a little mortified, showing this photo?<eos> Why would I be?<eos> DORFMAN:<eos> As a matter of fact, we, uh, tapped our way into quite a few theater girl" hearts, didn't we?<eos> Yes, we did.
I'm on my way down.<eos> JIMMY:<eos> It was nothing, Doctor.<eos> You would have found it eventually.<eos> But I didn't, Mr. Palmer.
Show off some of those old dance moves?<eos> A little "Can't Touch This."<eos> What's your surveillance situation?<eos> Do you have security cameras?<eos> Of course I do.
I'm sorry I wasn't here to meet you.<eos> I was on a call with a potential investor.<eos> Kickstarter can only take you so far these days.<eos> Did you bring the fragment with the serial and batch numbers?<eos> Uh, yes, I did.
Oh, my goodness.<eos> This piece came from a bulk shipment to a company called Vanderhusen Industries.<eos> All I have listed for them is a P.O. box number.<eos> Do you still think this is connected to your old case?<eos> I do.
Saddle up.<eos> Your partner's gonna meet you at the Cuban Chancellery.<eos> Okay.<eos> You know, today is the last day to sign the boys up for the read-a-thon.<eos> Done.
Right.<eos> Well, then, all of our old plans are scrapped.<eos> We are gonna have to make calls on the fly.<eos> But we have ADA Lambert standing by in case we run into any legal red tape.<eos> Of course we do.
Milly, this is a really bad idea.<eos> How can you prove that this woman even existed?<eos> Grandpa must've hidden her body somewhere.<eos> The police will find it.<eos> Well, what if they don't?
But he loved you more.<eos> At least this way, with the insurance, he could make sure they were properly looked after.<eos> How did you persuade Dr Harris and the undertakers to help you?<eos> Oh, I know all about Dr Harris and his wandering hands.<eos> But his wife doesn't.
Well, it got you out of a sticky situation.<eos> A situation I would not be in were it not for you!<eos> So... did you find out what was in that file?<eos> Yes.<eos> I did.
Any sign of a break-in?<eos> I've got this, Padre.<eos> The house was securely locked from the inside, I made sure of it.<eos> Mr Twyman, do you know of anyone who would want to hurt your son?<eos> Well, do you?
And he's just killed someone else.<eos> Rosie Everton, a local journalist - killed at her piano.<eos> Oh, my dear Lord!<eos> Did you know Rosie?<eos> No, no, I didn't.
But you put profit over safety.<eos> When did Calvin find out?<eos> I... I don't think he did.<eos> Then, why kill him?<eos> I didn't!
Then, confess.<eos> He's the one that has to confess.<eos> That's between him and God.<eos> Vengeance doesn't bring peace.<eos> Then...what does?
Just wait till tomorrow.<eos> That's all I'm asking.<eos> I'll drive you back after the gig at the hotel.<eos> Should you really be letting her do that in here?<eos> Do what?
If he broke in last night, then why did he pick the lock today?<eos> Why not come in the same way?<eos> I can't believe I didn't see it before.<eos> - Didn't see what exactly?<eos> - None of us did.
Caroline, what are you doing?<eos> You're dressed all wrong.<eos> Yours is a "riches to rags" story, a story we'll never sell if you go in there wearing that.<eos> I have a huge hole near the crotch in my panty hose, if that helps.<eos> It doesn't.
Hey, we've got a lady that looks like you at home.<eos> Wow, nice room.<eos> Sophie, what are you doing here?<eos> Well, after Max talked me into not adopting...<eos> - I did?
Drop the gun!<eos> Drop it!<eos> I got a vest on.<eos> Do you? They'll be cleaning you off the walls for a week.<eos> Do it!
Drop it!<eos> I got a vest on.<eos> Do you? They'll be cleaning you off the walls for a week.<eos> Do it!<eos> Do it!
Seeing a lot of Steve these days, huh?<eos> Well, I can't afford a gym membership.<eos> I got to get my cardio in somehow.<eos> - Come on, you like him.<eos> - I do.
You think it's me.<eos> What?<eos> You all think it's me who killed her.<eos> No, no, no, no, no.<eos> No, I don't.
She'd have done anything she could to crush Berenice's hopes.<eos> And you couldn't have that.<eos> Berenice's confidence would never have recovered.<eos> And she deserves the chance to feel good about herself.<eos> We all do.
And you couldn't have that.<eos> Berenice's confidence would never have recovered.<eos> And she deserves the chance to feel good about herself.<eos> We all do.<eos> Well, maybe Mary did, too.
Oh! Sorry.<eos> Bill!<eos> Paul Bladen.<eos> You went out with him last night.<eos> No, I didn't.
And we really like you.<eos> And we were wondering if...<eos> I don't want to have sex with you!<eos> - What? - What?<eos> I do!
Nothing's perfect. Nobody's perfect.<eos> First dates aren't perfect, life is just messy<eos> - and complicated, and...<eos> - Okay, I forgive you.<eos> - You do?
NCIS.<eos> Maybe so, but he's our only link.<eos> That's why I need to talk to Calloway direct.<eos> Find him?<eos> No, but NOPD did.
One interview,<eos> "He's the guy who killed me," case closed.<eos> Castle, I'm guessing that you found out something about your missing time, and that's what you want to catch up with me on. Uh...<eos> Uh, yeah.<eos> Actually, yeah, I did. Um...
This is Captain Beckett.<eos> Captain, I...<eos> You're dismissed, recruit.<eos> That was a little harsh, don't you think?<eos> I do not.
You are not quitting.<eos> I'm unfit to be a cop, Captain.<eos> If you hadn't talked me down back there...<eos> I had every intention of pulling that trigger.<eos> But you didn't.
Oh, oh, my God.<eos> Oh, no, no!<eos> It's good.<eos> One more go, one more go.<eos> - Just do it again.
- Yeah. So, Lulu...<eos> - Pretty full-on, yeah.<eos> - She's trying to piss me off.<eos> She doesn't actually want to have sex with you.<eos> - She does. - She doesn't.
- She's trying to piss me off.<eos> She doesn't actually want to have sex with you.<eos> - She does. - She doesn't.<eos> She does. She doesn't.<eos> - She does.
- She does. - She doesn't.<eos> She does. She doesn't.<eos> - She does.<eos> - I don't have time to do this.<eos> She doesn't.
She does. She doesn't.<eos> - She does.<eos> - I don't have time to do this.<eos> She doesn't.<eos> She doesn't.
- D'accord.<eos> - I mean, I know I shouldn't care, not in this situation, but, I hate my body and I wish I had the sort of body confidence to just drape myself all over everything, but it's just, well,<eos> it's not like I don't think I'm... No.<eos> - You hate your body?<eos> Of course I do.
- I mean, I know I shouldn't care, not in this situation, but, I hate my body and I wish I had the sort of body confidence to just drape myself all over everything, but it's just, well,<eos> it's not like I don't think I'm... No.<eos> - You hate your body?<eos> Of course I do.<eos> Everybody does.
- Get your dick out.<eos> - This isn't quite how...<eos> - Come on, Sam.<eos> - Punch me in the face, fuck me up the arse.<eos> Do it!
And for print, we're using biodegradable ink on 100% recycled, fair-trade paper.<eos> Yes. I like all that.<eos> Tap that.<eos> Uh, don't your people use Tap That?<eos> Of course we do.
Were you hiding from me?<eos> What is it?<eos> If it's something I did or said...<eos> No, oh... oh, my God, you...<eos> you didn't do anything.
Knew to call me first.<eos> Is there anything we should know about what happened to Hal?<eos> Look, Grace, maybe your father and I should...<eos> If this is about Hal and other women, I know.<eos> So does Betty.
You know?<eos> Some lyrics and whatnot.<eos> You understand.<eos> No, yeah, yeah.<eos> I do. I do, for sure.
He didn't care.<eos> I didn't have nothing.<eos> Hey, man, I had to enlist when my dad kicked me out.<eos> That's how bad off I was.<eos> I almost did that.
You pulled my dad out, right?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Well... a lot of people are looking for you.<eos> I don't want to see them.<eos> [somber music] I didn't, either.
Believe me, I've been there.<eos> [stirring music] I'm not trying to tell you how to grieve, okay, but you are gonna lose your job, and if that's what you want, fine.<eos> You can keep pushing everybody away.<eos> But I don't want that to happen to you.<eos> None of us do.
No, we bought those junk boxes because driving around in nice cars got too expensive.<eos> I cannot tell you how many times some feminazi shattered their windshields or keyed their cars.<eos> Forensic evidence shows that Emil was struck multiple times in the head.<eos> Do you know of anyone who threatened him?<eos> As a matter of fact, I do.
It's almost as if he saw the victim as still alive, and... and he became angry, and he had to kill her all over again.<eos> As I said, the evidence thus far is anything but normal.<eos> ♪ Bones 11x13 ♪ The Monster in the Closet Original Air Date on April 28, 2016<eos> You know, Angela can make a digital copy of that if you want to step out of the Stone Age.<eos> No, she already did.
Each is a piece of my soul.<eos> That's what photography is, Angela.<eos> It's finding the truth, the beauty, where you least expect it.<eos> Yeah, but how do you... how do you know where to look?<eos> You don't.
He's paid the price, but you know, he's taking responsibility.<eos> He's reformed.<eos> He deserves a second chance.<eos> And a family.<eos> They both do.
I sees it.<eos> Vermont.<eos> Better than I ever dreamt.<eos> I made it, Philly.<eos> I did it.
And are you missing your sister, Her Majesty, the Queen?<eos> Not quite as much, no.<eos> Why on earth did you say that?<eos> - What?<eos> I did! And I do.
Aye, so?<eos> So each of them are illegally conducting trade in the north in territory granted to the Hudson's Bay Company, just as you are.<eos> The most successful is a man named Peter Carruthers,<eos> Carruthers and Co. You know him?<eos> What if I do?
Stefan...<eos> I mean, not right now, but...<eos> It's complicated?<eos> The thing is, I've just spent the past few days with you learning about how much you hate vampires and what they did to your town.<eos> I do.
Actually, my exact message read:<eos> "She's taken care of."<eos> Yeah, she's taken care of.<eos> What, so you didn't kill her?<eos> I did.
We're not gonna kill anyone, are we?<eos> 'Cause I'd like to know that up front.<eos> Renard is cooperating with Black Claw.<eos> Did he know that Dixon was gonna be assassinated?<eos> Not at the time, but he does now.
She broke every finger on his hand without even touching him, and then he ran away.<eos> She didn't want it to happen, but it did.<eos> She was scared of what you'd do to her.<eos> I told her she had to tell you, Nick.<eos> Well, she didn't.
What?<eos> Changed your mind.<eos> Who told you that?<eos> Guillaume Debailly persuaded you.<eos> He did?
Deep Blue.<eos> The computer that beat Kasparov.<eos> What's this?<eos> You didn't turn them off?<eos> Of course I did.
I still haven't told my father.<eos> He thinks I'm still on a mission.<eos> I've been back for a year and my father doesn't know.<eos> - Your daughter doesn't see him?<eos> - She does.
Guillaume Debailly.<eos> Isn't he here?<eos> "You know your father a little better now.<eos> "I don't know what good that does you.<eos> "Whether it does good or bad.
- And quick.<eos> It's better if we just... get wiped out straightaway than get sick or anything.<eos> You shouldn't have to think like that.<eos> Don't you think about it?<eos> Yeah, I do.
Oh, he's gonna get you.<eos> He's gonna get you!<eos> Oh, ho!<eos> Let me show you how it's done.<eos> Yeah, do.
I made you your favorite: turkey club and curly fries.<eos> And speaking of favorites, I think I'm your mom's new one.<eos> (Giggles) Quick, quick, while she's upstairs, tell me everything.<eos> Does she wanna put me in an ice cream cone and just eat me up?<eos> (Chuckles) She does!
What would make her think that?<eos> I'm rich, you're poor.<eos> Her words, not mine.<eos> Then... you told her I'm not after your money, right?<eos> Of course I did.
You just took a step back.<eos> (Scoffs) No, I didn't.<eos> Get over here.<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> You just did it again but just with your head this time.
Okay, but I still think...<eos> You can just stop.<eos> Of course you dumped our plan to help Karma.<eos> I'm an idiot for even being a little surprised.<eos> I did all that for you.
But... won't that ruin - your chances with Amy?<eos> - I think I'll be okay.<eos> If you don't see me as fully male, then maybe we shouldn't date.<eos> - Let's talk.<eos> - We just did.
- No, I mean... I like Amy.<eos> We have a lot in common.<eos> But she wanted to kiss someone else at midnight, and that's okay.<eos> Because, uh...<eos> I did too.
You did the right thing.<eos> Not for Jack.<eos> Not in time.<eos> Sorry I ruined your birthday.<eos> You didn't.
Whose place is this?<eos> Yours.<eos> Or it will be after you sign the lease.<eos> I don't have any money.<eos> I do.
I'm sorry, ma'am.<eos> Not your call.<eos> There could be a secondary attack.<eos> - Do you really think that might happen?<eos> - It did on 9/11.
- All right.<eos> Bye.<eos> Bye.<eos> Did you call Jane Fellows?<eos> I did.
Bye.<eos> Did you call Jane Fellows?<eos> I did.<eos> I support your decision.<eos> No, you don't.
Sometimes he takes over?<eos> That's why you don't remember things?<eos> I shouldn't have come.<eos> I don't want to talk about this.<eos> Yes, you do.
I know someone is watching me.<eos> I can tell.<eos> On the train, at work, in my apartment.<eos> How do you know?<eos> I just do.
Yeah. Maybe it wasn't such a good idea.<eos> -Do you know what time it is?<eos> -Yeah.<eos> -Time for you to tell me how Curtis died.<eos> -He-he just did!
Abby...<eos> You're a good person.<eos> You're just standing too close to the Oval.<eos> You can feel the power, and you want it.<eos> Everyone does.
When was the last time you asked Huck about Kim and Javi?<eos> Do you think it's cool that not too long ago,<eos> Huck begged me to put a gun to his head and blow his brains out?<eos> I think you know the answer to that.<eos> I really don't.
You know what that is.<eos> I thought I was all fucked up in the head.<eos> I did not want to be gay.<eos> Do you get that, Ray?<eos> Do you?
Remember when we went out to the hot springs in Indio?<eos> Out in the desert?<eos> That was a long time ago.<eos> We got caught fucking in the hot tub, and that guy got really mad.<eos> I do.
Want what?<eos> Sex.<eos> All the time.<eos> Yeah.<eos> After the first few months, yeah, I did.
Your bus is leaving.<eos> Thank you for your cooperation. You ever think about your sister?<eos> Ever see her face?<eos> Like in a dream?<eos> No. I don't.
What?<eos> Like an actual brother?<eos> Sure.<eos> I don't think you do.<eos> - Sure I do.
I'll keep my mouth shut.<eos> Just keep my family out of it.<eos> Do your kids play soccer?<eos> - Can we cut the bullshit?<eos> - Do they?
Just keep my family out of it.<eos> Do your kids play soccer?<eos> - Can we cut the bullshit?<eos> - Do they?<eos> - My son did.
Yeah.<eos> I just want to be with you.<eos> That's it.<eos> Always have.<eos> And still do.
Do you renounce Satan and all his works?<eos> Do you believe in God, the Father, the creator of Heaven and Earth?<eos> I do.<eos> Do you believe in Jesus Christ, his only son, our Lord, who was born of the virgin Mary, suffered death and was buried, rose again from the dead, and is now seated at the right hand of the Father?<eos> I do.
It wasn't.<eos> Radley tried to force himself on her one night at his mansion after a taping.<eos> And she wasn't having any of it, so he lost his shit, and he fucking stabbed her to death.<eos> You got proof?<eos> I do, actually.
You got a body?<eos> Nick Lowell, the agent.<eos> You know him?<eos> - Sure.<eos> - Yeah, of course you do.
Big fat guy, lot of body hair, like a bear.<eos> Do you know what a wolf is?<eos> No.<eos> Sorry.<eos> That one, I don't.
She left me.<eos> She left baby Maria.<eos> And now she's in a fuckin' nuthouse.<eos> I don't know what to do.<eos> Of course you do, son.
She left baby Maria.<eos> And now she's in a fuckin' nuthouse.<eos> I don't know what to do.<eos> Of course you do, son.<eos> Of course you do.
He didn't have to do that.<eos> He didn't have to scare me like that.<eos> Conor...<eos> He thinks I'm an idiot.<eos> - You all do.
He didn't have to scare me like that.<eos> Conor...<eos> He thinks I'm an idiot.<eos> - You all do.<eos> - No, we don't.
Conor...<eos> He thinks I'm an idiot.<eos> - You all do.<eos> - No, we don't.<eos> Yes, you do.
Eight o'clock.<eos> You gonna stay for the rest of the interview?<eos> No.<eos> I'm gonna cry.<eos> I always do with her.
Uh, this is a mind game she's playing.<eos> Unfortunately for her, this mind don't play it.<eos> So you're gonna outsmart her by undersmarting her.<eos> Pretty smart, huh?<eos> You-you did it.
No, uh, I-I don't think that you want to hear about my terrible Valentine's Day experience.<eos> Oh, she didn't like the perfume?<eos> Perfume?<eos> You bought perfume from here.<eos> Yeah, I did.
No, that's the thing.<eos> I don't feel bad.<eos> I always knew there was a part of me that wanted to do this to her for what she did, but...<eos> I figured when the time came, something would stop me...<eos> But it didn't.
Not yet... need a few minutes for the spoof fax to go through.<eos> It needs to propagate through their system.<eos> No one in the world uses fax anymore except cops.<eos> Half of me wants it to be him.<eos> Half of me doesn't.
See, the thing is I don't think would've come to that decision on her own.<eos> I think you saw an opportunity, and you took advantage, much like I'm doing now.<eos> You can't hurt me.<eos> We made a deal, remember?<eos> Oh, I do.
The story stays exactly the same.<eos> Nothing changes.<eos> Nothing changes in the story.<eos> You both realize how fucking important that is, right?<eos> Yes, I do.
What?<eos> No.<eos> No, no, no, I was trying to help.<eos> I-I just wished you would've consulted with me first.<eos> - Well, I didn't.
And I just, I couldn't shake the feeling that the caterer was gouging us,<eos> - so I went to the fish market<eos> - No, you didn't.<eos> - And I priced it myself.<eos> - Yes, I did.
- We can't what?<eos> Tell Moms.<eos> - Why not?<eos> - Because you know why.<eos> No, I don't.
I don't like it-<eos> - I come out here to connect with nature.<eos> Unplug.<eos> You feel me?<eos> Yeah, I do, uh...
So...<eos> I didn't do it for her.<eos> I suppose you want something in return.<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, Miss Skerrett, I do.
Thank you so much for that.<eos> That was chapter three: Acknowledgment.<eos> Wow, uh, you know what this shows me?<eos> That you really want to help yourself.<eos> - I do.
Or any of the 75 other people that were there.<eos> You got to believe me.<eos> Relax.<eos> I do.<eos> You do?
I knew.<eos> I know what you're thinking -- jealous wife kills her cheating husband.<eos> But that couldn't be further from the truth.<eos> I loved Dan.<eos> I still do.
I guess.<eos> Wait a second.<eos> You didn't kiss Staci.<eos> No, of course not.<eos> No, but Dan did.
So why fight it?<eos> Just give in.<eos> Why hurt Melissa?<eos> She only wanted to save her marriage.<eos> They all do.
Nadine must not have given it to her.<eos> That's why I wanted to talk to you, away from your partner.<eos> 'Cause we probably broke some laws trying to get Mateo back.<eos> You didn't.<eos> I did.
I'm very glad to see that you are well and confident.<eos> Good, thanks.<eos> But promises... are just words, Chili.<eos> I'd like to see you succeed here.<eos> I really do.
And don't I, as her doctor, have a moral responsibility that supersedes that document?<eos> No, you do not, and you know that.<eos> Ms. Goodwin, she was out of her mind from the pain and the illness.<eos> She did not understand what this drug could do for her.<eos> - I did.
Or an underwear model.<eos> Can I get you anything?<eos> - You know what a Reuben is?<eos> - Yes.<eos> No, you don't.
Songs are in the book.<eos> Anyone want a cocktail?<eos> - You know how to make a Manhattan?<eos> - Yes.<eos> No, you don't.
Oh, yes.<eos> It was just a false alarm.<eos> Well, then we should probably get back to the theater.<eos> Those pre-movie trivia questions aren't gonna answer themselves, are they? [ Chuckles ]<eos> - Actually, they do.
And they want to exploit his work.<eos> No, because he's a killer.<eos> He killed three people.<eos> You don't know what you're talking about.<eos> Actually, I do.
I never thanked you for helping me out of the void.<eos> Helping you is why I'm here.<eos> Who are you?<eos> I want to tell you.<eos> I really do.
Needed, really.<eos> You think she knows we got him?<eos> Yes.<eos> I believe she does.<eos> They both do.
- OK?<eos> I want to help.<eos> - Well, I'll swing by and make sure that cat of yours is fed.<eos> She doesn't really like men.<eos> Well, who does?
Let's say I was willing to help you.<eos> Those tunnels are of no use to you or anyone.<eos> They were boarded up a long time ago.<eos> - Nobody knows how to find them.<eos> - Well, somebody does.
Is Yiska his real name?<eos> Course not.<eos> He says there are outsiders who don't understand our commune, even fear us.<eos> Fear him.<eos> Do you?
- What did you say?<eos> - Or maybe it's a woman.<eos> - Well, it ain't.<eos> You ever spend any time at war, son?<eos> My father did a long time ago.
[Wynonna] Then you turned 11 and you wanted to practice making out with the gummy bears.<eos> Oh...<eos> And you promised<eos> - to never tell anyone that.<eos> - I never did.
It's OK if you don't like her, you know.<eos> I'm happy she's back, I really am.<eos> It's...<eos> I never really knew her, you know.<eos> Still don't.
Dead and in estate battles over who owns his rights?<eos> Okay, that is going back today.<eos> We are driving you.<eos> (no accent): I swear to God I was not the last person to use the bathroom.<eos> I don't even do that at work, okay?
And that something was another baby.<eos> What about me, Mom?<eos> What was the sign you should have me?<eos> Oh. Remember what that sign was?<eos> I do.
So, uh, you know, after we broke up in therapy,<eos> I wasn't quite sure how things were gonna be between us.<eos> Was it gonna be awkward?<eos> Were you gonna poison my... breakfast?<eos> You didn't, did you?
Wh... uh...<eos> Wait, I mean, let's, uh, let's at least have a drink.<eos> You know, I really wanna make this up to you.<eos> Sure, if that makes you feel better.<eos> It does.
Wait, I mean, let's, uh, let's at least have a drink.<eos> You know, I really wanna make this up to you.<eos> Sure, if that makes you feel better.<eos> It does.<eos> It really does.
Where are the bad feelings?<eos> Where are the bad feelings?<eos> They're gone because you made the greatest amends of all.<eos> You vowed to never hurt me again.<eos> I did?
Wait, you... you seriously did... did not know this?<eos> I...<eos> I...<eos> I...<eos> She did not.
It's not your fault, it's theirs.<eos> Oh, is that so?<eos> Because we wouldn't be here if you'd ripped up that contract when I asked you to.<eos> You didn't have leverage.<eos> And now I do.
You should have let me go in Camelot.<eos> Don't make that mistake again.<eos> I just...<eos> I don't know how to say goodbye.<eos> Well, then don't.
I'll take the "Arlene-ergy."<eos> 'Cause I'm a sucker for advertising.<eos> Is that why you bought that shirt, advertising?<eos> - You don't like my shirt?<eos> - Actually, I do.
- Does the Secret Service or the Chicago PD?<eos> - Not that I know of.<eos> - How about TAPS?<eos> Does they have a steering committee?<eos> Yes, they do.
Then cut the crap.<eos> All right, all right.<eos> Forget I mentioned it.<eos> You know where your partner is, don't you, Officer Abrams?<eos> I do not.
We're gonna have to work on your double negatives, Anthony.<eos> The what?<eos> Nothing.<eos> Absolutely nothing.<eos> You did good.
The what?<eos> Nothing.<eos> Absolutely nothing.<eos> You did good.<eos> I did well.
Turns out if I love someone, I worry about them.<eos> And if someone's gonna stress me out, I'd rather it be my family than you guys.<eos> Did Stan just say he loves us?<eos> He did, Gorney.<eos> He did.
Relax.<eos> Okay?<eos> Karma would not have said that if she didn't want to get back together with you.<eos> The question is, do you want to?<eos> Yeah, part of me does.
NYPD.<eos> Why don't you put your hands up in the air?<eos> Hey, now, what is this?<eos> Nothing happened!<eos> Oh, yeah it did, champ.
Lieutenant.<eos> I know you live to make my life miserable, but J.C., Mary, and Joseph... this?<eos> Look, you didn't have to wake the commissioner up in the middle of the night to tell him that his trusted PR chief is busted for child porn.<eos> Between you and me, I never liked the guy anyway.<eos> No one does.
Uh, he lost blood, but he'll make it.<eos> I found him on the floor of the bathroom.<eos> I... only stopped by the apartment to pick up some things for the kids.<eos> If I hadn't...<eos> But you did.
Martha?<eos> Mm-hmm. Why'd they draw her?<eos> Misunderstanding.<eos> Didn't know we knew her.<eos> Carlotti did this?
What is it?<eos> A body was found in the Potomac.<eos> It's being brought to the lab.<eos> Well, that's not good, because that means the local PD moved the victim from the crime scene, and I know how much you hate that.<eos> I do.
And Buckley was pissed.<eos> Yeah, I mean, he even claimed that she'd made up lies about him just to get the job.<eos> But I can't imagine he would kill her for that.<eos> By any chance, does Buckley drive a white van?<eos> Yeah, he does.
Usually he says, "Do not go in there," but this time he said, "Hey, let's go in here."<eos> How could you do that?<eos> I'm sorry, but you know what it's like when you're with your man and one thing leads to another.<eos> I do know what that's like.<eos> I really do.
Yeah, I wanted to talk to you about this summer.<eos> Your camping trip with your father?<eos> Yeah, see there's this creative writing summer session thing at Oxford<eos> I didn't think I'd get into.<eos> But you did?
We can't do this.<eos> You most certainly can.<eos> We're divers, not doctors.<eos> We don't even know what we're doing.<eos> But I do.
Love can make people do crazy things.<eos> Aw...<eos> Gibbs.<eos> You got me a card.<eos> Yes, I did.
Previously on Hawaii Five-O...<eos> It's not that I don't love you.<eos> I do.
Okay, so what's going on?<eos> Five-O knows about you.<eos> Yeah, well, I suppose that was inevitable.<eos> The important thing is they can't know about you.<eos> They don't.
Does Nick know?<eos> Yes.<eos> Did Adalind tell him?<eos> No.<eos> You did.
All right, look, I'm not saying, but I was supposed to distract you, so do me a favor and act surprised when you go in there, all right?<eos> All right, I got you covered.<eos> And let's just keep it an extra 30 seconds, just to be sure.<eos> No problem.<eos> So my eyes do this thing, huh?
You're looking for microexpressions.<eos> You divided this team when we need to work together.<eos> JJ disobeyed orders by going to you, and now you're withholding.<eos> I didn't divide this team.<eos> You did.
It's nice to get a good laugh in this heat.<eos> I need a laugh.<eos> It's too hot not to laugh.<eos> Lord knows it!<eos> You do.
Housekeeping will take it from here.<eos> Hey, hey! Put some mints on the pillow.<eos> You know, I am getting a little sick of Seely always acting like he's better than us. Yeah.<eos> I mean, just 'cause you get a commendation from the mayor and back-to-back marksmanship awards doesn't mean you're a better cop.<eos> It kind of does.
More what?<eos> More of the secret sauce, as the kids say.<eos> Kids don't say that, Grandpa.<eos> Oh, I thought they did.<eos> Some do.
Babysitting punks like Marcus?<eos> Mentoring rookies, like me, and yeah, some like Marcus.<eos> Most rookies have a sense of respect for the job.<eos> You did.<eos> Well... maybe Marcus does, too, in his own way.
Hey, uh, by the way, it'd be great if you could come by the house on Saturday, too.<eos> Might help the adoption lady to see how diverse my friends are.<eos> Diverse?<eos> Come on, you know what I mean?<eos> I certainly do.
Okay, we need to go at least two feet deep.<eos> Then we bury St. William and we don't dig him up until he gives us a child.<eos> Are you sure this is sanctioned by the Church?<eos> Well, anything goes with that new Pope, but, you know, they bury St. Joseph when they want to sell their house, so this just makes sense.<eos> Yeah, yeah, it kind of does.
I mean I think I paraphrased a little bit but you guys get the gist.<eos> Why is Danny being so mean?<eos> How do you not get this?<eos> Don't you remember when you first met?<eos> Of course I do.
Help yourself.<eos> He didn't have a computer, though.<eos> He just used his phone for everything.<eos> - Where did he work?<eos> - He didn't.
Yeah, about that.<eos> There you are.<eos> Hey, check out the sky.<eos> The bartender has a theory.<eos> Of course he does.
She could have done it.<eos> That's...<eos> That's the equation for power lost during the transmission of electricity.<eos> I wanted to see how far a power surge could travel.<eos> - Of course, you did.
- Her?<eos> - No.<eos> He must be connected to someone inside the NSA.<eos> How were you able to lie to me so completely?<eos> I didn't!
- Is that important to you, Having your relationship described as normal?<eos> - No, no, I just don't think that we are abnormal.<eos> Yes, we're close, but we had to be.<eos> You know my father died, right?<eos> - I do.
Nice and clean.<eos> Yes.<eos> Who's my perfect boy?<eos> I love you.<eos> Yes, I do,
Well, I get my share of the runoff.<eos> Why, what is she saying?<eos> Bobby told us you walked in on 'em.<eos> Yeah, I mean, I went looking for him, and I saw that he was busy, and she invited me to stay.<eos> She did?
- What?<eos> No. No, not at all.<eos> 'Cause you do know that these two guys are guilty, including your dad's friend Bobby.<eos> You think I'm a daddy's boy.<eos> No, I don't.
Yet you hurt everyone.<eos> You... you may not understand, and you may not believe me, detective, but I love both my families very much.<eos> Must have been difficult living two lives.<eos> The fact that you got away with it for so long makes me wonder what you would have done if Kate found out.<eos> - But she didn't.
Our father used our mother's trust to build the firm, so since he married Corinne first...<eos> Which makes us bastards, by the way.<eos> He wasn't legally married to Mom, so he wasn't entitled to her money.<eos> The thing is, he doesn't matter anymore.<eos> You do.
First thing up is our intake with the new couple. The, uh, the Buckseys, but even before that we have a meeting with our attorney um, in the... well, in our pandering case.<eos> I say we meaning Mrs. Johnson and myself, but, well, I'd like you to be there as well.<eos> Of course, Dr. Masters.<eos> If you want me there, I'm there.<eos> I do.
So you come all this way to St. Louis to clean up after him, to tell his lover to back off?<eos> Someone had to.<eos> All for someone who lies to you, who, uh... disregards you? Who ultimately cannot love you.<eos> Can you possibly hate yourself that much?<eos> Sometimes I do.
There's something waiting for you at your doorstep.<eos> When you go home and see what it is, you'll know I am.<eos> More midnight graffiti?<eos> Sorry, didn't mean to wake you.<eos> Oh, you didn't.
In 12 hours,<eos> Hopper is going to be moved.<eos> Does he pose an imminent threat of violence against the United States?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - He does.
Mm-hmm. It's top secret.<eos> So, it's been fun here, huh?<eos> Yeah, a gender war.<eos> Jason, do you have a minute?<eos> I do.
And that's my problem.<eos> No.<eos> My problem too.<eos> - He accepts it.<eos> - No, he doesn't.
Where there's a paper trail, there's Thomas Shaw to light it on fire and burn us alive.<eos> That's a little melodramatic, Robert. - Yeah?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> You think?<eos> 'Cause I don't.
Brought us out of the Cold War, strong ties to the China, managed to stay friends with Germany even after the NSA shit.<eos> Now the Shaw leaks.<eos> Well, sounds to me like someone sees an opening.<eos> Yeah, Chris.<eos> I do.
_<eos> _<eos> _<eos> I noticed you served in the same capacity under Steven Frost in his last posting... COS Vienna.<eos> Yes, I did.
Well, my company has just been hired to safeguard the servers for the newspaper that publishes that shit.<eos> - What does that mean?<eos> - No hacker or government will be able to spy on the Berliner Zeitung.<eos> Does the Zeitung think they're being watched?<eos> Of course they do.
My loyalties are not for sale.<eos> Should be.<eos> Neither Steven Frost nor the Agency grant you the respect you deserve.<eos> They don't see your full potential.<eos> We do.
I'll assume you said something snarky in return.<eos> Of course I did.<eos> Hey.<eos> You love him?<eos> Of course I do.
Why should I?<eos> Because we knew from the beginning we were sending him back.<eos> It's a job.<eos> Doesn't relieve you of the guilt.<eos> It does for me.
Feeding me childhood secrets in the hopes of what?<eos> Working me?<eos> You still don't trust me.<eos> No.<eos> I-I don't.
That's good news.<eos> Kelly... they call that kind of blockage a "widow-maker."<eos> If they hadn't found it,<eos> Eddie could've been dead within a week.<eos> They did.
Like, literally?<eos> Of course, I couldn't have orchestrated all of this without the lovely, talented Simmons here.<eos> She, um -- she hates you, B-T-Dubs.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I really do.
Of course, I couldn't have orchestrated all of this without the lovely, talented Simmons here.<eos> She, um -- she hates you, B-T-Dubs.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I really do.<eos> Yeah, they all do.
I just thought he was old-fashioned.<eos> On our wedding night, he, uh... he got real tense.<eos> Didn't wanna kiss me.<eos> He just asked me to close my eyes.<eos> So I did.
All right.<eos> - Mr. Amberson?<eos> - Yes, ma'am.<eos> I don't know how to say this, but I had a feeling that something terrible could've happened today.<eos> Thanks to you, it didn't.
So many accomplishments, and still just 32 years old.<eos> Fantastico!<eos> Wow. Ay, caramba!<eos> You don't have any contacts, do you?<eos> Of course I do.
Hey, bro, so I've been thinking about our conversation, and you gotta stop worrying about it.<eos> I'm sure Riley's not having any second thoughts.<eos> Second thoughts.<eos> Who said anything about second thoughts?<eos> Well, you just did, for one.
It's okay, I'm your brother.<eos> So what if this move is too much, too soon.<eos> Too much, too soon?<eos> Who said that?<eos> Well, you just did, for one.
Yeah, real bad.<eos> - I know.<eos> - No, no, you don't know.<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> - You don't.
Because he's connected to Daniel Stinger.<eos> And Maggie wanted me to find out what information I could get on him.<eos> I suppose she didn't want you telling me.<eos> No, I wasn't allowed to tell anyone.<eos> So, I didn't.
Is that okay?<eos> Don't even think about it. But, Dad,<eos> I haven't even heard what happened.<eos> D-Do you want to tell me, maybe?<eos> I do.
I don't think he knew.<eos> Wait.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> You can't know that already.<eos> Well, I do.
They caught up on Scandal.<eos> Honestly, I'm glad Olivia's done with Fitz.<eos> Oh, my God, I knew it.<eos> - You kept watching without me.<eos> You did! - No, I, no, I didn't...
Ah, yes, you'll recall this happened last year.<eos> Even my masseuse has a manuscript.<eos> - Oh, no, no, I'm not...<eos> - You don't want me to read that?<eos> Well, I-I do...
I love you.<eos> - But, see, I don't believe you.<eos> - What?<eos> It doesn't feel the same, like you love me like that.<eos> - But I do.
I didn't want you to go chasing after him.<eos> I wasn't gonna go chasing after him.<eos> Didn't mean it like that.<eos> I know.<eos> Or maybe I did.
- It's over.<eos> You did it.<eos> You did it.<eos> I'm sorry I called you all those horrible names.<eos> - You didn't.
Hello.<eos> I've got something here.<eos> Do you have an evidence collection kit in your car?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, I do.
The Chief Inspector hated the idea.<eos> He thought it was too risky.<eos> And I went above his head to push it through.<eos> I just... I thought we'd catch him.<eos> You almost did.
Evie, this isn't available, it's a cupcake shop.<eos> Unless those two girls finally gave up.<eos> I've decided to let you expand.<eos> Evie convinced me to do things outside my comfort zone.<eos> - Yes, I did.
Got to meet a few nice people along the way. Yeah.<eos> Plus, we got to travel the world.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Do you remember our train ride to Austria?<eos> Oh, yes, I do.
I lied.<eos> Why don't you just ask your parents for the money?<eos> - You want me to ask them?<eos> - No.<eos> No, I don't.
Why don't you just ask your parents for the money?<eos> - You want me to ask them?<eos> - No.<eos> No, I don't.<eos> I absolutely do not.
Could be.<eos> Something was going on that night.<eos> When this first started, Marco...<eos> I know you think that I was playing politics.<eos> I did, not anymore.
- I don't know.<eos> She wants us to come over there.<eos> Well, that's interesting.<eos> Why didn't my dad ask them for help?<eos> He did, a bunch of times.
My nephew in Long Point is getting married.<eos> Kid's not much into boats, so I figured this would jump-start his interest.<eos> You think?<eos> I guess you vetted me pretty good before I came out here, huh?<eos> Yes, I did.
- Mom.<eos> Look, if this is some sort of apology... it's just a little late.<eos> Just let her talk.<eos> I wish I could go back and change our history, but life doesn't work like that.<eos> Nope, it doesn't.
They want you.<eos> They're lucky if anyone in this department talks to 'em after that hack job they did on excessive force in the NYPD.<eos> That was a different reporter.<eos> And I wasn't aware that you read The Times.<eos> I do.
The moment someone tells me I can't is the moment I'm out of here.<eos> There's no doubt that poor and minority neighborhoods are being singled out in the enforcement of minor offenses.<eos> Only because that's where most of the offenses occur.<eos> But you can't say that.<eos> I just did.
I bet you get a lot of great power naps on this bad boy.<eos> Look, Regina, I know that we haven't always agreed in the past...<eos> We have never agreed about anything in the past.<eos> The point is I've always respected your opinion, and I hope you can respect mine.<eos> Oh, I do.
Lock him up for harassment.<eos> Maybe this'll teach him a lesson.<eos> I doubt it.<eos> Would it kill you to hold back a little just once?<eos> I did!
That's a total violation of her privacy.<eos> Hmm, well, then I guess you aren't interested in Amy's analysis of your daddy issues.<eos> Please.<eos> Amy didn't write about that.<eos> Or did she, Show Pony?
You saved me from the rat.<eos> I saved myself.<eos> I don't exactly love them.<eos> Liam told me that you didn't kiss Zita.<eos> I really didn't.
- Particularly your cousin Brenda, who I know you're close to.<eos> - Okay, sure.<eos> - So your Aunt Sylvia, um... - she has breast cancer.<eos> - Yeah, I know that.<eos> - You do?
Listen. I love your dad very deeply and I work hard to make sure that our marriage is strong and our love life is spicy.<eos> And I don't feel like I should have to apologize for that.<eos> I-I am, however, very sorry that you had to know that Mommy does those things to Daddy.<eos> Heather!<eos> Daddy does those things to Mommy.
I broke up with him.<eos> - What's that?<eos> - Shut the front door.<eos> You just said you missed him.<eos> I do.
This is not a lecture.<eos> Dad is holding out hope.<eos> He thinks you might change your mind.<eos> About kids.<eos> He does?
We can't do this anymore...<eos> Act like we didn't break up, because... we're really just putting off the inevitable.<eos> I'm not gonna change my mind about having kids.<eos> Jane told you?<eos> Yeah, she did.
I'd be happy to.<eos> It's from... your early years as a criminal mastermind.<eos> When you and James Lam were arrested for extortion.<eos> Only, Lam never went to prison.<eos> And you did.
Dylan, I'm... I'm glad.<eos> You are?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, I-I get it, the... the two of you.<eos> I-I really do.
Remember, you're just watching.<eos> You can get up and leave anytime you like.<eos> I'm right here, Norman.<eos> I thought you didn't want to be seen with me.<eos> I don't.
We drop him in, and then, boom, we seal it closed.<eos> What I mean is, we shouldn't do this.<eos> Hiccup, the Skrill hunted you and Toothless.<eos> - It wanted to kill you.<eos> - But it didn't.
"So I'm thinking about coming over to paint the wainscoting "in the dining room tomorrow, it's peeling.<eos> So is around 11:00 in the morning okay for you?"<eos> And see, here's the- The thing is, he never did that.<eos> He never called before, he just comes over.<eos> He never did that.
Yeah, I remember that.<eos> - This doesn't bother you to hear about this?<eos> - No, it's helping me.<eos> I think it's- - Did you forgive me or- - No.<eos> No, I never did.
Just because you pull out doesn't mean that you weren't- that you were never there.<eos> - Boy, you really have a skill at justifying horrible things.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - I don't know what to do.<eos> - No, you don't.
But you're not thinking straight.<eos> Is that you th... is that what you all think?<eos> Emma.<eos> We still don't know how to stop Hades.<eos> Until we do...
She doesn't think you deserve to be happy.<eos> Look at this office.<eos> Look at this town.<eos> This all belonged to her when you had nothing, remember?<eos> Of course I do!
Emma did exactly what she needed to.<eos> How do you know?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I just...<eos> I do.
- Good news.<eos> - We could use some.<eos> - I was able to contact Maurice Owens.<eos> Know of him?<eos> - I do.
- No, this is the best I got. So, based on this video, we're either looking for a human being or a yeti.<eos> I don't know.<eos> - Run it through face recognition.<eos> Maybe something will pop. - Where are we at with this new Bryan Johnson?<eos> - Beat cops did a sneak-a-peek at his residence.
That's what he said to me.<eos> With a smile on his face.<eos> Was it this man who said it?<eos> No.<eos> The one doing all the talking.
What you said yesterday, about me dropping in just when you... start feeling whole again.<eos> And what about it?<eos> I know that feeling.<eos> The not feeling whole part.<eos> Do you?
He said, "It must have been the Israelis who made a change in the code that enabled it to get out."<eos> Richard Clarke:<eos> President Obama said to the senior leadership,<eos> "You told me it wouldn't get out of the network.<eos> It did.
President Obama said to the senior leadership,<eos> "You told me it wouldn't get out of the network.<eos> It did.<eos> You told me the Iranians would never figure out it was the United States.<eos> They did.
Do we think that this was a nation-state actor and that there are a limited number of nation-states that have such advanced capacity?<eos> Gibney:<eos> Sean McGurk, the director of cyber for the Department of Homeland Security, testified before the senate about how he thought Stuxnet was a terrifying threat to the United States.<eos> Is that not a problem?<eos> I don't... and... and how...
According to the officials,<eos> Iran is the first country ever in the Middle East to actually be engaged in a cyber war with the United States and Israel.<eos> If anything they said the recent cyber attacks were what encouraged them to plan to set up the cyber army, which will gather computer scientists, programmers, software engineers...<eos> If you are a youth and you see assassination of a nuclear scientist, your nuclear facilities are getting attacked, wouldn't you join your national cyber army?<eos> Well, many did.
At least turn it down!<eos> - Did my boxes get here?<eos> - Behind the rack.<eos> Great!<eos> So, you finally did it, huh?
- Bye-bye, Brooklyn.<eos> This box is open.<eos> - Damn that TSA! - Really?<eos> You went through my stuff?<eos> I did.
It's okay.<eos> I have a lot of irons in the fire.<eos> I'm still getting a lot of good responses from the New Yorker piece so...<eos> Did I tell you that I attacked Gail Collins?<eos> - You did not.
Well, he's not new.<eos> We've been going out about two years.<eos> - Really?<eos> I must meet him.<eos> - Oh, you did.
And he came and measured the space?<eos> - Who?<eos> - Mario Andretti?<eos> Marco Toretti.<eos> Yes, he did.
Just please, don't let this be the only thing you remember to say at my funeral!<eos> So...<eos> Yes?<eos> Did I tell you what happened at the funeral after you left?<eos> Why, no, you didn't.
So...<eos> Yes?<eos> Did I tell you what happened at the funeral after you left?<eos> Why, no, you didn't.<eos> Because something did.
- and I don't want another picture window. - What?<eos> When we remodeled the house, you wanted a picture window, but it looked weird with the other windows and so you gave it up.<eos> You settled.<eos> I do not remember wanting a picture window.<eos> Well, you did.
- Oh, I think I win.<eos> - I don't know.<eos> I really like these pants, so...<eos> - I'm glad it went well.<eos> - It did.
It could be great, and you deserve that.<eos> I do.<eos> I do deserve that.<eos> Did I tell you she lost her shoes at the club?<eos> - You did not.
I even slipped notes under your door at night.<eos> Which I turned over to the FBI.<eos> I know for a fact that you have had septic tank issues.<eos> Taylor, do you see people in here trying to eat?<eos> I do.
- Start with the house.<eos> I'm decluttering my life.<eos> - You know Marie Kondo?<eos> - No.<eos> - You don't?
I bought a notebook so I can write down things I want to discuss with her.<eos> - That way I won't forget.<eos> - Very sensible.<eos> I told her it was your idea that I come see her.<eos> You did?
- That way I won't forget.<eos> - Very sensible.<eos> I told her it was your idea that I come see her.<eos> You did?<eos> I did.
- Yes, we're better than the Cheshire Cat.<eos> - We are better, but they have suites.<eos> Big, comfy suites with soaking tubs and mini-fridges.<eos> - We hate mini-fridges.<eos> - Of course we do.
You see, I don't think you have the humor to do this book.<eos> You don't get nuance.<eos> No, I get nuance.<eos> And you flat out dismissed my whale and mouse story.<eos> No, I didn't.
I had a moment. I thought I'd check in. How's my little alumnus doing?<eos> Great.<eos> It's fun being back here, and weird.<eos> - The headmaster says hi.<eos> - No, he doesn't.
Hemlines shortened to just below the hoo-ha?<eos> Should I get the nurse?<eos> Or are you and Rory in cahoots again, planning a get-together behind my back?<eos> Is that why you didn't want to get lunch?<eos> I did.
There could be something in, um, girls who go to Comic-Con type things and sleep with characters.<eos> Character-loving girls.<eos> That sounds obscure.<eos> Very made-up.<eos> Yes, it does.
No strings attached.<eos> I think your days of rescuing me are over.<eos> You never needed rescuing, Ace.<eos> You know that.<eos> I do now.
And... I don't know why, but I walked up the hill and there was this vista, and suddenly something became completely clear to me.<eos> - Luke...<eos> - Stop!<eos> - I know what you're doing.<eos> - You do?
Renford seems like a new man since you two tied the knot.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I think it's the juicing.<eos> And now you want to become a member of the DAR.<eos> I do.
That's them there.<eos> So dig out your shoes and ball, 'cause tomorrow you're all goin' bowlin'.<eos> I don't have a ball or shoes.<eos> Did you know about the Thirtysomething Gang?<eos> Yeah, everyone does.
- Oh, getting better. Hmm.<eos> - Lorelai.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> Did you know I just celebrated a birthday?<eos> - Of course I did.
We're not the ones asking the question, Your Honor.<eos> The jury is.<eos> They obviously have some probative value.<eos> Well, first of all, do we even know what this "inaudible noise" was?<eos> We do. Okay.
So, tell us, what did happen?<eos> At first, I was only meant to take one coin as a souvenir for the first dive.<eos> Right, let's count this lot.<eos> 'I didn't think anyone would notice.'<eos> And when they didn't...
We have Marigolds.<eos> And there are additional cleaning accoutrements in the kitchen, should you require them.<eos> But, Chief, do you not think that as I organised the stag party, I should maybe be exempt from cleaning it up?<eos> With respect, Dwayne...<eos> I do not.
But Don, oh!<eos> He said a funny, funny thing.<eos> You remember it?<eos> No.<eos> Oh, sure you do.
I'll make some calls.<eos> But Jake's parents are scared and worried.<eos> They don't know any more than we do.<eos> And you believe them?<eos> Yes, I do.
- We know that Ainge is behind the whole thing.<eos> - Well, that's a very compelling allegation, but I'm sorry, I'm not prosecuting based on this.<eos> Ainge gets to go back to club life like nothing ever happened?<eos> - No.<eos> He doesn't.
But there's a lot of work to do.<eos> - Of course.<eos> - A lot.<eos> - Of course.<eos> - A lot of work to do.
- Oh, okay.<eos> Well, I can tell you from experience, it is always exactly the same.<eos> - Well-- - Every single stage.<eos> Did he paint f-holes on your back?<eos> - Yes, he did.
I feel like I'm 13 years old at Missy Trayman's house when her dad passed out drunk and we got to stay up till dawn.<eos> Now that I think about it, Missy had a pretty sad childhood.<eos> Okay.<eos> You said you had something.<eos> I do.
So... how do you jump from that to "Want to grab a drink sometime?"<eos> I'm the last guy you want to take advice on women from.<eos> So what now?<eos> She had a case for self-defense.<eos> She still does.
You're in danger!<eos> Ma'am, I need to talk to Kayla.<eos> You need to talk to me, Brandon.<eos> You don't understand.<eos> I do.
We need to check Kayla out.<eos> That's just what we do.<eos> We need to look into her personal computer.<eos> No, we don't.<eos> 'Cause I already did.
- Right.<eos> You think this is the worst of Jason? No.<eos> I didn't say that.<eos> He didn't promise you anything, right?<eos> He didn't, did he?
So, members of the grand jury, please refrain from any such judgment.<eos> Now I'd like to turn to our first question.<eos> Mrs. Florrick, did your husband ever make a deal with Lloyd Garber to have his son released in trade for political contributions? No.<eos> Mrs. Florrick, just to be clear, you answered that question.<eos> Yes, I did.
So, I have to ask...<eos> Did Diane approach you about making this an all-female firm, pushing me out?<eos> - Did Diane?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> No, she didn't.
Or mother lust.<eos> You cannot let this go unpunished.<eos> There are punishments far worse than death.<eos> Trust me.<eos> I did.
And that's a hard number; there won't be any pleading it down.<eos> It's up to you, Tyrell.<eos> None of y'all know me.<eos> None of y'al know where I've been or where I'm going.<eos> Yeah, we do.
But hold the egg.<eos> That sounds gross.<eos> And the thyme.<eos> Do you know what?<eos> Just do the tomato one!
Sure, we could do that.<eos> Or we could just pretend you never found this.<eos> Fine.<eos> But my dad wants to know what happened during his missing time.<eos> Of course he does.
Our lost weekend.<eos> Good.<eos> I needed to clear my head.<eos> And we didn't even drink.<eos> We didn't.
That's the real problem.<eos> No, Alex. The real problem is I didn't play Richmond's game all the time.<eos> Oh, Tom, come on!<eos> It's called politics.<eos> - And maybe if you did...
I don't want to lose you, Dr. Edwards.<eos> I don't want to leave here and have you not care about me.<eos> But don't you think that it's possible that I might make even more progress if I'm near the person who makes me feel complete and whole and safe?<eos> With you, and with her, I really think that I can get better. I...<eos> I really, really do.
- What?<eos> I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> You said... you...<eos> Did you say you were a unicorn? I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> You did!
Warm air.<eos> I can feel warm air in the house.<eos> You got it working.<eos> Yes.<eos> - I did.
- Are you serious?<eos> - Mm-hmm.<eos> - You really want to do it? - Yeah. Yeah.<eos> I do.<eos> I really do.
You want me to say it?<eos> What are you gonna do when this Mike guy gets back from New York and says to these two, "Hey, guess who isn't married to Dan Logan."<eos> She thinks I don't know where they're coming from. Oh.<eos> Like a person could actually just, in the course of their normal life, bump into that many people who make balloon animals.<eos> Do you?

Oh.<eos> Like a person could actually just, in the course of their normal life, bump into that many people who make balloon animals.<eos> Do you?<eos> Well, do you?
I'm sorry you were disappointed.<eos> I wasn't.<eos> That's my point.<eos> I didn't know enough to be disappointed.<eos> But you did.
- Are you married?<eos> - I was married for 26 years.<eos> Now I'm divorced.<eos> Potential Juror number 11, before your divorce, did you and your husband ever seek any kind of counseling or therapy?<eos> Yes, we did.
A white wine, please, and for the lady...<eos> A white wine as well.<eos> Our lawyer, Bram Keller... He thinks that this trial could be as important as Scopes.<eos> Didn't Scopes lose?<eos> He did. Yes.
Aren't you a little bit curious?<eos> All right.<eos> One puff.<eos> I believe they call it a hit.<eos> Do they?
- It wasn't a sacrifice.<eos> - Bill...<eos> It wasn't.<eos> I did not do this for you or Libby or anyone else.<eos> I did it for myself.
Virginia...<eos> I should have called first.<eos> I know.<eos> Did I leave something at the office?<eos> Did you...?
We went to bed together.<eos> And by "went to bed together," do you mean that we had sex?<eos> Did we have sex, Art?<eos> Any sort of physical contact at all?<eos> We did not.
You should have left that party as soon as you knew what it was.<eos> Instead, you spend the night with an employee, in his bed.<eos> Regardless of what actually happened in that room, you put your reputation and the reputation of the clinic at risk.<eos> But I suspect you already know that.<eos> I do, yes.
Strolling.<eos> Like that?<eos> Does it make you uncomfortable?<eos> No.<eos> No, it doesn't.
- But-but we-we just thought...<eos> - Don't!<eos> Ever!<eos> Think!<eos> I do the thinking... for all of us.
We didn't trust each other and now look what I done!<eos> Put down the knife!<eos> The heir's gonna help us!<eos> I do know the numbers.<eos> 'Least, I did!
Ever since you two had sex, Virginia, you have completely and irrevocably turned on me.<eos> Could you ask Art to come in here, please?<eos> Did we have sex, Art?<eos> Any sort of physical contact at all?<eos> We did not.
Say "apple pie al a mod-y."<eos> Oh, my God, you're--you are still holding on to that.<eos> I--what can I say?<eos> I didn't speak French. I was trying to impress you.<eos> Oh, you did.
She's a world-class gymnast.<eos> I could get used to this.<eos> Mrs. Lavery just sat there as he took the Irish Setter, both cars, the house on Long Island... everything.<eos> I was itching to just dramatically bang on the table or something.<eos> Why didn't you?
I didn't get it.<eos> And I didn't understand what I had done.<eos> Why you pulled away.<eos> Well, I-I was waiting for you to say... uh, something.<eos> And when you... when you didn't...
And here I... I wanted to take your breath away.<eos> As if I still could.<eos> Oh, I'm sure you take your husband's breath away.<eos> Oh, he-he doesn't look at me.<eos> Or he does.
How do I do that?<eos> I put this man in a wheelchair for the rest of his life, and then I just walk out the door?<eos> You're asking me to trade one form of punishment for another.<eos> How do you know it would be any worse than what you have now?<eos> I don't.

This whole time, you've-you've loved her?<eos> I did.<eos> How could you do that?<eos> Look, what you have to understand is that the last thing I wanted was to hurt your mother.<eos> But you did.
It's far from it.<eos> I have made many mistakes, but that doesn't mean there isn't love in it.<eos> I love you... and Jenny and Howie.<eos> And I did love your mother.<eos> I still do.
Virginia Johnson, will you have this man, William Masters, to be thy wedded husband?<eos> Will you love him, honor him, keep him in sickness and in health, forsaking all others, so long as you both shall live?<eos> I will.<eos> Do you pledge to remember that love, trust, and loyalty alone will prevail as the foundation for a happy and enduring home, which will be full of joy and will abide in peace?<eos> We do.

The full moon is tonight.<eos> At exactly 10:36 pm, which means we have less than 5 hours.<eos> The unsub's gonna kill those kids.<eos> We have no idea where he is.<eos> Antonia does.
I still think - I should wait until next year to apply for the grant.<eos> Why?<eos> You're eligible now.<eos> Technically, but they always give the grant to a senior resident anyway.<eos> Except for when they don't.
This wasn't my fault.<eos> Telling the mother.<eos> Stress doesn't just cause arteries to rupture.<eos> - You know that.<eos> - I do.
But it was your story, not theirs, and stop trying to make it theirs.<eos> I don't have a choice, Richard.<eos> The woman I married... believed in second chances... that anything was possible... and that the glass doesn't always have to be half empty.<eos> And you said your ex-husband didn't know the woman he married.<eos> Well, I do.
Listen, what I said before, that was just me being...<eos> Insecure.<eos> I deserve that.<eos> You could have said a lot worse.<eos> I did... earlier.
You can't do it, and I won't let you.<eos> Benjamin Warren!<eos> Miranda Bailey.<eos> You didn't submit your application for the Preminger Grant!<eos> No. Of course I didn't.
Call me by my first name:<eos> Hwang.<eos> Your names is Hwang Hwang?<eos> Oh, you think that's funny?<eos> So did Kim.
- That's not what I was doing.<eos> - I just want to know when it happened.<eos> When did you decide that you were done?<eos> - She didn't say that.<eos> - Yeah, she did.
You're gonna say "You love me, but"!<eos> You don't know what I'm going to say!<eos> - Oh, I'm pretty sure I do.<eos> - It doesn't matter!<eos> You don't!
And what I want...<eos> What?<eos> I want you.<eos> You guys had sex.<eos> Yeah, we did, too.
We're okay.<eos> I had a gun pointed at me.<eos> I know. I know.<eos> My life flashed before my eyes.<eos> - It... it... it really did.
- So you're, like, born to the throne.<eos> You know what?<eos> I wouldn't...<eos> Do you know a Catherine Avery, the urologist?<eos> I do, actually.
Actually, things are more expensive out here.<eos> I might need to look into that.<eos> My point was, you'd use your dominant hand.<eos> So why would Alvarez shoot himself with his right hand if he was lefty?<eos> Maybe he didn't.
- He had a tattoo. - Mm-hmm.<eos> Tell him, tell him what the ta...<eos> Uh, he had a... a skull tattoo on the side of his neck, which I associated with a cartel in Juarez.<eos> Right, so he questioned him.<eos> - I did.
No. Not tonight.<eos> But you want to.<eos> For real.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I do.
What are you doing out here?<eos> Oh, he just dropped this off and then he was leaving.<eos> Well, did you invite him in?<eos> - No, 'cause he's...<eos> - No, he did not.
That's awesome.<eos> All right, hey, listen, is anyone gonna eat this last Eggo?<eos> Oh, I was actually eyeing it. Wait a minute.<eos> You don't believe me, do you?<eos> What... no... sure, no, sure I do.
- You caught me on the right day.<eos> - Don't tell me;<eos> I don't want to know anything about it.<eos> - I realize this is a very uncomfortable situation, really.<eos> - Do you?
- Please. Please.<eos> Okay, you know, sometimes the guidance counselors at these schools have their fingers on the pulse of what's going on.<eos> Are you saying we should be talking to Father Eugene?<eos> What, you know him?<eos> Yes, we do.
I know I've put a heavy burden on you, but I have faith that the D.A.'s office will do the right thing.<eos> - Of course.<eos> - Please, this has to end.<eos> I want to spare these girls any more exploitation.<eos> We all do.
Too dangerous.<eos> - You're here early.<eos> - Been here all night.<eos> - I thought you had a date.<eos> - I did.
- No. - It'll be all right.<eos> Pam?<eos> Oh. [chuckles] Here you are.<eos> I wasn't aware that we had an appointment.<eos> We don't.
What about her?<eos> She said she was in Hawaii, when they took us.<eos> Some of them came here on their own, you know.<eos> People who believed.<eos> And what about the ones who didn't?
Kerry.<eos> If she does control them, is killing her a risk you wanna take?<eos> I don't have an answer yet for what will end this war, but eliminating what I believe is a crucial piece of it, is not what I would advise.<eos> Or do my words not hold any weight for you any more?<eos> Of course, they do.
Which we hope will work.<eos> There are no guarantees in this life.<eos> You're a surgeon, you know this.<eos> L've had lives in my hands, held a human heart beating.<eos> Did one earlier today, as a matter of fact.
Come on.<eos> Thank you, Dr. Yedlin.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Still don't know why you did that.<eos> I don't either.
We managed - we struggled on for 11 years after she was taken.<eos> What were we doing, just fooling ourselves that it could all just go back to how it was before she went?<eos> We got through it then because I loved you.<eos> You and Matthew and Alice...<eos> and I still do.
Alice's parents - they just accept it? Does she seem... different to you?<eos> Was there a yellow van mentioned in Alice's abduction?<eos> That was the only clue we had in Sophie's case.<eos> I can't keep coming round.<eos> Then don't.
Did Adam Gettrick ever come to the shop?<eos> Er, yes.<eos> Sometimes, I suppose.<eos> He would have known your husband's hobby. Bird-watching.<eos> Most people did.
OK.<eos> - OK, I won't tell her.<eos> How many times I have to tell you I don't blame you for what happened to Alice.<eos> - Dad...<eos> - But I do.
What's wrong, Matty?<eos> That French detective came to my house.<eos> He reckons the guy that used to run the Army garrison has something to do with my sister's disappearance.<eos> - You believe this? - I don't know.<eos> But my mum does.
That French detective came to my house.<eos> He reckons the guy that used to run the Army garrison has something to do with my sister's disappearance.<eos> - You believe this? - I don't know.<eos> But my mum does.<eos> And the French cop does.
But that coil inside stays just as tight, Doc.<eos> What if her suffering wasn't just a gunshot away?<eos> What if you could make it last?<eos> You got a better idea?<eos> Yeah, actually, I do.
But, well, it's not so easy to be brazen when the thing that you want, that scares you to death,<eos> is sitting right in front of you.<eos> I scare you?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, you do.
Because I don't wanna be friends.<eos> When I think about what I wanna do most in this world... it's you.<eos> Oh God, that sounded so much more romantic in my head.<eos> Just jump in any time, Nicole, because I really, really don't know how to do this.<eos> Oh, sure you do.
It's an aneurysm.<eos> That's... that's an aneurysm?<eos> I've never seen one that big.<eos> Yeah, I don't want to clip that.<eos> Neither do I.
I never liked golf.<eos> Love golf.<eos> Just don't try hockey.<eos> Ow! Jo doesn't know what she wants.<eos> Neither does Amelia.
Shepherd could cut her some slack.<eos> It was her case.<eos> It was supposed to be my case.<eos> Do you think I should tell him to take it back?<eos> Jo, you already did.
And there are no other major bequests I shall have to deal with?<eos> Not unless Louis dies before he's 30, in which case, it all goes to my sister's eldest child.<eos> - What?<eos> - My sister Anna. You remember.<eos> Of course you do.
- Ozzy.<eos> Ozzy.<eos> I fucking told you everything, okay?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Sure you did.
We're the best uncles ever! Shh!<eos> But I...<eos> I don't get it!<eos> We set a vicious booby trap for our niece.<eos> We did everything right here!
Fallen or shifted laterally.<eos> Up to six inches per the estimate.<eos> Okay, so what?<eos> Shooter didn't miss.<eos> What if he did?
[SNIFFLES]<eos> I found these in Justin's drawer.<eos> Two tickets to Florida for next month.<eos> She thought she had time.<eos> We all do.
What the hell?<eos> Didn't he just start dating that chick like a month ago?<eos> So where does he get off proposing?<eos> - I don't get it.<eos> - I do.
It was a tumor.<eos> A malignant tumor.<eos> I see.<eos> - But... we removed it?<eos> - We did.
Will you take that?<eos> Thank you.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Don't you get sick of it all?<eos> I do.
Of course, you'll miss your career.<eos> But doing this for her, doing this for me... there may be no greater act of patriotism.<eos> Or love.<eos> I understand, sir.<eos> Do you, boy?
I loaned it to Nina this morning.<eos> She said she was in trouble. Is she okay?<eos> Do you have any idea where she was headed?<eos> I gave her the keys to my family's lake house in Vermont.<eos> You did?
I'll be here to catch you.<eos> Nay, surgeon, if anyone shall, 'tis I.<eos> I think...<eos> I believe.<eos> What did 'ee do?
You cannot afford it.<eos> And you have your own wife and child to care for.<eos> Would it not seem as if you value your cousin-in-law's comfort ahead of hers?<eos> It might, if I chose to tell her.<eos> Which I do not.
No, no, no. W-we should.<eos> I just... The words came out wrong.<eos> I thought I was ready for this. I'm not.<eos> - Hey, but let's talk.<eos> - We just did.
And look at you.<eos> In the palace.<eos> I always said this is where you were meant to be.<eos> Well, it's only temporary.<eos> But, uh... yes, you did.
I hope not.<eos> It's not enough to hope though, is it?<eos> You have to do something.<eos> You don't understand.<eos> Yes, I do.
You've got to be kidding me.<eos> Jay, this drug could be our only leverage.<eos> So you'd rather give it to a mass murderer than to any one of the decent people who've been infected?<eos> - I understand.<eos> - No, you don't.
- When you're married you may do as you wish, but you are not married yet.<eos> - Did she talk of Frank?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Does he write to her?<eos> No, he does not, nor she to him.
He has fallen victim to her wiles.<eos> What is the point of talking like that, Mama?<eos> You think everything is lost, then?<eos> Do I think Frank will be true to Mary Thorne?<eos> Yes, I do.
Then I've come to repeat my folly.<eos> For all the months we've been apart, nothing has altered me.<eos> Mr Gresham, there are many reasons why I am not worthy of you.<eos> - If you knew them all --<eos> - I do.
You know how fond we are of you.<eos> Mary, can we not put an end to this ill-feeling?<eos> It all depends on one thing, you know, and one thing only.<eos> Miss Thorne, do you consider yourself engaged to my nephew?<eos> Yes. I do.
I didn't sign it yet.<eos> I hear what you're saying, but I've known Emily a long time, and I think she deserves the benefit of the doubt.<eos> All right, it's your life.<eos> But you know how this is gonna end.<eos> As a matter of fact, I do.
You were making payments to Station House Number Five.<eos> - To whom?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> - Don't play silly buggers, Eddie.<eos> - I don't.
You make a good point.<eos> If the money is marked, I'll accept your story.<eos> What am I supposed to be seeing?<eos> I don't understand.<eos> I do.
Not an entirely unlikely venue in which to find a murder.<eos> More unexpected that anyone bothered to tell us about it.<eos> Henry.<eos> Who telephoned the police?<eos> Well, sir... - I did. - George?
Look at yourself: nice lad, good prospects.<eos> Not the sort that she usually crosses paths with.<eos> She may be trying to entrap you, George, into marriage.<eos> Sirs, she's not interested in that, she's told me as much.<eos> Of course she did.
- Oh! - Cheese?<eos> Must be nice to have someone do all the cooking for you.<eos> You should have tasted the abomination - Thomas made for me last night.<eos> - Sir, you didn't.<eos> I did indeed.
One day they'll train monkeys to do your job.<eos> Danny!<eos> You're getting fat.<eos> You hear that?<eos> Yes, I did.
And your father liked me, so I moved in with him...<eos> - And then he died.<eos> And since then, Pete has been supporting you out of the cash register, and you drank here free.<eos> - Yeah, that's right. - And- and then Pete died.<eos> - Mm-hmm, yes, he did.
- $100 million. - God damn it.<eos> We need to get those partners back.<eos> I told you, we're never gonna get them back.<eos> And right now we don't even know where they went.<eos> I do.
The Ishida cruiser is sending a shuttle to pick me up.<eos> When it gets here, we make our move.<eos> - Where's Two?<eos> - In solitary.<eos> - What did she do?
This way.<eos> Android, get us out of here.<eos> I am unable to establish a neural link.<eos> Go to the bridge.<eos> Do it manually.
No, I'll come back with you.<eos> Have fun.<eos> You gotta understand, Titch, if we'd known, we never would've left you there.<eos> We thought you died on that godforsaken planet.<eos> Almost did.
Or if Bo was maybe "rehearsing" with them before their birthdays, but couldn't prove it.<eos> Any chance this Bo guy resented your investigation and took it out on Hudson?<eos> I doubt it.<eos> When we had no luck on the underage-sex front, we passed the case on to Narco, thought they might have a better chance getting Bo on a drug charge, and we moved on.<eos> Well, Hudson didn't.
I don't know, really. I guess he was dying for so long That he wanted to live it up a little,<eos> that was claire giving the bastard One last chance to do the right thing.<eos> She told robert that he owed it to her To, uh, rekindle the flames or whatever.<eos> And if he still felt the same After they relived their honeymoon Along the california coast,<eos> And she did.
I want to move in together... full-time.<eos> You bastard.<eos> You had me so worried.<eos> I thought you wanted a divorce!<eos> I don't.
Mr. Colson, come out with your hands up. I repeat... come out slowly with your hands up!<eos> Oh, my God. Oh, my God.<eos> This is a much bigger operation than I imagined.<eos> Good thing you stopped them.<eos> We didn't.
You know, that's a great idea. Yes, I recorded all our sessions.<eos> And do you remember where those recordings are?<eos> Mm-hmm.<eos> Oh, do you want me to tell you where to find them?<eos> - Yes, I do.
What? There is no guilt.<eos> There is no remorse.<eos> There is no compassion for his soul.<eos> In fact, the more I investigated Dwight, the less human he seems.<eos> Because of what he did in the courtroom?
- I-I want you back.<eos> - Are you trying to tell me something or doing a Jackson 5 song?<eos> I miss having you as my partner.<eos> Do you want to tell me why you left?<eos> 'Cause you never did.
- Be right there.<eos> - Good luck!<eos> Um, you know Curt Morgan?<eos> The neuro-ophthalmologist?<eos> I do, yeah.
That's the problem.<eos> Okay.<eos> So what's the first thing you would do?<eos> I don't know!<eos> Yes, you do.
That was hard to watch.<eos> Shut up.<eos> It was hard to do.<eos> It was really hard to watch, though.<eos> So, I... I did it.
...that I did not make a choice.<eos> I wasn't given one.<eos> I-I was forced to use the knowledge and resources I had to fulfill the oath I took to save her life...<eos> Because the door didn't open.<eos> No, it did.
I wasn't given one.<eos> I-I was forced to use the knowledge and resources I had to fulfill the oath I took to save her life...<eos> Because the door didn't open.<eos> No, it did.<eos> It clearly did.
No, it did.<eos> It clearly did.<eos> I'm saying I didn't see it happen.<eos> I just don't understand how you didn't see it happen.<eos> You do.
You know what it's like.<eos> You... When you operate, when you control if a person breathes another breath, when... when you hold their beating heart in your hand, when you are responsible for that life, you don't see or hear or feel anything else.<eos> The rest of the world just disappears.<eos> You know that.<eos> You all do.
That they were backed into a corner and they didn't have a choice.<eos> The only difference with Warren is whether or not you think he's lying, whether you believe he didn't see that door open.<eos> And do you think he was lying?<eos> - No.<eos> - We don't.
Apparently, you're really good with the moms.<eos> Yeah, I'm not.<eos> I just did what Robbins...<eos> No, you helped that woman through the scariest hours of her life.<eos> I did, didn't I?
I was thinking maybe you should sit this one out.<eos> Oh, that's why you were trying to be delicate with me.<eos> You're worried the Evil Queen is about to come out to play.<eos> No, I just want what's best for you.<eos> No, you don't.
The Evil Queen... is inside me... always trying to get out.<eos> I can't expect you to get it.<eos> Well, I fought the darkness.<eos> You know I do understand.<eos> All due respect, but you don't.
I don't, because my other mom is doing that for me.<eos> You thought she was gonna go all Evil Queen again.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I should have trusted Regina.<eos> But you didn't!
Right now?<eos> Dean Ward, what a coincidence.<eos> Madam Secretary.<eos> I didn't know you went here.<eos> I don't.
- She saved his ass.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Did he know the contract and the money came from Alice?<eos> - Unclear.<eos> - He did.
I pranked you.<eos> You believed me.<eos> I pranked you and you believed me!<eos> I did.<eos> I really did.
- What?<eos> This is my mug!<eos> I left it at your house.<eos> It is.<eos> You did.
Can you make them groan?<eos> Can I get a groan from each of the zombies, left to right, please?<eos> Can you make them say, "Brains..."?<eos> You didn't tell us the suspect said, "Brains."<eos> They didn't.
- You got reinstated.<eos> That's great!<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I just don't know how I get over two men dying on my watch.<eos> Mm, you don't.
Uh, I think you're a little bit confused.<eos> We ask the questions.<eos> How is it exactly you think you can help us?<eos> - I know who did it.<eos> - You do.
- And maybe after the concert, you guys could sign up for Cub Scouts.<eos> I'm gonna disown my mother.<eos> [Laughs] That won't stop her from telling me all the cute Frankie Junior stories.<eos> Did you find anything in the historical document room at the library, Scout?<eos> - Actually, I did.
- I believe you. [Laughs]<eos> Hey, thanks for letting me put you on the spot.<eos> It's no problem, Detective.<eos> - I didn't mean to upset you.<eos> - You didn't.
They're taking forever to pull the logs.<eos> Moving at a snail's pace.<eos> No.<eos> I saw the second ball hit the table before the cup dropped.<eos> You did not.
We ran right through the last batch.<eos> - Italian is my favorite.<eos> - Is that right?<eos> Frankie's been teaching me to cook.<eos> - We did chicken parm last week.
Well, the "Guinness Book of World Records"<eos> no longer keeps statistics on this subject for fear that those competing for the title would suffer ill effects.<eos> Sometimes I think you're actually a robot.<eos> I do know how to do the robot.<eos> - No, you don't.
no longer keeps statistics on this subject for fear that those competing for the title would suffer ill effects.<eos> Sometimes I think you're actually a robot.<eos> I do know how to do the robot.<eos> - No, you don't.<eos> - Yeah, I do.
- Did you say...<eos> - disappearing act? - No, I did not.<eos> Oh, I think I know that trick.<eos> - No.<eos> You really don't.
French toast stuffed with strawberry cream cheese.<eos> - You wanna know why?<eos> - Why?<eos> Because I made a really big decision about us.<eos> - You did?
A curious mind is a wondrous thing.<eos> Well, I decided to indulge my curiosity with further metallurgy tests.<eos> I discovered that the pellets picked up trace particles of a hardened steel laminate with a carbon point of .06.<eos> - We need to check with the FBI firearms database.<eos> - I did.
Yeah.<eos> Unless you can stand there and honestly tell me that you don't love me the way I love you.<eos> You love me?<eos> Yes.<eos> I do.
I had an offer from a big chain mortuary, and I was bringing him the papers to sign.<eos> Did he say why he was selling?<eos> He said he was fed up with the business.<eos> I figured they had money problems.<eos> A lot of these places do.
Jane.<eos> Did you really like the chapters that you read?<eos> - Honestly.<eos> No sugarcoating.<eos> - Yes. I did.
Dad.<eos> I really need to speak with your daughter.<eos> You're moving back home, now.<eos> I don't know.<eos> I do.
Mr. Hyde.<eos> How did you get here?<eos> Gold.<eos> He made a deal with you, didn't he?<eos> Yes, that he did.
That might just be a record.<eos> Yeah, I don't care.<eos> I need to make a phone call.<eos> You're not making anything after what you just did.<eos> I didn't do anything.
So I suggest you go back to your cell and you think long and hard about what you want to accomplish during your time here.<eos> I have to say, I'm glad you've decided to settle rather than fight these suits.<eos> Well, as you can see, things are a little tight around here, so you have us at a disadvantage.<eos> What I have is the fact that you don't want to be talking about having hired a fraud in court for the next six months.<eos> No, we don't, so...
Yep.<eos> So whose stick i gotta yank to get a hanger<eos> Can i just say...<eos> Damn.<eos> you sure did.
Be cool.<eos> Says the guy who eats salad for breakfast.<eos> we know bobo's plan.<eos> If he's got it right.<eos> He does.
- Something doesn't feel right.<eos> - Then call him.<eos> I'm telling you, something's not right here.<eos> You wanted to see me?<eos> Yes, I did.
It's not like teams are lining up for a 35-year-old tackle.<eos> Hey, you're not just any tackle, baby.<eos> - You the Black Swan.<eos> Okay, baby, I just... I got to make me one block.<eos> You just did.
Yes, because I paid practically nothing for them.<eos> Because they're worth nothing, so you overpaid.<eos> Aha! Those two houses happen to be sitting next to the future home of an 18-hole golf course, which they're gonna move forward with as soon as they do their methane off-gassing system.<eos> Do you know what that means?<eos> Of course you do not.
The way he transitions into a canter, it's like... like...<eos> Floating on air!<eos> Dr. McCord.<eos> I did not realize you knew where my office was.<eos> Yeah, I do.
- Yeah, hello.<eos> - That's a good idea.<eos> Whatever works, right?<eos> - Okay.<eos> - 'Cause this approach does not.
Yes.<eos> We lost a patient this morning, Lisa Patrick.<eos> Her husband wants to harvest her eggs.<eos> Do we have a protocol for that?<eos> We do.
You gonna share that fruity ass drink?<eos> Oh, come on, Chuck, man. I brought you here to break your funk, not to see you sink deeper into it.<eos> Yeah, Buffalo and New Orleans ain't calling me with no huge contract.<eos> - You got options, brother.<eos> - And so do you.
That ain't me.<eos> Well, sometimes we got to do things we don't want to do.<eos> Like you think I wanted to go on that stage and put myself on display like a piece of meat?<eos> - Yeah. - Yeah, I do.<eos> No, I did not.
No, man, like, everything I do turns to shit.<eos> Shakedowns, injuries, demonic, overgrown fucking poodle on the loose and shit.<eos> I can't do shit right.<eos> Well, you got Vern out of Crenshaw, right?<eos> Man, his talent did that.
- Is that a record for Zephyr One?<eos> - It is.<eos> It was supposed to be even longer.<eos> - You know who called us in?<eos> - I do.
- Two dead in the street.<eos> - Who?<eos> Ghost Rider. You must not be from around here.<eos> Do you know where I can find him?<eos> Nobody does.
It's not<eos> - gross.<eos> You burp all the time.<eos> - I have to leap onto you.<eos> I don't do it outwardly.
- gross.<eos> You burp all the time.<eos> - I have to leap onto you.<eos> I don't do it outwardly.<eos> - What do you... what do you do then?
Like 99% of all the other bands.<eos> You think he'll ever change?<eos> He doesn't have to change.<eos> He just has to grow up.<eos> I did.
He's got to show me something first.<eos> If he does, who knows?<eos> Emma Harris?<eos> I'm not sure if you remember me.<eos> Lieutenant Severide, of course I do.
So... you were right.<eos> Body belongs to Courtney Harris.<eos> Have you spoken to Courtney's mother recently?<eos> You told me to back off.<eos> I did.
- Hey, I just stopped by to see how you are doing.<eos> Thank God you're here.<eos> Can you talk some sense into my brother?<eos> I don't know if you remember my brother, David.<eos> Yeah, I do.
So, April knows, huh?<eos> Uh, that you're seeing other people.<eos> - Does April know?<eos> - No!<eos> N... She doesn't.
Did you know before the divorce?<eos> Did you know before we signed those papers?<eos> - Uh... - April?<eos> I... yes. I...<eos> Yes, I did.
I don't know what to do.<eos> I want to make it right.<eos> I mean, I have to make it right somehow, but I don't know what to do.<eos> I don't... I don't know how to fix it.<eos> You did something indefensible.
Thanks, Pop-Pop.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Your mother and grandmother have a problem with boundaries.<eos> They don't know how to talk to you like you're an adult.<eos> But I do.
And let me get you a refill on these sodas.<eos> Yeah.<eos> We'll get that cleared up for you in just a sec.<eos> - You get my order on 14?<eos> - Oh, yeah, I did.
- You're freaking out because you got some sword hanging over your head?<eos> Me, too, and I can't do a damn thing about it except wait.<eos> You can fix your stupid sword.<eos> Go home and get the freaking execution over with.<eos> I did.
Oh, don't worry.<eos> I'll move 'em.<eos> Unless I forget.<eos> Just kidding, I won't.<eos> Unless I do.
- Please don't do this.<eos> I knew that you were someone special...<eos> It's not the time.<eos> and that you deserved the very best of everything.<eos> I really don't.
They got a little saggy.<eos> Well, let me be the judge of...<eos> You actually made dessert.<eos> Well, you said you like chocolate.<eos> I do.
Several thank yous.<eos> Countless high-fives.<eos> That's right, loneliness and regret.<eos> But now you have a chance to build something real with a woman you seem to genuinely care about.<eos> Yeah, I really do.
There's nothing wrong with you.<eos> Everything's right with you.<eos> Supple and good-smelling and right.<eos> I just think maybe we should wait.<eos> You do?
Everything's right with you.<eos> Supple and good-smelling and right.<eos> I just think maybe we should wait.<eos> You do?<eos> Because I don't.
Supple and good-smelling and right.<eos> I just think maybe we should wait.<eos> You do?<eos> Because I don't.<eos> Well, I did.
Check's in the mail.<eos> I got more puns than players!<eos> Felix... stop.<eos> We saw the video of your... meltdown at the chess tournament.<eos> You did?
And you are going to make a great First Lady.<eos> Once we lock down a more appropriate campaign hairstyle.<eos> You don't like my hair?<eos> Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.<eos> I do not.
I don't deserve this hammer.<eos> I may or may not have started the garbage chute fire.<eos> And I may or may not have tried to put it out with vodka.<eos> I don't deserve to be president.<eos> Felix does.
It's contagious, isn't it?<eos> Marionette show?<eos> Look, you know I am a ray of sunshine, but I'm gonna rain on this parade.<eos> I think it'll be fun.<eos> I do.
"The Power of Posture"?<eos> Yes, you need to get big.<eos> If you stand confident, you will be confident.<eos> - That stuff doesn't work.<eos> Maybe it does.
I don't understand...<eos> She said no!<eos> You got in my head about needing a substantial woman, and now I don't have Charlotte or Allyson!<eos> Well, if it makes you feel any better, I had a bad night, too.<eos> It kind of does.
Maybe it's because I'm standing here in my delicates like a crazy person!<eos> Oh, my god!<eos> She's out cold!<eos> What have I done?<eos> What do I do?
We'd like to call Faiza Assaf, Your Honor.<eos> I told Annalise she can't testify.<eos> It'll buy us time.<eos> Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth?<eos> I do.
Robin is at peace.<eos> You know, I've been sitting here thinking about these new people and how pathetic they were for hiding in some horrible land so their stories didn't have to play out.<eos> And then I realized... that's exactly what I used to do.<eos> I don't remember you hiding from anything.<eos> Oh, I did.
I love all of those ideas, but I just became captain, and you have your P.I. business.<eos> And then there's LokSat.<eos> Exactly.<eos> We have responsibilities, right?<eos> But what if we didn't?
Hm? TTX.<eos> It's a neurotoxin found in several species of fish.<eos> It's extremely potent.<eos> And yet he survived, so do you have an explanation.<eos> No, but your husband sure does.
When his life-force cannot be extinguished, when he cannot die.<eos> Then he is a god.<eos> I think he senses your powers.<eos> Yeah?<eos> You do?
I mean, it was cute but just overly cute.<eos> Alan.<eos> Huh?<eos> Do you know who ordered the L.A.H. for Zantium?<eos> I do.
The expectation of privacy is in relation to government surveillance.<eos> If Dr. Nachmann simply uses some discretion - by pulling his blinds...<eos> - He shouldn't have to.<eos> Your Honor, we have to weigh the minor inconvenience to Dr. Nachmann against the significant public interest in preventing crime.<eos> - So we do.
Eli Gold.<eos> - What can I do for you?<eos> - My client is here to confess to obstruction of justice in the Don Schakowsky bribery case.<eos> You realize that potentially comes with it a... lengthy prison term.<eos> - I do.
You look relaxed.<eos> Upside of choosing unemployment.<eos> What do you need?<eos> Do you know Jason Crouse?<eos> I do.
Yeah, your mother wanted to drop out of college.<eos> She wanted to go to India for a year.<eos> Seriously?<eos> Ah, well, it was a different time.<eos> No, she didn't.
Um, what-what did he mean by that?<eos> It felt like he was about to confess.<eos> Did he have an attorney with him?<eos> No, he hadn't asked for one yet.<eos> - But he did later?
Yes.<eos> I thought we should conduct a top-to-bottom search - for the bullets.<eos> - And what did Mr. Florrick say?<eos> He said he would take it under advisement.<eos> - And did he?
- No.<eos> But don't you have reason to be angry with the Florricks?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes.<eos> You do.
My father will be back shortly, when he is, you can leave for work.<eos> Bones, why are you even doing this?<eos> You don't even believe in psychology.<eos> You're right.<eos> I don't.
What else?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I didn't see anything else, I swear.<eos> I don't know who he is.<eos> I don't.
Jenny Dahmer.<eos> But I never let it stop me.<eos> Because I knew that I was going to make something of myself one day.<eos> Well, this job was supposed to be temporary. The plan was to make enough money to get to Paris and paint. So...<eos> So why didn't you?
Science cannot be swayed.<eos> And right now the science is saying my husband is wrong.<eos> The victim's father mentioned, uh, owing money to a bookie. I mean, if that bookie really wanted his money, I mean, there's a possibility he may have gone after the guy's son.<eos> Your wife thinks you're wasting time on the bookie.<eos> Of course she does.
Dr. Edison.<eos> Please come in.<eos> I'm happy to see you.<eos> Well, I'm only here because of you.<eos> I simply did my job.
According to Sherlock, you paid someone to break him out of a Russian prison, presumably to torture him, make him give you the name of the person who hired him.<eos> Nonsense.<eos> So he's wrong?<eos> You had nothing to do with Krasnov escaping?<eos> I did not.
They'll hire the great John Alden to ransom us."<eos> She was waiting for a man to save us.<eos> And I was waiting for you.<eos> But you never came.<eos> No man did.
To take revenge for my family.<eos> Just sorry I failed.<eos> You didn't fail.<eos> You're right.<eos> I didn't.
Lillian can't publish until she corroborates Andrew's story.<eos> The less that's out there, the better off we'll be.<eos> Thank you for coming when I called.<eos> You didn't call.<eos> Abby did.
Tell me.<eos> I'm curious.<eos> You think you can take Mellie down without me burning everything to the ground?<eos> Exposing everything you did?<eos> No, I don't.
(quiet cough)<eos> I'm sorry. What?<eos> You heard me.<eos> Do you know Andrea?<eos> My daughter does.
Do you have a storage unit in Reston, Virginia?<eos> My wife an I had one.<eos> It's been cleared out for years.<eos> Why did you rent a van last week?<eos> I didn't.
And I'll be honest with you, in that moment, I was scared... Of him.<eos> Of what he could do to his own team.<eos> Or his own son, for that matter.<eos> I was scared-- why would you believe anything he says?<eos> We didn't.
Yes. Did you question your commitment to the BAU after her murder?<eos> Yes.<eos> And how does that connect to this?<eos> Because it was then that you started dismissing procedure.<eos> I did not.
Who's Eric Rawdon?<eos> He's behind this.<eos> Maybe he's your partner.<eos> If that were true, you'd have evidence.<eos> I do.
- What did you do now? Grab your Kleenex. - What did you do now?<eos> ♪ ♪<eos> - What did you do now?<eos> - Hey.<eos> - Hey. - What did you do now?
- Oh, I'm sorry, you... You wanted me... sure.<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> I mean, nothing has happened at all... at all, but last night there was this moment...<eos> Do you know what I'm talking about?<eos> Yeah, I do.
He retired.<eos> And, uh, now he's a volunteer for the 20th precinct.<eos> He mans the desk in the lobby, takes calls, does filing.<eos> I thought maybe I could do something like that around here.<eos> Oh, you did, huh?
Yes, boss lady.<eos> Look, Jon, I know you've become close to the family.<eos> It's not about that, Bernie.<eos> We all want our clients to be exonerated.<eos> Of course we do.
The main reason you're by yourself is so you can figure out what you want... really want.<eos> And if you're always feeling bad or guilty, how are you ever gonna know?<eos> Probably won't.<eos> I want you to thrive, Tawney.<eos> I really do.
I know.<eos> You're right.<eos> Good night.<eos> A little bird said you had a date last night.<eos> I did, at that.
Showing up at my work is... hard to qualify as a date, but, uh, it was... nice.<eos> He still do yards?<eos> He's still in that line of work, Mother, but I believe he prefers the title of "landscaper."<eos> You think you'll see him again?<eos> Uh, yes, in fact, I do.
You don't need a husband.<eos> You need a saint.<eos> Okay, we probably went too far.<eos> They want me to see somebody.<eos> Who does?
Threw it away?<eos> Then how did it...<eos> Did you pull all of his things out of the trash after he put them there?<eos> Well, yes.<eos> Yes, I did.
Okay.<eos> Is it weird being here?<eos> Little bit.<eos> Remember that big ol' picture we used to have up here?<eos> I do.
If we're being honest.<eos> Some things. Not everything.<eos> I don't want to corner you, Tawney.<eos> Hem you in, put you on the spot anymore.<eos> I really don't. I...
Trey went back where?<eos> That's what I asked Bobby.<eos> He said that's all George said.<eos> He asked me to pass a message on to Daniel, too.<eos> Bobby did.
Showed us all around, the kitchen and the library.<eos> It's a grand old house.<eos> Uh, Mr. Pickle told us how you had to go back to work for a little bit.<eos> Yeah, you get that all squared away, Dan, at the warehouse?<eos> Yes, I did.
Let's roll.<eos> Name's Ted.<eos> Dog.<eos> Did you say "Dog"?<eos> I did.
Good.<eos> We got a lot accomplished.<eos> But, um... how do I say this? Um...<eos> I made out with Schmidt's dad.<eos> You did what?
Well, neither do you.<eos> You two are looking at 20 years for impersonating a federal agent and bribing a U.S. senator.<eos> Whoa, whoa, no.<eos> Hang on, hang on.<eos> No, no, I didn't do any bribing.
No, I was just... thinking about this place today and wondering what it looked like now.<eos> Do you wanna sit down?<eos> Yes, I think I would.<eos> I saw they kept the big gates out in front.<eos> Yeah, they did.
Maybe you should go wait in the car with Alison.<eos> Seriously, we got it.<eos> Just go sit in the car.<eos> No, I need to help.<eos> Okay, because if I don't do something, then...
Aria, I called you last night after you went to Ezra's. Yeah.<eos> I'm sorry I didn't get back to you.<eos> Well, is everything okay?<eos> Did he find out about the Nicole call?<eos> No, he didn't.
You have it.<eos> I already have one.<eos> Just take a sip.<eos> Be careful, Hanna or you'll end up just like Sara.<eos> What did I do?
It's hard to watch someone go through that, isn't it?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I never had a brother or a sister, but I've seen it over and over, when someone loses someone when they're young.<eos> It never heals over.<eos> No, it doesn't.
She still live here?<eos> Moved as soon as she could.<eos> Still thinks I should've done something.<eos> Saved him.<eos> Everybody did.
CQ, CQ, for shit's sake, is anybody out there?<eos> Hey, Cameron and I decided to have a weekly project meeting to streamline the swapmeet integration and we thought that you'd be a valuable addition.<eos> Yeah, sure.<eos> If you want me there.<eos> Yeah, we do.
He did it to Gordon. Even Donna, the nicest woman on the planet, doesn't speak to him anymore.<eos> You think you're gonna be any different?<eos> I don't know, Cameron.<eos> Listen, I get it.<eos> Really, I do.
Well, uh, who wrote the original code for that section?<eos> - Tom did. - Great, which one is Tom?<eos> None of them.<eos> He didn't make the trip.<eos> - Why not? - He just didn't.
I thought this was supposed to be handshakes and how do you dos.<eos> You see an opportunity, you take it.<eos> That's the sport of it.<eos> It could have gone the other way.<eos> But it didn't.
But that's not right because it's not what I think.<eos> I'm sorry you couldn't keep up in the meeting.<eos> You made a promise to people that you wouldn't charge them.<eos> I didn't promise that I wouldn't ever charge them.<eos> Of course you did.
Well, that little speech made me very uncomfortable.<eos> - I'm kidding.<eos> - It never happened.<eos> - Come on. - What?<eos> - It so clearly did.
Grr! You know, there'll be a whole slew of Valley big shots there.<eos> It's a great opportunity for John to make some business connections.<eos> Sure.<eos> But... nobody calls him John.<eos> I do.
"Our" is not going to be enough for this guy.<eos> Ok, Felicity.<eos> Church runs with a crew, and yours is not coming back.<eos> - You don't know that.<eos> - Yes, I do.
It's the girl you've been stalking for the last three months?<eos> I have not been stalking her.<eos> I've been working up the courage<eos> - to ask her out. - And?<eos> And I did.
Look, I'm sorry.<eos> I know that this is hard to believe.<eos> No, that's just it, Barry.<eos> I do believe you.<eos> You...do?
Oh! Mick!<eos> Buddy!<eos> - How'd you find me?<eos> - I didn't.<eos> Pretty did.
He gave himself up for me.<eos> That sounds like John.<eos> And he was a Hunter?<eos> And he raised you and Sam to...<eos> Yeah, he did.
You gave me no choice.<eos> And, well, I could say it was never supposed to go this way, but you're...you.<eos> It was always going to go this way.<eos> And you know me?<eos> We do.
I spent my life running from this, from hunting.<eos> And I got out.<eos> I never wanted this for you and Sam.<eos> Mom, I-I get it.<eos> I do.
He's not gonna hit you.<eos> Please, it's my dream job.<eos> I'd like to apologize, Nick, for punching you in the throat.<eos> I know it hurt a whole lot.<eos> Not that much, but you did it, so...
What?<eos> It's the drawer, Paula, the drawer.<eos> I mean, don't you see what the drawer means?<eos> Yes.<eos> I do.
Yeah, they're gonna be peeled.<eos> Okay, Heather,<eos> I need to find Greg.<eos> And I know you know where he is.<eos> Oh, I really don't.
How do you think he is?<eos> Why?<eos> Do you know something?<eos> Does Mossad know where he is?<eos> We do not.
Uh, yeah.<eos> Sorry, Castle.<eos> Oh, no, I'm sorry for you.<eos> You're the one who put all the planning into our special evening.<eos> Yeah, I-I did.
Sorry, Castle.<eos> Oh, no, I'm sorry for you.<eos> You're the one who put all the planning into our special evening.<eos> Yeah, I-I did.<eos> I... Yeah, I did.
We have every right to be here!<eos> I said stand down.<eos> You want to shoot me?<eos> Shoot me!<eos> Do it!
What?<eos> No, you sound paranoid.<eos> You know, I wish people would stop saying that to me.<eos> He loves you.<eos> We both do.
It created an alliance against him.<eos> Now you want us to rush into war Because you see your window of opportunity closing?<eos> The Sheik chose Ihab, Loud and clear.<eos> If he were alive, I know what side he'd be on.<eos> We all do.
I'm his best friend and he's having me arrested.<eos> What makes you think... He's in love with me.<eos> He's in love with you.<eos> I-I didn't know.<eos> Or maybe I did.
- I clean.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - Yeah, and-- and-- and, um, I used to just clean this one floor and then they started sending me to the cancer ward and I started seeing all these ladies with cancer, and it really gave me a very special arousal.<eos> I mean, I don't want to be off-f-fensive to you.<eos> - Ah, you don't.
I'm in.<eos> I have unlocked the security for the worm.<eos> What is it?<eos> I recognize this code.<eos> You do?
Which is why you sent our worm to plunge London into darkness.<eos> Oh, Wes, your captors drove you mad.<eos> How can you of all people say that to me?<eos> They had it coming.<eos> They all did.
And the girls and I stopped being a placeholder.<eos> And we became her life.<eos> I get all that.<eos> No.<eos> No, you don't, Stefan.
Thanks for getting back to me.<eos> I'll admit, I was surprised to see you on my phone sheet.<eos> Is there something I can do for you, Damon?<eos> I have a rather lengthy list of hell stone rejects that I need killed posthaste, and I hear you have the resources to do it.<eos> I do.
Yeah, I was there.<eos> I came back for the anniversary of the sheriff's death.<eos> I knew it'd be a hard day for Caroline, and I thought there would be a good chance she'd show up, and if she did, I wanted to be there for her.<eos> But she didn't show, did she?<eos> No, she never did.
Bonnie, please!<eos> Look, I just didn't want you to be consumed by one moment in your life that you couldn't take back.<eos> I released Rayna and helped her kidnap Caroline to punish you for something I did.<eos> Can't blame yourself, Matt.<eos> I don't.
So open it.<eos> No, we can't.<eos> Only someone from the Armory can.<eos> Why didn't you bring Enzo?<eos> I did.
But then you left me.<eos> You left all of us.<eos> It wasn't just the saps on Earth who were praying to you.<eos> The angels prayed, too.<eos> And so did I -- every day.
Chuck Shurley?<eos> He's a prophet of the Lord.<eos> I don't know how prophets are chosen.<eos> I don't want to be a prophet.<eos> No, you don't at all.
if Chuck is leaning our way.<eos> You don't know?<eos> If we do get Lucifer for the added muscle, then...maybe he'll play ball.<eos> I thought they hated each other.<eos> Yeah, they do.
Together, we can make Hell great again.<eos> Of course, I'll need your help recruiting others. When the numbers are in our favor, we'll strike, and each and every one of you will have earned a place at my side.<eos> Told you he'd do this.<eos> "He"?<eos> Do what?
What?<eos> What would you have done?<eos> It doesn't matter.<eos> You were my father, and you forsook me.<eos> I did.
Brother, I...<eos> In the beginning... it was just you and me, and we were family.<eos> I loved you, and I thought -- I knew... that you loved me.<eos> I did.<eos> I do.
Hey, come on.<eos> Come on, what?<eos> This hotel, the longevity of it, well, I... might not be the greatest mother in the regular ways... but now I've gotten in the way of us providing for them.<eos> You haven't.<eos> You didn't.
No further questions.<eos> You testified earlier that you had the camera installed because your car had been broken into?<eos> That's right.<eos> Did you catch the perpetrators?<eos> Chicago PD did, yes.
You can't shoot the police and we know he's the shooter.<eos> Beyond Chicago's reasonable doubt?<eos> [sighs]<eos> You do realize that I'm the black State's Attorney of Cook County?<eos> - I do.
I warn you, I got a bankroll from all the two cents on that one.<eos> I'll bet you do.<eos> Shoot.<eos> Did you know that he came and talked to the recruits when I was in the Academy?<eos> No, I did not.
Someone moved too fast.<eos> They just opened fire.<eos> Kid was just reaching for his wallet.<eos> Did he mention that he shot first?<eos> Yeah, he did.
You should know that.<eos> Thanks.<eos> And I think really, really highly of her.<eos> You should know that, too.<eos> I do.
There wasn't time to get to the hospital, so we were directed to a maternity home, where there was a doctor attending another birth.<eos> "Doctor"?<eos> Sawbones!<eos> We nearly lost the both of them.<eos> But, thanks to God, we didn't.
Okay, I don't know, but I'm sure they're out there.<eos> Why don't we just ask the students what they think about losing their holidays?<eos> I am just trying to do what's right.<eos> In an ideal world, everyone would just wear labels that told us exactly how not to offend them, but they don't.<eos> But what if they did?
No, I haven't!<eos> This stupid plane is stopping in Hawaii, which makes this trip even longer.<eos> No, no, that's great.<eos> You just get off in Hawaii.<eos> And do what?
Hey.<eos> Sooner or later, this guy's gonna come up for air, and the cops'll be there.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Thanks for having my back.<eos> The whole house does.
What happens when there aren't any more?<eos> I don't think Gotham's running out of monsters anytime soon.<eos> I really can't get you to come back, huh?<eos> Look, whatever happened when you went to see Lee, and you know I don't like to pry...<eos> Sure you don't.
Told you I was gonna go.<eos> So?<eos> So...<eos> I see why you like it.<eos> You do?
The system is maintaining its own stability, the quantum vortex apparatus is now controlling the orientation.<eos> You're right.<eos> You realize what this means?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I do.
Well, they're lucky to have you.<eos> Well, thank you.<eos> You're welcome.<eos> Do you realize what's happening here?<eos> Yeah, I do.
"Courtesy" my ass.<eos> You wanted us to fight for this case.<eos> (laughs):<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, I did.
Miranda.<eos> What happened?<eos> Keep your hands on the wheel.<eos> Can I help you?<eos> You just did.
I didn't mean to kill those people.<eos> It was you?<eos> It was the drugs.<eos> That woman, she gave us each, you know, a little money and-and said she was willing to look the other way as long as we never came back again.<eos> You did.
The prosecution is halfway through the case, and has done a pretty good job with the jury.<eos> So, how do we undo that?<eos> Really?<eos> I'm handing you a tabloid murder case, and no one wants to sit with me at the table?<eos> I do.
'Cause we're the woke ones.<eos> Hey. Uh, can I just say how happy this makes me, that we can hang out and not make this weird?<eos> Uh, what?<eos> You thought I couldn't do that?<eos> Of - - Of course I did.
So let me put this simply for you.<eos> There's a saying where I come from... whoever can't hear must feel.<eos> So do it.<eos> Make me feel.<eos> Somebody already did.
Thank you so much for agreeing to meet with me.<eos> I just wanted to go on record as soon as possible.<eos> We understand.<eos> As long as you know any statement you make here can be used as evidence at the formal disciplinary hearing.<eos> I do.
You couldn't... because Sam got into your head... just like he did to me.<eos> This is a woman who wants me dead.<eos> Because she blames you for the baby, and that's fair.<eos> You know that.<eos> Of course I do.
Very.<eos> Too good?<eos> 'Cause Nate's too good to me.<eos> I tried to be okay with it.<eos> I really did.
And they think Wes shot him?<eos> His father?<eos> Biological father.<eos> Oh, my God. You knew about this.<eos> -Of course she did.
All this is happening because you keep trying to protect me.<eos> That was my choice.<eos> I took you off the waitlist.<eos> I should have left you alone, but --<eos> Why didn't you?
Okay, so, you confront her during her deposition?<eos> No.<eos> You confront her during her deposition.<eos> What... you don't want the automatic "A"?<eos> Yeah, no, of course I do.
Stop!<eos> - You know I always have been.<eos> - No.<eos> You know, I don't know anything - about you!<eos> - You do.
- My God.<eos> - Tell me nothing happened.<eos> Of course nothing happened!<eos> You have to trust me right now.<eos> I do.
I knew our boy wasn't cray-cray.<eos> The State calls Wes Gibbins to the stand.<eos> Please raise your right hand.<eos> Do you solemnly swear to tell the whole truth and nothing but the truth?<eos> I do.
That's what love is.<eos> No, I think love is letting a guy stomp on your heart and still being there for him when another guy rejects him!<eos> You think that letting me cry on your shoulder is proof that you love me?<eos> - Yes!<eos> Because I do.
Do it!<eos> - I can't survive this.<eos> - Pull the trigger!<eos> - Please don't, Frank!<eos> - Do it!
She said she was unconscious.<eos> I... look, look, you need to talk to the producers 'cause they must have told her to say that, too.<eos> We don't say anything unless we've cleared it with them first.<eos> So Melanie agreed to a rape kit but she has no memory of consenting to or even having sex?<eos> No, no, but Ryan does.
Yes, but the crew left at midnight, and from the time code, Melanie's assault happened after that.<eos> Yeah, and all the crew guys had alibis.<eos> We confirmed that they were drinking at a nearby hotel bar until last call.<eos> Test them all for STDs anyway.<eos> Yeah, we did.
He says he has some news.<eos> Hope he didn't quit his job.<eos> Hey.<eos> You told 'em?<eos> I did.
So nothing puts him in Charisse's neighborhood?<eos> No, we may have something.<eos> Now, the red lines are Gary's possible route to work from his home.<eos> Now, he should use either the Triborough or the Whitestone Bridge to get from the Bronx to Queens.<eos> - But he doesn't?
- Yeah?<eos> Until it gives us leverage.<eos> So I say again, what do you want?<eos> You know that Munson is a rapist.<eos> - Do I?
Lisa Munson.<eos> Is she all right?<eos> She is, thanks to you.<eos> Ow. I blew it, Dad.<eos> - No, no, no, you didn't.
You know, I fall asleep at random times of the day. It still messes with my stomach.<eos> Oh, plus, they switched companies on me and I wasn't able to get any for a fucking month.<eos> - Did you run out?<eos> - No.<eos> No, I didn't.
Why except me?<eos> Why except me?<eos> - What do you want me to say?<eos> You didn't have a good time with me?<eos> Yeah, I did, actually.
Well, Pete is making me tense.<eos> - l'm sorry, I'm kind of... preoccupied right now.<eos> - I... I know, I heard about the Probitol.<eos> - You did call her.<eos> - No, I didn't.
You think he's gonna turn himself in.<eos> He may have.<eos> But now his actions have become more erratic, more intensified since he killed his mother on that boat.<eos> Good, 'cause I don't want him to stain his routine.<eos> Well, I do, okay?
(Crying): I can't believe I took your advice and told him he had to make a decision.<eos> Really?<eos> Was that my advice?<eos> I actually convinced myself he was going to pick me.<eos> But he didn't.
Yeah.<eos> A few deals went belly-up last year.<eos> We could barely afford a real office, so about, uh, six months ago, my house became our headquarters.<eos> Something like that can put a lot of stress on a partnership.<eos> Yeah, it did.
So obviously we should do it.<eos> No, you misunderstand.<eos> I've got no intention of infiltrating the house.<eos> Did you know, Watson, 90% of homes with security systems fail to include sensors on the garage doors?<eos> Well, I do now.
Ah!<eos> Max!<eos> Max, it's OK.<eos> I don't know how to stop this.<eos> Fortunately, I do.
He used me cruelly.<eos> I see.<eos> How very, very sad.<eos> I presume you, uh, craved support from family, friends, former colleagues?<eos> I did.
Once you got back to the station, then what happened?<eos> Until my first night in here, that was the most scared I've ever been in my life.<eos> They kept saying...<eos> Tell us the truth, Seamus.<eos> I did.
I will.<eos> Nothing to worry about?<eos> I was wondering when you were gonna show up.<eos> You do know why the capacitor failed.<eos> Yes, I do.
I just spaced out.<eos> Cath.<eos> That cop's funeral was huge.<eos> Did you see it on TV?<eos> Yeah, I did.
- Yes?<eos> He doesn't blame you.<eos> He better not.<eos> I didn't shoot him.<eos> What about the guy who did?
Yeah.<eos> That would've been nice.<eos> Hey, Craig, you want to make some money?<eos> Old times' sake?<eos> No, he doesn't.
That would've been nice.<eos> Hey, Craig, you want to make some money?<eos> Old times' sake?<eos> No, he doesn't.<eos> He doesn't.
You haven't heard anything around the house, boys talking or anything?<eos> Nope.<eos> I'll show you a thing or two about paintball.<eos> Yeah, like you know.<eos> Yeah, I do.
Hi.<eos> Where's Cath and Lena?<eos> Oh, Lena came down with the flu that Cath had last week.<eos> Now, you and I both know that's a lie.<eos> We do.
I run bullshit errands for jobs she wants to run.<eos> Basta! Basta.<eos> Do you even hear yourself?<eos> I don't know why you put up with it.<eos> I really don't.
What?<eos> No.<eos> I'm coming. I want to see this.<eos> Trust me.<eos> You don't.
Maybe I would, uh, adjust the paperwork, so all the ATMs on the U.S.S Ronald Reagan would run out of cash about three months into their deployment.<eos> Right?<eos> I'd bury... I would bury all the shortcomings and I'd make it completely untraceable.<eos> Ah. But wouldn't that get you in trouble?<eos> Not if I did it right.
Jeez, man, you were bitching about the job being too hard.<eos> Now you're bitching about it being too easy.<eos> - Why you even here?<eos> - Do you wanna do it alone?<eos> - Do you?
What are you talking about?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Wait, you're... you're breaking up with me?<eos> But you like me.<eos> - Did I do something?
We were talking hypotheticals.<eos> Hypothetically, there's 5 grand in there.<eos> IRS doesn't come sniffin' around for 5 grand, right?<eos> - I-I can't take this.<eos> - You already did.
How are you feeling?<eos> Thank you.<eos> I, um... I was in a car accident a few years ago, and, um...<eos> I started taking Oxy. And somewhere along the way...<eos> Yeah, my mom did heroin.
I'll take that chance.<eos> Come on, baby.<eos> I figured I'd scared you off.<eos> I don't want it.<eos> Yeah, you do, Ray.
He might just do it for pussy.<eos> Jesus, you're not considering having her sleep with him, are you?<eos> We need him to wear a wire.<eos> Do you really give a shit how she gets him to do it?<eos> Yeah, actually, I do.
It's time.<eos> - Oh, for God's sake!<eos> I'm done.<eos> I love my dad.<eos> And I did.
You got it?<eos> Hey.<eos> Hi, Russell.<eos> Try not to talk about religion.<eos> No, I only do that for a salary. Great.
Wait, we never had sex.<eos> Did we?<eos> Do you wiggle a lot?<eos> I do.<eos> But we didn't.
But I was able to print out flyers for our dessert bar.<eos> I'd love to give them a rounded edge.<eos> Do you have scissors?<eos> Are you kidding me?<eos> Of course I do.
We just need to give him time...<eos> Which means giving the Nazis time.<eos> I'm calling in the strike.<eos> I can't let you do that. You don't have the authority.<eos> Yes, she does.
Hajimemashite.<eos> Can I get you something to drink?<eos> Sake, lots of it.<eos> What he meant to say is thanks for your hospitality, but we must be going.<eos> - No, I didn't.
But I believe in my men.<eos> And I believe in the good that we're doing.<eos> Do you?<eos> Do you believe in your mission, Captain Lance?<eos> I do.
- Absolutely not.<eos> Whatever Darhk is planning to exchange with the Soviets, it can't be good.<eos> Well, I'll contact the FBI.<eos> You don't have to worry about it.<eos> Except we do.
- No, I think I got this.<eos> - But thank you.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Cisco told me you showed up to his bereavement group last night.<eos> Yeah, I did.
- How did you...<eos> - After your not-so-subtle reaction when you first met me...<eos> Harry told me all that happened with Zoom and your mom and your dad, so I decided I'd keep my eye on you for a bit.<eos> - He tell you anything else?<eos> - He did.
We're...<eos> Um... Dad seems fine.<eos> Um, yeah, no, he's still a little weird about it.<eos> You talked to him, though, right?<eos> Um, yeah, I did.
You would barely even look at me.<eos> I...couldn't handle the pain.<eos> My work got me through it.<eos> Losing someone like that, you have no idea what that feels like.<eos> Actually, I do.
Power-- yes, the monster.<eos> That's--ah, you just beat me to it, San Francisco.<eos> See, that can't be it, H.R.<eos> - Can't be it-- - 'Cause we would have detected - a surge in the power grid.<eos> - We did not.
I remembered how we-- you don't think that's something?<eos> Let me present you with a scenario.<eos> You're confronted with something, a threat that you've never seen before.<eos> You don't know how to stop it.<eos> Who does?
That's that me, it's not this me.<eos> And I want to be a speedster.<eos> I... I want to be a flash.<eos> No, no, no, you don't.<eos> Yes, I do.
You'll be fine.<eos> I promise.<eos> Hey, man.<eos> I just wanted to see if you wanted to talk about...<eos> I don't.
So just suit up.<eos> Mm-kay?<eos> Look alive.<eos> We're training to fight aliens by fighting an alien, so...<eos> - Do it.
And then we can talk about how dumb that was.<eos> Okay.<eos> Okay what?<eos> They don't see your potential.<eos> I do.
Great.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> When did, uh, babysitting evidence become part of the job description?<eos> Since I trust you.<eos> You do?
Guessing that's not you.<eos> That's a nice knife.<eos> Maybe I keep it after I kill you.<eos> This doesn't concern you.<eos> Actually, it does.
Victims 3 and 4 were not random.<eos> We think Prometheus is using those names as anagrams to spell out other names.<eos> Adam Hunt, Ted Gaynor, Palmer Cokes, Sachi Beech.<eos> Those names supposed to mean anything to us?<eos> They do to him.
Right.<eos> Well, I got to go, so you guys need to run a DNA test on these ashes and bone fragments to find out who this person was and why Prometheus is keeping their remains.<eos> You guys know how to run a DNA sequencer, right?<eos> No.<eos> Of course you don't.
Well, we've had a BOLO out for weeks.<eos> I'm not talking about a be on the lookout order.<eos> I'm talking about a shoot to kill.<eos> I don't know how that will sit with the public.<eos> I do.
- It's a little hard to believe.<eos> - Is it?<eos> How much did Sheriff Wilkins receive in, uh, campaign donations from Newett Energy last election?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I do.
Yeah.<eos> ...appointments, PAC money, even the gavel...<eos> Wait, you said he called Barneki.<eos> Barneki was the odd man out.<eos> He did.
Maybe I was jealous.<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> - It's this town.<eos> I hate this town.<eos> - And I don't, at the same time.
Bloody T-shirt.<eos> Men's extra-large.<eos> Probably used in an attempt to staunch the bleeding.<eos> Who'd you say the room belonged to?<eos> I didn't.
Aw, you're tough.<eos> Little arsenic in your brew wouldn't have bothered you.<eos> Do you know what gastrointestinal decontamination is?<eos> No.<eos> Okay, well, thanks to your quick call to Pride, neither do I.
I will take my chances.<eos> Okay.<eos> You have my number.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I do.
My memory, it...<eos> I get confused.<eos> I... you don't know what's it's like in my head.<eos> No, no, you're right.<eos> I-I-I don't but...
Luther, what's up?<eos> 'Sup?<eos> 'Sup is you gave my daughter gonorrhea, you little shit stain.<eos> - That's what's up.<eos> - I did?
Oh, well, then you'll enjoy this.<eos> Bernadette does the same thing with you and Koothrappali.<eos> No, she doesn't.<eos> She defends him all the time.<eos> She does not.
♪ Hawaii Five-O 6x20 ♪ Ka Haunaele (Rampage) Original Air Date on April 15, 2016<eos> ♪ And one part passion... ♪<eos> Hey, what's up?<eos> I thought you went to go visit Adam this morning.<eos> I did.
Okay, uh, that's-that's fine.<eos> We think, uh, maybe he wasn't behind it, but he had something to do with it and knows who it was.<eos> As a matter of fact, we're pretty sure your client was the first person contacted after that gun was stolen.<eos> You have any evidence to support these claims?<eos> Yeah, we do.
What's Poopie-- what are you-- you live under a rock?<eos> Poopie Penguin is a game that you play on your cell phone where you're a penguin, and you're flying around in the air, and you poop on people's heads for points.<eos> Penguins don't fly.<eos> No.<eos> They do in my universe.
- How's Mom?<eos> - Good.<eos> Give her a call when you have the chance.<eos> So... you went to the Tax Prom a few nights ago, I hear.<eos> I did, yeah.
Agent Quinn, you know, I don't know if you remember this at all, but you were actually one of my instructors when I first joined NCIS.<eos> You used to love mystery novels.<eos> Used to carry a paperback around in your bag.<eos> Look at this.<eos> Still do.
I saw that.<eos> Oh, yeah?<eos> You saw what?<eos> You do remember her.<eos> Course I do.
I've always envied that about you.<eos> Oh, yeah?<eos> You envy something about me?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I do, Eddie.
For letting me believe my husband fucked Miranda Frank?<eos> Yes.<eos> Why didn't you tell me what you knew?<eos> - I don't know exactly...<eos> - I do.
Guys, isn't it obvious?<eos> Latin prayers, a claw, sulfur... Also known... as brimstone?<eos> Come on, Castle.<eos> Castle, you don't think that...<eos> Oh, but I do.
I got 20 bucks says it's that handsy yogi over there.<eos> I'm going for the Carrot Top Cruella De Vil.<eos> Wait, wait...<eos> Does she look a bit like your first ex-wife?<eos> She kind of does.
Where?<eos> Here.<eos> He and Danny were hanging out.<eos> I thought you knew.<eos> I didn't.
What, so... what are you saying?<eos> Buddy, that baby's yours.<eos> - What?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I did it.
- What?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I did it.<eos> Sure did.<eos> I did it!
What were you doing out there, anyway?<eos> So, I was rehearsing for an audition, to be WNY-8's new weather man.<eos> Cloudy with a chance of Tucker.<eos> Wait, wait. I thought you wanted to be an entertainment reporter?<eos> I do!
Why?<eos> Okay, you know what? Don't ask questions we don't have answers to.<eos> - Let's go, Danny.<eos> - But I don't want to do the weather.<eos> Yes, you do.
But calm down.<eos> You're forgetting something very important.<eos> She's not into me.<eos> You don't know that.<eos> Well, I do now.
Aunt Nancie and Uncle Marshall, this is Erin.<eos> She's a detective.<eos> She helped me a lot.<eos> So, Doc, how did you know the girl was gonna remember the shooter?<eos> I didn't.
Cool.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Cool.<eos> You know, I don't remember the last time it was just you and me hanging out.<eos> Oh, I do.
So if we would have asked you to come to Vegas to see us get married, you would've come?<eos> No, I would've said you're making a huge mistake.<eos> But an invitation would've been nice.<eos> You really think we made a mistake?<eos> At the time I did.
- Okay, all Iâm saying is that you can take this and turn it into something new.<eos> Sylvia's place.<eos> Get rid of all these old ghosts and make it your own.<eos> - Harold, you said you would help me get the fuck out of here.<eos> Please, just do that.
It... it feels like it's sleeping.<eos> Hmm.<eos> You know what I think?<eos> I think this is a very broken wrist.<eos> I do too.
Flying's such a hassle these days.<eos> As soon as we can, we'll get you out of the ICU and into a room... one with a view.<eos> Hey, easy there.<eos> Dr. Rhodes... You know what I'm facing.<eos> I do.
Present arms.<eos> Order arms.<eos> Fall out.<eos> I did not save lives today.<eos> You did.
A little sexy time?<eos> Not at all.<eos> Did you know that "Jenga" is the Swahili word for "build"?<eos> And that Candy Land was invented by a school teacher recovering from polio?<eos> I did not.
Bye.<eos> Yup, it's separation anxiety, all right.<eos> Come on, you deserve it, Jane.<eos> Let's do this!<eos> Okay, I did it.
Bye. Bye.<eos> Mommy would love to play with you, but she's got to work.<eos> Bye, bye, baby.<eos> Well, I not thinking Jane is perfect, not at all.<eos> Rafael does.
Look, the feds are useless.<eos> They're never gonna catch Figgis, so I'm working the case.<eos> I want to get home and see Amy.<eos> Don't you want to see Kevin?<eos> Of course I do.
How did the snake removal go?<eos> Eeeee! It was good.<eos> It was good.<eos> Ms. Karfton, you don't know us, but...<eos> Uh, yeah, I do.
Hey, look, look, look, I'm still wearing your necklace.<eos> Why I be wearing it if I didn't want to be with you?<eos> What about Mat, huh?<eos> You don't love him?<eos> No, I... I don't.
Come on!<eos> Your amends?<eos> He's the guy that got you into drugs in the first place.<eos> He didn't make me an addict.<eos> I did that.
- Good night, my babies.<eos> Idiot.<eos> I know what I saw.<eos> You really want that?<eos> Yeah, I really do.
He killed that lady, right?<eos> He was found guilty, but we don't think he was given a fair trial.<eos> Kyle says he was with you at the rec center on the day that Mrs. Johnson was murdered. And you were watching a Clippers game.<eos> Do you remember that?<eos> Yeah, I do.
Just came to watch you lose.<eos> Oh yeah?<eos> Well, you're gonna be very disappointed.<eos> - So, you got a hanging arm?<eos> - Yeah, we do.
There's just one problem.<eos> - Our arm doesn't work. - Wait.<eos> Are you kidding me?<eos> But here's the thing: Palomar doesn't think it works.<eos> - Because it doesn't.
Brant Country Day, Anchor Beach, and High Tech LA came from defeat<eos> - with a dramatic last-second win!<eos> - with a dramatic last-second win!<eos> So, the strategy that we used was to tell everybody that the arm worked.<eos> - Uh, because it did? - Uh, because it did?
What do you think?<eos> He's a nut-job, it doesn't make him a murderer.<eos> So, did you figure out your room situation?<eos> Uh...<eos> Yeah, I did.
I missed you.<eos> I'm so glad... you're home.<eos> Where are you going?<eos> You fell asleep.<eos> No, I didn't.
You know, before the quarantine was in place in St. Louis, it was just me and 115 people in a Costco.<eos> But I was able to protect them, because they wanted more than anything to be there.<eos> Not like those broken people we saw in that shelter.<eos> Back then, ‭the people wanted to fight.<eos> They still do, sir.
You're the sweetest man I have ever known and I never want to spend another night without you.<eos> Adam Foley, will you marry me?<eos> Again?<eos> Whoa, I did not see this coming.<eos> I did.
Oh, thank God you realized it!<eos> Elliot, let it go.<eos> We all made mistakes out there.<eos> Alan didn't save you.<eos> And I did.
Elliot!<eos> You're okay!<eos> I was in the bathroom when I heard the announcement, so I panicked and hid in the tub!<eos> I can't believe you came up here to save me.<eos> Of course I did!
Honestly, I would choose to stay home if I could, but when my sister was ill, we took on her medical bills, and it drained our savings.<eos> So I work during the day, and I study for the bar at night.<eos> I never meant it to affect my children this way.<eos> Do you know who broke into our house?<eos> Yeah, we do.
I remember this one day, before he was gonna leave, I accidentally fell out of a tree, broke my arm.<eos> I was, uh, I was six years old and, uh, I remember my arm was killing me, but, uh, I was smiling all the way to the E.R.<eos> 'Cause you didn't think he'd leave if you were hurt.<eos> Exactly.<eos> Did he?
Which is exactly why I conducted an off-the-book investigation.<eos> All my operatives were cleared.<eos> The leak did not come from MI6, it came from NCIS.<eos> And why didn't you relay this information to Morrow?<eos> I did.
Once Holden had confessed to murder, to rape,<eos> Roland felt like that we should just cut George loose, cut all the kids loose.<eos> But before that?<eos> Before you cut 'em all loose, before Daniel broke, did you question Trey about George's claim of rape by Holden?<eos> Roland did.
And what was Trey's response?<eos> - Just sat there.<eos> - Sat there?<eos> Finally, he asked Roland to repeat what George had said about seeing Daniel rape Hanna.<eos> And Roland did.
He's in the backyard, mulching.<eos> Do you mind being back there with us?<eos> I think it might help.<eos> If you want me to.<eos> I do.
That's good.<eos> I hope you can enjoy a nice day once in a while too now, Jon.<eos> Maybe.<eos> Did you really quit Justice Row?<eos> I did.
See you around sometime.<eos> See you around.<eos> Hey!<eos> I got you.<eos> You did.
I mean down here, in Paulie.<eos> The truth may be finding the light after all these years.<eos> Did you know that Harry Nilsson and John Lennon made a record together?<eos> No.<eos> I didn't.
The truth may be finding the light after all these years.<eos> Did you know that Harry Nilsson and John Lennon made a record together?<eos> No.<eos> I didn't.<eos> Neither did I.
That really is.<eos> Women... they're what makes this world go around.<eos> They can sure make the world feel like it's got some kind of direction, yes.<eos> Sounds like you cared a lot about this lady, Dan.<eos> I did, Tyrus.
Women... they're what makes this world go around.<eos> They can sure make the world feel like it's got some kind of direction, yes.<eos> Sounds like you cared a lot about this lady, Dan.<eos> I did, Tyrus.<eos> I still do.
Did you call the police?<eos> - No.<eos> - Why not?<eos> It didn't occur to me.<eos> What did you do?
That was my voice.<eos> And I did care.<eos> I thought death would be too easy for you, too easy an escape.<eos> And I didn't want you to cheat the system.<eos> And I still don't.
- Oh, Jesus.<eos> - He's been sent home with his arm in a cast.<eos> Given that you're less likely to develop post-traumatic stress disorder if you don't sleep after a bad experience, maybe I should... keep you awake a wee bit longer at least.<eos> Don't you have a home to go to?<eos> I do.
Oh, no, no, no, no, no. No.<eos> Hey. Um, did you want to order?<eos> No, I'm good.<eos> And you have a consult, right?<eos> - Yeah, I do. Yeah.
We were just playing.<eos> It went off.<eos> Did I kill him?<eos> No.<eos> Peter, no, you didn't.
That's where we'd need it.<eos> I don't want a gun in my house.<eos> It's my house, too.<eos> It makes me feel safer.<eos> - Does it?
They pick up everything you do.<eos> I'm very sorry that this happened.<eos> Hey.<eos> Brandon didn't die?<eos> No. He didn't.
- No, I love them like...<eos> If something happened to them, I would die.<eos> Like, my heart is so wide open, and they're so fragile.<eos> I don't know how you live like this.<eos> I don't.
"Just forget about him.<eos> Walk away.<eos> Just get on a chopper and come to me."<eos> I told my sister to get on that helicopter.<eos> I did it.
You didn't mean to.<eos> Got a late one, huh?<eos> I do. Everything okay?<eos> I wondered if you wanted to go in the morning to the OB.<eos> O-Of course I do.
No, that is not what I meant.<eos> But that is what you said.<eos> All right, Counselor.<eos> I know what grade she's in.<eos> I do.
This all sucks.<eos> Come on, Sofia, honey.<eos> You had a really good time with her yesterday, okay?<eos> - Unh-unh.<eos> - Yes! You did.
So, who's watching your daughters right now while you're here?<eos> Their Aunt Amelia.<eos> You recently lost your husband.<eos> Is that correct?<eos> I did.
That's correct, yes.<eos> You go and play, drink, and flirt with women... is that correct?<eos> - No, it isn't.<eos> - I'm married and I don't drink.<eos> So Dr. Robbins did all the drinking and flirting.
No, I didn't "come around. "<eos> I'm Sofia's mother.<eos> I legally adopted her.<eos> She doesn't want to go there.<eos> No, she doesn't.
- Well, did he cut the cord?<eos> - No, but he's close.<eos> Tell him not to.<eos> Damn it!<eos> I did.
- I'm aware.<eos> - Counseling?<eos> Well, if we go to counseling, then we'll have to talk, and then we'll yell, so not talking is better.<eos> So, what are you gonna do?<eos> - Do?
What?<eos> Two days?<eos> A week?<eos> - We both know how this ends.<eos> - No, I don't.
Two days?<eos> A week?<eos> - We both know how this ends.<eos> - No, I don't.<eos> But apparently you do, so...
Come on tour with me for like a month.<eos> I'm a surgeon, not a groupie.<eos> Come on.<eos> You know you want to see me play.<eos> I do, actually.
And she's standing there with these sad eyes like she's the victim.<eos> She's not the victim.<eos> Callie caused all this, she set it all in motion, and now here we are and there's not one part of it that doesn't suck, you know?<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - Yeah, I do.
Because I seem to remember her telling both of us where to shove it.<eos> Luci, you don't think she helped Mom escape, do you?<eos> Well, that doesn't sound like the kind of evil, duplicitous thing a demon would do, now, does it?<eos> But, no, I don't because I found Mum.<eos> You did?
Damn right I do.<eos> Lucifer.<eos> We don't have an appointment.<eos> No.<eos> No, we don't. I, uh...
You made me want it, and then you took it away.<eos> You have to believe me when I say how sorry I am, and that I know I screwed up.<eos> But honestly, I did it for you.<eos> Because I believed in you so much...<eos> - No, you didn't.
But honestly, I did it for you.<eos> Because I believed in you so much...<eos> - No, you didn't.<eos> - You know I did.<eos> - Y-You didn't.
You think this is about me getting power.<eos> See, unlike you, I've had power, achieved greatness.<eos> This is about Jake finally stepping forward and accepting his own greatness.<eos> He doesn't want it.<eos> He never did.
Whatever I did, I can make it up to you, I promise.<eos> It's not gonna work out, Tom.<eos> Hey!<eos> You made it!<eos> We did.
- You should call the cops.<eos> - No.<eos> No! Wait.<eos> Not until I have something real. I thought you understood that.<eos> I do.
Going there tonight made no sense.<eos> I asked you to trust me.<eos> So, trust me.<eos> I have to figure this out, and I really need you to understand that.<eos> I do.
♪ I can't live without your touch ♪ Congrats, bro.<eos> ♪ Cold without so much ♪ Hey.<eos> Hey.<eos> You don't actually believe him, do you?<eos> Actually, I do.
You said he should be made to testify.<eos> Against whom?<eos> Against whoever hired him, obviously.<eos> You already know who it is.<eos> I do not.
All you did was put me down.<eos> For God's sakes, that was just me kibitzing.<eos> That's what I do, I kibitz.<eos> You still never said you were proud of me.<eos> Yeah, I did.
For God's sakes, that was just me kibitzing.<eos> That's what I do, I kibitz.<eos> You still never said you were proud of me.<eos> Yeah, I did.<eos> No, you didn't.
We're not so much about blame here.<eos> Thankfully, Henry has been really open to giving it a try, so...<eos> We do not need couples therapy.<eos> I-I know you think it's going to be hooey.<eos> I did, too.
- Technically, I didn't.<eos> - Yeah, I proposed to him.<eos> - Mmm, no. - Mm-hmm?<eos> Technically, you didn't either.<eos> - Yes, I did.
We've got 35%, and then there's Diane and Bos and Doug and Craig.<eos> And Cameron has no idea this is happening?<eos> It's all talk at the moment, but I...<eos> We don't own 35% of the company.<eos> - Yeah, sure we do.
Things are moving fast, faster than I ever imagined they would.<eos> It's an exciting time.<eos> But we are at a crossroads and we have a decision to make... together.<eos> I know you all want to move forward on the IPO.<eos> I do, too.
that's courage.<eos> It's been a privilege, to see first-hand why the people you lead love you the way they do.<eos> But sadly, our time together has come to an end.<eos> On this case. You don't mean...<eos> I do.
Trying to turn this whole thing around on me, huh?<eos> See you dudes later.<eos> Good luck with that cough.<eos> You do trust me, right?<eos> Yeah. Of course I do.
Just doing this out of the kindness of your heart. - I like it.<eos> - Till I get my registration.<eos> I got to keep a little safe distance.<eos> - Come on, you know the game.<eos> - Yeah, I do.
I was calling disco, discounting the play. Telling Kevin we're going off reservation. Really?<eos> Man, you went outlaw just like that?<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> Wow, Coach Fisher really must have faith in you. Yeah.<eos> Yeah, he really did.
What?<eos> NFLPA doesn't want you handling their players' money.<eos> Said that you were not a qualified custodian.<eos> I got it in writing, actually.<eos> And now you do, too.
Which is why it's important for us to find your grandson.<eos> Don't you want Tariq off the streets?<eos> Willis says one cross-eyed word about Tariq in that courtroom, and he might as well be shooting himself in the head.<eos> Mrs. Stratton, I understand where you're coming from.<eos> No, you don't.
'Cause I'm a cop, and this is a court order.<eos> You know what's gonna happen if you take me in there, make me testify?<eos> They're gonna kill me, Anthony, and not quick either.<eos> Look, we don't know that.<eos> Yes, you do.
Yeah.<eos> Well, so would I.<eos> He did it, Erin.<eos> You don't know that.<eos> Of course I do.
Think, Garrett.<eos> I'm on to you, you know.<eos> There's no way you were ever gonna cancel that party.<eos> You don't know that.<eos> Yes, I do.
I don't want the job.<eos> Why you got to waste my time, Nate?<eos> All right, wait, wait, wait.<eos> Francis knows you.<eos> I don't.
Aigoo, my darling eat deliciously.<eos> Dong Yi, are you still picking bottles and selling it?<eos> Why aren't you listen me?<eos> Just like a begger.<eos> You did it too!
I was overwhelmed, there was so much going on, and my grandma pointed out it wasn't so much for him as it was for us.<eos> Yeah, so what if it was for us?<eos> I mean, we got him through a whole year.<eos> Don't we deserve to celebrate that?<eos> Yeah, we do.
I'm looking for office space.<eos> Jacob Nighthorse hired me to open a legal-aid center.<eos> You are working for Jacob?<eos> Does Walt know about this?<eos> He does.
Okay.<eos> I'm sorry if this is a little direct, but does Vincent have a gambling problem?<eos> No, I don't think so.<eos> You didn't know he was at the casino either night?<eos> No, I didn't.
Malachi's loan-sharking and mugging scheme may have just escalated.<eos> Okay, you have no proof of this "scheme."<eos> I won't, either, as long as Malachi's the one in charge of investigating himself.<eos> You have any other theories right now, aside from these insane levels of corruption in my organization?<eos> I do.
I would've found the place... eventually.<eos> Finding the place was not my concern.<eos> Your safety was.<eos> You love me like a father, don't you?<eos> Yes, I do.
Or do you have some follow-up questions concerning your boss's private life?<eos> [Vic] Thanks... you know, for coming down to my level and granting me a response.<eos> But while we're on the topic of not understanding what Walt sees in other people, let me be unsubtle.<eos> I have no idea what makes you worthy of him.<eos> I really don't.
I'm not doing good here, man.<eos> Everything's a frigging joke to you.<eos> Okay.<eos> You want honesty?<eos> Yeah, I do.
Your shower uses coconut water?<eos> All of the plumbing uses coconut water.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> Of course not.<eos> You never do.
I understand.<eos> Thank you, Your Honour.<eos> This is most unusual.<eos> Given the circumstances, you intend to stay at the bar table, do you?<eos> Ah, indeed I do, Your Honour.
I suppose so.<eos> Wasn't logged with all the hubbub that night.<eos> No, it wasn't, was it?<eos> Doesn't it strike you odd the Germans all of a sudden became so cooperative after they blamed us for everything... the mall, losava's rendition?<eos> Now it does.
We don't like to confuse "offer" with "choice," unless you've decided to really hang up your jockstrap.<eos> You work with this guy?<eos> Every blessed day.<eos> But he kinda grows on you, believe it or not.<eos> I do.
Why?<eos> Why?<eos> So you can clean up the last of the evidence, find Shaw, and then kill him?<eos> Do your colleagues... do they even know about this, Hans?<eos> Do they?
Don't hide behind that.<eos> You fucked me over for months... months... while you smiled in my face.<eos> I wake each morning feeling breath on the back of my neck.<eos> - You feel it, too.<eos> - No, I don't.
But they know better than to mistreat Steven.<eos> He gave me this for you.<eos> - Do you mind taking a drive?<eos> This is a file on Zoltan Vasile, the Romanian who kidnapped Aleksandre Iosava, the man the Germans think that Steven hired.<eos> Well, did he?
Yeah.<eos> Probably does.<eos> Germany's interests are more important than your feelings.<eos> Didn't you tell me that?<eos> Of course I did.
Okay.<eos> I'm an American diplomat.<eos> We got company.<eos> I swear to God, if this doesn't work out, - I'll fucking kill Hector.<eos> - And if it does?
Gabi, it's Josh, your former boss.<eos> And other stuff.<eos> Oh. Hi, Josh. It's, uh, me, Gabi, which... you know 'cause you called me.<eos> So did you get the invite to Yolanda's birthday?<eos> I did.
Tonight.<eos> I went to your office when you were sleeping, and I asked you, and you said yes.<eos> No, no, no, no, no, no.<eos> A "yes" when I'm asleep does not count.<eos> It doesn't?
And it's giving birth right now!<eos> - Aww! - Ew!<eos> Well, what are we gonna do?<eos> I don't know how to deliver a piglet.<eos> Yeah, neither do I.
Did you dump her?<eos> Oh, I bet you dumped her, didn't you?<eos> You're such<eos> - a heartbreaker. - I feel like I walked into something.<eos> 'Cause you did.
Hey?<eos> No.<eos> Do you intend on keeping your word?<eos> Yes.<eos> I do.
That's it, then.<eos> His watch.<eos> Anything resembling the ticking will trigger the impulse.<eos> He's made you a prisoner in your own skin.<eos> He did it to you.
His family name.<eos> You mean Falcone.<eos> You knew?<eos> You knew and you didn't say anything?<eos> Sure I did.
A man who knows his limits but isn't afraid to fail.<eos> A man who knows when to ask for help when he needs it.<eos> Now... I-I wasn't always that man, but damn, that didn't stop me from trying.<eos> - I don't know how to be that man.<eos> - Well, sure you do.
It was an accident that I deeply regret.<eos> And I was not gonna tell you this, but then...<eos> Edward,<eos> I know what you did.<eos> You do?
But I'm not gonna let him go.<eos> He loves me.<eos> And I love him.<eos> Do you know how rare that is, Mr. Mayor?<eos> Of course you do.
If a person comes into contact with my blood, it changes them.<eos> You and I are gonna make a difference in this city.<eos> We're gonna clean it up.<eos> Sentence served. Symon.<eos> Who did this?
Ask your questions, Gordon.<eos> Did you see Symon at the party?<eos> Yes.<eos> - Did you talk to him?<eos> - No, I did not.
You see, I know that you've been investigating me, Jim.<eos> - Did you kill Symon?<eos> - Is that what he told you?<eos> I know he said something to you before he died.<eos> Yes, he did.
Someone paid 'em off.<eos> The question is, who?<eos> Who has that kind of money and influence?<eos> You don't know.<eos> But I do.
I feel like this office is cursed.<eos> You think Barnes'll be all right?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I'm sorry I doubted you.<eos> You didn't.
We are called the Whisper Gang.<eos> Gotham's most notorious smugglers.<eos> We used to number in the hundreds until the Court saw our growing strength, and they offered us a partnership, only to betray us.<eos> Many escaped back to Ukraine but a few of us stayed back, hoping to find a way to enact revenge.<eos> And we did.
I brought new threats to our world, and I'm the only one fast enough to stop them.<eos> I am The Flash.<eos> Previously on "The Flash"...<eos> They don't see your potential.<eos> I do.
I mean, that a scare-a-thon, wasn't it?<eos> I'm gonna have a mint tea and a coffee and a lay down.<eos> Do you think the things that he said about one of us betraying him and one of us dying could really be true?<eos> I mean, if it really was future Barry that pissed him off and locked him up somewhere, then maybe he knows what happens to future us.<eos> He doesn't.
- For what?<eos> It's a surprise.<eos> Enzo!<eos> You came back to me.<eos> Of course I did.
Looks like someone's taking charge.<eos> Why are we stopping here?<eos> Because I have been with you for roughly five hours, and in that time you've almost been captured by the bumbling human authorities, not once... twice.<eos> On the plus side, I'm happy to see that there's some wiggle room in this arrangement of eternal servitude. So, let's do this.<eos> - Hmm? - Do what?
In Monterey.<eos> I don't remember doing this.<eos> Recognize him?<eos> That you showed remorse meant nothing to me.<eos> But for some reason, it did to her.
I'll tell you how!<eos> I wasn't thinking!<eos> And now look what... - You said "our daughter."<eos> - No, I didn't.<eos> Yes, you did.
It's just... (sighs) I've never had a daughter before.<eos> Yeah, well, I've never had two dads before.<eos> Aw, she called us "dads"!<eos> - No, I didn't.<eos> - Yes, you did.
She's always traveling.<eos> Doesn't always tell me when.<eos> Did she tell you she was bonking her associate bradley?<eos> Lucifer.<eos> Did she?
He deserved what happened to him.<eos> Yeah, but you're not answering the question.<eos> Did you kill Nick?<eos> I understand punishment all too well, Tommy, and Nick deserved to be punished.<eos> He did, didn't he?
I-I like seeing them beg for forgiveness.<eos> You see, the difference between us is that you became part of the problem, Ray.<eos> Someone deserving punishment.<eos> You're right.<eos> I do.
You see, the difference between us is that you became part of the problem, Ray.<eos> Someone deserving punishment.<eos> You're right.<eos> I do.<eos> We all do.
More importantly, you get to keep your word.<eos> I am keeping my word.<eos> You're serving out your sentence here on Earth.<eos> You know that's not what your Father wanted.<eos> Do I?
Maybe you're not as good at this as you thought.<eos> Maybe I'm building up to a big finale.<eos> All right.<eos> Uriel... you don't know what Dad wants.<eos> None of us do.
None of us do.<eos> - So I think...<eos> - You're right.<eos> I don't know what Dad wants.<eos> None of us do.
I'll buy the first round.<eos> But I do know what he needs.<eos> Mom's out. It's only a matter of time before she finds her way back to Heaven, and then he'll forgive her.<eos> - He would never do that.<eos> - Why not? You did.
A sex swing is not furniture.<eos> We have to agree on what's gonna be in the common area, Maze.<eos> Fine, I don't agree with your cheesy decorations.<eos> You don't like Halloween?<eos> Of course I do.
Chest?<eos> Shooter didn't go for the head?<eos> First rule of zombie killing.<eos> Do you want to work this case with me or not?<eos> Of course I do.
They're a husband and wife team.<eos> Great. Who's the target?<eos> Well, it could be either one.<eos> We got to get to both of them.<eos> Yeah, before he does.
I'm a monster.<eos> A monster who... deserves to be punished.<eos> I believe you feel that way.<eos> And I want to understand.<eos> I truly do!
All good.<eos> Just on my way out.<eos> Something's seriously bothering her.<eos> Oh, I hadn't noticed.<eos> But you did.
My father was killed across the city in Korea town.<eos> There's no way your father could have recorded this and gotten to the crime scene in time.<eos> So it's true. He didn't do it.<eos> Which means whoever did kill my father got away with this and is still out there.<eos> I did it.
Detective Dan and I won't rest until we get to the bottom of this, I promise you.<eos> Wow. Look who bought a ticket to the gun show!<eos> Divorce becomes you, Detective.<eos> I do not sound like that.<eos> Of course we do.
Like that.<eos> Hello there.<eos> Uh, I'd like to talk with you, if I may.<eos> - I don't know you.<eos> - You don't.
Los Angeles on this thrill ride tour.<eos> Well, it appears I've been misled.<eos> Whoever put together this brochure should get special treatment in Hell.<eos> I don't need you to show me around the city.<eos> Well, of course you do.
Let's see.<eos> Who could've told her?<eos> Detective, I didn't.<eos> You say that, but you also said your relationship with Charlotte wouldn't affect this trial.<eos> It just did.
Mm.<eos> If only I knew who really gave Mom that information.<eos> Right. If only.<eos> Oh! Good. You came.<eos> Yes, he did.
Oh...<eos> To see you, actually.<eos> I believe I owe you dinner.<eos> Now we know why Chloe's so special.<eos> Don't we?
One stayed back at a five-star hotel, where he's getting some room service sent up by me right now.<eos> And if you like, I can send your boys outside a snack, too.<eos> Don't forget I do this, Shine.<eos> No, you don't do this, Lucious.<eos> I do this.
It's cloaked.<eos> It's very powerful.<eos> You brought your mother?<eos> Hello, Castiel.<eos> Yes, he did.
Rehearsal.<eos> Brother, are you okay?<eos> Yeah, I just can't make it to rehearsal.<eos> Yeah, you got better plans?<eos> I do.
I --<eos> Yeah, but you were right.<eos> You know, those kids were innocent.<eos> I mean, hell, we didn't even know what Moriarty's deal was.<eos> I do.
Eat! Elijah, do not eat that.<eos> Elijah!<eos> Mom?<eos> Eat.<eos> Elijah, do not do it.
The water's off.<eos> - She knew it.<eos> You knew that.<eos> - Oh, come on.<eos> What did you do?
Then you want me to make this vessel permanent?<eos> Strong enough to hold you?<eos> Does look good on me.<eos> Festina!<eos> Red, what did you do?
I know that you're just some... some spoiled-ass rich kid.<eos> But you know everything 'cause your mom's a junkie?<eos> Okay, you didn't have to say that.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Neither did you.
It's a Japanese land bomb type 80.<eos> I'll get the specs to you.<eos> And I'll need a second, someone with engineering skill, someone I can trust.<eos> I don't know anyone like that.<eos> I do.
- You're sure?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> She was here a while back, though.<eos> Please tell me you remember who she was with.<eos> Yeah, I do.
- It's actually a camera.<eos> - Yeah, it's a Polaroid.<eos> Whoa.<eos> You like taking pictures, right?<eos> Yeah, I do.
Why?<eos> Well, you know, that's how you know that you're in love.<eos> Is it?<eos> Nope, don't feel a thing.<eos> - You do now, right?
Hey, Dad.<eos> Heat up your dinner.<eos> It's been sitting there for a while, so it only needs a minute.<eos> I wanted to tell you.<eos> I really did.
Hey.<eos> You don't need to do that with me... or with Helen.<eos> Yeah, okay.<eos> No.<eos> I don't... no.
- I don't know.<eos> I guess I thought if I didn't say anything then maybe it never happened.<eos> You know, maybe she never jumped.<eos> Does that make any sense?<eos> Yeah, it does.
What's the prognosis?<eos> They got him stable, but he's in a coma.<eos> And they're moving him to an ICU.<eos> You know this could have happened on anyone's watch, right?<eos> Yeah, but it didn't.
Did you know that you snore very loudly?<eos> No, I don't.<eos> - You do.<eos> - No, I don't.<eos> - Oh, yeah, you do.
Too bad I missed the shit show.<eos> - No, I got work in the morning.<eos> - Well, I need it... after Sierra ripped me a new one.<eos> I don't want to know.<eos> I do.
The lease.<eos> You'd give me 80,000 for this place?<eos> I never thought it was worth that much.<eos> Do you remember our conversation yesterday?<eos> Of course I do.
Now I want to see one running live.<eos> You know there are more possible moves in Go than there are atoms in the observable universe?<eos> Just a bunch of little stones on a piece of wood.<eos> I think people like you and me, we need facts like that to remind us of our own insignificance.<eos> Don't you?
The woman I live with keeps elastic bands on a door knob in case they come in handy.<eos> Who does that?<eos> Karen or Beatrice?<eos> You once told me... that you liked sitting in a parked car in the rain.<eos> Well, who does, which you?
Why didn't you tell me?<eos> Because I didn't know if I could trust you.<eos> That's bullshit.<eos> Because... you liked me and I didn't want you to stop.<eos> Well, I didn't.
I mean, there's a lot of good options.<eos> Yeah, I-I-I don't know if any of that really jibes with my overall message.<eos> You have an overall message?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Do I?
That's why you're here.<eos> Wha...?<eos> I have no idea what's going on.<eos> It's Washington.<eos> Who does?
Yeah, I forgot.<eos> Um, yeah, and he got down on one knee and-and... the whole restaurant was watching.<eos> - Oh! - They all applauded when I said yes.<eos> Wow, because you said yes.<eos> Of course you did, with that ring.
It is the most detailed.<eos> There's emotional violence.<eos> I think this drawing means something special.<eos> He invented it?<eos> No, he didn't.
Correct.<eos> So they only two people that are married is Svetlana and Yvon?<eos> Yes, Kev.<eos> We all understand what's going on.<eos> - I kind of don't.
Silas Turner?<eos> Excuse me.<eos> You're being selfish.<eos> Did you know that?<eos> Did you?
- Yes, sir.<eos> Both Kyoko and her husband have the virus and the cure in their bloodstream.<eos> - The cure is just not working. - Then you need to run more tests.<eos> Sir, now that Dr. Scott's lab is broken down, I don't have the equipment to do extensive blood work.<eos> And even if I did...
We'll grab some more colors, a couple of lattes, and then we'll come right back.<eos> (quietly):<eos> You can trust her.<eos> (in normal voice):<eos> I do.
That's all right.<eos> I'm not gonna sleep, Dad.<eos> Look, it's gonna be fine, Junior.<eos> You do know that, right?<eos> No, actually, I don't.
Something I never forgot.<eos> You asked,<eos> "What happens when the best agents in the world want to accomplish something?"<eos> "They get it done."<eos> Damn right they do.
I'm here.<eos> DiNozzo.<eos> I had no idea she'd be in the farmhouse.<eos> You know that.<eos> Do I?
(chuckles) Why did I ask?<eos> I know how much...<eos> Ziva... really loved you.<eos> And I need to know that you know that, too.<eos> I do.
Cool. Just out of curiosity, Jess, why couldn't you marry me?<eos> Oh, I don't know.<eos> Come on, Jess.<eos> You know.<eos> No, I don't.
Come on, Jess.<eos> You know.<eos> No, I don't.<eos> Yes, you do. I mean, I know.<eos> You do?
- Got it.<eos> Schmidt's asleep.<eos> Got it.<eos> No, you're putting weird emphasis on weird syllables.<eos> - You do it.
- I think it's a pashmina.<eos> - "Pashomina"?<eos> Pashmina.<eos> I'm sorry, I just can't believe you came.<eos> I did.
I wanted him to have a plan for his life and not keep his money in a box in his closet.<eos> And... he wanted me to not care about those things. That's not so bad. I mean, who really has a plan for their life?<eos> Who does that?<eos> Me.<eos> Me. I d... I did it.
No, I wasn't with her.<eos> Then where were you?<eos> To be honest with you, I don't even remember leaving my room.<eos> I had too much to drink.<eos> We all did.
They're not sexual?<eos> Let me help you, Liberty.<eos> Why, thank you, kind sir.<eos> Self-reliance, that's my motto.<eos> Do it yourself.
This bitch knows where you sleep, what you eat, what you shit!<eos> She want to fuck us up and nobody's doing that to me!<eos> It's for your brother.<eos> It's just food, I have nothing to do with this war.<eos> You do now.
On your knees, the three of you!<eos> I knew you'd run off eventually.<eos> Right?<eos> Do you know the penalty for treason?<eos> Do you?
While we're at it ask God where He's been all this time, huh?<eos> To hell with Spain!<eos> This is for you, a letter of exemplary conduct.<eos> Is this a joke?<eos> I did one for each man.
I'll call him later.<eos> Excuse me!<eos> Did you happen to know...<eos> that he's going through some trouble lately?<eos> You didn't.
Come on.<eos> Kill me.<eos> Kill me like you killed that kid.<eos> Well, I suppose I could.<eos> Do it.
Kill me like you killed that kid.<eos> Well, I suppose I could.<eos> Do it.<eos> But then I'd be saving you... from a life in prison.<eos> Do it. Do it!
Okay, but that's not the way it works, and you all know that.<eos> Search of his apartment came up empty.<eos> The guy's good at covering his tracks.<eos> That's because a snake never leaves tracks.<eos> Actually, they do.
He does what he wants, and he doesn't care what people think.<eos> Listening to Bowie gave me the courage to come out.<eos> And everyone just accepted you?<eos> Of course not.<eos> But Cricket did.
Four can be my backup.<eos> He's a better pilot.<eos> Gear up.<eos> If it makes you feel any better, I think she's just doing this so I'll be complicit in the deal.<eos> It doesn't.
I'll say it.<eos> I'm sorry I turned you in.<eos> It was a mistake.<eos> Didn't know who I was.<eos> Now I do.
"I need to get laid" is totally private.<eos> "Get laid"?<eos> Who taught you that?<eos> Dad, I know kids in school giving handjobs in the parking lot.<eos> No, you don't.
What did she say?<eos> No, don't worry.<eos> We're fine.<eos> We're fine.<eos> No, no, what did she...?
- Distracting him.<eos> - He tell you that?<eos> No, no.<eos> He doesn't know what you're about.<eos> I do.
Yes.<eos> We need your help.<eos> We don't know what we're dealing with here.<eos> And we don't have the equipment.<eos> The CDC does.
Got your regular order right here.<eos> Not today, Henry.<eos> I'm trying out a new rifle.<eos> You got any .338 Lapua Magnum?<eos> Sure we do.
It was funny, okay?<eos> And I can see if I'd done it myself, then that would be a bit weird, but I'm not mental.<eos> You wished she was dead.<eos> Well, uh...<eos> No, no, I didn't.
- Yeah.<eos> - Hey, Ella?<eos> Yes, Thomas?<eos> Did you get that washing out of the machine?<eos> - No, I did not.
Out.<eos> Since when?<eos> Since she went t' Bodrugan's party.<eos> Did she say she would stay the night?<eos> Did she?
It's quite possible that her marriage will still go ahead.<eos> No doubt you did your best to prevent it.<eos> No doubt I did.<eos> So does she love George, then?<eos> No, she does not.
Okay.<eos> Well... good night.<eos> You want to come by for a night cap?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, I do.
If this is true, she can tell us when Limón and Escobar go somewhere.<eos> You were there.<eos> You trust her?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, I do.
Now, we hope you like our tent.<eos> We think the great thing is that because it roams around the world, we get a different view out of the big picture windows every week.<eos> So this week, obviously we've got the high desert of California.<eos> - Next week, who knows?<eos> - I do.
Better than that, rather brilliantly, we have made a bespoke version of that sting for every single episode we're gonna make for the next three years.<eos> How about that?<eos> But hold on.<eos> The slight problem with that is that we were so busy doing that we didn't think actually of anything to talk about.<eos> - We did. - Yeah.
Enough.<eos> He landed on Earth last night in a Kryptonian pod.<eos> We don't know who he is.<eos> Did you try using a Quantum scan to determine his age?<eos> First thing we did.
What the hell?<eos> I thought you two might show up.<eos> You spoil all the fun.<eos> You know, if you were expecting us to show up, you really should've brought something a little more powerful.<eos> I did.
I'll have Agent Danvers on hand.<eos> This Corben doesn't seem like he cares who gets hurt so long as he gets his target.<eos> Kara and I will be there, too.<eos> Don't you think you two should talk?<eos> Apparently, you do.
No one's going to recognize you.<eos> Commander Truffault.<eos> Commander Nieman.<eos> We meet again.<eos> Yes, we do.
What are you doing?<eos> Felix sent him to spy on me.<eos> Oscar, we're supposed to be having dinner.<eos> Didn't you get my text?<eos> Uh, yeah, I did.
So in short, that was one hell of a shot.<eos> That it was.<eos> You think the enemy feels the same?<eos> I don't really give a shit what the enemy thinks.<eos> Well, I do.
You can't win a war that hasn't started.<eos> People need to wake the hell up, and we're gonna wake them.<eos> Joey, we got a situation.<eos> You got eyes on Swagger?<eos> God damn right, I do.
Do you want to fool around?<eos> I don't.<eos> - Ah. - Uh... - Okay.<eos> - No, I...<eos> No, I-I do.
- No, I...<eos> No, I-I do.<eos> It's just been a long time since this has even been an option.<eos> Hey. I know, I know.<eos> Um, you don't.
Was.<eos> I don't follow baseball much anymore.<eos> Yeah, but still, you got to love watching the Yanks get slapped around, right?<eos> The Yankees?<eos> Who doesn't?
Did you paint a shadow on your face?<eos> I was dressed up in blackface earlier.<eos> You're not the only one with stuff going on.<eos> Looks like you finally figured out the story.<eos> No, I didn't.
- You drugged me? !<eos> Dad, you're out of time.<eos> Maybe this will rewire your mind, help you improvise and beat Bullock.<eos> I haven't had mushroom tea in ages.<eos> You did it last weekend at the Sheraton Hotel... ton Hotel bar.
So, why are you out here? Because you're not an idiot.<eos> Something is happening there.<eos> I didn't believe it, but...<eos> Where'd this come from?<eos> We... did a seance tonight. - What?
You have got to be kidding me!<eos> She had the nerve to show up!<eos> - Kara did this to us?<eos> ! - She said it was an accident.<eos> - Of course she did. Classic.
Our baby came home.<eos> - A felony?<eos> - I know.<eos> I mean, he did beat him up really bad.<eos> Yeah, he did.
Stop, stop, stop, stop.<eos> Stop, stop.<eos> I don't...<eos> That's not... No, I don't want that.<eos> You don't?
You are bored out of your freaking mind.<eos> Oh, my God, I'm so bored.<eos> And I can't move as much as I want to, so we just sit and stare and stare and stare.<eos> And I love Harriet.<eos> I do, obviously.
There's some speed queens at table eight.<eos> No.<eos> Just gonna take this whole pot across the street.<eos> Get Etta a cup of coffee and some cherry pie, and don't charge her.<eos> Done and done.
Pickled baloney?<eos> I'm not eating that shit.<eos> Why don't we ever go out anymore?<eos> You're right.<eos> We don't.
She burrows under my skin like a fucking tick.<eos> Evil.<eos> My God, and the years I wasted, broken up over her.<eos> I don't know you.<eos> Sure, you do.
The father of the child withdrew from the child's life initially.<eos> Is this correct?<eos> - She forced him to knock her up.<eos> You can't force someone to do that.<eos> She did.
Hey, come here.<eos> Come here.<eos> - I want it back.<eos> - Fuck.<eos> You do too.
No, you were getting back at me for throwing you in front of the El.<eos> If I hadn't climbed off the tracks, you would've killed me.<eos> Yes, and it serves you right for fucking that slut with the cauliflower ears!<eos> I was not fucking her!<eos> - Yes, you did!
If I hadn't climbed off the tracks, you would've killed me.<eos> Yes, and it serves you right for fucking that slut with the cauliflower ears!<eos> I was not fucking her!<eos> - Yes, you did!<eos> - No, I didn't.
I want to stop the terrorists.<eos> Why else?<eos> Hello?<eos> You know who this is, Agent.<eos> I do.
- Your brother is going crazy.<eos> - Where is he?<eos> I don't know how you did it, but thank you.<eos> I thought I'd lost you.<eos> You did... for a while.
That we couldn't have seen this coming.<eos> - That's true?<eos> - Why would you ask me that?<eos> Because I need to make sure that our decision to wait didn't put this woman in a wheelchair.<eos> No, it didn't.
You mean harassment?<eos> - Something like that.<eos> - You're the interested party?<eos> - I didn't say that.<eos> - No, you didn't.
Give us the her or we'll throw the dog off the bridge!<eos> - I'm bluffing, but if he shoots her, throw the dog off the bridge.<eos> - Why did you attack us?<eos> - We didn't! - How do you know who we are?<eos> - We don't.
You're Lydia Spring.<eos> Are you the one that wrote this letter?<eos> I am.<eos> Do you really have answers?<eos> I do.
They're a key piece in what's happening.<eos> Two of them even came after us while we were trying to dig up the machine.<eos> - Got them both, though.<eos> - Yeah. You killed them?<eos> Well, the shark did, certainly.
Should I be expecting more?<eos> You lost your mind when you betrayed Rainey.<eos> The Supreme Soul had a plan for us, for all of us.<eos> Oh, really?<eos> Did he, now?
How was karate?<eos> Were you the best one there?<eos> Becks, the only person I'm trying to be better than is the person I was yesterday.<eos> - Mm. - And today, I kicked Yesterday Josh's ass!<eos> Yeah, you did!
I really have been doing a lot better.<eos> But then I heard about you and Chan.<eos> And... you had a drink?<eos> No, no.<eos> I didn't.
No, no.<eos> I didn't.<eos> I wanted to.<eos> I thought about it.<eos> I almost did.
How do you get that?<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> I know who she is.<eos> I read about her in Us magazine.<eos> She does eyebrows for celebrities.
Okay.<eos> Yeah.<eos> No.<eos> She doesn't weigh herself, remember?<eos> Of course she does.
Walk/Run 5K, Parsipanny, New Jersey.<eos> That's a great cause, great organization.<eos> Sorry, I didn't make you a shirt, Paula.<eos> I-I don't know how these girl groups work.<eos> Did I do something wrong?
- That wasn't the flu,<eos> I had an abortion.<eos> (sighs) Oh, my God.<eos> You had an abortion?<eos> Yes, yes, I did.
(sighs) Oh, my God.<eos> You had an abortion?<eos> Yes, yes, I did.<eos> - You didn't tell me?<eos> - No, I did not.
I was, I was sitting there...<eos> I was sitting there on the edge of your bed, and you said nothing.<eos> I mean, I asked you, I asked you point blank if anything was wrong.<eos> - You didn't really mean it.<eos> - Yes, I did, yes, I did.
- Yeah.<eos> Yeah, I was you before you were you, Dee Dee.<eos> What is it?<eos> I don't want to resign.<eos> Well, then don't.
♪ Get the Space Bugs in your ♪<eos> ♪ Space Bugs in your ♪<eos> ♪ Head... ♪<eos> I thought I'd lost you.<eos> You did... for a while.
I, uh... no.<eos> No.<eos> Uh, who gave it to you?<eos> Well, uh...<eos> Red did.
Why not?<eos> It's a beautiful song.<eos> Don't-don't you think it's beautiful?<eos> No.<eos> I don't.
I surrender!<eos> - To who?<eos> - To you.<eos> You don't need to surrender to me.<eos> Okay... I don't then?
You're very lucky to be surrounded by such enlightened chaps such as myself and Blake. Professor.<eos> It's curious, though. In this case, the two parties agree on what happened.<eos> She gave him a blowjob.<eos> He didn't force her to.<eos> - No, he didn't.
I mean, I didn't know he was gonna be here.<eos> I mean, why did you invite him?<eos> We bumped into each other on the quad, and he seemed rather lonely, so...<eos> I'm taking his class. Did I tell you that?<eos> - You didn't.
I got to pick up the balloons, buy a new camera battery, make the gift bags...<eos> I got the kids all personalized sunglasses with their names on the sides.<eos> Pink for the girls, green for the boys.<eos> Hey, um, did you confirm the entertainment?<eos> Already done.
The ones asking me if I tried to murder your husband.<eos> They came here too. I'm...<eos> I-I'm sorry.<eos> I-I didn't know they would go to you.<eos> Well, they did.
- Swings.<eos> God, you're so big now.<eos> Look at you..<eos> Do you remember when I was born?<eos> Yeah. Of course I do.
I saw you two talking, so...<eos> We were talking about her kids.<eos> We don't talk about you. That would be unethical.<eos> I just, you know, thought maybe she said something about...<eos> She didn't.
- It's okay.<eos> - It's fine. I can.<eos> Joanie, nobody else can go before you go.<eos> Look, she doesn't want to ride.<eos> Of course she does.
This guy could be a full-on sexual deviant.<eos> I mean, think about it.<eos> We don't know anything about who we're trapped here with.<eos> You know what? You're right.<eos> - We don't.
I want everyone to get back to the shelter.<eos> What's the matter, Steve, huh?<eos> You worried that if people don't find this place livable, they might want to give me the tarp?<eos> Owen, do you know the name of that actor?<eos> Well, maybe I do and maybe I don't.
That's a bridge you can't uncross.<eos> Okay, so just... Aah!<eos> - Yo, Gary. - Uh-oh.<eos> I don't even think this dude wants to live.<eos> He doesn't.
That's what happened between us.<eos> You... you really think that?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I know it's true.<eos> And you do too.
I don't know how you made it through Gabriel's death.<eos> I thought about it a lot when I was away, and just... 29 years old, and you lose your child.<eos> No real parents, no one to take care of you.<eos> I-I don't know how you survived.<eos> I didn't, really.
What if we kept him?<eos> He's not real, K.<eos> What does that mean?<eos> Who says I'm real?<eos> I do.
This embedded part?<eos> Here.<eos> I can feel it.<eos> Do you love me, Leo?<eos> Yes, I do.
Did you sleep at all?<eos> I tried, but...<eos> Hey, I know it's horrible what those people are saying, but you can't pay attention to that.<eos> - They don't even know you...<eos> - Carolyn Bloom does.
You didn't care if it killed you.<eos> But it didn't.<eos> It left me with the rest of my stupid life, didn't it?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, it did.
And who did you bring this to?<eos> A friend at the DOJ.<eos> And Rob.<eos> He thanked me for the catch and promised he'd deal with it.<eos> And did he?
I like the sound of it.<eos> Don't get used to it.<eos> Five-hundred words on the dual Metallo attacks in Metropolis and National City with eyewitness accounts, comments from police sources and zero adjectives, all thoroughly vetted and verified.<eos> - You don't work here.<eos> - Yes, I do.
Yeah, well, she's not anymore, is she?<eos> Wow!<eos> Why are you being such a dick?<eos> I really don't know.<eos> I really don't.
I was little and... ..I stole some sweets from an off-license.<eos> I tried to pretend that I didn't know it was wrong, but my mum sat me down and said...<eos> "Tell me the truth."<eos> "Tell me the truth."<eos> And you did.
I tried to pretend that I didn't know it was wrong, but my mum sat me down and said...<eos> "Tell me the truth."<eos> "Tell me the truth."<eos> And you did.<eos> And you did.
If he's here, don't you think we should find him before he finds us?<eos> Are you ok?<eos> Why wouldn't I be?<eos> I'm trapped in a confined space, which is making my heart beat nearly twice as fast as normal, you're afraid of me, and everyone thinks I act like a prince asking stupid questions.<eos> No, they don't.
Do you never complain about your friends?<eos> Do you never complain about me?<eos> Even in the privacy of your head?<eos> That's the thing.<eos> I never actually do.
For a Rhodian, a wish is the same as an action.<eos> That's messed up.<eos> I know.<eos> I think we have some things to talk about.<eos> Yes, we do.
And shooting people is a crime.<eos> If it wasn't, I would have put a bullet in my brother-in-law years ago.<eos> Why is that funny?<eos> Ladies and gentlemen, did Danny shoot Pack?<eos> Yeah, he did.
If it wasn't, I would have put a bullet in my brother-in-law years ago.<eos> Why is that funny?<eos> Ladies and gentlemen, did Danny shoot Pack?<eos> Yeah, he did.<eos> But he did it in self-defense.
Yeah.<eos> Why wouldn't I be?<eos> Because you're the person who paid to have "Head Flight Attendant" embroidered on your uniform.<eos> I did not pay to have it embroidered.<eos> I did that myself.
What?<eos> Where you gonna go?<eos> - Just gonna go back to my camp.<eos> - I thought they banished you, though.<eos> They did.
Where you gonna go?<eos> - Just gonna go back to my camp.<eos> - I thought they banished you, though.<eos> They did.<eos> They did.
He was disheveled, out of breath, sweaty.<eos> You were about to ask him if he needed anything, but he was in such a hurry, he left without saying a word.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> I didn't see anything like that.<eos> Yes, you did.
It could already be too late.<eos> Gary called.<eos> He said you're sick, Mike.<eos> They didn't understand in 1988, and they don't understand now.<eos> And you do?
You know, I've worked with some mothers who, for various reasons, are unable to bond with their children.<eos> Some love really is conditional.<eos> Honey, that's true.<eos> Do you love me?<eos> Of course I do.
Do you know what book?<eos> Hmm.<eos> "Squire Trelawney, Dr. Livesey, and the rest of these gentlemen, having asked me to write down the whole particulars about Treasure Island, from the beginning to the end, and keeping nothing back but the bearings of the island..."<eos> When you think about this, it'll just seem like some nightmare you had.<eos> It already does.
Oh. You really did.<eos> I knew this zombie once.<eos> He was my doctor.<eos> - Somebody kill it!<eos> - Somebody already did.
- Hi.<eos> Oh, great cameo.<eos> Loved you flailing around on stage.<eos> - You saw that?<eos> - The whole world did, sweetie.
Apparently not.<eos> Listen. Now we have the chance.<eos> Shall we just blow out of here and go to Sag Harbor for the weekend?<eos> You don't want to meet them.<eos> Of course I do.
I'm okay. Okay.<eos> Why don't you rehearse? Okay?<eos> Why don't you keep on rehearsing a little bit?<eos> Okay? Let's keep on doing it, and I will be from here supervising. Okay?<eos> - But you guys do it--
- What's up?<eos> I really have to talk to you.<eos> Uh, yeah. Are you just appearing places now or--<eos> - I live here. - No.<eos> No, he doesn't.
I'm doing something that's really important to me, and I would really appreciate it if you would give me the space to do that.<eos> - I give you the space.<eos> - Sorry.<eos> Do you want to do this or not?<eos> I really, really do.
The mindset of the soldier.<eos> How can anyone here even guess?<eos> Well, imagination is an act of empathy.<eos> Of course we don't know what it was actually like.<eos> No, you don't.
I swore I wasn't going to kiss you.<eos> You can't keep doing this.<eos> I swore I wasn't going to kiss you.<eos> I swore I wasn't going to kiss you.<eos> Then you did.
You're leaving a lot of ass on the table.<eos> I'm gonna miss having someone else around who cares about astronomy.<eos> But, dude, you're my wingman.<eos> If you're not talking me up, I'm not sure I'd get that Sophia at that party last week.<eos> IâI did.
And, um, he wanted to know, did I see anyone else there?<eos> Anyone else?<eos> What did he mean by that?<eos> Did I notice anyone odd or different or unusual?<eos> - And did you?
We have a job to do, Nick.<eos> We are going to do it.<eos> Uh, please try to see.<eos> -You really don't want to know.<eos> -But we do.
- So?<eos> You going with?<eos> - Nope.<eos> - He didn't ask you?<eos> - No, he did not.
Han-Shireikan, join us.<eos> Ishida Ryo.<eos> You stand accused of the death of your father, Emperor Ishida Tetsuda.<eos> How do you plead?<eos> I don't.
[Pyper] Nope. [sighs]<eos> It appears the world still doesn't know what to do with an alpha female.<eos> Which is why us alpha females need to take matters into our own hands.<eos> You want to buy my crappy old motor home?<eos> I do. [laughs]
Everyone knows that.<eos> He's just a ghost story now.<eos> No way.<eos> I saw him.<eos> Or I almost did.
Well, Bob can't afford it.<eos> I've been calling around to see if the state facilities can take him, but they've all got wait lists.<eos> I remember what a sweet little boy he was.<eos> Do you know anybody with some pull that could maybe help him get moved up the list?<eos> Actually, I do.
So, hypothetically, this girl becomes really friendly with the guy with [chuckling] a lot of medicine so she could get more.<eos> You slept with a drug dealer for heroin?<eos> [Jule] Yeah.<eos> It's not actually something you would put in your annual Christmas letter.<eos> But, yeah, I did.
Enough!<eos> Time for revenge most sweet.<eos> - Uh... - Wait a minute.<eos> I thought you said "furious four."<eos> I did.
Yeah, I know.<eos> I love my dad.<eos> But I don't always agree with him.<eos> And I-I don't want you to think that I-I share his feelings about you.<eos> Well, I don't.
- You missed our first deposition.<eos> Didn't you say you wanted to be there?<eos> You wanted to fight?<eos> I did.<eos> I do.
Well, these things always have a way of working out.<eos> You've had a turnaround.<eos> What are you doing over there?<eos> Well, you know how we couldn't compare the fingerprint on the syringe with Eddie Harp's fingerprints 'cause we didn't have them?<eos> Now we do.
Now there's no reason for you to come back to Absaroka.<eos> I'm gonna be very polite, but very clear.<eos> I want you out of my county.<eos> I know who you are.<eos> The FBI does not.
Is A-Asha with you?<eos> Um, no.<eos> She's not.<eos> - But you got my message.<eos> - Uh, yes, I did.
I cannot let you do this.<eos> I heard J.P. on your answering machine.<eos> Your restraining order worked.<eos> He... He said he's sorry.<eos> Of course he did.
No, but, uh, I got to ask you some questions that aren't gonna be too much fun.<eos> Were you aware that your husband might have been unfaithful?<eos> Yes.<eos> Sheriff, I knew who I was marrying, but I loved him anyway, no matter what.<eos> I still do.
That's not true!<eos> I did not!<eos> Then you just hired somebody to do it.<eos> Tizz, you didn't know what Tony was really like.<eos> Yes, I did.
Shit.<eos> - You think you're safe in there? !<eos> - Go in the kitchen, and close the door.<eos> - I thought we were...<eos> - Please, Asha, just do it!
We'll check airline manifests, hotel rooms, rental cars... look for whoever came in from Boston.<eos> Who are we looking for?<eos> Well, it's probably not the boss himself.<eos> He probably sent somebody else.<eos> - But if he didn't and...
- of 20 years to life. - Objection, Your Honor.<eos> This is not the sentencing phase, is it?<eos> Sustained.<eos> Now, Ms. Moretti, do you know what the Fourth Amendment says?<eos> I do.
Who knew you were taking Malachi out there?<eos> Just Jacob.<eos> What is it?<eos> Walt said that he suspected that Nighthorse put on a show for me, then went back to kill Malachi.<eos> Maybe he did.
You don't know anything about my mother.<eos> I know your mother.<eos> I know your mother.<eos> I know your mother.<eos> We all do.
She said, "Go be the hero of your own life."<eos> And you said to her, "A hero doesn't leave."<eos> How do you know that?<eos> I see her in my dreams.<eos> We all do.
There was no serious damage.<eos> This time.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I should have told you.<eos> - Why didn't you?
Unfortunately, repairs will take quite some time.<eos> Well, have you restored your neural link?<eos> That should speed things up.<eos> I wasn't sure you wanted me to do that.<eos> Of course I do.
I'm-I'm having some health issues.<eos> If I sit, I might not get up again.<eos> So, let me just say this first.<eos> I know you leaked.<eos> - You do?
You want to know who?<eos> Sure, if you want to tell me.<eos> Michael Moore.<eos> You know, Michael Moore, the liberal.<eos> I do.
- Honey, come quick.<eos> He's learning to wave back.<eos> - What?<eos> - Did you wave?<eos> You did.
Well, get a move on.<eos> Everything must be absolutely "pafekuto."<eos> Mm-hmm.<eos> You do know what today is.<eos> Of course I do.
What are you talking about?<eos> I'm telling you I've never spoken to Sean Cahill in my life.<eos> All right, I'm here.<eos> But I gave you seven days to find that witness, and then you went behind my back, so you better have a good reason why you're in here asking to reopen this case.<eos> We do, Your Honor.
No, you signed on to get yourself out.<eos> Now if you don't drop this suit,<eos> Cahill's gonna threaten to pull your deal.<eos> What?<eos> He already did.
You're leaving right now.<eos> Harvey, good, you're here.<eos> What the hell's going on?<eos> You said you'd reinstate the deal if Mike dropped his suit.<eos> - And I did.
- Bullshit.<eos> - Smile, you son of a bitch.<eos> No!<eos> You did not keep yourself in here just to do this.<eos> Yeah, Frank, I did.
- Your Honor, they opened the door to this when they put her on the stand, and no one is more qualified to answer than his own attorney.<eos> - I'll allow it.<eos> Ms. Casey?<eos> - I thought Leonard Bailey was guilty.<eos> And I still do.
So then they put it on for prisoners in Sing Sing.<eos> People said it wouldn't work.<eos> They wouldn't get it.<eos> It was too highbrow.<eos> Of course, they did.
Football, please.<eos> Or should I say, nuclear football.<eos> The codes are in here.<eos> Who voted for you?<eos> I didn't.
They're resilient.<eos> Yeah, I wouldn't be so sure.<eos> Well, Mike, you don't have kids.<eos> So you don't know.<eos> No. I don't.
Harvey Specter.<eos> I'm Mike Ross's lawyer.<eos> Look, I already told the warden I didn't see anyone touch his food.<eos> Did you see Frank Gallo with him?<eos> Did you or didn't you?
Are you kidding me?<eos> You come at me, I apologize to you, and then you do this?<eos> Well, in between those two things, your traders were playing touch football in my beloved bullpen, so I don't accept your bullshit apology.<eos> You won't get away with this.<eos> I already did.
Well, then fight goddamn harder!<eos> I'm sorry, and I understand how you feel, but there's just nothing more that I can do.<eos> How do you know what I feel?<eos> You don't know what it's like to be kept away from your loved ones.<eos> - Actually, I do.
Now if you'll excuse me.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Thank your counselor, Mr. Rowe.<eos> - You must trust him a lot to let him in on your little arrangement.<eos> I do.
I don't need you to handle this thing for me.<eos> Now that I know what's what, I'll get my own attorney.<eos> Yeah, you do that, and I'll tell the courts that you just admitted to me that you tried to poison Mike.<eos> You know how much time that's gonna add to your sentence?<eos> - I didn't do shit to him!
Listen to me, everything we have is tied to that man.<eos> And if he goes away, we lose it all.<eos> That's not what I asked.<eos> Did he promise you money if you kept quiet?<eos> Of course he goddamn did.
The court granted our motion.<eos> They pushed your execution back a month.<eos> I don't believe it.<eos> You convinced my aunt I didn't kill those people?<eos> - No, Leonard, I didn't.
Leonard, don't take your eye off the ball.<eos> This was about buying us time.<eos> Take my eye off the ball?<eos> Do you even give a shit about me?<eos> Of course we do.
That is an iron clad agreement between your office and Jill Miller.<eos> You're representing Jill Miller now?<eos> Yes, I am.<eos> Does she know that you're not a lawyer?<eos> She does.
I have to throw the punch.<eos> That's why I came out here alone.<eos> You can't do it for me this time.<eos> Do you know how it feels when you know all your happiness is a lie?<eos> Yeah. I do.
- Did you get the apartment?<eos> - The...<eos> - Did you call?<eos> What did they say?<eos> Yeah, uh, I did.
She was there posing, looking at you?<eos> Thought, "Maybe she wants to have sex with me?"<eos> Right?<eos> Do you think so?<eos> Yeah, Charlie, I do.
Oh, and Hype's not the only one lying.<eos> Security video confirms that Eva's boyfriend Logan left his law firm at 11:30 and didn't return until 1:45.<eos> That's not a quick lunch.<eos> No, not unless you live in Italy.<eos> And he doesn't.
I keep everything locked up, but I always keep one right here in my desk.<eos> Oops.<eos> At least I thought I did.<eos> Did Hype know that you kept a gun in there?<eos> Of course he did.
I mean, now I'm just a guy sitting in front of a computer that predicts which child's gonna be shot next.<eos> It's a whole new thing.<eos> I'm here to tell you, you both got played.<eos> Park Lords didn't hit TK, someone else did, to pit you against each other.<eos> Then who the hell did it?
Makes it, like, 1,000 times more potent.<eos> It's killing people all over Chicago.<eos> Hey, Sarge.<eos> I heard Mouse came looking to get a felony dropped so he could re-enlist.<eos> And if he did?
- When?<eos> - '08.<eos> He was spitting distance from us in Kandahar.<eos> All right, well, they saw some action.<eos> Yeah, they did.
What are you talking about?<eos> Chemically, fentanyl's a pharmaceutical designed to treat cancer patients... potent enough that a molecule on the head of a pin is deadly, but if even a molecule's altered, then technically, it's not a controlled substance.<eos> That's what I'm talking about.<eos> Do you know how many OD's we have off this stuff down at Med?<eos> I do.
We were first on the scene.<eos> Is ASA Stone around?<eos> The Ariel Kincaid murder.<eos> You remember it?<eos> Yeah, I do.
I get it, but, Burgess, it is not that easy.<eos> You're just gonna have to suck it up.<eos> I didn't say anything.<eos> - You're right.<eos> You didn't.
What are you doing right now?<eos> - What?<eos> - Are you serious right now?<eos> What... What did we talk about?<eos> How many times do we
Put it there. As we look... just a sec.<eos> We've got blueprints... it's ripped there.<eos> We can still check it.<eos> When you were driving, did you see the exit?<eos> No, I didn't.
Something's not right.<eos> Go check it out.<eos> Mr. Lee?<eos> You didn't see the drill?<eos> No, I didn't.
I wrote it.<eos> And here we go.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Madam Secretary, do you know why civet coffee isn't bitter?<eos> No, I don't.
- The what? - Black capsule, cyanide.<eos> The astronauts had 'em too.<eos> You get stuck in orbit or captured by the enemy, you'd just bite into that thing and it's see ya soon, you big baboon.<eos> The astronauts had cyanide?<eos> They sure did.
So, the Chens fought back the only way they knew how.<eos> They prayed to their ancestors and they made offerings to protect them from evil.<eos> But their ancestors were no match for what was already here.<eos> I guess they never had a chance.<eos> But you do.
Okay, see?<eos> That... that right there.<eos> Why does it always go back to that?<eos> Does it ever occur to you that I have moved on?<eos> I... didn't.
A breath of fresh air.<eos> You should see how people spark up when they see her, and how happy it makes Karina.<eos> It's like she feeds off of it.<eos> If you don't operate... I'll be taking that from her.<eos> Do the surgery.
This isn't the Inhumans.<eos> It's a setup. They're being hunted.<eos> And guess who's doing the hunting.<eos> So, how you know Robbie?<eos> I don't.
Look, uh, sorry about all the drama.<eos> - I'm just glad to see you're safe. - Me?<eos> What about you, disappearing like that?<eos> - I thought you trusted me.<eos> - Well, I do.
Well, the first part is like you said.<eos> The fire, the chase, the shooting.<eos> But what I remember most is feeling like I screwed up that because of me, you were going to die.<eos> We both were.<eos> We didn't.
Never mind.<eos> Director just wants you to keep a low profile.<eos> There's a lot of media out here.<eos> - I don't answer to him.<eos> - No, you don't.
Let's play.<eos> Director ...<eos> Sir, i-if I may explain,<eos> I wasn't trying to fool anyone.<eos> But you did.
- Hang on.<eos> We got something.<eos> Is this thing on?<eos> Anyone seeing this?<eos> We do.
And pyrophoric, yeah.<eos> Reacts on contact with water.<eos> First carbon, now cesium ... it's like Morrow is testing his abilities, making his way through the periodic table.<eos> Who knows what other traps he's set?<eos> I do.
There's something in that building everyone needs to see.<eos> The "demon core?" Seriously?<eos> - You cannot make this stuff up.<eos> - I didn't name it that.<eos> The physicists at Los Alamos did.
I know it's not much, but the price is right.<eos> You just have to agree to keep the common areas clean, and do some small repairs for the residents.<eos> So, um, the landlord know about my record, right?<eos> That I'm on parole?<eos> Yeah. He does.
Although after tonight, I may be closing my accounts.<eos> O-kay...<eos> You want to go screw in the toilet?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, I do.
I'm retired.<eos> Do you understand that innocent people are dead?<eos> Innocent people with families.<eos> That's got to mean something to you.<eos> It does.
Well, I have seen the place about a dozen times, but let's make it official.<eos> Right.<eos> You brought the Pope.<eos> I brought the Pope.<eos> Well, the Second City First Committee did.
I don't know. I was just looking.<eos> You was just looking?<eos> Do you know Ms. Jeffries?<eos> You know anything about Ms. Jeffries?<eos> 'Cause I do.
Nobody smiles in shock, Baker.<eos> Well, did you read the comments?<eos> What comments?<eos> The responses to Officer Clark's caricature.<eos> Uh, no, I did not.
No, Ma.<eos> He's a con man with a rap sheet a mile long.<eos> Oh, I would never have anything to do with someone like that.<eos> Uh, you-you wrote a half a dozen checks for him for a few thousand dollars apiece.<eos> I did?
You remember offering to loan me money?<eos> No, did I?<eos> You did.<eos> You said my son's life was worth a hell of a lot more than a measly $2,000.<eos> I did?
In what?<eos> Fear!<eos> You know that I've felt it;<eos> you helped me get over it.<eos> You did that yourself.
Henry, head down there and see if anyone collects that telegram.<eos> - Sir.<eos> - Joe Murphy, sir.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> I don't either, George.
[Uh, it's, uh, Derby Street.]<eos> Did you find her?<eos> Young Molly?<eos> No.<eos> I didn't.
- He tried to kill her.<eos> Molly fought back.<eos> She grabbed a knife... it must have hit the carotid artery because there was blood everywhere.<eos> From that moment, she was a dead woman unless I helped her.<eos> So I did.
Then why am I here?<eos> We have to blame someone.<eos> The function of the police is to attribute blame on behalf of the community.<eos> But the community doesn't particularly care if we blame the right person.<eos> Of course they do.
Why thank you, Henry.<eos> I shall, Henry.<eos> So, what are we going to do this evening?<eos> We're going to ensure that Mr. Newsome doesn't come to any harm.<eos> Yes, but what do we do while we do that?
If you are uncomfortable, you may excuse yourself from this case.<eos> I think I'll stay, sir.<eos> It's quite rare to see you make a mistake.<eos> Of course I buy rouge sticks.<eos> - We all do, don't we, girls?
They're at home.<eos> I'll bring them in Tomorrow.<eos> Right then James, it's six o'clock.<eos> - You know what that means?<eos> - I certainly do.
Ten Tankard Tommy.<eos> Is there something troubling you, William?<eos> No.<eos> I heard James Pendrick dropped by the station today.<eos> He did.
If we receive your packages, they will become our packages.<eos> We had a snake when we moved in.<eos> Where it is now is anyone's guess.<eos> And we're definitely gonna swim in all of your pools.<eos> We already did.
I'm just being nice.<eos> Let go.<eos> You want it rough, all you got to do is ask.<eos> Come on, baby, you know you want it.<eos> You do.
Let go.<eos> You want it rough, all you got to do is ask.<eos> Come on, baby, you know you want it.<eos> You do.<eos> You do.
I appreciate your generosity.<eos> You know that.<eos> Then show me the respect.<eos> By disrespecting the law?<eos> By doing a good friend a favor.
Well, that was different, Erin, 'cause, you see, in those cases, the victim was willing to step up and take the stand.<eos> Emily Harrison was raped and beaten.<eos> She's traumatized and scared.<eos> I get it.<eos> Do you?
Oh, that's nice.<eos> I thought so.<eos> No, I meant nice.<eos> As in, my go-to detective is working on a case for you and neither of you thought to tell me.<eos> I just did.
And you were there when it happened?<eos> The assistant principal asked for witnesses to come forward and say who started it.<eos> And, Jack, you didn't say anything?<eos> I wasn't the only one there.<eos> Well, did they?
From your description, it sounded like our lieutenant was just going along with the arrest, not driving it.<eos> You were right.<eos> Well, I don't know.<eos> I had misgivings when you decided to come on the job.<eos> Still do.
Oh, there's no way he lived through that.<eos> This video features the same teenager as several that preceded it.<eos> Obviously, his family brought in their old film to Stone Post for digitization.<eos> So I doubt they knew what they had.<eos> Aaron obviously did.
I've taken it as far as I can. But at some point in the process, uh, your absence became, you know, quite limiting.<eos> What process?<eos> She told me about the weekend getaway that you have planned.<eos> Um, sounded like a excellent opportunity to... elope.<eos> And, uh, if you do, then...
Your house is way nicer than Anne Murray's.<eos> We broke in there, too.<eos> Taylor, why'd you write that song about me?<eos> I thought we had a real connection.<eos> We do.
- Give me a second to get my bearings, okay?<eos> Don't you think I want to know what happened<eos> - just as much as you do?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> Do you?
I didn't mean that you and Katz are like those two goons.<eos> No, we're not.<eos> And we won't be,<eos> - 'cause we don't live together.<eos> - Yes, you do.
No, we're not.<eos> And we won't be,<eos> - 'cause we don't live together.<eos> - Yes, you do.<eos> - No, we don't.
It's old news, but it's still damaging if it fell into the wrong hands.<eos> I just want to take this guy down.<eos> A Crown Vic's an easy car to break into.<eos> Take a thumb drive, download whatever files he's got.<eos> - When do we do this?
Sawyer?<eos> It's Danvers.<eos> Can I talk to you a minute?<eos> I don't know you.<eos> Now you do.
It will be.<eos> I'm going to teach you how.<eos> I got the impression that you didn't want to spend time with me.<eos> Oh, you're right.<eos> I didn't.
They want us to be afraid of each other.<eos> to not trust each other anymore.<eos> Well how do you know what Cadmus wants?<eos> I...<eos> I just do.
Okay?<eos> Tell your family.<eos> This is the biggest thing that's ever happened to you, and you shouldn't have to do it alone.<eos> - I have you.<eos> - Yeah, you do.
Where did you go?<eos> What's the emergency, Mr. Schott?<eos> Is she drunk?<eos> Mon-El took me to happy hour.<eos> Of course he did.
Is she drunk?<eos> Mon-El took me to happy hour.<eos> Of course he did.<eos> He knows how to drink drinks.<eos> Of course he does.
Okay, I may have your powers but I don't have this...<eos> This innate desire to go leaping into trouble.<eos> But that doesn't make me a bad person, all right?<eos> - It kind of does.<eos> - No, it doesn't.
Not too bad, yourself, man in the van.<eos> You want to keep on doing this, don't you?<eos> Yeah.<eos> - So do you.<eos> - Yeah, I do.
No.<eos> Thank you.<eos> For what?<eos> I told my mom.<eos> You did?
Two years.<eos> I put myself on the line for you for two years, and you can't tell me why... why I got shot?<eos> Whoa.<eos> What makes you so sure I got answers?<eos> Somebody does.
No, I-I did that because I was trying to do something good.<eos> I was trying to do something... something for you, something for Raimy.<eos> Something that would make you proud.<eos> And I understand you've been through a lot.<eos> I do.
The Savior will be here soon.<eos> Oh, do you mean Aladdin?<eos> The thief with a heart of gold, or is it the heart that desires gold?<eos> - You don't know him.<eos> - Oh, but I do.
No, I want her with me.<eos> I want her to stay here with me.<eos> You know what she said when she got home last night?<eos> "Everybody needs to stop lying to me. I'm not a baby anymore."<eos> Of course she did.
That's the podcast verbatim.<eos> AMANDA: Nothing further.<eos> Ms. Stefano, did you and Mike Tasker ever fight?<eos> - Sure.<eos> Every couple does.
I'm gonna go play guitar.<eos> I was impressed.<eos> That passion... that's what I first remember about you when you started at the D.A.'s office.<eos> (lightly chuckles) Look, Amanda, you don't have to.<eos> No, I do.
Get it back.<eos> Get the footage back.<eos> I need to see more.<eos> Yeah, I'm trying, but it's not working.<eos> Just do it.
Her name's Corporal Victoria Moore.<eos> She worked perimeter security, had full access to the base.<eos> That's who Apep possessed?<eos> That means at the temple Apep got the pendant but Charlene got away.<eos> Of course she did.
That's very kind.<eos> Well, you know where we are if you want it back.<eos> She's beautiful.<eos> Jaclyn. I don't know why I remember it.<eos> But I do.
I don't believe this.<eos> What's wrong?<eos> This guy from the office just congratulated me on being pregnant.<eos> You did already know, right?<eos> No one at the office did.
They made me promise I wouldn't talk.<eos> And you talked?<eos> Well, now, see?<eos> You knew what was gonna happen.<eos> Why didn't they?
Earl's got people hunting him down across time and space, and I can't get a second date?<eos> Earl!<eos> Oh, it's you.<eos> I recognize that swagger.<eos> She does?
Why, why not?<eos> None of the others filed charges, but at least they got plenty of cash.<eos> - And have you ever asked yourself why they took the money and I didn't?<eos> No, I haven't.<eos> Why didn't you?
It's over.<eos> Are you certain you don't want me to call the doctor?<eos> All better now.<eos> Do you believe in God?<eos> I... yes, I do.
All I know is, the hostages from Federal Hall are getting too much for the terrorists to handle, which is why they want to trade them all for Boyer.<eos> You can't let that happen, Raina.<eos> But that's almost 1,700 hostages.<eos> - You don't want them rescued?<eos> - Of course I do.
And if you don't start doing better, next cut, you're out.<eos> For every 10 hostages you release, we'll take one foot forward with Boyer.<eos> When all the hostages have been freed, we'll fall back and leave Boyer in your custody.<eos> Come on, Raina.<eos> Don't do it, Raina.
Are you?<eos> I thought you slept naked.<eos> And I thought you prayed.<eos> I haven't seen you do that for weeks.<eos> I do it.
What my mom asked you to do... getting rid of these.<eos> Let me explain.<eos> You don't have to.<eos> I get it.<eos> No, you don't.
I've been test driving this bad boy with this other bad boy all day.<eos> For six hours.<eos> We went through every Wendy's drive-thru in Queens.<eos> I wrote "Help me" on a napkin.<eos> But nobody did.
Caroline and Han are really getting at it over there.<eos> This storm is turning people on more than alcohol and low self-esteem.<eos> Even Han got some action.<eos> I don't hold hands and tell.<eos> Or maybe I do.
♪ Previously on BrainDead... ♪<eos> ♪ Previously on Gunsmoke... ♪<eos> Oh, I like him.<eos> - You do?
What do you mean?<eos> About losing the war vote.<eos> We've been getting calls for a statement.<eos> We didn't lose the war vote, buddy.<eos> - We didn't?
Release what?<eos> It.<eos> And, uh, set up a press conference for me for tomorrow.<eos> Senator, do you still trust me?<eos> Do I...?
It.<eos> And, uh, set up a press conference for me for tomorrow.<eos> Senator, do you still trust me?<eos> Do I...?<eos> Of course I do.
It's like a museum.<eos> You just can't stop cleaning things even though everything's already clean.<eos> I mean, everyone's got a little OCD, but you're like off the charts.<eos> You think you know me?<eos> Yeah, in fact, I do.
we should probably, uh...<eos> Wait a second.<eos> I don't know how to do this.<eos> I'm not handy!<eos> She did it again. Ha!
- Okay.<eos> Hey!<eos> The DiMeos are home!<eos> I want to be clear.<eos> I did not do this.
Then I heard about what happened to those guys, and I...<eos> I'm scared, Roger.<eos> I screwed up.<eos> Yeah, Ned.<eos> You did.
Oh, it's the only way.<eos> They poisoned my brothers!<eos> They poisoned my brothers.<eos> I gotta make sure it never happens again.<eos> Detectives, please do something.
That's unfair.<eos> Is it?<eos> Mum would hate your idea.<eos> You don't know that.<eos> Yes, I do.
Are you sure you want to do this?<eos> Oh, yeah!<eos> We both do.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Of course you do.
Just a word.<eos> And if you're mature enough to do it, you're mature enough...<eos> Don't mind me. Don't mind me.<eos> I did not hear a thing.<eos> Yah! I did. (LAUGHS)
Umm, it's when you want to hurt somebody really really badly.<eos> What's it doing in here?<eos> We'll go over sarcasm later.<eos> That's a thing that women used to wear.<eos> Some probably do actually still.
- Hey.<eos> - Hey.<eos> Oh, cool chimpbot costume!<eos> I wish they made those in adult sizes.<eos> Maybe they do.
No, that was for Evan.<eos> He ran away, not me.<eos> I gotta say, Oscar, seeing you step up like you did there was pretty sexy.<eos> You want that candy don't you?<eos> Yeah, I really do.
Hey, I'm curious.<eos> How do you know when it's time to buy a new pair of shoes?<eos> To be honest, shoes for me are whimsical.<eos> So, I heard what happened.<eos> Of course you did.
I remember.<eos> For me, it was the first time I really paid attention to what men look like down there.<eos> I couldn't help wondering, "What was God thinking?"<eos> Maybe he was high and figured he'd fix it in the morning.<eos> Well, he didn't.
What's going on?<eos> Why didn't you tell him he couldn't drink in front of Roscoe?<eos> Because that's stupid,<eos> - and I don't say stupid things.<eos> - Sure you do.
Everybody keeps asking me that.<eos> I'm fine.<eos> You know what, that's probably true.<eos> I think you are fine.<eos> You do?
Every choice that you make is no longer about your future alone.<eos> Everything changes.<eos> You said that you had a serious boyfriend out west.<eos> You didn't want children?<eos> He did.
Frank, that's fair.<eos> I wouldn't expect you to understand what I did for my family, but do not call my daughter a liar.<eos> She never betrayed you. She never betrayed any of us.<eos> And I'm here today because she asked me to come and tell you and Ed to get the hell out of this city... because she still cares about you.<eos> So I did it.
Why are you staring at me like that?<eos> Fine, I'll fix it.<eos> Sure, put the headphones on, remove yourself.<eos> I don't want to do that.<eos> But I do!
Six hundred euros per hour...<eos> Yes.<eos> And everyone's happy.<eos> Wait, so it means that your girl... she doesn't even want to be here.<eos> Sure she does.
Soviet furniture — the main attraction!<eos> And those special dishes that you only use when special people arrive on special occasions!<eos> God, do you understand, do you realize that I wanted everything to be special for me all the time?<eos> Wait, you no longer believe in love?<eos> Of course I do.
My bunny!<eos> Is that a yes?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I didn't have sex with him.<eos> I didn't.
- I would have had him in cuffs.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> Well, I wasn't willing to take that risk.<eos> What if you'd missed?<eos> - I didn't.
You're worried about your parents, and that's making this worse, but they're gonna be all right.<eos> They're gonna find that magic little baby tree thing and defeat the Evil Queen.<eos> They're gonna find that magic little tree thing?<eos> Yeah, that's right.<eos> What if they don't?
I thought I'd lost you forever.<eos> May the love between you always be strong, true, and eternal.<eos> If you need anything, I will always find you.<eos> Do you promise?<eos> I do.
That girl you stalked. Was she a patient?<eos> Raymond showed me her file.<eos> He wanted me to see it.<eos> Thought it would scare me off.<eos> But it didn't.
Not like that.<eos> Not like you.<eos> There was my wife.<eos> She didn't know what she was getting into.<eos> Still doesn't.
She said you weren't coming back.<eos> She just wanted to be the one with you.<eos> I think she gets tired, being the strong one.<eos> How do you know that?<eos> I don't.
We met on the flight over.<eos> And?<eos> That no hooking up amongst the staff policy-- the staff work together hard to make sure Mr. Quinn believes it's working.<eos> Though it isn't.<eos> Maybe it did, in the last century.
And this is one of those times.<eos> Why did your doc back out?<eos> Can I guess?<eos> You don't have to; you know why.<eos> Yes, I do.
She got hit by a car and she was pumped up with coke that was laced with W-18.<eos> You ever heard of that?<eos> Yeah. Yeah, I've heard of that.<eos> Um... I've never tried it, but...<eos> But she did.
I'm getting at the kempeitai sparing your life instead of shooting you dead.<eos> Childan told you about that.<eos> Yeah.<eos> He doesn't know anything about it, Frank.<eos> Neither do I.
I did, but listen.<eos> It was only about the Yakuza and the counterfeiting.<eos> Most of the stuff he already knew.<eos> What did you tell him about the bomb?<eos> No, I didn't. Nothing about the bomb or Gary or Sara or any of that.
- get you some stitches.<eos> - Oh, can I bring Bella?<eos> - Sure.<eos> - No. Bella gets so nervous alone and you have no idea how hard it is to find a good sitter.<eos> I do, actually.
I was just upset, that's all...<eos> Yeah, we're looking forward, Grant, not back.<eos> My recommendation is that you voluntarily commit yourself to the Springfield facility and begin the process of getting well.<eos> Yeah, no, I'm... Look, I... I know...<eos> I do.
You know, let... let me ask you a question here.<eos> If Von Braun is so important to America, why didn't Flynn just kill him?<eos> Hey.<eos> Don't you know how to knock?<eos> I did.
I have worked here for nine years.<eos> I took over from my mother.<eos> She worked my entire childhood maintaining the Summer Palace.<eos> So you know him well?<eos> No, actually, I don't.
You ever experience that moment of discovery?<eos> It's a revelation.<eos> And the man you shot?<eos> Will never know what that feels like.<eos> But I do.
Was up to now.<eos> Homeland Security's gonna arrest Coryna within the hour.<eos> And, uh, you want me to pull some strings?<eos> No, I want you to tell me the truth.<eos> I did.
It's almost impossible in this day and age to gain that kind of conservatorship over someone against their will.<eos> Disinheriting someone is one thing.<eos> Having them put away is another.<eos> You don't know the father.<eos> Do you?
Because I like you.<eos> And unlike everyone else, you don't lie about who you are.<eos> How are we gonna win?<eos> They told us to leave our phones there.<eos> I did.
All I said was that I wished I saw you more.<eos> And I do.<eos> You knew they owed you.<eos> You knew what it would mean coming from you, and worst of all, you knew it wasn't what I wanted.<eos> But you did it anyway.
And one of you was last seen being escorted away by the police.<eos> I want to know how you pulled it off.<eos> You know what they say about a good magician.<eos> Fair enough.<eos> Not how you did it.
Are you kidding me?<eos> !<eos> Rachel!<eos> Do you have any idea who you're messing with?<eos> I do.
Rachel!<eos> Do you have any idea who you're messing with?<eos> I do.<eos> Detective Riggs, meet Dylan Ashworth.<eos> Now he does, too.
Guess whose name's in here?<eos> Give me the book.<eos> All of these names are coded.<eos> How did you even know I was...<eos> - You didn't.
"for a joke."<eos> Have you ever been with a woman?<eos> I will ask her and see how she feels.<eos> I know how she will feel.<eos> No, you don't.
Everyone had problems with that kid.<eos> (elevator bell dings)<eos> Abbs,<eos> McGee said you had something for me.<eos> Yup. Yup, I do.
Well, thank you very much.<eos> Do you want a tour?<eos> I do, uh, but later, 'cause Gibbs wanted me to...<eos> He wants to find out where the earring came from.<eos> Of course he does.
And who knows?<eos> Someday we might go back to my castle.<eos> And you might be king.<eos> I kind of think I need to finish high school first.<eos> Well, of course you do.
I can't... I can't let people know I take my coffee sweet.<eos> They might think I'm a little sweet if you... If you know what I'm saying.<eos> It's gay to sweeten coffee?<eos> Look, do you think John Wayne took sugar?<eos> I don't.
- I hope you're a better kisser than Holt.<eos> - What?<eos> - Why did I say that?<eos> - Why did you kiss Holt?<eos> - I didn't.
- On the way to the embassy.<eos> Er... 17 to the torso, two to the... plum set.<eos> And you lived?<eos> Well, obviously, James, yes, look, I lived.<eos> He did.
Plus-<eos> - Plus, James May lost the tent bag.<eos> - Soz.<eos> - Yeah, he did.<eos> He did do that.
Mm. You erm...<eos> You bought the last GT, didn't you?<eos> Yes.<eos> Thank you for reminding me, Hammond.<eos> Yes, I did.
- A bit more conversation for you.<eos> - Oh, good!<eos> I think, with the exception of Rolls-Royce,<eos> Volvo now make the best car interiors of anybody.<eos> They do.
- I'll be with you in a minute.<eos> - No, it's...<eos> -You're not gonna be here to help me when I'm using it!<eos> - You don't know!<eos> - I bloody do!
Ford knew that if you wanted to rule in motorsport, there was only one race that mattered.<eos> The toughest and most dangerous of them all - the 24 Hours of Le Mans.<eos> Levegh's Mercedes collides and blows up.<eos> The problem was, for all its might, Ford didn't have a clue how to win at Le Mans.<eos> However, over in Italy, someone did.
- Shoot him.<eos> All we're doing on our journey is driving three beach buggies to the Angolan border.<eos> - Which doesn't further the cause of humanity.<eos> Exactly.<eos> And this does, does it?
The other night I stuffed my face full of powdered donuts, and then I cried myself to sleep.<eos> Yup.<eos> And, listen, if you don't want to lose weight, that's fine because that's your choice.<eos> I told you that when I met you, that I couldn't fall for a fat person.<eos> But you did.
- Hey, Kevin.<eos> - Yeah...<eos> I was just kind of wondering if... maybe this year, I could wear the hat?<eos> - Oh, you want to wear the hat?<eos> - Yeah, I do.
I am thankful for my family.<eos> I am thankful that everyone's safe.<eos> And there is no one in the whole world I'd rather be too hot or too cold with.<eos> Grandma always says the same thing.<eos> Yeah, she does, doesn't she?
I don't know that one.<eos> You knew how do it a second ago, now you don't?<eos> I don't know it, dad.<eos> I think you do.<eos> I don't.
Look, no promises, but I'll try to focus on Sarah and not talk about Oscar as much.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Did you know you could track down the origins of an envelope if it's stamped with a Pitney Bowes postage meter?<eos> - I did not.
Don't let me miss the rest of my daughter's life.<eos> Please, you have to believe me.<eos> I can't help you.<eos> But you believe me?<eos> You do.
It's by choice.<eos> Well, their choice, and it's not okay.<eos> Oh. Sorry.<eos> I didn't know.<eos> Nobody does.
How's that going?<eos> I'm in a hot tub with you, so pretty bad.<eos> Maybe I should just give in to his stupid bathroom schedule.<eos> No, don't do that.<eos> - But you did!
He tips off two reporters, Woodward and Bernstein, about Watergate, breaks open the entire case.<eos> If anybody knows about this document, it'll be him.<eos> If he's such a secret informant, what makes you think he's gonna talk to us?<eos> Because except for Woodward and Bernstein, nobody knows his identity for 30 years.<eos> But we do.
- 44 years?<eos> - I believe he's asking how on Earth Garcia Flynn managed to ambush Rittenhouse security back in 1972.<eos> He may suspect you had something to do with it.<eos> Why did Flynn show up at that house?<eos> Why does Flynn do anything he does?
Shut up!<eos> Calm down, okay.<eos> Come on! Hurry up!<eos> Let's go!<eos> Do it!
Know what?<eos> That given the players, the game is rigged.<eos> A little, but that's not my problem.<eos> - You want her to have a fair trial?<eos> - Of course I do.
Gilford.<eos> As in the D.A.?<eos> - It's just lunch, Jake. - Mm-hmm.<eos> - You want him on the show, don't you?<eos> - Of course I do.
And we're clear.<eos> Incoming.<eos> And he looks angry.<eos> I thought you said Levi didn't kill Sarah.<eos> He didn't.
Look, I really need you to trust me.<eos> Seeing him outside a clinical setting is a terrible idea, especially given the people he's involved with.<eos> But...<eos> But if you insist on...<eos> I do.
Okay.<eos> Can I have a hug?<eos> Can I get a "dad, I love you"?<eos> Do you have the name of a barber?<eos> I do.
The fact that my daughter doesn't find anything unusual about her playing snow white?<eos> That's the whole idea. (Chuckles)<eos> Right?<eos> Look, i-i don't know everything, William.<eos> I don't.
That station's been abandoned for years.<eos> I'll call FBI S.W.A.T. New York.<eos> I'll be handling Kirk on my own, Harold.<eos> If you expect us to stand down...<eos> I do.
No, no honking, not ever.<eos> And when I flip someone off, I always do it below the dash, where they can't even see it.<eos> - You know?<eos> - Mm-hmm.<eos> Or maybe you don't do anything.
And now I'm...<eos> All day long, I have been thinking that there is... there's a reason that I was in that line.<eos> There's a reason that I met you.<eos> And I don't believe in God or fate or anything.<eos> She doesn't at all.

Get your own gay husband.<eos> Oh, wait, you're marrying him next month.<eos> Okay, ladies, everybody say,<eos> "I tell my boyfriend he's normal-sized!"<eos> - I do!
They could be listening to us right now.<eos> We know they pose among us.<eos> So, maybe as we speak, we'll expose them.<eos> - Why should we trust you?<eos> - Because Alex and Ryan do.
But the point is if a fellow officer said to me she felt her instincts were saying this was the wrong call, I would trust her on that.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - What?<eos> I change my vote, too.<eos> - Don't do it for me.
Let me hear you say, "Yee-haw!"<eos> I'm just glad you found me.<eos> I was about to build a hut for the night.<eos> I thought you said you didn't pick up strange men.<eos> I didn't.
Wish me luck.<eos> I'm going to need it.<eos> I... I know I should be relieved...<eos> Well, no one's gonna blame you for still worrying.<eos> Gold did the right thing today.
- You're freaking out because you got some sword hanging over your head?<eos> Me, too, and I can't do a damn thing about it except wait.<eos> You can fix your stupid sword.<eos> Go home and get the freaking execution over with.<eos> I did.
Basin.<eos> Clips, please.<eos> Boki.<eos> We decided not to list him.<eos> No, you did.
Ah, it's okay.<eos> No, it's not.<eos> You were right.<eos> I was tired, but I have to learn to push past it.<eos> And you did.
I don't got to take a lie detector test.<eos> Course not, 'cause you know it's gonna tell us you're lying.<eos> Did Diaz tell you to kill Miranda Gibbs?<eos> I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> Sure you do.
I am doing my job.<eos> How's that?<eos> Letting him be him.<eos> As if you had a choice.<eos> He does.
It wasn't until the 2006 afc championship when they played the broncos.<eos> No.<eos> Okay. Anyway, I wanted to watch 'em with my dad.<eos> (Chuckles)<eos> And I did.
Damn.<eos> That's a lot.<eos> You saw the wall.<eos> Well, congrats on all the changes, man, and, uh... if you ever need anything again, you have my number.<eos> - I do.
I was... I was hoping you could tell me how to fix her.<eos> Sit down, Jack.<eos> She lost a baby, Jack.<eos> You can't just dismiss that.<eos> So did I. Yeah.
Peacefully with his arms crossed over his chest, no doubt.<eos> I have no idea how I came from that man.<eos> I'm so sorry, babe.<eos> Yeah, I don't know what I expected.<eos> Yes, I do.
A master bedroom closet that happens to have a mini-bar in it.<eos> Maybe it's time we go at it alone for a while, you know? Just for a little while to see what happens.<eos> You know, maybe we need to grow up a bit.<eos> I don't really know who I am if I'm not your sister.<eos> I do.
24 hours of seasickness?<eos> No, thanks.<eos> I'll pass.<eos> You know, they make medication for that.<eos> Do they ever.
Hard worker.<eos> But she just joined the ship, sir.<eos> What does that mean?<eos> I didn't know her personally, sir.<eos> None of us did.
And if he doesn't answer all of their questions, you have my permission to shoot him.<eos> Mm.<eos> It'll be a mercy killing.<eos> Not like this job wasn't hard enough before, you know?<eos> I do, actually.
Put your hands up.<eos> No!<eos> No.<eos> So, why don't you tell us why you boarded the ship as Stewart Baxter and filmed classified areas.<eos> I didn't.
Well, except one.<eos> (clears throat)<eos> That I gave her a necklace instead of a ring.<eos> You know what I mean?<eos> I do.
That's why I fed you fake Intel.<eos> What?<eos> The plaque was never in "Cold Cases 1972."<eos> As if I'd just put it in a box, unattended.<eos> Uh, but you did.
What?<eos> The plaque was never in "Cold Cases 1972."<eos> As if I'd just put it in a box, unattended.<eos> Uh, but you did.<eos> No, I didn't.
So thank you, oil.<eos> [Megaphone screeches]<eos> Big corporations are pillaging Mother Earth.<eos> But don't big corporations always have our best interests at heart?<eos> No, they don't.
[Clears throat]<eos> [Humming]<eos> Boop.<eos> You didn't return them, did you?<eos> No, I did not.
I'd expect to see intracranial bleeding within hours.<eos> Treatment?<eos> He's been receiving transfusions for many years.<eos> If I give him another at this point, he's liable to suffer autoimmune shock.<eos> - And if you don't?
I don't know who that is.<eos> You were 14 years old when your father married you to a man 40 years older than you.<eos> I can't imagine what that was like.<eos> Fathers are supposed to protect their daughters.<eos> Yours didn't.
Like, we were supposed to do this together?<eos> Or like, I agreed to go out with you because you were gonna lose the weight<eos> - for me.<eos> And...<eos> - And I did.
It lights up.<eos> It does?<eos> Come show me.<eos> Well, would you look at that.<eos> So it does.
Well, tell me I'm wrong to be scared.<eos> - You know, tell me I should vote yay. - Nick, I whipped everyone's votes.<eos> I'm not gonna whip yours.<eos> But whatever you decide, I support you.<eos> We all do.
You surprised me with that text.<eos> Figured I'd do one better.<eos> Surprise you back.<eos> Yeah.<eos> You did that.
I made a mistake, and I missed the deadline, and I didn't renew it, and then it's all gone!<eos> It's all gone!<eos> What?<eos> No! They can't do that!<eos> Well, they did!
Somewhere between one in a billion and impossible.<eos> How do they help us land?<eos> Hey, there.<eos> I don't know what else to do.<eos> Well, I do.
There's a difference.<eos> What happened to you in Georgetown?<eos> Since most of our viewers don't believe in demon possession, can you help me... help us... understand what you went through?<eos> I-I don't really remember it.<eos> You do.
What happened to you in Georgetown?<eos> Since most of our viewers don't believe in demon possession, can you help me... help us... understand what you went through?<eos> I-I don't really remember it.<eos> You do.<eos> She does.
I mean, she was just a kid.<eos> She didn't do anything wrong.<eos> She didn't ask for any of this.<eos> No, I...<eos> Of course she didn't.
The night of the jump, something changed.<eos> I didn't want Bennett to die.<eos> I tried to get him to call off the jump.<eos> But he wouldn't listen.<eos> He never did.
Can I ask you how Stuart seemed that night?<eos> He was concerned.<eos> It wasn't like her to just not show up.<eos> He called her a bunch of times.<eos> We all did.
And that boy I am charged with protecting.<eos> Then find him.<eos> That's the duty you're charged with.<eos> Then help me.<eos> I just did.
Appears Big Brother was watching.<eos> And look what he saw.<eos> Took a taxi.<eos> We can blow that up, get his medallion number.<eos> Already done.
I've been thinking about what you asked for, about turning Roman.<eos> I'm afraid it's a risk that we just can't afford to take.<eos> He can change.<eos> I understand where you're coming from...<eos> I do.
You would rather not exist than be part of my world? !<eos> As if there's something wrong with me!<eos> Is there something wrong with me?<eos> Because if there is, it's because of you.<eos> You did this to me!
'Sup?<eos> What's up?<eos> Roommate not home?<eos> Look, you don't got to worry about Miracella anymore, all right?<eos> But you do.
Raimy!<eos> - Hey.<eos> - What?<eos> I thought I told you to put your clothes away?<eos> - And I did.
You're the Evil Queen.<eos> You don't remember me.<eos> I know exactly who you are.<eos> My parents banished you.<eos> Uh, no, they didn't.
Prince Henry!<eos> Look at him.<eos> He looks so grown-up.<eos> Do you, Prince Henry, undertake to accept the accolade of knighthood?<eos> I do.
I wish... that the Evil Queen gets exactly... what she deserves.<eos> Aladdin, what's going on?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I granted your wish.<eos> No, you didn't.
I can't reach the team.<eos> Neither can I. All right, they used Allie as a decoy to lure me away.<eos> We have to abort this mission.<eos> You don't think Jane might have...<eos> No, I don't!
What about the tox report?<eos> The driver wasn't drunk.<eos> There was nothing there.<eos> Hey, look, I know how hard this can be.<eos> No, you don't.
What if he pleads down, or walks?<eos> If we get him the right way, and he walks, I will help you find him.<eos> I'm not asking for your help, Roger.<eos> I know.<eos> You never do.
Do you have access to the rooftops?<eos> Have you checked the windows?<eos> Where's the intelligence officer? Why am I talking to this guy?<eos> Father Bennett, I don't tell you how to say mass... don't tell me<eos> - how to do my job.
Good, because I had an idea.<eos> I'd like to spend some time with you in person.<eos> It's been weeks.<eos> You want me to come to Philadelphia?<eos> I don't.
Mr. Cruz being a witness-- that's part of the State's case.<eos> I'm confused as to why they would introduce him.<eos> Leon Walker's DNA and fingerprints were found at the scene, there was a ballistics match on his weapon, and the money was recovered in his apartment.<eos> So what Cruz saw or didn't see doesn't bloody matter.<eos> It does now.
We looked through the trash you put out on the curb last night, Mr. Lima.<eos> We found pet store receipts that show you purchased the supplies needed to house and feed a coastal taipan.<eos> The venom from that species poisoned seven people at Arrondissement 21 and killed your friend Brian Beale.<eos> I don't even know who that is.<eos> Sure you do.
Do you want to grab a drink some time?<eos> See? That.<eos> That is what I mean.<eos> No, I do not want to grab a drink with you.<eos> Yes. Yes, you do.
I'm touched that you want to.<eos> I really am.<eos> Come here.<eos> Look, I know a lot of you guys didn't come up in this program.<eos> But I did.
Uh... fish don't, uh, travel well across the pond.<eos> Oh, I will be the best fish mom.<eos> Uh, really, Abby?<eos> Because growing up, they called me "The Fish Whisperer""<eos> They did not.
Uh, really, Abby?<eos> Because growing up, they called me "The Fish Whisperer""<eos> They did not.<eos> They did.<eos> No, they did not.
They did not.<eos> They did.<eos> No, they did not.<eos> They did. - No.<eos> They did not.
No, they did not.<eos> They did. - No.<eos> They did not.<eos> - They did. - Uh-huh.<eos> They did.
Uh, our missing liquor store attendant is Victor Medina, 32 years old.<eos> Yeah, he used to be a Marine.<eos> And will always be.<eos> Medina received a Silver Star for his actions during an ambush in Afghanistan.<eos> He also did a tour in Iraq.
Apartment thing's a minefield.<eos> How you gonna decide who gets it?<eos> I was hoping you would have some words of wisdom.<eos> Nope.<eos> Abby did what?
Think you're gonna have to make a decision.<eos> Which reminds me, there's something I wanted to tell you about.<eos> Oh. What is it?<eos> I finally proposed to Delilah.<eos> Oh. You did?
Which reminds me, there's something I wanted to tell you about.<eos> Oh. What is it?<eos> I finally proposed to Delilah.<eos> Oh. You did?<eos> I did.
TRUMP:'I've dealt with everybody.<eos> 'And by the way, I can tell you something else!<eos> ' What?<eos> 'I've dealt with Gaddafi.'<eos> What did you do?
No.<eos> Whoa, wallpaper.<eos> _<eos> Yes.<eos> Done.
I, uh... It's my fault.<eos> I know I'm supposed to ignore him, but... he just throws down at the worst times.<eos> I know.<eos> He does it to me, too, but listen, I called the pediatrician.<eos> You did?
You mean Logan.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Logan.<eos> I don't know where he is.<eos> None of us do.
- Shut up.<eos> Garrett, shut up! Just shut up.<eos> You son of fucking bitch.<eos> Hey, hey, hey. You smoked our shit, didn't you?<eos> Yes, you did.
I have to let you know, I don't have his number.<eos> I don't even know Garrett.<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> - You don't know who Garrett is?<eos> I don't.
There's people on there that thought they were going to a fucking supermarket, and we all ended up on a beach... - Everybody on that bus had been warned.<eos> You knew what was happening.<eos> You knew what was happening,<eos> Garrett knew what was happening, all of them knew what was happening.<eos> But they didn't.
She left. I...<eos> I don't know.<eos> Do you know where she went?<eos> No.<eos> I don't.
"Show"?<eos> What show?<eos> You guys are on a show together or...<eos> You didn't know Kylie stars on a show?<eos> Actually, no, I actually do. Um...
- Don't remind me.<eos> - Who had died...<eos> The other Spencer Davis had a very contentious divorce.<eos> You called her a bitch.<eos> No, he did.
She made the money so you wouldn't have to?<eos> Do you know where she is?<eos> I swear, I don't know what happened to her.<eos> - I don't know who took her.<eos> - I do.
I know who you are.<eos> Now, what the hell are you doing here?<eos> Listen, I am not here trying to cause any problems.<eos> I'm just trying to figure out how you knew Sarah Keaton.<eos> I don't.
Did you see my double?<eos> You had a hit?<eos> I had three hits.<eos> I'm just kidding you.<eos> Of course you did.
But my mom's in there.<eos> It's the epicenter of drama.<eos> Which is why you and I will be taking over the cooking.<eos> Oh. Likey.<eos> Don't do that.
Don't-don't you dare.<eos> - What, don't do what?<eos> Don't do...<eos> - Riggs.<eos> - Don't do...
So, you were never after the drugs.<eos> It's always been about money laundering.<eos> Which the Hongs are the key to.<eos> Oh, I'm sorry... they were... until you guys scared them off.<eos> Except they didn't.
Someone saw me at the precinct.<eos> An old coworker.<eos> At any moment, the lab is going to realize that the knife is missing, and when that happens, I will be screwed.<eos> You should have thought about that before you decided to steal evidence.<eos> I did!
I didn't mean it when I said that I didn't care.<eos> I want you to be here.<eos> So take shifts as much as you can.<eos> Well, it's... it's okay. You know, I get it.<eos> No, I actually do.
Okay, but you may feel some discomfort.<eos> I'm kidding, I want you to feel at home here.<eos> Decorate it any way that makes you happy.<eos> Do you really mean that?<eos> I really do.
They know everything about who owes who money.<eos> There's a manager of the water department who's cheating on his wife.<eos> But as far as a blue truck or any strangers lurking around or suspicious activity, we got nothing.<eos> None of our vics have any connection to this area.<eos> - Maybe the Nightingale does.
No. Nobody knew what I was doing.<eos> Oh.<eos> Why did you send that sex video to "Louise Herrick Live"?<eos> Why?<eos> I did the security installation at that house, for cost.
Jake, uh, Johnny Weston's father is here?<eos> He says you called him.<eos> I did.<eos> Well, he knows we represent Maya, right?<eos> He does.
Almost.<eos> There's no record of Damien Novak having been a customer there.<eos> Perhaps our predator- predator lured him on a different dating site.<eos> So we still don't know who this guy is.<eos> We do not.
You'd have to be an idiot to rent a room in your own name and then blow a guy away outside of it.<eos> That said... you kept things from us.<eos> It makes us wonder what else you kept from us.<eos> Maybe you saw or heard something.<eos> You did, didn't you?
No, give it up for the devil sticks.<eos> - They're the real heroes here.<eos> - No, they are not.<eos> No one thinks that. All right, I'm not sure how much time we have, but anybody know a joke?<eos> Oh, I do!
Here, have a cupcake.<eos> They say "Kenneth."<eos> And I say Kenneth is great.<eos> - Got a "K."<eos> - It does, yeah.
I didn't even think to check, you know?<eos> By the time I realized something, I was in a spider web.<eos> Yep.<eos> I told you to look in the ledger.<eos> No, you didn't.
Earth is the only planet we know of where life exists.<eos> And, here, it does so in abundance.
They got robbed the day before their grand opening.<eos> I never solved that one.<eos> That bothered me for 20 years.<eos> But I see that you wrote a note here that says,<eos> "Contractor did it, so obvious."
- Yep.<eos> - Jury's still out.<eos> - Uh-oh. - Doesn't matter.<eos> It only matters what Amy thinks, and apparently she loves you.<eos> I do.
He is the face of the enemy we must always fight, always overcome.<eos> And if we are the lambs of god, then he...<eos> He is the eternal wolf.<eos> Sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt.<eos> You didn't.
All right.<eos> I can see you're upside-down about this.<eos> I'll do what I can.<eos> Got something for me?<eos> I do.
Donald can never, ever know!<eos> Know what? !<eos> That his mother and I were lovers.<eos> Did he just say what I think he said?<eos> Yes, he did.
Bubbles?<eos> I was 25 years her junior and not English, and for Victoria, that was scandalous.<eos> If you and Ducky's mother were such a hot item, why did she take out an ad in the paper looking for an old fiancé?<eos> She didn't.<eos> I did.
Hello, Agent Gibbs.<eos> Do you have news about my father's case?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Unfortunately, I do.
Take your time.<eos> Dad, I'm really gonna miss you.<eos> I hope that wherever you are, the New York Mets are on and it's always the '86 World Series.<eos> I loved being your son.<eos> I still do.
So I will have the chance to speak?<eos> I'll talk about the gods, about my joy of entering Valhalla.<eos> Even though you don't believe it.<eos> I don't.<eos> But my sons do.
- Are you drunk?<eos> Yes.<eos> I ever tell you my mother used to... clean houses?<eos> I'd watch her wrestle that octopus of a vacuum cleaner of hers and I just wanted to help her. I just... I thought I could invent a better one than that.<eos> - And so I did.
Good to meet you guys.<eos> Bishop's talked so much about you.<eos> It's good to put faces to the names.<eos> So, work with our sister?<eos> I do.
By who?<eos> The defense firm I worked for.<eos> We were told to help prolong the confinement of detainees who refused to produce Intel vital to the War on Terror.<eos> And how do you sleep at night?<eos> I didn't.
The primary account holder:<eos> Gareth Bainbridge.<eos> Hi there.<eos> Agent Quinn, did we have an appointment?<eos> We didn't, no.
That the first female to solo anchor the news slept her way to the top.<eos> Well...<eos> Ronald had been harassing me for years.<eos> - You know his reputation.<eos> - I do.
You left the bowling alley for 54 minutes.<eos> That's plenty of time to drive back to the house, kill Johnny, and return to the bowling alley.<eos> That is insane!<eos> Tell her that I did not kill Johnny.<eos> He didn't.
You represent my daughter.<eos> You know, given what you just admitted to, you are the one that needs the lawyer.<eos> Now, look, Dana, I-I get it.<eos> You confessed because you want to help Maya.<eos> So do I.
Good as gold.<eos> The gold medal of friendship... - goes to us. - Oh!<eos> I don't know where to look.<eos> Okay, well, have to get back to work.<eos> You do that.
Don't leave, I'm in the elevator!<eos> Where's my bullets?<eos> Where'd I put 'em?<eos> Well, why were you shooting off your gun?<eos> I didn't.
I'm still waiting for it to sink in.<eos> I'm not sure what I'll do when it does.<eos> You'll try to deal, help the others to deal.<eos> Not sure I have it in me.<eos> Did you?
And you're watching the movie.<eos> You had me at hello.<eos> Claire is eating her olives.<eos> I don't like olives.<eos> Claire does.
Like "yeast."<eos> So I'll coordinate with the transit cops while you follow up with the DA's off...<eos> Uh, can I help you,<eos> - Oh, hey, uh, did you guys see a black backpack sitting around anywhere?<eos> - I did not.
Well, the bag belongs to one of his runners, and it contains, like, a football's worth of cocaine...<eos> I'm not good with sizes...<eos> and a cell phone.<eos> And you think that the cell phone might have Intel that could lead us to Flaco.<eos> I do now.
- Damn.<eos> - Oh, I don't know if you knew this, but... I'm a cop.<eos> So maybe this time, don't lie to me.<eos> Hey, I didn't know you guys were police.<eos> Well, now you do, genius.
Hi, Oscar.<eos> Hey, baby.<eos> Teddy, this has gone far enough.<eos> I want you to come home.<eos> You do?
But I designed it.<eos> But you made me order it because you were "too well-known"<eos> in the flag community and they'd jack up the price.<eos> But you don't even understand its symbolism.<eos> Oh, I do.
But I noticed there were shops on either side that had working cameras, so I called them and asked them to send me footage.<eos> And you checked for albinos?<eos> Well, until I fell asleep.<eos> I didn't find anything.<eos> I did.
So, Sherlock thinks there's no way he would've submitted bad research to the FDA.<eos> So, he went to Next Century Meats, and got them to give us Pereya's undoctored research.<eos> And you're comparing it to the work that was submitted to the FDA.<eos> You think someone doctored Pereya's work?<eos> Sherlock does.
You know what people thought was dangerous?<eos> Fire, technology, chemistry.<eos> Yeah, they thought they were all magic until they learned how to use them properly.<eos> You don't know how to use magic.<eos> You don't, all right?
So if you're him, you need to convince me.<eos> First question, how come I didn't know you had a sister?<eos> Olafsson, come on.<eos> You knew I had a sister.<eos> - No I didn't.
First question, how come I didn't know you had a sister?<eos> Olafsson, come on.<eos> You knew I had a sister.<eos> - No I didn't.<eos> - Yes, you did.
God, who can remember that?<eos> It was 150 years ago, which would have been the cholera outbreak in London!<eos> You wouldn't have missed that.<eos> You love plagues!<eos> Who doesn't?
You were always jealous of me.<eos> The Viking warriors always paid more fealty to me because they liked me better, and that made you crazy.<eos> Well, you bribed them!<eos> You said they'd cross oceans if they prayed to you.<eos> - They did!
No.<eos> He didn't do this.<eos> But how do you know that?<eos> I just...<eos> I just do.
Hunched over, like he had a stomachache.<eos> I just thought he was sick.<eos> So now you're wondering if this was an addict who was in withdrawal?<eos> Well, Dr. Krieg told him to leave.<eos> And he did.
I think I know what's going on.<eos> You do?<eos> I, uh... talked to your mother.<eos> You did not tell her that we haven't had sex yet.<eos> I did.
Nowhere.<eos> There are standard procedures for bringing in a new sensate.<eos> You're a cop, Will.<eos> You understand procedure.<eos> I do.
Why?<eos> Because we have to change.<eos> Become better people.<eos> What if I don't want to change?<eos> You do.
What...?<eos> - Ice-skating.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - I don't know how to ice-skate.<eos> - Yes, you do.
- Ice-skating.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - I don't know how to ice-skate.<eos> - Yes, you do.<eos> Because I do.
She isn't here.<eos> She isn't here.<eos> Hey.<eos> You see me.<eos> Yes, I do.
It's the loneliness that makes us weak.<eos> Khadgar.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I wanted to save us all.<eos> I always did.
Hi.<eos> Hi, sweetheart.<eos> It's okay, Mommy.<eos> Griffin saved me.<eos> Yeah, he did.
"This house is clean."<eos> It isn't though.<eos> Of course it is, sweetheart.<eos> You helped the spirits go into the light.<eos> But they didn't.
Stay away from Allison Ng!<eos> We've got six and a half years invested in her.<eos> She's part of Hillary Clinton's Star Guard.<eos> Know what that is?<eos> Well, neither do I!
What's your name?<eos> Linus Harp.<eos> Do you know who occupies the opposite studio?<eos> No...<eos> No one does.
And you know who I am?<eos> You were sent to protect me by John Connor, the leader of the Resistance.<eos> My son.<eos> I don't understand. You can't know any of this.<eos> But I do.
A straight line.<eos> You just go, and you don't look back.<eos> Where did you hear that?<eos> In a past I shouldn't remember.<eos> But I do.
Whatever they did to him, we need to reverse it.<eos> We need to get him back!<eos> He's not even human.<eos> We don't know what the hell he is.<eos> I do.
They think you're selling a lotta drugs.<eos> - Do they?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> And what did you tell them?<eos> That you didn't.
He seems to be involved in every crime in the city and yet the Bureau keeps saying he's clean.<eos> It's only when another agency has an informant that I hear maybe Whitey isn't so squeaky clean.<eos> Well, I hear that he's very careful, he doesn't use phones, that kinda stuff, and, uh...<eos> Who did you say these other informants were?<eos> I didn't.
Did you know it was Hampton and Dawson that hit that National Bank on Exeter?<eos> No.<eos> And neither did I, until Whitey Bulger told us.<eos> - Whitey didn't tell us that.<eos> - Yes, he did.
I don't know what happened.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> - I don't know what happened. I'm sorry. - You did this.<eos> - You did this. - Relax, relax, relax, relax!<eos> You did this!
I'm sorry.<eos> - I don't know what happened. I'm sorry. - You did this.<eos> - You did this. - Relax, relax, relax, relax!<eos> You did this!<eos> You did this!
Here!<eos> A-ha!<eos> A-ha!<eos> Wanna kill Commandant?<eos> Do it, Agu.
So, does your good wife know that you've brought all you have in the world here tonight and given it to a stranger?<eos> No, sir.<eos> You're full of surprises, aren't you?<eos> So, the Essex did not return to port.<eos> She did not.
She would.<eos> And if you had told me the story when we met, I would still wear your ring today.<eos> The strength of that boy still lives in you.<eos> I see that.<eos> Even if you don't.
Guys, can you hear me?<eos> I made it.<eos> Ben. Look at this place.<eos> It's amazing.<eos> We did it.
We need your help to finish the gate.<eos> It's the only chance we have to figure out what happened to us and reverse it.<eos> You really think that they care about us?<eos> You know how they've used Ben.<eos> Yeah. I do.
It's clobberin' time!<eos> This better work.<eos> Let's get the hell outta here!<eos> While the world may not know what you did to save it, the men and the women in this room do.<eos> And so does the president.
Stop. Why did you do that?<eos> I'm sorry, man.<eos> Come on. I was just fooling around.<eos> - That wasn't fun.<eos> - Like we always do.
I'm sorry, man.<eos> Come on. I was just fooling around.<eos> - That wasn't fun.<eos> - Like we always do.<eos> We never do that.
Hey, boo.<eos> - Wow, this is awesome.<eos> We're about to set sail through one of America's greatest aquatic treasures.<eos> - Kevin, don't hit your brother.<eos> - I didn't.
You got a sponsor for my backyard?<eos> Hey, Mr. Mayron!<eos> You want next?<eos> Nicholas, please, it's Dusty!<eos> And, yes, I do.
And that she's probably only bugging you because she likes you, buddy.<eos> I do not like him.<eos> I think she likes him.<eos> Gross, whatever.<eos> She totally does.
He's playing us.<eos> He's playing us. He's got too much skin in the game and he's dumping his position.<eos> What if he's right?<eos> You want him to be right.<eos> Yes, I do.
Mortgage fraud has quintupled since 2000 and the average take-home pay is flat, but home prices are soaring.<eos> That means the homes are debt, not assets.<eos> So Mike Burry of San Jose, a guy who gets his hair cut at Supercuts and doesn't wear shoes, knows more than Alan Greenspan and Hank Paulson.<eos> Well...<eos> Dr. Mike Burry, yes, he does.
Did you get a chance to look at what we sent you, Ben?<eos> It's Charlie.<eos> I'm here, too.<eos> Hi, Charlie.<eos> Yeah, I did.
Didn't I say when we made this deal that the ratings agencies, the SEC and the big banks were clueless?<eos> Didn't I say that?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Didn't I say it?<eos> Yes, you did.
Didn't I say that?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Didn't I say it?<eos> Yes, you did.<eos> You did.
They'll take every dime we have to offer.<eos> Kinda brilliant.<eos> This is what we did that no one else thought of.<eos> Not even Baum or Burry thought to short the AA's.<eos> But we did.
Come on.<eos> We just made the deal of our lifetimes!<eos> We should celebrate.<eos> You just bet against the American economy.<eos> Fuck, yeah, we did!
No, we're not.<eos> We're not the bad guys here.<eos> We didn't defraud the American people and prey on their dreams of owning a home.<eos> All right?<eos> They did.
She loved bees.<eos> My father would be freaking out right now.<eos> Do you know what this will do to people when they find out the truth?<eos> I don't think that most people would want to know the truth.<eos> I do.
What?<eos> Your planet is a farm Jupiter.<eos> There are thousands of planets like yours set up by families like mine to supply an ever increasing demand for more time.<eos> Are you saying you killed a hundred people to make this?<eos> Not me, but yes, someone did.
When you hear something that sounds like a gunshot... Drive.<eos> Did you get him?<eos> Let's just hope he doesn't drive as quickly as he moves.<eos> I got news for you.<eos> He does.
So, based on his calculations, it would pass by Earth in the winter 1981.<eos> - Did it?<eos> - No<eos> God!<eos> It did not!
Jenny?<eos> - Hi.<eos> - Hey.<eos> I know why you run away.<eos> You do?
And I ended up in a psychiatric institution.<eos> I was so scared I made myself sick.<eos> I gave myself a nervous breakdown.<eos> And I thought I'd never survive it.<eos> But I did.
I could pass it along to stacie.<eos> No problem.<eos> But we're not gonna do that because Laurel would never agree to it.<eos> I used to tease Laurel about her integrity, her ideals, because I'm one of those cynical, hard-ass cops who likes to say he doesn't believe in the system or justice.<eos> But Laurel does.
Guys, you know, we're almost 35.<eos> He's almost 60.<eos> I don't have to answer to this shit.<eos> Fine.<eos> Don't.
Could we talk about this at the screening tonight?<eos> No, Eric.<eos> I-I really don't want to get in any deeper.<eos> I think you're a great guy.<eos> I really do.
What, are you praying?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Somethin' wrong with that?<eos> Well, you don't believe in God, so...<eos> For the good stuff, I do.
I-is this a date?<eos> I don't cook for people who are tryin' to pitch me.<eos> Whatever.<eos> I thought a nice, normal guy wanted to hang out for once.<eos> I did!
I don't cook for people who are tryin' to pitch me.<eos> Whatever.<eos> I thought a nice, normal guy wanted to hang out for once.<eos> I did!<eos> I do!
You have the...<eos> Dana has this covered.<eos> You stay the fuck out of it!<eos> Hey, John, you can't do this!<eos> Ari, I just did.
We got a real problem with this Travis guy, and I need my manager-producer back now, okay?<eos> Okay.<eos> Did Ari tell you why he's not gonna release the money?<eos> He didn't like the movie?<eos> What didn't he like?
So that's the infamous Grizzly Maze.<eos> Yeah, that's what my dad used to call it.<eos> 'Cause even grizzly's can get lost down there.<eos> - You remember.<eos> - Of course, I do.
I was just...<eos> I was immersed in a game of bridge.<eos> Do you play?<eos> Sir, did you try to start your plane again?<eos> Yes, I did.
Approach.<eos> Sire, over what do you rule?<eos> Over everything.<eos> And the stars obey you?<eos> They certainly do.
Richer than rich.<eos> Famous as shit.<eos> More women than you know what to do with.<eos> I'm telling you this, and I've got to ask, why are you sitting there staring at me looking like that information scares the livin' shit outta you?<eos> Because it does.
What if this company goes belly-up too?<eos> That's not gonna happen, because this company is a lot bigger than Daddy's company was.<eos> And that's better, huh?<eos> They promised us a car, right, babe?<eos> Yeah, they did.
Mr. Jones yelled at me yesterday.<eos> He really blew a fuse about his car.<eos> He said you were a...<eos> - You want to know what he called you?<eos> - No, I don't.
I understand.<eos> Take a seat.<eos> Why don't you show me how you moved the bottle?<eos> - You want to see?<eos> - Yes, I do.
I'm following up on an article.<eos> The one in the Phoenix?<eos> No. In the Globe.<eos> - Did you see the one in the Phoenix?<eos> - No, I didn't.
Yeah, and there's a reason I didn't see it.<eos> Nobody reads the Phoenix anymore.<eos> They're broke.<eos> They don't have any power.<eos> The Globe does.
Sure. Right.<eos> So what happened then?<eos> You really want to hear this shit?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, Patrick, I do.
Hi, Sacha. How are you?<eos> I'm good, thanks.<eos> Um, listen, Joe, I just wanted to follow up on one thing.<eos> You talked to Phil Saviano about all of this, right?<eos> Yeah, I did.
I-I-I talked to Sipe.<eos> He said he's seen dozens of them in the '60s in Seton.<eos> He called it a "phenomenon."<eos> Why didn't he go public?<eos> He did.
- Anyone else?<eos> Occasionally the church would bring in another defense attorney to help out.<eos> You have names?<eos> Nope.<eos> No, I don't.
Hello?<eos> Uh... ninety fucking Priests? In Boston?<eos> That's what he said.<eos> If there were 90 of these bastards, people would know.<eos> Maybe they do.
I lied.<eos> We know.<eos> We all knew.<eos> - The soldiers from 13?<eos> - They did, too.
I'd be inspired.<eos> Doesn't that make the world a better place?<eos> Well, I suppose it would.<eos> If it worked.<eos> Unfortunately, it does not.
A little girl?<eos> Was it a girl? A little girl?<eos> You wanna tell me what's going on here, son?<eos> No, sir.<eos> I do not.
A man dies.<eos> Manslaughter in self-defense at most, I would say.<eos> "Wanted for murder." Have it copied.<eos> I thought you said it wasn't...<eos> I did.
Don't you see?<eos> To my mind... I took my brother's life that night.<eos> I have to redress the balance.<eos> I have to create life now.<eos> Victor, none of this does that.
And what does this have to do with guys driving motorcycles out of diamond-sorting facilities?<eos> Or raining U.S. currency down over central Mexico?<eos> Well, sir, that's what we need to find out.<eos> Those people in there, they didn't buy your theory.<eos> But I did.
Oh, Jesus Christ.<eos> Cut "Hello." No!<eos> What's the first rule of a launch?<eos> It's not gonna crash.<eos> It just did.
What's the matter with you?<eos> Why are you telling her these things?<eos> Why are you still telling her I'm her father?<eos> A judge told her you're her father.<eos> No, he didn't.
Will you do that for me?<eos> I don't have a chip on my shoulder.<eos> Okay, okay.<eos> But don't give them a reason to say you do.<eos> I don't.
Lisa's this big.<eos> They get taller.<eos> Come on.<eos> - Do you remember me?<eos> - She doesn't.
It was an unmanned satellite NASA sent up in the early '70s on a data-gathering mission.<eos> The thing is, when they sent it up, they didn't know yet how they were going to get it back.<eos> But they felt like they were close enough that in the eight years it was going to be up there, they'd figure it out.<eos> They're on their way now.<eos> They didn't.
I don't remember.<eos> We were talking and I said...<eos> It's pretty much what I just said, that it certainly couldn't hurt.<eos> You didn't say that Lisa needed a strong male role model?<eos> I did.
I was recompiling .<eos> I was trying to debug the voice demo.<eos> And you said if I couldn't find a solution, you'd call me out in front of the audience.<eos> Did it say "hello"?<eos> It did.
It's not what I really think.<eos> Behind my back, at the office, you know what it stood for?<eos> Local Integrated System Architecture. I was five!<eos> Why couldn't you just lie?<eos> I did.
You want to watch from backstage?<eos> Okay.<eos> Go, Cue 1.<eos> You remember that painting you did on the original Mac?<eos> I do.
That haunted show is a joke.<eos> You're such a turd.<eos> - Not that show again.<eos> You watch that, do you'?<eos> Yeah, he does. You do.
What do your rules say now?<eos> That all will be eaten.<eos> This system is really rigged against us.<eos> You forgot to glaze me.<eos> No, I didn't.
So more like,<eos> "Whoa, I should have brushed my teeth before I left the house this morning."<eos> Or studio apartment, if we're getting real here.<eos> Did you really not brush your teeth this morning?<eos> No, I did.
I sold...?<eos> At least I didn't abandon my wife and kid and become the world's biggest junkie.<eos> I did fuck everything up, didn't I?<eos> I miss you, Dick.<eos> I really do.
What...?<eos> What does that mean?<eos> I don't want you to be empty out there.<eos> It gives me confidence.<eos> It does.
Yes!<eos> Fa-da!<eos> it has worked.<eos> It worked!<eos> You did it, Oh!
Call me Tip.<eos> It was a new home, a new country.<eos> I tried to make friends at school... but I was this nerd from Barbados.<eos> But you dids to get an "A" in geometry.<eos> Yeah, I did.
Gorg.<eos> This makes no sense.<eos> I stopped the message.<eos> Gorg cannot to finding us.<eos> Then how did they?
Nah. Don't think this is racial or anything, but I never feel like you people are clean.<eos> This is a housekeeper you're talking to, remember?<eos> I can tell if a Brit's been in a room, just like that.<eos> Why should I think that was racial or anything?<eos> Glad you don't.
If you're gonna answer them to your satisfaction, do what you will.<eos> First, why would I use a gun?<eos> The fuck kind of question is that?<eos> Why does anybody use a gun?<eos> Nicholas never does.
What?<eos> The deer.<eos> Where you got out, it's where we hit something when we arrived.<eos> - Did you?<eos> - No, Elliot, I didn't.
Two men come up on me looking for a fight, so I gave it to 'em.<eos> Cut one of 'em up pretty bad, outdrew on the other.<eos> Told him to pick up his partner and get.<eos> All I had to do was leave that town.<eos> But I didn't.
You said write about one boy.<eos> Suggest the issues through one boy's story. A personal portrait.<eos> And you were right. You were absolutely right.<eos> I assumed you had the research.<eos> - I did, just not all in one place.
This is all your fault!<eos> My fault?<eos> You're the one who stole the wrong secret formula.<eos> I didn't know there were two bottles.<eos> Of course you didn't!
Scarlet!<eos> Scarlet!<eos> What?<eos> Oh, you've gotta be kidding me!<eos> Oh no, you don't!
This thing we've got going on... that you like to call a relationship.<eos> It's fizzled out, run out of steam.<eos> Not worth fighting for anymore.<eos> You don't mean that!<eos> Yes I do!
Asking for Liz.<eos> Just a heads up.<eos> Didn't know you were a morning person.<eos> I didn't know anyone was up.<eos> Well now you do.
- We're fucking.<eos> - That's not love.<eos> You don't mean that.<eos> You don't mean that!<eos> Yes I do!
What?<eos> Wulfric and Ivy?<eos> The hell is that?<eos> They work here?<eos> No they don't.
I've been in this business for years.<eos> I know what I'm talking about.<eos> Hey.<eos> Did you miss me?<eos> Oh yes, you did.
Christian, just open the door.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> It's called a flogger.<eos> Say something, please.<eos> Do women do this to you?
So, don't minimize my company's interests.<eos> Now, if you would please, as I said before, walk with me.<eos> We can discuss this in my office.<eos> Chuck, just because you caught me... which is, granted, a pretty big feat... in a trust fall at the company retreat... which you make us all go to... and that I don't like, by the way, that nobody here really likes.<eos> Nobody does.
But you got a box with office belongings.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I brought it to the interview to show confidence.<eos> Do you have any sales experience?<eos> Yes, I do.
Bye, Dad.<eos> Bye.<eos> Can we deal with the whole private school thing today?<eos> Do you mean, like the pros and cons?<eos> No, we did the pros and cons.
Mike, did you go to college?<eos> I did not.<eos> On your resume, it said that you went to Ithaca College.<eos> No.<eos> I didn't.
The "Dad" one?<eos> Shit.<eos> I was still working...<eos> I wrote it.<eos> I did it.
Actually, this is it.<eos> You're like a clone.<eos> Oh, boy.<eos> This looks like a nice party.<eos> Yeah, it does.
Nowhere.<eos> What's going on?<eos> The meeting was brought forward.<eos> Did you not get the message?<eos> - No, we didn't.
Asked me to treat him as a brother.<eos> My little brother.<eos> They formed quite an attachment.<eos> So... you killed him.<eos> Yes, I did.
Ten minutes before I'm supposed to meet you and I'm standing ankle-deep in sewage that's pouring through this old lady's ceiling.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Even if you're thinking of inviting me in for a coffee, I'd have to say no for your sake.<eos> So how did you fix it in 10 minutes?<eos> I didn't.
A face.<eos> He wanted something.<eos> Not information.<eos> He could've killed me.<eos> But he didn't.
But make sure you're not being followed.<eos> I didn't win those opera tickets, did I?<eos> No, I'm afraid not.<eos> - So, where do we meet?<eos> - We don't.
Do you want me to write it down?<eos> No, I trust you.<eos> Nicky.<eos> Then it's her turn.<eos> Just do it.
Fair catch if you have to!<eos> Set up to run!<eos> Let's go!<eos> I don't know.<eos> I don't...
$100.<eos> How much did this cost?<eos> $20.<eos> That doesn't pay off, then.<eos> No, no, it doesn't.
You won a fight by not doing anything.<eos> Did you used to box or something?<eos> A little actually.<eos> Neat.<eos> So, what do you do anyway?
Every effort to save us, every shift in the bricks, I think, "This will set it off."<eos> We wait for two days for Tony Stark to kill us.<eos> I know what they are.<eos> I wondered why only you two survived Strucker's experiments.<eos> Now I don't.
Still, I'd pay folding money to know who it is.<eos> I might need to visit Oslo.<eos> Find our unknown.<eos> Well, this is good times, boss, but I was kind of hoping when I saw you, you'd have more than that.<eos> I do.
- How about "none-ce"?<eos> - Shut it down!<eos> - Nope, not gonna happen.<eos> You don't know what you're doing.<eos> And you do?
And they met in the grief group?<eos> Mm-hmm, while we were still married.<eos> Yeah, I guess you could have put odds on our divorce.<eos> No, people don't think like that.<eos> Yes, they do.
Some of the time.<eos> Did you worry about me?<eos> Did you think about me?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I did.
It's pretty amazing stuff.<eos> Indulge us, okay.<eos> Is this some kind of a recruitment video?<eos> I really don't want to...<eos> I do.
She was all light, all light.<eos> During times like this, um, nights like this night...<eos> I think of her quite a bit.<eos> Did she, uh, pass away?<eos> Yes, she did.
- Thank you.<eos> - Here you go.<eos> Most people don't really like to look at me too much because, you know...<eos> I think you're lovely.<eos> No, you don't.
I think I know what's going on.<eos> You do?<eos> I, uh... talked to your mother.<eos> You did not tell her that we haven't had sex yet.<eos> I did.
Nowhere.<eos> There are standard procedures for bringing in a new sensate.<eos> You're a cop, Will.<eos> You understand procedure.<eos> I do.
Why?<eos> Because we have to change.<eos> Become better people.<eos> What if I don't want to change?<eos> You do.
What...?<eos> - Ice-skating.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - I don't know how to ice-skate.<eos> - Yes, you do.
- Ice-skating.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - I don't know how to ice-skate.<eos> - Yes, you do.<eos> Because I do.
He's just a friend.<eos> But she'll be screwing Ryan in a week. Trust me.<eos> Hey. guys, look out! Shit, it's us.<eos> Did you just check out my ass?<eos> Yeah. Yeah, I did.
-We gotta fix this.<eos> I'm not even buying it. I don't even think...<eos> Dude, you were the one who set the rules!<eos> You're the one who said that we had to be all freaking careful!<eos> I did.
Twice before?<eos> How do I know that?<eos> Jesus, David.<eos> I mean, did you ever stop to think that maybe I've liked you since the first time I met you?<eos> No, I didn't.
Knock it down. Come on.<eos> -Rudy!<eos> -Do it, Tony.<eos> -I don't know.<eos> -Just do it.
I've got ideas, you know.<eos> There are things that I'd like to do.<eos> I spoke to him about a project that Dad and I have been designing.<eos> Right, Dad?<eos> Yes, we did.
That she'd go on to make another 100 record-setting patents.<eos> Skinny 'velvet-hangers' make neater closets.<eos> That's a big deal to a lot of people.<eos> I mean, who thinks of things like that?<eos> Joy did.
He needs you.<eos> You're going to be very big over there.<eos> That's what's going to happen.<eos> But, you didn't hear it from me, right?<eos> No, I sure didn't.
Thank you.<eos> Oh, thank...<eos> Get away from here.<eos> You... you have to help us.<eos> I already did.
And it was the middle of the beginning of the end.<eos> Of the world.<eos> Of the world.<eos> And... I was driving, and something told me to stop, something in here.<eos> So I did.
- In here?<eos> - Mm-hmm.<eos> So I picked you up, and you said...<eos> "Save me. "<eos> So I did.
What was your job when you were based here?<eos> Sanitation.<eos> Sanitation?<eos> Then how do you know how to disable the shields?<eos> I don't.
I know you had designs!<eos> That was years ago.<eos> And she refused me.<eos> And now I'm out here risking my life for both of you perhaps that entitles me to an occasional innuendo.<eos> Well, it doesn't!
Yeah.<eos> Yeah.<eos> But it's got tincture in it.<eos> You have tincture of opium?<eos> We do.
Yeah, I did fix it, though, didn't I?<eos> - You did, yeah.<eos> - Didn't I?<eos> Yeah, Buds.<eos> You did.
No, they won't. No, they won't.<eos> Do you think they got the guy who shot Pop?<eos> You think they got him?<eos> No, Jakey!<eos> I did!
Do you think they got the guy who shot Pop?<eos> You think they got him?<eos> No, Jakey!<eos> I did!<eos> I did.
It's so fun here.<eos> - Is Dennis okay? - Oh.<eos> Of course.<eos> - You want to see him? - Yes.<eos> Yes, I do.
That would be best for everybody.<eos> I gave you my permission, but it was for a sports club, not for fencing.<eos> I don't think the parents will approve, either.<eos> But we don't know that before the meeting, do we?<eos> No, we don't.
Very good.<eos> "Announce-ment...<eos> All-Soviet..."<eos> Teacher, guess what Jaan found!<eos> - My grandfather did.
In trade, we all work together.<eos> To get better prices and to help each other.<eos> And what do you think?<eos> Does this work or not?<eos> It does.
Even better.<eos> Sailors are conservative.<eos> You can't just make anyone admiral of the fleet.<eos> That's not how it works.<eos> Yes, it does.
We have to get out of here.<eos> Can you walk?<eos> I've got you.<eos> And you don't know where he went?<eos> No, sir, I don't.
Is that it?<eos> You play the part well.<eos> The other day, my daughter asked me why I didn't like you.<eos> Honestly, at the time, I had no good answer.<eos> But now, I do.
We've done it.<eos> We've done it, Lucille.<eos> I can't wait for Edith to see it.<eos> Edith?<eos> I did this with you.
I did.<eos> You poisoned me!<eos> I did.<eos> You told me you loved me!<eos> I do.
And please explain the hat.<eos> So what do you think?<eos> You like the place?<eos> I think it could be really great.<eos> Yes, I do.
- How clever of Sonny to buy it.<eos> - Except he didn't buy it.<eos> You speak for me?<eos> How do you know?<eos> Because I did.
25,000 Rupees...<eos> Done.<eos> What did I say?<eos> That you understood every word he was saying and he should have more respect for his elders.<eos> Well, he does now.
I finished my shift early.<eos> I felt like being alone.<eos> Oh, call for the doctor, Sonny.<eos> Nimish asked me to marry him this morning.<eos> And Abhilash did the same this afternoon.
You know, when we met you said you were lonely.<eos> I was.<eos> It doesn't mean I was celibate.<eos> I don't want to be that lonely again, Norman.<eos> Neither do I.
Fuck!<eos> My life is ruined.<eos> I venture you've heard that I'm going to prison.<eos> Yeah.<eos> No, we... we all did.
Then I remembered the mileage.<eos> Reason being, I used to take a picture of the odometer all the time to keep people from accusing me of joyriding'.<eos> People do that?<eos> That's awful.<eos> Yeah, you did it like three times.
Yeah.<eos> It's okay to just be silent for a while.<eos> Look, I know you're really bracing for this sweet girl that you probably like a lot to die.<eos> Just please bear with me.<eos> She doesn't.
She went into a coma shortly after that, and died about 10 hours later.<eos> I know I told you she doesn't die.<eos> And I'm sorry.<eos> Deep down somehow, I didn't think she would.<eos> But she did.
Wait.<eos> Wait.<eos> I know how this looks.<eos> No.<eos> You don't.
And that doesn't matter either.<eos> Because those are both just hypothetical future scenarios.<eos> No one ejaculated inside of anything, really.<eos> No one's ejaculated.<eos> Yeah, I did.
I said give me an update!<eos> I said!<eos> I supposed I should be flattered.<eos> I didn't think I merited a contract.<eos> You don't.
Look at his eyes, and tell me that I'm lying.<eos> Why would anyone want to kill me?<eos> For the same reason you're trying to look for someone you can't find.<eos> The man I'm looking for, Do you know where he is?<eos> No, but you do.
Say it!<eos> Say it!<eos> You're not.<eos> You missed.<eos> No she didn't.
And he didn't pull the trigger.<eos> He wanted me to know he beat me.<eos> Well, what the fuck is he?<eos> People just don't walk away from four bullets.<eos> They just don't.
Swear to me that you're not going to hurt him.<eos> Swear it.<eos> Alright, I swear it.<eos> Diana, did you hear that?<eos> I did.
- You tell me.<eos> - No games.<eos> - What makes you think this is a game?<eos> The cameras in the Terminal didn't see me.<eos> But the one outside, near the exit, did.
This is just experimental, Doc.<eos> I've seen it work... And believe me when I tell you don't want to be the one.<eos> You're a bastard.<eos> I know.<eos> No. you don't.
Your note said that you know me, but I don't know you.<eos> But that's not really true, is it, Hathaway?<eos> Yeah?<eos> I know you.<eos> Ah, you do? (SCOFFS)
Dig deep, Doug, dig deep.<eos> There you go.<eos> There ya go.<eos> You made it!<eos> You did it!
And you think I'm that type of guy?<eos> No.<eos> No one has ever done anything like this for me before.<eos> So... do you like North Carolina?<eos> Yeah, I do.
Yeah, okay.<eos> Excuse us, sorry.<eos> Sorry.<eos> So how do you know which one you're gonna get?<eos> You don't.
It's never goodbye.<eos> Hey, thought you could leave without saying goodbye?<eos> I used to say I lived my life a quarter mile at a time.<eos> And I think that's why we were brothers.<eos> Because you did, too.
On your way out of the home.<eos> I love you, Mom.<eos> Don't be worried.<eos> I know, honey.<eos> So after you do that,
It's like 400 pages.<eos> I wish you could just come home already so I could suck your dick in our new restaurant.<eos> Can you start the coffee, please?<eos> Oh, I don't know how.<eos> Yes, you do.
I need some answers.<eos> I'm coming.<eos> I'm gonna be worse off now than I was before I started trying to achieve stuff.<eos> I know what it is to want things.<eos> No, you don't.
Yes.<eos> Marty and Jiselle can wait.<eos> Didn't you park over at Harold's?<eos> How do you know Harold?<eos> They don't.
You can still go to college.<eos> We'll get lifted and you'll tell us about this venture.<eos> Do any of you kids know how to make an apple bong?<eos> No one knows how to make an apple bong.<eos> I do.
Our royal master, he's murdered.<eos> - Murdered?<eos> - Murdered!<eos> Those of his chamber, their hands were all badged with blood.<eos> Wherefore did you so?
You're a Serb!<eos> Please, accept my condolences...<eos> I must go.<eos> No!<eos> Do the count again.
Tell us who shot you?<eos> A Serb.<eos> Where is the gun?<eos> I don't know...<eos> - You don't?
Gert!<eos> Sorry, Una.<eos> I've decided to go back to Tilly.<eos> I think she understands my particular body shape.<eos> She certainly does.
I'll pay.<eos> That could be awkward.<eos> Don't talk to me about awkward.<eos> Take your clothes off.<eos> The others do!
You just called me Tilly.<eos> - When?<eos> - Just then.<eos> - I never.<eos> - Yes, you did.
Icanunderstandthat.<eos> I made Heineken into a world class brand.<eos> Me. On my own.<eos> It's worth billions now.<eos> I did that.
Thelonger they don't pay the money, themoretimetheyhave to figure out who did it.<eos> You want to give up?<eos> Ido.<eos> Youwhat?<eos> I do, yeah.
Brakesisright.<eos> Aboutwhat?<eos> Money'stooheavy.<eos> We had to leave a sack in that drum.<eos> You did what?
I'm not gonna hurt you. OK?<eos> Look at me.<eos> I'm with you.<eos> Do you still love me?<eos> Yes, of course I do.
Why should it matter what it's for?<eos> It's my money.<eos> I work for it, don't I?<eos> No.<eos> You don't.
Damn it!<eos> Good morning, sleepy head.<eos> Your mother signed the release before she left. Said she had to go to work.<eos> Do you understand how screwed we are right now?<eos> No, you don't.
Oh, come on!<eos> Get it, get it to Nabor! Come on, oh! Goddamn it!<eos> How come you like soccer so much?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I just do.
It's like being in love with some tiny little brick wall.<eos> How the hell you understand her?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> It's really hard.<eos> - I don't.
You're too by-the-book.<eos> There are cops that understand the gray area... and cops who have to be eliminated.<eos> And not everybody wants to die... a poor, happy Boy Scout like your father.<eos> - That make you feel better?<eos> - No, but this does!
I'll say it once. You impressed me.<eos> You start recording in an hour, concerts begin in a week.<eos> Each concert should last 90 minutes.<eos> You do have that much material?<eos> We do.
You have two options.<eos> Concert or complex.<eos> In our world disasters don't go hand in hand. We suggest buying both.<eos> - Do you know who I fucking just played for'?<eos> - We do.
- Yes!<eos> Good.<eos> - Really!<eos> - I believe it.<eos> - No, you don't!
Good.<eos> - Really!<eos> - I believe it.<eos> - No, you don't!<eos> - Sure, I do.
Giorgio, we've already broken up.<eos> Stop it!<eos> Don't you have the slightest...<eos> - It's me, you know, don't you?<eos> - Of course I do.
- For the scooter.<eos> The scooter is far off.<eos> But you promised!<eos> - We didn't promise a thing.<eos> - Dad did.
Why are you wearing your grandmother's robe?<eos> - I had a shower and found it.<eos> - Take it off, it bothers me.<eos> - Why?<eos> - It just does...
Did you bring the translations?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Let's see.<eos> Do you like living in Grandma's house?<eos> Do you?
That's me.<eos> Tomorrow we shall sell off the Rolls to that vulgar American, Milton Krampf, and we will find that painting if it is the last thing we do.<eos> Right-y-oh.<eos> I'll call Spinoza in the morning.<eos> - Yes, do.
Fit as a fiddle!<eos> Oh, it's burning...<eos> I... I can't go on...<eos> Want to die...<eos> No, I don't.
Right.<eos> So, Jessica.<eos> So...<eos> - Tom says that you work in the City.<eos> - I do, yeah.
- Here's a good idea.<eos> Why don't you run, swim and cycle to the bar and we'll see who gets there first?<eos> - What?<eos> - You don't know what a triathlon is.<eos> - Yes, I do.
Why don't you run, swim and cycle to the bar and we'll see who gets there first?<eos> - What?<eos> - You don't know what a triathlon is.<eos> - Yes, I do.<eos> - You do, do you?
How many times I had to wipe his ass because he couldn't use his hands?<eos> Is that what you want?<eos> No.<eos> You want brain damage.<eos> Yeah, you do.
I'll be at Mickey's Gym tomorrow.<eos> I don't go there.<eos> I haven't been there in a long time.<eos> Since we're pretty much like family who won the third fight?<eos> He did.
Youre nothing in the world.<eos> I grew up with girls like you.<eos> People who sacrificed life for revenge and a cause.<eos> I know you.<eos> And so do they.
I like it.<eos> Keep going.<eos> Yousee,<eos> I know what it's like to live on the outskirts of a society that would rather have me vanish.<eos> ButI didn't.
Billie do you know who's up next?<eos> You're up next!<eos> It's Billie's butt.<eos> She doesn't want to play.<eos> Of course she does.
Oh!<eos> She's topless.<eos> I can see her breasts!<eos> WheredidYOUcomefrom ?<eos> WhatdidYOURmom do?
Look, Jeff.<eos> Dick, no dick, it doesn't matter.<eos> She doesn't want us.<eos> She doesn't want any of us.<eos> She never did.
What are you doing?<eos> You're fucking cowards, huh?<eos> Wait, please.<eos> I didn't even say anything wrong.<eos> He did.
No one's special.<eos> You of all people should understand that.<eos> Hey, you.<eos> Don't you love your wife?<eos> Of course, I do.
What?<eos> What is your husband's name?<eos> He already said his name.<eos> That's right.<eos> He did.
The first time he spoke, he said his name.<eos> Just drop it, man, okay?<eos> What's... His name?<eos> She doesn't know.<eos> Of course she doesn't.
Just drop it, man, okay?<eos> What's... His name?<eos> She doesn't know.<eos> Of course she doesn't.<eos> Yes, of course, she does.
How many people in here do you think were married?<eos> Had husbands, wives, kids?<eos> You had no problem with killing any of them.<eos> - I didn't kill them.<eos> - Yes, you did.
Had husbands, wives, kids?<eos> You had no problem with killing any of them.<eos> - I didn't kill them.<eos> - Yes, you did.<eos> We all did.
One, two, three...<eos> Is it a boy or a girl?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Don't you want to find out?<eos> Yes, of course, I do.
- Okay.<eos> - Let's do it.<eos> Okay.<eos> - What are you doing?<eos> - Just do it!
- No.<eos> The fucking caterer has the flu, except I know it's fucking bullshit because we share a client and he told me that he took a higher-paying job.<eos> The cock-sucking douche bag, the day before the motherfucking shindig!<eos> El Pollo Loco?<eos> Hey, do your friends like...
Great, thank you. - Bye.<eos> Let me see!<eos> Why are you looking at that?<eos> You said you didn't like him.<eos> - Well, I don't.
Open up, I need to piss!<eos> You're not the only ones here!<eos> - Dude, chill out!<eos> Think I'm fucking with you, right?<eos> No, I don't.
Me.<eos> You.<eos> Well, not yet awhile, surely?<eos> Did you finish what you had to do?<eos> Yes, I did.
Hey Jack, do you remember mouse?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Do you know where he is?<eos> I do.
See, slower.<eos> Come on, fat ass.<eos> Are we gonna go to your place?<eos> I thought you wanted to look at boats with me.<eos> Well, yeah, I do.
What?<eos> You look pretty.<eos> And you're not fat.<eos> You know, you have a great body.<eos> I do not.
Well, if you must know, it was your mother's.<eos> And that is not to say I was without fault, but she became increasingly frightening to me in some sense.<eos> She does not live life according to rules I understand.<eos> Pascal, do you really want to help?<eos> Yes, I do.
He's trying to better himself.<eos> I think it's noble.<eos> You don't understand him.<eos> - Minnie...<eos> You don't.
My God, are you...<eos> What are you saying?<eos> I don't even know if she has tits.<eos> No.<eos> I don't.
I love you.<eos> What?<eos> I love you.<eos> You don't love me?<eos> I do.
I love you so much.<eos> I love you.<eos> I love you.<eos> No.<eos> No, you don't.
What a rush-- it got my blood pumping in a way I thought only quiet reflection could.<eos> Fizzy water for everyone.<eos> I think we can do something a little harder than that.<eos> Now, that's a marshmallow-y s'more-garita.<eos> Homer, Homer, we did it.
Fizzy water for everyone.<eos> I think we can do something a little harder than that.<eos> Now, that's a marshmallow-y s'more-garita.<eos> Homer, Homer, we did it.<eos> Wh-What'd you do?
It's all about the transplant taking.<eos> Well, until he's better, you can come over for dinner here anytime, okay?<eos> I don't want you eating by yourself.<eos> I mean it. Thanks, but I don't wanna impose.<eos> Oh, I do.
I feel like I know you, he talks about you so much.<eos> Told me about the alternator you put in the truck.<eos> Oh, actually, Kevin helped out, too, so...<eos> Yeah?<eos> Yeah, I did.
Like what we had never even happened.<eos> It was one night, and it was a mistake!<eos> We had nothing!<eos> Hey, hey!<eos> Yes, we did.
- Quinn!<eos> - Jesus, you scared me!<eos> I need to rely on you to get him up and going.<eos> - He's lying around like a corpse.<eos> - No, I did.
You want to do something?<eos> Make sure this plan works.<eos> I'm out of options.<eos> We were so young. We thought we knew everything.<eos> We did.
We're not gonna take that hill from the Japs with bullets, bombs or fists.<eos> Yeah! We're gonna take it with blood.<eos> Whoever spills more, loses.<eos> And we don't lose.<eos> Do we? No!
Do we? No!<eos> You lose.<eos> That's what I thought.<eos> You know John Wayne?<eos> I do.
I gotta go out in the world every day. This is my work.<eos> I've got nobody else to be.<eos> I did what I had to.<eos> You did what you wanted, Eddie.<eos> And you did it for more.
Help!<eos> You're too late.<eos> I already called the police.<eos> They know where I am!<eos> No, you didn't.
~ No, I've got things I need to do.<eos> ~ I don't like being here by myself.<eos> ~ Stop worrying.<eos> ~ You don't know what he's capable of.<eos> I do.
~ This trial is gonna put more demands on you.<eos> I'll put more demands on you. ~ We want the truth to come out.<eos> ~ Knowing the truth and getting justice isn't the same thing.<eos> ~ We understand that.<eos> No, you really don't.
He says that he is coming.<eos> That is all.<eos> Strange is coming to England?<eos> ~ To you, sir.<eos> ~ To do what?
Don't try to leave, Mr. Burke.<eos> That's rule number one.<eos> Hi.<eos> Uh, who gave you permission to be back there?<eos> I did.
I need to know if Ethan is in Boise.<eos> I can't believe you went to the hospital.<eos> Maybe you do have brain damage.<eos> I thought I saw my wife and kid.<eos> Maybe you did.
At the same time, we had to gain control somehow.<eos> This one, too.<eos> Thumbprint on that one as well.<eos> - Do you understand everything?<eos> - I do, yes.
- Living in a moment I would die for.<eos> These words best describe every minute of everyday of the last five years.<eos> That's why I'm standing in front of our family and our friends but most importantly, in front of you and in the presence of God to vow to be your faithfully committed ...lifetime companion.<eos> -Do you know what I mean about the grass, Aaron?<eos> -Yes, I do.
- Rachel, come on.<eos> She's talented. She's a senior.<eos> - Kurt, she hates me.<eos> - You don't know that.<eos> No, I do.
She's talented. She's a senior.<eos> - Kurt, she hates me.<eos> - You don't know that.<eos> No, I do.<eos> All of those kids do, okay?
I'm just another homo.<eos> Dude, that's not true, okay?<eos> Times have changed. If I join the glee club, everything I worked so hard for, it's ruined.<eos> But you want to join.<eos> Of course I do.
I'm s... Are-are you joining us?<eos> You want to win, don't you?<eos> Yes!<eos> Yes!<eos> Yes, we do!
This is wolf country.<eos> Here.<eos> Take this.<eos> That man almost killed us, Ethan.<eos> Well, he didn't.
Well, Mr. Mayor, as the new Sheriff, I really look forward to working with you in the future.<eos> Best of luck on your first day.<eos> This is just for a few days until your dad finishes his case, all right?<eos> Try not to draw too much attention.<eos> I never do.
I invent stories, Fred.<eos> I have to believe in everything in order to make things up.<eos> Do you remember the other day? When you told me you don't remember your parents any more?<eos> No, I don't remember.<eos> Of course you do.
And only she has ever performed them. And only she has recorded them.<eos> And as long as I live, she will be the only one to sing them.<eos> The problem is, dear sir... my wife can't sing any more.<eos> Now do you understand?<eos> Do you?
- They were real shit!<eos> - How dare you?<eos> How dare you?<eos> So you want to be frank?<eos> Do you?
'Cause he couldn't breathe, 'cause I got him in the neck.<eos> Your lungs aren't in your neck, they're in your chest.<eos> I know that, Phoebe.<eos> No, I don't know that.<eos> No, I do.
My father worships the devil?<eos> What would you think?<eos> Good girl.<eos> - Why don't you ask him.<eos> - I did.
No, thanks.<eos> You and Harry ever talk much about Berlin?<eos> The night your father died?<eos> Yeah, he told me what happened.<eos> Did he?
I think what he's saying is that sometimes in life, you know, you just...<eos> You're asked to leave it alone.<eos> But sometimes you can't.<eos> Do you believe that he thinks this is a time that I should leave it alone?<eos> No, I don't.
I am, in fact.<eos> How could you tell?<eos> I don't fuck customers.<eos> Everybody here knows it.<eos> Now you do, too.
My ma left me.<eos> That count?<eos> Well, do you remember her?<eos> I'm not wasting tears missing someone who never missed me.<eos> Maybe she does.
Let's get one thing straight.<eos> I'm not the chosen one, and the prophecy wasn't about me if it was ever real at all.<eos> But I am my mother's son.<eos> And if Blackbeard is going to destroy everything my parents died for, I'll stand against him to the last.<eos> Just like they did.
He)', 9W8. What's going on?<eos> So my dad's MIA right now.<eos> He left a really weird message and disappeared.<eos> - You call the cops?<eos> - My mom did.
There wouldn't be some complicated history that exists between us that we're never going to be able to move past.<eos> No, I get it, I get it.<eos> I do. You deserve that.<eos> You deserve to be happy.<eos> We both do.
Was anybody there for you?<eos> At the chapel?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Did that person help you?<eos> Yeah, he did.
(Whispering) This is ridiculous.<eos> I feel like I'm back in high school.<eos> Doesn't your mom assume that we're sleeping together?<eos> - You're 24.<eos> - (Whispering) Well, she does.
Your lame attempt to go undercover and stalk me more?<eos> We have a lot to catch up on.<eos> I don't know what to say.<eos> It's okay.<eos> No one does.
So you seem good.<eos> I mean, it's been a while since I've seen you, but...<eos> But last time you did, I was crazy.<eos> - I didn't say that.<eos> - Actually, you did.
Dumb thought that... I might never have my own wedding.<eos> April, you...<eos> You can't think like that.<eos> I know.<eos> I don't, really.
- Hi.<eos> Umm, I'm so sorry for not calling or anything.<eos> Brenna told me, but I just...<eos> After the other night, I didn't know what to say.<eos> I still don't.
To win the fight with the dog!<eos> So?<eos> So, It was all about killing<eos> I don't want to kill him!<eos> You don't?
Yeah.<eos> Oh.<eos> You made it sound like he took everything.<eos> - Didn't you think?<eos> - I did, yeah.
And I have never seen this kind of behavior.<eos> I'll tell you, if an actor showed up like this on Kelly Girl...<eos> On what?<eos> Does no one remember my fucking show?<eos> I do.
I didn't know he had one of those either.<eos> None of that is in his file.<eos> His cousin is Fausto Alarcon.<eos> I don't know who that is.<eos> No one does.
- Yeah, a lot.<eos> -Yeah.<eos> You'?<eos> I, uh... Me?<eos> Um, yeah, no, I did.
I'll do it. -Yeah?<eos> - Julie wrote me a fan letter.<eos> -Really?<eos> Really?<eos> Mmm-hmm. I really did.
Oh, my gosh.<eos> So, you have the rest of the day free.<eos> Where would you like to go?<eos> Do you know where the Mall of America is?<eos> - Yes, I do.
And when Travolta got impaled by the thing.<eos> - Yeah. You liked that, huh?<eos> -The worst movie I've ever seen.<eos> - He saved humanity, Betsy.<eos> -No, he did not.
- You've changed. -He made it worse.<eos> What do we do now?<eos> - Do you have a TV?<eos> -Uh-huh.<eos> I do.
Oh, okay, let me just, um, get my stuff.<eos> Here you go.<eos> What?<eos> You didn't think to write down where we parked the car?<eos> No, I didn't, okay?
All right.<eos> - Okay.<eos> -David.<eos> I'm not so sure you wanna be me.<eos> I don't.
What a rip.<eos> Yeah.<eos> You know, she used magic on Cinderella, who wasn't even her real daughter.<eos> Doesn't she love you?<eos> Well, of course she does.
Trust me, we do not.<eos> And now you're gonna be king.<eos> Yeah. - What?<eos> A crown doesn't make you a king.<eos> Well, it kind of does.
- Bedwyr's asthmatic, isn't he?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Does he smoke?<eos> - No.<eos> - Somebody with him does.
Do you know who he is?<eos> Do I know about the thirty thousand dollar reward the confederacy put on the head of major marquis?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Them hillbillies went nigger head hunting, but they never did get 'em the right nigger head, did they?<eos> No they didn't.
- I'm takin' her to the law.<eos> - You're a bounty hunter?<eos> - That's right, Buster.<eos> - Do you have a warrant?<eos> - 'Course I do.
I got my warrant, oswaldo.<eos> - I take it you're Daisy domergue?<eos> - Yeah it's her.<eos> - It says here, dead or alive?<eos> - Yeah it does.
Minnie dosen't smoke a pipe.<eos> She rolls her own.<eos> "Red apple tobacco"<eos> but mi negro amigo, I think you already know this.<eos> Yeah I do, senor Bob.
John Ruth says you gotta' a Lincoln letter?<eos> I tole' you jackass to hee-haw somewhere else.<eos> That's right, John.<eos> - You did say, didn't ya'?<eos> - Yeah I did.
We'll get there.<eos> Let's slow it down.<eos> Let's slow it way down.<eos> Who made the coffy?<eos> He did.
Let's slow it down.<eos> Let's slow it way down.<eos> Who made the coffy?<eos> He did.<eos> - Yeah, he did, didn't he? - Yeah, he did, didn't he?
One of these days gonna be me on one of those yachts<eos> Why those yachts?<eos> The final ordeal before letting you go<eos> The hardest one 15 days of vacation just a couple alone, didn't you read the leaflet?<eos> I did
You'd think so, wouldn't ya?<eos> Well, he was clearly upset by the whole thing.<eos> I think... I hope, anyway, that with a little time and space from the drama of it all, he'll come to his senses.<eos> You really think that's gonna happen?<eos> I do, actually.
Well, you don't have to worry about that.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I know I was being all cranky on Saturday when you went to that fundraiser thingy.<eos> You totally gave me the silent treatment yesterday.<eos> I did not!
You're going to have to talk to one of your siblings about this, 'cause back in my day, math did not look like that.<eos> Hey...<eos> So, I have got good news and I have some less good news.<eos> The good news is, I got my job back.<eos> You did?
You're gonna hang ten on the pond?<eos> Mom, some of us don't want to get skin cancer, right?<eos> Yeah, but there is something called sunscreen, you know.<eos> Did you know that there are nanoparticles in many sunscreens that show up in people's livers?<eos> No, I didn't.
What you guys did was pretty awesome.<eos> Putting Kaitlyn in her place.<eos> Nobody else had the guts to do it.<eos> I should've walked, too.<eos> Well, why don't you?
He's gonna lose it.<eos> He's been working overtime trying to convince her that she can stay clean and do this.<eos> Exactly.<eos> She's probably just gonna change her mind anyway.<eos> Yeah, but what if she doesn't?
I was so insecure, and you saved me, all right?<eos> You rescued me.<eos> Now, I don't know what to do. I...<eos> - You know what to do.<eos> - No, I don't.
As you wish, Mr Stafford.<eos> Miss Pierce.<eos> Hilda.<eos> Of course I knew her.<eos> Everyone did.
My son was a pilot, too.<eos> ~ Fighters?<eos> ~ Yes.<eos> Then you'll know how hard it was for them when it was all over.<eos> I do.
You think, to punish you, I went for a walk in the woods on... On the chance that some British soldiers would be going by?<eos> Christ, Jamie, I went for a walk!<eos> I ordered you to stay put.<eos> I don't have to do what you tell me to.<eos> Aye, you do.
And the man... who first brought the nukes here, the man that murdered my wife and daughter, he came out of that building.<eos> So the question is, who is the man from the building?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Who is the man from the building?<eos> I... I don't...
Oh!<eos> Did I not mention that Frank was there?<eos> No, Tim.<eos> God damn it.<eos> No, you didn't.
You were going to force me out?<eos> Hey, quick, while you still have time, Ted.<eos> Fire this- -Oh god!<eos> It actually works.<eos> He really did that.
I..<eos> I'm scared, father.<eos> Cast thy burden unto the lord and he shall sustain thee.<eos> I have faith in God's strength, believe me.<eos> I do.
Diagonally across the square there is a dark blue sedan between a truck and a small car.<eos> See it?<eos> Okay just I...<eos> Okay yeah.<eos> Yeah, I do.
I saw you in Paris on top of the Notre-Dame Cathedral.<eos> Yes!<eos> -Yes, wow.<eos> You know, the cops had absolutely no idea what to do with you.<eos> They never do.
I'll sit over there<eos> Give me some kachori with onions<eos> You eat onions?<eos> - Yes.<eos> But my family don't
Doesn't matter if you win or lose.<eos> Do it for yourselves<eos> Forcing never achieved anything<eos> He doesn't want to<eos> As if you do
And are you saying this because you don't want to move forward?<eos> Not at all.<eos> I'm sharing with you so you fully understand<eos> - what you're getting into.<eos> - And I do.
Okay, if you want to visit Newton,<eos> I know he'd be happy to see you.<eos> Yeah, okay.<eos> We never finished Carniv? le, so if you want to finish the last two episodes...<eos> - I don't.
I know he'd be happy to see you.<eos> Yeah, okay.<eos> We never finished Carniv? le, so if you want to finish the last two episodes...<eos> - I don't.<eos> No. - You don't.
We never finished Carniv? le, so if you want to finish the last two episodes...<eos> - I don't.<eos> No. - You don't.<eos> Okay.<eos> - I don't.
I know he's got a weird rep, and people think he's sketchy or whatever, but in person, he's actually pretty cool.<eos> Like, this one time we did karaoke.<eos> What?<eos> He was hilarious.<eos> He did Tina Turner, Gladys Knight.
What do you want?<eos> I have some more questions.<eos> I'd like you to come down to the station.<eos> I'm not gonna let you do this to me.<eos> Do what?
Right now, you're gonna take a sip of that drink... and you're gonna go straight to the bedroom.<eos> I don't know what's happening right now.<eos> I feel like if you could just include me...<eos> Do you want me to make you?<eos> - Do I...
All right.<eos> Okay, Frankie, okay.<eos> Why are you so upset right now?<eos> I don't want to go to school.<eos> You don't?
You want some of this or what? - 'Cause I'm not waiting around.<eos> - Depends.<eos> On what?<eos> - You want some of me?<eos> Do you?
- Depends.<eos> On what?<eos> - You want some of me?<eos> Do you?<eos> Yeah, I really do.
She did Miley Cyrus.<eos> She destroyed Wrecking Ball.<eos> It was amazing.<eos> - You still like that song.<eos> - Everybody does.
You like this woman?<eos> Yeah, she's awesome... but there's a whole history here that he's brushing over.<eos> You want her back?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I do.
- How?<eos> The blacksmith left it for me, boss.<eos> When a man escapes, he takes as much food with him as he can.<eos> - He leaves nothing behind.<eos> - But he did, boss.
Company! - To your duties!<eos> - Hello, Katherine.<eos> - Hello, boss.<eos> We did not discuss the nights you would come.<eos> We did, boss.
But would you sacrifice your reputation?<eos> Respect?<eos> Honour?<eos> I would.<eos> I did, boss.
Yes.<eos> Are you looking forward to it?<eos> No.<eos> No-one wants to see a man like that hang.<eos> Quite a few soldiers do.
Because she's very smart and guarded, and her last relationship, it was, uh, it was rough, right, Doc?<eos> Yeah, she does show some signs of, uh, PTSD, it's true.<eos> - And she also... - And that is why we cast her... for the crazy, all right?<eos> Besides, she knew what she was in for.<eos> They all do.
We good?<eos> Okay, you know what? I don't...<eos> I don't...<eos> I don't want to be doing this crap any more than you do.<eos> I don't.
No.<eos> Hey, hey, hey, hey.<eos> Let's, uh, let's -- okay.<eos> Let's, um -- let's get you a drink over here.<eos> I didn't do anything.
Why the hell would he say that?<eos> - Because I'm suing him.<eos> - What are you suing him for?<eos> Because I created this... "Everlasting."<eos> - You did? - Yep.
My girls are moving on up.<eos> Bam!<eos> Really?<eos> Adam said that?<eos> He did.
"Barfing, too"?<eos> No.<eos> I would never.<eos> And how do you know what I eat, anyway?<eos> I-I just do.
I get that.<eos> But Kirk's lawyers are gonna worse.<eos> Every crumb goes under the microscope.<eos> You got to tell them everything. You did, right?<eos> I did.
Is that all you care about?<eos> Getting away with it?<eos> Don't either of you feel guilty?<eos> - Those girls know what they signed on for.<eos> - No, they don't.
Oh, good God, Chet.<eos> You want me begging every time I get a boner?<eos> I'd be mauling you five times a day.<eos> You know who I am.<eos> Yes, I do.
Okay, so I just want to assume that it's gonna be Anna.<eos> Uh, actually, um... Oh?<eos> I just had a candid conversation with Grace, I'm starting to think I might go with the other option.<eos> Yes, well, I called it, I just want to say, day one.<eos> No, you didn't.
Not a problem.<eos> Well, even though he's sleeping with me?<eos> We had sex last night... dirty sex.<eos> He almost left the show for me.<eos> But he didn't.
Grace... you know the powerful connection that we shared.<eos> But I'm sorry, you're just not my wife.<eos> Anna... seeing you here today in my country with my family...<eos> I realize how beautifully you fit in here and how beautifully we fit, and I... only hope that you feel the same way, too.<eos> I do.
Join the Peace Corps if you want, and see how that feels as your life.<eos> You know something?<eos> I just don't want to be a woman whose whole life is this.<eos> You may want to be Chet, but I don't want to be you, Quinn.<eos> Yeah, you do.
Come on, nobody is guessing.<eos> That boy is going for Grace.<eos> - You don't know that for sure.<eos> - Honey...<eos> - No, you don't...
Reminds me of myself at that age.<eos> You're not gonna ruin my little trip down nostalgia lane, are you?<eos> There's nothing nostalgic about you, sergeant.<eos> Do you wanna catch this guy?<eos> - Of course I do.
Writing is a generous term.<eos> Saying bad things about bad people, it doesn't always end well.<eos> Maybe you shouldn't have written them.<eos> Well, I didn't write all of them.<eos> - Then, who did?
uh,neurosyphilis. Getting a lumbar puncture? uh,neurosyphilis.<eos> She certainly does get around,<eos> She certainly does get around, doesn't she? Doesn't she?<eos> yes.<eos> yes. Yes, she does. Yes, she does.
All their texts, photos, posts.<eos> You're rebuilding the night from everything they posted on the Internet.<eos> This is what we do here.<eos> People have no idea the trail of information they expose to the world.<eos> Some of us do.
Why would somebody try to kill her?<eos> Max?<eos> Tell me what really happened last night.<eos> Look, I don't remember.<eos> I don't.
Lindy?<eos> - Yes, Lindy.<eos> - Yeah, sorry.<eos> George and I have some work that we really need to catch up on.<eos> - Do we?
I spent a month in the outback with nothing more than a blanket.<eos> Haven't you heard?<eos> They build us tough in Australia.<eos> You never told me why you moved there.<eos> No, I didn't.
Why? !<eos> Why what?<eos> You killed Ben.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, I did.
I got that.<eos> He told me to meet him here.<eos> Nobody ever really meets J.J.<eos> I talked to him online and he said to come here.<eos> Did he?
We spoke to Jennifer Marino.<eos> I'm sorry?<eos> I don't understand.<eos> I don't know who that is.<eos> Yes, you do.
Oliver Lawless.<eos> - From high school?<eos> - Yes, from high school.<eos> On a national commercial.<eos> He did it.
I really fucked up.<eos> Mom hates me.<eos> I don't think she hates you.<eos> I just think maybe...<eos> She does.
Everything in regards to ballet is such a delicate balance, isn't it?<eos> Nothing has been explicitly stated.<eos> They call them "fuck-me shoes."<eos> - Beg your pardon?<eos> Who does?
So, Jessica tells me that you hail from Pittsburgh.<eos> What part?<eos> Polish Hill.<eos> Do you know it?<eos> No, I... I don't.
What would you like to do?<eos> We could go to that nice bookstore on 16th street.<eos> Where's daddy?<eos> Molly, you know why daddy's not here.<eos> No, I don't. No, I don't.
We could go to that nice bookstore on 16th street.<eos> Where's daddy?<eos> Molly, you know why daddy's not here.<eos> No, I don't. No, I don't.<eos> - No, I don't!
We all have the same swords out there.<eos> We all have the same guns.<eos> But great art... has felled empires and therein lies all the difference.<eos> I don't understand what that means.<eos> No, but I do.
He arrived just before you did.<eos> And he told me what you did.<eos> After he invited you into his home, trusted you to assist his son and daughter, and you flagrantly violated that trust.<eos> Sir, I don't know what he told you, but...<eos> Yes, you do.
- I don't mind.<eos> - What's the problem?<eos> It's not up to you to decide, and you know that.<eos> - Gram, don't you want a victory?<eos> - Of course I do.
I don't understand. What do you mean?<eos> It was an unnecessary waste of lives.<eos> Our government had already capitulated.<eos> Didn't you know that?<eos> No, I did not.
The last thing I need in my house is six giddy women and their deviled eggs.<eos> I'm assuming that's off the record.<eos> The gantry is moving away from the rocket as we anticipate the countdown at any moment now.<eos> - You don't smoke.<eos> - Today I do.
Should we pop by?<eos> Knock, knock.<eos> We couldn't sleep.<eos> We thought we heard music.<eos> - Oh, you did.
- Why?<eos> - Why what?<eos> Well, why were you her next of kin?<eos> Because they thought we were married.<eos> - Who did?
- A guide?<eos> - Yeah, wasn't really a guide.<eos> This swarthy little bastard who thought he was Jack Kerouac.<eos> - You always did hate Kerouac.<eos> - Yes, I did.
My German, it wasn't that great, what with its accent.<eos> They laughed a lot.<eos> He was forever making these jokes I didn't get.<eos> - Oh, God, you wouldn't like that.<eos> - No, I didn't.
And Kerouac was looking down this hole.<eos> A fissure.<eos> Yeah, a fissure, I suppose you'd call it, like a narrow, narrow crack in the rock.<eos> Do you remember that one in Scotland?<eos> - Yeah, I do. - Yeah.
Well, I'm not saying what we did was out of bravery.<eos> I think you were just chasing a girl who wanted to be chased.<eos> You didn't know her.<eos> No.<eos> I didn't.
She's had nothing to do with any of that.<eos> I'd like to be able to tell you everything I'm... thinking, and everything I know, but I can't.<eos> Do you understand that?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yes, I do.
- He's not a killer.<eos> Well, you know, he has... killed.<eos> So technically...<eos> Doesn't make him a killer.<eos> It sort of does.
We're gonna have your food right out.<eos> - Hey, Angela.<eos> - Hi, Fiona.<eos> - You know what you want?<eos> - I do.
I'm actually not supposed to be leaving my bed.<eos> Well, I'm glad you're okay.<eos> I'm glad you're okay.<eos> I never really thought about it before, but... last night made me realize how... at any day, any point... we could just die.<eos> We didn't.
Oh my God.<eos> I just did Molly.<eos> I can't believe it.<eos> You didn't actually swallow it, did you?<eos> I did.
[Exhales] [Laughs] No.<eos> No, no, no, don't do it.<eos> I promise, no more questions.<eos> I swear.<eos> What do you do?
You so fucked that hot guy in the cap, didn't you?<eos> Well, I finally did it in the woods.<eos> Yes!<eos> Agustín made a new friend, too.<eos> Yeah, I did.
You're looking at it, monsieur.<eos> I didn't know Adele was dead.<eos> The last I heard, she'd gone to the Cardinal's country estate. I...<eos> I thought she'd made her choice.<eos> She did, monsieur.
Hello.<eos> Welcome to the family.<eos> Well, it's a bit premature, that, is it?<eos> - You don't have a beer that I could have?<eos> - Yeah, of course I do.
Right?<eos> You don't know everything, do you, Payne?<eos> Did you know that "Enugu" is the African word for "utopia"?<eos> - No.<eos> - No, you did not.
No!<eos> - No, Ron.<eos> No!<eos> No!<eos> I fucking did, you fucking cunt!
You know about payments, right?<eos> You know we cash bearer bonds, yeah?<eos> D'you know we pay off juries to make 'em look fucking favorably upon us, do you?<eos> Yes.<eos> You do.
Anything at all?<eos> Take a punt.<eos> Do you know anything about how we pay off policemen every fucking final Thursday of the month?<eos> - Do you know that?<eos> - Of course I do.
You can still look after him in prison.<eos> And he doesn't belong here and you know it.<eos> Right.<eos> Right, well, you just don't understand.<eos> - Yes, I do.
Right.<eos> Right, well, you just don't understand.<eos> - Yes, I do.<eos> - No, you don't.<eos> Yes, I do.
He works near here.<eos> He should see this.<eos> Whose imagination is running away with them, now?<eos> If it was a bomb, it would tick.<eos> It does.
There's three beeps every 15 seconds.<eos> That's funny.<eos> What's funny?<eos> You did take it for that service?<eos> Yes, of course I did.
But so many lost their lives, you know, and it's easy to see them as just an extension of Joe, but I don't even recognize that name--Sherry.<eos> The more I really think about it, there's only a handful of names that I do remember.<eos> Joe Carroll turned those people into killers.<eos> But their lives, their families should still matter.<eos> And they do.
Taunting the police with... clues and misdirections excited him.<eos> As much as torture and sadism.<eos> He was guilty and you passed the right verdict.<eos> Why didn't you go and see him?<eos> I did.
There was no-one around here to hear you.<eos> I had my door locked in case Armstrong came back.<eos> Armstrong's disappeared.<eos> We split up when we went searching last night, didn't we?<eos> - Yes, we did.
I'm sorry to hear about you and Amy.<eos> Well, I'm sorry about Leonard.<eos> Thought I raised him better than that.<eos> You know, it's bad enough what happened, but then he tried to hide the fact that he sees her all the time at the university.<eos> He does?
You can't put the kids in the car and then work for several hours.<eos> – I know. I'm sorry.<eos> – You don't even work there anymore.<eos> – I fucked up.<eos> – Yes, you did.
None whatsoever.<eos> You were good friends with professor Stoddart?<eos> Well, yes-- good friends.<eos> Do you think their deaths are connected in any way?<eos> No, I don't.
You were good friends with professor Stoddart?<eos> Well, yes-- good friends.<eos> Do you think their deaths are connected in any way?<eos> No, I don't.<eos> You don't?
Frank was at home with Liam?<eos> Yes or no.<eos> DNA doesn't lie, does it?<eos> You're right.<eos> It never does.
Like, 1,200 miles.<eos> Well, there you go.<eos> That's 1,200 miles between you and your love of your life.<eos> Because you love her, right?<eos> Yeah, I do.
I still can't believe she hasn't called.<eos> They probably don't have phones in Agloe.<eos> She has a cell.<eos> How do we know that she's even still in Agloe?<eos> I just do.
And I've never stopped loving you every single day since.<eos> You're not in love with me.<eos> Don't say that.<eos> You don't even know me.<eos> Yeah, I do.
It took me a long time to realize how wrong I was.<eos> And not just about Margo.<eos> I was wrong about a lot of things.<eos> I used to believe everyone gets a miracle.<eos> And I still do.
Will you come with me to Wessex?<eos> No, Earl Ingstad.<eos> Why not?<eos> Don't you want to win renown?<eos> Of course I do.
Our child attempted suicide and you didn't tell me?<eos> I didn't... I didn't even find out till the day after, okay?<eos> And I was little more concerned with Julie than Ricki.<eos> - You should've called and told me.<eos> - I did.
Speaking of Josh and Adam...<eos> I let both the boys know that you came into town.<eos> Oh, g...<eos> - Do they wanna see me?<eos> - Josh does.
I've been headed here, like a freight train.<eos> I couldn't have known then where all this was gonna end up.<eos> I didn't know why he decided to come back.<eos> I didn't know then what he's running from .<eos> None of us did.
Fuck.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> You want me to talk to Dad, I'll talk to Dad.<eos> Of course I will.<eos> Yeah, I do.
They'd cleaned up most of the mess by the time we got there.<eos> No, not the mess.<eos> This... feeling.<eos> I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> Yeah, you do.
Oh, my God!<eos> - Oh, my God...<eos> - Turn off your lights.<eos> - What?<eos> - Just do it!
- Sister Amy.<eos> Are we really that bad?<eos> You remind them of things they left behind, and many of those are painful.<eos> You're doctors, I'm sure you don't want to cause pain.<eos> No, we don't.
Come on, don't be like that.<eos> This doesn't have to be awkward.<eos> It's too late for that.<eos> Seriously, since when have you known?<eos> I don't.
Jail two, here two.<eos> Why am I on naltrexone?<eos> You went through sedated detox.<eos> I never asked for that.<eos> You definitely did not, hence the sedated part.
- ( without accent ) P-E-Y-T-O-N.<eos> Oh, I was spelling it with an A.<eos> ( with accent ) Ah, that always happens when I give my name to people.<eos> We have you down for 2:00 PM tomorrow.<eos> ( without accent ) You do?
We didn't exactly exchange niceties.<eos> He got the jump on me.<eos> Got me on my knees.<eos> Thought he was gonna kill me.<eos> Why didn't he?
What am I ruining?<eos> Can you tell me that?<eos> What did I do wrong?<eos> Nothing.<eos> Because you never did anything.
You are so beautiful.<eos> You live together, work together...<eos> You do everything together.<eos> How come you never fight?<eos> - Sometimes we do.
Outside!<eos> Ooh!<eos> Whee!<eos> I'm gonna go all the way around!<eos> Oh, my God, she did it!
I'm not a leader.<eos> All I ever wanted was to fight for a lord I believed in.<eos> The good lords are dead and the rest are monsters.<eos> You told Lord Royce we were going to the Fingers.<eos> I did.
Camilla. What are you trying to do with the clutch?<eos> I'm trying to get the biting point!<eos> But it's bally elusive when one's reversing out.<eos> ~ Do you need me to drive you there?<eos> ~ No, I don't!
~ and asked to have my tubes tied.<eos> ~ You're under arrest, Mrs Teeman.<eos> You'll be allowed to speak to a solicitor in due course.<eos> ~ I didn't ask for any of this.<eos> ~ And neither did your children.
I've got a nipper meself, nearly 18 months old now.<eos> If you've finished your work here, can we get on with ours?<eos> Of course.<eos> Keep an eye on the kids, though.<eos> We do.
Have you got children, Nurse Crane?<eos> No, Mrs Roland, I am a spinster.<eos> How dare you even come into my house.<eos> ~ I wanted to speak to you, Mrs Roland.<eos> ~ Oh, you do, do you?
She wants to give birth in her own home, which is here!<eos> No evictions, and no transfers to hospital are going to take place until I give my permission.<eos> Do you understand?<eos> Yes, Sister.<eos> I do.
You should be wherever you want, wherever you need to be, whether it's here or Newcastle or... even the moon.<eos> That's just it.<eos> You deserve a girl who won't let you go without her.<eos> I rather thought I'd found her.<eos> Yes, well... .. so did I, for a while.
~ I left you in a terrible position.<eos> ~ No, you didn't.<eos> You were ill.<eos> ~ You may not understand that, but...<eos> ~ I do.
Those of us who volunteered to move out and find private digs will be given a rent allowance.<eos> And I've put my name down.<eos> Oh, Delia, you don't want to end up in some filthy hole,<eos> ~ living cheek by jowl with a lot of students.<eos> ~ No, I don't.
I don't care if I have to share you with Bert, or the memory of him.<eos> Violet... .. I wish we were a pair.<eos> I wish you'd marry me.<eos> Well, why don't you ask me, then?<eos> I just did.
The boiler has died from inattention.<eos> I may yet suffer the same fate.<eos> PATSY: Oh, Delia. You don't want to end up in some... filthy hole, living cheek by jowl with a lot of students.<eos> FRED: Did you get the letter about my lady friend?<eos> Yes, Dad, I did.
What's the relative velocity?<eos> 12 meters per second.<eos> Copy.<eos> Hook me up.<eos> Done.
TIM:<eos> I've been looking at it.<eos> Toxoplasmosis, isn't it?<eos> - Yes, it is.<eos> - I did a theatre thing once.
- You tell me.<eos> - I got to wake up.<eos> Do you want a coke or a coffee?<eos> - Well, you got a cold beer?<eos> - I do.
Want to hang back, let KSP do their thing?<eos> Yeah. Why not?<eos> How you doing there?<eos> Do you mind stepping' out of your vehicle?<eos> - I do.
- He was delighted.<eos> He had no sense of your intention.<eos> He never saw it coming... because he believed me... because I acted like everything was the way it always was.<eos> Because he had never suspected otherwise.<eos> No, he did not.
You're gonna want to move that hand.<eos> - How's that?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Does that feel good?<eos> - Sure does.
Different strokes.<eos> That's a great pie.<eos> They bake it here?<eos> I should know the answer to that.<eos> I don't.
I mean, i hear it's coming back in style, anyways.<eos> No, i mean, insane thinking i can get away with this.<eos> Do i really want to trade My dignity, wisdom, and self-respect For another chance at my 20s?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, you do.
They respond to the whole picture, even if they don't know why.<eos> I'm telling you, men are gonna love that purse without even realizing they saw it.<eos> Let me ask you a question.<eos> Do you think I should change my profile photo?<eos> Maybe do one with the Leiber?
Well, that certainly worked.<eos> Kelsey Peters.<eos> I'm an editor at Empirical.<eos> Sorry, I don't speak Swedish.<eos> - You don't? - No.
I won't be needing it anymore.<eos> I got dropped.<eos> I'm never gonna find another gallery at this age.<eos> I completely understand what you're going through.<eos> No, you don't...
I can't see out my window.<eos> That's right.<eos> You broke the bed.<eos> I...<eos> I did...
I want this party to be epic.<eos> I want hot men and live peacocks and young people that no one would ever think to invite to something like this, because they're under the radar and much too interesting to bother.<eos> They're on the cusp.<eos> Do you know what I'm saying, Liza?<eos> Um, yes, yes, I do.
Did you see?<eos> Finally fixed the bimini top. I can't take the title, David.<eos> Sure you can.<eos> And you can use the boat whenever you want.<eos> They still do fireworks out here on the Fourth.
Well, i suppose some of the--<eos> Those little groupies? They're disgusting.<eos> And you know the women i'm talking about, yes?<eos> Yes, yes, yes.<eos> Yes, i do.
Hi.<eos> Hey.<eos> I wanted to tell you so many times.<eos> You have no idea.<eos> So why didn't you?
Yeah, I am fine.<eos> - Did you get the marmalade?<eos> - Yes, yes. Yes.<eos> Yes.<eos> I did.
I think some guy fucked a monkey.<eos> Jesus Christ!<eos> Why didn't you warn me about that, Mike?<eos> Ma'am, I tried to, right when you came in.<eos> No, you didn't.
But who's going to do that?<eos> - I believe I have the skills, ma'am.<eos> - There you go.<eos> Fine.<eos> You do it, Kent.
You got to get on that.<eos> Listen, please, please, please.<eos> If anybody doesn't know the difference between a valance and a jabot, I really need you to leave.<eos> - Did the president's stylist get my notes?<eos> - Yes, he did.
- You're out of line, missy.<eos> - Geldray.<eos> - What are you wearing tomorrow?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> I do.
- Yeah.<eos> Can you find somebody else who did what I did?<eos> - You mean on Labor Day?<eos> - I didn't say that.<eos> Yeah, you did.

Man: Do you solemnly swear that the testimony you're about to give is the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?<eos> - I do.<eos> - Yes, I do.<eos> Absolutely.<eos> Yes, sir, I do.
I preferred that.<eos> That's a good nickname.<eos> Fractious cracks have opened up in your relationships and in your testimony and we'll explore them in a later session.<eos> Do you solemnly swear that the testimony you're about to give is the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?<eos> I do.

Thank you.<eos> I don't know why you let me order a burrito the size of a baby.<eos> Well, look at you in your place of power.<eos> So you managed to get off after all.<eos> Of course I did.
Yes, you know what?<eos> Yes.<eos> - I would like one, actually.<eos> - There you go.<eos> - I do...

And I was hoping I could call her Cunty while I'm here.<eos> Okay, that one's easy.<eos> No, you cannot.<eos> 'Cause, you know, I want to have Cunty come visit me for lunch, and if I can't call Cunty "Cunty," then it's like, I'm not going to want to have Cunty over at all, which I feel like kind of violates my rights--<eos> Yeah, um, it does not-- as a woman.
Thank you for allowing me to come in here today and be vulnerable and to apologize.<eos> Mr. Bachman,<eos> I didn't have you come all the way back here today just to apologize to me.<eos> Uh, please, it's Erlich.<eos> And... you didn't?
People are lunatics about smoking here.<eos> We don't enjoy all the freedoms that you have in China.<eos> All right? Where people smoke all the time.<eos> I don't smoke. Except for special occasions.<eos> So, you do smoke?
- Okay, but I...<eos> This exchange is now over, thank you.<eos> JARED: Well, Richard? Firstly, congratulations on finally being funded.<eos> I hope you took a little time out to enjoy this moment and celebrate.<eos> I certainly did.
I am so happy that my uncle is dead.<eos> But I still don't believe it.<eos> You saw him killed.<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes I did.
Only a dream.<eos> _<eos> Halt!<eos> You know of Lord Burgred.<eos> Of course you do.
There's no more pain.<eos> Go to sleep.<eos> Who are you?<eos> - You know who I am.<eos> - No, I don't.
- Go away, Bjorn!<eos> - No!<eos> I don't want this child.<eos> I don't want this child! I don't want this child!<eos> I do.
I love my wife, Torvi.<eos> Floki.<eos> Priest.<eos> Lord, receive my soul.<eos> The things I do for you.
The things I do for you.<eos> For such a little man, Athelstan, you are terribly heavy.<eos> This is as close to your God as I can get you.<eos> I never knew what a martyr was.<eos> I still don't.
As if the gods are protecting me.<eos> Go.<eos> You're alive, aren't you?<eos> Today went badly.<eos> Yes, it did.
- What?<eos> - She hates my voices.<eos> What's not to hate?<eos> Aw, I think they're fun. - You do?<eos> - You don't. I do.
You have a legal problem.<eos> Bloody hell.<eos> He wants to run the show with you.<eos> I thought you were gonna make this go away?<eos> So did I.
Good, you'll need that.<eos> So... She kills them...<eos> - By poisoning them.<eos> - I see.<eos> - She does it slowly, little by little,
You shot him in the fucking heart.<eos> I think<eos> I wanna go.<eos> That's fine.<eos> I do the work.
Kill her!<eos> Yeah!<eos> Kill her!<eos> Is this what you want?<eos> Do it!
Yeah!<eos> Kill her!<eos> Is this what you want?<eos> Do it!<eos> Do it!
Yeah, you're probably right.<eos> He'll probably just shoot us.<eos> Franklin!<eos> You add to that the fact that we just about killed his little kid, you think this guy's gonna let us live?<eos> Yeah. Yeah, I-I do.
Tonight, you're a guest.<eos> Daniel?<eos> My, but you've grown into a fine young man.<eos> You know why you're here?<eos> ~ I do.
~ Dwayne has stepped up to the plate, as it were.<eos> ~ I'm sure he has, but Elias Thomson was a prominent member of the town council.<eos> This investigation should have a full team assigned to it.<eos> Do you have anyone in mind, sir?<eos> Yes, I do.
Yeah, it's pretty amazing.<eos> I got it for $150, but the mint condition one goes for $300...<eos> Didn't occur to you maybe that's in poor taste?<eos> The shirt?<eos> Yeah, no, it did.
Then it would be...<eos> Both.<eos> Ah, well, that would work.<eos> Do you even know what you're doing?<eos> Of course I do.
-That's pretty awesome, man.<eos> Tim, you want a peanut butter and boysenberry sandwich?<eos> Well, what do we...<eos> Let's go down there and let's dig this shit up.<eos> I did.
Wait, I haven't seen this in so long, I eat here all the time.<eos> What are you gonna get?<eos> - I was thinking about... - uh...<eos> -Do you guys have burgers?<eos> -Yeah, we do.
Winespill!<eos> Yes, sir!<eos> HENS CLUCK<eos> Do you, by any chance, know when Lord Wellington will come back?<eos> I do not.
It's all for librarians.<eos> Hey, something's wrong.<eos> Come on.<eos> You heard me.<eos> Well, I did.
Hoping is bullshit.<eos> You see, you have to act.<eos> You can't believe it was moral, what you did.<eos> - You don't think that it was moral?<eos> - Of course I do.
- Not too well.<eos> I think he just needs time.<eos> - Totally understand.<eos> - I hope this doesn't inconvenience your business too much.<eos> - No, it does not.
I don't want to spend my life dealing in conveyances, Liz.<eos> Whether this man's fence should be here or here...<eos> You know what you're doing, I suppose.<eos> At least, you always look as if you do.<eos> Yeah, I do, don't I?
I should have sent them to the country.<eos> Liz wouldn't have let them go.<eos> Anne cried every time you were away.<eos> Did she?<eos> Anne did?
"Last night I was in Spain!"<eos> The Queen was Spanish, you see?<eos> It would be a poor sort of bridegroom who'd come out in the morning and say,<eos> "Good day, masters.<eos> Nothing done!"
We don't have to sacrifice anything more.<eos> We got each other, we got our future.<eos> A normal future, okay?<eos> And I do not want to risk losing that ever again.<eos> Neither do I.
You almost act like you, uh, miss fighting beasts sometimes.<eos> That's ridiculous.<eos> Oh?<eos> Okay.<eos> Maybe I do.
And Vincent and I, we only agreed to think about it.<eos> People are dying, Detective, innocent people, all over the city.<eos> And someone or something's responsible for it.<eos> And you want to think about it?<eos> Yes, I do.
Who's math girl?<eos> That would be me...<eos> The one who could break at any second, the one who betrays her friends.<eos> You would never betray anybody.<eos> Except I did...
Boom!<eos> A fine, little house in the middle of nowhere.<eos> My family never knew how special it was.<eos> Not one of them heard this house whispering.<eos> But I did.
I hope you're kidding.<eos> I'm just extra careful.<eos> I'm doing it.<eos> My job is to pay attention.<eos> Do more attention.
You okay?<eos> Yeah, I'll be fine.<eos> I'm staying with you.<eos> - You really don't have to.<eos> - Yeah, I do.
It's not working for me.<eos> I'm not supposed to be someone's mistress.<eos> Nobody thinks of you as a mistress, Marn.<eos> But because nobody thinks about me at all, like, in relation to you.<eos> I do.
It's, uh...<eos> I don't have time for this.<eos> I don't need any more friends.<eos> Oh, so none is enough for you?<eos> Adam, I do.
I just thought you deserved to know the truth.<eos> What is this?<eos> It's Soren's bear.<eos> You said he took it with him.<eos> He did.
Better than that.<eos> You almost look as healthy as you did when you landed.<eos> You mean right before you clubbed me?<eos> - I already apologized for that.<eos> - No you didn't.
She collapsed.<eos> I did everything I could.<eos> I tried to help her.<eos> - I tried.<eos> - Of course you did.
We trusted him.<eos> But when Agnes saw Dr. Jordan's eyes, she knew.<eos> We were such fools!<eos> You had no reason not to believe him.<eos> But now, I do.
He eats the eyes all to himself.<eos> We will definitely be sharing yours.<eos> Blue is my favorite color, tastes great with honey.<eos> You eat the honey?<eos> Course we do.
She knows better.<eos> She said she wanted 'em all to herself.<eos> - What are you talking about?<eos> She wanted to take my eyes, but I wouldn't let her!<eos> - She did what?
Have you even considered the implications of worldwide sterilization?<eos> Infertility is a way to temporarily depopulate,<eos> - just until resources are replenished.<eos> - You think you know better, but you don't have the right to make that choice.<eos> No one does.
Show them they have no power.<eos> All right?<eos> Walk away.<eos> How do I know they won't follow me?<eos> You don't.
Where are you going?<eos> Home.<eos> Come on, Julia, where are you?<eos> Before I show you something... do you know the way to San Jose?<eos> Yes, I do.
Let's put our hearts into this.<eos> And if we all must die, so be it.<eos> Well, yes...<eos> The thing is, I don't want to die yet, Pablo.<eos> Nor do I.
The problem, Pablo, is that... now that you have admitted to trafficking in narcotics, my image as a journalist cannot be associated with yours.<eos> So then... now you think I am going to damage your credibility as a journalist... is that it?<eos> You understand what I'm saying.<eos> Oh, yeah, sure.<eos> Of course I do.
This is good.<eos> Gaviria wants to negotiate with us.<eos> This is very good.<eos> General, I don't believe you understand your orders clearly.<eos> - But I do.
- Okay.<eos> - I'm being done to, all right? - Mm-hmm.<eos> Junior. Junior.<eos> You see what's going on here?<eos> I do.
Please tell me you are not gonna buy me another fake purse.<eos> I've never bought you a fake purse.<eos> - Dre. - Hmm?<eos> You know that "Chanel" has one "N," right?<eos> - I do now. - Mm-hmm.
But I should.<eos> I really should.<eos> You're the most beautiful man I ever met, but...<eos> I just don't want this.<eos> I don't.
Well, it's only gonna get harder, but no.<eos> No, it's not your last chance.<eos> Well, listen to me.<eos> I don't know how to be a mom.<eos> Anouk, nobody does.
It's just...<eos> I was awful.<eos> You were, but I was worse.<eos> I was saying you didn't know anything about...<eos> I don't.
I could use a précis.<eos> - "Précis"...?<eos> - It means 'recap'.<eos> I know what it means.<eos> Since when does Sam?
- I know what you're capable of.<eos> - What's wrong with you?<eos> - What's wrong with me?<eos> - As if you don't know.<eos> - Er, I don't. (Laughs)
Why are you wearing that stupid hat?<eos> 'Cause it looks good.<eos> Everything we told you about magic and what we can do...<eos> - Are you gonna tell people?<eos> - Because if you do...
I'm not getting anything.<eos> You wouldn't do anything stupid, would you?<eos> Based on recent experience?<eos> I know how badly you want to get Andy back.<eos> We all do.
No, I'm with another candidate, she's in the restroom.<eos> She might adopt him. She phoned this morning, you were snoring.<eos> It's good to have more options.<eos> Since the Russian doesn't want him.<eos> - He doesn't?
Hello, Bobby.<eos> Weren't expecting me, were you?<eos> HOW'd you get in here?<eos> Your mother let me in.<eos> No, she didn't.
- That's our thing.<eos> - They're doing a bit.<eos> - Sorry, that was just a joke. Do you guys want to do something a little fun?<eos> - Oh, yeah.<eos> - I do, I do.
How long have you had that?<eos> - Nine... 90...<eos> - 90...? !<eos> - How do you get on the Internet?<eos> - I don't.
Well, I just--<eos> You make these decisions and then come to us afterwards.<eos> - It'd be nice if you asked us first.<eos> - Mom wanted him home.<eos> - Dad didn't.
I'm really happy you're here.<eos> I truly am.<eos> I'm so--<eos> - I think it's so good for Mom and Dad.<eos> - Oh, you do?
I just hope you got mine.<eos> Hey, I wanna tell you something.<eos> You don't have to marry Marco.<eos> - I know that.<eos> - No, you don't.
I tried to tell her, but she wouldn't listen to me.<eos> Still, I can't blame her for what she did.<eos> Whatever mistakes she made... her heart was in the right place.<eos> And in the end, she's my sister.<eos> What did you do?
You just shouldn't have to uproot your whole life for the last year and a half of high school because of this.<eos> I'm asking my mom if you can move in.<eos> Thank you...<eos> For caring so much.<eos> Oh, I don't.
I know how to bring the heat.<eos> Yeah, I know I gotta tell them.<eos> I gotta tell them.<eos> I just--<eos> - Yeah, you do.
Dad!<eos> - John.<eos> You wanna talk?<eos> Danny told me he asked to come home.<eos> He did?
I-I-I don't know.<eos> I mean, I-I --<eos> Answer the question.<eos> Who gave this to you, sir?<eos> I don't -
No, that's okay.<eos> I'm fine.<eos> You don't believe in the afterlife at all, do you?<eos> No.<eos> I do.
I don't think these guys have much compassion.<eos> Well, I wouldn't say that.<eos> It's a question of who they have compassion for.<eos> These guys killed Vega.<eos> Sellers did, not Ace.
You know, through the paperwork.<eos> And the poker game?<eos> Isn't that a conflict of interest?<eos> I mean, I never discussed the case with him.<eos> But someone did?
No, they don't.<eos> Jimmy's right -- I left.<eos> After my mom died, I was the parent, and I left.<eos> Well, you felt trapped.<eos> Of course you did.
Good.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I would have mailed you your cup, but I didn't know where you were.<eos> Well, you knew I'd be back.<eos> No, I didn't.
We see it everywhere.<eos> Red clay -- a little rarer.<eos> But, uh, not much.<eos> I didn't want to be right.<eos> Of course you did.
Because there is an immovable stain on it, right?<eos> Like red wine or something.<eos> But why do you change the floorboards underneath?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I do.
Are you trying to persuade me, governor, Or are you rehearsing for a judge?<eos> Look, if your sheriff Is anywhere near those interviews, All the interview evidence will be deemed inadmissible.<eos> You're a lawyer; you should know that.<eos> You want to conduct the interviews.<eos> Yes, I do.
I was 17...<eos> And he was so sweet to me. He completely convinced me to marry him and have the baby.<eos> My mum didn't approve. So didn't...<eos> You said you'd... Airlift Liam if he didn't get any better.<eos> Yes, I did.
As were the fingerprints of your lover.<eos> Yes.<eos> But nobody knows which one of you killed Ricardo Scelsi.<eos> Nobody.<eos> You do.
Elena?<eos> Elena?<eos> Elena, are you okay?<eos> Can I come in, please?<eos> Who did this to you?
There's a moment, a moment you realize you are no longer the hunter, you are the prey.<eos> If you have been touched by the demon, it's like being touched by the back hand of God.<eos> Makes you sacred in a way.<eos> There are things within us all that can never be unleashed.<eos> What do those people do?
Be firm with her.<eos> She is wilful.<eos> Like all children.<eos> I hope you know what you've bought.<eos> I do.
When there were thunderstorms, you came to my bed.<eos> We never slept.<eos> We clung together until the storms passed.<eos> Did I admire fair-haired ladies?<eos> I did.
You want to poison your baby brother, I can give you that, and laugh while I do it!<eos> But if you think you are touched by the demon then you best walk out that door.<eos> Because what I can give you for that is only knowledge you don't want, little girl!<eos> Who branded you?<eos> Who did that to you?
My name is Dorian Gray.<eos> Angelique.<eos> This is where I work.<eos> I hope you know what you've bought.<eos> I do.
Is it the story of Lucifer, then?<eos> The angel cast out by God?<eos> Time will tell.<eos> How could this one monk know all these languages?<eos> - He didn't.
The angel cast out by God?<eos> Time will tell.<eos> How could this one monk know all these languages?<eos> - He didn't.<eos> The demon did.
This is but one evening.<eos> Mr. Gray is being a proper host to a new guest, that's all.<eos> You're smarter than that, Miss Ives.<eos> I wanted her to have life.<eos> Now she does.
I hope you can live with it, because I sure as hell can't.<eos> And don't worry.<eos> I see you for exactly what you are.<eos> LILY: Don't you want me to have friends?<eos> Of course I do.
Nothing but a mirror.<eos> What things you must do here.<eos> So much empty space to fill up with your... adventures.<eos> But you like adventures.<eos> Who doesn't?
End the torment, Vanessa.<eos> Kiss me.<eos> You offer me a normal life. Why do you think I want that anymore?<eos> I know what I am.<eos> Do you?
And tomorrow?<eos> I promise you, we will be less afraid.<eos> I need to think.<eos> Forgive me.<eos> I do.
I have lost the immortal part of myself, you see.<eos> No, I've thrown it away.<eos> No matter how far you have walked from God he is still waiting ahead.<eos> You don't believe in God.<eos> But you do.
Slowly.<eos> I...<eos> Take a step back.<eos> Keep-keep your hands where I can see 'em.<eos> I did it.
You can't be in here.<eos> Everyone's going to think I'm looking for a job.<eos> You mind?<eos> They should always think you're unhappy. You're wrong.<eos> And for the first time, they don't.
Nobody's lives are perfect.<eos> You have kids because you and Andy are a team and you want to bring in some new team members.<eos> So you think we should?<eos> I don't know if you should have kids.<eos> I really don't.
You just got to move on.<eos> That's the problem, though.<eos> I've gone bust in the past, but it was because I did something reckless.<eos> This time I was smart and careful, and I still went broke.<eos> What do I do now?
Character references, plus a reference of the applicant's bank.<eos> And we should interview them, if they're outsiders, ~ make sure they're Pagford people. ~ For an allotment?<eos> Remember the tomato blight dispute of '97?<eos> ~ Do you remember that?<eos> ~ Yes, I do.
Oi, look, it's the deputy head.<eos> Oh, God! Look! Look at them.<eos> ~ Ignore them, Colin.<eos> ~ I've got no authority left.<eos> You do, natural authority.
"Leslie Knope is an absurd idealist "whose political leanings are slightly to the left of Leon Trotsky."<eos> So far, so accurate.<eos> "If we were to work together, "she would undoubtedly drive me insane, and it is possible that we would murder each other."<eos> You forgot the last sentence.<eos> No, I didn't.
Listen, if you can't train 200 white doves in the next four hours to spell out<eos> "Lucy, will you marry me?" then you have no business calling yourself a pet store.<eos> Why can't everyone share our commitment to the basic concept of outrageous pageantry?<eos> I don't know, Tom.<eos> I really don't.

Thanks.<eos> I don't think I'm ready to discuss it just yet.<eos> But what I would like to do is have a glass of wine and talk about that shade Nicki Minaj threw at Jesse Eisenberg at the BAFTA awards.<eos> - Mm. He deserved it.<eos> - No. he didn't!
It's a stupid question.<eos> Stop asking it.<eos> Don't ask it.<eos> Do you miss your kids while you're at work?<eos> Yes, of course I do.
I'm running.<eos> How could she do this to--<eos> Oh, God, I'm remembering things.<eos> We called Jen last night, didn't we?<eos> - Yeah, we did. - Ugh.
I added a personal testimony vouching for April's brilliance.<eos> And this guy better appreciate it because I do not compare people to Mary J. Blige lightly.<eos> Uh, no one should.<eos> Do you want to go to dinner tonight?<eos> - I do not.
After all, it's what wolves do.<eos> Gah!<eos> Uh!<eos> You don't know a damn thing about being a wolf.<eos> No. I don't.
No, Hannah, I love you.<eos> I want you to be happy.<eos> Which is why I think you need to let Adam go.<eos> No, I don't.<eos> Yeah, you do.
If we get in, we can use what's inside to bargain our way out.<eos> But Mona said we won't make it to the vault before the power comes on.<eos> Okay, if I'm right, this is as far as we need to go.<eos> I counted the steps to the vault from the prom room.<eos> - Of course you did.
You wanna carry that grudge, be my guest, but I don't see how them scrawny chicken legs can stand the extra weight.<eos> My legs ain't scrawny... they're proportional.<eos> Hey, hey. - Nicky will be okay.<eos> - How do you know?<eos> I don't.
- Ay, I love a wedding party.<eos> - Hey, me, too.<eos> Yeah, what makes you think she wants you there?<eos> What do you mean?<eos> Of course she does.
Plus, she's already done, what, two years?<eos> Yo, it's all good.<eos> It's all good.<eos> I actually thought he loved me.<eos> And he probably did, Daya.
Why does Sunflower have to be so mean?<eos> Oh, 'cause she's the one you love to hate.<eos> You should have her time hump with Lily Sprinkle.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Do it for the lesbians.
Yeah.<eos> I'm sorry, it's, like, um...<eos> just, like, you in a... in a bonnet!<eos> Did you hear this?<eos> Did you...
Genes are genes and they do not take away from my God-given right to look in the mirror and feel shitty about my thighs.<eos> You're tall and blond, and your legs are up to your neck.<eos> Relax, enjoy it.<eos> I double majored in communications and comparative literature.<eos> Of course you did.
Beware of overeating.<eos> Well, this is disappointing.<eos> You've got the poulet a' la creme.<eos> I didn't know what that was.<eos> And I still don't.
You don't know him like I do.<eos> I think I know him well enough... - Merci. - ...to say that he's not gonna murder us in our hotel room.<eos> Want to bet?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I do.
I... I was saving this for my vision board.<eos> But all vision, no action kills Hamlet, right?<eos> I guess.<eos> I don't really know.<eos> It did.
So, love is the lie we tell ourselves so we don't go extinct?<eos> That's pretty bleak, Red, even for you.<eos> Oh, and you caught me on a glass-half-full day.<eos> So, you don't think there's someone out there you're meant to be with?<eos> Of course I do.
Yeah.<eos> I call her "Ang" 'cause she reminds me of Angelina Jolie.<eos> Don't you think?<eos> - I don't see it.<eos> - I do.
You need to get money into their commissaries.<eos> And pay your girls a fair wage, huh?<eos> You know what Green Dot MoneyPak cards are?<eos> - No.<eos> - No, of course you don't.
- Whoo-hoo!<eos> And now, we takin' back a little thing called... reparations.<eos> You sure you want to get into the ring with me?<eos> - Oh, okay!<eos> - What if she do?
Well, sure.<eos> You should know.<eos> I mean... you do know what a vagina smells like.<eos> Right, sweetie?<eos> Obviously, I do.
You think so?<eos> I mean, I-l hoped you'd think so.<eos> I just wasn't sure.<eos> I do.<eos> I re-- really do.
You must stay here.<eos> Take Saul then.<eos> She knows him.<eos> I don't know her.<eos> Of course you do.
And then when I told him what I'd done that I was gonna tell the truth about him one way or the other...<eos> That's how foul you are, you disgusting slut.<eos> And that's when I knew he was sleeping with her, that he'd... he'd probably hurt her, too.<eos> So, you're saying that you didn't recognize this photo when it became public.<eos> I did not.
Remove the body.<eos> He cannot stay here.<eos> Heads, we go back for the body.<eos> Your DNA is under his nails, on his skin, so the only way to get rid of it is to burn the body. We go back for the body and then what?<eos> We do what with it?
A Christmas card for Rudy.<eos> Why wouldn't his relatives know he doesn't live here anymore?<eos> Why are you obsessing about Rudy?<eos> You said you didn't know him.<eos> Because I didn't.
"He winced in pain from his surgery, but I kept going."<eos> Chad initiated the sex.<eos> Continuing to lie to me only hurts your case.<eos> Have you seen me? In what world would anyone believe Chad would even look at me?<eos> But he did.
I mean, you...<eos> You only talk to us in code.<eos> You expect us to continue going to class and work your cases, even though nothing makes any sense anymore.<eos> I want to trust you.<eos> I do, but...
- All right, guys.<eos> Be well.<eos> That's a second body.<eos> But we don't know if they were on the same boat.<eos> - Sure we do.
I want you to leave and not come back.<eos> It's never worked out with you being here, has it?<eos> - But why do you think that is? - I don't know.<eos> I don't know exactly.<eos> Yeah, you do.
Thanks.<eos> Oh, jeez.<eos> - Did you put gas in the car?<eos> - Here we go.<eos> - No, I did not.
He doesn't count.<eos> - Fuck it.<eos> I don't care.<eos> I honestly-- I don't give a shit who knows.<eos> I don't.
It would've killed him.<eos> Hey, I danced with you one time.<eos> No!<eos> - I don't think so.<eos> - No, no. We did.
I knew this was a fucking bad idea.<eos> - Mmm. - Money always fucks things up.<eos> - Does it really?<eos> You know what?<eos> - Yeah, it does, always.
- Good.<eos> We want the same thing.<eos> - Exactly.<eos> And you asked me if Jon knew about all the... the little things.<eos> Well, he didn't.
And if it works out, then you have to be the first person at that window on opening day.<eos> But you need to start thinking about someone else first instead of me.<eos> He's a great fucking guy.<eos> And I really liked seeing you come out of his door with a big wreath on it.<eos> I kind of did too.
He's always loved them more than me.<eos> Even Jamal, who he hates.<eos> You know he's gonna leave it all to Hakeem, don't you?<eos> And Jamal won't object, because he's too passive.<eos> But what if he did?
You were about to rip open his skull.<eos> He was killed in a DUI accident, wound up here.<eos> I ate his brain.<eos> Until the vision, I thought I was the only one.<eos> Yeah, until, like, three seconds ago, so did I.
- * Don't shine *<eos> - I mean, everything you're giving up.<eos> None of it made me feel the way you do.<eos> - * It's just the light from a star *<eos> - Or did.
- U.2.T.C.!<eos> Coke, this is taking care of you, okay.<eos> Didn't you get us a place?<eos> No.<eos> No, I didn't.
Right, like you've been doing in my house with my daughter!<eos> - With my son!<eos> - Listen.<eos> - I know...<eos> - No, you don't!
- With my son!<eos> - Listen.<eos> - I know...<eos> - No, you don't!<eos> No, you don't!
Unclear at this time.<eos> There's a shoe in that tree.<eos> There sure is.<eos> So, uh, this a local matter or do the State Police want it?<eos> - We do not. - [ Chuckles ]
You can hang out with your friends everywhere else.<eos> Why are you really here?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Hannah, you came.<eos> I did, Mimi-Rose.
Then I'm going inside and I'm gonna slowly gut your boss and his "Little House on the Prairie" niece.<eos> I don't think so.<eos> Nola.<eos> - Let me die.<eos> - You already did.
The only way to overcome a physical advantage - is to establish a psychological one. - A psychological one.<eos> There you go.<eos> You remember.<eos> Yeah, I slept through that class at Quantico.<eos> No, you didn't.
Clear.<eos> Okay, sats are rising.<eos> Come on, take it to the rack, baby.<eos> All right.<eos> You did it, Scott.
Sure. And Alex was just talking this morning about wanting to make new friends.<eos> Get out of here.<eos> Great. Well, why don't you come over at like 5:00, 5:30?<eos> We're at 1983, Cameron Court.<eos> - Done.
You know, I very much respect the mom job because I've been home with RJ and... Really?<eos> Yeah. I meant it as a compliment to all the moms out there. Yes, yes.<eos> It's beautiful that you're making those sacrifices so that Emily can pursue her career.<eos> - Thanks. But you need to find ways to nurture your soul at the same time.<eos> And how do you do that, babe?
Are they supposed to be close-ups of assholes or what?<eos> That's so funny.<eos> Both you and your husband got that immediately.<eos> I feel like I need to clear some things up for you.<eos> Yes. Please do.
- Come on, Alfie.<eos> Pick 'em up. - No, it'll bite my 'and off.<eos> - Don't be so lily-livered.<eos> - Oh, bugger off.<eos> Just do it. One of you.
- Hey, sweetie? - Yeah?<eos> I think we should, uh, maybe not tell anyone about our little secret yet.<eos> Oh, baby, don't worry about it.<eos> I am a very private person. You know that.<eos> I do.
That's what they eat in the capital, don't they?<eos> Don't they?<eos> Don't who?<eos> People eat pigeon pie in the capital.<eos> They certainly do, my dear.
Don't they?<eos> Don't who?<eos> People eat pigeon pie in the capital.<eos> They certainly do, my dear.<eos> They certainly do.
The last horse show you rode was to help Windstorm.<eos> Don't you think he'd do the same for you?<eos> If you'd at least come along.<eos> You don't need me anymore.<eos> Just do it your way.
Anywhere there's horses.<eos> It must seem odd to a sheltered girl like you...<eos> Who knows where she belongs.<eos> I never knew where I belong.<eos> I do, now, but... At our farm...
It is very weak.<eos> Do you think it will get better?<eos> At the moment I do not think so.<eos> At first he said he did not want to study medicine.<eos> Well, I did but I did not.
- Pornography?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> You like it?<eos> - No.<eos> - I do.
Time was a source of terror.<eos> But in here, every moment spent free of that man is a gift.<eos> But... why are you here?<eos> Because I put rat poison in his bibimbap and killed the motherfucker.<eos> She did her husband, too.
Thought you were going to that party over there.<eos> Oh, I was never going to go 'cause of Eric's ankle, thank god.<eos> Why the hell did you tell me to go, then?<eos> I said try.<eos> You did.
Sasha, honey, what's your favorite meal?<eos> I'd love to cook it for you sometime.<eos> I'm doing it for all the new arrivals.<eos> - I don't know.<eos> - Of course you do.
- I got this aisle.<eos> Shh.<eos> They're stuck behind something.<eos> How do you know?<eos> I don't.
We've lost things.<eos> Other things we're just fighting like hell to hold on to.<eos> Everything you people have been through,<eos> I don't know if you see that.<eos> We do.
After these are done, that's it.<eos> I'm not helping you again and you're not coming back. - You got it?<eos> - Uh-huh.<eos> I hope you're not expecting to leave with more than half of these.<eos> You barely did half the work.
Or what?<eos> You gonna kick me out?<eos> Put that gun down, Rick.<eos> You still don't get it.<eos> None of you do!
Does anybody find it strange that Celia and Alice were never in the same room at the same time?<eos> And do any of you find it as interesting as I do that Celia is an anagram of Alice?<eos> [Scoffs] That doesn't prove anything.<eos> No, it doesn't.<eos> But this does.
That's something I'll never forget.<eos> We had fun watching the cubbies.<eos> Didn't we, Danny boy?<eos> [Laughs] Yeah.<eos> Yeah, Dad, we sure did.
What do you mean, "danger"?<eos> Jimmy, why would you say that?<eos> What?<eos> You said the family might be in danger.<eos> I did? I... oh, I, uh...
- I don't want to press charges.<eos> We talked about this.<eos> You want to press charges.<eos> No.<eos> No, I don't.
Well, i should -- gail's waiting for me, so i should...<eos> Yeah, it was -- it was nice to see you.<eos> Did you paint over our wall?<eos> The wall that we did together, mind map of our love, Complete with photographs and special, special notes?<eos> Yeah, i did.
I know everyone who comes in.<eos> Come on. Sit down.<eos> Yeah, sure.<eos> Sam: Did you know that she's a police officer?<eos> Yes, i did.
Come on. Sit down.<eos> Yeah, sure.<eos> Sam: Did you know that she's a police officer?<eos> Yes, i did.<eos> You did?
Found this one from last week.<eos> Attempted be, balcony entrance around midnight, Woman came home and found a guy in her apartment.<eos> She screamed and he took off.<eos> You want to check it out?<eos> Yeah. Yeah, i do.
Yeah, see you around, whatever your name is.<eos> Jamie.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> ¶ gravity gets us... ¶ You know i'm a cop, right?<eos> I do.
One of these names.<eos> Let's connect them.<eos> Let's see.<eos> Mary Chang went to book club, and what do you know?<eos> So did Aldo "icepick" Perez.
Get that dog out of here.<eos> [Police radio chatter] Could've saved yourself a lot of trouble if you had just told the truth.<eos> I didn't do anything.<eos> We thought you'd let me go when you figured that out.<eos> But you didn't.
Yeah...<eos> belongs to Boz Shepherd.<eos> Did you happen to see who was driving it today?<eos> You want me to say it was Boz.<eos> And what if I did?
Yeah, we've got him at the crime scene.<eos> An eyewitness I.D.'d him about an hour ago.<eos> Which means either our witness is lying or you may have been confused about this morning.<eos> Someone saw him at the baseball field?<eos> Yes, they did.
How's he doing?<eos> Doctor said he's gonna be all right.<eos> You really love him?<eos> He's an idiot most of the time, but... yeah.<eos> I do.
He's an idiot most of the time, but... yeah.<eos> I do.<eos> Do Boris and your brother get along?<eos> It's Winston, right? That's your brother.<eos> They do all right.
Uh, you have like 40 minutes to get ready and get out of here.<eos> Also, don't forget that Oliver's taking you, all right?<eos> Traci's gonna take me.<eos> Uh, do you have the music on your phone?<eos> I do. Okay.
- Yeah? - Yeah.<eos> I don't have time.<eos> All right.<eos> I mean, you know what you're doing, right?<eos> Of course I do.
Holy doodle, here we go.<eos> Oi, oi, Rachel.<eos> Shut up.<eos> Never gets old, does it?<eos> Yeah, it does.
All right?<eos> I mean...<eos> I guess you could call him honest.<eos> But I fucking hated him for it.<eos> I still do.
No, it's not really about work.<eos> It's for me.<eos> Well, for my cousin Carlos.<eos> You remember him?<eos> Yes, I do.
His whole fucking childhood.<eos> That's what I mean.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> - You know what I'm fucking talking about.<eos> - No, I don't.
And I'm always gonna love you, so... you know...<eos> That's the deal.<eos> - So...<eos> - I love you, too.<eos> I do.
It's one thing to make yourself miserable, but you're making everyone around you miserable, too.<eos> Now, I'm telling you for the last time-- take the cap off.<eos> Oh!<eos> Really?<eos> What if I don't?
Whatever container you put them in, they kind of creep up the sides and crawl out all on their own.<eos> Kind of like Sheldon's ant farm.<eos> Exactly, except you don't have a lunatic running around, yelling, "I fed you sugar water, why are you biting me?"<eos> Come on, this is boring-- you really want to talk about this?<eos> No, I do.
It's good.<eos> Really?<eos> I like it.<eos> I think you're on to something.<eos> You do?
Come on.<eos> Click the mouse with me.<eos> One... two... three...<eos> Click.<eos> Well, we did it.
Click the mouse with me.<eos> One... two... three...<eos> Click.<eos> Well, we did it.<eos> Yes, we did, my friend.
Well, I think you broke the dowels.<eos> You're not gonna have time to glue it back on-- you'll have to nail it.<eos> With what?<eos> Does she have any pillows or wine glasses?<eos> She does.
You know, for an extra four bucks,<eos> I can have this thing here tomorrow.<eos> Well, I know it was your idea, but the reporter said he's been following my work for a while, and the only reason they even mentioned it in the magazine is 'cause my name is on it.<eos> You know what?<eos> I did it.
Physics Today mentioned the paper.<eos> What'd they say?<eos> Who cares?<eos> Did they mention Leonard?<eos> They did.
Date night's over.<eos> Wait, no.<eos> We haven't picked a winner.<eos> We both know this one's gonna win.<eos> Well, of course we do.
Sweetie, you know you're supposed to wear clothes underneath a graduation gown.<eos> A: surprised you know that.<eos> B:<eos> I wanted to look like a sexy graduate for you.<eos> Oh. Well, you do.
And rule number one is pants.<eos> Hey, hey.<eos> You must be very proud of your son. Oh, yes.<eos> He recently argued a case before the Supreme Court.<eos> He did?
Okay.<eos> Do you like Robyn?<eos> Nah, do a dare.<eos> Oh, why?<eos> 'Cause you do?
Let him go, man.<eos> Sure.<eos> Yeah, I'll let him go.<eos> Just come out here.<eos> He didn't do anything.
- No.<eos> No, he broke me.<eos> He broke me, Claire.<eos> He knew it.<eos> We both did.
- Saul.<eos> - Saul?<eos> "S'all good, man."<eos> Get it?<eos> I do...
Add that to the $1,000...<eos> It's more than half.<eos> What do you know about that thing?<eos> I mean, is it worth more than $3,000?<eos> No, I don't...
What if Stannis never attacks Winterfell?<eos> Or he does and the Boltons defeat him?<eos> Then you will take this Bolton boy, Ramsay, and make him yours.<eos> I don't know how to do that.<eos> Of course you do.
In something greater than ourselves, I mean.<eos> The gods, destiny.<eos> Do you believe there's a plan for this world?<eos> No.<eos> Neither did I.
Have you ever heard baby dragons singing?<eos> No.<eos> It's hard to be a cynic after that.<eos> Doesn't mean she's going to be a great queen.<eos> No, it doesn't.
I think he's smart enough to understand that.<eos> I think the Sons of the Harpy have stopped killing because their leader was made king.<eos> Are you jealous?<eos> You think I'm petty enough to speak ill of a man just because he represents competition?<eos> I do.
You will try to help her?<eos> I'll do everything I can to win her freedom and her brother's.<eos> Your happiness is all I want in this world.<eos> - I know.<eos> - No, you don't.
No, it's not complicated at all.<eos> It's simple.<eos> I love Trystane, I'm going to marry him, and we're staying right here.<eos> - I don't understand.<eos> - Of course you don't.
But men worshipped here long before him.<eos> Who carved this altar?<eos> - Do you know?<eos> - I'm afraid I don't.<eos> No one does.
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.<eos> Hey, hey, hey.<eos> I say we send the Lord Commander back to Castle Black with no eyes.<eos> Hey, none of you saw Mance die.<eos> I did.
- No, you don't.<eos> What I'm trying to say-- what I'm trying and failing to say--<eos> I know what you're trying to say.<eos> No, I'm afraid you don't.<eos> I do.
Yeah, could you turn down the music?<eos> It's just a little loud and we're trying to work.<eos> That would be great.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Well, you did it.
And the pig is gonna whale on me.<eos> And all of you are gonna watch.<eos> So, piggy bank, you getting mad yet?<eos> You getting mad?<eos> Do your thing.
- I'm gonna tell.<eos> - Where is that thing?<eos> All right? I'm gonna tell.<eos> I'm gonna tell my lawyers what you did.<eos> Yeah, you do that.
Seriously?<eos> Well, the ladies, huh?<eos> What are you gonna do?<eos> Him I like.<eos> - And the baby does this.
He looks nice, though, he looks really nice.<eos> Hashtag, get naked!<eos> Yeah, no-one says ' "hashtag'" out loud, not any more.<eos> They do.<eos> My friends do.
- Molly, would it kill you to help?<eos> - I sort of need it now. Oh...<eos> Look, Cleo... if there's something I need to know, then you should tell me.<eos> Now, tell your Uncle Henry, that tone doesn't work with me, does it?<eos> No, it doesn't.
I mean, we had all sorts of problems.<eos> Daft things.<eos> You know, like any couple.<eos> I promised I'd learn to swim.<eos> I never did.
I'm sorry about that.<eos> I... apologise.<eos> Thank you.<eos> He liked... football, didn't he?<eos> Yes, he did.
Tell me!<eos> - I give a great blow job.<eos> - OK.<eos> In my opinion.<eos> So, what do you do?
He's an idiot.<eos> Come on!<eos> Just get it off.<eos> Pull it.<eos> Do the other one.
- I dunno.<eos> Straightaway.<eos> Veronica said you're one of those men that flirts with anyone.<eos> Did you tell her about us at your house?<eos> Well, did you?
I'm not sure that's fair.<eos> You make it sound like it was my fault.<eos> Well, you killed him.<eos> - I did not.<eos> - But... you did.
Funny thing is... that's what drove him away in the end.<eos> How d'you mean?<eos> Long story.<eos> But I liked him.<eos> I really did.
- Yes, all good, thanks. Hello.<eos> - How's the project?<eos> - What was that?<eos> - You had to do a project, you worked late, you had to get it finished by the weekend?<eos> Oh, the schedule, I did it, yes!
You couldn't keep out of prison long enough to hear if your pardon had been granted or not.<eos> Your petition of complaint against me?<eos> Surely you haven't forgotten.<eos> You recognize this?<eos> 'Course you do.
He could just get probation.<eos> What do...<eos> What do I have to do to get my son out of here?<eos> What do I...<eos> What do I do?
I mean, 'cause...<eos> No, but they're saying things about Matt.<eos> They're saying things about him, and I need to know.<eos> He had some grass around.<eos> Everybody does.
You ain't afraid to put yourself out there.<eos> And insight the second:<eos> You believe in the real America. Freedom. Self-sufficiency.<eos> I do.<eos> I... I really do.
OK, let me know how it goes.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Oh, you know, I've been meaning to tell you,<eos> Mariana stopped by my office today.<eos> - She did? Why?
Why would she do that?<eos> I think she...<eos> Sometimes it just gets to be too much, you know?<eos> Oh, I know.<eos> 'Course you do.
Not great.<eos> Really?<eos> Why not?<eos> I thought you said I had, autonomy, when it comes to academics here.<eos> - You do.
Yes, alright, we get it.<eos> But I think it's time to move on.<eos> And besides, I think it's irresponsible having a stuffed fox standing around in a kindergarten.<eos> You sound different from when we spoke on the phone.<eos> No, I don't.
Right down the middle sounds so boring.<eos> That's not what the audience wants to see.<eos> Thinking I'm gonna do a Jenny McCarthy thing, where I'm, like, super sexy, but I got a potty mouth.<eos> Ah-ah, no, no, Dee, you are never going to be sexy.<eos> And do not do a potty mouth thing, okay?
I turned a frustrating conversation into a joke on you.<eos> - The, uh... thing. - Huh? Oh, y-yeah.<eos> Frank, what do you think about this hole?<eos> Pretty cool, huh? You want to do something with it? No.<eos> I don't.
I'll tell Shawn to call his mom soon as he hits me up.<eos> That's some cold shit, K.<eos> What you think she gonna do when she find out you the one that clipped him?<eos> She ain't gonna find out shit, right?<eos> If you did your job right, right?
But then out at the mill pond, when I saw the scars on yer back, scars made by a lash laid down wi' such fury... you dinna fash yerself about it anymore.<eos> It was me.<eos> It's my fault that Randall beat ye so.<eos> You dinna ken what you're saying.<eos> But I do.
- You hear that music?<eos> - No. Feel that beat?<eos> Mnh-mnh.<eos> Come on, Peck. I saw dancing lessons on your bucket list.<eos> - No, you didn't.
- No. Feel that beat?<eos> Mnh-mnh.<eos> Come on, Peck. I saw dancing lessons on your bucket list.<eos> - No, you didn't.<eos> - Yes, I did.
Moore, hey. Um...<eos> This isn't a date, but I have some warm beer in my locker, and I was wondering if you wanted to get it...<eos> Hell yeah!<eos> - Okay.<eos> - I do.
Yeah.<eos> Okay, listen, you need to think this through.<eos> Think what through?<eos> You want to save Oliver, right?<eos> Of course I do.
It's funny.<eos> No?<eos> Okay, what's up, dov?<eos> You don't talk to me for months, And now you want to be my friend?<eos> Actually, no, i don't.
No?<eos> Okay, what's up, dov?<eos> You don't talk to me for months, And now you want to be my friend?<eos> Actually, no, i don't.<eos> No? You don't?
I kind of liked working intelligence with Marlo.<eos> Sorry to bring her up.<eos> It's fine.<eos> You want to talk about it?<eos> No, I really don't.
And sometimes that's all you can hope for.<eos> [ Footsteps depart ] [ Door opens ] Bill:<eos> Gail. They're ready for you.<eos> Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you god?<eos> I do.
- I'm not taking the train.<eos> Look, I only told you about the offer to give you an out.<eos> Giving me an out.<eos> I don't want an out.<eos> I never did, okay?
- Linus.<eos> - Checking.<eos> - They're taking it from me.<eos> - No, they can't.<eos> They did.
Uh, he was gone before I got up, but I... I saw my mom.<eos> Did you talk about anything?<eos> She asked me what I wanted for breakfast, and... and I said cereal, so she made me oatmeal before she started getting ready for her clients.<eos> And when does your mom normally leave for work?<eos> She doesn't.
Yeah, I know.<eos> It's a miracle that you survived us.<eos> You must be some superhuman kid.<eos> You know how much your mom and I love you.<eos> Yeah, I do.
No, I'm just enjoying my pancake and hoping there isn't a fire.<eos> Oh, very funny.<eos> Hey, look, Zoe, I'm here for you.<eos> I mean, I know what's going on.<eos> You do?
Yes.<eos> Yes! All right, well, we better get going 'cause, uh, got a reservation in, like, ten minutes.<eos> What?<eos> You made a reservation?<eos> Well, Wanda did.
I'm pregnant.<eos> Daddy, are you okay?<eos> Delilah said that Grandma Bettie summoned Shelby here.<eos> Oh, yes.<eos> Yes, she did.
Oh, and I broke up with Davis 'cause I still love you.<eos> Good night.<eos> George, do you think what we had, that we'll... find it with other people?<eos> No.<eos> No, I don't.
Last month you had dreadlocks, now you're a punk!<eos> Stupid pest!<eos> Why do you always befriend weirdos?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Nobody does.
Ah, but the storybook, Tesla device, the thread... all required to bring the library home.<eos> But almost...<eos> Well, almost as if these past months, your missions had been directed by fate itself.<eos> But the clipping book didn't send us to Santa.<eos> You did.
After school?<eos> Actually, she's--<eos> Because checkers is gonna start playing the violin And maybe they could do it together?<eos> Music lessons are in the art room, right?<eos> Actually, she doesn't do it at school.
Buffie doesn't trust you.<eos> He believes you know what happened to Steiner.<eos> I've been trying to call my son since yesterday, but he doesn't respond.<eos> Do you know where Steiner is?<eos> I do.
I'm not gonna be able to carry her out of here.<eos> - We have to wake her up.<eos> - How?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I do.
Daniella, I don't think you both were listening to me.<eos> What I'm saying is that he came to the set.<eos> - He came to the fucking set.<eos> - The director says he knows him.<eos> Yes, he did.
You're welcome.<eos> So, my stomach's rumbling like thunder.<eos> Jenny, how about you put some supper on the fire?<eos> You know yer way to the dining room, lads.<eos> I do indeed.
Aye, you don't sound like an islander.<eos> Well, Jamie spent time in France<eos> Fighting with the French army with Ian.<eos> Perhaps that's what's influenced his accent.<eos> Did you, now?
Three days, And still no sign of Jamie or Ian.<eos> Every day I sat on the steps And stared at the road, as if I could will them to appear.<eos> She had us well fooled, didn't she?<eos> Little Margaret Ellen Murray.<eos> She certainly did.
He has another one.<eos> Put it in the top of your stocking. Hold it with your garter.<eos> Never take it off, even when you sleep.<eos> Do you ken how to use a knife?<eos> Yes, I do.
Me?<eos> And a new look.<eos> That's jazzed you up a bit, eh?<eos> I look ridiculous.<eos> Aye, you do.
No, Murtagh.<eos> I need to have a word with the lady, alone.<eos> It'll be fine.<eos> Claire, I understand that you're grieving.<eos> I do.
You don't care about Robert.<eos> You wanted to sideline me.<eos> So you actually think you have a shot at this office?<eos> Yes, I do.<eos> And so does the leadership.
I love this place.<eos> I love, like, old, Italian-y places.<eos> If you, uh, go in the bathroom, there's a gun behind the toilet.<eos> Do you wanna have a sleepover tonight?<eos> Yeah, I really do.
Yes, exactly.<eos> Why?<eos> Because scary is fun-ruining, and I like fun.<eos> Do you like fun?<eos> No, I don't.
How do you think it makes me feel for you to say that to me?<eos> How do you think it makes me feel for you to say, you're no good, Lenny.<eos> You're a piece of garbage and I hope you die, Lenny.<eos> I didn't say any of that.<eos> Yes, you did!
Well, I wasn't after your job, if that's what you thought.<eos> I wasn't worried about you taking my job.<eos> Then what?<eos> You knew how shaky things were at home for her.<eos> We all did.
Is this a joke?<eos> No.<eos> No joke.<eos> You... you passed the bar?<eos> Yeah. I did.
How's he doing?<eos> Seems okay, like usual.<eos> I'd say we could grab a beer, but they're waiting on all that paperwork back at the office...<eos> You know how it is.<eos> Don't I, though?
But we keep it in our back pocket.<eos> Michael Corrigan?<eos> They're going to release him when we visit.<eos> You made a miracle happen.<eos> We did.
I think it's about respect.<eos> And you're not respecting his pain.<eos> - His pain doesn't matter.<eos> - How can you say that?<eos> Because mine doesn't either.
It took me years to realize that that doesn't make... them any less.<eos> It actually made them more, because we're human beings, and we all make mistakes.<eos> You know?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I do.
Of course you did.<eos> We were playing golf with him less than 45 minutes before he died.<eos> Uh, where's your fourth?<eos> Nobody plays golf in threesomes.<eos> We do.
- Well, you're getting an abortion tomorrow.<eos> - No.<eos> - Yes.<eos> - I love him.<eos> - You don't.
We'll go buy one today.<eos> I wanna have a baby.<eos> No. I know that you think that you do, but...<eos> - I know what I want and what I don't want.<eos> - No, you don't.

Always had to be right there, devil on her shoulder, judging her, making her doubt herself.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> She called off the wedding.<eos> Yeah.<eos> She did.
Privately? We... we can't do that.<eos> 'Cause we're Ruke or Layna or whatever the hell we are.<eos> And no offense, but I respect your right to call off the wedding.<eos> The least you could do is respect my right to be extremely pissed off about it.<eos> I do. I do.
I'm the girl who can't open soup.<eos> He wants to make money, okay?<eos> He has zero desire to nurture talent.<eos> He doesn't care what you really have to say as a songwriter.<eos> Well, nobody does.
I'm not gonna see her cut her first record or walk down the aisle.<eos> I might not even see her finish this school year, all right?<eos> - You don't know any of that.<eos> You don't know that.<eos> - I do, Scarlett.
I'm getting rid of them.<eos> I really hope that Rayna is a better party host than she is a party planner, because these... these are disgusting.<eos> - Really?<eos> I think they're pretty.<eos> - Do you?
What do you think?<eos> Hey, after that interview, I'm happy to let the music do the talking.<eos> I gotta say, I'm still really disappointed about that Jade St. John concert. I wish we could go...<eos> Mom, I told you, I already had plans.<eos> Yes, you did.
I listened to the song, like, a hundred times, and it's great.<eos> I don't know why I was such a... um, I don't know, maybe the stress of the album.<eos> Yeah, maybe that was it.<eos> Well, anyway, I just wanted to apologize.<eos> And I did.
I have a song to go finish.<eos> - Of all the boys in Nashville... - [laughs]<eos> I think he's a good kid, though,<eos> - and we know ours is.<eos> - Yeah, we do.
Deacon...<eos> Um...<eos> You beat this thing, brother.<eos> You got a lot to live for.<eos> - That I do. - [Cheers and applause]
I came over...<eos> [Sighs] I came over to ask you out.<eos> I don't... I don't know if you knew that I was...<eos> And... and... not that I want people to know<eos> - because I don't...
H... hi.<eos> What a lovely surprise.<eos> Shouldn't be.<eos> I told you when you were in L.A.<eos> You did.
Everything all right?<eos> I'm not at liberty to say.<eos> Teddy, I, uh...<eos> I know about Deacon.<eos> - You do?
Caleb.<eos> Is there something you can do, somebody you can talk to?<eos> Wha... that's not how this works.<eos> Um, that's the surgical team's decision, and I'm not on the surgical team.<eos> [Crying] Please do something.
Unless, of course, it isn't.<eos> Hi.<eos> It's me.<eos> - Gunnar: How'd it go?<eos> - It didn't.
It was a miracle that they found that one.<eos> [Voice breaking] And the last time they measured his tumor, it was 4.7 centimeters.<eos> At 5 centimeters, he's off the list completely.<eos> And at the rate that this thing is growing, that's gonna happen way before they find another donor.<eos> - Why don't you do it?
Friends call me Bill.<eos> I'm a big fan of yours, Mr. Wheeler.<eos> Oh, no, call me Luke.<eos> Uh, your son tell you he's the first artist I signed to my label?<eos> No, he did not.
Feel like one.<eos> Oh, baby.<eos> I want so badly to believe there's gonna be some kind of hail mary pass here, you know?<eos> But...<eos> I don't.
I just got here, and I don't think the baby's been fed or changed in hours.<eos> And Juliette just left for the studio.<eos> - What?<eos> She said she was gonna stay with the baby.<eos> - Well, she didn't.
What we had was good.<eos> Good night.<eos> Last couple days away with you were great.<eos> I don't want my dad showing' up to ruin all that.<eos> I don't either.
Yeah, well, I... you gotta understand somethin'.<eos> My father told me he loved me tonight.<eos> Now, he never once said that when I was a kid.<eos> I always knew he did until...<eos> Well, he didn't.
How... how could you say that?<eos> He doesn't know the real you.<eos> He just knows the Will Lexington who's a rising country star, the Will Lexington who's straight now.<eos> - Nah, you don't understand.<eos> - No, I do.
It doesn't work.<eos> It never worked.<eos> With modified ammunition it works perfectly well.<eos> Easy, if you know what you're doing.<eos> And you do, Carl, don't you?
- You better tell me.<eos> - No!<eos> - Fine.<eos> Don't tell me.<eos> - I won't.
Well, let's also see what's here.<eos> You grow up quickly, "Kay".<eos> It grew two and a half centimeters In a month, my grandfather.<eos> Tell your mother. That her career It is not important to see her family.<eos> I will.
Do you understand?<eos> Will no one help me?<eos> I'll help, Maurice.<eos> What?<eos> You will?
What?<eos> If you thought it was possible to kick my children out the door and steal everything we, as a family, built over the years, then you're sadly mistaken.<eos> This is a blackmail scheme.<eos> Well, it won't work.<eos> No, it won't. No, it won't.
Others before me may have felt it was their destiny... but I am Danny Rand.<eos> And I'm the Iron Fist.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I wish you could understand.<eos> I never will.
And I know that you think that killing Harold is gonna make you feel better, that it's somehow gonna make everything okay, but it's not.<eos> She's right, Danny.<eos> You can't kill Harold.<eos> I can.<eos> And I will.
You can't shoot them.<eos> You know that, right?<eos> You shoot, you give away your position.<eos> And they'll fucking find you.<eos> They will.
For whom?<eos> We have no idea who they are, who they pretend to be.<eos> It's been 12 hours!<eos> He will break.<eos> No, he won't.
I don't know.<eos> Is there something I can do?<eos> If there is, then please tell me.<eos> Do you want to turn around and go home?<eos> 'Cause we will.
Done, and I'll throw in a garter.<eos> We shouldn't allow this.<eos> I can't look, it makes me sick.<eos> Do you want me to say something?<eos> I will.
He's not.<eos> And he wasn't here yesterday.<eos> He'd better be here for this pep rally today.<eos> So, if you see him, tell him his ass gonna be running suicides until the lights go out.<eos> I will.
Right?<eos> We could.<eos> But I doubt it.<eos> I would hate for us to have to face those repercussions.<eos> Maybe we won't.
Nothing happens, okay?<eos> I'm ending this shit right now.<eos> He doesn't think that Hannah's lying.<eos> He could tell people the wrong things.<eos> He won't.
Before she died...<eos> Hannah recorded 13 reasons why she killed herself.<eos> And you're number 13.<eos> And everyone who comes before you on these tapes knows what you did and didn't do.<eos> And they always will.
I've been sitting here, trying to figure out how I could, with what happened, with our friends still out there, still being hurt by them.<eos> I don't know how I could've said that.<eos> And now... I am trapped.<eos> You have to help me.<eos> I will.
Have you, uh, changed your mind about taking that allergy medication?<eos> Yes.<eos> Good.<eos> I think you'll get adjusted to the place, sinus-wise.<eos> No, I won't.
How long do you think to Port Royal?<eos> I'll make it.<eos> I promise you I will make it.<eos> Don't you dare let him catch you, don't you dare.<eos> I won't.
Or was I just to discover you gone when I got back from Hawaii?<eos> The latter.<eos> I told you I would get help.<eos> Did you make an appointment?<eos> No, but I will.
- That's enough.<eos> We should be running.<eos> There's nowhere to run.<eos> Then we have a serious problem, as Captain Berringer is going to demand she identify her connections to the resistance, which is us.<eos> She won't.
Where the fuck is the book, Michael?<eos> No, no, no!<eos> He's not ready.<eos> - He'll destroy it!<eos> - No, he won't.
No, no, no!<eos> He's not ready.<eos> - He'll destroy it!<eos> - No, he won't.<eos> The fuck I won't, John!
I was alerted the minute he boarded the plane in Tehran.<eos> Well, what are you gonna do about it?<eos> He and Saul cannot meet.<eos> Otherwise, everything unravels.<eos> They won't.
I saw the look I used to see in the eyes of my husband.<eos> He thought he could do what he wanted to me.<eos> They made the same mistake like him.<eos> They won't make it again.<eos> No, they won't.
- Like what?<eos> Making sure this place is secure from cyberattack.<eos> - You've already done that.<eos> - But I have to oversee all our trading software, all our servers, my team.<eos> And you will.
Hey, I just wanted you to know that I spoke with Professor Marillo.<eos> She said that any time you experience anything racist, you need to report it immediately.<eos> Right.<eos> Like that'll do any good.<eos> No, it will.
I think that Grunwald is starting to rub off on me.<eos> Well, I'm not gonna challenge the logic in that.<eos> Noel's dead, but Jenna's still out there.<eos> - I mean, we have to find her.<eos> - We will.
Can we not go there right now?<eos> Tomorrow night is the weekly staff meeting.<eos> The entire Radley crew is held hostage in a room for an hour and told to smile more.<eos> Even if no one in the hotel sees her the security cameras will.<eos> No, they won't.
I don't know.<eos> You'd have to speak to Ashley Marin.<eos> I already did.<eos> We spoke last night.<eos> And we will again.
We here at Fillmore-Graves are preparing for D-Day.<eos> Discovery Day, the day when humans, en masse, learn of our existence.<eos> What do you think happens then, Liv?<eos> I thought it would be in our best interests if it didn't get out.<eos> Maybe it won't, but it probably will.
Not to mention now I've got eight entire wills to finish up.<eos> Whaddya talking about?<eos> I'll do the wills.<eos> No, you won't.<eos> 'Course I will.
I'll catch up... after I stop the Downworld from coming after you.<eos> I'll see you soon, kiddo.<eos> Hey.<eos> If anything happens to her...<eos> It won't.
But at what point do we say he's been gone too long?<eos> We don't. Okay?<eos> If I don't make it...<eos> Stop.<eos> You will.
Oswald, you and I will rule this city together.<eos> OSWALD: Yes.<eos> But first, I have to kill Ed Nygma.<eos> He has to die.<eos> MOONEY: Oh, he will.
Precisely.<eos> Once the time paradox catches up with him, then... he'll be erased from existence.<eos> But I saw him. He didn't disappear.<eos> - Not yet.<eos> - But he will, Joe.
Whatever my son is doing, he is doing it because he is hurt and he is scared, and I will not help you destroy his life.<eos> Innocent people are dying, and you might be our only chance to save them.<eos> Get out of my house.<eos> I'm easily reachable if you change your mind.<eos> I won't.
You're not coming back to the office?<eos> No, I got an unofficial lunch with a potential big foreign donor for the Meyer Fund.<eos> That could get us into trouble down the line.<eos> Señor Ocampo is having trouble nudging his visas through, so I called our friends over at the State Department.<eos> That definitely will.
You're pretty.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Take care of yourself, Hot Pie.<eos> Try not to get killed.<eos> Ah, I won't.
Oswald, you and I will rule this city together.<eos> Yes.<eos> But first, I have to kill Ed Nygma.<eos> He has to die.<eos> He will.
What?<eos> Iris.<eos> Have you lost your mind?<eos> Dad will kill us.<eos> No, no, Wally, he won't.
He did it!<eos> He actually did it.<eos> He bloody well did it.<eos> I won't kill him!<eos> I won't!
What about him?<eos> I need you to make me a promise, okay?<eos> If things don't go our way...<eos> - if Savitar kills me...<eos> - He won't.
If things don't go our way...<eos> - if Savitar kills me...<eos> - He won't.<eos> - if he does...<eos> - He won't.
Good luck.<eos> Weird, it feels just like "Back to the Future."<eos> Which would make me Doc Brown.<eos> You're not gonna give me some kind of letter, are you?<eos> No, I will not.
All right, so we got what? An hour till dark?<eos> Which puts us at six hours till midnight?<eos> That sounds about right.<eos> Dean, we gotta talk about this.<eos> Okay, we will. All right?
We earned a break.<eos> Yeah.<eos> We'll get there.<eos> No.<eos> No, we won't.
But Mr. Poe...<eos> The adults will take care of it from here.<eos> Come on, Klaus.<eos> The adults won't take care of anything.<eos> But we will.
When I am governor...<eos> When you're governor?<eos> What the fuck happened to you?<eos> When this gets out...<eos> It won't.
It's all about the light.<eos> The right light will hide a multitude of sins.<eos> Leave my card here on the table.<eos> If he shows.<eos> He won't.
Yeah.<eos> Hello?<eos> This story is bigger than we thought.<eos> I started asking around, to see if what happened to you happened to anyone else, and if anyone would go on record.<eos> - I will. 100%.
- Finally.<eos> - What's wrong?<eos> What's wrong is my daughter is hiding a gun in her bedroom, and that's just for starters.<eos> - I can explain...<eos> - Oh, you will.
He does some coaching on the side and I told him about you.<eos> You wanna meet him?<eos> Yeah, yeah I'd love to, but football...<eos> No, Archie can.<eos> And he will.
Archibald, have a word?<eos> I'll be right back.<eos> I just wanted to let you know that I've decided to help your father.<eos> You did?<eos> You will?
Just keep dancing.<eos> And smiling.<eos> Betty keeps asking Cheryl about me, she needs to stop.<eos> As long as she's worried about you, Polly, she'll never stop.<eos> Yes, she will...
You know, when I went after this story...<eos> I thought, in the back of my mind that,<eos> "What if this is it?<eos> What if this is finally the time that she doesn't come back?"<eos> She will, Mom.
It's just, I want you with me.<eos> I don't think that this town is safe anymore.<eos> I feel like Riverdale is getting ready to slide off of a mountainside, and I don't want you anywhere around when that happens.<eos> Just promise me you'll at least think about it.<eos> Yeah, I will.
And I wanted this weekend to bring us together, but it feels like she's pulling away.<eos> And you have no idea how much this relationship means to me.<eos> I told everyone about it.<eos> It can't fall apart now.<eos> Well, it won't.
I've missed you, too.<eos> And that toilet upstairs has been running for three weeks, and it is driving me insane.<eos> So you are gonna have to... put your hand in that tank ASAP.<eos> Honey, I will put my hand in an unflushed toilet bowl for you.<eos> (exhales) Yeah, you will.
I dwell on them a bit.<eos> Starting with right there...<eos> The City Park Rapist.<eos> Can't believe we didn't get him.<eos> Yeah. We will.
- What?<eos> - They're gonna come for you.<eos> That's ridiculous.<eos> They won't blame me for your bad choices.<eos> Of course they will.
Thanks, everyone.<eos> Did I do all right?<eos> In what way?<eos> You said if I did well, you'd... .. you'd tell them to look after me better.<eos> Yeah, I will.
Solomon told me I had to go back or he'll hurt me.<eos> He won't hurt you.<eos> I won't let him.<eos> - He'll hurt my friends.<eos> - No, he won't.
He'd do anything for anyone.<eos> Why would any...?<eos> You find who hurt him.<eos> You find who hurt my baby.<eos> We will, Mrs Finch.
‐ He's also a 10R who I can trust. ‐ He's also a 10R who I can trust.<eos> ‐ Decisions always went through Steve.<eos> We did what we thought was best.<eos> You'll see what it's like to have the weight of The Movement's future on your shoulders.<eos> ‐ Yes I will, Felicia.
- Yes.<eos> - All right.<eos> Whoa, hey, what... What are you doing?<eos> I'll do the honors.<eos> - No, no, you won't.
The senate may favor miller for defense, but...<eos> Well, look at betty bossypants!<eos> Isn't she adorable?<eos> You have to allow me to do something.<eos> And I will.
Go. Now.<eos> You know I'm right.<eos> They'll find another assassin.<eos> We can't let that happen.<eos> We won't.
I need to see for myself!<eos> The bomb damage is mainly to the left wing.<eos> Mr. D'Abberville's room is gone.<eos> - What if someone finds out what we did?<eos> - They won't.
What you gon' do?<eos> Something I shoulda done a long time ago.<eos> I just had coffee with king valentine.<eos> Do you want your friend to go to jail?<eos> Because he will.
We just have a few questions.<eos> "Questions." The arrogance.<eos> God won't answer them.<eos> - He might.<eos> - No, He won't.
- Already tried.<eos> She turned me down.<eos> She didn't turn me down.<eos> Well, she'll have to testify.<eos> She will.
I'm not sure, honey.<eos> We have to keep you safe.<eos> So he won't find me here?<eos> Hey... he's never gonna find you, okay?<eos> No, he won't.
It's got to be the stick.<eos> I don't know how else to explain it.<eos> I-I tried to use it on her.<eos> It didn't work.<eos> This will.
Nor do I.<eos> But you, your influence is great -- there's much good you could do.<eos> And is not Sir Francis a goodly man?<eos> Yes, but he too uses his power for his own ends and he would use me if I would let him.<eos> But I will not.
If I had known what was going to happen on Eros, I would have stopped the project and Jules-Pierre Mao along with it and you know that!<eos> Eros nearly destroyed this planet.<eos> You will have to answer for your part in that.<eos> I know...<eos> And I will.
So I prayed for a miracle.<eos> - What happened?<eos> - Air Force Para Jumpers pulled him out of the ocean half-dead.<eos> Never forgotten those guys.<eos> Never will.
Arthur's been trying to prevent humankind from reaching too far.<eos> All of the training has been for this.<eos> To ensure life and death remain separate.<eos> But if he crosses that bridge...<eos> He won't!
I think you're a liar.<eos> 'Cause you said we would find Hannah.<eos> You will find her.<eos> No.<eos> We will.
No.<eos> I'm her superior.<eos> You give me your cooperation, I will give you my protection.<eos> And like Earl Anthony bagging the 7-10 split.<eos> You will?
I'm her superior.<eos> You give me your cooperation, I will give you my protection.<eos> And like Earl Anthony bagging the 7-10 split.<eos> You will?<eos> I will.
- They're liars.<eos> - What? Sign?<eos> Somebody has to pay, Moody!<eos> Soon.<eos> Someone will.
- and their fortune will be mine.<eos> - Rats!<eos> You and your ridiculous comrades will be swept away.<eos> - We'll see about that.<eos> - Yes, we will.
You cannot be serious.<eos> Very serious.<eos> Get me a beer.<eos> So who's going in?<eos> I will.
Maybe.<eos> Just us girls next time.<eos> We can braid each other's hair.<eos> We can still catch her.<eos> I will.
You pay Lidstrom to stay quiet about it.<eos> So why are you telling me?<eos> Why not just file your report?<eos> Because I want to understand.<eos> You won't.
Fuck! What do I do?<eos> I choose life.<eos> I'm gonna give you mouth-to-mouth, guy.<eos> - Don't, actually.<eos> - I won't.
And you know if they do that, she gonna give us up, Tommy, to protect her kids.<eos> Nah.<eos> I wouldn't even blame her.<eos> I mean, what are we supposed to do if Tasha starts talking?<eos> She won't.
Formal identification has not yet been completed... .. but Poppy was last seen on 6th April.<eos> Helen, it's me.<eos> They're taking me in for questioning.<eos> Would you come with me, please?<eos> Yeah, of course I will.
Are you staying here tonight?<eos> Yes.<eos> No, he's not. I'm not sure.<eos> There's no reason to.<eos> I probably will.
- But you suck it out.<eos> And the significance of that was not lost on us.<eos> Yeah, I feel like this conversation could probably happen some other time. Lucy, we love you.<eos> And because of that night and, like, how long you stayed...<eos> - we always will. Aw.
He told you he saw Jamie that night?<eos> He just kept saying it was an accident and Jamie just fell because he was drunk and...<eos> You need to find him.<eos> - Please, you need to find him.<eos> - We will.
I used to work on my dad's car.<eos> If it's overheating, you're gonna have to...<eos> Tommy, what are you doing?<eos> - You're gonna regret this.<eos> - No, I won't.
But, baby, I just don't understand why would you want to go to a school away from your family all of a sudden?<eos> I just do.<eos> Will you think about it?<eos> Please?<eos> All right, sure, I will.
James, there is nothing for them to find.<eos> No body, no recording, no murder weapon, no crime scene.<eos> They are just trying to scare me to get me to say something, anything.<eos> Which you won't do.<eos> Which I won't.
That's fair.<eos> My bad.<eos> Look, you let me know if you need anything in here, okay?<eos> Okay.<eos> I will.
Her mother hasn't heard from her in three days.<eos> Dmitri says she'll be fired if she doesn't come to work tomorrow.<eos> Shit.<eos> - What if she tells them about us?<eos> - She won't.
They have to be broken in other ways.<eos> But make no mistake... they have to be broken.<eos> Many inmates have tried to make a fool of me over the years.<eos> None have succeeded.<eos> And none ever will.
He shot Benedict, and then he shot himself.<eos> You can't see a thing outside, man.<eos> Right up against the front door.<eos> When is the police coming?<eos> They will.
Me neither.<eos> Well someone has to.<eos> What about you?<eos> You're the leader here.<eos> I will.
I am, right?<eos> - Fuck.<eos> - It's okay.<eos> I'll call Wolfe, ask for some courtesy, have him back off.<eos> You will not.
People who can dress themselves in the morning?<eos> I'll tell you exactly who will buy this car.<eos> People who use roundy-ended scissors.<eos> Footballers.<eos> - No, they won't.
All right.<eos> We'll see how your friend does with the Traugott guard.<eos> But someone...<eos> Someone has to pay for this.<eos> And they will, but not with their lives.
You are strong, okay.<eos> And we are going to get through this.<eos> - Cal.<eos> - I won't be blackmailed.<eos> - Yes, you will.
Oh, my God!<eos> Look what you did to Jessica!<eos> Why are you so jealous of her, Caroline?<eos> You'll never be Jessica, okay?<eos> None of us will!
I feel bad that I killed him.<eos> Zack, no.<eos> That is your father talking.<eos> Don't let his way of thinking hold you back.<eos> I won't. I just...
Struck me more they were pretty broke as a family.<eos> - Hm. - How's her mam and dad?<eos> As you'd expect.<eos> Will you pass on my condolences?<eos> Aye, course I will.
He's crashing.<eos> Damn it, I need more volume.<eos> Oh, come on, I need more blood here!<eos> - He's not gonna make it.<eos> - Yes, he will.
They're gonna know if it's fake.<eos> Give me a minute.<eos> Nas, we can't use real explosives as bait.<eos> - Something could go wrong.<eos> - It won't.
this is all my fault.<eos> No, it's not.<eos> We both made bad decisions today.<eos> I'll take full responsibility for the HMX.<eos> No, you won't.
I'll call you later.<eos> Bye.<eos> Liar.<eos> I hope your friends back home appreciate the contraband.<eos> They will.
Will you relax?<eos> They're not gonna know it's us.<eos> That's why they wore these things.<eos> What if they recognize our shoes?<eos> They won't.
Let's hope King James is better than his cousin, Lady Gordon, at spotting a peasant in silk.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Goodnight, my loves.<eos> Remember to say your prayers.<eos> I will.
Us.<eos> That's how Olivia knew.<eos> Everything is on that document.<eos> - If anyone else sees it...<eos> - They won't.
That seems to be a popular choice with the people I care about.<eos> - Monty, I... - It'll be light out soon.<eos> That bunker gives us a chance for a future.<eos> I hope you'll change your mind.<eos> I won't.
La Garza.<eos> It's only a short walk.<eos> Best fried fish and coconut rice in the world.<eos> La Garza.<eos> We will.
Here.<eos> In the city.<eos> What'd your mom say about it?<eos> She gets it.<eos> Oror she will.
It's a trap!<eos> No!<eos> Nooo!<eos> Got the chance to start over again.<eos> And now you will, too.
- No.<eos> - Oh. - We've hit a snag a bump in the road... turbulence.<eos> Sir, I can gate check that for you.<eos> - It'll fit.<eos> - No, sir, it won't.
It's irreversible brain damage after six minutes.<eos> It matters to this guy.<eos> If I come up there, I lose my guy!<eos> If you stay there, we lose two people!<eos> No, we won't, all right?
Pen.<eos> And I got through it.<eos> Pearl.<eos> Stoplight.<eos> So will you.
I don't understand.<eos> Why does he think that... that killing Emma with this blade will make him the Savior?<eos> He's not the first one to think wielding that sword would make him a hero.<eos> We have to find him before he gets his hands on it, before he goes after Emma again.<eos> We will.
Gideon has the sword now.<eos> It's more powerful than ever.<eos> He'll go after the Savior once again.<eos> I just hope there's enough time that we can stop him before he does.<eos> We will.
All right, well...<eos> EMTs should be here shortly.<eos> They can take a look at you.<eos> You know I got to take you in, right?<eos> You won't.
Tell them Paul Lefebvre is here.<eos> The agent?<eos> No, the French teacher.<eos> Are you going to tell him?<eos> I will.
Wait. Are all these Peter Gregory's notebooks? Um...<eos> - Are they?<eos> Are they in this box?<eos> - Richard. Remember, you promised you were gonna get some sleep tonight.<eos> Yeah, I will.
Margot's contact says Helldritch is in Hong Kong.<eos> We have no jurisdiction there.<eos> Our only shot at recovering the WITSEC list is to have The Harem steal it, and I've got to be there.<eos> - If Emma rolls on you?<eos> - She won't.
Oi!<eos> That's what I'm going to do.<eos> ..or you can join me in escaping.<eos> I'll show you the way.<eos> Yeah, you will.
We need to make this right.<eos> So?<eos> So tomorrow, we end Joel's suffering.<eos> Okay.<eos> We will.
It's a poem I wrote to Margaret on the morning she died.<eos> Would you mind reading it for us?<eos> "An angel sighs, an angel flies"... "an ang..."<eos> I can't finish.<eos> Oh, I will.
My treat.<eos> If you're free tomorrow night, maybe we could eat.<eos> I'd like that.<eos> I'll see you at around 7:00?<eos> Yes, you will.
You would say that, wouldn't you?<eos> What does that mean?<eos> What do you think it means?<eos> You tell me.<eos> All right, I will, Mommy's boy.
Yeah.<eos> He's not cut out for prison, though.<eos> They're gonna eat him up in there.<eos> If he testifies against Angelo, I'll cut him a deal with the D.A.<eos> He will.
"the crossing guard's jamboree."<eos> That was fun! We were directing traffic in the hotel hallways.<eos> People were freaking out.<eos> Mm-hmm. Just don't make us regret this.<eos> I won't.
- That's very much on the table.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - And when you do...<eos> - I'll be there to stop you.<eos> - No, you won't.
- And when you do...<eos> - I'll be there to stop you.<eos> - No, you won't.<eos> - Yes, I will.<eos> - No, you won't.
The destruction of a Time Lord, however, is a particular honour.<eos> This technology is precisely calibrated.<eos> As you can see, it will stop both hearts, all three brain stems, and deliver a cellular shock wave that will permanently disable regenerative ability.<eos> I know how it works.<eos> You certainly will in a moment.
Are you all right, Friday?<eos> Sir.<eos> Who are you and what the devil are you doing here?<eos> I could ask you the same question.<eos> And I will!
Wherever it is, I'm staying!<eos> No!<eos> I will not change.<eos> I will not change.<eos> I will not!
Alice begged me to get her down, but I couldn't, and honestly, I...<eos> I yelled at her, because sometimes that is what one does when one is ashamed.<eos> And the cat... did not end well.<eos> I don't know if Alice ever forgave me for not being brave enough.<eos> Maybe she will now.
All of us.<eos> We won't all make it.<eos> Isn't it better some of us live than all of us die?<eos> You'll remember me, Right?<eos> Of course, I will.
They knew what it took to stop them.<eos> We knew lines had to be crossed.<eos> You have betrayed every oath that you have ever taken.<eos> Once all this is over, you're gonna pay for everything you've done.<eos> Everyone will, Alex.
They'll be safe, Ezra.<eos> All right.<eos> Your rebel friends are going to bring the Empire down on all of us.<eos> You believe the Darksaber will protect you?<eos> It won't.
Leave us.<eos> I'll interrogate him myself.<eos> Don't you realize how dangerous it is for you to be here?<eos> - If anyone recognizes you...<eos> - They won't.
- Excuse me?<eos> Look, the committee is just gonna have to wait.<eos> In two weeks, it's gonna be over anyway, and you're gonna be on the wrong side of this thing.<eos> - Well, we'll see.<eos> - Yes, we will.
The Gambit,<eos> Lian Yu,<eos> League of Assassins, you dying.<eos> I could take it all back.<eos> But you won't.
Help me with what? Your little fairy problem which you don't seem able to solve.<eos> The blue fairy.<eos> We might be able to wake her.<eos> Unless you found a way.<eos> Not yet, but I will.
Okay.<eos> Okay.<eos> Thanks.<eos> When I was dancing with that girl... with Kathy... I was thinking, "I'm gonna remember this night."<eos> Now everyone will.
- No, no, no.<eos> Don't apologize.<eos> I feel the same way.<eos> Look, I love you, Alex.<eos> I always will.
I just have to kill the last one.<eos> Ambassadors and advisors, to the tower.<eos> Champions, to your flags.<eos> May we meet again.<eos> Damn right we will.
- No, not really.<eos> - Was it the radiator?<eos> I need to get that thing fixed.<eos> When are you gonna tell Weller about my memory... about Emma Shaw?<eos> I will, okay?
But I guess we'll just have to make do.<eos> - Oh, we'll make do.<eos> - We'll make do all over it.<eos> - Well, I just mean we'll fix it.<eos> - Hells yeah, we will.
Are you deliberately thick?<eos> 'Eh, what's all this about, eh?<eos> 'Aggressive? I'll show you aggressive when I undo this belt!<eos> 'Oh, will you now?<eos> Yeah, I will, yeah.'
Hey. So how is she?<eos> Doctor-patient privilege ring a bell?<eos> Take it outside, cowboy.<eos> Now, who's driving me back?<eos> - I will.
But what you don't know is that after they did, a lawyer...came to my grandmother and made her an offer.<eos> She took it, instead of going to court.<eos> And I am telling you, she regretted that for the rest of her life.<eos> Oscar, there's no price that'll make the pain go away.<eos> Then what will?
They took everything out the smokehouse.<eos> And that ain't tax.<eos> They just ate it. All that meal we ground.<eos> -We'll get you more cornmeal.<eos> -Of course we will.
Jack wasn't naive.<eos> But he had ideals.<eos> Ideals he could rally others to believe in.<eos> Will those ideals live on?<eos> Sure they will.
And you destroyed one of my tugs.<eos> Actually, sir, if anybody's to blame...<eos> Sir, I lost my focus.<eos> It won't happen again.<eos> No, it won't.
Well, I wouldn't know, you haven't asked.<eos> Well, I'm asking you, with all my heart and then some.<eos> - Will you marry me?<eos> - Then, yes.<eos> Yes, I will.
Dreamed I got myself skewered.<eos> I couldn't do nothing.<eos> Rifle's just there.<eos> It won't bite.<eos> Yeah, it will.
Maybe I could see you in a week?<eos> You name the place.<eos> I'll be there.<eos> How will I find you?<eos> You won't.
The Lord surely will provide.<eos> Now, now. Bogue is a businessman.<eos> If you just reason with him, he'll give you a fair share.<eos> - Yeah. Right.<eos> Sure he will. - Fair share, Gavin?
Finally, they have a decent guestroom so I can stay over when I get blasted.<eos> - Michelle.<eos> - What's "blasted"?<eos> I'll show you in about three drinks.<eos> - No, she won't.
They need to see the fraud you are.<eos> With their eyes.<eos> The blood on your hands.<eos> What have you done?<eos> Hmm. And tonight, they will.
Exactly what I predicted.<eos> The Heretic disciples came in the night and stole the body.<eos> Already they're proclaiming, He has arisen from the dead!<eos> And the people believe it?<eos> The weak, will.
Nina.<eos> Are you alright?<eos> She's fine.<eos> Then let her go!<eos> We will.
Maui!<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Finding you a better way in!<eos> - We won't make it!<eos> - Yes, we will!
So these men will probably try to sell him to someone else.<eos> And then there will be some talking, you know.<eos> Oh, my God, Fahim.<eos> They're gonna kill him.<eos> No, they will not, Kim, inshallah.
It's true.<eos> He had a good long run in the military.<eos> Don't cover up for him.<eos> So, Kim, are you gonna stay for dinner?<eos> Of course she will.
Oh.<eos> You have to talk to her.<eos> I know.<eos> It's getting crazy.<eos> I will.
Quick, quick, quick!<eos> I has a boo-boo.<eos> Well, you's a big boy.<eos> You take care of your boo-boos yourself now.<eos> Oh, I will.
I has a boo-boo.<eos> Well, you's a big boy.<eos> You take care of your boo-boos yourself now.<eos> Oh, I will.<eos> Oh, he Will!
The hologram, I've seen it.<eos> It must be destroyed.<eos> I know.<eos> I know.<eos> We will.
On the same day, he took documents and disappeared.<eos> -Have you announced the search?<eos> -Yes, but nothing found yet.<eos> -Did you find those?<eos> -No, but we will.
That won't happen.<eos> We won't let that happen.<eos> We have to trust in this.<eos> In this I do.<eos> And in this I will.
If you get a strike, it's going to slice it right open.<eos> You know what happens then.<eos> What'?<eos> Sharks will smell the blood and they'll rip this boat apart.<eos> No, they won't.
You know what happens then.<eos> What'?<eos> Sharks will smell the blood and they'll rip this boat apart.<eos> No, they won't.<eos> Yeah, they will.
What'?<eos> Sharks will smell the blood and they'll rip this boat apart.<eos> No, they won't.<eos> Yeah, they will.<eos> Dad, will they?
He knows our security standards.<eos> Please do not fire him.<eos> - I will, I will.<eos> No, I mean don't fire him.<eos> But I will.
- I'm pressing the panic button.<eos> If I manage to get in range, the system will call 911 to the police.<eos> No, wait.<eos> We can't go to jail.<eos> No. No, we won't
He won't have her in the house, and I'm not putting her in a home.<eos> She's mine.<eos> GUNSHOTS ON TV<eos> I won't bow down to them.<eos> I won't!
So should you, Mrs Tucker.<eos> At least I'm not a thief!<eos> I think you should ask Sister Julienne to take you off other midwifery duties until we know what this is.<eos> If it's what you suspect, then we want to minimise the chance of contamination.<eos> - I will.
[door opens and bell dings]<eos> - Hey, Counselor.<eos> - Aw, don't jinx me, Pop.<eos> I haven't even passed the bar yet.<eos> - Oh, you will. - [chuckles]
What about you?<eos> [sighing]<eos> Another question for another time, my man.<eos> We gotta figure out something soon either way.<eos> [sighs] I will.
That's huge.<eos> Good one. Couldn't have done better myself.<eos> - We can keep this going for ages.<eos> - Yeah, let's see if they buy it first.<eos> They will. They will.
It's clean.<eos> - I doubt that. - It is.<eos> Nah.<eos> He'll find something.<eos> No, he won't.
It's fine.<eos> I have a number here I can give you.<eos> No, she wanted you.<eos> I'm sure Charlene will get over it.<eos> No, she really won't.
- Oh, fine!<eos> Find me a woman!<eos> - All right, then.<eos> - Good.<eos> I will.
Is that what you're telling me?<eos> Why is she doing this?<eos> No one'll believe it.<eos> If it's her word against yours.<eos> Yes, they will.
Previously on AMC's Hell On Wheels.<eos> I'm coming back for you and the baby.<eos> Don't say it.<eos> I will.
I don't mean in my tender heart it still pains me so.<eos> I can still feel what he did in my body standing here right now.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> You said you would protect me.<eos> And I will.
This practice I can take over.<eos> Do you want to leave?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Tom can come as often as he wants.<eos> That he will not.
And don't tell me about the kill order.<eos> We can go far away.<eos> Luna's clan will take us in.<eos> No.<eos> They won't.
Thank you.<eos> You heard him.<eos> He's not a bad man at heart.<eos> You have to tell them that.<eos> I will.
Kids now.<eos> So, you want to hire me?<eos> I want someone to die.<eos> Wait a while.<eos> They will.
What's wrong with him?<eos> Who knows?<eos> Mother wants a roast.<eos> And make it good this time.<eos> Yes, I will.
How are we going to find him now?<eos> You need to have faith, Bruce.<eos> I know what you risked today.<eos> If Barnes finds out you were involved...<eos> He will.
Okay, I'm applying for a mentorship program for up-and-coming detectives.<eos> It's called "Star Achieving Mentors,<eos> Star Achieving Mentees," or SAM-SAM for short.<eos> Would you write me a recommendation?<eos> Of course I will.
Ah.<eos> You're not mad?<eos> You're mad.<eos> You get to see him out in the world as a person.<eos> I never will.
- Enough.<eos> - Enough.<eos> - You enough.<eos> - Oh, fuck off.<eos> - No, I will not.
- Neal, after you.<eos> Got some loose lips on you, huh?<eos> - Excuse me?<eos> - No.<eos> I will not.
When she gets triggered, she lashes out.<eos> She'll change her mind, I promise.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> No, she won't, Arya. She's not gonna change her mind.<eos> Yes, she will.
I'm fine, Dad. I know.<eos> But your sister would have killed me for not at least saying it.<eos> Have you told her?<eos> I will. Dad...!<eos> I will.
I know it's all over.<eos> And I'm tormented by the wrong I've done him.<eos> But will you...?<eos> Will you ask him if he can forgive me?<eos> Of course I will.
I suspected the cause straight away, but I took a moment to recall the 18th century term for diabetes.<eos> I believe she has...<eos> Sugar sickness.<eos> And can you tell whether she will recover?<eos> She won't.
-He's getting shot in the head.<eos> OK, I see the brains getting blown out.<eos> I can show you pictures of heads shot up too.<eos> OK, show me.<eos> -I will.
The cache must be found.<eos> Right now, that is all that matters.<eos> And that said, the goodwill that we have engendered among the people of Nassau is not... without limits.<eos> The longer this drags out, the riskier it becomes, because if I find that money only to lose the street...<eos> You will not.
- Do it!<eos> He's seen our faces!<eos> Come on, man, do it now!<eos> My son will catch you!<eos> No, Mr. Pritchard, he won't.
Its part of the charm.<eos> I had a great time tonight.<eos> Yeah, me too.<eos> Well good. You call me again?<eos> Yes I will.
- Stay out of trouble.<eos> - Why do you need that?<eos> - Insurance.<eos> Case you get to thinking about filing a complaint.<eos> - I won't.
- Deva.<eos> - I'm not going back, Mom.<eos> There's no Wi-Fi and it smells like ass there.<eos> - Honey, if the court finds out...<eos> - They won't.
I get that.<eos> But if you pull her out before she has a chance to save her sister, she will never look at you the same way again.<eos> You know that.<eos> I can't lose her.<eos> And you won't.
No, I don't deserve time.<eos> You know, I'm not the one who pushed a baby out the hole next to my pee hole.<eos> You should have one, huh?<eos> A baby, I mean, not another... not another pee hole.<eos> Yeah, maybe I will.
Testify to what, detective?<eos> Hmm, that'll depend on his defense.<eos> I'm sure he'll try to cut a deal to stay off death row and implicate as many other people as he can.<eos> Hmm. You'll have to catch him first.<eos> Oh, we will.
Keep her safe in my church until you all lead the walkers away.<eos> Can you do this?<eos> I'm supposed to.<eos> I have to.<eos> I will.
Carl.<eos> No.<eos> Sooner or later, we're fighting our way out.<eos> I know that you're fully aware that we will.<eos> Yeah... we will.
Are you coming?<eos> Uh... I don't... I don't know what "Celebrity" is.<eos> - I don't have to. Uh, you know what?<eos> I'll just...<eos> I'll just, uh...
Can you just try and get some sleep?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Huh? Can you do that for me?<eos> -I promise.<eos> I will.
- Do you know what?<eos> I just remembered... she's at the library.<eos> Nancy, will you please have her call me as soon as you find her?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, I will.
Or...<eos> No, no, no.<eos> No. We don't need to do this.<eos> - No? If they come through that door...<eos> - They won't.
Now, forget about the months I spent writing.<eos> I'm talking about the years of my life squeezed down to their essence, the raw pulp of truth-- my truth in one transcendent narrative.<eos> Is that where the "whoroborus" came in?<eos> Keep pushing me, I'll quit.<eos> No, you won't.
You are the Destroyer, the Deliverer.<eos> Deliver us now.<eos> You said you would never hurt me!<eos> I haven't.<eos> I won't.
She is the wife no man ever wanted.<eos> Dr. Foster: You need to acquaint yourself - with current theories of...<eos> - I am well-acquainted, but I see no reason to put a hole in that man's head when what he needs is a kick in the ass back to the nearest battlefield.<eos> - Then allow me to do the procedure.<eos> - I will not.
Dr. Hale has a way of bringing out the best in me.<eos> He's prepared to submit this to the surgeon general.<eos> My contract's finished next week, sir.<eos> If you'll allow me to complete my term...<eos> I will not.
We're out of storage at work, and Frank just asked if I could keep some of it here.<eos> Just for a week or so.<eos> Rent's due tomorrow.<eos> Don't forget this month.<eos> I won't!
- Alright.<eos> - You know, I guess... Can you just ask her to call me back?<eos> OK.<eos> Why don't you just invite him to move in with us, hm?<eos> Maybe I will.
It's a luxury to relax every once in a while, isn't it, Garth?<eos> I remember this place... fondly.<eos> Look, the stability of this firm has never been in question.<eos> I need to look into Axelrod's eyes, hear him say it.<eos> Yeah, he will.
You're right. I live with my mother.<eos> But this is gonna work, and when it does, I'll have much, much more.<eos> And I'll give you a million.<eos> - I don't want your money.<eos> - I really will.
Uh, well, I... I haven't heard back from them.<eos> But this is an option, a really good one.<eos> I just want the best for you, baby.<eos> We'll make it without you...<eos> By the skin of our teeth, we will.
Who's it addressed to?<eos> Verizon.<eos> Those schmucks will think it's a prank.<eos> No.<eos> No, they won't.
He's hooked. Please, Mom. Talk like an adult.<eos> He has a crush on you and now he even thinks he has a job.<eos> First of all, a crush is not being in love.<eos> And secondly, tomorrow I'm telling him everything.<eos> Or I won't.
Don't rush me, I'm trying.<eos> And I'm nervous, what do you expect?<eos> You won't understand and you'll take it all the wrong way.<eos> I'll understand, no matter...<eos> No, you won't.
I would never.<eos> - Please pull out.<eos> Don't<eos> - Okay, - forget to pull out.<eos> - I won't.
Whitney Frost shot my wife.<eos> I'm coming with you.<eos> No, you're going back to the hospital.<eos> I want her to pay for what she did to us.<eos> And she will.
I...<eos> I heard every word he said, Gunnar, and it's not the last time I'm gonna hear them, but I'll be damned if I'm gonna spend every night post-show filing hate-crime reports when it's not gonna make a difference!<eos> You were attacked, and you cannot let him get away with that!<eos> Trust me.<eos> I won't.
Daphne, hey, hey, all right?<eos> Maddie made her choices, and that is not your responsibility.<eos> You did exactly what you should've done, all right?<eos> What if something bad happens?<eos> It won't.
You don't have to know how.<eos> Just have faith that you will.<eos> Well, we found our way back to each other, didn't we?<eos> Yes, we did.<eos> Sweetie, you will, too.
When did this happen, Drew?<eos> Chicago, right?<eos> October 17, 2014, at 6:31 p.m.<eos> I remember exactly.<eos> I always will.
Thank you for staying.<eos> I stayed because it was the right thing for my people.<eos> Our people.<eos> - If you betray me again...<eos> - I won't.
It's just unusual for pain to subside this quickly.<eos> Uh, so am I all clear?<eos> Apparently.<eos> Let Sinclair know that I said it was ok for you to go back to work, But you're benched again if I find anything abnormal in those tests.<eos> You won't.
I'll do anything.<eos> Walk through fire, battle demons, whatever it takes.<eos> I have to get my mom back.<eos> I can't... I won't lose her.<eos> You won't.
- No.<eos> - Well... can't I keep wearing it?<eos> Just let me wear it a little longer.<eos> - Don't forget.<eos> - I won't.
That's super fucked up.<eos> Oh, she's coming.<eos> I... I should go.<eos> All right, call me later.<eos> Okay, I will.
Is that so?<eos> - Yes, it is.<eos> Will you marry me?<eos> Will you become the world champion?<eos> Of course I will.
I think that would be a mistake, but it's not up to me.<eos> I'll talk to the people still at home.<eos> I'll discuss it with the people on guard now, too, but who else wants to approach the Saviors, talk to them first?<eos> What happened here, we won't let that happen again.<eos> I won't.
I love you all here.<eos> I do.<eos> And I'd have to kill for you.<eos> And I can't.<eos> I won't.
The professional damage, if you are convicted of even simple misdemeanor assault...<eos> The prick drove our kids drunk.<eos> He's the one who should be prosecuted.<eos> He can't really press charges 'cause Bobby popped him.<eos> He will.
I told you!<eos> Don't hurt my kids.<eos> Mom, she killed Dad!<eos> That won't hurt me.<eos> This will.
And he's been kind to you.<eos> Bountiful with the gore, he's been.<eos> I should like to meet him.<eos> You will.<eos> You all will.
Hey... do you want to go home?<eos> Do you want me to come with you?<eos> No.<eos> I want to find him.<eos> We will.
You were looking at her, and you need to stop.<eos> If Margot finds out...<eos> You know how she is, Ben.<eos> She'll kill both of you.<eos> No, she won't.
What's gonna happen to my sister?<eos> I know she has to answer for her crimes, but...<eos> Tell you what.<eos> I'll make you the same promise I made to Monty's mother, immunity from all past actions, but if she screws up again...<eos> Oh, she won't.
I wanted you both to be here when I did this.<eos> Lesley Ann Miller, will you marry me?<eos> Oh, wow, Carl, it's obviously too...<eos> Yes!<eos> - Yes, I will!
When my family was killed, I thought there was no way I could go on, but I did.<eos> The truth of our existence is that we're all blessed and cursed with the drive to move forward.<eos> Live the next day.<eos> To get better.<eos> And you will too, Sara.
I understand.<eos> Thank you for the past eight weeks.<eos> I've learned so much.<eos> I'll never forget my time here at "Everlasting."<eos> No one will!
Whatever code I have followed... I hereby disavow.<eos> If given the chance, I will shoot him in the back.<eos> And butcher all his kind.<eos> And when this one dies?<eos> So will we.
Lydia, I'm going to be erased, okay?<eos> Just like Alex.<eos> You're gonna forget me.<eos> I won't.<eos> No, I won't.
Just like Alex.<eos> You're gonna forget me.<eos> I won't.<eos> No, I won't.<eos> I won't.
You're gonna forget me.<eos> I won't.<eos> No, I won't.<eos> I won't.<eos> Lydia, you will.
- Why does the name sound like "pirate"?<eos> - Because pirates ate them.<eos> You're gonna be the world's best biologist.<eos> - I'd fucking love to come.<eos> - You will.
One day, an angel would float down from the sky... and save me.<eos> I think... that this was meant to be, Mary Cox.<eos> We were meant to find each other.<eos> Once you start to know The Ladder... all the pain, all the horrible things... that were done to you... they're gonna disappear.<eos> No, they won't.
- Yes!<eos> - Out of the cave? Yes!<eos> Would you let me lead you up out of the world of shadows?<eos> Yes!<eos> - Will you?
I don't want you to end up dead like me.<eos> We don't want that to happen to you.<eos> It's in your best interest to stay away.<eos> We don't want to hurt you... any of you.<eos> But we will.
- Gone.<eos> What do you want me to say, Sara?<eos> 30 years ago, you and Ray hopped on a spaceship,<eos> - and you never came back.<eos> - We will.
- Where are they?<eos> - Everywhere!<eos> Will you forget me?<eos> I won't...<eos> I won't!
Not to mention stupid.<eos> I...<eos> I can't let you owe Darhk a favor.<eos> And I can't let you die.<eos> I won't.
We're clear.<eos> At least there's no signs of the bees.<eos> Go!<eos> Looks like your green friend didn't forget about you.<eos> Never will.
Before I kill whoever is left on this island, before I become worse than Reiter, please.<eos> Please don't ask me to do this.<eos> If you ever cared for me, then you would do this.<eos> Don't forget your promise.<eos> I won't.
"Get out." Heh heh heh.<eos> This heartwarming display would mean a whole lot more had I not just seen you all tearing yourselves and your city apart.<eos> That is why I did this.<eos> Humanity is feckless, and I wanted to cleanse it of a millennia worth of rot it has been infected by, and I will do it!<eos> No, you won't.
I spent my whole life preparing to die in 1944.<eos> I never thought I'd want to stay, to have a life and a child.<eos> Why did you kill the Crawfords?<eos> You won't understand.<eos> But he will.
Everyone once believed in something ... Then everything changed. To people It became necessary to earn money<eos> And they forgot about Communism.<eos> Now, thank God, there is in that believe!<eos> Here you pyzhishsya, angry all And you think that we will become nervous.<eos> We will not!
The shooting?<eos> Think so.<eos> Well, you know, if you think of anything new... .. doesn't matter if you don't think it's important, you must tell me.<eos> Because it might not make sense to you, but it might make sense to me.<eos> I will.
Damn it, Fitz.<eos> Your friends are very persistent.<eos> They keep fighting us, forcing us to move, wasting valuable time.<eos> If it happens again, there'll be no absolution.<eos> It won't.
And I didn't tell you because, um...<eos> Because I knew that you would try to talk me out of it.<eos> I knew it.<eos> And I will not be talked out of this, Val.<eos> I will not.
I love Los Angeles, don't you?<eos> Ms. Savvy has an apartment at the Park Plaza, and Shive is there.<eos> - I'm on my way now.<eos> - I'll come with you.<eos> No, you will not.
But they're never gonna know that unless you've got their attention.<eos> And this is how you get the world's attention.<eos> My parents are gonna see that tape.<eos> - Tyler's parents...<eos> - No, they won't.
The Kurtwell case, Holy Father.<eos> The big hot potato.<eos> Exactly, Holy Father.<eos> Your predecessor didn't have time to put someone in charge of this delicate matter.<eos> But I will.
Oh, don't worry, Madame Prime Minister. I'm not asking you for anything for our small community in Greenland.<eos> I just wanted to remind you that we Catholics were there first.<eos> Everyone else is a guest.<eos> I don't want you to forget that.<eos> - I won't, Holy Father.
I don't know.<eos> You can be certain that it won't just be me asking those questions.<eos> Did you find your day book?<eos> - Not yet.<eos> But I will.
Please?<eos> Tschichatschow.<eos> Would you like to tell us about yourself, where you're from?<eos> I don't care.<eos> Okay, fine, I will then.
Marcel has them set to tear apart the city to find you, but after a brief chat, he's considered an alternative.<eos> Though I think it might be worse.<eos> He wants you to come back here and stand trial for your sins.<eos> Before a jury of those who hate me the most?<eos> Like hell I will.
Asa knows what he's doing.<eos> He's the only one that can do it.<eos> Now's not the time for questioning... unless it's directed at our so-called Bren'in.<eos> Asa cares about the clan, our future.<eos> More than big Foster ever will.
She don't just want you gone, she wants you dead.<eos> Okay?<eos> Now you say goodbye.<eos> I love you.<eos> I always will.
Are... are you there, Norman?<eos> - Yes, I'm here.<eos> - I'll... I'll bring it.<eos> And will, uh, the sheriff, your stepfather, be joining us as well?<eos> No... no, he will not.
- And where'd you get that?<eos> During my surveillance of the Downworlders.<eos> From what I hear, Magnus likes to party.<eos> He'll never go for it. Not with Valentine trying to kill him.<eos> Of course he will.
You're his parabatai, his brother.<eos> I know.<eos> If he could do this to you... we have to stop him.<eos> Once you get better.<eos> I won't.
A regular life.<eos> And today...<eos> I almost tore my mother apart.<eos> What if I do that to you?<eos> - Simon, you won't.
- One batch, two batch.<eos> Penny and dime.<eos> They're gonna pay.<eos> Every single goddamn one of 'em.<eos> They will.
Then why would he lie about it?<eos> Blame the tequila.<eos> He had motive and opportunity.<eos> Look, I just want to make sure that you're punishing the right person.<eos> I will.
The best part is it's on me!<eos> Come peacefully.<eos> We'll go to the station...<eos> No.<eos> We won't.
- Bit weird, having a stranger in the house.<eos> - But Albert, with a circular saw, is OK? - Hmm.<eos> What's up?<eos> It just doesn't really feel like a fresh start, does it?<eos> It will.
- But Albert, with a circular saw, is OK? - Hmm.<eos> What's up?<eos> It just doesn't really feel like a fresh start, does it?<eos> It will.<eos> It will.
You're the one putting us at risk.<eos> Being around humans.<eos> One slip, and you'll give us away.<eos> Someone'll see through the dumb synth act.<eos> No, they won't.
Yeah, I know about these places.<eos> My friend Kiara was in one of them.<eos> Then why aren't you saying anything about it?<eos> I...<eos> I will.
Yeah, I know.<eos> It just won't be the same.<eos> I'm not sure I understand why he's going.<eos> Because... because his dad just doesn't get it.<eos> And he never will.
- I love you, too.<eos> Well, that was a 180.<eos> Maybe she's read the research?<eos> Did you... Did you read any of the articles that I sent you?<eos> No, but I will.
Well, that was a 180.<eos> Maybe she's read the research?<eos> Did you... Did you read any of the articles that I sent you?<eos> No, but I will.<eos> I will.
This my personal number.<eos> Call me as soon as you know something.<eos> Thank you, Bob.<eos> I can't believe Mr. Desai thought he could get away with this.<eos> He won't.
He is formless.<eos> That much we understand.<eos> What does that mean?<eos> He has not yet taken another body.<eos> But he will?
She's a hologram.<eos> And I think Garret is, too.<eos> So where is the real Garret?<eos> "These things will kill you."<eos> "Not me they won't."
You know, this time, but the fact is, she is hurt right now because of me.<eos> I wasn't fast enough to protect Iris just from some meta-human tonight.<eos> When Zoom attacks again, I need all of my speed and then some.<eos> I can't lose anyone else.<eos> You won't.
Aura.<eos> Aura?<eos> Yeah, we can't get in there.<eos> I know the bouncer.<eos> Yes, we will.
I wanted to fuck her.<eos> I thought she needed a little incentive to go behind your back.<eos> If you wanted to fuck, all you had to do was ask.<eos> I'd have said yes.<eos> I will next time.
I wrote this for my parents and Dante.<eos> If I don't come back, make sure he gets them.<eos> Cisco, you're coming back.<eos> Caitlin, please.<eos> Okay, I will.
ONE SPICY STEP AHEAD OF YOU.<eos> ENTER THE SERRANO PEPPER!<eos> CHI-CAW!<eos> NO ONE WILL KNOW THE DIFFERENCE.<eos> I WILL.
It's just...<eos> Back in the real world, I am going back to debt and custody battles... and... keeping my chemistry in line, and God knows what else.<eos> You shouldn't have to deal with the responsibilities in my crazy life.<eos> Yeah, okay, - what if I want to?<eos> - You won't.
This virus?<eos> It isn't smart or elegant.<eos> It's just brutal and short-sighted,<eos> - and it doesn't deserve to win.<eos> - And it won't.
I am...<eos> I'm a new lady.<eos> I am who you see before you.<eos> Do you promise you'll help me?<eos> Of course he will.
There is nothing wrong with you, and you are not crazy.<eos> But you probably won't find the love of your life in three days on Shaggr in Los Angeles.<eos> What if I'm screwing up everything?<eos> What if I never find anyone again?<eos> Of course you will.
- When were you gonna let me know?<eos> - I just did.<eos> His parents are gonna be there.<eos> You can call them.<eos> Oh, I will.
- He won't hit you.<eos> They won't even think it's a big deal.<eos> I promise.<eos> I guess if you could actually get Harry and Joss' blessing...<eos> - Which I will...
She's my mother.<eos> And she's sick.<eos> I need you to give it a chance.<eos> Fine.<eos> Fine, I will...
Unfortunately, your salary will be deferred, and your 20% investment is also frozen.<eos> Are you serious?<eos> I mean you do realize that I put my entire future in your hands.<eos> - If this doesn't work out...<eos> - It will.
I need a minute alone to finish dressing.<eos> Do you mind?<eos> Of course not.<eos> Let me know when Adam gets here.<eos> I will.
Huh? Prisoners, separate.<eos> Well, you heard the man.<eos> See you later.<eos> Yes.<eos> You will.
You mean you want me to join the cult?<eos> I know it might seem dangerous, and it's a lot to ask.<eos> Well, why didn't you just say so?<eos> - I'll join.<eos> - You will?
Bartholomew. Mm.<eos> And if I'm there with Bartholomew and... and you're there alone, you'll be horribly embarrassed.<eos> Well, how very considerate.<eos> So you won't be attending?<eos> I will not.
It's been months.<eos> Can't you forgive me by now for what happened to the baby?<eos> No!<eos> I don't forgive you.<eos> And I never will.
- How is he gonna manage me from there?<eos> - His work is wherever I say it is.<eos> And Ben is a loyal follower who doesn't ask questions of me.<eos> But Ben promised The Circle would make me a star just like Peri.<eos> And we will, even without him.
Exactly.<eos> Which means she can reject it.<eos> I can't push the hearing again.<eos> Do I have to subpoena Annalise?<eos> - 'Cause I will.
Who does that?<eos> Not to say that I can't see the other side of it.<eos> How do you know he won't go out and kill again?<eos> You don't.<eos> He probably will.
How do you know he's not gonna leave again?<eos> I don't.<eos> But you live to be as old as I am and see if you don't eat a cupcake when it's placed before you.<eos> It's a little above your head, but you'll get used to it.<eos> I won't.
Pop, pop!<eos> Come on, now.<eos> Whoo-hoo-hoo! Y'all better watch out.<eos> She's gonna want to kill me, too.<eos> She won't.
You don't know that.<eos> I do.<eos> 'Cause I'm the one she'd ask to do it.<eos> Tell me you're not gonna do anything stupid.<eos> I won't.
Take him to the spice shop.<eos> We're on our way.<eos> And if he tries anything...<eos> Don't worry.<eos> He won't.
And?<eos> He got away, but I'll find him.<eos> Later.<eos> He needs to pay for what he did to my brother!<eos> And he will.
You know how I am with mess, Oscar.<eos> Yes, I do.<eos> What if she won't take me back?<eos> She was very upset.<eos> Of course she will.
Your Royal Highness.<eos> For you, sir.<eos> They're going to send you away, but I won't let them.<eos> I'm going to tell my mother not to send you.<eos> I won't.
- No, it doesn't matter.<eos> It doesn't matter.<eos> Nothing like that happens again, all right?<eos> Yeah.<eos> It won't.
You'll need a partner.<eos> Nimah Amin.<eos> I trust her.<eos> You'll have 10 minutes with the asset, so ask the right questions.<eos> I will.
The money for Sistemics is gone, so we have to find another way in.<eos> Well, they already scheduled my intake meeting.<eos> I'll use my own money.<eos> No, they'll trace it back to you.<eos> No, they won't.
This will pass.<eos> And what if it doesn't, Drew?<eos> What if it gets worse?<eos> You got lucky today.<eos> Someday, you won't.
No, you didn't, and I'm...<eos> It was a wonderful evening.<eos> You brag how you make all your millions, that you can help my family with our transfer of money.<eos> I can.<eos> And I will.
Milo?<eos> Yeah, he's fine.<eos> He's great, mm-hmm.<eos> Yeah, he was actually saying I should-I should, um, I should bring you down here, right?<eos> And I will.
Yeah, he's fine.<eos> He's great, mm-hmm.<eos> Yeah, he was actually saying I should-I should, um, I should bring you down here, right?<eos> And I will.<eos> Of course, I will.
You're so lucky.<eos> I wish...<eos> I wish I could have a family like this.<eos> It'll happen.<eos> No, it won't.
And now so does your chance at redemption.<eos> Whatever happens to me was worth it.<eos> This box is as empty as your pursuit.<eos> I pray it stays that way.<eos> It won't.
Go.<eos> She'll be fine.<eos> You know better than anyone, they can't break in there.<eos> What if they figure out the code?<eos> - They won't.
Your mother found the letter and then... and then lost it, and then she showed it to me after she'd followed you, Charlie.<eos> I...<eos> I'm sorry, Mom.<eos> I-I just wanted to know what she was like.<eos> Oh. And because of me, now you never will.
And you expect me to be grateful for this feeble trickle of coins?<eos> I'm a gentleman.<eos> I will honour my debts.<eos> A gentleman would pay what is owed in full.<eos> I will, in time.
To let him repay the debt when the mood takes him, is that it?<eos> With respect, sir, that's not what Ms Barbary suggested.<eos> With respect to you, sir, it's what she intimates with her plea, that I should have her father released before a penny of the debt is repaid.<eos> We will repay your debt in full, sir, I swear it.<eos> Of course you will.
No, look at me.<eos> Look at me!<eos> Now, listen.<eos> You are not going to die, I won't let it happen.<eos> I simply won't!
And he wasn't too eager to take his chances in front of a jury again.<eos> Any evidence you have is circumstantial at best.<eos> That's okay by me.<eos> If we keep digging...<eos> And we will...
Will do.<eos> You got to take care of Mommy while I'm gone.<eos> Here.<eos> You better come back.<eos> I will.
Agreed.<eos> Even if we split up.<eos> Does that mean we're together?<eos> You will tell me.<eos> I will.
I'm afraid your brother might not be joining us.<eos> I can see him through Zolo's eyes. Burning, burning in the desert sun.<eos> We might smell his ashes in the wind.<eos> It's too bad you won't be seeing Amaru's true beauty.<eos> But I will... through your eyes.
To stop a plague like Santanico, you can't just destroy the source.<eos> You have to incinerate every single soul she's infected.<eos> Yo, man, how 'bout you suck my...<eos> La Diosa... will save me...<eos> No, she won't.
(breath trembling) First, they destroy our leaders.<eos> Now they're going after our faith.<eos> (sobbing) He said La Diosa was a plague.<eos> La Diosa... will save me...<eos> No, she won't.
It's never gonna fucking work.<eos> So you're saying I can't pull it off?<eos> No, she took you back because she thought that you was clean.<eos> As soon as she finds out that you got back in the game, she gonna turn you in.<eos> No, she won't.
Everything doesn't need to be talked about.<eos> Okay.<eos> Yeah, I understand.<eos> So another time you will call me, and we'll go out.<eos> But you won't, will you?
If we can find the right frequency, I believe we can open the door to the other side.<eos> It was my understanding you had already made contact.<eos> I did. I did.<eos> However, I was unable to replicate my results.<eos> But I will.
You have no proof of anything.<eos> I don't need proof.<eos> Because while she may be in Argentina now, she's not gonna stay there forever, which means when she gets back, I get you for witness tampering.<eos> Do me a favor and leave me the hell alone.<eos> I will.
That you'd never be able to live with yourself.<eos> You go finish law school, okay?<eos> And you pass the bar, and you become a lawyer, and then... in two years when I get out, if you still want to marry me...<eos> Oh, I will.<eos> Of course I will.
But you're giving her away.<eos> For what?<eos> A business deal that will never hold?<eos> A war that will never end?<eos> Oh, it will.
Shut it down.<eos> - Wait, who the hell are these guys?<eos> - We can't be late.<eos> We gotta find them.<eos> Yeah, and we will, just not now.
It will, it will.<eos> We just...<eos> We have to practice and cover everything.<eos> Well, w-what if they don't believe me?<eos> They will.
No one can hear us.<eos> Someone saw him take me.<eos> You can be red this time.<eos> They're gonna find us.<eos> No, they won't.
Someone saw him take me.<eos> You can be red this time.<eos> They're gonna find us.<eos> No, they won't.<eos> Yes, they will.
- No recap needed.<eos> I was there.<eos> Just try getting in touch, - see if she responds to you.<eos> - Uh, hello?<eos> Of course she will.
- Yeah?<eos> "Stay out of sight"?<eos> This is my fault.<eos> I got to fix this.<eos> And we will, Simon.
You don't want to know.<eos> All right, I mean it. Just... just... just don't read it, okay?<eos> Okay.<eos> So he'll help you out.<eos> He will.
Witch.<eos> Well, shit.<eos> John, John, John... didn't I blow you up with a motorbike?<eos> Yeah, well, it didn't take.<eos> This one will.
Husband.<eos> Ah, a husband.<eos> Well... it would appear a better man than I has won.<eos> But I am in port quite often... should that ever change.<eos> It... it won't.
- Get in the truck!<eos> Come on!<eos> You know what to do.<eos> S, they can't find anything.<eos> They won't.
Don't be a hater.<eos> Now you're really scaring me.<eos> Where's your sense of adventure, Scott?<eos> I just want you to find a cure.<eos> We will.
I want to work with Sarah Manning and the others to restore you as the head of Neolution.<eos> Are you sure you can work with Sarah?<eos> I look forward to it.<eos> I just want you to find a cure.<eos> We will.
Kendra's from there.<eos> You got to find her before they do.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Okay.<eos> We will.
Oh, that's brilliant!<eos> Well, I fly out of here tomorrow, so I can be there by Thursday.<eos> My agent's number.<eos> Call her and check.<eos> We will.
You shouldn't go.<eos> But I can't stop you.<eos> They'll see you.<eos> No.<eos> They won't.
I left her there with them.<eos> Pieces of her children all around her.<eos> You're right.<eos> You deserve to die.<eos> And I will.
I need you to tell her that I'm alive. Ok?<eos> And that I'm searching for her.<eos> And that I will find her.<eos> Ok?<eos> I will.
And when you get back, I'll be here.<eos> - okay.<eos> - I love you, Barry.<eos> - I love you too.<eos> And I always will.
You did not tell me about that.<eos> The hell are you talking about, Golda?<eos> You have microphones, I'm sure, and I know better than to say anything incriminating.<eos> Instead, I will walk away.<eos> You will, too.
Connor's pretty serious about his procedures.<eos> - If I got caught--<eos> - We won't.<eos> We won't get caught.<eos> We won't.
Winston Churchill lost.<eos> So plenty of presidents have lost and gone on to do great, great things.<eos> Are we done, sweetie?<eos> - I can't fucking lose this thing.<eos> - You won't.
So plenty of presidents have lost and gone on to do great, great things.<eos> Are we done, sweetie?<eos> - I can't fucking lose this thing.<eos> - You won't.<eos> You won't.
- Yeah, they won't care.<eos> All they'll know is that they're getting higher faster.<eos> And that's the magic.<eos> - But if they suspect--<eos> - They won't.
Focus on what's in the here and now.<eos> I am.<eos> Ofelia chose to go.<eos> She didn't think we were gonna make it.<eos> We will.
They have art there.<eos> They have that lady that paints bikinis on the girls.<eos> Yeah, I'm so stoked.<eos> And I promise this time I'm not gonna oversleep and miss it.<eos> You probably will.
I thought you might like to do it.<eos> I don't think that I'm the guy to get up and talk about Dad.<eos> Maybe Erin or Shane.<eos> If you change your mind...<eos> I won't.
Jesus is my savior.<eos> Who is your Lord?<eos> Jesus is Lord.<eos> Do you promise to live as follower of the Holy Spirit?<eos> I will.
Which means she doesn't have long.<eos> Your sister wasn't his target.<eos> Well, maybe that doesn't mean anything to him.<eos> -We have to find her.<eos> -And we will.
So...<eos> How do you feel?<eos> It felt like... Just another kill.<eos> It didn't bring my parents back.<eos> Nothing will.
It's the first time I've ever done this.<eos> Well, how do we know if it works?<eos> Supposedly, the mask is just gonna come off and be released from the possessed and return to its natural form, I think.<eos> Well, what if it takes, like, hours?<eos> It won't.
Don't rush, darling.<eos> It'll take him an hour to get to the front door.<eos> And then an hour to get through the bloody thing!<eos> Now, don't forget the two things we discussed.<eos> - I won't.
Cuff him.<eos> Now, I know the rest of you are all law-abiding citizens who don't violate children, Let's go, move.<eos> so we'd appreciate it if you'd step aside so we can escort Mr. Nunez out of here.<eos> This is crazy, and it'll never stand up.<eos> Of course it will.
Oh, no. It worked out, 'cause, apparently, she was buying 'em for you.<eos> Who wants a cookie?<eos> Bonnie.<eos> Ooh, I'll have a cookie.<eos> No, I won't.
So the cognitive therapy--<eos> It's going well.<eos> I've been symptom-free.<eos> I just...got nervous, and it won't happen again.<eos> It won't.
Well, that does create quite a conundrum.<eos> If I spare your life, then you'll never cease trying to end mine.<eos> Oh, I have another solution.<eos> I will not kill your father.<eos> You will.
Be fair and alphabetically.<eos> You should go first since your name is Kang Mo Yeon.<eos> The person that wants to hear it should go first though.<eos> Nope. It's ladies first.<eos> If not then it will by age.
Let's go, Nicky, we're done here.<eos> Wait, Mom...<eos> No.<eos> I'll make a statement.<eos> No, you won't.
Out the way!<eos> This is it.<eos> We're going to die.<eos> Richard, stand behind me.<eos> I will not.
I gave you an estimate.<eos> Use the original.<eos> Borns Tech has it.<eos> We haven't found it yet in the discovery,<eos> - but we will.
What the hell just happened?<eos> How did it just explode like that?<eos> It must have been trying to tell us something important.<eos> Now we'll never know.<eos> Sure we will.

Adopted from China last year.<eos> And she loves it.<eos> But, again, it's our song.<eos> And we have to warn you, Rowby, that, um, we'll be pulling your video off-line.<eos> No, you won't.
Diane does?<eos> Well, she understands the situation.<eos> Thank you, but I'm not interested.<eos> If you change your mind...<eos> I won't.
- What?<eos> - Oh, yes, ma'am.<eos> - They can do that?<eos> - Of course they can.<eos> And they will.
- Yeah, I'm on it.<eos> We need that ID.<eos> Hi.<eos> Did you find them?<eos> Not yet, but we will.
Of course.<eos> Type in your number.<eos> This is more than a job to me.<eos> If something happens to Carlos...<eos> Nothing will.
If nothing else, Daddy's killer got what she deserved.<eos> You must not tell the inspector this.<eos> Why not?<eos> At least if I confess to killing the woman, Mummy and Grandpa will be let go because Inspector Mallory will know who really murdered my father. - Yes.<eos> Yes, he will.
What are you doing?<eos> Getting Alexander's things for him.<eos> Stop it.<eos> He'll need them.<eos> He won't, Ian.
Oh, I put it here in your front pocket.<eos> Oh, cool, there's never room there when I wear it.<eos> See, Max, I knew he'd call you.<eos> - Well, he said he would.<eos> - And he will.
Shall we take him on my balcony and set him free?<eos> I'd love that.<eos> You know, after this, it's just gonna be the two of us again.<eos> Maybe we'll finally get that happy ending after all.<eos> I will... we will.
Siobhan Kelly, the patient at his urgent care center...<eos> He suggested you check truck stops outside of Gary.<eos> - I'll loop in Voight.<eos> - And he may know more, but he's not going to say anything until he's transferred.<eos> Of course he won't.
Captain, nice to finally meet you.<eos> You're a bit of a legend around these parts.<eos> Recruits have been gunning for your records since I got here five years ago.<eos> So far, no one's gotten close.<eos> Yeah, well, they will.
That's me off.<eos> See you when you're back from the tour in... 23 weeks.<eos> - Well, call me if you need anything.<eos> - Yes.<eos> You won't, of course.
You couldn't pick up a phone? You couldn't write a letter?<eos> Did you ever stop to think how that would feel to her?<eos> I...<eos> I have a lot to explain.<eos> And I will.
- so crazy...<eos> - Saying things like "I have been so crazy."<eos> - I'll call you later?<eos> - Saying things like "I'll call you later."<eos> I really will.
Honestly, I just...<eos> I have to go.<eos> Right, well, I'll, uh... let you get on with it, then.<eos> Bloody hell.<eos> No, I won't, will I?
He needs you.<eos> Yeah. Yeah, I get it.<eos> Ah... Well, we'll-we'll figure it out once this huntress thing is over.<eos> Yes.<eos> We will.
That information will help us find you.<eos> But, Avery, I would have to drop the switch.<eos> - I mean, wouldn't that kill me?<eos> - No.<eos> No, Grace, it won't.
I got lucky.<eos> You were smack in the middle.<eos> You owe yourself some time.<eos> I can't go away for a month.<eos> I won't.
To watch your brother's fight from his little shit box apartment in Boyle Heights.<eos> Hector means something to these people.<eos> He's an icon.<eos> Now, you think little Chico is going to be able to process all the things that you want to spout off about?<eos> He won't.
And then what?<eos> You know what.<eos> You know, she actually does look a lot like her.<eos> What if he gets the drop on you?<eos> He won't.
I really ruined both our Valentine's.<eos> You know what? You really did.<eos> You have no idea how much.<eos> Well, maybe when I... get back to the Island in a couple days, you'll let me make it up to you.<eos> Maybe I will.
I'm not the one that ordered all the phones to be ripped out down here.<eos> Hades.<eos> Well, with all you heroes running around, the place he feels has a little too much hope bubbling up in his realm.<eos> Well, you can tell him it's gonna take a lot more than ripping out phones to discourage us.<eos> I will.
I couldn't lose you to Zelena.<eos> Well, yeah, but I almost lost you.<eos> You didn't.<eos> You came back for me.<eos> I always will.
But you will have to find someone else.<eos> It is Albert's destiny to marry Victoria.<eos> I'm not sure Victoria agrees.<eos> And she is the one who has to propose.<eos> And she will.
- Okay. Second, I have a gun in my purse, so no.<eos> Okay, just come to the Haunted Hester party with us tonight.<eos> We can all hang out. Thanks, but I'm live-tweeting my trick-or-treaters, so if you'll excuse me, I'm on the clock for sundown.<eos> Well, if you change your mind...<eos> I won't.
There is something that he does.<eos> Really bothers me.<eos> I wish he didn't have to work so much.<eos> But don't tell him that.<eos> I won't.
Let me go.<eos> - Let me go.<eos> - What do you mean?<eos> I won't let you go!<eos> I won't!
No, it's not okay.<eos> I mean, when I said "I thought a lot about things," I thought a lot about things so, um...<eos> How about dinner?<eos> Okay, I'll call you.<eos> No, you won't.
I mean, when I said "I thought a lot about things," I thought a lot about things so, um...<eos> How about dinner?<eos> Okay, I'll call you.<eos> No, you won't.<eos> No, you won't...
- Kristi will testify.<eos> You sure you want to walk into a court with an online ranter as your only witness?<eos> I can talk to her again, See if she's up for it.<eos> You know what?<eos> We both will.
He did it for me.<eos> Michelle, this is gonna be very hard.<eos> But you will be okay.<eos> And, eventually... eventually you'll get back to normal.<eos> No, I won't.
I'm just tying up loose ends.<eos> Boring cop shit.<eos> Okay.<eos> Well, remind me not to become a boring cop.<eos> I will.
Me, too.<eos> And what I said was changing effective police policy without regard to the fallout is "dangerously ignorant."<eos> You didn't think the Speaker could read between the lines?<eos> I never attached a name to it.<eos> Well, I will.
At least you were nicer than you were to Anthony Bourdain.<eos> Bourdain parked in Sookie's spot.<eos> Now once again, we have an empty kitchen.<eos> We will find a full-time chef.<eos> - No, we won't.
Bourdain parked in Sookie's spot.<eos> Now once again, we have an empty kitchen.<eos> We will find a full-time chef.<eos> - No, we won't.<eos> - Yes, we will.
- We want cake!<eos> - Coming.<eos> Take it.<eos> Who's gonna help me light the candles?<eos> - I will, I will!
- It's been quiet regarding the blowup.<eos> - I've been busy.<eos> - You should call her.<eos> - De-ice this situation.<eos> - I will.
This is uncharted territory.<eos> If it might help, what's the harm?<eos> - I'll think about it.<eos> - Okay. But really consider it.<eos> - I will.
- Thanks, Jim. Denise.<eos> Have a good day.<eos> - You, too.<eos> - Don't lose the card.<eos> - I won't.
- Listen, just leave it up to me.<eos> You guys go back into the living room, and I'll call you when it's ready.<eos> Well, Damon, it's a very impressive résumé.<eos> And here are my references, in case you need them.<eos> Oh, we will.
Maestro, my hero.<eos> She's here.<eos> She appears to be happy. She's ready to rehearse.<eos> We will have a great concert, an historic event.<eos> Yes, Beppi, we will, we will.
Mr. Wood, please.<eos> Give me another chance.<eos> No, give me another chance.<eos> I will find Phillip's killer.<eos> She won't.
- Norman.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> Have you told Dr. Edwards your wishes?<eos> Not yet.<eos> I will.
I'm going home.<eos> - Seriously?<eos> - Yep.<eos> Dr. Edwards sign off on your paperwork yet?<eos> He will.
- Seriously?<eos> - Yep.<eos> Dr. Edwards sign off on your paperwork yet?<eos> He will.<eos> No, he won't.
Romero still there?<eos> No.<eos> He moved out.<eos> You... you haven't told Norman about him yet.<eos> I will, honey.
A white wine as well.<eos> Our lawyer, Bram Keller... He thinks that this trial could be as important as Scopes.<eos> Didn't Scopes lose?<eos> He did. Yes.<eos> But we won't.
You know as well as I do the world of sexual therapy is exploding. It's changing by the minute.<eos> Bill and Virginia are trying to hold on to something that is already slipping from their grasp.<eos> That's absurd.<eos> And it won't work, what you're trying to do.<eos> Of course it will.
You can do this, Jackson.<eos> April, what if I can't?<eos> What if I make her worse?<eos> This woman's counting on me, and I promised that I could help.<eos> Then you will.
We had a deal.<eos> I need another month.<eos> One more month, and I get my diploma.<eos> Also, one more round of chemo, and then they take my headphone jack out.<eos> And then I will.
They let you go!<eos> Finally.<eos> Now I must go to Caroline.<eos> Pray God she'll understand.<eos> Of course she will.
I believe so.<eos> I wonder she does not remarry.<eos> A husband could offer her more protection.<eos> He could.<eos> And he will.
Answers you want-- I've seen a lot of grieving people chase the same thing.<eos> And they chase it... right down the rabbit hole.<eos> That's a dark place to be.<eos> I don't want that to happen to you.<eos> It won't.
No. No, no.<eos> No pity!<eos> I forbid it!<eos> I will not let you pity me!<eos> I will not!
You did it last year.<eos> It's your head that's the problem.<eos> You need the adrenaline of the race.<eos> You'll qualify for sure.<eos> Yeah, of course he will.
How many more kids are you going to dump on us?<eos> I thought you liked rusty.<eos> I do, but that's the problem.<eos> He is an enormous emotional distraction. You think julio's priorities will change?<eos> Well, of course they will,
I think that we have been trapped in this land for far too long.<eos> It's time that we found ourselves a home.<eos> And so... I shall allow the doctor to go through with his plan, but I'm going to make one small alteration.<eos> The doctor isn't the only one who will be going to this Storybrooke.<eos> We all will.
Okay.<eos> Okay, this obviously didn't go the way that I planned, but nothing about us has.<eos> I love you.<eos> And that is one thing that has not changed.<eos> And it never will.
It sucked.<eos> Especially for a guy like you, who likes to talk so much.<eos> So, you can either tell me what you know... or I'll walk out of here, and I will not come back with wine.<eos> I just won't come back.<eos> Nobody will.
Well, uh, it was good to meet you, Bonnie.<eos> You too.<eos> Why don't you keep that plaque?<eos> Don't look like nobody else gonna want it.<eos> Maybe I will.
- Hi.<eos> You've been in here a while.<eos> Yeah, I'm, I'm just trying to figure out what these medications do.<eos> I really think we need to talk about what happened this morning.<eos> We will.
I was thinking...<eos> Flashpoint.<eos> So you don't want this?<eos> You may have figured out a way to dampen my speed with this glass cage, but I will get out of here and I will destroy your life, Flash, one way or the other.<eos> No, you won't.
And our sober interactions have been pretty terrible.<eos> If you really mean that...<eos> If you really want me to walk away...<eos> Say the words...<eos> I will.
Here's the key to first days, amy. Fit in.<eos> You'll be happier.<eos> You always say that.<eos> I just want you to succeed this time.<eos> I will.
But it's clear whatever you and Strange did to her is making her sick.<eos> Her people are stealing drugs.<eos> But I don't think they're working.<eos> She's gonna come after you.<eos> Or her goons will.
He took our money.<eos> All that money that's been coming in from you and Jack... he took it, ran off to Florida with some woman he met a month ago.<eos> Let's get to a meeting right now.<eos> I need to make things right.<eos> You will... we will.
Just --<eos> Sorry.<eos> I saw you flirting, and I got jealous, so I told him...to back off.<eos> It won't happen again.<eos> No, it will.
No.<eos> 'Cause I miss you, too.<eos> ...She won't notice.<eos> It's Michaela.<eos> Of course she will.
You can always come to me.<eos> You know that.<eos> She won't notice.<eos> It's Michaela.<eos> Of course she will.
Of course I'm worried.<eos> In the past, she's been almost invincible.<eos> I mean, I saw her come back from the dead that time she was blasted out the airlock, but that was because of her Nanites.<eos> And now instead of saving her, they're gonna kill her.<eos> No, they won't.
I'm here for the Drive.<eos> I'm sure you have someone on board who'll be able to confirm it's genuine.<eos> I gave you the device.<eos> I held up my end of the deal.<eos> And so will I.
35 compartments.<eos> So either I miscalculated or-- Captain Hunter had a secret compartment he failed to tell you about.<eos> Gideon, please pull up the schematics of the ship.<eos> No, we still have to fix the time drive.<eos> And we will.
Caitlin!<eos> Really?<eos> You brought your toys?<eos> I'm hoping it won't come to that.<eos> It won't.
That's it.<eos> I think that's what's called being in charge.<eos> Heh. The truth is, you're all this city has, so...however you go about your business, just keep doing it the right way.<eos> Even if it takes longer to get the job done, you'll know, and so will the city.<eos> Will they?
She didn't mention it.<eos> Maybe because you didn't ask nicely.<eos> No need walking us out.<eos> You want to tell me what this is about?<eos> Yeah, I will.
I just, uh...<eos> - I know you're Super Callie but this business with Kyle, this is not your problem.<eos> I know.<eos> I just want you to take care of yourself.<eos> I will.
Look at you!<eos> Can't believe he did it.<eos> You know? It's one of those things that you talk about for years and years and years, and then it finally happens, and... and...<eos> I have to find a way to pay for it.<eos> We will.
- I will.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> - Do it now.<eos> - No, I'll do it later.<eos> No, you won't.
- Thanks.<eos> Would you also consider donating to help<eos> Kyle Snow get a fair trial?<eos> He was wrongly convicted of murder.<eos> No, I won't.
- They were in a plane crash together.<eos> - You'll be fine.<eos> You're just saying that 'cause you like me.<eos> Today's the day I lose all my friends.<eos> - You won't.
- Do?<eos> - Well, yeah.<eos> - You can't just stay like this.<eos> - Oh, I can stay like this.<eos> And I will.
How late do you think you'll be?<eos> Wish I knew.<eos> Uh, I made some chicken earlier.<eos> I'll... I'll leave it in the fridge for you.<eos> Oh, no you will not.
And we will respectfully disagree with her.<eos> A lot of good will come of this.<eos> Dontrell Tariq will go to prison because of this.<eos> Yeah, well, it won't bring my cousin back.<eos> No, it won't.
Says you.<eos> Boss, those cops look forward to this night all year.<eos> You take this away from them, it'll have lasting effects, bad ones.<eos> They'll get over it.<eos> No, they won't.
Yeah.<eos> I need to find that bastard, Strange.<eos> Yeah, well, you know I can't help you with that.<eos> Yes, you can.<eos> And... you will.
I'm not killing anyone.<eos> Yes, you will!<eos> Now pick up the pistol and fire!<eos> You want to show me who I really am, then show me.<eos> Oh, I will.
That just means he was in there.<eos> It puts him at the scene.<eos> Listen, I've been thinking. You got to tell Barnes what Symon said.<eos> Give him the right to defend himself.<eos> I will.
Our paths weren't meant to cross just yet.<eos> But I'm not gonna kill you yet.<eos> I do that, you become the martyr, and she'll carry you in her heart forever.<eos> Before I kill you, she has to hate you.<eos> And she will.
Thanks to you.<eos> Remember, it's not Damon.<eos> This is Damon under the control of a she-devil.<eos> And we have to find a way to break her control.<eos> And we will.
Please, Elliot?<eos> One week!<eos> We'll try it for one week!<eos> - But if she does anything...<eos> - She won't!
He wanted to destroy you.<eos> I begged him not to.<eos> I asked him to send you to hell instead.<eos> I did it because I love you, son.<eos> And I always will.
I think he did it. You two realize that if you confess to this crime, there's a good chance you both will go to jail?<eos> Whatever we face, we face together.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> The one of you who didn't do it, you'll lose everything.<eos> No, we won't.
Oh?<eos> Okay.<eos> Um, but...it's a weird'un.<eos> If you guys need anything at all, I'm --<eos> We won't. We won't.
It was everything.<eos> You were everything.<eos> And even when people made fun of me -- younger girls at work, shredding on my Ladyheart tattoos and saying you're a joke --<eos> I never stopped loving you.<eos> And I never will.
- We're not going to kill him.<eos> We're not going to kill our son.<eos> But they're going to make us.<eos> A man of your rank, and if we don't, then they are going to take my babies away from me.<eos> - No, they won't.
But they're going to make us.<eos> A man of your rank, and if we don't, then they are going to take my babies away from me.<eos> - No, they won't.<eos> - What are you talking about?<eos> Of course they will.
You don't think I know that?<eos> Is there any news on Lukas?<eos> Not yet.<eos> They're just waiting for him to wake up.<eos> He will.
No, she figured it out on her own.<eos> If she knows, she's going to tell everyone.<eos> - No, she said that she won't.<eos> - Yes, she will.<eos> She will.
Maybe you didn't even bring them.<eos> Look... my first night here, I thought I was seeing things, too.<eos> But the truth was it was in my head because I was upset about something else.<eos> And once I realized that, I stopped seeing them.<eos> You will, too.
Crossing the street.<eos> Wasn't looking.<eos> Will somebody please call my wife?<eos> - The number's in my wallet.<eos> - I will.
Good.<eos> Hey.<eos> This isn't gonna change anything between us, is it?<eos> You're not gonna go all soft and sweet on me?<eos> Oh, I won't.
Stay frosty, we'll be there in 90 minutes.<eos> Actual out. Hey, you going?<eos> I'll stay here, keep an eye on things.<eos> Your man will do his job?<eos> Hell, yeah, he will.
I'm... I'm truly sorry.<eos> Let's just forget about it.<eos> I feel like I undersold Bone Day.<eos> Thanks for not trying anything, Steve!<eos> And I never will!
I'll keep you posted.<eos> Crap.<eos> You think DeLuca's gonna say anything?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> - Yeah, he will.
- You don't know that.<eos> - Know what?<eos> If Kara's mom would ever forgive her.<eos> You have no idea.<eos> Of course she will.
In what way is she psychotic?<eos> She thinks her interrogators are bug creatures.<eos> All right, I'll get approval.<eos> You are gonna regret this.<eos> No, you will.
♪ Really wanna tell you that ♪<eos> ♪ I am the worst ♪<eos> ♪ And I just wanna say ♪<eos> ♪ I miss you every day ♪<eos> ♪ And I will ♪
This plan's fine.<eos> So who's going?<eos> Well, we've got three pods.<eos> - I'll take one.<eos> - No, you won't.
- I love Jim Carrey.<eos> He's so watchable.<eos> Yeah. Um...<eos> I'll see y'all at "Selma."<eos> Yes, you will.
But I'm not showing you Jimmy Jack Corn.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Well, we'll see about that.<eos> We'll see, all right.<eos> Yeah, we totally will.
Where is she now?<eos> Once you told me... you wanted me to feel whole.<eos> That you wanted that more than you wanted to be with me.<eos> I couldn't imagine what you meant or who I would be if that happened.<eos> And maybe it never will.
He's not even there.<eos> Elliot, you need to listen to him and step away from the computer!<eos> Touch that keyboard, and I will shoot you.<eos> No.<eos> He won't.
You have no idea what I'm capable of!<eos> I know exactly what you're capable of.<eos> But you are April because you choose not to do it.<eos> You told me you wouldn't let him break you.<eos> And I won't.
Alright?<eos> Corakinus is attacking us.<eos> Tanya's right.<eos> He won't stop.<eos> No... ..I will not.
I had to tell you even though I'm scared of what he might do.<eos> Tell us how Crowley is involved in this, Miss Cannonbury. I don't know.<eos> All I know is what I've told you.<eos> Talk to him. I'm asking you to find that out.<eos> We will.
Calm down.<eos> I didn't mean for this to happen!<eos> Calm down.<eos> [sobbing] Why haven't you found her?<eos> We will, okay?
Who's "they"?<eos> The mayor, the county commissioners.<eos> They're petitioning the governor to have me temporarily suspended.<eos> And then, uh, if I lose my case...<eos> - You won't.
It's damn good advice.<eos> Unbe-freaking-lievable.<eos> You... You can't even prove the man is dead.<eos> - Have you found his body?<eos> - Not yet, but I will.
I'm not sure this is maybe the right place to discuss this.<eos> How about we, uh, find one of your boys who can give you a lift home?<eos> It's been a long day, honey.<eos> - But we... we will talk?<eos> - Yes, of course we will.
He's in there with Mike Ross.<eos> I don't care.<eos> Well, I do, because like you just said, he is a murdering piece of shit.<eos> But what you don't know is, I made a deal with him, and I'm not gonna break it.<eos> - Then I will.
Pack, no one can ever know about this.<eos> They'll think you're a monster!<eos> You have to promise not to tell anyone.<eos> Please!<eos> I will.
Uh, that way.<eos> Hey, how bad did Neil fuck up the house?<eos> It's not your problem, sweetie.<eos> It is if it falls down.<eos> It won't.
My babies!<eos> We gonna get the boys back, I promise.<eos> Please, please just let us go.<eos> We will go back to California and no one will ever see us again.<eos> No, they won't, sweet meat.
My sweet, sweet baby.<eos> I want to talk to my Flora.<eos> Baby girl.<eos> If by chance you see this, the first thing you have to know, is I love you.<eos> I always will.
Nice people in that department, right?<eos> - Yeah, they seem great. - Yeah.<eos> So you get my text?<eos> - When... when we having coffee?<eos> - We will, Dad.
I'm a nurse.<eos> I stopped listening to doctors a long time ago.<eos> I know it doesn't make sense, but there's another life inside of me now.<eos> How can I take a medicine that could endanger it?<eos> Hopefully it won't.
How did The Man find Lucy?<eos> She must be on his damn list.<eos> Or Murphy is.<eos> We got to go after her.<eos> Hey, hey, hey. We will.
You forget whose child it is you're carrying.<eos> He will have a mark on his head by virtue of who he is, and if you want what's best for him... you will come back to me.<eos> Threats won't make me love you again, Rumple.<eos> No.<eos> But necessity will.
Now who's deceiving themselves?<eos> I read the letters 'cause, like a fool, you save them.<eos> They're important to you, so I know about Jessica.<eos> What else don't I know about?<eos> 'Cause the demon will.
Incredibly, their mirror jurors still think she panicked.<eos> All right, I got it.<eos> You think he has it?<eos> Not quite.<eos> But he will.
You cannot go through these doors.<eos> Is that the invisible Cloak of Perseus?<eos> No, no, I brought that upstairs to... oh.<eos> Well, I guess I'm going with him.<eos> - We all will.
Good-bye.<eos> Why?<eos> Why me?<eos> - Should I go?<eos> - No, I will.
You don't think he's thought of that?<eos> The second he discovers we traced it, he'll take it away, take her away.<eos> Liz, the only way we're gonna get her is by finding where that link is coming from.<eos> I don't think he'll hurt her.<eos> Of course he will.
I think that's them.<eos> Hold on.<eos> Wyatt, what are you doing?<eos> He's gonna hit us!<eos> - No, he won't.
Help me, Warren.<eos> Let's make a deal.<eos> Addy!<eos> No one's coming for you, Lucy.<eos> Addy will.
Please?<eos> It would really mean a lot to me.<eos> Aw, who could say no to this face?<eos> I could.<eos> But I won't.
You're coming.<eos> Let's go, baby.<eos> Do you really expect me to come?<eos> Yes, I really expect you to come.<eos> I will not. — Yes, you will.
Let's go, baby.<eos> Do you really expect me to come?<eos> Yes, I really expect you to come.<eos> I will not. — Yes, you will.<eos> No, I will not!
I believe there are medical factors...<eos> Yeah, I know.<eos> I heard you.<eos> Well, if necessary, will you hear the testimony of an expert witness to the same point on behalf of Ms. Duncan?<eos> Sure I will.
Look, here's the deal, Doc...<eos> You either face this, or you pray to God that he lets you go back to being who you were.<eos> You think he'll do that?<eos> No. I don't.<eos> Good, because he won't, ever.
What the hell are you doing?<eos> Look, I didn't see anything.<eos> I swear I won't tell anybody.<eos> That's right.<eos> You won't.
- Wait, what?<eos> - Don't gripe.<eos> It's economical.<eos> You'll make more bank.<eos> No, we won't.
Outer space?<eos> You can do it in space?<eos> Oh, yes, Nick.<eos> You can.<eos> And you will.
Thank you so much.<eos> Wait.<eos> You really need to find a safe place to live.<eos> I know.<eos> I-I will.
I just haven't gotten around to it.<eos> - Um, I'll do it right after class.<eos> - See that you do.<eos> Look, I know it sucks, but you really should get that done.<eos> I will.
Let me remind you, dearie, that Rumplestiltskin takes children, not the other way 'round.<eos> There's nowhere to hide from me, dearie.<eos> Whatever you're doing, the Mother Superior won't let you get away with it.<eos> That wingless glowworm won't stop me.<eos> None of you will.
Look, I know you want me back, Rumple.<eos> It's... it's never gonna happen.<eos> I know.<eos> But I cannot lose another son, Belle.<eos> I won't.
I'm not really sure what kind of message that sends.<eos> That we have three kids and I work really hard.<eos> It's fine.<eos> Mom, are we going caroling?<eos> Yes, we will.
Now, please, leave us be.<eos> _<eos> Scooped the Sun Times, did it?<eos> If they find out we've been hiding her...<eos> They won't.
Murder's what it is.<eos> I heard Rhonda Coley didn't even make it out of surgery.<eos> He can't get away with this!<eos> Harry. Harry.<eos> He won't!
And they want me to audition!<eos> Is Esteban going to audition?<eos> - Ah.<eos> Well...<eos> - Then why won't you?
Go ahead.<eos> Mateo's Mommy, you're upset because...?<eos> I'm upset because Mateo's Daddy didn't tell me something he should have.<eos> And I should've.<eos> And next time I will.
Look, this is my Zen area.<eos> Whatever I do up here is my business!<eos> Not if your business is the Big Tobacco and Alcohol trade!<eos> My God, give it a rest!<eos> I will not.
So, in a way, you-- you did me a favor.<eos> So now, I'm gonna do you a favor.<eos> So what, you're gonna talk to the police?<eos> No. No.<eos> I won't.
Someone made sure there will be no cars on this road for two days.<eos> I said to stop talking.<eos> Why didn't you leave yet?<eos> You said you were leaving.<eos> I will soon.
We'll keep your proof safe, George.<eos> I know.<eos> Meet us in Boma.<eos> If we don't make it back...<eos> We will.
This still gets you going?<eos> Spying on junkies?<eos> Come on.<eos> He's never gonna lead us to the shooters.<eos> Maybe his girl will.
Yeah.<eos> Yeah, but...<eos> You know, we're gonna beat this.<eos> We're gonna beat this.<eos> We will.
It seems that you've finally done something...<eos> Let go.<eos> You'll tell the Businessman?<eos> How essential I've been?<eos> Yes, I most certainly will.
I understand now.<eos> - Please tell the Aviator I remember him!<eos> - I will!<eos> Don't forget.<eos> I won't!
The PD numbers.<eos> The numbers story. It feels thin.<eos> Oh. You got Cahill to talk?<eos> No.<eos> But I will.
How can you be sure?<eos> Because I know how things work.<eos> Why are they taking the platform down?<eos> Because it's hard to have ideas and easy to give up.<eos> But you won't.
Ladies and gentlemen, the program will be starting momentarily.<eos> But then, Apple stopped innovating, and I saw something better.<eos> Joanna, I know schools aren't going to buy a $13,000 dictionary with good speakers.<eos> You know I know that.<eos> But Apple will.
Stop!<eos> I want to get off!<eos> All right.<eos> Thank you.<eos> We will.
Okay!<eos> I wanna shop online and I wanna start over.<eos> You know, I could be different in the Valley.<eos> What if I don't make it, Max?<eos> This time, you will.
Okay.<eos> I'll see you tomorrow, then.<eos> Okay.<eos> And don't forget the bike key.<eos> I won't.
Will you marry me?<eos> What is that?<eos> This is extremely valuable, alright?<eos> This is a valve ring.<eos> Yeah, I will.
You promised to help me find my mom!<eos> Then I un-promise!<eos> That's not how it works!<eos> You have to help me get to Paris.<eos> I will not!
Morning glories. You'll get used to them.<eos> What happened to the guy who used to live here?<eos> He disappeared. Took off one day without so much as a word.<eos> And what if he comes back?<eos> He won't.
Yeah.<eos> Perfect.<eos> My place.<eos> Text me and I'll send you the address.<eos> Alright I will.
It's been held hostage for the last six months.<eos> I'm going to need a car.<eos> All right.<eos> - You better play ball.<eos> - Yeah, yeah, I will.
Get one for your mother.<eos> Get one for your sister.<eos> Watch the counter, Joy. Joy.<eos> -You will not regret owning this.<eos> -No, you will not.
- That was pretty good.<eos> You're okay.<eos> He's with the Resistance.<eos> He's gonna get you home.<eos> We both will.
Thank you.<eos> We'll carry your stuff.<eos> Go on, get ahead of us.<eos> When you pack, don't forget her medical kit.<eos> We won't.
You have to find someone else.<eos> Are you serious?<eos> Didn't I make myself clear?<eos> I won't find a better man than you.<eos> Of course you will.
They can't force us.<eos> That's not it.<eos> So you want a state funeral?<eos> I don't want to cause a civil war.<eos> And you won't.
And you still can't remember a word you said?<eos> You know how it is.<eos> First the knees, then the names.<eos> - I should have stern words with your assistant.<eos> - Oh, I will.
- It would mean a lot of traveling.<eos> - Yes, I expect so.<eos> You'll love that.<eos> She hasn't said "yes" yet.<eos> Well, she will.
- Yes, I expect so.<eos> You'll love that.<eos> She hasn't said "yes" yet.<eos> Well, she will.<eos> Of course she will.
How are you, Mrs. Donnelly?<eos> Why did you come here, really?<eos> To pay my respects to you.<eos> There's nothing I admire more than someone planting trees under whose shade they may never get to sit.<eos> Others will.
Sarah?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, Sarah's good.<eos> Will you call her that for me?<eos> Yes, I will.
It's a roof over your head.<eos> Who wants a fine wage?<eos> Excuse me.<eos> You might try Weatherbury. If you're looking for work, there's a farm there needs all the help it can get. Yes.<eos> I will.
- I'm not sure if...<eos> - She wants vodka.<eos> The only spirit she can out-drink me on.<eos> We'll see about that later.<eos> No, we won't.
Not bad, huh?<eos> Not bad at all.<eos> Yeah.<eos> This'll get the job done.<eos> Really will.
Not even close.<eos> Then what is it?<eos> Mother, we're going to kill you.<eos> You'll never find your dads in time.<eos> Yes we will.
Oh, Hymie, this is nothing like Roman Holiday.<eos> Roman Holiday had a guy with a name and a body they could give the award to.<eos> There is no Robert Rich.<eos> Who gets the thing if it wins?<eos> Well, maybe it won't.
Cat Numilia is making me feel better!<eos> What does that mean?<eos> That you've got pneumonia and that no one knows when you'll be back at school.<eos> I don't think that Mum's going to come back.<eos> Of course she will.
No!<eos> Can I tell you something, Peter?<eos> You'll never find your mother.<eos> Yes, I will find her.<eos> No, you really, really won't.
Do you know why?<eos> Because I killed her.<eos> She died at my hand.<eos> By this very blade.<eos> As you will, too.
NOT FOR LYING.<eos> WOULD YOU TELL YOUR PARENTS ABOUT IT?<eos> IT'S NOT LIKE I WAS A STREET WALKER.<eos> YOU THINK THE JURY WOULD PERCEIVE THAT DISTINCTION?<eos> THE MEN WILL.

Hey, I don't want to overstep my bounds, but what the fuck!<eos> Jesus!<eos> I don't want to talk about it.<eos> Okay, that was just really uncomfortable, that was like--<eos> I will.
It's only a few hours before daylight.<eos> We will do everything we can.<eos> Philippe, this is crazy.<eos> We're never going to finish at this rate.<eos> Yes, we will.
Nepotism.<eos> That's right.<eos> - And you think I'm a dilettante.<eos> - No.<eos> But plenty of people will.
I will shout "Turn".<eos> You have had rum.<eos> I have absolutely nothing to live for, so I promise you I will shout "Turn".<eos> Promise me in the morning when you're sober.<eos> I will.
Is she okay?<eos> Yes, she's fine.<eos> She was asking about you.<eos> Can you go check?<eos> Yeah, sure. I will.
We'll hold them here as long as we can.<eos> ~ What just the two of you?<eos> ~ Three. I'm staying.<eos> Help them now and I will grant you clemency for your crimes.<eos> I will.
I'm gonna walk.<eos> It's a lovely day for it.<eos> Don't forget this lot.<eos> They're very important.<eos> I won't.
So what do we do next?<eos> Let him stew for a while... mull it over.<eos> I'll go and see him again, tell him he's got 24 hours to make an offer... or the carcass get torched.<eos> I'll go this time, fuck with him.<eos> No, you won't, Ronnie.
He totally saw me.<eos> What?<eos> So?<eos> So, he could kick my ass.<eos> He won't.
We're just entering.<eos> Very clever.<eos> I can't get arrested tonight.<eos> Or ever.<eos> You won't!
You know what, I'm sorry.<eos> Fuck.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> You want me to talk to Dad, I'll talk to Dad.<eos> Of course I will.
Sister,<eos> I think perhaps you are confusing the new midwife with Nurse Miller.<eos> She has gone to Chichester as a postulant.<eos> But you said she would come back.<eos> And she will.
How marvellous.<eos> Are we supposed to go to him or is he coming here?<eos> Well, he'll want to meet me too, won't he?<eos> I didn't actually ask him.<eos> Well, of course he will.
Cold War isn't.<eos> CDC. Very Important.<eos> ~ I suppose it is.<eos> ~ You should stick one of these in your window.<eos> Maybe, I will.
Yeah, but a divorce and going through it alone.<eos> - I can't imagine.<eos> - Exactly.<eos> He's gonna need someone to be there for him.<eos> Yeah, he definitely will.
That is wonderful.<eos> I want all departments on this.<eos> Of course.<eos> I do not want to lose this book.<eos> And you won't.
She wants to work with an anti-bullying charity.<eos> What, is she nuts?<eos> I mean, it's gonna make it look like she thinks her mom bullied her.<eos> Well, I think she's calculating that this will make her more likable.<eos> Not with me, it fucking won't.
-(CHUCKLES) You're parenting.<eos> - Yeah, well, too, I might add.<eos> - Whoa, whoa, whoa, guys.<eos> - AMY: We'll explain later.<eos> No, we won't.
Of course not.<eos> But I do it anyway. Because I want it.<eos> Simple question, Richard, "What do you want?"<eos> Gentlemen, what's the update on the apps?<eos> Or the app-date, if you will?
But I do it anyway. Because I want it.<eos> Simple question, Richard, "What do you want?"<eos> Gentlemen, what's the update on the apps?<eos> Or the app-date, if you will?<eos> I will not.
No, he will not have you killed.<eos> Burgred, you and I will be joint rulers to the throne of Mercia.<eos> Does that not excite you, hmm?<eos> The Mercians may quarrel against us.<eos> No, they will not.
Okay, bud, you're ready to go see Grandma and Pop-pop?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Don't forget the taxes.<eos> Don't forget the taxes.<eos> I won't.
- No, it won't matter, you know?<eos> It's premeditated murder.<eos> I mean, I don't...<eos> They'll put me away for life.<eos> No, maybe they won't.
And when he doesn't,<eos> Wolsey will be finished.<eos> And then I'll feel sorry for you.<eos> Except you won't.<eos> Except I won't.
Master Cromwell, your reputation is bad.<eos> You don't defend yourself?<eos> Your Majesty can form your own opinions.<eos> I can.<eos> I will.
Right, but now you've moved on from your completely insane life, and, well, you've become the best mom I know.<eos> Okay?<eos> So whatever we have to do to make this work,<eos> I promise you...<eos> we will, Jules.
- How can you not tell?<eos> He was three weeks old.<eos> All right, we just keep moving on, OK, Lana?<eos> You'll know him when you see him.<eos> You will.
That is how we prevail.<eos> She's taken her final path.<eos> Yes, she has.<eos> We will prevail.<eos> We will.
My sweet girl,<eos> You're going to be the mother to a whole new generation.<eos> No...<eos> I won't do it!<eos> Oh, of course you will.
Julia.<eos> Alan is here.<eos> We're running out of time.<eos> If we don't find...<eos> We will.
You don't have my back.<eos> You know, that tone you get, I wish you could hear yourself.<eos> You know what?<eos> Just go to Greece without me.<eos> Maybe I will.
Yes.<eos> Assuming that bill Pettigrew was what you said he was And not a casualty.<eos> Ask me any question you want.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> I will.
Untroubling and untroubled where I lie."<eos> "The grass below, above, the vaulted sky."<eos> I wonder if he ever found it... his silent place with God.<eos> Oh, the poem tells me that he did.<eos> As you will one day.
Those twins?<eos> Uh-huh.<eos> They have to go.<eos> I know.<eos> They will.
"One small thing." You mean fuck over my friends?<eos> Your friends, the Rumspringa drug cartel.<eos> Aren't you helping them in the long run?<eos> Maybe when they go to prison, it'll turn them around... they'll find God, like you did.<eos> No, they won't.
- Ow! - You cut yourself?<eos> No, but I broke that window.<eos> Somebody should go report this.<eos> - I'll do it.<eos> - I will!
Surely King Arthur was more appealing than that slimy puddock.<eos> We won't be here long.<eos> Dougal will come for us.<eos> No, he won't.<eos> Yes, he will.
Anything else?<eos> I know you said not to worry, but she's snooping around everywhere.<eos> It's making the kids freak out a bit.<eos> Well, tell them not to do that.<eos> I will.
Look, look.<eos> Everything is gonna be fine, okay?<eos> We'll run the DNA test.<eos> It'll show that he was the father, and then hopefully, the laptop will prove that he was on the roof of the sorority house. - What if it doesn't?<eos> - It will.
- Go away, you stink.<eos> - Okay, I'm going<eos> Benoit doesn't invite you nor Astrid.<eos> I wouldn't invite you.<eos> Nobody will.
Nomi?<eos> - You have to get out of here.<eos> - How-How did you get in here?<eos> If I try to explain it, you wouldn't believe me.<eos> But you will.
I can't let myself...<eos> But you...<eos> I know you.<eos> You have to let yourself feel it.<eos> You will.
I see it.<eos> Noah, that ki... he sai he in't know if he can make it.<eos> That's how I feel.<eos> You're gonna make it.<eos> Both of us, we will.
But Tara, she's... she's in good hands with Pete.<eos> He's hitting you.<eos> He's hurting you.<eos> It has to stop.<eos> - It will. - How?

There's a special place in the seventh hell for your kind.<eos> Please.<eos> Please, I'll pay.<eos> I'll- - I'll pay all of you.<eos> Yes, you will.
You march on Winterfell soon?<eos> We must to beat the snows.<eos> Once before, you put your faith in Ser Davos and left me behind.<eos> I hope you won't make that mistake again.<eos> I won't.
- But it's for kids.<eos> - Say that you're 12.<eos> But I'm 14 and a half.<eos> It's not going to work!<eos> Yes it will.
I love kitties.<eos> I have two Siamese cats, Oscar and Felix.<eos> Felix can wash himself.<eos> Oscar won't. He...<eos> He just won't.
You have to tell her.<eos> I'm not ruining her childhood.<eos> I'm not telling her her whole life has been a lie.<eos> All right, I'll tell her.<eos> I will.
What's goin' on with you? Huh?<eos> I'm having a baby, and I just feel like nothing in my life is my life and I lose my voice, too, I'm gonna...<eos> I can't.<eos> I can't lose my voice.<eos> You won't, you won't.

Well, did you know that Deacon was in the hospital last week?<eos> He was in the O.R. about to get a transplant.<eos> And then somethin' went wrong and... and it didn't happen.<eos> Well, he'll get another one.<eos> No, he won't, Beverly.
I don't know.<eos> I already signed there once.<eos> Rayna believe in me, she invested money in me, and I... blew it up.<eos> I'm not gonna do that to her again.<eos> I won't.
Not this time, I'm afraid.<eos> He's a liability, Terry.<eos> - He could ruin everything.<eos> - Look, I'll talk to him again.<eos> - No, we both will.
- He's killed people.<eos> Look... look... look at Chloe.<eos> They'll get him.<eos> He'll go away again.<eos> He won't!
I need to show you how much you mean to me.<eos> Nancy, will you marry me?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes.<eos> I will.
I love her.<eos> You can't have a relationship with Miss Calthorpe.<eos> You are her employer.<eos> - I don't care that she's staff.<eos> - Other people will.
And shut the door on your way out.<eos> This is ridiculous.<eos> It's impossible.<eos> I will not leave until we part friends.<eos> I will not.
You have a responsibility.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> It's over.<eos> ~ Nancy, will you marry me?<eos> ~ Yes, I will.
~ Just tell me you love me too, and I'll go on fighting.<eos> Of course I love you.<eos> But I can only be with you if you tell your father about us.<eos> I should have told him about us straightaway.<eos> I will, Grace. I will.
You are a stranger to yourself.<eos> The truth is staring you in the face and you can't even see it.<eos> What truth?<eos> Whatever I am... .. you love me.<eos> And you always will.
But it's not a bad thing to hold on to a sardine now and then.<eos> So, from now on, 15% of your construction costs before your skim comes to us.<eos> That's a bit high, don't you think?<eos> My contractors will balk.<eos> No, they won't.
And I was hoping, as my closest friends, that you'd be willing to come over this evening for a sample meal.<eos> Hmm. I knew she wanted something.<eos> Yeah, of course she did.<eos> All you had to do was ask.<eos> But of course I will.
Everyone stay alert. Stay alert.<eos> I'm gonna get a water.<eos> I hate this waiting.<eos> If anything goes wrong, Riley is never gonna forgive us.<eos> It won't.
I hate this waiting.<eos> If anything goes wrong, Riley is never gonna forgive us.<eos> It won't.<eos> But if it did, she would.<eos> But it won't.
I never should've called you.<eos> Well, I'm glad you did.<eos> Gin. We have to sign that consent.<eos> I will not sign it.<eos> - Then I will.
Well, I'm glad you did.<eos> Gin. We have to sign that consent.<eos> I will not sign it.<eos> - Then I will.<eos> - No, you won't.
But you'll make him a fool first. Oh, God, Cookie, I ain't trying to fight with you.<eos> I just want to say I'm sorry for letting Kidd Fo-Fo talk to you the way he did.<eos> And I dropped him because of it.<eos> What you need to do is drop this yella bitch.<eos> Yeah, he probably will.
He's alone.<eos> Clarke, just slow down.<eos> If he is a spotter, he's here to make sure we're dead.<eos> If he tells the mountain were alive...<eos> He won't.
We got a lot of work to do.<eos> So much for the element of surprise.<eos> I'll draw his fire.<eos> No.<eos> I will.
ls that what it is?<eos> Fuck that, Danny.<eos> Go tell him.<eos> Or do you want me to do it?<eos> Because I fucking will.
Of course.<eos> Thank you, Miss Plunkett.<eos> - Don't forget.<eos> You have tickets for the theater.<eos> - I won't.
Felicity...<eos> Felicity.<eos> What did you--<eos> I can't lose you.<eos> I won't.
I don't want to go out like Butch and Sundance, so what's the plan?<eos> Shoot straighter than they do.<eos> Cover me.<eos> If he gets to the fortress before we do, we're dead.<eos> He won't.
- You want him to ask you?<eos> - I told you.<eos> I told you.<eos> You want him looking into your life, Ken?<eos> Because he will.
I told you.<eos> You want him looking into your life, Ken?<eos> Because he will.<eos> I will go to him right now.<eos> - You will not.
Any idea what it was?<eos> It's from the phenethylamine family.<eos> But I've never seen this exact combination.<eos> - We'll know soon, though.<eos> - Yes, we will!
Sullivan isn't treating this case as routine.<eos> Something else is going on here.<eos> I'll see what I can find.<eos> Assuming His Lordship lets us into his house in the first place.<eos> Oh, he will.
What did he do?<eos> We can't explain all that to you right now, all right?<eos> You haven't explained any of it to us.<eos> Yeah, but, you know what?<eos> I will, eventually.
Well, All Saints'll be around forever.<eos> I don't think so, man.<eos> I love my job, but I also love my band, my foster cats.<eos> Well, Matt, this place'll be around long after you and I are both gone.<eos> Oh, no, it won't.
I'm sorry.<eos> You did what you had to do.<eos> I should go talk to him.<eos> No.<eos> I will.
I go to the DEA.<eos> I can try to manage the situation.<eos> You can try, but we won't come out clean.<eos> No.<eos> We won't.
You don't mean that.<eos> I do.<eos> I watched my dad die.<eos> Then you would know that pity won't bring my mom back.<eos> Nothing will.
I had no idea my lawyer would take it that far.<eos> I know, but he did.<eos> All right, I'm...<eos> yeah, I'm gonna call her.<eos> I will.
I do that to guys.<eos> You noticed me two years ago.<eos> Two years, right?<eos> You can't forget me.<eos> You never will.
You're the son that I was meant to have, more or less.<eos> Oh, Bart.<eos> Promise me that you'll never leave me, like they did.<eos> Promise me?<eos> I never will, grandma.
I could reach out to my contacts, help you get a few meetings.<eos> Marisol, we agreed not to mix business with pleasure.<eos> All right? You have to trust me.<eos> I'll find a job eventually.<eos> Of course you will.
What?<eos> I had one cupcake.<eos> Hmm. Okay, three cupcakes.<eos> You better hope we have enough for Miguel's birthday.<eos> We will.
I find that all kids, especially those going off track, can benefit from challenging outdoor activities.<eos> Lucy is not very outdoorsy.<eos> Oh, neither was my daughter. But when she hit a rough patch during high school, my wife and I sent her.<eos> It was helpful.<eos> Yeah, I'll...
Since Peyton invited me to go skiing with her family.<eos> I don't know anything about this.<eos> Because she just asked me.<eos> All right, well, we'll talk about it later.<eos> No, we won't.
Was he stepping up when he fell off the wagon two weeks ago?<eos> Previously on "Mistresses"...<eos> He doesn't know that I'm sick.<eos> - He won't forgive you for not telling him.<eos> - I will.
Vivian... you know him.<eos> If I tell him now, he'll... Blow off the award and jump into savior mode.<eos> I'd never forgive myself.<eos> He won't forgive you for not telling him. I will.<eos> I will.
He was wearing a mask.<eos> I couldn't identify him even if i wanted to.<eos> I don't get it, mrs. Stappord.<eos> Aren't you afraid that he'll come back?<eos> He won't.
I thought that if you'd like to, we...<eos> Speak calmly and clearly.<eos> - Will you marry me?<eos> - Yes!<eos> Yes, I will!
Shelly got a stomach bug, knocked her out of the match.<eos> I found a sub, but we only just managed to scrape through.<eos> So, wherever we stay, I supervise the catering and make sure the rooms are cleaned as soon as we leave for the training ground.<eos> ~ It's easy enough to check.<eos> ~ Oh, we will.
That's the important thing.<eos> I don't even wanna go nowhere.<eos> Gwen, we got a code 3 for chest pain.<eos> But, yeah, we'll finish this later.<eos> - Oh, yes, we will.
The one who gave you her number.<eos> I hadn't really thought about it.<eos> Yes, you have.<eos> But I know you.<eos> You won't.
Something I could read later.<eos> Then at least you'd be a part of the memorial.<eos> Perhaps it might help you make amends.<eos> I need to speak to Joe.<eos> And you will.
He knows, Asher.<eos> You told him?<eos> No, she'd never, with all the crap she's given me for screwing students.<eos> But don't worry... I won't tell Annalise.<eos> Or maybe I will.
I thought that was the threshold.<eos> What else is reported?<eos> Uh, that's not something we share.<eos> But, you know, if I find anything relevant to this specific case...<eos> You won't.
All right, it's -- it's gonna be over soon.<eos> And these people are gonna help us.<eos> And we're all grateful, Ben.<eos> But somebody's gonna have to tell that girl.<eos> I will.
What about his son?<eos> Paramedics were able to stabilize him.<eos> I'm heading over to the hospital now, to check in on him.<eos> Well, let me know how he is.<eos> I will.
And that is my purpose.<eos> I'm here to show the Inhumans exactly what you are.<eos> Even in the darkness, they will see the truth.<eos> No.<eos> They won't.
I haven't been sleeping.<eos> It's this shift and studying for boards and...<eos> - It can't happen again.<eos> - I know.<eos> It won't.
- We'll burn the clothes and personal items.<eos> - And the barrel?<eos> We'll roll it into the woods, and then we'll call the police from a burner phone.<eos> - We'll never pull this off.<eos> - Yes, we will.

Huh. Somebody wants things quiet.<eos> We'll be quieter.<eos> - You remember how to use these?<eos> - I won't need 'em.<eos> Yeah, you will.
Okay... let's play this out.<eos> So I write up the story... get it on the front page.<eos> Then what happens?<eos> Well, everybody will see that he's been lying about his past.<eos> Yeah, sure, absolutely will.
Mobilize our AmWorks allies in Congress.<eos> A commitment list for futures legislations, not just simple endorsements.<eos> This outlines in detail what I would like to do as your Chief of Staff.<eos> All I ask is that you consider it.<eos> Well, of course I will.
Maybe.<eos> But would you forgive me if something went wrong?<eos> Oh, yes.<eos> Of course.<eos> And it won't.
There are snakes.<eos> - Don't move!<eos> We're coming!<eos> The snake-repellent will work this time?<eos> Of course it will.
Another magazine?<eos> Ignacio gave it to me.<eos> Don't burn it before I finish looking at it.<eos> Will you tell him?<eos> Then I will.
Ray, get to the ocean.<eos> If the bots follow you into the water, their electronics will fry.<eos> Got it.<eos> Wait.<eos> But so will my suit.
But it's not-<eos> - It's not in his suitcase.<eos> It's in my fucking hand right now.<eos> - Listen to me, Kevin-- - lf you won't do something about this...<eos> I will.
~ all the comebacks I should've thrown at her.<eos> ~ You did the best you could.<eos> There's an epitaph - "Ellie Miller, she did the best she could" (!<eos> ) ~ What if Joe gets off?<eos> ~ He won't.
There's an epitaph - "Ellie Miller, she did the best she could" (!<eos> ) ~ What if Joe gets off?<eos> ~ He won't.<eos> ~ What if he does?<eos> ~ He won't, Miller.
How is that even possible?<eos> !<eos> It's a school!<eos> We're never gonna make it in time.<eos> Oh, yes, you will.
How do you think I'm feeling?<eos> I'm feeling nervous, darling.<eos> I'm feeling nervous.<eos> I don't want to let you down.<eos> You won't.
They filmed your first time.<eos> I mean, the day that your video accidentally went viral and I was right there to see it happen?<eos> Priceless.<eos> They're gonna figure out who did this.<eos> No, they won't.
Nothing useful on her phone, Harold.<eos> Swept the BB. It's clean.<eos> We have to move fast.<eos> Your little voice finally tell you something about Sameen?<eos> No, but Ms. Thompson will.
That was, uh, intense.<eos> Don't talk.<eos> Whatever you say, boss.<eos> You know, you answer it, they'll stop calling.<eos> - No, she won't.
And pain.<eos> Stop.<eos> I'm gonna hit the switch.<eos> She is going to kill him.<eos> No, she won't.
Hope.<eos> Tell me.<eos> Tell me!<eos> Tell me.<eos> I will.
So I wanted to give you my number.<eos> Okay.<eos> Call me sometime.<eos> Thanks.<eos> I will.
I've been dog sitting for Daisy and Kyle while they're away.<eos> Are they in trouble?<eos> Almost done, babe.<eos> We just need to make sure Mark doesn't screw us up tonight.<eos> He won't.
This is where my life is.<eos> - And where you are.<eos> - Deils, I'm not going anywhere.<eos> You can't come back if they don't give you a clean bill of health.<eos> They will.
You're painting the easel.<eos> - It looks good, right?<eos> - The Mason Hotel wants a painting.<eos> They won't accept an easel.<eos> Or... will they?
- The Mason Hotel wants a painting.<eos> They won't accept an easel.<eos> Or... will they?<eos> No.<eos> They won't.
Work a device to please her.<eos> The only way to please that lady is to crown her Queen of England.<eos> - Will you come north?<eos> -Hmm-hmm, I'll come fetch you. As soon as he summons you back.<eos> And he will.
Neither will you, without any money.<eos> My lord, you hold your earldom from the King.<eos> Your task is to secure the north, to defend us against Scotland.<eos> If you cannot ensure these things, the King will take your land and your titles and give them to someone who will do the job that you cannot do.<eos> No, he won't.
James St. Patrick.<eos> Oh, your wife's name is Tasha, right?<eos> Can you tell me where to find Mr. Stern?<eos> Well, you won't find him in a bathroom doing something with someone he shouldn't.<eos> Or you will.
- Ooh... - Lady Mary's out, miss, and I don't know when she'll be back.<eos> Who shall I say has called?<eos> - I'll wait. - Er...<eos> Lady Mary could be hours, so there's no point in waiting.<eos> - I will, all the same.
- How was your day?<eos> - Not very good.<eos> I'm sure it's not as bad as you say.<eos> Mr Henderson will understand.<eos> No, he won't.
And still, I accept that as a choice.<eos> One that I have carried the burden of every day since I made it.<eos> We're gonna keep running for the rest of our lives.<eos> - Until they find us.<eos> - They won't.
- I'm sure you have!<eos> - And when you marry, you wish to marry only for love?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Well, then, why not marry a stable boy, or a footman?<eos> Perhaps I will, sir.
[Morty] He came to see me with the documents, which are no longer in my possession, then he made the call to Major Halpert, surrendering.<eos> Your son's a hero.<eos> Your son is a traitor.<eos> - History will determine that.<eos> - No, sir. [Halpert] Court-Martial will.
Right, detective?<eos> Right now, this body only wants an alibi.<eos> I was upstate visiting my sister until this morning.<eos> - You can check with her.<eos> - We will.
Are you kidding?<eos> Are you kidding?<eos> Yes, I will.<eos> Are you hurt?<eos> I will.
So, please, for your own sake, what is it you have to say?<eos> No?<eos> All right, fine.<eos> Then you can just sit here until we ring in the new year.<eos> Not without your commander, you won't.
I was wondering if you were planning to return for lunch today.<eos> I've decided to stay because Mr Butler is making shepherd's pie and you know how much I love it.<eos> Tell Mr Butler to set an extra place.<eos> I'll be there immediately.<eos> Yes, I will.
I'm trying to make him conscious of his reality, so he snaps out of his panic.<eos> - They're brown.<eos> - I googled it.<eos> - I don't think it'll work.<eos> - It won't.
Yeah, okay, we'll...<eos> we'll see it all, Millie.<eos> - We'll see it.<eos> Yeah.<eos> - Yeah, we will.
We need to...<eos> We do still need to talk.<eos> Absolutely.<eos> Okay, just...<eos> - We will.
Mom, I left my flute at Dad's.<eos> - Okay. Well, what...<eos> - And I need it for band today.<eos> Good, well, we will go by his house on the way to school.<eos> No, we won't.
It's not just prostitution, there's a major gang presence, and Kiara's not...<eos> The girls working there are not working for themselves. They have pimps, who have them brainwashed and on drugs.<eos> And the girl that you would find down on El Cajon is not the Kiara you know.<eos> So please, promise me that you will not go down there looking for her.<eos> I won't.
The soldiers took my phone before I could call them.<eos> When you see them, tell them that their letters kept me sane.<eos> Okay?<eos> Or... saner than I would've been.<eos> I will.
I heard that, too.<eos> But why just us?<eos> Wouldn't they take out all of North America?<eos> Who knows?<eos> Maybe they will.
- Thank you, Detective Voss. - SHE LAUGHS<eos> Spoken to Jill yet?<eos> No.<eos> She'll come round.<eos> No, she won't.
It makes me doubt if my happy ending's even possible. You can't think like that.<eos> I know, but sometimes I wonder if I'll ever be as happy as I was when it was just you, me, Robin Hood, and Roland.<eos> That feeling was, uh... [ whispering ] The closest I've ever been to happy.<eos> I wanna get back to that.<eos> You will, mom.
I just want to talk.<eos> What about?<eos> Have you thought any about what we discussed last time?<eos> It won't work.<eos> Yes, it will.
That'd be hard to come back from.<eos> How'd it go?<eos> Nothing's ever gonna happen with me and Daniel.<eos> Can't.<eos> It won't.
I'll take the 9am train to Montpellier.<eos> Can I take some days off?<eos> No problem.<eos> - She didn't come?<eos> - She will.
Was really hoping that shuttle would still be here.<eos> And that's not the ride we're looking for.<eos> Agent Kallus, they must not escape!<eos> They haven't, Minister.<eos> They won't.
You said free twice.<eos> Well, that's how free I be.<eos> How's John?<eos> - Say hi to him for me, I guess.<eos> - Sure. I will.
John, I cannot disengage while the Rack is in lockdown.<eos> - Balls.<eos> - I'll do it.<eos> No, Jaqobis.<eos> I will.
To talk.<eos> Where is your, uh, friend Gab?<eos> I don't know.<eos> You tell me where she is, and this'll stop.<eos> No, it won't.
She is in our class as well.<eos> This is what I want.<eos> Oh, Garrett.<eos> Stacy, will you marry me?<eos> Oh. Yes, yes, Garrett, yes, I will!
That evil has already won.<eos> I don't believe that for a second.<eos> When you change your mind, we can be reached at this address.<eos> I'm not gonna change my mind.<eos> Yes, you will.
Previously on "The Strain"...<eos> You may have resigned from Stoneheart, but you haven't resigned from Eldritch Palmer.<eos> You can break this chain of misguided loyalty once and for all.<eos> - I'm not gonna change my mind.<eos> - Yes, you will.
No, we should stay here.<eos> Eichorst will come for me.<eos> I know it.<eos> We have a chance to finish him.<eos> And we will.
You've saved.<eos> Enough's enough.<eos> Tonight, in your curtain speech, make the announcement.<eos> I can't.<eos> You won't.
And I'm not gonna let you or Anna Mueller or anyone else destroy what I've worked so hard to build.<eos> Calvin, you can't just kill innocent people.<eos> You'd be amazed what a private security corporation will do for the right price.<eos> Luckily, I can pay.<eos> You will.
In me.<eos> I believe in you, brother.<eos> This is from my hen, Peep.<eos> Make sure to thank her for me, all right?<eos> I will.
Yeah, but...<eos> So today I'm a member.<eos> And you better clean that locker room, because if it remains filthy in here, I will fuck with you.<eos> Okay, I'll... I'll take a look.<eos> Damn right, you will.
And a big car, bigger than yours.<eos> Cool.<eos> My mom and I will get a bunch of money, like millions.<eos> Yeah, I really don't think anyone's giving you millions of dollars.<eos> Of course they will.
Ray was working on getting him compassionate release when there was an unfortunate incident with another inmate.<eos> Andrew, it's not the time...<eos> We would appreciate it if you would expedite his release.<eos> And if he gets out and fucks up again?<eos> He won't.
I'm running the 800 and the 1,500.<eos> Okay.<eos> Go rest.<eos> I don't want you getting sick.<eos> I won't.
But...<eos> I have needs, too.<eos> Like what?<eos> I need to know that you're not gonna run away again.<eos> I won't.
That's what I'm thinking about.<eos> Screwing Dennis Abbott -- that's just icing on the cake.<eos> It won't work.<eos> We'll see.<eos> Yes, we will.
And it worked.<eos> You know what would have happened if you couldn't convince him?<eos> The SVR would have killed us.<eos> I'm afraid he'll never forgive me.<eos> He will.
- Yeah.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Okay, fine.<eos> I'll talk to her.<eos> - You will?
So, tune-ups and oil changes, too, or, uh...<eos> I just got a new car, and if you go to the dealer for...<eos> My Uncle worries you're not taking us seriously.<eos> No! You'll get the money!<eos> He will!
I thought maybe you would want to do the honors.<eos> And you think this will make everything you did better?<eos> Well, maybe.<eos> It was Gina's idea, so...<eos> - It will.
They'd heard of you and, uh... about flipped when I told them we were neighbors.<eos> They wanted me to put in a good word, you know? Maybe-- maybe you'd see them.<eos> You don't have to put in a good word.<eos> Just have them call the office.<eos> All right, I will.
It's been so long since anyone's touched me like that.<eos> I know, but--<eos> What if this is the only erection I ever get?<eos> I may not have another chance.<eos> You will.
Relax, Manduca, relax.<eos> Manduca, no!<eos> Karamakate.<eos> Come on.<eos> I will not.
Have you spoken to Emmett since he's been gone?<eos> No.<eos> I'm giving him space, and hopefully he'll figure things out, and then come to me when he's ready.<eos> He loves you.<eos> He will.
- What time?<eos> - I'll text you.<eos> I'm kidding. 8:00, my room?<eos> - I'll see you then.<eos> - Yes, you will.
I missed the bus on the way over here and I forgot my phone at home.<eos> I... I had to run half the way over here.<eos> Thanks for driving us home.<eos> Oh, it's fine, I'm sorry your moms couldn't stay to celebrate.<eos> - We will tonight.
I'll deal with it later.<eos> I WILL deal with it later.<eos> They're... playing a game.<eos> If I go into labour, he comes nowhere near that hospital.<eos> Course he won't!
I guess Jackie doesn't review every single application.<eos> Aria, Talmadge is a very good school, and it's a big one.<eos> It's unlikely you would ever run into Jackie.<eos> Don't let her ruin this for you.<eos> No, she won't.
We'll burn the clothes and personal items.<eos> And the barrel?<eos> We'll roll it into the woods, and then we'll call the police with a burner phone.<eos> We'll never pull this off.<eos> Yes, we will.
We'll burn the clothes and personal items.<eos> And the barrel?<eos> We'll roll it into the woods, and then we'll call the police with a burner phone.<eos> We'll never pull this off.<eos> Yes, we will.
I can do all of that and still be with you.<eos> If we stay together, you might grow to resent me.<eos> But if you take this time for yourself... there will be no regrets.<eos> Promise me you'll at least think about it.<eos> Yeah, I will.
Have you even heard a word that I've been saying?<eos> Will you please just stop being a cop for a minute?<eos> Toby!<eos> Just walk away, Spencer.<eos> No, I won't.
Wait. We didn't say anything about...<eos> Oh, bye bye!<eos> - What?<eos> - I don't want to say anything.<eos> But I will.
Which was packed with explosives.<eos> Eh, bad for him.<eos> Well, there was a "danger" sign.<eos> Guy's not gonna stop to read the sign if he's being chased by someone.<eos> Well, maybe next time he will.
Klaus...<eos> How are you?<eos> Welcome.<eos> Dr. Pryce, um, you promised to get some sleep.<eos> And I will...
I concealed my whereabouts and condition from the person who did it.<eos> - An attempt by whom?<eos> - I don't have proof, Sire, so I beg your indulgence until I complete my investigation.<eos> She may not come back.<eos> Of course she will.
- The beginning of what?<eos> - Your crash course.<eos> I have hunted down the most screwed up, medically compromised fetuses that I could find, and I'm bringing them all here to this hospital for you to learn and us to save.<eos> And you'll get to fix them all?<eos> We will.
Come on, baby let's go. We're going to go this way.<eos> I never meant to hurt Lucy.<eos> I don't want to hurt anyone.<eos> - Ever.<eos> - And you never will, Ethan.
All right.<eos> What is this?<eos> We haven't done anything.<eos> No.<eos> But you will.
I'm not the one who did this.<eos> I know. I'm sorry.<eos> I'm just gonna look around campus, but maybe someone's seen her.<eos> Just let me know if you find anything, ok?<eos> All right. I will.
When we go out there, it's never easy, it's never simple.<eos> It's always a fight.<eos> But we've come back from harder things.<eos> From further away.<eos> Glenn, Daryl, Abraham, and Sasha, they will, too.
Do you know how many blonde women there are in Manhattan?<eos> Okay, but you have to admit that could have been Carol.<eos> Along with the other three random blondes that you thought were her, too.<eos> Codependency or not, Bob and Carol are still out there, and if they catch us off guard...<eos> They won't.
Dad, this is the lie that is going to destroy us.<eos> Not my abduction, not the egg donor stuff, this one.<eos> You can't just bury something like this.<eos> If you tell her now, she might forgive you.<eos> - She won't.
You can stay in my hotel room.<eos> I don't think that-- really?<eos> Okay, but she needs to know that I tried to tell her the truth.<eos> Promise me you'll tell her.<eos> I will.
Peruse the inventory, make your pick.<eos> As soon as Charlotte swoops in to seal the deal, we swoop in.<eos> Billy Soto looking fly.<eos> Shame you don't get to see me in action working my magic.<eos> Oh, but we will.
Where am I?<eos> 160 stories below the city... in tunnels built long ago.<eos> And long forgotten.<eos> You'd never find your way out, even if I let you.<eos> Which I won't.
Catherine, come on, those agents have been in and out of that room all day long.<eos> Okay?<eos> They're here, still, right now.<eos> If we get caught...<eos> We won't.
I-I'm sorry.<eos> I'm just frustrated I can't do anything with this stupid hand.<eos> How do you think I feel?<eos> I'm here trying to play scientist, when I really should be trying to make captain.<eos> And you will.
Probably not.<eos> You love him?<eos> Yes.<eos> But I love you too.<eos> I always will.
Maybe she'll like me.<eos> I got confidence.<eos> Ladies love that.<eos> No, she won't like you.<eos> She won't.
Yeah, I guess we will see, as that's what's going to happen.<eos> I guess we'll just have to wait and see.<eos> Yeah, we will wait and see, as Thanksgiving is an event that takes place in the future and therefore it hasn't happened yet.<eos> We'll see.<eos> Yep, sure will.
Something must have happened to the original recording.<eos> [Cell phone rings] There's our trigger.<eos> He's not going to stop until he replaces what he lost.<eos> Hey, sweetness, give it to me good.<eos> I will.
Yes.<eos> Statues of you across the empire, from Gaul to Egypt.<eos> Yes.<eos> We shall have one in this very room.<eos> We will.
Go!<eos> Oh, we're really gonna regret this!<eos> I'll fix it later...<eos> With my hammer!<eos> No, you won't!
(Carter) Previously on "Finding Carter"...<eos> I was having an affair with David Wilson when Carter and Taylor were a year old.<eos> This is the lie that is going to destroy us.<eos> You tell her now she might forgive you.<eos> She won't.
He called a few times, but last night was the first time that he sent his...<eos> Goon friend to scare me.<eos> Will you talk to him?<eos> I just want him to leave me alone.<eos> Of course we will.
I would think it would be obvious.<eos> Typically each side must prove that the other has something to lose by continuing the conflict.<eos> Allowing two British parties to bloody each other further wouldn't be good for either of us.<eos> I'm sorry, have you seen any blood?<eos> Nor will you.
And, as military governor, he would see to it that our family was protected from the patriot mob who now rule this city.<eos> I cannot marry that man.<eos> But he told me that he'd already proposed and you eagerly accepted.<eos> No, I... I did not.<eos> I will not.
- What is it?<eos> - Will you bally well kiss me?<eos> Has anyone told Lord Merton we are here?<eos> Certainly not.<eos> Nor will they.
So you'll forgive me if I seek distraction elsewhere.<eos> Find a hobby or a whore or something other than revenge to occupy you.<eos> You risk both our lives going after the king's brother.<eos> If I have to, I will stop you myself.<eos> No, you won't.
It's... a part of life.<eos> But we're telling each other the truth now.<eos> That's what's important.<eos> You're gonna get through this.<eos> We will.
I'm the governor, I have to say what I think.<eos> Yes, but you don't just say the first thing that comes - to your mind, Peter.<eos> - Look, if you don't like what I'm saying, then don't come to me with all your problems to fix.<eos> Okay.<eos> I won't.
This is why mom and dad are separating?<eos> Tay, I think it's better if you ask them these questions.<eos> No, I'm asking you.<eos> Yeah, and I'm saying, I think it's better if you ask them.<eos> Fine, I will.
Waste container dropped from a semi.<eos> No victims reported.<eos> It's a level 1 hazmat.<eos> If you stay, no one will think less of it.<eos> Okay, I will then.
What did you see?<eos> I'm not sure.<eos> Looked like something I'd only heard about in stories.<eos> I don't want to sound crazy.<eos> You won't.
Well, if Chili wanted crank and Morton didn't get it for him, then maybe he just went and got it for himself.<eos> I found abrasions on Chili's right metacarpals and second, third, and fourth proximal phalanges.<eos> That would be consistent with the bartender's description of the fight.<eos> Yes. But I would prefer that we find evidence that points to something we don't know.<eos> We will.
- Yeah.<eos> - If you've got something to say, say it.<eos> You know what?<eos> Fine.<eos> I will.
All compounded by being a teenager who can't be expected to maintain a teenage social calendar if I'm too busy worrying about... my father hurting himself or anyone else.<eos> Okay, I'll talk to him.<eos> No. Help him.<eos> Please.<eos> I will.
But I don't go down easy.<eos> When he saw he couldn't get at me, he... went after the thing I loved.<eos> If someone went after my daughter, I... I don't know what I'd do.<eos> - We got to get him.<eos> - I will.
When he saw he couldn't get at me, he... went after the thing I loved.<eos> If someone went after my daughter, I... I don't know what I'd do.<eos> - We got to get him.<eos> - I will.<eos> I will.
Not this time.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> We've confiscated all their pills.<eos> What's gonna happen when they hit again?<eos> Because they will.
He will be here.<eos> Hopefully.<eos> We have a plan. We are all gonna be on our best behavior and he will see how well everything's going and he will get comfortable with the idea of coming home.<eos> I don't think one dinner is gonna suddenly woo him back into the family.<eos> Sure it will.
Oh, right, I heard about that.<eos> That's fine, we shouldn't've come, we'll just leave.<eos> No, no.<eos> I was instructed to ask them to move along.<eos> Well, they will, to my table.
Long story, funny story,<eos> And I'll tell you guys all about it over beers<eos> At the nearest titty bar, my treat.<eos> Titties ain't gonna fix my car, poovey.<eos> No, but beardsly mcbugeyes over there will,
But this will be our race car.<eos> Two player, first person game, online, over dial-up.<eos> We still have to figure out what it's about.<eos> What it's about.<eos> Yeah, we will.
School...<eos> Train.<eos> School Train?<eos> I'm going to die, children.<eos> And so will you someday.
What was she doing pledging the sorority?<eos> It was a family tradition.<eos> Her mom was an Omega.<eos> Someone has to tell her.<eos> We will.
We can only afford to get two of us in the front door.<eos> Mr. Jones will find you access.<eos> I don't understand why I have to be the chauffeur.<eos> These are the true blue bloods.<eos> - The upper crust, if you will.
Kim's not budging.<eos> She's going forward whether I'm involved or not.<eos> And you explained to her how completely insane that is.<eos> She thinks that the government will protect her.<eos> - No, they won't.
I had this theory you would come to me when you were ready, but screw the theory.<eos> What is going on?<eos> Kim gave my B613 files to David Rosen, and she wants him to press charges.<eos> You can't let that happen.<eos> I won't.
I want $3 million from whoever hired you.<eos> I assume it's one of the guys in my book, and he's got to have money.<eos> I mean, Olivia Pope don't come cheap, right?<eos> Nobody's paying you $3 million.<eos> One of the publishers will.
What?<eos> Come on.<eos> Let me know when pediatrics arrives, okay?<eos> Let's go learn to use a cast saw.<eos> Yes, we will.
Come on.<eos> Let me know when pediatrics arrives, okay?<eos> Let's go learn to use a cast saw.<eos> Yes, we will.<eos> Yes, we will.
Not a chance.<eos> Maybe we can use this broom handle to pry it loose.<eos> No, that won't work.<eos> Oh, no.<eos> Yes, it will.
Oh God.<eos> I - I bla-I blacked out.<eos> I, uh, please,<eos> I think you can, I think you can help me beat it.<eos> I will.
Don't you want that anymore?<eos> Yeah, I do.<eos> Of course I do.<eos> But if I don't go, we'll never be able to have that.<eos> Yes... yes, we will.
I got shushed, but the purple prose is fine.<eos> Shh! Okay.<eos> She is gonna pull it off, though, right?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yeah, she will.
Well, Lisa, we didn't score a single point.<eos> That was surprising.<eos> Oh, you'll get them next time, honey.<eos> No!<eos> No, we won't!
This neighborhood has to be good.<eos> Sorry, ma'am, residents only.<eos> Too many randos crashed the block party last year, so "Spine Chills" is Pine Hills only.<eos> Mom, you said we could go here.<eos> We will, we will.
How could a crew like that go to ground?<eos> Makes no odds to me cos I ain't looking for them nowhere.<eos> Aye?<eos> Well, wait for them to come looking for you, then.<eos> And they will.
And I'm sorry it's come to this.<eos> But if I hadn't come, my brother would be dead.<eos> No, I know, I know.<eos> I just want us to have our life back.<eos> We will.
Hell, no.<eos> And that goes for Deeks, too.<eos> Oh, well...<eos> Don't tell him I said that.<eos> I will not.
On behalf of the Attorney General himself, I must insist.<eos> The Attorney General?<eos> Get up here-- both of you.<eos> If the Attorney General is so interested in what goes on in my courtroom, - he can come down here and tell me himself.<eos> - He will.
Your Honor.<eos> Here's what we're gonna do.<eos> You're gonna quash this subpoena.<eos> And if I don't?<eos> You will.
No.<eos> I want the surgery!<eos> Dr. Karev is gonna drain the fluid,<eos> - and you're gonna feel better.<eos> - No! I won't!
What?<eos> Sniff in?<eos> No way.<eos> He'll end up somewhere behind my eyeball.<eos> No, he won't.
- But you're going Hans' tomorrow?<eos> - Will you come with me?<eos> - Do you want me to?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Then I will.
Sorry, Frondi.<eos> I should go.<eos> We'll take care of the charges and the damages.<eos> - We'll spare no expense.<eos> - No, we will not.
I should go.<eos> We'll take care of the charges and the damages.<eos> - We'll spare no expense.<eos> - No, we will not.<eos> No, we will not.
- We'll spare no expense.<eos> - No, we will not.<eos> No, we will not.<eos> - We will spare no expense.<eos> - No, we will not.
To be honest, I would much rather hang out at Molly's for a beer, and then head home, and watch the Blackhawks game with you.<eos> Really?<eos> Hey, but you guys should go, if you want.<eos> Okay, great.<eos> I will.
Because I'm not writing a prescription for anything without you talking to me.<eos> I... I can't stop staring at it.<eos> Oh, I noticed.<eos> Yeah.<eos> So will everyone else.
I appreciate the offer.<eos> But as long as Donna wants to work for Louis, I am not gonna force her to work for me.<eos> Okay.<eos> ♪ ♪ Harvey, have you thought about what's going to happen if she doesn't come back?<eos> She will.
I'll...<eos> Take care of it.<eos> - You... you will?<eos> - Yes.<eos> I will.
And with Christophe.<eos> I'm exhausted.<eos> - The shots don't work.<eos> - It'll work.<eos> What will?
- I am so tired.<eos> Parker. - Hm?<eos> When Duke comes back, I am gonna have to go into the Void.<eos> We both know that. - And you're so sure that he's coming back?<eos> - Yeah, he will.
Don't hold back, Nolan.<eos> That's what I did with Jack, and look where it got me.<eos> And I have a private jet at your beck and call...<eos> If you want to fix that.<eos> And I will.
- You won't.<eos> Say hi to the wife and kids for me.<eos> We're not going to have another day like we had today.<eos> Cos if we do, I'm releasing the video.<eos> No, you won't.
I plan to decide in the next 48 hours."<eos> Well, what happens in 48 hours?<eos> You do whatever you like, or you delay again, but you never, ever say no, because anything could happen.<eos> Redmayne will get just as angry if she delays.<eos> No, he won't.
That's... - That's not enough?<eos> - No.<eos> No, it's not.<eos> You're going to have to explain yourself to the directors of the FBI, the CIA...<eos> So I will.
Victor, the FBI, they're-- They're on their way,<eos> (Sarah) what if those guys come in before they get here?<eos> Upstairs, behind all that stuff in mom's closet.<eos> But if they find us up there...<eos> They won't.
Head of security.<eos> That's the same guy who ransacked Arkady's house.<eos> Better tell Hetty.<eos> No need.<eos> I will.
A much less of a threat than he is to our endeavors.<eos> You're wrong.<eos> If she's anything like her mother, she will be just as formidable.<eos> It was my right to lead Krypton, I will lead Earth.<eos> We all will.
Somewhere else, like we talked about.<eos> - What are you afraid of?<eos> - I'm not afraid of anything.<eos> You're the one who's afraid of your history, my history repeating.<eos> It won't.
Holy shit.<eos> No, no, you can't leave him at Julio's.<eos> I have to.<eos> What if someone finds him?<eos> - They won't.
You should have spoken to me.<eos> I thought that you loved me.<eos> I did.<eos> I do.<eos> I always will.
Cell towers will explode and cut off contact from our loved ones.<eos> - That's right.<eos> - Cars will smash into each other and blood will pour from the cracks and we'll still get by.<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Yes we will.
Your father is dealing with the police.<eos> He's talked to all the other parents and we've all agreed that no one has to talk to the police until you guys are ready.<eos> I'm ready.<eos> - I'll do it today.<eos> - No, you won't.
But this is different.<eos> Here's the catch.<eos> See these white circles?<eos> They're microquakes, And they haven't happened yet. But I will bet you<eos> Dollars to doughnuts, they will,
Just him?<eos> And his father Travis.<eos> You might as well kill me now.<eos> The old man is gonna do it later.<eos> No, he won't.
Now, my guards inform me that not one but two archangels have found their way into my city.<eos> That's a 25-year record broken.<eos> Have you ever wondered why Michael hasn't just killed Gabriel yet, hmm?<eos> Michael could end this war right now if he wanted.<eos> But he won't.
Killing the boy won't matter.<eos> All we ever needed was his skin.<eos> If you kill him, you may as well kill me.<eos> I'll never forgive you.<eos> Oh, yes, you will.
In what world doesn't he at least look for the girl, Annalise?<eos> Want me to sit him down, make him spill it?<eos> I'll do it.<eos> Okay, but you need me there in case he freaks out.<eos> - He won't.
- All due respect, sir-- - ...and eat our MREs...<eos> You're not listening, sir.<eos> ...and sleep in a cozy bed with his pretty wife, but when it comes to getting his hands dirty, he doesn't want--<eos> - I'll do it, sir.<eos> - Hell, no, you won't!
We're only trying to protect vulnerable young women from him in the future.<eos> He's ruined several lives.<eos> I'll leave you now, Miss Baxter.<eos> Please consider my request.<eos> Of course she will, Sergeant Willis.
I had to take four different busses just to get there.<eos> I'm sure I'll show up on those cameras.<eos> We'll start with them.<eos> Any luck, the footage backs you up.<eos> It will.
I'm sure I'll show up on those cameras.<eos> We'll start with them.<eos> Any luck, the footage backs you up.<eos> It will.<eos> Course it will.
Yes.<eos> I want to.<eos> Just... I'm feeling a little sleepy.<eos> Tell her I'm okay?<eos> I will.
I love burritos.<eos> Oh, I have to tell you something, Schmidt!<eos> I...<eos> But I can't tell you.<eos> So, I'll...
That's hilarious that they think skiing is a sport.<eos> You live in a very strange country, Bruce.<eos> I know, strange, but it's actually pretty beautiful.<eos> You guys should really come visit in the winter sometime.<eos> - Oh, we will.
Cade!<eos> I'll figure this out!<eos> Don't worry!<eos> King, we gotta do something!<eos> We will.
Somebody should check the kitchens.<eos> Where's Alison?<eos> - Is she not here?<eos> - She was, but... - We can't find her.<eos> - But we will.
Shh, Ali, it's okay.<eos> What's wrong with you?<eos> Hey.<eos> I love you, Charlie.<eos> And I always will.
I understand why you didn't.<eos> No. You don't.<eos> The blessing of an honest man.<eos> She still hasn't found caul.<eos> She won't.
- In the car you tested in Yorkshire?<eos> Exactly.<eos> See?<eos> We'll get you interested yet.<eos> - No, you won't.
- He knows a lot about everything.<eos> - The trouble is, I think he does.<eos> - Did you enjoy our London spree? - I did.<eos> Have you decided if you're coming to Brooklands?<eos> I will if you will.
I'm, uh, researching armed conflicts in northern Thailand during the time I was missing.<eos> Somehow, I must have been part of one of them.<eos> You find anything?<eos> No, not yet.<eos> But I will.
Khalil.<eos> Once he's finished eating, bring him home.<eos> Give him something to wear that won't draw attention.<eos> What if the government finds out that we are harboring a fugitive?<eos> They won't.
I was thinking about next season.<eos> Where was this recruiting trip?<eos> Scranton.<eos> It's a two-hour train ride, you can check with the people I met up there.<eos> Oh, we will.
- What happened?<eos> I was looking for a place to sleep tonight, you know, someplace safe, and a couple guys jumped me.<eos> You... you said you could help me.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yes, I will.
Hey, it's me.<eos> I'm on the ferry. I... I just wanted to say that, um...<eos> - You're never gonna make your flight.<eos> - I'll make it.<eos> No, you won't.
Look.<eos> There's no reason to go to the police.<eos> Trust me. I was the last one to leave the funeral home, and I promise, the necklace was still on Aunt Ruby when I left.<eos> It's not that I don't believe you, Reverend, but I would like to see that for myself.<eos> And you will.
Of course.<eos> We'd love to.<eos> We'll be there.<eos> Sophia, you need to eat something.<eos> And I will.
We don't know that.<eos> This is not the way I want to practice the law.<eos> Oh, what, you mean successfully?<eos> So, what if the prosecution gets to her?<eos> They won't.
Nolan's whipping us into shape to face your good pal Rahm Tak.<eos> Rahm's no friend of mine.<eos> Any word of your mother?<eos> They haven't caught her yet.<eos> They never will.
Yeah. Yeah, I'll be there.<eos> Good job.<eos> You shouldn't be in here, Johnny.<eos> We gotta talk.<eos> We will, soon.
Feel anything, honey?<eos> Just a little buzzing.<eos> Okay, I'm increasing the power.<eos> You find mommy, you bring her back.<eos> I will.
And I don't want my kids to, either.<eos> - Your kids?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> What happened to Steffan can never happen again.<eos> - It won't.
Yeah. And some guy at my new job is going to knock me up.<eos> Wait.<eos> What?<eos> Your instinct will be to say no to this offer, but don't.<eos> Oh, she won't.
It's family.<eos> Okay, how do I look?<eos> - Amazing. - (Giggles)<eos> I didn't hear you say thin.<eos> And you never will.
Yeah, diversity in start-up money is always a good thing.<eos> Uh... All right, look, all you gotta do is bring together A bunch of potential investors.<eos> You ask them for small donations, Then you just gotta figure out Some simple reward system for incentive.<eos> They get the payback when this thing goes big.<eos> Which it will.
Get this situation under control.<eos> Understood?<eos> On it, chief.<eos> [text alert chimes] You gonna talk to your guys?<eos> I will, yeah.
You came back from Jewish camp?<eos> It'll feel so good to have Jeff back ... the real Jeff.<eos> Oh, god!<eos> I'll never forget you, alien Jeff!<eos> Actually, you will.
I'm finishing my junior year, and I have no idea what I want to do.<eos> By the time you were my age, you'd already published your first book, and now you're winning this amazing award because you followed your passion.<eos> How can I be amazing if I can't find mine?<eos> Trust me.<eos> You will.
Go.<eos> Because you're no bloody good to us like this.<eos> I know every inch of you, man, inside and out.<eos> I always have.<eos> I always will.
16 years... 16 years, she didn't speak to her brother.<eos> Justice?<eos> The only real justice is when you take the law into your own hands.<eos> I'll find who did this.<eos> Sure you will.
I trusted you.<eos> He's done this before.<eos> Fell off scaffolding six months after we married. Broke two vertebrae.<eos> I didn't think he'd wake up then, but he did.<eos> He will this time.
-Tonight?<eos> You can't reschedule?<eos> I have to get it done before spring break.<eos> I'm sure they would understand.<eos> No, they won't.
Angelo made this for me when I was pregnant.<eos> Reminded him of his family.<eos> And now that he was having a daughter...<eos> He wanted to keep the tradition alive.<eos> And we will.
I'm sorry.<eos> There's no time for that.<eos> We still don't know who this is or how he died.<eos> And we'll figure that out.<eos> Yes, we will.
Cody and I would just like to say thank you for the big send off, and for investing your hard-earned money in us.<eos> We're opening three laundromats in North Dakota, 'cause that place is booming.<eos> We're not gonna let you down.<eos> I promise.<eos> - We won't.
He refuses to attend.<eos> I've got Sally Langston all over me.<eos> She's looking, and looking hard.<eos> - He has to attend.<eos> - He won't.
Those jurors... [Sighs]<eos> What I did, uh, those jurors... I...<eos> [Sighs]<eos> I will never forgive myself.<eos> And maybe you won't either.
The lower angels are here.<eos> - Their work will soon be done.<eos> - Then you have to stop them.<eos> - No, never!<eos> - Then I will.
Let's move.<eos> Listen, Claire, I swore an oath to protect Alex, but it's more than just an oath.<eos> Yeah, I get that.<eos> Look, if something happens, - if I fail him...<eos> - You won't.
How do you know that?<eos> Have you tried teaching her?<eos> We came to you for help and all you did was get our hopes up.<eos> If I can teach her one word, will you agree to take her?<eos> - You won't.
And what secret would that be?<eos> You'd do anything to protect your sister.<eos> Well, I know your secret too.<eos> Better hope I don't talk in my sleep.<eos> You won't.
I said I'd dropped off for a drink at the pub.<eos> I couldn't tell her.<eos> "He's been a real shit today."<eos> "He's talking through the sat nav now."<eos> But I will.
- You have information.<eos> Oh, hardly anything, really.<eos> A tiny bit. You will give this information to us.<eos> - Oh, absolutely!<eos> Course I will.
- I have a key.<eos> OK, this Damsel person, he sounds...<eos> It's a... time... machine.<eos> I can take it, do whatever I want for as long as I like and pop it back a second later, he'll never know it was gone.<eos> - Yes, he will.
- You need a head.<eos> I can get you a head... fit for a king.<eos> Why do you delay?<eos> We have paid, we will receive.<eos> Yes, you will.
Yeah.<eos> Got an 18-year-old boy.<eos> When you get home tonight, I want you to give him a hug and a kiss, and then I want you to thank the good lord that you've just been spared.<eos> Will you do that for me, Ed?<eos> Will you?
Listen.<eos> I want you to come with me.<eos> Will you do that for me?<eos> - Okay.<eos> - You will?
- Like a flight attendant.<eos> - Oh, this is not over.<eos> Said the man walking away.<eos> You will not get the last word.<eos> Yes, I will.
Hey, Al.<eos> Yeah?<eos> I'm heading out.<eos> Hey, oh, whoa, whoa. Did you finish that engine transfer on that Jeep?<eos> I will tomorrow.
They meaning us and not you.<eos> How you should leave us behind if we can't keep up.<eos> Glenn is out there risking his life for you and for everyone else and I'm still here, so I don't know what the hell you're talking about.<eos> Things are gonna get worse and then we'll see.<eos> Yeah, we will.
Tell me what you will have me do.<eos> It is time to lay down the sword, Wilkin Brattle.<eos> Your savior needs you to live the life of a different man.<eos> Yes.<eos> I will.
You have known only the life of a journeyman, Maddy.<eos> Your rough spirit will quiet in time.<eos> And when Luca is of age to swing the ax, he will have no struggle with a settled life.<eos> Luca will not have this life.<eos> Of course he will.
What's on your mind?<eos> Have you found anything on my father yet?<eos> I mean, was he even in the FBI?<eos> I told you I'd let you know if I found something.<eos> And I will.
I need you both.<eos> I need you to work together as one.<eos> I let my emotions get in the way of my duty.<eos> It will never happen again.<eos> Yes, it will.
So, what the hell do we do now?<eos> Up.<eos> You're gonna tell me how this wire from your family business ended up as a part of those bombs.<eos> I don't have to tell you anything.<eos> Oh, you will, eventually.
- No, I didn't hear anything.<eos> - Say my name, Chelsea.<eos> - That sounds like...<eos> - Ew, no.<eos> Okay, well then I will.
I slept with Whitney in her office.<eos> What?<eos> Jody, put that baby down - so I can strike you.<eos> - No, I won't.<eos> I won't.
Jody, put that baby down - so I can strike you.<eos> - No, I won't.<eos> I won't.<eos> - Put it down.<eos> - I won't.
- Let's take it.<eos> - Peter, I'm 27 years old and I have a baby.<eos> I can't do that.<eos> I understand but come on, let's party.<eos> Okay, okay, we will.
Ooh, maybe I should join the army, get one of those hot Navy Seals.<eos> Yeah, you'll last all of five minutes in basic training.<eos> Shut your pie hole.<eos> So what if this social worker finds out you've been seeing Brandon the whole time you were at G.U.?<eos> She won't.
He said what you said.<eos> That you guys were fighting and that he didn't want to get into it with me.<eos> Okay, now you're being evasive.<eos> Maybe you should talk to him.<eos> Okay, I will.
- I didn't kill him, I-I just iced him.<eos> - And screwed Coulson.<eos> He's working Rosalind, and you just shot her number two.<eos> - When she finds out...<eos> - She won't.
But I can assure you, it will astonish the world.<eos> Our annual shareholders meeting's in six months.<eos> Present it there.<eos> Astonish us.<eos> Oh, we will.
- I think you wanted to get up. - Yeah. Are you okay?<eos> Uh...<eos> Mostly.<eos> So, don't forget about the Christmas party tonight.<eos> - I won't.
Livvy, just calm down.<eos> I need to know where he is!<eos> I need you to find him.<eos> Just find him!<eos> I will.
I need to know where he is!<eos> I need you to find him.<eos> Just find him!<eos> I will.<eos> We will.
Olivia, you must tell him.<eos> Anna, I can't.<eos> James adores baby Georgie and you.<eos> He will forgive you.<eos> No, he won't.
Anna, I can't.<eos> James adores baby Georgie and you.<eos> He will forgive you.<eos> No, he won't.<eos> Nor will his father, nor will his grandmother...
I was wrong, to blame you for what you did.<eos> You were going to do it eventually, I see that.<eos> It was a stupid mistake.<eos> And it will never happen again.<eos> Of course it will.
I was pushed, and I tripped on my heels.<eos> Avery, can you remember anything else about the boys, anything they said or that they did?<eos> It was all a blur of shoving, people laughing, taking video.<eos> This isn't the first time, and the local precinct never follows up.<eos> We will.
Ooh! And I say we're through!<eos> There really was no good time for introductions.<eos> In my defence, that's the first party I've ever hosted.<eos> Who wants to dance with me?<eos> I will.
Marcus admired Alex.<eos> On some level, he might have envied him, but... .. I can't believe he'd want to harm him.<eos> Could you arrange a meeting?<eos> So you do have something specific you're going to speak to him about?<eos> - We will.
Was that your mother?<eos> I wanted to say hello.<eos> When am I going to get to meet her?<eos> I'm sure I'll love her.<eos> Oh, you will.
A conversation is not a deal, Colonel.<eos> And Mr. During needs to be able to move freely around the camp.<eos> As you wish.<eos> Listen, if things get gnarly...<eos> It won't.
It just wasn't meant to be.<eos> I should probably go back to my room.<eos> No.<eos> I'm afraid Mariana's going to wake up.<eos> She won't.
You guys can do this.<eos> Hey, be careful.<eos> He's pretty nasty.<eos> Whatever happens to us, promise me you'll protect those eggs.<eos> We will.
We understand genocide.<eos> We do it sometimes.<eos> Then you would give your penis so that Shrimply Pibbles might live?<eos> - Stop asking!<eos> - Yes, I will!
Out to the bayou.<eos> I figured I'd spend the rest of this holiday with my family.<eos> Jack...<eos> Have you found Camille?<eos> Not yet, but I will.
It is your presence.<eos> It brings danger.<eos> You cannot know what he risked giving you employment.<eos> Look, I don't wish to harm him.<eos> And yet you will.
You seem anxious.<eos> Aren't you?<eos> You're talking as if the attack is certain.<eos> These governments might give in.<eos> But they won't.
I told you, I heard four words.<eos> Das Ziel ist Berlin-- Berlin is the target.<eos> That's all.<eos> Do you want me to make something else up?<eos> Because I will.
I can call CCPD.<eos> They can access the tip hotline, send over files of Grodd's recent attacks.<eos> Good.<eos> We gotta get her back.<eos> We will.
That's right.<eos> He's coming tomorrow, for Father's Day.<eos> You shouldn't have done that, Peter.<eos> My father's not gonna be happy to see me.<eos> Sure he will.
I hope that...<eos> You know, before Bracken was killed, he told me you'd never be happy just being my wife.<eos> Please do not tell me that son of a bitch knew you better than I do.<eos> I love you.<eos> I always will.
Are you okay?<eos> Did he hurt you?<eos> Please help me.<eos> Don't let him take me back there.<eos> I won't...
See?<eos> Just so we're clear, me helping you kill Julian is your Christmas present, so don't be expecting any socks or a TV or anything.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Well, we got to find him to kill him.<eos> We will.
What?<eos> That you are an unsuitable heir, that is what.<eos> Then I will change.<eos> You should.<eos> I will.
- Fight me!<eos> - Lord, we're negotiating.<eos> You will not say another word.<eos> - He will not say another word.<eos> - He will not, no.
- They'll be disorganized.<eos> No shield wall.<eos> We could be killing them before they know we're there.<eos> - Who would set the fires?<eos> - I will.
- the man I cared for?<eos> - Are you there still, the woman I ached to plough?<eos> Progress is being made daily, Lord.<eos> You must come to Cynuit and inspect the building work.<eos> Oh, I will, I will.
You wish to become executioner, Leofric?<eos> My plea is for a fight to the death, Lord... me against the arseling.<eos> If God is with me, I will be the Victor and the ealdorman is allowed to die as a warrior should.<eos> And if he should win this fight to the death, - what then?<eos> - He will not.
Not to mention, it'll blow - the element of surprise.<eos> - Which won't matter if the Taliban get there first.<eos> I'd agree with you, Bess, but we promised them that their families would be safe in the U.S. before they surrender.<eos> I don't see how they're going to trust us if we change the rules of the game now.<eos> - They won't.
Stop.<eos> Stop, stop.<eos> Look at me.<eos> You're gonna find them.<eos> Right. Of course I will.
Monroe! Who is it?<eos> - My husband.<eos> He's looking for me.<eos> - No, no, no. You... You can't let them take her.<eos> We won't.
What are you doing?<eos> You can't beat Hook without it.<eos> Well, my feud with the captain predates you by centuries.<eos> And if I am gonna beat him, I'm gonna do it with honor.<eos> And I will.
She's very vengeful and strong.<eos> Brian: I know what I'm doing, Kevin.<eos> Kevin:<eos> All right. Then just do it.<eos> (scoffs) Maybe I will.
Doesn't something feel off to you?<eos> Whoever did this to Jane knew about the drone program.<eos> That information's above Top Secret.<eos> Her first tattoo helped us save lives.<eos> Hopefully this one will too.
When Nolan killed their vice-chancellor, it pleased my father.<eos> He took it upon himself to rescue Nolan from our common enemy.<eos> My father has a soft spot for the lesser races, but I still think you're animals.<eos> You don't believe what I'm saying, have a look around.<eos> We will.
Photos from the wedding, finally back.<eos> You know, it must be hard for you, looking at all this.<eos> Because of whatever it is you're not going to tell me.<eos> Yo, B, let it go.<eos> I won't.
What did I do wrong?<eos> Castle, this one's not about you.<eos> It's on me.<eos> I love you.<eos> I always will.
I know that I would have a very hard time writing anything nice about kale.<eos> Which is why I'm thrilled that you will be writing my remarks for the World Food Prize Lunch.<eos> So, uh...<eos> Who-who's going to write your Cuba speech?<eos> - I will.
Yeah, it was pretty epic. (chuckles)<eos> (sighs):<eos> Um...<eos> I was kind of hoping you and I could talk a little bit this morning.<eos> We will.
I mean, the woman in Glenport was just... too old, And, um, Victoria --<eos> Victoria did it all wrong.<eos> But, um, let's hope that you get it right.<eos> I will.<eos> I will. Just...
Get a BP and keep giving him blood.<eos> Send a rainbow of tubes and a type and cross.<eos> Get his blood gas and get him to the OR.<eos> Did you find my dad yet?<eos> We will, sweetheart.
How's Ruzek?<eos> Go talk to the parole officer.<eos> Okay.<eos> Now if you leave the city limits...<eos> - Hey, hey, I won't.
I mean, if you're lucky, he'll, uh, he'll drop the murder charge down to manslaughter since you're, you know, following the orders of a guy who's mentally unstable.<eos> You interfered with an operation sanctioned by the CIA.<eos> If you're CIA... how come nobody's come here to get you out?<eos> Oh, don't worry.<eos> They will.
So go get dressed and I'll give you a lift in.<eos> You and your ADAs and the detectives of your Investigations Squad are all way out of line here, and this department expects and demands that you void those arrests and drop all the charges immediately.<eos> I'll give him an hour.<eos> I'll give him a punch in the nose.<eos> No, you won't.
- Which is the wrong approach.<eos> - We're out of options.<eos> Warren, go scrub.<eos> Someone needs to sign off on the case.<eos> All right, I will.
Jade.<eos> Jade, can you hear me?<eos> Now can I get out of here?<eos> Oh, yes.<eos> Oh, you will soon enough.
What matters is what I can prove.<eos> So he's just gonna get away with it.<eos> - No.<eos> - Quinn...<eos> He won't.
There's something going on with that vent.<eos> Time to go.<eos> I don't understand. How did they find us?<eos> They didn't.<eos> And they won't.
He dumped the tracker.<eos> Yeah, that's, uh, that was my bad.<eos> You think?<eos> Well, getting mad at me's not gonna help us track the money.<eos> Well, my sorry-ass phone will.
Eh, here. Take it.<eos> Take it!<eos> I didn't tell you any of this before 'cause I know how it looks.<eos> You didn't doubt for a second that I killed Victor.<eos> Neither will anyone else.
Okay, looks like your total comes to $37.98.<eos> Would you like to give a dollar to help feed hungry kids?<eos> Yes, I would like to give a dollar.<eos> You want to give a dollar?<eos> Yes, I will.
We move the party up a little.<eos> In fact, why don't you tell everybody to be in the mill in 10 minutes.<eos> But Jay's not here.<eos> Yeah, who will give Herm's farewell speech?<eos> I will.
He could've been suicidal.<eos> Anyway, after you called, I started poking around.<eos> He had a beer fridge, and I found this in the freezer.<eos> I don't know what to make of it.<eos> Maybe you will.
- Look.<eos> I'm just going to update the house with news.<eos> Moment it comes in.<eos> Hey, listen, she's gonna make it, okay?<eos> They both will.
I am so sorry about tonight.<eos> I never would've come if I'd known.<eos> Tomorrow morning, I am gonna file a request to be rematched with another program, and... you will never have to see me again.<eos> I want you to know that I didn't forget about him.<eos> I never will.
I stopped telling people.<eos> I'm trying really hard to... to just be a mom.<eos> This is all I have left of him.<eos> I can't lose this baby.<eos> I won't.
All right, now, come on. Let's get back on track.<eos> - Yes.<eos> - I'll go get the cocktails.<eos> You make yourself comfortable.<eos> I sure will.
Liv, how about we go up together?<eos> Yeah, I... I'll, uh... I'll meet you there.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> He's getting away with it.<eos> No, he won't.
Exactly.<eos> Now, the check scam paid out in cash, so I'm thinking, you know, hush money.<eos> I'll pick him up.<eos> - I'll come with.<eos> - No, you won't.
Hold on a second!<eos> I don't know where Quinn is, but I know where your stash is.<eos> But you got to let her go.<eos> She had nothing to do with this.<eos> I will.
In exchange for what?<eos> His cooperation and the whereabouts of Detective Boyle and Steadman's ill-gotten goods.<eos> So you found the stash?<eos> Yes.<eos> As will
Me, the Chief of Detectives and the Police Commissioner himself.<eos> A former captain of mine is serving 20 to life for murder, so you'll have to forgive us for not assuming someone is innocent just because they have a fancy job title.<eos> Just a little housekeeping.<eos> Can I assume, Lieutenant, that the three of you will make your devices available for inspection?<eos> We will.
Carrying around a grudge that big must be exhausting.<eos> - This won't take long.<eos> It's good to see you.<eos> Did you get your rank reinstated?<eos> - Not yet, I will.
Wow, this is a nice office.<eos> This is... Pretty windows.<eos> Yeah, listen to me-- keep your hands where I can see them.<eos> You steal anything, I'm gonna shoot you.<eos> Yeah, I will not.
Call me May, love.<eos> Come and sit down.<eos> How are you doing?<eos> I'm never having a boyfriend ever again.<eos> Course you will.
Hey, Bobby, Bobby, Bobby come here.<eos> Pavel, can't you see I'm busy with work?<eos> Ah, yes, you're very busy with the old man.<eos> I thought we were gonna spend the afternoon together.<eos> - And we will.
Get in!<eos> Let him go!<eos> Sir, need you to stand back.<eos> Stand back.<eos> Like bloody hell I will!
We know he didn't commit the rape he spent 18 years in prison for.<eos> Where did he get his reputation back for that?<eos> He didn't.<eos> He never did.<eos> He never will here.
You're really starting to get on my nerves!<eos> What did you say?<eos> I said... that I'm starting... to feel nervous.<eos> And whether you like it or not, I'm going to a restaurant tonight!<eos> - No, you won't!
I said... that I'm starting... to feel nervous.<eos> And whether you like it or not, I'm going to a restaurant tonight!<eos> - No, you won't!<eos> - Yes, I will!<eos> - No, you won't!
You fail on primes, then you think you can just turn round and crack partitions?<eos> Can't be done, I'm telling you.<eos> Especially not by you.<eos> It can.<eos> And I will.
Can't be done, I'm telling you.<eos> Especially not by you.<eos> It can.<eos> And I will.<eos> No, I will.
You just ruined my sister's wedding and you're asking me out on a date?<eos> Yes, I am.<eos> Can I call you?<eos> - Yeah, you better.<eos> - I will.
And if we can find him, I know he'll give me a home.<eos> A proper home, like yours.<eos> Now I've got an idea. But I'm going to need your help.<eos> - This is never going to work.<eos> - Of course it will.
I went to the garage to get this wrench.<eos> Least I think it was the wrench I was after.<eos> But now I'm up here and I can't remember why.<eos> Well, I'm sure it'll come to you.<eos> No, it won't.
But now... now you'll think I'll talk.<eos> - I won't talk, Bob.<eos> - I know you won't.<eos> I promise.<eos> I won't.
I save his Rolodex card.<eos> What am I supposed to do?<eos> Throw it away in the trash can?<eos> I won't do that.<eos> No, I won't.
- No.<eos> -Tell him.<eos> Don't be ridiculous.<eos> I can't do that.<eos> Then I will.
I'd ask you to renew our vows.<eos> I think it's nice to renew vows.<eos> Maybe we are different people.<eos> Call when you get there!<eos> We will, Fox.
I don't understand.<eos> She was all alone.<eos> The man she loved left and took her life with him.<eos> I will never leave you.<eos> I won't.
'ey, can I get a beer here for my poor relation?<eos> We'll be seeing you.<eos> You know, Giddons finds out that you and' Bo 've been chatting..<eos> He's gonna send you right back up, man.<eos> Yeah, he probably will anyway.
- Dylan, stop.<eos> Stop it!<eos> - I won't.<eos> No, I'm not going to.<eos> I won't.
Tortured me.<eos> You freed me.<eos> I would do anything you ask.<eos> But we must show strength!<eos> We will, Koba.
You know how he is.<eos> Uh, w... w... would you like to come in and... and wait for him?<eos> That's okay.<eos> Just tell him that I stopped by.<eos> I will.
I've tried to ignore it, but it didn't work.<eos> I know Uco has that fire.<eos> I had to lose a lot in my life before I could truly see that that was important.<eos> I don't want the same to happen to my boy.<eos> He won't, sir.
You're a fucking coward.<eos> No, it can't go on like this.<eos> Really?<eos> - I won't.<eos> - You won't?
- No, it's...<eos> - More pressure.<eos> We got a hurt, young girlfriend who will no doubt go public at any moment.<eos> - No, Andie won't do that.<eos> - She will.
I've already changed.<eos> What about the grounding?<eos> I ran away Mariana!<eos> What if your motherfinds out Fernando.<eos> She won't.
No, please, I'll get it.<eos> I'll get the Carrera, I'll get it.<eos> I'll get it.<eos> - Told you not to fuck with me, right?<eos> - Yes, and I won't.
They're killers.<eos> Well, we were planning om cashing out a second mortgage.<eos> Look, I don't have an agenda here, But I think it's a good idea.<eos> Because if and when these killers show up...<eos> And they probably will.
Yeah, sorry.<eos> Yeah, I get it.<eos> Could you just tell her I was here?<eos> Yeah, of course.<eos> Of course I will.
Is that Carol?<eos> Speaking.<eos> It's Christina Noble.<eos> Yeah, I know that but if you could just be sure to tell Gerry that I called again.<eos> I will, yes.
L-low long was that break, man'?<eos> - Three hours.<eos> - Three hours?<eos> - You are gonna get busted, man.<eos> - No, I won't.
My mother hardly spoke to her.<eos> She threatened to disinherit me unless I broke the whole thing off immediately.<eos> Well, we couldn't have that now, could we?<eos> I've never forgiven her.<eos> And I never, ever will.
But you live by the sword, you die by the sword.<eos> And, friends, Lord Riot died this morning.<eos> - Legend. - Mmm.<eos> He will not be forgotten.<eos> - He will not.
That's you.<eos> That's who you are.<eos> Well, it might help you too, John.<eos> No!<eos> No, it won't! No!
Now, step aside.<eos> Gently, step aside.<eos> I can't do it, Mark.<eos> He's got to pay!<eos> He will.
Molly.<eos> I've just had a thought.<eos> Is that a brain?<eos> What if John asks Sherlock to be his best man?<eos> Well, he will, won't he?
So, what do you do now?<eos> Kill us both?<eos> Mary, whatever he's got on you, let me help.<eos> Oh, Sherlock, if you take one more step, I swear I will kill you.<eos> No, Mrs Watson... you won't.
I wanted him to blow up the balloon.<eos> Well, you weren't to know.<eos> Will his soul go to heaven?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, it will.
- A balanced budget.<eos> And we will have another handicapped president.<eos> Okay, hold on.<eos> We're not gonna have a handicapped president.<eos> Yes. Yes, we will.
Like, this was not my thing, and luckily, no one had ever asked me before, so it never really came up.<eos> But he asked me.<eos> And then my grandmamma popped into my brain.<eos> Whatever he wants you to do you better do it.<eos> Or some other bitch will.
I promise, what is going on?<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> - Did you find Roxy?<eos> - Not yet.<eos> But we will.
Oh, my God.<eos> - Did you find Roxy?<eos> - Not yet.<eos> But we will.<eos> We will.
You have asked that question without expecting an answer.<eos> I'm here to answer it.<eos> This is John Galt speaking.<eos> Mr. Thompson won't tell you the truth about the crisis in your world.<eos> I will.
Move.<eos> Didn't you come here to conquer it?<eos> I'll kill you. If you really want to live free, why not quit this school?<eos> Shut up.<eos> I won't.
Sansa's maid saw you with her. She already told your sister.<eos> It's only a matter of time before your father hears.<eos> So I'm guilty of being seen with my own wife's handmaiden.<eos> My father will ask you if there's anything more and you'll tell him some clever lie.<eos> No, I will not.
I thought you were waiting for my call back.<eos> Hi, Albert.<eos> Um, I want... i'm planning to come see you.<eos> I want to, uh, I want to come see you.<eos> And I will.
If he's alive, you hurt him pretty badly.<eos> He's alive.<eos> I put my kids in harm's way.<eos> - I have to get them out of it.<eos> - We will.
What matters is the truth.<eos> Leave...now and I'll spare you a court martial, and that's giving you a choice you don't deserve.<eos> One last time. Will you answer our questions?<eos> No.<eos> I will not.
Scarlett, it's not gonna work.<eos> George.<eos> I can't.<eos> I won't go without you.<eos> I won't.
Sure, I'll hold...<eos> Who is your husband on the phone with?<eos> - The police, who do you thinlC?<eos> - Don't do that.<eos> Yes, I will, Rosa.
You guys should come.<eos> Really?<eos> Okay.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, we totally will.
It's no small thing to kill a man.<eos> To see the life go out of him.<eos> I didn't think I could do it.<eos> But I did.<eos> And so will you.
Yeah.<eos> Let's bid on it.<eos> How?<eos> We haven't sold our own place yet.<eos> No, but we will.
The kingdom of heaven is a dream.<eos> Our only life is here.<eos> Pure heresy.<eos> Well, why don't you burn me?<eos> I won't.
Only in my worst nightmares.<eos> How do you feel about this?<eos> I feel like I should tell my dad.<eos> You should.<eos> I will.
No!<eos> No!<eos> He has very long day ahead.<eos> - We'll wait.<eos> - No, we won't.
Just... bearing in mind you have to drive.<eos> Jane needs help.<eos> Sarah, you won't forget a vitamin B injection as soon as you land. - No. Of course.<eos> - And you'll call me when you get to the hotel?<eos> - I will. - Yes?
Stephen must live.<eos> I will see he gets everything he needs.<eos> I will have him transferred back to Cambridge.<eos> He may not survive the journey.<eos> Yes, he will.
Hello, my child.<eos> I've been waiting,.<eos> What games we will have now.<eos> We'll find her again.<eos> Will we?
I don't know,<eos> I've fallen from the faith.<eos> But, yes.<eos> Yes.<eos> Then we will.
- for an asinine cause like slavery.<eos> - He's on his way.<eos> Fine.<eos> - People will move on.<eos> - They won't.
- They could use a cleaning.<eos> - I'll make an appointment.<eos> - I'll make an appointment.<eos> - You should.<eos> I will, right away.
This your room.<eos> You seem to know where everything is.<eos> How about tomorrow you take me to the War Office?<eos> - I'll pay you.<eos> - Yes, you will.
'Course, mate.<eos> She'll come.<eos> I know she will.<eos> She'll come... ..see us, see her boys.<eos> 'Course she will.
We only ever had each other!<eos> Please!<eos> So every morning, every single morning that you wake up and you say your prayers, you say them for her, because you are the one who put her there.<eos> And God may forgive you for what you've done.<eos> But Israel won't.
I can't...<eos> Yes, you can.<eos> We're strong, you and I.<eos> What if they find out?<eos> They won't.
What happened to us.<eos> Oh, not everything.<eos> They know enough.<eos> If they go to the police...<eos> They won't.
- So, maybe you can tell me, how come it was Ephra Stein launched it and not his sister?<eos> How come he was in the lead back then, but now their roles are reversed?<eos> Take your time, it was seven years ago.<eos> Why don't you ask him that question?<eos> Oh, I will.
It's hers. It's Nessa's.<eos> From ourselves.<eos> So, when you think about it like that...<eos> God may forgive you for what you've done.<eos> But Israel won't.
I won't.<eos> If you don't take off your shoes...<eos> I will not take off my shoes.<eos> ...you don't get on that plane.<eos> - I won't.
- Buy you guys some time.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> Hey, soldier boy.<eos> Still want to hear that story.<eos> You will.
-Your finger. -Feck...<eos> Off.<eos> Fidelma Moone, Will you marry me?<eos> Wow, you really don't understand the term low profile, do you?<eos> Of course I will.
Meera and I, even Hodor, we're only here to guide you.<eos> He's waiting for you.<eos> We have to find it.<eos> You have to make it.<eos> We will.
Take five men, hold the inner gate.<eos> Aye.<eos> Hold the gate.<eos> If they make it through...<eos> They won't.
You have to do something.<eos> The pain will subside as soon as the promethium finishes replacing the tissue.<eos> Promethium skin grafts?<eos> His body could reject them completely.<eos> It won't.
I'll stay for one more.<eos> Well, good for you.<eos> So, here is my cell.<eos> - You better call me.<eos> - Oh, I will, Crystal. I will.
'Kay?<eos> Come on.<eos> Give it a try.<eos> I don't see how this will change the fact that Caleb's gone.<eos> It won't.
Important people in Washington.<eos> PONZI STOPS!<eos> HE REIMBURSES<eos> Sir, is it true we won't start again?<eos> We will, Lucy Meli.
Take care of them.<eos> Clay...<eos> Yeah.<eos> You find it in your heart to forgive.<eos> I... I will.
Emotions get in the way of everything.<eos> Emotions?<eos> You...<eos> I told you I'd fix it.<eos> And I will.
For now.<eos> I suppose you're wondering why I called you down here.<eos> Uh, counseling?<eos> Make sure I don't go cuckoo again?<eos> I won't.
I've done the paperwork.<eos> You get it sent off.<eos> And then, one way or another, we'll soon know for sure.<eos> Yes.<eos> We will.
But I think Elena should be here for this as well.<eos> And I'd rather not start without her.<eos> She'll make it.<eos> I know she will.<eos> No, she won't.
And I'd rather not start without her.<eos> She'll make it.<eos> I know she will.<eos> No, she won't.<eos> She won't.
- Yeah.<eos> No...<eos> You gotta get these guys.<eos> Nicky, you gotta get these guys.<eos> I will, Joey, okay?
- Absolutely.<eos> - We need to talk about our kiss.<eos> - Yes, we do.<eos> - It can never happen again.<eos> - And it won't.
Let's get it over with.<eos> All right, I have no idea how you are going to take this, but I need you to keep an open mind.<eos> When I have ever not been open-minded?<eos> And you cannot tell Sharon, either.<eos> I won't, okay?
Let me get a bag for you to breathe into.<eos> Oh, please, please don't get up.<eos> Would you like to go to the fountain and get some water?<eos> It's in the hall.<eos> -Yes, I will.
I don't know.<eos> I convinced him to take me there later tonight.<eos> But if I leave to stop the attack at the carnival, I won't be here to prevent him from mobilizing his army.<eos> Castor, if you want to prove to me that you've changed, you have got to stop Hadar.<eos> Of course I will.
And I'd be lying if I said it doesn't still hurt.<eos> It does.<eos> But it's like a broken bone that's healed... and still throbs every time it rains.<eos> It doesn't feel like this is ever gonna go away though.<eos> Sweetie, it will.
Waiting for you to come back.<eos> There's nothing wrong about us.<eos> We're not even related.<eos> I don't ever want to lose you again.<eos> You won't.
Spencer, look at me.<eos> Don't take any more of these tonight, OK?<eos> And never take them with alcohol.<eos> If my parents find out...<eos> They won't.
Tessa...<eos> I'm so sorry about the other night.<eos> That kind of thing will never happen again.<eos> You're right.<eos> It won't.
You have a good nose too. What else do you want?<eos> I don't have proper lips<eos> They are fine<eos> No one's going to kiss me, what's the point?<eos> She will Of course she will.
Let me know if you change your mind.<eos> Thanks.<eos> In the meantime, can you try to talk to Garrett?<eos> We really need his support with this.<eos> I will.
You talking about Carl?<eos> Yeah,<eos> Is he okay?<eos> He's not responding, to treatment.<eos> But he... he will, right?
How selfish can you be?<eos> Well, maybe it's not too late, you know?<eos> You could call her and see.<eos> That's not gonna work.<eos> Well, maybe -- maybe it will.
There's not much of a future in that story, either, fellas.<eos> Come on, you're gonna have to throw me a bone here.<eos> We didn't shoot him.<eos> I'm not gonna get through this, am I?<eos> Yes, you will.
So without performance-enhancing drugs, there are only amateurs.<eos> The flipside of course, and personally more interesting, would be to let people do no exercise at all, eat mountains of shit and watch what happens when they try to play sport.<eos> Stadiums clogged with obese people...<eos> - You will die here today.<eos> - No, he won't.
Hey, can't you see?<eos> You're destroying your life, mate.<eos> No, you can't, 'cause you're young and stupid, and you just think everything's gonna sort itself out.<eos> Well, guess what?<eos> It won't!
I got the code to the gate, so getting in is gonna be a piece of cake.<eos> Here's how it's gonna go down.<eos> Ty wants to be the big hero tonight, so we're gonna go in and follow our normal game plan, and then I'm gonna grab the maid and threaten her.<eos> Whoa, man, nobody's supposed to get hurt.<eos> Nobody will.
I-I'm not trying to upset you.<eos> Well, then I think you should be a good employee and get naked.<eos> All right.<eos> I really can't afford to lose this job.<eos> Well, you won't.
But 5 has come up... 32 times.<eos> But 23 takes the biscuit: 49 times.<eos> So I'm playing... 23.<eos> Definitely not.<eos> Everyone will.
I would love to be like you, Mr Hereward.<eos> I would love to be young and zealous and full of ideals.<eos> But what happens in St Gideon's is real, and compromised and shabby.<eos> And that can change.<eos> Maybe one day it will.
Not really, just size. (Mobile phone rings)<eos> He used to go for anything up to 60 grand.<eos> What's he done with all of it?<eos> Get him to exhibit here, maybe I'll forgive you.<eos> No, I won't.
Oh, yes.<eos> Tell your mother I said, "Thanks for watching."<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> Thanks again.<eos> Yeah, I will.
We've come too far.<eos> "Death is nothing, but to live defeated and inglorious is to die daily."<eos> Napoleon?<eos> An unwavering man, he would stop at nothing to find the Hope diamond's twin rock.<eos> Neither will we.
I, I...<eos> Take your medication.<eos> Right now.<eos> Before it's too late.<eos> I, I... I will.
- You owe me.<eos> So? Talk to me.<eos> We're getting nowhere on the Wayne case.<eos> I made a promise to Bruce Wayne and I can't deliver.<eos> But you will.
My beautiful little girl.<eos> Did you really think self-mutilation would restore your power?<eos> Right up until I tried it.<eos> You cannot lose your power.<eos> You never will.
"Freedom of the people"?<eos> Look what freedom you and Lorenzo have achieved for your people.<eos> The fight's not over yet.<eos> Lorenzo will return.<eos> Of course he will.
You get it.<eos> I should probably get some rest.<eos> Yeah. Yeah, I should go.<eos> Hey, but, uh, don't forget to put ointment on it.<eos> I won't.
I can't believe this is happening.<eos> Bryce.<eos> Will you marry me, Carrie?<eos> Oh, it's gorgeous.<eos> Of course I will.
I want you to single-mindedly remained focused on Agent Blye.<eos> If you need to separate Mr. Deeks from the team, do so.<eos> I understand.<eos> I need you to bring her home, Sam.<eos> I will.
We're not gonna kill a child.<eos> Agent Callen, why don't you ask your partner what we should do.<eos> We'll take her with us.<eos> If she slows us down-- and I want you to understand this-- you're trading her life for Kensi's.<eos> She won't.
I was supposed to broker the sale, but now that I'm gone, he's gonna be scared.<eos> He's gonna be desperate.<eos> And you do not want Brunson desperate.<eos> I'll pick up Olivia.<eos> No, you won't.
Here's something.<eos> Clark was working without a partner when he should've been.<eos> Budget cuts.<eos> Report that to the suits upstairs.<eos> I will.
Last chance. Gun down, now.<eos> Don't.<eos> He can't shoot a federal agent.<eos> I can.<eos> And will.
I'll take you to my place.<eos> - I don't need a place to crash.<eos> I need to get out.<eos> You said you'd do that for me.<eos> - And I will.
I forgot a doctor's appointment.<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> - Wait.<eos> We need to finish talking about this.<eos> Oh, we will.
- Nobody's perfect.<eos> And look, it's Cody Brennen.<eos> Hey.<eos> Norman, did you remember the handsaw?<eos> No. I'll...
-In Hazle Woods.<eos> -Who killed him?<eos> Where's Jaff Kitson?<eos> If he hurts my daughter, I swear -<eos> He won't.
How'd she characterize her interaction with Dean Masters?<eos> Went to his place once.<eos> 45 text messages between him and her over the last two weeks.<eos> - You said you'd hook me up.<eos> - And I will.
I don't even know what you mean.<eos> Well, I mean that he wasn't nearly as clever as you, but he was determined.<eos> His persistence really paid off for him, didn't it?<eos> Well, you tell me.<eos> I will.
I can't magically call off an Amber alert, Miss Channing.<eos> We'll see 'em tonight.<eos> They'll be all right.<eos> They're not gonna make it to tonight.<eos> Yes, they will.
If Torbin Salvi succeeds, these chickens will only be coming back to Russia to roost.<eos> Yes, but here I have my chicken in hand.<eos> Dominik Salvi is personally responsible... for the deaths of hundreds of innocent Russians.<eos> My country deserves to see him pay.<eos> And they will.
It was an accident.<eos> A tragedy.<eos> They'll have to believe us now... won't they?<eos> Yeah.<eos> They will.
No.<eos> He was just drinking.<eos> I sat with him, then I took him back to Luke's.<eos> I mean, ask them.<eos> Oh, we will.
All citizens must report to the nearest shelter zone immediately.<eos> This is not a test.<eos> This is a solar flare alert.<eos> Bell, I need to get home!<eos> You will.
Stop her.<eos> How long are we supposed to wait?<eos> Will this even work?<eos> We'll find out.<eos> No, we won't.
Show me.<eos> That's her blood... the Queen's?<eos> Lovely.<eos> Now... now I shall get my revenge.<eos> Of course I will.
So, uh, so a birds and the bees study?<eos> No kidding?<eos> Um, and you want to get it going again?<eos> I do.<eos> I will, somewhere.
And I think it's good that we clear this up.<eos> Anyway, uh, I imagine it's a difficult time.<eos> Ethan must be taking the breakup badly.<eos> He can't understand it.<eos> Well, he will...
My life wasn't bad enough already, you had to make it worse.<eos> I had to show people what the Americans did.<eos> But I will be blamed for the CIA Chief's death.<eos> I will be blamed for the riots.<eos> - No, you won't.
I had to show people what the Americans did.<eos> But I will be blamed for the CIA Chief's death.<eos> I will be blamed for the riots.<eos> - No, you won't.<eos> - Yes, I will.
He's loyal.<eos> I can't believe you'd even consider...<eos> I will discuss it with Olivia.<eos> Okay. I'll take it off your plate, and talk to her myself.<eos> Like hell you will.
We could run.<eos> You just have to say the word.<eos> If you get drunk tonight, I am going to take advantage of you.<eos> No, you won't.<eos> [Chuckles] No, I won't.
Y... [sighs]<eos> Okay.<eos> All right.<eos> Do you feel better?<eos> I will...
- You can't come in.<eos> [ Sighs ] I could come in if I wanted to come in,<eos> - and we both know it.<eos> - But you won't.<eos> No, I won't.
Gas mains are computerized.<eos> The system crashes, and they overload.<eos> The virus is spreading.<eos> How are we supposed to find one woman in this city when all of our systems are crashing?<eos> You won't.
The virus is spreading.<eos> How are we supposed to find one woman in this city when all of our systems are crashing?<eos> You won't.<eos> What's he saying?<eos> You won't.
Are you okay?<eos> Maybe it was insensitive of me to ask you to be a part of my wedding party when you're still waiting on your own beau to propose.<eos> I'm fine!<eos> I am just wondering how we're gonna fit in all these festivities in one short month.<eos> Oh, we will.
- What is this thing?<eos> - That won't come off.<eos> It allows me to control your prodigious powers, miss Donovan.<eos> You'll do exactly what I say.<eos> Like hell I will. (Gasps)
And we have enough food here to last us what, a week?<eos> How much fuel?<eos> We'll find what we need.<eos> - We'll die out there.<eos> - No. We will not.
One leads us to the Well of Wonders, and the other drags us under.<eos> Under what?<eos> So, you're not going to answer any of my questions?<eos> Yes.<eos> You will?
Will you... Marry me? [Clock ticking]<eos> Will you... Marry me? [Clock ticking]<eos> Will you... Marry me? [Clock ticking]<eos> Will you... Marry me? [Clock ticking]<eos> Will you?
And that?<eos> Yeah, yeah, sure.<eos> Take whatever you want.<eos> And if anyone gives you any trouble, just tell them that Wes said it was okay.<eos> Okay, I will.
Yeah, I know, it's my fault. Um...<eos> I just didn't want to interrupt the tour.<eos> Sorry. It won't happen again.<eos> Yeah.<eos> It won't.
You two are the most prosperous people I seen tonight.<eos> God's been good to you.<eos> You can throw a little bit of something my way?<eos> I hope you motherfuckers die of cancer!<eos> 'Cause you will.
And I got myself one little treat.<eos> Expensive little treat.<eos> Honey, this morning, you said to think of the money as my own.<eos> Do you want me to return it?<eos> I will.
Oh, yeah.<eos> He had a huge head.<eos> You were built like a lollipop.<eos> I need someone to stay here with her.<eos> I will.
Because you care?<eos> What does it matter why I do this?<eos> Because you're gonna hurt her.<eos> Maybe not tomorrow.<eos> But you will.
Lifted.<eos> Now. Tell me more about your paper plane.<eos> Tell me about the 25 metres.<eos> If I can make a paper plane fly 25 metres. - I might just get a chance to compete in the Aussie junior championships in Sydney.<eos> - Will it?
No, no. Parsa wanted us to catch her; it was part of his plan.<eos> He kept her in the dark intentionally.<eos> We need to find him.<eos> There's a second team at NSA helping the FBI run a high-frequency trace on any unexplained radio signals.<eos> - We will.
This has to end.<eos> I agree.<eos> And it ends with my father in a box.<eos> The police are never going to hand over your father!<eos> No, they won't.
It's where I talk about how my father's facing prison.<eos> Laurel...<eos> This will all blow over, ok?<eos> Please.<eos> No. It won't, Dad.
When it just seemed... Seemed impossible to believe in anything even resembling hope.<eos> But you did.<eos> You did.<eos> Eventually.<eos> Sara will, too.
I love you.<eos> Wait, are you moving to Hong Hong?<eos> I love you.<eos> - Will you get out of here?<eos> - Yes, yes, I will. (Laughs)
Okay, I can see the baby's head.<eos> - Keep pushing. - Aah!<eos> Give me your hand. [Squeals]<eos> Don't let this thing kill me.<eos> I won't, okay?
Oh?<eos> Why did you marry me?<eos> Because...<eos> I forgot to pick up my refill for my prenatal meds today, and I have my six-month checkup tomorrow, and I know you'll go get them for me.<eos> Of course I will.
You owe me $100,000.<eos> That's not including the car.<eos> You pay me by Friday, or everyone in East End will know what you did to your brother.<eos> And what if I decide to do the same to you?<eos> You won't.
Quit worrying so much, okay?<eos> Yeah.<eos> You got rid of the gun, right? And the shell casings?<eos> Right?<eos> I will.
Of course, the same thing can never happen twice, so let the wine be poured.<eos> Yeah!<eos> Here, here!<eos> Now who will be the first to drink in celebration?<eos> I will.
♪ Time flies ♪<eos> Oh, shit, not again. No no, it's a misunderstanding, I'm sure.<eos> How's it going, Morguey?<eos> Better hope we don't find anything incriminating in your friend's place.<eos> You won't.
Actually one just went home yesterday, so, your timing was kind of perfect.<eos> We appreciate you taking Callie on such short notice.<eos> Your foster moms worked very hard to get you in here.<eos> - Do I have to share a room?<eos> - Yes, you will.
Her car's still here.<eos> That's a good thing, I guess.<eos> Go back in the party.<eos> I'll find her.<eos> Not alone you won't.
When you were going into independent living.<eos> I... wanted to make sure you had everything you needed.<eos> You shouldn't have done that.<eos> I would've done anything to help you.<eos> And I still will.
I'm talking about you latching on to people that got problems so you can feel better about yourself!<eos> That's what I'm talking about!<eos> You can leave now.<eos> You're right. I can.<eos> I will.
Let me help you.<eos> Let's get you patched up.<eos> I should notify the pilot.<eos> - What if those people wake up?<eos> - They won't.
His people will care.<eos> How long until they figure out where he is?<eos> And what happens when they do?<eos> I mean, when they come looking for him?<eos> They will, Bellamy.
Regina's back.<eos> They say your husband's alive.<eos> You bring him home.<eos> I love you.<eos> I always will.
If it seems right, you bring him home.<eos> I couldn't do that.<eos> If it's right, you have to.<eos> I love you.<eos> I always will.
Do I have a choice?<eos> First of all, you don't have to quit your new job.<eos> Really?<eos> But if you come home with even one little tattoo...<eos> No, I won't.
We're starting a Tumblr page.<eos> - You can do the captions.<eos> - Dude, no.<eos> What if we ruin something?<eos> We won't.
You will put an end to this shameful charade today.<eos> Because if you don't, I will.<eos> I will tell your husband myself.<eos> No.<eos> No, you won't.
That is not my business.<eos> I don't have a business.<eos> I have a study, a practise, and I haven't cured one single case of sexual dysfunction.<eos> Yet, yet.<eos> But you will.
- No.<eos> This is on me.<eos> Besides, I need you to look after Nina and Sawyer.<eos> - She won't forgive me.<eos> - She will.
No, she's, uh, she's still in Morin Heights.<eos> Uh, when I decided to come here, she said maybe she didn't wanna, but I didn't believe her.<eos> That's not my idea of having a girl, bro.<eos> Oh, she's gonna come down.<eos> Mm-hmm. Of course she will.
I don't know.<eos> I want to say that I'm okay, but I...<eos> I just don't want it to affect the rest of my life.<eos> You know?<eos> It won't.
This isn't the woman that I know you are inside.<eos> Please, just... stop.<eos> If I win, you'll change your mind.<eos> No.<eos> I won't.
What?<eos> He said that I would never find the Ghost Killer.<eos> Pelant is dead, right?<eos> I will find the killer, Booth.<eos> I will.
I'm fine.<eos> You need to speak to your dad.<eos> I know.<eos> I know.<eos> I will tonight.
How's Aiden handling everything?<eos> Poorly, but he's agreed not to retaliate against Daniel.<eos> What about you?<eos> How will Emily Thorne return with a vengeance this time?<eos> She won't.
Again, outside the scope.<eos> It's fine.<eos> I'll answer the question.<eos> No.<eos> You won't.
But...<eos> What?<eos> But I need to keep on living.<eos> Bailiff: Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help you God?<eos> I will.
- Thank you.<eos> Keep it up.<eos> Well, ladies, make sure to do<eos> - the reading for tomorrow.<eos> - We will.
Perish the thought, mum.<eos> Now then.<eos> Who'd like to go first?<eos> No?<eos> All right, then I will.
Hey, do anyone else's balls hurt?<eos> And, look, some good came out of all this.<eos> Seeing you like that, we all vowed never to get that drunk again.<eos> Well, actually I didn't.<eos> But I will now.
I've got some work to do.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Blauman will cool off eventually.<eos> We'll see him again.<eos> Of course we will.
But I can't do this.<eos> I am begging you, please stop.<eos> I won't.<eos> Ever.<eos> Then I will.
I don't care about the push-ups, jake.<eos> I care that you didn't honor our pact.<eos> I know, and I'm sorry.<eos> It won't happen again.<eos> No, it won't.
Definitely.<eos> Just tell her to call me, okay?<eos> And you call me.<eos> Call me tomorrow and tell me what's going on.<eos> Of course I will.
- We are in!<eos> - Ha!<eos> - No.<eos> - That's cool. I'll call you.<eos> - No, you won't.
I need B.P. on the minute.<eos> I feel like there's somewhere else I need to be.<eos> Alex!<eos> - Don't forget the piñata.<eos> - I won't.
Of course it's funny, isn't it - in my mind, even though the years have marched on, she's always been a little girl.<eos> Anyhow, she, um... ..she didn't want to see me.<eos> She asked me to leave.<eos> I don't know if I'll ever see her again.<eos> Oh, surely you will.
Do you really think a blind girl could shoot that accurately, Doctor?<eos> I'm saying you could do anything you wanted to.<eos> But I do think... ..I do think it was Owen who did the shooting.<eos> He'll do anything you say, won't he?<eos> Yes, he will.
Alright!<eos> Settle down!<eos> Grow up!<eos> It's completely wrecked! Just make another one!<eos> Fine, I will!
Enough!<eos> Enough.<eos> Listen, if there's one thing... the only thing...<eos> that I'm certain of it's that we have got to stick together if we're gonna get through this.<eos> Yeah, well, then maybe we won't.
I'll see you tomorrow, Marty.<eos> Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute!<eos> What the fuck, Jeannie?<eos> I could ask you the same thing.<eos> In fact, I will.
Did the police ever question you?<eos> I mean, what's your next question... what's my alibi?<eos> I was with my buddies down at the ice house till 2:00 A.M. or so.<eos> You can ask them.<eos> Oh, I will.
Who really deserves the iron fist of punishment --<eos> The slave or the masters?<eos> That's a sad story, but it ends the same way.<eos> Killing me won't make a difference.<eos> Sure it will.
Are you certain about using the real thing?<eos> Trust me... First thing Carlito's gonna do is check.<eos> The plan's gonna work.<eos> You just got to make sure your girls know what to do.<eos> They will.
Now, that's one for the books.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> I don't know.<eos> We have to find Scott.<eos> We will, honey.
Are you okay?<eos> I don't know.<eos> We have to find Scott.<eos> We will, honey.<eos> We will.
It's the way we get through.<eos> I can't imagine my life without Charlie.<eos> I can see it.<eos> And it breaks my heart... but I'll survive.<eos> Of course you will.
This kind of thing usually begins with something along the lines of,<eos> "It's not what you think." Or, "I can explain."<eos> Dad, let me help you out.<eos> You need to leave.<eos> I will.
Our enemy is not a killer.<eos> It's a trickster.<eos> The killing is just a by-product.<eos> If you're trying to say it won't kill us, I'm not feeling too confident about that.<eos> It won't.
Arizona!<eos> Stop.<eos> - We will fix it.<eos> - No!<eos> We won't!
Okay. You don't need the money, and jail equals ice cream sandwiches.<eos> But I'm willing to bet that you have some associates in the drug game that would find no humor at all in the fact that you outed them to the Feds.<eos> I fitting' to out nobody.<eos> Oh, no.<eos> You will.
Take my life or I take his.<eos> Don't you dare do it, Leo.<eos> You...<eos> You said we'd go home.<eos> We will.
Moise would like to move ahead with the acquisition.<eos> - I'm not sure I'll need it anymore.<eos> - With all due respect, sir, If these other people can't deliver what they've promised...<eos> - They can.<eos> And they will.
You think I'm related to this woman?<eos> It's a collar.<eos> What does it do?<eos> Too bad you can't ask whoever hired the gang to get it.<eos> Well, I will.
Do you want undignified?<eos> Then wait till you see what I do to you.<eos> You know, you're just like your mom... both playing in worlds where you don't belong.<eos> Your mother paid for it with her life.<eos> So will you.
And he's had it since before we met.<eos> He left it with me while he was away to keep him close, and now you have ruined it!<eos> If mending a cloak is our biggest obstacle, we're in fine shape.<eos> You realize you might not find him... or survive?<eos> I will.
I won't do it.<eos> I'll tell her.<eos> And she'll defeat you.<eos> Then I'll send The Dark One to kill her before you can.<eos> No, you won't.
Oh, yes.<eos> You've become quite fond of the boy, haven't you?<eos> I will enjoy turning him into a monkey's breakfast.<eos> I'll stop you.<eos> No, you won't.
If the Commodore wakes to find me dead without good cause, he'll hold you responsible.<eos> And you know he'll punish you accordingly.<eos> Well, the Commodore hasn't woken, has he?<eos> No.<eos> But he will.
Cause is xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx (I need to tell him a few words...)<eos> About what?<eos> About us...<eos> What, if I become a lesbian?<eos> You won't.
- JT is kidnapped!<eos> The man thinks he won a grant, for God's sake!<eos> You need to calm down and think this through.<eos> No, we need to save JT.<eos> And we will, together.
- Did you see "Field of Dreams"?<eos> - No.<eos> Say it, Big John.<eos> "If you build it, they will come."<eos> - Yes, they will.
What about the embassy?<eos> Totally in the dark.<eos> Langley?<eos> Langley knows, but they can't help you out if you get in trouble.<eos> Then we won't.
I do not want to!<eos> Do not do it!<eos> Lie quietly and close your eyes.<eos> If you zappelst, it will only hurt you.<eos> No, I will not, no, no!
What the hell am I supposed to do?<eos> Not the movie!<eos> Do not shoot!<eos> - You film it not, right?<eos> - No, I will not.
Pause.<eos> High knees.<eos> High knees. Interesting.<eos> I'm not sure all this woo-woo spiritual stuff is gonna help dad.<eos> Not with that attitude, it won't.
Well, that doesn't mean much coming from you.<eos> Amanda, you need to turn yourself in.<eos> What, to I.A.B.?<eos> They're gonna put me in prison.<eos> Yeah, they will.
But this... this is our only chance.<eos> Think of our baby.<eos> Think of being a mother.<eos> Our child will never know its father.<eos> Of course it will.
What am I gonna tell them?<eos> [Exhales] They are gonna kill me.<eos> The royals?<eos> [Growls] [Snarling]<eos> They probably will.
Boyd. ...with me...<eos> Boyd.<eos> ...right now.<eos> I love you.<eos> I always will, okay?
Right.<eos> I give you a clue, you have a minute to guess the identity of the person in question.<eos> We must find a weapon to defeat Moloch.<eos> I fail to understand how a game played on telephones will help us solve our dire problem at hand.<eos> It won't.
And now is to sound the moment that Moloch has grown to his full glory, to call his servants to his side.<eos> It's nice to see that you've taken up an instrument.<eos> Perhaps after dinner tonight, we can have a recital.<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, we will.
There's always a way to expedite things.<eos> You'll find that I can be very persuasive.<eos> What else have you heard about me?<eos> Only that my wife thinks you can help.<eos> And I will.
I'm sorry.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Our twin powers don't work like that.<eos> You actually have to tell Luke to his face.<eos> Well, I will.
Great.<eos> You did a great job.<eos> We can tie him up and gag him.<eos> - What if he gets loose?<eos> - He won't.
They're coming for me.<eos> It's time we finally meet.<eos> Can't say I'm a fan... of this double-blind situation.<eos> How will the field teams meet us at the destinations?<eos> They won't.
And she also told Brass that the kid used the family van.<eos> Patrol found it a couple of blocks from here.<eos> Impound's bringing it in right now if you want to get on that.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I will.
- We don't know. The DEA is getting to Bishop through us, so any business calls, use these, and be careful, - the packaging can cut.<eos> - We got to go to court.<eos> Get a preservation order.<eos> Why? That won't help us now.<eos> It will with the judge.
When I killed her... ..it weren't deliberate.<eos> Will you tell her?<eos> You tell her I didn't mean it.<eos> You tell her I'm sorry.<eos> Of course I will.
Considering insufficient number of your navy, it would be beneficial for you to dissmis your men and join forces with army<eos> -Father!<eos> -What is he doing with his sword out?<eos> -I overheard them saying they were going to kill us all!<eos> -Of course they will!
- Thank you, darling.<eos> - And I will definitely listen to the song.<eos> - Thank you, Tom.<eos> - I really appreciate it.<eos> - I will.
We took care of the Brooke Ashton situation.<eos> - Suicide?<eos> - Yes.<eos> And the coroner will confirm?<eos> Yes, he will.
She's embedded at Gautuma.<eos> It appears Liber8 placed her there.<eos> They will make a move sooner or later.<eos> What if pulling her out tips them off?<eos> It won't.
And then?<eos> Then we close the door and pray.<eos> And pray what?<eos> That the ship keeps them out?<eos> Because it won't.
Finn, wait.<eos> Wait.<eos> Clarke, I need to do this.<eos> I can't lose you again.<eos> You won't.
- Hunt...<eos> - Plus a power regulator that gets so hot, users refer to it as the "coffee cup warmer."<eos> Hunt, you're listing off a lot of problems, and a lot of problems means a lot of money for fixes.<eos> We need assurances that correcting these will solve the computer's flaws once and for all.<eos> Well, they won't.
Now, I don't want to panic anyone, but if you see a firebender with a red scarf... I see him.<eos> He's right there!<eos> I am the escaped convict, and you will all reap my fire.<eos> Oh, no, who will help us?<eos> I will!
I said wash! And, Bart, go work the deep fryer.<eos> Well, if I'll be doing this when I'm 40, might as well start now.<eos> I'm home.<eos> Guys, this is gonna be hard for a while. But we'll get through this as a family.<eos> Yes, we will.
It's only good for one thing-- power, and death is its-- is its greatest ally.<eos> But why choose Kingston Tanner as your target?<eos> Oh, no, no. No. He chose me.<eos> He's been taking my name in vain to increase his coffers, so I thought it best to teach the man a lesson and show the world what religion truly represents.<eos> And we will.
Everything was so confusing.<eos> I had no choice but to go with him.<eos> So now you've chosen me.<eos> Please understand that this time I need to be certain you won't betray me.<eos> I won't.
Do it, if it'll get us there faster.<eos> Look, I know I said I'd spring for a cab, but it's $70!<eos> And I'm gonna need that for a junior king room At the holiday inn express!<eos> Don't worry, Han, we'll chip in.<eos> No, we won't.
No, I need to finish what I started.<eos> How can you if you cannot even trust yourself?<eos> Look, for starters, why don't you put the knife down?<eos> You can't let this destroy you.<eos> I won't.
Discharge on 27?<eos> Uh, that is correct.<eos> What does that mean?<eos> Discharged with further investigation in case we find any additional holes in your alibi.<eos> You won't.
So I took that stuff from you and your roommates and put together bail.<eos> You're my witness.<eos> I'm swearing right here right now, I will get every bit of the money I owe back to Leslie and her roommates.<eos> If I'm your witness, you better make good.<eos> I will.
When do we go get him?<eos> I... oh, I have to report to Washington tomorrow.<eos> Oh, come on.<eos> He'll release you for this.<eos> No, he won't.
Whatever his plan, it's happening now.<eos> Right, which is the reason we have to get out of here.<eos> You can't beast out. There are too many people out there.<eos> No one is gonna see me here.<eos> Yes, they will.
So I guess this makes you and Truman related.<eos> If they don't kill you, I'm gonna.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> I'm looking for something to fight with for when Marion sells us out.<eos> Maybe she won't.
If they don't kill you, I'm gonna.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> I'm looking for something to fight with for when Marion sells us out.<eos> Maybe she won't.<eos> Or maybe she definitely will.
It's hidden in my garage right now.<eos> I'm gonna give it to her when I get back next week.<eos> Wow.<eos> I hope we sell the Giant.<eos> We will.
Hey, kid, I paid for that, I expect to see that eaten.<eos> First glance, I'd say, a shotgun.<eos> Eat it, God damn it.<eos> Will you not come?<eos> - No, Drake, I will not.
Van, but it's in a parking lot.<eos> What are we gonna do with Chuckie?<eos> I have to take him back to the hospital to see his mom and Frank.<eos> We're not all gonna fit.<eos> Sure we will.
Please, don't take any unnecessary risks.<eos> - I won't.<eos> - I love you.<eos> Claire Beauchamp Randall, promise that you'll return to me.<eos> I will, Frank Randall.
That is the 1.45 region.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I mean, I don't know...<eos> Do you know, I was just about to say,<eos> "Well, Jesse Pinkman..." But I won't.
I admire you so much for that.<eos> [crying] Oh, god, why do you have to go?<eos> It's okay, baby.<eos> I'll be out before you know it.<eos> No, you won't.
And you're actually thinking about doing this?<eos> If I don't, he won't sign.<eos> Castle, he could drag this on for years.<eos> And if you get caught?<eos> I won't.
Her stare's cold, Danny.<eos> Les, could you help me out?<eos> She's your friend.<eos> [Sighs] Sabrina, I warned you about Danny and you said it would never affect our friendship.<eos> And it won't.
I should really be with you.<eos> Yeah. Everyone plays their part, Em.<eos> Now this is what I need from you.<eos> Please just... just do this for me, yeah?<eos> Of course I will.
I can help with the grieving process.<eos> Thanks, but I won't be needing this.<eos> Keep it.<eos> You may, change your mind.<eos> I won't.
You can do this.<eos> I've never put a horizontal mattress in an aorta before... only in a bowel.<eos> From this side, I'll just tear through her native aorta.<eos> - Well, what if I tear through it?<eos> - You won't!
Yeah, I did.<eos> But I'm also trying to save a kid.<eos> You had to put it that way.<eos> You said you would get my son back.<eos> And I will.
I feel like you don't even know me at all.<eos> — What do you want?<eos> — Your gun.<eos> Otherwise you won't find the girl.<eos> Nobody will.
You got the instincts and the disposition.<eos> I didn't see it before, but now... And Vern saw it. I know that.<eos> And so I'm hoping that after you have the baby, you come back here and take things over.<eos> I-I will think about that.<eos> I will.
We go to him together.<eos> Then we leave for good.<eos> Okay, got it.<eos> Look, if something goes wrong...<eos> It won't.
I know, but it's dangerous and Barbie is more experienced.<eos> Jim, the town's looking to you right now, okay?<eos> They need a leader, not a martyr.<eos> - If anything happens up there, then...<eos> - It won't.
Her dying wish is my living vow.<eos> As pastor...<eos> I will keep her memory alive.<eos> I know I'm asking a lot... but would you consider joining me in honoring your daughter?<eos> Yes, I will.
Today, I did.<eos> But she's alive and safe.<eos> We did that, at least.<eos> Why didn't you tell her the truth?<eos> I will.
It wasn't spurting, which meant the femoral artery wasn't cut.<eos> So there was a good chance I could stop the bleeding at the thigh.<eos> Will I lose my leg?<eos> No.<eos> No, you won't.
It takes far too long to discover the truth...<eos> I believe you.<eos> Then why are we standing here?<eos> We have to find who took him.<eos> We will.
Do they have our names?<eos> Has the program been compromised?<eos> It's possible, but I won't know for sure until we get access to Leona Wainwright's office.<eos> If anyone finds out about the system...<eos> They won't.
My ashes will be around the rim.<eos> Ashes?<eos> You're not getting cremated.<eos> St. Peter doesn't want a pile of dust in the pearly gates, and I'm gonna have to vouch for you.<eos> Hmm. But I will.
This proves there's an operative in the States.<eos> I mean, this could bust the whole case wide open.<eos> I will get with the FBI and NCIS...<eos> No.<eos> You won't.
At the end of the day, the jurors just saw a cop defending himself against a violent criminal.<eos> Started out that way.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I just wish Cutter knew when to stop and I pray he doesn't go out there and do it all over again.<eos> He won't.
Why don't you move back, Allie?<eos> Phoenix has nothing for you.<eos> Your family is here.<eos> Yeah, Allie, why don't you move back?<eos> Maybe I will.
Gone.<eos> Those guards?<eos> Both dead.<eos> Find him.<eos> We will.
It's the stuff that I talk about on my radio show, but only Bill and me know the really mind-blowing parts of his theory.<eos> Oh, it's been good talking to you, man.<eos> I have been looking for someone who understands frequencies.<eos> Mr. Segreto, I thought that you came here so that we could talk about them.<eos> Oh, yeah, we will soon.
I was sorry about your old boss.<eos> - I liked Will Gardner.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> If I can do anything, please tell me.<eos> Oh, I will.
- She was just...<eos> - Trying on other people's shoes.<eos> Who does that?<eos> - I'll just take them off.<eos> - Yes, you will.
We could've taken out a truckload of Patriots.<eos> And anybody else who gets caught in the middle.<eos> You said you wanted to win!<eos> I do.<eos> And I will.
What the hell are you doing?<eos> I think you know.<eos> Look, you get out of here.<eos> I'm gonna call the cops.<eos> No, you won't.
I was trying to get out in front of it.<eos> Allison Holt isn't our problem.<eos> Mike Ross is.<eos> The U.S. Attorney keeps poking around, he's gonna find out that his star witness isn't even in the bar.<eos> No, he won't.
I can't change who I am.<eos> But that doesn't mean I want to sit at home every Sunday when my family's off at church.<eos> You would go to church with me?<eos> You're my wife.<eos> Of course I will.
I sai it.<eos> Can't go back, Bob.<eos> I just hope you unerstan that nothing happening to you now is personal.<eos> Yeah, you put us in this situation, an it is almost kin of a cosmic justice for it to be you, but... we woul have one this to anyboy.<eos> We will.
Good luck finding one in this neighborhood, especially looking and smelling like you do.<eos> You know what?<eos> I'm walking to the car, right now.<eos> I'll leave.<eos> No, you won't.
To the ferry would be nice.<eos> Cedar cove?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Just do me a favor and do your job, make sure the feds hold up their end of the deal.<eos> Yeah, they will.
Mike!<eos> I don't need to sit here and listen to this.<eos> Well, we just want to talk and make sure everything's okay.<eos> You're not gonna put me in a home.<eos> Of course we won't.
Of course we won't.<eos> Of course not.<eos> Yeah, you say that now.<eos> If things get too bad, we'll deal with it.<eos> Of course we will.
Come on, Simon.<eos> - Come on! - Yeah.<eos> You do know I'm proud of you, Philip?<eos> You'll do what's right by Sylvia and Henry, won't you?<eos> Yes, I will.
You know you should get it down on paper.<eos> What?<eos> Write my memoirs?<eos> I think you should consider it.<eos> I will... .. after Christmas.
I thought you looked familiar.<eos> Melanie's family lived at 24 Old Oak Drive.<eos> If she remembered the combo when she stood in front of her locker, then...<eos> You think she'll remember more if we take her to the house? No.<eos> No, she won't.
Don't make trouble."<eos> But he went around telling everyone that he was innocent.<eos> That was not ordinary.<eos> Ma'am, I assure you that we will do everything we can to find the people...<eos> No, you won't.
All the sleep in the world, I can't have my own father arrested.<eos> Reagan.<eos> Hey. Meet me at Puddings, 64th and First.<eos> The doorman from Ilene Clayton's building wants to talk.<eos> Wants, or will?
I remember.<eos> We had every birthday party of his in this room, till he was 19, till he went away.<eos> Him and George.<eos> You think you won't be able to keep him alive when you leave this house.<eos> But you will.
Never mind about that, but next time she comes calling, m'lady, kindly send her away.<eos> She's not used to the antics of the civilised classes.<eos> Thank you very much, I can manage now.<eos> Are you going to tell Mum?<eos> I won't if you won't.
Someone left him outside the council.<eos> They called an exterminator but I talked him round.<eos> Put him down, Dad.<eos> He'll bite you.<eos> Hey, no, no, he won't, June Bug.
I never realised how much Mew did about the place.<eos> She's got the right idea, you know. Striking out.<eos> There's little point in sinking more blood and sweat into this place if we're only going to end up handing it over to somebody else.<eos> That won't happen.<eos> Of course it will.
Ah. Fix it.<eos> I told you, he needs surgery-- real surgery, in a real hospital.<eos> No.<eos> You think if we take him to a hospital, he will tell them where you are.<eos> He won't.
Me hiding in shadows, you hiding me.<eos> Yeah, and me lying to my sister, Tess covering for me.<eos> I am so sick of lying.<eos> I thought we were moving past all this.<eos> We will, somehow.
He's not.<eos> And what if there had been more than one of them?<eos> We have gone too far to take a misstep now.<eos> - If I lost you --<eos> - You won't.
Hmm. Yeah.<eos> I know I can't make up for the lost time, and...<eos> You have a whole life that I'm not a part of.<eos> Whatever I can do to make it easier,<eos> I will.
You say that none of those conversations ever happened.<eos> That it was all him.<eos> I mean, if it becomes necessary.<eos> If they get caught.<eos> Which they will.
If they get caught.<eos> Which they will.<eos> Which is why you mustn't go anywhere near that money.<eos> Even if it looks like they've got away with it.<eos> Cos they won't.
- Will you tell us the name of your source?<eos> - No, sir.<eos> - Let me phrase that differently.<eos> Would you tell the grand jury the name of the person you know to have stolen classified government documents containing secrets, which if made public, could calamitously threaten our national security?<eos> No, sir, I won't.
Have you seen him?<eos> Have you seen the Darkness?<eos> Don't bring him back with us, my lord.<eos> That child will take us all to hell.<eos> No, he won't.
I have kids!<eos> Oh, come on, Bob.<eos> Those kids aren't that great.<eos> Felix, come back!<eos> I will... later.
And what's this Faraday suit?<eos> How do we know this thing's even gonna work?<eos> It will.<eos> Yeah, and how do we know that Dingaan here's not just gonna hop the fence and skedaddle?<eos> He won't.
One-- you lack a moral code.<eos> Two-- you can kill a man with your bare hands.<eos> And three-- you have to do whatever I say, or I'm gonna make sure this whole place knows that you have someone else's shit under your fingernails.<eos> Oh, I'm gonna kill you.<eos> Not now, you won't.
Ain't nobody gonna take care of our people but us.<eos> Dell hurt one of our own, we can't let him get away with that.<eos> Can't let... that degenerate prick win.<eos> He's got to pay.<eos> He will, Ma, he will.
Even though I hate him and think he's a terrible person.<eos> That is.. very painful for me right now.<eos> It hurts..<eos> Why are you crying?<eos> Because you won't.
Yup.<eos> Could she be the shooter?<eos> Not likely, but she might know who was.<eos> Then Agent DiNozzo's first priority is to find her.<eos> He will.
So they can imagine a brighter future.<eos> Such glory you promise. And so cunning you've become.<eos> How you've changed since you came back to us from convent.<eos> I miss the girl you were.<eos> Many will.
LEWIS: Tony.<eos> Do you know who did this?<eos> We'll find them.<eos> I hope so.<eos> Or I will.
OK, Hugo and I went for a drink at the Perch.<eos> I didn't know I had to tell you in advance.<eos> You can check with the bar staff.<eos> Very kind of you.<eos> We will.
They have nothing.<eos> - Then why are they doing it?<eos> - Politics.<eos> - If they win?<eos> - They won't.
- I was just...<eos> - He couldn't stand up for himself.<eos> You did what you had to do.<eos> - We have to help Jason.<eos> - We will.
You.<eos> -We won't see her again.<eos> -Get off me.<eos> -No, sir.<eos> You will not.
Nobody.<eos> And if you think you're getting Joan back--<eos> Oh, I'm gonna get her back.<eos> You think Dawn's gonna stop me?<eos> I will.
Kept your eyes open.<eos> You let me help you.<eos> She'll tell you she won't make a deal.<eos> She'll tell you she won't compromise.<eos> But she will.
- It worked.<eos> - Whoa, wait. What worked?<eos> Manipulating retaliation for a girl that did not even ask for it?<eos> You wouldn't understand.<eos> She will.
- Yeah.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Yeah.<eos> You know what, you'll get him next time, Cheryl.<eos> - Will she?
Boy, are you fucked.<eos> Tell me.<eos> You're wondering if I have a sense of debt to you for saving my life...<eos> Maybe I'll change my mind about decimating yours.<eos> But you won't?
Tell me.<eos> You're wondering if I have a sense of debt to you for saving my life...<eos> Maybe I'll change my mind about decimating yours.<eos> But you won't?<eos> No, I won't.
No.<eos> I can't hold that notion.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> You'll be shot, you try to leave.<eos> No, I won't...
- I'm not going to tell you.<eos> But I'll get revenge on you.<eos> - Not if I get it first.<eos> - Oh, will you?<eos> No, you won't.
- I do.<eos> I want Matty to date.<eos> - Really?<eos> Well, if you're so sure, why don't you set him up yourself?<eos> Maybe I will.
I don't have a phone.<eos> - Really?<eos> - I know everyone does, but...<eos> Did you find your friend?<eos> You will.
- But...<eos> - Phil...<eos> Your Honor, one more item.<eos> - Tell him that he's looking magisterial.<eos> - Okay, I will.
- Well...<eos> - Well...<eos> You may kiss me.<eos> - I want to meet him.<eos> - Well, you will. Of course.
I'm tired of pretending.<eos> Where's the ring?<eos> SIDNEY: It'll be here.<eos> It has to turn up.<eos> Exactly, of course it will.
No, ma'am.<eos> He waved me forward.<eos> Must be his leg.<eos> You gonna tell the sheriff?<eos> Most surely will.
What do you want, Sidney?<eos> Amanda, your guests are here.<eos> I'll be right in.<eos> You haven't even spoken to the Parkers.<eos> I will.
You are not a coward.<eos> It took courage to disobey his order.<eos> Don't let him get away with it.<eos> Will you come with me?<eos> Of course I will.
Yeah, Lena's on a short list for a position in the commerce department in D.C., so we're celebrating.<eos> Well, tell her congratulations for me.<eos> Oh, well, it's not said and done yet, but we're hopeful.<eos> You know, Jane we will bring Lisbon back home safe.<eos> Of course we will.
Was in D.C. for a deposition, and decided to go for a run on the hotel treadmill.<eos> And he had a heart attack.<eos> There is a part of him that I still feel.<eos> I just want it to go away.<eos> It won't.
You want to call me something?<eos> Call me Adam.<eos> Feels like I've been here right from the beginning.<eos> I think you and I should meet.<eos> Ah, we will.
My son only knows me as this selfish, lying, fall-down drunk.<eos> - That's not who I am anymore.<eos> - I'll call him.<eos> See if he'd be willing to come by and say goodbye.<eos> He won't.
- I need the files now.<eos> Oh, no.<eos> Everything is time-stamped.<eos> - Once I get the forms...<eos> - You will.
Aren't you done with me telling you?<eos> What are you waiting for anyway?<eos> She won't even open the door.<eos> - You don't know that.<eos> - She won't.
I hope you have a good time with your nephew tonight.<eos> Oh, thank you.<eos> He's an exceptional young man.<eos> I'll see you tomorrow morning.<eos> Yes, you will.
It's my fault.<eos> I'm gonna fix it.<eos> I'm gonna fix it.<eos> - I'll stay at your place.<eos> - No, no, you won't.
Taking them constitutes an act of war.<eos> If they disobey me...<eos> All the power of my kingdom will fall upon them!<eos> They will come with me.<eos> No, they won't.
- I'm gonna get out of here.<eos> - Tonight's list includes some longtime favorites...<eos> - No, d... do... don't.<eos> Just... - ... and some very interesting newcomers.<eos> - I will...
All right, I'll call her, and I'll see what's going on.<eos> Kiley: Hello?<eos> Please tell me you're on your way to pick up Micah.<eos> I can't lose him, Gunnar.<eos> And you won't.
You don't?<eos> You know what?<eos> I bet this is your business... school way of asking if I got one ready for Edgehill.<eos> I told Henry Benton we'd be releasing next quarter.<eos> Yeah, and we will.
Previously on Suits...<eos> You're good with me working on the takeover with Logan.<eos> As long as we don't let that affect this.<eos> We won't.
Anyone finds out that I have a mole, I'm ruined.<eos> Those contracts are gone, and the thousands of people who depend on me lose their jobs.<eos> If I have a mole, I need to find him myself before anyone else does.<eos> Did you find him yet?<eos> Not yet, but I will.
You're not going to work.<eos> You just told me you have a drug addiction.<eos> We need to talk about this.<eos> I know.<eos> And we will.
- Yeah, what is it?<eos> - A plane.<eos> A plane?<eos> You found a plane?<eos> Not yet, but we will.
Not if we see you first.<eos> [Chuckles]<eos> [Grunts]<eos> Don't worry.<eos> You won't.
They already think I'm guilty, which is what Gabe wants them to think, right?<eos> No, he wants you to go after him.<eos> Kill or be killed.<eos> Yeah, well, I'll take my chances.<eos> Yeah, but I won't.
- Smiling's extra. - All right.<eos> Ciao.<eos> Call me.<eos> All right.<eos> I certainly will, Officer.
Well, I was hoping to tell her tonight.<eos> Then you showed up in your... condition.<eos> Oh, there it is.<eos> I won't let you disappoint her the way you've disappointed everyone else in your life.<eos> - I won't.
Come on.<eos> - Well, so much for avoiding the big blowout.<eos> - Had to be done.<eos> God, I hope I don't blow this.<eos> You won't.
It was the first night of the war, and because of Abby, I was able to survive.<eos> Please, Senator, turn off the water.<eos> You can change things.<eos> Now we are gonna go outside and let the people know that things are gonna be different now.<eos> We will.
I just...<eos> I don't know, honestly, I just forgot.<eos> Okay, I will try and change the time.<eos> - But if you miss it...<eos> - I won't.
Carter, Carter.<eos> I just wanna go home, okay?<eos> - Okay.<eos> - I just wanna go see my mom.<eos> All right, Carter, and you will.
- The police might be able to help.<eos> - Like the detective said, if they've got nothing to hide, they have nothing to worry about.<eos> Why don't you let us find out what's going on?<eos> If there really is something bad, you can go to the cops and we'll come with you.<eos> We will...?
It's not that simple, not where the Espheni are concerned.<eos> He must want something from you, Lexi, or none of this would be happening.<eos> I need to speak to him.<eos> You'll kill him.<eos> No. I won't.
Of course.<eos> And you and, uh, Sam seem... good, so...<eos> I'm here just to get a job done. That's it.<eos> I know.<eos> And we will.
It's, um...<eos> This is the dress that I was gonna wear to... get you back.<eos> Well, it's a nice dress, and you look beautiful in it.<eos> But it doesn't change anything.<eos> What will?
Okay, cool.<eos> All right, hold on one second.<eos> Any dreams you have of him making a team or being in student council, it's just, uh, not gonna happen.<eos> I thought you told me he'd eventually fit in.<eos> No, he will, just not at school.
We both love Jamal.<eos> He needs us.<eos> He'll, um... he'll grow into the job.<eos> No.<eos> He won't.
We don't sell to kids, ever.<eos> We have rules.<eos> Oh, how principled of you.<eos> Well, if you want to go, just... just go.<eos> Yeah, I will.
You never met me. You never fixed my car.<eos> What's that worth?<eos> How about 10 grand?<eos> Will that do it?<eos> No, but 20 will.
You never met me. You never fixed my car.<eos> What's that worth?<eos> How about 10 grand?<eos> Will that do it?<eos> No, but 20 will.
Maggie's with them.<eos> She used to believe in me, but now...<eos> Everything's changing.<eos> I haven't changed.<eos> I never will.
I don't know.<eos> All he would say is that he's protecting her.<eos> But he's behind this.I know it.<eos> We have to get her out of here!<eos> We will!
Get back behind the barricade!<eos> Get -- the Espheni are on the attack!<eos> Come on!<eos> When they see that we mean no harm, we will be spared.<eos> Like hell you will!
Well, I am like this now but...<eos> You have superpowers too?<eos> Don't get in my way.<eos> Step back!<eos> I won't!
Stay on mission.<eos> It's always the mission' isn't it?<eos> Draw straws like a good soldier.<eos> You can bet straws isn't gonna decide anything.<eos> A gun will.
I can't control this.<eos> I know how you feel.<eos> Y-you're trapped.<eos> It's a battle you can't win, but it's exactly the kind of battle you have to fight, or you'll die.<eos> No, I won't.
All right, guess what, I'm gonna sign off on this.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I will regret it, but I'm signing off on this.<eos> - You're not gonna regret it.<eos> - Yes, I will.
Why did you do that?<eos> It's my job.<eos> So is finding out why you were standing in traffic.<eos> You wouldn't understand.<eos> Well, maybe your father will.
We have enough politicians.<eos> We need leaders who actually understand what it means to be a public servant.<eos> Listen, I've got to go.<eos> Promise me you'll think about it?<eos> I will.
Let's go.<eos> This is bad news,<eos> Jax. If we don't get the guns, means we're gonna want most of Lin's turf.<eos> And that won't make Tyler very happy.<eos> No, it won't.
You want the Niners to start looking for him?<eos> No. Connor doesn't know that Tyler's with us.<eos> We get him to call, tell Connor that Marks needs a shipment of guns when he gets out and that black will give him half the money down.<eos> Connor shows up for a duffle full of cash.<eos> Yeah, he will.
Well, how'd he do that?<eos> I'll trim his nails. Let me see 'em. Here you go.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You really should try to eat something, Ma.<eos> I will, baby.
The rest don't give a shit.<eos> The hell they doing here?<eos> Tully wanted me to meet 'em.<eos> You tell Leland?<eos> We will.
Expedite the time table just in case.<eos> Start tomorrow with that blonde idiot at my desk.<eos> Honestly, how hard is it to knock?<eos> And if these people come back?<eos> They won't.
Satisfied?<eos> I don't satisfy easy.<eos> I'm comin' back for you and the baby.<eos> Don't say it.<eos> I will.
Radiation cloud should pool up in the San Fernando Valley basin.<eos> You might be okay.<eos> No one would blame you if you wanted a head start.<eos> If it doesn't work, I'll go get Ralph.<eos> But it will.
- I tried a couple of times.<eos> It's no worry, though.<eos> I mean, he and Alvarez, all good.<eos> - Yeah, well, you're gonna have to tell him.<eos> - And I will.
I understand.<eos> I don't know.<eos> Okay, Mano.<eos> Uh, yeah, if I see her, I'll, uh... I'll let you know.<eos> I will, I will.
If we didn't know, I'd ask her, "What's wrong?<eos> Why you being so quiet?"<eos> So ask. I'm afraid she'll make me.<eos> You're ex-CIA.<eos> She won't.
I'm just trying to give you a little context for this town, Detective.<eos> There are feuds out here that have been going on for almost a century.<eos> Between the Hodges and the Lockharts?<eos> Do yourself a favor. Read my book.<eos> Okay, I will.
They all think they're about to be rich.<eos> They've been making plans.<eos> When they find out...<eos> - Whey're not going to find out.<eos> - Of course they will.
It's too long to wait.<eos> We could take another shot at the leader.<eos> There's definitely something that she was holding back.<eos> You had thought she wouldn't rattle.<eos> She won't.
I wanted you to have it.<eos> Okay.<eos> I'll need it for my new office.<eos> You got a job?<eos> - Not yet, but I will. - Oh.
That man.<eos> Sidney Snow.<eos> Did you get him?<eos> Not yet, no.<eos> You will?
Not at all.<eos> It was sad, but... fun.<eos> Quinn, I'll just fuck it up.<eos> No, you won't.<eos> I will.
Definitely.<eos> That is Luison.<eos> - Monroe.<eos> - You were supposed to tell me when this guy was coming home!<eos> - Yeah, we will.
Mom. Are you alright?<eos> I can imagine the look on your father's face when he realized I'm not home.<eos> Why are you thinking about him?<eos> Do you think that if you ask questions you'll get answers?<eos> You won't.
You.<eos> Get behind the wheel.<eos> We're driving out of here together.<eos> No.<eos> You won't.
It was a definite match to Briscoe and Winthrop's birth mother.<eos> D.B., Winthrop was definitely at that convent.<eos> He was there searching for his brother.<eos> - We can't prove that, though, right?<eos> - Oh, we will.
I don't have time for this now.<eos> Ok, fine.<eos> Then make time for this.<eos> I'm telling your wife about us.<eos> No, you won't.
Oh, yeah.<eos> Those don't work.<eos> It's just there to scare off underage students.<eos> Well, listen, if you think of anything else that might be helpful, please, give us a call.<eos> I will.
Come here.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Daddy.<eos> Look, you promised me you'd sleep, Naomi.<eos> I will.
Fine, but I won't lie in court and I refuse to handle stolen goods.<eos> Cleo's Peng and this party's the last opportunity I'll have to pull her, but she thinks I'm as sexy as a shit in a lift.<eos> With a turn of phrase like that, I'm amazed she can resist you!<eos> I'll help you, babe!<eos> We all will.
Now give me the hint.<eos> Changed my mind.<eos> Seven minutes left.<eos> She's got to make a move, shake him up somehow.<eos> She will.
You always planned to kill him.<eos> He figured out I'd taken the money off the container before we even left port.<eos> He was angry.<eos> He got what he deserved.<eos> So will you.
Um, okay, here is my number if you need to reach me.<eos> Oh, I would like to request that you keep the door to my wig colosseum closed because, if I did not make it clear, this whole situation is on climate control and has an estimated value of 60 grand.<eos> $60,000?<eos> Okay, Kevin, I'm leaving. Get it.<eos> I will, baby.
How am I supposed to believe that?<eos> Please, please.<eos> OK.<eos> You need to leave right now.<eos> OK. OK. I will, but...
You attacked me just like you did your ex-boyfriend, and I had to defend myself.<eos> I had no choice but to kill you.<eos> I mean, after all, you and Kenneth have been stalking me.<eos> No... no one's gonna believe that.<eos> Yes, they will.
He knows many things.<eos> For example, he knows that if you deliver that hat...<eos> To the dark one, you will never find your happy ending.<eos> But if I give it to you...<eos> I will?
For busting me.<eos> For making me work harder.<eos> My career is about more than pleasing you.<eos> I should make a difference.<eos> Well, perhaps you won't.
You know, I like him an awful lot, and we... we have such fun dances.<eos> But tonight, the feeling between us kept getting stronger and stronger.<eos> Okay, it's been, like, 15 minutes.<eos> Karma, say something.<eos> Fine, I will.
~ You don't have a toy boy, do you?<eos> ~ No, it was a joke.<eos> I'll laugh about it later.<eos> Don't forget the card.<eos> I won't.
It was his doing.<eos> He's a good man, you know, and he'll make a good king.<eos> Your opinion is enough for me.<eos> And your lover, Lady Doutzen, when will she return to you?<eos> - She won't.
I had to lie about it.<eos> People who aren't like us wouldn't understand.<eos> Am I gonna have to go away one day?<eos> One day...<eos> We both will.
Theft of trade secrets?<eos> You're charging the company - J-Serve has stolen millions of dollars of intellectual property, Judge.<eos> The civil suit can't proceed until the criminal case has been resolved.<eos> Peter's introductory remarks will last approximately five minutes, and he won't stay on stage during Alicia's speech.<eos> - He won't?
Well...<eos> I am very proud and not at all surprised.<eos> I never really believed this could have happened.<eos> But you always did.<eos> And I always will.
I need answers, Bobby.<eos> Hey, Jake, it's me.<eos> Sorry I haven't had time to talk, but I was thinking, my place for dinner tonight?<eos> I'll cook.<eos> Okay, I won't.
I'm sure you can fit a small princess, too.<eos> Yes.<eos> Frozen by the Snow Queen.<eos> That's why we never found Anna.<eos> But now we will.
- Sure.<eos> - But yes, um... - Mm-hmm.<eos> I know--I do know that things have been slow here, but obviously, things are gonna pick right back up.<eos> - Yeah, we think so.<eos> - Yeah. Oh, they will.
The investigation of Conrad's murder was heating up.<eos> I had to lead them away from you.<eos> By handing them my knife?<eos> If they link that to me...<eos> They won't.
But they'll crucify him.<eos> Cary, they're crucifying you.<eos> Look, you have to tell them that you were under orders.<eos> I can't.<eos> Then I will.
He was always bringing the Mikorskis papers to sign, confusing them.<eos> You got a name on that lawyer?<eos> I may have his card in my office.<eos> Oh, I'll go with you.<eos> Of course, you will.
- Because he's mine.<eos> - Yours?<eos> He gave the orders, discredited you, and you want to protect him?<eos> This is not for you to do.<eos> But I will.
Who's trying to destroy your friend.<eos> We've been on opposite sides before.<eos> We've survived.<eos> We won't survive this.<eos> Neither will he.
I can call off the hit men 'cause Elizabeth North is already dead.<eos> Please be joking.<eos> Please have good news.<eos> A source close to Elizabeth tells us she keeps a secret apartment under an assumed name at the Findley.<eos> A love nest, if you will.
There's even a federal courthouse.<eos> He could be working for a foreign agency.<eos> The sushi manager doesn't know anything about him?<eos> No, and the shelters we talked to don't recognize him, either.<eos> But maybe their clients will.
There can't be a copy, not... not in one world.<eos> So if you took Mara home, then Audrey would get better?<eos> Possibly.<eos> Look, our best chance at fixing all of this is if you bring Mara to me.<eos> Then I will.
I guess it is.<eos> Cool, I've never gotten one of those.<eos> Bring it in. Bring it in, come on.<eos> I'm just scared that now that you have a beautiful house and a pool and this great new life that Roscoe will never want to come back to my place.<eos> Of course he will.
Just for a while, Mother;<eos> till little guy catch up us.<eos> I think we all agree that he will sleep in my room.<eos> - Only if the Elders says It's Okay.<eos> - They will.
It made you lie to me.<eos> You're not even here right now.<eos> You said you'd never leave me.<eos> I never left you.<eos> I never will.
Come on, this way.<eos> Everyone, into the barrels, quickly!<eos> - Are you mad?<eos> They'll find us.<eos> - No, no, they won't!
Favorited you.<eos> You deviate his orders.<eos> You betrayed his trust.<eos> Come back with me he will forgive you.<eos> But I will not.
And now come here.<eos> The Wizard has come.<eos> He is lifting the spell...<eos> He will find us!<eos> Yes... he will.
Hi, mate.<eos> Didn't we decide to stop calling him Fearless Leader somewhere around 1992?<eos> Old habits die hard.<eos> They'll be putting that on Gary's tombstone.<eos> No, they won't.
We are here to entertain the world... and to sell drinks and souvenirs.<eos> These kids better go get ready for the next show if they're going to entertain anybody.<eos> Will you watch us tonight?<eos> We put a new song in just for you.<eos> Of course I will!
It's okay, baby.<eos> No matter what anybody says, i.. Love you.<eos> Alright that's it.<eos> -More than anything in the world.<eos> And i always will.
Excuse me! - Can I have the check?<eos> - She doesn't need the check.<eos> She's joking.<eos> - Then go cup his ass.<eos> - Okay, I will.
And when time came at last for King Erik to sleep he took crown and seed with him for permanent keep.<eos> And as the king's bones slowly crumbled away truth became legend.<eos> Or so people say.<eos> What will happen when the giants come back?<eos> They won't, son.
-[girl] Put the hat on.<eos> [Max] No, I will not wear a hat.<eos> -[kids] Why?<eos> -[Max] Cause I'll muss my hair.<eos> -[kids] No, you won't.
It's more important than anything.<eos> [Max] Do you understand, Honey?<eos> I understand.<eos> [Max] I love you, baby.<eos> And I always will.
Okay?<eos> Julie...<eos> I have to go.<eos> You're not gonna shoot me.<eos> Yes. Yeah, I will.
At least I've got my classes to get my mind off things, but he's... did you ever try to talk to dad about things?<eos> Dad?<eos> I just have to be strong for him until he comes out of it.<eos> Yeah, but what if he doesn't?<eos> He will.
Pay-per-view! - It's gonna be real.<eos> Can you believe this?<eos> I'm not believing you brought this boy to the bar.<eos> We're going to the movies.<eos> We will.
- Your suit is pressed?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I had to call in a lot of favors to get you this interview.<eos> Be rested, be sharp, do not embarrass me.<eos> I won't.
Look, this may be amusing to you, but they'll come looking for me.<eos> You wanna fight me?<eos> Is that the test?<eos> To see if I'll attack an old man?<eos> Well, I won't.
Come over here!<eos> Where you going?<eos> Hey, don't be afraid.<eos> I'm not gonna eat you or anything.<eos> He will.
And then, I felt everything in me... just let go of everything I was holding onto so tightly... and it hit me that I don't have an intellectual reason.<eos> I trust myself, I trust my feelings.<eos> I'm not gonna try to be anything other than who I am anymore... and I hope you can accept that.<eos> I can.<eos> I will.
You tell me, then, what do I ignore?<eos> This?<eos> This destroys the Sudanese peace talks, this screws a source in Amman...<eos> The Times will redact the names.<eos> Yeah, but, what about him, will he?
I will not stand by and watch the only brother I've got risk his life chasing some impossible dream.<eos> I'm sorry, Theo.<eos> All of these people, they believe in me.<eos> Guy Gagné believes in me.<eos> Why won't you?
Might take a long time to fence, but after that's done, you'll receive your share by express mail.<eos> You can't put that money in a bank, Leslie.<eos> You can't go on a crazy shopping spree.<eos> Okay.<eos> But... How much will it...
There is a spark.<eos> Stay.<eos> Yeah, Mommy, stay!<eos> But if I stay, I'll have to find a job, get a visa...<eos> We will.
Not me.<eos> If I had more talent and could earn better money with something else, I would.<eos> How do you know you will make money here?<eos> You haven't yet.<eos> Not yet, but I will.
Do you slow dance?<eos> Sure.<eos> ♪ Suddenly life has new meaning to me ♪<eos> I don't remember Wattlesbrook teaching us that move.<eos> Yeah, neither will those posh boys up at the house.
- Wait.<eos> - In all its glory.<eos> Chester, look, I can't do this.<eos> Oh, okay.<eos> I will.
Of course I am going to let you out of there, mate.<eos> You've been a real good sport.<eos> But first I'm going to grab us another drink.<eos> You're going to let me go now?<eos> Yeah, of course I will.
Half a pound is enough for two.<eos> I could eat a pound of mackerel by myself.<eos> I'll keep holding your hand.<eos> You should sleep. - You won't let go?<eos> - No, I won't.

Did you have a good chat with Norton?<eos> And he told you what he saw?<eos> Well...what was it?<eos> You might misunderstand.<eos> Of course, I won't.
I'd love to...<eos> Now hand over my baby.<eos> Bo promised...<eos> She promised nothing would happen to my baby.<eos> Then nothing will.
No, mom.<eos> I don't want your forgiveness.<eos> I came to forgive you... and tell you that I love you.<eos> Both of you.<eos> And I always will.
Many surprises for her.<eos> How am I supposed to sit here planning a war when you're over there looking like that?<eos> Will you come with me one day to Volantis?<eos> When all this is over?<eos> I will.
I can do that.<eos> - What's your last name?<eos> - And you can go to Japan? - Wherever.<eos> - How about your friend?<eos> - Of course, he will.
You already are.<eos> How would you know he won't come looking for you?<eos> But he won't, will he?<eos> No.<eos> He won't
Bed and breakfast in Scotland.<eos> I am not taking my pants off for Scotland.<eos> But it's all we can afford.<eos> Take off your pants.<eos> I will not.
It's a bit bloody late for that.<eos> Do you think it'll work?<eos> It'll buy us a few hours.<eos> He'll see you.<eos> No, he won't.
Let him keep it for now.<eos> At least we know where it is.<eos> And besides...the key is useless without its counterpart.<eos> And what if Da Vinci obtains that?<eos> He won't.
Well, apparently I can, and you should find a way out as well.<eos> Hey, I'm not like you.<eos> This is my big break.<eos> It may never happen again.<eos> Of course it will.

It's almost midnight.<eos> - I don't want to stop working.<eos> - Neither do I.<eos> We shouldn't let our momentum die.<eos> We won't.
Well, that's kind of a simplification.<eos> Is it, though?<eos> You died, Leena died, and now, the whole damn world is dying.<eos> Claud, Claud, Claud, Pete and Myka will find a cure.<eos> - They will.
You are a genius.<eos> Absolute brilliance.<eos> Thanks for watching them.<eos> - Say hi to your mom from me.<eos> - I will.
Nothing funny.<eos> Googliness.<eos> The intangible stuff that made a search engine into an engine for change.<eos> Now, you will be divided into teams and by the end of the summer only one team will be guaranteed a full-time position.<eos> The other 95% of you... will not.
(Laughs)<eos> Insanity is, of course, another defense at our disposal.<eos> You are demented if you think these charges will simply vanish.<eos> They must.<eos> They will.
You might be right.<eos> He's on the move.<eos> Maestro, look, we've been following Riario for days.<eos> - If he sees us...<eos> - He won't.
It erm... possesses a peculiar saltiness.<eos> Don't bother, Nico.<eos> He doesn't know.<eos> Wouldn't reveal anything even if he did.<eos> - Yes, he will.
He is happier than even we are, With our boat and... These goods.<eos> Even so, he was my kinsman.<eos> We must avenge his death. It was done in the name of king Aelle,<eos> And king Aelle must suffer for it.<eos> One day, he will... If the gods will it.
He's strange that way.<eos> Well...<eos> Even if we don't die, they will still shun us like a bad smell.<eos> And they'll make it so we have to leave here, even though they know no one else will take us in.<eos> They won't.
But Kenya's back there.<eos> There's half a squad between us.<eos> She's smart.<eos> She'll go to the river.<eos> No, she won't!

Do it, Sergeant!<eos> No!<eos> Stop!<eos> You will tell me?<eos> I will!
Yes.<eos> I'm with someone else now.<eos> You know that.<eos> But I feel an infinite tenderness for you.<eos> I always will.
Did you know that... if you take every single person killed in a terrorist act around the world in the last 20 years and you add to that all the lives lost in the Middle East since 1967, the Six Day War,<eos> and you add to that every single American life lost in Vietnam, in Korea, and in every single American engagement since then...<eos> Iraq, Afghanistan... if you take all those lives and you multiply it by two, that's the number of children that die of malaria every single year.<eos> So are you saying you'll help me?<eos> Yes, I will.
Okay, I guess--I guess you really are feeling okay.<eos> Now, look, I know this all sounds really cool, right? Yeah.<eos> But it's also a lot of responsibility.<eos> New York is an intense place, and you're gonna have to prove to me that you can handle it.<eos> I will.

Of course it is.<eos> I thought you might need it.<eos> I know how you feel the cold.<eos> They'll steal it.<eos> No, they won't.
Ah, I have cousins there.<eos> They have a fine orchestra.<eos> If they won't have me, it will mean a cap on the pavement.<eos> Will you go back to fight this war, Colonel?<eos> We both will.

I saw your face when that child was born.<eos> You were distraught, Nurse Lee, as every midwife has been before you.<eos> God help us, we're only human.<eos> But your guilt will not help the mother to bond.<eos> What will?
No, we have to call Shirley about this.<eos> You call her, she'll call the Treatment Centre and they'll take him away.<eos> Do you want that?<eos> We can't lose him again, Sue.<eos> We won't.

This pen, for example, had traces of a type known as permanent fluorescing ink, imperceptible to the human eye, and revealed only under an ultraviolet light.<eos> Now, I went to the morgue this morning, and I shone Teri's hand under a UV lamp.<eos> Even after the wash, her palm was covered in the stuff.<eos> And when she struggled with you, she got it all over your clothes.<eos> Captain, if you will?
Thank you.<eos> Hey, look, while you're here, could you deal with all the illegal parking on this street?<eos> I take photos of them.<eos> It's worth a shot.<eos> Absolutely, we will, mm-hmm.

He'll have a new identity and all the paperwork for you by tomorrow.<eos> Do I get to pick my name?<eos> I doubt it, but I'll ask.<eos> So does he drop it off, or--<eos> No, I will.
You sure can pick 'em.<eos> Listen, do me a favor.<eos> Either of you hear from your old friend Hannah McKay, you give me a call.<eos> - Of course.<eos> - Yeah, we will.
The consortium will pull out if there are any more delays.<eos> They said that?<eos> Threatened to back a mine in Australia.<eos> We can't afford anything else to go wrong.<eos> It won't.

Claud.<eos> Claud, I'm really sorry.<eos> It's not your fault.<eos> I'm counting on you to stop this guy more than anybody, okay?<eos> I will.
I can't tell you that.<eos> Jimmy, you have to tell me that.<eos> Mike, come on.<eos> If they knew it came from me--<eos> They won't.
No, he's a stickler.<eos> Don't be late, don't be sloppy, don't be disrespectful, and he'll love you, just like he loves me.<eos> Since you know him so well, would you do me the honor of signing on as first chair?<eos> I can.<eos> And I will.
He threatened our firm.<eos> And on top of that, he tried to show Sloane Moseley what she'd be in for her if this goes to trial.<eos> So I'm just returning the favor.<eos> Yeah, well, it didn't seem to have much of an effect on him. Trust me.<eos> It will.
Amanda targeting the Director of the CIA?<eos> That's a little crazy, even for her.<eos> Amanda targeting our closest ally in the government-- it's not so crazy.<eos> We need to get those files.<eos> We will.
You're actually thinking about going through with this?<eos> I'm innocent, remember?<eos> I got a whole secret agency trying to prove that.<eos> And I believe if I take the heat off of them, they'll return the favor.<eos> We will.
Okay, listen, I will not have you undermine me with Catherine.<eos> - Will you be wanting a clutch?<eos> - I will.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - I will not.
- I will.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - I will not.<eos> - Oh, you don't?<eos> - No, no, I will.
- No.<eos> I need a miracle.<eos> - There's no such thing as miracles.<eos> We'll never sell those 300 copies.<eos> I will.
I insist you concentrate.<eos> Okay.<eos> Uh, excuse me.<eos> Riley made you her manager?<eos> Yes, she will.
Lying again.<eos> Find a woman.<eos> Yeah, you know what?<eos> You're right.<eos> I will.
I'll have Karl sit on Stephen Doppler's hotel.<eos> I'll take Melissa Enfield.<eos> We'll be in radio contact the entire time.<eos> If Lorelei tries to go after one of them--<eos> She will.
No, you need my help now.<eos> Police are closing in.<eos> There's nothing I can do.<eos> Do they know I'm here?<eos> No, not yet, but they soon will.
Henry, I miss you very much and I would have come sooner, but I have been made to live very far away from you.<eos> It is punishment for my loyalties.<eos> Henry, the wicked York king, has taken your title.<eos> But we will get it back for you.<eos> We will.
So take a hard look, because this is your future.<eos> This is you.<eos> You're wrong.<eos> He won't hurt me.<eos> He won't.
I'm lucky you're here with me.<eos> Yeah.<eos> And I'll get through it. I'll get back on track.<eos> They won't even find out I was using.<eos> Yes, they will.
Thank you.<eos> Is Cora trying to control you with the dagger?<eos> Oh, you'd know if she was, and most of you would be dead by now.<eos> Well, then we'll just have to take the fight to her before that can happen.<eos> We will.
Tests of my sobriety arise almost daily.<eos> You were just the most recent.<eos> Hey.<eos> I believe in you.<eos> Always will.
You are monstrous in the eyes of God for what you've done with him.<eos> You are the monster for murdering my poor brother!<eos> You know nothing!<eos> My son will never marry you.<eos> Yes, he will.
Were those gunshots?<eos> Oh, who knows with these people? It's one calamity after another.<eos> Yes, exactly, that's why you need a nice, long, relaxing cruise.<eos> But I really, really, really don't think I'll enjoy it.<eos> Sure you will.
We both know killing her will cost you the thing you want most...<eos> Henry.<eos> Why don't you just give up this obsession with vengeance?<eos> You know it can never make you happy.<eos> Yes, it will.
Yeah.<eos> This town's lousy with magic.<eos> Now you should go. If Neal suspects anything, it's gonna make everything we have to do that much harder.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> He won't.
Actually, now you know a lot more.<eos> So do we have a deal?<eos> I can't leave without knowing what you're doing here.<eos> Sure, you can.<eos> And you will.
People that know that magic is real.<eos> And that it doesn't belong in this world and are willing to do something about it.<eos> This little quest of yours to cleanse the world of magic...<eos> It's not gonna work.<eos> No, of course it will.
He beat you.<eos> Now this guy has some powerful magic, mate.<eos> He's untouchable.<eos> You'll never get another chance to take him down.<eos> Oh, I will.
Now this guy has some powerful magic, mate.<eos> He's untouchable.<eos> You'll never get another chance to take him down.<eos> Oh, I will.<eos> I will indeed.
- Please.<eos> - Um... - Yeah, take a sip.<eos> Okay, look, I think you're amazing.<eos> Would you like to have a drink with me?<eos> Yes, yes, I will.
I am fine!<eos> You wouldn't let me out.<eos> - I was partly joking!<eos> - Nick, we will talk about this in the morning.<eos> Yes, we will.
We better keep an eye on her.<eos> We're not going to hurt her or you.<eos> We just need to know what we need to know.<eos> Clients... I talk about 'em, they come back and make sure I can't talk again.<eos> This one won't.
The forms I e-mailed you last week.<eos> No. I haven't.<eos> Okay, well, you know they're to protect the baby in case something happens to either one of us, so I'm just...<eos> I'm gonna need your signature.<eos> Okay, I will.
Nice.<eos> It's the outline of a novel.<eos> There's more to write.<eos> But I won't write it.<eos> Raymond will.
Trying to keep my mind occupied.<eos> I heard about this fight between you and Diego.<eos> Yeah. It's just something that I gotta do, you know?<eos> You sure you want to do this?<eos> You will, for your brother.
The agent who died because of you had a wife and a six-year-old son.<eos> And you think this is the justice that they were looking for?<eos> No, but it prevents others from needing to seek justice at all.<eos> This must end.<eos> It won't.
They're, uh... waiting for me.<eos> Well, then, you have to get back to them.<eos> I want you to know...<eos> I love you, Aaron.<eos> I always will.
We will get him.<eos> He's a bad guy, and we will get him.<eos> We just have to do it the right way.<eos> Okay.<eos> Yeah, we will.
How long you been working at that gym?<eos> You see him every day.<eos> I-- I see a lot of people.<eos> We're gonna find your prints on that weapon.<eos> N-no, you won't.
Tonight, at Waterman Cable, when everyone else leaves, I will stay and work eight additional hours.<eos> For no pay!<eos> Strictly for honor!<eos> But Waterman-san will catch you and look at you silently for a moment!<eos> He will not.
Look, given that you were held at gunpoint in this very room little over a week ago, I thought, perhaps, a test of your ability to defend yourself was in order.<eos> It was.<eos> You have much to learn about the art of self-preservation.<eos> Okay, if you ever do that again, I swear...<eos> You'll what?
This is the best one.<eos> No one'll ask questions.<eos> Ok. If you burn down the house, it'll be gone.<eos> What if one day when this is all over, you want to come home again?<eos> I won't.
It turns out that employer I.D. number is for a security company named Griffin-Moore, which is linked to the 50th floor of the Empire State Building.<eos> Let's get that box and bring my father home.<eos> 13 bucks for an ice cream?<eos> Gluten-and dairy-free -- you won't find that in Kansas.<eos> Yes, I will.
To show the cardinals he was trying to prevent it, all the while assuming- What, that we'd totally bl-ow my God he assumed we'd totally blow it?<eos> ! Well... ISIS has a certain reputation.<eos> Hey, whoa! Not cool, Payne Stewart!<eos> Oh, my God, if Malory ever hears about this -<eos> Which she won't!
Bodes well for the post-conference room meeting.<eos> All depends on the conference room meeting itself.<eos> - Is that them again? - Yeah.<eos> Maybe you should call back.<eos> I will.
I wanted your advice on something. And to remind you about the haircut.<eos> Is that mine?<eos> I never recognize the ringtone.<eos> Shaul, you said you"d change it.<eos> I will.
I can't go home.<eos> As soon as I set foot in my country... I'm going to be killed.<eos> ♪ Blue Bloods 3x15 ♪ Warriors Original Air Date on February 15, 2013<eos> I can assure you that nothing came from this office.<eos> Nor will anything.
But you're out of the doghouse with Jessica?<eos> Out.<eos> What?<eos> You never said how it went with Manningham.<eos> And I never will.
Silver, this wouldn't happen to have anything to do with you and Mark, would it?<eos> I mean, you know the last time you and Ade fought over a guy.<eos> I know.<eos> And I have to handle it, like, now.<eos> And I will.
I command it.<eos> You do not command me.<eos> I am your MOTHER!<eos> Yes, and I am the KING!<eos> You will!
And just before she died...<eos> Vic said that she hoped you might be the one to carry it on.<eos> - Carry on with what?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> I will.
- The price was right.<eos> We don't all have a misi like yours.<eos> But when you come back, you'll be a free man, won't you?<eos> When I come back... if I ever come back.<eos> - Of course you will.
No. That's none of my business.<eos> Dude, look, you can stay here, we can go shoot guns, you can help me set up my maple syrup taps, but you have to talk to my sister.<eos> Communication is key, man.<eos> I know. I know.<eos> I will. I just...
Gates will see.<eos> I don't care.<eos> I can't believe this is happening.<eos> We're gonna find her, Castle.<eos> We will.
So, for the sake of your chum, I suggest you find out what's going on.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Did you need to go in the other one?<eos> They're both mine.<eos> Yes, we will.
Yeah, well, not everybody does the Reagan bidding. Really?<eos> That's all you have?<eos> Miss Reagan?<eos> You try taking my picture again, I will shove that camera...<eos> Hey, he won't.
You know what I think?<eos> I think it's a shakedown.<eos> I'm not gonna let that happen, Sean.<eos> Yolanda?<eos> No, you won't, Ray.
Please, stay calm, Margaret.<eos> It will be no hardship, Mother.<eos> You are my son.<eos> He will stay with me.<eos> He will not.
I don't have a wife, so...<eos> You should stop talking.<eos> So, I'm not speaking from experience.<eos> So you should really stop talking.<eos> But you won't.
Will do.<eos> Where are you going?<eos> To follow him.<eos> What if he makes you?<eos> He won't.
Perfect.<eos> I keep checking to see if something's changed, if somehow he knows his mother's... gone, but...<eos> He's too little.<eos> He couldn't possibly understand.<eos> He will one day.
Could you give us a second, please?<eos> I was hoping you'd come.<eos> I wanted to say good-bye this time.<eos> "Good-bye" makes me feel like I'll never see you again.<eos> You won't.
Trick question.<eos> He doesn't have any allergies.<eos> If I eat peanuts, I'll die!<eos> That's right.<eos> He will.
In an investigation, one dude always has to go opposite the other dude.<eos> That's how they get things done.<eos> Well, you guys can work it out.<eos> - Yeah, we will.<eos> - No, we won't.
Oh, here it is. Okay.<eos> - You want to hear my pitch?<eos> - Mmm-hmm.<eos> A strong, independent woman, starting her own business.<eos> An "entrepreneu-her," if you will.
No.<eos> I just keep thinking... what if somebody shoots Henry?<eos> No one's gonna do that.<eos> - But they could.<eos> - But they won't.
Maybe we're going about this whole morality thing the wrong way.<eos> - We have nothing on these guys. - Doesn't matter. - What if they call our bluff?<eos> - They won't.<eos> - What if they do?<eos> - They won't.
All the dirt we spent the past week digging up on every single one of you. Dirty dirt. Filthy dirt.<eos> Some of it is illegal, and some of it's just downright disgusting.<eos> I'm talking "no amount of Lysol's gonna clean that corporate jet" disgusting.<eos> You know what he's talking about, right? - Actually, I don't.<eos> - Oh, soon you will.
Well, you just gotta tell him straight up, man to man.<eos> Woman to man.<eos> You're very shapely.<eos> I know.<eos> I will.
Don't worry, I'll take care of your lizard.<eos> Ah! Beer!<eos> Just what I need.<eos> You won't come back, will you?<eos> Yeah, of course I will.
Ah! Beer!<eos> Just what I need.<eos> You won't come back, will you?<eos> Yeah, of course I will.<eos> No, you won't.
I used to find them hanging out down here<eos> Turn off the car<eos> You can explain what really happened<eos> They'll believe you<eos> No, they won't
I mean, he hasn't really said much.<eos> I'm gonna fly him up to Atlanta with me... have him help me pack up the apartment.<eos> It'll give us a chance to talk.<eos> Well, let me know if there's anything I can do.<eos> I will.
'Cause if it's not, then don't worry about it.<eos> What's so funny?<eos> ! Hey, everybody, volcano-girl here is gonna blow our minds.<eos> Did you hear that, Tom?<eos> Well, I will!
Christine got excited.<eos> It doesn't mean that she bit Emma.<eos> Better not take her to daycare for a while.<eos> I'll just tell them that you did it while we were making love.<eos> No, you won't.
You go home!<eos> Gunnar! You go in there, I am going in there with you!<eos> Somebody in there knows exactly what's happened to Jason.<eos> And the police will find them.<eos> They won't!
Things have blown up with Jen.<eos> Just-- just can't get into it right now.<eos> James, right now we need to find this car.<eos> - We need to find Adrian.<eos> - And we will.
So we know who killed Chris.<eos> Oh, God.<eos> Thank God.<eos> Yeah. Don't have him yet.<eos> But you will, right?
And Mr. Purcell...<eos> I've given you latitude already. Don't abuse it.<eos> 'Scuse me.<eos> So, wait, you think maybe this means he won't call me to the stand?<eos> Oh, no, he will.
Some fresh coffee, Mr Molesley.<eos> Shut the door. My God!<eos> Shut the door!<eos> Will you help me? Will you find me some clothes?<eos> Of course I will but...
I don't know what to do.<eos> There is no such thing as a marriage between two intelligent people that does not sometimes have to negotiate thin ice.<eos> I know.<eos> You must wait until things become clear.<eos> And they will.
We have to go to some stupid ceremony?<eos> Nope, I'm picking up my diploma at the guidance office and getting the hell out of there.<eos> There's no ceremony in the fall.<eos> He'll walk with everyone in the spring.<eos> - No, he won't.
So?<eos> We're living together.<eos> We're already saying that we're married.<eos> Come on, show it to me.<eos> All right, maybe I will.
Did you know that your mom's going back to her maiden name?<eos> It's... it's like she's saying that we were never married.<eos> It makes me super sad.<eos> You should tell her how you feel.<eos> Maybe I will, Sarah.
Let's just go.<eos> Let's just get out of here.<eos> - Point Break style?<eos> - No, no, no!<eos> I will Point Break style this moment!
From Paris he has to make it to the unoccupied part.<eos> To Marseille.<eos> After that he's on his own.<eos> If I see him again...<eos> You won't.
The pool's for residents only.<eos> Oh, okay.<eos> Sorry.<eos> We'll leave.<eos> Uh, no, we won't.
It's you.<eos> Your majesty.<eos> I didn't do anything wrong.<eos> But I will say that I am guilty if I can just pay the fine and go home.<eos> No, you won't.
We wait till dark, head down to the farm, cop for whoever's there.<eos> Burn the place down ourselves.<eos> Did you not hear the news?<eos> It won't work, mate.<eos> Course it will.
Hup! How dare you?<eos> I'm the Queen of England.<eos> I'm not English.<eos> Elizabeth, will you marry me?<eos> Oh, my dear sweet love, of course I will.
You have no idea.<eos> They buy me a new BMW for my birthday but can I get seat warmers?<eos> No.<eos> "Rajesh, if you want a warm butt, you're gonna have to pay for it yourself."<eos> Well, maybe I will, old man!
Oh, gross, man. Don't you ever power wash your patio?<eos> It's fine.<eos> It's totally edible.<eos> Really? Then eat it.<eos> Well, I will,
Hey, you got a hole-in-one on 18, so I'm supposed to give you this.<eos> No, he gets the dragon too?<eos> A fine trophy.<eos> - I think I'll keep it in the office.<eos> - No, you won't.
No.<eos> No, Sharon.<eos> Obviously, I don't want that to happen.<eos> But even-- even if I-I plead the Fifth or whatever, people will find out about me.<eos> They will.
How you understand your job, that is the point.<eos> Sometimes you're not gonna like yourself very much for the decisions you have to make; knowing how the men feel about the decision you made... but you're gonna have to make that tough decision again and again because that is the job you accepted.<eos> I get that.<eos> No, you don't.<eos> But you will.
Is this me?<eos> Yup.<eos> That's why, you're kind of cute. you're kind of cute.<eos> I wish I could open my eyes and see.<eos> You will soon.
Nothing happened?<eos> Nothing at all?<eos> But it must happen.<eos> For the sake of both our families, it must happen.<eos> And it will!
Nothing at all?<eos> But it must happen.<eos> For the sake of both our families, it must happen.<eos> And it will!<eos> Yes, it most certainly will.
What about Lucrezia?<eos> She must be told.<eos> I will tell her.<eos> No.<eos> I will.
Do they know what they have in you?<eos> I know what I have in them.<eos> So, have you decided whether or not you will come to the ball?<eos> Oh, how can you ask?<eos> Of course I will!
I'll er... send a letter to myself tonight and tell Marjie it's about an old friend of mine who's died and asked for me to take the child.<eos> She won't question it.<eos> Then nobody but you and I will know.<eos> Mr Drewe, would you do that for me?<eos> For you and the little girl, My Lady, yes, I will.
I'm sorry.<eos> Freddy, he was my partner, and he was my friend, but he wouldn't be dead if it weren't for this dome.<eos> You're gonna have to tell Rusty.<eos> He'll understand.<eos> Like hell he will!
The thing is, it's not really him that I'm asking for, it's for me, for my friends.<eos> - Vampire friends.<eos> - They're all gonna die.<eos> You realize Bill wants to kill me.<eos> He won't.
I love you.<eos> Yes?<eos> Pick me up in an hour.<eos> - What if he wakes up?<eos> - He won't.
What's the big deal?<eos> Every life matters.<eos> Throw it back.<eos> What if it don't work out?<eos> Well, hey, it will.
Mossad was tracking blood diamonds that were being used to finance terrorist activity.<eos> That's good work, Ziva.<eos> Come on, let's go home, get some rest.<eos> You, too, McGee.<eos> I will.
(Josh) Here.<eos> Put that on.<eos> Ew, this is gross.<eos> It'll save your life.<eos> No, it won't.
I bet you'll find two sets of DNA on there, hers and her murderer's...<eos> Congressman Oliver Dawson.<eos> All right.<eos> I'll take it down to the lab right away.<eos> No, you won't.
Let's go away.<eos> Come with me to Paris.<eos> Say, "Yes."<eos> Yes.<eos> You won't, will you?
I had no choice.<eos> General Shaw is a traitor.<eos> You know, I admire your patriotism, Harker.<eos> If anyone should even suspect that I had anything to do with this...<eos> They won't.
This was wayne's show.<eos> He wanted somebody to slow you down so he could get away, And I volunteered.<eos> Anything to get away from that madman.<eos> I ain't trying to die out here.<eos> Now you won't.
Tonight... (whispers): please don't go.<eos> ♪ 'Cause I can't make you love me ♪<eos> ♪ If you don't<eos> ♪ You can't make your heart<eos> I won't.
Get back here.<eos> You can't tell her.<eos> I have to.<eos> She's my friend.<eos> So... I will.
The lie we live by.<eos> I need you to keep your promise.<eos> To always protect him.<eos> And me.<eos> I will.
You gonna watch her die, son?<eos> I think you're out of moves.<eos> No, you're wrong.<eos> You didn't want anybody to see what was on there anyway, right?<eos> Now nobody ever will.
I miss her already.<eos> I know how you feel.<eos> I miss Leonard, too.<eos> What's... what is wrong with me? Why-why can't I ever have love?<eos> You will.
Pseudorealism versus true realism.<eos> What's the difference?<eos> Honestly, I have no idea.<eos> You know, the film you're shooting won't survive a nuclear attack.<eos> Nothing will.
on your resume than an internship in a state senator's office?<eos> Regina: It's the type of job most high school kids get.<eos> Plus she got this one herself.<eos> What if Bay decides she wants to move in - with Regina for good?<eos> - She won't.
Talking to me?<eos> I'll take that as a no.<eos> So another Sunday watching roller bladers in the park.<eos> I thought we might change it up.<eos> We will.
Argh! I can't do this.<eos> Um, if I don't get that research pack on my desk today, I'm the one who has to explain to Mr Reid tomorrow.<eos> It's me that's going to look bad.<eos> Please don't let me down.<eos> I won't.
You have a beautiful family.<eos> Don't let Mickey poison this.<eos> I saw something in you, Raymond.<eos> Don't let me down.<eos> I won't.
Oh, what are we going to do?<eos> Hmm... we tell them the truth.<eos> Let them know what's really at stake if you don't get the crown tonight.<eos> They'll help us figure something out.<eos> But what if they won't?
I tell you what.<eos> You sell my house.<eos> Burn the whole place down.<eos> I don't care, 'cause right here, this is where I'm gonna be, and if Rayna doesn't pull through,<eos> - She will.
No, we found you.<eos> And lost Henry and Neal and countless other people!<eos> Emma, the minute I let go of the belief that things will get better is the minute I know they won't.<eos> We'll find Henry.<eos> No, you won't.
You know, when she brings dinner over and you're not here, I feel obliged to have seconds.<eos> Well, you shouldn't feel obligated to do anything on her account.<eos> It'd be a lot easier if you two just occasionally crossed paths.<eos> You really should make more of an effort with her, Bill.<eos> I will.
- Yeah, sure.<eos> So promise me this will not happen again.<eos> I promise.<eos> - Because, if it does...<eos> - It won't.
Here, between these walls.<eos> This is your new home.<eos> You will eat here, sleep here, shit here, die here.<eos> Carrie won't save you.<eos> No one will.
I know how important this is to you.<eos> I owe you.<eos> We all do.<eos> Yeah, well, as long as we get the real bomber...<eos> We will.
Methadone would make it easier.<eos> Has to be cold turkey.<eos> Where he's going, we need him functional.<eos> Even if it kills him?<eos> It won't.
SONYA: David Tate was here that day.<eos> Come on.<eos> SONYA: What are you doing?<eos> MARCO: What if we can't find him?<eos> SONYA: We will.
Mary, where are you?<eos> I can't tell you that, John.<eos> They...<eos> They won't let me tell you.<eos> All right, okay, of course they won't.
See, the thing is, I can hold you accountable, me being a copper and all that.<eos> - Give me that camera!<eos> - Oh, I don't think so.<eos> Give me that camera or I will shoot him!<eos> No, you won't, Thomas.
Welcome back, Mr. Henry.<eos> I'm Kay, your new segment producer.<eos> - Potential new segment producer.<eos> - Right. I've got to earn it.<eos> And I will.
I can't explain it, but it's like I can feel him. He's trying to reach out to me, but I don't know where he is, and I can't understand what he's trying to say.<eos> All I know is that he's scared, and he's lonely, and he's in a lot of pain.<eos> He's in a lot of pain.<eos> We have to find him.<eos> We will.
What if it's still alive?<eos> What if I lift the couch and it starts flipping around?<eos> I'm not your boyfriend.<eos> Maybe I'll make it worth your while if you come over.<eos> No, you won't.
I'll see what I can do...<eos> But ultimately, it's up to you.<eos> I can't make people trust you, Lenny.<eos> You have to earn that.<eos> I will.
All I need is his pin.<eos> Or hers.<eos> They'll think it's online fraud or hackers.<eos> But what if they found out?<eos> They won't.
I promise not to talk about Dad.<eos> Okay.<eos> Thanks again.<eos> I hope these work.<eos> Oh, they will.
She can't.<eos> We'll keep them safe.<eos> You're not that woman who was too scared to be alone, not anymore.<eos> You're gonna start over, find others, people who don't know, and you're gonna survive out here.<eos> You will.
Don't doubt yourself.<eos> We don't get to anymore.<eos> Rick, the cluster's getting bigger than the one that took the fence down.<eos> - We need to do something.<eos> - We will.
You still believe that crap?<eos> After what he did to our family?<eos> - I know killing is wrong, that's all.<eos> - We take him to a hospital he turns Bunch in for shooting him.<eos> - Maybe he won't.
After what he did to our family?<eos> - I know killing is wrong, that's all.<eos> - We take him to a hospital he turns Bunch in for shooting him.<eos> - Maybe he won't.<eos> Oh, he will.
It was my very real privilege to have met you, sir.<eos> You need to step up!<eos> He is your responsibility!<eos> Oh, fine!<eos> Fine. I'll...
- Like you and Bob Scott.<eos> - Yes.<eos> Bob Scott was with you on Clyde Ritter's detail.<eos> He let you down, Sean.<eos> And you won't, Edgar.
Granted, I know how much you'll miss working with me.<eos> GAALAN: I'll take it back to the Kings.<eos> I think they'll let you walk away if they know you're doubling their business.<eos> - JAX: It's not gonna get doubled.<eos> - GAALAN: Yes, it will.
And it really fucked up me.<eos> How's Ray feel about it?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Why don't you fucking ask him?<eos> All right, I will.
- We split, or let's go together to get...<eos> - Wood, fire...<eos> Who wants to do mushrooms?<eos> - Mushrooms.<eos> - I will.
He Googles me every morning.<eos> He's gonna understand.<eos> - He will.<eos> - Not deep down.<eos> No one will.
Nothing!<eos> I can't tell her.<eos> She's your best friend.<eos> You have to tell her.<eos> And I will!
Am I supposed to respond to that?<eos> Yeah, by going back to your desk right now and doing it correctly.<eos> But--<eos> Simon, a memo from Nigel is not gonna stick its boot in your ass.<eos> A memo from me will.
Okay, you know what,<eos> I'm not gonna let you shatter the glass that I spent years blowing.<eos> And I'm certainly not gonna let the likes of you tell me who I can and cannot blow.<eos> He's not gonna come.<eos> He will.
Casey's going back to Afghanistan.<eos> - For how long?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> He said he hadn't decided whether to re-enlist.<eos> - He will, unless...
- I want to know who leaked the story.<eos> The campaign's happy to announce the results of the latest New Hampshire Journal poll, which has Governor Romney in the lead with 37% of New Hampshire's likely Republican voters, well ahead of Rick Perry with 18%,<eos> Ron Paul with 14%, then Michele Bachmann and Herman Cain.<eos> You forgot about Huntsman, Gingrich, and Santorum.<eos> - And soon you will, too.
The rest of the press corps got an advanced copy.<eos> - Why didn't you?<eos> - I wasn't on the bus.<eos> You said this stunt wasn't gonna fuck anything up.<eos> - It won't.
Let's all of us hope he'll be out of our lives again soon.<eos> Hardcastle will want alibis for everyone.<eos> We were all together last night, of course, except for you, Colonel, and your night-time excursion.<eos> I'm sure you'll be able to offer him a full explanation as to where you went.<eos> I will.
You find anything yet?<eos> Yeah, I'm still looking.<eos> We're on our way to the office now, check out some more want ads.<eos> Well, I'm sure you're gonna find something.<eos> 'Course we will.
This is gonna loosen you up.<eos> It's a chemical relative of benzodiazepine... mixed with a synthetic hallucinogen.<eos> Drugs will only make this more complicated.<eos> I'll tell you whatever you want to know.<eos> Yes, you will.
Frank, stop it, you're drunk.<eos> Just calm down!<eos> Nate, go next door, now.<eos> He'll hurt you.<eos> No, he won't.
Oh, bloody hell!<eos> Oh!<eos> CAR SKIDS 'Mr Smalltalk had completely forgotten not go on about himself.'<eos> The important thing is not to panic, cos everyone thinks helicopters will just fall out the sky if the engine fails.<eos> They won't.
And the best thing is, you don't have to say anything.<eos> You just have to look handsome.<eos> And you've got that covered.<eos> Yeah, well, what makes you think she's gonna bid on me?<eos> She won't.
You can't.<eos> She can't even walk.<eos> That's the most idiotic thing I've ever heard.<eos> - But they'll come.<eos> - No, they won't!
He's put away more guys in a year than people do in their entire careers.<eos> This guy saved my life.<eos> He deserves our help.<eos> Then we'll help him.<eos> We will?
But since you're so into barbecues, and they're so important to you, I thought I'd give them a shot.<eos> [Whispering] They're talking about you.<eos> I would love it if you both could stay.<eos> Why, thank you, Collin.<eos> We will.
Thank you.<eos> And why's she playing G.I. Joe?<eos> No clue.<eos> Why don't you ask her when we find her?<eos> Oh, I will.
I'm not leaving without you.<eos> Do your job!<eos> Bob!<eos> Cops are gonna be coming down that ramp any second.<eos> No, they won't.
Annie Walker no longer works in your department.<eos> I'll transfer her out.<eos> Now you can turn your attention to other matters of DPD concern.<eos> Okay.<eos> I certainly will.
Please, I got people from the City Council calling me, diplomats from the State Department.<eos> It's like half the traders on wall street bought one of those cars.<eos> We're done. I can't go to this kid's father and tell him we have the guy who murdered his son.<eos> I can't do that.<eos> Then I will.
It's part of um... a... campaign.<eos> A well-orchestrated plan.<eos> When were you going to tell me about this plan?<eos> Trust me on this, you'll know soon enough.<eos> Everyone will.
You leave and there's no one else here to stop the others from continuing to change history.<eos> There's every chance that you return to 2077 to find nobody waiting for you.<eos> No Greg, no Sam, maybe nothing at all.<eos> I can't accept that, Alec.<eos> And I won't.
- Wait up, Dyson is still...?<eos> - Looking for Lauren.<eos> Yeah. - Glad to see your love life finally got less complicated.<eos> - He has to find her.<eos> - He will.
Appreciate it.<eos> I'm heading west with the U.P.<eos> Good night then.<eos> I'll see your Pacific one day, Mr. Huntington.<eos> Yes, you will, Mr. Bohannon, one way or the other.
Victor is gonna be very happy to see you.<eos> Great work.<eos> Thanks.<eos> You should celebrate.<eos> He will.
This is where we learn if you are the man you say you are.<eos> I've done everything you've asked of me.<eos> That should count for something.<eos> I'll tell you whatever you want to know.<eos> Yes, you will.
They'll be mad, but they'll forgive me.<eos> Yeah, but Jo might not!<eos> Jo?<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> Of course she will.
What are you talking about?<eos> Of course she will.<eos> I mean, it'll be weird,<eos> - but she'll understand.<eos> - No no, she won't!
That makes one of us.<eos> China!<eos> Go ahead, waste your arrows.<eos> That hurt, but it won't stop me.<eos> That will.
That won't be for another five years.<eos> I'm aware of that.<eos> But it's still good to know.<eos> We'll pull through, right?<eos> Of course we will.
Except for the delay, nothing has changed.<eos> The key players remain in position to execute the plan.<eos> Except now the Secret Service is investigating.<eos> Now you tell me what happens when they discover that Dr. Sanders is responsible for the blood thinner.<eos> They won't.
I would have done it the first time.<eos> He was a sociopath that stole from widows and orphans, and he got what he deserved.<eos> But I didn't do it.<eos> We'll see.<eos> Yes, we will.
How long have Homeland Security been watching me?<eos> Eight, nine years.<eos> I did what I thought was best at the time.<eos> Don't expect me to apologize.<eos> No, no, I-I won't.
It's about the information on the pages.<eos> Moz, you can leave those pages blank.<eos> Nobody's going to see them.<eos> Uh, not soon.<eos> No. But eventually, they will.
- Are you nervous?<eos> - You can't do this to me.<eos> Tell me where the money is.<eos> The FBI will never find it.<eos> No, they won't.
Calcite levels and pebble texture appear appropriate.<eos> I assume that's good news.<eos> Oh, it very much is.<eos> Then I think this is the part where you pay me.<eos> I will.
She said if I didn't come see her today, she was going to have sex with her oncologist.<eos> That sounds more like her.<eos> She must be feeling better.<eos> Tell her I love her.<eos> I will.
The Mayor's foster brother is assigned to a weapons convoy that carries SCAR 16s by truck.<eos> The convoy's scheduled to come through Starling City tonight.<eos> FN SCAR 16s are military assault weapons with grenade launchers.<eos> The man gets a hold of these, Oliver, it's game over.<eos> He won't.
Releasing us from the shame and regret of our mistakes.<eos> In the face of mortality...<eos> Many feel the need to seek this closure to make things right.<eos> Because if death doesn't kill us...<eos> Our demons will.
From the moment I saw you in New York, in the instant you stepped back in my life, I knew.<eos> I knew I'd never stopped loving you.<eos> And before I even had a chance to take a breath, I... I lost you once more, and all that pain that I had pushed down for all those years, it just came... rushing back, and I... I didn't know if I could go through it again.<eos> I love you.<eos> I probably always will.
♪ Rubber, rubber, rubber, you have a rubber ♪<eos> Shut up, you little twerp!<eos> She didn't mean that, sweetie.<eos> It's just, we don't want you misunderstanding what you saw and telling someone.<eos> Maybe I will. Maybe I won't.
Audrey was gonna shoot me.<eos> That guy got in the way.<eos> When she gets back, she will kill me.<eos> No!<eos> She won't.
Blonde hair.<eos> William.<eos> Listen, he is trying to set me up, okay?<eos> He planted that there. I-I can explain everything.<eos> Yeah. And you will.
Open the register.<eos> No, please.<eos> I won't talk.<eos> I won't talk.<eos> No, you won't.
That's changed?<eos> I have a better way to end The Troubles now.<eos> Okay, listen, he's got to be here.<eos> Stop, or I'll shoot.<eos> No, you won't, Jordan.
Bam.<eos> She's a natural.<eos> I will never give a Trouble to solve a Trouble.<eos> I'll find another way.<eos> No you won't.
Now, the curse, or intention, is shaped in here.<eos> You're giving them a release.<eos> It's a gift.<eos> I'll never believe that.<eos> Yeah, you will.
I'm not gonna let you do this.<eos> How do I justify what I did to Lincoln?<eos> I can't just give up.<eos> We'll stick him in a soundproof room.<eos> We'll... something.
You know what they'll do.<eos> We've broken every rule there is.<eos> Yeah, but we've had so much fun doing it.<eos> Mara, they'll take you from me.<eos> No, they won't.
No doubt he wants to finish the job.<eos> To kill me?<eos> Yes.<eos> Well, supposing he gets inside?<eos> He won't.
We need to get you ready for their questions before they bring you in.<eos> We'll put you up in a hotel.<eos> No.<eos> I'm not going into a hotel.<eos> T.J. I won't!
Oh, I'm just worried about Uncle T.J.<eos> He'll be fine.<eos> Dad will get him out.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yes, he will.
He offered me 10 times my normal rate.<eos> I said no, and he got angry.<eos> I'll schedule a meeting with his lawyer.<eos> - We'll get it worked out.<eos> - No, you won't.
The caller who spotted the body said they saw a Ford pickup truck drive away from the scene.<eos> NERO: He got one of these for me, too?<eos> ROOSEVELT: Right now, we'd just like you to come down and answer a few questions.<eos> LYLA: . Hey, I'll call Gemma.<eos> NERO: - No, you won't.
Good luck, Cyrus.<eos> I won't leave you!<eos> There's no time to argue.<eos> When Jafar learns you witnessed my escape without alerting the guards, he will kill you.<eos> No. He won't.
Yeah.<eos> Which reminds me... a cabin on Lake Carroll, two days pulling large-mouth out of crystal clear water.<eos> Oh, man, they're going to love that.<eos> So will you.<eos> Yes, I will.
Don't sweat it.<eos> She tells me everything, and I always liked you.<eos> Tell that to your mother, please.<eos> Oh, yeah?<eos> I will. I will.
♪ No, no, no it's still catching.<eos> It still feels tight. - It can happen with scar tissue.<eos> - I feel like...<eos> - I feel like I'm never gonna heal.<eos> - Hopefully, you will.
Be direct and explain to Walt that this interview's really important.<eos> No.<eos> What I have to do is figure out how to be in two places at once.<eos> You're never gonna pull this off.<eos> Sure I will.
I'll get a warrant.<eos> You'll have it by the time you get there.<eos> She won't talk, and even if she did, what would you expect her to say?<eos> She may know Seth's location.<eos> She won't.
He wants to go home.<eos> Okay.<eos> I'll come back for you.<eos> I promise.<eos> No, you won't.
This is bad, Jackie.<eos> We got a very, very busy week ahead of us.<eos> I know.<eos> We need to finish that conversation.<eos> We will.
Why would I possibly agree to that?<eos> Because if I lose, I'll work the next five weekends, no overtime.<eos> And I won't tell anyone here about the time I saw you wearing short shorts outside of work.<eos> But if I win...<eos> You won't.
And I was good.<eos> I knew it!<eos> I knew you were a big softy.<eos> You tell anyone, I break your face.<eos> No, you won't.
Did she like it?<eos> I guess it was whatever..<eos> She liked it that much? If I personally gave it to her, I could've seen how much she liked it<eos> But I told myself I wouldn't do that<eos> I won't
Troops do too.<eos> I can sneak Aaron past, right out to Monroe.<eos> Absolutely not.<eos> - What if they search the wagon?<eos> - They won't.
[Stapler clicks] Max, I might be a virgin again.<eos> I love my new phone!<eos> It's so cool and red.<eos> It feels like anything could happen!<eos> But it probably won't.
You locked him in a cupboard?<eos> Yeah. And I want to know who let him out.<eos> It wasn't me.<eos> Stop being a mouth and put the knife down, Sean.<eos> No! I won't. So what?
How does a horse get into a kitchen?<eos> I still can't look my father in the eye.<eos> Did your house just have like massive doors?<eos> I thought that this exhibition might put it to rest, but... ..it hasn't.<eos> It won't.
these are just little things.<eos> You know, where I want to go, you know, climb things, go to outer space, huh?<eos> What, lean on the Tower of Pisa?<eos> Did you get your tuxedo?<eos> I will.
Yeah, I really do.<eos> They were gonna shoot Miles... and then I felt this flash of anger, and then they caught fire.<eos> And I can't any more of this.<eos> What if someone else gets hurt?<eos> They won't.
Connor: Aye.<eos> I'll pass it along.<eos> CHIBS: You two.<eos> Make sure they get there whole.<eos> JUICE: We will.
No.<eos> You can stay in the guest room.<eos> Till the service.<eos> If you want to.<eos> I will. Thanks.
You know what they say, once you pop you just can't stop.<eos> So if you, er, change your mind about tonight...?<eos> I won't.<eos> Well, you might.<eos> I absolutely won't.
You twisted it.<eos> I know you.<eos> I know who you are.<eos> You haven't changed, Darcy.<eos> You never will.
Remind me to get you a pack of cigarettes when this is all over.<eos> I don't smoke.<eos> You weren't going to leave without me, were you?<eos> I should kill you right now!<eos> You won't.
It's kind of the whole objective, actually.<eos> You see my point?<eos> You should know, I find post hoc negotiation... distasteful.<eos> Such a shame you won't get to see what your works have wrought, doctor.<eos> But soon, everyone else will.
We did.<eos> I would like you to know oh, my God.<eos> That even though we were seducing you for our coworker, I'd be lying if I said I wasn't a little turned on myself.<eos> Me too, if that will make you feel better.<eos> It won't, okay?

Airports, train stations, and bus stations.<eos> - Jake and Morgan can't have gone far.<eos> - And Ellen?<eos> - She'll come back for him.<eos> - No, she won't.
- Thank you.<eos> - No problem.<eos> - Tell Morgan...<eos> - I will.<eos> I will.
- What?<eos> - I miss Olivia.<eos> And if I could take everything back, I would.<eos> - I'll pass that on.<eos> - No, you won't.
Keep your hands steady.<eos> Just like we practiced on the range.<eos> I just...<eos> I don't want to miss.<eos> Well, then, you won't.
We'll have no investigator.<eos> And how much have we investigated in the last two weeks?<eos> Look, it's just for a few months.<eos> I'll talk to her.<eos> No, I will.
- No!<eos> I'd just find you asleep on the kitchen floor cradling a gun, with our son in the next room.<eos> Well, that's not gonna happen again.<eos> You're right.<eos> It won't.
It can't be done in the morning?<eos> I'm afraid not.<eos> I have a sworn statement implicating a prominent member of city hall in a major crime and corruption ring.<eos> Have you spoken to the DA about this?<eos> I will, first thing in the morning.
Prepare to fire.<eos> What is this, Gene?<eos> Where are they?<eos> Horn said he was gonna leave my daughter alone.<eos> And he will.
You're gonna have to choose, Emma.<eos> You realize that, don't you?<eos> Because neither one of us is gonna give up.<eos> The only thing I have to choose is the best way to get my son back.<eos> And you will.

Or every time we got on the subway.<eos> Actually, Pop invented it.<eos> He used to do the same thing to me.<eos> But we actually never had to use it.<eos> And please God, we never will again.
Now, I can do the same for you.<eos> So... so let's just land this plane and talk this through.<eos> Oh, thank God.<eos> You won't regret this.<eos> No. But you will.
Look, sometimes emotions are so hard for Max to read.<eos> You have to understand that, you know, he's come such a long way.<eos> But I will sit down with him tonight and I will explain to him why it was so inappropriate to take that photo.<eos> I promise you this will never happen again.<eos> It won't.
What can this reporter say except that Israel freaking rocks?<eos> Things just keep getting better here, Tom.<eos> And in a few days, they'll be honoring the little boy who discovered the red cow here on stage, and things are gonna go off!<eos> You gonna come with me to Israel, Kyle?<eos> Yes, I will. Huh?
I'm done. I don't need it.<eos> First of all, no.<eos> And secondly, when we do decide to quit, that's gonna be a decision that we make together. - As a couple. - Oh...<eos> Just take the damn badge.<eos> What... I will not!
If she thought she needed it, she'd use it against us.<eos> She'd let Marcus use it against us.<eos> She thinks she knows.<eos> She thinks she knows because of Ballard, and he's yet to come across anything concrete.<eos> And he won't.
One question.<eos> (Sighs) What?<eos> You can ask me one question.<eos> And you won't kill Jake, or Huck...<eos> - I won't.

Do you live here?<eos> Did Tan's family move?<eos> Are you not able to use your eyes now?<eos> I'll do it.<eos> Oh, will you?
Give me updates as soon as you have them.<eos> Meanwhile, there's been a development.<eos> Reddington's brought us a case.<eos> It's about time he realizes that he has to talk directly to us.<eos> He won't.
And it worked.<eos> But you have to admit, what I've done is extraordinary.<eos> My father will never forget it.<eos> Certainly Dana won't.<eos> Or maybe she will.
- I know what you're doing.<eos> - We're gonna talk about it.<eos> Okay, well, you have my number, so I can start tomorrow.<eos> - Call me.<eos> - I will!
A governess, tutors - it all does seem rather unnecessary.<eos> Perhaps I should simply send her away to school.<eos> I will not allow it!<eos> Do you hear me?<eos> I will not!
And, um, well, once I'm gone, they're gonna need each other more than ever, even though they both won't want to admit it.<eos> Stubborn kids.<eos> So...<eos> You think maybe you could see to it that they stay close?<eos> I will.
- I've heard that he's courting Ms. Lemarchal.<eos> So clearly that won't be coming to fruition.<eos> - Then we'll find another way.<eos> - Oh, we won't.<eos> You will.
That's going to look good, isn't it?<eos> The head teacher's son and his stupid friend, the two plonkers that don't turn up.<eos> Right, upstairs, pair of you, come on, get changed, I'll drive you in.<eos> Yes, love.<eos> I will.
Look at me.<eos> We're gonna be a family again.<eos> No, we can't be a family.<eos> It didn't work.<eos> But it will this time.
Look.<eos> You nicked him.<eos> If he can bleed, we can hurt him.<eos> And if we can hurt him, we can kill him.<eos> And we will.
Oh. You lock the girl up, you lock the boy up, or you put locked barriers between them and they'll always find a way through to each other. BILL:<eos> Aww. Except they don't, do they?<eos> No.<eos> If you lock...<eos> They won't, will they?
I need to know, if I ask her to do this, it's going to work.<eos> That he'll die right away and will it be traceable?<eos> Will it look like he's dying of natural causes?<eos> I need to know that, uh, she won't get caught.<eos> She won't.
Previously on "Betrayal"...<eos> - I thought this wasn't gonna happen.<eos> - It won't.
Oh... forget it.<eos> Did she have to sign in, too?<eos> No, just the box's owner.<eos> Well, we're gonna have to find her.<eos> We will.
Stop.<eos> We'll just take the rug back to where we found it.<eos> Jason, this rug has our DNA on it now.<eos> The police might end up thinking we killed this guy.<eos> - No, they won't.
I can't ask you to come with me when none of you expected to live in Portugal.<eos> You all moved from Scotland to be here in France. No, Mary.<eos> We left to be with you.<eos> So you'll come with me?<eos> Of course we will.
We'll let them wear themselves out.<eos> Then rush them.<eos> I'll do it.<eos> His head will hang in Lingbei province.<eos> No, I will.
Call me your son.<eos> You are a bastard, boy.<eos> Just say the words, and I will spare you unending pain.<eos> I will never give you what you want.<eos> You will.
I mean, it's already bad enough I'm the juice girl.<eos> I have some workout clothes you can wear.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> I haven't worn them yet.<eos> But I will someday.
Whenever you're ready.<eos> Damn it!<eos> You put the sensors in weeks ago.<eos> I haven't moved the damn thing once.<eos> You will.
Okay? He's my brain now.<eos> Meredith can have the rest.<eos> I get his brain.<eos> - I'll get rid of them.<eos> - No, you won't.
- I don't care how much money it is.<eos> - It's not about that.<eos> - Will you at least watch our movie?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, he will.
Yes, sir.<eos> This is a city of immigrants.<eos> You and me included.<eos> Always remember that.<eos> I will, sir.
I could never be mad at that guy.<eos> He says my favorite word twice in a row.<eos> Now, I'm gonna go talk to your father and get him to bring back the Christmas Carnival.<eos> Peter, I don't think that's gonna work.<eos> Sure, it will.
Okay, then shut up.<eos> You can have the Asians back, but I wanna negotiate my own terms.<eos> That is so cute.<eos> Now shut your silly little mouth, or you will never see Fred again.<eos> In fact, no one will.
I'm pleased.<eos> Your dinner.<eos> They brought it this afternoon when you were asleep.<eos> You should have woken me.<eos> I will next time.
I want you, but I'm afraid.<eos> I don't want to start a war.<eos> And what if my efforts fail?<eos> What if no one supports my claim in England?<eos> Every Catholic will.
You don't really do subtlety, do you?<eos> Er, subtlety can lick my balls and then eat a plate of my ass for dessert.<eos> I'll just go on Wikipedia, bosh out a plot mash-up.<eos> That's not going to work.<eos> Er, yes, it will.
I should've seen this coming!<eos> Wait!<eos> You have no right to go in there.<eos> -I will have to call the police.<eos> -I'm sure you will.
Supposedly heroin.<eos> -Sign this.<eos> -I'm not signing anything!<eos> -You will answer for this!<eos> -Of course we will.
Scat, there is nothing real about her.<eos> - No no no, you don't know Six... at all.<eos> Why do you shackle yourself to her?<eos> Sneaky Pete will take care of you...<eos> - and so will I.
You know what I'm doing on this case?<eos> Sure, I do.<eos> You understand why I have to help them.<eos> If you don't help those poor boys, who will?<eos> Nobody will.
- But listen to me, when this thing placed,<eos> - I'm gonna take care of everything.<eos> and I fuckin' say, and you tell that fuckin' piece of shit.<eos> - If he comes correct.<eos> - I will.
That's possibly worse than the incest thing.<eos> This is an abomination.<eos> I'm telling Todd.<eos> - No, he won't believe you.<eos> - Yeah, he will.
Selina Kyle.<eos> The databases are full of close-calls, tips from fences.<eos> She's good, but the ground is shrinking beneath her feet.<eos> We should send the police before she fences the pearls.<eos> She won't.
Yes, of course, I'm sorry.<eos> You're right, I'm sorry.<eos> Find him quickly, and you have to call me as soon as you find him or I will get on the phone with the judge.<eos> - No, no, no, that won't be necessary.<eos> - Well, I will.
What are you waiting for?<eos> You have other sons?<eos> Two.<eos> And if I killed you, they will come and seek revenge.<eos> They will, for sure.
Negative.<eos> If you want to talk about anything..<eos> I don't.<eos> If you change your mind..<eos> I won't.
Would be proud of what you did.<eos> I don't know who you were in your past life.<eos> But in this life, you are Guardian.<eos> But how can I know who I am until I find out who I was?<eos> You will.
We have minutes to live.<eos> We don't want to start counting the times, do we?<eos> And having solemn discussions on the subject.<eos> No, we wanna do it.<eos> And we will.
Tighten everything up again.<eos> Herman ...<eos> We have built a raft like Tiki did.<eos> And he succeeded.<eos> And so will we.

How soon can you get there?<eos> I'll go first thing tomorrow.<eos> Good.<eos> And call me when it's done.<eos> I will.

My home is a good place for me.<eos> I'm sure.<eos> But we'll go check out the apartment you signed up for.<eos> - No, we won't.<eos> Oh yes, we will.
He lied to me, Ricky.<eos> You're young.<eos> You haven't met that special someone yet.<eos> So you don't know.<eos> But one day you will.
You're pregnant.<eos> How could you do that?<eos> Uh, I don't really have a choice.<eos> You think it'll make a difference?<eos> Of course it will.

How could you get so lost?<eos> I have reasons to hate myself, but this is not about me.<eos> I must leave the region.<eos> Can you look after her?<eos> I will.
- It's Halloween.<eos> - Are you kidding me?<eos> - Who cares? My dad will kill me, Renee.<eos> - You know that.<eos> - He will not.
What time is it?<eos> I think there's a strong possibility she's had second thoughts.<eos> Mark.<eos> If she does arrive, she'd be perfectly within her rights to turn around and run.<eos> She won't.
- What?<eos> - I'm an old man.<eos> And this money business, Serenella's thing has worn me out.<eos> - It's just a phase, it'll pass.<eos> - It won't.
- Then you love me.<eos> - You're stupid.<eos> Come and have a drink!<eos> - Fuck you.<eos> - I will not.

Okay.<eos> Ju-- please come back in.<eos> Stay back, Alice.<eos> I didn't kill anyone.<eos> But you will.
I'm sorry, I thought the police might have your mobile.<eos> Nobody took my mobile.<eos> Everything's fine.<eos> Has she turned up?<eos> No, but she will.
- And you?<eos> - I'm fine.<eos> How can you be fine?<eos> Alex, they won't let you go!<eos> Of course they will.
Chuck, I don't blame you.<eos> And as crazy as this all has gotten, I know why you did everything.<eos> Because I love you.<eos> And I love you.<eos> I always will.
Thank you for coming forward.<eos> I can't believe you're taking their side.<eos> I mean, they're just using you.<eos> And when they're done, they'll throw you out just like they did me.<eos> No, they won't.
Well, I get that, but you're doing exactly what was done to you and to everyone else.<eos> Yeah. I mean, I was hurt, sure, but I survived.<eos> A little adversity can actually be good for you.<eos> You'll see how things work around here.<eos> No, I won't, actually.
There is nothing to worry about.<eos> I hope that's not overconfidence I hear in your voice.<eos> I don't need to remind you how sensitive an operation this is.<eos> If anyone finds out...<eos> Jack, they won't.
Just in case.<eos> Brilliant.<eos> What's the matter?<eos> We'll get caught.<eos> We won't!

I'm pleased it pleases you, my lord.<eos> And there are- Ninety-five more like it making their way from other foundries as we speak.<eos> Ha!<eos> Perhaps our fragile illusion will yet have substance.<eos> It will, my Lord.
Thanks for your help.<eos> Okay, so now they've got our truck and our plans to break in?<eos> Yeah.<eos> What happens if they don't drive it in?<eos> They will.

- I don't know, you could do scenes from the movies, you could have a big group theatre number.<eos> You could've a baseball number.<eos> That's what Tom said.<eos> That's great, Mom.<eos> I will.
I would like for you to eat the steak and the foie gras.<eos> I really would.<eos> I can't do that.<eos> You can...<eos> But you won't.

It's a good day for me.<eos> This is as good as this job gets.<eos> Savor it.<eos> You're right.<eos> I will.
Do you really wanna come back here and do this again?<eos> - I'll bring it home. - ( Elevator dings )<eos> Thank you.<eos> I'll see you at home.<eos> You will.
Thank you.<eos> Now look here, don't be obtuse, Tietjens.<eos> Dammit, man, is the department's duty to support Waterhouse and make his case to the house. Do you understand?<eos> Minister has to show the figures for the insurance bill will balance.<eos> Well, they won't.
Cops are stupid.<eos> - We didn't do anything.<eos> - Don't talk to them.<eos> I'll talk to anybody I want to.<eos> - No, you won't.
Here...<eos> Tell her I did my best, and tell her that Alo helped me cos he does computer shit on his PlayStation.<eos> All right.<eos> And tell her that you're a mean old cow who probably never gets laid.<eos> I will.
'Good.<eos> Good.<eos> Remember to label everything.<eos> 'D'you hear me Alex? '<eos> Yeah I will.
And Franky!<eos> You need to tell her.<eos> Tell her I'm coming home!<eos> Tell her I...<eos> I will.
Smacking kisses, Persie."<eos> It's rather ingenious, sending flowers from Berlin.<eos> You wait.<eos> You'll get the bill from Constance Spry tomorrow.<eos> I won't.
My brother Jaime rots in a Northern stockade.<eos> I would see him released.<eos> That's where you come in.<eos> Robb Stark will never release the Kingslayer.<eos> No, he won't.
So what?<eos> So what?<eos> So what if they find prints?<eos> And what if they trace it back to the wrecking yard?<eos> They won't.
And, sadly, we're gonna have to have the whole thing repaved.<eos> Ooh, that sounds expensive, George.<eos> Oh, it will be, and if George doesn't pay for it, we'll sue.<eos> - Don't want to.<eos> - But we will.
And this is my mobile.<eos> You can call me whenever you want. See what happens.<eos> - She won't call<eos> - See what happens.<eos> - She won't.
And he is only a pretender.<eos> Your brother's turn will come.<eos> Then you can lick his blood off Hearteater, too.<eos> Some of those boys will never come back.<eos> Joffrey will.
I wanted to give you guys something.<eos> Uh, made this for the baby.<eos> Um, if you guys could give it to him at some point, you know, if you feel like it.<eos> Yeah. Thank you, Lip.<eos> Yeah, we will.
He's using your fascination with him to get his client off.<eos> You want Harris to walk?<eos> I want 'em both -- Harris and Stroh.<eos> I won't give up one to get the other.<eos> And Baldwin will.
And I sincerely regret my actions.<eos> I'm much improved.<eos> I would not, nor could I, hurt a fly or any other creature.<eos> Johnny thinks he's at a parole hearing, that his answers will buy him freedom.<eos> They won't, Mr. McKee.
I-I'm sorry, Andrew.<eos> I just...<eos> It's okay.<eos> I won't tell her.<eos> You won't? No.
Hauser, don't.<eos> Three.<eos> I know you don't want me here, and it doesn't matter to me that you think you deserve this, 'cause you don't.<eos> You're my blood, and I won't leave you here alone to rot in this hellhole.<eos> I will not.
Go live your life.<eos> Live it without me because there is no place for us together.<eos> And fill your heart with love for someone else.<eos> Someone who can love you the way I never have.<eos> The way I never will.
What's wrong is you're late, and the wine's getting warm.<eos> We have to stop doing this.<eos> We just started doing it.<eos> We have to figure out what we're doing.<eos> We will.
Mr. Gold doesn't offer much leeway.<eos> Mr. Gold's your landlord?<eos> If we miss a payment, we're out.<eos> And then he'll reassign us. And we'll have to leave Storybrooke.<eos> No, you won't.
Really.<eos> Are you sure, Bae?<eos> Yes. I'm fine.<eos> Well, I suppose it won't happen again.<eos> It won't.
I love you.<eos> Are you gonna leave?<eos> No.<eos> Everybody always leaves.<eos> I won't.
This is amazing.<eos> Flattery will get you everywhere.<eos> (Both grunting, moaning)<eos> Shh. I don't want Ian to hear us.<eos> He won't.
But I'm going to bend over backwards to help Ms Ali.<eos> I've had another trial collapse this morning.<eos> Is there any reason why this trial can't start tomorrow?<eos> I'll see you tonight.<eos> Will you?
The 24 minute gap.<eos> They're all over it - fingerprints, DNA.<eos> Bag and contents.<eos> I won't ask how you...<eos> No, you won't.
For once, I'd like you to handle one of these meetings while I lurk in the shadows.<eos> You couldn't lurk if you tried.<eos> That number we gave her...<eos> It better pan out.<eos> It will.
What right have his heirs to inherit anything?<eos> Darling, what right have I?<eos> Frankly, what difference does it make?<eos> I shan't keep it if I get it.<eos> Well, actually, you will.
- Well, she's right.<eos> It is getting serious.<eos> But I don't want to die.<eos> I want to grow up and do things.<eos> And you will, honey.
That's convenient.<eos> Whose hands are you in then?<eos> Just wait.<eos> He'll dump you too when you're older.<eos> No, he won't.
We're witches.<eos> It should work.<eos> Apparently not.<eos> But...<eos> Maybe this will.
I mean, this place isn't exactly Buenos Aires.<eos> Maybe not.<eos> But there is a lot more to Chance Harbor than the guidebooks suggest.<eos> Well, then you should come back.<eos> Well, then I will.
He's driven by revenge.<eos> Nothing is gonna stop him from coming for me.<eos> Okay, fine, so we find him first and we take him down, Joe.<eos> That's what we do.<eos> One day, we will.
Nothing is gonna stop him from coming for me.<eos> Okay, fine, so we find him first and we take him down, Joe.<eos> That's what we do.<eos> One day, we will.<eos> We will.
Fred, digging' the goatee.<eos> Come on in.<eos> I can't.<eos> I-I care about you as a friend, but I can't.<eos> I won't.
Leave me alone, I want to sleep.<eos> Go to N'Dula on your own.<eos> - I'm not going home on my own.<eos> - We'll never get there.<eos> Yes, we will.
No, no, this is criminal.<eos> OK.<eos> Oh, look, I... borrowed a bit from the Foundation, purely as a loan.<eos> I haven't had a chance to pay it back yet.<eos> I will.
Yeah.<eos> Lincoln is going to let you know when we have a date.<eos> I've given Mr Emery the date.<eos> Oh. There's no trial date yet.<eos> OK, then I won't.
Give it another try?<eos> Another try?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, I'll -- yeah.
It's not gonna be OK.<eos> Why did they break up?<eos> They were meant for each other.<eos> They'll find love somewhere else.<eos> No, they won't!
They were meant for each other.<eos> They'll find love somewhere else.<eos> No, they won't!<eos> Yes, they will.<eos> No, they won't.
At 8.<eos> - Oh, right. I can't today.<eos> - I thought we agreed.<eos> - My boss is going to kill me if he finds out.<eos> - No, he won't.
- No, he won't.<eos> You know what I mean.<eos> My 25th birthday is once a year and I want you there.<eos> - I'm gonna miss it this year...<eos> - No, you won't.
You think this makes difference?<eos> My death will not heal the scars you bear.<eos> Nor erase memory of my cock inside of her, or all those that followed.<eos> No.<eos> It will not.
I'm with you there.<eos> I've been friends with him my whole life.<eos> Why don't you just go talk to him, then?<eos> Why don't you just go talk to her, then?<eos> - Maybe I will.
I've been friends with him my whole life.<eos> Why don't you just go talk to him, then?<eos> Why don't you just go talk to her, then?<eos> - Maybe I will.<eos> - Then again, maybe you won't.
Huh? Why don't me or Ame go to one?<eos> that's because...<eos> I wanna to go to one too!<eos> You can't! {RAME! }<eos> I will! {IKUUUU!
I wanna to go to one too!<eos> You can't! {RAME! }<eos> I will! {IKUUUU!<eos> } You can't! {RAME!<eos> I will! {IKU IKU ICCHAU!
Are we gonna live here in secret forever?<eos> Not like we have a choice if our parents don't show up.<eos> Why?<eos> Your mom will definitely show up.<eos> She won't.
You've resuscitated a human heart in your bare hands.<eos> No, I haven't.<eos> - You haven't?<eos> - No!<eos> You will.
I'm going to church tomorrow to say a prayer.<eos> Church?<eos> That sounds really nice.<eos> I'll go.<eos> Maybe I will too.
Yeah, I'm a big fan of... - Basketball. - Basketball.<eos> I'm sorry. I just don't... Get out much.<eos> I was going to say, "follow sports."<eos> Well, maybe you should check it out.<eos> Maybe I will.
Diane, just say the word.<eos> No, David.<eos> You will stay here because we leave you alone.<eos> Somewhere else will leave me just as alone.<eos> No, they won't.
We're not gonna get that 1.6 million, are we?<eos> When the courts release it, it will go into your account for about nine minutes, and then it will mysteriously disappear.<eos> Don't try to stop it.<eos> - We won't accept it.<eos> - Oh, yes, we will.
Leslie Knope is running for city council too, and she's earned everything she's ever gotten.<eos> She has.<eos> Bobby Newport wants you to just hand him this election.<eos> Don't.<eos> I won't.
That's not a thing.<eos> It is a thing.<eos> It is a thing.<eos> Tell your clear soup hello for me.<eos> Okay, I will.
I gotta go after them!<eos> But this conversation is not over!<eos> You'll never catch 'em.<eos> Yes I will!<eos> No you won't.
I'm after cooking some Superquinn sausages!<eos> No.<eos> The salad's better for him.<eos> He'll have the sausages!<eos> Oh, no, he won't!
Oh, right.<eos> All right, well, good luck. Gah.<eos> Okay. Yeah.<eos> Text me with the winner.<eos> Okay, we will.
I know Karen Stillworth, the head of the committee.<eos> What?<eos> What?<eos> You have got to give me your word that you do not repeat this.<eos> I won't.
What?<eos> What?<eos> You have got to give me your word that you do not repeat this.<eos> I won't.<eos> I won't.
Maybe there's a way we could help each other out.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> Well... I could give you enough information to keep your bosses happy.<eos> What if the other cops find out?<eos> They won't.
Ha-ha.<eos> We want to ask you some questions about your son, Arnold.<eos> Don't... don't tell him I'm here, will you?<eos> Don't worry.<eos> We won't.
I've filed several complaints.<eos> I don't know why the state keeps sending maximum prisoners to minimum security facilities just to ride out their last year.<eos> It's like throwing snakes in a hamster cage.<eos> Feel free to file another complaint.<eos> - I will.
I think we should take him to the hospital.<eos> That's nonsense.<eos> No, everything is just fine.<eos> April's going to take you to school.<eos> Yeah... I will.
I take that to my grave.<eos> I-I don't expect you to... forgive me.<eos> But at least I'll know I did one right thing.<eos> I love you, Gem.<eos> I always will.
Do you think Ben loves the rebel Skitters more than us?<eos> Ben doesn't love the rebel Skitters.<eos> He just needs to fight with them... to protect us, to protect you.<eos> But what if when he's there, he realizes that he likes them more?<eos> He won't.
- No no no no. I don't teach.<eos> Oh, I see.<eos> So your plan was to drag me to the accountant to show me how much money we don't have and then do absolutely nothing about it.<eos> You want me to do something about it?<eos> I will.
Experimental boarding school in carmel where the students teach the teachers, and the teachers teach animals.<eos> Year abroad on an all-male catamaran.<eos> Then on to Northwestern where I majored in confidence.<eos> I had every educational advantage, Jack.<eos> Just like my children will.
Okay, I'm just going to try this and see how it goes.<eos> Okay.<eos> You can get into bed with him.<eos> I'll mess up his lines.<eos> No, you won't.
- Well, that's not gonna happen.<eos> - Excuse me?<eos> I'm not firing him.<eos> Then I'll fire him.<eos> No, you won't.
Then he finally saw me in that way.<eos> And now you want to mutilate me.<eos> Doug, I really think that you...<eos> He will leave me, Dr. Reid.<eos> Maybe not right away, but he will.
But you can't, okay?<eos> Is Meredith all right?<eos> I don't know how to talk to her, Richard.<eos> Will you talk to her?<eos> Yeah, I will, I will.
Okay, we're going to need a list of all his five o'clocks.<eos> Eddie's going to be upset.<eos> He doesn't have to know.<eos> If your boss is a good guy, we won't find anything.<eos> No, you-- you will.
- Had a bad day. - Yeah,bad day.<eos> I had a bad day.<eos> You go back in there, and you tell him the truth.<eos> Or what?<eos> You will?
You know what?<eos> I hope to God that when we die, our "work product" doesn't flash before our eyes.<eos> But for some of us, that's all we have.<eos> All right, if she releases all future claims...<eos> She will, she will, all right?
Can't do any harm.<eos> Will it help reduce his sentence?<eos> No.<eos> It might.<eos> It won't.
Is that why you're here?<eos> Set me on a course of self-improvement?<eos> You want me to get to the point?<eos> I'd just as soon you'd get the hell out.<eos> I will.
I wouldn't know... I...<eos> Uh...<eos> I'm kind of new at...<eos> You're going to help me plan the wedding, right?<eos> Of course I will.
OK, I have to go.<eos> Hang in there.<eos> Went and drowned himself, the bastard... and now we have to live with it.<eos> See the psychiatrist tomorrow.<eos> We will.
Would you like to sleep over tonight?<eos> I don't think my mom would allow that.<eos> Of course not. Ha, ha.<eos> I just don't want him to lose interest.<eos> I won't.
But to worry myself sick over a forty-year-old daughter, that's not fair!<eos> Y'all right, Mrs M.<eos> Hello, Martin.<eos> Look, she's got to knock it on the head.<eos> She won't.
- Will it take long?<eos> - Look, I'll go to the cops after the weekend.<eos> The paperwork takes three days.<eos> So it's going to be a genuine inspection certificate?<eos> Of course it will.
Great idea. Show who's the boss to all those who think they're above the law.<eos> I'll help you out with the media so they'd provide truthful coverage.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I hope, of course, that your region will support the state policies.<eos> - We certainly will.
It's drug money.<eos> Yes?<eos> We're not drug dealers.<eos> No. Then if you stole it, how do you know the person you stole it from won't come after it?<eos> They won't.
So you're saying Darren didn't do it?<eos> Well, he's guilty of blackmail, but that's as far as it goes.<eos> So what if the killer's still out there?<eos> What if he comes after me?<eos> He won't.
Mike, we can't have a wedding at this house.<eos> I'm too ashamed to even open the door for the UPS guy.<eos> You've gotta talk to him.<eos> Relax.<eos> I will.
Don't shoot, Max!<eos> Please!<eos> Your colleague isn't injured. He's just unconscious. That's all.<eos> Slowly put your gun on the floor, and the girl and I will leave.<eos> No, you won't!
What I did in there wasn't personal.<eos> It's science.<eos> It's my job as a doctor to tell the truth.<eos> Well, I hope you can sleep tonight.<eos> 'Cause we won't.
You lost your company.<eos> I know, it was stupid.<eos> Is there anything we can do?<eos> What I should do is walk through that door and make you live with this.<eos> Well, you won't, will you?
Disgusting.<eos> Don't let it ruin your evening.<eos> - I'm--I mean, I won't.<eos> - No.<eos> - I won't.
I don't remember being impressed at all.<eos> I need copies of last night's poker room security footage.<eos> - I can't give you that.<eos> - Yes, you can.<eos> And you will.
About me?<eos> You sure?<eos> What'd he say?<eos> You'll have to wait for the article.<eos> All right, I will.
Did you cry when your mum died?<eos> Yes, I did.<eos> I wasn't much older than you are now.<eos> Could you wake me up when you come home?<eos> Of course I will.
Okay, I see what you're doing here.<eos> Hands behind your back, Calzado.<eos> Make me.<eos> I -- look, she will shoot you!<eos> No I won't.
Hands behind your back, Calzado.<eos> Make me.<eos> I -- look, she will shoot you!<eos> No I won't.<eos> No she won't!
What did you do?<eos> What happened on the beach?<eos> The boy was going to expose you.<eos> You won't get away with this, Tyler.<eos> Sure I will, but Emily won't.
I knew it!<eos> I want this train stopped immediately and this stowaway forcibly disembarked!<eos> Afraid I can't do that, ma'am.<eos> You can and you will, or I'll have your job!<eos> No, she won't, George!
- The Prince of Castille is a wealthy man, Joan.<eos> Why can't I marry an Englishman?<eos> Because Spain will give you a crown, and us an ally against France.<eos> I'll never see you again.<eos> Of course you will.
Take one for the team.<eos> You got her the grant money.<eos> Look, I know you did.<eos> You have to tell her. It'll help things between you guys.<eos> - No, it won't.
Look, I know you did.<eos> You have to tell her. It'll help things between you guys.<eos> - No, it won't.<eos> - All right, then I'll tell her.<eos> No, you won't.
Yeah, maybe dinner tomorrow night, someplace quiet, romantic...<eos> Look, take it from me.<eos> The where doesn't matter as much as the who.<eos> - Well, if you need me...<eos> - I won't.
Βless you, my children.<eos> What's going on here?<eos> What's going on, Father, is these two Yids here are stealing church property, and we won't have it.<eos> No!<eos> We won't!
Okay.<eos> I'll do it -- real fast.<eos> Not that I don't love doing you a solid, Sam.<eos> It's just I told Mike I'd help with the Rebecca thing.<eos> And we will.
Why couldn't he just call you?<eos> Why'd he have to drive down here and see you in person?<eos> I'm saying this in a non-confrontational way.<eos> Well, he wasn't supposed to.<eos> And he won't anymore.
I want to come with you.<eos> You can't, Lorraine.<eos> We'll have tonight.<eos> I'll go get some food.<eos> No, I will.
I'm not really ready to watch my garden grow just yet.<eos> I was hoping you would say that.<eos> Have you ever had one of those days when you get up, look at everything you've got, and then you panic?<eos> Cos you've got no safety net if everything goes tits up?<eos> It won't.
Holy shit.<eos> I haven't been able to get confirmation, but this was the perfect opening.<eos> Tipping her off builds trust, puts me deeper in the inner circle, and gives me a front seat to the political story of the decade.<eos> Unless she takes the spot on the court.<eos> Which... she won't.
You fill your bodies with chemicals and poisons each day.<eos> You worship a Messiah who vanished 2,000 years ago.<eos> Maybe you're the cult.<eos> I think I'll go now.<eos> No, you won't.
Brenda, you have to go back to work at this hour?<eos> Mama, I am so sorry, but I've got a deadline.<eos> Hmm, I thought since Clay was feeling better, you and I could have a little talk.<eos> And we will.<eos> We will.
Yesterday.<eos> Oh.<eos> Congratulations.<eos> You still have to tell Abel that I'm his mother.<eos> Or the court will.
- Really.<eos> Hey, I am a good campaign strategist.<eos> But I need to know if you're divorcing Peter.<eos> Donna Brazile will not agree to the keynote - if you are.<eos> - She won't...?
You're killing yourself.<eos> Yeah, I know.<eos> My wife says she's kicking me out unless I quit.<eos> Have you tried the patch?<eos> No, but I will.
I know, but you didn't.<eos> So I decided to call you.<eos> Okay, um, let me get all my ducks in a row, sir, and I'll get back to you.<eos> Sir?<eos> No, you won't.
Please.<eos> Please, I need you to.<eos> No.<eos> No, Randall, I won't go.<eos> I won't.
The Kali Yoga Cycle.<eos> But it will be followed by the Cycle of Light.<eos> The Age of Aquarius.<eos> Jeremy and Peter won't be here to enjoy it.<eos> Oh yes, they will.
Checking.<eos> Employment with Petrosian ended eight months ago, just when her pregnancy would have started to show.<eos> Get me an address.<eos> I'll go and talk to her.<eos> No, you won't.
We could move up to ten million before anyone else starts asking questions.<eos> Well, I'm not so sure.<eos> I think it's all happening too fast.<eos> What if they realise why we buy what we do?<eos> They won't.
- Are you gonna come out of sweater town?<eos> All right.<eos> Enough is enough.<eos> - If you can't break up with Gideon, than I'll do it for you.<eos> - You will?
Let him figure it out.<eos> It's your day off.<eos> I'm all he's got.<eos> I flew home especially to see you.<eos> And you will.
Excuse me.<eos> Bottled brew for the lady.<eos> Uh... actually, can I get a double scotch, neat, please?<eos> When do you get the test results for the exhumation?<eos> We won't.
What?<eos> This is bad, Deb.<eos> I don't wanna fucking hear you say that.<eos> You always say that you can fix it.<eos> I will.
Wow, maybe Pete is the new Jim.<eos> Do you see how the trapeze completely surrounds the wire?<eos> That means it is literally impossible for anyone to fall off.<eos> So you will merely sit below and be my counterweight as I pedal across the parking lot to that telephone pole,<eos> - I will?

I was supposed to die, I don't...<eos> I don't want...<eos> I can't be a vampire!<eos> If there's something that Bonnie can do, we have to try it.<eos> We will.
I know.<eos> Wish I could, though.<eos> Wish I could just tell you that you'll never feel pain.<eos> That you'll never crave blood.<eos> But you will.
I told 'em not to bother this time around.<eos> Okay.<eos> Well, if you change your mind, you let me know.<eos> I will. Okay.<eos> But I won't.
Because she's amazingly helpful.<eos> Because Carmen can easily do things that exasperate most white people.<eos> Well, I hope I grow up to be like Carmen.<eos> Yeah.<eos> You won't.
But I'm gonna spend the rest of my life making up for it.<eos> You know?<eos> If you can help me out, I promise, I'm gonna make it up to you and the whole damn world.<eos> Hand to God.<eos> I will.
Except you don't know where they are, either.<eos> Yeah, you got me there.<eos> Why didn't they send you after Knox?<eos> He's our key target.<eos> Maybe they will.
I've broken more bones and spilt more blood than this before.<eos> I like you a lot, Ben.<eos> But it could never work.<eos> Why?<eos> It just won't.
I'll tell you right now that color is not good.<eos> It's not contracting, either.<eos> All right, local debridement around the abscess<eos> - is not gonna work.<eos> - And what will?
They're not nice.<eos> What does that have to do with anything?<eos> They're still my friends.<eos> We'll see.<eos> Yeah, we will.
I couldn't completely get you out of that one.<eos> Had to get creative.<eos> Well, I'm glad that deleting our entire time together was so easy for you.<eos> But I guarantee you: Quinn is gonna find out eventually.<eos> No, she won't.
I found it in the file room that day.<eos> It has my date stamp on it--mine.<eos> We have to tell Harvey.<eos> He'll know what to do.<eos> No, he won't.
What happens if we can't get him out?<eos> Let black kill him.<eos> Go to plan "B."<eos> We don't have a plan "B."<eos> We will.
Actions speak louder than words, and, hopefully, my actions while in service to the FBI say more than I can.<eos> And what would you do with your freedom?<eos> Well, I can tell you one thing.<eos> I won't be going anywhere anytime soon.<eos> You won't?
I am going to kill him.<eos> You said they would call.<eos> D.B.?<eos> You said they'd call.<eos> They will.
Am I worth the wait?<eos> Amanda, listen.<eos> I swear I won't say another word about you volunteering.<eos> Yeah, you will.<eos> OK, I probably will.
- Well, that's not gonna happen.<eos> - Excuse me?<eos> I'm not firing him.<eos> Then I'll fire him.<eos> No, you won't.
I'll see you in court, Harv.<eos> So when did the plan change from trying to settle to punching Tanner in the face?<eos> He didn't seem to want to do the one, so I did the other.<eos> That's funny. But he got under your skin, and that can't happen when we go to trial.<eos> - It won't.
He's ready.<eos> Say what you will about Kellog. He's very resourceful.<eos> You know, I could get suspended for pulling a stupid stunt like this.<eos> I'll take the heat if anything goes sideways.<eos> Damn straight you will.
Now put down the gun, and toss over the keys.<eos> I don't have the keys.<eos> God dammit I am not fucking around here!<eos> I will open this motherfucker up!<eos> No you won't.
Since he called, it's been 20.<eos> If he steals corporate evidence and gives it to us, does that make us accomplices?<eos> No, Justin said that he's protected by the whistle-blower act once he gets the evidence in authorities' hands, and we would be too.<eos> But he just has to make it out.<eos> He will.
Cop-ra!<eos> Police-ical!<eos> Fine.<eos> We'll get some proof.<eos> No, you won't.
But his father had it sealed, because he was afraid that it would incriminate him.<eos> He was right to do it, too, with your side pulling out your torches and pitchforks.<eos> Final autopsy results will be in tomorrow.<eos> They'll tell us all we need to know.<eos> No, it won't.
This kid, he's just looking for answers to why his old man died, and he felt like nobody would listen to him.<eos> I know it looks like an open and shut case of suicide, but I just couldn't say no to the kid, you know?<eos> I wish you'd understand.<eos> As the commissioner, I can't.<eos> As your father, I won't.
And see each other, now that we're well protected.<eos> I won't ask if you're happy with her.<eos> No, don't ask.<eos> - You won't ask me if I...?<eos> - No, I won't.
So what?<eos> Nothing has changed.<eos> I'm still standing here getting a lecture and I still can't go out with Dylan.<eos> But believe me, I'm gonna find a way to see her.<eos> You probably will.

That w what you said last time in Seattle, but then the doctors fixed her.<eos> Right, but, Mason...<eos> They can't help your mom there any more.<eos> Nobody can.<eos> Somebody will.
- I should be the one to tell him.<eos> - Maggie--<eos> - He's gonna fire somebody.<eos> - God knows he should.<eos> - He will.
That's what my mom would call "stinkin' thinkin'."<eos> For the first time since I gave up acting, I finally feel like my life has a direction, a meaning.<eos> We don't need Jane to help us start a business.<eos> You and me, we'll come up with the money.<eos> We will?
I'm not sticking around here to watch her kill herself.<eos> One move and I'll shoot you.<eos> Oh, Bones, no.<eos> Don't drop me.<eos> I won't.
Mom, did you tell him yours?<eos> We've been very honest with each other.<eos> Okay. Well... It's a good start, I guess.<eos> We'll talk. We'll talk after school.<eos> We'll... hmm.
What I am I supposed to say? "Sorry, buddy, don't get your hopes up. My mom is dating half of Rosewood." Shhh!<eos> He really said that?<eos> Yes.<eos> Look, I just think that if you see this going somewhere, you should just be straight with him before it's too late.<eos> I will, I will.
( Gasps )<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> You scared me half to death.<eos> Not really...<eos> But I will.
And he's paying me.<eos> Just like he pays you.<eos> Only difference being, I don't got to kill nobody.<eos> So when you coming back?<eos> Maybe I won't.
You don't need to blow smoke up my ass.<eos> I'm not blowing smoke.<eos> I told you this from the day I came back, that I was us to find a way to work together.<eos> Why say this to me and not Jessica?<eos> I will.
Dangerous people.<eos> My mother died when I was a baby, and my father has been the only family I've ever known and they slit his throat.<eos> They are going to have to kill me if they want me to give this up.<eos> Well let's hope it doesn't come to that.<eos> And it won't.
Sorry.<eos> I didn't know anybody was in here.<eos> Otto, huh?<eos> We're gonna have to say something to each other - sooner or later.<eos> - No, we won't.
Yeah.<eos> I'd finish the rehab up there.<eos> They need a neonatal specialist.<eos> If... we can get through this Otto mess.<eos> Which we will.
It's not their usual protocol.<eos> Yeah, I wouldn't know.<eos> And I'd like to know why this Section Six hasn't been filing reports about this task force with my office.<eos> Well you have to ask her when she gets here?<eos> I will...
Friends of yours?<eos> I don't think he's taking my threat seriously.<eos> You Americans are very good at making threats.<eos> But you do not know the true meaning of jihad.<eos> Your friends, however, they soon will.
The elders are gonna be furious about this.<eos> I don't give a twirly fuck about your elders.<eos> What I care about is this vampire.<eos> So we gotta find him and make him pay for what he did.<eos> And we will.
All right, I gotta go.<eos> Oh, hey, you can't leave yet.<eos> The kid needs you.<eos> He'll crumble without you.<eos> No, he won't.
Oh, hey, you can't leave yet.<eos> The kid needs you.<eos> He'll crumble without you.<eos> No, he won't.<eos> Yes, I will.
I told you already.<eos> I just needed to get away for a bit.<eos> Tell me what you did... to lose your job.<eos> Nothing.<eos> The city of "I will."
You all right, Bob?<eos> Yeah, better now I'm not in there. Ha-ha! Ta.<eos> It's t'dogs.<eos> What happens if it comes off the wall?<eos> It won't.
I don't think so, Ben.<eos> Thank you.<eos> And, uh, we'll take care of it.<eos> And, uh, I'll get back to you.<eos> One of us will.
History shows dishonorable discharge from USMC in '04.<eos> Hi, Will.<eos> You see that?<eos> I want to do it again.<eos> We will.
I... - Winter Olympics. Uh-huh.<eos> - No.<eos> 2006. Bobsled.<eos> Sarah, I know that you think you're in love with me right now, but I promise you, you're going to find someone better.<eos> No! No, I never will.
That's all.<eos> You really expect us to believe that, Reggie?<eos> It's the truth.<eos> If you don't believe me, ask my wife.<eos> Oh, we will.
So what?<eos> We're not there.<eos> Well, they sure as hell know about Hayden, and they knew to look at the shop, so you might want to be a little more concerned.<eos> We have to finish this.<eos> We will.
Jesse!<eos> Look, I'm unarmed.<eos> Okay, I-I don't want to hurt you, I just-- I just want to talk.<eos> Have they started surgery yet?<eos> They will.
Do what?<eos> We need to talk in private.<eos> Bit difficult, cos this house is becoming like a drop-in centre!<eos> I think I'll just go...<eos> No, you won't.
I don't want that!<eos> Or if you have any relatives that live nearby?<eos> I don't have anyone.<eos> We can look after her.<eos> No, we won't.
For finding your true love?<eos> For your happiness, I would gladly give my life.<eos> My only regret is that I won't live to see you marry Snow.<eos> Shh.<eos> Yes, you will.
- Please don't!<eos> Will you tell?<eos> Jane: It's not Artie.<eos> It's Jonathan.<eos> I won't.
You saw...<eos> we're not looking good.<eos> - We'll get through it.<eos> - No.<eos> No, we won't.
Did you find any on the beach or on the suspect?<eos> No.<eos> But w-why would I even look?<eos> I mean, we got the guy.<eos> Yeah, I-I'm sure we will.
You being here is a threat.<eos> Everything's going to be fine, Zoe.<eos> So long as you bring her to me.<eos> And if I don't?<eos> Oh, you will.
I'm so glad you guys are here with me.<eos> So, the doctor let Jack's parents go in with him.<eos> I don't know what's going on, but I guess they'll come out and talk to us as soon as they can.<eos> I wish they'd find the guy who did this.<eos> They probably won't.

Nobody wants to talk about that, do they?<eos> You've got to have a positive attitude, love.<eos> I'm trying.<eos> If anything goes wrong...<eos> It won't.
What time's your taxi coming?<eos> I don't know,<eos> I don't care.<eos> Once you get to St Lucia, you'll forget all about me.<eos> I won't.
My grandpa has me on a curfew.<eos> I know, it's humiliating, but...<eos> Good night, Lavon.<eos> Don't take these without food, and if it happens again, just give me a call.<eos> Thanks, I will.
He...<eos> Two-way street.<eos> I saw, felt...what these aliens are all about.<eos> We have to beat them.<eos> We will.
- Hey.<eos> - Hey.<eos> She'll show you her tits if you give her some ice cream.<eos> - I'm not gonna do that.<eos> - Yes, you will.
It's OK now. OK?<eos> She's at the medical center.<eos> They'll get this all straightened out.<eos> Lauren will never forgive me.<eos> Yes, she will.
I know it's not.<eos> We'll agree to disagree, Commissioner.<eos> Mr. Mayor... if you go out there on TV and announce this to the public, those three terrorists will burrow so far underground, they will come out on the other side of the world.<eos> Good. And hopefully, they'll stay there.<eos> No, they won't.
How can this small child be helping you?<eos> What is her name?<eos> She's amazing, Peter.<eos> There's just so many things that I want to tell her and so many things that I want to ask her.<eos> You will.
Being tested only makes you stronger.<eos> I don't think it's working with me.<eos> - What shall we do now?<eos> - There's nothing we can do beyond removing all signs of a wedding and holding her hand while she recovers.<eos> She will, of course.
I never thought of you as a woman with no standards.<eos> I wish you'd come back to the drawing room.<eos> I'd only set your mother's teeth on edge.<eos> She'll come through it.<eos> She will.
Don't we owe this to Sybil?<eos> I'll do it on one condition.<eos> No, two.<eos> First, Matthew must agree.<eos> He will.
Very good.<eos> So, with his lordship, Mr Crawley and MR Branson, we're already ten.<eos> What about you, Mr Barrow?<eos> I think I'll be gone by then.<eos> Yes, you will.
There is no need for impertinence, Edna, thank you.<eos> You're all right.<eos> I'm happy to drive them.<eos> But who'll stay here?<eos> I will.
You're so stupid.<eos> Why do you hurt me?<eos> Shut up.<eos> I love you.<eos> I always will.
Yeah, that's not gonna happen.<eos> Todd...<eos> Seriously, just-just drop it.<eos> Okay.<eos> I will.
You need to get back in that bed now.<eos> He's rattled by the surgery.<eos> It's normal.<eos> Would you like me to order restraints, Todd?<eos> Because I will.
Really?<eos> 'Cause it didn't look like nothing.<eos> We'll talk about it tonight, okay?<eos> Yes, please.<eos> We will.
Lie still.<eos> Much blood has been shed this day and all for something few wise men would ever want.<eos> You mean the Diamair?<eos> Morgana never found it?<eos> And she never will.
You forget that?<eos> I can't tap into the D.O.D. database without authorization.<eos> I'll lose everything, man.<eos> Only if you get caught.<eos> And you won't.
- I don't wanna shoot you.<eos> - I will kill you if I must.<eos> You missed.<eos> - I know.<eos> - But I won't.
Tell the world.<eos> Tell them how to deal this.<eos> The world needs your leadership right now.<eos> I'll do my best.<eos> Yeah, of course you will.
You know what? I don't know why I'm explaining myself to you.<eos> You're not the one here every day.<eos> Exactly.<eos> and I am not attacking you... what I see is that Charlie is not waking up.<eos> He will.
Go to hell.<eos> You're gonna break down and you're gonna tell us everything you know about Red John.<eos> You're gonna sing like a bird.<eos> No, lover.<eos> I won't.
You're gonna sing like a bird.<eos> No, lover.<eos> I won't.<eos> Yes, you will.<eos> Yes, you will.
I'm on my way.<eos> Uh, we need to go soon.<eos> That's all for now, Nicola.<eos> But I want you to know we're gonna do everything we can to bring whoever did this to justice.<eos> Yes, we sure will.
Marge...<eos> Marge. Hm... Marge, take it easy.<eos> It's just human contact.<eos> I'm afraid handholding isn't going to cheer me up.<eos> Well, maybe this will.
I've got the number.<eos> Text it to me.<eos> Let Carrie go first.<eos> Text me the number, then I will let her go.<eos> No, you won't.
I'm so sorry you all have to go home.<eos> Hey, Red Vines anyone?<eos> We're a Twizzlers family.<eos> Okay, we are off to a rocky start, but we are gonna fix this.<eos> Yes, we will.
Definitely the bullet.<eos> You know, Oliver, I'm no expert at this, but...<eos> I don't think love is about changing or saving a person.<eos> I think it's about finding the person who's already the right fit.<eos> One day you will.
I've written down specifics about him, too.<eos> Though hopefully, you won't have to go there.<eos> What if he doesn't buy it?<eos> What if he starts digging deeper?<eos> He won't.
Got hit by an arrow!<eos> One moment.<eos> It's a penetrating wound!<eos> I'm sorry but please bring some water!<eos> I will.
Oh, delightful!<eos> Well, my weekly fee is...<eos> There, there.<eos> I'm sure you'll find someone you like just as much.<eos> No, we won't!
I'm her mother.<eos> I put everything together in a folder.<eos> It's on the dresser. Just look at it.<eos> I will.<eos> We will.
You won't get away with this.<eos> Oh, please.<eos> What are you gonna do, you gonna tell 'em that I came here?<eos> You think that they're gonna believe the lies of a desperate man?<eos> Beckett will.
Over here.<eos> The water's pretty murky.<eos> Haven't seen anything yet.<eos> They still haven't found the body.<eos> They won't.
Your existence is to serve me.<eos> To please me.<eos> Do you understand?<eos> I'm sorry. I won't fail you again.<eos> No. You won't.
That might be a little more convincing if you didn't have a mouthful of bacon cheeseburger.<eos> My religion's kinda loosey-goosey.<eos> Basically, as long as you got your schmekel clipped and don't wear a cross, you're good.<eos> Howie, you promised you'd move.<eos> And I will.
Yeah, that she is.<eos> Here you go.<eos> I'm a callous egomaniac.<eos> She's gonna leave me.<eos> No, she won't.
Here you go.<eos> I'm a callous egomaniac.<eos> She's gonna leave me.<eos> No, she won't.<eos> No, she won't.
You capricious...<eos> But why didn't you call Teacher Seo?<eos> Yeah, tell her to come so we can open the liquor she has reserved.<eos> I'll try to call her.<eos> No, I will.
It's been awhile, after we first met.<eos> Yes. Have you been well?<eos> You didn't contact Ji Yeon ssi after that day?<eos> You exchanged numbers that time.<eos> We will after today.
You can't just disappear forever without saying good-bye.<eos> (Voice breaking) I can't just never see you again.<eos> - Huck.<eos> - I won't leave without saying good-bye...<eos> I won't.
I'm sorry.<eos> He's just a little scared.<eos> You're damn right I am.<eos> - You don't screw this up.<eos> - We won't.
The answer's no.<eos> It's not a request.<eos> Well, I don't take orders.<eos> Then I'll be releasing your greatest hits album immediately.<eos> Like hell you will.
So sorry, Mr. Agos.<eos> Well, you should, uh, go and... we'll talk soon.<eos> Dad, call me.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> I will.
Marilyn?<eos> ! Marilyn...!<eos> Ugh! Marilyn, are you okay?<eos> ! I found your eye, but I couldn't get the money.<eos> But I will.
It's unforgiveable, darling.<eos> You'll destroy them.<eos> I've worked so hard to keep them safe. Biba, if you care about either one of them, you will not tell them the truth.<eos> No, you're right.<eos> I won't.
We'll get her back as soon as possible, okay?<eos> What about our Rosie?<eos> Your Rosie's mom?<eos> You're gonna get her back, right?<eos> Of course they will.
Christine's gonna be fine, all right?<eos> I feel a sudden desire to hold her.<eos> We will.<eos> And you should call Parker.<eos> I will. All right?
Listen, Carter, I want to read you into this, but it's classified, so I've been authorized to offer you a temporary assignment to the bureau.<eos> And I know, with your skills, it'll soon become permanent.<eos> Sooner you're on board, sooner I can fill you in.<eos> So, please, think about it.<eos> I will.
Briggs reportedly escaped during a prison open house, an event that will most likely be canceled in the future.<eos> No, no!<eos> I can't believe it.<eos> Oh, don't worry, Joe, they'll get him back.<eos> No, they won't!
You put your life on the line for us, and I'll never forget that.<eos> I'm going to miss you. Both of you.<eos> Uh, who knows?<eos> Maybe we'll see each other again sometime.<eos> - Maybe we will.
Even you would have something like a guilty conscience...<eos> - No I don't.<eos> - You don't, you won't! It's because of your overbearing attitude like that that we got dragged into this!<eos> - A little reflection on your part...<eos> - No I won't.
Go back to your seat.<eos> Maybe he'll pull strings to get you to empty chamber pots at the hospital.<eos> I don't like school.<eos> One day, I'll go away.<eos> I will.
You have no enemies here, Thorin Oakenshield.<eos> The only ill will to be found in this valley is that which you bring yourself.<eos> You think the Elves will give our quest their blessing?<eos> They will try to stop us.<eos> Of course they will.
If he's got a chance, he's bolting. Great. Well, it was nice meeting you both.<eos> You should come over for a swim or a hike or something, okay?<eos> I don't think she's sorry at all.<eos> - She's gonna keep on doing it, I can tell.<eos> - No, she won't.
Because this is like a game...<eos> Its not a game...<eos> Not to me...<eos> But, I do need to tell you something<eos> And she will...
Well I knew better than to trust you.<eos> Now you let me walk out of here with my money. Or I will pull this pin and we all die.<eos> Go ahead, pull it.<eos> I'll do it, I swear to god.<eos> No you won't.
Go on, then.<eos> I love you.<eos> As do I.<eos> Always have.<eos> Always will.
- all's in anger.<eos> - Only fair speech.<eos> I think 'twill serve, if he Can thereto frame his spirit.<eos> He must do it!<eos> You will.
A madwoman loose in Paris with your gun and you're on top of it?<eos> The city's in lockdown.<eos> She can't get away.<eos> - What if she opens fire?<eos> - She won't.
Of course.<eos> Of course. If that is what you desire, then you must have it.<eos> - Absolutely no problem.<eos> I'll refund you completely.<eos> You will ? Most definitely, madam.
- Absolutely no problem.<eos> I'll refund you completely.<eos> You will ? Most definitely, madam.<eos> Straightaway ?<eos> I most definitely will.
Kill me and you kill Fiennes.<eos> They won't stop till they get him.<eos> I stopped you, I'll stop them.<eos> I didn't want to kill him.<eos> They will.
I've got to go home now because I have this Spanish test, so...<eos> I can write you a note.<eos> I guess deep down, I'm afraid that I'll keep compromising until getting the shit end feels normal.<eos> And then I'll be so beaten down by life that, just for a second, I will consider asking the homeless guy at the car wash who looks like Kris Kristofferson to rub my shoulders.<eos> And I will, and he will.
Let me be taken, let me be put to death.<eos> I am content, so thou wilt have it so.<eos> I have more care to stay than will to go:<eos> Come, death, and welcome!<eos> Juliet wills it so.
Have a nice voyage.<eos> Get going, Chang!<eos> Thank you.<eos> I won't forget you.<eos> Nor will I you.
- Here's what I want you to do. - Gavin, please don't do this.<eos> - I never told Shana I loved her.<eos> You tell her for me.<eos> - I will not do it.<eos> - Yes, you will.
Yeah.<eos> He ain't seen nothing yet.<eos> Did he give you money for the field trip?<eos> I'll pay my own way, all right?<eos> No, you won't.
-Did you tell her we had sex?<eos> -No, I didn't.<eos> I have better taste than that.<eos> You'II end up telling her anyway.<eos> -No, I won't.
What about Martina?<eos> Is she just an escape or something more?<eos> What if I said let's forget everything and pick up where we left off?<eos> I know you won't forget the pain I caused you.<eos> No, I won't.
It must be absolutely awful.<eos> It is quite possible we can look for each other after this?<eos> You need someone who can take care of you.<eos> - Would you do it?<eos> - Of course I will.
I need you. I need my wingman at this party. Hit me back, bro.<eos> All right, next up is to be amazed.<eos> Which is very vague.<eos> I will be amazed if I can come up with something.<eos> But I will.
What did he say when you told him?<eos> He was already a very happy man.<eos> This must have made his head explode.<eos> I haven't told him yet.<eos> But I will.
How you gonna do that?<eos> Well, there's a few, uh, dozen tests.<eos> Okay, let's get started.<eos> Y-you really think that's gonna make me talk?<eos> Something will.
Why don't you both stop?<eos> Oh, hey, almost forgot-- we got somethin' for you.<eos> Oh! You got me one of those old-timey photos That I've always wanted to take as a family,<eos> But nobody's ever had the patience to do it. Yep. Now you'll always remember this mother's day.<eos> I sure will.
Yeah.<eos> It's addictive, right... that rush you get from solving a crime?<eos> Yeah. I didn't get that from the script.<eos> Yeah. You should really read the book.<eos> I definitely will.
Let me guess.<eos> You're trying to find someone to tell you that I'm crazy.<eos> When I find you, you're dead.<eos> You'll never find me.<eos> No one will.
I hate missed connections and that stuff, so... can I ask, what did you say?<eos> In my second message?<eos> Yes.<eos> You don't have to say.<eos> Well, I will.
And that someday, by some miracle, we'll get to see him again.<eos> But until that miracle happens, I can't break.<eos> I need to be here for him.<eos> We need to be here for him.<eos> But we won't.
Fair?<eos> My agent meeting was important today.<eos> It was my last shot.<eos> I know, but you'll get another chance.<eos> Mm, no, I won't.
- Is she okay?<eos> - Yeah, she's fine.<eos> You can go visit her tomorrow morning.<eos> But don't tell her I told you.<eos> I won't.
But he believed that if a witch could channel enough power... They wouldn't need one.<eos> Like the power you get from a spot marked with a hundred dead witches?<eos> We just need to find it.<eos> But what if they can find the burial ground?<eos> They won't.
The ritual itself is relatively straight forward.<eos> A witch will channel the power of the Full Moon to release the spell that's bound within the stone.<eos> After that, Klaus, being both werewolf and vampire, will sacrifice one of each.<eos> - Klaus must drink the blood of the doppelganger to the point of your death. - I can't lose you.<eos> - You won't.
- And tomorrow's payday, y'all.<eos> - Yes sir.<eos> - Tomorrow's back to civilization. - Mmm.<eos> - I'll buy you lunch.<eos> - Damn straight you will.
I need you to make a scene right now.<eos> Get your hands off me!<eos> You told me you wanted me to keep these people calm, and that's what I'm doing!<eos> And I want you to sit down now!<eos> And I will!
Please, just tell me what you want!<eos> I want you to suffer... every moment of every single day for the rest of your life, just like I do.<eos> And you will.<eos> I promise you, Mr. Forte.<eos> You will.
You want to know that it's okay to lose the muzzle for a while.<eos> I can say this:<eos> The good Dr. Langston isn't going to catch Nate Haskell.<eos> If I give in to my nature, I won't catch him... I will kill him.<eos> Yes, you will.
- It's not mine.<eos> We're not stealing it!<eos> Sure, we're stealing it.<eos> The owner won't get pissed?<eos> No, he won't.
Louder, louder!<eos> Right, baby.<eos> Look, I just have a common cold!<eos> It'll be gone as fast as I can sneeze, hurl, and squirt it out.<eos> No, it won't.
Face it, someone with your limited brainpower would be lucky to get a job as a pizza delivery boy.<eos> Hey, Barack, pizza going out, come on.<eos> Man, I have got to go back to law school.<eos> I'm not going to wind up a loser like that guy.<eos> Sure you will.
Christ, Dickie!<eos> How the hell am I gonna explain this to Genny?<eos> Just say we were out hunting and I accidentally shot you.<eos> She ain't gonna believe that shit.<eos> Sure she will.
Helen's life ain't worth that to you?<eos> I don't need you to arrest Dickie.<eos> Let me out of here.<eos> I'll find him, kill him myself for nothing.<eos> Sure you will. Mm.
Think of this as a business deal.<eos> If I take down Dickie, you and Boyd can have free rein over all of Harlan county.<eos> Don't matter what I do.<eos> Mags won't give Dickie up.<eos> Yes, she will.
I messed up, and I'm taking my punishment like a big girl.<eos> It's okay, Uncle jarek.<eos> No, it's not okay, okay?<eos> I'm not gonna lose you to some boneheaded mistake.<eos> You won't.
No training, no craft to speak of.<eos> No guile, just pure instinct.<eos> She's astonishing.<eos> - You should tell her that.<eos> - Oh, I will.
Why are you saying this?<eos> Peter said it the other evening at the sushi place.<eos> I was shocked.<eos> I thought you really were leaving.<eos> I won't.
Just know this.<eos> If it wasn't for you, everyone could have gotten out of this alive.<eos> And now for the sister.<eos> I told my men to kill your mother, if they didn't hear from me.<eos> And they won't.
Yeah, right, right.<eos> So the IRS stuff-- that's resolved?<eos> Yeah, it's in progress.<eos> So you paid them?<eos> Well, not yet, but I will.
What were you thinking, Walt?<eos> I was thinking that I wanted to do something nice for my son.<eos> Look.<eos> I just worry that he'll blame you for this.<eos> Oh, he will.
But look,you know,that was a long time ago.<eos> There's-There's nothing you can really do about it now.<eos> I can just make sure that it doesn't happen again.<eos> It won't,okay?<eos> It won't.
You don't think it freaked my shit out?<eos> Two hours, Lafayette.<eos> Two hours I'm back in town, and some fuckin' fanger is on my neck!<eos> This is Eric fuckin' Northman, who's fuckin' ancient, and stupid powerful, and can kill all of us!<eos> And now he probably will.
I'm not sure I can promise that, actually.<eos> I do these things...<eos> I can't help myself.<eos> Will you promise to always be there and catch me?<eos> Yes, I will.
I do these things...<eos> I can't help myself.<eos> Will you promise to always be there and catch me?<eos> Yes, I will.<eos> I will.
I can't help myself.<eos> Will you promise to always be there and catch me?<eos> Yes, I will.<eos> I will.<eos> 'I will.'
She sounds like a very good person to have on one's side.<eos> I wouldn't be friends with her if she was the last girl on Earth!<eos> I don't want to be in this horrible school...<eos> Control yourself.<eos> I won't, I won't!
Because you've been disappointed in love?<eos> When you came here six months ago, you blew your horn pretty loud. You were full of plans for what you could do for our girls.<eos> You can't leave now because your heart's been broken.<eos> You'll find another head teacher.<eos> She won't.
Today, we pledge our allegiance to the King of all Britons;<eos> the one who removed the Sword of the Gods.<eos> I present to you, your undoubted King.<eos> Will you solemnly swear to rule the peoples of this realm according to their laws and customs and cause law and justice, in mercy, to be executed in all your judgments?<eos> I will.
Together, the two of you will be able to eliminate the Count.<eos> But you must act now.<eos> We cannot keep your new assassin a secret forever.<eos> I will have my revenge.<eos> You will, sister.
But so young.<eos> Where is your master?<eos> He will come for me.<eos> And if he does not?<eos> He will.
- Move us in closer!<eos> - We can't, the brush is too thick.<eos> Kalifa, we have to move, hurry.<eos> Please, Ahsoka, leave me.<eos> - I won't.
Why do you want to know?<eos> Would he buy off me?<eos> If I were you, I'd sell to anyone but him.<eos> But if I had to, where'd I find him?<eos> You won't.
Threaten us?<eos> Call her!<eos> Tell her!<eos> Tell everyone!<eos> I will.
And the only way you can make back your money is to allow me to make back mine.<eos> And the only way we can do that is if we set up that line together.<eos> So, come after me, you'll get nothing.<eos> Work with me and you'll make far more than a million.<eos> We both will.
What abyss am I staring into?<eos> Because if I am doesn't that mean your boy's already there?<eos> Do you want me to save him?<eos> Do you want me to go down there and get him out?<eos> Because I will...
And it's gonna hurt.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> Tell... tell people that you liked me.<eos> I will.
This one matters.<eos> I saw those men and women.<eos> Or what was left of them.<eos> All I want to do is help catch the bastard that butchered them.<eos> And you will...
You keep saying that.<eos> What Eli is neglecting to mention is that a jump like this is going to require every last ounce of power we have, and if his calculations are off--<eos> They're not.<eos> And we fall short even by a fraction, a tenth of one percent--<eos> We won't.
Rush wants us to take a cautious approach.<eos> Who cares what Rush thinks?<eos> He's not our boss.<eos> You tell him that.<eos> I will.
Who cares what Rush thinks?<eos> He's not our boss.<eos> You tell him that.<eos> I will.<eos> No, you won't.
It was a lie.<eos> You have to forget him, Jo.<eos> I said, "Jo, you've got to forget him."<eos> 'You must.'<eos> And you will.
Some little horror from upper fifth.<eos> They're doing a video diary project.<eos> So what do you think of my plan?<eos> Suppose she calls your bluff?<eos> She won't.
Won't look too good in your world when they see that members of your staff shag the parents all over the premises.<eos> Please don't be crude.<eos> Sorry.<eos> You won't do it!<eos> Yes, I will.
Doesn't tell me.<eos> Sits, thinks, charges off on his own.<eos> Tells his dog more than he tells me.<eos> You'd better let me down.<eos> Oh, I will.
He wasn't able to come back to humanity until a window was left suspiciously and heroically open.<eos> How that cat opened the window, I will never know.<eos> He just needs more time.<eos> Leave him and the cat alone.<eos> I won't if you will.
We got nothing from those kids.<eos> Yeah, well, you know, it ain't your case no more, so...<eos> But, you know, don't you worry, Linden.<eos> I'll get a ride.<eos> Oh, I won't.
Just... Talk to my sister?<eos> Sorry my problem isn't more exciting.<eos> If it makes you feel better, we can pretend Mia's an evil villain that we have to thwart.<eos> I just said "thwart."<eos> So, will you?
Sorry my problem isn't more exciting.<eos> If it makes you feel better, we can pretend Mia's an evil villain that we have to thwart.<eos> I just said "thwart."<eos> So, will you?<eos> Yes, of course I will.
Happens all the time.<eos> You've had these thoughts before. They've always passed.<eos> It's hell while it lasts, but...<eos> It'll get better. Everything will be fine.<eos> Except it won't.
Now, you didn't mention that in your earlier testimony.<eos> And no doubt the prosecution will call it a lie.<eos> Am I wrong?<eos> Trust me.<eos> He will.
Izumi, stop...<eos> Didn't I tell you?<eos> If you fuck a man you don't love, make him pay!<eos> - Will you ask him for money?<eos> - Yes, I will.
- Will you ask him for money?<eos> - Yes, I will.<eos> - With that, love ends.<eos> - Yes!<eos> I will!
The point is... sooner or later, I get hip to what's going on.<eos> I know you've been dealing drugs here, Jimmy.<eos> There's a school on the corner.<eos> If it happens again...<eos> It won't.
I'm sorry, but there far are too many innocents at stake.<eos> Time's up.<eos> You better have something for me.<eos> Oh, this is ready, but, uh, I'm not going to give it to him.<eos> The hell you won't.
No bad habits, no bad reviews.<eos> No trouble.<eos> Will somebody please take Tim?<eos> If you're so keen, why don't you take him?<eos> All right, I will.
- Use a tree.<eos> Trees don't move.<eos> I won't kill it, just shoot at it.<eos> - What if you hit it?<eos> I won't.
I won't kill it, just shoot at it.<eos> - What if you hit it?<eos> I won't.<eos> - What if you do?<eos> I won't.
'The rest of you, look hot and keep your heads down.<eos> 'That is all. '<eos> That's my dress.<eos> Whoops. Sorry, Mini, I'll change.<eos> Yeah, you will.
Thank you.<eos> Liv?<eos> Yeah?<eos> I think you got to keep an eye on her.<eos> We will.
I figured I had a choice of either sitting around or...<eos> Cooties win every time.<eos> But you'll be happy to know that those bombs are beauts.<eos> They're gonna cause a lot of damage.<eos> No, they won't...
I'm not saying you're right.<eos> But they deserve to know the facts of the mission.<eos> Call for volunteers.<eos> But they got to hear both sides.<eos> And they will...
Chuck, if you get us caught because you sneeze, we are officially the worst spies in the world.<eos> I know.<eos> Bad Three Stooges.<eos> I get it.<eos> And I, and I... and I won't.
Look I respect your very strong opinion on this issue.<eos> But I also hope that you can understand mine.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I can't.<eos> And I won't.
Who's this?<eos> Mr. Crosswhite, this is Agent Lisbon.<eos> Let's just take it easy, okay?<eos> You tell all those cops to stay out of here.<eos> I will.
We can't have them, not here.<eos> Why do you want to stay here when it's not safe?<eos> We can make it safe.<eos> - How we gonna do that?<eos> - We will, okay?
We can make it safe.<eos> - How we gonna do that?<eos> - We will, okay?<eos> - How we gonna make it safe?<eos> - We will, okay?
This whole time I've wanted to ask you.<eos> 'Cause I think she's still out there.<eos> Truth is, what else I got to do?<eos> We'll find her.<eos> We will.
I think so.<eos> Where did you get it? .<eos> Ozgur, don't be angry, but if you can come back sometime..<eos> -...before that shop's rented. I.. Huh?<eos> - I will, I will.
You were right.<eos> What about?<eos> Bringing Barbara and all of us being together.<eos> After they take out this rod we're going to Paris, don't forget.<eos> I won't.
Go with your sister.<eos> Okay, Mom.<eos> Claudio.<eos> What if he doesn't make it?<eos> He will
Bye.<eos> I don't care what the fucking DNA test says.<eos> You're not taking Liam.<eos> We'll see about that.<eos> Yeah, we will.
They're illegal immigrants, all of them.<eos> They can't even spell.<eos> Look at this-- this is wrong.<eos> - We're gonna get arrested for this.<eos> - No. No we won't.
I need you to get a hold of a lorry.<eos> I don't--<eos> I don't know.<eos> I just need you to do something.<eos> Of course I will.
Which is it?<eos> Well, let's see.<eos> If that's a promise of help, you'd better deliver,<eos> Miss Jilly Kitzinger.<eos> I will, sir.
Now get the money, or we'll send you proof of death.<eos> Please.<eos> She's our little girl.<eos> You have to find her.<eos> I will.
Please.<eos> She's our little girl.<eos> You have to find her.<eos> I will.<eos> I will.
FBI!<eos> Let her go!<eos> Move away from the girl and get your hands above your head.<eos> She'll drown if I let go!<eos> No, she won't.
And Lady Sybil's been nurtured so very gently.<eos> And what types would she be working with?<eos> Still, you'll know what's best to do.<eos> Yes.<eos> I certainly will.
Not really.<eos> You're right. It is a joke.<eos> But when I start my course, I don't want to be a joke.<eos> Will you help me?<eos> - 'Course we will, won't we?
She has plenty of time to learn.<eos> Cousin Robert will be in charge here for many years.<eos> Lavinia will be a lawyer's wife far longer than she'll be a Countess.<eos> That's if I get through the war in one piece.<eos> Of course you will.
You send me off to war a happy man.<eos> Will you do something for me?<eos> Will you... Will you look after Mother?<eos> - If anything happens.<eos> - Of course we will. But it won't.
Yeah, totally.<eos> - You're gonna come?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> That's what I'm talking about.<eos> - Yes, I will.
Or you come early, and we'll have<eos> - a little dim sum.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I mean, I want you to come back.<eos> - I will.
and there won't be little sisters to ream or Golden Lilies to get crazy over.<eos> Guess I'll do a shot for you if we win the Lily.<eos> I know we'll...<eos> - I know you'll win it.<eos> - Oh, we totally will.
- We'll explain the whole thing?<eos> - Listen, I didn't do it.<eos> I'm sorry about your brother.<eos> You won't get your brother back.<eos> No, I won't.
And if you'd rather lie with noble virgins, so be it.<eos> You are my darling boy and the world will be exactly as you want it to be.<eos> Do something nice for the Stark girl.<eos> - I don't want to.<eos> - No, but you will.
Don't trip.<eos> Don't...<eos> You're not gonna trip.<eos> You're right.<eos> I won't.
I've never lied to you.<eos> Sometimes shit just happens.<eos> Nina.<eos> I love you.<eos> And I always will.
What's going on?<eos> Hairy dog.<eos> No, with her.<eos> What are we supposed to tell Nina if she asks about it?<eos> She won't.
Let's go get high.<eos> Mrs. Carmichael's watching.<eos> If we get caught, we're gonna get in pretty big trouble.<eos> You know that, right?<eos> We won't.
What is he,Micheletto?<eos> Benedictine,or Franciscan? He belongs to a mendicant order,Your Eminence.<eos> Well,where is his begging bowl,then?<eos> He has yet to find one.<eos> But he will.
She was such a good little girl.<eos> That's why it's so hard to understand.<eos> I suppose we'll never really know what happened.<eos> We will.<eos> I will.
And, if I may say so, dangerous.<eos> Stop that.<eos> You have done penance enough.<eos> Who then will forgive us, Your Holiness?<eos> God will.
And you do have two previous felony grand larceny convictions?<eos> Objection, Your Honor!<eos> Don't answer that, Jorge.<eos> The witness will answer the question.<eos> No, he won't.
Before you even got out of north Korea.<eos> I beat you.<eos> 'Cause I gave Declan his life back.<eos> I'll find him.<eos> No, you won't.
I'm angry.<eos> Too angry?<eos> Just angry enough.<eos> I can't have the wheels coming off this thing, John.<eos> They won't, Martin.
It's about Jason.<eos> It's about all the others that will be next if we mess this up.<eos> Listen, DS Ripley knows that and he wouldn't have it any other way, so if you respect him at all... just get back to work.<eos> What if Pell regards your silence as weakness rather than strength?<eos> He won't.
Robb will be looking for you to say goodbye.<eos> They've all gone away.<eos> They'll be back soon.<eos> Robb will free father and they'll come back with mother.<eos> No, they won't.
Oh, Alex ripped Haley's favorite sweater, and now I'm driving around from store to store, trying to find the exact same one before Haley finds out.<eos> Don't do that.<eos> Just explain to her what happened.<eos> Mnh-mnh. Haley's not gonna understand.<eos> - Sure, she will.
Stop for a second.<eos> Think.<eos> Take a breath.<eos> Thinking will help.<eos> Hyperventilating will not.
- Young man...<eos> - Put it on straight.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - Enjoy yourself.<eos> - I will, I will.
Move!<eos> You're not gonna try the pills.<eos> They're a waste.<eos> Then maybe he'll go to the clinic.<eos> Yeah, maybe I will!
She's trapped inside Langley.<eos> The weapon detonated inside the heart of the CIA.<eos> Three agents shot dead within our home.<eos> Now, people are gonna be looking to me for answers, and I will have them.<eos> No, you won't.
Why are you looking at me?<eos> You know what?<eos> Now you have to do it.<eos> Get me what I want, and I will be fine protecting myself.<eos> No, you won't!
Whether you want it or not, you can do things that nobody else can do.<eos> So that means you don't have a choice anymore.<eos> It means you have to do something.<eos> I know.<eos> And I will.
Look, I understand your feelings, Sir.<eos> I do.<eos> But we prioritize patients based on Their best chance of survival, not--<eos> Then this time, we make an exception!<eos> Sir, respectfully, we will not.
Just drop it.<eos> You haven't figured out what's wrong with me.<eos> Right.<eos> No.<eos> Not yet, but I will.
Maybe after I've showered.<eos> I think you may have brushed up against me back there.<eos> A shower?<eos> I thought you'd never ask.<eos> And she never, ever will.
How's that for luck?<eos> I'm surprised your school didn't force you to use the right.<eos> My mother wouldn't let them, but now I wish they had.<eos> I've asked the others and they say you're the one to help me.<eos> Of course I will.
Is that clear?<eos> It doesn't end here, you know.<eos> Not for John Bates.<eos> Lady Mary might have got away, what do I care?<eos> But he won't.
But how can they ever be?<eos> If the lawyer casts even the slightest doubt, won't that give them the excuse to cut me out and stay with Matthew?<eos> If only one of them recognised me.<eos> They will do, soon.<eos> No they won't.
You've nothing to lose.<eos> No.<eos> They have to see him.<eos> They must see Charlie.<eos> Well, maybe they will...
But why did you do it?<eos> Next time, if you want to know anything, just ask me.<eos> Well done.<eos> Very well done.<eos> All right then I will.
Maybe, but they won't be Sybil's.<eos> I used to think that Mary's beau was a Leonce but compared to this, he's practically a Hapsburg.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> Your turn will come.<eos> Will it?
You are a devoted mother, aren't you?<eos> You'll say nice things about me to Stevie?<eos> I'll tell him his mother loved him very much.<eos> She was willing to sacrifice everything for him, and it won't save you.<eos> What will?
You'll get all dirty.<eos> Protecting the earth.<eos> Victor taught me.<eos> Don't forget to thank him for having us.<eos> I sure will.
Quiet down back there, nobody makes fun of my partner but me.<eos> Nice wife-be--<eos> Nice white, ribbed men's tank top.<eos> Hey, how are people gonna know we're cops, anyway?<eos> Hopefully, they won't.
Okay, right.<eos> Well, no, thank you.<eos> All right, I-I had...<eos> I have a question.<eos> I... will just...
- She will.<eos> - What if she doesn't go for me?<eos> I mean, there's gonna be a lot of single guys there.<eos> For this to work, she has to be interested in me.<eos> She will.
Belko?<eos> !<eos> Seattle-Tacoma international airport is a nonsmoking...<eos> You didn't tell him we were going.<eos> I will.
Seattle-Tacoma international airport is a nonsmoking...<eos> You didn't tell him we were going.<eos> I will.<eos> You got to tell him.<eos> Jack, I will.
All right.<eos> Patriot act?<eos> W-we'll have it over to the ADA's office first thing in the morning.<eos> I mean, he won't have any problem getting on board.<eos> Oh, yes, he will.
dad.<eos> - Well, gee golly.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> - Pass that on to her.<eos> - I will.
The dam inside your brother's head is gone, and all hell's spilling loose.<eos> - We don't know what's going on inside.<eos> - I don't care.<eos> - We have got to do something!<eos> - And we will.
Come on, take it.<eos> Fuck you, motherfucker!<eos> You thought I was actually gonna feed you?<eos> You know I'm actually gonna kill all three of you, don't you?<eos> I will.
They spend more time out of Illinois than in it.<eos> You gave her an issue!<eos> You gave her a reprieve!<eos> The court will invalidate her votes.<eos> No, they won't!
You gave her an issue!<eos> You gave her a reprieve!<eos> The court will invalidate her votes.<eos> No, they won't!<eos> A lower court will.
This backfires I will deny that I ever agreed to it.<eos> I know we'd find some common ground.<eos> Jeez, I'll do like a cavity search for dinner.<eos> Give me a call if you need anything, all right.<eos> Yeah, I will.
I know.<eos> Pretty high tech, huh?<eos> Put 'em on now. It'll give your eyes more time to adjust to the dark.<eos> I can't see anything.<eos> You will.
You might want to transfer it to DVD.<eos> And I'm sure at some point you'll thank me.<eos> I doubt it.<eos> Well, John will.<eos> Your son will.
You need to get to the hospital.<eos> Got it.<eos> - You gonna go to the E.R.?<eos> - On my honor. Stop with the sarcastic bullshit, all right?<eos> No bullshit, I will.
What?<eos> He died about an hour ago which makes you a murderer.<eos> Turn yourself in to the police.<eos> They'll find you anyway.<eos> No, they won't.
And he told them my Auntie was dying and needed a new kidney, so he stole the $200,000 out of the asset forfeiture locker to save her life.<eos> And now, of course,<eos> I.A. officially reopens the case.<eos> Look, Chin, listen, this is going to clear your name.<eos> Yeah, it will.
Go home.<eos> She's coming with me.<eos> Are you going to the parent meeting?<eos> Don't ask that of me.<eos> The other parents will.
Wouldn't that mean we're dead?<eos> Excuse me.<eos> I'm serious.<eos> Think about it.<eos> I will.
Haven't figured that out yet.<eos> Frankly, this is less thrilling than you advertised and possibly wrong.<eos> No, he wanted that list.<eos> Okay. I'll have the clerical staff start writing the names, see if anything pops.<eos> Something will.
You do this, it's going to rip right through Allegheny Field.<eos> I don't believe you.<eos> And I don't care.<eos> They need to know that I'm here. To see me.<eos> And now they will.
Look, Mozzie's given us everything we need to run the con on O'Leary.<eos> What are you gonna do with him now?<eos> I'm gonna check and recheck every case in this file.<eos> Your story better hold up.<eos> It will.
Adrian is just--<eos> The mother of your baby and your soon-to-be wife?<eos> Yeah.<eos> But, guys, that's not gonna change anything between the three of us.<eos> Yeah, it probably will.
Totally ready.<eos> No anxiety.<eos> [chuckles] Me, too.<eos> We're gonna get through all this.<eos> Yeah, we will.
- l do?<eos> I am prem tired.<eos> All right, then...<eos> Call me when you're done<eos> Okay, I will.
Go talk with your mother.<eos> I said, hold on.<eos> Ma, have you talked with him about Sasha?<eos> Not yet.<eos> But I will.
- You want to tell her the truth?<eos> Why don't you tell her about Jason?<eos> Go ahead, - tell her whose idea that was.<eos> - Fine, Ray.<eos> Maybe I will.
Why don't you tell her about Jason?<eos> Go ahead, - tell her whose idea that was.<eos> - Fine, Ray.<eos> Maybe I will.<eos> I will.
What are you doing?<eos> You got a phone in here?<eos> It's downstairs.<eos> We could someone call for help.<eos> Yeah. We will...
And if we can make a little money on the side, then so be it.<eos> You're a fucking embarrassment to our country in that uniform!<eos> Maybe, but tomorrow I'll still be alive. And fucking rich.<eos> - I'll be seeing you, buddy.<eos> - No you won't.
It just goes on and on and...<eos> What?<eos> Amy's in a bad mood.<eos> I'll tell you why later.<eos> No, you won't.
Make it stop!<eos> Diana!<eos> Are you OK?<eos> - You have to stop it!<eos> - OK, I will!
Perhaps he was trying to do something that would look like hospital malpractice so he could sue.<eos> That is the most idiotic thing I've ever...<eos> What?<eos> You try it!<eos> - Okay, I will.
You didn't...?<eos> What?<eos> Mention your affair with Nurse Molloy?<eos> No. No.<eos> But I will.
I'm not saying I buy her story.<eos> But Marlowe said they're very common.<eos> We certainly need more evidence than this.<eos> Okay, well then I'm sure she won't have a problem with us searching her house.<eos> Of course she won't.
Because it's all right being independent, but what are you gonna do when you really, really need help?<eos> Ben.<eos> He'll tire of it, Caitlin.<eos> He will.<eos> No, he won't. He will.
Why didn't you tell me?<eos> I mean, when did that happen?<eos> I got home and Ben was here, and I didn't get a chance to tell you.<eos> Tomorrow, I'll get an assistant from marketing or I'll get a temp or something until I can find someone.<eos> Oh, no, you won't!
You know, this power trip isn't gonna make me want you as a roommate any more than I already don't.<eos> Whatever.<eos> I pay my share of the rent now.<eos> Chris wants me there, so you're just gonna have to man up and deal with it.<eos> I will.
Excuse me.<eos> What is he doing here?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I'm gonna take care of this.<eos> No, no, I will.
And unless one of your six is Rupert Murdoch, you're out of your mind. [Sighs]<eos> Okay.<eos> You printed that?<eos> Well, not yet.<eos> But I will.
Otherwise it will be too late.<eos> Why are you hurting me?<eos> You know it makes sense.<eos> They'll send you to jail.<eos> They won't.
We handed over what we have.<eos> We cried and we hugged and we shared with you.<eos> But we're not getting our vics all confused by showing 'em your eight-year-old's fingerpainting.<eos> So what happens when the DNA comes back and shows it's all the same guy?<eos> Maybe it will and maybe it won't.
Castle, it's my second day back.<eos> That's all.<eos> It's no big deal.<eos> And if it happens again?<eos> It won't.
If he can help reunite one family, isn't that worth the risk?<eos> Is he ready?<eos> We all have to go solo at some point.<eos> There's very little downside if he screws up.<eos> CASEY: Which he probably will.
YOU TRY HARDER!<eos> You try harder!<eos> If you loved me, you'd go.<eos> I just... need you to do this for me.<eos> All right, I will.
So it's a lie.<eos> Of course it's a lie.<eos> But it doesn't matter, because everyone believes it and now I've been branded a slut.<eos> I know it feels like the end of the world, but it's a rumour and it'll pass.<eos> No it won't.
And now, the one time I let myself go, I mean...<eos> I thought he loved me, Erica.<eos> That's why I let him.<eos> My parents are gonna kill me.<eos> No, they won't.
It'll need 45 seconds to upload all his data.<eos> And let's suppose that I get that far...?<eos> You call the spa again and you hand it off to me in person.<eos> What if the device doesn't fit?<eos> It will.
That's where my boat left from when I came over from Ireland.<eos> I'm gonna do that too.<eos> Sail a big ship like sinbad straight over the waves.<eos> Mind you don't get seasick now.<eos> I won't.
The parents of the kid that you hit intend to press charges.<eos> It's not my first offense.<eos> It's gonna be so great.<eos> Now Max, if you feel like you wanna make a comment in class, you got to remember to raise your hand and wait for the teacher to call on you, okay?<eos> - She will.
Don't do this.<eos> I can handle it.<eos> You know that.<eos> I know. What I can't handle is finding out after something happens.<eos> Nothing will.
Would you mind helping me with these?<eos> I can assure you there's no way I can kill Klaus from beneath them.<eos> Does that you mean you do know how to kill him?<eos> I can kill Klaus.<eos> And I will.
If you end up back in the hospital, then "A" really wins.<eos> Come on, Em, it's your turn!<eos> I-I gotta go.<eos> Well, call me... later, tomorrow, whenever. Okay?<eos> Yeah, I will.
I'm glad I bumped into you.<eos> I was hoping we could talk.<eos> Looks like they're friends.<eos> If those two hook up and she starts asking him about that night, and he remembers--<eos> - He won't.
- Witch hunters.<eos> This is a ring of iron sulphide to stop your powers.<eos> Science prevailing over your ungodly magic.<eos> We haven't done anything wrong.<eos> But you will.
Why?<eos> She told Cassie she was going to the lake house.<eos> The kids are headed up there to check on her.<eos> When we made Henry's death look like a heart attack, the idea was that the neighbor would find him, not Faye.<eos> She won't.
How you holding up?<eos> Been better.<eos> Listen, if you need for us to leave --<eos> I need you guys to leave.<eos> Okay, we will.
This is a Max Power train, right here.<eos> Anyway, putting aside Jeremy's ideas of Pimp My Stovepipe Hat,<eos> Hammond and I think we might be onto something with our train.<eos> So we will, in fact, pick that up later.<eos> We will.
Okay, here's the deal.<eos> You're weird.<eos> You wear a gun, you wake up with mysterious wounds, and I'm okay with all that.<eos> But you got to tell me what's going on with you.<eos> - I will, okay?
I need to know where he's vulnerable.<eos> I'm fucking done with him-- Impeachment hearings.<eos> Did you find her yet, the nurse?<eos> - Not yet.<eos> We will though.
Okay.<eos> I will take you at your word.<eos> But as for your little Glee Club the more arts at this school the better.<eos> So, may the best Glee Club win.<eos> We will.
I do.<eos> You've earned this.<eos> The part's already yours.<eos> It's been waiting for you, Mercedes; just take it.<eos> I will.
I'm fucking done with him...<eos> Impeachment hearings.<eos> Did you find her yet, the nurse?<eos> Not yet.<eos> We will though.
Not my fault that you're right there.<eos> Not my idea.<eos> Oh, but it was your idea for me to live with Margaret and Shakur.<eos> Yeah, well, if you don't like my ideas, you're welcome to come up with an idea of your own.<eos> Maybe I will.
No, he wants to get to York.<eos> We'll meet him there the following day.<eos> My dear.<eos> I hope you can be strong if it goes against him.<eos> It won't.
Yeah, well, nice try, but our two hours are up.<eos> Oh, no, we got five minutes left.<eos> See, since a snake's digestive juices are regulated by body temperature, I'm cooling our slimy friend to 26.1 degrees Celsius to slow down his metabolism.<eos> That'll kill him.<eos> Not five minutes it won't.
Well, you might remember this the next time you're screaming at an intern for skipping the fundamentals.<eos> Will you just do it, please?<eos> Take your time.<eos> It'll come back.<eos> No, it won't.
CHIBS: Get him in the van.<eos> CLAY: The thief, put him deep.<eos> No marker. All right?<eos> Have Laurel and Had y do it.<eos> HAPPY: Yes, I will.
- Okay, see you, guys.<eos> I think you need to talk to your brother about it as soon as you can.<eos> - Hello?<eos> Crosby?<eos> - Okay, I-I will.
It always comes back to the needy with you, doesn't it?<eos> It's kind of in the job description.<eos> I hear your new neighbor Ben Faulkner does wonderful work with the homeless.<eos> Why don't you speak to him?<eos> Perhaps I will.
Andre.<eos> Yeah, it's fine.<eos> All right. Yeah.<eos> Thought you were gonna finish your painting.<eos> I will.
Well, if I do, and you can indeed shoulder the, uh... consequences, then you'll owe me a favor.<eos> Name it. What do you want?<eos> Something precious.<eos> But I have nothing.<eos> Oh, but you will.
The point is you can't choose where you were born.<eos> But you can choose where you live.<eos> I love this town.<eos> I always have.<eos> I always will.
I just want to go to a movie and bury my face in vat of popcorn.<eos> You committed to this party, Aria.<eos> There's gonna be a gazillion people there.<eos> Nobody's gonna miss me.<eos> I will.
What is this rough treatment?<eos> Sir, I am no fist-fighting man, but neither am I a man whose obligations can be deflected by blows or threats.<eos> Admirable spirit.<eos> I trust a hot head will not cloud your attempts to prosecute Mr Lucas?<eos> It will not.
If I hurry I still make the second half.<eos> Good evening, sir.<eos> But you will miss the opportunity to avenge Lord Melville.<eos> If you have the means, I would have you share it, sir.<eos> I will.
Maybe it's my posture.<eos> I have really sexy posture.<eos> Don't worry about it.<eos> I will talk to him for you.<eos> No, you won't.
How about your boss's name?<eos> You know that yet?<eos> I've got a family.<eos> You going to kill them too?<eos> Because he will.
He also takes his victims' hands, ties them behind their backs so they can't scratch him and get his DNA underneath their fingernails.<eos> Jo, I got it.<eos> It's all good, okay?<eos> If he left anything behind, I will find it.<eos> Of course you will.
I didn't mean to be presumptuous about what you were feeling.<eos> Don't worry about that, Lindsay.<eos> The trust is, if I were really honest with myself, I do feel a little responsible, so hearing you say that to me, I just lost my cool for a second.<eos> We are gonna get this guy, Jo.<eos> We will.
I suppose with changes in my personal life, I could always count on a stable work environment.<eos> And now, suddenly, things seem to be changing for you as well, and I...<eos> Change is inevitable and necessary, like the seasons, Mr. Palmer.<eos> I suggest you embrace it.<eos> I will.
There is no man more attentive than the one feeling guilty.<eos> Do you think a man would buy you a Valentino purse just like that? If he didn't feel guilty?<eos> -He got you a Valentino purse?<eos> -Not yet.<eos> But he will.
There's no damage to the connecting area.<eos> It's not some kind of trick.<eos> She may attempt to set some kind of explosive.<eos> Don't look away from her for a second.<eos> she won't.
Yes.<eos> Where should I start?<eos> Chicago was very different when I was a girl.<eos> No, Mommy will help you.<eos> No, Mommy will.
Son of a bitch!<eos> I'd rip his balls off.<eos> Exactly!<eos> And we will, Sobczak.<eos> We will...
We don't solve crimes.<eos> We barely prevent them.<eos> You wanna detect something?<eos> Do it on your own time.<eos> Maybe I will.
We barely prevent them.<eos> You wanna detect something?<eos> Do it on your own time.<eos> Maybe I will.<eos> "Maybe I will."
You're not going to close me down?<eos> You're not infectious.<eos> Right.<eos> I'll get back to it, then.<eos> No, you won't.
Talk to somebody? Yeah.<eos> My colleague Dr. Flores is a great listener.<eos> And just so you know, this may be the longest conversation I've ever had with a patient that didn't involve cutting their head open.<eos> You did good.<eos> So will you.
I know that anger you're feeling right now--<eos> What it's like to lose someone you love.<eos> Help us find the men who did this to your husband.<eos> It doesn't matter if you find them.<eos> Elias will.
Um, Mom?<eos> Yes?<eos> Going to prom and...<eos> and soccer games and... and... and all those normal things that you wanted for me-- ...will you just make sure that she gets them?<eos> Of course I will.
I'm in love with Violet.<eos> I see.<eos> I just can't take her brother away.<eos> But I can.<eos> And I will.
I mean, to the point where he's ready to come out and live on his own.<eos> And the other one seems to be getting weaker.<eos> Sometimes referred to as intrauterine omophagia.<eos> All the necessary nutrients are being devoured by the larger fetus.<eos> The alpha, if you will.
Push, honey!<eos> God, I love you.<eos> Breathe.<eos> I never wanted to lose you.<eos> You never will.
The ghosts of people who've died here.<eos> They're appearing to you now because you're evolved.<eos> Don't be scared.<eos> All you have to do is tell them to go away.<eos> And they will.
What are you talking about?<eos> Bree, he wants revenge. He wants to bring you down, and we're all gonna go down with you.<eos> Gaby, please.<eos> I will figure out a way to make things better.<eos> No, you won't.
You know, just give me a second.<eos> Of course.<eos> Are you sure?<eos> I don't want to mess anything up for you.<eos> You won't.
It actually, uh, it nearly fell down the drain while I was washing up.<eos> Honey, we have a reservation.<eos> Yes.<eos> We'll figure it out tomorrow.<eos> Yep, we will.
Dr. Zeke says I am.<eos> BP's normal, drip worked.<eos> That's good news.<eos> you come in here every day this week so I can check your BP and make sure you're taking your meds.<eos> I will.
Charlie called Moretti, told him to meet him at the casino, first thing in the morning when the banks open.<eos> Once you turn over the $10 million, he'll turn over Nadine.<eos> And then we'll arrest him for Sam's murder.<eos> And what if he smells a trap?<eos> He won't.
Krystal Ball and the reindeer nose.<eos> - Well, she lost.<eos> - Yes.<eos> But she didn't release it.<eos> You will.
Well, I wasn't aware of that.<eos> You wanna know why?<eos> Because you also moved the calendars.<eos> Listen, Ed, if you don't like any of this stuff, just make the call.<eos> Oh, I will.
There's no use holding it against them.<eos> Well, Gibbs.<eos> Good luck keeping that head of yours on straight.<eos> Good luck trying to beat my times.<eos> Oh... I will.
Tell you what.<eos> Why don't you go see Dr. Pelikan yourself, and uh, you know, just see what he has to say.<eos> If that's gonna make you feel better, you know, he might have an opinion about how to handle this.<eos> - So go for it.<eos> - Okay, I will.
Does Langley know about this plan?<eos> You mean Joan.<eos> Joan appreciates resourcefulness.<eos> All that matters is whether or not the job gets done.<eos> And it will.
You get less for murder.<eos> Imagine that, Paul.<eos> Imagine being married to me for 25 years.<eos> He'll end up killing me.<eos> No, I won't.
My old partner, he, uh... there were a few times he came pretty close.<eos> How do you handle it?<eos> You do everything you can to make sure he never sees the light of day again.<eos> If he walks--<eos> He won't.
Dr. Whitmere warned me it's only temporary.<eos> It's gonna be a long road back.<eos> I'll probably screw it up.<eos> No.<eos> No, you won't.
very hard, but it's not cutting it.<eos> So obviously you're going to have to figure something else out.<eos> Yeah.<eos> And you're a smart girl.<eos> You will.
Tens, twenties?<eos> There's less than two grand here.<eos> I-I...<eos> I promise I'll get all of it somehow.<eos> I will.
- I know.<eos> - Do you hear me?<eos> - I know.<eos> - Haddie.<eos> - Okay. I will.
- I'm gonna miss you. - Mm.<eos> You did the right thing.<eos> She'll get over it.<eos> Yep.<eos> She will.
And no calling Jimmy Patrick.<eos> That's that Christian kid she was with?<eos> Yeah. I'm gonna talk to him.<eos> Oh, no, no, no, I'll talk to him.<eos> No, I will.
Sit down and talk with us for a second.<eos> These guys ain't got what it take.<eos> I can look in their eyes and see it.<eos> First sign of trouble, they're gonna be shitting in their pants.<eos> They will not.
Father...<eos> If the girl is lost, or the ritual fails...<eos> It will not fail.<eos> If it does...<eos> It will not!
Steady on<eos> I've lost him.<eos> You must find my wallet.<eos> It's very important, I have to get it back.<eos> And you will.
just call me 'hyung'.<eos> I only said I feel like...<eos> who wants to call you 'hyung'?<eos> Trying calling and see.<eos> I won't.
And therefore I with a mission.<eos> It becomes dangerous.<eos> We can be kicked out of school. We may even die.<eos> Who is on a prohibited completely mad dip?<eos> I will not.
- Now, you're gonna bust a cap in my ass?<eos> What if I get the ratings up?<eos> We've got six weeks.<eos> What if I move that needle just enough?<eos> - You won't.
All right, thanks.<eos> Little Tokyo. Let's go.<eos> Now are we going to the museum?<eos> Just a sec, honey.<eos> We will.
You will be given the names and addresses of all the salons.<eos> You will go to every one of them and sell these.<eos> Understand?<eos> No.<eos> You will.
Khan, thank God.<eos> Where were you all these days?<eos> I was so worried about you.<eos> You could have called.<eos> But no, you won't.
That's just not good enough.<eos> Thank you for asking for leniency for me.<eos> I didn't do it for you, I did it for your mom.<eos> My mom won't forgive me.<eos> She will.
Is there any way we could pretend that maybe we go back in time... and just forget about the phone ringing, and my brother's message...<eos> - and we never had this conversation?<eos> - Why?<eos> If we open the door and go down that road... any chance that we had of having something normal will just be gone.<eos> It just will.
Only two and a half hours.<eos> Time is going to fly.<eos> I'll stay here.<eos> Suit yourself.<eos> I will.
In all my life, I never thought I'd see you down on one knee.<eos> Yeah, it's getting a bit damp down here, so...<eos> What's it to be, Anna from Boston?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, I will.
Well, just give it to me now.<eos> -Don't.<eos> -Why?<eos> -He'll shoot you.<eos> -I will not.
That's what... It's what we all want.<eos> At least I got the gumption to take it.<eos> You'd be very foolish to underestimate me, James.<eos> I could have you killed.<eos> Yeah, but you won't.
The guard is gonna kill her.<eos> I need to be in that elevator right now!<eos> Move!<eos> Please don't let him kill me, Ben.<eos> I won't.
I think it's the best bloody idea you've ever had.<eos> One condition-- I want a pound for every body you sell.<eos> A pound? - - Man starts getting fancy clothes... also starts getting fancy ideas.<eos> Just think of it as a tax between a man and a wife.<eos> A kind of nuptial agreement, if you will.
No.<eos> You know, we'll figure it out.<eos> We'll just...we'll just figure it out.<eos> I know that you keep saying that we're gonna figure it out... but we haven't.<eos> But we will.
We are doing very well alone, ain't we Martin?<eos> - Are you going to the colony?<eos> - Yes, if I may.<eos> Of course you may. Will you?<eos> Sure, I will then!
You will be in school next summer.<eos> No, I will not.<eos> I will only go to kindergarten.<eos> - Why would you not go to school?<eos> - I just will not.
- How much?<eos> - 50?<eos> I could lose my job.<eos> No no, he's not going for it.<eos> Yes he will.
Jorge forged it.<eos> Jorge, please, tell them to play the newsreel again!<eos> Okay, we'll talk to them later.<eos> We can't now.<eos> But you will, right?
- Where are you going?<eos> - To Anna's place.<eos> - Don't go!<eos> - We'll come with you.<eos> No, you won't, you piglets.
They'll handle it.<eos> - How?<eos> - We'll settle out of court.<eos> - I intend to confess.<eos> - No, you won't.
Go on.<eos> Don't tell nobody it was me who told you this, okay?<eos> But you're going to have to go on up the hill and ask for a talk with Thump Milton.<eos> Now, I hope he'll talk with you.<eos> He generally won't.
- Tonight's the night.<eos> - And what night is that?<eos> The night you finally fall for me.<eos> - I wouldn't hold your breath.<eos> - Oh, I will.
Well, hell, let's change that.<eos> Hey, can I get a beer for my poor relation?<eos> We'll be seeing you.<eos> You know, Giddons finds out that you and Bo have been chatting, he's gonna send you right back up, you know?<eos> He probably will anyway.
Do you hear me?<eos> !<eos> A billion years of Time Lord history riding on our backs.<eos> I will not let this perish.<eos> I will not!
Should free up 60 men at least.<eos> Rutledge?<eos> This is over 90 feet deep.<eos> I shouldn't have thought an electric pump would lift water that high...<eos> The new ones will, sir.
-l threw that Kraut out.<eos> That's no reason to hit him on the head with a lamp.<eos> My daughter is not included in the rent.<eos> How will you make up for this?<eos> -Yes, daddy, how will you?
Tomorrow I'm going to the consulate and check out the hostels.<eos> Call me when you know something.<eos> And check your e-mail from time to time.<eos> She might write.<eos> I will.
Now all will know you're aboard.<eos> Crew in place.<eos> We'll sit here at anchor until the storm blows through.<eos> At least I won't get seasick.<eos> No, you won't.
Take it!<eos> He was here.<eos> People saw him only a few minutes ago.<eos> I know, I got the same story, and something about a... dancing, and apparently, quite well.<eos> Will dancing?
Not with that, asshole!<eos> I want proper tools.<eos> What tools, you arrogant prick?<eos> Use this!<eos> Fine, I will.
I'm so excited! Hm.<eos> Fuck you, you delusional dick, fuck!<eos> Such ugly, ugly words from a pretty, pretty girl.<eos> You are never gonna find a man with a mouth like that, are you, Shade?<eos> Or will ya?
Young pietros!<eos> How does the day find you?<eos> As the night, filled with worry.<eos> Barca never returned.<eos> Nor will he.
- Green.<eos> But it's the best bit!<eos> Yes, it is.<eos> I'll never eat Roquefort again! Ever!<eos> - You will, and your mother too, tonight.
You ain't gotta love him.<eos> You lie under him, bear his kids, keep his bloodline going.<eos> -Especially now that you done ruined mine.<eos> -l can't go back there.<eos> I won't.
Okay.<eos> It's all right.<eos> They're on their way.<eos> But it could have been a hell of a lot worse.<eos> Well, I'll you what,
- It is none of our business.<eos> Oh, my--<eos> You need to tell bill.<eos> Well, you're assuming she hasn't already.<eos> All right, I will.
What does it look like?<eos> This is all useless garbage.<eos> All right, you need to stop, all right?<eos> Why, because this is gonna mean something?<eos> It won't.
But this is an error -- pure and simple.<eos> An error I hold you personally responsible for.<eos> [ keys clacking ] [ indistinct voice over p.A. ] It won't happen again.<eos> No.<eos> It will not.
I need whipped cream.<eos> Unless you think the strawberries are gonna magically stick to the waffles by themselves.<eos> Not so fast.<eos> Say "please."<eos> I will not.
That's enough!<eos> He would have killed me!<eos> Mr Fincher, what I've just seen constitutes a criminal assault.<eos> If your wife wants to press charges...<eos> She won't.
no!<eos> You bastards!<eos> You can't just leave me here!<eos> Man: They can.<eos> And they will.
SHAZ: 'Standing by.'<eos> It's nearly 12.<eos> Could have done with Ray and Chris here.<eos> They'll show.<eos> No, they won't.
I take the urn to bed with me, and I talk to him about my day.<eos> 16 years,<eos> I've been asking him for advice and and waiting to hear his laugh, and for him to tell me that he loves me.<eos> And he never does.<eos> And he never will.
And we get into bed with a guy likhobbes,<eos> There is no turning back.<eos> She has my son.<eos> If I have to cross a line to blow that bitch out of the sky,<eos> I will.
- I joined the peace ambassadors.<eos> You don't have to be afraid of the v's anymore.<eos> I'm not afraid of the visitors, ty.<eos> I'm just afraid of losing you.<eos> You won't.
This is my family.<eos> - Come on. - It's the only way to keep him safe.<eos> Devon, we'll be with you every step of the way.<eos> If you tell me you can get me through this, I trust you.<eos> I will, Devon.
Will you come with me?<eos> Well, it's the full moon tomorrow.<eos> I don't want to go on my own.<eos> Of course, yeah.<eos> Course I will.
Da!<eos> No!<eos> Surrender, traitor!<eos> I'd rather die for Maud.<eos> Then so will every man, woman and child in this keep!
I will reward you with what gold we capture.<eos> William will be punished for the evil he has done, and the blood of your wives and children will be avenged!<eos> There's not enough of us to take a castle!<eos> We'll never make it inside the gate.<eos> Oh yes, we will.
I can even send her supervisor along.<eos> But I... cannot do that actually, um...<eos> He is busy.<eos> I'm sure she'll be able to handle the problem herself.<eos> She-she will indeed, absolutely.
And you take over on tour.<eos> What counts is a strong presence.<eos> What's said is meaningless unless the right person says it.<eos> For me, the only obstacle is being afraid to let me down.<eos> But you won't.
Hey, obviously I can't get to the phone right now, so at the beep you know what to do.<eos> Hey...<eos> I guess you're sleeping.<eos> You're not going to believe this.<eos> Actually... You probably will.
You want me to come with you?<eos> I would love to see this train-wreck in person because it's so much better than reality tv.<eos> Take my advice on this.<eos> Do this alone.<eos> I will.
Sang-jun...<eos> I think Jung-woo's awake...<eos> He'll go back to sleep<eos> What if he hears him and wakes up?<eos> He won't...
You were supposed to help me find my mom.<eos> Have you even tried?<eos> Look, I'm sorry, all right?<eos> No excuses.<eos> I will.
Finding her will be your job.<eos> I find her and then what?<eos> I reproduce the aliens.<eos> Reproduce?<eos> And the world will...?
You're still off-colour, and besides -<eos> I know what you're going to say.<eos> There really is a maniac on the loose.<eos> Will you stay indoors? For me?<eos> Of course I will.
You have to go.<eos> - I'm not supposed to have strangers in the house. - Quite right.<eos> But may I use your bathroom?<eos> You know my mother will be home soon. You should go.<eos> We will.
Jesus!<eos> What if these things move?<eos> They've been here for millions of years.<eos> They're not gonna move.<eos> - Sure they will!
Will, you're in charge.<eos> And the rest of you had better be fast asleep by the time I get back.<eos> It's OK, Janie.<eos> We'll get it back.<eos> No, we won't.
You want me to make you something to eat?<eos> Let's forget what happened.<eos> It's no big deal.<eos> -Call me a thief, then.<eos> -I won't.
Just tell them what you told me.<eos> Just tell the police everything, and we can get on with our lives.<eos> Look, I believe you.<eos> I do.<eos> And so will they.
I don't know about that.<eos> She's the one who called and asked me, so...<eos> Well, you know she's changed since boarding school, and, uh, there's... there's no way she's gonna go to a state dinner wearing a jacket filled with pills.<eos> I probably won't tell her about that then.<eos> Well, then maybe I will.
-He's gonna die, man.<eos> -Put down the gun, Beirada.<eos> I won't put it fucking down.<eos> Put it down because he won't shoot anymore.<eos> -He will, brother.
If you find out something, let me know.<eos> I'm telling you.<eos> It will get bad, shit.<eos> -Why it will get bad?<eos> -because it will!
If I've never met him, I wouldn't know him.<eos> I mean, it's not like we all hang out together at the vamp bar and grill.<eos> You brought me to a bar?<eos> Damon, I'm not old enough. They're not going to let me in.<eos> Sure they will.
Although, is Phoebe there?<eos> Yes.<eos> So...<eos> I will now drink eight glasses of milk in three minutes. No.<eos> No, you won't. No, you won't.
Yeah, gonna put in a request to transfer next church.<eos> That in's on Tig, brother.<eos> We'll make it happen.<eos> All right, man.<eos> We will?
We hired a guy to help track him down.<eos> Going to take Gemma, head out after Nate's taken care of.<eos> Did you tell Gemma about Abel?<eos> Not yet.<eos> We will.
A rider arrived with news that the Seeker had driven back the D'Harans at the Battle of Rising Ridge.<eos> It was one man against hundreds.<eos> It inspired us to break through the D'Haran line.<eos> I hope you get the chance to tell him that story.<eos> I will.
You've had to do that a lot lately.<eos> I'm pretty sure nobody thinks I can do this movie.<eos> Since when do you give a crap about what anybody else thinks?<eos> It's just... what if I screw up?<eos> You won't.
Yeah, yeah, it shouldn't- that shouldn't be a problem.<eos> This should be... fast.<eos> These are, uh, some photos of some folks that I work with.<eos> Just wanted to see if maybe you recognize any of them.<eos> Uh, yeah, maybe I will.
It's not fair. The historical society is honoring my father tonight.<eos> I can't have this overshadowing the evening Or anything else.<eos> This way, the case will be sealed.<eos> The press won't know.<eos> No one will.
And the safety's off so be careful, it could go off for, like no reason.<eos> Now what're these pills?<eos> Oh, just antihistamines mostly.<eos> You just rest, Ms. Archer. We'll take care of these DD-14s for you.<eos> Damn right you will. Idiot.
No, I...<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes.<eos> Do that.<eos> I will.
...to be corrupt.<eos> Shit, fuck...<eos> You pig, I told you not to eat in my car.<eos> - You'll clean it, you hear me?<eos> - Okay, I will.
Everybody in this country deserves a fair trial.<eos> After the pre-recorded studio debate we are returning to the special on the arrest of Jiøí Kajínek.<eos> You pig, I told you not to eat in my car.<eos> - You'll clean it, you hear me?<eos> - Okay, I will.
She needs us right now.<eos> No, what she needs is to fight.<eos> And you need to stop acting like you know what's best for everyone, because you don't.<eos> If you leave, you're gonna regret this.<eos> Maybe. Maybe I will.
My girl.<eos> One of the things that make Waldorf women so special is that we don't fit in everywhere.<eos> But I don't feel like I fit in anywhere.<eos> That's 'cause you haven't found the right place yet.<eos> You will.
We were all having a really horrible week and you took our minds off it.<eos> Yeah. I had my first student drop my class.<eos> It sucked. I met my soul mate and he never called me back.<eos> I mean, yet.<eos> He will. He will.
Shh! He's an ass.<eos> What are you doing with all this stuff?<eos> I thought there might be something About my birth parents.<eos> Have you told jeremy?<eos> I will.
Just l need to know that you're okay.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I'm okay.<eos> Stop by tomorrow and drop off your ID badge and all that, you know.<eos> Yeah, I will.
And when I tell Pam... so will everybody in the office.<eos> - Oh, is that how you wanna play it?<eos> Fine! Keep your stupid bounty, then!<eos> And keep your pathetic, clingy boyfriend.<eos> I will.
It really doesn't make any sense.<eos> Who would want to hurt her?<eos> That's what we're trying to figure out, ma'am.<eos> You find the person who did this.<eos> We will.
I am rather bemused, I must confess.<eos> Three days till His Reverend comes to consecrate the new font, and I have not received an invitation to tea at the Rectory.<eos> Oh, I received mine two weeks ago.<eos> I have heard that the Bishop is extremely fond of Queen cake, so I will need you to prepare me some rose water, Minnie.<eos> I surely will, ma'am.
But maybe it took me coming up here to realize<eos> The only reason this trip means anything to me Is because I get to come home to you.<eos> You're my world, baby.<eos> I love you with all my heart.<eos> I always will.
It's for Jessie.<eos> Aw, thanks, Judith.<eos> I'll bring the tray down when I'm done.<eos> Actually, I've been thinking and I want you to have it.<eos> A passing of the tray, if you will.
I've never been to a house-warming before.<eos> What do you suppose will happen? We don't know.<eos> Anything could happen.<eos> Isn't that why parties are fun?<eos> And perhaps it will!
Ask if I can have a day's work?<eos> Edmund!<eos> Do Ma and Pa know about this?<eos> It was Pa's idea.<eos> Will you?
Well, if you two are gonna go, you better go now before the other Interpol team gets here.<eos> Right now?<eos> Now.<eos> We'll hand over Arnaldo. We'll handle it.<eos> Well, I will.
I don't know.<eos> He's 19.<eos> Eventually, we gotta let him live a normal life.<eos> He's never gonna have a normal life.<eos> None of us will.
Mwah. See ya, boys!<eos> Thanks for driving!<eos> Bye, gaby!<eos> Don't forget to friend us!<eos> Oh, I won't, fernando.
Enjoy yourself.<eos> You're going to be in the presence of something that I've dreamed of seeing for decades.<eos> I just hope you'll be able to appreciate the magnitude of where you are and what it represents.<eos> I'll talk to Leonard.<eos> You will?
Oh!<eos> And little chocolates!<eos> This is going to be the best Valentine's Day ever.<eos> Yeah, I forgot about all this.<eos> But I never will.
You're finally admitting you never had it?<eos> You got closer than anyone else.<eos> We got closer,<eos> But that didn't work out.<eos> Maybe it will this time.
Cass and Bobby think so.<eos> I'm not so sure.<eos> Well, they're right.<eos> Because either it's a trap to get me there, to make me say yes, or it's not a trap and I'm gonna say yes anyway.<eos> And I will.
Well, they're right.<eos> Because either it's a trap to get me there, to make me say yes, or it's not a trap and I'm gonna say yes anyway.<eos> And I will.<eos> I'll do it... fair warning.<eos> No, you won't.
Then what?<eos> Say you guys get involved.<eos> What happens if you decide you made a huge mistake?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Maybe I won't.
That ain't the point of it.<eos> What if she dies and I don't?<eos> We must achieve speed, child.<eos> Speed and perfection.<eos> I surely will, ma'am.
For the first time in my life, I feel like I want to run.<eos> If my husband hears any of this...<eos> Oh, I can't bear it.<eos> I want to vanish away.<eos> But you won't.
I thought he was with his friends.<eos> He was.<eos> Just not in a good way.<eos> You want to speak to him.<eos> I will.
But I think...<eos> Yes, you could be something I'm proud of.<eos> I'll never forget you.<eos> No.<eos> You won't.
- Yeah.<eos> - Please don't say it.<eos> I'm still feeling queasy.<eos> Who's going to start?<eos> I will.
She was my baby.<eos> She was a bright light in this world.<eos> You have to live for her, too.<eos> I will.<eos> I will.
Okay, I guess I should get going.<eos> I'm really sorry.<eos> That's all right.<eos> Say goodbye to your dad for me.<eos> I will.
Uh, give me a second?<eos> I don't know what to say.<eos> Well, I didn't do it for you.<eos> You take care of them, you hear?<eos> I will.
What are you, his Realtor?<eos> No, he's right.<eos> Now is a great time - shut up, Gary!<eos> We have been laboring under the impression that you were gonna pay us with a portion of the recovered money.<eos> And I will.
No one wants to kiss a girl in black.<eos> Oh, do stop admiring yourself.<eos> He's not marrying you for your looks.<eos> That's if he wants to marry you at all.<eos> He will.
I know, right?<eos> Hey, I found some red.<eos> Wait.<eos> You two made up?<eos> Not yet, but we will.
He'll either sign me or marry me.<eos> Either way, this just might be the first day of the rest of my life.<eos> I... I can't represent you.<eos> He decided to sign you?<eos> Not yet, but he will.
Thank you.<eos> Is Mom still mad at me?<eos> It's not you, buddy.<eos> Your mother really loves you.<eos> She always will. Promise.
And he knows I like wings.<eos> I don't even like pizza that much.<eos> Oh, Amy, you will get through this.<eos> You will.<eos> No, I won't.
It's fancelli's study, "statua di vulcano."<eos> This is beautiful.<eos> Looks like the real thing.<eos> Don't let it fool you.<eos> I won't.
GLASS SMASHES Oh, Lizzie!<eos> It's all right.<eos> We can mend it. Don't look so fearful.<eos> But you said we must win, Mrs Brown.<eos> We will, girls.
Hey.<eos> Trust me.<eos> Thank you.<eos> But I don't think talking me off a ledge is gonna help us solve our technical difficulties.<eos> Okay, uh, well, then maybe this will.
This isn't a game.<eos> It's not fair.<eos> I know.<eos> Well, tell him, please.<eos> I will.
It shoves air into her and it sucks it out.<eos> She's hooked up to this, this, a... ll this crap.<eos> That's not life.<eos> I want her to have peace.<eos> - She will.
That is a fact.<eos> We got a picture of him up on broad street bridge, so...<eos> Ladonna, look, I'm gonna do everything I can to help.<eos> Like I say, it's been crazy around here, But I promise I'll make some calls, See what kind of strings I can pull.<eos> I will.
It's a two-year-old's birthday party, you'll have help, and no one cares.<eos> Is he coming?<eos> I told him about it.<eos> Now I can only hope he won't show up and ruin it.<eos> Well, he won't.
I heard you can get a buzz off that.<eos> Don't go through my things.<eos> Claire's not gonna give me anything.<eos> be patient.<eos> She will.
Yeah. Even bobby, sort of.<eos> Well, that, my friend, is what it feels like When you don't have to keep a secret anymore--<eos> Relief.<eos> I just feel like everything's gonna change.<eos> It will.
Sometimes I still think...<eos> One day I might catch whoever did it.<eos> I was alone for a long time.<eos> But I found my place.<eos> You will too.
You are young.<eos> Your whole life hangs on this moment.<eos> - You must find the courage to speak. - You think it will help.<eos> You all think it will mend everything if I say.<eos> It won't.
I'm going to stop here at the pub, until I hear from you.<eos> Oh, and take your time.<eos> I'd rather wait a week for the right answer than get a wrong one in a hurry.<eos> Think about it carefully.<eos> I will.
I suppose not, my lady.<eos> You shall have one, too.<eos> I thought this would be suitable for your interview.<eos> - I won't be wearing it, my lady.<eos> - Of course you will.
So, do we break a patient's confidence and disobey her orders?<eos> We can't. Lfshe's forbidden it.<eos> - I must say I agree with you.<eos> - Well, I'll tell him.<eos> No, you will not.
For us.<eos> But we are not that far off.<eos> We might just finish this thing by the time you have to leave.<eos> No.<eos> We won't.
If he finds out...<eos> I can handle him.<eos> And what about Paddy?<eos> Cos when he hears...<eos> He won't.
But if you tell me, you might be able to help me.<eos> You might be able to help daddy, help a whole load of people we don't even know.<eos> If I tell... tell you... Mm-hmm?<eos> S... something bad will happen.<eos> No. No, it won't.
Remember? Your shoes didn't fit.<eos> That's why your feet were bleeding.<eos> But I liked those shoes.<eos> I know. We'll get you some more shoes.<eos> We will.
Just being a gentleman?<eos> Maya left with rachel, not me.<eos> I was on the overnight shift Both nights those girls were here.<eos> You can check the timecards.<eos> We will.
Janey, stop.<eos> I will go anywhere you want.<eos> Just please get away from him.<eos> Please.<eos> No, she won't.
I thought we cared about each other.<eos> Yeah, I did too.<eos> I thought the only thing keeping us apart Was that you wanted to live in Cleveland,<eos> But you'll move to New York for Kaitlin.<eos> Yeah, I will.
I'd best go.<eos> Me and you, Minnie... it just ain't possible.<eos> Minnie, we are going to bake scones and ginger biscuits and lay on herrings and sausages and pastries for tea tomorrow.<eos> I am inviting a guest, and we must excel ourselves.<eos> We surely will, ma'am.
I bid you all a good night.<eos> Happy New Year!<eos> [All]: Happy New Year, Your Majesty!<eos> I wonder... will you have some more wine, Lady Anne?<eos> With pleasure, if your Majesty will.
If I find out I'm pregnant, then it's my choice as to what I do.<eos> It's not your choice, and it's not Jack's choice.<eos> If you two ever get pregnant, then it'll be your choice.<eos> Adrian, I just want you to do the right thing.<eos> I will, Grace.
Through retribution.<eos> Through retribution, yeah.<eos> Society doesn't have any other way.<eos> Well, that won't give them peace of mind, George.<eos> What will?
I mean...<eos> I-it was just a moment of weakness.<eos> And I promise you, it will never, ever happen again.<eos> You're right.<eos> It won't.
She'll live.<eos> What are you doing here, anyway?<eos> I thought you had some huge announcement to make.<eos> And I'm trying to make sure It doesn't turn into a list of apologies from major crimes.<eos> It won't.
Can I have a moment?<eos> Two years ago, Kevin Mason failed because of a dead cellphone, but this time I'm convinced he's better prepared, and it's going to be a catastrophe.<eos> If you cancel this funeral and no bomb is found, you will embarrass the department, and you will never be Chief.<eos> I'll risk it.<eos> No, you won't.
I would hate for what's gone on between us the past few weeks, you know, my behavior...<eos> To completely cancel out everything we've been through together.<eos> Let me just say... I'm sorry.<eos> And, uh, I'll see you tomorrow.<eos> Yes, you will.
Of course.<eos> Which is why we'll screw her first.<eos> Meg and her little posse are dead the second we're done with them.<eos> - Yeah, if they don't kill us.<eos> - Oh, they won't.
Dad, he's gone.<eos> Theodore?<eos> When I fed him his quinoa salad with wheat berries, I must not have closed the cage door all the way, and now he's gone, and Ashley's going to hate me.<eos> Oh, he's not gonna hate you. He'll understand.<eos> No, he won't.
That's right.<eos> Look, guys, we don't have a lot of time.<eos> Let's get to work.<eos> What if bobby comes back?<eos> He won't.
There's someone outside who wants to see you.<eos> Priscilla's sister.<eos> Will you see her?<eos> I think it means a lot to her.<eos> Will you?
I love you, Ty,<eos> Either way.<eos> Please trust that.<eos> You need to go talk to your mom about this.<eos> Yeah, I will.
He went up there looking for me, and they caught him.<eos> - I haven't heard anything.<eos> - Yeah, well, he's up there, okay,<eos> - And I need you to find him, all right?<eos> - I will.
Shaw has won.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> Don't worry, buddy, we'll get Shaw.<eos> No, we won't.
- You all right?<eos> - Yeah, I'm fine.<eos> Just we have to do this faster.<eos> - We will.<eos> We will, okay?
It's not nothing.<eos> You said you'd take care of it, and you did, and appreciate that.<eos> So does Jason.<eos> Tell him you're welcome.<eos> I will.
Penny jogs.<eos> Maybe you guys can run together.<eos> That's an excellent idea.<eos> Yeah, if we chat, it will create the illusion of time going faster.<eos> No, it won't.
There's another masseuse.<eos> The same thing.<eos> Bummer.<eos> I'll go talk to Lara.<eos> No, I will.
You're being paranoid.<eos> (buzzer sounds) Can you tell them I'm not like that?<eos> Tell the judge it's just an act.<eos> I'm not a bad girl.<eos> I will.
I understand that you love shocking people and you think living like this is a good idea right now.<eos> But just do me a favor and take it.<eos> Okay.<eos> I'll give it to the salvation army.<eos> No, you will not.
I wish you would stop making things so uncomfortable.<eos> I wish you would accept the fact that Navid is my boyfriend.<eos> That's two.<eos> Things have to change, Javier. I'm serious.<eos> They will.
That's not going to happen.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Math rules.<eos> I'm going to win it.<eos> I will.
Is he with CAA?<eos> No, he's right here.<eos> With his buddies?<eos> Maybe this will help something open up.<eos> Oh, it will.
I had ink on my hands, I grabbed the bat, I killed her.<eos> That's not what happened.<eos> Please... just let me be a father to my son, for once.<eos> You have to understand, I have to do something.<eos> And you will.
Are those avocados?<eos> Where did you get them?<eos> - How much? - Don't worry about that.<eos> - Liv, what if it happens again?<eos> - It won't.
They say it's a broken heart, but...<eos> I hurt in my whole body.<eos> I mean, what if I stay like this forever?<eos> What if I never get over Chuck?<eos> You will.
Thank you for being the one person who believed in me...<eos> Even though it turns out you were wrong, too.<eos> I wasn't wrong to believe in you.<eos> I still do.<eos> I always will.
Obviously.<eos> Well, I'm off to buy gently worn items in the 12th.<eos> And don't worry.<eos> Not even you choosing a Humphrey will ruin my date.<eos> Nothing will. Mm.
Well... I should get back to Anne.<eos> I meant it, Blair...<eos> With all my heart.<eos> You gonna say something this time?<eos> I will.
Get out!<eos> Get out!<eos> No!<eos> I don't want to hurt you.<eos> You won't.
For a split second, I hoped she'd die.<eos> Look, whatever this is inside me,<eos> I don't want any part of it.<eos> I don't ever want to feel that way again.<eos> I won't.
Thank you, miss flowers.<eos> You've been such a wonderful help.<eos> Oh, it's my pleasure, dear.<eos> Let me know if there's anything else I can do.<eos> I will.
Yeah, cold feet speak now.<eos> I don't want this going wrong<eos> Because someone chickens out.<eos> Caroline?<eos> I won't.
Thank you.<eos> So are you.<eos> I wish I could stay and talk, but I'm late for the "messiah" at Disney hall.<eos> Uh, will you call me?<eos> Y-yeah, I will.
You're such a good liar.<eos> She'd have made a great lawyer.<eos> Sarah, this is ridiculous.<eos> You have to tell him the truth about your age.<eos> I will, mom.
- Mom... look, sweetheart, you have to talk all of this out.<eos> That's what you have to do.<eos> Mom...<eos> - honestly, she... she'll come back.<eos> - No, she won't, mom.
Johnny, this town is up and down, up and down.<eos> You know that.<eos> I mean, look at me.<eos> I was done, but I came back.<eos> - And you will too.
- It's really, really hard.<eos> - Yes.<eos> Please be careful.<eos> Come home soon.<eos> I will.
I'll give you credit.<eos> Most people, there'd be a blood stain on my carpet right now.<eos> You made a mistake coming in here.<eos> You'll never find Bailey without my help.<eos> [ Scoffs ] Yeah, I will.
Let's go!<eos> Not you.<eos> You leave.<eos> I will not leave.<eos> Oh, yeah, you will.
All our memories and dreams... our everyday lives...gone.<eos> As if they never existed.<eos> Aren't I right?<eos> But you don't have to be the one to do it.<eos> Somebody else will...
And what is it that matters to you?<eos> Because clearly it is not us.<eos> Do you want me to find another job teaching at a different college?<eos> Do you want to pick up and move again?<eos> Because I will.
- Wait here, I go in and look.<eos> - No!<eos> I beg you!<eos> - Come on!<eos> - I will not.
He can't hurt you again, OK?<eos> How do you know?<eos> You didn't find him.<eos> You're right.<eos> But I will.
Okay.<eos> there we go.<eos> Perfect.<eos> Woman: i've heard that redheads have a lower tolerance of pain, But i don't actually know a large enough sample group To confirm or deny that, so we'll see what happens today.<eos> Narrator: we sure will...
And I think it took its toll on me.<eos> - I'm soy to hear that.<eos> - So maybe work is the only place I feel like I have se control.<eos> - Would you reconsider your position on the clinic?<eos> - Oh, no, I won't.
Even before bawds and pimps.<eos> And these are sworn statements of his behavior?<eos> They are, my Lord.<eos> Are you going to investigate further?<eos> Yes, I will.
I'm stateside now.<eos> I'm almost to Idaho.<eos> You're not gonna make it.<eos> I just need more time.<eos> Yes, I will.
I'm almost to Idaho.<eos> You're not gonna make it.<eos> I just need more time.<eos> Yes, I will.<eos> I will.
- So?<eos> - What if he threw your birthday party To steal the letterhead?<eos> - Are you actually being serious?<eos> So why don't you ask dad about the letterhead?<eos> - I will.
Well put, Mountstuart, yeah.<eos> Good. Yeah. Good.<eos> Well, what you see here is SPK Working Circle - Communication.<eos> We're a small group.<eos> A cell, if you will.
The Detroit mob?<eos> Yeah.<eos> All right, I'm gonna have to convince Oswald I'm in with them.<eos> What if he recognizes you?<eos> He won't.
Then finally we are ready.<eos> Not quite.<eos> Merlin suspects me.<eos> Has he told Arthur?<eos> Not yet, but he will.
It will be alright, darling, I promise.<eos> Your mum's right, mate.<eos> It's going to hurt like a bastard for a while.<eos> But it'll get better.<eos> No, it won't.
Deserved?<eos> Who the fuck are you?<eos> Leave that shit to God and look after business.<eos> She starts shooting her mouth off...<eos> - She won't.
It means I'll be married, right?<eos> May it bring you better luck than it did me.<eos> The first lady of the United States.<eos> What will you do, nan, if he doesn't send for you?<eos> Well, of course he will.
Okay, you're gonna stay here, and I'm gonna be back.<eos> Please, it's not safe for us to be here.<eos> Sean, you're still bleeding, and you need a doctor.<eos> They'll arrest us.<eos> No, they won't.
Don't get sensitive on me.<eos> I fucking suck too right now.<eos> I'm in the darkest Third World hole I've ever been in in my entire life about a thousand hundred million miles from where I should be and the only way for me to get back there is for us to join forces.<eos> If we can make enough noise down here then just maybe, everyone in America will hear us.<eos> Everyone will.
Just how much jail time do you want to do?<eos> Because every minute of silence Piles on the time!<eos> I want you to think about that.<eos> she'll talk.<eos> No, dad, she won't.
Isn't that right, Mr. Spencer?<eos> Gus here is a whiz at legal zoom, and my cousin has a personal injury law firm called accidentes.<eos> Heard of it?<eos> - No, I haven't.<eos> - You will. You will.
Now will you admit that your book is dated and that I have more game than you?<eos> - I will not.<eos> - All right.<eos> Will you admit that you tried to murder me last night by poisoning my person?<eos> I certainly will not.
No.<eos> No, I don't think so.<eos> I know Ricky's never going to forgive me.<eos> Some day.<eos> Some day he will.
Well, I don't know.<eos> We'll just have to see, won't we?<eos> Let's go.<eos> I don't care if the Colonel forgives him.<eos> I never will.
See you, flower.<eos> Are you all right, love?<eos> I'm fine.<eos> Please, just go home, Mrs Potter.<eos> Yeah, I will.
Marry him because... you want his face beside yours in a scrapbook your grandkids are looking through, because you can't stand the thought of not waking up next to him when you're 80.<eos> You're making him your life.<eos> Why are you saying this?<eos> You're scaring me, like we're not gonna see each other again.<eos> We won't, baby.
She needs to be convinced that taking the stand<eos> Equals doing what's right.<eos> - I thought she understood that.<eos> - She does.<eos> She will.
- Scott...<eos> - Licensing info.<eos> - Wow, thank you so much for doing all this.<eos> - Consider this a promise that you will get your money back.<eos> And you will.
Yeah.<eos> Oh, look... "knuckle-puss."<eos> Let's put that in the pre-hate file.<eos> We're never gonna find another artist.<eos> Yes, we will.
I'll be happy for leftovers.<eos> I cannot handle any more canned food.<eos> Get out of there.<eos> Don't forget to save the wishbone for me.<eos> - I won't.
Playing gay. Did you like the little touch with the underwear?<eos> - People have died.<eos> - (SHOUTING) That's what people do!<eos> - I will stop you.<eos> - No, you won't.
It's reality.<eos> Rough edges are great.<eos> K.K., you've got visitors.<eos> I love Chelsea.<eos> I always will.
I really believe that.<eos> So we're too late?<eos> Maybe.<eos> I mean, if she did lie and she was pregnant and she did get an abortion, but we don't know that that's what happened, and if she wants to tell us that that's what happened, then she'll tell us, and if she doesn't tell us, then we leave it at that.<eos> Maybe some day she will.
You gonna get involved then?<eos> She's not going to do that.<eos> You never know, son.<eos> What if she does?<eos> She won't.
Jeff told me.<eos> Actually, I thought it was kind of funny, but I'm sure it was much funnier when you said it.<eos> Okay, you know, I think it's great.<eos> You should get a job.<eos> I will.
I think sometimes it is.<eos> I'm going to offer Beth a job.<eos> We need different kinds of people here.<eos> In fact, I'd like you to tell her.<eos> I will.
Let her...<eos> - Sink or swim?<eos> - Well, we're not gonna let her sink.<eos> - No, of course.<eos> - Of course you won't.
I invited Johnny Depp.<eos> He's been invited twice, but he won't mind.<eos> I've invited her again.<eos> Look, if you invite Angelina, she won't come.<eos> She will.
He's been invited twice, but he won't mind.<eos> I've invited her again.<eos> Look, if you invite Angelina, she won't come.<eos> She will.<eos> No, she won't.
Doctor!<eos> We good to go, then?<eos> The controls won't respond.<eos> They're isomorphic, tuned to your brainwaves, they'll only respond to you.<eos> They won't.
Wherever.<eos> Is that clear?<eos> Yeah, yeah.<eos> In the future, when I come here with a case full of money... and I ask you to do something, you say...<eos> "Yes, sir, I will."
Erm, erm, right, yeah, I've run out of petrol and will you give me some money so I can fill this?<eos> What?<eos> No.<eos> Well, will you lend me 25 quid then?<eos> No, I won't.
This is the perfect way to hide.<eos> No, it's not right.<eos> Find another way to hide.<eos> Well, the gang might get me.<eos> No, they won't.
You mean the earthquake in Kazakhstan?<eos> Yes, that's it.<eos> I bought a luxury weekend for two at a spa.<eos> Here, check with the organisers.<eos> We will.
He's busy.<eos> We all are.<eos> Sit down.<eos> But we will see him tonight.<eos> No, we won't.
I should have listened to you.<eos> I should have brought you back here, like you asked.<eos> If you want to move back here, then we will.<eos> We'll find a way to make it work.<eos> No, we won't.
All right.<eos> Let's have some champagne.<eos> Great.<eos> Well, I'll have a drink.<eos> You will, for me.
Tell me, do you enjoy thinking about the cow that was skinned to make them, or do you just block that part out for the sake of being fashion-forward?<eos> Fuck you, man.<eos> Curse words were invented by people too stupid to think of an intelligent response.<eos> - You should print that on a T-shirt.<eos> - Yeah, maybe I will, Rebecca.
Yeah, it's common with drowning victims.<eos> Most likely from getting struck against the rocks.<eos> You want to go with me when I notify the family?<eos> No.<eos> But I will.
And... and keep her alive until... I get out of here and finish her with my hands.<eos> I want to feel her blood covering my hands.<eos> I do.<eos> You'll never get out of here.<eos> Oh, yes, I will.
No, no, no, no, no.<eos> It is so much better slowly, to take your time.<eos> You know, all my life, I've been meticulous about finishing what I start.<eos> And that bothers me, because I haven't finished what I started with you.<eos> And you won't, you sick scumbag.
There you are, you see.<eos> Well, let's have a look because Kenhad a go.<eos> He looks good, doesn't he?<eos> He won't be able to do it.<eos> He will.
It's been almost a week.<eos> Isn't that slow enough?<eos> Try it.<eos> Maybe it'll put you in the mood.<eos> It won't.
Night night.<eos> Will you come up later?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Don't forget.<eos> - I won't.
What's ever changed?<eos> Except she's gone and we're still here.<eos> And she would be smiling on down on us right now and she'd be saying, "Make it work. "<eos> She would.<eos> And we will.
Uhh! Get off me!<eos> Okay, ladies, please.<eos> Uhh!<eos> I will never forgive you for this!<eos> Sure you will.
So you can live with it...<eos> Cutshaw, rich guy just gets away with murder?<eos> My deal with him was that his airport went away and he got his pictures back.<eos> I never said I wouldn't come after him for something else.<eos> And I will.
The offer to be your friend?<eos> Well, for us to be friends.<eos> I mean, after all, we're neighbors.<eos> And I don't know. Maybe one day our children will play together.<eos> Yeah, maybe they will.
But it's not too late.<eos> There's still no blood on your hands.<eos> I just want to feel better.<eos> I want all this to go away.<eos> It will.
He wants to play the game he played with his wife.<eos> Debra Wilson played that game and it got her killed, Prentiss.<eos> All right, keep his focus off the crowd long enough for us to take him down.<eos> You guys better have my back.<eos> We will.
Rules that we're making up as we go along, Jim.<eos> Hey, you know what, George?<eos> If I have to explain it to you, maybe it's better if I just handle this one on my own.<eos> I'll pay for it!<eos> Yes, you will!
If they're off after us, we're doomed.<eos> Believe me, fellow, I know this area very well.<eos> We will walk where the car can't access.<eos> They'll quarter around for some time - and go home.<eos> - They won't.
I can't change anything.<eos> Hey, we just did, at the party just now.<eos> We can make our own fate.<eos> We can stop this.<eos> And we will.
I might have gotten it after her.<eos> You need to contact every woman you've been with And notify them of your herpes infestation.<eos> It's the right thing to do.<eos> There's no way I'm gonna do that.<eos> - Then I will.
Even her life.<eos> How about a farewell fuck?<eos> That's crass.<eos> And it won't save you.<eos> - What will? - Nothing.
Christmas is the problem.<eos> He can't keep this pace up anymore.<eos> If he goes out tonight, he'll die.<eos> Well, then who's gonna deliver all the presents?<eos> We will.
I think I'll get over it.<eos> Does that mean you'll keep watching hope?<eos> 'Cause she really likes you.<eos> In fact, you're the only person she likes.<eos> 'Course, I will... for 60 bucks a week.
By any means necessary.<eos> Oh, is that what they say?<eos> I overstepped my bounds.<eos> It'll never happen again.<eos> Yes, it will.
That last bump just made me hit send.<eos> Oh, no.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> I'm sure that everyone will get it's a joke.<eos> No, they won't.
You know why I didn't tell you?<eos> It's cos I didn't want to hear your opinion on it.<eos> I'm sure you've got one.<eos> I haven't said a word.<eos> Hmm, you will.
- How dare you?<eos> Pick it up.<eos> - No, you pick it up.<eos> I will not pick up, for you will be picking it up.<eos> - No I won't.
- No, you pick it up.<eos> I will not pick up, for you will be picking it up.<eos> - No I won't.<eos> - Yes you will.<eos> - No I won't. No I won't.
But it can't work.<eos> You're right.<eos> We need to find another way to do that.<eos> Get in.<eos> And we will...
No, Karen, I am not.<eos> Well, prove it.<eos> Identify Dahl's killer.<eos> Well, if I had carte blanche to do things my way, I would do just that, but they don't give me carte blanche.<eos> The CBI won't, but I will. Deputy?
Oh, of course.<eos> Myka!<eos> Three times.<eos> Don't let her do it three times.<eos> I won't.
We induce cardiac arrest,<eos> But continue to monitor your brain activity<eos> So we can revive you.<eos> What if it doesn't work?<eos> It will.
No!<eos> Dude this sucks!<eos> The hole's still there!<eos> Do you think Benson noticed it?<eos> He won't now!
I believe you...<eos> That you're not going to tell anyone.<eos> Which is why I'm going to give you this.<eos> Just don't leave that in the break room.<eos> I won't.
Yeah, it's unlike me, but you know who it isn't like?<eos> The attorney general.<eos> Like the sound of that?<eos> Take me away, Attorney General.<eos> I will.
You like her now?<eos> Nope. But she got me to the right answer, which none of the rest of you did.<eos> If you want to give her another shot, go for it.<eos> Okay.<eos> I will.
You led me into temptation.<eos> And I followed.<eos> And God will punish you for that.<eos> He has to. 'Cause if he didn't, well, that would make you wonder, wouldn't it ?<eos> He will.
You can't make love if you're wearing chains.<eos> Kick the bishop out the bedroom and that old judge goes too.<eos> Everyone is free to do exactly what they feel, whenever they feel like it.<eos> You'll see a totally different world.<eos> Aye, YOU will!
Out of my house!<eos> Just leave!<eos> I will.<eos> I will, I'll go and I'll tell the police everything.<eos> No, you won't. Why not?
I will.<eos> I will, I'll go and I'll tell the police everything.<eos> No, you won't. Why not?<eos> You don't care about me!<eos> You won't!

Is that it?<eos> After 50 years of friendship?<eos> Stop the operation.<eos> No.<eos> I won't.
Violet, I'm not-- she's a child.<eos> She needs someone. She needs us.<eos> And I am fine.<eos> If we could just get kenny to realize That the rest of his life is not gonna be like this.<eos> Yeah, well, we will.

I'm delighted to hear the news, though.<eos> I couldn't be more thrilled.<eos> She's a wonderful woman.<eos> She'll make a wonderful wife.<eos> No, she won't.
Listen, I'm late for dinner, so, um, I made a list of my patients, their protocols.<eos> basically, everybody's stable.<eos> Just try and keep 'em that way.<eos> And if I need to get in touch with you, sir?<eos> You won't...
I've worked the night shift.<eos> I know what goes on.<eos> I've lived through horror stories of patients falling through the cracks because residents are running around half asleep, and their attendings are nowhere to be found.<eos> - I will not let that happen to my son.<eos> - I won't either.
I'm-I'm-I'm sure it's fine.<eos> But I- - I should go.<eos> Okay.<eos> Well, I suppose you'll call me, if you want to get together again.<eos> Absolutely, I will.
Out federal databases tend to have more detailed information.<eos> Well, how do you know they're more detailed if you haven't seen ours?<eos> It's nothing personal, chief.<eos> It's just, you could have asked.<eos> Next time I will.

Is-is- - Your husband is a fighter.<eos> - I know. I'm so sorry, Erika. Thank you so much for being here for him.<eos> I promise we'll find whomever's responsible.<eos> The Vice President hasn't regained consciousness yet, sir.<eos> Maybe he won't.
Now turn around.<eos> Turn around!<eos> No, I want you to look at my face when you pull the trigger.<eos> You think that's gonna make it harder for me?<eos> It won't.
Do you have any witness to speak on your behalf?<eos> I will.
Mr Farmer...<eos> THEY WHISPER<eos> May we no longer speak to each other?<eos> I will go further than most men will allow a wife such as you.<eos> You will?
My one model provides me with much inspiration.<eos> Your only model.<eos> Did you mention it?<eos> No, not yet, darling.<eos> But I will.
The President.<eos> Oh, the President!<eos> Yes, of course.<eos> - Will you get that to him?<eos> - Of course I will.
Meanwhile, we're collating information about Ribbentrop, and his rumoured liaison with the Simpson woman.<eos> But there are rumours she turned tricks in a Peking brothel.<eos> Rumours that she's actually a man!<eos> None of those have put the King off.<eos> Rumours won't.
Thanks.<eos> When are you leaving?<eos> You've got a doctor's appointment at two o'clock.<eos> -No... I'll cancel that.<eos> -Oh, no you won't.
You are never gonna speak to my children again.<eos> We are done.<eos> Carly.<eos> You know what your problem is, Derek? You can't say "what if."<eos> And you never will.
You know what I mean?<eos> You know what else they say?<eos> They also say sometimes it can help.<eos> You know?<eos> Maybe it will.
I've never seen these constellations before.<eos> Me neither.<eos> We're a long way from home.<eos> When I was a boy I used to imagine sailing to the end of the world... finding my father there.<eos> Maybe you will.
I thought he'd show.<eos> I told you not to come.<eos> They're staking the place out.<eos> - If they find you...<eos> - They won't.
But right now, we really need your help.<eos> You need to tell us where they are,<eos> what they want.<eos> If you tell us that, he's gonna let you live.<eos> No, he won't.
Even if... if you don't agree with him.<eos> I promise.<eos> Andrew.<eos> Promise me you'll work harder to be a part of this family.<eos> I will.
I promise.<eos> Andrew.<eos> Promise me you'll work harder to be a part of this family.<eos> I will.<eos> I will, Gammy.
- He'd rather have a pair of socks, right?<eos> Can I have it?<eos> Oh, sure.<eos> Of course, we'll have to get married to use it.<eos> Well, maybe we just will.

I don't want to see the circus die because of me.<eos> What you're going to have to explain, is why you wrapped them in a sheet because that's something a woman would do out of respect.<eos> You'll also have to explain how you forged their handwriting on a note.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I will.
That was fun.<eos> I never rode in a police car before.<eos> Empty.<eos> I have to throw it away.<eos> Here. I will.

If danger closes in on us once again, you and Aragorn must be protected.<eos> All the Chieftains of the Dúnedain have been fostered for a time in Elrond's halls.<eos> I myself spent years there as a child.<eos> I will not leave you.<eos> I will not!
Now the line of Kings ends!<eos> The line is not broken.<eos> There is still hope!<eos> They will return, Gilraen.<eos> They will.
But there's one thing... I know I'll never forget.<eos> The last thing Pablo said to me the night they killed him.<eos> "Don't worry, Benjamin.<eos> We'll catch that son of a bitch."<eos> And I will.
I don't remember them. Crushed, all four in one go.<eos> Mine are alive.<eos> It'd be weird if they died.<eos> I love them. Don't worry, they won't die.<eos> They will one day but not yet.
I was just walking off the rotted goose anus I had for breakfast, and I thought I'd come by and ask you a little question.<eos> - What's that?<eos> - Will you marry me?<eos> Oh, my God, yes!<eos> Yes, I will, Griffin!

We don't know anything about this baby's father.<eos> And without that family history, I just don't wanna be inviting that into, yeah, I don't wanna be exposing Angelica to that way of thinking.<eos> This will be our baby.<eos> I think we'll have a great influence on its life.<eos> Of course, we will.
If i was putting a body in a freezer, It'd be because i was trying to hide it.<eos> Until you stopped paying for the storage space.<eos> Did i stop, or did something stop me?<eos> It's family moments like these I will never forget.<eos> with a good therapist, Hopefully i will.
I will shoot you.<eos> Joey, don't.<eos> Matty, I'll shoot you.<eos> Joey?<eos> No, you won't.

And now, good friends, as you are friends, scholars and soldiers, give me one poor request.<eos> What is't, my lord? We will.<eos> Never make known what you have seen tonight.<eos> BOTH: My lord, we will not.
Amy,you can't afford to take a day off of school.<eos> You're gonna be missing days when the baby comes.<eos> I can't stand being at school knowing Ben is there ignoring me.<eos> You and Ben will work things out.<eos> No,we won't.
If you still wanna marry me.<eos> I can't wait to marry you.<eos> Would you guys knock it off?<eos> We'll just go wait in the car.<eos> No, you won't.

Hey, hey.<eos> Hands, now!<eos> Our turn now.<eos> We get to find out everything you know about FULCRUM.<eos> No, you won't.
You got to tell them.<eos> It's the only chance you have of not getting fired.<eos> No, no, no, no, no.<eos> They won't find out.<eos> Lightman will.
I guess it's just 'cause, well, I'm the only one who knows.<eos> I know.<eos> I know.<eos> I should tell Brooke -- the whole "no secrets" thing.<eos> Maybe I will.
So what's the next move?<eos> If I can get him to stop crying for long enough, I might be able to start talking him round, but until then...<eos> Tell him I'm really sorry, Yvonne.<eos> I went too far.<eos> I will.
I do.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Oh, and, uh, just so you know,<eos> I am going to get this thing out of my head one day.<eos> I will.

And twice daily reporting to Deptford Police Station.<eos> They bailed the bastard.<eos> Lennie, I am so sorry.<eos> We'll get him at the trial.<eos> Will you?
He needs us now.<eos> The Commander is right.<eos> I know this strategy is very bold, but these circumstances call for drastic measures.<eos> Then, the strategy will work, sir?<eos> Well, will it?
The Commander is right.<eos> I know this strategy is very bold, but these circumstances call for drastic measures.<eos> Then, the strategy will work, sir?<eos> Well, will it?<eos> Yes, it will.

A woman.<eos> He needs me.<eos> He won't want to make me mad.<eos> I can't lose you.<eos> You never will.
How did you think this was gonna end, chloe?<eos> I'll find him, okay?<eos> I'll fix this.<eos> No.<eos> You won't.
And i knew that you wouldn't go if you knew.<eos> You suck for not telling me.<eos> And i'm not going anywhere, so... what are we gonna do, p.<eos> I don't know.<eos> We just will.

Times are tough.<eos> Sure.<eos> I mean, we can't let that happen, you know?<eos> Don't worry, son.<eos> We won't.
- I was wrong.<eos> - No, you weren't wrong, Chloe.<eos> Look, I know what you've been through, but there's still a side of Davis that's human.<eos> So, then what if the plan fails?<eos> It won't.
You know, someday, weeks will go by.<eos> Maybe even years.<eos> It won't even cross our minds.<eos> Yeah, all we gotta do is survive.<eos> We will.
- Just dial it, please.<eos> It's a voice mail.<eos> You better be telling the truth.<eos> And you better come through for us in the end.<eos> He will.

Whatever you need.<eos> You've to promise me that you will never, ever, take Lizzie away from me again.<eos> Welcome back into the fold, Johnny.<eos> I'm not sure I see it like that.<eos> The Academy will.
But he's just a captain.<eos> Clearly, he's more than that.<eos> Take care of yourself.<eos> - You were supposed to give it back.<eos> - All right, I will.
Where the fuck is he? !<eos> What if he doesn't come?<eos> He will come.<eos> What if not?<eos> He will!

Don't bother, everything will be fine.<eos> We won't tell the father.<eos> I can tell him it's me who dumped fish.<eos> - You really won't tell him?<eos> - No, I won't, I won't.
- I love you, too.<eos> - Can I skip the school tomorrow?<eos> - Well, you can.<eos> Mum won't turn you in.<eos> She won't.
- You were very helpful.<eos> - Oh, I try.<eos> You know, actually, if you, um... if you think of anything else,<eos> - you give me a call.<eos> - Oh, okay, I will.
They asked us to go with them to the summer house this weekend.<eos> - Okay. What did you say?<eos> - No of course.<eos> Then we'll have the house to ourselves. If you want to come over mean.<eos> Of course I will.
Just say everything's fine.<eos> Nothing suspicious.<eos> We can keep him online that way.<eos> But I thought you were supposed to contact Bailey the second this guy contacted you.<eos> I will.
Sorry.<eos> No, I don't.<eos> Tell him...<eos> Tell him I said hi.<eos> I will.
Is that what you call, "false imprisonment"?<eos> I'm not gonna get railroaded for doing your department's job. Ramon, if you don't take this offer<eos> You're looking at jail time here, okay?<eos> The prick isn't even pressing charges, miguel.<eos> My detectives will!
Double-fisting tonight, huh?<eos> Just single-fisting. I mean, I'm single.<eos> Just an FYI.<eos> I hope to see you around.<eos> You will.
Right, Toof?<eos> No, thank you.<eos> I could totally be black.<eos> You should try being a white woman.<eos> Okay, I will.
Look, I know you blame me for your dad leaving, but maybe it's not my fault.<eos> Or maybe it is.<eos> I'm gonna sit on the steps and wait for him.<eos> Your dad hasn't called me back yet.<eos> He will.
He's not going to marry you.<eos> You know that, right?<eos> Ricky will never marry you.<eos> Yes, Adrian, I know that.<eos> But I will.
It's barney.<eos> So?<eos> For all the years heather's been visiting new york,<eos> Ted's never let barney meet her.<eos> And I never will.
Well,she might have figured it out when I called her and told her.<eos> Abby,what,what are you doing?<eos> You called her?<eos> Gibbs,Gibbs is gonna kill you!<eos> No,he won't.
I could tell you knew something was up with me, and you're right.<eos> But I can't tell you what it is.<eos> I should tell you, but I can't!<eos> I have to.<eos> I never will!
No, but I just moved in with someone. Well, over time, you'll learn That there's a balance of power in relationships,<eos> Then the balance of power shifts to you, And then you can demand they prove their love By, say, undergoing surgery.<eos> Do you understand?<eos> Not really.<eos> You will.
Okay.<eos> uh,so why are you telling me this?<eos> well, because, Nick, I trust that you'll take the information I've just given you, and you will put it to good use.<eos> And--and--and don't forget to vote.<eos> I won't.
fully.<eos> Victories have costs.<eos> Maybe I should take a little less patrick darling down to Washington and, uh. a little more Tripp.<eos> Well, that'll make your father happy.<eos> Oh, no, it won't.
No!<eos> Stay away from me!<eos> I'll hurt you!<eos> No.<eos> You won't.
Smart move, wasn't it?<eos> Your Honour, I don't think the file was leaked.<eos> You can sit down, Pierre.<eos> I'd like to discuss this matter further.<eos> - We most certainly will.
Oh, go ahead and use the bathroom.<eos> I'm sorry. oh, no.<eos> I didn't mean to-- no, no, no.<eos> I'm gonna go. it's fine.<eos> I'll just...
He'll soon be on his way back.<eos> He's sick.<eos> He'll crash. He'll lose consciousness.<eos> I'll declare an emergency, bring him back in.<eos> Not anymore you won't.
Look at yourself!<eos> The guys are going to fall all over themselves when they see you tonight.<eos> Trust me.<eos> Thank you.<eos> at least my daddy will.
She was like a sister to me.<eos> She was... Oh!<eos> This is ridiculous.<eos> Your gran will be spinning in her grave.<eos> No, she won't.
Tacoma could help with the Glocks, but there's no M-4s anywhere.<eos> Washington state, Oregon, Nevada, nobody's got stock, man.<eos> We'll have all the Mayan intel by the morning.<eos> We'll get our guns back.<eos> Oh, yeah, we will.
She hung up on me.<eos> I'm sorry about what happened.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> She'll come back.<eos> She won't.
I'll do what I want.<eos> This isn't funny.<eos> Unlock it, or I'll scream.<eos> You said we'd spend the night together.<eos> And we will.
Uh, we're champagnos.<eos> Who wants a mimosa?<eos> Uh... this trail is for experienced skiers.<eos> Which is what you'll be if you make it to the bottom.<eos> Which you won't.
-You didn't knowabout the alzheimer'S.<eos> -Sam,I promised her.<eos> When she dies,she dies in my arms--not with strangers,in my arms.<eos> She's the love of my life.<eos> I will not putthe love of my life... in a home.
Prove it.<eos> - Affery, old woman, take yourself away!<eos> - No, I shan't, Jeremiah.<eos> I shall stay and learn all I don't know, even if I have to die for it!<eos> - I will!
- Affery, old woman, take yourself away!<eos> - No, I shan't, Jeremiah.<eos> I shall stay and learn all I don't know, even if I have to die for it!<eos> - I will!<eos> I will!
A billion hours apparently.<eos> Gonna play poker tonight, you game?<eos> I'm in.<eos> Moss?<eos> (GRUFF): I won't Dan, no.
How much are you looking forward to Bonneville?<eos> More than I've looked forward to anything pretty much forever.<eos> - (Horn sounds) - I've wanted to go there since I was a boy. (Horn sounds)<eos> - I'm going to buy a Corvette in England.<eos> - (James) You won't.
I am.<eos> It'll be fine, you know. Everything.<eos> Gina ...<eos> - If you send me here?<eos> - I will.
At court, perhaps?<eos> Of course.<eos> In the court.<eos> I never could forget such a face.<eos> And I never will.
If you know of any other kind, then you must run after it.<eos> GO!<eos> Where is Christian?<eos> She must not escape a third time.<eos> She'll not, sir.
I was just 15 miles from the finish line.<eos> 15 miles at 45 knots is 20 minutes.<eos> Mini golf.<eos> If this car overheats...<eos> Well, it will.
You will catch that thief.<eos> Looking at the fire in you, if you catch him, he will see his worst nightmare.<eos> You are his perfect partner.<eos> You will catch him for sure.<eos> He won't.
You are his perfect partner.<eos> You will catch him for sure.<eos> He won't.<eos> He will catch him.<eos> He won't.
What happened?<eos> - They found the missing newspaper photo.<eos> There are schnitzels in the freezer and mashed potatoes in the fridge.<eos> Mommy, but you promised to make like a monkey.<eos> Daddy will, okay?
Mmm!<eos> I don't want that.<eos> Go back, rewrite. Rewrite.<eos> Gentlemen don't get paid.<eos> Will you just...
Hello, my dear.<eos> It's lovely to see you.<eos> - Where's my daughter?<eos> - I see you haven't found her.<eos> And you never will.
Here's all we got to do.<eos> We just gotta get through these, Four Christmases... as quickly and as painlessly as possible.<eos> Exactly.<eos> Promise me that no matter what happens today... we'll still have each other, right.<eos> - Honey, of course we will.
I think you got a lot of my weapons.<eos> He says they have everything you need to build the Jericho missile.<eos> He wants you to make the list of materials.<eos> He says for you to start working immediately, and when you're done, he will set you free.<eos> -No, he won't.

You're crazy!<eos> Stay away from me!<eos> Take my paw.<eos> I'll save you.<eos> No, you won't!
And now that we've been reinstated in the company, I have access to the same accounts Bakuto's been draining.<eos> - And I can close them.<eos> - And when that happens...<eos> - you think Bakuto will come here?<eos> - Well, hell, I would.
And happy...?<eos> I'm happy because the first time in a long time, I'm hopeful. For us.<eos> Would you dance with me?<eos> I just want to hold you, look into your eyes, be in love with you, and feel you being in love with me.<eos> Would you?
But I couldn't get my feet to move.<eos> It was dark in there.<eos> And the music was loud, but I saw his face.<eos> And I recognized his voice as clear as day.<eos> And so would all of you.
Being here means I'll never have to again.<eos> And neither will you if you just say "yes."<eos> Please say "yes."<eos> He would want you to.<eos> He wouldn't.
The less you tell them.<eos> They'll call me a traitor, want to know if I ever talked of going over to the other side, selling secrets to the highest bidder.<eos> For Christ's sakes, that's absurd, Saul.<eos> Harry and Leo would never believe that.<eos> No one would.
I like beer.<eos> - Beer for the Berliner.<eos> - Right away.<eos> - Would she really attack him in public?<eos> - I would.
- No.<eos> Where is he, then?<eos> I want to ask him to his face.<eos> You know he would never hurt any of us.<eos> Of course he would.
So not funny, Dad.<eos> Anyway, as fun as this was, I probably should be getting home.<eos> You're sure you can't stay?<eos> I...<eos> I would.
I understand it's hard to watch a war hero...<eos> You don't understand shit about Fred Johnson.<eos> -Enlighten me.<eos> -Oh, then you want<eos> -the real story? -Yes, I would.
Help me untie 'em, now.<eos> Not seeing anything bell-shaped.<eos> Looks like you haven't even bothered to open half these boxes.<eos> I didn't have the heart to, but you wouldn't understand that, would you?<eos> No, I wouldn't.
In the woods.<eos> Up against a tree.<eos> Don't you look at me like that.<eos> Cos you'd have done the same, if it was offered to you.<eos> No, I wouldn't.
So, what did Moose want?<eos> Oh, my God, I don't even think he knows.<eos> I mean, I am devastatingly handsome in that classic, pre-accident Montgomery Clift kind of way, and sexuality is fluid, but can someone named Moose actually be that fluid?<eos> Okay, well, I ship it.<eos> Well, of course you would.
Archie!<eos> Any new material you wanna try out on a very forgiving audience?<eos> I...<eos> Please?<eos> Would you?
He sees in me all the things that roil him: Success and sexuality and... and a healthy disregard for his tenuous authority.<eos> Are you thinking this could be your next film?<eos> It's so trope-y.<eos> Who'd believe it?<eos> I would.
And then I got hit here.<eos> I don't remember anything at all after that.<eos> So, yes.<eos> If it were up to me, if canceling this inauguration meant that I could spare the mother of my children experiencing any of that, or worse...<eos> I would.
Okay, okay, but if you need me, I'm willing to spend the rest of my life down here in this tunnel, if that's what it takes.<eos> - Uh, what about your wife?<eos> - Oh, yeah.<eos> Yeah, she probably wouldn't like living down here that much.<eos> But the kids sure would.
What is it?<eos> 'Tis a hollow in the rocks by the sea, but the water's pure an' sweet, on account of it was consecrated a thousand year gone by Saint Sawle himself.<eos> Would 'ee care to see it?<eos> - No, I don't think...<eos> - Of course she would!
Should you like to sit down, Vicar?<eos> Oh, er... I think you would.<eos> Should you like me to sit on your lap?<eos> I'm not sure I...<eos> But of course you would.
- Of course I've resumed the marital relations!<eos> - Then you must cease forthwith.<eos> Should you like me to sit on your lap?<eos> I'm not sure I...<eos> Of course you would.
What're you saying?<eos> Maybe it's your turn to suit up.<eos> The people could use another Patriot to look up to.<eos> Not gonna lie, I'd look pretty damn fine in that suit.<eos> Yeah, you would.
Something, or someone?<eos> I know what you're thinking, but you couldn't be further from the truth.<eos> Well, then, why all this secrecy?<eos> Believe me, if I could tell you, I would.<eos> Oh, yes, of course you would(! )
The point is our education program ain't never been no education program, even before it was put on hold for some alleged murder.<eos> Manual labor without instruction ain't an education, and it damn sure ain't no life skills.<eos> You think she'd be sayin' "ain't" so much if we had an education program?<eos> I'd like to believe you.<eos> Really, I would.
Uh...<eos> Sorry.<eos> That's... 'cause I just thought Mel was short for Melanie, and then the other part was...<eos> - Would you like to start over?<eos> - Yes, I would.
"Handcrafted by a renowned British atelier... sympathetically marries the chassis with..."<eos> - Did you write this?<eos> - Course I wrote it.<eos> "The interior would benefit from some minor attention."<eos> - Well, it would.
I'm sorry.<eos> That's rubbish!<eos> In the dry, it would have done a 1:15.<eos> - No, it wouldn't. - Yes, it would.<eos> - No, it wouldn't.
And that may be sooner than you think.<eos> This blade is our ticket out of here.<eos> I can't wait to see nos's face.<eos> You'd take my sword?<eos> Yeah, yeah I would.
By the way, Sophie, thank you for watching our horse while we were gone.<eos> He's my favorite roommate.<eos> Aww, well, you know what, that's what friends are for.<eos> And I'm sure you would do the same for me if I needed a favor.<eos> - Of course we would.
He told me he was working late.<eos> Well, it's a serious case, the poisoning.<eos> It's not the first time, recently.<eos> Sidney, you'd tell me if you knew something, wouldn't you?<eos> Of course I would.
Something about jam-making.<eos> Yes, well, change of plan.<eos> Actually, I'm seeing a gentleman from the British Broadcasting Corporation.<eos> Would that have anything to do with the quiz coming to Kembleford?<eos> Yes, it would.
I told you, they're complicated.<eos> This one's gonna take three or four years at least.<eos> Meantime,<eos> I don't want my kids drinking anything out of a tap.<eos> No, you wouldn't.
This one's gonna take three or four years at least.<eos> Meantime,<eos> I don't want my kids drinking anything out of a tap.<eos> No, you wouldn't.<eos> Who would?
- Hun, you're gonna have to bowl.<eos> - No, look, I had an incident when I was a kid.<eos> - My fingers got stuck in the...<eos> - oh, get over it.<eos> Your girl would.
And this is just a formality, so just try to keep it friendly.<eos> Okay?<eos> Martin, would you like to come over to dinner tonight?<eos> No.<eos> He would not.
I heard another one the other day.<eos> A taxi driver clearing out his cab after a hard day at work-- umbrella, mobile phone, usual stuff--<eos> £800,000 gold bar.<eos> Someone had left it in there - and not even noticed.<eos> - You would.
Duke!<eos> This is looking like a pretty clear cry for help.<eos> Well, as usual, you're not wrong.<eos> Would you like to help me out?<eos> Yes. Yes, I would.
I chose tulips specifically to torture Larry Henderson.<eos> After all, he killed my baby sister.<eos> Plus, tulips are my wife's favorite flower.<eos> Before we unveil the headstone, would a loved one of Margaret's like to say a few words?<eos> - I would.

It's not right.<eos> Look, I will go in there, I will talk to him, and I will convince him to leave Rittenhouse and not become the monster he's supposed to become.<eos> And you think he's gonna just, what, give up all that fame, the power, the legacy?<eos> Yes.<eos> I would.
All I have to do is help the FSB with a little information from time to time and they stay safe.<eos> That's all.<eos> Did you tell them about me?<eos> Of course not.<eos> I would never.
That doesn't make sense.<eos> Well, we both know it wasn't you.<eos> You'd never do anything like that.<eos> You're right.<eos> I wouldn't.
Buddy, thank you very much for taking us out today.<eos> I know you guys are swamped and you didn't have to.<eos> No, I had to.<eos> Listen, you mind losing that tie?<eos> I would.
I guess betrayal runs in my family.<eos> I...<eos> I wouldn't have betrayed you.<eos> I wonder...<eos> Yes, you would.
Actually, Michelle, I can't work for you anymore.<eos> I got a new job.<eos> I just came to tell you as a courtesy.<eos> I would think a courtesy would be you sticking with me through my tough times, Claire.<eos> I would.
And Americans love a cause.<eos> So if I start a democratic revolution here, you would support me?<eos> - Oh, is this your plan?<eos> - No, I'm just asking.<eos> Would you?
Still upside down here.<eos> Just need a little push.<eos> Can we be real?<eos> If my name was Sebastian and I had a cool Jamaican accent... you'd totally help me.<eos> You would.
In the meantime, Captain Stern here will see to it that you get a wet hootch.<eos> A what?<eos> It's a tent with a shower.<eos> Unless you'd prefer a dry hootch.<eos> I would not, sir.
I've got a call make first.<eos> Andrew... it's a social call.<eos> How are they doing?<eos> Oh, aye, they're loving it.<eos> America... who wouldn't?
And then, there would a gigantous look-see giant hunt for all of the boys.<eos> I won't tell.<eos> No one would listen to me anyway.<eos> I'm an untrustworthy child.<eos> Yes, you would.
I won't tell.<eos> No one would listen to me anyway.<eos> I'm an untrustworthy child.<eos> Yes, you would.<eos> No, I wouldn't.
I'm an untrustworthy child.<eos> Yes, you would.<eos> No, I wouldn't.<eos> Yes, you would.<eos> No, I wouldn't.
No, I wouldn't.<eos> Yes, you would.<eos> No, I wouldn't.<eos> - Yes, you would.<eos> - No, I wouldn't!
-What's the first rule of battle?<eos> Never reveal your position.<eos> And if one unauthorized person knew?<eos> If Congress knew?<eos> So would the enemy.
I can't get my fingers between the cervix and the head.<eos> It's so swollen.<eos> It's all right, Ruby...<eos> I'd be screaming my head off if you weren't here.<eos> No, you wouldn't.
It took nearly five seconds to freeze this rose in liquid nitrogen.<eos> So?<eos> Well, so, it would take a human body significantly longer, depending on mass - and body fat, of course.<eos> - So why would a cop stand around for hours, waiting to get frozen?<eos> She wouldn't.
But said chatter may have been fudged.<eos> - So you lied to me?<eos> Out of pity. You pity me.<eos> - I wouldn't put it that way.<eos> - I would.
- if they want an ice cream as well, huh?<eos> - Would you like an ice cream?<eos> - No.<eos> - Really?<eos> Would you?
...if you go out to the barn at night.<eos> - How? What do you do?<eos> You stand and you listen... and if you hear knocking, that's bad, but if you hear grain pouring, it's good.<eos> But I don't suppose any of you would go out there.<eos> I would.
The gun charge, that's eight years he's going away, maybe 10.<eos> Aggravated assault, the gun, plus, he got your wallet.<eos> That's right.<eos> I would like for you to tell the police that the gun was yours.<eos> Would you?
How they...<eos> You are English.<eos> Do you know what she's talking about?<eos> I'm afraid I don't.<eos> Well, of course you wouldn't.
No... no horns.<eos> No.<eos> I find Jews exotic and mysterious.<eos> It wouldn't mind, if you had horns.<eos> You wouldn't? Nah.
Why can't you?<eos> You know why.<eos> The fucking bail conditions!<eos> - Why would they let me in?<eos> - They wouldn't.
- Are you suggesting that I'm lying to you?<eos> - Why did you drop it?<eos> - Because it wasn't memorable enough.<eos> - You remembered it.<eos> Well, I would, wouldn't I?
We just want to talk to him.<eos> That's all.<eos> I... Is he in some sort of trouble?<eos> Now, why would you think that?<eos> I wouldn't.
- Ocho!<eos> Mas tequila, pendejo!<eos> Then we're gonna go have us a long talk with Miss Daisy and the Jew.<eos> So, would you say it's serious?<eos> Ugh! I would, Alan.
Uhh, you know...<eos> Okay, I would eat that baby.<eos> - Is that terrible of me?<eos> - No.<eos> - I just would.
Kind of just all over the place.<eos> And I know this is a weird thing to say because you and Mom were married and everything.<eos> But Reggie's a good guy.<eos> And I wouldn't want him to, you know, leave us for good.<eos> Of course you wouldn't.
They have a-a judge and two assessors.<eos> God, I would have bullied you as a kid.<eos> Jury duty is supposed to be a sacrifice.<eos> Would I like to be at work right now, participating in the Spirit Week assembly?<eos> Yeah, I would.
Yeah, well, it's the best we've got.<eos> What?<eos> You can tell someone, but they're not gonna believe you.<eos> You know that.<eos> Your mom would.
I'm waiting on Dr. Hale.<eos> Dr. Hale?<eos> Is he not on the floor?<eos> I don't know where to find him.<eos> No, you wouldn't.
Dr. Hale?<eos> Is he not on the floor?<eos> I don't know where to find him.<eos> No, you wouldn't.<eos> But alas, I would.
Um, there are monsters all around us every day, and we need to protect ourselves.<eos> Monsters?<eos> Would you consider your neighbor Hank Asher a monster?<eos> Yeah, absolutely.<eos> Yes, yes, I would.
Bridey: The older brother's not totally sure Adam is Adam.<eos> How the hell did you get that?<eos> Julia: Would you consider your neighbor Hank Asher a monster?<eos> Yeah, absolutely.<eos> Yes, yes, I would.
Sometimes...<eos> Mmm, that's so brave.<eos> A Seelie can't exactly walk in the front door.<eos> So how would you get in to the Hotel DuMort?<eos> How would you?
Internal Affairs said would happen to you if you testify against a brother officer, -contradict his sworn statement...<eos> -Get off of me.<eos> ...and challenge the public pronouncements of our beloved commissioner, but let me give you a preview.<eos> You would not believe the day that I have had.<eos> I probably would.
That allowed you to talk me down? Yes.<eos> But this time, when I turn, I...<eos> I'm afraid I'll be gone... forever.<eos> If you could fix it, if you could change the past,<eos> - would you?
You weren't asking about becoming Inhuman.<eos> I was talking about us.<eos> Every terrible thing that has happened to you could have been avoided if you'd never met me.<eos> I wouldn't change a thing.<eos> - I would.
We have guns, but so do they, so when we get up there, we cannot hesitate to kill, do you understand?<eos> Taiana?<eos> Just months ago, I was a dive instructor.<eos> Couldn't dream of taking a life.<eos> I wouldn't.
He beats himself up for what he turned you into, and you want to hate him for it.<eos> I don't hate him.<eos> Forgive him.<eos> Like he did me.<eos> Like he would for you.
You made a deal.<eos> No way, man.<eos> I wouldn't do that.<eos> To save your own skin?<eos> Sure you would.
If it meant we could be together again?<eos> All the kids, you and me?<eos> What's going on, Will?<eos> I just really want to know if you'd leave all of this behind if it meant we could get back to the way things were.<eos> Of course I would.
You tell me how first.<eos> Have a seat, Martha.<eos> I've had second thoughts about your resignation.<eos> Would you like to remain as attorney general?<eos> Yes, I would.
You're the one that told me to think outside the box.<eos> But there's a big difference between thinking outside the box and totally demolishing it.<eos> If you were having problems with the principal, why didn't you talk to me first?<eos> Because who'd believe the word of some kid over the head of the whole school?<eos> Honey, I would.
Yeah, I kind of like it here.<eos> Kevin Whitfield's condolence book.<eos> Hey, you don't have mine, do you?<eos> I'd like to see who came to my funeral.<eos> No, you wouldn't.
Let's get her!<eos> Come on!<eos> Let's go!<eos> Uh, you coming?<eos> Oh, I would.
With or without his help.<eos> Let's go to work.<eos> Hey, where are you going?<eos> We could use your help.<eos> Yeah, I would.
That's 25% of the country, at least.<eos> That's exactly why I expect you'll work with me towards this election... self-interest.<eos> Naturally.<eos> Ahmed wants to follow in his father's footsteps.<eos> Who wouldn't?
Throws me off balance.<eos> Pits me against my rival.<eos> And because I don't have children, and he does.<eos> They know I won't compromise.<eos> No president would.
- You better tell me.<eos> Or we can get an interrogation room down at the FBI.<eos> What, like, from the very beginning?<eos> I would love to.<eos> I would.
The bullet that we removed is evidence.<eos> With it and your testimony, you could put that guy away for a long time.<eos> Everyone will know what I did.<eos> It's true.<eos> They would.
Defense rests.<eos> -DIFUNDE LA CULTURA- Having trouble with your closing?<eos> No, it's just part of the process.<eos> Would it make you feel better if I told you that I have never felt more proud of my future husband than I did watching you up there today?<eos> Yes, it would.
So when I thought that<eos> Rita was going to lose her license and her career and everything, I sent her the recording of what Carmen had said, and I figured that that meant<eos> Carmen was going to blow up my adoption by telling my social workers everything Brandon and I had done, and I figured if for whatever reason she didn't,<eos> - that for sure...<eos> - Rita would.
Anyway, if I am to succeed, then he and I are going to need all the help we can get.<eos> Well, I'm sure you're surrounded by good people offering it.<eos> Not if they're always off in Paris or New York, or wherever it is you spend your time.<eos> Y-You would take my advice?<eos> I would.
How much money are we talking about?<eos> If we each kick in $500, we clear five grand apiece.<eos> Wow.<eos> That kind of money would really solve a lot of problems.<eos> Sure would.
What an insolent tongue!<eos> Then you people must be allies with the thieves-amasu!<eos> Or are you suggesting we have no right to watch it ourselves?<eos> N-No!<eos> W-We would never!
Listen, lady, I'm nervous enough already, and you're a fucking yapper.<eos> I don't do good with yappers, so--<eos> You don't want to try to fuck over your old firm?<eos> Really?<eos> I would.
I was, like, buttoned-up and boring, which is, like, totes cray, right?<eos> Don't say that.<eos> Plus, it didn't help that I had foot surgery freshman year, so I had to walk with a cane.<eos> Well, I wouldn't go to Deborah Denise's stupid slumber party if she paid me to.<eos> - I would.
They were the only sex life she had.<eos> Only?<eos> You mean Andy couldn't?<eos> Worse.<eos> Wouldn't.
Little test here, Liv.<eos> Jennifer Lawrence.<eos> In my league?<eos> She'd be lucky to have you.<eos> Of course she would.
She just lost her mother.<eos> She was letting poor Pam take the blame for her thievery.<eos> You won't do it.<eos> You won't ask a poor orphaned girl for her alibi?<eos> Clive would.
- You have challenges. - Excuse me.<eos> Lieutenant, I think you took some photos out of the murder book before you gave it to me.<eos> And I'd like them back.<eos> No.<eos> You wouldn't.
Lieutenant, I think you took some photos out of the murder book before you gave it to me.<eos> And I'd like them back.<eos> No.<eos> You wouldn't.<eos> I would, though.
- Is he in the hospital?<eos> - Like an anxiety attack.<eos> He's fine, though.<eos> He wouldn't go to the hospital.<eos> Of course he wouldn't.
Last night, a nurse at St Luke's was murdered and she needs to see him urgently.<eos> Whatever for?<eos> He's not a policeman.<eos> Trust me, he'll want to know.<eos> No doubt he would.
But y-you're a woman.<eos> Indeed.<eos> Yes, well, lots of us support the men's rights movement.<eos> Perhaps you would like to see our brochures?<eos> No, I would not.
You want to talk about Cecilia?<eos> If you are going to tell me that my marriage is illegal because I did not have the sovereign's consent, then I believe you are nine years too late.<eos> I was thinking...<eos> I should like to meet your wife.<eos> - You would?
I don't know.<eos> They haven't said anything about it.<eos> - What do we do?<eos> Just leave it?<eos> - I would.
Sexual deviant.<eos> I'm a scientist who's spent decades of my life researching sex.<eos> Even I don't know what that means.<eos> How can something deviate when there is no norm?<eos> No two humans would...
Oh, lost a few pounds.<eos> I mean, you look different than you did when you were standing over here.<eos> There's something weird about the light.<eos> Aside from the fact it casts a cooler hue, you'd never know there's a tiny little spy camera in there.<eos> Yes, I would.
The way my father raised me.<eos> How is she?<eos> How's Molly?<eos> I'd kill Ihab bin Rashid myself if they would give me the chance.<eos> Of course you would.
It's wonderful to see you.<eos> I say.<eos> That looks pretty scrappy, guvnor.<eos> Wouldn't you rather have something stronger?<eos> I would, Louis, boy.
Ah, we watch a lot of movies in here.<eos> All right, you want to know my story?<eos> It starts long before I did what I did, because I wasn't born a poor black child, but I was born poor, which made me susceptible to wanting to be rich.<eos> Of course I'm thinking about myself.<eos> What, you wouldn't?
When we take her to court to have it lifted, she won't be able to prove any of these allegations, and her character will be called into question, which is exactly where we want to be.<eos> - Because? - Because once that baby is born, you will have a very good shot at obtaining full custody.<eos> Full custody?<eos> No.<eos> He would never.
Right, Dr. Shepherd?<eos> We...<eos> We're doing everything we can.<eos> You wouldn't screw with me, would you?<eos> Oh, Gayle, I wouldn't.
Drug overdose?<eos> No, she died from a massive cerebral hemorrhage.<eos> A blood vessel in her brain burst.<eos> Would you like to see her?<eos> I would.
It's impossible.<eos> Nobody can figure out these equations.<eos> I bet the Chief Medical Examiner of the Commonwealth could.<eos> Okay, Maura does not want to tutor me.<eos> Sure, she would!
So you think I should tell Kent to join the Cub Scouts?<eos> [Chuckles] Kent gave you a generous offer.<eos> Go. Enjoy it.<eos> You wouldn't be saying that if you had to go.<eos> I would, too.
And you honestly don't remember anything about being dead?<eos> Really don't.<eos> Who does that?<eos> Who gets a second chance like that and just goes to work the next morning?<eos> I would.
I don't care who ran Indian Hill.<eos> Then why are you here?<eos> Fish Mooney.<eos> And why would I know how to find Fish Mooney?<eos> No reason you would.
Yeah, well, what's the alternative, to be like you, a man alone without empathy?<eos> She's the reason you are on this table.<eos> If you never met her, you'd most likely have a very long life ahead of you.<eos> Surely, you would take a do-over if offered.<eos> No, I wouldn't.
No, seriously, what if I just pulled a Chloe on the whole plan, just stayed here in bohemia?<eos> Run away before I ever went to where I'm running from.<eos> What if, Daniel?<eos> I would love for you to stay, Chloe.<eos> I really would.
I really, really want to go.<eos> Mom said to ask you, since there were girls coming.<eos> But... But Bobby's parents are chaperoning them, and I would never do anything to shame our family.<eos> No, I know that.<eos> Of course you wouldn't.
Like when I strangled psycho chick for the win.<eos> That was genuine.<eos> Gee, thanks.<eos> You know, I wouldn't just kick ass for anyone.<eos> Okay, fine, I would.
Cookie and I have what you call history. We share three sons.<eos> She's the co-chair of my company.<eos> So I watch her back.<eos> But, lady... don't ever try to read me.<eos> I would never.
Machine doesn't give you a damn receipt.<eos> Go tell it to someone who gives a shit.<eos> - What if you could stay?<eos> - Well, they won't let me.<eos> I would.
Is that...<eos> If that's the case, should we not?<eos> No, I'd still like to.<eos> Would you still like me to?<eos> Yeah, I would.
It really matters.<eos> Okay.<eos> Positive.<eos> She positively seems to have no appetite.<eos> Well, would you?
And if Ziva never told me about Tali, maybe she never told Tali about me.<eos> Were you and Ziva an item the whole time?<eos> Timothy Farragut McGee, how indiscreet.<eos> You know I would never kiss and tell.<eos> Sure you would.
Matilda.<eos> Probably Matilda.<eos> What am I gonna have?<eos> We're not going to stop being friends with you if we have a baby.<eos> Absolutely, 100% you would.
My time is much more valuable than yours.<eos> Speaking of, I've only allotted 28 minutes for this conversation, which is very generous of me.<eos> So we should begin.<eos> I'd like to leave.<eos> Oh, no, you wouldn't.
She said she was in love with me.<eos> I said I was sorry;<eos> she told me these shocking lies about Elizabeth.<eos> - Would you care to share those?<eos> - I would not.
I wouldn't mind seeing a documentary about it.<eos> I wonder if you know of someone who might be interested.<eos> My caucus has a $2 million fund to invest in such a documentary.<eos> You wouldn't do that.<eos> Why wouldn't I?
Okay, who else would like to share?<eos> Mom?<eos> Yes, Christy?<eos> I thought maybe you'd like to share what's going on with you.<eos> No, I would not.
Get in the car.<eos> Let me finish putting my shoes on.<eos> Slower.<eos> - Would anyone else like to share?<eos> - I would.
Liam.<eos> Fuck off.<eos> You too.<eos> Mr Hampton, we'd like to have a look at your CCTV footage for Monday night.<eos> Would you?
(Bishop and Miss Frimkes chuckle)<eos> What a tragic ending.<eos> But I don't believe for a second he's capable of murder.<eos> I can't imagine why anyone he went to school with would want to kill him.<eos> Or why anyone would at all, for that matter.
I mean, it's really quite easy to break a cipher if you know what it's going to say.<eos> Feds are picking up your dad in Miami, and a whole bunch of other cities are gonna want to talk to you, but we get you first.<eos> And our D.A. is gonna want to close this quick, before the FBI takes over.<eos> So... help us wrap up Joaquin Pereya, and you're in a strong position to make a deal.<eos> I would, honestly.
You have to try to like this.<eos> Okay.<eos> I'll try.<eos> Would you like to see the upstairs?<eos> Yes, I would.
I was crazy to think I could make us closer by locking us in a car for a week.<eos> No, but you were doing that for us.<eos> You have been trying so hard to make this trip memorable for me and the kids...<eos> - and I didn't appreciate that.<eos> - But why would you?
Knowing full well I got no choice but to bust you up now?<eos> I really wish you wouldn't.<eos> If I did, you'd take that beatdown for those kids, wouldn't you?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, I would.
Your mother was a princess.<eos> You would have loved her anyway.<eos> I would never have seen her, because it wouldn't have been appropriate.<eos> And my father would have told me what I'm telling you and I would have listened.<eos> - No, you wouldn't.
I would never have seen her, because it wouldn't have been appropriate.<eos> And my father would have told me what I'm telling you and I would have listened.<eos> - No, you wouldn't.<eos> - Yes, I would.<eos> - No, you wouldn't.
- No, you wouldn't.<eos> - Yes, I would.<eos> - No, you wouldn't.<eos> - I would.<eos> - You wouldn't.
- All right.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Let's accept that there is a world where I know, with absolute certainty, the exact time of your death.<eos> Now, you want me to tell you or not?<eos> Yeah, of course I would.
Julie?<eos> Yes?<eos> My grandmother made it.<eos> You're welcome.<eos> Here, would you?
Many mistakes before that.<eos> - So, I still has to erase you.<eos> - Why?<eos> You cannot guarantee you would not make a mistake again.<eos> - But I would not.
- Why?<eos> You cannot guarantee you would not make a mistake again.<eos> - But I would not.<eos> - But you might.<eos> - But I would not.
- But I would not.<eos> - But you might.<eos> - But I would not.<eos> - But you might.<eos> But I would not.
- But you might.<eos> But I would not.<eos> We could go round and round.<eos> Let's do it again!<eos> - But I would not.
There'll be no alcohol, but you can have fun without it. Um...<eos> Patty and I aren't going this week.<eos> We're going to see a movie instead.<eos> Well, I'm sure Dolores would enjoy a movie just as well.<eos> I would, very much.
- That's not the reason.<eos> I'm too independent for you.<eos> If I ever were to marry, I'd want somebody to tame me and you'd never be able to do it.<eos> You'd grow to despise me.<eos> I would not.
Yeah.<eos> Mom?<eos> Mrs. Oickle says to say hi.<eos> She said to tell you I need a new pair of shoes.<eos> She would, that one.
"Hey, there's Dave, sticking his head in the back of the photo."<eos> Rather be dead.<eos> Why?<eos> I don't wanna be seen that way.<eos> Why, would you?
We had to make it to D-Day.<eos> If they had known our circuits in France had been compromised, our role in the war would have been over.<eos> But you never told me!<eos> Because you would have stopped me!<eos> Of course I would!
- My work is done.<eos> It wasn't last week.<eos> I'm... I know.<eos> Would you and your friend like to join me?<eos> We really would.
- Yeah, it goes all the way up.<eos> - I bet it's so pretty.<eos> - We should plan an overnight trip.<eos> We should put the kids with Peggy for the night, we should get a room and sleep in, and we can watch "The Bachelor" if you want. - I'll totally watch "The Bachelor" with you.<eos> - Would you?
They stood me on the scaffold but reprieved me.<eos> Told me I was coming here instead.<eos> I said, "Hang me now, "for I do not wish to leave my family."<eos> But they would not hang me.<eos> I would.
We were on a track round this rock, and the glacier was on the right, below us.<eos> Way down.<eos> Beautiful thing, it was.<eos> You'd love the landscape out there, Kate.<eos> - You really would.
Hey!<eos> Hi.<eos> Hello.<eos> Don't say anything stupid.<eos> When would we ever?
She was cheating on you?<eos> What are you trying to discover?<eos> Nothing.<eos> You want to know if I'd break up with her.<eos> Would you?
Please.<eos> He mustn't find out.<eos> Are you sure that's how you want your marriage to begin - with a deception, a secret?<eos> He won't want to marry me if he found out.<eos> What man would?
True pleasure to meet you.<eos> Oh, yeah, I think I recognize you from TV.<eos> Yeah, you do.<eos> Uh, how do you know who I am?<eos> Good question. No reason I would.
This is about survival.<eos> This is about putting a 700-foot wall between you and what's out there.<eos> You built that wall to keep us out.<eos> Since when do the crows give two shits if we live?<eos> In normal times we wouldn't.
We need you.<eos> I need you.<eos> But if I can't trust myself, how can you trust me?<eos> - Anyway, Mrs. Leclair wouldn't want to work beside me.<eos> - Of course she would.
"separating me from my family, my friends, even myself."<eos> Okay, I don't need a dramatic reading,<eos> Emily, I wrote it.<eos> If Ezra saw this, he'd be so hurt.<eos> No, he wouldn't.
There's a lot of muscle in front of that door.<eos> This club is a Triad front.<eos> It will be heavily guarded.<eos> But will you do anything to get her back?<eos> Yes, I would.
Yeah, that I fucked up.<eos> No, that you got a bad guy off the street, you just bent the rules a little too far.<eos> Well, I can appeal if you want me to.<eos> Come on. You're not serious.<eos> You wouldn't.
Well, I just -- I figured a guy your age would wanna keep things casual.<eos> Well, I'm not like most guys my age.<eos> No, you're not.<eos> So, Mrs. Powell, you'd like to adopt a child.<eos> Yes, I would.
- Chuckie.<eos> - What?<eos> Would you like to say anything before sentencing?<eos> Okay.<eos> I would, Your Honor.
Or... to provide an alibi!<eos> The car keys, did we find them?<eos> No, of course not.<eos> ~ It was important, you would've told me.<eos> ~ Of course I would.
- How's it going? - Hey.<eos> I still feel pretty bad about messing up.<eos> You know, that guy getting taken?<eos> Oh, I'm sure, I'm sure.<eos> I would too.
On the field, I saw a man, young like we were.<eos> He carried his brother in a sack over his shoulder.<eos> He told me he had promised their mother to take him home.<eos> Would you do that for me?<eos> I would, but you?
I almost didn't get in, because my license is expired.<eos> They thought I was a Muslim spy or something.<eos> I'm glad you came, you know.<eos> I wasn't sure you would when I called you.<eos> Of course I would.
And don't be scared, baby girl.<eos> I got this.<eos> Mr. Falcone, we have your girl, Liza.<eos> Would you like to see her again?<eos> Yes, I would.
Drugs in the pack?<eos> Little busy to check.<eos> Would make sense.<eos> Nobody'd look at a blind man twice.<eos> No, they wouldn't.
- That's a sexist comment.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> You wouldn't be making that argument if a female president had appointed her husband.<eos> A husband with the same lack of international affairs experience as Claire Underwood?<eos> Yes, I would.
- _ - ♪ These arms of mine ♪<eos> Where are you right now... somewhere warm, safe... next to someone you love?<eos> Now, what if all that was gone and the only thing you could do is survive?<eos> You would, right?
So, join us.<eos> ~ Oh, well, I think I'm...<eos> ~ Oh, no.<eos> She wouldn't want to.<eos> Of course she would.
- _ - ♪ These arms of mine ♪<eos> Where are you right now?<eos> Somewhere warm, safe... next to someone you love?<eos> Now, what if all that was gone and the only thing you could do is survive?<eos> You would, right?
What's happening?<eos> I have issues.<eos> What kind of issues?<eos> If I told you, you wouldn't like me.<eos> Nobody would.
Hey. There you are.<eos> Isn't this a cute baby?<eos> You know who'd love to pinch this little guy's cheeks?<eos> Pearl.<eos> Yes, she would. Yes, she would. Oh...
Oh, it's a zombie thing.<eos> You wouldn't understand.<eos> Zombie brains are nasty.<eos> You wouldn't want those.<eos> No, you wouldn't.
He's still feeling the effects.<eos> Okay.<eos> Miss Saltire, would the prosecution consider accepting some sort of compromise, pleading this down to violation?<eos> It would go on his record.<eos> My client would not, not under any circumstances.
He's straight.<eos> He was only pretending to be gay - so he could seduce you. - Whoa!<eos> I am straight, yeah.<eos> But I would never do something like that.<eos> What kind of person would?
Oh, no need to cherry pick.<eos> The smart thing to do is fire us all.<eos> She can't do that.<eos> Can she?<eos> I would.
We forget about what we don't have and we focus on what we do have.<eos> What do we have?<eos> The future.<eos> I'd like to spend the rest of my life with you.<eos> - You would?
- Please, take the boxes.<eos> I want them out of here.<eos> - Oh, okay, great.<eos> You wouldn't happen to know where he was on July 21st, would you?<eos> - Actually, I would.
Ah. ~ Oh!<eos> You could have got yourself killed!<eos> How could I go to Paris?<eos> You wouldn't survive a week.<eos> No, I very probably wouldn't.
For decades?<eos> Say it was an accident, Mother, please.<eos> Say that you only left those nursery windows open to get the nanny dismissed, to keep your hold on the king.<eos> I would like to say that.<eos> I would.
A family.<eos> I told you, Stevie was my brother.<eos> I wouldn't have hurt him.<eos> No.<eos> No, but Pete would.
I-I know it sounds meandering when I describe it, but I promise you it all felt very organic while it was actually happening.<eos> That's a rather perfect description of most people's lives.<eos> I find your story inspiring, actually.<eos> Wow. I think my mother would say "flighty," but... thanks.<eos> Well, of course she would.
Uh, watch that top hand, Katy!<eos> I mean, I only knew him for a couple of months, but he just seemed like one of those extreme sports dudes.<eos> He was extreme, all right.<eos> Uh, you know, I'd be happy to hand over all our records if that helps.<eos> Yeah, it would.
Okay, Walt, maybe we should have checked with you first, but since you've been gone, we've gotten used to do doing things a different way.<eos> Well, I'm back.<eos> And you had no business going around me.<eos> [Eamonn] In Cumberland, when we hit a dead end, we do whatever we can to identify our victim.<eos> And frankly, any department would.
I just didn't... just didn't want to be.<eos> Well, I'm not gonna argue with that.<eos> I tried to convince myself that maybe I was having twins.<eos> But the doctor would know if I were having twins.<eos> Yes, she would.
Yeah!<eos> And you're gonna do it at her house, right?<eos> Actually, I was thinking about a bar.<eos> I doubt she wants to be ambushed at her house.<eos> No-no-no-no, she absolutely would.
You did very, very well in there.<eos> Oh, I'm so touched, I could cry.<eos> Ugh. I am exhausted.<eos> You'd think a tumor would give you extra energy or something.<eos> Mm, I wouldn't.
- You don't think he's American?<eos> - He has some sort of connection to the States.<eos> That's why he's attacking American families.<eos> Now that we feel he may have committed murder, it's doubtful - that State would grant him a passport.<eos> - What country would?
Lisa's in a bad place.<eos> You know how sensitive she is.<eos> We don't want her to go back to...<eos> Tailee.<eos> No, she wouldn't.
I'm just really nervous.<eos> I did something horrible.<eos> So did most of the people in this room.<eos> Do you think she's gonna ask about the money?<eos> I would.
Uh... I could be totally off base here, but you and I maybe had...<eos> Hmm. Would you like to maybe hang out sometime?<eos> Wait, really?<eos> Yeah, yeah, I mean, you'd really want to?<eos> Yeah. I would.
~ I doubt it. This case has reeked of race prejudice from the start.<eos> Your professional future might not be as you imagined it<eos> ~ when I've finished with you.<eos> ~ I'd guard against turning this into a vendetta.<eos> Aye, you would.
I'm sorry.<eos> Wasn't meant to be, I suppose.<eos> I just hope they're alright.<eos> You did everything you could for them, George.<eos> More than any man would.
He had a family.<eos> He's not a piece of meat.<eos> Ah, yes, of course...<eos> Would anyone like to say a few words?<eos> Yeah, I would.
Bull's-eye.<eos> Oh, no, the double tuck.<eos> Oh, hey.<eos> You wouldn't kick out a hopeless romantic who's only here in the name of love, would you?<eos> Ooh, you would.
Very tidy.<eos> But in order to do that, you have to work at it, hard.<eos> So can we forget about the stupid fridge?<eos> Nick would've got it back.<eos> No, he wouldn't!
'I beg your pardon? '<eos> It's just a cat.<eos> It sounds like you've got other ones, have you?<eos> 'Yes...but nothing will replace Picasso!<eos> Well, another cat would.
Let me prove it to you!<eos> I know where the book is!<eos> God revealed it to me.<eos> If I could... if I could bring you the book, would you believe me?<eos> I would.
We should probably get home.<eos> Well, there's no great rush.<eos> Won't Mrs Drewe want to see Marigold?<eos> Well<eos> - Yes, I would.
40 machines compromised.<eos> Even if just a couple of hundred votes were changed in each, that would be more than enough for Mrs. Florrick - to steal this election.<eos> - That is correct.<eos> So you would advocate for a recount in those precincts?<eos> Of course I would.
What are you doing?<eos> Rumors make me giddy.<eos> I'm going to Paris for a few days to un-giddy myself.<eos> You said I'd make a great King.<eos> And you would.
It's fascinating, really.<eos> - The science is so new.<eos> - Psychiatry, is it a science?<eos> Dr. Winter, would you like to discuss this privately?<eos> - No, I wouldn't.
That was a good shift, Dallas.<eos> Thank you, Sir.<eos> So, how's everything going with Severide?<eos> Well, he's handling it.<eos> Better than I probably would.
Miranda, you are rolling over.<eos> You are quitting in the middle of the race, and that is not okay.<eos> Would you let me quit?<eos> Would you let Tuck quit?<eos> Would you?
All we have to do is crack the seventh seal.<eos> The skies will open.<eos> Our kind will descend to cure this world of a dreadful disease: humanity.<eos> You'll start a war pitting humans against angels.<eos> You wouldn't.
And I can't take her with me where I'm going.<eos> You seem like good people.<eos> You got a nice safe setup here.<eos> It's a real home.<eos> Would you
I don't think I'll be ready to date again for a long time.<eos> Well, I have some news that might cheer you up, Ash.<eos> How would you like to be my best man?<eos> I'd love to, Freddie.<eos> Oh, would you?
- Are you ever not hungry?<eos> Oh, shut up.<eos> No, the mom said that they're gluten free.<eos> Why would they order a dough-laden pizza?<eos> They wouldn't.
Is that a good thing or a bad thing?<eos> A good thing.<eos> Definitely a good thing.<eos> Would you like to take me home tonight?<eos> I would.
I wouldn't count on that.<eos> Yeah, it's okay.<eos> Where is it?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Then who would?
Then why are you siding with him?<eos> I'll tell you why.<eos> He promised to do something Jessica never would.<eos> Put my name on the wall.<eos> What if she would?
God damn it, we are not losing to that son of a bitch.<eos> Why the hell did you think I'm here?<eos> We need to go back to Gianopolous and get more money.<eos> Jessica, he's not going to pay that much.<eos> No one in his right mind would.
You got that right.<eos> Look.<eos> You and I both know what happens if I let you go.<eos> You'll find your party and then turn around and come right after me and my family.<eos> No, we wouldn't.
Lorenzo, you are in a world of trouble.<eos> Your best bet is to tell us everything you know now.<eos> I have spent my entire adult life searching for that painting.<eos> When I heard it was coming up for auction, I tried to get my boss to buy it.<eos> But he wouldn't.
No.<eos> It's cotton.<eos> I can't.... It absorbs water, slows me down.<eos> You know?<eos> No, I-I would.
Rebecca's dead.<eos> Levi never heard from her again after the 911 text, so we think someone killed her.<eos> Not someone. Annalise and Frank.<eos> No, Frank would never do that.<eos> Of course he would.
You were just a child.<eos> You didn't know any better.<eos> But the old man was right.<eos> I knew unless I did something, I'd end up like that.<eos> Everybody would.
He's putting out feelers.<eos> If you could go to his house for the holiday...<eos> I mean, would I like to go to the Chan's?<eos> Would I like to be surrounded by the unconditional love of a hundred Filipinos?<eos> Of course I would.
I don't get why they'd hide such important information in this binary box brain.<eos> Well, would you suspect that thing of being a spy full of secrets?<eos> Mmm, no. I guess not.<eos> That's too bad...<eos> Because I would.
The case, yes.<eos> Well, two days before Meyers was shot, his neighbor witnessed a heated argument between Meyers and a woman outside his apartment.<eos> The woman threw a mean left hook at Meyers before threatening to kill him.<eos> Explains Meyers' busted tooth.<eos> Yes, it would.
I have to rise above it.<eos> You're human and he's hot.<eos> But let me ask you this.<eos> If you were with Michael, would you care who your baby daddy was dating?<eos> No, I wouldn't.
There may still be some stock.<eos> We have no money.<eos> Our Christmas was purchased with a loan from Scrooge and Marley.<eos> Father had hoped to protect you, but I'm sure that you'd like to share the burden.<eos> Well, of course I would!
Oh, I won't sing.<eos> I won't sing a song.<eos> But I will sing "Everything I Do" like - at the Broadway musical.<eos> - You wouldn't dare.<eos> ♪ Yes, I would ♪
[ Snaps fingers ] This next exercise will teach us how to communicate our needs in a constructive and non-threatening manner.<eos> We do that all the time.<eos> Very constructively communicated.<eos> Would one of my couples like to help me demonstrate for the rest of the group?<eos> Yes, we would.
I was asleep. I didn't see anyone.<eos> He was looking for something.<eos> Something I need to find.<eos> I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> Who would?
It is.<eos> Let me guess - the shareholders refuse to trust my sister with their money, as I told you they would.<eos> I am ready to take my rightful place.<eos> Arthur, the New Year reception is going ahead and I would very much like you to be there.<eos> Oh, of course you would.
He's got big eyes and a really cute butt.<eos> He's tall...<eos> Hey. I just got off the phone with Dmitri Petrov.<eos> He'd like to know why we're hanging him out to dry.<eos> - And so would I.
I'm entitled to rebut that laughable presumption.<eos> Overruled.<eos> It's not something I keep track of.<eos> Would it surprise you to learn... that you presided over 17 murder trials... 434 assaults... 12,942 civil cases?<eos> It would not.
Family?<eos> Zero.<eos> Six, Igor.<eos> Why do you want to be a Lobby Boy?<eos> Well, who wouldn't, at the Grand Budapest, sir?
- Well how would you describe?<eos> What I would say is that we temporarily-<eos> - We don't have to explain anything to you.<eos> - You wouldn't dare...<eos> - Oh, yes, they would.
I'd have babies with you.<eos> I mean, not right away, but... we should, you know?<eos> What? I never said never.<eos> I said, "Don't marry me if you want to have children."<eos> But you would?
What? I never said never.<eos> I said, "Don't marry me if you want to have children."<eos> But you would?<eos> I could.<eos> Yeah, I would.
I spent 15 years in traffic.<eos> There comes a time when it is unseemly for senior officers to still be rocking the boat, ignoring orders, getting themselves shot, you know the sort of thing.<eos> Are you saying I'm an embarrassment, sir?<eos> I'm saying I'd hate to see you embarrass yourself.<eos> Who would?
I don't see it, myself.<eos> I mean, it's nice to have somebody here to make a cup of tea, she'd be good for that, granted. I wanted her here.<eos> We don't need her.<eos> Well, I say we do, John.<eos> Oh, well, you would.
Hmm. Nice?<eos> Ish.<eos> Clever?<eos> I would say so.<eos> You would.
Just tell him, Eggsy!<eos> Fuck off!<eos> Fuck off, Michelle!<eos> I could kill you right now... and no one in the whole world will notice!<eos> But I would.
This is bigger than you.<eos> It's bigger than me.<eos> It's bigger than Sofi.<eos> Then maybe you should go.<eos> I would, but I...
Number-one sales rep.<eos> Reliably efficient.<eos> He will be missed.<eos> Would anyone else like to speak?<eos> I would.
Is there water?<eos> I'm not going to hurt you.<eos> It gets pretty rough sometimes.<eos> Our friend, the doctor, thinks we might have to restrain you to keep you from hurting yourself.<eos> He would, wouldn't he?
Right here - with Evie.<eos> Aye, you see, she's not so sure about that.<eos> She was stealing money from the fund.<eos> My daughter would never take what wasn't hers.<eos> Yes, she would.
Oh. I... go back to sleep.<eos> It's nothing.<eos> See, I knew there was something special about Jeanne those flying things wanted.<eos> But I begged them to take me.<eos> They wouldn't.
What would you do if you met the man who ordered Papa's death?<eos> Would you just give him a big hug, Nessa?<eos> I certainly wouldn't stick a knife in his neck.<eos> Wouldn't you?<eos> Would you?
You tell me who's driving it, and I will tell you why it's important.<eos> Is it the father of your little girl?<eos> The man you're talking about, he doesn't...<eos> He doesn't know that Ellie's his daughter, and he wouldn't do anything to my kids.<eos> - He wouldn't.
All right, well, let's see what else Madame Dooriya has to say.<eos> Wow.<eos> How many bags did we bring?<eos> Madame D really wouldn't like this.<eos> No, she really, really wouldn't.
Who knew that was an option?<eos> Well, thanks for stopping by.<eos> Is Mr. Spence here?<eos> - I'd like to see him, too.<eos> - Of course you would.
You didn't save me for me. You did it for you.<eos> You didn't want to be alone.<eos> If the situation were reversed and I was dying, you'd do the same thing.<eos> No, Dean.<eos> I wouldn't.
You don't actually believe his lies, do you?<eos> He just confesses to killing his mother in cold blood?<eos> A woman who would have walked through fire for him?<eos> I would like to hear what the other kids have to say.<eos> - So would I.
If that's what you feel you need to do.<eos> Babe, it's the National Gallery.<eos> I mean, this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.<eos> You wouldn't expect me not to take the job just because you changed your mind.<eos> I wouldn't.
Guv, can I sleep in the dorm here for a bit?<eos> Not if you're not on duty.<eos> You could always stay at mine for a bit, if you like.<eos> I'd love that, guv.<eos> I would.
It's a fact that he helped cover up the DUI.<eos> Imagine if one of your reporters came to you with this story.<eos> - Could you print a word of it?<eos> - No, but I'd have them keep digging.<eos> Would you?
Like that's hard.<eos> It just needed a couple parts and some love.<eos> You're insane.<eos> I'd do more for you and worse.<eos> Just like you would for me.
Right.<eos> -What?<eos> -You suit an apron.<eos> Are you trying to do small talk, Helen?<eos> Would I?
My instructions are that doctor and Mrs Chandler love their daughter Rebecca very much and wish her a long and happy life.<eos> Come on, guys.<eos> Give the kid a break.<eos> So Dr D'Antonio, do you equate the act my client is accused of with the act of paedophilia?<eos> Yes, I would, as a matter of fact.
Yeah.<eos> Yeah, those guys are pretty great.<eos> Yeah.<eos> They'd take a bullet for me.<eos> No, they wouldn't.
All right.<eos> Who?<eos> Who would pay to save your life?<eos> I'm the Queen!<eos> Surely somebody would!
I was doing this for your mother.<eos> I don't see how lip-wrestling with the editor of Casserole Today could be for her.<eos> See, I throw the judges a little sugar so your mother wins.<eos> I think she'd prefer you kept your sugar to yourself.<eos> No, I wouldn't.
Oh, yeah. I am saying yes to that.<eos> Just now a child in South America died of starvation.<eos> Would you like another?<eos> You know what?<eos> I would.
Dude, I think you're picking Radio Korea.<eos> You'll be tip-top once the damage from solar flare is dealt with.<eos> I want to move out.<eos> He doesn't want to sleep with MXes.<eos> Well, who would, really?
Wh... attempted murder?<eos> March 16, 2013.<eos> You pointed a weapon at a private security contractor during the kidnapping of Bo Adams.<eos> I have his statement here if you'd like me to read it.<eos> No, I wouldn't.
So, what do you think?<eos> I mean, it's a lot of money.<eos> I do like that part.<eos> I mean, it would mean me giving up my writing.<eos> Sure would.
But surely it is connected to Moloch's greater plan.<eos> It wants something from us.<eos> Washington's Bible.<eos> - So give it the Bible.<eos> - We would...
Valdes is full of shit.<eos> - Who'd you rather bang, valdes or frankie?<eos> - Frankie don't take dick. - I know!<eos> But let's just say she does.<eos> Or she would.
Richard -- he's quite a find.<eos> Do you trust him?<eos> Richard thinks I'm in love with him.<eos> He would go to the end of the world for me.<eos> Who wouldn't?
You know, you're entitled to a leave of absence from school.<eos> No, I'll go.<eos> To school?<eos> No one expects you to.<eos> My parents would.
- Because of what you feel?<eos> I've felt something before for someone on my team.<eos> It seems foolish now.<eos> I would die for you.<eos> Any man would.
Coward?<eos> Please.<eos> I'm the one saying we should get off our ass, round up some men and some weapons, and frag these cockroaches.<eos> Yeah, why don't you quit complaining and go do that?<eos> I would.
So I had to cast a more established dancer.<eos> Bisection.<eos> It's been a while since I've seen one of these.<eos> You'd think there'd be more blood.<eos> You would.
Hmm. I could improvise a device.<eos> I could have James Balfour's clock-making tools repurposed.<eos> You'd open my skull with clockmaker's tools?<eos> If you'd have me do so.<eos> I most certainly would not.
I was trying to protect her.<eos> But she didn't want your protection, did she?<eos> She was always very honest.<eos> You know, she said I'd pay for it.<eos> That we all would.
Maybe I could've saved her. At least just-- Just been here for her when it happened or something.<eos> Hey.<eos> You can't blame yourself.<eos> And I'm sure if she were here right now, your mama would tell you the same thing.<eos> No, she wouldn't.
Heard how they found him yesterday too.<eos> The man's son shot himself in the head.<eos> If he had a few bad days, I think he gets a pass.<eos> Of course he does.<eos> Any man would.
You're smart and you're able to think ahead, so you can imagine what will happen when she wakes up, tied up, with us here.<eos> She'll think we did it.<eos> No, no, we'll explain to her how we rescued her--<eos> And she won't believe it.<eos> No one would.
Yeah, well, it's true.<eos> But the larger size of the Xbox One may keep it from overheating.<eos> Well, you wouldn't want your gaming system to overheat.<eos> No, see?<eos> Well, you absolutely would not.
Relax.<eos> It was a joke.<eos> - Not to me.<eos> - I don't understand...<eos> No, you wouldn't, would you?
- No, we gotta do something first.<eos> - I stood by you, Ray.<eos> Didn't give you up.<eos> You know I would never do that.<eos> Sure you would.
It's nonsense.<eos> I don't know that man.<eos> I had a few drinks, I paid my bill, and I was at home on the phone with my husband by 8:00 P.M.<eos> Okay, so, then if we got a warrant to search your car, we wouldn't find any of Mr. Strauss' hair or fluids... you know, DNA?<eos> No, you wouldn't.
Hey.<eos> Um...<eos> Is there any chance you might want to lie still and let me drag you across the apparatus floor?<eos> I think you're, like, just about dummy weight. No.<eos> I'd rather not.
[ Gasps ] How does she like it?<eos> I mean, based on the t-shirts I've seen, people seem to really love that place.<eos> Why wouldn't you introduce us?<eos> - I didn't know you'd want to meet her.<eos> - Well, of course I would!
I do.<eos> You see, now I always would have agreed with you...<eos> I mean, she cuts her cloth with the world the way we all must... but, I trusted her always, when pushed... to fall the right way.<eos> You would hope that those that love you, would say the same.<eos> I would.
- Her ass is so tiny.<eos> - Russ: Mm-hmm. It is.<eos> Lina:<eos> Does that get you hard? Russ:<eos> It probably would. Lina:
About what?<eos> I don't have to tell you anything.<eos> No, no you don't.<eos> I've never seen this before.<eos> No, why would you?
Grant, hi.<eos> Yeah, I saw you were gonna be here, and since you've been ducking my calls, I just thought that I'd drop in.<eos> - Care to join me for lunch?<eos> - I...<eos> I would...
They are so beautiful.<eos> This one looks almost Aramaic.<eos> Aren't you even curious?<eos> I'd burn 'em off if I could.<eos> No, you wouldn't.
Tessa, any chance you may remember who Cindy was dating when she got pregnant?<eos> Um... pretty sure it was a guy named Eddie Davis.<eos> My mom knows his mom.<eos> I can probably get you his contact info, if that would help.<eos> Yeah, it would, actually.
Bollocks.<eos> - Why didn't you just give it to me?<eos> - Cos you don't trust us.<eos> If we just handed it over, you'd say we'd stolen It.<eos> No, I wouldn't.
Then she can start a new life, just like she wants.<eos> Deunan?<eos> No way.<eos> She'd never go without you.<eos> Maybe she would.
How is keeping me here helping you find danny's killer?<eos> We can't rule you out until you tell us where you were.<eos> Where I was doesn't matter.<eos> Yeah. My kid dies, I'd do whatever I could to help the police.<eos> I just would.
It's -- it's because of me.<eos> I need to become who I'm meant to be.<eos> Oh, god. I'm so sorry.<eos> You just told me you would never leave me.<eos> I wouldn't.
Okay.<eos> Well, uh, they should all come in to be examined.<eos> Oh, you'd love that, wouldn't you?<eos> Uh, no.<eos> No, I-I would not.
I can't go to jail.<eos> I'd never make it there.<eos> I saw every episode of "Oz."<eos> - They eat guys like me alive.<eos> - Yeah, they would.
am brought up the M-word last night.<eos> What did you say?<eos> He didn't officially propose.<eos> Just wondering would I consider it.<eos> And would you?
I can look into how much you can take out of the business if that's...<eos> I've got maybe 200 grand I can lay my hands on immediately, but even then, are they going to let me withdraw that amount in cash, without asking bloody questions?<eos> Well, it's your money.<eos> Yeah, but they're going to think I'm laundering money, then they're going to tell the police!<eos> -Really? -Well, I would!
As I understand it, you're our last best hope for the network to stay on the air.<eos> If I was a man with no choices, I'd kill myself.<eos> Well, I guess that means I have a choice, so...<eos> Would you like to talk about my intentions for the network?<eos> Yes, sir, I would.
But the others... Oh, good Lord God.<eos> Anyway, you'd be more than welcome.<eos> Why would you invite me to your home?<eos> You want me to be honest?<eos> I would, yes.
That's definitely something I'd do.<eos> Sergeants are very busy already.<eos> Yeah, but like you said, there's a 20% budget cut so we're all gonna be working our socks off, anyway.<eos> I think sergeants would rise to the responsibility.<eos> I would.
He said one conversation and you're career would be finished.<eos> And I was so upset I had to come home.<eos> He wasn't talking to his father.<eos> He was talking to you trying to get in my head.<eos> - So you would never...
But you still see Holden as a threat.<eos> To who?<eos> The community.<eos> I wouldn't want to live next to him.<eos> Would you?
You must've been very persuasive.<eos> Well, he hasn't signed off on it yet.<eos> Did you threaten to revoke his bond if he doesn't?<eos> I did.<eos> Would you?
Your phone will be ready in three days.<eos> I planned the funeral.<eos> I think it's going to be nice.<eos> Harrison would like it.<eos> Well, he wouldn't.
If there were survivors, we will bring them in, too.<eos> You have my word.<eos> I want to see my people.<eos> Of course you do.<eos> I would, too.
No way.<eos> You can't handle a fake I.D.<eos> You'll immediately get caught and ruin it for everyone.<eos> Well, if you don't help me get one, I'm telling dad.<eos> - You wouldn't.
Kaneki!<eos> How long are you gonna stay home? !<eos> yeah... There was just one place where I could go... would you eat Yoshikawa in Class 2?<eos> The one you like so much?<eos> I wouldn't!
What would you do for love?<eos> Sir?<eos> Would you hazard everything you held dear?<eos> Family, friends, respect, judgment in the eyes of an all-seeing God, and call it a price worth paying?<eos> I would.
I once went out with a lady who was 35 years older than me.<eos> Did you?<eos> Oh, no, I'm getting confused with my mother.<eos> Would you like to meet her?<eos> Oh, yes, we would.
'Cause they're never as smart as you.<eos> Uh...<eos> I know. I know...<eos> You would never leave Keating.<eos> I wouldn't?
What idea is this?<eos> Edith has taken in a motherless child and is giving her a home here.<eos> I should have thought an orphan an uncomfortable piece of baggage for an unmarried woman.<eos> You mean a man might not want to take the child on?<eos> Well, I wouldn't.
Why?<eos> Cos she's perfect, innit?<eos> The control freak and the man who should never be controlled.<eos> You'd go to hell, if she asked.<eos> And she would.
Cops don't usually bring me home.<eos> To their home... they don't bring me to their home.<eos> I'm confused, this morning you were mad at me.<eos> No, I wouldn't call that mad.<eos> Okay, I really would.
To their home...<eos> They don't bring me to their home.<eos> I'm confused, this morning you were mad at me.<eos> No, I wouldn't call that mad.<eos> Okay, I really would.
- You're burning up.<eos> - Am I?<eos> I'd like to know you better.<eos> Is that strange to say? No.<eos> Well, I would.
You're the first person I've seen from before.<eos> How the hell you end up here?<eos> I'm actually on a mission for the government, if you can believe that.<eos> If it was anybody but you,<eos> I wouldn't.
He's always been different, hasn't he?<eos> Isolated, not many friends.<eos> And it got really bad when he hit puberty.<eos> Look, if it were my son, I would try to protect him, too.<eos> I would.
You want something out of me?<eos> Why don't you just ask for it?<eos> If I wanted something out of you, dearie, Believe me, I'd take it.<eos> But you can't, can you?<eos> Otherwise you would.
His bedtime nuggets, of course.<eos> I completely forgot.<eos> Hey, Kevin, would you like some bedtime nuggets?<eos> - You know what?<eos> - I would.
Otherwise he will end up begging on the streets.<eos> I read in the Daily Mail that some of these beggars make over a quarter of a million pounds a year.<eos> Look, all Gareth needs is a place to sleep.<eos> I mean, if he had somewhere to live, you wouldn't sack him, would you?<eos> No, I wouldn't, Miss Chakrabarti.
And it would look sexy.<eos> Would you like a green grape shoved in your... given to your mouth?<eos> Handed to your mouth?<eos> I'm asking a simple question, unless you don't think he would be an asset to the LAPD.<eos> - No, he-he would.
Would you like a green grape shoved in your... given to your mouth?<eos> Handed to your mouth?<eos> I'm asking a simple question, unless you don't think he would be an asset to the LAPD.<eos> - No, he-he would.<eos> He definitely would.
I was hoping that we could talk.<eos> No... no, no, no.<eos> - I'd really like to see you guys.<eos> - No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.<eos> - Really would.
Wow, don't think anybody at my high school would notice if I was abducted.<eos> Well, look how far you've come.<eos> You're now someone whose abduction... would be noticed.<eos> Yeah.<eos> It would.
Oh, really?<eos> Who gave it to you?<eos> You did.<eos> Stop or I'll drop it.<eos> You wouldn't.
I...<eos> I wouldn't be helpless anymore!<eos> Ah. Jedi way is revenge?<eos> Teach you this, your Master did?<eos> No. Kanan would never.
Well, look, either he is or he isn't.<eos> And if he isn't, he'll just laugh, surely.<eos> And if he is, well... it's not going to come as a surprise to him, is it?<eos> He knows whether or not he had a fling.<eos> Yeah, but he just wouldn't.
But Madame doesn't want any music in the house until my husband's home to hear it.<eos> You mind if I sit?<eos> The piece you keep playing...<eos> - I don't recognise it.<eos> - You wouldn't.
We should go one day, you know?<eos> - Go to Canter's and try it.<eos> - Sure.<eos> - Do you wanna try it?<eos> - Yeah, I would.
You, me.<eos> Your dad.<eos> I'd do anything for you, Fay.<eos> Anything.<eos> I would.
Your dad.<eos> I'd do anything for you, Fay.<eos> Anything.<eos> I would.<eos> I really would.
-14? You've got a license?<eos> No, but I've been driving since I was six.<eos> You expect me to get in this thing?<eos> With you? Well, you could get a bus if you'd rather.<eos> Fine yeah, I would.
You fought very hard in The Games, Miss Everdeen. But they were games.<eos> Would you like to be in a real war?<eos> No.<eos> Good.<eos> Neither would I.
Still, needs must these days... ..and at least one of us has a good business head.<eos> Don't I, Toby? Chop, chop!<eos> Take the captain up to his room.<eos> Unless, of course, you'd prefer to see Monsieur Poirot first.<eos> Yes, I would.
It might have been.<eos> Cos you boys meted out some rough justice, or so they say.<eos> I wouldn't know about that.<eos> No.<eos> No, you wouldn't.
Not six times. Just once.<eos> I don't think it works that way, child.<eos> He was a good man, Ned Stark. He's at rest now, somewhere.<eos> I would never wish my life upon him.<eos> I would.
And, oh, guess what.<eos> That's my job.<eos> Just trying to save the song.<eos> You can do it if you want.<eos> Oh, I would.
Now she's got a boyfriend... a guy you'll like, hopefully.<eos> Clickety-clack, she's married.<eos> Clickety-clack, she's putting you in a home!<eos> She would do it, too.<eos> She would.
Reid, there's a strategy that I'd like to put to you.<eos> It's going to require Drake, here.<eos> Go on.<eos> I would see Victor.<eos> Would you?
I didn't cheat, I never do.<eos> You're stupid.<eos> I'd cheat if I could.<eos> No, you wouldn't.<eos> Yes, he would.
Frank.<eos> Come on, people.<eos> Take your marks.<eos> Congressman, would you like to respond to that?<eos> Yes, I would.
Martha.<eos> What?<eos> Would you allow us a moment, Mr Bruton?<eos> Martha, would you have me...?<eos> No, Ezekiel Bruton, I would not.
I would hope that you might recognise that as an opportunity to assert the sanctity of that childhood and to be merciful.<eos> This boy and the others like him who we would blame for the violence on our streets, it is not they who we should punish, but the Fagins who stand behind them, directing that violence.<eos> These innocents, we should protect.<eos> You would urge an attempt at reformation?<eos> I would.
No, Thomas. You're to wait inside.<eos> Thomas Gower!<eos> The love we bear you.<eos> Does that not mean nothing to you?<eos> Squeal, would ya?
I'm sorry for ruining your Friday night.<eos> Are you kidding me?<eos> This is great.<eos> I'd do this for free.<eos> I really would.
But she hung up on you.<eos> I think the phone died.<eos> Power outage?<eos> Why would she turn off the power?<eos> She wouldn't.
I also noticed that he wasn't wearing it when he took me to dinner that night.<eos> And how long were you two having an affair?<eos> At first, we would just get together whenever he came to town.<eos> I don't even know that I would call it an affair.<eos> I would.
Don't you want them to?<eos> You heard what I just told you, right?<eos> That's what it's always like when they're together.<eos> So, no, not really.<eos> Would you?
It could still be fun.<eos> Yeah, maybe.<eos> Like a trouple.<eos> We'd make a very cute trouple.<eos> We would.
Mads will never give me another chance.<eos> So, yeah.<eos> Yeah, it is.<eos> If I help you and you hurt Maddie...<eos> I wouldn't.
They've withdrawn to a villa on the outskirts of Nuceria, within short ride of what remains of their legion to the north.<eos> Spartacus continues to gather force in the valley of Campania<eos> You know I would not have come if situation did not demand of it.<eos> No.<eos> You would not.

♪ Tell him, tell him right now. ♪<eos> Jake!<eos> I mean, I mean Jake, would you like to go to the Sadie Hawkins Dance with me?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, I would.
- Maybe multiple murderer.<eos> - What?<eos> Sorry. Tatyana said that two other girls with the same mark have gone missing in the last two weeks.<eos> - They haven't turned up here.<eos> - No, they wouldn't.
Even Volge.<eos> All the Votan races represented.<eos> Almost.<eos> If you'd like to contribute an Irathient item...<eos> I would not.
If you really die...<eos> Then I'll have to deal with all that burial crap.<eos> Maybe you don't care, but my parents will show up.<eos> - You wouldn't do that to me, would you?<eos> - I'd rather not.
What is that?<eos> Mona kept souvenirs.<eos> How many times did Cece visit her?<eos> - I wouldn't know.<eos> - Yes, you would, Wren.
Danny, James and Simon got you kicked out of school.<eos> Now you're doomed to work in a repair shop for the rest of your life.<eos> OK, I'm really pissed off.<eos> Mm-hm. You kill them?<eos> No, you wouldn't, would you?
I know you fancy yourself some kind of rebel, Axl, but sometimes in life, you just have to follow the rules.<eos> I put on sunscreen an hour before going outside.<eos> I wait till the bus comes to a complete stop before standing.<eos> You don't think I would love to fill up on bread?<eos> I would.
He probably doesn't go downstairs.<eos> Has Denise's lot not found anything that fits the bill as regards a weapon?<eos> How would you get rid of something if you couldn't leave the house?<eos> Lob it out the window.<eos> I would.
I'm over her.<eos> If you want to go out with her, go for it.<eos> I'm not going out with her.<eos> No, but you want to.<eos> Who wouldn't?
Oh, uh, look, I... I can explain.<eos> No, you don't have to, 'cause I get it.<eos> Michaela's my surrogate, but you decided to talk her into a singing career, because, I don't know, what could be better for my unborn child than long nights on a tour bus going from club to club?<eos> Silver, I wouldn't do that.<eos> Yes, you would, Dixon.
We made room for each other.<eos> I leave you off my list.<eos> And I leave you off mine.<eos> Well, would you be willing to sacrifice the integrity of your list?<eos> I would...
Okay, here's one. A customer who ordered enough paper to qualify for a volume discount now wants to return half the stock.<eos> You can't rebate the sales price or credit for future purchases because you brokered the deal for a third party.<eos> That's just a classic no-win situation.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - So I'd Kobayashi Maru it.
After the ten pages of escort services, there were listings for a dozen old cars in our price range, which was exactly $830 or under.<eos> What is with your guys' irrational fear of credit?<eos> Everybody uses it.<eos> But if everybody jumped off a cliff, would you?<eos> I would.
Thank you for seeing me.<eos> I just wanted to bring one small thing to your attention, if you have some time.<eos> I always have time for you, Elsbeth.<eos> Oh, would you like a biscotti?<eos> Why, yes, I would.
All of it, not bits, not pieces, all.<eos> Or I leave.<eos> Would you at least like to sit down first, Becky?<eos> No, Jessica.<eos> I fucking wouldn't.
Good.<eos> Not sure this is quite the...<eos> Beautiful woman, perfectly equipped.<eos> Now, you tell me, are these too small?<eos> Well, I wouldn't...
It's amazing, you know.<eos> You always look on the bright side of life, don't you?<eos> I try. Yeah.<eos> Oh, Christine's baby group is later this morning, if you want to take her.<eos> I would, but, I, uh...
Yeah.<eos> But he has Dr. Brennan.<eos> Yeah, yeah, yeah.<eos> And-and I'm sure, if they needed anything, they would ask.<eos> No, they wouldn't.
But he has Dr. Brennan.<eos> Yeah, yeah, yeah.<eos> And-and I'm sure, if they needed anything, they would ask.<eos> No, they wouldn't.<eos> No, they would not.
You're meant to be keeping calm.<eos> He won't do as he's told, Frankie.<eos> Never has.<eos> Joseph, would you go into cardiac care if it was just for the day?<eos> Yes, he would.
Let me make you a cup of tea.<eos> You're not attending my patients, remember?<eos> Grow up, Zoe.<eos> You don't think that he would take them, do you?<eos> Well, he wouldn't, would he?
No.<eos> You read about these things, it's nearly always the ex.<eos> Ian wouldn't do this.<eos> He wouldn't.<eos> He just wouldn't.
I don't want these sketches.<eos> I don't want this Xbox.<eos> Not gonna need this bourbon anymore.<eos> Alaric is not here to drink it, I mean, unless you guys are willing to bring back every supernatural creature on the other side to get him hick.<eos> Would you?
Now, then, I believe there was some mention of a thank-you drink?<eos> So just so I'm clear, you expect me to believe that Sterling beat both of you up then shot Cyril? Uh...<eos> Come on, for some haggard Mexican?<eos> I wouldn't really describe her as haggard.<eos> I would.
I'm serious, please, thank you, but we need to get back into Mexico.<eos> [ALL MUTTERING IN SPANISH] [SPEAKING IN SPANISH]<eos> What the hell kind of plan is this?<eos> I don't know if I'd call it a plan.<eos> No one would.
Sent me to private school.<eos> Sent me to brown, it sent me to wharton.<eos> I'm not about to apologize for it because some China doll has a stick up her ass.<eos> Stick up her ass would be a very good product for your guys.<eos> It would.
- 'Night.<eos> - Nighty-night.<eos> Tommy, Tommy, don't do anything I wouldn't do.<eos> - Oh. - No, I'm jok-<eos> - I would.
I did awful things for him, and... he's dead.<eos> Non... none of it mattered.<eos> And you're saying to save him, you wouldn't have done it all again?<eos> No.<eos> I wouldn't.
Oh, I had to step away.<eos> - Peter.<eos> - Hi, Veronica.<eos> Would you like to dance?<eos> I would.
What do you think of that?<eos> Well, you do know, don't you, that just because a car has go-faster stripes on it, it doesn't actually mean it goes faster?<eos> I know.<eos> You wouldn't go through Europe in a Stetson with chaps on, would you?<eos> He would.
Why are you like this?<eos> Quiet, Margaret.<eos> Do something.<eos> For once, do something!<eos> Jasper would.
- The wonder is anyone buys the stuff.<eos> Pour me one while you're there.<eos> Pour it yourself.<eos> You'd pour him one.<eos> Yeah, I would.
Uh... Protestant.<eos> Presbyterian.<eos> Yeah, that's not so far off, hm?<eos> So, would anyone like coffee?<eos> I would.
Where did you play?<eos> I played around the country for about 20 years.<eos> Yeah. You know, I actually did a gig at the Carlyle Hotel.<eos> Daily News loved me.<eos> Well, why wouldn't they, Mom?
But if someone put a gun to your head and you had to pick?<eos> Who would it be?<eos> Is someone going to put a gun to my head?<eos> Just pick, Violet.<eos> I'd rather not.
As a surrogate, what is it you do?<eos> I work with people who are having a hard time reaching their sexual potential.<eos> Well, Mr. Hewett would say that that's what a prostitute does.<eos> Wouldn't you?<eos> Yeah, I would, actually.
What about Jane?<eos> I don't think he has anything.<eos> But he'd tell you if he did.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, he would.
Good news is you're both here, which means neither of you killed Eileen.<eos> That's off to a reasonably good start.<eos> Gentlemen, please don't even think about it.<eos> E-Eileen would want you two to be making peace.<eos> Like hell she would.
- No. In a really horrible, horrible way.<eos> - What?<eos> - You would kill the murderer to avenge my death, right?<eos> - I would want to kill them... - Mm-hmm.<eos> - Very badly, but I would not.
Andrew. We're calling him Andrew.<eos> Stan's brother.<eos> Have you held him yet?<eos> I told him, I says, "You're gonna drop him."<eos> I wouldn't.
There's a nuclear warhead 20 feet beneath us.<eos> Are you sitting comfortably?<eos> - You would destroy London?<eos> - To save the world?<eos> Yes, I would.
The Ripper, know him unequivocally for that killer, what would we do?<eos> There is what I would like to do.<eos> And there is what I am permitted to do.<eos> And so instead of pinioning his head to the wall through his eyeball, we would show him our irons then go about the process of proof.<eos> We would.
There is what I would like to do.<eos> And there is what I am permitted to do.<eos> And so instead of pinioning his head to the wall through his eyeball, we would show him our irons then go about the process of proof.<eos> We would.<eos> I would.
They think that you snuck some home, used one of your perfectly legal needles to kill your cheating girlfriend.<eos> Look, I'm not denying that we had troubles, but I would never hurt Mia.<eos> You need to believe me.<eos> I'd like to.<eos> I really would, Ben.
I don't know, I want things.<eos> I want to, like, mow a lawn, you know, my lawn, in dark socks.<eos> What's my move with Jess?<eos> What would you do?<eos> Of course you would, you dirty dog.
So if you're upset that you lost the cure and your brothers ditched you, why are you still in Mystic Falls?<eos> Some of us don't have the option of leaving.<eos> Some of us are broke and failing all of our classes and stuck here.<eos> So why don't you take your freedom and get the hell out of town?<eos> I would.
Oh, no, don't worry.<eos> It's fine.<eos> - Emily?<eos> - Yes? Edgar would like to say hi to you.<eos> Edgar would?
- Oh.<eos> I haven't seen much of her lately.<eos> Guess she's spending some time down in Palm Springs.<eos> - Wouldn't know.<eos> - Neither would I.
Before we take this upstairs, I think we should go over your files.<eos> You know, maybe let me take home what you got so I can get familiar.<eos> I'd rather keep them in my safe.<eos> All right, then at least give me the tapes.<eos> I'd rather not.
Well, that sounds like an incredible opportunity.<eos> Yeah.<eos> It is. They only chose five Americans.<eos> So... would you like to come with me?<eos> Would I what?
♪ Who's that girl?<eos> ♪ ♪ It's Jess. ♪ It was after prom.<eos> Cece and I were both 18, and we'd rented a hotel room.<eos> So... would you like to freak?<eos> Yes, I would.
You shouldn't be here.<eos> No, Nick.<eos> You shouldn't be here.<eos> I'd like you to go.<eos> No. You wouldn't.
I didn't know that.<eos> I told him you wouldn't like that.<eos> - Oh, no.<eos> - If we dated.<eos> Nope, I would not.
Jack, that's just a ridiculous lie.<eos> That's just a horrible, horrible, mean, vicious lie!<eos> That's what she said.<eos> Why would she make up something like that?<eos> - Yeah, why would she?
Mr. Glass, Connor is worried about you, so he sent me here to see if you're okay.<eos> I'm fine.<eos> I'm just under deadline pressure.<eos> I'd like to take your word for that.<eos> Um, I would.
( Sighs )<eos> ( Sighs )<eos> It was in Hanna's locker.<eos> Why would Cece use an envelope from the place where she used to work?<eos> She wouldn't.
Here.<eos> About who the true leader of the 5446?<eos> Let's define it over!<eos> If we're lucky, Some of us could stay alive.<eos> Or only you would.
It's a copy of Colonel Mariga's deposition.<eos> My copy count didn't reconcile with the machine.<eos> It was off by seven pages, the exact amount of that.<eos> You thought I wouldn't notice.<eos> I would.
Come up here once a day for a few minutes to remind myself of what it is I'm protecting.<eos> It's beautiful.<eos> Why did you send me away?<eos> Because if I hadn't, I'd have buried you a long time ago.<eos> No, you wouldn't.
I'm never going to do it again.<eos> Yo, what was it like?<eos> I've seen a guy trying to kill his best friend for a fix.<eos> And I always wondered, if I tried it, would I understand?<eos> You would.
That's what that is!<eos> The Germans wouldn't do a stamp with a half-track just outside Warsaw.<eos> Exactly. No, they really wouldn't.<eos> No, Jeremy, definitely, they wouldn't do that.<eos> They wouldn't, would they?
I'm very proud of you, son.<eos> Maybe I haven't given you enough responsibility.<eos> I'm gonna fix that.<eos> You'd like that, wouldn't you?<eos> Yeah, I would.
- Maddie?<eos> Can you come join us?<eos> We're gonna take a picture.<eos> No, thanks.<eos> - Would you, please?
And, yes,<eos> Penny the school nurse will be in attendance.<eos> (gasps) Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm gonna go guarantee a sold-out show.<eos> How are you gonna do that?<eos> The same way Gaga would:
No, but I may have texted something about you that I didn't mean, so just please don't look at your phone.<eos> Uh, okay.<eos> If it's something bad, I don't want to see it anyway.<eos> She's gonna look at it, isn't she, Earl?<eos> I would.
Muff boxes?<eos> - Just for her.<eos> - And there were watches, called montres lubriques, lubricous watches, which used the clockwork to show her doing rather pornographical things, in a sort of like a sort of automaton kind of thing, a little movement.<eos> Oh, God, you wouldn't want the grandfather clock with a pendulum version, would you?<eos> No, you certainly wouldn't.
- Take it if you want it, dude.<eos> - I was just thinking maybe-maybe you guys could chip in a little bit.<eos> - 'Cause it was expensive. - You want one of Winston's tacos?<eos> I'll take 50 cents on the dollar, I really would.<eos> I really would.
Both: A sturgeon dressed like Stoick.<eos> Aha! That's everything.<eos> Now, let me in!<eos> Yeah, we would love to, Snotlout.<eos> Really, we would.
Stacey, tell him right now.<eos> No! I...<eos> I promised Amy.<eos> And I am telling you that Amy would want you to tell.<eos> No, she really wouldn't.
No, you didn't.<eos> You just tried to help.<eos> Don't do this.<eos> My father would've wanted it this way.<eos> No, he would not.
Every day I promise myself I won't be drunk, and then every day I find meself with a glass in me hand.<eos> I had to free you from me and the only way that I could do that was to have another drink inside me.<eos> I have lied to you, yes.<eos> But you tell me, if you can tell the truth, would it've been a better life if you'd stayed with me than the one that you've had?<eos> No. No, it wouldn't.
Just once.<eos> (Scoffs) If he did that...<eos> If he just admitted...<eos> I think I'd make a hell of a governor.<eos> Yeah, you would.
Poor thing went through a lot of trouble to make that.<eos> She should get that back.<eos> You really think she wants to eat her dead sister's birthday cake?<eos> Why not?<eos> I would.
That was stupid.<eos> That was.<eos> Why did you trust me, stupid?<eos> What if something happened?<eos> But you wouldn't.
She's your mistress.<eos> Good night.<eos> What were you doing in there?<eos> Did Mom say something to you?<eos> Of course she would.
You think you saved me from something?<eos> You killed me.<eos> Amelia... if you had gotten that heart, they would have doubled the payment and then tripled it, till you couldn't pay it, and then they would have turned yours off, too.<eos> I just want more time with my family.<eos> Wouldn't you?
But I guess no one in this family wants to admit that, and it's a shame too, because I had a great eulogy.<eos> You do?<eos> Yes. I do.<eos> Would you like me to share it with you?<eos> I most certainly would.
- Oh, it's a lovely story.<eos> It's a nice story, but it's not true.<eos> Can you imagine in the bird world if you introduced postcodes?<eos> Penguins would move.<eos> - Yes, they would!
As you would expect.<eos> I would feel, as a clergyman, sort of bound to sort of...<eos> Are you a clergyman?<eos> - I would sort of feel obliged to kind of be nice to them.<eos> - Oh, you would.
On television, a falling Addy machine doesn't seem like it would hurt.<eos> In fact, it seems almost funny, but...<eos> Parker tragically discovered that life is not always like it is on TV.<eos> Would anyone care to share a few words?<eos> I would.
I want to grow up before I die.<eos> So did my brother.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I didn't ask for this.<eos> Who would?
- Then you wouldn't have to say<eos> - Heaven isn't too far away - Heaven isn't too far away<eos> Heaven isn't too far away<eos> Yeah, heaven isn't too far away<eos> 'Cause I'd already
- Pour on.<eos> - What is it, Paddy?<eos> - Wouldn't you like to know.<eos> - Not really, no.<eos> - You would, though.
I don't give a shit.<eos> They always do that.<eos> Pain in the ass.<eos> Wouldn't come in here I know I got to go through shit like that.<eos> Shit, I would.
Still, not many of us can say our lover died for love.<eos> Love?<eos> "Thou shall not covet thy neighbor's wife."<eos> Would you die for love, Konstantin Dmitrievich?<eos> I would.
Want a beer?<eos> As long as it's cold.<eos> You seeing someone?<eos> Would you like to see my new tattoo?<eos> Would you?
I'm sorry that he's not here any more.<eos> As are many others.<eos> I'll do my best to fill his shoes.<eos> You'd like me to hear your confession?<eos> Yes, I would.
Resident pro at a course in Terre Haute, Indiana.<eos> Were are you going, anyway?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Would you like a ride to Terre Haute?<eos> No, I wouldn't.
Absolutely no idea, but...<eos> - What the hell are you doing here?<eos> ! - Nice to see you too<eos> I'm on holiday, would you believe?<eos> No, I wouldn't.
That kind of thing could lead a man to drink.<eos> - Yes.<eos> - And then his glorious mangina might make an appearance.<eos> Wouldn't want to see that happen, would we?<eos> Actually, I would.
You cannot touch the sacred tree.<eos> Ahhhhhhhhh!<eos> I guess my bite is worse than your bark.<eos> You, you wouldn't dare.<eos> Oh, yes I would.
Klaus released me from a curse that was ruining my life.<eos> I owe him for that.<eos> What if he asked you to...<eos> Jump off a bridge?<eos> He wouldn't.
I'd be fine.<eos> I'm a hybrid.<eos> Ok.<eos> So what if he asked you to rip your own heart out?<eos> Again, he wouldn't.
I just can't imagine eating...<eos> I think... that we have just found our first opportunity to award some money tonight.<eos> Iris.<eos> I would like for you to eat the steak and the foie gras.<eos> I really would.
If I had to save one disc on my desert island from the waves, that would...<eos> You are very kind.<eos> Well...<eos> Look, I'm sure Rowan won't be long.<eos> Would you, um...
She was wearing it in that old picture, right?<eos> The one dad had in his wallet.<eos> He would be really proud of you, you know?<eos> Yeah.<eos> He would.
That's right.<eos> The Tea Party is all about self-reliance.<eos> Look, there's even a Tunnel of Self-Love.<eos> Would you like to buy a photo of yourself on the ride, sir?<eos> No, I would not.
Tom?<eos> Yes, ma'am?<eos> You would take a bullet for the president, wouldn't you?<eos> Yes, ma'am.<eos> Hal? Yes, ma'am, I would.
Kept at arm's length, because his views don't fit.<eos> Does he suspect that?<eos> I suspect it. He may ruin his career.<eos> Your mother-in-law would be proud of you.<eos> No, she wouldn't.
The best one's between your legs.<eos> Learn how to use it.<eos> Drink.<eos> Do you have any notion of what happens when a city is sacked?<eos> No, you wouldn't, would you?
Most kings grew up as princes.<eos> They spend their whole lives preparing for the crown.<eos> I was raised to be Lord of Winterfell. to play the harp and dance the latest steps and recite Valyrian poetry.<eos> I'd like to hear you play the harp.<eos> you would not.
You remembered.<eos> Of course.<eos> I'll never forget.<eos> Would you like to say it again?<eos> I would not.
There's something about Carl I don't trust.<eos> - He's got really shifty eyes.<eos> - They're not shifty; he suffers from mild sensory exotropia.<eos> Well, that would make what I just said incredibly insensitive, then, wouldn't it?<eos> - Yes, it would.
Last night.<eos> Before the killings.<eos> And he never joined the guys to hunt the wolf.<eos> But I'm sure he wouldn't have killed them.<eos> He wouldn't.
I Should Have Never Thought Horseback Riding<eos> Would Be Any Better Than Ziplining.<eos> This here waterfall is called Heartbreak Falls.<eos> Would you all like to know why it's called Heartbreak Falls?<eos> I certainly would!
You're going to have the best time.<eos> Ooh! Oh, remember how I've been working on origami?<eos> This is my new favorite.<eos> Do you think I should show Luke my goose?<eos> Well, I would.
The ones we thought would forever be at our side.<eos> But in their passing, the chains that bound us to desires not our own have been struck.<eos> And without such a blow, we would not find ourselves in each other's arms.<eos> No.<eos> We would not.
Here's the aftereffect. Good.<eos> Can you tell who did it?<eos> No, but I can tell you where it was done.<eos> Would you like that?<eos> I would.
What Daelman lost is not.<eos> Well, given the circumstances, I'd make the same choice Ortiz did.<eos> Run after them and shoot? No.<eos> Mm-mmm.<eos> Neither would I.
But why?<eos> Why can't you do the surgery?<eos> Uh, the chief of surgery, Ellis Grey, will be doing the... it.<eos> Uh, I mean, I can.<eos> I would.
If I give the police an excuse to blame this on our children, they might just do that.<eos> Why don't we just let this play itself out, see how it goes.<eos> Do you want Ben to go to prison for something he didn't do?<eos> He wouldn't last two minutes in prison.<eos> Oh, and Dylan would?
Almost transformed a couple of days later.<eos> - Then we should find him.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I've been trying to think of his name, but I can't remember it.<eos> Olivia would, though.
We're talking homes that are worth 300k and up.<eos> She wants you to help, wants you.<eos> Homes that currently get zero dollars per month while you wait for real estate to recover.<eos> Would a $500 a month subsidy for families make it easier for your banks to bite?<eos> It would, for a single year.
Hey, man, maybe you could help me out.<eos> Yeah, look, I don't know, man.<eos> It'd piss her off if I did, you know?<eos> I...<eos> Yeah, it would, wouldn't it?
He knows his stuff with furniture and pictures.<eos> He'll walk into a saleroom and sniff out what everybody else has missed.<eos> He just knows... everything!<eos> Of course, he wants to make me suffer.<eos> What man wouldn't?
I'm not sure I could talk my way out of that one if the C.I.A. ever found out.<eos> Right.<eos> I said, "I," not "we."<eos> I'd be doing it alone.<eos> No, you wouldn't.
- Andy, if I may--<eos> - Yes.<eos> Dogs tend to take on the personalities - of their owners-- - Mm-hmm.<eos> So if you were to sit on your couch all day watching cartoons and eating nothing but Cheetos, that's what he would want to do too.<eos> Who wouldn't?
Finding the hidden advantage in an unfortunate circumstance.<eos> Using pain to take you to the next level.<eos> Those are the things that turn players into kings.<eos> Yeah, I guess you would know.<eos> Yes, I would.
And weird.<eos> I mean, it would be weird.<eos> You had 15 happy years there.<eos> Why would it be weird?<eos> Because it would.
I think ten million qualifies as being ahead.<eos> This is the question.<eos> If you didn't take this break, would you still do the job?<eos> If I'm honest.<eos> No, I wouldn't.
I'm not some kind of hooker.<eos> I mean, I'm just naturally sexy which doesn't mean I have sex with every guy I go out with.<eos> It must be the blonde hair.<eos> You won't believe what that Ethan guy just asked me!<eos> Maybe I would.
- That's great.<eos> Margaret?<eos> I wouldn't dare follow that.<eos> I'd like to see what's up your sleeve.<eos> You would, would you?
But it's impossible.<eos> You know that.<eos> Fraternization between ranks isn't just inappropriate, it's illegal.<eos> You won't tell, will you?<eos> Of course not, but others would.
And what if one was open?<eos> You're your own worst enemy.<eos> I can't help it.<eos> I wouldn't have taken anything.<eos> Yes, you would.
Ah, I dunno.<eos> I think I'm flawed.<eos> HE LAUGHS Hey, have you done it with her yet?<eos> See you later.<eos> I would!
Hey, Kat, it's your old buddy, Cam Hicks.<eos> And I just wanted to say, for the record, thanks for saving my life today, but you are the most annoying person in the world to take a road trip with.<eos> Hey.<eos> What I said before, about if I could help you forget, I would?<eos> I wouldn't.
Come on, what?<eos> Is this an election story?<eos> Something about Jim's campaign?<eos> You wouldn't understand.<eos> Of course I wouldn't.
No, listen to what I'm telling you-- I can't give my approval.<eos> The deal's a day away from being signed-- three years.<eos> I have approval over my executive producer.<eos> - You would think so, wouldn't you?<eos> - I would, yeah.
Are you all right?<eos> Just needed to talk to someone.<eos> All right, let's go somewhere and talk.<eos> Want to get a bite to eat?<eos> Yeah, I would.
Simmer down.<eos> Ms. Kaswell, while I find EVK's actions contemptible, I can't justify calling Mr. Kaswell a tenant.<eos> One minute, Your Honor.<eos> We would like to amend Mr. Kaswell's motion.<eos> We would?
Even last Dinah, what happened was, we were supposed to be friends at that time, and me and Whitney had gotten into a fight, but she knew how much I loved Whitney.<eos> Even if we weren't, like, perfect, you know.<eos> And she made out with her in the pool and looked right at me, and was like... you're on your own and... if she could push me off a cliff and nobody knew about it,<eos> - she would.<eos> - She would.
There's nothing out there.<eos> It's really depressing.<eos> Let me ask you something.<eos> If I can get Merc to say yes... would you come back?<eos> Like he ever would!
Me being the bad cop.<eos> That's not what I meant.<eos> I've hired Mona Fredricks to replace Ezra Stone.<eos> I'd like you to stay on as well.<eos> You would?
What is my favorite deep cover mole in the Defense Department drinking this evening?<eos> - For God sake, Kylie.<eos> - Relax.<eos> I could give you a lap dance right here and no one would notice today.<eos> I would.
I'm sorry.<eos> Would you say that to a woman?<eos> By starting to get physical, she loses the right to say "Stop"?<eos> You would never say that.<eos> No, I wouldn't.
Can you do that?<eos> - That's some pretty blatant complimenting you're doing there, man.<eos> I don't even talk to her like that.<eos> - Uh, Brandon?<eos> - I would.
I have no reason to think that it won't.<eos> This is what she does.<eos> You see, she browbeats.<eos> Dr. Goran, so what you're saying is if it was you, you'd have the surgery?<eos> Yes, I would.
Says fish.<eos> Could be something else.<eos> That come off the ocean, right?<eos> I wouldn't have a clue about that.<eos> Who would?
We sue the DA's Office for slander, defamation of character, and we also go after Odom personally.<eos> He's the handling DA.<eos> He'd have qualified immunity.<eos> We can't.<eos> No, he wouldn't.
It's... it's "muse."<eos> I know.<eos> Just wanted to see you smile.<eos> Will you tell me what you're so upset about?<eos> I'd rather not.
Before I publish, would you wanna warn the subject of this week's serial?<eos> You know, let 'em know that they're about to be totally skewered?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Uh, yeah, no.<eos> No, I'd rather not.
(Beep) Is there a stakeout set up?<eos> There's one in the crypt.<eos> Why? Senator Davis, what's your response to the majority leader stepping down?<eos> Should senator Schumann resign his seat?<eos> - I would.
I didn't say anything.<eos> You wanted privacy; I gave it to you.<eos> I didn't even know who you really were until today.<eos> I'd like to believe you, Bruce.<eos> I really would.
Eddie, give me a call when you get in.<eos> Eddie, I'm 40 pages further in.<eos> It's a little grandiose, but I'm still reading.<eos> OK, how did you do this?<eos> I 'd really like...
For everything you've been through.<eos> Go on, take it.<eos> What if she told them where you were going?<eos> Liz?<eos> She wouldn't.
- Hey.<eos> Nice moves.<eos> - Hey.<eos> I know you were trying really hard out there, but it just didn't work.<eos> Hey, would you ever?
Put some honey butter on them muffins. They'll taste an awful lot better that way.<eos> Oh! Motherfuck!<eos> Now, that's not so bad.<eos> I can fix that if you'd like.<eos> I would.
Well, doesn't drink that much.<eos> And who I'm gonna spend the rest of my life with.<eos> A woman named Katherine.<eos> Would you like to dance with your wife, Doctor Maccabee?<eos> Yes, I would, Mrs. Maccabee.
So it's mutual.<eos> You don't believe in taking things slowly, do you?<eos> Imagine I'm going to die in two days and I ask you to spend them with me, both going all out.<eos> would you do it?<eos> Of course I would.
Of what?<eos> Of you.<eos> You know, I thought you would kick me out 'cause you didn't want to be with a guy without a job.<eos> I don't.<eos> Who would?
Will you please tell your mama, "Don't worry"?<eos> You realize that's pointless advice to give a mother, right?<eos> Yes.<eos> wouldn't you hate it if we didn't reassure you?<eos> Yes, I would.
This is very un-American.<eos> Felix Attino.<eos> Columbian.<eos> That explains why he's un-American, but not why he speaks Arabic.<eos> This would.
I wasn't swinging around a pole.<eos> Good, good.<eos> There was one time I put body glitter on.<eos> Well, I don't think you have to worry about Penny telling my sister that.<eos> No, she wouldn't.
We had a pressurization problem on the descent.<eos> Where is Maria Gallego?<eos> Oh, yeah, uh...<eos> I'm hoping that you're going to honor our agreement.<eos> My cousin Carter would.
- That's not the point.<eos> What is the point, then?<eos> These are my friends.<eos> They wanted me to do it. Yeah? And if your friends wanted you to do drugs, would you do that?<eos> Of course I would.
- It's a clam, Stu.<eos> Next thing I know, you'll be sticking your dick through the bottom of that tub of popcorn, - Diner-style.<eos> - Would that have worked?<eos> Wouldn't you like to know, Stu?<eos> Actually, I would.
How messed up are we, when my story can be seen as inspirational?<eos> You're going to be killed by a werewolf.<eos> A wolf-shaped bullet.<eos> Bang! - Would you like to have a baby?<eos> - Yes, I would.
What happened?<eos> You have every reason to hate me.<eos> I don't even know why I'm here.<eos> I don't hate you.<eos> I would.
I'm not mad at Lux for not telling me.<eos> I'm mad because she did.<eos> I would give anything to unknow this.<eos> If I could go back and be like my mom, happy and oblivious.<eos> Because I would...
And then you kill their brains.<eos> Wouldn't hypovolemic shock render the second step unnecessary?<eos> 'Cause when you shoot a zombie in the head, sometimes the brains sneak out through the hole, and then you have to kill that separately.<eos> I see. I think. Mm-hmm.<eos> Or maybe I'd rather not.
What are you going to do to them?<eos> What I have already told you will have to suffice.<eos> Any more and I'll just have to glamour it out of you.<eos> Well, we wouldn't want that, would we?<eos> No, we wouldn't.
Yo, don't be a fuckin' moron!<eos> Dumb ass.<eos> You don't think a vampire wouldn't rip you to pieces in a heartbeat?<eos> I'd fuckin' put up a fight at least.<eos> No, you wouldn't.
Who?<eos> Ida?<eos> That's a lie.<eos> She would never do it, never.<eos> Oh, yeah, she would.
No, come on.<eos> I mean, so many parents just take their kid's side acting like children themselves.<eos> If Ethan had broken two of Zachary's teeth Alan and I might have had more of a knee-jerk reaction.<eos> I'm not sure we would see the big picture.<eos> Sure you would.
And you have another flashback?<eos> That was an accident.<eos> You tell that to the next Danny Ferris...<eos> Wouldn't this be better?<eos> Yeah, it would.
When I was with John Rowland, every sense was heightened, it was like this...<eos> Skip it.<eos> You wouldn't understand.<eos> Oh, really?<eos> Wouldn't I?
Sarah, please.<eos> And I'm sure you weren't christened Jones.<eos> Ben. Thank you, Ben.<eos> Would you like a coffee?<eos> No, he wouldn't.
- Did they freak out?<eos> - No.<eos> I told them nature or nurture, it's your fault, so get over it.<eos> Good answer.<eos> - I would, but...
We wanted to take all precautions, leave nothing to chance.<eos> Thank you for letting him up on the ship.<eos> Every being in the universe understands a mother's pain when her child suffers.<eos> You would have done the same for my children.<eos> I would.
She's gone.<eos> Sorry.<eos> George.<eos> Would you like to have... a little... hairy baby with me?<eos> Yes, I would.
It could rip a hole in the universe.<eos> Except he's done it before.<eos> In fairness, the universe did blow up.<eos> But he'd want to know.<eos> Would he?
Being the leader of a post-apocalyptic gang of outlaws has been exhausting.<eos> Hey.<eos> Thanks for coming today with Hal.<eos> You'd do it for me.<eos> Yeah, I would.
Why?<eos> There's a problem.<eos> She went off this morning, and a crash team was called.<eos> They intubated and ventilated her.<eos> They would.
- This is ridiculous.<eos> I'm his son.<eos> If he talk, he'd talk to me.<eos> - Would he?<eos> - Of course he would.
We just wanted to have a little talk.<eos> That's all.<eos> I really want to go to my room.<eos> Would anyone care for some more wine?<eos> Oh, I would.
Maybe we'll see you in Fort Benning someday.<eos> Rick signing off.<eos> Just thinking about our trip to the Grand Canyon with Carl.<eos> I don't remember that.<eos> No, you wouldn't.
Fuck off.<eos> Pamela Stewart.<eos> You haven't got a son called Alan Stewart, have you?<eos> What do you know about it? He's the one who grassed up pizza face.<eos> He'd never. No?
It's Barney.<eos> Wow. Really, dude, bravo.<eos> You almost got a peek.<eos> But seriously, what second-rate community theater did you get...?<eos> Would you...?
Well, it occurred to me that you might be tempted to tell someone about my little business venture.<eos> Oh, you mean your Ponzi scheme?<eos> Knock it off, Rose.<eos> Unless you want me to tell your husband that you're having an affair with my brother.<eos> You wouldn't.
That's wrong.<eos> My hand is not that liver-spotted!<eos> I'm having that.<eos> You wouldn't wear such cheap cassocks either.<eos> No, I wouldn't either.
I took the money, I took the drugs, I took the women.<eos> I booked the hookers, I paid the bribes.<eos> There was no wickedness, none, that I wasn't party to.<eos> So, if I'd killed Oscar, I would tell you.<eos> Would you?
I'm fine. - It's a nice day, for a Sunday.<eos> - It's Saturday.<eos> Oh, that's right.<eos> Would you like to have coffee?<eos> Because... I would.
I shall work through the night. Uh... Oh.<eos> Miss Lane, I beg you, don't throw him out.<eos> He has nowhere else to go.<eos> Miss Lane wouldn't turn a poor fellow out into the night.<eos> Indeed, I would not, Mr Turrill.
I'm not the one in the wrong.<eos> You will be if you tell Paul.<eos> Wouldn't you want to know?<eos> In his situation?<eos> Wouldn't you?
I see.<eos> And he says there was no reason why you should not have a perfectly full and normal life.<eos> Just not a very mobile one.<eos> Would you like some tea?<eos> I would.
Get the salad.<eos> Would you like me to reimburse you for misdiagnosing your dog?<eos> - Stop it.<eos> - Yes.<eos> Yes, I would, actually.
Sorry.<eos> But killing Doug -- that would have made you feel better.<eos> Yeah, probably.<eos> But it wouldn't bring back my son, now, would it?<eos> No, sir, it wouldn't.
Get out!<eos> Suck home plate!<eos> Suck it!<eos> Want the last bite of my creamsicle?<eos> Yes, I would actually.
'She wanted to be free of it.' 'Would you do it again?<eos> ' 'I thought she was better off dead.' 'Yes, I realise that.<eos> 'What I'm asking is, would you do it again?<eos> ' 'Yeah, I'd do it again.<eos> Course I would.
I'm afraid he's going to leave me.<eos> Ben.<eos> I keep telling everyone he won't, but...<eos> But I'm afraid he will, and I wouldn't blame him.<eos> I would.
Very good, but hang on, because I think there was a bit of film there we didn't see.<eos> No, there wasn't.<eos> There was, from the final run.<eos> I think the audience would like to see it.<eos> No, they wouldn't.
Ade didn't blow it off.<eos> No, at least she cares.<eos> Ever since my sister's been missing, you've been acting like it's no big deal.<eos> Maybe you'd get it if your family was ever around.<eos> Yeah, maybe I would.
Can you manage that this time?<eos> She's always hated me.<eos> Maybe this is a chance to put all that behind you.<eos> I'd like that.<eos> Really, I would.
You promised we'd just stay an hour.<eos> Uh-huh. Unless you're having a really good time.<eos> It's the best time I've ever had, except for maybe every single night we've been in bed together.<eos> I don't think I'd count band camp.<eos> I would.
You are more than what he allows you to be.<eos> More than just some affirmative action spic who brown-nosed his way into the council chamber.<eos> You are right at the head of the fastest-growing immigrant population in the state, not to mention the country.<eos> Now that's something he should acknowledge with more respect.<eos> I would.
You are a criminal.<eos> I've known Mrs. Delfino for years.<eos> She pays for the grapes she eats in the produce section.<eos> She would never do anything bad.<eos> Sure, I would.
But I think I'll live.<eos> The T-shirts say so.<eos> No, um, seriously.<eos> I'll bet you anything if this guy didn't have a girlfriend that he'd be all over you.<eos> - Would he now?
Last week you didn't want her to go.<eos> Yeah, but I didn't not want her to get in.<eos> I was sure she would get in.<eos> You got in.<eos> Well, I wouldn't now.
Software engineer of the month.<eos> That's very impressive.<eos> But it doesn't quite explain the private security, the unlimited funds.<eos> No.<eos> No, it wouldn't.
Hey, don't say that.<eos> Don't you dare.<eos> You're sick.<eos> Nate would never do that.<eos> Of course he would.
You're sick.<eos> Nate would never do that.<eos> Of course he would.<eos> Believe me.<eos> He would.
Said it made her life feel clean.<eos> It's amazing what you do for someone you love.<eos> Get rid of your sheets... car... your past.<eos> I would have done anything for her.<eos> I still would.
I can't keep sneaking out to be with you.<eos> And if you didn't put the rats in his car, then who did?<eos> Your boyfriend.<eos> He would not do that.<eos> Yeah, he would.
I don't know.<eos> I don't know.<eos> Now don't lose hope.<eos> Molly wouldn't want that, now, would she?<eos> No, she wouldn't.
- Take it outside?<eos> - Wait.<eos> Are you two sleeping together?<eos> - He'd like to.<eos> - No, I wouldn't.
- Wait.<eos> Are you two sleeping together?<eos> - He'd like to.<eos> - No, I wouldn't.<eos> - Yes, you would.
Are you two sleeping together?<eos> - He'd like to.<eos> - No, I wouldn't.<eos> - Yes, you would.<eos> - No, I wouldn't.
Deputy Chief of Patrol Costello.<eos> Yeah, well, you want me to bum-rush him out of here, man?<eos> 'Cause I will.<eos> You ever wanna haul off and punch him in the face?<eos> - I would.
You were watching her.<eos> She was really mad.<eos> Because you had to turn around and tell her about it!<eos> She would've found out anyway.<eos> No, she wouldn't.
That's a brilliant idea.<eos> Brilliant.<eos> The whole time I've been here, it never occurred to me ... to commandeer the alien spacecraft.<eos> But I wouldn't know how to fly it.<eos> He would.
- Right.<eos> I used to be in the Girl Guides.<eos> - Were you indeed?<eos> - Mmm. Then you would know that the bowline is the best knot for mooring.<eos> I would.
Was his cock of impressive size when engorged?<eos> How many times did he have you?<eos> Speak.<eos> He would not have me.<eos> He would not?
Ah...<eos> Oh. Sorry.<eos> You might have told me she was Lady Raeburn.<eos> It didn't seem important.<eos> No, it wouldn't to you.
Sergeant Hathaway.<eos> Doctor. Isobel said... ..she said you think Andrew was murdered.<eos> ..she said you think Andrew was murdered. Would that surprise you?<eos> Yes.<eos> Well, yes, of course it would.
Dad, you're a polygamist.<eos> Yes, I'm aware of that, sweetheart.<eos> You can't run.<eos> You'd be exposed.<eos> We all would.
Absolutely not.<eos> But he's going to anyway.<eos> All hell's broken loose.<eos> - Can't they carry on privately?<eos> - If only they would.
Fifteen years ago I was in a bar in Marseille A Chinaman ... a cargoboat skipper was saying he lost a fortune<eos> A container of Star Wars figures. But no ordinary Star Wars figures faulty Darth Vaders - made brown like Ben Kenobi instead of black.<eos> Unique.<eos> Collectable<eos> But he'd lost'em in the storm
Stephen must know of their treachery.<eos> But if word came from me, Gloucester would have me hanged.<eos> You're asking me to do this?<eos> I'd never get an audience.<eos> Your bishop would.
If you want to keep him, you've got to look after him.<eos> What is it with me and volatile unsuitable men?<eos> Be honest with me, am I Ulrika Jonsson?<eos> And thank you, for not saying "I told you so. "<eos> As if I would.
I mean, the bond that you have with Lux already?<eos> - Most people would kill for that.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I mean...<eos> I would.
Why... why are they after you?<eos> What... what did you do?<eos> Would you believe me if I said I was innocent?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, I would.
Me.<eos> I did that.<eos> Why didn't you tell me she had a boyfriend?<eos> Because you would have freaked out.<eos> No, i wouldn't.
Let me see them on her before I make a decision.<eos> So... speaking of high school memories,<eos> Haley and Quinn organized that fundraiser dance at Tree Hill high tonight.<eos> And I just wanted to tell you in case you were thinking it'd be weird to go.<eos> Not that you would.
They're exactly what you wanted.<eos> Yes, because I'm a fucking moron.<eos> No, you're just a little insane, 'cause you hate everything you ever done.<eos> No real guy would wear these.<eos> - I would.
No.<eos> "No" what?<eos> No, it doesn't bother me.<eos> Oh.<eos> Yeah, well, it would me.
That's why it's easier for you.<eos> You get to decide when and if it's happening.<eos> And in fact, if you were to call a total stranger, Ask him to have sex, he will say yes.<eos> Please.<eos> No, he wouldn't.
You take good care of her.<eos> I don't know if I can go through this With a real daughter.<eos> Yes, you can.<eos> I know that was hard, but I bet You wouldn't give up this week With miss laroche vanderhoot for anything.<eos> No, I wouldn't.
You could do the kind of work you love.<eos> Not mending walls just to earn a shilling.<eos> Wouldn't you like that?<eos> Yes.<eos> I would.
Gracias.<eos> What was that?<eos> I just asked him if he wanted to have a glass of water<eos> And sit down for a minute,<eos> Like any kind person would.
If you do this, you will get hurt.<eos> I can still smell him on me.<eos> And we will get hurt coming after you.<eos> - No-one would come after me.<eos> - I would.
I can still smell him on me.<eos> And we will get hurt coming after you.<eos> - No-one would come after me.<eos> - I would.<eos> I would.
You are the best of a bad situation.<eos> Nothing more.<eos> I use you, man.<eos> Yeah, I would know if you were using me.<eos> Oh, oh, you would?
You're rushing to marry Ryan, but the second Baze says he likes you, you freak out.<eos> If you didn't have feelings for Baze, it wouldn't matter to you.<eos> He just told you that he has feelings for you.<eos> The least you can do is appreciate it for one second.<eos> I would.
- Yeah, I know you just sayin'.<eos> - You know we could...<eos> Well, he up there, you down here.<eos> Who would know?<eos> I would, baby.
If I was in love with Daniel, and I in't saying I am cos I in't...<eos> But if I was, and if he came all the way to Candleford just to see me, I would tell him I loved him.<eos> Would you tell him, Laura?<eos> Yes...<eos> - I would. - Oh!
There should be some stuff down there, have a look.<eos> I want the other life.<eos> You know, where we're happy and settled and about to have a baby.<eos> But don't you wonder, if that life is real, then why would we give up all this?<eos> - Why would anyone?
That's an odd combination, when you think about it.<eos> I mean, if you think about it.<eos> Milk... One sugar, right?<eos> No. No, and why would you know how I take my coffee?<eos> I wouldn't.
You may be on your way now, Sister.<eos> Sisters!<eos> You will of course want refreshment, My Lord.<eos> And company.<eos> Yes, I would.
I read in the paper the other day that for the first time, Saudi Arabia had a fashion show.<eos> Their top designer, Muslim Dior... is on a world tour with his spring line and they just happened to be in Raleigh, North Carolina tonight.<eos> And I asked some of the models if they would come over.<eos> Would you like to see the...<eos> You would?
- He's having a private moment.<eos> - He's getting off.<eos> - I light a couple of candles if I want to get in the mood...<eos> I don't torch my house.<eos> But a pyrophiliac would.
I'm not gonna risk dying before that.<eos> One more month?<eos> Our daughter is getting married, in a month.<eos> And I would like to see her do that.<eos> I would...
I want you.<eos> Now.<eos> And far from this location.<eos> But, no, wait. Okay, so that only leaves my mother.<eos> Why would my...
Thomas, what is it that you want?<eos> An eight-hour day.<eos> Recognition that I and my fellow workers are not at Miss Lane's beck and call when she chooses to say we are available and must work.<eos> Miss Lane, would you like to respond to Thomas's grievances?<eos> I would.
- That's part of carnival.<eos> - I hate the flambeaux and the hooded masked riders.<eos> I wished they'd do away with all that.<eos> I wouldn't miss the old line carnival stuff at all.<eos> - I would.
- What's his name?<eos> - Patrick.<eos> All right, imagine these two guys had Patrick working as a mule. Making him kill people.<eos> Wouldn't you do anything to protect your kid?<eos> Of course, I would.
And in a very different way.<eos> I have to tell you something<eos> And I probably shouldn't.<eos> I promised...<eos> I wouldn't,
The last time I opened a door,<eos> It set in motion the ripples that weaken the very fabric<eos> Of our reality.<eos> To do so again could instantly shatter Both worlds...<eos> And likely would.
I propose that we put up a notice.<eos> "Dog found." That will certainly attract the attention of anyone who might know of her master.<eos> Do you suppose she might care for another bowl of warm milk?<eos> Would you like warm milky-milky?<eos> You would, wouldn't you?
Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah.<eos> He's... he's doing a lot better.<eos> Thank God.<eos> You'd never know how bad he was before.<eos> No. I wouldn't.
I've got a patient coming to see me.<eos> Is it a girlfriend?<eos> I'd tell you if I had a girlfriend.<eos> No, you wouldn't.

I just want 24 hours for myself, okay?<eos> It's not a big deal.<eos> It's a huge deal, Grayson.<eos> I mean, anybody who knows anything about anything would think this is a huge deal.<eos> No, they wouldn't.
I'm over it.<eos> Yeah, he's over it; that's why he's been whining all day about trying to invent that memory-wiper gizmo from Men in Black.<eos> Is he making any progress?<eos> Because I'd like to erase Ben Affleck as Daredevil.<eos> So would Ben Affleck.
Hey, E, maybe it's time you start reading some.<eos> - Really?<eos> - Best script-finder in town.<eos> - Would you, E?<eos> - Of course he would.
You think she did fall out of a tree?<eos> Well, she wanted him to give her away.<eos> I know the dad-daughter thing is a thing, but... Irreparable brain damage? Maybe that's a recent discovery.<eos> I think she's walking around with the wounds of an abusive childhood festering in her head and she wants revenge before they kill her.<eos> (MOBILE RINGS) I would.
Okay.<eos> Throw him in the tar pit.<eos> You wouldn't do that.<eos> I wouldn't; he might.<eos> In fact, he would.
You understand that moving forward, we deal with the fact that my mother does not approve of you?<eos> I do.<eos> I find being cast in the role of bad girl oddly titillating.<eos> Would you like to see my cats?<eos> I would.
With one of the brothers that killed me.<eos> I assume he didn't live to tell about it.<eos> Actually, I spared him.<eos> He'd die before he'd let anything happen to her.<eos> They both would.
Bourbon in your coffee?<eos> Elena mentioned you needed my help.<eos> We were hoping you could help shed some light on the Lockwood family.<eos> Now, why would I know anything about the Lockwoods?<eos> Well, you wouldn't.
Fuck!<eos> What am I supposed to do with that information?<eos> Oh, let me guess.<eos> You want me to tell you.<eos> Yes, I would.
I've got a patient coming to see me.<eos> Is it a girlfriend?<eos> I'd tell you if I had a girlfriend.<eos> No, you wouldn't.
Thank you... for making her happy.<eos> This was my mother's.<eos> I wanted to give it to Melanie.<eos> But I want you to have it...<eos> If you would.
George, I really hope that you're not lying to me, you and Ashley, about her making the team.<eos> Why would we lie to you about that?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Why would you lie to me about that?<eos> We wouldn't.
Double trouble.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Okay, stop. Uh...<eos> I wouldn't say something like that.<eos> you totally would.
It's wonderful, I don't think I've ever been so close.<eos> It's like being inside a painting.<eos> You're actually inside the texture of the music in a way you could never imagine.<eos> I wish you could believe how happy I was.<eos> You wouldn't.
I'm Ella Montgomery, Aria's mom?<eos> - We met... - At the theater.<eos> I...<eos> I remember.<eos> Well, of course you would.
- Yeah.<eos> And if you've ever spent an entire day in a deer blind, you know that you do not want to open those. Ugh.<eos> You should see your dad.<eos> How would that help the case?<eos> Oh, it wouldn't.
You're not gonna take those off in here?<eos> No.I'm not.<eos> Well,I can take a look at your bullous lesions if you would like me to.<eos> - Maura,come on!<eos> - Would you?
I love Rita, you love Rita.<eos> What's ever changed?<eos> Except she's gone and we're still here.<eos> And she would be smiling on down on us right now and she'd be saying, "Make it work. "<eos> She would.
- Um, I second that.<eos> My vote is for Kim.<eos> And, uh, mine, too.<eos> Would anyone else like to say something?<eos> I would....

Good. I'm happy, too.<eos> Would you like to go out to dinner tonight, just the two of us?<eos> Spend a little time together outside of bed?<eos> Would you like to spend some time with me outside of bed?<eos> I would.
We have the people responsible for this in custody at the station right now.<eos> I want them held accountable.<eos> That's what we're counting on.<eos> Hey, would you like to go to coffee?<eos> You would?
Don't shoot, don't.<eos> What, are you gonna sing me a song about your family and kids?<eos> We are all heroes until we face a shotgun.<eos> Would you leave if those three got me then?<eos> Would you?
Then Ryan will help me.<eos> I mean, he'll give me his kidney.<eos> It doesn't work like that.<eos> Ryan can't give you his kidney.<eos> But he would.
We've had the chat... if I had the chance again, I would marry her a million and one times over, I would.<eos> No, you wouldn't.<eos> No, you wouldn't.<eos> Yes, I fuckin' would.<eos> No, you wouldn't, you wouldn't.
Does it sound like something that she would say?<eos> Does she sound like herself?<eos> We never--we never told her to not be afraid.<eos> Why would she say that?<eos> She wouldn't.
I was made fun of on the playground and I turned out pretty cool.<eos> You know what?<eos> Fuck it. Just as I have found what I'm looking for here maybe it's time you found what you're looking for.<eos> Steven, if you would like to take a Mexican wife -<eos> Yes, I would.

A 9- and a 4-iron!<eos> An edge and a hosel, like a -- like an iron?<eos> But it wouldn't be the 4-iron.<eos> I mean, this far from the hole, you'd use a 4-iron -- which if you got pissed off and mis-shot, you'd throw it in the water.<eos> Well, I would, anyway.

And I led them to believe that they would receive justice... but we let them down.<eos> So the least I can do is let them be heard.<eos> Given everything you've been through... would you do it again?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, I would.

She... she's totally into it.<eos> She makes you happy to be a man.<eos> I think she improves my marriage to a woman who lost interest in me after our third child was born.<eos> Would your wife agree with that?<eos> No, she would not.
Why?<eos> This is your wife's body.<eos> Just cause I'm not her doesn't mean we can't hook up.<eos> We know from experience Tara wouldn't like that.<eos> Sure she would.
